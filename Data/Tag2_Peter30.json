Rolling his eyes Steve picked up the bags and took them to Peter\u2019s room. </p><!-- more --><p>-</p><p>You quickly slipped on one of Peter\u2019s shorts and Bucky\u2019s T-shirt, and walked to Peter\u2019s room. You were confused when you only saw his bags there, but decided to check the common room to see if he was waiting for you. Your face fell when you didn\u2019t see him there sitting with everyone else. </p><p>\u201cNat do you know where Parker is?\u201d You asked. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in the lab, with your dad.\u201d She answered, focused on the movie. </p><p>\u201cK thanks!\u201d You jogged down to the lab, your face lighting up when you saw Peters concentrated face. You opened the lab door, your dads head perking up, his brows furrowing. </p><p>\u201cNonononononono, you know the rules.\u201d He said, making your face fall. Peter\u2019s head lifted up, raising his mask to give you a smile. </p><p>\u201c i just wanna say hi to Peter-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDad-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shorts when we\u2019re working with chemicals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you shitting me?\u201d You asked annoyed. </p><p>\u201cOut. Now.\u201d You huffed, stomping out of the lab back up to the common room. </p><p>\u201cWas he there?\u201d Nat asked when she saw you. You didn\u2019t answer only sitting next to her, grabbing the popcorn. Nat didn\u2019t say anything only, sharing her blanket with you, and letting you rest next to her. </p><p>It wasn\u2019t until 3 am, that Peter and Tony finished. Peter yawned as he walked into the common room, a soft smile on his face when he saw you sleeping on the couch. He knew you were tired so he just went to his room and got into bed. </p><p>This happened all week, Peter would wake up early, grab an apple for breakfast and go down to the lab with your dad, they spent the whole day there, and they\u2019d finish in the middle of the night. Everyone could see how annoyed you got, especially Steve considering how happy you were when he said he\u2019d be staying all week. You tried everything to get his attention. You\u2019d go into his room, to sleep next to him, you\u2019d try bringing him snacks, try giving him kisses, but nothing, he was too caught up with your dad. So you were obviously happy when your dad had to go to Chicago for a business thing. </p><p>You were surprised and annoyed that you hadn\u2019t seen Peter all day considering your dad left last night. You made your way down to the lab, only to find Peter sitting on the desk, writing equations and solutions down as Tony talked on the blue screen in front of him. </p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d You said crossing your arms. </p><p>\u201cNot right now y/n.\u201d He said not even looking up. You bit your lip looking up and down at Peter, an idea popping in your head. At this point you didn\u2019t care if your dad was chatting with Peter, you needed his attention. And talking definitely wouldn\u2019t do anything. You quickly ducked down, crawling quietly under the table. Peters leg was tapping on the ground as he took notes. You could hear him asking your dad questions, but at this point you wanted him to choke on his words, and that\u2019s exactly what he did.</p><p>You didn\u2019t bother teasing him, your hand already palming his cock. Peter choked on his words, making Tony raise his brows. Peter quickly said nothing and moved his chair back a little to see you unbuttoning his jeans.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m busy.\u201d He said strictly, his jaw clenched making you look up at him with a smirk, not even noticing that he lifted his hips up slightly to allow you to pull his jeans and boxers down.</p><p>\u201cDoes your cock always get hard when your \u2018busy\u2019 Pete.\u201d You said biting your lip when his cock sprang free. Peter was going to say something until your dad spoke up.</p><p>\u201cEverything alright Parker?\u201d Peters head snapped up.</p><p>\u201cYeayea keep g-<i>shit</i>!- sorry um keep going Mr. Stark.\u201d Tony looked at Peter for a second, brushing it off and continuing his talk. However Peter wasn\u2019t focused on that. All he could feel was your lips around him, your tongue swirling around his head, your hands massaging his balls. He whimpered slightly, covering his mouth as he leaned on the table to hide the noise. You hummed around him, pulling out making his cock twitch. You smiled seeing the pre-cum but you were still bothered that you weren\u2019t having his full attention.</p><p>You kissed his tip, blowing cold air on it making Peter move in his chair is cock now fully standing. His legs stretched out, holding your side and trying to bring you back. You laughed, licking around his hard cock, letting your teeth skim his tip, his hips jumping making your dad even more confused.</p><p>\u201cAfter that put the chip back into the wrist opening-\u201c Tony went on, Peters hand shaking as he tried to take notes as you blowed him. Your head bobbed, one hand holding his hips down and the other massaging his balls. Peter whined once more as you retracted, your lips from his length, your finger tapping his tip.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that Pete?\u201d Tony asked.</p><p>\u201cN-Nothin, just clearing my throat, keep going.\u201d Tony hummed continuing on. You could see the veins on his length bulging and his head swollen, pre-cum leaking. You continued to take small kitten licks, trying your best to trigger him and get him to notice you. Peter tried wrapping his hand around his shaft to get some friction, but you quickly slapped it away, making him look down at you with shock.</p><p>\u201cIs everything alright?\u201d Tony asked looking at Peter suspiciously. Peter was biting his bottom lip, trying his best to keep in the loud moan that\u2019s banging against his mouth. \u201cPeter you there?\u201d Tony asked once more. You sucked him harshly. Peter dropped his forehead on the table holding the arms of the chair tightly. \u201cPete?\u201d Tony was getting worried. Peter picked his head back up, you were getting him close to his high, but you were still teasing, and Peter had enough.</p><p>\u201cYes- I have to <i>fuck</i>- I have to go right now!\u201d Before Tony could answer Peter hung up the call. Pushing his chair back and grabbing your wrists pulling you up quickly. \u201cWhat the fuck-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t talked to me all week.\u201d You said as Peter quickly pulled your shirt off, unclasping your bra.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t give you the right to suck me off when I\u2019m talking to Mr. Stark aka YOUR DAD-\u201c Peters lips attached to your breast, pushing you back against the desk. You moaned, your hands tangled in his curls. Peter held your waist as he sucked and nibbled on your nipple.</p><p>\u201cI <i>ohhh</i>- I needed your attention- talking wasn\u2019t gonna- <i>fuck</i>\u201d You moaned feeling Peters hand inside your shorts and panties, rubbing your clit. Peter let his finger dip between your folds, your wetness already leaking out.</p><p>\u201cOh fuck baby- your so wet right now just by sucking me off.\u201d Peter said lips against your breast. He went back to sucking your breasts, leaving multiple hickies. He let two fingers go inside you, curling them as he began to pump, you held his shoulders, standing on your tiptoes.</p><p>\u201cPeter-P-please.\u201d You moaned, Peter could feel your walls clenching around his fingers. Before you could reach your high, he pulled them out and he didn\u2019t give you time to complain, already attaching his lips to yours. He licked your lips, pulling away so he could suck his fingers clean. You watched with wide eyes, your core clenching around nothing.</p><p>\u201cTaste so good babe.\u201d Peter said, his hands hooking around the wasteband of your shorts and panties and pulling them down, he lifted you up, sitting you on the desk, and pulled your shorts and panties completely off. You tugged on his shirt, making him take it off. He went back to kissing you, one hand holding the back of your neck, and the other rubbing your clit. You moaned into his mouth. Peter moved closer between your legs, his cock still out and hard.</p><p>\u201cPeter-I need you!\u201d You moaned again, almost whimpering now, the feeling of your core pulsing was too much.</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna be a good girl?\u201d Peter said kissing below your ear, making you moan.</p><p>\u201cY-Yes <i>fucking hell </i>Pete, I need you inside now!\u201d You were moaning so much and your wettness was leaking.</p><p>\u201cKeep begging baby, tell me how much you need it.\u201d He said rubbing your clit harshly, your mouth fell open.</p><p>\u201cP-Peter I need this- I need your cock inside me, I need you fucking me right now, please Peter, I have to feel you!\u201d You were whining and bucking your hips up for some friction. Peter couldn\u2019t help the smirk on his face, capturing your lips in his, his tongue forcing your mouth open. His hand wrapped around his cock, pumping a few times, he then rubbed his head on your clit making you moan into his mouth. \u201cP-Peter, pleas-\u201c Your head fell back, Peter going fully inside.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Peter said, bringing his hips out then snapping them back in. One hand had a firm grib on his shoulder the other was behind you keeping your balance and Peter picked up speed. \u201cIs- <i>uhhh</i>- is this what you wanted baby- <i>fuck</i>- my full attention!\u201d Peter was moaning as he drove his cock inside you. You were whimpering and cursing.</p><p>\u201cYes- so good Pete- make me feel so good!\u201d You moaned, arching your back a little. Peters eyes looked over your features, the sweat on your forehead and chest, your mouth open slightly moaning his name, your breasts moving fast with each thrust, Peter felt himself twitch inside you.</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me your on the pill baby- <i>fuck</i>- I needa cum inside you!\u201d Peter said breathlessly, picking up the speed.</p><p>\u201cY-Yea I am- shit P! Faster!\u201d You were crying out, Peter being really rough. You moaned as he nipped at your neck. Your walls squeezed his length, Peter could feel you dripping, which made him grunt louder.</p><p>\u201cCmon y/n- come on my cock baby.\u201d Peter said. You were tugging the back of his hair, as you chased your high.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s y/n?\u201d Steve asked Nat.</p><p>\u201cProbably the lab, she went to check up on Peter.\u201d Nat said.</p><p>\u201cOk, she hasn\u2019t been answering her calls so I\u2019m just gonna see if she\u2019s up for a quick mission.\u201d Steve said, heading down the hall, and down the short stairs.</p><p>However when he tried to open the lab door he found out it was locked.</p><p>\u201cSorry Captain Rogers, you would not wish to see that.\u201d FRIDAY said</p><p>\u201cHuh? Why don\u2019t I wish to see what?\u201d Steve asked confused.</p><p>\u201cMr. Parker and Ms. Stark having sexual intercourse.\u201d FRIDAY said, making Steve choke on the air.</p><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSexual intercourse is when a male and-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI know what sexual intercourse is FRIDAY!\u201d Steve shook his head, jogging back up the stairs. He didn\u2019t know there was a protocol for when people have sex. Tony really was cautious.</p><p>Peter came with a loud moan, his head dropping on your shoulder, his cum shooting inside you. He stayed there for a bit, letting the feeling of your hands in his hair calm him down. His hands held your waist, moving up to cup your breasts making you laugh lightly, his hands moved to your sides, finally picking up his head and kissing your cheek.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I should\u2019ve given you more attention, it\u2019s just Mr. Stark needed my help and I just- I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He said softly, making you smile.</p><p>\u201cYour fine, this didn\u2019t make it up tho, it did by a little, because you promised we\u2019d make pancakes together.\u201d You said, sounding like a baby. Peter smiled, kissing your nose.</p><p>\u201cYea I\u2019ll make the pancakes while you burn them.\u201d He teased</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t burn all of them!\u201d You said, Peter laughed, kissing your lips.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get changed, probably shower too, then we can make late night pancakes, how does that sound?\u201d Peter said, fixing your hair.</p><p>\u201cSounds splendid.\u201d You smiled brightly making him laugh. Peter pulled out- forgetting about the mess. \u201cPeter!\u201d You said, looking at the mix of your cum between your legs and on the table. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d You said looking up at Peter, who had a smirk on his face. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin.\u201d He said going over to the sink and grabbing a towel and crouching down between your legs. His eyes lingered, making you raise a brow.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it Peter?\u201d You said pushing him more.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d He was still looking at your pussy.</p><p>\u201cPeter-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou just look really fucking hot right now with my cum leaking out of you and yours also dripping down your legs and your body fucked out and your swollen clit and I really wanna take a picture.\u201d Peter talked fast, but you got it all, making you laugh.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead.\u201d You said, making Peters eyes finally look away from your pussy and in your eyes.</p><p>\u201cReally?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYea, just don\u2019t go leaking it everywhere, I don\u2019t need that.\u201d You said.</p><p>\u201cYea-No of course- I\u2019d never want anyone to see my baby like this.\u201d He grabbed his phone from the chair beside him, standing in front of you, still naked, and taking a picture. He took about two or three, finally putting it away.</p><p>\u201cYour such a dork.\u201d You teased as Peter cleaned you up.</p><p>\u201cYea but this dork really fucks you well.\u201d Peter said laughing.</p><p>\u201cOh definitely!\u201d You said making it sound sarcastic.</p><p>\u201cWe can go again right now!\u201d Peter said, puffing up.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t think you can handle that.\u201d You said putting your clothes on. Peters mouth was open in shock.</p><p>\u201cWhat! I can\u2019t handle it?!!! Oh baby your really in for it-\u201c his mouth fell open when you pressed your body against him, rubbing his cock on your lower half.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Your fingers lightly slid against his length, tapping on the head. His cock slowly started to harden. You went down to your knees slowly, stroking Peter a little more, however instead you pulled up his boxers and jeans, zipping it for him .</p><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d Peter said, his cock hard.</p><p>\u201cWe gotta get out of here.\u201d You said, pulling his hand and leading him to the exit.</p><p>\u201cWhyyyyy, you made me hard again, I need to be inside you right now-\u201c Peter chokes on his words when you opened the lab door and there stood Tony.</p><p>\u201cDad-\u201c</p><p>\u201cIt had to be the lab- it couldn\u2019t be your room, his room, the fucking gaming room, it had to be the lab?!\u201d Tony was fuming.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know-\u201c Tony held a hand up, shutting you up.</p><p>\u201cSave it, anytime FRIDAY activates <i>that</i> protocol I get notified, who\u2019s doing it and where there doing it- and you two teenagers, did it in my fucking lab! Where there\u2019s a rule! And you totally fucked up that rule with ur bodies up against my equipment! O god please tell me you didn\u2019t do it on the desk.\u201d Tony said , only two have you and Peter avoid eye contact with him. \u201cI\u2019m gonna pass out.\u201d Tony rubbed his temples.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry Mr. Stark-\u201c Tony stooped Peter this time.</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m suppose to be in a meeting right now, but you were acting weirder than usual on our call and I thought something was wrong, clearly now I understand what happened!\u201d Tony said .</p><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYea oh, I swear to god you both better run right now, or you\u2019ll both be dead.\u201d He said, and you and Peter didn\u2019t waste anytime.

Nat didn\u2019t say anything only, sharing her blanket with you, and letting you rest next to her. </p><p>It wasn\u2019t until 3 am, that Peter and Tony finished. Peter yawned as he walked into the common room, a soft smile on his face when he saw you sleeping on the couch. He knew you were tired so he just went to his room and got into bed. </p><p>This happened all week, Peter would wake up early, grab an apple for breakfast and go down to the lab with your dad, they spent the whole day there, and they\u2019d finish in the middle of the night. Everyone could see how annoyed you got, especially Steve considering how happy you were when he said he\u2019d be staying all week. You tried everything to get his attention. You\u2019d go into his room, to sleep next to him, you\u2019d try bringing him snacks, try giving him kisses, but nothing, he was too caught up with your dad. So you were obviously happy when your dad had to go to Chicago for a business thing. </p><p>You were surprised and annoyed that you hadn\u2019t seen Peter all day considering your dad left last night. You made your way down to the lab, only to find Peter sitting on the desk, writing equations and solutions down as Tony talked on the blue screen in front of him. </p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d You said crossing your arms. </p><p>\u201cNot right now y/n.\u201d He said not even looking up. You bit your lip looking up and down at Peter, an idea popping in your head. At this point you didn\u2019t care if your dad was chatting with Peter, you needed his attention. And talking definitely wouldn\u2019t do anything. You quickly ducked down, crawling quietly under the table. Peters leg was tapping on the ground as he took notes. You could hear him asking your dad questions, but at this point you wanted him to choke on his words, and that\u2019s exactly what he did.</p><p>You didn\u2019t bother teasing him, your hand already palming his cock. Peter choked on his words, making Tony raise his brows. Peter quickly said nothing and moved his chair back a little to see you unbuttoning his jeans.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m busy.\u201d He said strictly, his jaw clenched making you look up at him with a smirk, not even noticing that he lifted his hips up slightly to allow you to pull his jeans and boxers down.</p><p>\u201cDoes your cock always get hard when your \u2018busy\u2019 Pete.\u201d You said biting your lip when his cock sprang free. Peter was going to say something until your dad spoke up.</p><p>\u201cEverything alright Parker?\u201d Peters head snapped up.</p><p>\u201cYeayea keep g-<i>shit</i>!- sorry um keep going Mr. Stark.\u201d Tony looked at Peter for a second, brushing it off and continuing his talk. However Peter wasn\u2019t focused on that. All he could feel was your lips around him, your tongue swirling around his head, your hands massaging his balls. He whimpered slightly, covering his mouth as he leaned on the table to hide the noise. You hummed around him, pulling out making his cock twitch. You smiled seeing the pre-cum but you were still bothered that you weren\u2019t having his full attention.</p><p>You kissed his tip, blowing cold air on it making Peter move in his chair is cock now fully standing. His legs stretched out, holding your side and trying to bring you back. You laughed, licking around his hard cock, letting your teeth skim his tip, his hips jumping making your dad even more confused.</p><p>\u201cAfter that put the chip back into the wrist opening-\u201c Tony went on, Peters hand shaking as he tried to take notes as you blowed him. Your head bobbed, one hand holding his hips down and the other massaging his balls. Peter whined once more as you retracted, your lips from his length, your finger tapping his tip.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that Pete?\u201d Tony asked.</p><p>\u201cN-Nothin, just clearing my throat, keep going.\u201d Tony hummed continuing on. You could see the veins on his length bulging and his head swollen, pre-cum leaking. You continued to take small kitten licks, trying your best to trigger him and get him to notice you. Peter tried wrapping his hand around his shaft to get some friction, but you quickly slapped it away, making him look down at you with shock.</p><p>\u201cIs everything alright?\u201d Tony asked looking at Peter suspiciously. Peter was biting his bottom lip, trying his best to keep in the loud moan that\u2019s banging against his mouth. \u201cPeter you there?\u201d Tony asked once more. You sucked him harshly. Peter dropped his forehead on the table holding the arms of the chair tightly. \u201cPete?\u201d Tony was getting worried. Peter picked his head back up, you were getting him close to his high, but you were still teasing, and Peter had enough.</p><p>\u201cYes- I have to <i>fuck</i>- I have to go right now!\u201d Before Tony could answer Peter hung up the call. Pushing his chair back and grabbing your wrists pulling you up quickly. \u201cWhat the fuck-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t talked to me all week.\u201d You said as Peter quickly pulled your shirt off, unclasping your bra.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t give you the right to suck me off when I\u2019m talking to Mr. Stark aka YOUR DAD-\u201c Peters lips attached to your breast, pushing you back against the desk. You moaned, your hands tangled in his curls. Peter held your waist as he sucked and nibbled on your nipple.</p><p>\u201cI <i>ohhh</i>- I needed your attention- talking wasn\u2019t gonna- <i>fuck</i>\u201d You moaned feeling Peters hand inside your shorts and panties, rubbing your clit. Peter let his finger dip between your folds, your wetness already leaking out.</p><p>\u201cOh fuck baby- your so wet right now just by sucking me off.\u201d Peter said lips against your breast. He went back to sucking your breasts, leaving multiple hickies. He let two fingers go inside you, curling them as he began to pump, you held his shoulders, standing on your tiptoes.</p><p>\u201cPeter-P-please.\u201d You moaned, Peter could feel your walls clenching around his fingers. Before you could reach your high, he pulled them out and he didn\u2019t give you time to complain, already attaching his lips to yours. He licked your lips, pulling away so he could suck his fingers clean. You watched with wide eyes, your core clenching around nothing.</p><p>\u201cTaste so good babe.\u201d Peter said, his hands hooking around the wasteband of your shorts and panties and pulling them down, he lifted you up, sitting you on the desk, and pulled your shorts and panties completely off. You tugged on his shirt, making him take it off. He went back to kissing you, one hand holding the back of your neck, and the other rubbing your clit. You moaned into his mouth. Peter moved closer between your legs, his cock still out and hard.</p><p>\u201cPeter-I need you!\u201d You moaned again, almost whimpering now, the feeling of your core pulsing was too much.</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna be a good girl?\u201d Peter said kissing below your ear, making you moan.</p><p>\u201cY-Yes <i>fucking hell </i>Pete, I need you inside now!\u201d You were moaning so much and your wettness was leaking.</p><p>\u201cKeep begging baby, tell me how much you need it.\u201d He said rubbing your clit harshly, your mouth fell open.</p><p>\u201cP-Peter I need this- I need your cock inside me, I need you fucking me right now, please Peter, I have to feel you!\u201d You were whining and bucking your hips up for some friction. Peter couldn\u2019t help the smirk on his face, capturing your lips in his, his tongue forcing your mouth open. His hand wrapped around his cock, pumping a few times, he then rubbed his head on your clit making you moan into his mouth. \u201cP-Peter, pleas-\u201c Your head fell back, Peter going fully inside.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Peter said, bringing his hips out then snapping them back in. One hand had a firm grib on his shoulder the other was behind you keeping your balance and Peter picked up speed. \u201cIs- <i>uhhh</i>- is this what you wanted baby- <i>fuck</i>- my full attention!\u201d Peter was moaning as he drove his cock inside you. You were whimpering and cursing.</p><p>\u201cYes- so good Pete- make me feel so good!\u201d You moaned, arching your back a little. Peters eyes looked over your features, the sweat on your forehead and chest, your mouth open slightly moaning his name, your breasts moving fast with each thrust, Peter felt himself twitch inside you.</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me your on the pill baby- <i>fuck</i>- I needa cum inside you!\u201d Peter said breathlessly, picking up the speed.</p><p>\u201cY-Yea I am- shit P! Faster!\u201d You were crying out, Peter being really rough. You moaned as he nipped at your neck. Your walls squeezed his length, Peter could feel you dripping, which made him grunt louder.</p><p>\u201cCmon y/n- come on my cock baby.\u201d Peter said. You were tugging the back of his hair, as you chased your high.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s y/n?\u201d Steve asked Nat.</p><p>\u201cProbably the lab, she went to check up on Peter.\u201d Nat said.</p><p>\u201cOk, she hasn\u2019t been answering her calls so I\u2019m just gonna see if she\u2019s up for a quick mission.\u201d Steve said, heading down the hall, and down the short stairs.</p><p>However when he tried to open the lab door he found out it was locked.</p><p>\u201cSorry Captain Rogers, you would not wish to see that.\u201d FRIDAY said</p><p>\u201cHuh? Why don\u2019t I wish to see what?\u201d Steve asked confused.</p><p>\u201cMr. Parker and Ms. Stark having sexual intercourse.\u201d FRIDAY said, making Steve choke on the air.</p><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSexual intercourse is when a male and-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI know what sexual intercourse is FRIDAY!\u201d Steve shook his head, jogging back up the stairs. He didn\u2019t know there was a protocol for when people have sex. Tony really was cautious.</p><p>Peter came with a loud moan, his head dropping on your shoulder, his cum shooting inside you. He stayed there for a bit, letting the feeling of your hands in his hair calm him down. His hands held your waist, moving up to cup your breasts making you laugh lightly, his hands moved to your sides, finally picking up his head and kissing your cheek.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I should\u2019ve given you more attention, it\u2019s just Mr. Stark needed my help and I just- I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He said softly, making you smile.</p><p>\u201cYour fine, this didn\u2019t make it up tho, it did by a little, because you promised we\u2019d make pancakes together.\u201d You said, sounding like a baby. Peter smiled, kissing your nose.</p><p>\u201cYea I\u2019ll make the pancakes while you burn them.\u201d He teased</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t burn all of them!\u201d You said, Peter laughed, kissing your lips.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get changed, probably shower too, then we can make late night pancakes, how does that sound?\u201d Peter said, fixing your hair.</p><p>\u201cSounds splendid.\u201d You smiled brightly making him laugh. Peter pulled out- forgetting about the mess. \u201cPeter!\u201d You said, looking at the mix of your cum between your legs and on the table. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d You said looking up at Peter, who had a smirk on his face. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin.\u201d He said going over to the sink and grabbing a towel and crouching down between your legs. His eyes lingered, making you raise a brow.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it Peter?\u201d You said pushing him more.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d He was still looking at your pussy.</p><p>\u201cPeter-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou just look really fucking hot right now with my cum leaking out of you and yours also dripping down your legs and your body fucked out and your swollen clit and I really wanna take a picture.\u201d Peter talked fast, but you got it all, making you laugh.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead.\u201d You said, making Peters eyes finally look away from your pussy and in your eyes.</p><p>\u201cReally?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYea, just don\u2019t go leaking it everywhere, I don\u2019t need that.\u201d You said.</p><p>\u201cYea-No of course- I\u2019d never want anyone to see my baby like this.\u201d He grabbed his phone from the chair beside him, standing in front of you, still naked, and taking a picture. He took about two or three, finally putting it away.</p><p>\u201cYour such a dork.\u201d You teased as Peter cleaned you up.</p><p>\u201cYea but this dork really fucks you well.\u201d Peter said laughing.</p><p>\u201cOh definitely!\u201d You said making it sound sarcastic.</p><p>\u201cWe can go again right now!\u201d Peter said, puffing up.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t think you can handle that.\u201d You said putting your clothes on. Peters mouth was open in shock.</p><p>\u201cWhat! I can\u2019t handle it?!!! Oh baby your really in for it-\u201c his mouth fell open when you pressed your body against him, rubbing his cock on your lower half.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Your fingers lightly slid against his length, tapping on the head. His cock slowly started to harden. You went down to your knees slowly, stroking Peter a little more, however instead you pulled up his boxers and jeans, zipping it for him .</p><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d Peter said, his cock hard.</p><p>\u201cWe gotta get out of here.\u201d You said, pulling his hand and leading him to the exit.</p><p>\u201cWhyyyyy, you made me hard again, I need to be inside you right now-\u201c Peter chokes on his words when you opened the lab door and there stood Tony.</p><p>\u201cDad-\u201c</p><p>\u201cIt had to be the lab- it couldn\u2019t be your room, his room, the fucking gaming room, it had to be the lab?!\u201d Tony was fuming.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know-\u201c Tony held a hand up, shutting you up.</p><p>\u201cSave it, anytime FRIDAY activates <i>that</i> protocol I get notified, who\u2019s doing it and where there doing it- and you two teenagers, did it in my fucking lab! Where there\u2019s a rule! And you totally fucked up that rule with ur bodies up against my equipment! O god please tell me you didn\u2019t do it on the desk.\u201d Tony said , only two have you and Peter avoid eye contact with him. \u201cI\u2019m gonna pass out.\u201d Tony rubbed his temples.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry Mr. Stark-\u201c Tony stooped Peter this time.</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m suppose to be in a meeting right now, but you were acting weirder than usual on our call and I thought something was wrong, clearly now I understand what happened!\u201d Tony said .</p><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYea oh, I swear to god you both better run right now, or you\u2019ll both be dead.\u201d He said, and you and Peter didn\u2019t waste anytime. Tony was left alone in seconds.</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>Permanent Taglist: @roonyxx @saturn-aka-six @twinsofia @sassyhollandx <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mceV-_Fx1q52-TjBCbwABLw\">@peterparkour</a></p>",

Steve quickly came to your side, but you jumped back up with a huge smile. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2026okay?\u201d He asked a little confused, that your smiling after falling.</p><p>\u201cYea, amazing actually, I needa clean this blood off me fast!\u201d you said, walking quickly into the compound, Steve looking back up at the quinjet to a similarly confused bucky, then went following you.</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna tell me why your so happy?\u201d Steve said catching up to you. You turned around, your hands on his shoulders, smiling brightly at him. </p><p>\u201cMay\u2019s visiting her friends in Georgia and Peter has school so he can\u2019t go, and Dad said that he can stay over for the week, and he said he\u2019s gonna be here right after our mission so now I have to shower before he comes!\u201d You said now running off to your quarter. Steve rolled his eyes, a small smile on his face though seeing you so happy. </p><p>-</p><p>Peter walked into the common room, the first thing on his mind was to see you, however he ran into Tony. </p><p>\u201cHey kid, I need your help with something if you don\u2019t mind?\u201d Tony said, not really asking more telling.</p><p>\u201cYes of course, what about my bags-\u201d</p><p>\u201cCap you don\u2019t mind taking these to the kids room.\u201d He took Peters bag putting them by the door. </p><p>\u201cActually-\u201d But Tony left before Steve could say anything. Rolling his eyes Steve picked up the bags and took them to Peter\u2019s room. </p>[[MORE]]<p>-</p><p>You quickly slipped on one of Peter\u2019s shorts and Bucky\u2019s T-shirt, and walked to Peter\u2019s room. You were confused when you only saw his bags there, but decided to check the common room to see if he was waiting for you. Your face fell when you didn\u2019t see him there sitting with everyone else. </p><p>\u201cNat do you know where Parker is?\u201d You asked. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in the lab, with your dad.\u201d She answered, focused on the movie. </p><p>\u201cK thanks!\u201d You jogged down to the lab, your face lighting up when you saw Peters concentrated face. You opened the lab door, your dads head perking up, his brows furrowing. </p><p>\u201cNonononononono, you know the rules.\u201d He said, making your face fall. Peter\u2019s head lifted up, raising his mask to give you a smile. </p><p>\u201c i just wanna say hi to Peter-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDad-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shorts when we\u2019re working with chemicals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you shitting me?\u201d You asked annoyed. </p><p>\u201cOut. Now.\u201d You huffed, stomping out of the lab back up to the common room. </p><p>\u201cWas he there?\u201d Nat asked when she saw you. You didn\u2019t answer only sitting next to her, grabbing the popcorn. Nat didn\u2019t say anything only, sharing her blanket with you, and letting you rest next to her. </p><p>It wasn\u2019t until 3 am, that Peter and Tony finished. Peter yawned as he walked into the common room, a soft smile on his face when he saw you sleeping on the couch. He knew you were tired so he just went to his room and got into bed. </p><p>This happened all week, Peter would wake up early, grab an apple for breakfast and go down to the lab with your dad, they spent the whole day there, and they\u2019d finish in the middle of the night. Everyone could see how annoyed you got, especially Steve considering how happy you were when he said he\u2019d be staying all week. You tried everything to get his attention. You\u2019d go into his room, to sleep next to him, you\u2019d try bringing him snacks, try giving him kisses, but nothing, he was too caught up with your dad. So you were obviously happy when your dad had to go to Chicago for a business thing. </p><p>You were surprised and annoyed that you hadn\u2019t seen Peter all day considering your dad left last night. You made your way down to the lab, only to find Peter sitting on the desk, writing equations and solutions down as Tony talked on the blue screen in front of him. </p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d You said crossing your arms. </p><p>\u201cNot right now y/n.\u201d He said not even looking up. You bit your lip looking up and down at Peter, an idea popping in your head. At this point you didn\u2019t care if your dad was chatting with Peter, you needed his attention. And talking definitely wouldn\u2019t do anything. You quickly ducked down, crawling quietly under the table. Peters leg was tapping on the ground as he took notes. You could hear him asking your dad questions, but at this point you wanted him to choke on his words, and that\u2019s exactly what he did.</p><p>You didn\u2019t bother teasing him, your hand already palming his cock. Peter choked on his words, making Tony raise his brows. Peter quickly said nothing and moved his chair back a little to see you unbuttoning his jeans.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m busy.\u201d He said strictly, his jaw clenched making you look up at him with a smirk, not even noticing that he lifted his hips up slightly to allow you to pull his jeans and boxers down.</p><p>\u201cDoes your cock always get hard when your \u2018busy\u2019 Pete.\u201d You said biting your lip when his cock sprang free. Peter was going to say something until your dad spoke up.</p><p>\u201cEverything alright Parker?\u201d Peters head snapped up.</p><p>\u201cYeayea keep g-<i>shit</i>!- sorry um keep going Mr. Stark.\u201d Tony looked at Peter for a second, brushing it off and continuing his talk. However Peter wasn\u2019t focused on that. All he could feel was your lips around him, your tongue swirling around his head, your hands massaging his balls. He whimpered slightly, covering his mouth as he leaned on the table to hide the noise. You hummed around him, pulling out making his cock twitch. You smiled seeing the pre-cum but you were still bothered that you weren\u2019t having his full attention.</p><p>You kissed his tip, blowing cold air on it making Peter move in his chair is cock now fully standing. His legs stretched out, holding your side and trying to bring you back. You laughed, licking around his hard cock, letting your teeth skim his tip, his hips jumping making your dad even more confused.</p><p>\u201cAfter that put the chip back into the wrist opening-\u201c Tony went on, Peters hand shaking as he tried to take notes as you blowed him. Your head bobbed, one hand holding his hips down and the other massaging his balls. Peter whined once more as you retracted, your lips from his length, your finger tapping his tip.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that Pete?\u201d Tony asked.</p><p>\u201cN-Nothin, just clearing my throat, keep going.\u201d Tony hummed continuing on. You could see the veins on his length bulging and his head swollen, pre-cum leaking. You continued to take small kitten licks, trying your best to trigger him and get him to notice you. Peter tried wrapping his hand around his shaft to get some friction, but you quickly slapped it away, making him look down at you with shock.</p><p>\u201cIs everything alright?\u201d Tony asked looking at Peter suspiciously. Peter was biting his bottom lip, trying his best to keep in the loud moan that\u2019s banging against his mouth. \u201cPeter you there?\u201d Tony asked once more. You sucked him harshly. Peter dropped his forehead on the table holding the arms of the chair tightly. \u201cPete?\u201d Tony was getting worried. Peter picked his head back up, you were getting him close to his high, but you were still teasing, and Peter had enough.</p><p>\u201cYes- I have to <i>fuck</i>- I have to go right now!\u201d Before Tony could answer Peter hung up the call. Pushing his chair back and grabbing your wrists pulling you up quickly. \u201cWhat the fuck-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t talked to me all week.\u201d You said as Peter quickly pulled your shirt off, unclasping your bra.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t give you the right to suck me off when I\u2019m talking to Mr. Stark aka YOUR DAD-\u201c Peters lips attached to your breast, pushing you back against the desk. You moaned, your hands tangled in his curls. Peter held your waist as he sucked and nibbled on your nipple.</p><p>\u201cI <i>ohhh</i>- I needed your attention- talking wasn\u2019t gonna- <i>fuck</i>\u201d You moaned feeling Peters hand inside your shorts and panties, rubbing your clit. Peter let his finger dip between your folds, your wetness already leaking out.</p><p>\u201cOh fuck baby- your so wet right now just by sucking me off.\u201d Peter said lips against your breast. He went back to sucking your breasts, leaving multiple hickies. He let two fingers go inside you, curling them as he began to pump, you held his shoulders, standing on your tiptoes.</p><p>\u201cPeter-P-please.\u201d You moaned, Peter could feel your walls clenching around his fingers. Before you could reach your high, he pulled them out and he didn\u2019t give you time to complain, already attaching his lips to yours. He licked your lips, pulling away so he could suck his fingers clean. You watched with wide eyes, your core clenching around nothing.</p><p>\u201cTaste so good babe.\u201d Peter said, his hands hooking around the wasteband of your shorts and panties and pulling them down, he lifted you up, sitting you on the desk, and pulled your shorts and panties completely off. You tugged on his shirt, making him take it off. He went back to kissing you, one hand holding the back of your neck, and the other rubbing your clit. You moaned into his mouth. Peter moved closer between your legs, his cock still out and hard.</p><p>\u201cPeter-I need you!\u201d You moaned again, almost whimpering now, the feeling of your core pulsing was too much.</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna be a good girl?\u201d Peter said kissing below your ear, making you moan.</p><p>\u201cY-Yes <i>fucking hell </i>Pete, I need you inside now!\u201d You were moaning so much and your wettness was leaking.</p><p>\u201cKeep begging baby, tell me how much you need it.\u201d He said rubbing your clit harshly, your mouth fell open.</p><p>\u201cP-Peter I need this- I need your cock inside me, I need you fucking me right now, please Peter, I have to feel you!\u201d You were whining and bucking your hips up for some friction. Peter couldn\u2019t help the smirk on his face, capturing your lips in his, his tongue forcing your mouth open. His hand wrapped around his cock, pumping a few times, he then rubbed his head on your clit making you moan into his mouth. \u201cP-Peter, pleas-\u201c Your head fell back, Peter going fully inside.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Peter said, bringing his hips out then snapping them back in. One hand had a firm grib on his shoulder the other was behind you keeping your balance and Peter picked up speed. \u201cIs- <i>uhhh</i>- is this what you wanted baby- <i>fuck</i>- my full attention!\u201d Peter was moaning as he drove his cock inside you. You were whimpering and cursing.</p><p>\u201cYes- so good Pete- make me feel so good!\u201d You moaned, arching your back a little. Peters eyes looked over your features, the sweat on your forehead and chest, your mouth open slightly moaning his name, your breasts moving fast with each thrust, Peter felt himself twitch inside you.</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me your on the pill baby- <i>fuck</i>- I needa cum inside you!\u201d Peter said breathlessly, picking up the speed.</p><p>\u201cY-Yea I am- shit P! Faster!\u201d You were crying out, Peter being really rough. You moaned as he nipped at your neck. Your walls squeezed his length, Peter could feel you dripping, which made him grunt louder.</p><p>\u201cCmon y/n- come on my cock baby.\u201d Peter said. You were tugging the back of his hair, as you chased your high.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s y/n?\u201d Steve asked Nat.</p><p>\u201cProbably the lab, she went to check up on Peter.\u201d Nat said.</p><p>\u201cOk, she hasn\u2019t been answering her calls so I\u2019m just gonna see if she\u2019s up for a quick mission.\u201d Steve said, heading down the hall, and down the short stairs.</p><p>However when he tried to open the lab door he found out it was locked.</p><p>\u201cSorry Captain Rogers, you would not wish to see that.\u201d FRIDAY said</p><p>\u201cHuh? Why don\u2019t I wish to see what?\u201d Steve asked confused.</p><p>\u201cMr. Parker and Ms. Stark having sexual intercourse.\u201d FRIDAY said, making Steve choke on the air.</p><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSexual intercourse is when a male and-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI know what sexual intercourse is FRIDAY!\u201d Steve shook his head, jogging back up the stairs. He didn\u2019t know there was a protocol for when people have sex. Tony really was cautious.</p><p>Peter came with a loud moan, his head dropping on your shoulder, his cum shooting inside you. He stayed there for a bit, letting the feeling of your hands in his hair calm him down. His hands held your waist, moving up to cup your breasts making you laugh lightly, his hands moved to your sides, finally picking up his head and kissing your cheek.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I should\u2019ve given you more attention, it\u2019s just Mr. Stark needed my help and I just- I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He said softly, making you smile.</p><p>\u201cYour fine, this didn\u2019t make it up tho, it did by a little, because you promised we\u2019d make pancakes together.\u201d You said, sounding like a baby. Peter smiled, kissing your nose.</p><p>\u201cYea I\u2019ll make the pancakes while you burn them.\u201d He teased</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t burn all of them!\u201d You said, Peter laughed, kissing your lips.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get changed, probably shower too, then we can make late night pancakes, how does that sound?\u201d Peter said, fixing your hair.</p><p>\u201cSounds splendid.\u201d You smiled brightly making him laugh. Peter pulled out- forgetting about the mess. \u201cPeter!\u201d You said, looking at the mix of your cum between your legs and on the table. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d You said looking up at Peter, who had a smirk on his face. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin.\u201d He said going over to the sink and grabbing a towel and crouching down between your legs. His eyes lingered, making you raise a brow.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it Peter?\u201d You said pushing him more.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d He was still looking at your pussy.</p><p>\u201cPeter-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou just look really fucking hot right now with my cum leaking out of you and yours also dripping down your legs and your body fucked out and your swollen clit and I really wanna take a picture.\u201d Peter talked fast, but you got it all, making you laugh.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead.\u201d You said, making Peters eyes finally look away from your pussy and in your eyes.</p><p>\u201cReally?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYea, just don\u2019t go leaking it everywhere, I don\u2019t need that.\u201d You said.</p><p>\u201cYea-No of course- I\u2019d never want anyone to see my baby like this.\u201d He grabbed his phone from the chair beside him, standing in front of you, still naked, and taking a picture. He took about two or three, finally putting it away.</p><p>\u201cYour such a dork.\u201d You teased as Peter cleaned you up.</p><p>\u201cYea but this dork really fucks you well.\u201d Peter said laughing.</p><p>\u201cOh definitely!\u201d You said making it sound sarcastic.</p><p>\u201cWe can go again right now!\u201d Peter said, puffing up.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t think you can handle that.\u201d You said putting your clothes on. Peters mouth was open in shock.</p><p>\u201cWhat! I can\u2019t handle it?!!! Oh baby your really in for it-\u201c his mouth fell open when you pressed your body against him, rubbing his cock on your lower half.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Your fingers lightly slid against his length, tapping on the head. His cock slowly started to harden. You went down to your knees slowly, stroking Peter a little more, however instead you pulled up his boxers and jeans, zipping it for him .</p><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d Peter said, his cock hard.</p><p>\u201cWe gotta get out of here.\u201d You said, pulling his hand and leading him to the exit.</p><p>\u201cWhyyyyy, you made me hard again, I need to be inside you right now-\u201c Peter chokes on his words when you opened the lab door and there stood Tony.</p><p>\u201cDad-\u201c</p><p>\u201cIt had to be the lab- it couldn\u2019t be your room, his room, the fucking gaming room, it had to be the lab?!\u201d Tony was fuming.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know-\u201c Tony held a hand up, shutting you up.</p><p>\u201cSave it, anytime FRIDAY activates <i>that</i> protocol I get notified, who\u2019s doing it and where there doing it- and you two teenagers, did it in my fucking lab! Where there\u2019s a rule! And you totally fucked up that rule with ur bodies up against my equipment! O god please tell me you didn\u2019t do it on the desk.\u201d Tony said , only two have you and Peter avoid eye contact with him. \u201cI\u2019m gonna pass out.\u201d Tony rubbed his temples.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry Mr. Stark-\u201c Tony stooped Peter this time.</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m suppose to be in a meeting right now, but you were acting weirder than usual on our call and I thought something was wrong, clearly now I understand what happened!\u201d Tony said .</p><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYea oh, I swear to god you both better run right now, or you\u2019ll both be dead.\u201d He said, and you and Peter didn\u2019t waste anytime. Tony was left alone in seconds.</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>Permanent Taglist: @roonyxx @saturn-aka-six @twinsofia @sassyhollandx <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mceV-_Fx1q52-TjBCbwABLw\">@peterparkour</a></p>",

Steve quickly came to your side, but you jumped back up with a huge smile. </p><p>&ldquo;You&hellip;okay?&rdquo; He asked a little confused, that your smiling after falling.</p><p>&ldquo;Yea, amazing actually, I needa clean this blood off me fast!&rdquo; you said, walking quickly into the compound, Steve looking back up at the quinjet to a similarly confused bucky, then went following you.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you gonna tell me why your so happy?&rdquo; Steve said catching up to you. You turned around, your hands on his shoulders, smiling brightly at him. </p><p>&ldquo;May&rsquo;s visiting her friends in Georgia and Peter has school so he can&rsquo;t go, and Dad said that he can stay over for the week, and he said he&rsquo;s gonna be here right after our mission so now I have to shower before he comes!&rdquo; You said now running off to your quarter. Steve rolled his eyes, a small smile on his face though seeing you so happy. </p><p>-</p><p>Peter walked into the common room, the first thing on his mind was to see you, however he ran into Tony. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey kid, I need your help with something if you don&rsquo;t mind?&rdquo; Tony said, not really asking more telling.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes of course, what about my bags-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cap you don&rsquo;t mind taking these to the kids room.&rdquo; He took Peters bag putting them by the door. </p><p>&ldquo;Actually-&rdquo; But Tony left before Steve could say anything. Rolling his eyes Steve picked up the bags and took them to Peter&rsquo;s room. </p><p>-</p><p>You quickly slipped on one of Peter&rsquo;s shorts and Bucky&rsquo;s T-shirt, and walked to Peter&rsquo;s room. You were confused when you only saw his bags there, but decided to check the common room to see if he was waiting for you. Your face fell when you didn&rsquo;t see him there sitting with everyone else. </p><p>&ldquo;Nat do you know where Parker is?&rdquo; You asked. </p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in the lab, with your dad.&rdquo; She answered, focused on the movie. </p><p>&ldquo;K thanks!&rdquo; You jogged down to the lab, your face lighting up when you saw Peters concentrated face. You opened the lab door, your dads head perking up, his brows furrowing. </p><p>&ldquo;Nonononononono, you know the rules.&rdquo; He said, making your face fall. Peter&rsquo;s head lifted up, raising his mask to give you a smile. </p><p>&ldquo; i just wanna say hi to Peter-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Dad-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No shorts when we&rsquo;re working with chemicals.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you shitting me?&rdquo; You asked annoyed. </p><p>&ldquo;Out. Now.&rdquo; You huffed, stomping out of the lab back up to the common room. </p><p>&ldquo;Was he there?&rdquo; Nat asked when she saw you. You didn&rsquo;t answer only sitting next to her, grabbing the popcorn. Nat didn&rsquo;t say anything only, sharing her blanket with you, and letting you rest next to her. </p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t until 3 am, that Peter and Tony finished. Peter yawned as he walked into the common room, a soft smile on his face when he saw you sleeping on the couch. He knew you were tired so he just went to his room and got into bed. </p><p>This happened all week, Peter would wake up early, grab an apple for breakfast and go down to the lab with your dad, they spent the whole day there, and they&rsquo;d finish in the middle of the night. Everyone could see how annoyed you got, especially Steve considering how happy you were when he said he&rsquo;d be staying all week. You tried everything to get his attention. You&rsquo;d go into his room, to sleep next to him, you&rsquo;d try bringing him snacks, try giving him kisses, but nothing, he was too caught up with your dad. So you were obviously happy when your dad had to go to Chicago for a business thing. </p><p>You were surprised and annoyed that you hadn&rsquo;t seen Peter all day considering your dad left last night. You made your way down to the lab, only to find Peter sitting on the desk, writing equations and solutions down as Tony talked on the blue screen in front of him. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you serious?&rdquo; You said crossing your arms. </p><p>&ldquo;Not right now y/n.&rdquo; He said not even looking up. You bit your lip looking up and down at Peter, an idea popping in your head. At this point you didn&rsquo;t care if your dad was chatting with Peter, you needed his attention. And talking definitely wouldn&rsquo;t do anything. You quickly ducked down, crawling quietly under the table. Peters leg was tapping on the ground as he took notes. You could hear him asking your dad questions, but at this point you wanted him to choke on his words, and that&rsquo;s exactly what he did.</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t bother teasing him, your hand already palming his cock. Peter choked on his words, making Tony raise his brows. Peter quickly said nothing and moved his chair back a little to see you unbuttoning his jeans.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m busy.&rdquo; He said strictly, his jaw clenched making you look up at him with a smirk, not even noticing that he lifted his hips up slightly to allow you to pull his jeans and boxers down.</p><p>&ldquo;Does your cock always get hard when your &lsquo;busy&rsquo; Pete.&rdquo; You said biting your lip when his cock sprang free. Peter was going to say something until your dad spoke up.</p><p>&ldquo;Everything alright Parker?&rdquo; Peters head snapped up.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeayea keep g-<i>shit</i>!- sorry um keep going Mr. Stark.&rdquo; Tony looked at Peter for a second, brushing it off and continuing his talk. However Peter wasn&rsquo;t focused on that. All he could feel was your lips around him, your tongue swirling around his head, your hands massaging his balls. He whimpered slightly, covering his mouth as he leaned on the table to hide the noise. You hummed around him, pulling out making his cock twitch. You smiled seeing the pre-cum but you were still bothered that you weren&rsquo;t having his full attention.</p><p>You kissed his tip, blowing cold air on it making Peter move in his chair is cock now fully standing. His legs stretched out, holding your side and trying to bring you back. You laughed, licking around his hard cock, letting your teeth skim his tip, his hips jumping making your dad even more confused.</p><p>&ldquo;After that put the chip back into the wrist opening-&ldquo; Tony went on, Peters hand shaking as he tried to take notes as you blowed him. Your head bobbed, one hand holding his hips down and the other massaging his balls. Peter whined once more as you retracted, your lips from his length, your finger tapping his tip.</p><p>&ldquo;What was that Pete?&rdquo; Tony asked.</p><p>&ldquo;N-Nothin, just clearing my throat, keep going.&rdquo; Tony hummed continuing on. You could see the veins on his length bulging and his head swollen, pre-cum leaking. You continued to take small kitten licks, trying your best to trigger him and get him to notice you. Peter tried wrapping his hand around his shaft to get some friction, but you quickly slapped it away, making him look down at you with shock.</p><p>&ldquo;Is everything alright?&rdquo; Tony asked looking at Peter suspiciously. Peter was biting his bottom lip, trying his best to keep in the loud moan that&rsquo;s banging against his mouth. &ldquo;Peter you there?&rdquo; Tony asked once more. You sucked him harshly. Peter dropped his forehead on the table holding the arms of the chair tightly. &ldquo;Pete?&rdquo; Tony was getting worried. Peter picked his head back up, you were getting him close to his high, but you were still teasing, and Peter had enough.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes- I have to <i>fuck</i>- I have to go right now!&rdquo; Before Tony could answer Peter hung up the call. Pushing his chair back and grabbing your wrists pulling you up quickly. &ldquo;What the fuck-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t talked to me all week.&rdquo; You said as Peter quickly pulled your shirt off, unclasping your bra.</p><p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t give you the right to suck me off when I&rsquo;m talking to Mr. Stark aka YOUR DAD-&ldquo; Peters lips attached to your breast, pushing you back against the desk. You moaned, your hands tangled in his curls.

You tugged on his shirt, making him take it off. He went back to kissing you, one hand holding the back of your neck, and the other rubbing your clit. You moaned into his mouth. Peter moved closer between your legs, his cock still out and hard.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter-I need you!&rdquo; You moaned again, almost whimpering now, the feeling of your core pulsing was too much.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you gonna be a good girl?&rdquo; Peter said kissing below your ear, making you moan.</p><p>&ldquo;Y-Yes <i>fucking hell </i>Pete, I need you inside now!&rdquo; You were moaning so much and your wettness was leaking.</p><p>&ldquo;Keep begging baby, tell me how much you need it.&rdquo; He said rubbing your clit harshly, your mouth fell open.</p><p>&ldquo;P-Peter I need this- I need your cock inside me, I need you fucking me right now, please Peter, I have to feel you!&rdquo; You were whining and bucking your hips up for some friction.

You were whimpering and cursing.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes- so good Pete- make me feel so good!&rdquo; You moaned, arching your back a little. Peters eyes looked over your features, the sweat on your forehead and chest, your mouth open slightly moaning his name, your breasts moving fast with each thrust, Peter felt himself twitch inside you.</p><p>&ldquo;Please tell me your on the pill baby- <i>fuck</i>- I needa cum inside you!&rdquo; Peter said breathlessly, picking up the speed.</p><p>&ldquo;Y-Yea I am- shit P! Faster!&rdquo; You were crying out, Peter being really rough. You moaned as he nipped at your neck. Your walls squeezed his length, Peter could feel you dripping, which made him grunt louder.</p><p>&ldquo;Cmon y/n- come on my cock baby.&rdquo; Peter said. You were tugging the back of his hair, as you chased your high.</p><p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s y/n?&rdquo; Steve asked Nat.</p><p>&ldquo;Probably the lab, she went to check up on Peter.&rdquo; Nat said.</p><p>&ldquo;Ok, she hasn&rsquo;t been answering her calls so I&rsquo;m just gonna see if she&rsquo;s up for a quick mission.&rdquo; Steve said, heading down the hall, and down the short stairs.</p><p>However when he tried to open the lab door he found out it was locked.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry Captain Rogers, you would not wish to see that.&rdquo; FRIDAY said</p><p>&ldquo;Huh?

He took about two or three, finally putting it away.</p><p>&ldquo;Your such a dork.&rdquo; You teased as Peter cleaned you up.</p><p>&ldquo;Yea but this dork really fucks you well.&rdquo; Peter said laughing.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh definitely!&rdquo; You said making it sound sarcastic.</p><p>&ldquo;We can go again right now!&rdquo; Peter said, puffing up.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t think you can handle that.&rdquo; You said putting your clothes on.

O god please tell me you didn&rsquo;t do it on the desk.&rdquo; Tony said , only two have you and Peter avoid eye contact with him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna pass out.&rdquo; Tony rubbed his temples.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry Mr. Stark-&ldquo; Tony stooped Peter this time.</p><p>&ldquo;You know I&rsquo;m suppose to be in a meeting right now, but you were acting weirder than usual on our call and I thought something was wrong, clearly now I understand what happened!&rdquo; Tony said .</p><p>&ldquo;Oh&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yea oh, I swear to god you both better run right now, or you&rsquo;ll both be dead.&rdquo; He said, and you and Peter didn&rsquo;t waste anytime.

You heard quick footsteps across your bedroom. &ldquo;Wake up!&rdquo; Of course it was Peter. Rolling over onto your stomach, you buried your face into your pillows. You almost felt embarrassed once you remembered you only had on a t-shirt and underwear but you were too sleepy to move again. You felt the mattress shift and you knew that the way too giddy boy had climbed onto the the bed with you. You took a sharp inhale when you felt a pillow come down on your ass. &ldquo;Its 11 o clock! Get up you bum!&rdquo; Peter exclaimed before hitting you again. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a whole new breed of annoying&rdquo; you groaned, finally sitting up. Wincing as you opened your eyes, you couldn&rsquo;t help but crack a smile at your best friend. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a whole new breed of man&rdquo; he replied and you rolled your eyes. &ldquo;You should&rsquo;ve been spider-boy&rdquo; you reiterated\u00a0 for the thousandth time. &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you let me be great? Anyways- what do you want to eat though, I&rsquo;m gonna order some food&quot;\u00a0 You thought about what you wanted and Peter plopped down next to you.\u00a0 He grabbed the remote to your T.V, without asking as usual and began scrolling through HBO. &quot;Let&rsquo;s watch Westworld, I&rsquo;ve been wanting to start that for a while&hellip;&rdquo; he trailed off,\u00a0 turning his head to look at you. He stopped to admire you, so pretty even when you just woke up. Your hair was up in a ponytail, lips and cheeks a little puffy still from sleep. You wore an old Ramones t-shirt of his that he&rsquo;d given you after he shrunk it in the wash. He loved the way you looked in it. He loved the way you looked period. He didn&rsquo;t have a crush on you on you or anything though. You were his best friend. He just thought you were beautiful, smart, funny, and wanted to be around you all the time. That wasn&rsquo;t a crush was it? </p><p><br/></p><p>He was pulled from his thoughts by the sound of your voice. &ldquo;Lets get Alfredo. Shrimp or chicken though? Or maybe crab if you&rsquo;re feeling extravagant.&rdquo; He only partially heard what you said. &ldquo;You want crab legs? That&rsquo;s so much work to eat.&rdquo; &ldquo;Peter you weren&rsquo;t even listening to me! Never mind just order some pizza.&rdquo; Peter felt a little bad for not listening but how could he focus when you looked like you did. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry! I&rsquo;ll order, Leonardi&rsquo;s?&rdquo; You gave him a look and he picked up his phone. &ldquo;Hi, Peter Parker placing an order for a pepperoni pizza&rdquo;. You burst out laughing and he smiled before shushing you. You placed a hand over your mouth to try and keep quiet. &ldquo;Do I, Peter Parker want my Pepperoni pizza for pick up -no delivery please. No, this is not a prank call. 223 Myrtle Avenue. 1 hour? Thank you!&rdquo; You removed your hand and let your laughs flow freely. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a joke - oh my god, that was damn near a tongue twister&rdquo;. Peter began laughing with you, his hand finding a place on your upper thigh. &ldquo;Ooo you finally shaved your legs&rdquo; &ldquo;Shut Up! I had to, I went on a date&rdquo;. Peter leaned away from you with a shocked face, &ldquo;You what?!&rdquo; &ldquo;Why is it so shocking that I went on a date? But yes, I did. Remember that guy we ran into at the train station - Nathan? It was actually really nice&rdquo; You stared at your friend and waited for him to respond. &ldquo;Did you have a sex with him?&rdquo; </p><p><br/></p><p>Your eyebrows rose up almost to your hairline, &ldquo;Why is that your first question&rdquo;. You stood up and fixed your underwear, sliding your feet into your fluffy slippers. &ldquo;Well, you shaved your legs so I assume it&rsquo;s because you intended to fuck him&rdquo;. You nearly choked on your on spit, &ldquo;Jeez Peter, and no I didn&rsquo;t have sex with him. He just went down on me&hellip;then I left&rdquo;. It was Peters turn to choke. &ldquo;What? He gave you head and then you bounced?!&rdquo; You laughed, &ldquo;Damn, it sounds bad when you say it like that. But okay, so boom, we kiss blah blah blah and he you know&hellip;goes down on me and it was horrendous. We&rsquo;re twenty now, I feel like I&rsquo;m too old to have wack sex. If he can&rsquo;t give head then he probably can&rsquo;t fuck.&rdquo; You shrugged and Peter was looking at you like you had two heads. You walked to your dresser and began looking for a pair of pants to put on. &ldquo;Wow, do you think all girls think like that?&rdquo; Peter asked, he thought it was bad ass that you knew what you wanted and what you didn&rsquo;t want. And a little bit insecure.\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;I mean, I&rsquo;m sure no one wants bad head&rdquo; you replied. Peter couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder what your pussy tasted like. He guessed like his favorite cereal, honey nut cheerios. He shook his head, why was he thinking about you like this? The two of you had been friends since 6th grade. But holy shit your ass was gorgeous, how had he never noticed you had an ass like that before. &ldquo;You know, I&rsquo;ve never gone down on a girl&hellip;&rdquo; he mumbled, looking at his hands. You were genuinely shocked. You knew Peter could be a little shy but let&rsquo;s be real, he was stupidly handsome. &ldquo;Y/N, what if I&rsquo;m bad at it!&rdquo; he exclaimed. Peter tended to excel at everything he tried so you had no worries for him.\u00a0 &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that big of a deal Peter, trust me you&rsquo;ll be fine.&rdquo; &ldquo;But what if I&rsquo;m not?&rdquo; You laughed at his concern, about to pull your pants on.\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Wait! What if I&hellip;what if I practiced, like, on you?&rdquo; his voice got lower with every word. You couldn&rsquo;t believe you ears, your pants dropping to the floor. &ldquo;You want to eat my pussy?&rdquo; You asked incredulously. &ldquo;No I don&rsquo;t&hellip;.not like that; I mean I do but like in a friend way? Not that I wouldn&rsquo;t in a romantic way but like&hellip;fuck yes I do&rdquo; he threw his hands in the air. You could feel your body begin to heat up at the thought of him tasting you. &ldquo;Um.. if you want to, I guess, it couldn&rsquo;t hurt&rdquo;. Peter nodded, grabbing your hand and guiding you to sit on the bed. &ldquo;Can I kiss you?&rdquo; you asked, and Peter&rsquo;s heart raced at how innocent your voice sounded. He didn&rsquo;t speak, just leaned in to connect your lips. The moment your lips touched it was as if something broke inside the both of you. You could&rsquo;ve kissed him forever. Peter&rsquo;s hands went to your waist, pulling you onto his lap, his fingers fiddled with the hem of your shirt. You moaned into his mouth and nodded giving him permission to lift the top over your head. Peter pulled away to look at you, letting a hand cup your full breast. His thumb ran back and forth over your nipple and you shivered from the tingle it sent down your spine. &ldquo;Wow&hellip;when did you get these?&rdquo; Peter asked and you laughed pushing him back against the bed. You pulled your panties off, and you realized you were naked and he was fully clothed. &ldquo;Take off your shirt&rdquo; you instructed and he obeyed.\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>Peter lay back down, and you ran your hands down his hard chest. &ldquo;Where have you been hiding these&rdquo; you asked, letting a finger run over the lines of his abs. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been trying to show you for months! Now come here&rdquo; he spoke grabbing your hips and pulling you upwards. &ldquo;What?!&rdquo; you wondered aloud. &ldquo;I want you to sit on my face&rdquo; Peter responded like he had just told you the answer to a math question. &ldquo;I..okay&rdquo; you muttered, a bit taken a back. You positioned yourself over his face. He grasped your hips, &ldquo;Wait&rdquo; he commanded and you hovered above him. &ldquo;So pretty&rdquo; he whispered. He looked up at you and smiled when he saw you were already looking down at him, your mouth parted into a small &lsquo;o&rsquo;. He let his left hand reach under you, running his fingers between your folds, just barely brushing against your clit. You gasped and your hips jerked forward. Peter hummed, loving every second of having you above him. He let his thumb dip into your pussy, &ldquo;So fucking wet&rdquo; he drawled before putting the digit into his mouth to taste you. &ldquo;Oh my god&rdquo; you whimpered watching his sultry action. He&rsquo;d had enough.\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>Peter pulled you down to his mouth, getting straight to work. He let his tongue lap against the full length of your pussy, back and forth. His hands moved around to your ass grabbing handfuls of each supple cheek . He moved your body back and forth letting you ride his tongue. &ldquo;Peter&rdquo; you moaned, throwing your head back and letting your hands massage your tits. Peter looked up and nearly came in his jeans at the sight of your writhing above him. He&rsquo;d never wanted anything as bad as he wanted to make you cum in this moment. He moved his tongue to your hole and began moving it in and out, fucking you with the wet muscle. You shook your head in disbelief of how good he was making you feel. &ldquo;Peter I&rsquo;m gonna fucking cum&rdquo; you screamed, hand reaching down to grab his hair. He picked up the pace and wrapped an arm around your waist so he could could rub your clit. You didn&rsquo;t even get to warn Peter as your orgasm crashed over you. Your arms reached forward to grab the head board while you came so you could hold yourself up. Your chest heaved as you tried to catch your breathe.\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>But Peter didn&rsquo;t stop. &ldquo;Peter I can&rsquo;t&rdquo; you whined, your body feeling spent. &ldquo;Yes you can&rdquo; he mumbled, barely pulling his mouth away from your pussy. You tried to lift yourself up but he held you down against his tongue, fuck him and his super strength. Peter looked up at you again, your brows were scrunched together and your mouth wide open. He tightened his grip on you, grinding you against his face. You felt your second orgasm approaching and Peter could tell. He moved his mouth upwards, sucking on your sensitive clit. You fell forward this time as you came, screaming profanities. Peter let you go and you collapsed onto the bed next to him. He was on top of you in an instant, kissing you like his life depended on it. Your arms wrapped around his neck pulling him flush against your body, wrapping your legs around his waist. Peter pulled away staring down at you. &ldquo;How was that?&rdquo; he asked, and you could tell he was serious. &ldquo;It was amazing Peter, please fuck me, I need you to fuck me&rdquo; you practically begged, thrusting your hips against his. His fist slammed into the mattress beside him at the feel of your pussy rubbing against his hard dick. &ldquo;Holy shit, okay&rdquo; he groaned and reached to undo his pants when you heard the door to your apartment slam. You both froze.\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Hey guys, where are you? I&rsquo;m here! The pizza guy was standing downstairs he said he was for like 15 minutes so I just paid, you can cash app me later..&rdquo; It was Ned and MJ. &ldquo;What the fuck&rdquo; Peter whisper yelled. You pushed him off of you. Throwing his shirt at him. &ldquo;Get dressed&rdquo; you panicked. &ldquo;Tell them I&rsquo;m in the shower!&rdquo; you squealed before locking yourself in the bathroom.

You heard quick footsteps across your bedroom. \u201cWake up!\u201d Of course it was Peter. Rolling over onto your stomach, you buried your face into your pillows. You almost felt embarrassed once you remembered you only had on a t-shirt and underwear but you were too sleepy to move again. You felt the mattress shift and you knew that the way too giddy boy had climbed onto the the bed with you. You took a sharp inhale when you felt a pillow come down on your ass. \u201cIts 11 o clock! Get up you bum!\u201d Peter exclaimed before hitting you again. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a whole new breed of annoying\u201d you groaned, finally sitting up. Wincing as you opened your eyes, you couldn\u2019t help but crack a smile at your best friend. \u201cI\u2019m a whole new breed of man\u201d he replied and you rolled your eyes. \u201cYou should\u2019ve been spider-boy\u201d you reiterated\u00a0 for the thousandth time. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you let me be great? Anyways- what do you want to eat though, I\u2019m gonna order some food\"\u00a0 You thought about what you wanted and Peter plopped down next to you.\u00a0 He grabbed the remote to your T.V, without asking as usual and began scrolling through HBO. \"Let\u2019s watch Westworld, I\u2019ve been wanting to start that for a while\u2026\u201d he trailed off,\u00a0 turning his head to look at you. He stopped to admire you, so pretty even when you just woke up. Your hair was up in a ponytail, lips and cheeks a little puffy still from sleep. You wore an old Ramones t-shirt of his that he\u2019d given you after he shrunk it in the wash. He loved the way you looked in it. He loved the way you looked period. He didn\u2019t have a crush on you on you or anything though. You were his best friend. He just thought you were beautiful, smart, funny, and wanted to be around you all the time. That wasn\u2019t a crush was it? </p><p><br></p><p>He was pulled from his thoughts by the sound of your voice. \u201cLets get Alfredo. Shrimp or chicken though? Or maybe crab if you\u2019re feeling extravagant.\u201d He only partially heard what you said. \u201cYou want crab legs? That\u2019s so much work to eat.\u201d \u201cPeter you weren\u2019t even listening to me! Never mind just order some pizza.\u201d Peter felt a little bad for not listening but how could he focus when you looked like you did. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry! I\u2019ll order, Leonardi\u2019s?\u201d You gave him a look and he picked up his phone. \u201cHi, Peter Parker placing an order for a pepperoni pizza\u201d. You burst out laughing and he smiled before shushing you. You placed a hand over your mouth to try and keep quiet. \u201cDo I, Peter Parker want my Pepperoni pizza for pick up -no delivery please. No, this is not a prank call. 223 Myrtle Avenue. 1 hour? Thank you!\u201d You removed your hand and let your laughs flow freely. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a joke - oh my god, that was damn near a tongue twister\u201d. Peter began laughing with you, his hand finding a place on your upper thigh. \u201cOoo you finally shaved your legs\u201d \u201cShut Up! I had to, I went on a date\u201d. Peter leaned away from you with a shocked face, \u201cYou what?!\u201d \u201cWhy is it so shocking that I went on a date? But yes, I did. Remember that guy we ran into at the train station - Nathan? It was actually really nice\u201d You stared at your friend and waited for him to respond. \u201cDid you have a sex with him?\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>Your eyebrows rose up almost to your hairline, \u201cWhy is that your first question\u201d. You stood up and fixed your underwear, sliding your feet into your fluffy slippers. \u201cWell, you shaved your legs so I assume it\u2019s because you intended to fuck him\u201d. You nearly choked on your on spit, \u201cJeez Peter, and no I didn\u2019t have sex with him. He just went down on me\u2026then I left\u201d. It was Peters turn to choke. \u201cWhat? He gave you head and then you bounced?!\u201d You laughed, \u201cDamn, it sounds bad when you say it like that. But okay, so boom, we kiss blah blah blah and he you know\u2026goes down on me and it was horrendous. We\u2019re twenty now, I feel like I\u2019m too old to have wack sex. If he can\u2019t give head then he probably can\u2019t fuck.\u201d You shrugged and Peter was looking at you like you had two heads. You walked to your dresser and began looking for a pair of pants to put on. \u201cWow, do you think all girls think like that?\u201d Peter asked, he thought it was bad ass that you knew what you wanted and what you didn\u2019t want. And a little bit insecure.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI mean, I\u2019m sure no one wants bad head\u201d you replied. Peter couldn\u2019t help but wonder what your pussy tasted like. He guessed like his favorite cereal, honey nut cheerios. He shook his head, why was he thinking about you like this? The two of you had been friends since 6th grade. But holy shit your ass was gorgeous, how had he never noticed you had an ass like that before. \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve never gone down on a girl\u2026\u201d he mumbled, looking at his hands. You were genuinely shocked. You knew Peter could be a little shy but let\u2019s be real, he was stupidly handsome. \u201cY/N, what if I\u2019m bad at it!\u201d he exclaimed. Peter tended to excel at everything he tried so you had no worries for him.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s not that big of a deal Peter, trust me you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d \u201cBut what if I\u2019m not?\u201d You laughed at his concern, about to pull your pants on.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWait! What if I\u2026what if I practiced, like, on you?\u201d his voice got lower with every word. You couldn\u2019t believe you ears, your pants dropping to the floor. \u201cYou want to eat my pussy?\u201d You asked incredulously. \u201cNo I don\u2019t\u2026.not like that; I mean I do but like in a friend way? Not that I wouldn\u2019t in a romantic way but like\u2026fuck yes I do\u201d he threw his hands in the air. You could feel your body begin to heat up at the thought of him tasting you. \u201cUm.. if you want to, I guess, it couldn\u2019t hurt\u201d. Peter nodded, grabbing your hand and guiding you to sit on the bed. \u201cCan I kiss you?\u201d you asked, and Peter\u2019s heart raced at how innocent your voice sounded. He didn\u2019t speak, just leaned in to connect your lips. The moment your lips touched it was as if something broke inside the both of you. You could\u2019ve kissed him forever. Peter\u2019s hands went to your waist, pulling you onto his lap, his fingers fiddled with the hem of your shirt. You moaned into his mouth and nodded giving him permission to lift the top over your head. Peter pulled away to look at you, letting a hand cup your full breast. His thumb ran back and forth over your nipple and you shivered from the tingle it sent down your spine. \u201cWow\u2026when did you get these?\u201d Peter asked and you laughed pushing him back against the bed. You pulled your panties off, and you realized you were naked and he was fully clothed. \u201cTake off your shirt\u201d you instructed and he obeyed.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>Peter lay back down, and you ran your hands down his hard chest. \u201cWhere have you been hiding these\u201d you asked, letting a finger run over the lines of his abs. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to show you for months! Now come here\u201d he spoke grabbing your hips and pulling you upwards. \u201cWhat?!\u201d you wondered aloud. \u201cI want you to sit on my face\u201d Peter responded like he had just told you the answer to a math question. \u201cI..okay\u201d you muttered, a bit taken a back. You positioned yourself over his face. He grasped your hips, \u201cWait\u201d he commanded and you hovered above him. \u201cSo pretty\u201d he whispered. He looked up at you and smiled when he saw you were already looking down at him, your mouth parted into a small \u2018o\u2019. He let his left hand reach under you, running his fingers between your folds, just barely brushing against your clit. You gasped and your hips jerked forward. Peter hummed, loving every second of having you above him. He let his thumb dip into your pussy, \u201cSo fucking wet\u201d he drawled before putting the digit into his mouth to taste you. \u201cOh my god\u201d you whimpered watching his sultry action. He\u2019d had enough.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>Peter pulled you down to his mouth, getting straight to work. He let his tongue lap against the full length of your pussy, back and forth. His hands moved around to your ass grabbing handfuls of each supple cheek . He moved your body back and forth letting you ride his tongue. \u201cPeter\u201d you moaned, throwing your head back and letting your hands massage your tits. Peter looked up and nearly came in his jeans at the sight of your writhing above him. He\u2019d never wanted anything as bad as he wanted to make you cum in this moment. He moved his tongue to your hole and began moving it in and out, fucking you with the wet muscle. You shook your head in disbelief of how good he was making you feel. \u201cPeter I\u2019m gonna fucking cum\u201d you screamed, hand reaching down to grab his hair. He picked up the pace and wrapped an arm around your waist so he could could rub your clit. You didn\u2019t even get to warn Peter as your orgasm crashed over you. Your arms reached forward to grab the head board while you came so you could hold yourself up. Your chest heaved as you tried to catch your breathe.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>But Peter didn\u2019t stop. \u201cPeter I can\u2019t\u201d you whined, your body feeling spent. \u201cYes you can\u201d he mumbled, barely pulling his mouth away from your pussy. You tried to lift yourself up but he held you down against his tongue, fuck him and his super strength. Peter looked up at you again, your brows were scrunched together and your mouth wide open. He tightened his grip on you, grinding you against his face. You felt your second orgasm approaching and Peter could tell. He moved his mouth upwards, sucking on your sensitive clit. You fell forward this time as you came, screaming profanities. Peter let you go and you collapsed onto the bed next to him. He was on top of you in an instant, kissing you like his life depended on it. Your arms wrapped around his neck pulling him flush against your body, wrapping your legs around his waist. Peter pulled away staring down at you. \u201cHow was that?\u201d he asked, and you could tell he was serious. \u201cIt was amazing Peter, please fuck me, I need you to fuck me\u201d you practically begged, thrusting your hips against his. His fist slammed into the mattress beside him at the feel of your pussy rubbing against his hard dick. \u201cHoly shit, okay\u201d he groaned and reached to undo his pants when you heard the door to your apartment slam. You both froze.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHey guys, where are you? I\u2019m here! The pizza guy was standing downstairs he said he was for like 15 minutes so I just paid, you can cash app me later..\u201d It was Ned and MJ. \u201cWhat the fuck\u201d Peter whisper yelled. You pushed him off of you. Throwing his shirt at him. \u201cGet dressed\u201d you panicked. \u201cTell them I\u2019m in the shower!\u201d you squealed before locking yourself in the bathroom. Peter tugged his shirt on before realizing he still had the biggest hard on in the history of hard ons. \u201cFuck it\u201d he mumbled walking out into the living room. He gave Ned an unenthusiastic wave and grabbed a slice of pizza. Ned was about to say hi when he noticed Peters boner. \u201cDon\u2019t say a word\u201d he grunted, taking a bite and shaking his head at his friends.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cEvery time I come over here something weird is going on\u2026\u201d Ned whispered to himself.</p><p>_____________________________</p><p>My first imagine about Peter Parker!

He looked up at you and smiled when he saw you were already looking down at him, your mouth parted into a small \u2018o\u2019. He let his left hand reach under you, running his fingers between your folds, just barely brushing against your clit. You gasped and your hips jerked forward. Peter hummed, loving every second of having you above him. He let his thumb dip into your pussy, \u201cSo fucking wet\u201d he drawled before putting the digit into his mouth to taste you. \u201cOh my god\u201d you whimpered watching his sultry action. He\u2019d had enough.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>Peter pulled you down to his mouth, getting straight to work. He let his tongue lap against the full length of your pussy, back and forth. His hands moved around to your ass grabbing handfuls of each supple cheek . He moved your body back and forth letting you ride his tongue. \u201cPeter\u201d you moaned, throwing your head back and letting your hands massage your tits. Peter looked up and nearly came in his jeans at the sight of your writhing above him. He\u2019d never wanted anything as bad as he wanted to make you cum in this moment. He moved his tongue to your hole and began moving it in and out, fucking you with the wet muscle. You shook your head in disbelief of how good he was making you feel. \u201cPeter I\u2019m gonna fucking cum\u201d you screamed, hand reaching down to grab his hair. He picked up the pace and wrapped an arm around your waist so he could could rub your clit. You didn\u2019t even get to warn Peter as your orgasm crashed over you. Your arms reached forward to grab the head board while you came so you could hold yourself up. Your chest heaved as you tried to catch your breathe.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>But Peter didn\u2019t stop. \u201cPeter I can\u2019t\u201d you whined, your body feeling spent. \u201cYes you can\u201d he mumbled, barely pulling his mouth away from your pussy. You tried to lift yourself up but he held you down against his tongue, fuck him and his super strength. Peter looked up at you again, your brows were scrunched together and your mouth wide open. He tightened his grip on you, grinding you against his face. You felt your second orgasm approaching and Peter could tell. He moved his mouth upwards, sucking on your sensitive clit. You fell forward this time as you came, screaming profanities. Peter let you go and you collapsed onto the bed next to him. He was on top of you in an instant, kissing you like his life depended on it. Your arms wrapped around his neck pulling him flush against your body, wrapping your legs around his waist. Peter pulled away staring down at you. \u201cHow was that?\u201d he asked, and you could tell he was serious. \u201cIt was amazing Peter, please fuck me, I need you to fuck me\u201d you practically begged, thrusting your hips against his. His fist slammed into the mattress beside him at the feel of your pussy rubbing against his hard dick. \u201cHoly shit, okay\u201d he groaned and reached to undo his pants when you heard the door to your apartment slam. You both froze.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHey guys, where are you? I\u2019m here! The pizza guy was standing downstairs he said he was for like 15 minutes so I just paid, you can cash app me later..\u201d It was Ned and MJ. \u201cWhat the fuck\u201d Peter whisper yelled. You pushed him off of you. Throwing his shirt at him. \u201cGet dressed\u201d you panicked. \u201cTell them I\u2019m in the shower!\u201d you squealed before locking yourself in the bathroom. Peter tugged his shirt on before realizing he still had the biggest hard on in the history of hard ons. \u201cFuck it\u201d he mumbled walking out into the living room. He gave Ned an unenthusiastic wave and grabbed a slice of pizza. Ned was about to say hi when he noticed Peters boner. \u201cDon\u2019t say a word\u201d he grunted, taking a bite and shaking his head at his friends.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cEvery time I come over here something weird is going on\u2026\u201d Ned whispered to himself.</p><p>_____________________________</p><p>My first imagine about Peter Parker!

                "content": "<p><h2>Tongue Twister </h2><h2>In which Peter Parker orders a Pepperoni Pizza&hellip;.and gives his best friend head. </h2><p><b>Pairing:</b> Peter Parker X Reader</p><p><b>Warnings:</b> smut!!! </p><p><b>Word count:</b> 2k</p><p>_______________________________</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>   Your eyelids scrunched together at the sudden brightness and heat that hit your face. You heard quick footsteps across your bedroom. &ldquo;Wake up!&rdquo; Of course it was Peter. Rolling over onto your stomach, you buried your face into your pillows. You almost felt embarrassed once you remembered you only had on a t-shirt and underwear but you were too sleepy to move again. You felt the mattress shift and you knew that the way too giddy boy had climbed onto the the bed with you. You took a sharp inhale when you felt a pillow come down on your ass. &ldquo;Its 11 o clock! Get up you bum!&rdquo; Peter exclaimed before hitting you again. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a whole new breed of annoying&rdquo; you groaned, finally sitting up. Wincing as you opened your eyes, you couldn&rsquo;t help but crack a smile at your best friend. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a whole new breed of man&rdquo; he replied and you rolled your eyes. &ldquo;You should&rsquo;ve been spider-boy&rdquo; you reiterated&nbsp; for the thousandth time. &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you let me be great? Anyways- what do you want to eat though, I&rsquo;m gonna order some food\"&nbsp; You thought about what you wanted and Peter plopped down next to you.&nbsp; He grabbed the remote to your T.V, without asking as usual and began scrolling through HBO. \"Let&rsquo;s watch Westworld, I&rsquo;ve been wanting to start that for a while&hellip;&rdquo; he trailed off,&nbsp; turning his head to look at you. He stopped to admire you, so pretty even when you just woke up. Your hair was up in a ponytail, lips and cheeks a little puffy still from sleep. You wore an old Ramones t-shirt of his that he&rsquo;d given you after he shrunk it in the wash. He loved the way you looked in it. He loved the way you looked period. He didn&rsquo;t have a crush on you on you or anything though. You were his best friend. He just thought you were beautiful, smart, funny, and wanted to be around you all the time. That wasn&rsquo;t a crush was it? </p><p><br /></p><p>He was pulled from his thoughts by the sound of your voice. &ldquo;Lets get Alfredo. Shrimp or chicken though? Or maybe crab if you&rsquo;re feeling extravagant.&rdquo; He only partially heard what you said. &ldquo;You want crab legs? That&rsquo;s so much work to eat.&rdquo; &ldquo;Peter you weren&rsquo;t even listening to me! Never mind just order some pizza.&rdquo; Peter felt a little bad for not listening but how could he focus when you looked like you did. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry! I&rsquo;ll order, Leonardi&rsquo;s?&rdquo; You gave him a look and he picked up his phone. &ldquo;Hi, Peter Parker placing an order for a pepperoni pizza&rdquo;. You burst out laughing and he smiled before shushing you. You placed a hand over your mouth to try and keep quiet. &ldquo;Do I, Peter Parker want my Pepperoni pizza for pick up -no delivery please. No, this is not a prank call. 223 Myrtle Avenue. 1 hour? Thank you!&rdquo; You removed your hand and let your laughs flow freely. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a joke - oh my god, that was damn near a tongue twister&rdquo;. Peter began laughing with you, his hand finding a place on your upper thigh. &ldquo;Ooo you finally shaved your legs&rdquo; &ldquo;Shut Up! I had to, I went on a date&rdquo;. Peter leaned away from you with a shocked face, &ldquo;You what?!&rdquo; &ldquo;Why is it so shocking that I went on a date? But yes, I did. Remember that guy we ran into at the train station - Nathan? It was actually really nice&rdquo; You stared at your friend and waited for him to respond. &ldquo;Did you have a sex with him?&rdquo; </p><p><br /></p><p>Your eyebrows rose up almost to your hairline, &ldquo;Why is that your first question&rdquo;. You stood up and fixed your underwear, sliding your feet into your fluffy slippers. &ldquo;Well, you shaved your legs so I assume it&rsquo;s because you intended to fuck him&rdquo;. You nearly choked on your on spit, &ldquo;Jeez Peter, and no I didn&rsquo;t have sex with him. He just went down on me&hellip;then I left&rdquo;. It was Peters turn to choke. &ldquo;What? He gave you head and then you bounced?!&rdquo; You laughed, &ldquo;Damn, it sounds bad when you say it like that. But okay, so boom, we kiss blah blah blah and he you know&hellip;goes down on me and it was horrendous. We&rsquo;re twenty now, I feel like I&rsquo;m too old to have wack sex. If he can&rsquo;t give head then he probably can&rsquo;t fuck.&rdquo; You shrugged and Peter was looking at you like you had two heads. You walked to your dresser and began looking for a pair of pants to put on. &ldquo;Wow, do you think all girls think like that?&rdquo; Peter asked, he thought it was bad ass that you knew what you wanted and what you didn&rsquo;t want. And a little bit insecure.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I mean, I&rsquo;m sure no one wants bad head&rdquo; you replied. Peter couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder what your pussy tasted like. He guessed like his favorite cereal, honey nut cheerios. He shook his head, why was he thinking about you like this? The two of you had been friends since 6th grade. But holy shit your ass was gorgeous, how had he never noticed you had an ass like that before. &ldquo;You know, I&rsquo;ve never gone down on a girl&hellip;&rdquo; he mumbled, looking at his hands. You were genuinely shocked. You knew Peter could be a little shy but let&rsquo;s be real, he was stupidly handsome. &ldquo;Y/N, what if I&rsquo;m bad at it!&rdquo; he exclaimed. Peter tended to excel at everything he tried so you had no worries for him.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that big of a deal Peter, trust me you&rsquo;ll be fine.&rdquo; &ldquo;But what if I&rsquo;m not?&rdquo; You laughed at his concern, about to pull your pants on.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Wait! What if I&hellip;what if I practiced, like, on you?&rdquo; his voice got lower with every word. You couldn&rsquo;t believe you ears, your pants dropping to the floor. &ldquo;You want to eat my pussy?&rdquo; You asked incredulously. &ldquo;No I don&rsquo;t&hellip;.not like that; I mean I do but like in a friend way? Not that I wouldn&rsquo;t in a romantic way but like&hellip;fuck yes I do&rdquo; he threw his hands in the air. You could feel your body begin to heat up at the thought of him tasting you. &ldquo;Um.. if you want to, I guess, it couldn&rsquo;t hurt&rdquo;. Peter nodded, grabbing your hand and guiding you to sit on the bed. &ldquo;Can I kiss you?&rdquo; you asked, and Peter&rsquo;s heart raced at how innocent your voice sounded. He didn&rsquo;t speak, just leaned in to connect your lips. The moment your lips touched it was as if something broke inside the both of you. You could&rsquo;ve kissed him forever. Peter&rsquo;s hands went to your waist, pulling you onto his lap, his fingers fiddled with the hem of your shirt. You moaned into his mouth and nodded giving him permission to lift the top over your head. Peter pulled away to look at you, letting a hand cup your full breast. His thumb ran back and forth over your nipple and you shivered from the tingle it sent down your spine. &ldquo;Wow&hellip;when did you get these?&rdquo; Peter asked and you laughed pushing him back against the bed. You pulled your panties off, and you realized you were naked and he was fully clothed. &ldquo;Take off your shirt&rdquo; you instructed and he obeyed.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Peter lay back down, and you ran your hands down his hard chest. &ldquo;Where have you been hiding these&rdquo; you asked, letting a finger run over the lines of his abs. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been trying to show you for months! Now come here&rdquo; he spoke grabbing your hips and pulling you upwards. &ldquo;What?!&rdquo; you wondered aloud. &ldquo;I want you to sit on my face&rdquo; Peter responded like he had just told you the answer to a math question. &ldquo;I..okay&rdquo; you muttered, a bit taken a back.

You hated seeing Peter down, especially since he always tries so hard to keep other people happy.</p><p>&ldquo;We could try cuddling, that usually seems to do the trick.&rdquo; He smiled and the small action made your heart skip a beat. That was the first time he&rsquo;d done that all day. He pulled you down so you could cuddle into his side. You wrapped your arms around his waist as he pulled you close and buried his face into your hair, taking a deep breath.</p><p>&ldquo;Mmmm, your hair&rsquo;s so soft. It always smells so good. You&rsquo;re like my own personal pillow.&rdquo; You just smiled into his chest and hugged him tighter.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you for staying with me today Y/N, you have no idea how much I appreciate you. I love you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Anything for you, my sweet boy.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p><a href=\"https://bbypeterprkr.tumblr.com/post/185231595791/200-dialogue-prompts\"><b><i>Send Micah prompts, she&rsquo;s sooooo bored.</i></b></a></p>",
