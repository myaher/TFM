Yet, following the introduction of Miles Morales \u2013 the new and Black\nSpider-Man (reportedly meant to honor Bendis\u2019 Black children, whom I pity) \u2013\nyou could tell, in the years preceding the removal of Peter Parker as the\nprotagonist of the <i>Spider-Man</i> title,\nBendis was regretting his decision.<br/></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0b18948f7a151408d982318a0475dd86/tumblr_inline_pm5wkxVtvv1s8x54y_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure><p>After a 160 issue run (where Peter made actual appearances\nand was the protagonist until his death), the questionably numbered <i>Ultimate Spider-Man #200</i>, once again\nsees Bendis fantasizing about what he might\u2019ve done had he not killed Peter\nParker and replaced him with Miles Morales. Most of the original cast of\ncharacters that were central to Peter Parker\u2019s story \u2013 plus Miles and Ganke \u2013\ngather together at the Parker House at the behest of May Parker and Gwen Stacy\n(who appears to be a creep perving on underage teen boys no matter what), to\ncommemorate the life of the late Peter Parker. Considering the previous three\niterations of \u201cMemorializing Peter Parker\u201d in the UM, <i>Ultimate Spider-Man #200</i> brings nothing new to the table, but should\u2019ve\nbeen a red flag to anyone paying attention to the declining quality of Miles\u2019\ntitle.</p><p>Miles\u2019 final title in the Ultimate Universe, <i>Miles Morales: The Ultimate Spider-Man,</i>\nbegins with the reintroduction of a supposed-to-be-dead Norman Osborn \u2013 in the\ncustody of S.H.I.E.L.D. \u2013 and two generic Spider-Man copycats robbing banks.\nThere\u2019s nothing really of note to say about the first seven issues of this\nthirteen issue title. Bendis decides, with the Ultimate Marvel universe doing\nthe death rattle, to undo the death of both Osborn and Peter Parker \u2013 with\nPeter getting a half-assed excuse for his being brought back from the dead (to\nsum it up: \u201cbecause reasons\u201d).</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/834e0c893418451a96074400f6422c58/tumblr_inline_pm5x61Vlqr1s8x54y_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure><p>I don\u2019t think a <i>Spider-Man</i>\ncomic has made me quite as angry as this series has. In the moment I read the\nissue wherein Peter Parker tells Miles, \u201cIt\u2019s time for the Original Spider-Man\nto get back into the game\u201d, I could\u2019ve torn the book into shreds and smote its\nruins if I thought it was going to hurt Marvel\u2019s sales and not be an even\ngreater waste of my spent $3.99.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re beating this dead horse\nagain\u201d was what I was thinking and I just stopped buying the book altogether. I\nthink that the first step to mine ceasing to see Miles Morales as a legitimate\ncharacter, but wasted potential in the hands of non-Black creatives. I only ended up\nreading the trades for the sake of reference and fact checking and it\u2019s only\nthis year, three-four years after the fact that I bothered to do that. \u00a0The only thing worth noting about the first\nseven issues of this title is that it sets up the last four, which are even\nworse.</p><!-- more --><h2><b><i>Cataclysm: Ultimate Spider-Man</i> #1-3 + Issues #8-9</b></h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f56b9172170f697f1fa2e39ff4cd7991/tumblr_inline_pm5xc9auwL1s8x54y_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure><p><i>Cataclysm: Ultimate Spider-Man</i>\nis one of seven miniseries titles part of the \u201cBlockbuster Event\u201d known as <i>Cataclysm</i>, which sees Ultimate Galactus\n(or 616 Galactus, I\u2019m not sure which tbh. There\u2019s very little difference\nbetween the two when you get to the nitty-gritty) attempting to destroy the\n1610 universe and devour it all. You get the distinct feeling that, before\nsomeone came up with <i>Secret Wars</i>, <i>Cataclysm</i> was meant to be the true end\nof the Ultimate Universe \u2013 but someone upstairs changed their mind and rendered\nit to a mere false start. Long story short: The grand majority \u2013 if not all of\n\u2013 the Ultimates (the Avengers of the 1610 universe) are killed or sent into the\nvoid with Galactus by Ultimate Shadowcat \u2013 who is later hailed savior of the\nworld. The All-New Ultimates are formed.\u00a0</p><p><i>Das it.</i>\u00a0</p><p>But, within Miles\u2019 slice of the <i>Cataclysm</i> story, Bendis finally decides to focus on the elephant in\nthe room: Jefferson Davis and his open and his fantasy xenophobia toward superhumans\nand how it has literally silenced his own son from admitting to his double life\nas Spider-Man. Moreso since the death of his mother, Rio Morales, at the hands\nof Ultimate Venom. I\u2019ll be perfectly honest \u2013 I don\u2019t think Jefferson Davis is\na great guy \u2013 I actually ended up liking his no-account brother (Aaron Davis,\ngone too soon) far more because he was upfront about his ideals and his mission\nstatement. He never pretended or tried to be a better person. He was just\nrotten and enjoyed it.</p><p>For that one piece of sage advice Jefferson offered Miles in\nthe earliest tenure of his first title, Jefferson is the perfect example of a\nman who expects his son to \u201cdo as he says, and as I do\u201d, but expects no\nconsequences visited upon him whenever he dehumanizes people. He\u2019s a walking\nmetaphor for the heterosexual Black father who spews homophobic slurs in casual\nconversation around their gay daughter or son and I\u2019m sure as hell that was\nintentional despite the incompatibility of the allegory.<br/></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/79a6c3d44c89afae904d387062fc5e92/tumblr_inline_pm5xpqopxH1s8x54y_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure><p><i>Cataclysm: Ultimate Spider-Man</i>\ndoesn\u2019t do much to repair his character, if anything it makes him thrice times worse.\nWhen Galactus starts wrecking all of New York City and Brooklyn, Miles,\nBombshell (Lana Baumgartner) and Cloak and Dagger, struggle to save the people\ncaught in the monster\u2019s wake \u2013 all while recounting where they were when the <i>Ultimatum</i> event occurred. </p><p>In Miles\u2019 flashback, we see Jefferson lose his head over the\nknowledge that the title wave was caused by a mutant (Magneto), all while\nloudly proclaiming everyone stuck in traffic was going to die. The most\nimportant nugget of information taken away from Miles\u2019 flashback is the\nknowledge that his father more or less promised that he would abandon or disown\nMiles if he ever found out his son (then, probably only 11 or 12 years old at\nthe time) was a superhuman.\u00a0</p><p>I never had much sympathy for Davis (I tolerated\nhim because of Rio), but the moment Miles tries to convince his father to come\nwith him out of the city to safety, and Jefferson decides to blame a now\nfourteen year old Miles for the death of Rio and Aaron, I just outright hated\nhim. <i>Cataclysm: Ultimate Spider-Man</i>\nis not a bad read all things considered. It tells its story concisely and never\nloses focus of its characters in relation to the catastrophe. The downside is that you have to read\nthe rest of the <i>Cataclysm</i> series to\nknow what was going on. I\u2019d probably recommend you read it, especially since it\nties into two issues of <i>The Ultimate\nSpider-Man</i>.\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3f98ca4c539ca6ee43e918c739d7d36c/tumblr_inline_pm60csdqzY1s8x54y_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure><p>The conflict between Miles and Jefferson is left hanging\nuntil issues #8 and #9 of <i>Miles Morales: The\nUltimate Spider-Man</i> \u2013 also known as \u201cThe Only Redeeming Thing About This\nComic Book Title\u201d. The eighth and ninth issues of MMTUSM sees Jefferson Davis\nfinally owning up to his past and basically just spilling the beans about his\nlife as a criminal with Aaron and how he became involved with S.H.I.E.L.D.\nduring the 80s \u2013 when <i>Miami Vice</i>,\nJerri Curls, <i>House Party</i> Flattops,\nand ill-fitting suits with shoulder pads were all the rage \u2013 and how he met a\nyoung, already-at-it, Nick Fury.\u00a0</p><p>The complete tonal and visual shift in the issues are a\nwelcome respite from the Peter Parker nonsense of the previous seven. The story\narc, \u201cMiles Morales: An Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.?\u201d, carries with it the kind\u2019ve of\nvisual flair I see a Tim Sale illustrated graphic novel (like <i>Spider-Man: Blue</i> or <i>The Long Halloween</i>), but it\u2019s still David Marquez illustrating the\nstory from beginning to end.\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b09905c9ac4de453963f3be5e8fd66c3/tumblr_inline_pm5y1rdUZ51s8x54y_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure><p>It\u2019s got the look and feel of a pulp novel, or one\nof those old newspaper comic strips where the spots of the print were obvious\nthrough the inking and character sketches. The narrative, which sees Jefferson and\nAaron working for smalltime criminals to Jefferson\u2019s eventual graduation to\nprotecting the Kingpin (with a minor explanation as to why he loathes mutants),\nis, in my opinion, the highlight of a story that could\u2019ve worked as a\nfull-fledged miniseries about the Jefferson brothers.</p><p>My only quibble with the framing of the narrative is that\nthe early inclusion of S.H.I.E.L.D makes Jefferson look more like the unwilling\nparticipant of crime he was manipulated into thinking he had to do for \u201cthe\ngreater good\u201d, as opposed to some young blood who didn\u2019t give much thought to\nright or wrong (which is how the early issues framed it) before he had an\nepiphany. I always assumed the crime came first, then S.H.I.E.L.D, then Rio.\nHonestly, if you\u2019re at all interested in this storyline, just look for the\nsingle issues and don\u2019t buy the trade. You\u2019ll be doing yourself a favor.<br/></p><hr><h2><b>#Issues 10-13</b></h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b7f088a6269826655603bbe7dd74ced7/tumblr_inline_pm61gf1nK71s8x54y_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure><p>Marvel and its twisted, present-day romantic relationship\nwith Neo-Nazism is a fairly ironic one, given most of its early artists were white Jewish dudes with alternate names designed to explicitly hide their Jewishness\non account of antisemitism. But, I suppose the publications preoccupation with\nNazism to begin with (even if it was denouncing it) would\u2019ve inevitably steered\nits future publishers to romanticize it in the end. I mean, that\u2019s what\nhappened after all.</p><p>You know shit it bad when Marvel wants you to pity [white]\ncharacters like Grant Ward of <i>Agents of\nS.H.I.E.L.D</i> for joining a Neo-Nazi group, despite the repeated and angry\naffirmations of protagonist Daisy Johnson, who flat-out reminds the audience,\n\u201cYou are a Nazi if you join Hydra\u201d, who is undermined anyway by the narrative that\ncontinues to bleat, \u201cpity the Neo-Nazi.\u201d</p><p>Brian Michael Bendis, in all his infinite lack of wisdom,\ndecides \u2013 the biggest way to differ Miles Morales\u2019 love life from Peter Parker\u2019s,\nis make an underdeveloped character, his girlfriend, Ultimate Kate Bishop, a\nmember of Hydra. Miles\u2019 white girlfriend rides on the agenda of the Aryan Ideal\nand white supremacy. <i>Brilliant.</i></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c1f6741819311b1ac03df8f833e81082/tumblr_inline_pm61c7wUWc1s8x54y_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure><p><i>The Ultimate\nSpider-Man</i> issues, #1-#4 and #7 prelude the last four issues with Miles\ndeliberating whether or not he should tell Katie Bishop about his double life\nas Spider-Man. Instead of being supportive, everyone from Ganke to Cloak and\nDagger warns Miles against telling her, thinking it would be a bad idea. He\ndoes it anyway, Katie panics and runs away.\u00a0</p><p>The aforementioned issues give the reader a glimpse into\nKate\u2019s life with the Bishops, with one conversation with her older sister\ncasually mentioning that \u201cthey\u201d would have to kill Miles and the seventh issue\nconcludes with her uttering the phrase, \u201cHail Hydra.\u201d</p><p>If <i>The Ultimate Spider-Man</i>\nhad something to say about the issue of Nazism, especially in relation to\nMiles\u2019 life as a Black teen \u2013 or the cautionary tale of \u201cyou never know someone\nuntil\u2026\u201d, then I could maybe understand the decision to make Kate Bishop (a\nwildly popular Avenger in the 616 universe, be she an adult or a teenager) a\nNazi. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"256\" data-orig-width=\"569\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2d1b8116d8804c5bea844f7ac3ed29b3/tumblr_inline_pm621uBQmH1s8x54y_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"256\" data-orig-width=\"569\"/></figure><p>But, it doesn\u2019t, it basically does exactly the same thing <i>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D</i> does with the\nDaisy Johnson/Grant Ward dynamic. The narrative depicts a \u201cSympathetic Nazi\u201d\n(Katie) trying to explain their position, and a furious significant other\n(Miles) outright declaring their relationship is over. Only, where AOS more or\nless dragged that subplot out to its natural conclusion (\u201cSympathetic Nazi\u201d isn\u2019t\nreally sympathetic and dies),\u00a0</p><p><i>The\nUltimate Spider-Man</i> did nothing to that extent. Readers barely have gotten\nto known Katie Bishop since her introduction in issue #23 of UCSM. She was given\nno time actually to be anything other than \u201cMiles Morales\u2019 girlfriend\u201d. And\nwhen it comes right down to it, the Hydra subplot was nothing but an excuse to\nbring Dr. Doom into the narrative at the last moment. So, the \u201cMy Girlfriend is\na Nazi\u201d storyline just falls flat.</p><p>On a smaller note, the way the last couple issues decide to\nuse Judge \u2013 the minor character from <i>Ultimate\nComics Spider-Man</i> \u2013 is sigh inducing. It\u2019s like Bendis realized his book\nwas coming to an end and figured the best way to a handle a character that\nbarely had any face time since the first twelve issues of the UCSM, is to just\nplop him in the middle of the story with his already knowing Miles is\nSpider-Man.\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1690633a080fa23f33285666834a81a8/tumblr_inline_pm628q3Szi1s8x54y_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure><p>But, he does it in a way that, if you removed him from the story,\nnothing would change. It\u2019s a superfluous addition and kind\u2019ve discourteous,\nespecially since Bendis doesn\u2019t do anything with Judge later on in Miles\u2019 new\n616 title, the unfortunately named <i>Spider-Man</i>.</p><hr><p>Outside of issues #8 and #9, <i>Miles Morales: The Ultimate Spider-Man</i> is a sad conclusion to Miles\nUltimate Universe solo-title career. It reminded me why I stopped reading his\ntitle four years ago, and knowing that none of his recent stuff isn\u2019t any good\neither kinda makes me glad I made the decision so early on.</p>",

There\u2019s very little difference\nbetween the two when you get to the nitty-gritty) attempting to destroy the\n1610 universe and devour it all. You get the distinct feeling that, before\nsomeone came up with <i>Secret Wars</i>, <i>Cataclysm</i> was meant to be the true end\nof the Ultimate Universe \u2013 but someone upstairs changed their mind and rendered\nit to a mere false start. Long story short: The grand majority \u2013 if not all of\n\u2013 the Ultimates (the Avengers of the 1610 universe) are killed or sent into the\nvoid with Galactus by Ultimate Shadowcat \u2013 who is later hailed savior of the\nworld. The All-New Ultimates are formed.\u00a0</p><p><i>Das it.</i>\u00a0</p><p>But, within Miles\u2019 slice of the <i>Cataclysm</i> story, Bendis finally decides to focus on the elephant in\nthe room: Jefferson Davis and his open and his fantasy xenophobia toward superhumans\nand how it has literally silenced his own son from admitting to his double life\nas Spider-Man. Moreso since the death of his mother, Rio Morales, at the hands\nof Ultimate Venom. I\u2019ll be perfectly honest \u2013 I don\u2019t think Jefferson Davis is\na great guy \u2013 I actually ended up liking his no-account brother (Aaron Davis,\ngone too soon) far more because he was upfront about his ideals and his mission\nstatement. He never pretended or tried to be a better person. He was just\nrotten and enjoyed it.</p><p>For that one piece of sage advice Jefferson offered Miles in\nthe earliest tenure of his first title, Jefferson is the perfect example of a\nman who expects his son to \u201cdo as he says, and as I do\u201d, but expects no\nconsequences visited upon him whenever he dehumanizes people. He\u2019s a walking\nmetaphor for the heterosexual Black father who spews homophobic slurs in casual\nconversation around their gay daughter or son and I\u2019m sure as hell that was\nintentional despite the incompatibility of the allegory.<br></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/79a6c3d44c89afae904d387062fc5e92/tumblr_inline_pm5xpqopxH1s8x54y_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><p><i>Cataclysm: Ultimate Spider-Man</i>\ndoesn\u2019t do much to repair his character, if anything it makes him thrice times worse.\nWhen Galactus starts wrecking all of New York City and Brooklyn, Miles,\nBombshell (Lana Baumgartner) and Cloak and Dagger, struggle to save the people\ncaught in the monster\u2019s wake \u2013 all while recounting where they were when the <i>Ultimatum</i> event occurred. </p><p>In Miles\u2019 flashback, we see Jefferson lose his head over the\nknowledge that the title wave was caused by a mutant (Magneto), all while\nloudly proclaiming everyone stuck in traffic was going to die. The most\nimportant nugget of information taken away from Miles\u2019 flashback is the\nknowledge that his father more or less promised that he would abandon or disown\nMiles if he ever found out his son (then, probably only 11 or 12 years old at\nthe time) was a superhuman.\u00a0</p><p>I never had much sympathy for Davis (I tolerated\nhim because of Rio), but the moment Miles tries to convince his father to come\nwith him out of the city to safety, and Jefferson decides to blame a now\nfourteen year old Miles for the death of Rio and Aaron, I just outright hated\nhim. <i>Cataclysm: Ultimate Spider-Man</i>\nis not a bad read all things considered. It tells its story concisely and never\nloses focus of its characters in relation to the catastrophe. The downside is that you have to read\nthe rest of the <i>Cataclysm</i> series to\nknow what was going on. I\u2019d probably recommend you read it, especially since it\nties into two issues of <i>The Ultimate\nSpider-Man</i>.\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3f98ca4c539ca6ee43e918c739d7d36c/tumblr_inline_pm60csdqzY1s8x54y_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><p>The conflict between Miles and Jefferson is left hanging\nuntil issues #8 and #9 of <i>Miles Morales: The\nUltimate Spider-Man</i> \u2013 also known as \u201cThe Only Redeeming Thing About This\nComic Book Title\u201d. The eighth and ninth issues of MMTUSM sees Jefferson Davis\nfinally owning up to his past and basically just spilling the beans about his\nlife as a criminal with Aaron and how he became involved with S.H.I.E.L.D.\nduring the 80s \u2013 when <i>Miami Vice</i>,\nJerri Curls, <i>House Party</i> Flattops,\nand ill-fitting suits with shoulder pads were all the rage \u2013 and how he met a\nyoung, already-at-it, Nick Fury.\u00a0</p><p>The complete tonal and visual shift in the issues are a\nwelcome respite from the Peter Parker nonsense of the previous seven. The story\narc, \u201cMiles Morales: An Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.?\u201d, carries with it the kind\u2019ve of\nvisual flair I see a Tim Sale illustrated graphic novel (like <i>Spider-Man: Blue</i> or <i>The Long Halloween</i>), but it\u2019s still David Marquez illustrating the\nstory from beginning to end.\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b09905c9ac4de453963f3be5e8fd66c3/tumblr_inline_pm5y1rdUZ51s8x54y_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><p>It\u2019s got the look and feel of a pulp novel, or one\nof those old newspaper comic strips where the spots of the print were obvious\nthrough the inking and character sketches. The narrative, which sees Jefferson and\nAaron working for smalltime criminals to Jefferson\u2019s eventual graduation to\nprotecting the Kingpin (with a minor explanation as to why he loathes mutants),\nis, in my opinion, the highlight of a story that could\u2019ve worked as a\nfull-fledged miniseries about the Jefferson brothers.</p><p>My only quibble with the framing of the narrative is that\nthe early inclusion of S.H.I.E.L.D makes Jefferson look more like the unwilling\nparticipant of crime he was manipulated into thinking he had to do for \u201cthe\ngreater good\u201d, as opposed to some young blood who didn\u2019t give much thought to\nright or wrong (which is how the early issues framed it) before he had an\nepiphany. I always assumed the crime came first, then S.H.I.E.L.D, then Rio.\nHonestly, if you\u2019re at all interested in this storyline, just look for the\nsingle issues and don\u2019t buy the trade.

I mean, that\u2019s what\nhappened after all.</p><p>You know shit it bad when Marvel wants you to pity [white]\ncharacters like Grant Ward of <i>Agents of\nS.H.I.E.L.D</i> for joining a Neo-Nazi group, despite the repeated and angry\naffirmations of protagonist Daisy Johnson, who flat-out reminds the audience,\n\u201cYou are a Nazi if you join Hydra\u201d, who is undermined anyway by the narrative that\ncontinues to bleat, \u201cpity the Neo-Nazi.\u201d</p><p>Brian Michael Bendis, in all his infinite lack of wisdom,\ndecides \u2013 the biggest way to differ Miles Morales\u2019 love life from Peter Parker\u2019s,\nis make an underdeveloped character, his girlfriend, Ultimate Kate Bishop, a\nmember of Hydra. Miles\u2019 white girlfriend rides on the agenda of the Aryan Ideal\nand white supremacy. <i>Brilliant.</i></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c1f6741819311b1ac03df8f833e81082/tumblr_inline_pm61c7wUWc1s8x54y_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><p><i>The Ultimate\nSpider-Man</i> issues, #1-#4 and #7 prelude the last four issues with Miles\ndeliberating whether or not he should tell Katie Bishop about his double life\nas Spider-Man.

He\ndoes it anyway, Katie panics and runs away.\u00a0</p><p>The aforementioned issues give the reader a glimpse into\nKate\u2019s life with the Bishops, with one conversation with her older sister\ncasually mentioning that \u201cthey\u201d would have to kill Miles and the seventh issue\nconcludes with her uttering the phrase, \u201cHail Hydra.\u201d</p><p>If <i>The Ultimate Spider-Man</i>\nhad something to say about the issue of Nazism, especially in relation to\nMiles\u2019 life as a Black teen \u2013 or the cautionary tale of \u201cyou never know someone\nuntil\u2026\u201d, then I could maybe understand the decision to make Kate Bishop (a\nwildly popular Avenger in the 616 universe, be she an adult or a teenager) a\nNazi. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"256\" data-orig-width=\"569\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2d1b8116d8804c5bea844f7ac3ed29b3/tumblr_inline_pm621uBQmH1s8x54y_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"256\" data-orig-width=\"569\"></figure><p>But, it doesn\u2019t, it basically does exactly the same thing <i>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D</i> does with the\nDaisy Johnson/Grant Ward dynamic. The narrative depicts a \u201cSympathetic Nazi\u201d\n(Katie) trying to explain their position, and a furious significant other\n(Miles) outright declaring their relationship is over. Only, where AOS more or\nless dragged that subplot out to its natural conclusion (\u201cSympathetic Nazi\u201d isn\u2019t\nreally sympathetic and dies),\u00a0</p><p><i>The\nUltimate Spider-Man</i> did nothing to that extent. Readers barely have gotten\nto known Katie Bishop since her introduction in issue #23 of UCSM. She was given\nno time actually to be anything other than \u201cMiles Morales\u2019 girlfriend\u201d. And\nwhen it comes right down to it, the Hydra subplot was nothing but an excuse to\nbring Dr. Doom into the narrative at the last moment. So, the \u201cMy Girlfriend is\na Nazi\u201d storyline just falls flat.</p><p>On a smaller note, the way the last couple issues decide to\nuse Judge \u2013 the minor character from <i>Ultimate\nComics Spider-Man</i> \u2013 is sigh inducing. It\u2019s like Bendis realized his book\nwas coming to an end and figured the best way to a handle a character that\nbarely had any face time since the first twelve issues of the UCSM, is to just\nplop him in the middle of the story with his already knowing Miles is\nSpider-Man.\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1690633a080fa23f33285666834a81a8/tumblr_inline_pm628q3Szi1s8x54y_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><p>But, he does it in a way that, if you removed him from the story,\nnothing would change.

It reminded me why I stopped reading his\ntitle four years ago, and knowing that none of his recent stuff isn\u2019t any good\neither kinda makes me glad I made the decision so early on.</p></p>",

There\u2019s very little difference\nbetween the two when you get to the nitty-gritty) attempting to destroy the\n1610 universe and devour it all. You get the distinct feeling that, before\nsomeone came up with <i>Secret Wars</i>, <i>Cataclysm</i> was meant to be the true end\nof the Ultimate Universe \u2013 but someone upstairs changed their mind and rendered\nit to a mere false start. Long story short: The grand majority \u2013 if not all of\n\u2013 the Ultimates (the Avengers of the 1610 universe) are killed or sent into the\nvoid with Galactus by Ultimate Shadowcat \u2013 who is later hailed savior of the\nworld. The All-New Ultimates are formed.\u00a0</p><p><i>Das it.</i>\u00a0</p><p>But, within Miles\u2019 slice of the <i>Cataclysm</i> story, Bendis finally decides to focus on the elephant in\nthe room: Jefferson Davis and his open and his fantasy xenophobia toward superhumans\nand how it has literally silenced his own son from admitting to his double life\nas Spider-Man. Moreso since the death of his mother, Rio Morales, at the hands\nof Ultimate Venom. I\u2019ll be perfectly honest \u2013 I don\u2019t think Jefferson Davis is\na great guy \u2013 I actually ended up liking his no-account brother (Aaron Davis,\ngone too soon) far more because he was upfront about his ideals and his mission\nstatement. He never pretended or tried to be a better person. He was just\nrotten and enjoyed it.</p><p>For that one piece of sage advice Jefferson offered Miles in\nthe earliest tenure of his first title, Jefferson is the perfect example of a\nman who expects his son to \u201cdo as he says, and as I do\u201d, but expects no\nconsequences visited upon him whenever he dehumanizes people. He\u2019s a walking\nmetaphor for the heterosexual Black father who spews homophobic slurs in casual\nconversation around their gay daughter or son and I\u2019m sure as hell that was\nintentional despite the incompatibility of the allegory.<br></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/79a6c3d44c89afae904d387062fc5e92/tumblr_inline_pm5xpqopxH1s8x54y_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><p><i>Cataclysm: Ultimate Spider-Man</i>\ndoesn\u2019t do much to repair his character, if anything it makes him thrice times worse.\nWhen Galactus starts wrecking all of New York City and Brooklyn, Miles,\nBombshell (Lana Baumgartner) and Cloak and Dagger, struggle to save the people\ncaught in the monster\u2019s wake \u2013 all while recounting where they were when the <i>Ultimatum</i> event occurred. </p><p>In Miles\u2019 flashback, we see Jefferson lose his head over the\nknowledge that the title wave was caused by a mutant (Magneto), all while\nloudly proclaiming everyone stuck in traffic was going to die. The most\nimportant nugget of information taken away from Miles\u2019 flashback is the\nknowledge that his father more or less promised that he would abandon or disown\nMiles if he ever found out his son (then, probably only 11 or 12 years old at\nthe time) was a superhuman.\u00a0</p><p>I never had much sympathy for Davis (I tolerated\nhim because of Rio), but the moment Miles tries to convince his father to come\nwith him out of the city to safety, and Jefferson decides to blame a now\nfourteen year old Miles for the death of Rio and Aaron, I just outright hated\nhim. <i>Cataclysm: Ultimate Spider-Man</i>\nis not a bad read all things considered. It tells its story concisely and never\nloses focus of its characters in relation to the catastrophe. The downside is that you have to read\nthe rest of the <i>Cataclysm</i> series to\nknow what was going on. I\u2019d probably recommend you read it, especially since it\nties into two issues of <i>The Ultimate\nSpider-Man</i>.\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3f98ca4c539ca6ee43e918c739d7d36c/tumblr_inline_pm60csdqzY1s8x54y_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><p>The conflict between Miles and Jefferson is left hanging\nuntil issues #8 and #9 of <i>Miles Morales: The\nUltimate Spider-Man</i> \u2013 also known as \u201cThe Only Redeeming Thing About This\nComic Book Title\u201d.

The story\narc, \u201cMiles Morales: An Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.?\u201d, carries with it the kind\u2019ve of\nvisual flair I see a Tim Sale illustrated graphic novel (like <i>Spider-Man: Blue</i> or <i>The Long Halloween</i>), but it\u2019s still David Marquez illustrating the\nstory from beginning to end.\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b09905c9ac4de453963f3be5e8fd66c3/tumblr_inline_pm5y1rdUZ51s8x54y_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><p>It\u2019s got the look and feel of a pulp novel, or one\nof those old newspaper comic strips where the spots of the print were obvious\nthrough the inking and character sketches. The narrative, which sees Jefferson and\nAaron working for smalltime criminals to Jefferson\u2019s eventual graduation to\nprotecting the Kingpin (with a minor explanation as to why he loathes mutants),\nis, in my opinion, the highlight of a story that could\u2019ve worked as a\nfull-fledged miniseries about the Jefferson brothers.</p><p>My only quibble with the framing of the narrative is that\nthe early inclusion of S.H.I.E.L.D makes Jefferson look more like the unwilling\nparticipant of crime he was manipulated into thinking he had to do for \u201cthe\ngreater good\u201d, as opposed to some young blood who didn\u2019t give much thought to\nright or wrong (which is how the early issues framed it) before he had an\nepiphany. I always assumed the crime came first, then S.H.I.E.L.D, then Rio.\nHonestly, if you\u2019re at all interested in this storyline, just look for the\nsingle issues and don\u2019t buy the trade.

The narrative depicts a \u201cSympathetic Nazi\u201d\n(Katie) trying to explain their position, and a furious significant other\n(Miles) outright declaring their relationship is over. Only, where AOS more or\nless dragged that subplot out to its natural conclusion (\u201cSympathetic Nazi\u201d isn\u2019t\nreally sympathetic and dies),\u00a0</p><p><i>The\nUltimate Spider-Man</i> did nothing to that extent. Readers barely have gotten\nto known Katie Bishop since her introduction in issue #23 of UCSM. She was given\nno time actually to be anything other than \u201cMiles Morales\u2019 girlfriend\u201d. And\nwhen it comes right down to it, the Hydra subplot was nothing but an excuse to\nbring Dr. Doom into the narrative at the last moment. So, the \u201cMy Girlfriend is\na Nazi\u201d storyline just falls flat.</p><p>On a smaller note, the way the last couple issues decide to\nuse Judge \u2013 the minor character from <i>Ultimate\nComics Spider-Man</i> \u2013 is sigh inducing. It\u2019s like Bendis realized his book\nwas coming to an end and figured the best way to a handle a character that\nbarely had any face time since the first twelve issues of the UCSM, is to just\nplop him in the middle of the story with his already knowing Miles is\nSpider-Man.\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1690633a080fa23f33285666834a81a8/tumblr_inline_pm628q3Szi1s8x54y_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"281\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><p>But, he does it in a way that, if you removed him from the story,\nnothing would change.

There&rsquo;s very little difference\nbetween the two when you get to the nitty-gritty) attempting to destroy the\n1610 universe and devour it all. You get the distinct feeling that, before\nsomeone came up with <i>Secret Wars</i>, <i>Cataclysm</i> was meant to be the true end\nof the Ultimate Universe &ndash; but someone upstairs changed their mind and rendered\nit to a mere false start. Long story short: The grand majority &ndash; if not all of\n&ndash; the Ultimates (the Avengers of the 1610 universe) are killed or sent into the\nvoid with Galactus by Ultimate Shadowcat &ndash; who is later hailed savior of the\nworld. The All-New Ultimates are formed.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Das it.</i>&nbsp;</p><p>But, within Miles&rsquo; slice of the <i>Cataclysm</i> story, Bendis finally decides to focus on the elephant in\nthe room: Jefferson Davis and his open and his fantasy xenophobia toward superhumans\nand how it has literally silenced his own son from admitting to his double life\nas Spider-Man. Moreso since the death of his mother, Rio Morales, at the hands\nof Ultimate Venom. I&rsquo;ll be perfectly honest &ndash; I don&rsquo;t think Jefferson Davis is\na great guy &ndash; I actually ended up liking his no-account brother (Aaron Davis,\ngone too soon) far more because he was upfront about his ideals and his mission\nstatement. He never pretended or tried to be a better person. He was just\nrotten and enjoyed it.</p><p>For that one piece of sage advice Jefferson offered Miles in\nthe earliest tenure of his first title, Jefferson is the perfect example of a\nman who expects his son to &ldquo;do as he says, and as I do&rdquo;, but expects no\nconsequences visited upon him whenever he dehumanizes people. He&rsquo;s a walking\nmetaphor for the heterosexual Black father who spews homophobic slurs in casual\nconversation around their gay daughter or son and I&rsquo;m sure as hell that was\nintentional despite the incompatibility of the allegory.<br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/79a6c3d44c89afae904d387062fc5e92/tumblr_inline_pm5xpqopxH1s8x54y_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><i>Cataclysm: Ultimate Spider-Man</i>\ndoesn&rsquo;t do much to repair his character, if anything it makes him thrice times worse.\nWhen Galactus starts wrecking all of New York City and Brooklyn, Miles,\nBombshell (Lana Baumgartner) and Cloak and Dagger, struggle to save the people\ncaught in the monster&rsquo;s wake &ndash; all while recounting where they were when the <i>Ultimatum</i> event occurred. </p><p>In Miles&rsquo; flashback, we see Jefferson lose his head over the\nknowledge that the title wave was caused by a mutant (Magneto), all while\nloudly proclaiming everyone stuck in traffic was going to die. The most\nimportant nugget of information taken away from Miles&rsquo; flashback is the\nknowledge that his father more or less promised that he would abandon or disown\nMiles if he ever found out his son (then, probably only 11 or 12 years old at\nthe time) was a superhuman.&nbsp;</p><p>I never had much sympathy for Davis (I tolerated\nhim because of Rio), but the moment Miles tries to convince his father to come\nwith him out of the city to safety, and Jefferson decides to blame a now\nfourteen year old Miles for the death of Rio and Aaron, I just outright hated\nhim. <i>Cataclysm: Ultimate Spider-Man</i>\nis not a bad read all things considered. It tells its story concisely and never\nloses focus of its characters in relation to the catastrophe. The downside is that you have to read\nthe rest of the <i>Cataclysm</i> series to\nknow what was going on. I&rsquo;d probably recommend you read it, especially since it\nties into two issues of <i>The Ultimate\nSpider-Man</i>.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3f98ca4c539ca6ee43e918c739d7d36c/tumblr_inline_pm60csdqzY1s8x54y_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>The conflict between Miles and Jefferson is left hanging\nuntil issues #8 and #9 of <i>Miles Morales: The\nUltimate Spider-Man</i> &ndash; also known as &ldquo;The Only Redeeming Thing About This\nComic Book Title&rdquo;. The eighth and ninth issues of MMTUSM sees Jefferson Davis\nfinally owning up to his past and basically just spilling the beans about his\nlife as a criminal with Aaron and how he became involved with S.H.I.E.L.D.\nduring the 80s &ndash; when <i>Miami Vice</i>,\nJerri Curls, <i>House Party</i> Flattops,\nand ill-fitting suits with shoulder pads were all the rage &ndash; and how he met a\nyoung, already-at-it, Nick Fury.&nbsp;</p><p>The complete tonal and visual shift in the issues are a\nwelcome respite from the Peter Parker nonsense of the previous seven.

The narrative, which sees Jefferson and\nAaron working for smalltime criminals to Jefferson&rsquo;s eventual graduation to\nprotecting the Kingpin (with a minor explanation as to why he loathes mutants),\nis, in my opinion, the highlight of a story that could&rsquo;ve worked as a\nfull-fledged miniseries about the Jefferson brothers.</p><p>My only quibble with the framing of the narrative is that\nthe early inclusion of S.H.I.E.L.D makes Jefferson look more like the unwilling\nparticipant of crime he was manipulated into thinking he had to do for &ldquo;the\ngreater good&rdquo;, as opposed to some young blood who didn&rsquo;t give much thought to\nright or wrong (which is how the early issues framed it) before he had an\nepiphany. I always assumed the crime came first, then S.H.I.E.L.D, then Rio.\nHonestly, if you&rsquo;re at all interested in this storyline, just look for the\nsingle issues and don&rsquo;t buy the trade.

So, the &ldquo;My Girlfriend is\na Nazi&rdquo; storyline just falls flat.</p><p>On a smaller note, the way the last couple issues decide to\nuse Judge &ndash; the minor character from <i>Ultimate\nComics Spider-Man</i> &ndash; is sigh inducing. It&rsquo;s like Bendis realized his book\nwas coming to an end and figured the best way to a handle a character that\nbarely had any face time since the first twelve issues of the UCSM, is to just\nplop him in the middle of the story with his already knowing Miles is\nSpider-Man.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1690633a080fa23f33285666834a81a8/tumblr_inline_pm628q3Szi1s8x54y_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>But, he does it in a way that, if you removed him from the story,\nnothing would change.

He had been\nlucky he was immune. But mistakes are made and this was, sadly\nenough, a more common occurrence than you might think.</p><p>The\nonly difference between now and other times were that all the\nAvengers were back together again. That had been strange at first,\nbut Peter was getting used to coming to the compound only to see\nCaptain America chilling with Natasha on the couch or Clint reading a\nbook whilst hanging upside-down out of a vent. \n</p><p>Today\nit were Scott and Clint eating a snack in the kitchen. Peter had\ngreeted them and gotten his apple when everything went to shit. He\nbit and felt some venom seeping on his apple.
