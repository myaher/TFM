Along with the fact that watching Harry act like such a gentleman around all your family when you knew how dirty he could be was admittedly a turn on.</p><p>It\u2019d crossed your mind more than once to sneak into the bathroom with him when he went to shower, specifically when he\u2019d texted you to bring him clothes when he forgot to take them to the bathroom, opening the door wearing nothing but a towel, his curly hair wet and flopped carelessly to the side and dripping down onto his chest. For the first few days you\u2019d controlled yourself, heeding Harry\u2019s earlier warning, but eventually it all got too much and you sent Harry a photo of your boobs just after you\u2019d gotten out of the shower just to get a reaction out of him. Another time you came downstairs to wake him up and crawled in bed with him, leaving kisses along his neck and nipping every once in awhile in the hopes he\u2019d take you to the bathroom and bend you over the sink. </p><p>There were a few dirty jokes tossed around between the two of you, mostly when you played a game where you had to wink at your teammate to let them know they were on your team and they would have to glance at a location so you could deliver the package and win. One time when you got caught winking at each other you\u2019d exclaimed \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like that, I was just trying to wink at him! Deliver the package, y\u2019know.\u201d resulting in a wave of shocked laughter and Harry smiling and blushing into his hands.</p><p>Harry winking at you shouldn\u2019t have set you off like it did, but everytime he did he would have this cocky smirk on his face like he knew what he was doing to you, and the truth was he did. All week he would do little things to tease you subtly and all you could think about was the sweet, sweet revenge you\u2019d get next time you spent Christmas with his family. </p><p>When it was time to go home, the ride to the airport, the plane ride and the car ride home were all silent, except for a few comments to each other about what to eat and such. You weren\u2019t sure what to do, you weren\u2019t even sure he remembered what happened in the parking lot of the Ross or if he did and he was just holding off to tease you, but regardless all the waiting was driving you crazy.</p><p>When you arrived back to your shared apartment it was still quiet, you looked at Harry expectantly as he toed his shoes off next to the door, but he just raised his eyebrows at you as he walked to the bedroom with a handful of the gifts the two of you had gotten. You followed and watched as he set them down in their respective places, gift cards in the dresser, clothes in the closet, your hands sat in your lap waiting patiently for an order that never came. That night he walked into the room after a shower and crawled in bed with you, turning off the lamp and turning on his side. You cuddled up to him, rubbing his chest lightly and drawing small shapes until you both fell asleep in eachothers arms.</p><p>The next day Harry had some recording to do at the studio and you tagged along, which turned out not to be a great idea as hearing him sing and the faces he made while doing so just made the itch in your stomach worse. He looked like he was enjoying himself and all you could think about was wrapping your lips around his cock as you stare up at him and watch as his face contorted in pleasure. </p><p>The day after that was the same, you went out to lunch with his team and couldn\u2019t keep your eyes off him. Eventually you decided to make a move, placing a hand on his thigh, he let it sit there until you slid your hand up, resulting in him grabbing your wrist and lightly digging his nails into your skin before placing your hand back in your lap. You spent the next few minutes building up the courage to do what you were about to, glancing at him and around the table to make sure no one was paying much attention. If Harry was mad when you grabbed his thigh he was pissed when you grabbed his bulge and rubbed lightly and it showed as he grabbed your wrist again and dug his nails in harder this time, actually taking the time to look at you before placing your hand in your lap and leaving a squeezing hand on your thigh as a reminder to behave. You were sure that you\u2019d earned yourself something, but that night there was still nothing.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until the third day that you decided to take matters into your own hands, putting on a lacey red lingerie set he bought for you last valentines day that you knew drove him crazy under your usually sweatpants and crop top. Today was perfect for what you wanted, a lazy day at home usually spent cuddled up and watching movies, but this time you had something else in mind.</p><p>You walked out of the room, seeing Harry standing in the kitchen making tea. You walk up to him, hugging and staring up at him.</p><p>\u201cHi baby.\u201d You mumble</p><p>\u201cHi angel.\u201d Harry replies, placing his hand on your lower back to pull you closer and leaving a kiss on your forehead. You bite your lip, leaning up for a kiss and smiling when he leaned down to give you what you wanted. You put your hand on the back of his neck to hold him to your lips, standing on your tippy toes to reach his mouth, the two of you swaying lightly as you kissed. As nice as the moment was, you decided to end it by moving his hand under your shirt so he could feel your bra and biting down lightly on his lip.</p><p>Harry freezes for a second when he feels the lace of your bra, pulling away but staying close to your lips. When you opened your eyes Harry looked a little shocked, but mostly pissed, a subtle smirk playing on your lips as you pull off and begin to walk away. You didn\u2019t get far before Harry was grabbing your arm and dragging you to the bedroom, sitting you on the bed and standing in front of you. You once again avoided his gaze, staring at his shirt instead, too scared to even try and look him in the eyes. </p><p>\u201cWha\u2019s your problem, hm?\u201d He snapped, grabbing your chin and tilting your head up to look at him \u201cActing like a little fucking tease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the tease? You were teasing me the entire time we were at my aunt\u2019s,\u201d You respond boldly, gaining some confidence as you stared up into his eyes \u201cI was just trying to get what you basically promised me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t promise you anythin\u2019, pet, and you better watch that tone, s\u2019not my fault you\u2019re entitled. Is that it? You think I owe you a fucking just because you can\u2019t keep your mind off my dick, eh? Think you can just put on some lingerie and everything will be as you wish? Don\u2019t think I\u2019ve forgotten what a horny little slut you were being, sending me a picture of your tits knowing damn well someone could\u2019ve seen, or what about when you told me in front of everybody you wanted to get off on my leg.\u201d He paused, your legs were now clamped together in a desperate attempt to suppress some of the pressure \u201cJust like I said before, don\u2019t know how to follow orders, told you to behave and instead you were teasing me at every chance you got, even grabbed my dick in the middle of a restaurant. Need to be taught a lesson, think I\u2019ll have to remind you who\u2019s in charge.\u201d Harry says, taking a step closer to you and licking his lips.</p><p>Whatever confidence you had gained was gone now and you felt totally submissive staring into his lust filled eyes. He pushes you so your back is against the bed, kissing you hastily as your hands shoot up to his neck, he grabs your wrists and lightly pins them above your head, knowing you like it better when he\u2019s rough.</p><p>\u201cSince you think it\u2019s okay to grope daddy in public, no touching.\u201d He whispers in your ear as he attacks your neck with harsh kisses, pausing every once in awhile to leave a mark. He lifts your shirt up, running his hands along your sides until the tips of his fingers meet the lace of your bra, moving one of his hands forward to grope you lightly and tangling the other in to your hair. You push your hips up into his, feeling his bulge brush against your clothed core as he let out a quiet moan, giving a harsh smack to your ass.</p><p>\u201cOn your knees.\u201d He demanded, as he stood there he must\u2019ve decided you were taking too long as he grabbed you by your hair and pulled you off the bed, forcing you down to your knees, clearly done with your bullshit. You stand on your knees, glancing up at him as you go to undo his pants to check if it\u2019s okay, unbuttoning them and pulling them to the floor when he nodded his head. His hand still in your hair, he buries your face in his bulge, you smirk and stick your tongue out to lick him over his underwear causing him to groan and pull you away. </p><p>Harry slides his underwear down the rest of the way, hissing lightly as he freed his member from the confinements of the cloth prison and stroking himself a few times lightly before putting the tip at your mouth. You open your mouth, licking at the tip and only taking it in your mouth when Harry glared down at you, swirling your tongue around it as you suck lightly. The view just as good as you imagined as you stare up at him innocently. </p><p>You begin to take more of him into your mouth, gagging lightly when he\u2019d hit the back of your throat.Harry let out soft moans, bucking his hips lightly and pushing himself further down your throat. You get an idea, deciding to do something you\u2019d never managed to do with Harry before and trying to take all of him in your mouth. Everytime you tried before Harry would tell you it\u2019s okay and you don\u2019t have to, that he didn\u2019t want you to choke, but this time you were determined. </p><p>Pulling away to take a breath you swallow the spit that built up in your mouth before putting his tip back in your mouth and slowly working your way down his cock. Tears pricked at your eyes as you tried to control your gag reflex as you force him down your throat. You close your eyes, focusing on his moans and moving your hand up to hold his hips.</p><p>You were confused when Harry pulled you off just as you were about to take all of him, pulling you up and throwing you against the bed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know how to fucking listen do you, pet?\u201d He says pulling you to the edge of the bed by your legs. </p><p>\u201cWh-what do you mean?\u201d You say, furrowing your eyebrows, Harry sighs and shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cNo touching, I fucking told you, and you were doing so well. On top of that, you were teasing me and I let it slide, but you still misbehaved, knowing better than to force me down your throat and to top it all off you forgot to address me as daddy.\u201d He explains, shaking his head and sitting next to you, picking you up and bending you over his lap. You let out a shaky breath, knowing what\u2019s coming.</p><p>\u201cNow, let\u2019s see if you atleast remember why we do those things so I can decide how severe of a punishment i should give you.\u201d He says, massaging your ass.</p><p>\u201cNo touching because I grabbed your dick at lunch the other day, no teasing because i\u2019m not in charge, I can\u2019t take too much of you because I might get hurt and I call you daddy because you\u2019re in charge,\u201d your voice muffled by his thigh as you explain quickly, going to defend yourself \u201cbut daddy, I wanted to make you feel good and&ndash;\u201d your sentence is cut off by a harsh smack to your ass followed by his large hand massaging the spot.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019 ask for explanation, now did I? Count, or am I gonna have to punish you for that too.\u201d He says, smacking your ass again, sending a spark between your legs.</p><p>\u201cOne.\u201d you breathe out, trying not to squirm around too much. He kept going, all the way until twenty, when he delivered a particularly hard smack. He motions for you to sit up, to which you do, standing on your knees as your ass was surely as red as a tomato and would hurt to sit on. </p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d You say, wiping away some of the tears that made their way down your face. Harry gives you a small pout, putting his hand in your hair and giving you a slow kiss which you whine softly into.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAss hurts.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAwh, does it?\u201d He asks, looking concerned as you nod. He gives another harsh smack to your ass \u201cMaybe if you listened your ass wouldn\u2019t hurt.\u201d He says in a condescending tone, sitting you down and pulling off your top and pants. You whimper at the feeling of the cool bed sheets against your burning red ass, lifting your hips to help Harry get your pants off. </p><p>Once he\u2019s got them both off, he climbs on top, rubbing his thumb across your cheek as he kisses you. As the kiss goes on and gets more heated he lightly grinds his hips into yours, a harsh hand grabbing at your thigh as he kisses from the side of your mouth to your jawline, down your neck and over your lace covered breasts, along your stomach and stopping only when his soft pink lips met the hem of your underwear. </p><p>Harry runs his hand from your knee to the inner part of your thigh, pulling the band and letting it flick against your skin. He moves his hands so that they\u2019re wrapped around your thighs and he\u2019s holding your legs open as he leaves wet kisses along your thigh. Once he\u2019s made his way down to the dip between your legs and your core, he begins a routine of little sucks, bites and licks in that order. </p><p>When Harry stops kissing at your thigh you assume he\u2019s going to pull your underwear down, his face hovering over your clothed core and purposely breathing through his mouth so you can feel his warm breath on your wet pussy, but instead he moves to the other thigh and continues his routine of kissing down it and then sucking, biting and licking, holding your hips down each time you would try to buck up and get more than what he was giving you. When he\u2019s done with that thigh he licks over the lace, tasting where you juices had leaked through your underwear and moaning at your taste, kissing lightly against you.</p><p>\u201cHarry, please just&ndash; give me something.\u201d You beg, whining and bucking up your hips again. He sighs, but stands up, grabbing the hem of your underwear and pulling it down roughly.</p><p>\u201cSuch a whiny little slut, so fucking impatient I can\u2019t even take my time, can\u2019t wait for me to fuck you, hm? Have to beg for me hurry up and touch you? Fucking lucky I\u2019m even giving in, could\u2019ve waited so long, driven you insane.\u201d Harry rants, mostly to himself, before leaning back down and licking a slow stripe starting from your entrance and ending just before your clit, sucking harshly at the bundle of nerves. You moan out in pleasure, so glad to finally have some sort of relief.</p><p>It isn\u2019t long before Harry\u2019s fucking you with his tongue and moaning into you, sucking on your clit and licking you up and down before sticking his tongue back in. When his jaw began to hurt he used his middle finger instead, sticking it inside you and relishing in the noise you made, finger fucking you as he sucked at your clit. </p><p>\u201cFuck, another finger, daddy, want another finger inside me.\u201d You say as you began to get closer to the edge, Harry shook his head as he pulled away from you, popping his finger in his mouth and denying you your orgasm.</p><p>\u201cWho the fuck do you think you are, pet? Making demands like you run the place, begging me to fuck you instead of asking like a nice little girl.\u201d Harry says, grabbing his dick and running the tip through your soaking folds, groaning at the velvety feeling \u201cGuess I\u2019ll jus\u2019 have to fuck the attitude out of ya.\u201d He concludes, pushing into you slowly.</p><p>You moan as you feel Harry fill you up, trying to remember not to touch him as you buck your hips up into his.</p><p>\u201cSince you think your opinion is so important that you need to voice it at every little moment, wanna fuckin hear you. Want you to tell me what you think about me fuckin the brains out of ya, hm?\u201d Harry says, bringing up the pace gradually until his hips are slamming into yours and you\u2019re screaming his name. His hand moves from your boob to your throat has he lightly chokes you, both of your hands wrapping around his wrist and staring up at him as he fucks you like he has something prove, his other hand reaching down to play with your clit.</p><p>The mixture of Harry\u2019s hand around your throat, his dick pounding you, his hand playing with your clit, the sound of the headboard banging against the wall, the look on his face as he fucks you and the dirty thoughts in your mind all send you toppling over the edge, screaming out to let him know you\u2019re cumming.</p><p>\u201cCum on my cock, princess. Go ahead, fuckin earned it, sucking my cock so good. Gonna fucking behave now, aren\u2019t ya?\u201d He says, talking you through your orgasm, slowing down a little to let you catch your breath. </p><p>Harry\u2019s grip on your throat tightened as he neared his own release, letting out choked moans and half sentences before pulling out and releasing his load onto your stomach. You swipe some up on your finger and pop it into your mouth to taste him as you looked him in the eyes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even get me started.\u201d Harry says, out of breath and laughing lightly. You both sat in silence once again as you recovered from your orgasms, trying to catch your breath.</p><p>\u201cFuck, I\u2019ve been waiting for that for like a week.\u201d You say when he lays next to you, running your fingers through your hair and breaking the silence.</p><p>\u201cMe too, I almost broke when we were in the car.\u201d Harry mumbles, shaking his head and wiping the sweat from his forehead. You cuddle up to him and smile, running your hand across his stomach soothingly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLove you, handsome.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLove you, angel.\u201d\u00a0</p>",

You followed and watched as he set them down in their respective places, gift cards in the dresser, clothes in the closet, your hands sat in your lap waiting patiently for an order that never came. That night he walked into the room after a shower and crawled in bed with you, turning off the lamp and turning on his side. You cuddled up to him, rubbing his chest lightly and drawing small shapes until you both fell asleep in eachothers arms.</p><p>The next day Harry had some recording to do at the studio and you tagged along, which turned out not to be a great idea as hearing him sing and the faces he made while doing so just made the itch in your stomach worse. He looked like he was enjoying himself and all you could think about was wrapping your lips around his cock as you stare up at him and watch as his face contorted in pleasure. </p><p>The day after that was the same, you went out to lunch with his team and couldn\u2019t keep your eyes off him. Eventually you decided to make a move, placing a hand on his thigh, he let it sit there until you slid your hand up, resulting in him grabbing your wrist and lightly digging his nails into your skin before placing your hand back in your lap. You spent the next few minutes building up the courage to do what you were about to, glancing at him and around the table to make sure no one was paying much attention. If Harry was mad when you grabbed his thigh he was pissed when you grabbed his bulge and rubbed lightly and it showed as he grabbed your wrist again and dug his nails in harder this time, actually taking the time to look at you before placing your hand in your lap and leaving a squeezing hand on your thigh as a reminder to behave. You were sure that you\u2019d earned yourself something, but that night there was still nothing.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until the third day that you decided to take matters into your own hands, putting on a lacey red lingerie set he bought for you last valentines day that you knew drove him crazy under your usually sweatpants and crop top. Today was perfect for what you wanted, a lazy day at home usually spent cuddled up and watching movies, but this time you had something else in mind.</p><p>You walked out of the room, seeing Harry standing in the kitchen making tea. You walk up to him, hugging and staring up at him.</p><p>\u201cHi baby.\u201d You mumble</p><p>\u201cHi angel.\u201d Harry replies, placing his hand on your lower back to pull you closer and leaving a kiss on your forehead. You bite your lip, leaning up for a kiss and smiling when he leaned down to give you what you wanted. You put your hand on the back of his neck to hold him to your lips, standing on your tippy toes to reach his mouth, the two of you swaying lightly as you kissed. As nice as the moment was, you decided to end it by moving his hand under your shirt so he could feel your bra and biting down lightly on his lip.</p><p>Harry freezes for a second when he feels the lace of your bra, pulling away but staying close to your lips. When you opened your eyes Harry looked a little shocked, but mostly pissed, a subtle smirk playing on your lips as you pull off and begin to walk away. You didn\u2019t get far before Harry was grabbing your arm and dragging you to the bedroom, sitting you on the bed and standing in front of you. You once again avoided his gaze, staring at his shirt instead, too scared to even try and look him in the eyes. </p><p>\u201cWha\u2019s your problem, hm?\u201d He snapped, grabbing your chin and tilting your head up to look at him \u201cActing like a little fucking tease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the tease? You were teasing me the entire time we were at my aunt\u2019s,\u201d You respond boldly, gaining some confidence as you stared up into his eyes \u201cI was just trying to get what you basically promised me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t promise you anythin\u2019, pet, and you better watch that tone, s\u2019not my fault you\u2019re entitled. Is that it? You think I owe you a fucking just because you can\u2019t keep your mind off my dick, eh? Think you can just put on some lingerie and everything will be as you wish? Don\u2019t think I\u2019ve forgotten what a horny little slut you were being, sending me a picture of your tits knowing damn well someone could\u2019ve seen, or what about when you told me in front of everybody you wanted to get off on my leg.\u201d He paused, your legs were now clamped together in a desperate attempt to suppress some of the pressure \u201cJust like I said before, don\u2019t know how to follow orders, told you to behave and instead you were teasing me at every chance you got, even grabbed my dick in the middle of a restaurant. Need to be taught a lesson, think I\u2019ll have to remind you who\u2019s in charge.\u201d Harry says, taking a step closer to you and licking his lips.</p><p>Whatever confidence you had gained was gone now and you felt totally submissive staring into his lust filled eyes. He pushes you so your back is against the bed, kissing you hastily as your hands shoot up to his neck, he grabs your wrists and lightly pins them above your head, knowing you like it better when he\u2019s rough.</p><p>\u201cSince you think it\u2019s okay to grope daddy in public, no touching.\u201d He whispers in your ear as he attacks your neck with harsh kisses, pausing every once in awhile to leave a mark. He lifts your shirt up, running his hands along your sides until the tips of his fingers meet the lace of your bra, moving one of his hands forward to grope you lightly and tangling the other in to your hair. You push your hips up into his, feeling his bulge brush against your clothed core as he let out a quiet moan, giving a harsh smack to your ass.</p><p>\u201cOn your knees.\u201d He demanded, as he stood there he must\u2019ve decided you were taking too long as he grabbed you by your hair and pulled you off the bed, forcing you down to your knees, clearly done with your bullshit. You stand on your knees, glancing up at him as you go to undo his pants to check if it\u2019s okay, unbuttoning them and pulling them to the floor when he nodded his head. His hand still in your hair, he buries your face in his bulge, you smirk and stick your tongue out to lick him over his underwear causing him to groan and pull you away. </p><p>Harry slides his underwear down the rest of the way, hissing lightly as he freed his member from the confinements of the cloth prison and stroking himself a few times lightly before putting the tip at your mouth. You open your mouth, licking at the tip and only taking it in your mouth when Harry glared down at you, swirling your tongue around it as you suck lightly. The view just as good as you imagined as you stare up at him innocently. </p><p>You begin to take more of him into your mouth, gagging lightly when he\u2019d hit the back of your throat.Harry let out soft moans, bucking his hips lightly and pushing himself further down your throat. You get an idea, deciding to do something you\u2019d never managed to do with Harry before and trying to take all of him in your mouth. Everytime you tried before Harry would tell you it\u2019s okay and you don\u2019t have to, that he didn\u2019t want you to choke, but this time you were determined. </p><p>Pulling away to take a breath you swallow the spit that built up in your mouth before putting his tip back in your mouth and slowly working your way down his cock. Tears pricked at your eyes as you tried to control your gag reflex as you force him down your throat. You close your eyes, focusing on his moans and moving your hand up to hold his hips.</p><p>You were confused when Harry pulled you off just as you were about to take all of him, pulling you up and throwing you against the bed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know how to fucking listen do you, pet?\u201d He says pulling you to the edge of the bed by your legs. </p><p>\u201cWh-what do you mean?\u201d You say, furrowing your eyebrows, Harry sighs and shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cNo touching, I fucking told you, and you were doing so well. On top of that, you were teasing me and I let it slide, but you still misbehaved, knowing better than to force me down your throat and to top it all off you forgot to address me as daddy.\u201d He explains, shaking his head and sitting next to you, picking you up and bending you over his lap. You let out a shaky breath, knowing what\u2019s coming.</p><p>\u201cNow, let\u2019s see if you atleast remember why we do those things so I can decide how severe of a punishment i should give you.\u201d He says, massaging your ass.</p><p>\u201cNo touching because I grabbed your dick at lunch the other day, no teasing because i\u2019m not in charge, I can\u2019t take too much of you because I might get hurt and I call you daddy because you\u2019re in charge,\u201d your voice muffled by his thigh as you explain quickly, going to defend yourself \u201cbut daddy, I wanted to make you feel good and\u2013\u201d your sentence is cut off by a harsh smack to your ass followed by his large hand massaging the spot.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019 ask for explanation, now did I? Count, or am I gonna have to punish you for that too.\u201d He says, smacking your ass again, sending a spark between your legs.</p><p>\u201cOne.\u201d you breathe out, trying not to squirm around too much. He kept going, all the way until twenty, when he delivered a particularly hard smack. He motions for you to sit up, to which you do, standing on your knees as your ass was surely as red as a tomato and would hurt to sit on. </p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d You say, wiping away some of the tears that made their way down your face. Harry gives you a small pout, putting his hand in your hair and giving you a slow kiss which you whine softly into.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAss hurts.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAwh, does it?\u201d He asks, looking concerned as you nod. He gives another harsh smack to your ass \u201cMaybe if you listened your ass wouldn\u2019t hurt.\u201d He says in a condescending tone, sitting you down and pulling off your top and pants. You whimper at the feeling of the cool bed sheets against your burning red ass, lifting your hips to help Harry get your pants off. </p><p>Once he\u2019s got them both off, he climbs on top, rubbing his thumb across your cheek as he kisses you. As the kiss goes on and gets more heated he lightly grinds his hips into yours, a harsh hand grabbing at your thigh as he kisses from the side of your mouth to your jawline, down your neck and over your lace covered breasts, along your stomach and stopping only when his soft pink lips met the hem of your underwear. </p><p>Harry runs his hand from your knee to the inner part of your thigh, pulling the band and letting it flick against your skin. He moves his hands so that they\u2019re wrapped around your thighs and he\u2019s holding your legs open as he leaves wet kisses along your thigh. Once he\u2019s made his way down to the dip between your legs and your core, he begins a routine of little sucks, bites and licks in that order. </p><p>When Harry stops kissing at your thigh you assume he\u2019s going to pull your underwear down, his face hovering over your clothed core and purposely breathing through his mouth so you can feel his warm breath on your wet pussy, but instead he moves to the other thigh and continues his routine of kissing down it and then sucking, biting and licking, holding your hips down each time you would try to buck up and get more than what he was giving you. When he\u2019s done with that thigh he licks over the lace, tasting where you juices had leaked through your underwear and moaning at your taste, kissing lightly against you.</p><p>\u201cHarry, please just\u2013 give me something.\u201d You beg, whining and bucking up your hips again. He sighs, but stands up, grabbing the hem of your underwear and pulling it down roughly.</p><p>\u201cSuch a whiny little slut, so fucking impatient I can\u2019t even take my time, can\u2019t wait for me to fuck you, hm? Have to beg for me hurry up and touch you? Fucking lucky I\u2019m even giving in, could\u2019ve waited so long, driven you insane.\u201d Harry rants, mostly to himself, before leaning back down and licking a slow stripe starting from your entrance and ending just before your clit, sucking harshly at the bundle of nerves. You moan out in pleasure, so glad to finally have some sort of relief.</p><p>It isn\u2019t long before Harry\u2019s fucking you with his tongue and moaning into you, sucking on your clit and licking you up and down before sticking his tongue back in. When his jaw began to hurt he used his middle finger instead, sticking it inside you and relishing in the noise you made, finger fucking you as he sucked at your clit. </p><p>\u201cFuck, another finger, daddy, want another finger inside me.\u201d You say as you began to get closer to the edge, Harry shook his head as he pulled away from you, popping his finger in his mouth and denying you your orgasm.</p><p>\u201cWho the fuck do you think you are, pet? Making demands like you run the place, begging me to fuck you instead of asking like a nice little girl.\u201d Harry says, grabbing his dick and running the tip through your soaking folds, groaning at the velvety feeling \u201cGuess I\u2019ll jus\u2019 have to fuck the attitude out of ya.\u201d He concludes, pushing into you slowly.</p><p>You moan as you feel Harry fill you up, trying to remember not to touch him as you buck your hips up into his.</p><p>\u201cSince you think your opinion is so important that you need to voice it at every little moment, wanna fuckin hear you. Want you to tell me what you think about me fuckin the brains out of ya, hm?\u201d Harry says, bringing up the pace gradually until his hips are slamming into yours and you\u2019re screaming his name. His hand moves from your boob to your throat has he lightly chokes you, both of your hands wrapping around his wrist and staring up at him as he fucks you like he has something prove, his other hand reaching down to play with your clit.</p><p>The mixture of Harry\u2019s hand around your throat, his dick pounding you, his hand playing with your clit, the sound of the headboard banging against the wall, the look on his face as he fucks you and the dirty thoughts in your mind all send you toppling over the edge, screaming out to let him know you\u2019re cumming.</p><p>\u201cCum on my cock, princess. Go ahead, fuckin earned it, sucking my cock so good. Gonna fucking behave now, aren\u2019t ya?\u201d He says, talking you through your orgasm, slowing down a little to let you catch your breath. </p><p>Harry\u2019s grip on your throat tightened as he neared his own release, letting out choked moans and half sentences before pulling out and releasing his load onto your stomach. You swipe some up on your finger and pop it into your mouth to taste him as you looked him in the eyes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even get me started.\u201d Harry says, out of breath and laughing lightly. You both sat in silence once again as you recovered from your orgasms, trying to catch your breath.</p><p>\u201cFuck, I\u2019ve been waiting for that for like a week.\u201d You say when he lays next to you, running your fingers through your hair and breaking the silence.</p><p>\u201cMe too, I almost broke when we were in the car.\u201d Harry mumbles, shaking his head and wiping the sweat from his forehead. You cuddle up to him and smile, running your hand across his stomach soothingly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLove you, handsome.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLove you, angel.\u201d\u00a0</p></p>",

Along with the fact that watching Harry act like such a gentleman around all your family when you knew how dirty he could be was admittedly a turn on.</p><p>It\u2019d crossed your mind more than once to sneak into the bathroom with him when he went to shower, specifically when he\u2019d texted you to bring him clothes when he forgot to take them to the bathroom, opening the door wearing nothing but a towel, his curly hair wet and flopped carelessly to the side and dripping down onto his chest. For the first few days you\u2019d controlled yourself, heeding Harry\u2019s earlier warning, but eventually it all got too much and you sent Harry a photo of your boobs just after you\u2019d gotten out of the shower just to get a reaction out of him. Another time you came downstairs to wake him up and crawled in bed with him, leaving kisses along his neck and nipping every once in awhile in the hopes he\u2019d take you to the bathroom and bend you over the sink. </p><p>There were a few dirty jokes tossed around between the two of you, mostly when you played a game where you had to wink at your teammate to let them know they were on your team and they would have to glance at a location so you could deliver the package and win. One time when you got caught winking at each other you\u2019d exclaimed \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like that, I was just trying to wink at him! Deliver the package, y\u2019know.\u201d resulting in a wave of shocked laughter and Harry smiling and blushing into his hands.</p><p>Harry winking at you shouldn\u2019t have set you off like it did, but everytime he did he would have this cocky smirk on his face like he knew what he was doing to you, and the truth was he did. All week he would do little things to tease you subtly and all you could think about was the sweet, sweet revenge you\u2019d get next time you spent Christmas with his family. </p><p>When it was time to go home, the ride to the airport, the plane ride and the car ride home were all silent, except for a few comments to each other about what to eat and such. You weren\u2019t sure what to do, you weren\u2019t even sure he remembered what happened in the parking lot of the Ross or if he did and he was just holding off to tease you, but regardless all the waiting was driving you crazy.</p><p>When you arrived back to your shared apartment it was still quiet, you looked at Harry expectantly as he toed his shoes off next to the door, but he just raised his eyebrows at you as he walked to the bedroom with a handful of the gifts the two of you had gotten.

You cuddled up to him, rubbing his chest lightly and drawing small shapes until you both fell asleep in eachothers arms.</p><p>The next day Harry had some recording to do at the studio and you tagged along, which turned out not to be a great idea as hearing him sing and the faces he made while doing so just made the itch in your stomach worse.

You bite your lip, leaning up for a kiss and smiling when he leaned down to give you what you wanted. You put your hand on the back of his neck to hold him to your lips, standing on your tippy toes to reach his mouth, the two of you swaying lightly as you kissed.

You were teasing me the entire time we were at my aunt\u2019s,\u201d You respond boldly, gaining some confidence as you stared up into his eyes \u201cI was just trying to get what you basically promised me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t promise you anythin\u2019, pet, and you better watch that tone, s\u2019not my fault you\u2019re entitled. Is that it? You think I owe you a fucking just because you can\u2019t keep your mind off my dick, eh? Think you can just put on some lingerie and everything will be as you wish?

Need to be taught a lesson, think I\u2019ll have to remind you who\u2019s in charge.\u201d Harry says, taking a step closer to you and licking his lips.</p><p>Whatever confidence you had gained was gone now and you felt totally submissive staring into his lust filled eyes. He pushes you so your back is against the bed, kissing you hastily as your hands shoot up to his neck, he grabs your wrists and lightly pins them above your head, knowing you like it better when he\u2019s rough.</p><p>\u201cSince you think it\u2019s okay to grope daddy in public, no touching.\u201d He whispers in your ear as he attacks your neck with harsh kisses, pausing every once in awhile to leave a mark. He lifts your shirt up, running his hands along your sides until the tips of his fingers meet the lace of your bra, moving one of his hands forward to grope you lightly and tangling the other in to your hair. You push your hips up into his, feeling his bulge brush against your clothed core as he let out a quiet moan, giving a harsh smack to your ass.</p><p>\u201cOn your knees.\u201d He demanded, as he stood there he must\u2019ve decided you were taking too long as he grabbed you by your hair and pulled you off the bed, forcing you down to your knees, clearly done with your bullshit. You stand on your knees, glancing up at him as you go to undo his pants to check if it\u2019s okay, unbuttoning them and pulling them to the floor when he nodded his head. His hand still in your hair, he buries your face in his bulge, you smirk and stick your tongue out to lick him over his underwear causing him to groan and pull you away. </p><p>Harry slides his underwear down the rest of the way, hissing lightly as he freed his member from the confinements of the cloth prison and stroking himself a few times lightly before putting the tip at your mouth. You open your mouth, licking at the tip and only taking it in your mouth when Harry glared down at you, swirling your tongue around it as you suck lightly. The view just as good as you imagined as you stare up at him innocently. </p><p>You begin to take more of him into your mouth, gagging lightly when he\u2019d hit the back of your throat.Harry let out soft moans, bucking his hips lightly and pushing himself further down your throat. You get an idea, deciding to do something you\u2019d never managed to do with Harry before and trying to take all of him in your mouth. Everytime you tried before Harry would tell you it\u2019s okay and you don\u2019t have to, that he didn\u2019t want you to choke, but this time you were determined. </p><p>Pulling away to take a breath you swallow the spit that built up in your mouth before putting his tip back in your mouth and slowly working your way down his cock. Tears pricked at your eyes as you tried to control your gag reflex as you force him down your throat. You close your eyes, focusing on his moans and moving your hand up to hold his hips.</p><p>You were confused when Harry pulled you off just as you were about to take all of him, pulling you up and throwing you against the bed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know how to fucking listen do you, pet?\u201d He says pulling you to the edge of the bed by your legs. </p><p>\u201cWh-what do you mean?\u201d You say, furrowing your eyebrows, Harry sighs and shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cNo touching, I fucking told you, and you were doing so well. On top of that, you were teasing me and I let it slide, but you still misbehaved, knowing better than to force me down your throat and to top it all off you forgot to address me as daddy.\u201d He explains, shaking his head and sitting next to you, picking you up and bending you over his lap. You let out a shaky breath, knowing what\u2019s coming.</p><p>\u201cNow, let\u2019s see if you atleast remember why we do those things so I can decide how severe of a punishment i should give you.\u201d He says, massaging your ass.</p><p>\u201cNo touching because I grabbed your dick at lunch the other day, no teasing because i\u2019m not in charge, I can\u2019t take too much of you because I might get hurt and I call you daddy because you\u2019re in charge,\u201d your voice muffled by his thigh as you explain quickly, going to defend yourself \u201cbut daddy, I wanted to make you feel good and\u2013\u201d your sentence is cut off by a harsh smack to your ass followed by his large hand massaging the spot.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019 ask for explanation, now did I? Count, or am I gonna have to punish you for that too.\u201d He says, smacking your ass again, sending a spark between your legs.</p><p>\u201cOne.\u201d you breathe out, trying not to squirm around too much. He kept going, all the way until twenty, when he delivered a particularly hard smack. He motions for you to sit up, to which you do, standing on your knees as your ass was surely as red as a tomato and would hurt to sit on. </p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d You say, wiping away some of the tears that made their way down your face. Harry gives you a small pout, putting his hand in your hair and giving you a slow kiss which you whine softly into.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAss hurts.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAwh, does it?\u201d He asks, looking concerned as you nod. He gives another harsh smack to your ass \u201cMaybe if you listened your ass wouldn\u2019t hurt.\u201d He says in a condescending tone, sitting you down and pulling off your top and pants. You whimper at the feeling of the cool bed sheets against your burning red ass, lifting your hips to help Harry get your pants off. </p><p>Once he\u2019s got them both off, he climbs on top, rubbing his thumb across your cheek as he kisses you. As the kiss goes on and gets more heated he lightly grinds his hips into yours, a harsh hand grabbing at your thigh as he kisses from the side of your mouth to your jawline, down your neck and over your lace covered breasts, along your stomach and stopping only when his soft pink lips met the hem of your underwear. </p><p>Harry runs his hand from your knee to the inner part of your thigh, pulling the band and letting it flick against your skin. He moves his hands so that they\u2019re wrapped around your thighs and he\u2019s holding your legs open as he leaves wet kisses along your thigh. Once he\u2019s made his way down to the dip between your legs and your core, he begins a routine of little sucks, bites and licks in that order. </p><p>When Harry stops kissing at your thigh you assume he\u2019s going to pull your underwear down, his face hovering over your clothed core and purposely breathing through his mouth so you can feel his warm breath on your wet pussy, but instead he moves to the other thigh and continues his routine of kissing down it and then sucking, biting and licking, holding your hips down each time you would try to buck up and get more than what he was giving you. When he\u2019s done with that thigh he licks over the lace, tasting where you juices had leaked through your underwear and moaning at your taste, kissing lightly against you.</p><p>\u201cHarry, please just\u2013 give me something.\u201d You beg, whining and bucking up your hips again. He sighs, but stands up, grabbing the hem of your underwear and pulling it down roughly.</p><p>\u201cSuch a whiny little slut, so fucking impatient I can\u2019t even take my time, can\u2019t wait for me to fuck you, hm? Have to beg for me hurry up and touch you? Fucking lucky I\u2019m even giving in, could\u2019ve waited so long, driven you insane.\u201d Harry rants, mostly to himself, before leaning back down and licking a slow stripe starting from your entrance and ending just before your clit, sucking harshly at the bundle of nerves. You moan out in pleasure, so glad to finally have some sort of relief.</p><p>It isn\u2019t long before Harry\u2019s fucking you with his tongue and moaning into you, sucking on your clit and licking you up and down before sticking his tongue back in. When his jaw began to hurt he used his middle finger instead, sticking it inside you and relishing in the noise you made, finger fucking you as he sucked at your clit. </p><p>\u201cFuck, another finger, daddy, want another finger inside me.\u201d You say as you began to get closer to the edge, Harry shook his head as he pulled away from you, popping his finger in his mouth and denying you your orgasm.</p><p>\u201cWho the fuck do you think you are, pet? Making demands like you run the place, begging me to fuck you instead of asking like a nice little girl.\u201d Harry says, grabbing his dick and running the tip through your soaking folds, groaning at the velvety feeling \u201cGuess I\u2019ll jus\u2019 have to fuck the attitude out of ya.\u201d He concludes, pushing into you slowly.</p><p>You moan as you feel Harry fill you up, trying to remember not to touch him as you buck your hips up into his.</p><p>\u201cSince you think your opinion is so important that you need to voice it at every little moment, wanna fuckin hear you. Want you to tell me what you think about me fuckin the brains out of ya, hm?\u201d Harry says, bringing up the pace gradually until his hips are slamming into yours and you\u2019re screaming his name. His hand moves from your boob to your throat has he lightly chokes you, both of your hands wrapping around his wrist and staring up at him as he fucks you like he has something prove, his other hand reaching down to play with your clit.</p><p>The mixture of Harry\u2019s hand around your throat, his dick pounding you, his hand playing with your clit, the sound of the headboard banging against the wall, the look on his face as he fucks you and the dirty thoughts in your mind all send you toppling over the edge, screaming out to let him know you\u2019re cumming.</p><p>\u201cCum on my cock, princess. Go ahead, fuckin earned it, sucking my cock so good. Gonna fucking behave now, aren\u2019t ya?\u201d He says, talking you through your orgasm, slowing down a little to let you catch your breath. </p><p>Harry\u2019s grip on your throat tightened as he neared his own release, letting out choked moans and half sentences before pulling out and releasing his load onto your stomach. You swipe some up on your finger and pop it into your mouth to taste him as you looked him in the eyes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even get me started.\u201d Harry says, out of breath and laughing lightly. You both sat in silence once again as you recovered from your orgasms, trying to catch your breath.</p><p>\u201cFuck, I\u2019ve been waiting for that for like a week.\u201d You say when he lays next to you, running your fingers through your hair and breaking the silence.</p><p>\u201cMe too, I almost broke when we were in the car.\u201d Harry mumbles, shaking his head and wiping the sweat from his forehead. You cuddle up to him and smile, running your hand across his stomach soothingly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLove you, handsome.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLove you, angel.\u201d\u00a0</p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h1>Milkshakes and more Pt.2</h1><p>NSFW smutty asf woops&nbsp;</p><p>3k+ words</p><p>triggers: daddy kink, spanking&nbsp;</p><p>The following days consisted of you driving yourself mad, Harry was touch starving you, the only time he&rsquo;d even kissed you was when you&rsquo;d say goodnight to him. Along with the fact that watching Harry act like such a gentleman around all your family when you knew how dirty he could be was admittedly a turn on.</p><p>It&rsquo;d crossed your mind more than once to sneak into the bathroom with him when he went to shower, specifically when he&rsquo;d texted you to bring him clothes when he forgot to take them to the bathroom, opening the door wearing nothing but a towel, his curly hair wet and flopped carelessly to the side and dripping down onto his chest. For the first few days you&rsquo;d controlled yourself, heeding Harry&rsquo;s earlier warning, but eventually it all got too much and you sent Harry a photo of your boobs just after you&rsquo;d gotten out of the shower just to get a reaction out of him. Another time you came downstairs to wake him up and crawled in bed with him, leaving kisses along his neck and nipping every once in awhile in the hopes he&rsquo;d take you to the bathroom and bend you over the sink. </p><p>There were a few dirty jokes tossed around between the two of you, mostly when you played a game where you had to wink at your teammate to let them know they were on your team and they would have to glance at a location so you could deliver the package and win. One time when you got caught winking at each other you&rsquo;d exclaimed &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t like that, I was just trying to wink at him! Deliver the package, y&rsquo;know.&rdquo; resulting in a wave of shocked laughter and Harry smiling and blushing into his hands.</p><p>Harry winking at you shouldn&rsquo;t have set you off like it did, but everytime he did he would have this cocky smirk on his face like he knew what he was doing to you, and the truth was he did. All week he would do little things to tease you subtly and all you could think about was the sweet, sweet revenge you&rsquo;d get next time you spent Christmas with his family. </p><p>When it was time to go home, the ride to the airport, the plane ride and the car ride home were all silent, except for a few comments to each other about what to eat and such. You weren&rsquo;t sure what to do, you weren&rsquo;t even sure he remembered what happened in the parking lot of the Ross or if he did and he was just holding off to tease you, but regardless all the waiting was driving you crazy.</p><p>When you arrived back to your shared apartment it was still quiet, you looked at Harry expectantly as he toed his shoes off next to the door, but he just raised his eyebrows at you as he walked to the bedroom with a handful of the gifts the two of you had gotten. You followed and watched as he set them down in their respective places, gift cards in the dresser, clothes in the closet, your hands sat in your lap waiting patiently for an order that never came. That night he walked into the room after a shower and crawled in bed with you, turning off the lamp and turning on his side. You cuddled up to him, rubbing his chest lightly and drawing small shapes until you both fell asleep in eachothers arms.</p><p>The next day Harry had some recording to do at the studio and you tagged along, which turned out not to be a great idea as hearing him sing and the faces he made while doing so just made the itch in your stomach worse. He looked like he was enjoying himself and all you could think about was wrapping your lips around his cock as you stare up at him and watch as his face contorted in pleasure. </p><p>The day after that was the same, you went out to lunch with his team and couldn&rsquo;t keep your eyes off him. Eventually you decided to make a move, placing a hand on his thigh, he let it sit there until you slid your hand up, resulting in him grabbing your wrist and lightly digging his nails into your skin before placing your hand back in your lap. You spent the next few minutes building up the courage to do what you were about to, glancing at him and around the table to make sure no one was paying much attention. If Harry was mad when you grabbed his thigh he was pissed when you grabbed his bulge and rubbed lightly and it showed as he grabbed your wrist again and dug his nails in harder this time, actually taking the time to look at you before placing your hand in your lap and leaving a squeezing hand on your thigh as a reminder to behave. You were sure that you&rsquo;d earned yourself something, but that night there was still nothing.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t until the third day that you decided to take matters into your own hands, putting on a lacey red lingerie set he bought for you last valentines day that you knew drove him crazy under your usually sweatpants and crop top. Today was perfect for what you wanted, a lazy day at home usually spent cuddled up and watching movies, but this time you had something else in mind.</p><p>You walked out of the room, seeing Harry standing in the kitchen making tea. You walk up to him, hugging and staring up at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi baby.&rdquo; You mumble</p><p>&ldquo;Hi angel.&rdquo; Harry replies, placing his hand on your lower back to pull you closer and leaving a kiss on your forehead. You bite your lip, leaning up for a kiss and smiling when he leaned down to give you what you wanted. You put your hand on the back of his neck to hold him to your lips, standing on your tippy toes to reach his mouth, the two of you swaying lightly as you kissed. As nice as the moment was, you decided to end it by moving his hand under your shirt so he could feel your bra and biting down lightly on his lip.</p><p>Harry freezes for a second when he feels the lace of your bra, pulling away but staying close to your lips. When you opened your eyes Harry looked a little shocked, but mostly pissed, a subtle smirk playing on your lips as you pull off and begin to walk away. You didn&rsquo;t get far before Harry was grabbing your arm and dragging you to the bedroom, sitting you on the bed and standing in front of you. You once again avoided his gaze, staring at his shirt instead, too scared to even try and look him in the eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;Wha&rsquo;s your problem, hm?&rdquo; He snapped, grabbing your chin and tilting your head up to look at him &ldquo;Acting like a little fucking tease.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the tease? You were teasing me the entire time we were at my aunt&rsquo;s,&rdquo; You respond boldly, gaining some confidence as you stared up into his eyes &ldquo;I was just trying to get what you basically promised me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t promise you anythin&rsquo;, pet, and you better watch that tone, s&rsquo;not my fault you&rsquo;re entitled. Is that it? You think I owe you a fucking just because you can&rsquo;t keep your mind off my dick, eh? Think you can just put on some lingerie and everything will be as you wish? Don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve forgotten what a horny little slut you were being, sending me a picture of your tits knowing damn well someone could&rsquo;ve seen, or what about when you told me in front of everybody you wanted to get off on my leg.&rdquo; He paused, your legs were now clamped together in a desperate attempt to suppress some of the pressure &ldquo;Just like I said before, don&rsquo;t know how to follow orders, told you to behave and instead you were teasing me at every chance you got, even grabbed my dick in the middle of a restaurant. Need to be taught a lesson, think I&rsquo;ll have to remind you who&rsquo;s in charge.&rdquo; Harry says, taking a step closer to you and licking his lips.</p><p>Whatever confidence you had gained was gone now and you felt totally submissive staring into his lust filled eyes. He pushes you so your back is against the bed, kissing you hastily as your hands shoot up to his neck, he grabs your wrists and lightly pins them above your head, knowing you like it better when he&rsquo;s rough.</p><p>&ldquo;Since you think it&rsquo;s okay to grope daddy in public, no touching.&rdquo; He whispers in your ear as he attacks your neck with harsh kisses, pausing every once in awhile to leave a mark. He lifts your shirt up, running his hands along your sides until the tips of his fingers meet the lace of your bra, moving one of his hands forward to grope you lightly and tangling the other in to your hair. You push your hips up into his, feeling his bulge brush against your clothed core as he let out a quiet moan, giving a harsh smack to your ass.</p><p>&ldquo;On your knees.&rdquo; He demanded, as he stood there he must&rsquo;ve decided you were taking too long as he grabbed you by your hair and pulled you off the bed, forcing you down to your knees, clearly done with your bullshit. You stand on your knees, glancing up at him as you go to undo his pants to check if it&rsquo;s okay, unbuttoning them and pulling them to the floor when he nodded his head. His hand still in your hair, he buries your face in his bulge, you smirk and stick your tongue out to lick him over his underwear causing him to groan and pull you away. </p><p>Harry slides his underwear down the rest of the way, hissing lightly as he freed his member from the confinements of the cloth prison and stroking himself a few times lightly before putting the tip at your mouth. You open your mouth, licking at the tip and only taking it in your mouth when Harry glared down at you, swirling your tongue around it as you suck lightly.

Count, or am I gonna have to punish you for that too.&rdquo; He says, smacking your ass again, sending a spark between your legs.</p><p>&ldquo;One.&rdquo; you breathe out, trying not to squirm around too much. He kept going, all the way until twenty, when he delivered a particularly hard smack. He motions for you to sit up, to which you do, standing on your knees as your ass was surely as red as a tomato and would hurt to sit on. </p><p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; You say, wiping away some of the tears that made their way down your face.

He gives another harsh smack to your ass &ldquo;Maybe if you listened your ass wouldn&rsquo;t hurt.&rdquo; He says in a condescending tone, sitting you down and pulling off your top and pants. You whimper at the feeling of the cool bed sheets against your burning red ass, lifting your hips to help Harry get your pants off. </p><p>Once he&rsquo;s got them both off, he climbs on top, rubbing his thumb across your cheek as he kisses you.

There are people everywhere, mostly girls&hellip;</i></p><p><i>\u201cHi, I should have a room booked?\u201d You tell the receptionist and give over your name. You may have noticed the amount of jittery girls in the lobby, but the next five minutes is a tiresome blur.</i></p><p><i>You\u2019ve spent the entire day on a plane from Australia. The journey wasn\u2019t easy, in fact you\u2019d barely slept the whole twenty four hours you were sat down. Before that you\u2019d been at an event for two days that lasted sixteen hours each day, and that\u2019s a long journey from London for the sake of two fucking days. You\u2019re exhausted, and in dire need of a good nights sleep.</i></p><p><i>You sign the paperwork and take the key handed to you, ambling towards the elevator as you roll your head from side to side. You don\u2019t actually remember the lift ride up at all, only the wheel of your suitcase getting stuck in the gap between the doors on your way out.</i></p><p><i>Typically the room assigned to you is at the very end of a seemingly ridiculously long corridor, but the moment the door is open your irritation vanishes. You really are half asleep, eyes barely open as you leave your suitcase right by the door. You don\u2019t notice the steam seeping through the door to the right, or the fact that someone else\u2019s belongings are littered literally all over the living room of the suite.</i></p><p><i>Ah, another thing you didn\u2019t notice. It\u2019s a fucking suite, you\u2019re never given anything more than a boxy twin room.</i></p><p><i>You\u2019ve somehow managed to find your way into the large bedroom, already stripping out of your t-shirt and casting it to the ground without a care for where it lands. You\u2019ve just relieved your breasts from your bra when someone clears their throat behind you.</i></p><p><i>You feel your entire being heat up as you gasp, covering your breasts with your arms as you turn around. You must look like a deer caught in the headlights, your eyes wide as you stare into the eyes of the intruder.</i></p><p><i>But he\u2019s not just any intruder. Even with a towel wrapped around his signature locks it was still so very obviously him. Those unmistakable emerald eyes, that jaw line you\u2019ve admired for years now.</i></p><p><i>But even with all of this, on top of your debilitated state, and the smirk that holds his features, as well as the fact that he\u2019s literally stood there in </i>nothing<i>, nor is he </i>trying<i> to cover anything up, you find yourself overwhelmed with anger.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing?!\u201d You squeal at him, awkwardly standing in the middle of the room as you really begin to berate him. \u201cWhy the hell are you in here?! Standing there with no fucking clothes on like it\u2019s no fucking big deal?! Do you do that all the time?! Just waltz into people\u2019s rooms because you think you can?! Are you an arsehole?!\u201d</i></p><p><i>You carry on, but Harry\u2019s struggling not to find it amusing since what you\u2019re screaming slowly making less and less sense. As much as he\u2019s enjoying your little rant, he feels the need to put you out of your misery.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m gonna stop you there, love&hellip;\u201d He objected, simply glancing to the duffle bag sat on the end of the bed that was gaping open.</i></p><p><i>You grimace at his interruption, but follow his gaze. There it is. His belongings, which have very obviously been sat there since well before you turned up, especially given the state of the unmade bed. As if to fuel his own ego and mortify you further, he continues to trail his gaze around the room, touching on each and every item that\u2019s his.</i></p><p><i>You\u2019re filled with dread as Harry begins making his way to you at a tediously slow pace. Your eyes drop to the floor in your embarrassment, one hand running over your face to attempt to cover your fluster while the other still covers your naked breasts. \u201cOh my God. </i>Fuck<i>. Fuck, fuck, fuck.\u201d You heavily cringe over your words, unable to look anywhere other than the ugly carpet beneath your feet. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry. Fuck I\u2019m so tired, I\u2019m so fucking sorry.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Harry can tell you\u2019re tired. He could tell from the moment he saw your face, because regardless of how wide your eyes had grown, the bags underneath were unmistakeable. As was the fact that even through your shouting your exhaustion was apparent in the way your words cracked and you made very little sense most of the time.</i></p><p><i>You\u2019re still apologising, going through your entire thirty six hour day as if it would make a difference, saying that this was definitely the room the reception had given you a key for, if you\u2019d have known you wouldn\u2019t have come in, obviously.</i></p><p><i>\u201cDon\u2019t need to apologise, love.\u201d Harry assures you, suddenly much closer to you than he had been the last time you had eyes on him. \u201cAdmittedly this is the first time it\u2019s happened but&hellip; I\u2019m not exactly complaining.\u201d</i></p><p>Did he really just say that..?<i> Your head snaps up, following the sound of his voice to where he\u2019s now stood behind you, pulling things out of his bag. \u201cW-What?\u201d</i></p><p><i>He chuckles at your sudden lack of confidence, tossing his bag to the floor. \u201cI said I\u2019m not complaining.\u201d He repeats, pulling his hair out of his towel to give it a quick shake. \u201cI\u2019ve come back to worse things in my hotel room.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Is he flirting with you? Is that what\u2019s happening? Or are you just imagining it because you\u2019re knackered?</i></p><p><i>Harry moves to stand sort of in front of you again, still completely naked, and you\u2019re really trying your best to ignore the fact that his dick is right there, staring at you innocently. It reminds you that you haven\u2019t been remotely close to one for months, haven\u2019t had the pleasure of a good fuck for a substantial amount of time, and having one sat right in front of you is making you wet between your legs.</i></p><p><i>\u201cCan stay if y\u2019want.\u201d His voice has taken on a much lower tone, one that\u2019s suggestive and maybe a little intimidating. It doesn\u2019t help the dull ache homing in your core. \u201cBed\u2019s plenty big enough for two.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You definitely heard that. Your eyes pry from his annoyingly appealing cock to his gaze, and you swear it could swallow you whole. At this point in time you\u2019d probably let it. \u201cAre you&hellip; taking the piss?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Harry shakes his head, but his eyes never leave yours, and there\u2019s so much being hinted behind them you feel like you might collapse. \u201cSaves you redressing and going back to reception after all.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You can\u2019t argue that he makes a very valid point&hellip; but you also have a little niggle in the back of your mind telling you not to.</i></p><p>Wait!<i> This is fucking Harry Styles! You\u2019re never going to get an opportunity like this again! As suggestive as he may be, even to be in the same room as him is a privilege! You\u2019re only here for a night, you\u2019re really struggling to see the real harm.</i></p><p><i>\u201cCan see you\u2019re tired, love.\u201d He breaks your silence again, but his tone still holds that depth that\u2019s making you weaker by the second.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou don\u2019t even know my name.\u201d You manage to utter, and you\u2019re surprised at how confident you sound again. You decide to go with it, challenging him with a little raise of your brows.</i></p><p><i>Harry smirks, cocking his head in a playful way. \u201cYou\u2019re right I don\u2019t, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s just as beautiful as you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You can\u2019t help but giggle, the noise rumbling from the back of your throat in a teasing yet flattered manner. \u201cHow many girls have you picked up with that line?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re the first, so if I\u2019m successful then&hellip; I\u2019ll have a one hundred percent success rating.\u201d His smirk widens as he takes a step closer to you. \u201cAre you going to tell me your name or shall I guess?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Your arm is beginning to ache with the length of time it\u2019s been holding your breasts, but you try and hold out for as long as possible before you reveal yourself to be a complete slut. \u201cAs much fun as it would be to sit here and listen to you guess, we could be here all night.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cSo enlighten me, love.\u201d He hums as he takes another step towards you, head cocking again as his hand reaches up to trace his finger over your protruding collarbone.</i></p><p><i>Your name rolls off your tongue in an oh so innocent fashion, and little do you know it has his cock twitching inches from you.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWell,\u201d He parrots your name as his tracing fingers move towards your chest, \u201cthat was gonna be my first guest.\u201d His head carefully lowers towards yours, but you\u2019re far from nervous now.</i></p><p><i>You laugh again in disbelief, gently shaking your head from side to side. You knew he was notorious for being charming, but you hadn\u2019t expected anything close to this. \u201cYou smooth fucker.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Harry giggles a little childishly, his other hand reaching to stroke the side of your face as his lips linger millimetres from yours. \u201cOh, I\u2019m glad you think so.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You\u2019ve grown impatient with your flirting, no longer able to resist his teasing when you press your lips against his. He accepts your kiss, clearly smiling against your mouth as he holds your jaw between his thumb and forefinger. His other hand moves its way down your side to your waist, eventually settling at the small of your back. You finally release your hold on your breasts, reaching both hands up to rest at the nape of his neck. Your lips begin to move with one another, learning how the other tastes and feels. All you know is that even now so early on its the best kiss you\u2019ve had the pleasure of sharing.</i></p><p><i>Harry urges you closer to him, pressing his hand into your back to that your body falls against him, and your hands tighten their grip, a few of his curls instinctively wrapping around your fingers. His kisses become a little more desperate as he guides you towards the bed, mouth coaxing yours open just enough for him to lick along your top lip. Your tongue darts to taste his, dancing with it before you completely pull his top lip between your teeth. It makes him growl from the back of his throat, squeezing your frame tighter against his.</i></p><p><i>He starts to trail his kisses from your mouth to your neck and down to your bare chest as he gingerly sits on the bed. Your eyes are closed, head rolling backwards as he begins to bruise the skin of your breasts with his lips, nipping and sucking while his hands grip your waist until you\u2019re decorated with his purple marks. You\u2019re gently massaging your hands into his hair as you sandwich yourself between his legs, and for the first time you can feel his growing length against the sensitive skin of your thigh. You trail one hand down his abdomen, boldly reaching for his stiffening cock to give it a few strokes while he makes it his work to blindly remove you of your jeans.</i></p><p><i>His hands caress the insides of your thighs upwards, his long middle finger pressing against your heat over your knickers and making you shudder a little. The damp spot has him producing another little rumble, continuously rubbing over it as he pecks at your soft stomach. \u201cSo fucking wet already, darlin\u2019.\u201d He mumbles against your skin, two fingers now rubbing up and down over your clothed folds.</i></p><p><i>You mewl at his teasing, your hand beginning to move faster and harder over his length.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat do you want, love?\u201d He presses, looking up to see your mouth slightly parted but eyes still closed. \u201cTell me what you want.\u201d His voice is calm and careful, in no way demanding, and you don\u2019t know if it\u2019s better or worse.</i></p><p><i>\u201cJust you. Just want you to fuck me.\u201d You beg, lip quivering slightly at the thought of it.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYeah?\u201d He hums with another peck to your sternum. \u201cWant me to fill you up?\u201d</i></p><p><i>You whimper again as the rhythm of his fingers quickens, and if Harry\u2019s legs weren\u2019t pressed against yours you\u2019d probably collapse from their shaking. \u201c</i>Fuck<i> yes, please.\u201d You\u2019re really begging now, and that\u2019s not like you at all. But then again, you can\u2019t remember the last time you were wound up so much to the point you had to beg for it.</i></p><p><i>Harry wastes no more time, hooking his fingers into your knickers and pulling them down with ease. He shifts himself backwards, bringing you with him until you\u2019re eventually straddling him, his stuff member teasingly grazing the inside of your thigh. You mindlessly trace your middle finger over his lips, while your other hand steadies his cock between your legs.</i></p><p><i>His hands are planting your hips into place as you lean down to pull at his lips with your teeth again, biting into them just enough that they\u2019ll be bruised for a while. Harry moans from deep within his chest, squeezing his fingertips into the flesh of your hips. With that noise you slowly ease yourself onto him, feeling an unfamiliar stretch as you sink further and further that has you wincing slightly. You gently rock yourself over him, rolling your hips against his as you continue your work on his mouth. He wraps his arms around your middle, holding you as close to him as possible as he imitates your hip movements.</i></p><p><i>\u201cFucking hell you feel good.\u201d He grunts the moment your teeth release his lips, his mouth trailing sloppy kisses along your jawline to the fleshy spot just under your ear. \u201cSo fuckin\u2019 tight, angel.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You purr at his words, allowing your hands to roam around his body, feeling every surface of him and trying to store it as best as you can in your memory. You feel one hand reach down to clench at your bum, his weight shifting ever so slightly that it causes him to hit something within you that makes you squeak. The sensation creates a burning need for more, and you shift to straighten up over him. The minor change of position has him finding a place much deeper within you, a low and drawn out moan falling from your lips at the feeling.</i></p><p><i>Harry could probably lose himself there and then at the glorious sound you\u2019re making, but he\u2019s not quite ready to let this end yet. \u201cSo fuckin pretty.\u201d He praises you, grip tightening on you again as he hastily rocks upwards into you. \u201cAll but handed to me on a plate, weren\u2019t ya?\u201d</i></p><p><i>You smile to yourself as he continues his babbling. You never thought you were one to enjoy talking during sex, but with the way Harry talks to you, you\u2019re never going to feel uncomfortable with it.</i></p><p><i>\u201cCan\u2019t believe you just wandered in here.\u201d His thrusts are growing a little hectic and chaotic as he manages to work himself up with his own words, but you don\u2019t mind, not when it\u2019s making him hit places you didn\u2019t even know existed. \u201cLike someone wanted it for us.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m not complaining.\u201d You pant, repeating his earlier words as you press your lips back to his.</i></p><p><i>\u201cNeither am I, fucking hell.\u201d He chuckles against you, his chest vibrating against yours. \u201cShould come to Barcelona more often if I\u2019m gonna get a gift like you every time I open a door.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You giggle girlishly at his flirty words, trailing a few wet kisses to his throat. \u201cMight just have to follow you around the world.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Something about your suggestion kicks something within him, and he\u2019s swiftly rolling you over so that you\u2019re on your back, legs in the air as they grip around his waist. He\u2019s stopped thrusting, he\u2019s just staring at you with a strange glint in his eye. \u201cSay that again.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You can\u2019t stop your smirk as your hands caress along his broad shoulders and down his arms. \u201cSaid I might follow you around the world.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAnd why\u2019d you want to do that, love?\u201d He presses, wetting his lips with his tongue as he waits for your reply.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I if I\u2019d get a fuck like this out of it every night?\u201d You challenge, your arms wrapping around his tensed biceps.</i></p><p><i>He groans out, his pace finally picking up again as he resumes his thrusting into you. \u201cWhere the fuck did they find you?\u201d He begs the question as he buries his head into the crook of your neck.</i></p><p><i>His new pace is pushing you towards your orgasm quickly, and you can feel the familiar burn rising from your core. You clench around him in preparation, bunching his hair into your fist as he hits you in just the right spot. Your nails drag against the skin of his back as you moan his name out in a low and fucked out tone. Your undoing has him ready to go, and as you press your hips completely into him, he feels his state climax, little white spots clouding his vision as your name falls from his lips over and over in little desperate pants.</i></p><p><i>You hold him to you for as long as possible, massaging your fingertips into the crown of his scalp while he harasses your neck with more bruises. Ordinarily you\u2019d be scolding him for it given you\u2019re in another country for a fucking conference, but you\u2019re past caring at this point. You\u2019ve just had the best fuck you could ever remember, you\u2019re not going to let it go for some stupid work bollocks.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI want your phone number before you leave.\u201d He hums into your skin between kisses, pressing a chaste kiss to the bend of your jaw.</i></p><p><i>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d You tease, tilting your head slightly to try and see his face.</i></p><p><i>\u201cAbso-fucking-lutely.\u201d He insists, pulling his head up to meet your gaze.</i></p><p><i>\u201cFine by me, handsome.\u201d</i></p><p>~</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he talking about?\u201d Fee asks, oblivious to the comment Dillon had made moments prior.</p><p>\u201cYou told him?!\u201d You screech at your husband, glaring at him with a newfound anger.</p><p>\u201cHe is eighteen, love.\u201d Harry attempts to reason, shifting properly in his seat to meet your burning gaze. \u201cI don\u2019t see a reason to hide it any more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want our children knowing how quickly we fell into bed together!\u201d You scold, quickly turning to bring the frying pan off the heat before the eggs turn hard.</p><p>\u201cEw.\u201d Fee grumbles quietly.</p><p>Harry gesticulates his arms wide and rolls his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s not as bad as it sounds, trust me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr, you slept together within \u2018alf an hour of knowin\u2019 each other,\u201d Tom interjects with a frown, \u201ccan\u2019t get much easier than that.\u201d</p><p>Harry grimaces. \u201cTom, shut up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you calling me easy?\u201d You ask bitterly, turning your glare to Tom.</p><p>\u201cYou married the bloke so why does it matter?!\u201d He defends pointlessly.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you told him.\u201d You grumble, spinning back to your breakfast preparation. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason why I didn\u2019t want anyone to know, and Tom has just proved my sodding point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so all the people in this room know, but it doesn\u2019t matter now because they\u2019re not going to tell anyone and we didn\u2019t sleep with anyone else after anyway!\u201d Harry reasons, standing from his seat to make his way over to you.</p><p>\u201cIt still doesn\u2019t remove the fact that I gave myself up to you so easily!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were tired, so was I! We fell in love didn\u2019t we?!\u201d</p><p>You roll your head back in frustration, gritting your teeth. \u201cIt\u2019s still not a great example to set for our daughter, Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone back me up, please?!\u201d Harry turns back to the room, all of whom just shrug at him. \u201cOh sod off. Like I said, love, they\u2019re not going to tell anyone, it\u2019s never going to leave this room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt fucking better not, otherwise there really will be hell to pay.\u201d You warn, pointing between each of them with a spatula.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Fee mumbles, \u201cI still don\u2019t actually know how you met&hellip;\u201d</p><p>The room ceremoniously groans, half expecting you to lose it again.</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s going to stay that way until you\u2019re thirty five.\u201d You conclude, just as Harry pecks an apologetic kiss to your temple.</p><p>Tom laughs at Harry\u2019s fawning. \u201cKiss her all you like, mate but you\u2019re in the doghouse.\u201d</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"282\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"beststyles:JnyJooR-AQTc6F1ANzQYvw:ZXMRId2Zd8nUx\"><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0cad8502f071463415704cc4918bc6d5/tumblr_pbjzh9PVYV1wvkvsio1_500.gif\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"282\"/></figure><p><b>~<a href=\"http://waitingfortwilight.tumblr.com/post/182919772299/a-series-of-parental-events-masterlist\">Series Masterlist</a>~</b></p><p>Thanking you endlessly!</p><p>Tag list: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM5Wesov-xsjMV0DS3xoxeQ\">@ofpeppermintbay</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgPyqI5CkEId8g7xFggm2Hg\">@permanentllyharry</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mC46KFufQzMQFQPY1dCvfcA\">@joan-of-disappointment</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUftrmoCR-gJ36qDkBozOAg\">@abundantlyabundant</a> @staceystoleyourheart <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYYD0_lJbE8J3m-qWYoZ2Ww\">@hoeforhaz</a> @behdhendud <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlRbiKuRhgrY3E3H8bL5cIg\">@harry12styles94</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNcSwE3yuAMUrJFCByV9VEA\">@belikebebe</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw8YPeV1kp6lQtCreciPNCQ\">@harryismydaddy21</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mb5MZxMvKL3E9V-fzr16asg\">@talesofstyles</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGFOmVWpQgDRviVbQYGjJ8w\">@meet-me-in-the-harry</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5sffYoPzjk56Rs6ZvKn9FQ\">@joycelovedorial</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mp_6aoPyziVdi6ZXi6B8LjQ\">@evaolin</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmcxuUK9ZWplnHQCdhUVD1A\">@ijustloveharrystyles</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfxkucLlCoWB5Gmly8d8H6Q\">@harryisalittleshit</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6jWlNWmGyQNYnEd6-SS92A\">@newtosaur250</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/myJAa8KxYrK4vh_yQTZ_60g\">@sydneys-life-blog</a></p>",

Kate xxx</i></b></p><p><b></b><i></i><i></i>\u201cMum, can we watch <i>Wimbledon</i>?\u201d</p><p>Your head peers up from the feast you\u2019re preparing for your Sunday morning breakfast to Fee who asked the question. \u201cCourse we can!\u201d</p><p>You miss the glance that Harry and Dillon share, but Tom notices and is immediately confused.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so great \u2018bout Wimbledon? It\u2019s April; you\u2019re two months early.\u201d Tom queries, scratching the back of his head with a frown.</p><p>A loud laugh rips from the back of your throat as you crack an egg over the frying pan. \u201cIt\u2019s a film, Tom. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve watched it with us before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m almost certain he has, love.\u201d Harry chirps in, rolling his head back on his neck to look at you from his chair. \u201cPretty sure he called Paul Bettany \u2018a pretty ponse\u2019 once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that film!\u201d Tom smacks his forehead with his palm. \u201cWhat d\u2019ya want t\u2019watch that shit for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably wants relive the night she met Dad.\u201d Dillon mumbles.</p><p>You spin around on your heel and scowl at the occupied dining table, just in time to see Harry clip the back of his son\u2019s head. \u201cExcuse me?!\u201d</p><p>~</p><p>January 2020</p><p><i>\u201cYes, yes, I know.\u201d You mumble into your phone, ending the call before your brother pesters you more. Considering the late hour you\u2019re surprised it\u2019s so busy in the lobby of the hotel, but no one actually seems to be checking in.</i></p><p><i>You look around the room in confusion, a frown etched on your features as you wander up to the reception desk. There are people everywhere, mostly girls\u2026</i></p><p><i>\u201cHi, I should have a room booked?\u201d You tell the receptionist and give over your name. You may have noticed the amount of jittery girls in the lobby, but the next five minutes is a tiresome blur.</i></p><p><i>You\u2019ve spent the entire day on a plane from Australia. The journey wasn\u2019t easy, in fact you\u2019d barely slept the whole twenty four hours you were sat down. Before that you\u2019d been at an event for two days that lasted sixteen hours each day, and that\u2019s a long journey from London for the sake of two fucking days. You\u2019re exhausted, and in dire need of a good nights sleep.</i></p><p><i>You sign the paperwork and take the key handed to you, ambling towards the elevator as you roll your head from side to side. You don\u2019t actually remember the lift ride up at all, only the wheel of your suitcase getting stuck in the gap between the doors on your way out.</i></p><p><i>Typically the room assigned to you is at the very end of a seemingly ridiculously long corridor, but the moment the door is open your irritation vanishes. You really are half asleep, eyes barely open as you leave your suitcase right by the door. You don\u2019t notice the steam seeping through the door to the right, or the fact that someone else\u2019s belongings are littered literally all over the living room of the suite.</i></p><p><i>Ah, another thing you didn\u2019t notice. It\u2019s a fucking suite, you\u2019re never given anything more than a boxy twin room.</i></p><p><i>You\u2019ve somehow managed to find your way into the large bedroom, already stripping out of your t-shirt and casting it to the ground without a care for where it lands. You\u2019ve just relieved your breasts from your bra when someone clears their throat behind you.</i></p><p><i>You feel your entire being heat up as you gasp, covering your breasts with your arms as you turn around. You must look like a deer caught in the headlights, your eyes wide as you stare into the eyes of the intruder.</i></p><p><i>But he\u2019s not just any intruder. Even with a towel wrapped around his signature locks it was still so very obviously him. Those unmistakable emerald eyes, that jaw line you\u2019ve admired for years now.</i></p><p><i>But even with all of this, on top of your debilitated state, and the smirk that holds his features, as well as the fact that he\u2019s literally stood there in </i>nothing<i>, nor is he </i>trying<i> to cover anything up, you find yourself overwhelmed with anger.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing?!\u201d You squeal at him, awkwardly standing in the middle of the room as you really begin to berate him. \u201cWhy the hell are you in here?! Standing there with no fucking clothes on like it\u2019s no fucking big deal?! Do you do that all the time?! Just waltz into people\u2019s rooms because you think you can?! Are you an arsehole?!\u201d</i></p><p><i>You carry on, but Harry\u2019s struggling not to find it amusing since what you\u2019re screaming slowly making less and less sense. As much as he\u2019s enjoying your little rant, he feels the need to put you out of your misery.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m gonna stop you there, love\u2026\u201d He objected, simply glancing to the duffle bag sat on the end of the bed that was gaping open.</i></p><p><i>You grimace at his interruption, but follow his gaze. There it is. His belongings, which have very obviously been sat there since well before you turned up, especially given the state of the unmade bed. As if to fuel his own ego and mortify you further, he continues to trail his gaze around the room, touching on each and every item that\u2019s his.</i></p><p><i>You\u2019re filled with dread as Harry begins making his way to you at a tediously slow pace. Your eyes drop to the floor in your embarrassment, one hand running over your face to attempt to cover your fluster while the other still covers your naked breasts. \u201cOh my God. </i>Fuck<i>. Fuck, fuck, fuck.\u201d You heavily cringe over your words, unable to look anywhere other than the ugly carpet beneath your feet. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry. Fuck I\u2019m so tired, I\u2019m so fucking sorry.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Harry can tell you\u2019re tired. He could tell from the moment he saw your face, because regardless of how wide your eyes had grown, the bags underneath were unmistakeable. As was the fact that even through your shouting your exhaustion was apparent in the way your words cracked and you made very little sense most of the time.</i></p><p><i>You\u2019re still apologising, going through your entire thirty six hour day as if it would make a difference, saying that this was definitely the room the reception had given you a key for, if you\u2019d have known you wouldn\u2019t have come in, obviously.</i></p><p><i>\u201cDon\u2019t need to apologise, love.\u201d Harry assures you, suddenly much closer to you than he had been the last time you had eyes on him. \u201cAdmittedly this is the first time it\u2019s happened but\u2026 I\u2019m not exactly complaining.\u201d</i></p><p>Did he really just say that..?<i> Your head snaps up, following the sound of his voice to where he\u2019s now stood behind you, pulling things out of his bag. \u201cW-What?\u201d</i></p><p><i>He chuckles at your sudden lack of confidence, tossing his bag to the floor. \u201cI said I\u2019m not complaining.\u201d He repeats, pulling his hair out of his towel to give it a quick shake. \u201cI\u2019ve come back to worse things in my hotel room.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Is he flirting with you? Is that what\u2019s happening? Or are you just imagining it because you\u2019re knackered?</i></p><p><i>Harry moves to stand sort of in front of you again, still completely naked, and you\u2019re really trying your best to ignore the fact that his dick is right there, staring at you innocently. It reminds you that you haven\u2019t been remotely close to one for months, haven\u2019t had the pleasure of a good fuck for a substantial amount of time, and having one sat right in front of you is making you wet between your legs.</i></p><p><i>\u201cCan stay if y\u2019want.\u201d His voice has taken on a much lower tone, one that\u2019s suggestive and maybe a little intimidating. It doesn\u2019t help the dull ache homing in your core. \u201cBed\u2019s plenty big enough for two.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You definitely heard that. Your eyes pry from his annoyingly appealing cock to his gaze, and you swear it could swallow you whole. At this point in time you\u2019d probably let it. \u201cAre you\u2026 taking the piss?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Harry shakes his head, but his eyes never leave yours, and there\u2019s so much being hinted behind them you feel like you might collapse. \u201cSaves you redressing and going back to reception after all.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You can\u2019t argue that he makes a very valid point\u2026 but you also have a little niggle in the back of your mind telling you not to.</i></p><p>Wait!<i> This is fucking Harry Styles! You\u2019re never going to get an opportunity like this again! As suggestive as he may be, even to be in the same room as him is a privilege! You\u2019re only here for a night, you\u2019re really struggling to see the real harm.</i></p><p><i>\u201cCan see you\u2019re tired, love.\u201d He breaks your silence again, but his tone still holds that depth that\u2019s making you weaker by the second.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou don\u2019t even know my name.\u201d You manage to utter, and you\u2019re surprised at how confident you sound again. You decide to go with it, challenging him with a little raise of your brows.</i></p><p><i>Harry smirks, cocking his head in a playful way. \u201cYou\u2019re right I don\u2019t, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s just as beautiful as you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You can\u2019t help but giggle, the noise rumbling from the back of your throat in a teasing yet flattered manner. \u201cHow many girls have you picked up with that line?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re the first, so if I\u2019m successful then\u2026 I\u2019ll have a one hundred percent success rating.\u201d His smirk widens as he takes a step closer to you. \u201cAre you going to tell me your name or shall I guess?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Your arm is beginning to ache with the length of time it\u2019s been holding your breasts, but you try and hold out for as long as possible before you reveal yourself to be a complete slut. \u201cAs much fun as it would be to sit here and listen to you guess, we could be here all night.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cSo enlighten me, love.\u201d He hums as he takes another step towards you, head cocking again as his hand reaches up to trace his finger over your protruding collarbone.</i></p><p><i>Your name rolls off your tongue in an oh so innocent fashion, and little do you know it has his cock twitching inches from you.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWell,\u201d He parrots your name as his tracing fingers move towards your chest, \u201cthat was gonna be my first guest.\u201d His head carefully lowers towards yours, but you\u2019re far from nervous now.</i></p><p><i>You laugh again in disbelief, gently shaking your head from side to side. You knew he was notorious for being charming, but you hadn\u2019t expected anything close to this. \u201cYou smooth fucker.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Harry giggles a little childishly, his other hand reaching to stroke the side of your face as his lips linger millimetres from yours. \u201cOh, I\u2019m glad you think so.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You\u2019ve grown impatient with your flirting, no longer able to resist his teasing when you press your lips against his. He accepts your kiss, clearly smiling against your mouth as he holds your jaw between his thumb and forefinger. His other hand moves its way down your side to your waist, eventually settling at the small of your back. You finally release your hold on your breasts, reaching both hands up to rest at the nape of his neck. Your lips begin to move with one another, learning how the other tastes and feels. All you know is that even now so early on its the best kiss you\u2019ve had the pleasure of sharing.</i></p><p><i>Harry urges you closer to him, pressing his hand into your back to that your body falls against him, and your hands tighten their grip, a few of his curls instinctively wrapping around your fingers. His kisses become a little more desperate as he guides you towards the bed, mouth coaxing yours open just enough for him to lick along your top lip. Your tongue darts to taste his, dancing with it before you completely pull his top lip between your teeth. It makes him growl from the back of his throat, squeezing your frame tighter against his.</i></p><p><i>He starts to trail his kisses from your mouth to your neck and down to your bare chest as he gingerly sits on the bed. Your eyes are closed, head rolling backwards as he begins to bruise the skin of your breasts with his lips, nipping and sucking while his hands grip your waist until you\u2019re decorated with his purple marks. You\u2019re gently massaging your hands into his hair as you sandwich yourself between his legs, and for the first time you can feel his growing length against the sensitive skin of your thigh. You trail one hand down his abdomen, boldly reaching for his stiffening cock to give it a few strokes while he makes it his work to blindly remove you of your jeans.</i></p><p><i>His hands caress the insides of your thighs upwards, his long middle finger pressing against your heat over your knickers and making you shudder a little. The damp spot has him producing another little rumble, continuously rubbing over it as he pecks at your soft stomach. \u201cSo fucking wet already, darlin\u2019.\u201d He mumbles against your skin, two fingers now rubbing up and down over your clothed folds.</i></p><p><i>You mewl at his teasing, your hand beginning to move faster and harder over his length.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat do you want, love?\u201d He presses, looking up to see your mouth slightly parted but eyes still closed. \u201cTell me what you want.\u201d His voice is calm and careful, in no way demanding, and you don\u2019t know if it\u2019s better or worse.</i></p><p><i>\u201cJust you. Just want you to fuck me.\u201d You beg, lip quivering slightly at the thought of it.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYeah?\u201d He hums with another peck to your sternum. \u201cWant me to fill you up?\u201d</i></p><p><i>You whimper again as the rhythm of his fingers quickens, and if Harry\u2019s legs weren\u2019t pressed against yours you\u2019d probably collapse from their shaking. \u201c</i>Fuck<i> yes, please.\u201d You\u2019re really begging now, and that\u2019s not like you at all. But then again, you can\u2019t remember the last time you were wound up so much to the point you had to beg for it.</i></p><p><i>Harry wastes no more time, hooking his fingers into your knickers and pulling them down with ease. He shifts himself backwards, bringing you with him until you\u2019re eventually straddling him, his stuff member teasingly grazing the inside of your thigh. You mindlessly trace your middle finger over his lips, while your other hand steadies his cock between your legs.</i></p><p><i>His hands are planting your hips into place as you lean down to pull at his lips with your teeth again, biting into them just enough that they\u2019ll be bruised for a while. Harry moans from deep within his chest, squeezing his fingertips into the flesh of your hips. With that noise you slowly ease yourself onto him, feeling an unfamiliar stretch as you sink further and further that has you wincing slightly. You gently rock yourself over him, rolling your hips against his as you continue your work on his mouth. He wraps his arms around your middle, holding you as close to him as possible as he imitates your hip movements.</i></p><p><i>\u201cFucking hell you feel good.\u201d He grunts the moment your teeth release his lips, his mouth trailing sloppy kisses along your jawline to the fleshy spot just under your ear. \u201cSo fuckin\u2019 tight, angel.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You purr at his words, allowing your hands to roam around his body, feeling every surface of him and trying to store it as best as you can in your memory. You feel one hand reach down to clench at your bum, his weight shifting ever so slightly that it causes him to hit something within you that makes you squeak. The sensation creates a burning need for more, and you shift to straighten up over him. The minor change of position has him finding a place much deeper within you, a low and drawn out moan falling from your lips at the feeling.</i></p><p><i>Harry could probably lose himself there and then at the glorious sound you\u2019re making, but he\u2019s not quite ready to let this end yet. \u201cSo fuckin pretty.\u201d He praises you, grip tightening on you again as he hastily rocks upwards into you. \u201cAll but handed to me on a plate, weren\u2019t ya?\u201d</i></p><p><i>You smile to yourself as he continues his babbling. You never thought you were one to enjoy talking during sex, but with the way Harry talks to you, you\u2019re never going to feel uncomfortable with it.</i></p><p><i>\u201cCan\u2019t believe you just wandered in here.\u201d His thrusts are growing a little hectic and chaotic as he manages to work himself up with his own words, but you don\u2019t mind, not when it\u2019s making him hit places you didn\u2019t even know existed. \u201cLike someone wanted it for us.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m not complaining.\u201d You pant, repeating his earlier words as you press your lips back to his.</i></p><p><i>\u201cNeither am I, fucking hell.\u201d He chuckles against you, his chest vibrating against yours. \u201cShould come to Barcelona more often if I\u2019m gonna get a gift like you every time I open a door.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You giggle girlishly at his flirty words, trailing a few wet kisses to his throat. \u201cMight just have to follow you around the world.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Something about your suggestion kicks something within him, and he\u2019s swiftly rolling you over so that you\u2019re on your back, legs in the air as they grip around his waist. He\u2019s stopped thrusting, he\u2019s just staring at you with a strange glint in his eye. \u201cSay that again.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You can\u2019t stop your smirk as your hands caress along his broad shoulders and down his arms. \u201cSaid I might follow you around the world.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAnd why\u2019d you want to do that, love?\u201d He presses, wetting his lips with his tongue as he waits for your reply.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I if I\u2019d get a fuck like this out of it every night?\u201d You challenge, your arms wrapping around his tensed biceps.</i></p><p><i>He groans out, his pace finally picking up again as he resumes his thrusting into you. \u201cWhere the fuck did they find you?\u201d He begs the question as he buries his head into the crook of your neck.</i></p><p><i>His new pace is pushing you towards your orgasm quickly, and you can feel the familiar burn rising from your core. You clench around him in preparation, bunching his hair into your fist as he hits you in just the right spot. Your nails drag against the skin of his back as you moan his name out in a low and fucked out tone. Your undoing has him ready to go, and as you press your hips completely into him, he feels his state climax, little white spots clouding his vision as your name falls from his lips over and over in little desperate pants.</i></p><p><i>You hold him to you for as long as possible, massaging your fingertips into the crown of his scalp while he harasses your neck with more bruises. Ordinarily you\u2019d be scolding him for it given you\u2019re in another country for a fucking conference, but you\u2019re past caring at this point. You\u2019ve just had the best fuck you could ever remember, you\u2019re not going to let it go for some stupid work bollocks.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI want your phone number before you leave.\u201d He hums into your skin between kisses, pressing a chaste kiss to the bend of your jaw.</i></p><p><i>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d You tease, tilting your head slightly to try and see his face.</i></p><p><i>\u201cAbso-fucking-lutely.\u201d He insists, pulling his head up to meet your gaze.</i></p><p><i>\u201cFine by me, handsome.\u201d</i></p><p>~</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he talking about?\u201d Fee asks, oblivious to the comment Dillon had made moments prior.</p><p>\u201cYou told him?!\u201d You screech at your husband, glaring at him with a newfound anger.</p><p>\u201cHe is eighteen, love.\u201d Harry attempts to reason, shifting properly in his seat to meet your burning gaze. \u201cI don\u2019t see a reason to hide it any more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want our children knowing how quickly we fell into bed together!\u201d You scold, quickly turning to bring the frying pan off the heat before the eggs turn hard.</p><p>\u201cEw.\u201d Fee grumbles quietly.</p><p>Harry gesticulates his arms wide and rolls his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s not as bad as it sounds, trust me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr, you slept together within \u2018alf an hour of knowin\u2019 each other,\u201d Tom interjects with a frown, \u201ccan\u2019t get much easier than that.\u201d</p><p>Harry grimaces. \u201cTom, shut up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you calling me easy?\u201d You ask bitterly, turning your glare to Tom.</p><p>\u201cYou married the bloke so why does it matter?!\u201d He defends pointlessly.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you told him.\u201d You grumble, spinning back to your breakfast preparation. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason why I didn\u2019t want anyone to know, and Tom has just proved my sodding point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so all the people in this room know, but it doesn\u2019t matter now because they\u2019re not going to tell anyone and we didn\u2019t sleep with anyone else after anyway!\u201d Harry reasons, standing from his seat to make his way over to you.</p><p>\u201cIt still doesn\u2019t remove the fact that I gave myself up to you so easily!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were tired, so was I! We fell in love didn\u2019t we?!\u201d</p><p>You roll your head back in frustration, gritting your teeth. \u201cIt\u2019s still not a great example to set for our daughter, Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone back me up, please?!\u201d Harry turns back to the room, all of whom just shrug at him. \u201cOh sod off. Like I said, love, they\u2019re not going to tell anyone, it\u2019s never going to leave this room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt fucking better not, otherwise there really will be hell to pay.\u201d You warn, pointing between each of them with a spatula.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Fee mumbles, \u201cI still don\u2019t actually know how you met\u2026\u201d</p><p>The room ceremoniously groans, half expecting you to lose it again.</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s going to stay that way until you\u2019re thirty five.\u201d You conclude, just as Harry pecks an apologetic kiss to your temple.</p><p>Tom laughs at Harry\u2019s fawning. \u201cKiss her all you like, mate but you\u2019re in the doghouse.\u201d</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"282\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"beststyles:JnyJooR-AQTc6F1ANzQYvw:ZXMRId2Zd8nUx\"><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0cad8502f071463415704cc4918bc6d5/tumblr_pbjzh9PVYV1wvkvsio1_500.gif\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"282\"></figure><p><b>~<a href=\"http://waitingfortwilight.tumblr.com/post/182919772299/a-series-of-parental-events-masterlist\">Series Masterlist</a>~</b></p><p>Thanking you endlessly!</p><p>Tag list: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM5Wesov-xsjMV0DS3xoxeQ\">@ofpeppermintbay</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgPyqI5CkEId8g7xFggm2Hg\">@permanentllyharry</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mC46KFufQzMQFQPY1dCvfcA\">@joan-of-disappointment</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUftrmoCR-gJ36qDkBozOAg\">@abundantlyabundant</a> @staceystoleyourheart <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYYD0_lJbE8J3m-qWYoZ2Ww\">@hoeforhaz</a> @behdhendud <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlRbiKuRhgrY3E3H8bL5cIg\">@harry12styles94</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNcSwE3yuAMUrJFCByV9VEA\">@belikebebe</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw8YPeV1kp6lQtCreciPNCQ\">@harryismydaddy21</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mb5MZxMvKL3E9V-fzr16asg\">@talesofstyles</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGFOmVWpQgDRviVbQYGjJ8w\">@meet-me-in-the-harry</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5sffYoPzjk56Rs6ZvKn9FQ\">@joycelovedorial</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mp_6aoPyziVdi6ZXi6B8LjQ\">@evaolin</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmcxuUK9ZWplnHQCdhUVD1A\">@ijustloveharrystyles</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfxkucLlCoWB5Gmly8d8H6Q\">@harryisalittleshit</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6jWlNWmGyQNYnEd6-SS92A\">@newtosaur250</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/myJAa8KxYrK4vh_yQTZ_60g\">@sydneys-life-blog</a></p></p>",

This took me fucking hours yesterday because I actually spent the first part of it watching</i> Wimbledon<i> (if you haven\u2019t seen it, do go watch it). Prepare yourselves for 4k of flirting and filth, I can\u2019t tell you if the filth is actually good or not, I wrote it in bed late last night\u2026 Thoughts please! Kate xxx</i></b></p><p><b></b><i></i><i></i>\u201cMum, can we watch <i>Wimbledon</i>?\u201d</p><p>Your head peers up from the feast you\u2019re preparing for your Sunday morning breakfast to Fee who asked the question. \u201cCourse we can!\u201d</p><p>You miss the glance that Harry and Dillon share, but Tom notices and is immediately confused.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so great \u2018bout Wimbledon? It\u2019s April; you\u2019re two months early.\u201d Tom queries, scratching the back of his head with a frown.</p><p>A loud laugh rips from the back of your throat as you crack an egg over the frying pan. \u201cIt\u2019s a film, Tom. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve watched it with us before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m almost certain he has, love.\u201d Harry chirps in, rolling his head back on his neck to look at you from his chair. \u201cPretty sure he called Paul Bettany \u2018a pretty ponse\u2019 once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that film!\u201d Tom smacks his forehead with his palm. \u201cWhat d\u2019ya want t\u2019watch that shit for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably wants relive the night she met Dad.\u201d Dillon mumbles.</p><p>You spin around on your heel and scowl at the occupied dining table, just in time to see Harry clip the back of his son\u2019s head. \u201cExcuse me?!\u201d</p><p>~</p><p>January 2020</p><p><i>\u201cYes, yes, I know.\u201d You mumble into your phone, ending the call before your brother pesters you more. Considering the late hour you\u2019re surprised it\u2019s so busy in the lobby of the hotel, but no one actually seems to be checking in.</i></p><p><i>You look around the room in confusion, a frown etched on your features as you wander up to the reception desk. There are people everywhere, mostly girls\u2026</i></p><p><i>\u201cHi, I should have a room booked?\u201d You tell the receptionist and give over your name. You may have noticed the amount of jittery girls in the lobby, but the next five minutes is a tiresome blur.</i></p><p><i>You\u2019ve spent the entire day on a plane from Australia. The journey wasn\u2019t easy, in fact you\u2019d barely slept the whole twenty four hours you were sat down. Before that you\u2019d been at an event for two days that lasted sixteen hours each day, and that\u2019s a long journey from London for the sake of two fucking days. You\u2019re exhausted, and in dire need of a good nights sleep.</i></p><p><i>You sign the paperwork and take the key handed to you, ambling towards the elevator as you roll your head from side to side. You don\u2019t actually remember the lift ride up at all, only the wheel of your suitcase getting stuck in the gap between the doors on your way out.</i></p><p><i>Typically the room assigned to you is at the very end of a seemingly ridiculously long corridor, but the moment the door is open your irritation vanishes. You really are half asleep, eyes barely open as you leave your suitcase right by the door. You don\u2019t notice the steam seeping through the door to the right, or the fact that someone else\u2019s belongings are littered literally all over the living room of the suite.</i></p><p><i>Ah, another thing you didn\u2019t notice. It\u2019s a fucking suite, you\u2019re never given anything more than a boxy twin room.</i></p><p><i>You\u2019ve somehow managed to find your way into the large bedroom, already stripping out of your t-shirt and casting it to the ground without a care for where it lands. You\u2019ve just relieved your breasts from your bra when someone clears their throat behind you.</i></p><p><i>You feel your entire being heat up as you gasp, covering your breasts with your arms as you turn around. You must look like a deer caught in the headlights, your eyes wide as you stare into the eyes of the intruder.</i></p><p><i>But he\u2019s not just any intruder. Even with a towel wrapped around his signature locks it was still so very obviously him. Those unmistakable emerald eyes, that jaw line you\u2019ve admired for years now.</i></p><p><i>But even with all of this, on top of your debilitated state, and the smirk that holds his features, as well as the fact that he\u2019s literally stood there in </i>nothing<i>, nor is he </i>trying<i> to cover anything up, you find yourself overwhelmed with anger.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing?!\u201d You squeal at him, awkwardly standing in the middle of the room as you really begin to berate him. \u201cWhy the hell are you in here?! Standing there with no fucking clothes on like it\u2019s no fucking big deal?! Do you do that all the time?! Just waltz into people\u2019s rooms because you think you can?! Are you an arsehole?!\u201d</i></p><p><i>You carry on, but Harry\u2019s struggling not to find it amusing since what you\u2019re screaming slowly making less and less sense. As much as he\u2019s enjoying your little rant, he feels the need to put you out of your misery.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m gonna stop you there, love\u2026\u201d He objected, simply glancing to the duffle bag sat on the end of the bed that was gaping open.</i></p><p><i>You grimace at his interruption, but follow his gaze. There it is. His belongings, which have very obviously been sat there since well before you turned up, especially given the state of the unmade bed. As if to fuel his own ego and mortify you further, he continues to trail his gaze around the room, touching on each and every item that\u2019s his.</i></p><p><i>You\u2019re filled with dread as Harry begins making his way to you at a tediously slow pace. Your eyes drop to the floor in your embarrassment, one hand running over your face to attempt to cover your fluster while the other still covers your naked breasts. \u201cOh my God. </i>Fuck<i>. Fuck, fuck, fuck.\u201d You heavily cringe over your words, unable to look anywhere other than the ugly carpet beneath your feet. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry. Fuck I\u2019m so tired, I\u2019m so fucking sorry.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Harry can tell you\u2019re tired. He could tell from the moment he saw your face, because regardless of how wide your eyes had grown, the bags underneath were unmistakeable. As was the fact that even through your shouting your exhaustion was apparent in the way your words cracked and you made very little sense most of the time.</i></p><p><i>You\u2019re still apologising, going through your entire thirty six hour day as if it would make a difference, saying that this was definitely the room the reception had given you a key for, if you\u2019d have known you wouldn\u2019t have come in, obviously.</i></p><p><i>\u201cDon\u2019t need to apologise, love.\u201d Harry assures you, suddenly much closer to you than he had been the last time you had eyes on him. \u201cAdmittedly this is the first time it\u2019s happened but\u2026 I\u2019m not exactly complaining.\u201d</i></p><p>Did he really just say that..?<i> Your head snaps up, following the sound of his voice to where he\u2019s now stood behind you, pulling things out of his bag. \u201cW-What?\u201d</i></p><p><i>He chuckles at your sudden lack of confidence, tossing his bag to the floor. \u201cI said I\u2019m not complaining.\u201d He repeats, pulling his hair out of his towel to give it a quick shake. \u201cI\u2019ve come back to worse things in my hotel room.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Is he flirting with you? Is that what\u2019s happening? Or are you just imagining it because you\u2019re knackered?</i></p><p><i>Harry moves to stand sort of in front of you again, still completely naked, and you\u2019re really trying your best to ignore the fact that his dick is right there, staring at you innocently. It reminds you that you haven\u2019t been remotely close to one for months, haven\u2019t had the pleasure of a good fuck for a substantial amount of time, and having one sat right in front of you is making you wet between your legs.</i></p><p><i>\u201cCan stay if y\u2019want.\u201d His voice has taken on a much lower tone, one that\u2019s suggestive and maybe a little intimidating. It doesn\u2019t help the dull ache homing in your core. \u201cBed\u2019s plenty big enough for two.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You definitely heard that. Your eyes pry from his annoyingly appealing cock to his gaze, and you swear it could swallow you whole. At this point in time you\u2019d probably let it. \u201cAre you\u2026 taking the piss?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Harry shakes his head, but his eyes never leave yours, and there\u2019s so much being hinted behind them you feel like you might collapse. \u201cSaves you redressing and going back to reception after all.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You can\u2019t argue that he makes a very valid point\u2026 but you also have a little niggle in the back of your mind telling you not to.</i></p><p>Wait!<i> This is fucking Harry Styles! You\u2019re never going to get an opportunity like this again! As suggestive as he may be, even to be in the same room as him is a privilege! You\u2019re only here for a night, you\u2019re really struggling to see the real harm.</i></p><p><i>\u201cCan see you\u2019re tired, love.\u201d He breaks your silence again, but his tone still holds that depth that\u2019s making you weaker by the second.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou don\u2019t even know my name.\u201d You manage to utter, and you\u2019re surprised at how confident you sound again. You decide to go with it, challenging him with a little raise of your brows.</i></p><p><i>Harry smirks, cocking his head in a playful way. \u201cYou\u2019re right I don\u2019t, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s just as beautiful as you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You can\u2019t help but giggle, the noise rumbling from the back of your throat in a teasing yet flattered manner. \u201cHow many girls have you picked up with that line?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re the first, so if I\u2019m successful then\u2026 I\u2019ll have a one hundred percent success rating.\u201d His smirk widens as he takes a step closer to you. \u201cAre you going to tell me your name or shall I guess?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Your arm is beginning to ache with the length of time it\u2019s been holding your breasts, but you try and hold out for as long as possible before you reveal yourself to be a complete slut. \u201cAs much fun as it would be to sit here and listen to you guess, we could be here all night.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cSo enlighten me, love.\u201d He hums as he takes another step towards you, head cocking again as his hand reaches up to trace his finger over your protruding collarbone.</i></p><p><i>Your name rolls off your tongue in an oh so innocent fashion, and little do you know it has his cock twitching inches from you.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWell,\u201d He parrots your name as his tracing fingers move towards your chest, \u201cthat was gonna be my first guest.\u201d His head carefully lowers towards yours, but you\u2019re far from nervous now.</i></p><p><i>You laugh again in disbelief, gently shaking your head from side to side. You knew he was notorious for being charming, but you hadn\u2019t expected anything close to this. \u201cYou smooth fucker.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Harry giggles a little childishly, his other hand reaching to stroke the side of your face as his lips linger millimetres from yours. \u201cOh, I\u2019m glad you think so.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You\u2019ve grown impatient with your flirting, no longer able to resist his teasing when you press your lips against his. He accepts your kiss, clearly smiling against your mouth as he holds your jaw between his thumb and forefinger. His other hand moves its way down your side to your waist, eventually settling at the small of your back. You finally release your hold on your breasts, reaching both hands up to rest at the nape of his neck. Your lips begin to move with one another, learning how the other tastes and feels. All you know is that even now so early on its the best kiss you\u2019ve had the pleasure of sharing.</i></p><p><i>Harry urges you closer to him, pressing his hand into your back to that your body falls against him, and your hands tighten their grip, a few of his curls instinctively wrapping around your fingers. His kisses become a little more desperate as he guides you towards the bed, mouth coaxing yours open just enough for him to lick along your top lip. Your tongue darts to taste his, dancing with it before you completely pull his top lip between your teeth. It makes him growl from the back of his throat, squeezing your frame tighter against his.</i></p><p><i>He starts to trail his kisses from your mouth to your neck and down to your bare chest as he gingerly sits on the bed. Your eyes are closed, head rolling backwards as he begins to bruise the skin of your breasts with his lips, nipping and sucking while his hands grip your waist until you\u2019re decorated with his purple marks. You\u2019re gently massaging your hands into his hair as you sandwich yourself between his legs, and for the first time you can feel his growing length against the sensitive skin of your thigh. You trail one hand down his abdomen, boldly reaching for his stiffening cock to give it a few strokes while he makes it his work to blindly remove you of your jeans.</i></p><p><i>His hands caress the insides of your thighs upwards, his long middle finger pressing against your heat over your knickers and making you shudder a little. The damp spot has him producing another little rumble, continuously rubbing over it as he pecks at your soft stomach. \u201cSo fucking wet already, darlin\u2019.\u201d He mumbles against your skin, two fingers now rubbing up and down over your clothed folds.</i></p><p><i>You mewl at his teasing, your hand beginning to move faster and harder over his length.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat do you want, love?\u201d He presses, looking up to see your mouth slightly parted but eyes still closed. \u201cTell me what you want.\u201d His voice is calm and careful, in no way demanding, and you don\u2019t know if it\u2019s better or worse.</i></p><p><i>\u201cJust you. Just want you to fuck me.\u201d You beg, lip quivering slightly at the thought of it.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYeah?\u201d He hums with another peck to your sternum. \u201cWant me to fill you up?\u201d</i></p><p><i>You whimper again as the rhythm of his fingers quickens, and if Harry\u2019s legs weren\u2019t pressed against yours you\u2019d probably collapse from their shaking. \u201c</i>Fuck<i> yes, please.\u201d You\u2019re really begging now, and that\u2019s not like you at all. But then again, you can\u2019t remember the last time you were wound up so much to the point you had to beg for it.</i></p><p><i>Harry wastes no more time, hooking his fingers into your knickers and pulling them down with ease. He shifts himself backwards, bringing you with him until you\u2019re eventually straddling him, his stuff member teasingly grazing the inside of your thigh. You mindlessly trace your middle finger over his lips, while your other hand steadies his cock between your legs.</i></p><p><i>His hands are planting your hips into place as you lean down to pull at his lips with your teeth again, biting into them just enough that they\u2019ll be bruised for a while. Harry moans from deep within his chest, squeezing his fingertips into the flesh of your hips. With that noise you slowly ease yourself onto him, feeling an unfamiliar stretch as you sink further and further that has you wincing slightly. You gently rock yourself over him, rolling your hips against his as you continue your work on his mouth. He wraps his arms around your middle, holding you as close to him as possible as he imitates your hip movements.</i></p><p><i>\u201cFucking hell you feel good.\u201d He grunts the moment your teeth release his lips, his mouth trailing sloppy kisses along your jawline to the fleshy spot just under your ear. \u201cSo fuckin\u2019 tight, angel.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You purr at his words, allowing your hands to roam around his body, feeling every surface of him and trying to store it as best as you can in your memory. You feel one hand reach down to clench at your bum, his weight shifting ever so slightly that it causes him to hit something within you that makes you squeak. The sensation creates a burning need for more, and you shift to straighten up over him. The minor change of position has him finding a place much deeper within you, a low and drawn out moan falling from your lips at the feeling.</i></p><p><i>Harry could probably lose himself there and then at the glorious sound you\u2019re making, but he\u2019s not quite ready to let this end yet. \u201cSo fuckin pretty.\u201d He praises you, grip tightening on you again as he hastily rocks upwards into you. \u201cAll but handed to me on a plate, weren\u2019t ya?\u201d</i></p><p><i>You smile to yourself as he continues his babbling. You never thought you were one to enjoy talking during sex, but with the way Harry talks to you, you\u2019re never going to feel uncomfortable with it.</i></p><p><i>\u201cCan\u2019t believe you just wandered in here.\u201d His thrusts are growing a little hectic and chaotic as he manages to work himself up with his own words, but you don\u2019t mind, not when it\u2019s making him hit places you didn\u2019t even know existed. \u201cLike someone wanted it for us.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m not complaining.\u201d You pant, repeating his earlier words as you press your lips back to his.</i></p><p><i>\u201cNeither am I, fucking hell.\u201d He chuckles against you, his chest vibrating against yours. \u201cShould come to Barcelona more often if I\u2019m gonna get a gift like you every time I open a door.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You giggle girlishly at his flirty words, trailing a few wet kisses to his throat. \u201cMight just have to follow you around the world.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Something about your suggestion kicks something within him, and he\u2019s swiftly rolling you over so that you\u2019re on your back, legs in the air as they grip around his waist. He\u2019s stopped thrusting, he\u2019s just staring at you with a strange glint in his eye. \u201cSay that again.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You can\u2019t stop your smirk as your hands caress along his broad shoulders and down his arms. \u201cSaid I might follow you around the world.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAnd why\u2019d you want to do that, love?\u201d He presses, wetting his lips with his tongue as he waits for your reply.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I if I\u2019d get a fuck like this out of it every night?\u201d You challenge, your arms wrapping around his tensed biceps.</i></p><p><i>He groans out, his pace finally picking up again as he resumes his thrusting into you. \u201cWhere the fuck did they find you?\u201d He begs the question as he buries his head into the crook of your neck.</i></p><p><i>His new pace is pushing you towards your orgasm quickly, and you can feel the familiar burn rising from your core. You clench around him in preparation, bunching his hair into your fist as he hits you in just the right spot. Your nails drag against the skin of his back as you moan his name out in a low and fucked out tone. Your undoing has him ready to go, and as you press your hips completely into him, he feels his state climax, little white spots clouding his vision as your name falls from his lips over and over in little desperate pants.</i></p><p><i>You hold him to you for as long as possible, massaging your fingertips into the crown of his scalp while he harasses your neck with more bruises. Ordinarily you\u2019d be scolding him for it given you\u2019re in another country for a fucking conference, but you\u2019re past caring at this point.

                "content": "<p><h2><i>Flashback Episode! - Harry gets more than he bargained for in his hotel room after a show in Barcelona.</i></h2><p><b><i>A/N: Goood morning my babies! This took me fucking hours yesterday because I actually spent the first part of it watching</i> Wimbledon<i> (if you haven&rsquo;t seen it, do go watch it). Prepare yourselves for 4k of flirting and filth, I can&rsquo;t tell you if the filth is actually good or not, I wrote it in bed late last night&hellip; Thoughts please! Kate xxx</i></b></p><p><b></b><i></i><i></i>&ldquo;Mum, can we watch <i>Wimbledon</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>Your head peers up from the feast you&rsquo;re preparing for your Sunday morning breakfast to Fee who asked the question. &ldquo;Course we can!&rdquo;</p><p>You miss the glance that Harry and Dillon share, but Tom notices and is immediately confused.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s so great &lsquo;bout Wimbledon? It&rsquo;s April; you&rsquo;re two months early.&rdquo; Tom queries, scratching the back of his head with a frown.</p><p>A loud laugh rips from the back of your throat as you crack an egg over the frying pan. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a film, Tom. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve watched it with us before.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost certain he has, love.&rdquo; Harry chirps in, rolling his head back on his neck to look at you from his chair. &ldquo;Pretty sure he called Paul Bettany &lsquo;a pretty ponse&rsquo; once.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, that film!&rdquo; Tom smacks his forehead with his palm. &ldquo;What d&rsquo;ya want t&rsquo;watch that shit for?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Probably wants relive the night she met Dad.&rdquo; Dillon mumbles.</p><p>You spin around on your heel and scowl at the occupied dining table, just in time to see Harry clip the back of his son&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;Excuse me?!&rdquo;</p><p>~</p><p>January 2020</p><p><i>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I know.&rdquo; You mumble into your phone, ending the call before your brother pesters you more. Considering the late hour you&rsquo;re surprised it&rsquo;s so busy in the lobby of the hotel, but no one actually seems to be checking in.</i></p><p><i>You look around the room in confusion, a frown etched on your features as you wander up to the reception desk. There are people everywhere, mostly girls&hellip;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Hi, I should have a room booked?&rdquo; You tell the receptionist and give over your name. You may have noticed the amount of jittery girls in the lobby, but the next five minutes is a tiresome blur.</i></p><p><i>You&rsquo;ve spent the entire day on a plane from Australia. The journey wasn&rsquo;t easy, in fact you&rsquo;d barely slept the whole twenty four hours you were sat down. Before that you&rsquo;d been at an event for two days that lasted sixteen hours each day, and that&rsquo;s a long journey from London for the sake of two fucking days. You&rsquo;re exhausted, and in dire need of a good nights sleep.</i></p><p><i>You sign the paperwork and take the key handed to you, ambling towards the elevator as you roll your head from side to side. You don&rsquo;t actually remember the lift ride up at all, only the wheel of your suitcase getting stuck in the gap between the doors on your way out.</i></p><p><i>Typically the room assigned to you is at the very end of a seemingly ridiculously long corridor, but the moment the door is open your irritation vanishes. You really are half asleep, eyes barely open as you leave your suitcase right by the door. You don&rsquo;t notice the steam seeping through the door to the right, or the fact that someone else&rsquo;s belongings are littered literally all over the living room of the suite.</i></p><p><i>Ah, another thing you didn&rsquo;t notice. It&rsquo;s a fucking suite, you&rsquo;re never given anything more than a boxy twin room.</i></p><p><i>You&rsquo;ve somehow managed to find your way into the large bedroom, already stripping out of your t-shirt and casting it to the ground without a care for where it lands. You&rsquo;ve just relieved your breasts from your bra when someone clears their throat behind you.</i></p><p><i>You feel your entire being heat up as you gasp, covering your breasts with your arms as you turn around. You must look like a deer caught in the headlights, your eyes wide as you stare into the eyes of the intruder.</i></p><p><i>But he&rsquo;s not just any intruder. Even with a towel wrapped around his signature locks it was still so very obviously him. Those unmistakable emerald eyes, that jaw line you&rsquo;ve admired for years now.</i></p><p><i>But even with all of this, on top of your debilitated state, and the smirk that holds his features, as well as the fact that he&rsquo;s literally stood there in </i>nothing<i>, nor is he </i>trying<i> to cover anything up, you find yourself overwhelmed with anger.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What the fuck are you doing?!&rdquo; You squeal at him, awkwardly standing in the middle of the room as you really begin to berate him. &ldquo;Why the hell are you in here?! Standing there with no fucking clothes on like it&rsquo;s no fucking big deal?! Do you do that all the time?! Just waltz into people&rsquo;s rooms because you think you can?! Are you an arsehole?!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>You carry on, but Harry&rsquo;s struggling not to find it amusing since what you&rsquo;re screaming slowly making less and less sense. As much as he&rsquo;s enjoying your little rant, he feels the need to put you out of your misery.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna stop you there, love&hellip;&rdquo; He objected, simply glancing to the duffle bag sat on the end of the bed that was gaping open.</i></p><p><i>You grimace at his interruption, but follow his gaze. There it is. His belongings, which have very obviously been sat there since well before you turned up, especially given the state of the unmade bed. As if to fuel his own ego and mortify you further, he continues to trail his gaze around the room, touching on each and every item that&rsquo;s his.</i></p><p><i>You&rsquo;re filled with dread as Harry begins making his way to you at a tediously slow pace. Your eyes drop to the floor in your embarrassment, one hand running over your face to attempt to cover your fluster while the other still covers your naked breasts. &ldquo;Oh my God. </i>Fuck<i>. Fuck, fuck, fuck.&rdquo; You heavily cringe over your words, unable to look anywhere other than the ugly carpet beneath your feet. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m so sorry. Fuck I&rsquo;m so tired, I&rsquo;m so fucking sorry.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Harry can tell you&rsquo;re tired. He could tell from the moment he saw your face, because regardless of how wide your eyes had grown, the bags underneath were unmistakeable. As was the fact that even through your shouting your exhaustion was apparent in the way your words cracked and you made very little sense most of the time.</i></p><p><i>You&rsquo;re still apologising, going through your entire thirty six hour day as if it would make a difference, saying that this was definitely the room the reception had given you a key for, if you&rsquo;d have known you wouldn&rsquo;t have come in, obviously.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t need to apologise, love.&rdquo; Harry assures you, suddenly much closer to you than he had been the last time you had eyes on him. &ldquo;Admittedly this is the first time it&rsquo;s happened but&hellip; I&rsquo;m not exactly complaining.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Did he really just say that..?<i> Your head snaps up, following the sound of his voice to where he&rsquo;s now stood behind you, pulling things out of his bag. &ldquo;W-What?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>He chuckles at your sudden lack of confidence, tossing his bag to the floor. &ldquo;I said I&rsquo;m not complaining.&rdquo; He repeats, pulling his hair out of his towel to give it a quick shake. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come back to worse things in my hotel room.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Is he flirting with you? Is that what&rsquo;s happening? Or are you just imagining it because you&rsquo;re knackered?</i></p><p><i>Harry moves to stand sort of in front of you again, still completely naked, and you&rsquo;re really trying your best to ignore the fact that his dick is right there, staring at you innocently. It reminds you that you haven&rsquo;t been remotely close to one for months, haven&rsquo;t had the pleasure of a good fuck for a substantial amount of time, and having one sat right in front of you is making you wet between your legs.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Can stay if y&rsquo;want.&rdquo; His voice has taken on a much lower tone, one that&rsquo;s suggestive and maybe a little intimidating. It doesn&rsquo;t help the dull ache homing in your core. &ldquo;Bed&rsquo;s plenty big enough for two.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>You definitely heard that. Your eyes pry from his annoyingly appealing cock to his gaze, and you swear it could swallow you whole. At this point in time you&rsquo;d probably let it. &ldquo;Are you&hellip; taking the piss?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Harry shakes his head, but his eyes never leave yours, and there&rsquo;s so much being hinted behind them you feel like you might collapse. &ldquo;Saves you redressing and going back to reception after all.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>You can&rsquo;t argue that he makes a very valid point&hellip; but you also have a little niggle in the back of your mind telling you not to.</i></p><p>Wait!<i> This is fucking Harry Styles! You&rsquo;re never going to get an opportunity like this again! As suggestive as he may be, even to be in the same room as him is a privilege! You&rsquo;re only here for a night, you&rsquo;re really struggling to see the real harm.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Can see you&rsquo;re tired, love.&rdquo; He breaks your silence again, but his tone still holds that depth that&rsquo;s making you weaker by the second.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t even know my name.&rdquo; You manage to utter, and you&rsquo;re surprised at how confident you sound again. You decide to go with it, challenging him with a little raise of your brows.</i></p><p><i>Harry smirks, cocking his head in a playful way. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right I don&rsquo;t, but I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s just as beautiful as you.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>You can&rsquo;t help but giggle, the noise rumbling from the back of your throat in a teasing yet flattered manner. &ldquo;How many girls have you picked up with that line?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the first, so if I&rsquo;m successful then&hellip; I&rsquo;ll have a one hundred percent success rating.&rdquo; His smirk widens as he takes a step closer to you. &ldquo;Are you going to tell me your name or shall I guess?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Your arm is beginning to ache with the length of time it&rsquo;s been holding your breasts, but you try and hold out for as long as possible before you reveal yourself to be a complete slut. &ldquo;As much fun as it would be to sit here and listen to you guess, we could be here all night.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;So enlighten me, love.&rdquo; He hums as he takes another step towards you, head cocking again as his hand reaches up to trace his finger over your protruding collarbone.</i></p><p><i>Your name rolls off your tongue in an oh so innocent fashion, and little do you know it has his cock twitching inches from you.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; He parrots your name as his tracing fingers move towards your chest, &ldquo;that was gonna be my first guest.&rdquo; His head carefully lowers towards yours, but you&rsquo;re far from nervous now.</i></p><p><i>You laugh again in disbelief, gently shaking your head from side to side. You knew he was notorious for being charming, but you hadn&rsquo;t expected anything close to this. &ldquo;You smooth fucker.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Harry giggles a little childishly, his other hand reaching to stroke the side of your face as his lips linger millimetres from yours. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m glad you think so.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>You&rsquo;ve grown impatient with your flirting, no longer able to resist his teasing when you press your lips against his. He accepts your kiss, clearly smiling against your mouth as he holds your jaw between his thumb and forefinger. His other hand moves its way down your side to your waist, eventually settling at the small of your back. You finally release your hold on your breasts, reaching both hands up to rest at the nape of his neck. Your lips begin to move with one another, learning how the other tastes and feels. All you know is that even now so early on its the best kiss you&rsquo;ve had the pleasure of sharing.</i></p><p><i>Harry urges you closer to him, pressing his hand into your back to that your body falls against him, and your hands tighten their grip, a few of his curls instinctively wrapping around your fingers. His kisses become a little more desperate as he guides you towards the bed, mouth coaxing yours open just enough for him to lick along your top lip. Your tongue darts to taste his, dancing with it before you completely pull his top lip between your teeth. It makes him growl from the back of his throat, squeezing your frame tighter against his.</i></p><p><i>He starts to trail his kisses from your mouth to your neck and down to your bare chest as he gingerly sits on the bed. Your eyes are closed, head rolling backwards as he begins to bruise the skin of your breasts with his lips, nipping and sucking while his hands grip your waist until you&rsquo;re decorated with his purple marks. You&rsquo;re gently massaging your hands into his hair as you sandwich yourself between his legs, and for the first time you can feel his growing length against the sensitive skin of your thigh. You trail one hand down his abdomen, boldly reaching for his stiffening cock to give it a few strokes while he makes it his work to blindly remove you of your jeans.</i></p><p><i>His hands caress the insides of your thighs upwards, his long middle finger pressing against your heat over your knickers and making you shudder a little. The damp spot has him producing another little rumble, continuously rubbing over it as he pecks at your soft stomach. &ldquo;So fucking wet already, darlin&rsquo;.&rdquo; He mumbles against your skin, two fingers now rubbing up and down over your clothed folds.</i></p><p><i>You mewl at his teasing, your hand beginning to move faster and harder over his length.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What do you want, love?&rdquo; He presses, looking up to see your mouth slightly parted but eyes still closed. &ldquo;Tell me what you want.&rdquo; His voice is calm and careful, in no way demanding, and you don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s better or worse.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Just you. Just want you to fuck me.&rdquo; You beg, lip quivering slightly at the thought of it.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; He hums with another peck to your sternum. &ldquo;Want me to fill you up?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>You whimper again as the rhythm of his fingers quickens, and if Harry&rsquo;s legs weren&rsquo;t pressed against yours you&rsquo;d probably collapse from their shaking. &ldquo;</i>Fuck<i> yes, please.&rdquo; You&rsquo;re really begging now, and that&rsquo;s not like you at all. But then again, you can&rsquo;t remember the last time you were wound up so much to the point you had to beg for it.</i></p><p><i>Harry wastes no more time, hooking his fingers into your knickers and pulling them down with ease. He shifts himself backwards, bringing you with him until you&rsquo;re eventually straddling him, his stuff member teasingly grazing the inside of your thigh. You mindlessly trace your middle finger over his lips, while your other hand steadies his cock between your legs.</i></p><p><i>His hands are planting your hips into place as you lean down to pull at his lips with your teeth again, biting into them just enough that they&rsquo;ll be bruised for a while. Harry moans from deep within his chest, squeezing his fingertips into the flesh of your hips. With that noise you slowly ease yourself onto him, feeling an unfamiliar stretch as you sink further and further that has you wincing slightly. You gently rock yourself over him, rolling your hips against his as you continue your work on his mouth. He wraps his arms around your middle, holding you as close to him as possible as he imitates your hip movements.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Fucking hell you feel good.&rdquo; He grunts the moment your teeth release his lips, his mouth trailing sloppy kisses along your jawline to the fleshy spot just under your ear. &ldquo;So fuckin&rsquo; tight, angel.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>You purr at his words, allowing your hands to roam around his body, feeling every surface of him and trying to store it as best as you can in your memory. You feel one hand reach down to clench at your bum, his weight shifting ever so slightly that it causes him to hit something within you that makes you squeak. The sensation creates a burning need for more, and you shift to straighten up over him. The minor change of position has him finding a place much deeper within you, a low and drawn out moan falling from your lips at the feeling.</i></p><p><i>Harry could probably lose himself there and then at the glorious sound you&rsquo;re making, but he&rsquo;s not quite ready to let this end yet. &ldquo;So fuckin pretty.&rdquo; He praises you, grip tightening on you again as he hastily rocks upwards into you. &ldquo;All but handed to me on a plate, weren&rsquo;t ya?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>You smile to yourself as he continues his babbling. You never thought you were one to enjoy talking during sex, but with the way Harry talks to you, you&rsquo;re never going to feel uncomfortable with it.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t believe you just wandered in here.&rdquo; His thrusts are growing a little hectic and chaotic as he manages to work himself up with his own words, but you don&rsquo;t mind, not when it&rsquo;s making him hit places you didn&rsquo;t even know existed. &ldquo;Like someone wanted it for us.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not complaining.&rdquo; You pant, repeating his earlier words as you press your lips back to his.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Neither am I, fucking hell.&rdquo; He chuckles against you, his chest vibrating against yours. &ldquo;Should come to Barcelona more often if I&rsquo;m gonna get a gift like you every time I open a door.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>You giggle girlishly at his flirty words, trailing a few wet kisses to his throat. &ldquo;Might just have to follow you around the world.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Something about your suggestion kicks something within him, and he&rsquo;s swiftly rolling you over so that you&rsquo;re on your back, legs in the air as they grip around his waist. He&rsquo;s stopped thrusting, he&rsquo;s just staring at you with a strange glint in his eye. &ldquo;Say that again.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>You can&rsquo;t stop your smirk as your hands caress along his broad shoulders and down his arms. &ldquo;Said I might follow you around the world.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;And why&rsquo;d you want to do that, love?&rdquo; He presses, wetting his lips with his tongue as he waits for your reply.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Why wouldn&rsquo;t I if I&rsquo;d get a fuck like this out of it every night?&rdquo; You challenge, your arms wrapping around his tensed biceps.</i></p><p><i>He groans out, his pace finally picking up again as he resumes his thrusting into you. &ldquo;Where the fuck did they find you?&rdquo; He begs the question as he buries his head into the crook of your neck.</i></p><p><i>His new pace is pushing you towards your orgasm quickly, and you can feel the familiar burn rising from your core. You clench around him in preparation, bunching his hair into your fist as he hits you in just the right spot. Your nails drag against the skin of his back as you moan his name out in a low and fucked out tone. Your undoing has him ready to go, and as you press your hips completely into him, he feels his state climax, little white spots clouding his vision as your name falls from his lips over and over in little desperate pants.</i></p><p><i>You hold him to you for as long as possible, massaging your fingertips into the crown of his scalp while he harasses your neck with more bruises. Ordinarily you&rsquo;d be scolding him for it given you&rsquo;re in another country for a fucking conference, but you&rsquo;re past caring at this point.
