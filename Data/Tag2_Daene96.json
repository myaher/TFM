Long story short, I got a good start on quite a few of them, before getting distracted (by some magazine covers, a trailer, and Schitt\u2019s Creek), and then getting more tired than anticipated by a new role at work. I was finding it a little difficult to write, but I think I\u2019ve managed to finish this one. Here\u2019s to hoping I get a few more of these finished this week! <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0pTkFS9lGdxKvRzqtPEjig\"><b>@alexisgalvez53</b></a><b> asked for:</b></i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m running away from home - Meet cute with another passenger on the train going to the same destination&rdquo; </b>Now I\u2019m not entirely sure that this counts as a \u2018meet cute\u2019, but it\u2019s what my brain threw out at me. I know this probably isn\u2019t what you had in mind, but I hope you like it? :)</i></p><p>She finds herself looking around, for something, anything, a diversion to pull her focus and calm her racing heart. She glances around for the one thing sure to have her daydreaming, but the dark mop atop the brooding expression is nowhere to be found. She sees him the mornings that she comes, often with a coffee cup, always with headphones, the black wires camouflaged by his dark curls until they reach the ends of his hair, and then disappearing into a jacket pocket. She recalls the last time she saw him, on one especially warm spring day two weeks ago, he had been without a jacket, and the cord had disappeared into the pocket of a pair of rather well fitted jeans. There had been a fading bruise around his eye, and he had tried to hide it with his hair. She often finds herself wondering what he is listening to, whether it\u2019s music or a podcast, an audio book perhaps, or even nothing at all. She often wears headphones with nothing playing, a sign to others that she does not wish to be bothered without actually having to say so. It doesn\u2019t always work, but Daenerys does it regardless. </p><p>She cannot see him this particular morning, and Daenerys finds herself missing the distraction he provides. If you asked her to explain it, she would not be able to, but she finds his handsome face a comfort, something as familiar as her journey to the train station. She pulls at the hold-all on her right shoulder, it feels awkward as it knocks against the small handbag slung across her body. She clutches the ticket in her hand tighter, the first time she\u2019s actually purchased one despite coming here at least twice a week for the past year. </p><p>She feels half in a daze, is she really doing this? Can she really do this? Can she really leave Viserys to his destructive self? She tries to swallow the knot in her throat, the guilt settling in her stomach. She reminds herself of all the broken promises of change, the shattered apologies that grew all the more hollow. No, she has to do this; <i>needs to do this</i>, it is the only way. </p><p>It hadn\u2019t always been like this. He had been loving and caring, to a point, and she did have some good memories of the two of them after mother had&hellip; But now\u2026 all that was left was self loathing wrapped in a cruel shell, and Daenerys could no longer take being his verbal punching bag. </p><p>She sees the train approach, and as everyone on the platform shuffles forward, she takes a moment for a deep breath and joins them. She can do this, and she will. It is after rush hour, so it is not as busy as it might have been, but Daenerys still struggles to spot a seat. She wanders up the aisle before she spots four empty seats at a table in the middle of the carriage, and places her bag in one of the seats before shuffling in and sitting next to the window. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never actually seen you get on the train before.\u201d Her eyes snap open at the question, and she sees curly hair sat across from her, his expression gentle, a tentative smile forming on his lips. She had not heard him shuffle into the seat opposite, had purposely not worn her headphones. </p><p>She opens her mouth to reply, before realising she needs to clear her throat and that she hasn\u2019t actually spoken yet today. \u201cI haven\u2019t actually got on the train before.\u201d</p><p>He nods, and there is something that Daenerys finds comforting about his face, a seed of trust sprouting within her, and she\u2019s not sure why she decides to latch onto it. </p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d There\u2019s a small quirk to his eyebrow at her response before his eyes glance down and widen slightly, and Dany drops her gaze as she realises what he has seen on her arm. She tugs on her sleeve, but it is too late, he has already seen it. The fading yellow around her wrist only visible in certain light, but it was still there, the pallor of her skin different. \u201cI\u2019m running away actually.\u201d She\u2019s not sure what has possessed her to tell him, this stranger, about where she is going with a clear overnight bag, but Daenerys finds a slither of comfort warming her spine as she does so.  </p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d She only nods her head in reply, before ducking her head to avoid his kind eyes.</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d Her head snaps up, and she sees the earnestness plain on his face.

Here&rsquo;s to hoping I get a few more of these finished this week! <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0pTkFS9lGdxKvRzqtPEjig\"><b>@alexisgalvez53</b></a><b> asked for:</b></i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m running away from home - Meet cute with another passenger on the train going to the same destination&rdquo; </b>Now I&rsquo;m not entirely sure that this counts as a &lsquo;meet cute&rsquo;, but it&rsquo;s what my brain threw out at me. I know this probably isn&rsquo;t what you had in mind, but I hope you like it? :)</i></p><p>She finds herself looking around, for something, anything, a diversion to pull her focus and calm her racing heart. She glances around for the one thing sure to have her daydreaming, but the dark mop atop the brooding expression is nowhere to be found. She sees him the mornings that she comes, often with a coffee cup, always with headphones, the black wires camouflaged by his dark curls until they reach the ends of his hair, and then disappearing into a jacket pocket. She recalls the last time she saw him, on one especially warm spring day two weeks ago, he had been without a jacket, and the cord had disappeared into the pocket of a pair of rather well fitted jeans. There had been a fading bruise around his eye, and he had tried to hide it with his hair. She often finds herself wondering what he is listening to, whether it&rsquo;s music or a podcast, an audio book perhaps, or even nothing at all. She often wears headphones with nothing playing, a sign to others that she does not wish to be bothered without actually having to say so. It doesn&rsquo;t always work, but Daenerys does it regardless. </p><p>She cannot see him this particular morning, and Daenerys finds herself missing the distraction he provides. If you asked her to explain it, she would not be able to, but she finds his handsome face a comfort, something as familiar as her journey to the train station. She pulls at the hold-all on her right shoulder, it feels awkward as it knocks against the small handbag slung across her body. She clutches the ticket in her hand tighter, the first time she&rsquo;s actually purchased one despite coming here at least twice a week for the past year. </p><p>She feels half in a daze, is she really doing this? Can she really do this? Can she really leave Viserys to his destructive self? She tries to swallow the knot in her throat, the guilt settling in her stomach. She reminds herself of all the broken promises of change, the shattered apologies that grew all the more hollow. No, she has to do this; <i>needs to do this</i>, it is the only way. </p><p>It hadn&rsquo;t always been like this. He had been loving and caring, to a point, and she did have some good memories of the two of them after mother had&hellip; But now&hellip; all that was left was self loathing wrapped in a cruel shell, and Daenerys could no longer take being his verbal punching bag. </p><p>She sees the train approach, and as everyone on the platform shuffles forward, she takes a moment for a deep breath and joins them. She can do this, and she will. It is after rush hour, so it is not as busy as it might have been, but Daenerys still struggles to spot a seat. She wanders up the aisle before she spots four empty seats at a table in the middle of the carriage, and places her bag in one of the seats before shuffling in and sitting next to the window. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never actually seen you get on the train before.&rdquo; Her eyes snap open at the question, and she sees curly hair sat across from her, his expression gentle, a tentative smile forming on his lips. She had not heard him shuffle into the seat opposite, had purposely not worn her headphones. </p><p>She opens her mouth to reply, before realising she needs to clear her throat and that she hasn&rsquo;t actually spoken yet today. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t actually got on the train before.&rdquo;</p><p>He nods, and there is something that Daenerys finds comforting about his face, a seed of trust sprouting within her, and she&rsquo;s not sure why she decides to latch onto it. </p><p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s a small quirk to his eyebrow at her response before his eyes glance down and widen slightly, and Dany drops her gaze as she realises what he has seen on her arm. She tugs on her sleeve, but it is too late, he has already seen it. The fading yellow around her wrist only visible in certain light, but it was still there, the pallor of her skin different. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m running away actually.&rdquo; She&rsquo;s not sure what has possessed her to tell him, this stranger, about where she is going with a clear overnight bag, but Daenerys finds a slither of comfort warming her spine as she does so.  </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; She only nods her head in reply, before ducking her head to avoid his kind eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Me too.&rdquo; Her head snaps up, and she sees the earnestness plain on his face. That&rsquo;s when Daenerys notices it. He has a large duffel bag today, and when she looks back up at him, he&rsquo;s fiddling with his hair and her eyes widen. It wasn&rsquo;t just a fading black eye he was trying to conceal.</p><p>&ldquo;You know, it&rsquo;s not the first time I&rsquo;ve run away?&rdquo; She quirks her brow at his admission, and he shrugs. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s lonely. I find it lonely here, but, people are still there, you know?&rdquo; And Daenerys does, <i>she does</i>. Despite the loneliness, she still finds a comfort in knowing Vis is still there, and she hates it. Hates it because it&rsquo;s why she stayed so long, why she let the voice in her head chant about how having him was better than having no family at all. </p><p>A weighted quiet settles over them, before he breaks it. &ldquo;Want to run away together?&rdquo; She should say no, knows that she should say no. But when she looks up and into his eyes, she finds herself nodding. </p><p>He allows a small smile, an understanding silence overcoming them both. A long moment passes, and then he reaches across the table and holds out his hand. Daenerys feels her body stiffen for a moment, before she relaxes. She hesitates for a second before she reaches her own hand out, and closes it around his. He squeezes softly, and Dany finds a comforting warmth at the gesture, spreading from their joined hands to the rest of her body. She can feel pressure pricking at her eyes, and she closes them. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Jon, by the way.&rdquo; She blinks, and they both ignore the tear that escapes. </p><p>&ldquo;Nice to meet you Jon. I&rsquo;m Daenerys.&rdquo; </p></p>",

Anyway, it&rsquo;s just some random fluff about Dany and Sansa after the war is over and everyone is happy. Bc I know s8 is going to crush me soon and I like to dream.</b></p><p>Daenerys found Sansa in the gardens. She didn\u2019t have to do much looking. More often than not Sansa spent any downtime she had surrounded by the extensive greenery of the palace gardens. It was one of the few places the girl seemed to be able to find solace in a city that had taken so much from her.</p><p>It was a beautiful place, especially on a beautiful day. The flowers were in bloom and the leaves on the trees were a bright shade of green. Sunlight dripped lazily above and coated the whole garden in a sense of warmth. Dany saw Sansa before the girl noticed her approaching. She was sitting on the grass, her skirt spread out around her, her eyes were closed and her face was placid. Her red hair was stunning, the backdrop of the azure sky made it look like a beautiful sunset over the water.</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cSansa,\u201d Dany spoke softly, afraid to ruin the serenity of the moment.</p><p>\u201cDany, hello,\u201d Sansa said with a soft smile.</p><p>Dany, it was still strange sometimes to hear the name coming from someone who wasn\u2019t her brother. But she liked the way it sounded when Sansa said it. It was soft and caring, and sometimes in the nights, it was raw and passionate. </p><p>\u201cEnjoying the nice weather?\u201d Dany asked, taking a seat on the grass. </p><p>\u201cYes, quite so.\u201d</p><p>The spring was refreshing after the cold of the winter. The breeze carried around the scent of petals and the sound of carefree laughter.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d check on our little one,\u201d Sansa said.</p><p>The girl gestured to the ground next to them where a little tree was sprouting up.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s coming along nicely.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys remembered planting the tree. It was after the war had ended. So much had been lost, completely and utterly destroyed. Realistically, she knew a tree couldn\u2019t change of that. But it helped both the girls feel better, even if it was silly. It was nice to have something growing.</p><p>\u201cAre you tired?\u201d Dany looked over at Sansa who had closed her eyes again.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m alright,\u201d Sansa said.</p><p>Dany knew she was lying. Sansa hadn\u2019t gotten a single good night\u2019s sleep since they arrived. Honestly, neither had Dany. Sometimes she thought it would be years until anyone in the kingdom was able to sleep soundly without the constant chase of nightmares.</p><p>\u201cLay your head on me, you can sleep now.\u201d<br/><br/></p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. I have work to do,\u201d she seemed to suddenly remember the overwhelming number of tasks ahead of them as she stirred out of her calm.<br/></p><p>\u201cSansa, you have done more work than anyone in all of the Seven Kingdoms,\u201d Dany took her hand gently, \u201cright now, you need to rest.\u201d</p><p>Sansa seemed to consider protesting but ultimately gave in after a stern look. She lay her head down on Dany\u2019s lap and closed her eyes. </p><p>Dany ran her fingers through Sansa\u2019s auburn locks. Her hair was smooth and soft and possibly Dany\u2019s favorite thing in the world, well aside from maybe her eyes, or her smile. After a few minutes, Dany reached out to a plant next to her and carefully plucked a few blooms by the stems.

Like Jon is Aegons third child, Dany is Aerys third child, Arya is Ned\u2019s third child, and Tyrion is Tywins third child. There seems to be so much importance on the characters who were the third kid. Maybe not Arya as much since she\u2019s the only one whose mother didn\u2019t die in childbirth with her but she\u2019s still so important to the story line that it makes me wonder.",
        "answer": "<p>Oh, definitely. The third child is one that does not inherit the title, nor is ever the heir at any point (until the firstborn has a child of their own). Like Benjen Stark or Loras Tyrell, the third child has to seek their own glory by their own merits, otherwise they fall into the shadows of their elder siblings. In short, the third child isn\u2019t remarkable or particularly remembered unless they take the initiative to make something of themselves. </p><p>Which is exactly what Jon, Dany, Arya and Tyrion are all about. Jon is a special case, given he never knew his siblings, but it very much applies to him re: Robb and even hypothetically with Aegon who would have been the Crown Prince - not Jon himself. </p><p>It reinforces the idea of them being outcasts or destined to never surpass their siblings - but in fact, they\u2019ve all defied expectations. </p><p>Regarding Arya\u2019s mother not dying in childbirth - true, that\u2019s a marked difference from the rest. But every parallel doesn\u2019t need to be exactly alike. In the same way that Tyrion doesn\u2019t have a beast of his own, or Bran isn\u2019t a third child, or Dany doesn\u2019t warg the way Jon, Arya or Bran do, it\u2019s about what such a parallel offers to the characters themselves. </p><p>Arya\u2019s mother did not die in childbirth, but she still grew up feeling insecure about her mother\u2019s affections. She still ends up motherless, a lost child, desperately wishing for her family. Not unlike the rest, really. </p><p>Regardless of the specifics of their situation, I think it ultimately comes down to the fact , Jon, Arya, Dany, Tyrion - and Bran - started from a position in the shadows and are emerging quickly to the top. The unexpected heroes, if you will. </p>",
