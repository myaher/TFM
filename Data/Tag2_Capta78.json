Instead, that ending scene felt hollow because again, there was no emotional build up between the two beforehand.\n\u201c</p><p>- <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/b01sms/half_in_the_bag_captain_marvel/eicb8ai/\">Source\u00a0\u00a0</a><br/></p></blockquote><p>This. And it got me thinking.<br/></p><p><i>\u201cI have nothing to prove to you.\u201d</i><br/></p><p>It is <b><i>such </i></b>a self-empowering line, but the reason it is that empowering in real life is because <b><i>we overcome \u201ca history\u201d</i></b> of something with someone. That history and the feelings of internal tension it creates are never sufficiently touched upon in the film, imo. There is punch to that scene, but on an iconic, symbolic level - if you have experienced it, you can identify, but that\u2019s because you know what kind of emotional connection comes with scenes like this one, not because the film itself really shows the emotional struggle that underlies it. I think that is a true shame, and it makes me surprisingly annoyed because I felt really invested in Carol\u2019s struggle as I imagined it to be in real life scenarios.<br/></p><p>The more I think about this wonderful moment of self-liberation at the end, the less oomph I get out of it in the grand scale of Captain Marvel\u2019s storytelling. Not because it is not in principle\u00a0a great moment, but because the struggles it draws upon are given footnotes\u2019 share of real reflection. It is supposed to encompass <i>all of her moments of being put down</i>, but that is just too thin, given that all we get of her struggles on Earth are flashbacks. Meanwhile the depth of her connection to the Kree and Yon-Rogg is almost not shown at all, which is a weird choice given that the twist of the film is related to them - they are, for all purposes, the main antagonistic force. Six years, people. SIX <b>years</b>. <br/></p><p>So, the writing does not do the moment enough justice, in my opinion, because it does not really\u00a0<b>show </b>the emotional conflictedness and meaningfulness of the betrayal twist to Carol on a personal level. Yon-Rogg ought to be a psychological nightmare of an antagonist to Carol Danvers given their backstory and level of closeness. But the film never manages to capture that level of internal turmoil, conflict, and <i><b>difficulty </b></i>that this connection ought to create for Carol. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>In order for that impact of what we knew about Carol/Vers at the beginning of the film to be truly poignant as it is turned upside down, <b>the film should really take the time to show a continuing sense of conflict</b> within Carol regarding: <br/></p><ul><li>her loyalties, the personal connections she has formed with Yon-Rogg and the Kree vs the lost connection she has with Maria/life on Earth; </li><li>Yon-Rogg taking the place of her original mentor whom he kills and stealing Carol\u2019s life from her even as he saves her life at the same time; </li><li>the fact that Carol has come to genuinely like being a \u201cnoble warrior hero\u201d while now knowing it is not as noble as it first felt; </li><li>the upsetting sense that Carol effectively \u201cbelongs\u201d nowhere and with no one in particular now (except with herself, of course)(on second thought, that <i>is</i> addressed in the haunted look she has at the dinner table scene); </li><li>the fact that she is about to kill her friends from Starforce (Att-Lass, for instance; \u201cthe only family she has\u201d as Brie put it in Brazil); </li><li>etc.</li></ul><p>At the end Carol cracks jokes with Starforce \u2013 the people who have been her family and friends, for better or worse, and whom she is now about to beat/kill. It is supposed to come off as this fun, empowering moment, I guess, but from storytelling\u2019s perspective it is <b>tonally </b><i>really weird</i>. I don\u2019t remember Steve doing that with Tony, or Thor with Loki \u2013 it further undermines the emotional impact of the devastation the entire betrayal twist of the film is supposed to have.</p><p>Remember, even though factually Carol\u2019s life with the Kree may be based on falsehoods and deceit at its inception, the feelings she develops toward everyone and their lives are genuine and real. That is what makes the twist so painful. That is what makes self-liberation a tough journey, but ultimately a really rewarding one.<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"227\" data-orig-height=\"255\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8af44e5e3587835378097fffcc198b72/tumblr_inline_ppt1pxyO9I1qhwoov_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"227\" data-orig-height=\"255\"/></figure>",

(it\u2019s been said before, but what a piece of trick casting: I was absolutely sure this was another of his Hollywood villain roles, along the lines of e.g. Ready Player One.)</p><p>Final things about this movie: it\u2019s so much about love over power\u2014how Carol rejects the domination of the Kree for the connections she has on Earth; how Talos wants to find not the lightspeed engine but his family and people\u2014and you leave it with your head a little higher and your stride a little bolder, which is all anyone could ask.</p><p>No, wait, final final point: I went to see it in the Royal Box at the Odeon Leicester Square, and you\u2019ve got to pay a little more but it\u2019s SO SO worth it. complimentary popcorn! drinks brought to your seat! a recliner for a chair! amazing sound! perfect view! you couldn\u2019t do it for every film, but I know exactly where I\u2019m going to be for Episode IX this winter.</p>",
