It is a terrible, terrible omen for what will be a terrible, terrible day. Still, a scowl graces your face as you freshen up as best as you can and then out to the hall. You manage to get down the stairs, which, in itself is a miracle that you didn\u2019t fall flat on your face, but also, the aching in your leg softens when you sit down on the couch.</p><p>You rest your leg up on the couch, too tired to get up. You stare into the kitchen, wondering where your sister is. Normally, she\u2019d be the one to wake you up by jumping on your bed and snuggling up to you. For a minute, panic seizes your throat, making you shoot up to call her name, but then you hear her obnoxious shouting out back and you lie down.</p><p><i>\u2018She\u2019s fine.\u2019</i> You grab the remote, thumb pausing over the power button.<i> \u2018But\u2026 I should check if she\u2019s wearing her boots. Motherfucker.\u2019 </i>Grabbing your cane, you swing your legs to the edge and push yourself up, limping to the back door. If she gets sick, then it\u2019ll most definitely be more crying, more whining, more work for you. Opening the door, the scent of petrichor immediately wafts to your nose and you smile slightly despite the intensifying cramp in your leg.</p><p>\u201cYo! Parasite!\u201d you yell, walking to the porch in your slippers and glaring distastefully at the drops that pour from the overhang of the roof. Immediately, your sister in her bright yellow boots and pink-as-hell jacket comes running into your view. She\u2019s soaked to the skin but at least she\u2019s wearing her hood. \u201cGet in here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorning!\u201d she exclaims, running to hug you but you immediately take a half-step back on your good leg. She pouts and you arch an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wet and disgusting. Go dry up and I\u2019ll make breakfast, okay?\u201d She smiles toothily and you pull her hood off, pushing her into the home. Turning to the yard again, you groan internally when you see her dinosaur stuffy out there covered in mud. Since you got it for her last birthday, she\u2019d been attached to the hip with it. You\u2019re half-surprised to see her go in without it, but that means that it\u2019s now dirtier than a sack of shit with stains you\u2019re not sure you can hand wash out.</p><p>Who needs a quarter anyway?<br/><br/>You make a mental note to visit the laundromat after work and gather your resolve to get it. Going back in to stuff your feet into boots, you trudge outside, the cane squelching in the dirt. The rain thunders around you but none touch your hair or your skin, which you expected it to. Suddenly, the motive to nearly run from your porch to the dinosaur and back leaves because your leg feels like it\u2019s about to need an amputation. Taking your time, you reach down and take it, pinching it between your fingers and getting back to the porch.</p><p>Looking up miraculously, you frown at how the rain seems to hit an invisible barrier high above you, sliding off and around you like a glass cylinder.</p><p>In a split second, you know exactly who\u2019s doing this.</p><p>Getting back inside, you throw the dino into the sink and run it under a stream of water, getting what you can off with a quick rinse. Sitting it on the counter to dry, you hear the door knock.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it!\u201d your sister yells, thundering down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d You walk over, eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat\u2019d I say about answering doors when I\u2019m here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Pushing her behind you, you open the door to see him.</p><p>He\u2019s trying his best not to stare, which you appreciate, but you hate him seeing you like this.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here, Thor?\u201d you ask quietly, letting him in. His blond hair tied up in a bun, he\u2019s trying his best to look like a normal human.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to see if you are okay.\u201d Although his words are caring, you can\u2019t help the anger that rises up within you, at your situation, at this man who has shown up at your door time and time again. Those code words. Every single time - it\u2019s never just a visit.</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cWhy are you really here?\u201d you ask, voice colder. You\u2019re determined to push him away this time. You close the door and he sits down on the couch with a heavy sigh. Sensing that something\u2019s truly wrong, you tell your sister to go upstairs to finish washing up and walk around to sit beside him. When he turns around to see your sister\u2019s gone, he finally keens over and removes his hand from his abdomen, revealing a gross blood stain from a pulsating wound.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d You\u2019ve never seen it this bad. Darting up as fast as you can, you limp to the kitchen to grab scissors and bandages, a needle, towels and a cream from the last time. Sitting down, you push up his shirt as he lays back.</p><p>\u201cI went to the hospital. It stopped it for a while, but,\u201d he hisses as you snip the stitches that are trying to keep his skin together, \u201cit didn\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think I can help you? I told you I can\u2019t do this anymore. I\u2019m not that kind of doctor,\u201d you say but your actions betray your words. He takes a hold of your hands, blue eyes meeting yours earnestly. It pauses your work and you\u2019re forced to look at him. You swallow, the pain in your chest migrating to your throat and cinching it tight. Your jaw clenches and he cups your cheek, blood sticking.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d he whispers and you tear your eyes away to continue snipping away the stitches. It\u2019s a long cut, deep, and it\u2019s seven inches if you can hazard a guess, from his armpit and slicing diagonally down his side. \u201cI know I cannot ask you for anything-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did drop a building on me,\u201d you say and he grimaces. Placing the scissors down on the table, you soak up as much blood as you can, pressing hard against the cut despite Thor\u2019s groans.</p><p>\u201cAre we going to argue about Sokovia again?\u201d he whispers and you pull his hand away from your face and start squirting cream onto your hand to slather onto his wound. \u201cI told you that Ultron would\u2019ve-\u201d</p><p>\u201cReduced me to ash. I know. But Ultron already killed my parents,\u201d you say stiffly. \u201cThor, you gave me this house, among other things\u2014\u201d He blinks at how you avoid speaking of it, your time away\u2014 \u201cso I will always owe you a debt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said you\u2019re not that kind of doctor anymore,\u201d he says and you sigh, wiping your hands on another towel. Placing a fist against your other hand\u2019s palm, you draw out a long, thin, thread. It sparks, lighting up both of your faces as you continue drawing out until your arms can no longer stretch. Then you twist it around your wrist, staring at the ugly, oozing gash and estimating how much you\u2019d need.</p><p>\u201cIt helps when only one patient needs special care, not twenty,\u201d you murmur, guiding the Eldritch thread through the needle. \u201cStay still.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he whispers, eyes closing as his head drops back against the cushions. Your eyes trace over his face, and your heart aches for him. The debts have been repaid.</p><p>You know you only do this out of love.</p><p><b><i>&lsquo;Cause if I could see your face once more<br/>I could die a happy man, I&rsquo;m sure</i></b></p><p>\u201cYou need rest. Whatever did this to you can wait another day,\u201d you whisper as he eases into your bed. </p><p>\u201cHow did you leave?\u201d he asks and you smile bitterly.\u00a0\u201cDo they know where you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly the Ancient One knows I\u2019m here. Her, and S.H.I.E.L.D. It is extraordinary what <i>explaining</i>\u00a0can do to sway someone\u2019s opinion.\u201d His eyes close and you make sure his bandages are not too tight before pulling his shirt back over the wound. Brushing his hair back from his face, you sigh. \u201cThor, I can\u2019t keep taking you in like this. Especially with my sister here. She asks questions every time\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d His words fill the empty silence only interrupted by your sister\u2019s footsteps on the creaking wood, running up and down the halls. \u201cI have missed you. I just needed to see you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get to miss me.\u201d The hand in your grasp clenches down and you place your other hand atop of his. \u201cBecause, to everyone else, you were never here.\u201d Despite your light words, his now-opened eyes read you like a preschooler\u2019s picture book. \u201cAnd you never <i>are </i>here. You got me a house, and a job, and I\u2019m grateful, but I wish I could have the man I love, too. I mean, you show up as soon as you need me, never before. You leave the next morning. That\u2019s no way for me to hold on to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen move on. I would never hold it against you,\u201d he breathes and you want to slap him. You would\u2019ve if he weren\u2019t so injured.</p><p>Laughing, you let go of his hand and stand. \u201cYou\u2019re an idiot.\u201d Taking your cane, you walk to the door and open it to see your sister zoom past you. When she notices your door\u2019s open, she stops before you, a truck in hand.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s Thor here? Is he going to leave, again?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see. You can say hi, but don\u2019t be too rough. He\u2019s hurt,\u201d you say and your sister barges in, climbing onto your bed. You watch as Thor sits up, though he needs to rest, an easy smile on his face as your sister talks animatedly to him. Thor\u2019s eyes light up and you sigh. When your sister starts making vroom noises with her truck, engrossed in her whole imaginary world, begging Thor to be part of it, you feel bile crawl up your throat.</p><p>You once begged Thor to be part of your world, too.</p><p><b><i>When you said your last goodbye<br/></i></b><b><i>I died a little bit inside</i></b></p><p><i>As you check Thor\u2019s stitches, you know that he\u2019s fine. That he\u2019s well and healed. But his screams the night before echo in your head and you feel the urge to ask. You have lunch waiting but it can wait.</i></p><p><i>\u201cAre you\u2026 okay?\u201d you ask and his eyebrows raise in surprise. \u201cYou mutter about Infinity Stones in your sleep, and I was just wondering-\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI am fine, Nightingale.\u201d You bite your lip, dubious. \u201cI will stay another night, if you wish.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cI do wish, but the universe needs you, as always.\u201d Through your closed throat, you manage a smile as your eyes burn. \u201cWe\u2019ve had this conversation before, Thor.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI know. But perhaps you can come with me this time. I\u2026 I see fire in my dreams and I know where I must go.\u201d The feeling of flight in your chest has you nearly breathless but then you think of your sister, her wide eyes, who still believes in magic, who doesn&rsquo;t know her blood wields the very same magic she dreams of seeing. \u201cAre you needed at Kamar-Taj?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo.\u201d Not like you want to go back there. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 I go and leave the Parasite behind?\u201d you ask. She\u2019s at school. You\u2019ll need to pick her up in a few hours. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t do that. She hates our grandparents.\u201d Thor chuckles and the corner of your lip twitches up. \u201cYou can tell me, so I know you will be\u2026. Well, not safe, but I know where you will be. Even if I cannot be there.\u201d</i></p><p><i>His hands cup your face and the smell of cold electricity buzzes over his skin to yours, prickling at your cheek. \u201cThis will be the last time,\u201d he promises.</i></p><p><i>Your smile wavers. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the first time I have heard this.\u201d His hands fall away and you open the door. \u201cWell, you can go. You are my last patient before lunch.\u201d Limping away to the counter, you feel his hand fall away. Fiddling with popsicle sticks to make it seem like you\u2019re busy, you hear him shift on the exam table. Thor hops off the table and your hand stills.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou understand that it is my duty.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI understand well enough.\u201d Your voice is frigid and causes him to pause. \u201cBut every time you leave, I will never know if you will return.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNightingale, I-\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThor, just stay. Because I can\u2019t keep loving you like this.\u201d A weight drops in your gut as his blue eyes widen. You turn to him, hand on the knob. \u201cI am asking you to stay. And you know I am stubborn and that I do not bend easily, but I will for you. If you will </i>stay <i>for me</i>.\u201d\u00a0<i>Opening the door, you wait. He walks over to you, jaw set. He licks his lips and you know he wants to kiss you, but you turn your face away. You cannot love a man like this. \u201cPlease stay. Just stay.\u201d There is silence and you know his answer.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI love you,\u201d he says. His hand cups your cheek, wiping away the tears you refused to acknowledge.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI know,\u201d you say as your hand covers his, \u201cbut that is not enough.\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>I lay in tears in bed all night<br/></i></b><b><i>Alone without you by my side</i></b></p><p>Lying down on the couch, you stare up at the ceiling. Upstairs, Thor rests and you glance at the analog clock you had plugged in earlier that night. You have twenty-three minutes before you have to get up and check his wound. For some reason, it still bleeds and the stitching loosens, meaning you have to cut the old thread and suture his skin back together again.</p><p>Your mind searches for the cause. Books litter the coffee table with mythological tomes on different creatures and spells, but you know they\u2019re all useless. Groaning, you sit up and prepare yourself for the long trek up the stairs.</p><p>Your lungs are hollow and you wonder if this cracking abyss will widen or close when he leaves. It\u2019s always hard to tell when he\u2019s near. The tears come before you realize. They flow down the corners of your eyes, nestling near your ears and you don\u2019t bother to wipe them away. There\u2019s no more fight left. </p><p>When you check the clock again, you know it\u2019s time for you to get up. Get up, get your shit together, get up those stairs.</p><p>So you do. And, although your eyes glance over the Sling Ring resting near your cane, you know it\u2019s best to limit how much magic you use. Your sister can never know what you can do. Your sister will want you to be a superhero. You don\u2019t know if you have the strength to try. Besides, your sister will lose the life she has now. She\u2019d have to live with her grandparents.</p><p>\u2018She doesn\u2019t want that,\u2019 you tell yourself as your cane stomps against the creaking wound. It pushes you up to the top and you make your way to your room. Opening the door, you perch on the end of the bed. Moonlight is streaming in through the curtains and you watch the rain fall, dashing against your windows.</p><p>\u201cNightingale?\u201d a hoarse voice calls and you turn your attention to the waking man. \u201cIs it time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Gently pulling up his shirt, you unwrap the bandages until you see the wound. It\u2019s healing better, clotting well. Grabbing a pair of gloves, you slap them on and touch the area around it, making sure it\u2019s holding together. \u201cYou\u2019re healing better. That\u2019s good. It\u2019s good.\u201d Your voice dies as he tries to sit up. \u201cNo, don\u2019t. You need to stay still. It just started getting better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you use whatever sorcery you use for this to heal your leg?\u201d He\u2019s asked this question before. You don\u2019t have the heart to give him the answer.</p><p><b><i>But if you loved me, why&rsquo;d you leave me?<br/>Take my body, take my body</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cCan you tell us your name?\u201d they ask in English and you blink against the bright lights. They\u2019re testing your pupil response, to see if you have any brain damage. So you\u2019re in a hospital. That\u2019s good.</i></p><p><i>\u201c(Y/N) (L/N). I\u2019m a doctor,\u201d you rasp. Your English is rusty and your voice is hoarse, which doesn\u2019t make for a flattering sound, \u201cand if I am not mistaken, this is\u2026 not Novi Grad\u2019s General Hospital.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re right. What year is it?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201c2015.\u201d You try to sit up and a nurse helps with pillows underneath your back as you continue to blink. A straw is poked at your lips and you sip in water that runs down your throat silkily. \u201cWhere am I?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat\u2019s the last thing you remember?\u201d</i></p><p><i>You\u2019re paralyzed. You are as you stare up, watching your world crumble around you. Shielding your sister beneath your body, you sob into her hair, watching as slabs of your home crush your parents bodies to dust. The snap of their bones echoes in your ears like a sick symphony. Curling into a ball, you hold your sister\u2019s head to you, knowing you can\u2019t move. </i></p><p><i>\u201cCome on!\u201d The voice is rough, accented, and when you look up, you see a man in a red cape and long blond hair. His blue eyes anchor you to the fact that part of your home city is floating in mid air because of some crazy robot.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cI can\u2019t!\u201d you scream and he glances around with a grimace before running in. \u201cTake my sister. Please. Make sure she is safe,\u201d you whisper to whomever is listening. Your sister screams when the floor trembles under his footsteps and you wonder if you\u2019ll fall through the three floors beneath you of the apartment building you live in. Still, he sees your sister\u2019s bright red shirt and scoops her up first. You thank the ones listening that the Avenger has taken her first just as the ceiling roared in protest. A slab of concrete is just about to fall on you but he swings his hammer, demolishing it. The debris scatters around you, flying into the cracks on the floor. The wood moans, weakening at the edges.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHold on to me,\u201d he mutters in your ear just as the world falls out beneath your feet. Screaming, you swipe blindly in front of you to grab his arm but your fingers barely snag. </i></p><p><i>There will never be such a feeling as free-falling through three stories, watching the dust and metal and glass and wood all fall beside you and you realize that you are them as much as they are you. They were the building blocks that made your apartment a home, just as you are. Just as you were.</i></p><p><i>The ground comes too fast and the only thing you hear is the sound of your bones breaking like a cacophony of snares. </i></p><p><i>The darkness that hits you is faster than any flood.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI fell,\u201d you say in the present. \u201cDuring Novi Grad, I fell from my apartment building. Three stories.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou had a subdural hematoma. You were extracted immediately and brought here where you were operated on.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cJust one operation?\u201d you ask and now you realize why your head feels stomped in.</i></p><p><i>\u201cA craniotomy for your subdural hematoma, and you insisted on keeping your leg so the orthopedic surgeon placed fixators and more titanium than any other patient in this hospital in your leg to keep it straight from foot to femur. The shock had travelled up your leg. Oblique foot fractures, open tibial and fibula fractures, and a comminuted femur fracture.\u201d Your eyes drift to where you leg is encased in a metal cage to prevent movement. It\u2019s wrapped in a cast, completely immovable.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI see,\u201d you manage to say. You\u2019re well aware of the beeping of your monitors. A nurse goes to your leads, a needle poised but the doctor holds up a hand. Taking a deep breath, you nod. \u201cKeep going.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou needed a partial splenectomy and one of your kidneys was removed. Besides that, you\u2019re very lucky to have survived.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAnd my sister?\u201d The doctor pauses, lips pressing together. \u201cIs she okay? One of them took her. The blond one, red cape, has a hammer-\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cShe\u2019s been waiting for you to wake up with the Avenger for over three days now,\u201d the doctor says and you blink. \u201cI don\u2019t recommend seeing her, but if you are up for it-\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI am.\u201d Nodding, the doctor turns to the nurse who goes to the door. \u201cDoctor?\u201d the surgeon turns to you once more and you look at your leg blankly. \u201cI will not be able to walk properly again, will I?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo. Not unless you amputate.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo. It is - I need my leg. I want to keep it,\u201d you say and the doctor hums. \u201cI have been told I\u2019m stubborn.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou are. Even when you\u2019re delirious.\u201d The doctor writes something down in your chart before going to your I.V. and checking the levels. </i></p><p><i>\u201cYou could have overridden my decision, declared me unfit to make medical decisions. Why did you listen to me?\u201d Your eyes drift slowly over to the doctor who smiles. </i></p><p><i>\u201cThe choice to make is always yours,\u201d he says and when your sister and the Avenger enters the room, the doctor turns to leave. You swear you can hear the slight creak in his leg as he walks away.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re okay!\u201d your sister cries in your mother tongue, climbing onto your bed and snuggling into your side. The Avenger has a soft expression written into his mouth and eyes. \u201cMommy and Daddy aren\u2019t here yet. I don\u2019t know if they know we\u2019re here.\u201d Your heart skids to a stop and you try to redirect the flow of conversation before you burst into tears. You feel them catch in your throat, bruising and tight as you struggle to speak.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhere is here? Exactly?\u201d you ask to the Avenger.</i></p><p><i>\u201cNew York Presbyterian Hospital,\u201d the Avenger says and your eyes lock onto his. \u201cI am Thor Odinson.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You are wary of the him, his tall stature, but he exudes easiness so you relax against the pillows, holding your sister to you. There\u2019s a long scratch on your sister\u2019s arm that\u2019s stitched up well. You hadn\u2019t noticed it before. \u201cI know that.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAnd once you\u2019re out of the hospital, I had Tony Stark grant you a new home and job waiting for you as soon as you\u2019re able.\u201d Your mouth drops open and he smiles half-heartedly. \u201cIt\u2019s the least I could do. I did drop a building on you.\u201d You smile, exhaling softly as your sister buries her face to your side. </i></p><p><i>\u201cDid you do this for every Sokovian you nearly killed or am I special?\u201d you ask.</i></p><p><i>\u201cA nightingale is always special,\u201d is his answer. \u201cI heard you were a doctor.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI am a doctor,\u201d you respond stiffly and he sits on the edge of your bed, far away as if he is not sure you want him close. He saved your sister and she\u2019s the only family you have left. That\u2019s enough for you. \u201cWhy did that robot try to lift Sokovia out of the sky?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Thor shifts in his seat and you frown.</i></p><p><i>\u201cBecause he wanted peace in our time.\u201d You nod and Thor sighs. \u201cHe wanted peace by killing everyone.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOh. That sounds stupid,\u201d you say and Thor chuckles. It\u2019s a curious sound, one that warms your chest. \u201cThank you, for saving my sister.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIf you need anything, I\u2019m a call away.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI am in your debt,\u201d you point out but he shakes his head, standing up.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt was your home that I destroyed. Let me make it up to you.\u201d You smile as he leaves. The next morning, there is a postcard with a picture of a brown bird with a white belly - a nightingale. Your sister reads it out to you, and by the end of it all, the sobs that want to macerate your heart as you think of your dead parents come.</i></p><p><i>Attached to the back of the postcard are two wedding rings, taped securely to the white cardstock. You imagine Thor digging through the casualties, trying to find the two he only had a glance of. </i></p><p><i>You tell your sister then that you are orphans. She slips your mother\u2019s finger onto her thumb and your father\u2019s finger onto yours.</i></p><p><i>You know you owe the Avenger more than you can ever say.</i></p><p><b><i>All I want is, and all I need is<br/></i></b><b><i>To find somebody, I&rsquo;ll find somebody</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cSo, you ended your relationship with Dr. Foster?\u201d you ask and Thor nods. \u201cWhy?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cBecause she needed to concentrate on work and it didn\u2019t seem to work anymore.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cBut you love her. That doesn\u2019t make sense. You can make it work.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cJane was tired of my disappearances. She wished to move on and she no longer wanted to make it work, and I suppose I saw it coming. There is a certain way she acted around me, as if she were guilty. In the end, I\u2026 I let her go.\u201d He picks at his fruit cup he had taken from your tray of food and you grimace. \u201cThis is disgusting. How dare they serve this to healing patients?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYeah, I would not eat it if I were dying.\u201d Smiling, though it appears worn at the edges, he sets down the cup and extends a hand. Taking it, you sit up and he helps with your pillows. Your leg cramps and you suck in a breath.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIs it your leg?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYes.\u201d His hand rests in yours still and you look down at it. He draws his hand away. \u201cThank you for taking my sister to school. I know you have other things to do.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI think I\u2019ve found a lead on one of the Infinity Stones. It\u2019s the least I could do as a farewell before I go for who knows how long.\u201d You nod and he offers a slight smile.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhich one do you think it is?\u201d Ever since Thor had taken to visiting you, you\u2019ve been lending an ear to his dreams and adventures. You barely think it\u2019s crazy when a robot almost leveled\u00a0a city by lifting up a piece of the earth into the sky.</i></p><p><i>\u201cPerhaps the Time Stone. And it\u2019s on Earth. Do you want to come?\u201d You frown at his offer and the smile fades. \u201cYour sister can come, too. I assure you, it\u2019s all paid for.\u201d You look out the window and sigh, looking at the Avengers Tower.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI need to get out of here,\u201d you breathe and the smile that splits his face is the sun in all its glory. \u201cWhen can we go?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAs soon as you\u2019re released from the hospital,\u201d he promises and you feel the smile tugging at your stubborn lips until you beam at the blond before you. \u201cI\u2019ll take you to somewhere called Kamar-Taj. That\u2019s where I think it is.\u201d Nodding, you wet your lips, unable to contain your smile.</i></p><p><i>\u201cOkay.\u201d You fiddle with the ring around your thumb before piping up again, \u201cThor?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYes?\u201d He\u2019s moved on to the cookie which is, unanimously, better than the fruit cup. When he sees you looking, he sets it down. \u201cSorry, do you want the cookie?\u201d You simply smile and extend a hand for him to take. He does, thumb running over your knuckles.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI am sorry, about Jane.\u201d His smile is the the sun on a cloudy day. \u201cI wish it were different.\u201d</i></p><p><i>He nods, turning to your cookie before chancing a glance at you. You give him a nod and he takes it, unwrapping it from its plastic and ripping off a piece to pop into his mouth. \u201cThank you, Nightingale.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d you say.</i></p><p><b><i>Like you, oh, oh, oh</i></b></p><p><i>The knocking makes you start awake and you feel your back cramping the fuck up. Pushing yourself up, you groan when Thor shifts, murmuring to himself under his breath. Sighing, you spare him a glance before getting up and looking at the clock. Only forty-seven minutes of sleep. Fantastic. When the God of Thunder himself shows up on your doorstep bleeding and needing a place to crash, it always means sleepless nights for you.</i></p><p><i>Taking your cane, you walk down the stairs and wipe at the dried spit near your mouth. Might as well look less-monstrous while you still can.</i></p><p><i>Once you reach the bottom, you open the door.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat?\u201d you snap before the scowl drops off your face. \u201cOh, shit.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWe had a consult this morning. You overslept.\u201d Groaning, you let Stephen in as you wipe at your eyes. \u201cWhere\u2019s the kid?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cStill sleeping, probably. She had a late night. So did I and wait - Stephen, how did you even find where I live?\u201d The surgeon sat down on her couch, spreading out C.T. and M.R.I scans. Knowing you have no way of making him leave, you sigh. \u201cWhat was the consult again?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cPatient came in two days ago at 11:29 PM.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cRight. Uh, let me see.\u201d Sitting down beside him, you take out the echo. \u201cCan you go over the patient history again?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThirty-four year old female. Presented with exertional chest pain. She came into the E.R. after she fell and had a seizure. Brain tumour. Her family has a family history of coronary artery disease.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cLife style?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cActive, stressful.\u201d You inspect the echocardiogram, eyes straining. You need some coffee. \u201cCardio said it showed normal sinus rhythm with no ST, or T changes.\u201d Nodding, you switch to the C.T.s and M.R.I.s. You whistle at the size of the tumour. </i></p><p><i>\u201cYou are going to operate on the tumour?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cObviously.\u201d Rolling your eyes, you take out the labs. \u201cThe only thing I can\u2019t figure out is the chest pain.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cSo you\u2019ve come to me for help,\u201d you remark. \u201cPass me the labs.\u201d The scans are exchanged for the sheets of paper and you read down the list. \u201cComplete blood picture, comprehensive metabolic panel, three sets of cardiac enzymes. All normal.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cDo you see why I\u2019ve come here now? She needs a cure. Now.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cRun a sixty-four cardiac computed tomography angiography.\u201d Setting down the labs back onto the folder, you turn to your colleague. \u201cIt could be anomalous coronaries. So, get a high volume study to rule it out. Call me for the results. You know, it could be an AVM.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cGreat.\u201d Stephen stood up and from his bag, took out a travelling mug you had left at the hospital a few months before. You\u2019d never gather the courage to take it since Stephen had taken to choosing spots for consults. \u201cYou never took it back.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThanks,\u201d you mutter dryly, delighted to find it filled. \u201cIs this coffee?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m not a completely terrible person.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAh, but you are to Dr. Palmer,\u201d you say, taking your cane and pushing yourself up. \u201cDon\u2019t you have patients to see to, Dr. Strange?\u201d Stephen was about to respond when there was a clutter. Your thoughts instantly zeroed in on something happened to Thor and you leave your mug on the table to limp as quick as you can to the staircase. Climbing the stairs, you\u2019re well aware of Stephen following after you as you open the door to your room.</i></p><p><i>On the floor, is Thor.</i></p><p><i>Releasing a sigh of relief, you get in and help him sit up to lean against the bed. Crouching, you lift his shirt and check to see if his wound has reopened.</i></p><p><i>\u201cSorry,\u201d Thor whispers and you offer a strained smile. Stephen crouches down as well, frowning. He inspects Thor\u2019s pupil response\u00a0with a torch he keeps in his pocket and touches the head, testing for any shifts in the bones.</i></p><p><i>\u201cDidn\u2019t know your house was a clinic. You might want to keep it more sanitary, if it is,\u201d he commented as he worked. Checking on the wound on the other side of Thor, you send your colleague a glare.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d you retort as the two of you help Thor back into bed. \u201cAre you okay? Did you hit your head?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo, I\u2019m okay.\u201d Thor\u2019s eyes dart between Stephen and you. \u201cWho is he?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cA colleague. It\u2019s fine. Come on, back to sleep,\u201d you say. Thor sends a reluctant glance at you but you ignore it, pulling the covers up. \u201cI\u2019ll check in on you in a bit, alright?\u201d The blond sets his jaw and glances at the shelves that line your walls. \u201cFine. Read a book. Just, rest, okay?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cFine. If you need me-\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo, if </i>you <i>need </i>me<i>, you call. Or get my sister. Scream if you have to.\u201d Stephen helps you back to your feet, handing you your cane and you sigh, closing the door behind you two.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHe\u2019s your boyfriend?\u201d the neurosurgeon asks and you shoot him a glare. \u201cI\u2019m just saying what I\u2019m reading.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHe\u2019s a patient,\u201d you say and Stephen smirks, not saying a thing. He gathers his files and you are this close to kicking him out the door to get his cocky smile out of your face when he walks out. Groaning to yourself, you climb back up the stairs and slip into your room. Thor\u2019s reading something on the history of medicine and you smile. That was the first book you had him read when you first met him.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIs he your boyfriend?\u201d he asks without looking up and you look to the sky, wondering why you had to be in this kind of parallel universe. Maybe it\u2019s \u2018cause some God thinks it\u2019s funny. If you have to choose, you\u2019d think it\u2019d be Loki, who Thor had told you many fond stories of.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHe\u2019s a colleague,\u201d you say and Thor narrows his eyes. You let your cane drop against the floor as you sit down on the bed with a huff. \u201cHe\u2019s a friend,\u201d you admit. \u201cHe\u2019s a surgeon and came for a consult. I missed it this morning.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI see.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThor-\u201d</i></p><p><i><br/>\u201cIf he makes you happy, then I have no qualms about it.\u201d Rolling your eyes, you bite your tongue and brush hair away from his face.</i></p><p><i>\u201cGet some rest. I can convince you when you are not in danger of bleeding to death.\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>Like you, like you</i></b></p><p>\u201cThank you, Stan,\u201d you say to the mailman. He smiles at you and does a two-finger salute before heading back down to the sidewalk. Closing the door, you sort through the mail and toss the junk into the trash before heading up. You\u2019ll read them before bed tonight. Walking into your room after a knock on the open door, you see Thor staring out the window. He must\u2019ve heard your conversation with Stan.</p><p>\u201cStan, hm?\u201d he says without tearing his eyes away from the window. Again with this crap. Tossing the letters you need onto a table, you sit on the edge of the bed.</p><p>\u201cThor. Brush your teeth and stop pouting.\u201d He gazes at you, shocked, and you arch an eyebrow. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t going to sleep, then clean yourself up.\u201d Pushing off the covers, he scoots to the other side of the bed and gets up slowly. Following after him, you sigh. He\u2019s leaning over the sink and you lean against the door frame, crossing your arms. Since he\u2019s got a toothbrush in his mouth, you take it as an opportunity to speak.</p><p>\u201cThe reason I do not use magic to heal my leg is because it is one of the only reminders I have of you, of what we have and of my parents and of this chapter in my life.\u201d The toothbrush pauses for a moment, and then continues. \u201cMy leg\u2026 is my penance for all the things I didn\u2019t do. And now I cherish my sister far more than I did before, I love my job and I am grateful to save lives when I couldn\u2019t save my parents. I love you far more than I would\u2019ve without this. And without it, I wouldn\u2019t have loved you at all.\u201d</p><p>He rinses out his mouth and you smile.</p><p>\u201cWhen you are gone and I miss you, and it rains far harder than it should, I think of you. My leg cramps and it hurts far more than it should, and I still think of you. Any other day, I am fine. It\u2019s just those rainy days. I look at my cane, and I think of how lucky I am to experience the kind of love you have brought me, and how cursed I must be to see you leave every time.\u201d</p><p>He stares ahead to the mirror and you take in his side profile. His hair\u2019s tied up in a bun, courtesy of you, but a few tendrils still frame his face. \u201cWhen I see birds, I think of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I can live without you, right?\u201d you say and he turns to pin you with those freezing cold eyes. Eyes that remind you of a summer day and a thunderstorm. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to. That is why I ask you to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he says, letting the toothbrush clatter in the glass cup. \u201cBut you know it\u2019s not healthy\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. That does not stop me from wanting you.\u201d You turn to leave. \u201cLunch will be ready in an hour.\u201d </p><p><b><i>So you brought out the best of me<br/></i></b><b><i>A part of me I&rsquo;d never seen</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cI asked Stark to pay for your rent and S.H.I.E.L.D. has agents monitoring your sister at all times,\u201d Thor tells you for the thirtieth time as the two of you migrate through the busy street.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThor, do you even know where we\u2019re going?\u201d you ask, stumbling after him. You\u2019ll never get used to this cane, but you can at least admire it\u2019s wood finishing and gold embellishments. Just another thing you have to thank Thor for.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI have a rough estimate,\u201d he says and you laugh as he holds onto your hand, making sure he doesn\u2019t lose you. You\u2019ve never been outside your home country and all this, the new sights and sounds and languages, has your eyes constantly open, trying to soak it all in. \u201cCome on, down this alley.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWait, I need to breathe,\u201d you wheeze and he pulls you in before you\u2019re run over by a bike. Chest to chest, the two of you laugh until your lungs ache, foreheads pressed against each other. Eyes closing, you let your head drop until it rests against his chest. \u201cI\u2019ve never been out of my country before. This is all very new,\u201d you say and he smiles, cupping your face. \u201cI am glad I got to experience it with you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAnd I you, Nightingale.\u201d The smile hurts but it\u2019s all worth it as you take in a deep breath. All the delicious stalls full of fresh food and spices has your head light as Thor takes a step back. \u201cCome on. We need to be there before nightfall.\u201d Nodding, you walk after him, through the crowd. You can\u2019t recall the last time you\u2019ve felt so energized, so daring and high on adrenaline. Exhilaration pumping in your veins, you wish you could run so you could fully experience what is Kathmandu.</i></p><p><b><i>You took my soul and wiped it clean</i></b></p><p><i>Once you get there, you\u2019re introduced to a woman. She pours you tea while others rid them of your cloaks. The cup is warm in your hands, strangely seeping into your blood and spreading throughout your body.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>The Ancient One, they call her. The others, a dark-skinned man named Mordo, and another with long hair and only one hand named Hamir stand by but only Hamir is dismissed. The smell of incense is heady and the light filters dustily into the room. Sipping, you\u2019re delighted at the sweet tea that\u2019s mellow yet fragrant.</i><br/></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re here for the Stone, are you not?\u201d she asks and you look to Thor. His lips press together as he nods. \u201cBut you are not.\u201d The Ancient One\u2019s eyes land on yours and you nearly drop your porcelain cup. \u201cDo you need more honey with your tea?\u201d Glancing down at the golden liquid, you shake your head. </i></p><p><i>\u201cI am only here to make sure it is kept safe. There is a danger looming ahead, and they will seek the Stone.\u201d The Ancient One smiles serenely, looking to Mordo. \u201cIs it true you keep the Time Stone here?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cMordo, take the Avenger to the Eye of Agamotto.\u201d The man nods, gesturing for the blond to follow. When you go too, you are stopped. \u201cI must speak to you.\u201d Thor is reluctant to leave you but you give him a nod, saying it\u2019s okay as you turn to the Ancient One.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d you ask warily, taking a step back when she holds the kettle to you.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s only tea.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI do not need tea. How did you know I did not come for the Stone?\u201d you ask and the woman smiles that smile again. It mystifies you.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI know you came here for him. But I also know you search for purpose, Doctor.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWe are the Masters of The Mystic Arts.\u201d You arch an eyebrow.</i></p><p><i>\u201cLike magic?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cLike a science,\u201d she corrects, setting the kettle down. \u201cSit.\u201d You slump down on the floor, crossing a leg underneath your injured one. She sits in front of you, cross-legged. \u201cI know you wish to heal those you cannot. You wish you could have saved your parents.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI do.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou are not very ambitious, are you?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAmbition causes mistakes,\u201d you say. \u201cI became a doctor to help those who needed it.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat if I told you there was a way?\u201d As she speaks, orange light carves the air into geometric shapes. Your eyes fixate on the glowing, orange sparks emitted from lines that seem to burn into the air and you reach out a hand to touch.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThen I\u2019d say teach me,\u201d you manage to whisper before the air is stolen from your lungs. Seeing is believing but your mind cannot come up with a scientific explanation of this. \u201cWhat is this? Can you teach me?\u201d The Ancient One smiles.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIf you are willing to listen.\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>Our love was made for movie screens</i></b></p><p><i>Thor tries to visit you every day.</i></p><p><i>Some days he looks tired, other days not so. You go home every day to your sister who goes to school a week later.</i></p><p><i>Your life seems to have purpose for the first time in a long while and you show him your Sling Ring and how you can imagine the top of Cairns rock at sunrise. It\u2019s one of your favourite places to be, now that you can travel almost anywhere in the world.</i></p><p><i>As the orange sparks flitter down to the ground, tracing a circle, you smile at him. \u201cCome with me.\u201d With that, the portal opens to reveal the flat of the red-brown rock and you step through. He follows after you, watching the sun bleed into the sky. Purple and orange tangle together as the golden rays of the sun shadow the clouds. The stars are retreating with the inky night and you sit down with a exhausated smile.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt is beautiful here. I thought I would never love a sunrise more than I did in Sokovia, but here, everything is so clear.\u201d Turning to Thor who still stands, you pat the spot beside you and he sits down as well. \u201cThank you, for bringing me to Kamar-Taj.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt was my pleasure, Nightingale,\u201d he says and you smile. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I have been absent as of late.\u201d You shrug. You\u2019ve been busy too, being a student again. It\u2019s refreshing to learn more than you ever thought possible. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cAnd I you,\u201d you whisper. \u201cThe Parasite has something she wants to give you, when you get the chance to visit her.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI wanted to see you first.\u201d Touched, you lean against him. The energy leeched from your bones, you barely keep your eyes open for the sunrise. His lips press against your hair and you sink farther against him until you lay against him like a sack of flour. The sunrise bathes both of you in gold and you look up at him. His eyes glow tenderly and he leans down to press his lips against yours. Eyes widening, you don\u2019t move for a split second and then you realize, that this is truly happening.</i></p><p><i>With all that\u2019s going on, you find it hilarious that this is the thing that surprises you the most. So you let yourself go with the flow. You throw an arm around his neck, holding him against you. Eyes closed, you savour in his smell of sweat and cold electricity and the ecstasy of his plush mouth until you must breathe for air. Curling up against him, you smile against his lips as he pecks the corner of your mouth.</i></p><p><i>\u201cTo tide you over until I see you next,\u201d he murmurs and you hug him close. You don\u2019t want to let him go. \u201cI promise to be back as soon as I am able, Nightingale.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cSee to it that it\u2019s sooner rather than later,\u201d you whisper. Drawing back, he smiles and kisses you chastely on the lips.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI promise.\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>But if you loved me, why&rsquo;d you leave me?<br/></i></b><b><i>Take my body, take my body</i></b></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time for you to go to school. Say bye to Thor,\u201d you tell your sister who waves to the man. \u201cHe will not be here when you\u2019re back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye, Thor!\u201d Your sister runs to him, hugging onto his legs and you cross your arms, feeling the hollowness of his absence already creeping in. \u201cI\u2019ll miss you! And (Y/N) gets sad without you.\u201d Thor\u2019s eyes lift up to meet yours and you shrug. Stepping forward, you hear the bus outside honk.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Parasite. You\u2019ve gotta go to school.\u201d Crouching down, you adjust your sister\u2019s coat and force a smile. \u201cBe good for me, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She hugs your neck and you pat her back before pulling her away. \u201cBye, Thor.\u201d Your sister looks like she\u2019s about to cry and honestly, you feel the same ever since Thor told you where he\u2019ll be going next. The two of you watch her leave before turning to each other. He closes the door and immediately your lips crash against each other. The steps you take back have you pinned against the wall as his hands cradle your face. The cane clatters to the floor as you gasp against his mouth. Your arms loop around his neck, eyes closing as he kisses you like you are the oxygen he needs. Lightning surges through your veins, your hair on end as the electricity dances over your skin.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d His breath fans over your cheek as your noses brush. \u201cAnd I promise I will try to be safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo promises you can\u2019t keep,\u201d you whisper and he kisses your lips softly, slowly. Pulling away, you continue against his persistent mouth that searches for kisses you are willing to give, \u201cI won\u2019t be there to help you, and I need to know you will be safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re not angry?\u201d murmurs the God, pulling back a fraction of an inch.</p><p>\u201cI will always be angry that you leave. And I will <i>always </i>be angry that you come back when I think I have gotten over you, but I will always love you.\u201d He smiles, bittersweet, and your hand curls against the back of his neck, bringing him back down. \u201cFor now, stay until you must leave.\u201d </p><p>He kisses you as if you are the water he needs in the desert, the fire he needs in the winter, and he kisses you as if you are the sweetest wine he will ever taste.</p><p><b><i>All I want is, and all I need is<br/></i></b><b><i>To find somebody, I&rsquo;ll find somebody</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cWhat do you mean he\u2019s gone?\u201d you ask the Ancient One from where you are meditating. \u201cHe always comes back. Of course he\u2019s gone. Then, he comes back.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHe wished for me to tell you that he can no longer stay away from his duties, even if it means he must sacrifice you.\u201d Your leg seizes and you lean forward, fingers digging into the wood beneath you. The taste of bile, bitter and acidic floods your tongue and push yourself up onto your knees. The Ancient One stands before you with that serene expression of hers. \u201cHe has responsibilities that are more important than a single being.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI know,\u201d you say and you hate that you understand. \u201cBut so do I.\u201d The Ancient One frowns at your flat voice. Your decision may be hasty but it is made. And you are stubborn as they come. \u201cI am a doctor, and although I have not mastered all there is to learn, I cannot stay here while innocent people are dying.\u201d </i>\u2018He just left without even telling me,\u2019<i> is what you really want to say. Your heart wilts in your chest and you swallow the knot in your throat.</i></p><p><i>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Rising to your feet, you turn around so your mentor does not see you cry.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI realize now that the only thing keeping me here was him. He brought me here, and this was where he could find me. If he thinks so little of me that he doesn\u2019t even give me a proper goodbye, neither will I.\u201d The Ancient One sighs and you whirl around. \u201cYou think that this is the wrong thing to do?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI think nothing of it. I assure you. But if you truly want to forget him, perhaps you should use what you have learned.\u201d Her eyes divert to your leg and you shake your head. Pulling off your Sling Ring, you try to hand it to the Ancient One but she merely shakes her head. \u201cNo. In case you need it.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIs that allowed?\u201d The Ancient One merely smiles and turns away, leaving you to your thoughts. And the more you think, the more you wish your mind would quiet for it is a thunderstorm within your head.</i></p><p><i>Mordo is the one who sends you off with a hug and a wish good luck. \u201cYou use your skills for good,\u201d he warns and you smile.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI will. I am a doctor, after all.\u201d Smiling, you take your cane and limp down the alley to the building where your sister is. You tell the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent outside your door that you need a flight back to New York City and prepare yourself to tell your sister that you\u2019re moving yet again, and that Thor is gone.</i></p><p><i>When Tony Stark arrives in a jet to come pick you up personally, he shrugs and says, \u201cThor was fond of you. Fond enough to have you on S.H.I.E.L.D surveillance and make sure you\u2019ve got a trust fund for both you and your sister.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You blink. You never knew that. Tony Stark then adds, \u201cWell, not the trust fund. He just said make sure you\u2019re financially stable so you don\u2019t die homeless. The trust fund was all me. And I got you a job. You\u2019ll work at a clinic that\u2019s in close association with Metro-General hospital.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThank you, Mr. Stark.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cMake it Tony.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Nodding to yourself, you board the jet and sit beside Mr. Stark who talks the whole way.

Travel to Muspelheim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he whispers against your neck and you squirm. \u201cThe doctor would be good for you. He seems smart, a bit arrogant but you like the arrogant type.\u201d You turn to glare at him before realizing what he\u2019s doing. He\u2019s trying to make his departure easier on your soul, as he\u2019s always attempted to do.</p><p>\u201cYou know telling me to move on won\u2019t help it hurt less,\u201d you tell him, kissing his swollen mouth. He sighs, carding his fingers through your hair. \u201cBesides, I haven\u2019t heard from him since his car crash. He was in an accident and has gone missing ever since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s terrible. How about the mailman?\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>So</i>, this Muspelheim\u2026\u201d He frowns at your diversion but allows it all the same. \u201cThat is the realm of fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the fire in my dreams that have shown me an image of Surtur. I see my home, purged by fire and I have realized that perhaps Ragnar\u00f6k is coming sooner than expected.\u201d Your legs tangle in his, skin against skin as your fingers trace the veins along his arms.</p><p>\u201cI have a sense of what that is like, to see your home crumble,\u201d you murmur and he holds you to his chest. You are a comma to his body, curling against him as your words ghost against his collarbones. \u201cIf it is your home you see destroyed, then you really must go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only wish I could take you with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could go.\u201d His arms tighten around you and you feel your heart in your throat as your hand flattens against his back and your index finger traces circles against his skin. \u201cBut you need to go alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will in five minutes.\u201d His eyes close. You tilt your head up at him, the warmth within you ebbing and flowing from your chest to your fingertips like a warm fire within you. \u201cLet me have five more minutes with you.\u201d You close your eyes as he hugs you tight, knowing that when you wake up, he will be gone.</p><p><i><b>But if you loved me, why&rsquo;d you leave me?<br/></b></i><i><b>Take my body, take my body</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s not closing!\u201d you whisper as Thor uses his hands to hold his flesh together. \u201cWhat caused this?

I went to the hospital and they gave me their strongest suture. It will not hold.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThen what can I do?\u201d you ask and your eyes meet his. He is focused, assured, and you shake your head. \u201cNo. You cannot just show up in New York and expect me to help you after you left without a note! I swore off magic when my sister nearly found me out.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNightingale-\u201d</i></p><p><i><br/>\u201cI am terrified!

This is my first time doing this.\u201d With one last glower, you dig the needle through his flesh, sewing it back together. The glowing orange weaves in and out of his skin like some piercing, the sparks sizzling and he groans through clenched teeth. You take deep breaths, trying to keep your hand steady as he keens over, panting.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHow did you even find me?\u201d you whisper, trying to distract him. His eyes flash up to yours and you smile.</i></p><p><i>\u201cStark.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOf course.\u201d Ever since your return, he\u2019s been funding your clinic.

Sitting on your couch and watching the TV, you groan and close your eyes. All you wanted to do was get home from work and relax by watching the TV, maybe catch up on some reading. Instead, you\u2019re reminded that he\u2019s gone.</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, shut up!\u201d Your sister quietens from where she\u2019s doing her homework in the kitchen. \u201cIf you keep crying, I will cry. Do you want me to cry?\u201d <br/></p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d she says and you open your eyes again. Already they\u2019re burning and you blink to clear your vision. \u201cI miss Thor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss him, too, Parasite.\u201d You sigh. Of course you have to be an asshole to your little sister. \u201cSorry I yelled at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>Watching the TV again, you frown when breaking news cuts off whatever it was covering on Spider-Man. </p><p>The breaking news? Tony Stark has gone missing.</p><p>As footage plays of the man along with three others walking towards what appears to be aliens, you feel your gut flip. Grabbing the remote, you turn up the volume. </p><p><i>\u201cThe billionaire was last seen leaving the Earth\u2019s atmosphere in pursuit of the ship. It is unknown if he is still alive. Evacuations for anyone South of 43rd Street were ordered by Iron Man himself before he faced off against the two alien invaders.\u201d</i></p><p>You think you\u2019re going to be sick. </p><p>This is most definitely an Avengers kind of situation and if you know Thor, which you do, he\u2019ll be right in the thick of it. Grabbing your cane, you get up and walk to your sister. She can\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cHey, Parasite. Wanna have ice-cream for dinner?\u201d you ask, opening the freezer. Glancing over your shoulder, you see her nod dully and you sigh, stopping by her side. \u201cYou know what? Let\u2019s just skip school tomorrow. We can miss Thor together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Grateful that you can at least get a smile out of her, you turn back to the freezer. </p><p>\u201cNow what do you say about\u2026 neapolitan? Chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry. Plus, I can go and buy some sauces and sprinkles, if you\u2019d like.\u201d Bending over, you take out the tub of icecream you have and pause for your sister\u2019s answer. Setting it on the counter, you turn around to see your sister nowhere in sight. \u201cAlright, Parasite! I need your answer if you really want me to buy something to go on your ice cream.\u201d She must be somewhere trying to hide. With a sigh, you grab your cane.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d you call from where you stand. The fear that begins to rise in your throat has your heart beating everywhere in your heart. \u201cThis isn\u2019t funny. You know I do not like it when you hide. I am a cripple!\u201d Hearing her pencil roll and drop to the floor, you go and pick it up. A fine layer of dust covers your fingers and you frown. Everywhere on the chair, flecks of dust stain the chair in differing sizes. Huge black particles stick to your skin as you swallow, looking to the floor. Dragging your fingers through the fine layer of dust, you swear you can almost smell your sister\u2019s shampoo clinging to the ash.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no.\u201d Standing up, the air thickens and you can\u2019t breathe. You stumble away, staggering to the TV where you watch as the reporter\u2019s arms begin to crumble to dust. The woman screams, begging for help and you watch as sound men and producers try to keep her together. Cars crash outside and you look out the window to see driverless cars that have swerved into trees and poles and humans that are now trapped and are turning to dust too. </p><p><i>\u2018What is happening?\u2019 </i>Your eyes widen as you see a man who is running begin to dust. His legs go first, and then he falls to the floor in a <i>poof</i>, ceasing to exist. Trembling, you try to steady yourself as you touch your face, noting that you\u2019re still here. Letting your cane fall, you turn around to make sure your whole body is intact. You shiver.</p><p>You\u2019ve never felt so cold before. Hugging yourself with one arm, you reach down to grab your cane only for your hand to disintegrate right before your eyes. Choking, the weight of your injured leg disappears and you fall to a knee, reaching with your one hand left to hold onto the one thing Thor has ever given you. The cane.</p><p>The chattering of your teeth echoes in your skull and you feel as if someone is watching you, as if <i>you </i>are watching you leave your own body. </p><p><i>\u2018Oh, God.\u2019 </i>You whimper, sinking to the floor. Your eyes burn as you see the ashes of your own body flitter through the air. You can\u2019t breathe, you can\u2019t move, you can\u2019t - you don\u2019t understand how the more you disappear, the larger the clump in your throat gets until your breaths come ragged.</p><p>Gasping for air, your lungs scream at you, burning you from inside out as you try to hold on. The tears come, hot and racing as your other leg decays and you fall against the couch, your one arm holding onto that cane as the limb slowly crumbles into the same ash that litters your kitchen chair. </p><p>You think, if you hold onto your cane long enough, perhaps Thor will hear your prayers. Hear you begging for his help. Holding it close, you press your wet cheek against the polished wood and can imagine his fingers in your hair as he whispered that it\u2019ll be fine. </p><p>It most certainly is not fucking fine as you fucking disintegrate.</p><p>\u201cThor, please. All the times I asked you to be here, please be <i>here</i>,\u201d you whisper before your voice dies out. Your heart deflates in your chest, desperation panging in your core like a drum as you reach for your phone on the table before you. It\u2019s right next to your remote and-</p><p>Your fingers fall to the ground in a fine layer of ash and dust.</p><p>Arm trembling, you use your arm to knock your phone onto the ground. Leaning down, you use your nose and try to press the home button. The screen lights up and you\u2019re face to face with a picture of Thor and a kebab of fried scorpions. It was during your stay at the Kamar-Taj. Before it caused a smile that lasted for days, and now it only causes you to release a shuddering sob.</p><p>\u201cPlease. Thor. Show up, show up, show up,\u201d you whisper to yourself, sitting up and leaning against the couch. The cane rests against your chest and you keep your blurry vision on it. Your eyes trace the gold bands, the engravings on the handle, engravings you\u2019ve ran your finger over countless times. Engravings you wish <i>meant </i>something to him.</p><p><i>To my Nightingale, </i>it reads on one side.</p><p>With what\u2019s left of your arm, you clamp it between it and your chest, forehead resting against the wood.</p><p>\u201cShow up, please! Show up. Please, please, please, please come to me.\u201d</p><p>Maybe if you hold on long enough, it\u2019ll stop. It will stop, it will stop, it will stop. Your eyes shut and your jaw clenches as tears trace rivers from your red-rimmed eyes down your face. An ugly sound bursts from your throat just as orange blurs come into existence around you. They glow like tiny suns and their rays fight away the cold that had settled on you like a sheet of snow. Warm now, you swallow and open your eyes. Now you see they are orange orbs and in each one you can almost make out a shape. Still, that cannot distract you from holding on to your life. The life you want and the life that has Thor </p><p>Pulling your head back from the wood of your cane, you read the engraving on the other side, one that curbed the loneliness until it didn\u2019t, and instead caused it to multiply exponentially until you could no longer sleep without seeing his eyes and feeling his hair at your fingertips. Only now, it gives you the courage to fight whatever this is. Fight until he gets here. He will arrive soon enough.</p><p><i>I will always love you the way flowers love the sun, the way the sun loves the moon, and the way the moon loves the stars. I will always miss you and I will always know that an angel like you deserves the heaven I cannot give. I will love you like the bird who loves freedom, who is free to fly, but chooses to stay.</i></p><p>\u201cThor, I\u2019ve always asked you to stay.\u201d Your lips press against the engraving and you hiccough, trying to keep your voice steady but failing. \u201cPlease find me. Please, stay. Please, love me like you said you would. Thor, I\u2019ve let you go. Now, it\u2019s time for you to stay. Please, you-\u201d</p><p>The TV is left on loud. It nearly overpowers the sound of your cane clattering against the wood floor.</p><p><b>TAGS: </b><a>@teawithbucky</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGAnchA7bVQWLX-zuK7xlEA\" target=\"_blank\">@jcc04220</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msUr3307P6H3pHP96P5oVOA\" target=\"_blank\">@shenala</a></p>",

Those code words. Every single time - it\u2019s never just a visit.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cWhy are you really here?\u201d you ask, voice colder. You\u2019re determined to push him away this time. You close the door and he sits down on the couch with a heavy sigh. Sensing that something\u2019s truly wrong, you tell your sister to go upstairs to finish washing up and walk around to sit beside him. When he turns around to see your sister\u2019s gone, he finally keens over and removes his hand from his abdomen, revealing a gross blood stain from a pulsating wound.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d You\u2019ve never seen it this bad. Darting up as fast as you can, you limp to the kitchen to grab scissors and bandages, a needle, towels and a cream from the last time. Sitting down, you push up his shirt as he lays back.</p><p>\u201cI went to the hospital. It stopped it for a while, but,\u201d he hisses as you snip the stitches that are trying to keep his skin together, \u201cit didn\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think I can help you? I told you I can\u2019t do this anymore. I\u2019m not that kind of doctor,\u201d you say but your actions betray your words. He takes a hold of your hands, blue eyes meeting yours earnestly. It pauses your work and you\u2019re forced to look at him. You swallow, the pain in your chest migrating to your throat and cinching it tight. Your jaw clenches and he cups your cheek, blood sticking.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d he whispers and you tear your eyes away to continue snipping away the stitches. It\u2019s a long cut, deep, and it\u2019s seven inches if you can hazard a guess, from his armpit and slicing diagonally down his side. \u201cI know I cannot ask you for anything-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did drop a building on me,\u201d you say and he grimaces. Placing the scissors down on the table, you soak up as much blood as you can, pressing hard against the cut despite Thor\u2019s groans.</p><p>\u201cAre we going to argue about Sokovia again?\u201d he whispers and you pull his hand away from your face and start squirting cream onto your hand to slather onto his wound. \u201cI told you that Ultron would\u2019ve-\u201d</p><p>\u201cReduced me to ash. I know. But Ultron already killed my parents,\u201d you say stiffly. \u201cThor, you gave me this house, among other things\u2014\u201d He blinks at how you avoid speaking of it, your time away\u2014 \u201cso I will always owe you a debt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said you\u2019re not that kind of doctor anymore,\u201d he says and you sigh, wiping your hands on another towel. Placing a fist against your other hand\u2019s palm, you draw out a long, thin, thread. It sparks, lighting up both of your faces as you continue drawing out until your arms can no longer stretch. Then you twist it around your wrist, staring at the ugly, oozing gash and estimating how much you\u2019d need.</p><p>\u201cIt helps when only one patient needs special care, not twenty,\u201d you murmur, guiding the Eldritch thread through the needle. \u201cStay still.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he whispers, eyes closing as his head drops back against the cushions. Your eyes trace over his face, and your heart aches for him. The debts have been repaid.</p><p>You know you only do this out of love.</p><p><b><i>\u2018Cause if I could see your face once more<br>I could die a happy man, I\u2019m sure</i></b></p><p>\u201cYou need rest. Whatever did this to you can wait another day,\u201d you whisper as he eases into your bed. </p><p>\u201cHow did you leave?\u201d he asks and you smile bitterly.\u00a0\u201cDo they know where you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly the Ancient One knows I\u2019m here. Her, and S.H.I.E.L.D. It is extraordinary what <i>explaining</i>\u00a0can do to sway someone\u2019s opinion.\u201d His eyes close and you make sure his bandages are not too tight before pulling his shirt back over the wound. Brushing his hair back from his face, you sigh. \u201cThor, I can\u2019t keep taking you in like this. Especially with my sister here. She asks questions every time\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d His words fill the empty silence only interrupted by your sister\u2019s footsteps on the creaking wood, running up and down the halls. \u201cI have missed you. I just needed to see you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get to miss me.\u201d The hand in your grasp clenches down and you place your other hand atop of his. \u201cBecause, to everyone else, you were never here.\u201d Despite your light words, his now-opened eyes read you like a preschooler\u2019s picture book. \u201cAnd you never <i>are </i>here. You got me a house, and a job, and I\u2019m grateful, but I wish I could have the man I love, too. I mean, you show up as soon as you need me, never before. You leave the next morning. That\u2019s no way for me to hold on to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen move on. I would never hold it against you,\u201d he breathes and you want to slap him. You would\u2019ve if he weren\u2019t so injured.</p><p>Laughing, you let go of his hand and stand. \u201cYou\u2019re an idiot.\u201d Taking your cane, you walk to the door and open it to see your sister zoom past you. When she notices your door\u2019s open, she stops before you, a truck in hand.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s Thor here? Is he going to leave, again?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see. You can say hi, but don\u2019t be too rough. He\u2019s hurt,\u201d you say and your sister barges in, climbing onto your bed. You watch as Thor sits up, though he needs to rest, an easy smile on his face as your sister talks animatedly to him. Thor\u2019s eyes light up and you sigh. When your sister starts making vroom noises with her truck, engrossed in her whole imaginary world, begging Thor to be part of it, you feel bile crawl up your throat.</p><p>You once begged Thor to be part of your world, too.</p><p><b><i>When you said your last goodbye<br></i></b><b><i>I died a little bit inside</i></b></p><p><i>As you check Thor\u2019s stitches, you know that he\u2019s fine. That he\u2019s well and healed. But his screams the night before echo in your head and you feel the urge to ask. You have lunch waiting but it can wait.</i></p><p><i>\u201cAre you\u2026 okay?\u201d you ask and his eyebrows raise in surprise. \u201cYou mutter about Infinity Stones in your sleep, and I was just wondering-\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI am fine, Nightingale.\u201d You bite your lip, dubious. \u201cI will stay another night, if you wish.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cI do wish, but the universe needs you, as always.\u201d Through your closed throat, you manage a smile as your eyes burn. \u201cWe\u2019ve had this conversation before, Thor.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI know. But perhaps you can come with me this time. I\u2026 I see fire in my dreams and I know where I must go.\u201d The feeling of flight in your chest has you nearly breathless but then you think of your sister, her wide eyes, who still believes in magic, who doesn\u2019t know her blood wields the very same magic she dreams of seeing. \u201cAre you needed at Kamar-Taj?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo.\u201d Not like you want to go back there. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 I go and leave the Parasite behind?\u201d you ask. She\u2019s at school. You\u2019ll need to pick her up in a few hours. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t do that. She hates our grandparents.\u201d Thor chuckles and the corner of your lip twitches up. \u201cYou can tell me, so I know you will be\u2026. Well, not safe, but I know where you will be. Even if I cannot be there.\u201d</i></p><p><i>His hands cup your face and the smell of cold electricity buzzes over his skin to yours, prickling at your cheek. \u201cThis will be the last time,\u201d he promises.</i></p><p><i>Your smile wavers. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the first time I have heard this.\u201d His hands fall away and you open the door. \u201cWell, you can go. You are my last patient before lunch.\u201d Limping away to the counter, you feel his hand fall away. Fiddling with popsicle sticks to make it seem like you\u2019re busy, you hear him shift on the exam table. Thor hops off the table and your hand stills.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou understand that it is my duty.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI understand well enough.\u201d Your voice is frigid and causes him to pause. \u201cBut every time you leave, I will never know if you will return.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNightingale, I-\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThor, just stay. Because I can\u2019t keep loving you like this.\u201d A weight drops in your gut as his blue eyes widen. You turn to him, hand on the knob. \u201cI am asking you to stay. And you know I am stubborn and that I do not bend easily, but I will for you. If you will </i>stay <i>for me</i>.\u201d\u00a0<i>Opening the door, you wait. He walks over to you, jaw set. He licks his lips and you know he wants to kiss you, but you turn your face away. You cannot love a man like this. \u201cPlease stay. Just stay.\u201d There is silence and you know his answer.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI love you,\u201d he says. His hand cups your cheek, wiping away the tears you refused to acknowledge.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI know,\u201d you say as your hand covers his, \u201cbut that is not enough.\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>I lay in tears in bed all night<br></i></b><b><i>Alone without you by my side</i></b></p><p>Lying down on the couch, you stare up at the ceiling. Upstairs, Thor rests and you glance at the analog clock you had plugged in earlier that night. You have twenty-three minutes before you have to get up and check his wound. For some reason, it still bleeds and the stitching loosens, meaning you have to cut the old thread and suture his skin back together again.</p><p>Your mind searches for the cause. Books litter the coffee table with mythological tomes on different creatures and spells, but you know they\u2019re all useless. Groaning, you sit up and prepare yourself for the long trek up the stairs.</p><p>Your lungs are hollow and you wonder if this cracking abyss will widen or close when he leaves. It\u2019s always hard to tell when he\u2019s near. The tears come before you realize. They flow down the corners of your eyes, nestling near your ears and you don\u2019t bother to wipe them away. There\u2019s no more fight left. </p><p>When you check the clock again, you know it\u2019s time for you to get up. Get up, get your shit together, get up those stairs.</p><p>So you do. And, although your eyes glance over the Sling Ring resting near your cane, you know it\u2019s best to limit how much magic you use. Your sister can never know what you can do. Your sister will want you to be a superhero. You don\u2019t know if you have the strength to try. Besides, your sister will lose the life she has now. She\u2019d have to live with her grandparents.</p><p>\u2018She doesn\u2019t want that,\u2019 you tell yourself as your cane stomps against the creaking wound. It pushes you up to the top and you make your way to your room. Opening the door, you perch on the end of the bed. Moonlight is streaming in through the curtains and you watch the rain fall, dashing against your windows.</p><p>\u201cNightingale?\u201d a hoarse voice calls and you turn your attention to the waking man. \u201cIs it time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Gently pulling up his shirt, you unwrap the bandages until you see the wound. It\u2019s healing better, clotting well. Grabbing a pair of gloves, you slap them on and touch the area around it, making sure it\u2019s holding together. \u201cYou\u2019re healing better. That\u2019s good. It\u2019s good.\u201d Your voice dies as he tries to sit up. \u201cNo, don\u2019t. You need to stay still. It just started getting better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you use whatever sorcery you use for this to heal your leg?\u201d He\u2019s asked this question before. You don\u2019t have the heart to give him the answer.</p><p><b><i>But if you loved me, why\u2019d you leave me?<br>Take my body, take my body</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cCan you tell us your name?\u201d they ask in English and you blink against the bright lights. They\u2019re testing your pupil response, to see if you have any brain damage. So you\u2019re in a hospital. That\u2019s good.</i></p><p><i>\u201c(Y/N) (L/N). I\u2019m a doctor,\u201d you rasp. Your English is rusty and your voice is hoarse, which doesn\u2019t make for a flattering sound, \u201cand if I am not mistaken, this is\u2026 not Novi Grad\u2019s General Hospital.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re right. What year is it?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201c2015.\u201d You try to sit up and a nurse helps with pillows underneath your back as you continue to blink. A straw is poked at your lips and you sip in water that runs down your throat silkily. \u201cWhere am I?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat\u2019s the last thing you remember?\u201d</i></p><p><i>You\u2019re paralyzed. You are as you stare up, watching your world crumble around you. Shielding your sister beneath your body, you sob into her hair, watching as slabs of your home crush your parents bodies to dust. The snap of their bones echoes in your ears like a sick symphony. Curling into a ball, you hold your sister\u2019s head to you, knowing you can\u2019t move. </i></p><p><i>\u201cCome on!\u201d The voice is rough, accented, and when you look up, you see a man in a red cape and long blond hair. His blue eyes anchor you to the fact that part of your home city is floating in mid air because of some crazy robot.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cI can\u2019t!\u201d you scream and he glances around with a grimace before running in. \u201cTake my sister. Please. Make sure she is safe,\u201d you whisper to whomever is listening. Your sister screams when the floor trembles under his footsteps and you wonder if you\u2019ll fall through the three floors beneath you of the apartment building you live in. Still, he sees your sister\u2019s bright red shirt and scoops her up first. You thank the ones listening that the Avenger has taken her first just as the ceiling roared in protest. A slab of concrete is just about to fall on you but he swings his hammer, demolishing it. The debris scatters around you, flying into the cracks on the floor. The wood moans, weakening at the edges.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHold on to me,\u201d he mutters in your ear just as the world falls out beneath your feet. Screaming, you swipe blindly in front of you to grab his arm but your fingers barely snag. </i></p><p><i>There will never be such a feeling as free-falling through three stories, watching the dust and metal and glass and wood all fall beside you and you realize that you are them as much as they are you. They were the building blocks that made your apartment a home, just as you are. Just as you were.</i></p><p><i>The ground comes too fast and the only thing you hear is the sound of your bones breaking like a cacophony of snares. </i></p><p><i>The darkness that hits you is faster than any flood.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI fell,\u201d you say in the present. \u201cDuring Novi Grad, I fell from my apartment building. Three stories.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou had a subdural hematoma. You were extracted immediately and brought here where you were operated on.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cJust one operation?\u201d you ask and now you realize why your head feels stomped in.</i></p><p><i>\u201cA craniotomy for your subdural hematoma, and you insisted on keeping your leg so the orthopedic surgeon placed fixators and more titanium than any other patient in this hospital in your leg to keep it straight from foot to femur. The shock had travelled up your leg. Oblique foot fractures, open tibial and fibula fractures, and a comminuted femur fracture.\u201d Your eyes drift to where you leg is encased in a metal cage to prevent movement. It\u2019s wrapped in a cast, completely immovable.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI see,\u201d you manage to say. You\u2019re well aware of the beeping of your monitors. A nurse goes to your leads, a needle poised but the doctor holds up a hand. Taking a deep breath, you nod. \u201cKeep going.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou needed a partial splenectomy and one of your kidneys was removed. Besides that, you\u2019re very lucky to have survived.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAnd my sister?\u201d The doctor pauses, lips pressing together. \u201cIs she okay? One of them took her. The blond one, red cape, has a hammer-\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cShe\u2019s been waiting for you to wake up with the Avenger for over three days now,\u201d the doctor says and you blink. \u201cI don\u2019t recommend seeing her, but if you are up for it-\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI am.\u201d Nodding, the doctor turns to the nurse who goes to the door. \u201cDoctor?\u201d the surgeon turns to you once more and you look at your leg blankly. \u201cI will not be able to walk properly again, will I?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo. Not unless you amputate.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo. It is - I need my leg. I want to keep it,\u201d you say and the doctor hums. \u201cI have been told I\u2019m stubborn.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou are. Even when you\u2019re delirious.\u201d The doctor writes something down in your chart before going to your I.V. and checking the levels. </i></p><p><i>\u201cYou could have overridden my decision, declared me unfit to make medical decisions. Why did you listen to me?\u201d Your eyes drift slowly over to the doctor who smiles. </i></p><p><i>\u201cThe choice to make is always yours,\u201d he says and when your sister and the Avenger enters the room, the doctor turns to leave. You swear you can hear the slight creak in his leg as he walks away.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re okay!\u201d your sister cries in your mother tongue, climbing onto your bed and snuggling into your side. The Avenger has a soft expression written into his mouth and eyes. \u201cMommy and Daddy aren\u2019t here yet. I don\u2019t know if they know we\u2019re here.\u201d Your heart skids to a stop and you try to redirect the flow of conversation before you burst into tears. You feel them catch in your throat, bruising and tight as you struggle to speak.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhere is here? Exactly?\u201d you ask to the Avenger.</i></p><p><i>\u201cNew York Presbyterian Hospital,\u201d the Avenger says and your eyes lock onto his. \u201cI am Thor Odinson.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You are wary of the him, his tall stature, but he exudes easiness so you relax against the pillows, holding your sister to you. There\u2019s a long scratch on your sister\u2019s arm that\u2019s stitched up well. You hadn\u2019t noticed it before. \u201cI know that.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAnd once you\u2019re out of the hospital, I had Tony Stark grant you a new home and job waiting for you as soon as you\u2019re able.\u201d Your mouth drops open and he smiles half-heartedly. \u201cIt\u2019s the least I could do. I did drop a building on you.\u201d You smile, exhaling softly as your sister buries her face to your side. </i></p><p><i>\u201cDid you do this for every Sokovian you nearly killed or am I special?\u201d you ask.</i></p><p><i>\u201cA nightingale is always special,\u201d is his answer. \u201cI heard you were a doctor.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI am a doctor,\u201d you respond stiffly and he sits on the edge of your bed, far away as if he is not sure you want him close. He saved your sister and she\u2019s the only family you have left. That\u2019s enough for you. \u201cWhy did that robot try to lift Sokovia out of the sky?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Thor shifts in his seat and you frown.</i></p><p><i>\u201cBecause he wanted peace in our time.\u201d You nod and Thor sighs. \u201cHe wanted peace by killing everyone.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOh. That sounds stupid,\u201d you say and Thor chuckles. It\u2019s a curious sound, one that warms your chest. \u201cThank you, for saving my sister.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIf you need anything, I\u2019m a call away.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI am in your debt,\u201d you point out but he shakes his head, standing up.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt was your home that I destroyed. Let me make it up to you.\u201d You smile as he leaves. The next morning, there is a postcard with a picture of a brown bird with a white belly - a nightingale. Your sister reads it out to you, and by the end of it all, the sobs that want to macerate your heart as you think of your dead parents come.</i></p><p><i>Attached to the back of the postcard are two wedding rings, taped securely to the white cardstock. You imagine Thor digging through the casualties, trying to find the two he only had a glance of. </i></p><p><i>You tell your sister then that you are orphans. She slips your mother\u2019s finger onto her thumb and your father\u2019s finger onto yours.</i></p><p><i>You know you owe the Avenger more than you can ever say.</i></p><p><b><i>All I want is, and all I need is<br></i></b><b><i>To find somebody, I\u2019ll find somebody</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cSo, you ended your relationship with Dr. Foster?\u201d you ask and Thor nods. \u201cWhy?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cBecause she needed to concentrate on work and it didn\u2019t seem to work anymore.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cBut you love her. That doesn\u2019t make sense. You can make it work.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cJane was tired of my disappearances. She wished to move on and she no longer wanted to make it work, and I suppose I saw it coming. There is a certain way she acted around me, as if she were guilty. In the end, I\u2026 I let her go.\u201d He picks at his fruit cup he had taken from your tray of food and you grimace. \u201cThis is disgusting. How dare they serve this to healing patients?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYeah, I would not eat it if I were dying.\u201d Smiling, though it appears worn at the edges, he sets down the cup and extends a hand. Taking it, you sit up and he helps with your pillows. Your leg cramps and you suck in a breath.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIs it your leg?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYes.\u201d His hand rests in yours still and you look down at it. He draws his hand away. \u201cThank you for taking my sister to school. I know you have other things to do.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI think I\u2019ve found a lead on one of the Infinity Stones. It\u2019s the least I could do as a farewell before I go for who knows how long.\u201d You nod and he offers a slight smile.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhich one do you think it is?\u201d Ever since Thor had taken to visiting you, you\u2019ve been lending an ear to his dreams and adventures. You barely think it\u2019s crazy when a robot almost leveled\u00a0a city by lifting up a piece of the earth into the sky.</i></p><p><i>\u201cPerhaps the Time Stone. And it\u2019s on Earth. Do you want to come?\u201d You frown at his offer and the smile fades. \u201cYour sister can come, too. I assure you, it\u2019s all paid for.\u201d You look out the window and sigh, looking at the Avengers Tower.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI need to get out of here,\u201d you breathe and the smile that splits his face is the sun in all its glory. \u201cWhen can we go?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAs soon as you\u2019re released from the hospital,\u201d he promises and you feel the smile tugging at your stubborn lips until you beam at the blond before you. \u201cI\u2019ll take you to somewhere called Kamar-Taj. That\u2019s where I think it is.\u201d Nodding, you wet your lips, unable to contain your smile.</i></p><p><i>\u201cOkay.\u201d You fiddle with the ring around your thumb before piping up again, \u201cThor?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYes?\u201d He\u2019s moved on to the cookie which is, unanimously, better than the fruit cup. When he sees you looking, he sets it down. \u201cSorry, do you want the cookie?\u201d You simply smile and extend a hand for him to take. He does, thumb running over your knuckles.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI am sorry, about Jane.\u201d His smile is the the sun on a cloudy day. \u201cI wish it were different.\u201d</i></p><p><i>He nods, turning to your cookie before chancing a glance at you. You give him a nod and he takes it, unwrapping it from its plastic and ripping off a piece to pop into his mouth. \u201cThank you, Nightingale.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d you say.</i></p><p><b><i>Like you, oh, oh, oh</i></b></p><p><i>The knocking makes you start awake and you feel your back cramping the fuck up. Pushing yourself up, you groan when Thor shifts, murmuring to himself under his breath. Sighing, you spare him a glance before getting up and looking at the clock. Only forty-seven minutes of sleep. Fantastic. When the God of Thunder himself shows up on your doorstep bleeding and needing a place to crash, it always means sleepless nights for you.</i></p><p><i>Taking your cane, you walk down the stairs and wipe at the dried spit near your mouth. Might as well look less-monstrous while you still can.</i></p><p><i>Once you reach the bottom, you open the door.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat?\u201d you snap before the scowl drops off your face. \u201cOh, shit.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWe had a consult this morning. You overslept.\u201d Groaning, you let Stephen in as you wipe at your eyes. \u201cWhere\u2019s the kid?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cStill sleeping, probably. She had a late night. So did I and wait - Stephen, how did you even find where I live?\u201d The surgeon sat down on her couch, spreading out C.T. and M.R.I scans. Knowing you have no way of making him leave, you sigh. \u201cWhat was the consult again?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cPatient came in two days ago at 11:29 PM.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cRight. Uh, let me see.\u201d Sitting down beside him, you take out the echo. \u201cCan you go over the patient history again?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThirty-four year old female. Presented with exertional chest pain. She came into the E.R. after she fell and had a seizure. Brain tumour. Her family has a family history of coronary artery disease.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cLife style?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cActive, stressful.\u201d You inspect the echocardiogram, eyes straining. You need some coffee. \u201cCardio said it showed normal sinus rhythm with no ST, or T changes.\u201d Nodding, you switch to the C.T.s and M.R.I.s. You whistle at the size of the tumour. </i></p><p><i>\u201cYou are going to operate on the tumour?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cObviously.\u201d Rolling your eyes, you take out the labs. \u201cThe only thing I can\u2019t figure out is the chest pain.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cSo you\u2019ve come to me for help,\u201d you remark. \u201cPass me the labs.\u201d The scans are exchanged for the sheets of paper and you read down the list. \u201cComplete blood picture, comprehensive metabolic panel, three sets of cardiac enzymes. All normal.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cDo you see why I\u2019ve come here now? She needs a cure. Now.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cRun a sixty-four cardiac computed tomography angiography.\u201d Setting down the labs back onto the folder, you turn to your colleague. \u201cIt could be anomalous coronaries. So, get a high volume study to rule it out. Call me for the results. You know, it could be an AVM.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cGreat.\u201d Stephen stood up and from his bag, took out a travelling mug you had left at the hospital a few months before. You\u2019d never gather the courage to take it since Stephen had taken to choosing spots for consults. \u201cYou never took it back.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThanks,\u201d you mutter dryly, delighted to find it filled. \u201cIs this coffee?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m not a completely terrible person.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAh, but you are to Dr. Palmer,\u201d you say, taking your cane and pushing yourself up. \u201cDon\u2019t you have patients to see to, Dr. Strange?\u201d Stephen was about to respond when there was a clutter. Your thoughts instantly zeroed in on something happened to Thor and you leave your mug on the table to limp as quick as you can to the staircase. Climbing the stairs, you\u2019re well aware of Stephen following after you as you open the door to your room.</i></p><p><i>On the floor, is Thor.</i></p><p><i>Releasing a sigh of relief, you get in and help him sit up to lean against the bed. Crouching, you lift his shirt and check to see if his wound has reopened.</i></p><p><i>\u201cSorry,\u201d Thor whispers and you offer a strained smile. Stephen crouches down as well, frowning. He inspects Thor\u2019s pupil response\u00a0with a torch he keeps in his pocket and touches the head, testing for any shifts in the bones.</i></p><p><i>\u201cDidn\u2019t know your house was a clinic. You might want to keep it more sanitary, if it is,\u201d he commented as he worked. Checking on the wound on the other side of Thor, you send your colleague a glare.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d you retort as the two of you help Thor back into bed. \u201cAre you okay? Did you hit your head?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo, I\u2019m okay.\u201d Thor\u2019s eyes dart between Stephen and you. \u201cWho is he?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cA colleague. It\u2019s fine. Come on, back to sleep,\u201d you say. Thor sends a reluctant glance at you but you ignore it, pulling the covers up. \u201cI\u2019ll check in on you in a bit, alright?\u201d The blond sets his jaw and glances at the shelves that line your walls. \u201cFine. Read a book. Just, rest, okay?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cFine. If you need me-\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo, if </i>you <i>need </i>me<i>, you call. Or get my sister. Scream if you have to.\u201d Stephen helps you back to your feet, handing you your cane and you sigh, closing the door behind you two.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHe\u2019s your boyfriend?\u201d the neurosurgeon asks and you shoot him a glare. \u201cI\u2019m just saying what I\u2019m reading.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHe\u2019s a patient,\u201d you say and Stephen smirks, not saying a thing. He gathers his files and you are this close to kicking him out the door to get his cocky smile out of your face when he walks out. Groaning to yourself, you climb back up the stairs and slip into your room. Thor\u2019s reading something on the history of medicine and you smile. That was the first book you had him read when you first met him.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIs he your boyfriend?\u201d he asks without looking up and you look to the sky, wondering why you had to be in this kind of parallel universe. Maybe it\u2019s \u2018cause some God thinks it\u2019s funny. If you have to choose, you\u2019d think it\u2019d be Loki, who Thor had told you many fond stories of.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHe\u2019s a colleague,\u201d you say and Thor narrows his eyes. You let your cane drop against the floor as you sit down on the bed with a huff. \u201cHe\u2019s a friend,\u201d you admit. \u201cHe\u2019s a surgeon and came for a consult. I missed it this morning.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI see.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThor-\u201d</i></p><p><i><br>\u201cIf he makes you happy, then I have no qualms about it.\u201d Rolling your eyes, you bite your tongue and brush hair away from his face.</i></p><p><i>\u201cGet some rest. I can convince you when you are not in danger of bleeding to death.\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>Like you, like you</i></b></p><p>\u201cThank you, Stan,\u201d you say to the mailman. He smiles at you and does a two-finger salute before heading back down to the sidewalk. Closing the door, you sort through the mail and toss the junk into the trash before heading up. You\u2019ll read them before bed tonight. Walking into your room after a knock on the open door, you see Thor staring out the window. He must\u2019ve heard your conversation with Stan.</p><p>\u201cStan, hm?\u201d he says without tearing his eyes away from the window. Again with this crap. Tossing the letters you need onto a table, you sit on the edge of the bed.</p><p>\u201cThor. Brush your teeth and stop pouting.\u201d He gazes at you, shocked, and you arch an eyebrow. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t going to sleep, then clean yourself up.\u201d Pushing off the covers, he scoots to the other side of the bed and gets up slowly. Following after him, you sigh. He\u2019s leaning over the sink and you lean against the door frame, crossing your arms. Since he\u2019s got a toothbrush in his mouth, you take it as an opportunity to speak.</p><p>\u201cThe reason I do not use magic to heal my leg is because it is one of the only reminders I have of you, of what we have and of my parents and of this chapter in my life.\u201d The toothbrush pauses for a moment, and then continues. \u201cMy leg\u2026 is my penance for all the things I didn\u2019t do. And now I cherish my sister far more than I did before, I love my job and I am grateful to save lives when I couldn\u2019t save my parents. I love you far more than I would\u2019ve without this. And without it, I wouldn\u2019t have loved you at all.\u201d</p><p>He rinses out his mouth and you smile.</p><p>\u201cWhen you are gone and I miss you, and it rains far harder than it should, I think of you. My leg cramps and it hurts far more than it should, and I still think of you. Any other day, I am fine. It\u2019s just those rainy days. I look at my cane, and I think of how lucky I am to experience the kind of love you have brought me, and how cursed I must be to see you leave every time.\u201d</p><p>He stares ahead to the mirror and you take in his side profile. His hair\u2019s tied up in a bun, courtesy of you, but a few tendrils still frame his face. \u201cWhen I see birds, I think of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I can live without you, right?\u201d you say and he turns to pin you with those freezing cold eyes. Eyes that remind you of a summer day and a thunderstorm. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to. That is why I ask you to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he says, letting the toothbrush clatter in the glass cup. \u201cBut you know it\u2019s not healthy\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. That does not stop me from wanting you.\u201d You turn to leave. \u201cLunch will be ready in an hour.\u201d </p><p><b><i>So you brought out the best of me<br></i></b><b><i>A part of me I\u2019d never seen</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cI asked Stark to pay for your rent and S.H.I.E.L.D. has agents monitoring your sister at all times,\u201d Thor tells you for the thirtieth time as the two of you migrate through the busy street.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThor, do you even know where we\u2019re going?\u201d you ask, stumbling after him. You\u2019ll never get used to this cane, but you can at least admire it\u2019s wood finishing and gold embellishments. Just another thing you have to thank Thor for.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI have a rough estimate,\u201d he says and you laugh as he holds onto your hand, making sure he doesn\u2019t lose you. You\u2019ve never been outside your home country and all this, the new sights and sounds and languages, has your eyes constantly open, trying to soak it all in. \u201cCome on, down this alley.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWait, I need to breathe,\u201d you wheeze and he pulls you in before you\u2019re run over by a bike. Chest to chest, the two of you laugh until your lungs ache, foreheads pressed against each other. Eyes closing, you let your head drop until it rests against his chest. \u201cI\u2019ve never been out of my country before. This is all very new,\u201d you say and he smiles, cupping your face. \u201cI am glad I got to experience it with you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAnd I you, Nightingale.\u201d The smile hurts but it\u2019s all worth it as you take in a deep breath. All the delicious stalls full of fresh food and spices has your head light as Thor takes a step back. \u201cCome on. We need to be there before nightfall.\u201d Nodding, you walk after him, through the crowd. You can\u2019t recall the last time you\u2019ve felt so energized, so daring and high on adrenaline. Exhilaration pumping in your veins, you wish you could run so you could fully experience what is Kathmandu.</i></p><p><b><i>You took my soul and wiped it clean</i></b></p><p><i>Once you get there, you\u2019re introduced to a woman. She pours you tea while others rid them of your cloaks. The cup is warm in your hands, strangely seeping into your blood and spreading throughout your body.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>The Ancient One, they call her. The others, a dark-skinned man named Mordo, and another with long hair and only one hand named Hamir stand by but only Hamir is dismissed. The smell of incense is heady and the light filters dustily into the room. Sipping, you\u2019re delighted at the sweet tea that\u2019s mellow yet fragrant.</i><br></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re here for the Stone, are you not?\u201d she asks and you look to Thor. His lips press together as he nods. \u201cBut you are not.\u201d The Ancient One\u2019s eyes land on yours and you nearly drop your porcelain cup. \u201cDo you need more honey with your tea?\u201d Glancing down at the golden liquid, you shake your head. </i></p><p><i>\u201cI am only here to make sure it is kept safe. There is a danger looming ahead, and they will seek the Stone.\u201d The Ancient One smiles serenely, looking to Mordo. \u201cIs it true you keep the Time Stone here?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cMordo, take the Avenger to the Eye of Agamotto.\u201d The man nods, gesturing for the blond to follow. When you go too, you are stopped. \u201cI must speak to you.\u201d Thor is reluctant to leave you but you give him a nod, saying it\u2019s okay as you turn to the Ancient One.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d you ask warily, taking a step back when she holds the kettle to you.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s only tea.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI do not need tea. How did you know I did not come for the Stone?\u201d you ask and the woman smiles that smile again. It mystifies you.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI know you came here for him. But I also know you search for purpose, Doctor.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWe are the Masters of The Mystic Arts.\u201d You arch an eyebrow.</i></p><p><i>\u201cLike magic?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cLike a science,\u201d she corrects, setting the kettle down. \u201cSit.\u201d You slump down on the floor, crossing a leg underneath your injured one. She sits in front of you, cross-legged. \u201cI know you wish to heal those you cannot. You wish you could have saved your parents.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI do.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou are not very ambitious, are you?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAmbition causes mistakes,\u201d you say. \u201cI became a doctor to help those who needed it.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat if I told you there was a way?\u201d As she speaks, orange light carves the air into geometric shapes. Your eyes fixate on the glowing, orange sparks emitted from lines that seem to burn into the air and you reach out a hand to touch.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThen I\u2019d say teach me,\u201d you manage to whisper before the air is stolen from your lungs. Seeing is believing but your mind cannot come up with a scientific explanation of this. \u201cWhat is this? Can you teach me?\u201d The Ancient One smiles.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIf you are willing to listen.\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>Our love was made for movie screens</i></b></p><p><i>Thor tries to visit you every day.</i></p><p><i>Some days he looks tired, other days not so. You go home every day to your sister who goes to school a week later.</i></p><p><i>Your life seems to have purpose for the first time in a long while and you show him your Sling Ring and how you can imagine the top of Cairns rock at sunrise. It\u2019s one of your favourite places to be, now that you can travel almost anywhere in the world.</i></p><p><i>As the orange sparks flitter down to the ground, tracing a circle, you smile at him. \u201cCome with me.\u201d With that, the portal opens to reveal the flat of the red-brown rock and you step through. He follows after you, watching the sun bleed into the sky. Purple and orange tangle together as the golden rays of the sun shadow the clouds. The stars are retreating with the inky night and you sit down with a exhausated smile.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt is beautiful here. I thought I would never love a sunrise more than I did in Sokovia, but here, everything is so clear.\u201d Turning to Thor who still stands, you pat the spot beside you and he sits down as well. \u201cThank you, for bringing me to Kamar-Taj.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt was my pleasure, Nightingale,\u201d he says and you smile. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I have been absent as of late.\u201d You shrug. You\u2019ve been busy too, being a student again. It\u2019s refreshing to learn more than you ever thought possible. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you.\u201d<br><br>\u201cAnd I you,\u201d you whisper. \u201cThe Parasite has something she wants to give you, when you get the chance to visit her.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI wanted to see you first.\u201d Touched, you lean against him. The energy leeched from your bones, you barely keep your eyes open for the sunrise. His lips press against your hair and you sink farther against him until you lay against him like a sack of flour. The sunrise bathes both of you in gold and you look up at him. His eyes glow tenderly and he leans down to press his lips against yours. Eyes widening, you don\u2019t move for a split second and then you realize, that this is truly happening.</i></p><p><i>With all that\u2019s going on, you find it hilarious that this is the thing that surprises you the most. So you let yourself go with the flow. You throw an arm around his neck, holding him against you. Eyes closed, you savour in his smell of sweat and cold electricity and the ecstasy of his plush mouth until you must breathe for air. Curling up against him, you smile against his lips as he pecks the corner of your mouth.</i></p><p><i>\u201cTo tide you over until I see you next,\u201d he murmurs and you hug him close. You don\u2019t want to let him go. \u201cI promise to be back as soon as I am able, Nightingale.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cSee to it that it\u2019s sooner rather than later,\u201d you whisper. Drawing back, he smiles and kisses you chastely on the lips.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI promise.\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>But if you loved me, why\u2019d you leave me?<br></i></b><b><i>Take my body, take my body</i></b></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time for you to go to school. Say bye to Thor,\u201d you tell your sister who waves to the man. \u201cHe will not be here when you\u2019re back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye, Thor!\u201d Your sister runs to him, hugging onto his legs and you cross your arms, feeling the hollowness of his absence already creeping in. \u201cI\u2019ll miss you! And (Y/N) gets sad without you.\u201d Thor\u2019s eyes lift up to meet yours and you shrug. Stepping forward, you hear the bus outside honk.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Parasite. You\u2019ve gotta go to school.\u201d Crouching down, you adjust your sister\u2019s coat and force a smile. \u201cBe good for me, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She hugs your neck and you pat her back before pulling her away. \u201cBye, Thor.\u201d Your sister looks like she\u2019s about to cry and honestly, you feel the same ever since Thor told you where he\u2019ll be going next. The two of you watch her leave before turning to each other. He closes the door and immediately your lips crash against each other. The steps you take back have you pinned against the wall as his hands cradle your face. The cane clatters to the floor as you gasp against his mouth. Your arms loop around his neck, eyes closing as he kisses you like you are the oxygen he needs. Lightning surges through your veins, your hair on end as the electricity dances over your skin.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d His breath fans over your cheek as your noses brush. \u201cAnd I promise I will try to be safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo promises you can\u2019t keep,\u201d you whisper and he kisses your lips softly, slowly. Pulling away, you continue against his persistent mouth that searches for kisses you are willing to give, \u201cI won\u2019t be there to help you, and I need to know you will be safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re not angry?\u201d murmurs the God, pulling back a fraction of an inch.</p><p>\u201cI will always be angry that you leave. And I will <i>always </i>be angry that you come back when I think I have gotten over you, but I will always love you.\u201d He smiles, bittersweet, and your hand curls against the back of his neck, bringing him back down. \u201cFor now, stay until you must leave.\u201d </p><p>He kisses you as if you are the water he needs in the desert, the fire he needs in the winter, and he kisses you as if you are the sweetest wine he will ever taste.</p><p><b><i>All I want is, and all I need is<br></i></b><b><i>To find somebody, I\u2019ll find somebody</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cWhat do you mean he\u2019s gone?\u201d you ask the Ancient One from where you are meditating. \u201cHe always comes back. Of course he\u2019s gone. Then, he comes back.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHe wished for me to tell you that he can no longer stay away from his duties, even if it means he must sacrifice you.\u201d Your leg seizes and you lean forward, fingers digging into the wood beneath you. The taste of bile, bitter and acidic floods your tongue and push yourself up onto your knees. The Ancient One stands before you with that serene expression of hers. \u201cHe has responsibilities that are more important than a single being.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI know,\u201d you say and you hate that you understand. \u201cBut so do I.\u201d The Ancient One frowns at your flat voice. Your decision may be hasty but it is made. And you are stubborn as they come. \u201cI am a doctor, and although I have not mastered all there is to learn, I cannot stay here while innocent people are dying.\u201d </i>\u2018He just left without even telling me,\u2019<i> is what you really want to say. Your heart wilts in your chest and you swallow the knot in your throat.</i></p><p><i>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Rising to your feet, you turn around so your mentor does not see you cry.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI realize now that the only thing keeping me here was him. He brought me here, and this was where he could find me. If he thinks so little of me that he doesn\u2019t even give me a proper goodbye, neither will I.\u201d The Ancient One sighs and you whirl around. \u201cYou think that this is the wrong thing to do?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI think nothing of it. I assure you. But if you truly want to forget him, perhaps you should use what you have learned.\u201d Her eyes divert to your leg and you shake your head. Pulling off your Sling Ring, you try to hand it to the Ancient One but she merely shakes her head. \u201cNo. In case you need it.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIs that allowed?\u201d The Ancient One merely smiles and turns away, leaving you to your thoughts. And the more you think, the more you wish your mind would quiet for it is a thunderstorm within your head.</i></p><p><i>Mordo is the one who sends you off with a hug and a wish good luck. \u201cYou use your skills for good,\u201d he warns and you smile.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI will. I am a doctor, after all.\u201d Smiling, you take your cane and limp down the alley to the building where your sister is. You tell the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent outside your door that you need a flight back to New York City and prepare yourself to tell your sister that you\u2019re moving yet again, and that Thor is gone.</i></p><p><i>When Tony Stark arrives in a jet to come pick you up personally, he shrugs and says, \u201cThor was fond of you. Fond enough to have you on S.H.I.E.L.D surveillance and make sure you\u2019ve got a trust fund for both you and your sister.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You blink. You never knew that. Tony Stark then adds, \u201cWell, not the trust fund. He just said make sure you\u2019re financially stable so you don\u2019t die homeless. The trust fund was all me. And I got you a job. You\u2019ll work at a clinic that\u2019s in close association with Metro-General hospital.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThank you, Mr. Stark.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cMake it Tony.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Nodding to yourself, you board the jet and sit beside Mr. Stark who talks the whole way. It\u2019s a welcome distraction from the cracks in your heart that you try to mend with makeshift tape and glue. </i></p><p><b><i>Oh, oh, oh, oh<br></i></b><b><i>Oh, oh, oh, oh<br></i></b><b><i>Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh</i></b></p><p>\u201cYou really have to leave,\u201d you say to Thor as he kisses your bare shoulder. \u201cSave the world, and all that. Travel to Muspelheim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he whispers against your neck and you squirm. \u201cThe doctor would be good for you. He seems smart, a bit arrogant but you like the arrogant type.\u201d You turn to glare at him before realizing what he\u2019s doing. He\u2019s trying to make his departure easier on your soul, as he\u2019s always attempted to do.</p><p>\u201cYou know telling me to move on won\u2019t help it hurt less,\u201d you tell him, kissing his swollen mouth. He sighs, carding his fingers through your hair. \u201cBesides, I haven\u2019t heard from him since his car crash. He was in an accident and has gone missing ever since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s terrible. How about the mailman?\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>So</i>, this Muspelheim\u2026\u201d He frowns at your diversion but allows it all the same. \u201cThat is the realm of fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the fire in my dreams that have shown me an image of Surtur. I see my home, purged by fire and I have realized that perhaps Ragnar\u00f6k is coming sooner than expected.\u201d Your legs tangle in his, skin against skin as your fingers trace the veins along his arms.</p><p>\u201cI have a sense of what that is like, to see your home crumble,\u201d you murmur and he holds you to his chest. You are a comma to his body, curling against him as your words ghost against his collarbones. \u201cIf it is your home you see destroyed, then you really must go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only wish I could take you with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could go.\u201d His arms tighten around you and you feel your heart in your throat as your hand flattens against his back and your index finger traces circles against his skin. \u201cBut you need to go alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will in five minutes.\u201d His eyes close. You tilt your head up at him, the warmth within you ebbing and flowing from your chest to your fingertips like a warm fire within you. \u201cLet me have five more minutes with you.\u201d You close your eyes as he hugs you tight, knowing that when you wake up, he will be gone.</p><p><i><b>But if you loved me, why\u2019d you leave me?<br></b></i><i><b>Take my body, take my body</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s not closing!\u201d you whisper as Thor uses his hands to hold his flesh together. \u201cWhat caused this?

I went to the hospital and they gave me their strongest suture. It will not hold.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThen what can I do?\u201d you ask and your eyes meet his. He is focused, assured, and you shake your head. \u201cNo. You cannot just show up in New York and expect me to help you after you left without a note! I swore off magic when my sister nearly found me out.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNightingale-\u201d</i></p><p><i><br>\u201cI am terrified!

This is my first time doing this.\u201d With one last glower, you dig the needle through his flesh, sewing it back together. The glowing orange weaves in and out of his skin like some piercing, the sparks sizzling and he groans through clenched teeth. You take deep breaths, trying to keep your hand steady as he keens over, panting.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHow did you even find me?\u201d you whisper, trying to distract him.

Sitting on your couch and watching the TV, you groan and close your eyes. All you wanted to do was get home from work and relax by watching the TV, maybe catch up on some reading. Instead, you\u2019re reminded that he\u2019s gone.</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, shut up!\u201d Your sister quietens from where she\u2019s doing her homework in the kitchen. \u201cIf you keep crying, I will cry. Do you want me to cry?\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d she says and you open your eyes again. Already they\u2019re burning and you blink to clear your vision. \u201cI miss Thor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss him, too, Parasite.\u201d You sigh. Of course you have to be an asshole to your little sister. \u201cSorry I yelled at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>Watching the TV again, you frown when breaking news cuts off whatever it was covering on Spider-Man. </p><p>The breaking news? Tony Stark has gone missing.</p><p>As footage plays of the man along with three others walking towards what appears to be aliens, you feel your gut flip. Grabbing the remote, you turn up the volume. </p><p><i>\u201cThe billionaire was last seen leaving the Earth\u2019s atmosphere in pursuit of the ship. It is unknown if he is still alive. Evacuations for anyone South of 43rd Street were ordered by Iron Man himself before he faced off against the two alien invaders.\u201d</i></p><p>You think you\u2019re going to be sick. </p><p>This is most definitely an Avengers kind of situation and if you know Thor, which you do, he\u2019ll be right in the thick of it. Grabbing your cane, you get up and walk to your sister. She can\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cHey, Parasite. Wanna have ice-cream for dinner?\u201d you ask, opening the freezer. Glancing over your shoulder, you see her nod dully and you sigh, stopping by her side. \u201cYou know what? Let\u2019s just skip school tomorrow. We can miss Thor together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Grateful that you can at least get a smile out of her, you turn back to the freezer. </p><p>\u201cNow what do you say about\u2026 neapolitan? Chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry. Plus, I can go and buy some sauces and sprinkles, if you\u2019d like.\u201d Bending over, you take out the tub of icecream you have and pause for your sister\u2019s answer. Setting it on the counter, you turn around to see your sister nowhere in sight. \u201cAlright, Parasite! I need your answer if you really want me to buy something to go on your ice cream.\u201d She must be somewhere trying to hide. With a sigh, you grab your cane.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d you call from where you stand. The fear that begins to rise in your throat has your heart beating everywhere in your heart. \u201cThis isn\u2019t funny. You know I do not like it when you hide. I am a cripple!\u201d Hearing her pencil roll and drop to the floor, you go and pick it up. A fine layer of dust covers your fingers and you frown. Everywhere on the chair, flecks of dust stain the chair in differing sizes. Huge black particles stick to your skin as you swallow, looking to the floor. Dragging your fingers through the fine layer of dust, you swear you can almost smell your sister\u2019s shampoo clinging to the ash.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no.\u201d Standing up, the air thickens and you can\u2019t breathe. You stumble away, staggering to the TV where you watch as the reporter\u2019s arms begin to crumble to dust. The woman screams, begging for help and you watch as sound men and producers try to keep her together. Cars crash outside and you look out the window to see driverless cars that have swerved into trees and poles and humans that are now trapped and are turning to dust too. </p><p><i>\u2018What is happening?\u2019 </i>Your eyes widen as you see a man who is running begin to dust. His legs go first, and then he falls to the floor in a <i>poof</i>, ceasing to exist. Trembling, you try to steady yourself as you touch your face, noting that you\u2019re still here. Letting your cane fall, you turn around to make sure your whole body is intact. You shiver.</p><p>You\u2019ve never felt so cold before. Hugging yourself with one arm, you reach down to grab your cane only for your hand to disintegrate right before your eyes. Choking, the weight of your injured leg disappears and you fall to a knee, reaching with your one hand left to hold onto the one thing Thor has ever given you. The cane.</p><p>The chattering of your teeth echoes in your skull and you feel as if someone is watching you, as if <i>you </i>are watching you leave your own body. </p><p><i>\u2018Oh, God.\u2019 </i>You whimper, sinking to the floor. Your eyes burn as you see the ashes of your own body flitter through the air. You can\u2019t breathe, you can\u2019t move, you can\u2019t - you don\u2019t understand how the more you disappear, the larger the clump in your throat gets until your breaths come ragged.</p><p>Gasping for air, your lungs scream at you, burning you from inside out as you try to hold on. The tears come, hot and racing as your other leg decays and you fall against the couch, your one arm holding onto that cane as the limb slowly crumbles into the same ash that litters your kitchen chair. </p><p>You think, if you hold onto your cane long enough, perhaps Thor will hear your prayers. Hear you begging for his help. Holding it close, you press your wet cheek against the polished wood and can imagine his fingers in your hair as he whispered that it\u2019ll be fine. </p><p>It most certainly is not fucking fine as you fucking disintegrate.</p><p>\u201cThor, please. All the times I asked you to be here, please be <i>here</i>,\u201d you whisper before your voice dies out. Your heart deflates in your chest, desperation panging in your core like a drum as you reach for your phone on the table before you. It\u2019s right next to your remote and-</p><p>Your fingers fall to the ground in a fine layer of ash and dust.</p><p>Arm trembling, you use your arm to knock your phone onto the ground. Leaning down, you use your nose and try to press the home button. The screen lights up and you\u2019re face to face with a picture of Thor and a kebab of fried scorpions. It was during your stay at the Kamar-Taj. Before it caused a smile that lasted for days, and now it only causes you to release a shuddering sob.</p><p>\u201cPlease. Thor. Show up, show up, show up,\u201d you whisper to yourself, sitting up and leaning against the couch. The cane rests against your chest and you keep your blurry vision on it. Your eyes trace the gold bands, the engravings on the handle, engravings you\u2019ve ran your finger over countless times. Engravings you wish <i>meant </i>something to him.</p><p><i>To my Nightingale, </i>it reads on one side.</p><p>With what\u2019s left of your arm, you clamp it between it and your chest, forehead resting against the wood.</p><p>\u201cShow up, please! Show up. Please, please, please, please come to me.\u201d</p><p>Maybe if you hold on long enough, it\u2019ll stop. It will stop, it will stop, it will stop. Your eyes shut and your jaw clenches as tears trace rivers from your red-rimmed eyes down your face. An ugly sound bursts from your throat just as orange blurs come into existence around you. They glow like tiny suns and their rays fight away the cold that had settled on you like a sheet of snow. Warm now, you swallow and open your eyes. Now you see they are orange orbs and in each one you can almost make out a shape. Still, that cannot distract you from holding on to your life. The life you want and the life that has Thor </p><p>Pulling your head back from the wood of your cane, you read the engraving on the other side, one that curbed the loneliness until it didn\u2019t, and instead caused it to multiply exponentially until you could no longer sleep without seeing his eyes and feeling his hair at your fingertips. Only now, it gives you the courage to fight whatever this is. Fight until he gets here. He will arrive soon enough.</p><p><i>I will always love you the way flowers love the sun, the way the sun loves the moon, and the way the moon loves the stars. I will always miss you and I will always know that an angel like you deserves the heaven I cannot give. I will love you like the bird who loves freedom, who is free to fly, but chooses to stay.</i></p><p>\u201cThor, I\u2019ve always asked you to stay.\u201d Your lips press against the engraving and you hiccough, trying to keep your voice steady but failing. \u201cPlease find me. Please, stay. Please, love me like you said you would. Thor, I\u2019ve let you go. Now, it\u2019s time for you to stay. Please, you-\u201d</p><p>The TV is left on loud. It nearly overpowers the sound of your cane clattering against the wood floor.</p><p><b>TAGS: </b><a>@teawithbucky</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGAnchA7bVQWLX-zuK7xlEA\" target=\"_blank\">@jcc04220</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msUr3307P6H3pHP96P5oVOA\" target=\"_blank\">@shenala</a></p>",

It is a terrible, terrible omen for what will be a terrible, terrible day. Still, a scowl graces your face as you freshen up as best as you can and then out to the hall. You manage to get down the stairs, which, in itself is a miracle that you didn\u2019t fall flat on your face, but also, the aching in your leg softens when you sit down on the couch.</p><p>You rest your leg up on the couch, too tired to get up. You stare into the kitchen, wondering where your sister is. Normally, she\u2019d be the one to wake you up by jumping on your bed and snuggling up to you. For a minute, panic seizes your throat, making you shoot up to call her name, but then you hear her obnoxious shouting out back and you lie down.</p><p><i>\u2018She\u2019s fine.\u2019</i> You grab the remote, thumb pausing over the power button.<i> \u2018But\u2026 I should check if she\u2019s wearing her boots. Motherfucker.\u2019 </i>Grabbing your cane, you swing your legs to the edge and push yourself up, limping to the back door. If she gets sick, then it\u2019ll most definitely be more crying, more whining, more work for you. Opening the door, the scent of petrichor immediately wafts to your nose and you smile slightly despite the intensifying cramp in your leg.</p><p>\u201cYo! Parasite!\u201d you yell, walking to the porch in your slippers and glaring distastefully at the drops that pour from the overhang of the roof. Immediately, your sister in her bright yellow boots and pink-as-hell jacket comes running into your view. She\u2019s soaked to the skin but at least she\u2019s wearing her hood. \u201cGet in here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorning!\u201d she exclaims, running to hug you but you immediately take a half-step back on your good leg. She pouts and you arch an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wet and disgusting. Go dry up and I\u2019ll make breakfast, okay?\u201d She smiles toothily and you pull her hood off, pushing her into the home. Turning to the yard again, you groan internally when you see her dinosaur stuffy out there covered in mud. Since you got it for her last birthday, she\u2019d been attached to the hip with it. You\u2019re half-surprised to see her go in without it, but that means that it\u2019s now dirtier than a sack of shit with stains you\u2019re not sure you can hand wash out.</p><p>Who needs a quarter anyway?<br><br>You make a mental note to visit the laundromat after work and gather your resolve to get it. Going back in to stuff your feet into boots, you trudge outside, the cane squelching in the dirt. The rain thunders around you but none touch your hair or your skin, which you expected it to. Suddenly, the motive to nearly run from your porch to the dinosaur and back leaves because your leg feels like it\u2019s about to need an amputation. Taking your time, you reach down and take it, pinching it between your fingers and getting back to the porch.</p><p>Looking up miraculously, you frown at how the rain seems to hit an invisible barrier high above you, sliding off and around you like a glass cylinder.</p><p>In a split second, you know exactly who\u2019s doing this.</p><p>Getting back inside, you throw the dino into the sink and run it under a stream of water, getting what you can off with a quick rinse. Sitting it on the counter to dry, you hear the door knock.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it!\u201d your sister yells, thundering down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d You walk over, eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat\u2019d I say about answering doors when I\u2019m here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Pushing her behind you, you open the door to see him.</p><p>He\u2019s trying his best not to stare, which you appreciate, but you hate him seeing you like this.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here, Thor?\u201d you ask quietly, letting him in. His blond hair tied up in a bun, he\u2019s trying his best to look like a normal human.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to see if you are okay.\u201d Although his words are caring, you can\u2019t help the anger that rises up within you, at your situation, at this man who has shown up at your door time and time again. Those code words. Every single time - it\u2019s never just a visit.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cWhy are you really here?\u201d you ask, voice colder. You\u2019re determined to push him away this time. You close the door and he sits down on the couch with a heavy sigh. Sensing that something\u2019s truly wrong, you tell your sister to go upstairs to finish washing up and walk around to sit beside him. When he turns around to see your sister\u2019s gone, he finally keens over and removes his hand from his abdomen, revealing a gross blood stain from a pulsating wound.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d You\u2019ve never seen it this bad. Darting up as fast as you can, you limp to the kitchen to grab scissors and bandages, a needle, towels and a cream from the last time. Sitting down, you push up his shirt as he lays back.</p><p>\u201cI went to the hospital. It stopped it for a while, but,\u201d he hisses as you snip the stitches that are trying to keep his skin together, \u201cit didn\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think I can help you? I told you I can\u2019t do this anymore. I\u2019m not that kind of doctor,\u201d you say but your actions betray your words. He takes a hold of your hands, blue eyes meeting yours earnestly. It pauses your work and you\u2019re forced to look at him. You swallow, the pain in your chest migrating to your throat and cinching it tight. Your jaw clenches and he cups your cheek, blood sticking.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d he whispers and you tear your eyes away to continue snipping away the stitches. It\u2019s a long cut, deep, and it\u2019s seven inches if you can hazard a guess, from his armpit and slicing diagonally down his side. \u201cI know I cannot ask you for anything-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did drop a building on me,\u201d you say and he grimaces. Placing the scissors down on the table, you soak up as much blood as you can, pressing hard against the cut despite Thor\u2019s groans.</p><p>\u201cAre we going to argue about Sokovia again?\u201d he whispers and you pull his hand away from your face and start squirting cream onto your hand to slather onto his wound. \u201cI told you that Ultron would\u2019ve-\u201d</p><p>\u201cReduced me to ash. I know. But Ultron already killed my parents,\u201d you say stiffly. \u201cThor, you gave me this house, among other things\u2014\u201d He blinks at how you avoid speaking of it, your time away\u2014 \u201cso I will always owe you a debt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said you\u2019re not that kind of doctor anymore,\u201d he says and you sigh, wiping your hands on another towel. Placing a fist against your other hand\u2019s palm, you draw out a long, thin, thread. It sparks, lighting up both of your faces as you continue drawing out until your arms can no longer stretch. Then you twist it around your wrist, staring at the ugly, oozing gash and estimating how much you\u2019d need.</p><p>\u201cIt helps when only one patient needs special care, not twenty,\u201d you murmur, guiding the Eldritch thread through the needle. \u201cStay still.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he whispers, eyes closing as his head drops back against the cushions. Your eyes trace over his face, and your heart aches for him. The debts have been repaid.</p><p>You know you only do this out of love.</p><p><b><i>\u2018Cause if I could see your face once more<br>I could die a happy man, I\u2019m sure</i></b></p><p>\u201cYou need rest. Whatever did this to you can wait another day,\u201d you whisper as he eases into your bed. </p><p>\u201cHow did you leave?\u201d he asks and you smile bitterly.\u00a0\u201cDo they know where you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly the Ancient One knows I\u2019m here. Her, and S.H.I.E.L.D. It is extraordinary what <i>explaining</i>\u00a0can do to sway someone\u2019s opinion.\u201d His eyes close and you make sure his bandages are not too tight before pulling his shirt back over the wound. Brushing his hair back from his face, you sigh. \u201cThor, I can\u2019t keep taking you in like this. Especially with my sister here. She asks questions every time\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d His words fill the empty silence only interrupted by your sister\u2019s footsteps on the creaking wood, running up and down the halls. \u201cI have missed you. I just needed to see you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get to miss me.\u201d The hand in your grasp clenches down and you place your other hand atop of his. \u201cBecause, to everyone else, you were never here.\u201d Despite your light words, his now-opened eyes read you like a preschooler\u2019s picture book. \u201cAnd you never <i>are </i>here. You got me a house, and a job, and I\u2019m grateful, but I wish I could have the man I love, too. I mean, you show up as soon as you need me, never before. You leave the next morning. That\u2019s no way for me to hold on to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen move on. I would never hold it against you,\u201d he breathes and you want to slap him. You would\u2019ve if he weren\u2019t so injured.</p><p>Laughing, you let go of his hand and stand. \u201cYou\u2019re an idiot.\u201d Taking your cane, you walk to the door and open it to see your sister zoom past you. When she notices your door\u2019s open, she stops before you, a truck in hand.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s Thor here? Is he going to leave, again?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see. You can say hi, but don\u2019t be too rough. He\u2019s hurt,\u201d you say and your sister barges in, climbing onto your bed. You watch as Thor sits up, though he needs to rest, an easy smile on his face as your sister talks animatedly to him. Thor\u2019s eyes light up and you sigh. When your sister starts making vroom noises with her truck, engrossed in her whole imaginary world, begging Thor to be part of it, you feel bile crawl up your throat.</p><p>You once begged Thor to be part of your world, too.</p><p><b><i>When you said your last goodbye<br></i></b><b><i>I died a little bit inside</i></b></p><p><i>As you check Thor\u2019s stitches, you know that he\u2019s fine. That he\u2019s well and healed. But his screams the night before echo in your head and you feel the urge to ask. You have lunch waiting but it can wait.</i></p><p><i>\u201cAre you\u2026 okay?\u201d you ask and his eyebrows raise in surprise. \u201cYou mutter about Infinity Stones in your sleep, and I was just wondering-\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI am fine, Nightingale.\u201d You bite your lip, dubious. \u201cI will stay another night, if you wish.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cI do wish, but the universe needs you, as always.\u201d Through your closed throat, you manage a smile as your eyes burn. \u201cWe\u2019ve had this conversation before, Thor.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI know. But perhaps you can come with me this time. I\u2026 I see fire in my dreams and I know where I must go.\u201d The feeling of flight in your chest has you nearly breathless but then you think of your sister, her wide eyes, who still believes in magic, who doesn\u2019t know her blood wields the very same magic she dreams of seeing. \u201cAre you needed at Kamar-Taj?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo.\u201d Not like you want to go back there. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 I go and leave the Parasite behind?\u201d you ask. She\u2019s at school. You\u2019ll need to pick her up in a few hours. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t do that. She hates our grandparents.\u201d Thor chuckles and the corner of your lip twitches up. \u201cYou can tell me, so I know you will be\u2026. Well, not safe, but I know where you will be. Even if I cannot be there.\u201d</i></p><p><i>His hands cup your face and the smell of cold electricity buzzes over his skin to yours, prickling at your cheek. \u201cThis will be the last time,\u201d he promises.</i></p><p><i>Your smile wavers. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the first time I have heard this.\u201d His hands fall away and you open the door. \u201cWell, you can go. You are my last patient before lunch.\u201d Limping away to the counter, you feel his hand fall away. Fiddling with popsicle sticks to make it seem like you\u2019re busy, you hear him shift on the exam table. Thor hops off the table and your hand stills.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou understand that it is my duty.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI understand well enough.\u201d Your voice is frigid and causes him to pause. \u201cBut every time you leave, I will never know if you will return.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNightingale, I-\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThor, just stay. Because I can\u2019t keep loving you like this.\u201d A weight drops in your gut as his blue eyes widen. You turn to him, hand on the knob. \u201cI am asking you to stay. And you know I am stubborn and that I do not bend easily, but I will for you. If you will </i>stay <i>for me</i>.\u201d\u00a0<i>Opening the door, you wait. He walks over to you, jaw set. He licks his lips and you know he wants to kiss you, but you turn your face away. You cannot love a man like this. \u201cPlease stay. Just stay.\u201d There is silence and you know his answer.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI love you,\u201d he says. His hand cups your cheek, wiping away the tears you refused to acknowledge.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI know,\u201d you say as your hand covers his, \u201cbut that is not enough.\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>I lay in tears in bed all night<br></i></b><b><i>Alone without you by my side</i></b></p><p>Lying down on the couch, you stare up at the ceiling. Upstairs, Thor rests and you glance at the analog clock you had plugged in earlier that night. You have twenty-three minutes before you have to get up and check his wound. For some reason, it still bleeds and the stitching loosens, meaning you have to cut the old thread and suture his skin back together again.</p><p>Your mind searches for the cause. Books litter the coffee table with mythological tomes on different creatures and spells, but you know they\u2019re all useless. Groaning, you sit up and prepare yourself for the long trek up the stairs.</p><p>Your lungs are hollow and you wonder if this cracking abyss will widen or close when he leaves. It\u2019s always hard to tell when he\u2019s near. The tears come before you realize. They flow down the corners of your eyes, nestling near your ears and you don\u2019t bother to wipe them away. There\u2019s no more fight left. </p><p>When you check the clock again, you know it\u2019s time for you to get up. Get up, get your shit together, get up those stairs.</p><p>So you do. And, although your eyes glance over the Sling Ring resting near your cane, you know it\u2019s best to limit how much magic you use. Your sister can never know what you can do. Your sister will want you to be a superhero. You don\u2019t know if you have the strength to try. Besides, your sister will lose the life she has now. She\u2019d have to live with her grandparents.</p><p>\u2018She doesn\u2019t want that,\u2019 you tell yourself as your cane stomps against the creaking wound. It pushes you up to the top and you make your way to your room. Opening the door, you perch on the end of the bed. Moonlight is streaming in through the curtains and you watch the rain fall, dashing against your windows.</p><p>\u201cNightingale?\u201d a hoarse voice calls and you turn your attention to the waking man. \u201cIs it time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Gently pulling up his shirt, you unwrap the bandages until you see the wound. It\u2019s healing better, clotting well. Grabbing a pair of gloves, you slap them on and touch the area around it, making sure it\u2019s holding together. \u201cYou\u2019re healing better. That\u2019s good. It\u2019s good.\u201d Your voice dies as he tries to sit up. \u201cNo, don\u2019t. You need to stay still. It just started getting better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you use whatever sorcery you use for this to heal your leg?\u201d He\u2019s asked this question before. You don\u2019t have the heart to give him the answer.</p><p><b><i>But if you loved me, why\u2019d you leave me?<br>Take my body, take my body</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cCan you tell us your name?\u201d they ask in English and you blink against the bright lights. They\u2019re testing your pupil response, to see if you have any brain damage. So you\u2019re in a hospital. That\u2019s good.</i></p><p><i>\u201c(Y/N) (L/N). I\u2019m a doctor,\u201d you rasp. Your English is rusty and your voice is hoarse, which doesn\u2019t make for a flattering sound, \u201cand if I am not mistaken, this is\u2026 not Novi Grad\u2019s General Hospital.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re right. What year is it?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201c2015.\u201d You try to sit up and a nurse helps with pillows underneath your back as you continue to blink. A straw is poked at your lips and you sip in water that runs down your throat silkily. \u201cWhere am I?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat\u2019s the last thing you remember?\u201d</i></p><p><i>You\u2019re paralyzed. You are as you stare up, watching your world crumble around you. Shielding your sister beneath your body, you sob into her hair, watching as slabs of your home crush your parents bodies to dust. The snap of their bones echoes in your ears like a sick symphony. Curling into a ball, you hold your sister\u2019s head to you, knowing you can\u2019t move. </i></p><p><i>\u201cCome on!\u201d The voice is rough, accented, and when you look up, you see a man in a red cape and long blond hair. His blue eyes anchor you to the fact that part of your home city is floating in mid air because of some crazy robot.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cI can\u2019t!\u201d you scream and he glances around with a grimace before running in. \u201cTake my sister. Please. Make sure she is safe,\u201d you whisper to whomever is listening. Your sister screams when the floor trembles under his footsteps and you wonder if you\u2019ll fall through the three floors beneath you of the apartment building you live in. Still, he sees your sister\u2019s bright red shirt and scoops her up first. You thank the ones listening that the Avenger has taken her first just as the ceiling roared in protest. A slab of concrete is just about to fall on you but he swings his hammer, demolishing it. The debris scatters around you, flying into the cracks on the floor. The wood moans, weakening at the edges.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHold on to me,\u201d he mutters in your ear just as the world falls out beneath your feet. Screaming, you swipe blindly in front of you to grab his arm but your fingers barely snag. </i></p><p><i>There will never be such a feeling as free-falling through three stories, watching the dust and metal and glass and wood all fall beside you and you realize that you are them as much as they are you. They were the building blocks that made your apartment a home, just as you are. Just as you were.</i></p><p><i>The ground comes too fast and the only thing you hear is the sound of your bones breaking like a cacophony of snares. </i></p><p><i>The darkness that hits you is faster than any flood.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI fell,\u201d you say in the present. \u201cDuring Novi Grad, I fell from my apartment building. Three stories.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou had a subdural hematoma. You were extracted immediately and brought here where you were operated on.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cJust one operation?\u201d you ask and now you realize why your head feels stomped in.</i></p><p><i>\u201cA craniotomy for your subdural hematoma, and you insisted on keeping your leg so the orthopedic surgeon placed fixators and more titanium than any other patient in this hospital in your leg to keep it straight from foot to femur. The shock had travelled up your leg. Oblique foot fractures, open tibial and fibula fractures, and a comminuted femur fracture.\u201d Your eyes drift to where you leg is encased in a metal cage to prevent movement. It\u2019s wrapped in a cast, completely immovable.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI see,\u201d you manage to say. You\u2019re well aware of the beeping of your monitors. A nurse goes to your leads, a needle poised but the doctor holds up a hand. Taking a deep breath, you nod. \u201cKeep going.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou needed a partial splenectomy and one of your kidneys was removed. Besides that, you\u2019re very lucky to have survived.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAnd my sister?\u201d The doctor pauses, lips pressing together. \u201cIs she okay? One of them took her. The blond one, red cape, has a hammer-\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cShe\u2019s been waiting for you to wake up with the Avenger for over three days now,\u201d the doctor says and you blink. \u201cI don\u2019t recommend seeing her, but if you are up for it-\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI am.\u201d Nodding, the doctor turns to the nurse who goes to the door. \u201cDoctor?\u201d the surgeon turns to you once more and you look at your leg blankly. \u201cI will not be able to walk properly again, will I?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo. Not unless you amputate.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo. It is - I need my leg. I want to keep it,\u201d you say and the doctor hums. \u201cI have been told I\u2019m stubborn.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou are. Even when you\u2019re delirious.\u201d The doctor writes something down in your chart before going to your I.V. and checking the levels. </i></p><p><i>\u201cYou could have overridden my decision, declared me unfit to make medical decisions. Why did you listen to me?\u201d Your eyes drift slowly over to the doctor who smiles. </i></p><p><i>\u201cThe choice to make is always yours,\u201d he says and when your sister and the Avenger enters the room, the doctor turns to leave. You swear you can hear the slight creak in his leg as he walks away.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re okay!\u201d your sister cries in your mother tongue, climbing onto your bed and snuggling into your side. The Avenger has a soft expression written into his mouth and eyes. \u201cMommy and Daddy aren\u2019t here yet. I don\u2019t know if they know we\u2019re here.\u201d Your heart skids to a stop and you try to redirect the flow of conversation before you burst into tears. You feel them catch in your throat, bruising and tight as you struggle to speak.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhere is here? Exactly?\u201d you ask to the Avenger.</i></p><p><i>\u201cNew York Presbyterian Hospital,\u201d the Avenger says and your eyes lock onto his. \u201cI am Thor Odinson.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You are wary of the him, his tall stature, but he exudes easiness so you relax against the pillows, holding your sister to you. There\u2019s a long scratch on your sister\u2019s arm that\u2019s stitched up well. You hadn\u2019t noticed it before. \u201cI know that.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAnd once you\u2019re out of the hospital, I had Tony Stark grant you a new home and job waiting for you as soon as you\u2019re able.\u201d Your mouth drops open and he smiles half-heartedly. \u201cIt\u2019s the least I could do. I did drop a building on you.\u201d You smile, exhaling softly as your sister buries her face to your side. </i></p><p><i>\u201cDid you do this for every Sokovian you nearly killed or am I special?\u201d you ask.</i></p><p><i>\u201cA nightingale is always special,\u201d is his answer. \u201cI heard you were a doctor.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI am a doctor,\u201d you respond stiffly and he sits on the edge of your bed, far away as if he is not sure you want him close. He saved your sister and she\u2019s the only family you have left. That\u2019s enough for you. \u201cWhy did that robot try to lift Sokovia out of the sky?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Thor shifts in his seat and you frown.</i></p><p><i>\u201cBecause he wanted peace in our time.\u201d You nod and Thor sighs. \u201cHe wanted peace by killing everyone.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOh. That sounds stupid,\u201d you say and Thor chuckles. It\u2019s a curious sound, one that warms your chest. \u201cThank you, for saving my sister.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIf you need anything, I\u2019m a call away.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI am in your debt,\u201d you point out but he shakes his head, standing up.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt was your home that I destroyed. Let me make it up to you.\u201d You smile as he leaves. The next morning, there is a postcard with a picture of a brown bird with a white belly - a nightingale. Your sister reads it out to you, and by the end of it all, the sobs that want to macerate your heart as you think of your dead parents come.</i></p><p><i>Attached to the back of the postcard are two wedding rings, taped securely to the white cardstock. You imagine Thor digging through the casualties, trying to find the two he only had a glance of. </i></p><p><i>You tell your sister then that you are orphans. She slips your mother\u2019s finger onto her thumb and your father\u2019s finger onto yours.</i></p><p><i>You know you owe the Avenger more than you can ever say.</i></p><p><b><i>All I want is, and all I need is<br></i></b><b><i>To find somebody, I\u2019ll find somebody</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cSo, you ended your relationship with Dr. Foster?\u201d you ask and Thor nods. \u201cWhy?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cBecause she needed to concentrate on work and it didn\u2019t seem to work anymore.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cBut you love her. That doesn\u2019t make sense. You can make it work.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cJane was tired of my disappearances. She wished to move on and she no longer wanted to make it work, and I suppose I saw it coming. There is a certain way she acted around me, as if she were guilty. In the end, I\u2026 I let her go.\u201d He picks at his fruit cup he had taken from your tray of food and you grimace. \u201cThis is disgusting. How dare they serve this to healing patients?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYeah, I would not eat it if I were dying.\u201d Smiling, though it appears worn at the edges, he sets down the cup and extends a hand. Taking it, you sit up and he helps with your pillows. Your leg cramps and you suck in a breath.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIs it your leg?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYes.\u201d His hand rests in yours still and you look down at it. He draws his hand away. \u201cThank you for taking my sister to school. I know you have other things to do.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI think I\u2019ve found a lead on one of the Infinity Stones. It\u2019s the least I could do as a farewell before I go for who knows how long.\u201d You nod and he offers a slight smile.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhich one do you think it is?\u201d Ever since Thor had taken to visiting you, you\u2019ve been lending an ear to his dreams and adventures. You barely think it\u2019s crazy when a robot almost leveled\u00a0a city by lifting up a piece of the earth into the sky.</i></p><p><i>\u201cPerhaps the Time Stone. And it\u2019s on Earth. Do you want to come?\u201d You frown at his offer and the smile fades. \u201cYour sister can come, too. I assure you, it\u2019s all paid for.\u201d You look out the window and sigh, looking at the Avengers Tower.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI need to get out of here,\u201d you breathe and the smile that splits his face is the sun in all its glory. \u201cWhen can we go?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAs soon as you\u2019re released from the hospital,\u201d he promises and you feel the smile tugging at your stubborn lips until you beam at the blond before you. \u201cI\u2019ll take you to somewhere called Kamar-Taj. That\u2019s where I think it is.\u201d Nodding, you wet your lips, unable to contain your smile.</i></p><p><i>\u201cOkay.\u201d You fiddle with the ring around your thumb before piping up again, \u201cThor?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYes?\u201d He\u2019s moved on to the cookie which is, unanimously, better than the fruit cup. When he sees you looking, he sets it down. \u201cSorry, do you want the cookie?\u201d You simply smile and extend a hand for him to take. He does, thumb running over your knuckles.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI am sorry, about Jane.\u201d His smile is the the sun on a cloudy day. \u201cI wish it were different.\u201d</i></p><p><i>He nods, turning to your cookie before chancing a glance at you. You give him a nod and he takes it, unwrapping it from its plastic and ripping off a piece to pop into his mouth. \u201cThank you, Nightingale.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d you say.</i></p><p><b><i>Like you, oh, oh, oh</i></b></p><p><i>The knocking makes you start awake and you feel your back cramping the fuck up. Pushing yourself up, you groan when Thor shifts, murmuring to himself under his breath. Sighing, you spare him a glance before getting up and looking at the clock. Only forty-seven minutes of sleep. Fantastic. When the God of Thunder himself shows up on your doorstep bleeding and needing a place to crash, it always means sleepless nights for you.</i></p><p><i>Taking your cane, you walk down the stairs and wipe at the dried spit near your mouth. Might as well look less-monstrous while you still can.</i></p><p><i>Once you reach the bottom, you open the door.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat?\u201d you snap before the scowl drops off your face. \u201cOh, shit.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWe had a consult this morning. You overslept.\u201d Groaning, you let Stephen in as you wipe at your eyes. \u201cWhere\u2019s the kid?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cStill sleeping, probably. She had a late night. So did I and wait - Stephen, how did you even find where I live?\u201d The surgeon sat down on her couch, spreading out C.T. and M.R.I scans. Knowing you have no way of making him leave, you sigh. \u201cWhat was the consult again?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cPatient came in two days ago at 11:29 PM.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cRight. Uh, let me see.\u201d Sitting down beside him, you take out the echo. \u201cCan you go over the patient history again?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThirty-four year old female. Presented with exertional chest pain. She came into the E.R. after she fell and had a seizure. Brain tumour. Her family has a family history of coronary artery disease.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cLife style?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cActive, stressful.\u201d You inspect the echocardiogram, eyes straining. You need some coffee. \u201cCardio said it showed normal sinus rhythm with no ST, or T changes.\u201d Nodding, you switch to the C.T.s and M.R.I.s. You whistle at the size of the tumour. </i></p><p><i>\u201cYou are going to operate on the tumour?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cObviously.\u201d Rolling your eyes, you take out the labs. \u201cThe only thing I can\u2019t figure out is the chest pain.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cSo you\u2019ve come to me for help,\u201d you remark. \u201cPass me the labs.\u201d The scans are exchanged for the sheets of paper and you read down the list. \u201cComplete blood picture, comprehensive metabolic panel, three sets of cardiac enzymes. All normal.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cDo you see why I\u2019ve come here now? She needs a cure. Now.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cRun a sixty-four cardiac computed tomography angiography.\u201d Setting down the labs back onto the folder, you turn to your colleague. \u201cIt could be anomalous coronaries. So, get a high volume study to rule it out. Call me for the results. You know, it could be an AVM.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cGreat.\u201d Stephen stood up and from his bag, took out a travelling mug you had left at the hospital a few months before. You\u2019d never gather the courage to take it since Stephen had taken to choosing spots for consults. \u201cYou never took it back.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThanks,\u201d you mutter dryly, delighted to find it filled. \u201cIs this coffee?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m not a completely terrible person.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAh, but you are to Dr. Palmer,\u201d you say, taking your cane and pushing yourself up. \u201cDon\u2019t you have patients to see to, Dr. Strange?\u201d Stephen was about to respond when there was a clutter. Your thoughts instantly zeroed in on something happened to Thor and you leave your mug on the table to limp as quick as you can to the staircase. Climbing the stairs, you\u2019re well aware of Stephen following after you as you open the door to your room.</i></p><p><i>On the floor, is Thor.</i></p><p><i>Releasing a sigh of relief, you get in and help him sit up to lean against the bed. Crouching, you lift his shirt and check to see if his wound has reopened.</i></p><p><i>\u201cSorry,\u201d Thor whispers and you offer a strained smile. Stephen crouches down as well, frowning. He inspects Thor\u2019s pupil response\u00a0with a torch he keeps in his pocket and touches the head, testing for any shifts in the bones.</i></p><p><i>\u201cDidn\u2019t know your house was a clinic. You might want to keep it more sanitary, if it is,\u201d he commented as he worked. Checking on the wound on the other side of Thor, you send your colleague a glare.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d you retort as the two of you help Thor back into bed. \u201cAre you okay? Did you hit your head?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo, I\u2019m okay.\u201d Thor\u2019s eyes dart between Stephen and you. \u201cWho is he?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cA colleague. It\u2019s fine. Come on, back to sleep,\u201d you say. Thor sends a reluctant glance at you but you ignore it, pulling the covers up. \u201cI\u2019ll check in on you in a bit, alright?\u201d The blond sets his jaw and glances at the shelves that line your walls. \u201cFine. Read a book. Just, rest, okay?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cFine. If you need me-\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo, if </i>you <i>need </i>me<i>, you call. Or get my sister. Scream if you have to.\u201d Stephen helps you back to your feet, handing you your cane and you sigh, closing the door behind you two.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHe\u2019s your boyfriend?\u201d the neurosurgeon asks and you shoot him a glare. \u201cI\u2019m just saying what I\u2019m reading.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHe\u2019s a patient,\u201d you say and Stephen smirks, not saying a thing. He gathers his files and you are this close to kicking him out the door to get his cocky smile out of your face when he walks out. Groaning to yourself, you climb back up the stairs and slip into your room. Thor\u2019s reading something on the history of medicine and you smile. That was the first book you had him read when you first met him.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIs he your boyfriend?\u201d he asks without looking up and you look to the sky, wondering why you had to be in this kind of parallel universe. Maybe it\u2019s \u2018cause some God thinks it\u2019s funny. If you have to choose, you\u2019d think it\u2019d be Loki, who Thor had told you many fond stories of.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHe\u2019s a colleague,\u201d you say and Thor narrows his eyes. You let your cane drop against the floor as you sit down on the bed with a huff. \u201cHe\u2019s a friend,\u201d you admit. \u201cHe\u2019s a surgeon and came for a consult. I missed it this morning.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI see.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThor-\u201d</i></p><p><i><br>\u201cIf he makes you happy, then I have no qualms about it.\u201d Rolling your eyes, you bite your tongue and brush hair away from his face.</i></p><p><i>\u201cGet some rest. I can convince you when you are not in danger of bleeding to death.\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>Like you, like you</i></b></p><p>\u201cThank you, Stan,\u201d you say to the mailman. He smiles at you and does a two-finger salute before heading back down to the sidewalk. Closing the door, you sort through the mail and toss the junk into the trash before heading up. You\u2019ll read them before bed tonight. Walking into your room after a knock on the open door, you see Thor staring out the window. He must\u2019ve heard your conversation with Stan.</p><p>\u201cStan, hm?\u201d he says without tearing his eyes away from the window. Again with this crap. Tossing the letters you need onto a table, you sit on the edge of the bed.</p><p>\u201cThor. Brush your teeth and stop pouting.\u201d He gazes at you, shocked, and you arch an eyebrow. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t going to sleep, then clean yourself up.\u201d Pushing off the covers, he scoots to the other side of the bed and gets up slowly. Following after him, you sigh. He\u2019s leaning over the sink and you lean against the door frame, crossing your arms. Since he\u2019s got a toothbrush in his mouth, you take it as an opportunity to speak.</p><p>\u201cThe reason I do not use magic to heal my leg is because it is one of the only reminders I have of you, of what we have and of my parents and of this chapter in my life.\u201d The toothbrush pauses for a moment, and then continues. \u201cMy leg\u2026 is my penance for all the things I didn\u2019t do. And now I cherish my sister far more than I did before, I love my job and I am grateful to save lives when I couldn\u2019t save my parents. I love you far more than I would\u2019ve without this. And without it, I wouldn\u2019t have loved you at all.\u201d</p><p>He rinses out his mouth and you smile.</p><p>\u201cWhen you are gone and I miss you, and it rains far harder than it should, I think of you. My leg cramps and it hurts far more than it should, and I still think of you. Any other day, I am fine. It\u2019s just those rainy days. I look at my cane, and I think of how lucky I am to experience the kind of love you have brought me, and how cursed I must be to see you leave every time.\u201d</p><p>He stares ahead to the mirror and you take in his side profile. His hair\u2019s tied up in a bun, courtesy of you, but a few tendrils still frame his face. \u201cWhen I see birds, I think of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I can live without you, right?\u201d you say and he turns to pin you with those freezing cold eyes. Eyes that remind you of a summer day and a thunderstorm. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to. That is why I ask you to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he says, letting the toothbrush clatter in the glass cup. \u201cBut you know it\u2019s not healthy\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. That does not stop me from wanting you.\u201d You turn to leave. \u201cLunch will be ready in an hour.\u201d </p><p><b><i>So you brought out the best of me<br></i></b><b><i>A part of me I\u2019d never seen</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cI asked Stark to pay for your rent and S.H.I.E.L.D. has agents monitoring your sister at all times,\u201d Thor tells you for the thirtieth time as the two of you migrate through the busy street.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThor, do you even know where we\u2019re going?\u201d you ask, stumbling after him. You\u2019ll never get used to this cane, but you can at least admire it\u2019s wood finishing and gold embellishments. Just another thing you have to thank Thor for.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI have a rough estimate,\u201d he says and you laugh as he holds onto your hand, making sure he doesn\u2019t lose you. You\u2019ve never been outside your home country and all this, the new sights and sounds and languages, has your eyes constantly open, trying to soak it all in. \u201cCome on, down this alley.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWait, I need to breathe,\u201d you wheeze and he pulls you in before you\u2019re run over by a bike. Chest to chest, the two of you laugh until your lungs ache, foreheads pressed against each other. Eyes closing, you let your head drop until it rests against his chest. \u201cI\u2019ve never been out of my country before. This is all very new,\u201d you say and he smiles, cupping your face. \u201cI am glad I got to experience it with you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAnd I you, Nightingale.\u201d The smile hurts but it\u2019s all worth it as you take in a deep breath. All the delicious stalls full of fresh food and spices has your head light as Thor takes a step back. \u201cCome on. We need to be there before nightfall.\u201d Nodding, you walk after him, through the crowd. You can\u2019t recall the last time you\u2019ve felt so energized, so daring and high on adrenaline. Exhilaration pumping in your veins, you wish you could run so you could fully experience what is Kathmandu.</i></p><p><b><i>You took my soul and wiped it clean</i></b></p><p><i>Once you get there, you\u2019re introduced to a woman. She pours you tea while others rid them of your cloaks. The cup is warm in your hands, strangely seeping into your blood and spreading throughout your body.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>The Ancient One, they call her. The others, a dark-skinned man named Mordo, and another with long hair and only one hand named Hamir stand by but only Hamir is dismissed. The smell of incense is heady and the light filters dustily into the room. Sipping, you\u2019re delighted at the sweet tea that\u2019s mellow yet fragrant.</i><br></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re here for the Stone, are you not?\u201d she asks and you look to Thor. His lips press together as he nods. \u201cBut you are not.\u201d The Ancient One\u2019s eyes land on yours and you nearly drop your porcelain cup. \u201cDo you need more honey with your tea?\u201d Glancing down at the golden liquid, you shake your head. </i></p><p><i>\u201cI am only here to make sure it is kept safe. There is a danger looming ahead, and they will seek the Stone.\u201d The Ancient One smiles serenely, looking to Mordo. \u201cIs it true you keep the Time Stone here?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cMordo, take the Avenger to the Eye of Agamotto.\u201d The man nods, gesturing for the blond to follow. When you go too, you are stopped. \u201cI must speak to you.\u201d Thor is reluctant to leave you but you give him a nod, saying it\u2019s okay as you turn to the Ancient One.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d you ask warily, taking a step back when she holds the kettle to you.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s only tea.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI do not need tea. How did you know I did not come for the Stone?\u201d you ask and the woman smiles that smile again. It mystifies you.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI know you came here for him. But I also know you search for purpose, Doctor.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWe are the Masters of The Mystic Arts.\u201d You arch an eyebrow.</i></p><p><i>\u201cLike magic?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cLike a science,\u201d she corrects, setting the kettle down. \u201cSit.\u201d You slump down on the floor, crossing a leg underneath your injured one. She sits in front of you, cross-legged. \u201cI know you wish to heal those you cannot. You wish you could have saved your parents.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI do.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou are not very ambitious, are you?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAmbition causes mistakes,\u201d you say. \u201cI became a doctor to help those who needed it.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat if I told you there was a way?\u201d As she speaks, orange light carves the air into geometric shapes. Your eyes fixate on the glowing, orange sparks emitted from lines that seem to burn into the air and you reach out a hand to touch.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThen I\u2019d say teach me,\u201d you manage to whisper before the air is stolen from your lungs. Seeing is believing but your mind cannot come up with a scientific explanation of this. \u201cWhat is this? Can you teach me?\u201d The Ancient One smiles.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIf you are willing to listen.\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>Our love was made for movie screens</i></b></p><p><i>Thor tries to visit you every day.</i></p><p><i>Some days he looks tired, other days not so. You go home every day to your sister who goes to school a week later.</i></p><p><i>Your life seems to have purpose for the first time in a long while and you show him your Sling Ring and how you can imagine the top of Cairns rock at sunrise. It\u2019s one of your favourite places to be, now that you can travel almost anywhere in the world.</i></p><p><i>As the orange sparks flitter down to the ground, tracing a circle, you smile at him. \u201cCome with me.\u201d With that, the portal opens to reveal the flat of the red-brown rock and you step through. He follows after you, watching the sun bleed into the sky. Purple and orange tangle together as the golden rays of the sun shadow the clouds. The stars are retreating with the inky night and you sit down with a exhausated smile.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt is beautiful here. I thought I would never love a sunrise more than I did in Sokovia, but here, everything is so clear.\u201d Turning to Thor who still stands, you pat the spot beside you and he sits down as well. \u201cThank you, for bringing me to Kamar-Taj.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt was my pleasure, Nightingale,\u201d he says and you smile. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I have been absent as of late.\u201d You shrug. You\u2019ve been busy too, being a student again. It\u2019s refreshing to learn more than you ever thought possible. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you.\u201d<br><br>\u201cAnd I you,\u201d you whisper. \u201cThe Parasite has something she wants to give you, when you get the chance to visit her.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI wanted to see you first.\u201d Touched, you lean against him. The energy leeched from your bones, you barely keep your eyes open for the sunrise. His lips press against your hair and you sink farther against him until you lay against him like a sack of flour. The sunrise bathes both of you in gold and you look up at him. His eyes glow tenderly and he leans down to press his lips against yours. Eyes widening, you don\u2019t move for a split second and then you realize, that this is truly happening.</i></p><p><i>With all that\u2019s going on, you find it hilarious that this is the thing that surprises you the most. So you let yourself go with the flow. You throw an arm around his neck, holding him against you. Eyes closed, you savour in his smell of sweat and cold electricity and the ecstasy of his plush mouth until you must breathe for air. Curling up against him, you smile against his lips as he pecks the corner of your mouth.</i></p><p><i>\u201cTo tide you over until I see you next,\u201d he murmurs and you hug him close. You don\u2019t want to let him go. \u201cI promise to be back as soon as I am able, Nightingale.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cSee to it that it\u2019s sooner rather than later,\u201d you whisper. Drawing back, he smiles and kisses you chastely on the lips.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI promise.\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>But if you loved me, why\u2019d you leave me?<br></i></b><b><i>Take my body, take my body</i></b></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time for you to go to school.

And (Y/N) gets sad without you.\u201d Thor\u2019s eyes lift up to meet yours and you shrug. Stepping forward, you hear the bus outside honk.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Parasite. You\u2019ve gotta go to school.\u201d Crouching down, you adjust your sister\u2019s coat and force a smile. \u201cBe good for me, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She hugs your neck and you pat her back before pulling her away. \u201cBye, Thor.\u201d Your sister looks like she\u2019s about to cry and honestly, you feel the same ever since Thor told you where he\u2019ll be going next. The two of you watch her leave before turning to each other. He closes the door and immediately your lips crash against each other. The steps you take back have you pinned against the wall as his hands cradle your face. The cane clatters to the floor as you gasp against his mouth. Your arms loop around his neck, eyes closing as he kisses you like you are the oxygen he needs. Lightning surges through your veins, your hair on end as the electricity dances over your skin.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d His breath fans over your cheek as your noses brush. \u201cAnd I promise I will try to be safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo promises you can\u2019t keep,\u201d you whisper and he kisses your lips softly, slowly. Pulling away, you continue against his persistent mouth that searches for kisses you are willing to give, \u201cI won\u2019t be there to help you, and I need to know you will be safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re not angry?\u201d murmurs the God, pulling back a fraction of an inch.</p><p>\u201cI will always be angry that you leave. And I will <i>always </i>be angry that you come back when I think I have gotten over you, but I will always love you.\u201d He smiles, bittersweet, and your hand curls against the back of his neck, bringing him back down. \u201cFor now, stay until you must leave.\u201d </p><p>He kisses you as if you are the water he needs in the desert, the fire he needs in the winter, and he kisses you as if you are the sweetest wine he will ever taste.</p><p><b><i>All I want is, and all I need is<br></i></b><b><i>To find somebody, I\u2019ll find somebody</i></b></p><p><i>\u201cWhat do you mean he\u2019s gone?\u201d you ask the Ancient One from where you are meditating. \u201cHe always comes back. Of course he\u2019s gone. Then, he comes back.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHe wished for me to tell you that he can no longer stay away from his duties, even if it means he must sacrifice you.\u201d Your leg seizes and you lean forward, fingers digging into the wood beneath you. The taste of bile, bitter and acidic floods your tongue and push yourself up onto your knees. The Ancient One stands before you with that serene expression of hers. \u201cHe has responsibilities that are more important than a single being.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI know,\u201d you say and you hate that you understand. \u201cBut so do I.\u201d The Ancient One frowns at your flat voice. Your decision may be hasty but it is made. And you are stubborn as they come. \u201cI am a doctor, and although I have not mastered all there is to learn, I cannot stay here while innocent people are dying.\u201d </i>\u2018He just left without even telling me,\u2019<i> is what you really want to say. Your heart wilts in your chest and you swallow the knot in your throat.</i></p><p><i>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Rising to your feet, you turn around so your mentor does not see you cry.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI realize now that the only thing keeping me here was him. He brought me here, and this was where he could find me. If he thinks so little of me that he doesn\u2019t even give me a proper goodbye, neither will I.\u201d The Ancient One sighs and you whirl around. \u201cYou think that this is the wrong thing to do?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI think nothing of it. I assure you. But if you truly want to forget him, perhaps you should use what you have learned.\u201d Her eyes divert to your leg and you shake your head. Pulling off your Sling Ring, you try to hand it to the Ancient One but she merely shakes her head. \u201cNo. In case you need it.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIs that allowed?\u201d The Ancient One merely smiles and turns away, leaving you to your thoughts. And the more you think, the more you wish your mind would quiet for it is a thunderstorm within your head.</i></p><p><i>Mordo is the one who sends you off with a hug and a wish good luck. \u201cYou use your skills for good,\u201d he warns and you smile.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI will. I am a doctor, after all.\u201d Smiling, you take your cane and limp down the alley to the building where your sister is. You tell the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent outside your door that you need a flight back to New York City and prepare yourself to tell your sister that you\u2019re moving yet again, and that Thor is gone.</i></p><p><i>When Tony Stark arrives in a jet to come pick you up personally, he shrugs and says, \u201cThor was fond of you. Fond enough to have you on S.H.I.E.L.D surveillance and make sure you\u2019ve got a trust fund for both you and your sister.\u201d</i></p><p><i>You blink. You never knew that. Tony Stark then adds, \u201cWell, not the trust fund. He just said make sure you\u2019re financially stable so you don\u2019t die homeless. The trust fund was all me. And I got you a job. You\u2019ll work at a clinic that\u2019s in close association with Metro-General hospital.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThank you, Mr. Stark.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cMake it Tony.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Nodding to yourself, you board the jet and sit beside Mr. Stark who talks the whole way.

Travel to Muspelheim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he whispers against your neck and you squirm. \u201cThe doctor would be good for you. He seems smart, a bit arrogant but you like the arrogant type.\u201d You turn to glare at him before realizing what he\u2019s doing. He\u2019s trying to make his departure easier on your soul, as he\u2019s always attempted to do.</p><p>\u201cYou know telling me to move on won\u2019t help it hurt less,\u201d you tell him, kissing his swollen mouth. He sighs, carding his fingers through your hair. \u201cBesides, I haven\u2019t heard from him since his car crash. He was in an accident and has gone missing ever since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s terrible. How about the mailman?\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>So</i>, this Muspelheim\u2026\u201d He frowns at your diversion but allows it all the same. \u201cThat is the realm of fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the fire in my dreams that have shown me an image of Surtur. I see my home, purged by fire and I have realized that perhaps Ragnar\u00f6k is coming sooner than expected.\u201d Your legs tangle in his, skin against skin as your fingers trace the veins along his arms.</p><p>\u201cI have a sense of what that is like, to see your home crumble,\u201d you murmur and he holds you to his chest. You are a comma to his body, curling against him as your words ghost against his collarbones. \u201cIf it is your home you see destroyed, then you really must go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only wish I could take you with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could go.\u201d His arms tighten around you and you feel your heart in your throat as your hand flattens against his back and your index finger traces circles against his skin. \u201cBut you need to go alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will in five minutes.\u201d His eyes close. You tilt your head up at him, the warmth within you ebbing and flowing from your chest to your fingertips like a warm fire within you. \u201cLet me have five more minutes with you.\u201d You close your eyes as he hugs you tight, knowing that when you wake up, he will be gone.</p><p><i><b>But if you loved me, why\u2019d you leave me?<br></b></i><i><b>Take my body, take my body</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s not closing!\u201d you whisper as Thor uses his hands to hold his flesh together. \u201cWhat caused this?

I went to the hospital and they gave me their strongest suture. It will not hold.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThen what can I do?\u201d you ask and your eyes meet his. He is focused, assured, and you shake your head. \u201cNo. You cannot just show up in New York and expect me to help you after you left without a note! I swore off magic when my sister nearly found me out.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNightingale-\u201d</i></p><p><i><br>\u201cI am terrified!

This is my first time doing this.\u201d With one last glower, you dig the needle through his flesh, sewing it back together. The glowing orange weaves in and out of his skin like some piercing, the sparks sizzling and he groans through clenched teeth. You take deep breaths, trying to keep your hand steady as he keens over, panting.</i></p><p><i>\u201cHow did you even find me?\u201d you whisper, trying to distract him. His eyes flash up to yours and you smile.</i></p><p><i>\u201cStark.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOf course.\u201d Ever since your return, he\u2019s been funding your clinic.

Sitting on your couch and watching the TV, you groan and close your eyes. All you wanted to do was get home from work and relax by watching the TV, maybe catch up on some reading. Instead, you\u2019re reminded that he\u2019s gone.</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, shut up!\u201d Your sister quietens from where she\u2019s doing her homework in the kitchen. \u201cIf you keep crying, I will cry. Do you want me to cry?\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d she says and you open your eyes again. Already they\u2019re burning and you blink to clear your vision. \u201cI miss Thor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss him, too, Parasite.\u201d You sigh. Of course you have to be an asshole to your little sister. \u201cSorry I yelled at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>Watching the TV again, you frown when breaking news cuts off whatever it was covering on Spider-Man. </p><p>The breaking news? Tony Stark has gone missing.</p><p>As footage plays of the man along with three others walking towards what appears to be aliens, you feel your gut flip. Grabbing the remote, you turn up the volume. </p><p><i>\u201cThe billionaire was last seen leaving the Earth\u2019s atmosphere in pursuit of the ship. It is unknown if he is still alive. Evacuations for anyone South of 43rd Street were ordered by Iron Man himself before he faced off against the two alien invaders.\u201d</i></p><p>You think you\u2019re going to be sick. </p><p>This is most definitely an Avengers kind of situation and if you know Thor, which you do, he\u2019ll be right in the thick of it. Grabbing your cane, you get up and walk to your sister. She can\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cHey, Parasite. Wanna have ice-cream for dinner?\u201d you ask, opening the freezer. Glancing over your shoulder, you see her nod dully and you sigh, stopping by her side. \u201cYou know what? Let\u2019s just skip school tomorrow. We can miss Thor together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Grateful that you can at least get a smile out of her, you turn back to the freezer. </p><p>\u201cNow what do you say about\u2026 neapolitan? Chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry. Plus, I can go and buy some sauces and sprinkles, if you\u2019d like.\u201d Bending over, you take out the tub of icecream you have and pause for your sister\u2019s answer. Setting it on the counter, you turn around to see your sister nowhere in sight. \u201cAlright, Parasite! I need your answer if you really want me to buy something to go on your ice cream.\u201d She must be somewhere trying to hide. With a sigh, you grab your cane.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d you call from where you stand. The fear that begins to rise in your throat has your heart beating everywhere in your heart. \u201cThis isn\u2019t funny. You know I do not like it when you hide. I am a cripple!\u201d Hearing her pencil roll and drop to the floor, you go and pick it up. A fine layer of dust covers your fingers and you frown. Everywhere on the chair, flecks of dust stain the chair in differing sizes. Huge black particles stick to your skin as you swallow, looking to the floor. Dragging your fingers through the fine layer of dust, you swear you can almost smell your sister\u2019s shampoo clinging to the ash.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no.\u201d Standing up, the air thickens and you can\u2019t breathe. You stumble away, staggering to the TV where you watch as the reporter\u2019s arms begin to crumble to dust. The woman screams, begging for help and you watch as sound men and producers try to keep her together. Cars crash outside and you look out the window to see driverless cars that have swerved into trees and poles and humans that are now trapped and are turning to dust too. </p><p><i>\u2018What is happening?\u2019 </i>Your eyes widen as you see a man who is running begin to dust. His legs go first, and then he falls to the floor in a <i>poof</i>, ceasing to exist. Trembling, you try to steady yourself as you touch your face, noting that you\u2019re still here. Letting your cane fall, you turn around to make sure your whole body is intact. You shiver.</p><p>You\u2019ve never felt so cold before. Hugging yourself with one arm, you reach down to grab your cane only for your hand to disintegrate right before your eyes. Choking, the weight of your injured leg disappears and you fall to a knee, reaching with your one hand left to hold onto the one thing Thor has ever given you. The cane.</p><p>The chattering of your teeth echoes in your skull and you feel as if someone is watching you, as if <i>you </i>are watching you leave your own body. </p><p><i>\u2018Oh, God.\u2019 </i>You whimper, sinking to the floor. Your eyes burn as you see the ashes of your own body flitter through the air. You can\u2019t breathe, you can\u2019t move, you can\u2019t - you don\u2019t understand how the more you disappear, the larger the clump in your throat gets until your breaths come ragged.</p><p>Gasping for air, your lungs scream at you, burning you from inside out as you try to hold on. The tears come, hot and racing as your other leg decays and you fall against the couch, your one arm holding onto that cane as the limb slowly crumbles into the same ash that litters your kitchen chair. </p><p>You think, if you hold onto your cane long enough, perhaps Thor will hear your prayers. Hear you begging for his help. Holding it close, you press your wet cheek against the polished wood and can imagine his fingers in your hair as he whispered that it\u2019ll be fine. </p><p>It most certainly is not fucking fine as you fucking disintegrate.</p><p>\u201cThor, please. All the times I asked you to be here, please be <i>here</i>,\u201d you whisper before your voice dies out. Your heart deflates in your chest, desperation panging in your core like a drum as you reach for your phone on the table before you. It\u2019s right next to your remote and-</p><p>Your fingers fall to the ground in a fine layer of ash and dust.</p><p>Arm trembling, you use your arm to knock your phone onto the ground. Leaning down, you use your nose and try to press the home button. The screen lights up and you\u2019re face to face with a picture of Thor and a kebab of fried scorpions. It was during your stay at the Kamar-Taj. Before it caused a smile that lasted for days, and now it only causes you to release a shuddering sob.</p><p>\u201cPlease. Thor. Show up, show up, show up,\u201d you whisper to yourself, sitting up and leaning against the couch. The cane rests against your chest and you keep your blurry vision on it. Your eyes trace the gold bands, the engravings on the handle, engravings you\u2019ve ran your finger over countless times. Engravings you wish <i>meant </i>something to him.</p><p><i>To my Nightingale, </i>it reads on one side.</p><p>With what\u2019s left of your arm, you clamp it between it and your chest, forehead resting against the wood.</p><p>\u201cShow up, please! Show up. Please, please, please, please come to me.\u201d</p><p>Maybe if you hold on long enough, it\u2019ll stop. It will stop, it will stop, it will stop. Your eyes shut and your jaw clenches as tears trace rivers from your red-rimmed eyes down your face. An ugly sound bursts from your throat just as orange blurs come into existence around you. They glow like tiny suns and their rays fight away the cold that had settled on you like a sheet of snow. Warm now, you swallow and open your eyes. Now you see they are orange orbs and in each one you can almost make out a shape. Still, that cannot distract you from holding on to your life. The life you want and the life that has Thor </p><p>Pulling your head back from the wood of your cane, you read the engraving on the other side, one that curbed the loneliness until it didn\u2019t, and instead caused it to multiply exponentially until you could no longer sleep without seeing his eyes and feeling his hair at your fingertips. Only now, it gives you the courage to fight whatever this is. Fight until he gets here. He will arrive soon enough.</p><p><i>I will always love you the way flowers love the sun, the way the sun loves the moon, and the way the moon loves the stars. I will always miss you and I will always know that an angel like you deserves the heaven I cannot give. I will love you like the bird who loves freedom, who is free to fly, but chooses to stay.</i></p><p>\u201cThor, I\u2019ve always asked you to stay.\u201d Your lips press against the engraving and you hiccough, trying to keep your voice steady but failing. \u201cPlease find me. Please, stay. Please, love me like you said you would. Thor, I\u2019ve let you go. Now, it\u2019s time for you to stay. Please, you-\u201d</p><p>The TV is left on loud. It nearly overpowers the sound of your cane clattering against the wood floor.</p><p><b>TAGS: </b><a>@teawithbucky</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGAnchA7bVQWLX-zuK7xlEA\" target=\"_blank\">@jcc04220</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msUr3307P6H3pHP96P5oVOA\" target=\"_blank\">@shenala</a></p>",

It is a terrible, terrible omen for what will be a terrible, terrible day. Still, a scowl graces your face as you freshen up as best as you can and then out to the hall. You manage to get down the stairs, which, in itself is a miracle that you didn&rsquo;t fall flat on your face, but also, the aching in your leg softens when you sit down on the couch.</p><p>You rest your leg up on the couch, too tired to get up. You stare into the kitchen, wondering where your sister is. Normally, she&rsquo;d be the one to wake you up by jumping on your bed and snuggling up to you. For a minute, panic seizes your throat, making you shoot up to call her name, but then you hear her obnoxious shouting out back and you lie down.</p><p><i>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s fine.&rsquo;</i> You grab the remote, thumb pausing over the power button.<i> &lsquo;But&hellip; I should check if she&rsquo;s wearing her boots. Motherfucker.&rsquo; </i>Grabbing your cane, you swing your legs to the edge and push yourself up, limping to the back door. If she gets sick, then it&rsquo;ll most definitely be more crying, more whining, more work for you. Opening the door, the scent of petrichor immediately wafts to your nose and you smile slightly despite the intensifying cramp in your leg.</p><p>&ldquo;Yo! Parasite!&rdquo; you yell, walking to the porch in your slippers and glaring distastefully at the drops that pour from the overhang of the roof. Immediately, your sister in her bright yellow boots and pink-as-hell jacket comes running into your view. She&rsquo;s soaked to the skin but at least she&rsquo;s wearing her hood. &ldquo;Get in here!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Morning!&rdquo; she exclaims, running to hug you but you immediately take a half-step back on your good leg. She pouts and you arch an eyebrow.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wet and disgusting. Go dry up and I&rsquo;ll make breakfast, okay?&rdquo; She smiles toothily and you pull her hood off, pushing her into the home. Turning to the yard again, you groan internally when you see her dinosaur stuffy out there covered in mud. Since you got it for her last birthday, she&rsquo;d been attached to the hip with it. You&rsquo;re half-surprised to see her go in without it, but that means that it&rsquo;s now dirtier than a sack of shit with stains you&rsquo;re not sure you can hand wash out.</p><p>Who needs a quarter anyway?<br /><br />You make a mental note to visit the laundromat after work and gather your resolve to get it. Going back in to stuff your feet into boots, you trudge outside, the cane squelching in the dirt. The rain thunders around you but none touch your hair or your skin, which you expected it to. Suddenly, the motive to nearly run from your porch to the dinosaur and back leaves because your leg feels like it&rsquo;s about to need an amputation. Taking your time, you reach down and take it, pinching it between your fingers and getting back to the porch.</p><p>Looking up miraculously, you frown at how the rain seems to hit an invisible barrier high above you, sliding off and around you like a glass cylinder.</p><p>In a split second, you know exactly who&rsquo;s doing this.</p><p>Getting back inside, you throw the dino into the sink and run it under a stream of water, getting what you can off with a quick rinse. Sitting it on the counter to dry, you hear the door knock.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get it!&rdquo; your sister yells, thundering down the stairs.</p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; You walk over, eyes narrowed. &ldquo;What&rsquo;d I say about answering doors when I&rsquo;m here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo; Pushing her behind you, you open the door to see him.</p><p>He&rsquo;s trying his best not to stare, which you appreciate, but you hate him seeing you like this.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing here, Thor?&rdquo; you ask quietly, letting him in. His blond hair tied up in a bun, he&rsquo;s trying his best to look like a normal human.</p><p>&ldquo;I wanted to see if you are okay.&rdquo; Although his words are caring, you can&rsquo;t help the anger that rises up within you, at your situation, at this man who has shown up at your door time and time again. Those code words. Every single time - it&rsquo;s never just a visit.</p><p>&ldquo;Why are you really here?&rdquo; you ask, voice colder. You&rsquo;re determined to push him away this time. You close the door and he sits down on the couch with a heavy sigh. Sensing that something&rsquo;s truly wrong, you tell your sister to go upstairs to finish washing up and walk around to sit beside him. When he turns around to see your sister&rsquo;s gone, he finally keens over and removes his hand from his abdomen, revealing a gross blood stain from a pulsating wound.</p><p>&ldquo;What the hell?&rdquo; You&rsquo;ve never seen it this bad. Darting up as fast as you can, you limp to the kitchen to grab scissors and bandages, a needle, towels and a cream from the last time. Sitting down, you push up his shirt as he lays back.</p><p>&ldquo;I went to the hospital. It stopped it for a while, but,&rdquo; he hisses as you snip the stitches that are trying to keep his skin together, &ldquo;it didn&rsquo;t work.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What makes you think I can help you? I told you I can&rsquo;t do this anymore. I&rsquo;m not that kind of doctor,&rdquo; you say but your actions betray your words. He takes a hold of your hands, blue eyes meeting yours earnestly. It pauses your work and you&rsquo;re forced to look at him. You swallow, the pain in your chest migrating to your throat and cinching it tight. Your jaw clenches and he cups your cheek, blood sticking.</p><p>&ldquo;Please,&rdquo; he whispers and you tear your eyes away to continue snipping away the stitches. It&rsquo;s a long cut, deep, and it&rsquo;s seven inches if you can hazard a guess, from his armpit and slicing diagonally down his side. &ldquo;I know I cannot ask you for anything-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You did drop a building on me,&rdquo; you say and he grimaces. Placing the scissors down on the table, you soak up as much blood as you can, pressing hard against the cut despite Thor&rsquo;s groans.</p><p>&ldquo;Are we going to argue about Sokovia again?&rdquo; he whispers and you pull his hand away from your face and start squirting cream onto your hand to slather onto his wound. &ldquo;I told you that Ultron would&rsquo;ve-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Reduced me to ash. I know. But Ultron already killed my parents,&rdquo; you say stiffly. &ldquo;Thor, you gave me this house, among other things&mdash;&rdquo; He blinks at how you avoid speaking of it, your time away&mdash; &ldquo;so I will always owe you a debt.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you said you&rsquo;re not that kind of doctor anymore,&rdquo; he says and you sigh, wiping your hands on another towel. Placing a fist against your other hand&rsquo;s palm, you draw out a long, thin, thread. It sparks, lighting up both of your faces as you continue drawing out until your arms can no longer stretch. Then you twist it around your wrist, staring at the ugly, oozing gash and estimating how much you&rsquo;d need.</p><p>&ldquo;It helps when only one patient needs special care, not twenty,&rdquo; you murmur, guiding the Eldritch thread through the needle. &ldquo;Stay still.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he whispers, eyes closing as his head drops back against the cushions. Your eyes trace over his face, and your heart aches for him. The debts have been repaid.</p><p>You know you only do this out of love.</p><p><b><i>&lsquo;Cause if I could see your face once more<br />I could die a happy man, I&rsquo;m sure</i></b></p><p>&ldquo;You need rest. Whatever did this to you can wait another day,&rdquo; you whisper as he eases into your bed. </p><p>&ldquo;How did you leave?&rdquo; he asks and you smile bitterly.&nbsp;&ldquo;Do they know where you are?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Only the Ancient One knows I&rsquo;m here. Her, and S.H.I.E.L.D. It is extraordinary what <i>explaining</i>&nbsp;can do to sway someone&rsquo;s opinion.&rdquo; His eyes close and you make sure his bandages are not too tight before pulling his shirt back over the wound. Brushing his hair back from his face, you sigh. &ldquo;Thor, I can&rsquo;t keep taking you in like this. Especially with my sister here. She asks questions every time&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; His words fill the empty silence only interrupted by your sister&rsquo;s footsteps on the creaking wood, running up and down the halls. &ldquo;I have missed you. I just needed to see you-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t get to miss me.&rdquo; The hand in your grasp clenches down and you place your other hand atop of his. &ldquo;Because, to everyone else, you were never here.&rdquo; Despite your light words, his now-opened eyes read you like a preschooler&rsquo;s picture book. &ldquo;And you never <i>are </i>here. You got me a house, and a job, and I&rsquo;m grateful, but I wish I could have the man I love, too. I mean, you show up as soon as you need me, never before. You leave the next morning. That&rsquo;s no way for me to hold on to you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then move on. I would never hold it against you,&rdquo; he breathes and you want to slap him. You would&rsquo;ve if he weren&rsquo;t so injured.</p><p>Laughing, you let go of his hand and stand. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re an idiot.&rdquo; Taking your cane, you walk to the door and open it to see your sister zoom past you. When she notices your door&rsquo;s open, she stops before you, a truck in hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Why&rsquo;s Thor here? Is he going to leave, again?&rdquo; she asks.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see. You can say hi, but don&rsquo;t be too rough. He&rsquo;s hurt,&rdquo; you say and your sister barges in, climbing onto your bed. You watch as Thor sits up, though he needs to rest, an easy smile on his face as your sister talks animatedly to him. Thor&rsquo;s eyes light up and you sigh. When your sister starts making vroom noises with her truck, engrossed in her whole imaginary world, begging Thor to be part of it, you feel bile crawl up your throat.</p><p>You once begged Thor to be part of your world, too.</p><p><b><i>When you said your last goodbye<br /></i></b><b><i>I died a little bit inside</i></b></p><p><i>As you check Thor&rsquo;s stitches, you know that he&rsquo;s fine. That he&rsquo;s well and healed. But his screams the night before echo in your head and you feel the urge to ask. You have lunch waiting but it can wait.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Are you&hellip; okay?&rdquo; you ask and his eyebrows raise in surprise. &ldquo;You mutter about Infinity Stones in your sleep, and I was just wondering-&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I am fine, Nightingale.&rdquo; You bite your lip, dubious. &ldquo;I will stay another night, if you wish.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I do wish, but the universe needs you, as always.&rdquo; Through your closed throat, you manage a smile as your eyes burn. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had this conversation before, Thor.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I know. But perhaps you can come with me this time. I&hellip; I see fire in my dreams and I know where I must go.&rdquo; The feeling of flight in your chest has you nearly breathless but then you think of your sister, her wide eyes, who still believes in magic, who doesn&rsquo;t know her blood wields the very same magic she dreams of seeing. &ldquo;Are you needed at Kamar-Taj?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Not like you want to go back there. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just&hellip; I go and leave the Parasite behind?&rdquo; you ask. She&rsquo;s at school. You&rsquo;ll need to pick her up in a few hours. &ldquo;You know I can&rsquo;t do that. She hates our grandparents.&rdquo; Thor chuckles and the corner of your lip twitches up. &ldquo;You can tell me, so I know you will be&hellip;. Well, not safe, but I know where you will be. Even if I cannot be there.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>His hands cup your face and the smell of cold electricity buzzes over his skin to yours, prickling at your cheek. &ldquo;This will be the last time,&rdquo; he promises.</i></p><p><i>Your smile wavers. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t the first time I have heard this.&rdquo; His hands fall away and you open the door. &ldquo;Well, you can go. You are my last patient before lunch.&rdquo; Limping away to the counter, you feel his hand fall away. Fiddling with popsicle sticks to make it seem like you&rsquo;re busy, you hear him shift on the exam table. Thor hops off the table and your hand stills.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You understand that it is my duty.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I understand well enough.&rdquo; Your voice is frigid and causes him to pause. &ldquo;But every time you leave, I will never know if you will return.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Nightingale, I-&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Thor, just stay. Because I can&rsquo;t keep loving you like this.&rdquo; A weight drops in your gut as his blue eyes widen. You turn to him, hand on the knob. &ldquo;I am asking you to stay. And you know I am stubborn and that I do not bend easily, but I will for you. If you will </i>stay <i>for me</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;<i>Opening the door, you wait. He walks over to you, jaw set. He licks his lips and you know he wants to kiss you, but you turn your face away. You cannot love a man like this. &ldquo;Please stay. Just stay.&rdquo; There is silence and you know his answer.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; he says. His hand cups your cheek, wiping away the tears you refused to acknowledge.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; you say as your hand covers his, &ldquo;but that is not enough.&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>I lay in tears in bed all night<br /></i></b><b><i>Alone without you by my side</i></b></p><p>Lying down on the couch, you stare up at the ceiling. Upstairs, Thor rests and you glance at the analog clock you had plugged in earlier that night. You have twenty-three minutes before you have to get up and check his wound. For some reason, it still bleeds and the stitching loosens, meaning you have to cut the old thread and suture his skin back together again.</p><p>Your mind searches for the cause. Books litter the coffee table with mythological tomes on different creatures and spells, but you know they&rsquo;re all useless. Groaning, you sit up and prepare yourself for the long trek up the stairs.</p><p>Your lungs are hollow and you wonder if this cracking abyss will widen or close when he leaves. It&rsquo;s always hard to tell when he&rsquo;s near. The tears come before you realize. They flow down the corners of your eyes, nestling near your ears and you don&rsquo;t bother to wipe them away. There&rsquo;s no more fight left. </p><p>When you check the clock again, you know it&rsquo;s time for you to get up. Get up, get your shit together, get up those stairs.</p><p>So you do. And, although your eyes glance over the Sling Ring resting near your cane, you know it&rsquo;s best to limit how much magic you use. Your sister can never know what you can do. Your sister will want you to be a superhero. You don&rsquo;t know if you have the strength to try. Besides, your sister will lose the life she has now. She&rsquo;d have to live with her grandparents.</p><p>&lsquo;She doesn&rsquo;t want that,&rsquo; you tell yourself as your cane stomps against the creaking wound. It pushes you up to the top and you make your way to your room. Opening the door, you perch on the end of the bed. Moonlight is streaming in through the curtains and you watch the rain fall, dashing against your windows.</p><p>&ldquo;Nightingale?&rdquo; a hoarse voice calls and you turn your attention to the waking man. &ldquo;Is it time?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Gently pulling up his shirt, you unwrap the bandages until you see the wound. It&rsquo;s healing better, clotting well. Grabbing a pair of gloves, you slap them on and touch the area around it, making sure it&rsquo;s holding together. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re healing better. That&rsquo;s good. It&rsquo;s good.&rdquo; Your voice dies as he tries to sit up. &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t. You need to stay still. It just started getting better.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you use whatever sorcery you use for this to heal your leg?&rdquo; He&rsquo;s asked this question before. You don&rsquo;t have the heart to give him the answer.</p><p><b><i>But if you loved me, why&rsquo;d you leave me?<br />Take my body, take my body</i></b></p><p><i>&ldquo;Can you tell us your name?&rdquo; they ask in English and you blink against the bright lights. They&rsquo;re testing your pupil response, to see if you have any brain damage. So you&rsquo;re in a hospital. That&rsquo;s good.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;(Y/N) (L/N). I&rsquo;m a doctor,&rdquo; you rasp. Your English is rusty and your voice is hoarse, which doesn&rsquo;t make for a flattering sound, &ldquo;and if I am not mistaken, this is&hellip; not Novi Grad&rsquo;s General Hospital.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. What year is it?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;2015.&rdquo; You try to sit up and a nurse helps with pillows underneath your back as you continue to blink. A straw is poked at your lips and you sip in water that runs down your throat silkily. &ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the last thing you remember?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>You&rsquo;re paralyzed. You are as you stare up, watching your world crumble around you. Shielding your sister beneath your body, you sob into her hair, watching as slabs of your home crush your parents bodies to dust. The snap of their bones echoes in your ears like a sick symphony. Curling into a ball, you hold your sister&rsquo;s head to you, knowing you can&rsquo;t move. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; The voice is rough, accented, and when you look up, you see a man in a red cape and long blond hair. His blue eyes anchor you to the fact that part of your home city is floating in mid air because of some crazy robot.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; you scream and he glances around with a grimace before running in. &ldquo;Take my sister. Please. Make sure she is safe,&rdquo; you whisper to whomever is listening. Your sister screams when the floor trembles under his footsteps and you wonder if you&rsquo;ll fall through the three floors beneath you of the apartment building you live in. Still, he sees your sister&rsquo;s bright red shirt and scoops her up first. You thank the ones listening that the Avenger has taken her first just as the ceiling roared in protest. A slab of concrete is just about to fall on you but he swings his hammer, demolishing it. The debris scatters around you, flying into the cracks on the floor. The wood moans, weakening at the edges.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Hold on to me,&rdquo; he mutters in your ear just as the world falls out beneath your feet. Screaming, you swipe blindly in front of you to grab his arm but your fingers barely snag. </i></p><p><i>There will never be such a feeling as free-falling through three stories, watching the dust and metal and glass and wood all fall beside you and you realize that you are them as much as they are you. They were the building blocks that made your apartment a home, just as you are. Just as you were.</i></p><p><i>The ground comes too fast and the only thing you hear is the sound of your bones breaking like a cacophony of snares. </i></p><p><i>The darkness that hits you is faster than any flood.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I fell,&rdquo; you say in the present. &ldquo;During Novi Grad, I fell from my apartment building. Three stories.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You had a subdural hematoma. You were extracted immediately and brought here where you were operated on.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Just one operation?&rdquo; you ask and now you realize why your head feels stomped in.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;A craniotomy for your subdural hematoma, and you insisted on keeping your leg so the orthopedic surgeon placed fixators and more titanium than any other patient in this hospital in your leg to keep it straight from foot to femur. The shock had travelled up your leg. Oblique foot fractures, open tibial and fibula fractures, and a comminuted femur fracture.&rdquo; Your eyes drift to where you leg is encased in a metal cage to prevent movement. It&rsquo;s wrapped in a cast, completely immovable.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; you manage to say. You&rsquo;re well aware of the beeping of your monitors. A nurse goes to your leads, a needle poised but the doctor holds up a hand. Taking a deep breath, you nod. &ldquo;Keep going.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You needed a partial splenectomy and one of your kidneys was removed. Besides that, you&rsquo;re very lucky to have survived.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;And my sister?&rdquo; The doctor pauses, lips pressing together. &ldquo;Is she okay? One of them took her. The blond one, red cape, has a hammer-&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s been waiting for you to wake up with the Avenger for over three days now,&rdquo; the doctor says and you blink. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t recommend seeing her, but if you are up for it-&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I am.&rdquo; Nodding, the doctor turns to the nurse who goes to the door. &ldquo;Doctor?&rdquo; the surgeon turns to you once more and you look at your leg blankly. &ldquo;I will not be able to walk properly again, will I?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;No. Not unless you amputate.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;No. It is - I need my leg. I want to keep it,&rdquo; you say and the doctor hums. &ldquo;I have been told I&rsquo;m stubborn.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You are. Even when you&rsquo;re delirious.&rdquo; The doctor writes something down in your chart before going to your I.V. and checking the levels. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You could have overridden my decision, declared me unfit to make medical decisions. Why did you listen to me?&rdquo; Your eyes drift slowly over to the doctor who smiles. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;The choice to make is always yours,&rdquo; he says and when your sister and the Avenger enters the room, the doctor turns to leave. You swear you can hear the slight creak in his leg as he walks away.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re okay!&rdquo; your sister cries in your mother tongue, climbing onto your bed and snuggling into your side. The Avenger has a soft expression written into his mouth and eyes. &ldquo;Mommy and Daddy aren&rsquo;t here yet. I don&rsquo;t know if they know we&rsquo;re here.&rdquo; Your heart skids to a stop and you try to redirect the flow of conversation before you burst into tears. You feel them catch in your throat, bruising and tight as you struggle to speak.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Where is here? Exactly?&rdquo; you ask to the Avenger.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;New York Presbyterian Hospital,&rdquo; the Avenger says and your eyes lock onto his. &ldquo;I am Thor Odinson.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>You are wary of the him, his tall stature, but he exudes easiness so you relax against the pillows, holding your sister to you. There&rsquo;s a long scratch on your sister&rsquo;s arm that&rsquo;s stitched up well. You hadn&rsquo;t noticed it before. &ldquo;I know that.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;And once you&rsquo;re out of the hospital, I had Tony Stark grant you a new home and job waiting for you as soon as you&rsquo;re able.&rdquo; Your mouth drops open and he smiles half-heartedly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the least I could do. I did drop a building on you.&rdquo; You smile, exhaling softly as your sister buries her face to your side. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Did you do this for every Sokovian you nearly killed or am I special?&rdquo; you ask.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;A nightingale is always special,&rdquo; is his answer. &ldquo;I heard you were a doctor.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I am a doctor,&rdquo; you respond stiffly and he sits on the edge of your bed, far away as if he is not sure you want him close. He saved your sister and she&rsquo;s the only family you have left. That&rsquo;s enough for you. &ldquo;Why did that robot try to lift Sokovia out of the sky?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Thor shifts in his seat and you frown.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Because he wanted peace in our time.&rdquo; You nod and Thor sighs. &ldquo;He wanted peace by killing everyone.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Oh. That sounds stupid,&rdquo; you say and Thor chuckles. It&rsquo;s a curious sound, one that warms your chest. &ldquo;Thank you, for saving my sister.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;If you need anything, I&rsquo;m a call away.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I am in your debt,&rdquo; you point out but he shakes his head, standing up.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It was your home that I destroyed. Let me make it up to you.&rdquo; You smile as he leaves. The next morning, there is a postcard with a picture of a brown bird with a white belly - a nightingale. Your sister reads it out to you, and by the end of it all, the sobs that want to macerate your heart as you think of your dead parents come.</i></p><p><i>Attached to the back of the postcard are two wedding rings, taped securely to the white cardstock. You imagine Thor digging through the casualties, trying to find the two he only had a glance of. </i></p><p><i>You tell your sister then that you are orphans. She slips your mother&rsquo;s finger onto her thumb and your father&rsquo;s finger onto yours.</i></p><p><i>You know you owe the Avenger more than you can ever say.</i></p><p><b><i>All I want is, and all I need is<br /></i></b><b><i>To find somebody, I&rsquo;ll find somebody</i></b></p><p><i>&ldquo;So, you ended your relationship with Dr. Foster?&rdquo; you ask and Thor nods. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Because she needed to concentrate on work and it didn&rsquo;t seem to work anymore.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;But you love her. That doesn&rsquo;t make sense. You can make it work.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Jane was tired of my disappearances. She wished to move on and she no longer wanted to make it work, and I suppose I saw it coming. There is a certain way she acted around me, as if she were guilty. In the end, I&hellip; I let her go.&rdquo; He picks at his fruit cup he had taken from your tray of food and you grimace. &ldquo;This is disgusting. How dare they serve this to healing patients?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Yeah, I would not eat it if I were dying.&rdquo; Smiling, though it appears worn at the edges, he sets down the cup and extends a hand. Taking it, you sit up and he helps with your pillows. Your leg cramps and you suck in a breath.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Is it your leg?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; His hand rests in yours still and you look down at it. He draws his hand away. &ldquo;Thank you for taking my sister to school. I know you have other things to do.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve found a lead on one of the Infinity Stones. It&rsquo;s the least I could do as a farewell before I go for who knows how long.&rdquo; You nod and he offers a slight smile.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Which one do you think it is?&rdquo; Ever since Thor had taken to visiting you, you&rsquo;ve been lending an ear to his dreams and adventures. You barely think it&rsquo;s crazy when a robot almost leveled&nbsp;a city by lifting up a piece of the earth into the sky.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Perhaps the Time Stone. And it&rsquo;s on Earth. Do you want to come?&rdquo; You frown at his offer and the smile fades. &ldquo;Your sister can come, too. I assure you, it&rsquo;s all paid for.&rdquo; You look out the window and sigh, looking at the Avengers Tower.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I need to get out of here,&rdquo; you breathe and the smile that splits his face is the sun in all its glory. &ldquo;When can we go?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;As soon as you&rsquo;re released from the hospital,&rdquo; he promises and you feel the smile tugging at your stubborn lips until you beam at the blond before you. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you to somewhere called Kamar-Taj. That&rsquo;s where I think it is.&rdquo; Nodding, you wet your lips, unable to contain your smile.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; You fiddle with the ring around your thumb before piping up again, &ldquo;Thor?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; He&rsquo;s moved on to the cookie which is, unanimously, better than the fruit cup. When he sees you looking, he sets it down. &ldquo;Sorry, do you want the cookie?&rdquo; You simply smile and extend a hand for him to take. He does, thumb running over your knuckles.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I am sorry, about Jane.&rdquo; His smile is the the sun on a cloudy day. &ldquo;I wish it were different.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>He nods, turning to your cookie before chancing a glance at you. You give him a nod and he takes it, unwrapping it from its plastic and ripping off a piece to pop into his mouth. &ldquo;Thank you, Nightingale.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome,&rdquo; you say.</i></p><p><b><i>Like you, oh, oh, oh</i></b></p><p><i>The knocking makes you start awake and you feel your back cramping the fuck up. Pushing yourself up, you groan when Thor shifts, murmuring to himself under his breath. Sighing, you spare him a glance before getting up and looking at the clock. Only forty-seven minutes of sleep. Fantastic. When the God of Thunder himself shows up on your doorstep bleeding and needing a place to crash, it always means sleepless nights for you.</i></p><p><i>Taking your cane, you walk down the stairs and wipe at the dried spit near your mouth. Might as well look less-monstrous while you still can.</i></p><p><i>Once you reach the bottom, you open the door.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; you snap before the scowl drops off your face. &ldquo;Oh, shit.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;We had a consult this morning. You overslept.&rdquo; Groaning, you let Stephen in as you wipe at your eyes. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the kid?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Still sleeping, probably. She had a late night. So did I and wait - Stephen, how did you even find where I live?&rdquo; The surgeon sat down on her couch, spreading out C.T. and M.R.I scans. Knowing you have no way of making him leave, you sigh. &ldquo;What was the consult again?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Patient came in two days ago at 11:29 PM.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Right. Uh, let me see.&rdquo; Sitting down beside him, you take out the echo. &ldquo;Can you go over the patient history again?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Thirty-four year old female. Presented with exertional chest pain. She came into the E.R. after she fell and had a seizure. Brain tumour. Her family has a family history of coronary artery disease.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Life style?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Active, stressful.&rdquo; You inspect the echocardiogram, eyes straining. You need some coffee. &ldquo;Cardio said it showed normal sinus rhythm with no ST, or T changes.&rdquo; Nodding, you switch to the C.T.s and M.R.I.s. You whistle at the size of the tumour. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You are going to operate on the tumour?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Obviously.&rdquo; Rolling your eyes, you take out the labs. &ldquo;The only thing I can&rsquo;t figure out is the chest pain.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve come to me for help,&rdquo; you remark. &ldquo;Pass me the labs.&rdquo; The scans are exchanged for the sheets of paper and you read down the list. &ldquo;Complete blood picture, comprehensive metabolic panel, three sets of cardiac enzymes. All normal.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Do you see why I&rsquo;ve come here now? She needs a cure. Now.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Run a sixty-four cardiac computed tomography angiography.&rdquo; Setting down the labs back onto the folder, you turn to your colleague. &ldquo;It could be anomalous coronaries. So, get a high volume study to rule it out. Call me for the results. You know, it could be an AVM.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Great.&rdquo; Stephen stood up and from his bag, took out a travelling mug you had left at the hospital a few months before. You&rsquo;d never gather the courage to take it since Stephen had taken to choosing spots for consults. &ldquo;You never took it back.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; you mutter dryly, delighted to find it filled. &ldquo;Is this coffee?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a completely terrible person.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Ah, but you are to Dr. Palmer,&rdquo; you say, taking your cane and pushing yourself up. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you have patients to see to, Dr. Strange?&rdquo; Stephen was about to respond when there was a clutter. Your thoughts instantly zeroed in on something happened to Thor and you leave your mug on the table to limp as quick as you can to the staircase. Climbing the stairs, you&rsquo;re well aware of Stephen following after you as you open the door to your room.</i></p><p><i>On the floor, is Thor.</i></p><p><i>Releasing a sigh of relief, you get in and help him sit up to lean against the bed. Crouching, you lift his shirt and check to see if his wound has reopened.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; Thor whispers and you offer a strained smile. Stephen crouches down as well, frowning. He inspects Thor&rsquo;s pupil response&nbsp;with a torch he keeps in his pocket and touches the head, testing for any shifts in the bones.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t know your house was a clinic. You might want to keep it more sanitary, if it is,&rdquo; he commented as he worked. Checking on the wound on the other side of Thor, you send your colleague a glare.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not,&rdquo; you retort as the two of you help Thor back into bed. &ldquo;Are you okay? Did you hit your head?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m okay.&rdquo; Thor&rsquo;s eyes dart between Stephen and you. &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;A colleague. It&rsquo;s fine. Come on, back to sleep,&rdquo; you say. Thor sends a reluctant glance at you but you ignore it, pulling the covers up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll check in on you in a bit, alright?&rdquo; The blond sets his jaw and glances at the shelves that line your walls. &ldquo;Fine. Read a book. Just, rest, okay?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Fine. If you need me-&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;No, if </i>you <i>need </i>me<i>, you call. Or get my sister. Scream if you have to.&rdquo; Stephen helps you back to your feet, handing you your cane and you sigh, closing the door behind you two.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s your boyfriend?&rdquo; the neurosurgeon asks and you shoot him a glare. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just saying what I&rsquo;m reading.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a patient,&rdquo; you say and Stephen smirks, not saying a thing. He gathers his files and you are this close to kicking him out the door to get his cocky smile out of your face when he walks out. Groaning to yourself, you climb back up the stairs and slip into your room. Thor&rsquo;s reading something on the history of medicine and you smile. That was the first book you had him read when you first met him.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Is he your boyfriend?&rdquo; he asks without looking up and you look to the sky, wondering why you had to be in this kind of parallel universe. Maybe it&rsquo;s &lsquo;cause some God thinks it&rsquo;s funny. If you have to choose, you&rsquo;d think it&rsquo;d be Loki, who Thor had told you many fond stories of.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a colleague,&rdquo; you say and Thor narrows his eyes. You let your cane drop against the floor as you sit down on the bed with a huff. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a friend,&rdquo; you admit. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a surgeon and came for a consult. I missed it this morning.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Thor-&rdquo;</i></p><p><i><br />&ldquo;If he makes you happy, then I have no qualms about it.&rdquo; Rolling your eyes, you bite your tongue and brush hair away from his face.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Get some rest. I can convince you when you are not in danger of bleeding to death.&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>Like you, like you</i></b></p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Stan,&rdquo; you say to the mailman. He smiles at you and does a two-finger salute before heading back down to the sidewalk. Closing the door, you sort through the mail and toss the junk into the trash before heading up. You&rsquo;ll read them before bed tonight. Walking into your room after a knock on the open door, you see Thor staring out the window. He must&rsquo;ve heard your conversation with Stan.</p><p>&ldquo;Stan, hm?&rdquo; he says without tearing his eyes away from the window. Again with this crap. Tossing the letters you need onto a table, you sit on the edge of the bed.</p><p>&ldquo;Thor. Brush your teeth and stop pouting.&rdquo; He gazes at you, shocked, and you arch an eyebrow. &ldquo;If you aren&rsquo;t going to sleep, then clean yourself up.&rdquo; Pushing off the covers, he scoots to the other side of the bed and gets up slowly. Following after him, you sigh. He&rsquo;s leaning over the sink and you lean against the door frame, crossing your arms. Since he&rsquo;s got a toothbrush in his mouth, you take it as an opportunity to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;The reason I do not use magic to heal my leg is because it is one of the only reminders I have of you, of what we have and of my parents and of this chapter in my life.&rdquo; The toothbrush pauses for a moment, and then continues. &ldquo;My leg&hellip; is my penance for all the things I didn&rsquo;t do. And now I cherish my sister far more than I did before, I love my job and I am grateful to save lives when I couldn&rsquo;t save my parents. I love you far more than I would&rsquo;ve without this. And without it, I wouldn&rsquo;t have loved you at all.&rdquo;</p><p>He rinses out his mouth and you smile.</p><p>&ldquo;When you are gone and I miss you, and it rains far harder than it should, I think of you. My leg cramps and it hurts far more than it should, and I still think of you. Any other day, I am fine. It&rsquo;s just those rainy days. I look at my cane, and I think of how lucky I am to experience the kind of love you have brought me, and how cursed I must be to see you leave every time.&rdquo;</p><p>He stares ahead to the mirror and you take in his side profile. His hair&rsquo;s tied up in a bun, courtesy of you, but a few tendrils still frame his face. &ldquo;When I see birds, I think of you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You know I can live without you, right?&rdquo; you say and he turns to pin you with those freezing cold eyes. Eyes that remind you of a summer day and a thunderstorm. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want to. That is why I ask you to stay.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he says, letting the toothbrush clatter in the glass cup. &ldquo;But you know it&rsquo;s not healthy&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course. That does not stop me from wanting you.&rdquo; You turn to leave. &ldquo;Lunch will be ready in an hour.&rdquo; </p><p><b><i>So you brought out the best of me<br /></i></b><b><i>A part of me I&rsquo;d never seen</i></b></p><p><i>&ldquo;I asked Stark to pay for your rent and S.H.I.E.L.D. has agents monitoring your sister at all times,&rdquo; Thor tells you for the thirtieth time as the two of you migrate through the busy street.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Thor, do you even know where we&rsquo;re going?&rdquo; you ask, stumbling after him. You&rsquo;ll never get used to this cane, but you can at least admire it&rsquo;s wood finishing and gold embellishments. Just another thing you have to thank Thor for.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I have a rough estimate,&rdquo; he says and you laugh as he holds onto your hand, making sure he doesn&rsquo;t lose you. You&rsquo;ve never been outside your home country and all this, the new sights and sounds and languages, has your eyes constantly open, trying to soak it all in. &ldquo;Come on, down this alley.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Wait, I need to breathe,&rdquo; you wheeze and he pulls you in before you&rsquo;re run over by a bike. Chest to chest, the two of you laugh until your lungs ache, foreheads pressed against each other. Eyes closing, you let your head drop until it rests against his chest. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been out of my country before. This is all very new,&rdquo; you say and he smiles, cupping your face. &ldquo;I am glad I got to experience it with you.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;And I you, Nightingale.&rdquo; The smile hurts but it&rsquo;s all worth it as you take in a deep breath. All the delicious stalls full of fresh food and spices has your head light as Thor takes a step back. &ldquo;Come on. We need to be there before nightfall.&rdquo; Nodding, you walk after him, through the crowd. You can&rsquo;t recall the last time you&rsquo;ve felt so energized, so daring and high on adrenaline. Exhilaration pumping in your veins, you wish you could run so you could fully experience what is Kathmandu.</i></p><p><b><i>You took my soul and wiped it clean</i></b></p><p><i>Once you get there, you&rsquo;re introduced to a woman. She pours you tea while others rid them of your cloaks. The cup is warm in your hands, strangely seeping into your blood and spreading throughout your body.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>The Ancient One, they call her. The others, a dark-skinned man named Mordo, and another with long hair and only one hand named Hamir stand by but only Hamir is dismissed. The smell of incense is heady and the light filters dustily into the room. Sipping, you&rsquo;re delighted at the sweet tea that&rsquo;s mellow yet fragrant.</i><br /></p><p><i>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re here for the Stone, are you not?&rdquo; she asks and you look to Thor. His lips press together as he nods. &ldquo;But you are not.&rdquo; The Ancient One&rsquo;s eyes land on yours and you nearly drop your porcelain cup. &ldquo;Do you need more honey with your tea?&rdquo; Glancing down at the golden liquid, you shake your head. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I am only here to make sure it is kept safe. There is a danger looming ahead, and they will seek the Stone.&rdquo; The Ancient One smiles serenely, looking to Mordo. &ldquo;Is it true you keep the Time Stone here?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Mordo, take the Avenger to the Eye of Agamotto.&rdquo; The man nods, gesturing for the blond to follow. When you go too, you are stopped. &ldquo;I must speak to you.&rdquo; Thor is reluctant to leave you but you give him a nod, saying it&rsquo;s okay as you turn to the Ancient One.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What do you want from me?&rdquo; you ask warily, taking a step back when she holds the kettle to you.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only tea.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I do not need tea. How did you know I did not come for the Stone?&rdquo; you ask and the woman smiles that smile again. It mystifies you.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I know you came here for him. But I also know you search for purpose, Doctor.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;We are the Masters of The Mystic Arts.&rdquo; You arch an eyebrow.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Like magic?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Like a science,&rdquo; she corrects, setting the kettle down. &ldquo;Sit.&rdquo; You slump down on the floor, crossing a leg underneath your injured one. She sits in front of you, cross-legged. &ldquo;I know you wish to heal those you cannot. You wish you could have saved your parents.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You are not very ambitious, are you?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Ambition causes mistakes,&rdquo; you say. &ldquo;I became a doctor to help those who needed it.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What if I told you there was a way?&rdquo; As she speaks, orange light carves the air into geometric shapes. Your eyes fixate on the glowing, orange sparks emitted from lines that seem to burn into the air and you reach out a hand to touch.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;d say teach me,&rdquo; you manage to whisper before the air is stolen from your lungs. Seeing is believing but your mind cannot come up with a scientific explanation of this. &ldquo;What is this? Can you teach me?&rdquo; The Ancient One smiles.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;If you are willing to listen.&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>Our love was made for movie screens</i></b></p><p><i>Thor tries to visit you every day.</i></p><p><i>Some days he looks tired, other days not so. You go home every day to your sister who goes to school a week later.</i></p><p><i>Your life seems to have purpose for the first time in a long while and you show him your Sling Ring and how you can imagine the top of Cairns rock at sunrise. It&rsquo;s one of your favourite places to be, now that you can travel almost anywhere in the world.</i></p><p><i>As the orange sparks flitter down to the ground, tracing a circle, you smile at him. &ldquo;Come with me.&rdquo; With that, the portal opens to reveal the flat of the red-brown rock and you step through. He follows after you, watching the sun bleed into the sky. Purple and orange tangle together as the golden rays of the sun shadow the clouds. The stars are retreating with the inky night and you sit down with a exhausated smile.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It is beautiful here. I thought I would never love a sunrise more than I did in Sokovia, but here, everything is so clear.&rdquo; Turning to Thor who still stands, you pat the spot beside you and he sits down as well. &ldquo;Thank you, for bringing me to Kamar-Taj.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It was my pleasure, Nightingale,&rdquo; he says and you smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I have been absent as of late.&rdquo; You shrug. You&rsquo;ve been busy too, being a student again. It&rsquo;s refreshing to learn more than you ever thought possible. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve missed you.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;And I you,&rdquo; you whisper. &ldquo;The Parasite has something she wants to give you, when you get the chance to visit her.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I wanted to see you first.&rdquo; Touched, you lean against him. The energy leeched from your bones, you barely keep your eyes open for the sunrise. His lips press against your hair and you sink farther against him until you lay against him like a sack of flour. The sunrise bathes both of you in gold and you look up at him. His eyes glow tenderly and he leans down to press his lips against yours. Eyes widening, you don&rsquo;t move for a split second and then you realize, that this is truly happening.</i></p><p><i>With all that&rsquo;s going on, you find it hilarious that this is the thing that surprises you the most. So you let yourself go with the flow. You throw an arm around his neck, holding him against you. Eyes closed, you savour in his smell of sweat and cold electricity and the ecstasy of his plush mouth until you must breathe for air. Curling up against him, you smile against his lips as he pecks the corner of your mouth.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;To tide you over until I see you next,&rdquo; he murmurs and you hug him close. You don&rsquo;t want to let him go. &ldquo;I promise to be back as soon as I am able, Nightingale.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;See to it that it&rsquo;s sooner rather than later,&rdquo; you whisper. Drawing back, he smiles and kisses you chastely on the lips.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I promise.&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>But if you loved me, why&rsquo;d you leave me?<br /></i></b><b><i>Take my body, take my body</i></b></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time for you to go to school. Say bye to Thor,&rdquo; you tell your sister who waves to the man. &ldquo;He will not be here when you&rsquo;re back.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bye, Thor!&rdquo; Your sister runs to him, hugging onto his legs and you cross your arms, feeling the hollowness of his absence already creeping in. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll miss you! And (Y/N) gets sad without you.&rdquo; Thor&rsquo;s eyes lift up to meet yours and you shrug. Stepping forward, you hear the bus outside honk.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, Parasite. You&rsquo;ve gotta go to school.&rdquo; Crouching down, you adjust your sister&rsquo;s coat and force a smile. &ldquo;Be good for me, okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; She hugs your neck and you pat her back before pulling her away. &ldquo;Bye, Thor.&rdquo; Your sister looks like she&rsquo;s about to cry and honestly, you feel the same ever since Thor told you where he&rsquo;ll be going next. The two of you watch her leave before turning to each other. He closes the door and immediately your lips crash against each other. The steps you take back have you pinned against the wall as his hands cradle your face. The cane clatters to the floor as you gasp against his mouth. Your arms loop around his neck, eyes closing as he kisses you like you are the oxygen he needs. Lightning surges through your veins, your hair on end as the electricity dances over your skin.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you.&rdquo; His breath fans over your cheek as your noses brush. &ldquo;And I promise I will try to be safe.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No promises you can&rsquo;t keep,&rdquo; you whisper and he kisses your lips softly, slowly. Pulling away, you continue against his persistent mouth that searches for kisses you are willing to give, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be there to help you, and I need to know you will be safe.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re not angry?&rdquo; murmurs the God, pulling back a fraction of an inch.</p><p>&ldquo;I will always be angry that you leave. And I will <i>always </i>be angry that you come back when I think I have gotten over you, but I will always love you.&rdquo; He smiles, bittersweet, and your hand curls against the back of his neck, bringing him back down. &ldquo;For now, stay until you must leave.&rdquo; </p><p>He kisses you as if you are the water he needs in the desert, the fire he needs in the winter, and he kisses you as if you are the sweetest wine he will ever taste.</p><p><b><i>All I want is, and all I need is<br /></i></b><b><i>To find somebody, I&rsquo;ll find somebody</i></b></p><p><i>&ldquo;What do you mean he&rsquo;s gone?&rdquo; you ask the Ancient One from where you are meditating. &ldquo;He always comes back. Of course he&rsquo;s gone. Then, he comes back.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;He wished for me to tell you that he can no longer stay away from his duties, even if it means he must sacrifice you.&rdquo; Your leg seizes and you lean forward, fingers digging into the wood beneath you. The taste of bile, bitter and acidic floods your tongue and push yourself up onto your knees. The Ancient One stands before you with that serene expression of hers. &ldquo;He has responsibilities that are more important than a single being.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; you say and you hate that you understand. &ldquo;But so do I.&rdquo; The Ancient One frowns at your flat voice. Your decision may be hasty but it is made. And you are stubborn as they come. &ldquo;I am a doctor, and although I have not mastered all there is to learn, I cannot stay here while innocent people are dying.&rdquo; </i>&lsquo;He just left without even telling me,&rsquo;<i> is what you really want to say. Your heart wilts in your chest and you swallow the knot in your throat.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; Rising to your feet, you turn around so your mentor does not see you cry.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I realize now that the only thing keeping me here was him. He brought me here, and this was where he could find me. If he thinks so little of me that he doesn&rsquo;t even give me a proper goodbye, neither will I.&rdquo; The Ancient One sighs and you whirl around. &ldquo;You think that this is the wrong thing to do?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I think nothing of it. I assure you. But if you truly want to forget him, perhaps you should use what you have learned.&rdquo; Her eyes divert to your leg and you shake your head. Pulling off your Sling Ring, you try to hand it to the Ancient One but she merely shakes her head. &ldquo;No. In case you need it.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Is that allowed?&rdquo; The Ancient One merely smiles and turns away, leaving you to your thoughts. And the more you think, the more you wish your mind would quiet for it is a thunderstorm within your head.</i></p><p><i>Mordo is the one who sends you off with a hug and a wish good luck. &ldquo;You use your skills for good,&rdquo; he warns and you smile.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I will. I am a doctor, after all.&rdquo; Smiling, you take your cane and limp down the alley to the building where your sister is. You tell the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent outside your door that you need a flight back to New York City and prepare yourself to tell your sister that you&rsquo;re moving yet again, and that Thor is gone.</i></p><p><i>When Tony Stark arrives in a jet to come pick you up personally, he shrugs and says, &ldquo;Thor was fond of you. Fond enough to have you on S.H.I.E.L.D surveillance and make sure you&rsquo;ve got a trust fund for both you and your sister.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>You blink. You never knew that. Tony Stark then adds, &ldquo;Well, not the trust fund. He just said make sure you&rsquo;re financially stable so you don&rsquo;t die homeless. The trust fund was all me. And I got you a job. You&rsquo;ll work at a clinic that&rsquo;s in close association with Metro-General hospital.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Stark.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Make it Tony.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Nodding to yourself, you board the jet and sit beside Mr. Stark who talks the whole way. It&rsquo;s a welcome distraction from the cracks in your heart that you try to mend with makeshift tape and glue. </i></p><p><b><i>Oh, oh, oh, oh<br /></i></b><b><i>Oh, oh, oh, oh<br /></i></b><b><i>Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh</i></b></p><p>&ldquo;You really have to leave,&rdquo; you say to Thor as he kisses your bare shoulder. &ldquo;Save the world, and all that. Travel to Muspelheim.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he whispers against your neck and you squirm. &ldquo;The doctor would be good for you. He seems smart, a bit arrogant but you like the arrogant type.&rdquo; You turn to glare at him before realizing what he&rsquo;s doing. He&rsquo;s trying to make his departure easier on your soul, as he&rsquo;s always attempted to do.</p><p>&ldquo;You know telling me to move on won&rsquo;t help it hurt less,&rdquo; you tell him, kissing his swollen mouth. He sighs, carding his fingers through your hair. &ldquo;Besides, I haven&rsquo;t heard from him since his car crash. He was in an accident and has gone missing ever since.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s terrible. How about the mailman?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;<i>So</i>, this Muspelheim&hellip;&rdquo; He frowns at your diversion but allows it all the same. &ldquo;That is the realm of fire.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the fire in my dreams that have shown me an image of Surtur. I see my home, purged by fire and I have realized that perhaps Ragnar&ouml;k is coming sooner than expected.&rdquo; Your legs tangle in his, skin against skin as your fingers trace the veins along his arms.</p><p>&ldquo;I have a sense of what that is like, to see your home crumble,&rdquo; you murmur and he holds you to his chest. You are a comma to his body, curling against him as your words ghost against his collarbones. &ldquo;If it is your home you see destroyed, then you really must go.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I only wish I could take you with me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I wish I could go.&rdquo; His arms tighten around you and you feel your heart in your throat as your hand flattens against his back and your index finger traces circles against his skin. &ldquo;But you need to go alone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will in five minutes.&rdquo; His eyes close. You tilt your head up at him, the warmth within you ebbing and flowing from your chest to your fingertips like a warm fire within you. &ldquo;Let me have five more minutes with you.&rdquo; You close your eyes as he hugs you tight, knowing that when you wake up, he will be gone.</p><p><i><b>But if you loved me, why&rsquo;d you leave me?<br /></b></i><i><b>Take my body, take my body</b></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not closing!&rdquo; you whisper as Thor uses his hands to hold his flesh together. &ldquo;What caused this? You are not even clotting!&rdquo; Terrified, you steady your hands as you prepare another suture.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;No. It won&rsquo;t work. I went to the hospital and they gave me their strongest suture. It will not hold.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Then what can I do?&rdquo; you ask and your eyes meet his. He is focused, assured, and you shake your head. &ldquo;No. You cannot just show up in New York and expect me to help you after you left without a note! I swore off magic when my sister nearly found me out.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Nightingale-&rdquo;</i></p><p><i><br />&ldquo;I am terrified! I am tired, and I have to stay quiet when all I want to scream. Do not &lsquo;Nightingale&rsquo; me.&rdquo; Taking a deep breath, you tell him to apply pressure. &ldquo;Where have you even been?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i><br />&ldquo;Niflheim.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i><br />&ldquo;What-&rdquo;</i></p><p><i><br />&ldquo;I thought the Soul Stone might be there,&rdquo; he said and you shake your head. Smacking your fist against your palm, you conjure a long, thin orange thread. It&rsquo;s serrated edges spark and crackle as you thread it through a needle.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;This will hurt,&rdquo; you warn. &ldquo;It might burn, I do not know. This is my first time doing this.&rdquo; With one last glower, you dig the needle through his flesh, sewing it back together. The glowing orange weaves in and out of his skin like some piercing, the sparks sizzling and he groans through clenched teeth. You take deep breaths, trying to keep your hand steady as he keens over, panting.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;How did you even find me?&rdquo; you whisper, trying to distract him. His eyes flash up to yours and you smile.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Stark.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; Ever since your return, he&rsquo;s been funding your clinic. Bought you lunch a couple of times. Still.&nbsp;&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t keep his kindness to himself.&rdquo; Thor grimaces and you push him back to make sure you can sew the length of the wound properly.</i></p><p><i>When it is done, you sever the thread. The gash seems to be holding together for now and you wrap him up before he can protest.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What did this to you?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;A bilgesnipe caught me from behind with its antlers.&rdquo; Furrowing your brows, you just shake your head minutely and get up. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I - okay. Just rest. I will be downstairs if you need me.&rdquo; Getting off the bed, you head for the door but when Thor calls your name, you turn back. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I left without a note. I tried to figure out what to say, but words failed.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Disgusted, you scowl to hide your quivering lips and continue on your way out. &ldquo;You could have told me the truth.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i><b>All I want is, and all I need is<br /></b></i><i><b>To find somebody, I&rsquo;ll find somebody<br /></b></i><i><b>Like you</b></i></p><p>Your sister keeps crying as she always does when Thor leaves. Sitting on your couch and watching the TV, you groan and close your eyes. All you wanted to do was get home from work and relax by watching the TV, maybe catch up on some reading. Instead, you&rsquo;re reminded that he&rsquo;s gone.</p><p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, shut up!&rdquo; Your sister quietens from where she&rsquo;s doing her homework in the kitchen. &ldquo;If you keep crying, I will cry. Do you want me to cry?&rdquo; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Not really,&rdquo; she says and you open your eyes again. Already they&rsquo;re burning and you blink to clear your vision. &ldquo;I miss Thor.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I miss him, too, Parasite.&rdquo; You sigh. Of course you have to be an asshole to your little sister. &ldquo;Sorry I yelled at you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo;</p><p>Watching the TV again, you frown when breaking news cuts off whatever it was covering on Spider-Man. </p><p>The breaking news? Tony Stark has gone missing.</p><p>As footage plays of the man along with three others walking towards what appears to be aliens, you feel your gut flip. Grabbing the remote, you turn up the volume. </p><p><i>&ldquo;The billionaire was last seen leaving the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere in pursuit of the ship. It is unknown if he is still alive. Evacuations for anyone South of 43rd Street were ordered by Iron Man himself before he faced off against the two alien invaders.&rdquo;</i></p><p>You think you&rsquo;re going to be sick. </p><p>This is most definitely an Avengers kind of situation and if you know Thor, which you do, he&rsquo;ll be right in the thick of it. Grabbing your cane, you get up and walk to your sister. She can&rsquo;t know.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Parasite. Wanna have ice-cream for dinner?&rdquo; you ask, opening the freezer. Glancing over your shoulder, you see her nod dully and you sigh, stopping by her side. &ldquo;You know what? Let&rsquo;s just skip school tomorrow. We can miss Thor together.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; Grateful that you can at least get a smile out of her, you turn back to the freezer. </p><p>&ldquo;Now what do you say about&hellip; neapolitan? Chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry. Plus, I can go and buy some sauces and sprinkles, if you&rsquo;d like.&rdquo; Bending over, you take out the tub of icecream you have and pause for your sister&rsquo;s answer. Setting it on the counter, you turn around to see your sister nowhere in sight. &ldquo;Alright, Parasite! I need your answer if you really want me to buy something to go on your ice cream.&rdquo; She must be somewhere trying to hide. With a sigh, you grab your cane.</p><p>&ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; you call from where you stand. The fear that begins to rise in your throat has your heart beating everywhere in your heart. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t funny. You know I do not like it when you hide. I am a cripple!&rdquo; Hearing her pencil roll and drop to the floor, you go and pick it up. A fine layer of dust covers your fingers and you frown. Everywhere on the chair, flecks of dust stain the chair in differing sizes. Huge black particles stick to your skin as you swallow, looking to the floor. Dragging your fingers through the fine layer of dust, you swear you can almost smell your sister&rsquo;s shampoo clinging to the ash.</p><p>&ldquo;No, no, no.&rdquo; Standing up, the air thickens and you can&rsquo;t breathe. You stumble away, staggering to the TV where you watch as the reporter&rsquo;s arms begin to crumble to dust. The woman screams, begging for help and you watch as sound men and producers try to keep her together. Cars crash outside and you look out the window to see driverless cars that have swerved into trees and poles and humans that are now trapped and are turning to dust too. </p><p><i>&lsquo;What is happening?&rsquo; </i>Your eyes widen as you see a man who is running begin to dust. His legs go first, and then he falls to the floor in a <i>poof</i>, ceasing to exist. Trembling, you try to steady yourself as you touch your face, noting that you&rsquo;re still here. Letting your cane fall, you turn around to make sure your whole body is intact. You shiver.</p><p>You&rsquo;ve never felt so cold before. Hugging yourself with one arm, you reach down to grab your cane only for your hand to disintegrate right before your eyes. Choking, the weight of your injured leg disappears and you fall to a knee, reaching with your one hand left to hold onto the one thing Thor has ever given you. The cane.</p><p>The chattering of your teeth echoes in your skull and you feel as if someone is watching you, as if <i>you </i>are watching you leave your own body. </p><p><i>&lsquo;Oh, God.&rsquo; </i>You whimper, sinking to the floor. Your eyes burn as you see the ashes of your own body flitter through the air. You can&rsquo;t breathe, you can&rsquo;t move, you can&rsquo;t - you don&rsquo;t understand how the more you disappear, the larger the clump in your throat gets until your breaths come ragged.</p><p>Gasping for air, your lungs scream at you, burning you from inside out as you try to hold on. The tears come, hot and racing as your other leg decays and you fall against the couch, your one arm holding onto that cane as the limb slowly crumbles into the same ash that litters your kitchen chair. </p><p>You think, if you hold onto your cane long enough, perhaps Thor will hear your prayers. Hear you begging for his help. Holding it close, you press your wet cheek against the polished wood and can imagine his fingers in your hair as he whispered that it&rsquo;ll be fine. </p><p>It most certainly is not fucking fine as you fucking disintegrate.</p><p>&ldquo;Thor, please. All the times I asked you to be here, please be <i>here</i>,&rdquo; you whisper before your voice dies out. Your heart deflates in your chest, desperation panging in your core like a drum as you reach for your phone on the table before you. It&rsquo;s right next to your remote and-</p><p>Your fingers fall to the ground in a fine layer of ash and dust.</p><p>Arm trembling, you use your arm to knock your phone onto the ground. Leaning down, you use your nose and try to press the home button. The screen lights up and you&rsquo;re face to face with a picture of Thor and a kebab of fried scorpions. It was during your stay at the Kamar-Taj. Before it caused a smile that lasted for days, and now it only causes you to release a shuddering sob.</p><p>&ldquo;Please. Thor. Show up, show up, show up,&rdquo; you whisper to yourself, sitting up and leaning against the couch. The cane rests against your chest and you keep your blurry vision on it. Your eyes trace the gold bands, the engravings on the handle, engravings you&rsquo;ve ran your finger over countless times. Engravings you wish <i>meant </i>something to him.</p><p><i>To my Nightingale, </i>it reads on one side.</p><p>With what&rsquo;s left of your arm, you clamp it between it and your chest, forehead resting against the wood.</p><p>&ldquo;Show up, please! Show up. Please, please, please, please come to me.&rdquo;</p><p>Maybe if you hold on long enough, it&rsquo;ll stop. It will stop, it will stop, it will stop. Your eyes shut and your jaw clenches as tears trace rivers from your red-rimmed eyes down your face. An ugly sound bursts from your throat just as orange blurs come into existence around you. They glow like tiny suns and their rays fight away the cold that had settled on you like a sheet of snow. Warm now, you swallow and open your eyes. Now you see they are orange orbs and in each one you can almost make out a shape. Still, that cannot distract you from holding on to your life. The life you want and the life that has Thor </p><p>Pulling your head back from the wood of your cane, you read the engraving on the other side, one that curbed the loneliness until it didn&rsquo;t, and instead caused it to multiply exponentially until you could no longer sleep without seeing his eyes and feeling his hair at your fingertips. Only now, it gives you the courage to fight whatever this is. Fight until he gets here. He will arrive soon enough.</p><p><i>I will always love you the way flowers love the sun, the way the sun loves the moon, and the way the moon loves the stars. I will always miss you and I will always know that an angel like you deserves the heaven I cannot give. I will love you like the bird who loves freedom, who is free to fly, but chooses to stay.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Thor, I&rsquo;ve always asked you to stay.&rdquo; Your lips press against the engraving and you hiccough, trying to keep your voice steady but failing. &ldquo;Please find me. Please, stay. Please, love me like you said you would. Thor, I&rsquo;ve let you go. Now, it&rsquo;s time for you to stay. Please, you-&rdquo;</p><p>The TV is left on loud. It nearly overpowers the sound of your cane clattering against the wood floor.</p><p><b>TAGS: </b><a>@teawithbucky</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGAnchA7bVQWLX-zuK7xlEA\" target=\"_blank\">@jcc04220</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msUr3307P6H3pHP96P5oVOA\" target=\"_blank\">@shenala</a></p>",

It is a terrible, terrible omen for what will be a terrible, terrible day. Still, a scowl graces your face as you freshen up as best as you can and then out to the hall. You manage to get down the stairs, which, in itself is a miracle that you didn&rsquo;t fall flat on your face, but also, the aching in your leg softens when you sit down on the couch.</p>\n<p>You rest your leg up on the couch, too tired to get up. You stare into the kitchen, wondering where your sister is. Normally, she&rsquo;d be the one to wake you up by jumping on your bed and snuggling up to you. For a minute, panic seizes your throat, making you shoot up to call her name, but then you hear her obnoxious shouting out back and you lie down.</p>\n<p><i>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s fine.&rsquo;</i> You grab the remote, thumb pausing over the power button.<i> &lsquo;But&hellip; I should check if she&rsquo;s wearing her boots. Motherfucker.&rsquo; </i>Grabbing your cane, you swing your legs to the edge and push yourself up, limping to the back door. If she gets sick, then it&rsquo;ll most definitely be more crying, more whining, more work for you. Opening the door, the scent of petrichor immediately wafts to your nose and you smile slightly despite the intensifying cramp in your leg.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yo! Parasite!&rdquo; you yell, walking to the porch in your slippers and glaring distastefully at the drops that pour from the overhang of the roof. Immediately, your sister in her bright yellow boots and pink-as-hell jacket comes running into your view. She&rsquo;s soaked to the skin but at least she&rsquo;s wearing her hood. &ldquo;Get in here!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Morning!&rdquo; she exclaims, running to hug you but you immediately take a half-step back on your good leg. She pouts and you arch an eyebrow.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wet and disgusting. Go dry up and I&rsquo;ll make breakfast, okay?&rdquo; She smiles toothily and you pull her hood off, pushing her into the home. Turning to the yard again, you groan internally when you see her dinosaur stuffy out there covered in mud. Since you got it for her last birthday, she&rsquo;d been attached to the hip with it. You&rsquo;re half-surprised to see her go in without it, but that means that it&rsquo;s now dirtier than a sack of shit with stains you&rsquo;re not sure you can hand wash out.</p>\n<p>Who needs a quarter anyway?<br /><br />You make a mental note to visit the laundromat after work and gather your resolve to get it. Going back in to stuff your feet into boots, you trudge outside, the cane squelching in the dirt. The rain thunders around you but none touch your hair or your skin, which you expected it to. Suddenly, the motive to nearly run from your porch to the dinosaur and back leaves because your leg feels like it&rsquo;s about to need an amputation. Taking your time, you reach down and take it, pinching it between your fingers and getting back to the porch.</p>\n<p>Looking up miraculously, you frown at how the rain seems to hit an invisible barrier high above you, sliding off and around you like a glass cylinder.</p>\n<p>In a split second, you know exactly who&rsquo;s doing this.</p>\n<p>Getting back inside, you throw the dino into the sink and run it under a stream of water, getting what you can off with a quick rinse. Sitting it on the counter to dry, you hear the door knock.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get it!&rdquo; your sister yells, thundering down the stairs.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; You walk over, eyes narrowed. &ldquo;What&rsquo;d I say about answering doors when I&rsquo;m here?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo; Pushing her behind you, you open the door to see him.</p>\n<p>He&rsquo;s trying his best not to stare, which you appreciate, but you hate him seeing you like this.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;What are you doing here, Thor?&rdquo; you ask quietly, letting him in. His blond hair tied up in a bun, he&rsquo;s trying his best to look like a normal human.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I wanted to see if you are okay.&rdquo; Although his words are caring, you can&rsquo;t help the anger that rises up within you, at your situation, at this man who has shown up at your door time and time again. Those code words. Every single time - it&rsquo;s never just a visit.</p>\n</p>",
