Come home.</p><p>Sansa</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Dearest Ser Brienne,</p><p>It&rsquo;s time to return with one husband in tow. Do make sure he understands that there is no choice in this matter.</p><p>Lady Sansa</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Sansa,</p><p>Winterfell is far more agreeable than Dragonstone. At least in company.</p><p>You should know it could be a longer stay, this time.</p><p>Yours,<br />Tyrion</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Tyrion,</p><p>I&rsquo;ll make sure there is plenty of drink to go around then.</p><p>Yours,</p><p>Sansa</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Sansa,</p><p>Marriage is certainly more agreeable than previously imagined. I must commend you for your tolerance of an old man.</p><p>Yours, and bound for the North,<br />Tyrion</p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p><b>co-written with the amazing <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmF6vwTpfoPD_xTjPxq4j0Q\">@starforged</a>, who did all the sansa parts &lt;3</b></p>\n<p>Sansa,</p>\n<p>While I wish this raven be well received, I fully expect it finds a final destination in the belly of a fireplace. Should the former happen, I will do my best to make this message as short and unclever as possible&ndash;a considerable effort on my part in both accounts..</p>\n<p>I am sure the intent of this letter will not surprise you, as we briefly discussed the matter before I departed Winterfell. The septon has reviewed the legality of our marriage. It would stand, should you wish it. I trust you see the benefits of such an arrangement, of which I offer with no expectations. But there are worse things than marriage based on what I hope is a friendship. </p>\n<p>I await your response, or at least the live return of this raven. Birds willing to fly North are difficult to come by, this time of year.</p>\n<p>Your husband in a tentative sense,<br />Tyrion Lannister</p>\n<p>&ndash;</p>\n<p>Tyrion,</p>\n<p>I would not so easily discard any letter from an ally, much less one I could consider a friend. There are so few of them left these days in Westeros. </p>\n<p>An interesting turn of events, all things considered. Tell me the truth, did you manage to use that famous Lannister persuasion on the matter? I suppose either way, it doesn&rsquo;t truly matter how it comes to be that I rid myself of one husband only to find myself still married regardless. Which is not the worst thing that could happen. </p>\n<p>Things still stand as I said them before: you are Hand to the Dragon Queen, and I am not willing to leave the North after - all of it. The North is mine, Winterfell is mine, my family is mine. </p>\n<p>How would a clever man such as yourself reconcile these obstacles?</p>\n<p>I hope you are doing well, and that the warm weather of King&rsquo;s Landing sits better with you. And the birds.</p>\n<p>Your hesitant wife by circumstance,<br />Sansa Stark</p>\n<p>&ndash;</p>\n<p>Sansa,</p>\n<p>It would appear that Lannister charm only goes so far after a tyrannical rule in its name. Thankfully, there is always money.</p>\n<p>And now, I believe, it is time for a confession: King&rsquo;s Landing is truly miserable in the summer. Knowing there is a cooler climate where I might visit is tempting. If for no other reason than a break from the smell of hot shit in the streets. </p>\n<p>So, dear Sansa, would you do me the honor of staying my wife from 1,500 miles away?</p>\n<p>Tyrion</p>\n</p>",
