Before the halls of Hell even had one soul, it was full of weeping.</p>\n\n<p>It was rumored those smaller ones disappeared to be shades.</p>\n\n<p>Over the years, the prayers stopped and their angelic threads finally, completely, turned to bitter rot.</p>\n\n<p>Save for one.</p>\n\n<p>An Angel prays through song.

They covered up their cowardice with privilege. It wasn\u2019t as if the Divine God themself would allow for the exquisite Metatron to debase himself as some sort of trickster for the humans. Let the stupid putti do that.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cGod, you saved me from the fools before, save me once again.\u201d Crowley muttered as he clambered through the dense foliage.</p>\n\n<p>He could do it. He would do it if they would let him stay. It was nice here. Not great, but nice. There was no conflict to change things but at least there were creatures to annoy and different things to eat. (The roses gave him a twisting gut though.)</p>\n\n<p>\u201cLet me stay.\u201d Crowley whispered. \u201cLet me have the peace you promised us all up there. I never got the chance.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He was glum. Not quite self-pitying like the other demons, just put out. He wondered why he had been made at all if he was just going to come out wrong.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re never wrong.\u201d Crowley said as he tried to barter. \u201cAnd my Divine Purpose couldn\u2019t\u2019ve been to end up damned. That\u2019s not fair.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>There was a clearing and a light ahead. There was no need for a light in the Garden and the nights were filled with the ethereal twinkling of the stars anyway.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAn Angel.\u201d Crowley determined in a mocking tone. He slithered away till he found a private place. There was no one here he really wanted to talk to, not really. Maybe one, if she was as interesting as he hoped.</p>\n\n<p>More than the Garden, Crowley really did like the Woman. She was shaped by the Creator but made, literally, of Man. She was the first earth made thing and that pleased Crowley for some reason. Created, but with the imperfect dust in her very blood.</p>\n\n<p>It made her special. Unlike anything else in the whole Garden.</p>\n\n<p>Adam named her, of course, which irked Crowley. She should have her own name, and her own place in all this mess.</p>\n\n<p>When she ultimately found him, on that night, Crowley was surprised.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAnd what are you called?\u201d Her voice, like wind, made him jump in the branches.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAh, well, ehm.\u201d Crowley cleared his throat and hid behind some leaves. \u201cI\u2019m Crowley. Now. Wasn\u2019t before. Didn\u2019t much like that name though. Too many syllables.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Crowley babbled as he darted over branches, trying to escape her curious eyes.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou can change your name?\u201d She asked. Questions, only questions so far. Adam made statements and this one questioned. That wouldn\u2019t do her any good, Crowley knew that from experience.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSure. Hey, should you be here?\u201d Crowley asked. He was sure there had been that same Angel guarding this tree. The Angel that kept getting distracted to go look at something.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cShould you? Did Aziraphale let you in here too?\u201d The woman asked. Crowley stopped on a branch, making a face as he tilted his head back and forth.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNot quite.\u201d Crowley admitted.</p>\n\n<p>The woman\u2019s face suddenly appeared as she moved some of the leaves. She looked surprised, but not disgusted.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhy do you look like that?\u201d She asked.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cA little bit of everything isn\u2019t it? I like it. I used to look like the Angel.\u201d Crowley remarked.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYour eyes.\u201d She said and Crowley turned his head. \u201cThey look like his sword.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He puffed up a bit at that.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHow can I change?\u201d She asked suddenly and Crowley deflated.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNothing changes here. You\u2019d need conflict for that.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHow do I find conflict?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cBy making a choice. Usually one that contradicts what someone else has said.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat is a choice?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Crowley sighed and ambled over the branch. He bumped into a jeweled fruit and quite suddenly had an idea.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cGod told you not to eat of this tree.\u201d Crowley said. He didn\u2019t know what was so special about this tree, it seemed much like the others. The fruit didn\u2019t even taste that great and it had a sizeable pit.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou just have to ask yourself, do you want to try it?\u201d Crowley asked.</p>\n\n<p>The woman looked at the tree, at the fruit that Crowley had begun to coil around.</p>\n\n<p>She nodded.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>A simple vow, a simple choice. Crowley moved away from the fruit and the Woman grabbed it.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMind the stone. It would hurt you given half a chance.\u201d Crowley advised as she bit into it. Sure enough, she winced and moved the fruit in her mouth. She spat the pit onto the dirt.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d Crowley asked.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMuch the same.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be surprised what choices will do to you. Sometimes it\u2019s a delayed reaction.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat did your choices bring you?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDamnation.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI feel I am destined for the same.\u201d The woman looked down at the fruit in her hand.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI will be here, if it\u2019s any consolation.\u201d Crowley jumped down from the branch and landed at her heel. He curled around the fruit pit. \u201cDon\u2019t step on it.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The woman laughed, still sounding like wind.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou have surely aided in my fall but seek to protect my heel? Your priorities are misaligned my friend.\u201d She replied, not unfriendly.</p>\n\n<p>Crowley ignored her and took the pit into his jaws and cracked it. The inside was arsenic and a spicy treat.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSo what has changed?\u201d Crowley asked.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMe.\u201d The woman resolved and took another bite. \u201cAnd my name is too little for what I am.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cReally? I think Eve is nice. You\u2019re on the cusp of things, a bringer of things.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo, I am a bearer of things.\u201d The woman looked back down at the fruit. \u201cI bear the fruit. To my husband and of my husband. The fruit is damned but I bear it.\u201d She sounded bitter now and Crowley started to feel guilty.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat will you be called then?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cLillith.\u201d The woman said.</p>\n\n<p>When Crowley watched her walk away, he felt that familiar sadness. In the morning, God would know. In the morning, the humans would fall.</p>\n\n<p>He climbed back up the tree to look at the stars.</p>\n\n<p>The Alleluia came softly. It was the way they warmed up. Crowley sang it to himself before the math started in his head.</p>\n\n<p>The Divine numbers that set the scales and time. It fed him notes and he sang, louder as his essence ached.</p>\n\n<p>The rejoice turned into apology and then sorrow. He had been abandoned and he was lonely. The Angelic language burned in his throat but Crowley sang. It was mournful and full of regret.</p>\n\n<p>Just not regret for his actions. He did not mourn his place in heaven.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d A nervous voice now. Crowley hid and looked down. In the dark, the Angel was illuminated by his flaming sword. He was of the Cherubim, in the same Sphere Crowley had as a Seraph.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cZophiel? It\u2019s not funny.\u201d The Angel said still looking around. After finding no one, the Angel pouted.</p>\n\n<p>By the eternal fire, an Angel that pouted!</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s my song.\u201d The Angel muttered.</p>\n\n<p>Crowley almost fell out of the tree.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe singing Angel is gone.\u201d Crowley stated as he climbed down. The Angel jumped but waited as he made his way earthward.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAnd what are you doing here?\u201d The Angel asked. He sounded authoritative but underneath was a thread of anxiety. This Angel wasn\u2019t supposed to have let Lillith through, let alone this creature.</p>\n\n<p>Someone might get in trouble.</p>\n\n<p>Crowley grinned as best he could with the scales.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMy job. Someone has to.\u201d Crowley added and the Angel blustered. </p>\n\n<p>This one wasn\u2019t like the others, Crowley decided. He might actually be worth conversing with.</p>",

Let the stupid putti do that.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cGod, you saved me from the fools before, save me once again.\u201d Crowley muttered as he clambered through the dense foliage.</p>\n\n<p>He could do it. He would do it if they would let him stay. It was nice here. Not great, but nice. There was no conflict to change things but at least there were creatures to annoy and different things to eat. (The roses gave him a twisting gut though.)</p>\n\n<p>\u201cLet me stay.\u201d Crowley whispered. \u201cLet me have the peace you promised us all up there. I never got the chance.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He was glum. Not quite self-pitying like the other demons, just put out. He wondered why he had been made at all if he was just going to come out wrong.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re never wrong.\u201d Crowley said as he tried to barter. \u201cAnd my Divine Purpose couldn\u2019t\u2019ve been to end up damned. That\u2019s not fair.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>There was a clearing and a light ahead. There was no need for a light in the Garden and the nights were filled with the ethereal twinkling of the stars anyway.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAn Angel.\u201d Crowley determined in a mocking tone. He slithered away till he found a private place. There was no one here he really wanted to talk to, not really. Maybe one, if she was as interesting as he hoped.</p>\n\n<p>More than the Garden, Crowley really did like the Woman. She was shaped by the Creator but made, literally, of Man. She was the first earth made thing and that pleased Crowley for some reason. Created, but with the imperfect dust in her very blood.</p>\n\n<p>It made her special. Unlike anything else in the whole Garden.</p>\n\n<p>Adam named her, of course, which irked Crowley. She should have her own name, and her own place in all this mess.</p>\n\n<p>When she ultimately found him, on that night, Crowley was surprised.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAnd what are you called?\u201d Her voice, like wind, made him jump in the branches.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAh, well, ehm.\u201d Crowley cleared his throat and hid behind some leaves. \u201cI\u2019m Crowley. Now. Wasn\u2019t before. Didn\u2019t much like that name though. Too many syllables.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Crowley babbled as he darted over branches, trying to escape her curious eyes.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou can change your name?\u201d She asked. Questions, only questions so far. Adam made statements and this one questioned. That wouldn\u2019t do her any good, Crowley knew that from experience.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSure. Hey, should you be here?\u201d Crowley asked. He was sure there had been that same Angel guarding this tree. The Angel that kept getting distracted to go look at something.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cShould you? Did Aziraphale let you in here too?\u201d The woman asked. Crowley stopped on a branch, making a face as he tilted his head back and forth.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNot quite.\u201d Crowley admitted.</p>\n\n<p>The woman\u2019s face suddenly appeared as she moved some of the leaves. She looked surprised, but not disgusted.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhy do you look like that?\u201d She asked.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cA little bit of everything isn\u2019t it? I like it. I used to look like the Angel.\u201d Crowley remarked.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYour eyes.\u201d She said and Crowley turned his head. \u201cThey look like his sword.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He puffed up a bit at that.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHow can I change?\u201d She asked suddenly and Crowley deflated.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNothing changes here. You\u2019d need conflict for that.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHow do I find conflict?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cBy making a choice. Usually one that contradicts what someone else has said.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat is a choice?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Crowley sighed and ambled over the branch. He bumped into a jeweled fruit and quite suddenly had an idea.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cGod told you not to eat of this tree.\u201d Crowley said. He didn\u2019t know what was so special about this tree, it seemed much like the others. The fruit didn\u2019t even taste that great and it had a sizeable pit.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou just have to ask yourself, do you want to try it?\u201d Crowley asked.</p>\n\n<p>The woman looked at the tree, at the fruit that Crowley had begun to coil around.</p>\n\n<p>She nodded.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>A simple vow, a simple choice. Crowley moved away from the fruit and the Woman grabbed it.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMind the stone. It would hurt you given half a chance.\u201d Crowley advised as she bit into it. Sure enough, she winced and moved the fruit in her mouth. She spat the pit onto the dirt.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d Crowley asked.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMuch the same.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be surprised what choices will do to you. Sometimes it\u2019s a delayed reaction.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat did your choices bring you?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDamnation.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI feel I am destined for the same.\u201d The woman looked down at the fruit in her hand.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI will be here, if it\u2019s any consolation.\u201d Crowley jumped down from the branch and landed at her heel. He curled around the fruit pit. \u201cDon\u2019t step on it.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The woman laughed, still sounding like wind.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou have surely aided in my fall but seek to protect my heel? Your priorities are misaligned my friend.\u201d She replied, not unfriendly.</p>\n\n<p>Crowley ignored her and took the pit into his jaws and cracked it. The inside was arsenic and a spicy treat.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSo what has changed?\u201d Crowley asked.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMe.\u201d The woman resolved and took another bite. \u201cAnd my name is too little for what I am.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cReally? I think Eve is nice. You\u2019re on the cusp of things, a bringer of things.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo, I am a bearer of things.\u201d The woman looked back down at the fruit. \u201cI bear the fruit. To my husband and of my husband. The fruit is damned but I bear it.\u201d She sounded bitter now and Crowley started to feel guilty.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat will you be called then?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cLillith.\u201d The woman said.</p>\n\n<p>When Crowley watched her walk away, he felt that familiar sadness. In the morning, God would know. In the morning, the humans would fall.</p>\n\n<p>He climbed back up the tree to look at the stars.</p>\n\n<p>The Alleluia came softly. It was the way they warmed up. Crowley sang it to himself before the math started in his head.</p>\n\n<p>The Divine numbers that set the scales and time. It fed him notes and he sang, louder as his essence ached.</p>\n\n<p>The rejoice turned into apology and then sorrow. He had been abandoned and he was lonely. The Angelic language burned in his throat but Crowley sang. It was mournful and full of regret.</p>\n\n<p>Just not regret for his actions. He did not mourn his place in heaven.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d A nervous voice now. Crowley hid and looked down. In the dark, the Angel was illuminated by his flaming sword. He was of the Cherubim, in the same Sphere Crowley had as a Seraph.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cZophiel? It\u2019s not funny.\u201d The Angel said still looking around. After finding no one, the Angel pouted.</p>\n\n<p>By the eternal fire, an Angel that pouted!</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s my song.\u201d The Angel muttered.</p>\n\n<p>Crowley almost fell out of the tree.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe singing Angel is gone.\u201d Crowley stated as he climbed down. The Angel jumped but waited as he made his way earthward.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAnd what are you doing here?\u201d The Angel asked. He sounded authoritative but underneath was a thread of anxiety. This Angel wasn\u2019t supposed to have let Lillith through, let alone this creature.</p>\n\n<p>Someone might get in trouble.</p>\n\n<p>Crowley grinned as best he could with the scales.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMy job. Someone has to.\u201d Crowley added and the Angel blustered. </p>\n\n<p>This one wasn\u2019t like the others, Crowley decided. He might actually be worth conversing with.</p>",
                "content": "<p>They all used to pray. Even the Big Guy.
