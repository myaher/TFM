        "body": "<p>I know we talk a lot about stuff the show screwed up from the book and like, I get it, stuff was bound to get lost in translation in any adaptation. But I wanna talk about a few of my favorite show-only scenes:</p><p>1. Cersei and Robert\u2019s conversation in season 1</p><p>In this scene we have two non POV characters discussing the state of the kingdom and their marriage. We never get a perspective from Robert in the books and nothing from Cersei until book four. At this point in the books, Cersei is a pretty unsympathetic character. We know her relationship with Robert is pretty bad, of course, but it\u2019s filtered through Ned\u2019s perspective.</p><p>Here, Cersei and Robert have a rare moment of truce and we get some of the best dialogue in the series. They\u2019re not fighting. They are&hellip;resigned. Cersei puts away her hatred of the Starks to admit that Ned is a good choice for hand and she recognizes that Robert shouldn\u2019t have dismissed him. She asks about Lyanna, something she has avoided for a very long time out of spite, because\u00a0\u201cwhat harm can her ghost do to us?\u201d Robert admits that he doesn\u2019t even remember what she looks like, which reveals that his\u00a0\u201clove\u201d for her was probably just infatuation.</p><p>And then my favorite set of lines&ndash;</p><p>Cersei: Was there ever a chance for us, ever a moment?</p><p>Robert: No&hellip;does that make you feel better or worse?</p><p>Cersei: It doesn\u2019t make me feel anything.</p><p>Here, two broken people confront the mess of their lives and wonder if they ever had a chance to have something good. But they didn\u2019t, because Robert has always been his stubborn, prideful self and Cersei is just as proud and stubborn. And Cersei is resigned to it. If it made her feel something once, now that feeling is numbed.</p><p>When I first saw this scene, a scene between two characters I didn\u2019t particularly like, I was struck by the humanness of it. Humanness we did not get at this point in the books. And it informed how I saw her afterwards. For every terrible thing she did, I wanted to know more about her.</p><p>2. Tywin and Jaime</p><p>Our first introduction to Tywin in the books is Tyrion. Understandably, Tyrion and Tywin have a complicated relationship and Tywin is always much more of a dick whenever Tyrion is around. In the show on the other hand? We first see Tywin interacting with Jaime.</p><p>Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, Tywin is still an asshole in this scene too. It is an inherent part of his character. But it is one of the most powerful character introductions for him, and one of the first humanizing moments for Jaime.</p><p>Tywin is skinning a stag in some wonderful foreshadowing of Robert\u2019s death in that same episode. When Jaime tries his usual quips, which we have seen work well on others, Tywin shuts him down because he sees through them. Jaime is weaker here in the presence of his father because even if he can appear unbothered to the rest of the world. And we see how many expectations Tywin puts on Jaime which he does not want, because he is supposed to be the\u00a0\u201cgolden son\u201d.</p><p>More than anything, this is Tywin\u2019s grand entrance. For all of the damage we\u2019ve seen in the three Lannister kids, this is the motherfucker they got it from. So many of these kids insecurities and faults trace back to Tywin being a shit dad with the emotional availability of rock. You see this scene and you\u2019re like&hellip;ah&hellip;yep&hellip;this makes sense. And of course, we see how differently Tywin treats Jaime (someone he has high expectations for) vs how he treats Tyrion (someone he has no expectations for).</p><p>3. Robert, Barristan and Jaime</p><p>I\u2019m sorry but there\u2019s more than one Jaime scene on this list. Obviously like him. But his season one scenes are great on rewatch partially because of what we learn about him in season three.</p><p>So in this scene, Jaime, Barristan and Robert tell war stories, mostly on the drunken king\u2019s request. We see that Jaime is not at all fond of Robert but also some of his admiration for Barristan Selmy as he compliments his battle techniques. He starts to let down his walls a bit during this conversation because its talking about what he\u2019s good at: fighting.</p><p>Then Robert asks about his killing the mad king and Jaime\u2019s wall shoots right back up.</p><p>Robert: What did the mad king say when you stabbed him in the back?</p><p>Jaime: He said the same thing he\u2019d been saying for hours&hellip;burn them all.</p><p>We don\u2019t know the context of this last line but when you rewatch the scene you can see what Jaime is thinking. That he killed the Mad King and saved king\u2019s Landing, but he has only ever been scorned for it. He\u2019s very bitter. And his bitterness shows in the next scene (which I promise is the last Jaime scene)</p><p>4. Jaime and Jory</p><p>Jaime has a brief conversation with Jory, who tries to deliever one of Ned\u2019s messages to Robert while he\u2019s whoring. We see how Robert makes Jaime mind the door while he\u2019s insulting Cersei with as many women as possible. But despite the Stark and Lannister animosity, Jory tries to make conversation about when they met during the Greyjoy rebellion. Jaime\u2019s wall starts to drop again because talking about fighting is the one thing that makes him comfortable (which is why losing his hand so shatters his identity later). It seems the two men have come to some sort of understanding.</p><p>Then Jory brings up Ned and back comes the bitterness! Jaime resents Ned so much for judging him on that day for killing the Mad King and that bitterness all comes to a head later during the street fight. Again, we don\u2019t know why he\u2019s so bitter yet, but it all comes across so well in this scene.</p><p>5. Sansa and Shae</p><p>Sansa and Shae have many scenes together\u00a0 and I really like their friendship. The show goes a long way to develop Shae more than George ever did (only to kill her in the same way but&hellip;we can\u2019t all get what we want). Her more genuine relationship with Tyrion is okay, but it sours for me with the season four result. But it\u2019s her genuine friendship with Sansa that I love.\u00a0</p><p>Shae becomes protective. She gives her advice. At first Sansa snaps at her because she doesn\u2019t trust her and she is still traumatized but eventually the two become very close. I like so many of their conversations, especially in season two and three. And Shae never blames Sansa for any part of her marriage with Tyrion which thank CHRIST for that.</p><p>6. Arya and Tywin</p><p>Anyone who has talked to me for two seconds knows how obsessed I am with these scenes. Because they are&hellip;basically the only humanizing scenes that Tywin gets at all. The very smallest bit of vulnerability. I think it really shows how much of a people person Arya is, sort of without even trying. And she really holds her own with one of the most powerful men in Westeros. She\u2019s smart and capable and she manages to slip under Tywin\u2019s nose even though he could have used her as a valuable hostage if he figured her out. He was starting to catch onto her toward the end, but fortunately did not. Good scenes. Love them. Very good.</p><p>7. Catelyn and Tailisa</p><p>In season three, Catleyn tells Tailisa about the time she made a wreath for Jon Snow. Now I\u2019m a very team Catelyn sort of person. I don\u2019t think she abused Jon so much as she just ignored him. But I think this scene is very telling. Because despite Jon not being her son and also being a potential threat to her own son as bastards often were, despite Ned\u2019s betrayal still being fresh, Catelyn fought to keep this child alive. She prayed for him and he lived. And yes, she didn\u2019t treat him as a son afterwards because it was still a very complicated situation. But I think this goes a long way to show that Catelyn is not the evil, Jon abusing woman that a lot of people paint her as.</p><p>8. Ramsay\u2019s new introduction</p><p>Ramsay has a great intro in the books, but his intro in the show genuinely caught me by surprise. He seems to be completely helpful to Theon and listens to him talk about his regret. He kills the people who are after him and he seems very genuine. But then, it\u2019s all a ruse. This scene so perfectly illustrates how Ramsay uses mind games to toy with people. I thought the number of torture scenes in season three was excessive, but this one I thought was a GREAT intro to Ramsay.</p><p>9. Arya and Lady Craine</p><p>A lot of Arya\u2019s Bravos stuff in the show is very meh. But I love her stuff with Lady Craine because it shows that Arya is not the\u00a0\u2018emotionless killing machine\u2019 that the show sometimes tries to portray her as. Arya does not kill Lady Craine because she can see that she is innocent and she does not want to kill people who haven\u2019t earned it. Later on, her kindness drives Lady Craine to help her and they share a scene in the woman\u2019s house. It\u2019s really sweet and it\u2019s nice to see Arya smile again. Beneath it all, she\u2019s still a child and a traumatized one a that. One who lost her mother and father in a brutal way. And lady Craine gives her just a bit of maternal energy again, before dying horribly because Arya\u2019s life is a nightmare. Still, liked this character.</p><p>10. Varys and Littlefinger sass offs</p><p>Gotta love some Varys and Littlefinger and I do love how they dance around each other all throughout seasons 1-3. They\u2019re the kind of enemies who respect each other but still want to see the other choke. And it also because clear that while one of them is a more neutral figure who doesn\u2019t covet the throne, the other is driving toward it with his ladder of chaos. We got a great sense of both of them in these scenes and it was great.</p><p>Look, the show has some messy parts and even some straight up bad ones (thanks Dorne arc). But it also did a lot right and even some show original scenes are worth quite a lot in my mind.</p>",

                "content_raw": "<p>I know we talk a lot about stuff the show screwed up from the book and like, I get it, stuff was bound to get lost in translation in any adaptation. But I wanna talk about a few of my favorite show-only scenes:</p><p>1. Cersei and Robert\u2019s conversation in season 1</p><p>In this scene we have two non POV characters discussing the state of the kingdom and their marriage. We never get a perspective from Robert in the books and nothing from Cersei until book four. At this point in the books, Cersei is a pretty unsympathetic character. We know her relationship with Robert is pretty bad, of course, but it\u2019s filtered through Ned\u2019s perspective.</p><p>Here, Cersei and Robert have a rare moment of truce and we get some of the best dialogue in the series. They\u2019re not fighting. They are\u2026resigned. Cersei puts away her hatred of the Starks to admit that Ned is a good choice for hand and she recognizes that Robert shouldn\u2019t have dismissed him. She asks about Lyanna, something she has avoided for a very long time out of spite, because\u00a0\u201cwhat harm can her ghost do to us?\u201d Robert admits that he doesn\u2019t even remember what she looks like, which reveals that his\u00a0\u201clove\u201d for her was probably just infatuation.</p><p>And then my favorite set of lines\u2013</p><p>Cersei: Was there ever a chance for us, ever a moment?</p><p>Robert: No\u2026does that make you feel better or worse?</p><p>Cersei: It doesn\u2019t make me feel anything.</p><p>Here, two broken people confront the mess of their lives and wonder if they ever had a chance to have something good. But they didn\u2019t, because Robert has always been his stubborn, prideful self and Cersei is just as proud and stubborn. And Cersei is resigned to it. If it made her feel something once, now that feeling is numbed.</p><p>When I first saw this scene, a scene between two characters I didn\u2019t particularly like, I was struck by the humanness of it. Humanness we did not get at this point in the books. And it informed how I saw her afterwards. For every terrible thing she did, I wanted to know more about her.</p><p>2. Tywin and Jaime</p><p>Our first introduction to Tywin in the books is Tyrion. Understandably, Tyrion and Tywin have a complicated relationship and Tywin is always much more of a dick whenever Tyrion is around. In the show on the other hand? We first see Tywin interacting with Jaime.</p><p>Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, Tywin is still an asshole in this scene too. It is an inherent part of his character. But it is one of the most powerful character introductions for him, and one of the first humanizing moments for Jaime.</p><p>Tywin is skinning a stag in some wonderful foreshadowing of Robert\u2019s death in that same episode. When Jaime tries his usual quips, which we have seen work well on others, Tywin shuts him down because he sees through them. Jaime is weaker here in the presence of his father because even if he can appear unbothered to the rest of the world. And we see how many expectations Tywin puts on Jaime which he does not want, because he is supposed to be the\u00a0\u201cgolden son\u201d.</p><p>More than anything, this is Tywin\u2019s grand entrance. For all of the damage we\u2019ve seen in the three Lannister kids, this is the motherfucker they got it from. So many of these kids insecurities and faults trace back to Tywin being a shit dad with the emotional availability of rock. You see this scene and you\u2019re like\u2026ah\u2026yep\u2026this makes sense. And of course, we see how differently Tywin treats Jaime (someone he has high expectations for) vs how he treats Tyrion (someone he has no expectations for).</p><p>3. Robert, Barristan and Jaime</p><p>I\u2019m sorry but there\u2019s more than one Jaime scene on this list. Obviously like him. But his season one scenes are great on rewatch partially because of what we learn about him in season three.</p><p>So in this scene, Jaime, Barristan and Robert tell war stories, mostly on the drunken king\u2019s request. We see that Jaime is not at all fond of Robert but also some of his admiration for Barristan Selmy as he compliments his battle techniques. He starts to let down his walls a bit during this conversation because its talking about what he\u2019s good at: fighting.</p><p>Then Robert asks about his killing the mad king and Jaime\u2019s wall shoots right back up.</p><p>Robert: What did the mad king say when you stabbed him in the back?</p><p>Jaime: He said the same thing he\u2019d been saying for hours\u2026burn them all.</p><p>We don\u2019t know the context of this last line but when you rewatch the scene you can see what Jaime is thinking. That he killed the Mad King and saved king\u2019s Landing, but he has only ever been scorned for it. He\u2019s very bitter. And his bitterness shows in the next scene (which I promise is the last Jaime scene)</p><p>4. Jaime and Jory</p><p>Jaime has a brief conversation with Jory, who tries to deliever one of Ned\u2019s messages to Robert while he\u2019s whoring. We see how Robert makes Jaime mind the door while he\u2019s insulting Cersei with as many women as possible. But despite the Stark and Lannister animosity, Jory tries to make conversation about when they met during the Greyjoy rebellion. Jaime\u2019s wall starts to drop again because talking about fighting is the one thing that makes him comfortable (which is why losing his hand so shatters his identity later). It seems the two men have come to some sort of understanding.</p><p>Then Jory brings up Ned and back comes the bitterness! Jaime resents Ned so much for judging him on that day for killing the Mad King and that bitterness all comes to a head later during the street fight. Again, we don\u2019t know why he\u2019s so bitter yet, but it all comes across so well in this scene.</p><p>5. Sansa and Shae</p><p>Sansa and Shae have many scenes together\u00a0 and I really like their friendship. The show goes a long way to develop Shae more than George ever did (only to kill her in the same way but\u2026we can\u2019t all get what we want). Her more genuine relationship with Tyrion is okay, but it sours for me with the season four result. But it\u2019s her genuine friendship with Sansa that I love.\u00a0</p><p>Shae becomes protective. She gives her advice. At first Sansa snaps at her because she doesn\u2019t trust her and she is still traumatized but eventually the two become very close. I like so many of their conversations, especially in season two and three. And Shae never blames Sansa for any part of her marriage with Tyrion which thank CHRIST for that.</p><p>6. Arya and Tywin</p><p>Anyone who has talked to me for two seconds knows how obsessed I am with these scenes. Because they are\u2026basically the only humanizing scenes that Tywin gets at all. The very smallest bit of vulnerability. I think it really shows how much of a people person Arya is, sort of without even trying. And she really holds her own with one of the most powerful men in Westeros. She\u2019s smart and capable and she manages to slip under Tywin\u2019s nose even though he could have used her as a valuable hostage if he figured her out. He was starting to catch onto her toward the end, but fortunately did not. Good scenes. Love them. Very good.</p><p>7. Catelyn and Tailisa</p><p>In season three, Catleyn tells Tailisa about the time she made a wreath for Jon Snow. Now I\u2019m a very team Catelyn sort of person. I don\u2019t think she abused Jon so much as she just ignored him. But I think this scene is very telling. Because despite Jon not being her son and also being a potential threat to her own son as bastards often were, despite Ned\u2019s betrayal still being fresh, Catelyn fought to keep this child alive. She prayed for him and he lived. And yes, she didn\u2019t treat him as a son afterwards because it was still a very complicated situation. But I think this goes a long way to show that Catelyn is not the evil, Jon abusing woman that a lot of people paint her as.</p><p>8. Ramsay\u2019s new introduction</p><p>Ramsay has a great intro in the books, but his intro in the show genuinely caught me by surprise. He seems to be completely helpful to Theon and listens to him talk about his regret. He kills the people who are after him and he seems very genuine. But then, it\u2019s all a ruse. This scene so perfectly illustrates how Ramsay uses mind games to toy with people. I thought the number of torture scenes in season three was excessive, but this one I thought was a GREAT intro to Ramsay.</p><p>9. Arya and Lady Craine</p><p>A lot of Arya\u2019s Bravos stuff in the show is very meh. But I love her stuff with Lady Craine because it shows that Arya is not the\u00a0\u2018emotionless killing machine\u2019 that the show sometimes tries to portray her as. Arya does not kill Lady Craine because she can see that she is innocent and she does not want to kill people who haven\u2019t earned it. Later on, her kindness drives Lady Craine to help her and they share a scene in the woman\u2019s house. It\u2019s really sweet and it\u2019s nice to see Arya smile again. Beneath it all, she\u2019s still a child and a traumatized one a that. One who lost her mother and father in a brutal way. And lady Craine gives her just a bit of maternal energy again, before dying horribly because Arya\u2019s life is a nightmare. Still, liked this character.</p><p>10. Varys and Littlefinger sass offs</p><p>Gotta love some Varys and Littlefinger and I do love how they dance around each other all throughout seasons 1-3. They\u2019re the kind of enemies who respect each other but still want to see the other choke. And it also because clear that while one of them is a more neutral figure who doesn\u2019t covet the throne, the other is driving toward it with his ladder of chaos. We got a great sense of both of them in these scenes and it was great.</p><p>Look, the show has some messy parts and even some straight up bad ones (thanks Dorne arc). But it also did a lot right and even some show original scenes are worth quite a lot in my mind.</p>",

We don\u2019t really see other people\u2019s stories through her eyes. Pre-purple-wedding Sansa, Cersei, Jaime, and Tyrion are not only telling their story but the ones of their counter parts. When Sansa flees to the Vale we see Petyr Baelish\u2019s plans play out. When Tyrion flees we see the makings of another Dance With Dragons in the form of Aegon and we also see some of Varys\u2019 plans. You get to see stories play out from two lenses, which I think is really clever.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             When Arya flees to Braavos you kind of get that in the form of Sam, Cat, Daeron, and eventually Raff the Sweetling. Other than those like two-three chapters, Arya is pretty wrapped up in her own story, you don\u2019t hear about anyone else unless Arya mentions them herself. And maybe that is the point. Arya may not be directly connected to the others\u2019 stories at this point, but she cannot fully disentangle from them. Jeyne Poole is married to Ramsay Bolton using Arya\u2019s name. Jon Snow dies trying to get to Arya and Mance Raider is on his way to try to save her. Gendry Waters still seems to be waiting for her at the inn with Willow Heddle. Catelyn Stark knows that Arya is probably alive and still looking for her. Brienne is still looking for her, even if she may be more likely to find Sansa. Arya still wargs into Nymeria who is wreaking havoc in the Riverlands. Arya, however, knows none of this. There is little to no news of any of this. What we learn about in Arya\u2019s chapters while in Braavos is basically all Arya. Her story is still taking place across the Narrow Sea and she doesn\u2019t even know it. </p>",
