The dark became his best friend, and the day his enemy. It was all about timing, yet timing was a dangerous thing. Reality was becoming bigger and bigger and he wasn&rsquo;t sure how to stop it. As you see, it wasn&rsquo;t his to control.</p><p>He was a bystander as he watched his brother rise up above the clouds. It was slow, but it was happening. He was slipping from his fingertips and nothing could stop him from losing him. It wasn&rsquo;t as if anything was going to his head. It was more so the fact that his brother was growing away from him and his parents. It was digging a hole inside him that he buried and couldn&rsquo;t bother to bring up to anyone.</p><p>His bedroom door was always shut nowadays, it was clearly not an invitation for him to go in as he could before. There would be nights where he couldn&rsquo;t sleep. Nights like those always made him go over to his brother&rsquo;s room. At least then he knew things would be okay.</p><p><i>The rain was pouring down on the roof of the house, causing him to toss and turn for the last hour. Each time he was almost asleep, thunder would crash, waking him up. His mind would race while his body was tired; only creating an intense state of paranoia. Racing thoughts would send chills over his body and cause goosebumps to form all over his skin.</i></p><p><i>The only light coming from the room was the corner where a small night light was plugged in. The only use for it was so he could see his way around if he needed to. There were toys scattered on his floor that made him need some kind of light source. One wrong move and he would fall and his parents more than likely would run in in a panic.</i></p><p><i>Lightning struck and illuminating the night sky and his room through the curtain lace, casting shadows from the trees that would cause shivers to dance along his skin. Standing up, he wrapped his blanket around his shoulders, almost like a cloak. Snaking through his room, he opened the door, retreating back when it started creaking.</i></p><p><i>No lights were on in the hall except for the lights coming from his brother&rsquo;s room down the hall. He could hear what sounded like him playing some game and getting annoyed along the way. Tiptoeing down the hall, he knocked on the door before walking in.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Dan?&rdquo; He said, his voice quivering when thunder crashed again.</i></p><p><i>His brother&rsquo;s room was a warm brown that felt like a soft hug that made you feel at home. He enjoyed it much more than his room.</i></p><p><i>Pausing the game, Dan looked over at his brother. The blanket was wrapped around him and caused his frame to look smaller than it was. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up Ad?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Instead of answering like he usually would, he went over and climbed on the bed beside Dan. Laying his head on Dan&rsquo;s chest, he curled into his side. Taking Dan by surprise, he stared at his younger brother half on top of him. He could feel the goosebumps on him himself and sighed.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Alright, it&rsquo;s alright,&rdquo; Dan spoke, reaching over for the controller to turn his game off. Switching over to a movie of some sort that he knew he wouldn&rsquo;t pay much attention to, he turned the volume down. Looking down at his brother, Dan smiled. Adrian&rsquo;s head was on his chest and his shirt was tangled in his hand.</i></p><p><i>It felt nice knowing that he was needed by his brother in certain situations. It made him feel special at times to know that he was needed in only a way he could provide. In ways that his parents couldn&rsquo;t help but he couldn&rsquo;t help but love.</i></p><p><i>Rubbing his back, Dan ran his fingers through Adrian&rsquo;s hair and held him close. Compared to his own, Adrian&rsquo;s skin was ice cold and it made him shiver. Grabbing his blanket from beside him, he pulled it over the two of them and sighed.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t sleep.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I can see that,&rdquo; Dan chuckled, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t come in here often anymore, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Sighing, Adrian mumbled, &ldquo;The storm,&rdquo; and Dan chuckled softly.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll pass soon don&rsquo;t worry. I&rsquo;ll be here until it does and for many more storms to come.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Now? Now nothing was okay. When things changed recently, it wasn&rsquo;t for any greater good. There would be times when Adrian would want Dan&rsquo;s help with something or wanna do something with him, but Dan would simply send him off. He&rsquo;d send him off with the excuse that Phil was calling him and he couldn&rsquo;t be around.</p><p>It was bothersome and irritable so to speak. Someone was coming in from the outside, changing the way he interacted with his brother and it wasn&rsquo;t fair to him. Sure, he was happy his brother was happy and was having the time of his life. Or was he? At first, he was, but as the months went on he couldn&rsquo;t stand it.</p><p>Sometimes it would be the excuse that Dan was leaving for a week or so to go up to see Phil. Ever since he went to Manchester for the first time those few months back, things were different. He could tell and it hurt him. It was burying him back into a corner of Dan that Dan didn&rsquo;t need anymore.</p><p>He remembers how Dan was when October 19th had rolled around the corner. He was running around that morning before their dad would take him to the train station. He watched Dan run around double checking everything more times than he could keep count of.</p><p>&ldquo;Calm down son,&rdquo; his dad said watching him from the doorway of his room. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re just going to a friend&rsquo;s, nothing to worry yourself over.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m making sure I don&rsquo;t forget anything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re obsessively checking everything over and over. Now hurry up and take your stuff down to the car so we make it time.&rdquo;</p><p>Peeking his head out, Adrian watched their dad head back downstairs. Dan mumbled under his breath and sighed as he went back to his room. The last couple of days leading to this Dan had been nervous and frantic and Adrian despised it. Each year around this time, they would do something together to celebrate the fall, but this year they didn&rsquo;t. The traditions they made were changing since this new person came into the picture.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Dan?&rdquo; Adrian said walking into his brother&rsquo;s room.</i></p><p><i>Dan was on the bed laying with his laptop open beside him. From what he could tell it looked like Skype was open but no one was on the other end, meaning that he left for a moment. His heart dropped and he sighed.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Dan groaned looking over after pressing a few buttons on his keyboard.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You said this week we would go walk through the park and do something together.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>A blank look of annoyance washed over Dan&rsquo;s face, leaving no room for any other emotion. Adrian looked around, avoiding his brother&rsquo;s gaze once the words left his mouth.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Adrian, can&rsquo;t you see I&rsquo;m busy?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You promised, though.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Shaking his head Dan sighed and simply motioned for Adrian to turn and leave. With a heavy heart, he turned on his heel and walked out.</i></p><p>He remembers the time when Dan came running inside from a day being out with his friends excited to call Phil. Adrian was in Dan&rsquo;s room playing one of his games. When he looked over to Dan walking in with an annoyed expression plastered on his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Adrian we talked about this. You can&rsquo;t keep coming in here as you <i>please</i>.&rdquo; Dan said and stood in the doorway staring at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Mum said I could play.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t mum&rsquo;s room now is it?&rdquo; Dan snapped bitterly towards him, causing him to physically flinch, which Dan ignored. &ldquo;Get <i>out</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>Sighing, Adrian didn&rsquo;t even bother to save the progress he had. He wasn&rsquo;t sure if Dan would even let him come back in and play the game again later - so what was the hassle in trying? He turned Dan&rsquo;s game off and made his way out. Trudging past Dan he was met with a door slammed against his back once he was out.</p><p>Not too long after he the oh so familiar ringtone of Skype that he was used to hearing through the walls. Sighing, he went back to his room and watched the sunset from his window and the stars appear.</p><p>-</p><p>It didn&rsquo;t take long for the roles to reverse, now Phil was the one coming down to see Dan. Spring was coming and the snow was finally melting on the grass and March had begun. Adrian was downstairs working on his homework he had while his mum was cooking. He heard footsteps running down the stairs and into the kitchen.</p><p>&ldquo;Mum, can yo-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dan time and time again I keep telling you to quit running in the house. You&rsquo;re as bad as your brother.&rdquo;</p><p>Rolling his eyes, Dan sighed. &ldquo;Fine I&rsquo;m sorry, but can you give me a ride to the train station?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What on Earth do you have to go there for?&rdquo; She finally turned around and looked at him.</p><p>&ldquo;I told you Phil was coming down today.&rdquo;</p><p>Sighing she shook her head and stared at him. &ldquo;You never told us that Dan. Besides, I&rsquo;m cooking and helping your brother with his work. There should be \u00a340 in my wallet, use it and get a taxi, that should be enough to get there and back.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Dan muttered, and Adrian watched him grab the money and run off.</p><p>&ldquo;I swear that boy is gonna get on my last nerve.&rdquo; His mum mumbled under her breath and wiped her hands on the paper towel that was on the counter beside her. &ldquo;Come on love, clean up. Food will be finished soon.&rdquo; She smiled at him and walked over and kissed the top of her sons head, and rubbed his back.</p><p>That night, Adrian knew his brother had changed into something that he didn&rsquo;t like. His mindset was changing and soon he no longer cared about spending time with Adrian. But would rather spend time with <i>him</i> whenever he could. It hurt him immensely but he didn&rsquo;t know how to change anything.</p><p>&ldquo;Phil, what do you wanna watch?&rdquo; Dan said as Adrian came downstairs and walked into the kitchen. He could feel Dan&rsquo;s eyes on him the entire time, but he tried ignoring it. It was hard to anymore, but he would be stuck making a failed attempt to; it was the only option that he had any more.</p><p>He heard footsteps approaching him from behind as he grabbed a cup from the pantry.</p><p>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t staying down here, I hope you know. Phil&rsquo;s here so we get the downstairs tonight.&rdquo; Ignoring him, Adrian got into the fridge to grab the rest of the milk to pour himself a glass. &ldquo;I know you can hear me, Adrian.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Even if I <i>could</i> stay down here I wouldn&rsquo;t want to,&rdquo; he muttered under his breath. Throwing the empty milk jug away, he pushed his past Dan and stormed upstairs. He felt Dan&rsquo;s eyes stare at him the entire time he left, not knowing the baffled look that was plastered all over his face.</p>",

The dark became his best friend, and the day his enemy. It was all about timing, yet timing was a dangerous thing. Reality was becoming bigger and bigger and he wasn\u2019t sure how to stop it. As you see, it wasn\u2019t his to control.</p><p>He was a bystander as he watched his brother rise up above the clouds. It was slow, but it was happening. He was slipping from his fingertips and nothing could stop him from losing him. It wasn\u2019t as if anything was going to his head. It was more so the fact that his brother was growing away from him and his parents. It was digging a hole inside him that he buried and couldn\u2019t bother to bring up to anyone.</p><p>His bedroom door was always shut nowadays, it was clearly not an invitation for him to go in as he could before. There would be nights where he couldn\u2019t sleep. Nights like those always made him go over to his brother\u2019s room. At least then he knew things would be okay.</p><p><i>The rain was pouring down on the roof of the house, causing him to toss and turn for the last hour. Each time he was almost asleep, thunder would crash, waking him up. His mind would race while his body was tired; only creating an intense state of paranoia. Racing thoughts would send chills over his body and cause goosebumps to form all over his skin.</i></p><p><i>The only light coming from the room was the corner where a small night light was plugged in. The only use for it was so he could see his way around if he needed to. There were toys scattered on his floor that made him need some kind of light source. One wrong move and he would fall and his parents more than likely would run in in a panic.</i></p><p><i>Lightning struck and illuminating the night sky and his room through the curtain lace, casting shadows from the trees that would cause shivers to dance along his skin. Standing up, he wrapped his blanket around his shoulders, almost like a cloak. Snaking through his room, he opened the door, retreating back when it started creaking.</i></p><p><i>No lights were on in the hall except for the lights coming from his brother\u2019s room down the hall. He could hear what sounded like him playing some game and getting annoyed along the way. Tiptoeing down the hall, he knocked on the door before walking in.</i></p><p><i>\u201cDan?\u201d He said, his voice quivering when thunder crashed again.</i></p><p><i>His brother\u2019s room was a warm brown that felt like a soft hug that made you feel at home. He enjoyed it much more than his room.</i></p><p><i>Pausing the game, Dan looked over at his brother. The blanket was wrapped around him and caused his frame to look smaller than it was. \u201cWhat\u2019s up Ad?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Instead of answering like he usually would, he went over and climbed on the bed beside Dan. Laying his head on Dan\u2019s chest, he curled into his side. Taking Dan by surprise, he stared at his younger brother half on top of him. He could feel the goosebumps on him himself and sighed.</i></p><p><i>\u201cAlright, it\u2019s alright,\u201d Dan spoke, reaching over for the controller to turn his game off. Switching over to a movie of some sort that he knew he wouldn\u2019t pay much attention to, he turned the volume down. Looking down at his brother, Dan smiled. Adrian\u2019s head was on his chest and his shirt was tangled in his hand.</i></p><p><i>It felt nice knowing that he was needed by his brother in certain situations. It made him feel special at times to know that he was needed in only a way he could provide. In ways that his parents couldn\u2019t help but he couldn\u2019t help but love.</i></p><p><i>Rubbing his back, Dan ran his fingers through Adrian\u2019s hair and held him close. Compared to his own, Adrian\u2019s skin was ice cold and it made him shiver. Grabbing his blanket from beside him, he pulled it over the two of them and sighed.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI can\u2019t sleep.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI can see that,\u201d Dan chuckled, \u201cYou don\u2019t come in here often anymore, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Sighing, Adrian mumbled, \u201cThe storm,\u201d and Dan chuckled softly.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019ll pass soon don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll be here until it does and for many more storms to come.\u201d</i></p><p>Now? Now nothing was okay. When things changed recently, it wasn\u2019t for any greater good. There would be times when Adrian would want Dan\u2019s help with something or wanna do something with him, but Dan would simply send him off. He\u2019d send him off with the excuse that Phil was calling him and he couldn\u2019t be around.</p><p>It was bothersome and irritable so to speak. Someone was coming in from the outside, changing the way he interacted with his brother and it wasn\u2019t fair to him. Sure, he was happy his brother was happy and was having the time of his life. Or was he? At first, he was, but as the months went on he couldn\u2019t stand it.</p><p>Sometimes it would be the excuse that Dan was leaving for a week or so to go up to see Phil. Ever since he went to Manchester for the first time those few months back, things were different. He could tell and it hurt him. It was burying him back into a corner of Dan that Dan didn\u2019t need anymore.</p><p>He remembers how Dan was when October 19th had rolled around the corner. He was running around that morning before their dad would take him to the train station. He watched Dan run around double checking everything more times than he could keep count of.</p><p>\u201cCalm down son,\u201d his dad said watching him from the doorway of his room. \u201cYou\u2019re just going to a friend\u2019s, nothing to worry yourself over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m making sure I don\u2019t forget anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re obsessively checking everything over and over. Now hurry up and take your stuff down to the car so we make it time.\u201d</p><p>Peeking his head out, Adrian watched their dad head back downstairs. Dan mumbled under his breath and sighed as he went back to his room. The last couple of days leading to this Dan had been nervous and frantic and Adrian despised it. Each year around this time, they would do something together to celebrate the fall, but this year they didn\u2019t. The traditions they made were changing since this new person came into the picture.</p><p><i>\u201cDan?\u201d Adrian said walking into his brother\u2019s room.</i></p><p><i>Dan was on the bed laying with his laptop open beside him. From what he could tell it looked like Skype was open but no one was on the other end, meaning that he left for a moment. His heart dropped and he sighed.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat?\u201d Dan groaned looking over after pressing a few buttons on his keyboard.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou said this week we would go walk through the park and do something together.\u201d</i></p><p><i>A blank look of annoyance washed over Dan\u2019s face, leaving no room for any other emotion. Adrian looked around, avoiding his brother\u2019s gaze once the words left his mouth.</i></p><p><i>\u201cAdrian, can\u2019t you see I\u2019m busy?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou promised, though.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Shaking his head Dan sighed and simply motioned for Adrian to turn and leave. With a heavy heart, he turned on his heel and walked out.</i></p><p>He remembers the time when Dan came running inside from a day being out with his friends excited to call Phil. Adrian was in Dan\u2019s room playing one of his games. When he looked over to Dan walking in with an annoyed expression plastered on his face.</p><p>\u201cAdrian we talked about this. You can\u2019t keep coming in here as you <i>please</i>.\u201d Dan said and stood in the doorway staring at him.</p><p>\u201cMum said I could play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t mum\u2019s room now is it?\u201d Dan snapped bitterly towards him, causing him to physically flinch, which Dan ignored. \u201cGet <i>out</i>.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, Adrian didn\u2019t even bother to save the progress he had. He wasn\u2019t sure if Dan would even let him come back in and play the game again later - so what was the hassle in trying? He turned Dan\u2019s game off and made his way out. Trudging past Dan he was met with a door slammed against his back once he was out.</p><p>Not too long after he the oh so familiar ringtone of Skype that he was used to hearing through the walls. Sighing, he went back to his room and watched the sunset from his window and the stars appear.</p><p>-</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long for the roles to reverse, now Phil was the one coming down to see Dan. Spring was coming and the snow was finally melting on the grass and March had begun. Adrian was downstairs working on his homework he had while his mum was cooking. He heard footsteps running down the stairs and into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cMum, can yo-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan time and time again I keep telling you to quit running in the house. You\u2019re as bad as your brother.\u201d</p><p>Rolling his eyes, Dan sighed. \u201cFine I\u2019m sorry, but can you give me a ride to the train station?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat on Earth do you have to go there for?\u201d She finally turned around and looked at him.</p><p>\u201cI told you Phil was coming down today.\u201d</p><p>Sighing she shook her head and stared at him. \u201cYou never told us that Dan. Besides, I\u2019m cooking and helping your brother with his work. There should be \u00a340 in my wallet, use it and get a taxi, that should be enough to get there and back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Dan muttered, and Adrian watched him grab the money and run off.</p><p>\u201cI swear that boy is gonna get on my last nerve.\u201d His mum mumbled under her breath and wiped her hands on the paper towel that was on the counter beside her. \u201cCome on love, clean up. Food will be finished soon.\u201d She smiled at him and walked over and kissed the top of her sons head, and rubbed his back.</p><p>That night, Adrian knew his brother had changed into something that he didn\u2019t like. His mindset was changing and soon he no longer cared about spending time with Adrian. But would rather spend time with <i>him</i> whenever he could. It hurt him immensely but he didn\u2019t know how to change anything.</p><p>\u201cPhil, what do you wanna watch?\u201d Dan said as Adrian came downstairs and walked into the kitchen. He could feel Dan\u2019s eyes on him the entire time, but he tried ignoring it. It was hard to anymore, but he would be stuck making a failed attempt to; it was the only option that he had any more.</p><p>He heard footsteps approaching him from behind as he grabbed a cup from the pantry.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t staying down here, I hope you know. Phil\u2019s here so we get the downstairs tonight.\u201d Ignoring him, Adrian got into the fridge to grab the rest of the milk to pour himself a glass. \u201cI know you can hear me, Adrian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if I <i>could</i> stay down here I wouldn\u2019t want to,\u201d he muttered under his breath. Throwing the empty milk jug away, he pushed his past Dan and stormed upstairs. He felt Dan\u2019s eyes stare at him the entire time he left, not knowing the baffled look that was plastered all over his face.</p></p>",

The whole day is about love and sharing love, and because of that, both boys love to go all out and buy presents for each other. </p><p>Dan wakes up around mid-day in a warm and cozy bed to the smell of pancakes and waffles. He opens his eyes slowly and stretches his arms and legs, yawning. Dan then decides to follow the scent out into the kitchen. Surprisingly, there&rsquo;s still no sign of Phil, only a few dishes left in the sink.</p><p>&ldquo;Phil? Where are you?&rdquo; dan calls out, walking into the lounge and noticing the balcony door wide open. Curious, he steps outside and gasps, stopping in his tracks.</p><p>&ldquo;I was wondering when you would wake up&rdquo; Phil laughs, putting his book down. Set out before Dan is a breakfast of pancakes with a side of fruit, a cup of coffee and a fresh bouquet of roses in a vase, dead centre of their balcony two-seater table. </p><p>&ldquo;you did all this?&rdquo; Dan asks, walking over to Phil. He wraps his arms around Dan&rsquo;s waist and pulls him in for a soft kiss, both smiling against each other&rsquo;s mouths. &ldquo;of course. Only the best for you&rdquo; he grins. Dan sits down across from Phil and picks up the coffee, taking a sip. It&rsquo;s still hot, and exactly how he likes it.</p><p>They eat breakfast together, giggling and laughing like a bunch of newlyweds, holding hands and chatting about past valentines days they spent together. </p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;ll be 10 years this year.&rdquo; Dan murmurs, rubbing his thumb over Phil&rsquo;s knuckles.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t either. But, I can tell you right now that it&rsquo;s been the best 10 years of my life&rdquo; Phil pulls their hands up to his mouth, and he presses a kiss to Dan&rsquo;s hand. Dan starts blushing like a shy teenager, making them both laugh more.</p><p>&ldquo;same here. I love you, so much Phil&rdquo; Dan smiles fondly at him. Phil smiles back. &ldquo;presents?&rdquo; He asks. Phil grins and nods. Dan gets up first and rushes back to their bedroom while Phil packs up the dishes. </p><p>Dan unlocks a bottom drawer at his desk, pulling it open and revealing 3 carefully wrapped presents. Naturally, he didn&rsquo;t wrap them, he asked Louise to since she&rsquo;s more talented in that kind of things. He was very grateful. He picks them up and carries them out to the lounge where Phil is sitting down with 3 presents as well, sliming lovingly at him as he sits down next to him.</p><p>They open the presents one by one, laughing and giving each other kisses as they unwrap them. Dan was given &ldquo;Black like my soul&rdquo; Bath bombs, a book called &ldquo;Images you Should NOT masturbate to&rdquo; and personalised socks with a picture of dan pulling an unflattering face. </p><p>Phil&rsquo;s presents were a book titled &ldquo;How to live with a Huge Penis&rdquo;, Marshmallow Vodka and dinosaur house planters. They both laughed hysterically at their gifts, thanking each other graciously. </p><p>&ldquo;I think you should really read your book&rdquo; Dan motions towards Phil&rsquo;s new book, making him laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;is that so?&rdquo; Phil chuckles, leaning over and pressing his lips against Dan&rsquo;s. Dan grins evilly into the kiss. &ldquo;Yeah, it&rsquo;s been a real pain in my ass&rdquo; Dan jokes and makes both of then break out into infectious laughing. </p><p>&ldquo;actually shut up&rdquo; Phil playfully hits Dan, making him laugh harder. &ldquo;you&rsquo;re gonna have to make me&rdquo; Dan replies wickedly. Phil rolls his eyes and drags Dan to their bedroom.</p>",
