You were walking out the door while checking your email on your phone when you hit a solid chest.

He never took his eyes off you following your every move down the sidewalk. </p><p>\u201cWait, how about I get you coffee sometime?\u201d He didn\u2019t want to let you get away so easily.  </p><p>\u201cUh sure, um\u2026 phone?\u201d He handed you a smartphone and you put your number in it, \u201cI really do have to go, my boss is waiting on me.\u201d You smiled to yourself, Captain freaking America asked for your number.</p><p><br/></p><p>You were beaming for the rest of the day waiting for him to text or call but got nothing. The week stretched on and it was more of the same. As easily as he had ran into you he had forgot you all the same.</p><p> Your boss had told you he had a meeting in the avengers tower and had you carry his stuff. He was a sexist asshole but it paid well enough and he didn\u2019t care about your lack of experience. </p><p>You followed him into the tower placing all the files on the table he directed you towards.</p><p>\u201cMr. Robinson!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony Stark, the legend.\u201d They greeted each other with a hug. You turned when you felt the hairs on the back of your neck stand up, it was that feeling of being watched. </p><p>\u201cAnd who is the lovely lady with you.\u201d You turned back to look at Tony as he spoke. </p><p>\u201cAhhh, pay no mind that is just my assistant, miss\u2026 remind me of your name?\u201d  You dipped your head trying to hide the anger and embarrassment, you had worked with him for almost a year but he never learned your name. </p><p>\u201cMiss Y/L/N,\u201d He snapped his fingers as you said it repeating it and saying it was on the tip of his tongue. He dismissed you quickly saying the \u201cmen had to talk,\u201d telling you to get him coffee. You waited until he couldn\u2019t see your face before rolling your eyes. </p><p>You left the room still feeling that odd sensation of being watched. </p><p><br/></p><p>You boarded the subway leaning against the pole waiting for the train to take off. You noticed the car was unusually empty. There was someone sitting at the other end of the car wearing a baseball hat and glasses. They were reading a paper copy of the news like some old gentleman, You pulled out your phone checking social media as you waited for your stop. You looked up when you heard the garbled voice announce the stop. You walked up the stairs into the Brooklyn night as you continued home. </p><p>You felt as if someone had been following you, quickly reaching into your purse grasping the mace within. You kept it in your grasp as you continued to walk. Once you got into the air lock of your apartment you let out a breath you did realize you had been holding. </p><p>You went up the two flights of stairs and went to the end of the hall wanting to be able to relax. </p><p>You opened your apartment feeling a cold breeze looking to see your window open you rushed over and closed it before checking the thermostat while taking off your jacket and shoes sighing in relief to be out of the flats. You walked into your kitchen and poured yourself a glass of wine before starting on dinner. You left then pasta to cook while you went to change from the slacks and scratchy shirt. You noticed that one of the drawers of your dresser was left open, probably from the rush of getting ready. You pushed your drawer of bras and panties closed before leaning down to another to grab some comfortable loungewear. You changed quickly slipping on some slippers before rushing back to the kitchen so you didn\u2019t over cook your dinner. </p><p><br/></p><p>Your boss had you running around picking up things for him, dry cleaning, coffee and lunch. You were about to return to the office when your phone went off.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you to run and get something from Mr. Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir would you like me to drop off your lunch first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive it to the person in the lobby I need this ASAP.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes Sir.\u201d You pushed open the doors of the office being met with the receptionist handing her the things you rushed right back into summer heat. </p><p>You walked into Avengers tower sighing at the rush of cold air. Walking up to the security desk. </p><p>\u201cMs. Y/L/N, you are expected. Take the elevator to the 80th floor.\u201d they handed you an ID badge before pointing to the elevator behind them. </p><p>You let out a light thank you rushing to the elevator as the doors opened pushing the button for the 80th floor. You stepped away from the panel and stood in the corner looking at your shoes, you&rsquo;d have to buy a new pair soon, there was scuff marks on them that was ruining the fabric. The doors opened and you saw someone else walk in, looking up you saw a man whose pants were nicely fitted before looking up to see a tuft of fimlar hair. The embarrassment of the other day weeks ago felt fresh as you tried to disappear into the elevator wall. </p><p>The elevator chimed 80th floor and you had to push past him seeing as he stood directly in front of the doorway. As you left you felt a slight brush against the back of your pants. You wrote it off as an accident, before proceeding down the hall. </p><p>\u201cMiss Y/L/N right?\u201d You found Mr Stark standing in a room surrounded by holographic screens and 3D models. You affirmed his question as you looked around the beautiful office space. \u201cYour old school boss asked for paper copies of the contract. Let me grab them for you. You need anything, water, it&rsquo;s warm outside correct? Hey Friday, can you ask someone to bring up two things of water, oh and something to eat this poor girl looks exhausted.\u201d You tried to stop him but he didn\u2019t let you get a word in edgewise. Continuing to work on whatever he had on his screen. A voice responded over speakers to his command. </p><p>\u201cHey Tony!\u201d The sound of his voice made you jump, \u201cHave you seen\u2026\u201d Steve looked over at you as you stood like a statue not sure what to do. \u201cI know you, I\u2019m sorry where have we met?\u201d There was something uncomfortable about his gaze but you must have been paranoid, it was Steve Rogers he was one of the good guys. </p><p>\u201cI ran into you a few weeks ago, spilled coffee everywhere.\u201d You tore your gaze from him looking down on the floor. </p><p>\u201cOh right the beautiful girl from the coffee shop. You never called I was hoping to meet up again.\u201d Tony just shrugged and continued working, he knew that Cap needed a personal life. </p><p>\u201cI never got your number, You only had mine.\u201d He chuckled at the meek response you gave as if he was trying to act normal.</p><p>\u201cWell that\u2019s a shame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me Mr. Stark, Mr. Rogers, there is an incoming message from the department of defense.\u201d The omnitionatinat voice sounded over the speakers. </p><p>\u201cTell them to wait,\u201d </p><p>\u201cTony.\u201d </p><p>\u201cFine, tell them 15 minutes.\u201d Tony closed some of the screens and got up quickly. He handed you the manila folder quickly, \u201cSorry you didn\u2019t get the break but can\u2019t keep the government waiting, especially with the Captain over here.\u201d You giggled slightly, if the whole world, yourself included, didn\u2019t know he was taken you\u2019d assume he was flirting with you. </p><p>\u201cThank you Mr. Stark.\u201d You went to the elevator relieved when the doors closed. </p><p><br/></p><p>The rest of that week was normal, when friday came you were so happy to walk into your apartment after taking the subway back to Brooklyn. You opened the door to see the window was left open and all the summer heat had entered the apartment. You closed it before going to make sure the air conditioning was on. You pulled out the open bottle of wine starting your usual daily routine of making dinner with a glass of wine. The wine tasted bitter compared to the glass from the night before. You finished the glass before pouring another and going to change. You made it to the doorway of the bedroom before stumbling and leaning against the wall. You shook your head trying to rid yourself of the dizzy feeling. You stood up and went towards your bed before falling to the floor. You swear you could feel arms wrapping around you and whispering something to you. </p>",

You were about to return to the office when your phone went off.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you to run and get something from Mr. Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir would you like me to drop off your lunch first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive it to the person in the lobby I need this ASAP.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes Sir.\u201d You pushed open the doors of the office being met with the receptionist handing her the things you rushed right back into summer heat. </p><p>You walked into Avengers tower sighing at the rush of cold air. Walking up to the security desk. </p><p>\u201cMs. Y/L/N, you are expected. Take the elevator to the 80th floor.\u201d they handed you an ID badge before pointing to the elevator behind them. </p><p>You let out a light thank you rushing to the elevator as the doors opened pushing the button for the 80th floor. You stepped away from the panel and stood in the corner looking at your shoes, you\u2019d have to buy a new pair soon, there was scuff marks on them that was ruining the fabric.

You affirmed his question as you looked around the beautiful office space. \u201cYour old school boss asked for paper copies of the contract. Let me grab them for you. You need anything, water, it\u2019s warm outside correct? Hey Friday, can you ask someone to bring up two things of water, oh and something to eat this poor girl looks exhausted.\u201d You tried to stop him but he didn\u2019t let you get a word in edgewise. Continuing to work on whatever he had on his screen. A voice responded over speakers to his command. </p><p>\u201cHey Tony!\u201d The sound of his voice made you jump, \u201cHave you seen\u2026\u201d Steve looked over at you as you stood like a statue not sure what to do. \u201cI know you, I\u2019m sorry where have we met?\u201d There was something uncomfortable about his gaze but you must have been paranoid, it was Steve Rogers he was one of the good guys. </p><p>\u201cI ran into you a few weeks ago, spilled coffee everywhere.\u201d You tore your gaze from him looking down on the floor. </p><p>\u201cOh right the beautiful girl from the coffee shop. You never called I was hoping to meet up again.\u201d Tony just shrugged and continued working, he knew that Cap needed a personal life. </p><p>\u201cI never got your number, You only had mine.\u201d He chuckled at the meek response you gave as if he was trying to act normal.</p><p>\u201cWell that\u2019s a shame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me Mr. Stark, Mr. Rogers, there is an incoming message from the department of defense.\u201d The omnitionatinat voice sounded over the speakers. </p><p>\u201cTell them to wait,\u201d </p><p>\u201cTony.\u201d </p><p>\u201cFine, tell them 15 minutes.\u201d Tony closed some of the screens and got up quickly.

You opened the door to see the window was left open and all the summer heat had entered the apartment. You closed it before going to make sure the air conditioning was on. You pulled out the open bottle of wine starting your usual daily routine of making dinner with a glass of wine. The wine tasted bitter compared to the glass from the night before. You finished the glass before pouring another and going to change. You made it to the doorway of the bedroom before stumbling and leaning against the wall. You shook your head trying to rid yourself of the dizzy feeling. You stood up and went towards your bed before falling to the floor.

He never took his eyes off you following your every move down the sidewalk. </p><p>\u201cWait, how about I get you coffee sometime?\u201d He didn\u2019t want to let you get away so easily.  </p><p>\u201cUh sure, um\u2026 phone?\u201d He handed you a smartphone and you put your number in it, \u201cI really do have to go, my boss is waiting on me.\u201d You smiled to yourself, Captain freaking America asked for your number.</p><p><br></p><p>You were beaming for the rest of the day waiting for him to text or call but got nothing. The week stretched on and it was more of the same. As easily as he had ran into you he had forgot you all the same.</p><p> Your boss had told you he had a meeting in the avengers tower and had you carry his stuff. He was a sexist asshole but it paid well enough and he didn\u2019t care about your lack of experience. </p><p>You followed him into the tower placing all the files on the table he directed you towards.</p><p>\u201cMr. Robinson!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony Stark, the legend.\u201d They greeted each other with a hug.

You looked up when you heard the garbled voice announce the stop.
