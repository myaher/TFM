It\u2019s honestly been such a wonderful hectic two weeks for me. To recap, I got an incredible job where I literally get paid to be a content creator, I got to see Michelle Obama in person, and now the GOT trailer just dropped! It\u2019s like the cherry on top of everything! \u2764\ufe0f</p><p>Anyway, since I\u2019ve been a little preoccupied I wasn\u2019t able to flood the tags with my <b>EXTRA AF </b>hype like I usually do when things drop so I thought I would make a meta about some of my quick thoughts on the trailer. So without further ado, let\u2019s get into it!</p><p>I know a lot of you were not impressed by this new trailer but for me I thought it was beautiful! The trailer had some of the most gorgeous shots I\u2019ve seen on the show thus far. Some of my favorite shots were Arya running in utter fear, Jon in front of the heart tree, Sansa seeing Dany\u2019s dragons for the first time and even Drogon and Rhaegel flying over the beautiful landscape of the North. Out of all the clips shown the one of Cersei above is <b>BY FAR</b> my favorite. When I saw this shot she literally took my breath away. This one clip is so painstakingly tragic and beautiful all at the same time. It moved me to the point that it almost made me want to switch sides completely and root for my girl to win it all! </p><p>Quick side note:</p><h2>For \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe the \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe love \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe of \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe all \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffethat \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe is \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe good \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe in \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe the \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe world \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe let \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe Lena \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe Headey \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe win \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe  her \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe Emmy!!</h2><p>That is all! Moving on, I genuinely think that this scene pretty much embodies everything you need to know about season 8. Let me explain. The trailer we were given was pretty much the opposite of the promotion that we\u2019ve had for the final season. For a worldwide campaign that\u2019s literally hashtaged #ForTheThrone there were practically no hints of any relational/political conflicts to come in this trailer. If anything the trailer in itself is pretty much cut and dry and is seemingly as predictable as they come. (WWs vs Humanity and the \u201cGood Guys\u201d vs Cersei.) But yet the beauty of this trailer is that they put in these hidden gems such as this Cersei scene above that really makes you reevaluate the <b>TYPE OF STORY</b> they are trying to tell. It\u2019s wonderfully deceptive but the gems are there! </p><p>To me, I clearly see a running theme of these characters facing the reality of who they are and what truly matters to them. The Cersei scene above completely embodies that. Is that not the face of a women realizing the depth of her loss, pain, and loneliness and what it\u2019s made her become? You can see this same theme running in Arya, Jaimie and Missandei and Grey Worm\u2019s clips as well. </p><p>Arya\u2019s inner struggle of being No One or returning to the core of who she was. Jaimie on the path of redemption desperatley trying to restore his name. Missandei and Greyworm dedicated to Daenerys but clearly devoted to each other above all else. These are just a handful of the clips where this theme is present. </p><p>What\u2019s extremely noteable is that as we get a hint into some of the revelation/journeys these other characters will make/face we are completely shut out from some of the most important characters journeys this season. Except for some close up shots of Jon, Dany, Tyrion and Sansa\u2019s facial expressions we really have no indication of their inner struggles, what really matters to them and who they are and that means a lot!!!!!!!!!!  </p><p>We get no clue about their emotional or political journeys other than what the story has led us to believe and expect! This is so so so HUGE!! I can\u2019t emphasize that enough and this means that without a doubt there are <b>MAJOR TWISTS TO COME!! </b>At the end of the day, this is a story that is absolutely about family, and the emotional and political relationships these characters have to face! </p><p>So with that I end with this. For those of you who are fretting, I promise you the basic story that you fear is not happening!! It\u2019s not! No matter what you read. Trust the narrative. Note the absence of a semblance of a hint of your fave characters upcoming journeys. All of this is purposeful! All of this is done with great intention to hide the storylines that will effectively change everything we thought and believed about the final season of Game of Thrones.</p>",

It\u2019s honestly been such a wonderful hectic two weeks for me. To recap, I got an incredible job where I literally get paid to be a content creator, I got to see Michelle Obama in person, and now the GOT trailer just dropped! It\u2019s like the cherry on top of everything! \u2764\ufe0f</p><p>Anyway, since I\u2019ve been a little preoccupied I wasn\u2019t able to flood the tags with my <b>EXTRA AF </b>hype like I usually do when things drop so I thought I would make a meta about some of my quick thoughts on the trailer. So without further ado, let\u2019s get into it!</p><p>I know a lot of you were not impressed by this new trailer but for me I thought it was beautiful! The trailer had some of the most gorgeous shots I\u2019ve seen on the show thus far. Some of my favorite shots were Arya running in utter fear, Jon in front of the heart tree, Sansa seeing Dany\u2019s dragons for the first time and even Drogon and Rhaegel flying over the beautiful landscape of the North. Out of all the clips shown the one of Cersei above is <b>BY FAR</b> my favorite. When I saw this shot she literally took my breath away. This one clip is so painstakingly tragic and beautiful all at the same time. It moved me to the point that it almost made me want to switch sides completely and root for my girl to win it all! </p><p>Quick side note:</p><h2>For \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe the \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe love \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe of \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe all \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffethat \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe is \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe good \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe in \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe the \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe world \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe let \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe Lena \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe Headey \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe win \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe  her \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe Emmy!!</h2><p>That is all! Moving on, I genuinely think that this scene pretty much embodies everything you need to know about season 8. Let me explain. The trailer we were given was pretty much the opposite of the promotion that we\u2019ve had for the final season. For a worldwide campaign that\u2019s literally hashtaged #ForTheThrone there were practically no hints of any relational/political conflicts to come in this trailer. If anything the trailer in itself is pretty much cut and dry and is seemingly as predictable as they come. (WWs vs Humanity and the \u201cGood Guys\u201d vs Cersei.) But yet the beauty of this trailer is that they put in these hidden gems such as this Cersei scene above that really makes you reevaluate the <b>TYPE OF STORY</b> they are trying to tell. It\u2019s wonderfully deceptive but the gems are there! </p><p>To me, I clearly see a running theme of these characters facing the reality of who they are and what truly matters to them. The Cersei scene above completely embodies that. Is that not the face of a women realizing the depth of her loss, pain, and loneliness and what it\u2019s made her become? You can see this same theme running in Arya, Jaimie and Missandei and Grey Worm\u2019s clips as well. </p><p>Arya\u2019s inner struggle of being No One or returning to the core of who she was. Jaimie on the path of redemption desperatley trying to restore his name. Missandei and Greyworm dedicated to Daenerys but clearly devoted to each other above all else. These are just a handful of the clips where this theme is present. </p><p>What\u2019s extremely noteable is that as we get a hint into some of the revelation/journeys these other characters will make/face we are completely shut out from some of the most important characters journeys this season. Except for some close up shots of Jon, Dany, Tyrion and Sansa\u2019s facial expressions we really have no indication of their inner struggles, what really matters to them and who they are and that means a lot!!!!!!!!!!  </p><p>We get no clue about their emotional or political journeys other than what the story has led us to believe and expect!
