But after she got wounded. Well_\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You woke up with a fever. You could barely keep your eyes open. That\u2019s when the door to your cell was thrown open. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You attempted to get up but couldn\u2019t. \u201cFire Scout. You need to get up and head to training.\u201d When you didn\u2019t stand up you felt a pair of arms grab your arm dragging you up. Your eyes opened but everything was blurry you looked at the guard who was forcing you up, than your eyes fell to the cell next door. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You saw the Soldier watching you. He was just sitting there. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Your eyes started to close again. That\u2019s when a bucket of water was thrown at your face. You became more aware and a little more awake although you still felt the fever taking it\u2019s tole on you. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You were dragged out of your cell and into the training room where Strucker stood. \u201cFire Scout you disappointed me. But you and the Soldier are continuing to train together. Make sure I don\u2019t find myself disappointed again.\u201d </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Once Strucker finished his little speech. The door was opened. Faustus walked in the Winter Soldier falling behind him. His eyes landed on you. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAlright let\u2019s begin shall we?\u201d Faustus states walking over to Strucker. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You were thrown onto the training mat, while the Soldier walked in his eyes studying you. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cFight!\u201d they yelled. You attempted to fight but it seemed pointless. The Soldier sent a punch your way and you stumbled to block it barely missing his hand. Although you fumbled falling over. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When you got back up your legs still felt weak. You raised your arms though sending a punch. Although it was weak and probably wouldn\u2019t have knocked anything down. </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not doing so well is she.\u201d you heard Faustus state. It made your blood churn you could tell he had a smirk on his face. </p><p>You pulled out one of your Sai daggers attempting to try to salvage something from this fight. But before you could do anything, you stumbled forward. Soon you fell against his Metal arm that seemed to be the only thing to keep you up before you blacked out. </p><p>When you woke up you attempted to sit up only to feel weaker than usual. </p><p>You fell back into your bed groaning slightly. \u201cYou need to eat this.\u201d you looked over to see the Soldier sitting by the bars next to your cell. He held up a bowl. You looked over seeing your own bowl sitting on the table next to your bed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I have my own.\u201d you state trying to sit up. </p><p>\u201cThe amount of food they gave you won\u2019t be enough.\u201d you stared at him before sitting up slowly. </p><p>\u201cYour going to need to eat too.\u201d you say grabbing the bowl next to you. It was broth. You drank it quickly. Putting the bowl down and slowly laying back down. </p><p>\u201cYou need to eat more.\u201d he says making you shake your head. </p><p>He stood up turning and looking at you.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine the fever will pass it\u2019s probably infected or something but don\u2019t worry I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d you state giving him a small nod before you closed your eyes again. </p><p>Although you had hoped that the Fever would pass quickly it seemed only to get worse as time went by. You would go to training get your ass handed to you than come back and sleep. You weren\u2019t getting better but than again you weren\u2019t having much time to heal, and you were barely getting enough food to survive off of let alone heal from. </p><p>You had just gotten back from another training session when you laid down. You could feel your lip start to quiver. You felt like you were freezing cold. </p><p>Soon you heard your door open. You slowly opened your eyes only for them to open widely you watched as the Winter Soldier entered your cell. You got up as fast as you could although your body protested. </p><p>\u201cLay down.\u201d he demanded. </p><p>\u201cNo I\u2019m not going to let you hurt me.\u201d you say getting into a fighting position although your legs shaked. Soon your felt yourself falling. But you never hit the ground the Soldier had caught you. </p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be in here.\u201d you say voice shaking while you shivered. </p><p>\u201cYour burning up.\u201d he stated laying you back down onto your bed. Your eyes started to droop although you forced them to stay open, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Your going to be okay.\u201d </p><p>The next time you woke up you felt something wet on your forehead. You frowned opening your eyes and lifting your hand to your head. You pulled off a wet rag. </p><p>You also looked over to see another bowl of broth. Although this time it had twice as much as normal. You looked around for the Soldier who seemed to be nowhere around. </p><p>You sat up slowly. Grabbing the bowl and spoon your slowly ate it this time. </p><p>When you were half way done your door opened and you felt yourself tense up. You looked up to see the Soldier walk in. He held out a bottle. </p><p>\u201cTake this.\u201d he states making you scowl slightly. </p><p>\u201cWhy do you want to poison me?\u201d you asked. Making him look you straight in the eyes. </p><p>\u201cIF I wanted you dead why would I give you my rations.\u201d once he stated that you looked down at the bowl and your eyes widened. You put the bowl back down on the table. \u00a0\u201cYou need to finish that.\u201d he stated making you shake your head. \u201cI can\u2019t eat it now because if I do I might get sick and you can\u2019t afford to waste that food.\u201d </p><p>You sighed knowing he was right. He grabbed your hand and put the bottle in it. </p><p>\u201cYour fever went down_ for now.\u201d he states turning around and walking out. Soon he entered his own cell, laying down on his bed and falling asleep. </p><p>You finished the broth and studied the bottle. </p><p>You didn\u2019t trust it. You didn\u2019t trust him. Nobody in Hydra was looking out for each other especially not the assassins that Hydra trains. </p><p>You put the bottle on the table laying back down and falling asleep. </p><p>When the next morning came you were woken up abruptly. </p><p>There was sweat drowning your back. </p><p>\u201cPlease follow me.\u201d you got up and your legs shook a little but you followed. </p><p>You entered the arena and they put you into your cage. Soon Viper walked in she studied you before rolling her eyes. </p><p>Next Metalic who seemed to look at you and scoff. Lastly the Soldier walked in. He didn\u2019t look at anybody. He walked into his area and leaned against the wall. </p><p>\u201cOur next contest will be similar to the last. Each asset will be put into the arena and will have to fight off 8 agents. But this time there will be no guns. Although these agents have been specially trained to use knives and swords so it won\u2019t be too hard for them.\u201d </p><p>Soon Vipers gate opened. You watched her shootout but you couldn\u2019t keep your eyes open for long. The next time you opened them she was back in her cage and Metallic was out there. You faded out again. When you opened them again the Soldier was just finishing fighting the agents. Walking over to his cage and walking in. </p><p>Soon your own gate opened. You stood up weakly. </p><p>You walked out stumbling forward slightly. The 8 agents walked in surrounding you. </p><p>\u201cFight!\u201d they yelled and you found yourself going into fight or flight mode. You attempted to fend them off but was unable to. While you tried to stay alert an agent came behind you kicking in your legs from behind. You fell onto your knees. Scrambling to get up. </p><p>Although you were knocked down again. This time from a punch in the stomach you let out a cough before getting up again. Your vision began to blur. </p><p>Soon there was another hit right on your shoulder. You let out a scream as the bullet wound seemed to be set on fire. </p><p>The next moment you heard a loud crash. </p><p>And suddenly all the agents around you were away from you. You looked over to see the Soldier had broken out of his cage and into the arena. His gate had been taken off cleanly. Now lying on the other side of the arena. He fought each agent until they were either on the ground in pain or knocked out. </p><p>Everybody had gone silent. You looked up at the balcony to see all of them standing up in shock. You looked over at Strucker who seemed to be scowling. But then you looked over at Faustus. WHo to yoru surprise was smirking down at you. </p><p>\u201cThat was_ very interesting.\u201d he states\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>Covert:\u00a0<br/><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mR7vawQ6YMOsodFXfGIscZA\">@imboredsueme</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mV0vZa360zgEyDjGQb1BDAw\">@writingsleepless</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIyjAN_NMZO-f4WJWkbcaXQ\">@writing-in-winter</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw6xrGnJAn4U0AtW2CPrwKw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw6xrGnJAn4U0AtW2CPrwKw\">@slender\u2013spirit</a><br/></p>",

But after she got wounded. Well_\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You woke up with a fever. You could barely keep your eyes open. That\u2019s when the door to your cell was thrown open. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You attempted to get up but couldn\u2019t. \u201cFire Scout. You need to get up and head to training.\u201d When you didn\u2019t stand up you felt a pair of arms grab your arm dragging you up. Your eyes opened but everything was blurry you looked at the guard who was forcing you up, than your eyes fell to the cell next door. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You saw the Soldier watching you. He was just sitting there. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Your eyes started to close again. That\u2019s when a bucket of water was thrown at your face. You became more aware and a little more awake although you still felt the fever taking it\u2019s tole on you. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You were dragged out of your cell and into the training room where Strucker stood. \u201cFire Scout you disappointed me. But you and the Soldier are continuing to train together. Make sure I don\u2019t find myself disappointed again.\u201d </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Once Strucker finished his little speech. The door was opened. Faustus walked in the Winter Soldier falling behind him. His eyes landed on you. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAlright let\u2019s begin shall we?\u201d Faustus states walking over to Strucker. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You were thrown onto the training mat, while the Soldier walked in his eyes studying you. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cFight!\u201d they yelled. You attempted to fight but it seemed pointless. The Soldier sent a punch your way and you stumbled to block it barely missing his hand. Although you fumbled falling over. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When you got back up your legs still felt weak. You raised your arms though sending a punch. Although it was weak and probably wouldn\u2019t have knocked anything down. </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not doing so well is she.\u201d you heard Faustus state. It made your blood churn you could tell he had a smirk on his face. </p><p>You pulled out one of your Sai daggers attempting to try to salvage something from this fight. But before you could do anything, you stumbled forward. Soon you fell against his Metal arm that seemed to be the only thing to keep you up before you blacked out. </p><p>When you woke up you attempted to sit up only to feel weaker than usual. </p><p>You fell back into your bed groaning slightly. \u201cYou need to eat this.\u201d you looked over to see the Soldier sitting by the bars next to your cell. He held up a bowl. You looked over seeing your own bowl sitting on the table next to your bed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I have my own.\u201d you state trying to sit up. </p><p>\u201cThe amount of food they gave you won\u2019t be enough.\u201d you stared at him before sitting up slowly. </p><p>\u201cYour going to need to eat too.\u201d you say grabbing the bowl next to you. It was broth. You drank it quickly. Putting the bowl down and slowly laying back down. </p><p>\u201cYou need to eat more.\u201d he says making you shake your head. </p><p>He stood up turning and looking at you.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine the fever will pass it\u2019s probably infected or something but don\u2019t worry I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d you state giving him a small nod before you closed your eyes again. </p><p>Although you had hoped that the Fever would pass quickly it seemed only to get worse as time went by. You would go to training get your ass handed to you than come back and sleep. You weren\u2019t getting better but than again you weren\u2019t having much time to heal, and you were barely getting enough food to survive off of let alone heal from. </p><p>You had just gotten back from another training session when you laid down. You could feel your lip start to quiver. You felt like you were freezing cold. </p><p>Soon you heard your door open. You slowly opened your eyes only for them to open widely you watched as the Winter Soldier entered your cell. You got up as fast as you could although your body protested. </p><p>\u201cLay down.\u201d he demanded. </p><p>\u201cNo I\u2019m not going to let you hurt me.\u201d you say getting into a fighting position although your legs shaked. Soon your felt yourself falling. But you never hit the ground the Soldier had caught you. </p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be in here.\u201d you say voice shaking while you shivered. </p><p>\u201cYour burning up.\u201d he stated laying you back down onto your bed. Your eyes started to droop although you forced them to stay open, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Your going to be okay.\u201d </p><p>The next time you woke up you felt something wet on your forehead. You frowned opening your eyes and lifting your hand to your head. You pulled off a wet rag. </p><p>You also looked over to see another bowl of broth. Although this time it had twice as much as normal. You looked around for the Soldier who seemed to be nowhere around. </p><p>You sat up slowly. Grabbing the bowl and spoon your slowly ate it this time. </p><p>When you were half way done your door opened and you felt yourself tense up. You looked up to see the Soldier walk in. He held out a bottle. </p><p>\u201cTake this.\u201d he states making you scowl slightly. </p><p>\u201cWhy do you want to poison me?\u201d you asked. Making him look you straight in the eyes. </p><p>\u201cIF I wanted you dead why would I give you my rations.\u201d once he stated that you looked down at the bowl and your eyes widened. You put the bowl back down on the table. \u00a0\u201cYou need to finish that.\u201d he stated making you shake your head. \u201cI can\u2019t eat it now because if I do I might get sick and you can\u2019t afford to waste that food.\u201d </p><p>You sighed knowing he was right. He grabbed your hand and put the bottle in it. </p><p>\u201cYour fever went down_ for now.\u201d he states turning around and walking out. Soon he entered his own cell, laying down on his bed and falling asleep. </p><p>You finished the broth and studied the bottle. </p><p>You didn\u2019t trust it. You didn\u2019t trust him. Nobody in Hydra was looking out for each other especially not the assassins that Hydra trains. </p><p>You put the bottle on the table laying back down and falling asleep. </p><p>When the next morning came you were woken up abruptly. </p><p>There was sweat drowning your back. </p><p>\u201cPlease follow me.\u201d you got up and your legs shook a little but you followed. </p><p>You entered the arena and they put you into your cage. Soon Viper walked in she studied you before rolling her eyes. </p><p>Next Metalic who seemed to look at you and scoff. Lastly the Soldier walked in. He didn\u2019t look at anybody. He walked into his area and leaned against the wall. </p><p>\u201cOur next contest will be similar to the last. Each asset will be put into the arena and will have to fight off 8 agents. But this time there will be no guns. Although these agents have been specially trained to use knives and swords so it won\u2019t be too hard for them.\u201d </p><p>Soon Vipers gate opened. You watched her shootout but you couldn\u2019t keep your eyes open for long. The next time you opened them she was back in her cage and Metallic was out there. You faded out again. When you opened them again the Soldier was just finishing fighting the agents. Walking over to his cage and walking in. </p><p>Soon your own gate opened. You stood up weakly. </p><p>You walked out stumbling forward slightly. The 8 agents walked in surrounding you. </p><p>\u201cFight!\u201d they yelled and you found yourself going into fight or flight mode. You attempted to fend them off but was unable to. While you tried to stay alert an agent came behind you kicking in your legs from behind. You fell onto your knees. Scrambling to get up. </p><p>Although you were knocked down again. This time from a punch in the stomach you let out a cough before getting up again. Your vision began to blur. </p><p>Soon there was another hit right on your shoulder. You let out a scream as the bullet wound seemed to be set on fire. </p><p>The next moment you heard a loud crash. </p><p>And suddenly all the agents around you were away from you. You looked over to see the Soldier had broken out of his cage and into the arena. His gate had been taken off cleanly. Now lying on the other side of the arena. He fought each agent until they were either on the ground in pain or knocked out. </p><p>Everybody had gone silent. You looked up at the balcony to see all of them standing up in shock. You looked over at Strucker who seemed to be scowling. But then you looked over at Faustus. WHo to yoru surprise was smirking down at you. </p><p>\u201cThat was_ very interesting.\u201d he states\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>Covert:\u00a0<br><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mR7vawQ6YMOsodFXfGIscZA\">@imboredsueme</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mV0vZa360zgEyDjGQb1BDAw\">@writingsleepless</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIyjAN_NMZO-f4WJWkbcaXQ\">@writing-in-winter</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw6xrGnJAn4U0AtW2CPrwKw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw6xrGnJAn4U0AtW2CPrwKw\">@slender\u2013spirit</a><br></p></p>",
