Ruling.\u201d</b></p><p>-\u00a0<b>Sansa\nStark, 7x01</b></p></blockquote><p>According to antis, this was Sansa attempting to\nguilt Jon into taking her advice by comparing him to Joffrey, and then course\ncorrecting to complimenting him when she realized that manipulation strategy\nwouldn\u2019t work. \u00a0Once again there\u2019s no\nevidence to suggest Sansa had a strategic plan to trick Jon into changing his\nopinion to hers. \u00a0The only two reasonable\nexplanations as to why Sansa compares Jon to Joffrey in this scene \u2013 (1 -\nDoylist) because D&amp;D don\u2019t understand her character and feel the need to\ninsert pointless drama wherever possible and (2 \u2013 Watsonian) because she\u2019s an\nextreme trauma survivor who\u2019s still working through her PTSD and learning to\ntrust the people around her again, especially the men. \u00a0She loves Jon and has no reason to manipulate\nhim rather than be honest with him. \u00a0The reason\nshe\u2019s quick to compliment him after comparing him to Joffrey is because she\nsees she\u2019s wounded him, since he holds her opinion so highly, and does her best\nto let him know how deeply she respects and admires him. \u00a0Once again it\u2019s only possible to see calculated\nexploitation in Sansa\u2019s actions if you\u2019re projecting ill-intent where there is none.</p><p>Though the show provides plenty of evidence that\nSansa\u2019s clever and politically savvy but still kind and self-sacrificing, GRRM\nhas gone to even further lengths to show this in the books:</p><blockquote><p><b>\u201cHe\nsquatted silently before her, a hulking black shape shrouded in the night,\nhidden from her eyes. Sansa could hear his ragged breathing. She was sad for\nhim, she realized. Somehow, the fear had gone away.\u201d</b></p><p>-\u00a0<b>Sansa\nII, A Game Of Thrones</b></p></blockquote><p>This encounter with the Hound shows Sansa\u2019s ability\nto empathize with anyone, no matter how threatening she finds them. \u00a0Extreme capacity for empathy isn\u2019t exactly a\nquality found in master manipulators.</p><blockquote><p><b>\u201cThe\nking stood. \u2018A cask from the cellars! I&rsquo;ll see him drowned in it.\u2019</b></p><p><b>Sansa\nheard herself gasp. \u2018No, you can&rsquo;t.\u2019</b></p><p><b>Joffrey\nturned his head. \u2018What did you say?\u2019&quot;</b></p><p>-\u00a0<b>Sansa\nI, A Clash Of Kings</b></p></blockquote><p>Sansa risks her life to safe a drunken fool. \u00a0She is consistently self-sacrificial, even\nwhile being held hostage by the family who murdered her father and abuses her\nconstantly.</p><blockquote><p><b>&ldquo;\u2019Mya\nwill keep the mules from biting,\u2019 Alayne said, \u2018and I&rsquo;ll be riding just behind\nyou. I&rsquo;m only a girl, not as brave or strong as you. If I can do it, I know you\ncan, Sweetrobin.\u2019&rdquo;</b></p><p>-\u00a0<b>Alayne\nII, A Feast For Crows</b></p></blockquote><p>All throughout her time in the Eyrie, Sansa cares\nfor Sweetrobin while no one else will, and even has genuine sympathy for him. \u00a0Again \u2013 not behavior often found in a\nLittlefinger-esque political operator.</p><p>There are countless more examples of Sansa\u2019s\nnon-manipulative nature in both the show and the books. \u00a0If you actually take the time to understand\nher character, it\u2019s easy to see how clever but kind she is \u2013 the perfect\ncombination of Stark honor and political intelligence that\u2019s needed to rule a\nkingdom.</p>",

Adopting the unsourceable accent Crystal uses opposite Meg Ryan in a famously improvised scene filmed in this very room, Clarke starts stuttering, \u201cPah-pah-paprikash.\u201d Our amused if bewildered guide, too young to get the reference, adds the 1989 rom-com to her list of movie recommendations from Clarke, who has already gushed about the 2017 religious drama Novitiate. Chuckling over this unlikely double feature, Clarke assures her, \u201cYou have two incredible movies coming your way.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>One reference the guide does get: Game of Thrones, the HBO juggernaut which stars Clarke as its most unstoppable heroine, Daenerys Targaryen. In fact, the very tour we\u2019re taking, put together by a company called Museum Hack, is based on the series, and offers a fan-friendly survey of the sometimes inscrutable displays of the Met. You don\u2019t have to be an art historian (our guide is an aspiring actress) to understand what Greek fire, Damascus blades, heraldry, mutilated men, samurai kamon, the dragon-born St. Margaret of Antioch, and an early female pharaoh have to do with wildfire, Valyrian steel, house words, and Clarke\u2019s world-famous alter ego.</p>\n<div class=\"su-expand su-expand-collapsed su-expand-link-style-button\" data-height=\"70\"><div class=\"su-expand-content\" style=\"color:#AAA5A5;max-height:70px;overflow:hidden\">And yet, despite her fame, Clarke has managed to spend a full half-hour in the museum sponging up our guide\u2019s trivia without being spotted. For years, Clarke\u2019s brown hair let her hide in plain sight, but she recently bleached it an icy Targaryen blond. So, why the invisibility? Maybe it\u2019s her height. \u201cWe both have a thing about our stature not quite being what people expect,\u201d says her co-star Kit Harington, who, at five feet eight, has six inches on Clarke. Maybe it\u2019s her outfit\u2014the gray overcoat, cream sweater, and jeans are a far cry from the cloaks and armor of Thrones. Or maybe it\u2019s her bright, decidedly non-intimidating personality. \u201cWhen I\u2019m goofing around with my pals, I\u2019m unrecognizable,\u201d she says. Harington calls Clarke\u2019s humor \u201cnaughty,\u201d and it\u2019s certainly true that her informal, expletive-laced banter is a far cry from Daenerys\u2019s imperious tones. \u201cSometimes, if I\u2019m in a really bad mood,\u201d Clarke notes, \u201cpeople are like, \u2018Khaleesi!\u2019 \u201d\n\n<p>Finally, the spell of anonymity breaks, thanks to a display of competitiveness worthy of Game of Thrones. Our guide has challenged us to photograph as many birds and dragons as we can find in the paintings and sculptures on the tour, and Clarke is approaching the task with her usual effervescent zeal. Standing in the shadow of a stone Hatshepsut, one of patriarchal Egypt\u2019s first female pharaohs, she triumphantly displays one of the winged targets she has captured on her phone. \u201cThis little birdie: Boom!\u201d she shouts, her voice ricocheting off the stone walls. A pair of young men look over, then descend, and, in thick French accents, ask for a photo. Clarke\u2019s triumphant grin tightens into a polite, distant smile.</p>\n\n<p>There it is: the face of Daenerys of the House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, the Unburnt, Queen of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons, who, over the course of seven seasons, has climbed from powerless pawn to resolute conqueror, forcing one rival after another to \u201cbend the knee\u201d or burn. As Daenerys has risen, so has Clarke, morphing from a struggling actress and part-time cater waiter to an international superstar and symbol of feminine fierceness. That journey is \u201cimportant and inspiring\u2014particularly now, in our climate,\u201d says her close friend Rose Leslie, who played the wildling warrior Ygritte in early seasons of Game of Thrones. \u201cShe\u2019s at the forefront of representing independent women.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>We still don\u2019t know if, as many expect, Daenerys Targaryen will win the right to rule the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, but we can be assured that Emilia Clarke will hang up her platinum wig for good when Game of Thrones ends its eight-season run, in 2019. There\u2019s still a lot of filming and post-production work to be done, but Clarke has already shot her character\u2019s final on-screen moments. \u201cIt fucked me up,\u201d she says. \u201cKnowing that is going to be a lasting flavor in someone\u2019s mouth of what Daenerys is &hellip;\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Clarke has good reason to feel unsettled. Letting go of a culture-defining television role can be liberating, to be sure, but it can also be deflating\u2014or worse. Jon Hamm may always be seen as Don Draper; Sarah Michelle Gellar is forever Buffy the Vampire Slayer; Jennifer Aniston will never not be Rachel. Fortunately, Clarke approaches this pivotal transition with a stubborn insistence on behaving like a normal, grounded human being. And her upcoming credits suggest that she\u2019s greatly in demand beyond Westeros.</p>\n\n<p>This month, Clarke, a self-described \u201cachievement junkie,\u201d joins the rapidly expanding Star Wars universe in Solo, a highly scrutinized origin story for Harrison Ford\u2019s Han Solo. Her well-honed gift for concealing every detail about her work\u2014\u201cEverything in my life is a spoiler,\u201d she says\u2014helped her get into character. Director Ron Howard, a Game of Thrones fan, explains that Qi\u2019ra, Han Solo\u2019s childhood friend turned unreliable ally, is secretive, slippery, and morally questionable\u2014\u201ca much different sort of a character\u201d from Daenerys.</p>\n\n<p>If Solo becomes a major hit, it will give Clarke a rare chance to leap cleanly from one spectacularly successful genre franchise to another. But even if it doesn\u2019t, she has no shortage of options. An active participant in Time\u2019s Up, she has ambitious plans to write and produce her own material\u2014and create new opportunities for other women in the industry. Discussing those issues, she begins to sound more like the fiery Daenerys. \u201cIt becomes harder to separate you from the role when you\u2019ve been with it so long,\u201d she admits.</p>\n\n<p>Eight years ago, Dan Weiss and David Benioff were in trouble. Their pilot for Game of Thrones, an adaptation of George R. R. Martin\u2019s popular A Song of Ice and Fire book series, was a disaster. Along with re-shoots, the pair were looking to re-cast a few key roles, including the pivotal part of Daenerys Targaryen. Tall, willowy, and fair-haired, Tamzin Merchant, the actress originally cast as Khaleesi, was a far more conventional match for the character on the page. The second time around, Weiss and Benioff took a fresh look at the character.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cEmilia was the only person we saw\u2014and we saw hundreds\u2014who could carry the full range that Daenerys required,\u201d the pair explained in tandem via e-mail. \u201cYoung actors aren\u2019t often asked to play a combination of Joan of Arc, Lawrence of Arabia, and Napoleon.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>When Clarke started on the series, Daenerys was downtrodden, occasionally objectified, and stranded in a subplot that kept the character geographically distant from the main story and the actress isolated from most of her co-stars. \u201cI was cut off from the rest of the cast,\u201d Clarke says. Over the years, as the famously cutthroat Thrones has thinned its sprawling ensemble, Clarke has risen in the ranks, snagging the show\u2019s flashiest, most empowering moments.</p>\n\n<p>In an era when network and streaming platforms alike are struggling to get anyone to tune in, Game of Thrones has become one of the last surviving holdovers from the must-see TV era. For a handful of weeks every year, HBO owns Sunday nights, with devotees watching live to avoid spoilers at the office Monday morning. Clearing its own very high ratings bar, Thrones commanded an average of 32.8 million viewers in its 2017 season. Its 38 wins make it the most-awarded scripted-TV series in Emmy history.</p>\n\n<p>That glaring spotlight has made Daenerys a cultural touchstone\u2014not to mention a costume-party staple, with Madonna, Katy Perry, Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian, and Kristen Bell among her many famous impersonators. At a recent charity auction, Brad Pitt offered six figures to spend an evening with Clarke and Harington, only to be outbid. Last year, Daenerys finally powered into the heart of the series, earning long-awaited screen time with Harington and the rest of the surviving stars. Clarke, who has been nominated three times for best supporting actress at the Emmys, may soon be gunning for lead honors. \u201cEverything in my life is a spoiler,\u201d Clarke says.</p>\n\n<p>Clarke\u2019s upbringing in the bucolic countryside an hour outside of London couldn\u2019t be farther from the dysfunctional family dynamics that forged the orphaned Daenerys. Emilia\u2019s mother, Jennifer, is a businesswoman who currently runs the Anima Foundation, a charity aimed at raising awareness of specialty brain-injury care, and her father, Peter, was a theatrical sound engineer who prized education above all else. \u201cYour bookshelf should be bigger than your TV,\u201d he liked to remind Emilia and her older brother, Bennett. \u201cMy mum, my brother, my dad, and I would sit around a table, and my happiest place was just discussing stuff,\u201d Emilia says. \u201cI really value intelligence. I\u2019m one of the very fortunate few people who really likes their family. I just like hanging out with them.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Clarke isn\u2019t the first woman in her family to engage in high-stakes identity juggling. Her maternal grandmother wore light makeup to disguise the fact that she was half Indian, owing to her mother\u2019s very secret affair with a mysterious man from the colonial subcontinent. \u201cThe fact that [my grandmother] had to hide her skin color, essentially, and try desperately to fit in with everyone else must\u2019ve been incredibly difficult,\u201d Clarke says. \u201cSo, yeah: history of fighters.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Emilia\u2019s parents saved up to send her to a pair of upper-crust boarding schools\u2014Rye St. Antony and St. Edward\u2019s, both in Oxford\u2014but she never felt at home with her much wealthier classmates. \u201cI didn\u2019t really fit in, like everybody who ever went to school ever.\u201d So she channeled her energy into performing. She was rejected the first time she applied to acting school, but eventually Drama Centre London claimed her from the waiting list when another student broke her leg and dropped out. There, she finally found the \u201cartistically inclined\u201d friends who would keep her grounded amid the circus of international fame.</p>\n\n<p>The jet-setting Clarke clings tightly to her roots even as her life and career take her ever farther from the Home Counties. For one thing, she recently got her brother a gig in the Thrones camera department. \u201cThis job can be so alienating,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re in a trailer by yourself. You\u2019re in a car by yourself. You\u2019re in a plane. You\u2019re in a plane. You\u2019re in a plane. That\u2019s what success looks like if you\u2019re an actor. Success looks like being alone.\u201d Clarke stays sharp by devouring \u201cnerdy\u201d podcasts on a range of topics from politics to science. \u201cShe\u2019s so informed,\u201d says Rose Leslie. \u201cShe has an opinion on every topic.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Clarke\u2019s father passed away in 2016 after a long battle with cancer. At the time, Emilia was in the U.S. shooting the upcoming thriller Above Suspicion and couldn\u2019t break away to say her final good-byes. \u201cIt still sucks. Grief sucks. He doesn\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing now,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s it before I start crying.\u201d After a couple of romances with famous men\u2014first, Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane, then, reportedly, actor Jai Courtney, a brief souvenir from her Terminator Genisys shoot\u2014Clarke swore off dating actors. In fact, she hasn\u2019t been romantically linked in some time. When Solo premiered at Cannes, in May, she had hoped to walk the red carpet with her brother, and her goal in general is to keep her relationships out of the news. \u201cThe guys that I\u2019ve met in my life that are dicks, I voluntarily walk the fuck away from them,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s just bad taste. People shouldn\u2019t know about those choices.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Clarke usually appears in public with various non-famous \u201cmates\u201d from her drama-school days. Her \u201cperma-plus-one\u201d is Lola Frears, daughter of director Stephen Frears. \u201cI ain\u2019t got me no celebrity friends,\u201d Clarke says. \u201cMy squad? They don\u2019t let me get away with anything. There\u2019s not a lot of actors I relate to.\u201d Leslie, a rare exception to Emilia\u2019s rule, confirms that Clarke\u2019s longtime friends keep her in check: \u201cThere would be a ticking off or a bollocking if they felt she was no longer the lovely lady that they have always known.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The Star Wars tradition of featuring morally upright heroines, among them Carrie Fisher\u2019s General Leia, Daisy Ridley\u2019s Rey, and Felicity Jones\u2019s Jyn Erso, was part of what drew Emilia Clarke to the role of Qi\u2019ra in Solo, but it was the chance to break the mold that really sold her. \u201cWe\u2019re going to hit you with a character that could very easily well be a dude, because you question her motives,\u201d she says, sitting in a back corner of the Met\u2019s no-frills cafeteria snacking on a pear and sipping English-breakfast tea from a paper cup. \u201cThat\u2019s really fucking exciting in the Star Wars universe, because that has never happened.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Before accepting the Solo role, Clarke had to ask Game of Thrones show-runners Weiss and Benioff for permission to complicate their plans for a final season by adding a demanding Star Wars filming schedule to the mix. They didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cSolo felt like a great fit that would let her show off her versatility,\u201d Weiss and Benioff explained. \u201cAlso, we figured she\u2019d probably get to shoot a ray gun. Ray guns are something we just can\u2019t offer, unfortunately.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Swapping dragons for ray guns, Emilia Clarke was eager to prove her mettle in a whole new galaxy. But that plan hit a snag when the Solo production fell spectacularly and publicly apart. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna lie,\u201d Clarke says. \u201cI struggled with Qi\u2019ra quite a lot. I was like: \u2018Y\u2019all need to stop telling me that she\u2019s \u201cfilm noir,\u201d because that ain\u2019t a note.\u2019 \u201d Frustrated by the lack of direction, she turned to Solo\u2019s father-and-son screenwriters, Lawrence and Jon Kasdan, for support. Then, four and a half months into shooting, co-directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller exited the project, citing \u201ccreative differences.\u201d Production was put on hold until they were replaced by Ron Howard, a longtime friend of franchise creator George Lucas\u2019s. With a brand-new director and an ambitious re-shoot schedule\u2014Clarke reluctantly agrees when I call those first months \u201ca high-budget dress rehearsal\u201d\u2014Solo still had to hit its opening date, in May of the following year.</p>\n\n<p>Clarke says Howard\u2019s arrival \u201csaved\u201d the movie: \u201cAll hail to [Lucasfilm president] Kathy [Kennedy] for hiring Ron.\u201d Slipping into a mocking impression of herself, Clarke re-enacts a self-pitying therapy session with Howard over a private meal they shared before resuming production. \u201cHe even feigned enthusiasm!\u201d she says. \u201cI know for a fact he had that discussion with everybody. I think we all came to set feeling like his favorite. It makes for a really happy load of actors, with our egos.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Howard recalls that dinner a bit differently. The former child star of The Andy Griffith Show saw in Clarke \u201cthe kind of pragmatism and a can-do spirit that often comes from people who have cut their teeth doing television.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI know some of how tough it was for her,\u201d Harington says. \u201cBut she\u2019s pretty tough as well.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Clarke wasn\u2019t privy to everything that led up to the director swap, but she wasn\u2019t entirely surprised, either. \u201cWhen it comes to that amount of money, you\u2019re almost waiting for that to happen. Money fucks us all up, doesn\u2019t it? There\u2019s so much pressure. Han Solo is a really beloved character. This is a really important movie for the franchise as a whole. It\u2019s a shit ton of money. A shit ton of people. A shit ton of expectations.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Solo wasn\u2019t the first troubled blockbuster to test Clarke\u2019s resilience. If anything, the production of 2015\u2019s Terminator Genisys was more chaotic. She watched frequent Thrones director Alan Taylor get \u201ceaten and chewed up on Terminator. He was not the director I remembered. He didn\u2019t have a good time. No one had a good time.\u201d When the film underperformed at the box office, she was \u201crelieved\u201d to not have to return for any sequels. News of the rocky production traveled, and Clarke says the crew on the famously disastrous Fantastic Four, which was filming nearby, even had jackets made that read, AT LEAST WE\u2019RE NOT ON TERMINATOR. \u201cJust to give you a summary,\u201d she says, laughing.</p>\n\n<p>Rumors spreading between film sets is one thing, but the Solo tumult was covered exhaustively in the trades and on fan sites, adding another layer of pressure to an already pressurized project. \u201cI hope we did it good, then, because people have all this gossip,\u201d Clarke says. \u201cI don\u2019t want people to go, \u2018That\u2019s the bit where it all went wrong. That\u2019s the bit, I know it.\u2019 I just really hope that people have a good time, that it\u2019s good, and, you know, selfishly, that I\u2019m not shit and that people don\u2019t write reviews going, \u2018Oh my God, that\u2019s, like, the worst acting I\u2019ve ever seen in my life. Wow. How did they give her the part?\u2019 \u201d</p>\n\n<p>For all her anxieties about how her performance will go over, Clarke and I are both energized by the Solo footage we\u2019ve seen. Clarke\u2019s easy chemistry with Donald Glover, who plays fan favorite Lando Calrissian, is evident from their very first on-screen meeting. And though her shifting allegiances mean she has to play a range of emotions opposite Alden Ehrenreich\u2019s Han Solo, she endows every twist with an undercurrent of romantic possibility. Tonally closer to the Indiana Jones movies than to, say, Rogue One, Solo marks the franchise\u2019s return to lighthearted, fast-paced capers.</p>\n\n<p>Clarke\u2014who spends most Thrones battles on the backs of her C.G.I. dragons\u2014was eager to jump into the fray with some hand-to-hand combat. \u201cShe had to deal with quite a large sword and some pretty elaborate fight choreography, and she made it look easy,\u201d Ehrenreich says. With all the re-shoots and reconfigured plotting, she also had to fight to keep some of her favorite moments in. \u201cThat is going to be badass as fuck,\u201d she told the filmmakers of a showstopping Qi\u2019ra moment that made the cut. \u201cDon\u2019t forget your audience.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Long before they shared a scene together, Clarke and Harington had become friends thanks to their time on the Game of Thrones promotional circuit. It was through Harington that Clarke met Rose Leslie. An adept mimic, Clarke impersonates a \u201csmitten\u201d Harington mooning over his on-screen lover and future real-life fianc\u00e9e in the early days of the show: \u201cThere\u2019s the best human in the world. She\u2019s called Rose.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Clarke has a teasing relationship with Harington. \u201cI\u2019ll tell him, \u2018Kit, stop being a dick\u2014stop being so grumpy.\u2019 Like I would with my brother.\u201d And as the two transition in these final seasons from real-life friends to partners in TV\u2019s biggest romance (albeit one complicated by incest), the ribbing has only increased. \u201cIf you\u2019ve known someone for six years, and they\u2019re best friends with your girlfriend, and you\u2019re best friends with them,\u201d Harington says, \u201cthere is something unnatural and strange about doing a love scene. We\u2019ll end up kissing and then we\u2019re just pissing ourselves with laughter because it\u2019s so ridiculous.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s goofy,\u201d Weiss and Benioff confirm. \u201cWe have tried to let some of Emilia\u2019s humor and light seep into Daenerys whenever possible. Who says conquerors can\u2019t be funny?\u201d A memorable Season Four conversation between Daenerys and her right-hand woman, Missandei, concerning a eunuch\u2019s \u201cpillar and stones,\u201d for instance, is much more Clarke than Targaryen. Sadly, it\u2019s unclear how much space there will be in the show\u2019s climactic final season for bawdy, Clarke-ish humor. \u201cI\u2019m doing all this weird shit,\u201d Clarke says. \u201cYou\u2019ll know what I mean when you see it.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In the final episodes of a show with a body count as high as Game of Thrones\u2019, Clarke never really knows when she might be filming her last moments with a member of the cast. She\u2019s also shooting for the first time with several of the show\u2019s top stars, including Sophie Turner and Maisie Williams, who play the formidable Stark sisters.</p>\n\n<p>Clarke is well aware that the strong women of the series are leaving some kind of imprint on the culture, but she\u2019s saving up all her big-picture reflections on Daenerys for later: \u201cThis is going to be a Band-Aid that I\u2019m going to rip off.\u201d To help with that process, she started keeping a daily journal of her last season. With cell phones banned from the set due to security concerns, it\u2019s her best hope of chronicling the final days of Daenerys. Selfies are off limits, but Clarke has asked set photographer Helen Sloan to snap the occasional behind-the-scenes photo. Both the journal and the photos, Clarke hints, may be available to the show\u2019s fans someday.</p>\n\n<p>Clarke is unsurprisingly, and contractually, evasive when it comes to specifics of the concluding six episodes. Heavy hints in the most recent season indicate that, in addition to contending with the usual climactic end-of-the-world crises, Daenerys will also be grappling with more intimate parenthood and family issues. Here, Clarke and her on-screen alter ego may have something in common. Friends like Leslie and Harington are settling down to build their own families (\u201cTheir wedding is going to be siiiiick,\u201d Clarke says), and an old schoolmate recently made Clarke godmother to a highly photogenic baby boy who makes regular appearances on her Instagram account. She lights up when talking about him.</p>\n\n<p>Talking about her own parents evokes other emotions. The wounds from the loss of her father are still fresh, but her mother remains an inspiration. If all goes according to plan, it\u2019s Jennifer Clarke who will provide the map for Clarke\u2019s very first post-Thrones steps. After the show ends, Clarke plans to re-create a road trip her mother took in 1972 to Yosemite and the redwoods of Northern California. With best friend and scriptwriter Lola Frears by her side, Clarke intends to spend part of the trip working on ideas for new projects. Her agents offered to take these ideas to \u201cguys\u201d with writing experience, but her answer to that was pure Daenerys: \u201cNo, I\u2019m going to take it to me.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Citing Reese Witherspoon, Greta Gerwig, and other actresses turned creators as inspiration, Clarke says she wants to work with as many female filmmakers as she can. As for the conventional industry wisdom that women can\u2019t work together without infighting? \u201cIt\u2019s fucking bullshit. It\u2019s so annoying.\u201d An active member of Time\u2019s Up, Clarke negotiated with Weiss and Benioff in 2014 to ensure she maintained parity with her male counterparts. She and four co-stars\u2014Harington, Lena Headey (Cersei Lannister), Peter Dinklage (Tyrion Lannister), and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Jaime Lannister)\u2014reportedly each landed $300,000 per episode, a dazzling figure that skyrocketed to half a million per episode for the final two seasons. \u201cI get fucking paid the same as my guy friends,\u201d Clarke says. \u201cWe made sure of that.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And while Clarke would be thrilled to have her own Lady Bird or Big Little Lies, that\u2019s not all she\u2019s after. She says she\u2019s \u201cdesperate\u201d to make documentaries and shine a light on underserved causes. \u201cThat\u2019s the shit that gets me going personally.\u201d Inspired by her father\u2019s cancer ordeal, Clarke is especially passionate about the risks Brexit poses to the U.K.\u2019s National Health Service, and she was recently named ambassador to the Royal College of Nursing. \u201cThat\u2019s something I have in common with Dae-nerys,\u201d she says suddenly, after several hours of explaining all the reasons she and her character are nothing alike. \u201cI really feel for people and I want to help them. Not to sound too much like Oprah Winfrey.\u201d She pauses, and thinks again. \u201cFuck that, I\u2019m gonna sound like Oprah and I\u2019m going to be proud of it.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In the midst of the twin tornadoes of Star Wars and Game of Thrones, Clarke acknowledges that most of her choices these days are \u201cstudio choices.\u201d And if Solo is a hit, Clarke could be working for Lucasfilm for years to come. But Harington sees something else in her future: \u201cShe\u2019s done, far more than me or most people in the cast, these very high-budget, big-hitting blockbusters. Hopefully Star Wars continues for her and she does more of them. But I think she\u2019s an incredibly talented actor, and I would love to see her do something which is a more focused character piece, because the ones she\u2019s done are brilliant.\u201d Clarke\u2019s effervescent performance in 2016\u2019s romantic weepy Me Before You\u2014a surprise hit at the box office\u2014hints at what she\u2019s capable of.</p>\n\n<p>Clarke wants to stretch herself, and explore a new-media landscape where creators no longer have to rely on large companies in order to get their projects made. \u201cEveryone can. Get your iPhone out. Let\u2019s do something. You know what I mean?\u201d And with 17 million followers on Instagram, Clarke has the power to make and launch her own projects. Her recent Thrones-themed fund-raising Instagram video for the Royal College of Nursing Foundation racked up more than seven million views in just three days.</p>\n\n<p>All that takes some of the heat off Clarke as she decides how to follow up roles in two of entertainment\u2019s biggest franchises. She doesn\u2019t necessarily need another monster hit. She can afford to take her time, listen to herself, and do something that feels true to who she is\u2014whoever that may be.</p>\n\n<p>The most obvious evidence of the blur between Daenerys and Clarke is the relatively new shock of blond hair on her head. \u201cI did this, which was frigging stupid,\u201d she says, fingering the blunt-cut ends of her bleached hair.</p>\n\n<p>When Kit Harington trimmed his famous curls in 2015, fans were led to believe his character, presumed dead, wouldn\u2019t be returning to the show the following season. (He did.) But Clarke swears her decision to go blonde has nothing at all to do with Daenerys\u2019s fate. \u201cI got to a point where I said I just want to look in the mirror and see something different. So I was just like, \u2018Fuck it, it\u2019s the last season. I\u2019m going to dye my hair blond.\u2019 \u201d Clarke jokes that she immediately felt remorse and bought nine baseball caps online. \u201cBut they don\u2019t go with your outfit, so I don\u2019t wear them.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Clarke\u2019s brown hair had always been her shield. The blond hair makes it harder to slip back into her pre-fame life. Partying with her old friends is tricky because their friends get \u201cweird\u201d about it, and she misses the mundane pleasures of, say, running errands for her mother. \u201cWhat I get most heartbroken about is that those opportunities are almost completely gone.\u201d Then she catches herself, and apologizes for moaning about the \u201cchampagne problems\u201d of fame. \u201cIf I were reading this, I\u2019d be like, \u2018Cheer the fuck up, love.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n\n<p>Back underneath that statue at the Met, Emilia Clarke cranes her neck up to get a closer look at the ancient pharaoh\u2019s smooth granite face. Hatshepsut wears a false beard that allowed her to pass more easily through the male-dominated world. Our guide points out a faint piece of carved string running up the pharaoh\u2019s jawline holding the disguise in place. Thinking about it later, Clarke, who knows a thing or two about disguises, passing, alter egos, and powerful women, shakes her head in astonishment. \u201cThat is some fascinating shit right there.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>A towering granite Daenerys statue may never find its way into the hallowed halls of the Met, but it\u2019s not clear Emilia Clarke wants that anyway. As we duck out of the Met a bit behind schedule, only to find that it\u2019s raining and our sleek hired car is nowhere in sight, Clarke gamely suggests we rush out into the downpour and dive into the back of a yellow cab. Our driver doesn\u2019t recognize Clarke, either, which puts her at ease. Unsure how to get to where we\u2019re going, he passes his smartphone to her so she can type the hotel\u2019s address into his G.P.S. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, mate,\u201d she announces. \u201cYour little app will get us there!\u201d A satisfied smile plays on her face as the taxi twists, turns, and bumps along. She looks happier than she ever has riding a dragon.</p></div><div class=\"su-expand-link su-expand-link-more\" style=\"text-align:left\"><a href=\"javascript:;\" style=\"color:#E3C4C4;border-color:#E3C4C4\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i>Read the rest of the article</a></div><div class=\"su-expand-link su-expand-link-less\" style=\"text-align:left\"><a href=\"javascript:;\" style=\"color:#E3C4C4;border-color:#E3C4C4\">Show less</a></div></div>\n\n<p></p><center><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NZuzudfcsek\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></center><center></center><center></center><center><img src=\"http://emilia-clarke.com/gallery/albums/Photoshoots/111-2018-VanityFairSummer/thumb_002.jpg\"/><img src=\"http://emilia-clarke.com/gallery/albums/Photoshoots/111-2018-VanityFairSummer/thumb_003.jpg\"/><img src=\"http://emilia-clarke.com/gallery/albums/Photoshoots/111-2018-VanityFairSummer/thumb_004.jpg\"/><img src=\"http://emilia-clarke.com/gallery/albums/Magazines/2018/2018-VanityFair-Summer/thumb_001.jpg\"/></center>\u00a0\n<p><strong>Gallery Links:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>PHOTOSHOOTS &amp; OUTTAKES &gt; <a href=\"http://emilia-clarke.com/gallery/thumbnails.php?album=997\"><strong>2018 Vanity Fair Magazine</strong></a></li>\n<li>MAGAZINES &gt; 2018 &gt; <a href=\"http://emilia-clarke.com/gallery/thumbnails.php?album=1002\"><strong>2018 Vanity Fair \u2013 Summer</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"tumblr-crosspostr-linkback\"><a href=\"http://emilia-clarke.com/news/2139-press-gallery-emilia-clarke-solo-flight/\" title=\"Go to the original post.\" rel=\"bookmark\">Press/Gallery: Emilia Clarke Solo Flight</a> was originally published on <a href=\"http://emilia-clarke.com\">Enchanting Emilia Clarke</a></p>",

Adopting the unsourceable accent Crystal uses opposite Meg Ryan in a famously improvised scene filmed in this very room, Clarke starts stuttering, \u201cPah-pah-paprikash.\u201d Our amused if bewildered guide, too young to get the reference, adds the 1989 rom-com to her list of movie recommendations from Clarke, who has already gushed about the 2017 religious drama Novitiate. Chuckling over this unlikely double feature, Clarke assures her, \u201cYou have two incredible movies coming your way.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>One reference the guide does get: Game of Thrones, the HBO juggernaut which stars Clarke as its most unstoppable heroine, Daenerys Targaryen. In fact, the very tour we\u2019re taking, put together by a company called Museum Hack, is based on the series, and offers a fan-friendly survey of the sometimes inscrutable displays of the Met. You don\u2019t have to be an art historian (our guide is an aspiring actress) to understand what Greek fire, Damascus blades, heraldry, mutilated men, samurai kamon, the dragon-born St. Margaret of Antioch, and an early female pharaoh have to do with wildfire, Valyrian steel, house words, and Clarke\u2019s world-famous alter ego.</p>\n<div class=\"su-expand su-expand-collapsed su-expand-link-style-button\" data-height=\"70\"><div class=\"su-expand-content\" style=\"color:#AAA5A5;max-height:70px;overflow:hidden\">And yet, despite her fame, Clarke has managed to spend a full half-hour in the museum sponging up our guide\u2019s trivia without being spotted. For years, Clarke\u2019s brown hair let her hide in plain sight, but she recently bleached it an icy Targaryen blond. So, why the invisibility? Maybe it\u2019s her height. \u201cWe both have a thing about our stature not quite being what people expect,\u201d says her co-star Kit Harington, who, at five feet eight, has six inches on Clarke. Maybe it\u2019s her outfit\u2014the gray overcoat, cream sweater, and jeans are a far cry from the cloaks and armor of Thrones. Or maybe it\u2019s her bright, decidedly non-intimidating personality. \u201cWhen I\u2019m goofing around with my pals, I\u2019m unrecognizable,\u201d she says. Harington calls Clarke\u2019s humor \u201cnaughty,\u201d and it\u2019s certainly true that her informal, expletive-laced banter is a far cry from Daenerys\u2019s imperious tones. \u201cSometimes, if I\u2019m in a really bad mood,\u201d Clarke notes, \u201cpeople are like, \u2018Khaleesi!\u2019 \u201d\n\n<p>Finally, the spell of anonymity breaks, thanks to a display of competitiveness worthy of Game of Thrones. Our guide has challenged us to photograph as many birds and dragons as we can find in the paintings and sculptures on the tour, and Clarke is approaching the task with her usual effervescent zeal. Standing in the shadow of a stone Hatshepsut, one of patriarchal Egypt\u2019s first female pharaohs, she triumphantly displays one of the winged targets she has captured on her phone. \u201cThis little birdie: Boom!\u201d she shouts, her voice ricocheting off the stone walls. A pair of young men look over, then descend, and, in thick French accents, ask for a photo. Clarke\u2019s triumphant grin tightens into a polite, distant smile.</p>\n\n<p>There it is: the face of Daenerys of the House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, the Unburnt, Queen of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons, who, over the course of seven seasons, has climbed from powerless pawn to resolute conqueror, forcing one rival after another to \u201cbend the knee\u201d or burn. As Daenerys has risen, so has Clarke, morphing from a struggling actress and part-time cater waiter to an international superstar and symbol of feminine fierceness. That journey is \u201cimportant and inspiring\u2014particularly now, in our climate,\u201d says her close friend Rose Leslie, who played the wildling warrior Ygritte in early seasons of Game of Thrones. \u201cShe\u2019s at the forefront of representing independent women.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>We still don\u2019t know if, as many expect, Daenerys Targaryen will win the right to rule the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, but we can be assured that Emilia Clarke will hang up her platinum wig for good when Game of Thrones ends its eight-season run, in 2019. There\u2019s still a lot of filming and post-production work to be done, but Clarke has already shot her character\u2019s final on-screen moments. \u201cIt fucked me up,\u201d she says. \u201cKnowing that is going to be a lasting flavor in someone\u2019s mouth of what Daenerys is \u2026\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Clarke has good reason to feel unsettled. Letting go of a culture-defining television role can be liberating, to be sure, but it can also be deflating\u2014or worse. Jon Hamm may always be seen as Don Draper; Sarah Michelle Gellar is forever Buffy the Vampire Slayer; Jennifer Aniston will never not be Rachel. Fortunately, Clarke approaches this pivotal transition with a stubborn insistence on behaving like a normal, grounded human being. And her upcoming credits suggest that she\u2019s greatly in demand beyond Westeros.</p>\n\n<p>This month, Clarke, a self-described \u201cachievement junkie,\u201d joins the rapidly expanding Star Wars universe in Solo, a highly scrutinized origin story for Harrison Ford\u2019s Han Solo. Her well-honed gift for concealing every detail about her work\u2014\u201cEverything in my life is a spoiler,\u201d she says\u2014helped her get into character. Director Ron Howard, a Game of Thrones fan, explains that Qi\u2019ra, Han Solo\u2019s childhood friend turned unreliable ally, is secretive, slippery, and morally questionable\u2014\u201ca much different sort of a character\u201d from Daenerys.</p>\n\n<p>If Solo becomes a major hit, it will give Clarke a rare chance to leap cleanly from one spectacularly successful genre franchise to another. But even if it doesn\u2019t, she has no shortage of options. An active participant in Time\u2019s Up, she has ambitious plans to write and produce her own material\u2014and create new opportunities for other women in the industry. Discussing those issues, she begins to sound more like the fiery Daenerys. \u201cIt becomes harder to separate you from the role when you\u2019ve been with it so long,\u201d she admits.</p>\n\n<p>Eight years ago, Dan Weiss and David Benioff were in trouble. Their pilot for Game of Thrones, an adaptation of George R. R. Martin\u2019s popular A Song of Ice and Fire book series, was a disaster. Along with re-shoots, the pair were looking to re-cast a few key roles, including the pivotal part of Daenerys Targaryen. Tall, willowy, and fair-haired, Tamzin Merchant, the actress originally cast as Khaleesi, was a far more conventional match for the character on the page. The second time around, Weiss and Benioff took a fresh look at the character.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cEmilia was the only person we saw\u2014and we saw hundreds\u2014who could carry the full range that Daenerys required,\u201d the pair explained in tandem via e-mail. \u201cYoung actors aren\u2019t often asked to play a combination of Joan of Arc, Lawrence of Arabia, and Napoleon.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>When Clarke started on the series, Daenerys was downtrodden, occasionally objectified, and stranded in a subplot that kept the character geographically distant from the main story and the actress isolated from most of her co-stars. \u201cI was cut off from the rest of the cast,\u201d Clarke says. Over the years, as the famously cutthroat Thrones has thinned its sprawling ensemble, Clarke has risen in the ranks, snagging the show\u2019s flashiest, most empowering moments.</p>\n\n<p>In an era when network and streaming platforms alike are struggling to get anyone to tune in, Game of Thrones has become one of the last surviving holdovers from the must-see TV era. For a handful of weeks every year, HBO owns Sunday nights, with devotees watching live to avoid spoilers at the office Monday morning. Clearing its own very high ratings bar, Thrones commanded an average of 32.8 million viewers in its 2017 season. Its 38 wins make it the most-awarded scripted-TV series in Emmy history.</p>\n\n<p>That glaring spotlight has made Daenerys a cultural touchstone\u2014not to mention a costume-party staple, with Madonna, Katy Perry, Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian, and Kristen Bell among her many famous impersonators. At a recent charity auction, Brad Pitt offered six figures to spend an evening with Clarke and Harington, only to be outbid. Last year, Daenerys finally powered into the heart of the series, earning long-awaited screen time with Harington and the rest of the surviving stars. Clarke, who has been nominated three times for best supporting actress at the Emmys, may soon be gunning for lead honors. \u201cEverything in my life is a spoiler,\u201d Clarke says.</p>\n\n<p>Clarke\u2019s upbringing in the bucolic countryside an hour outside of London couldn\u2019t be farther from the dysfunctional family dynamics that forged the orphaned Daenerys. Emilia\u2019s mother, Jennifer, is a businesswoman who currently runs the Anima Foundation, a charity aimed at raising awareness of specialty brain-injury care, and her father, Peter, was a theatrical sound engineer who prized education above all else. \u201cYour bookshelf should be bigger than your TV,\u201d he liked to remind Emilia and her older brother, Bennett. \u201cMy mum, my brother, my dad, and I would sit around a table, and my happiest place was just discussing stuff,\u201d Emilia says. \u201cI really value intelligence. I\u2019m one of the very fortunate few people who really likes their family. I just like hanging out with them.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Clarke isn\u2019t the first woman in her family to engage in high-stakes identity juggling. Her maternal grandmother wore light makeup to disguise the fact that she was half Indian, owing to her mother\u2019s very secret affair with a mysterious man from the colonial subcontinent. \u201cThe fact that [my grandmother] had to hide her skin color, essentially, and try desperately to fit in with everyone else must\u2019ve been incredibly difficult,\u201d Clarke says. \u201cSo, yeah: history of fighters.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Emilia\u2019s parents saved up to send her to a pair of upper-crust boarding schools\u2014Rye St. Antony and St. Edward\u2019s, both in Oxford\u2014but she never felt at home with her much wealthier classmates. \u201cI didn\u2019t really fit in, like everybody who ever went to school ever.\u201d So she channeled her energy into performing. She was rejected the first time she applied to acting school, but eventually Drama Centre London claimed her from the waiting list when another student broke her leg and dropped out. There, she finally found the \u201cartistically inclined\u201d friends who would keep her grounded amid the circus of international fame.</p>\n\n<p>The jet-setting Clarke clings tightly to her roots even as her life and career take her ever farther from the Home Counties. For one thing, she recently got her brother a gig in the Thrones camera department. \u201cThis job can be so alienating,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re in a trailer by yourself. You\u2019re in a car by yourself. You\u2019re in a plane. You\u2019re in a plane. You\u2019re in a plane. That\u2019s what success looks like if you\u2019re an actor. Success looks like being alone.\u201d Clarke stays sharp by devouring \u201cnerdy\u201d podcasts on a range of topics from politics to science. \u201cShe\u2019s so informed,\u201d says Rose Leslie. \u201cShe has an opinion on every topic.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Clarke\u2019s father passed away in 2016 after a long battle with cancer. At the time, Emilia was in the U.S. shooting the upcoming thriller Above Suspicion and couldn\u2019t break away to say her final good-byes. \u201cIt still sucks. Grief sucks. He doesn\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing now,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s it before I start crying.\u201d After a couple of romances with famous men\u2014first, Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane, then, reportedly, actor Jai Courtney, a brief souvenir from her Terminator Genisys shoot\u2014Clarke swore off dating actors. In fact, she hasn\u2019t been romantically linked in some time. When Solo premiered at Cannes, in May, she had hoped to walk the red carpet with her brother, and her goal in general is to keep her relationships out of the news. \u201cThe guys that I\u2019ve met in my life that are dicks, I voluntarily walk the fuck away from them,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s just bad taste. People shouldn\u2019t know about those choices.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Clarke usually appears in public with various non-famous \u201cmates\u201d from her drama-school days. Her \u201cperma-plus-one\u201d is Lola Frears, daughter of director Stephen Frears. \u201cI ain\u2019t got me no celebrity friends,\u201d Clarke says. \u201cMy squad? They don\u2019t let me get away with anything. There\u2019s not a lot of actors I relate to.\u201d Leslie, a rare exception to Emilia\u2019s rule, confirms that Clarke\u2019s longtime friends keep her in check: \u201cThere would be a ticking off or a bollocking if they felt she was no longer the lovely lady that they have always known.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The Star Wars tradition of featuring morally upright heroines, among them Carrie Fisher\u2019s General Leia, Daisy Ridley\u2019s Rey, and Felicity Jones\u2019s Jyn Erso, was part of what drew Emilia Clarke to the role of Qi\u2019ra in Solo, but it was the chance to break the mold that really sold her. \u201cWe\u2019re going to hit you with a character that could very easily well be a dude, because you question her motives,\u201d she says, sitting in a back corner of the Met\u2019s no-frills cafeteria snacking on a pear and sipping English-breakfast tea from a paper cup. \u201cThat\u2019s really fucking exciting in the Star Wars universe, because that has never happened.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Before accepting the Solo role, Clarke had to ask Game of Thrones show-runners Weiss and Benioff for permission to complicate their plans for a final season by adding a demanding Star Wars filming schedule to the mix. They didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cSolo felt like a great fit that would let her show off her versatility,\u201d Weiss and Benioff explained. \u201cAlso, we figured she\u2019d probably get to shoot a ray gun. Ray guns are something we just can\u2019t offer, unfortunately.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Swapping dragons for ray guns, Emilia Clarke was eager to prove her mettle in a whole new galaxy. But that plan hit a snag when the Solo production fell spectacularly and publicly apart. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna lie,\u201d Clarke says. \u201cI struggled with Qi\u2019ra quite a lot. I was like: \u2018Y\u2019all need to stop telling me that she\u2019s \u201cfilm noir,\u201d because that ain\u2019t a note.\u2019 \u201d Frustrated by the lack of direction, she turned to Solo\u2019s father-and-son screenwriters, Lawrence and Jon Kasdan, for support. Then, four and a half months into shooting, co-directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller exited the project, citing \u201ccreative differences.\u201d Production was put on hold until they were replaced by Ron Howard, a longtime friend of franchise creator George Lucas\u2019s. With a brand-new director and an ambitious re-shoot schedule\u2014Clarke reluctantly agrees when I call those first months \u201ca high-budget dress rehearsal\u201d\u2014Solo still had to hit its opening date, in May of the following year.</p>\n\n<p>Clarke says Howard\u2019s arrival \u201csaved\u201d the movie: \u201cAll hail to [Lucasfilm president] Kathy [Kennedy] for hiring Ron.\u201d Slipping into a mocking impression of herself, Clarke re-enacts a self-pitying therapy session with Howard over a private meal they shared before resuming production. \u201cHe even feigned enthusiasm!\u201d she says. \u201cI know for a fact he had that discussion with everybody. I think we all came to set feeling like his favorite. It makes for a really happy load of actors, with our egos.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Howard recalls that dinner a bit differently. The former child star of The Andy Griffith Show saw in Clarke \u201cthe kind of pragmatism and a can-do spirit that often comes from people who have cut their teeth doing television.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI know some of how tough it was for her,\u201d Harington says. \u201cBut she\u2019s pretty tough as well.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Clarke wasn\u2019t privy to everything that led up to the director swap, but she wasn\u2019t entirely surprised, either. \u201cWhen it comes to that amount of money, you\u2019re almost waiting for that to happen. Money fucks us all up, doesn\u2019t it? There\u2019s so much pressure. Han Solo is a really beloved character. This is a really important movie for the franchise as a whole. It\u2019s a shit ton of money. A shit ton of people. A shit ton of expectations.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Solo wasn\u2019t the first troubled blockbuster to test Clarke\u2019s resilience. If anything, the production of 2015\u2019s Terminator Genisys was more chaotic. She watched frequent Thrones director Alan Taylor get \u201ceaten and chewed up on Terminator. He was not the director I remembered. He didn\u2019t have a good time. No one had a good time.\u201d When the film underperformed at the box office, she was \u201crelieved\u201d to not have to return for any sequels. News of the rocky production traveled, and Clarke says the crew on the famously disastrous Fantastic Four, which was filming nearby, even had jackets made that read, AT LEAST WE\u2019RE NOT ON TERMINATOR. \u201cJust to give you a summary,\u201d she says, laughing.</p>\n\n<p>Rumors spreading between film sets is one thing, but the Solo tumult was covered exhaustively in the trades and on fan sites, adding another layer of pressure to an already pressurized project. \u201cI hope we did it good, then, because people have all this gossip,\u201d Clarke says. \u201cI don\u2019t want people to go, \u2018That\u2019s the bit where it all went wrong. That\u2019s the bit, I know it.\u2019 I just really hope that people have a good time, that it\u2019s good, and, you know, selfishly, that I\u2019m not shit and that people don\u2019t write reviews going, \u2018Oh my God, that\u2019s, like, the worst acting I\u2019ve ever seen in my life. Wow. How did they give her the part?\u2019 \u201d</p>\n\n<p>For all her anxieties about how her performance will go over, Clarke and I are both energized by the Solo footage we\u2019ve seen. Clarke\u2019s easy chemistry with Donald Glover, who plays fan favorite Lando Calrissian, is evident from their very first on-screen meeting. And though her shifting allegiances mean she has to play a range of emotions opposite Alden Ehrenreich\u2019s Han Solo, she endows every twist with an undercurrent of romantic possibility. Tonally closer to the Indiana Jones movies than to, say, Rogue One, Solo marks the franchise\u2019s return to lighthearted, fast-paced capers.</p>\n\n<p>Clarke\u2014who spends most Thrones battles on the backs of her C.G.I. dragons\u2014was eager to jump into the fray with some hand-to-hand combat. \u201cShe had to deal with quite a large sword and some pretty elaborate fight choreography, and she made it look easy,\u201d Ehrenreich says. With all the re-shoots and reconfigured plotting, she also had to fight to keep some of her favorite moments in. \u201cThat is going to be badass as fuck,\u201d she told the filmmakers of a showstopping Qi\u2019ra moment that made the cut. \u201cDon\u2019t forget your audience.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Long before they shared a scene together, Clarke and Harington had become friends thanks to their time on the Game of Thrones promotional circuit. It was through Harington that Clarke met Rose Leslie. An adept mimic, Clarke impersonates a \u201csmitten\u201d Harington mooning over his on-screen lover and future real-life fianc\u00e9e in the early days of the show: \u201cThere\u2019s the best human in the world. She\u2019s called Rose.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Clarke has a teasing relationship with Harington. \u201cI\u2019ll tell him, \u2018Kit, stop being a dick\u2014stop being so grumpy.\u2019 Like I would with my brother.\u201d And as the two transition in these final seasons from real-life friends to partners in TV\u2019s biggest romance (albeit one complicated by incest), the ribbing has only increased. \u201cIf you\u2019ve known someone for six years, and they\u2019re best friends with your girlfriend, and you\u2019re best friends with them,\u201d Harington says, \u201cthere is something unnatural and strange about doing a love scene. We\u2019ll end up kissing and then we\u2019re just pissing ourselves with laughter because it\u2019s so ridiculous.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s goofy,\u201d Weiss and Benioff confirm. \u201cWe have tried to let some of Emilia\u2019s humor and light seep into Daenerys whenever possible. Who says conquerors can\u2019t be funny?\u201d A memorable Season Four conversation between Daenerys and her right-hand woman, Missandei, concerning a eunuch\u2019s \u201cpillar and stones,\u201d for instance, is much more Clarke than Targaryen. Sadly, it\u2019s unclear how much space there will be in the show\u2019s climactic final season for bawdy, Clarke-ish humor. \u201cI\u2019m doing all this weird shit,\u201d Clarke says. \u201cYou\u2019ll know what I mean when you see it.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In the final episodes of a show with a body count as high as Game of Thrones\u2019, Clarke never really knows when she might be filming her last moments with a member of the cast. She\u2019s also shooting for the first time with several of the show\u2019s top stars, including Sophie Turner and Maisie Williams, who play the formidable Stark sisters.</p>\n\n<p>Clarke is well aware that the strong women of the series are leaving some kind of imprint on the culture, but she\u2019s saving up all her big-picture reflections on Daenerys for later: \u201cThis is going to be a Band-Aid that I\u2019m going to rip off.\u201d To help with that process, she started keeping a daily journal of her last season. With cell phones banned from the set due to security concerns, it\u2019s her best hope of chronicling the final days of Daenerys. Selfies are off limits, but Clarke has asked set photographer Helen Sloan to snap the occasional behind-the-scenes photo. Both the journal and the photos, Clarke hints, may be available to the show\u2019s fans someday.</p>\n\n<p>Clarke is unsurprisingly, and contractually, evasive when it comes to specifics of the concluding six episodes. Heavy hints in the most recent season indicate that, in addition to contending with the usual climactic end-of-the-world crises, Daenerys will also be grappling with more intimate parenthood and family issues. Here, Clarke and her on-screen alter ego may have something in common. Friends like Leslie and Harington are settling down to build their own families (\u201cTheir wedding is going to be siiiiick,\u201d Clarke says), and an old schoolmate recently made Clarke godmother to a highly photogenic baby boy who makes regular appearances on her Instagram account. She lights up when talking about him.</p>\n\n<p>Talking about her own parents evokes other emotions. The wounds from the loss of her father are still fresh, but her mother remains an inspiration. If all goes according to plan, it\u2019s Jennifer Clarke who will provide the map for Clarke\u2019s very first post-Thrones steps. After the show ends, Clarke plans to re-create a road trip her mother took in 1972 to Yosemite and the redwoods of Northern California. With best friend and scriptwriter Lola Frears by her side, Clarke intends to spend part of the trip working on ideas for new projects. Her agents offered to take these ideas to \u201cguys\u201d with writing experience, but her answer to that was pure Daenerys: \u201cNo, I\u2019m going to take it to me.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Citing Reese Witherspoon, Greta Gerwig, and other actresses turned creators as inspiration, Clarke says she wants to work with as many female filmmakers as she can. As for the conventional industry wisdom that women can\u2019t work together without infighting? \u201cIt\u2019s fucking bullshit. It\u2019s so annoying.\u201d An active member of Time\u2019s Up, Clarke negotiated with Weiss and Benioff in 2014 to ensure she maintained parity with her male counterparts. She and four co-stars\u2014Harington, Lena Headey (Cersei Lannister), Peter Dinklage (Tyrion Lannister), and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Jaime Lannister)\u2014reportedly each landed $300,000 per episode, a dazzling figure that skyrocketed to half a million per episode for the final two seasons. \u201cI get fucking paid the same as my guy friends,\u201d Clarke says. \u201cWe made sure of that.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And while Clarke would be thrilled to have her own Lady Bird or Big Little Lies, that\u2019s not all she\u2019s after. She says she\u2019s \u201cdesperate\u201d to make documentaries and shine a light on underserved causes. \u201cThat\u2019s the shit that gets me going personally.\u201d Inspired by her father\u2019s cancer ordeal, Clarke is especially passionate about the risks Brexit poses to the U.K.\u2019s National Health Service, and she was recently named ambassador to the Royal College of Nursing. \u201cThat\u2019s something I have in common with Dae-nerys,\u201d she says suddenly, after several hours of explaining all the reasons she and her character are nothing alike. \u201cI really feel for people and I want to help them. Not to sound too much like Oprah Winfrey.\u201d She pauses, and thinks again. \u201cFuck that, I\u2019m gonna sound like Oprah and I\u2019m going to be proud of it.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In the midst of the twin tornadoes of Star Wars and Game of Thrones, Clarke acknowledges that most of her choices these days are \u201cstudio choices.\u201d And if Solo is a hit, Clarke could be working for Lucasfilm for years to come. But Harington sees something else in her future: \u201cShe\u2019s done, far more than me or most people in the cast, these very high-budget, big-hitting blockbusters. Hopefully Star Wars continues for her and she does more of them. But I think she\u2019s an incredibly talented actor, and I would love to see her do something which is a more focused character piece, because the ones she\u2019s done are brilliant.\u201d Clarke\u2019s effervescent performance in 2016\u2019s romantic weepy Me Before You\u2014a surprise hit at the box office\u2014hints at what she\u2019s capable of.</p>\n\n<p>Clarke wants to stretch herself, and explore a new-media landscape where creators no longer have to rely on large companies in order to get their projects made. \u201cEveryone can. Get your iPhone out. Let\u2019s do something. You know what I mean?\u201d And with 17 million followers on Instagram, Clarke has the power to make and launch her own projects. Her recent Thrones-themed fund-raising Instagram video for the Royal College of Nursing Foundation racked up more than seven million views in just three days.</p>\n\n<p>All that takes some of the heat off Clarke as she decides how to follow up roles in two of entertainment\u2019s biggest franchises. She doesn\u2019t necessarily need another monster hit. She can afford to take her time, listen to herself, and do something that feels true to who she is\u2014whoever that may be.</p>\n\n<p>The most obvious evidence of the blur between Daenerys and Clarke is the relatively new shock of blond hair on her head. \u201cI did this, which was frigging stupid,\u201d she says, fingering the blunt-cut ends of her bleached hair.</p>\n\n<p>When Kit Harington trimmed his famous curls in 2015, fans were led to believe his character, presumed dead, wouldn\u2019t be returning to the show the following season. (He did.) But Clarke swears her decision to go blonde has nothing at all to do with Daenerys\u2019s fate. \u201cI got to a point where I said I just want to look in the mirror and see something different. So I was just like, \u2018Fuck it, it\u2019s the last season. I\u2019m going to dye my hair blond.\u2019 \u201d Clarke jokes that she immediately felt remorse and bought nine baseball caps online. \u201cBut they don\u2019t go with your outfit, so I don\u2019t wear them.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Clarke\u2019s brown hair had always been her shield. The blond hair makes it harder to slip back into her pre-fame life. Partying with her old friends is tricky because their friends get \u201cweird\u201d about it, and she misses the mundane pleasures of, say, running errands for her mother. \u201cWhat I get most heartbroken about is that those opportunities are almost completely gone.\u201d Then she catches herself, and apologizes for moaning about the \u201cchampagne problems\u201d of fame. \u201cIf I were reading this, I\u2019d be like, \u2018Cheer the fuck up, love.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n\n<p>Back underneath that statue at the Met, Emilia Clarke cranes her neck up to get a closer look at the ancient pharaoh\u2019s smooth granite face. Hatshepsut wears a false beard that allowed her to pass more easily through the male-dominated world. Our guide points out a faint piece of carved string running up the pharaoh\u2019s jawline holding the disguise in place. Thinking about it later, Clarke, who knows a thing or two about disguises, passing, alter egos, and powerful women, shakes her head in astonishment. \u201cThat is some fascinating shit right there.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>A towering granite Daenerys statue may never find its way into the hallowed halls of the Met, but it\u2019s not clear Emilia Clarke wants that anyway. As we duck out of the Met a bit behind schedule, only to find that it\u2019s raining and our sleek hired car is nowhere in sight, Clarke gamely suggests we rush out into the downpour and dive into the back of a yellow cab. Our driver doesn\u2019t recognize Clarke, either, which puts her at ease. Unsure how to get to where we\u2019re going, he passes his smartphone to her so she can type the hotel\u2019s address into his G.P.S. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, mate,\u201d she announces. \u201cYour little app will get us there!\u201d A satisfied smile plays on her face as the taxi twists, turns, and bumps along. She looks happier than she ever has riding a dragon.</p></div><div class=\"su-expand-link su-expand-link-more\" style=\"text-align:left\"><a href=\"javascript:;\" style=\"color:#E3C4C4;border-color:#E3C4C4\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i>Read the rest of the article</a></div><div class=\"su-expand-link su-expand-link-less\" style=\"text-align:left\"><a href=\"javascript:;\" style=\"color:#E3C4C4;border-color:#E3C4C4\">Show less</a></div></div>\n\n<p></p><center><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NZuzudfcsek\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></center><center></center><center></center><center><img src=\"http://emilia-clarke.com/gallery/albums/Photoshoots/111-2018-VanityFairSummer/thumb_002.jpg\"><img src=\"http://emilia-clarke.com/gallery/albums/Photoshoots/111-2018-VanityFairSummer/thumb_003.jpg\"><img src=\"http://emilia-clarke.com/gallery/albums/Photoshoots/111-2018-VanityFairSummer/thumb_004.jpg\"><img src=\"http://emilia-clarke.com/gallery/albums/Magazines/2018/2018-VanityFair-Summer/thumb_001.jpg\"></center>\u00a0\n<p><strong>Gallery Links:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>PHOTOSHOOTS &amp; OUTTAKES &gt; <a href=\"http://emilia-clarke.com/gallery/thumbnails.php?album=997\"><strong>2018 Vanity Fair Magazine</strong></a></li>\n<li>MAGAZINES &gt; 2018 &gt; <a href=\"http://emilia-clarke.com/gallery/thumbnails.php?album=1002\"><strong>2018 Vanity Fair \u2013 Summer</strong></a></li>\n</ul><p class=\"tumblr-crosspostr-linkback\"><a href=\"http://emilia-clarke.com/news/2139-press-gallery-emilia-clarke-solo-flight/\" title=\"Go to the original post.\" rel=\"bookmark\">Press/Gallery: Emilia Clarke Solo Flight</a> was originally published on <a href=\"http://emilia-clarke.com\">Enchanting Emilia Clarke</a></p></p>",

Adopting the unsourceable accent Crystal uses opposite Meg Ryan in a famously improvised scene filmed in this very room, Clarke starts stuttering, \u201cPah-pah-paprikash.\u201d Our amused if bewildered guide, too young to get the reference, adds the 1989 rom-com to her list of movie recommendations from Clarke, who has already gushed about the 2017 religious drama Novitiate. Chuckling over this unlikely double feature, Clarke assures her, \u201cYou have two incredible movies coming your way.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>One reference the guide does get: Game of Thrones, the HBO juggernaut which stars Clarke as its most unstoppable heroine, Daenerys Targaryen. In fact, the very tour we\u2019re taking, put together by a company called Museum Hack, is based on the series, and offers a fan-friendly survey of the sometimes inscrutable displays of the Met. You don\u2019t have to be an art historian (our guide is an aspiring actress) to understand what Greek fire, Damascus blades, heraldry, mutilated men, samurai kamon, the dragon-born St. Margaret of Antioch, and an early female pharaoh have to do with wildfire, Valyrian steel, house words, and Clarke\u2019s world-famous alter ego.</p>\n<div class=\"su-expand su-expand-collapsed su-expand-link-style-button\" data-height=\"70\"><div class=\"su-expand-content\" style=\"color:#AAA5A5;max-height:70px;overflow:hidden\">And yet, despite her fame, Clarke has managed to spend a full half-hour in the museum sponging up our guide\u2019s trivia without being spotted. For years, Clarke\u2019s brown hair let her hide in plain sight, but she recently bleached it an icy Targaryen blond. So, why the invisibility? Maybe it\u2019s her height. \u201cWe both have a thing about our stature not quite being what people expect,\u201d says her co-star Kit Harington, who, at five feet eight, has six inches on Clarke. Maybe it\u2019s her outfit\u2014the gray overcoat, cream sweater, and jeans are a far cry from the cloaks and armor of Thrones. Or maybe it\u2019s her bright, decidedly non-intimidating personality. \u201cWhen I\u2019m goofing around with my pals, I\u2019m unrecognizable,\u201d she says. Harington calls Clarke\u2019s humor \u201cnaughty,\u201d and it\u2019s certainly true that her informal, expletive-laced banter is a far cry from Daenerys\u2019s imperious tones. \u201cSometimes, if I\u2019m in a really bad mood,\u201d Clarke notes, \u201cpeople are like, \u2018Khaleesi!\u2019 \u201d\n\n<p>Finally, the spell of anonymity breaks, thanks to a display of competitiveness worthy of Game of Thrones. Our guide has challenged us to photograph as many birds and dragons as we can find in the paintings and sculptures on the tour, and Clarke is approaching the task with her usual effervescent zeal. Standing in the shadow of a stone Hatshepsut, one of patriarchal Egypt\u2019s first female pharaohs, she triumphantly displays one of the winged targets she has captured on her phone. \u201cThis little birdie: Boom!\u201d she shouts, her voice ricocheting off the stone walls. A pair of young men look over, then descend, and, in thick French accents, ask for a photo. Clarke\u2019s triumphant grin tightens into a polite, distant smile.</p>\n\n<p>There it is: the face of Daenerys of the House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, the Unburnt, Queen of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons, who, over the course of seven seasons, has climbed from powerless pawn to resolute conqueror, forcing one rival after another to \u201cbend the knee\u201d or burn. As Daenerys has risen, so has Clarke, morphing from a struggling actress and part-time cater waiter to an international superstar and symbol of feminine fierceness. That journey is \u201cimportant and inspiring\u2014particularly now, in our climate,\u201d says her close friend Rose Leslie, who played the wildling warrior Ygritte in early seasons of Game of Thrones. \u201cShe\u2019s at the forefront of representing independent women.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>We still don\u2019t know if, as many expect, Daenerys Targaryen will win the right to rule the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, but we can be assured that Emilia Clarke will hang up her platinum wig for good when Game of Thrones ends its eight-season run, in 2019. There\u2019s still a lot of filming and post-production work to be done, but Clarke has already shot her character\u2019s final on-screen moments. \u201cIt fucked me up,\u201d she says. \u201cKnowing that is going to be a lasting flavor in someone\u2019s mouth of what Daenerys is \u2026\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Clarke has good reason to feel unsettled. Letting go of a culture-defining television role can be liberating, to be sure, but it can also be deflating\u2014or worse. Jon Hamm may always be seen as Don Draper; Sarah Michelle Gellar is forever Buffy the Vampire Slayer; Jennifer Aniston will never not be Rachel. Fortunately, Clarke approaches this pivotal transition with a stubborn insistence on behaving like a normal, grounded human being. And her upcoming credits suggest that she\u2019s greatly in demand beyond Westeros.</p>\n\n<p>This month, Clarke, a self-described \u201cachievement junkie,\u201d joins the rapidly expanding Star Wars universe in Solo, a highly scrutinized origin story for Harrison Ford\u2019s Han Solo. Her well-honed gift for concealing every detail about her work\u2014\u201cEverything in my life is a spoiler,\u201d she says\u2014helped her get into character. Director Ron Howard, a Game of Thrones fan, explains that Qi\u2019ra, Han Solo\u2019s childhood friend turned unreliable ally, is secretive, slippery, and morally questionable\u2014\u201ca much different sort of a character\u201d from Daenerys.</p>\n\n<p>If Solo becomes a major hit, it will give Clarke a rare chance to leap cleanly from one spectacularly successful genre franchise to another. But even if it doesn\u2019t, she has no shortage of options. An active participant in Time\u2019s Up, she has ambitious plans to write and produce her own material\u2014and create new opportunities for other women in the industry. Discussing those issues, she begins to sound more like the fiery Daenerys. \u201cIt becomes harder to separate you from the role when you\u2019ve been with it so long,\u201d she admits.</p>\n\n<p>Eight years ago, Dan Weiss and David Benioff were in trouble. Their pilot for Game of Thrones, an adaptation of George R. R. Martin\u2019s popular A Song of Ice and Fire book series, was a disaster. Along with re-shoots, the pair were looking to re-cast a few key roles, including the pivotal part of Daenerys Targaryen. Tall, willowy, and fair-haired, Tamzin Merchant, the actress originally cast as Khaleesi, was a far more conventional match for the character on the page. The second time around, Weiss and Benioff took a fresh look at the character.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cEmilia was the only person we saw\u2014and we saw hundreds\u2014who could carry the full range that Daenerys required,\u201d the pair explained in tandem via e-mail. \u201cYoung actors aren\u2019t often asked to play a combination of Joan of Arc, Lawrence of Arabia, and Napoleon.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>When Clarke started on the series, Daenerys was downtrodden, occasionally objectified, and stranded in a subplot that kept the character geographically distant from the main story and the actress isolated from most of her co-stars. \u201cI was cut off from the rest of the cast,\u201d Clarke says. Over the years, as the famously cutthroat Thrones has thinned its sprawling ensemble, Clarke has risen in the ranks, snagging the show\u2019s flashiest, most empowering moments.</p>\n\n<p>In an era when network and streaming platforms alike are struggling to get anyone to tune in, Game of Thrones has become one of the last surviving holdovers from the must-see TV era. For a handful of weeks every year, HBO owns Sunday nights, with devotees watching live to avoid spoilers at the office Monday morning. Clearing its own very high ratings bar, Thrones commanded an average of 32.8 million viewers in its 2017 season. Its 38 wins make it the most-awarded scripted-TV series in Emmy history.</p>\n\n<p>That glaring spotlight has made Daenerys a cultural touchstone\u2014not to mention a costume-party staple, with Madonna, Katy Perry, Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian, and Kristen Bell among her many famous impersonators. At a recent charity auction, Brad Pitt offered six figures to spend an evening with Clarke and Harington, only to be outbid. Last year, Daenerys finally powered into the heart of the series, earning long-awaited screen time with Harington and the rest of the surviving stars. Clarke, who has been nominated three times for best supporting actress at the Emmys, may soon be gunning for lead honors. \u201cEverything in my life is a spoiler,\u201d Clarke says.</p>\n\n<p>Clarke\u2019s upbringing in the bucolic countryside an hour outside of London couldn\u2019t be farther from the dysfunctional family dynamics that forged the orphaned Daenerys. Emilia\u2019s mother, Jennifer, is a businesswoman who currently runs the Anima Foundation, a charity aimed at raising awareness of specialty brain-injury care, and her father, Peter, was a theatrical sound engineer who prized education above all else. \u201cYour bookshelf should be bigger than your TV,\u201d he liked to remind Emilia and her older brother, Bennett. \u201cMy mum, my brother, my dad, and I would sit around a table, and my happiest place was just discussing stuff,\u201d Emilia says. \u201cI really value intelligence. I\u2019m one of the very fortunate few people who really likes their family. I just like hanging out with them.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Clarke isn\u2019t the first woman in her family to engage in high-stakes identity juggling. Her maternal grandmother wore light makeup to disguise the fact that she was half Indian, owing to her mother\u2019s very secret affair with a mysterious man from the colonial subcontinent. \u201cThe fact that [my grandmother] had to hide her skin color, essentially, and try desperately to fit in with everyone else must\u2019ve been incredibly difficult,\u201d Clarke says. \u201cSo, yeah: history of fighters.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Emilia\u2019s parents saved up to send her to a pair of upper-crust boarding schools\u2014Rye St. Antony and St. Edward\u2019s, both in Oxford\u2014but she never felt at home with her much wealthier classmates. \u201cI didn\u2019t really fit in, like everybody who ever went to school ever.\u201d So she channeled her energy into performing. She was rejected the first time she applied to acting school, but eventually Drama Centre London claimed her from the waiting list when another student broke her leg and dropped out. There, she finally found the \u201cartistically inclined\u201d friends who would keep her grounded amid the circus of international fame.</p>\n\n<p>The jet-setting Clarke clings tightly to her roots even as her life and career take her ever farther from the Home Counties. For one thing, she recently got her brother a gig in the Thrones camera department. \u201cThis job can be so alienating,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re in a trailer by yourself. You\u2019re in a car by yourself. You\u2019re in a plane. You\u2019re in a plane. You\u2019re in a plane. That\u2019s what success looks like if you\u2019re an actor. Success looks like being alone.\u201d Clarke stays sharp by devouring \u201cnerdy\u201d podcasts on a range of topics from politics to science. \u201cShe\u2019s so informed,\u201d says Rose Leslie. \u201cShe has an opinion on every topic.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Clarke\u2019s father passed away in 2016 after a long battle with cancer. At the time, Emilia was in the U.S. shooting the upcoming thriller Above Suspicion and couldn\u2019t break away to say her final good-byes. \u201cIt still sucks. Grief sucks. He doesn\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing now,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s it before I start crying.\u201d After a couple of romances with famous men\u2014first, Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane, then, reportedly, actor Jai Courtney, a brief souvenir from her Terminator Genisys shoot\u2014Clarke swore off dating actors. In fact, she hasn\u2019t been romantically linked in some time. When Solo premiered at Cannes, in May, she had hoped to walk the red carpet with her brother, and her goal in general is to keep her relationships out of the news. \u201cThe guys that I\u2019ve met in my life that are dicks, I voluntarily walk the fuck away from them,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s just bad taste. People shouldn\u2019t know about those choices.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Clarke usually appears in public with various non-famous \u201cmates\u201d from her drama-school days. Her \u201cperma-plus-one\u201d is Lola Frears, daughter of director Stephen Frears. \u201cI ain\u2019t got me no celebrity friends,\u201d Clarke says. \u201cMy squad? They don\u2019t let me get away with anything. There\u2019s not a lot of actors I relate to.\u201d Leslie, a rare exception to Emilia\u2019s rule, confirms that Clarke\u2019s longtime friends keep her in check: \u201cThere would be a ticking off or a bollocking if they felt she was no longer the lovely lady that they have always known.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The Star Wars tradition of featuring morally upright heroines, among them Carrie Fisher\u2019s General Leia, Daisy Ridley\u2019s Rey, and Felicity Jones\u2019s Jyn Erso, was part of what drew Emilia Clarke to the role of Qi\u2019ra in Solo, but it was the chance to break the mold that really sold her. \u201cWe\u2019re going to hit you with a character that could very easily well be a dude, because you question her motives,\u201d she says, sitting in a back corner of the Met\u2019s no-frills cafeteria snacking on a pear and sipping English-breakfast tea from a paper cup. \u201cThat\u2019s really fucking exciting in the Star Wars universe, because that has never happened.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Before accepting the Solo role, Clarke had to ask Game of Thrones show-runners Weiss and Benioff for permission to complicate their plans for a final season by adding a demanding Star Wars filming schedule to the mix. They didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cSolo felt like a great fit that would let her show off her versatility,\u201d Weiss and Benioff explained. \u201cAlso, we figured she\u2019d probably get to shoot a ray gun. Ray guns are something we just can\u2019t offer, unfortunately.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Swapping dragons for ray guns, Emilia Clarke was eager to prove her mettle in a whole new galaxy. But that plan hit a snag when the Solo production fell spectacularly and publicly apart. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna lie,\u201d Clarke says. \u201cI struggled with Qi\u2019ra quite a lot. I was like: \u2018Y\u2019all need to stop telling me that she\u2019s \u201cfilm noir,\u201d because that ain\u2019t a note.\u2019 \u201d Frustrated by the lack of direction, she turned to Solo\u2019s father-and-son screenwriters, Lawrence and Jon Kasdan, for support. Then, four and a half months into shooting, co-directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller exited the project, citing \u201ccreative differences.\u201d Production was put on hold until they were replaced by Ron Howard, a longtime friend of franchise creator George Lucas\u2019s. With a brand-new director and an ambitious re-shoot schedule\u2014Clarke reluctantly agrees when I call those first months \u201ca high-budget dress rehearsal\u201d\u2014Solo still had to hit its opening date, in May of the following year.</p>\n\n<p>Clarke says Howard\u2019s arrival \u201csaved\u201d the movie: \u201cAll hail to [Lucasfilm president] Kathy [Kennedy] for hiring Ron.\u201d Slipping into a mocking impression of herself, Clarke re-enacts a self-pitying therapy session with Howard over a private meal they shared before resuming production. \u201cHe even feigned enthusiasm!\u201d she says. \u201cI know for a fact he had that discussion with everybody. I think we all came to set feeling like his favorite. It makes for a really happy load of actors, with our egos.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Howard recalls that dinner a bit differently. The former child star of The Andy Griffith Show saw in Clarke \u201cthe kind of pragmatism and a can-do spirit that often comes from people who have cut their teeth doing television.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI know some of how tough it was for her,\u201d Harington says. \u201cBut she\u2019s pretty tough as well.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Clarke wasn\u2019t privy to everything that led up to the director swap, but she wasn\u2019t entirely surprised, either. \u201cWhen it comes to that amount of money, you\u2019re almost waiting for that to happen. Money fucks us all up, doesn\u2019t it? There\u2019s so much pressure. Han Solo is a really beloved character. This is a really important movie for the franchise as a whole. It\u2019s a shit ton of money. A shit ton of people. A shit ton of expectations.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Solo wasn\u2019t the first troubled blockbuster to test Clarke\u2019s resilience. If anything, the production of 2015\u2019s Terminator Genisys was more chaotic. She watched frequent Thrones director Alan Taylor get \u201ceaten and chewed up on Terminator. He was not the director I remembered. He didn\u2019t have a good time. No one had a good time.\u201d When the film underperformed at the box office, she was \u201crelieved\u201d to not have to return for any sequels. News of the rocky production traveled, and Clarke says the crew on the famously disastrous Fantastic Four, which was filming nearby, even had jackets made that read, AT LEAST WE\u2019RE NOT ON TERMINATOR. \u201cJust to give you a summary,\u201d she says, laughing.</p>\n\n<p>Rumors spreading between film sets is one thing, but the Solo tumult was covered exhaustively in the trades and on fan sites, adding another layer of pressure to an already pressurized project. \u201cI hope we did it good, then, because people have all this gossip,\u201d Clarke says. \u201cI don\u2019t want people to go, \u2018That\u2019s the bit where it all went wrong. That\u2019s the bit, I know it.\u2019 I just really hope that people have a good time, that it\u2019s good, and, you know, selfishly, that I\u2019m not shit and that people don\u2019t write reviews going, \u2018Oh my God, that\u2019s, like, the worst acting I\u2019ve ever seen in my life. Wow. How did they give her the part?\u2019 \u201d</p>\n\n<p>For all her anxieties about how her performance will go over, Clarke and I are both energized by the Solo footage we\u2019ve seen. Clarke\u2019s easy chemistry with Donald Glover, who plays fan favorite Lando Calrissian, is evident from their very first on-screen meeting. And though her shifting allegiances mean she has to play a range of emotions opposite Alden Ehrenreich\u2019s Han Solo, she endows every twist with an undercurrent of romantic possibility. Tonally closer to the Indiana Jones movies than to, say, Rogue One, Solo marks the franchise\u2019s return to lighthearted, fast-paced capers.</p>\n\n<p>Clarke\u2014who spends most Thrones battles on the backs of her C.G.I. dragons\u2014was eager to jump into the fray with some hand-to-hand combat. \u201cShe had to deal with quite a large sword and some pretty elaborate fight choreography, and she made it look easy,\u201d Ehrenreich says. With all the re-shoots and reconfigured plotting, she also had to fight to keep some of her favorite moments in. \u201cThat is going to be badass as fuck,\u201d she told the filmmakers of a showstopping Qi\u2019ra moment that made the cut. \u201cDon\u2019t forget your audience.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Long before they shared a scene together, Clarke and Harington had become friends thanks to their time on the Game of Thrones promotional circuit. It was through Harington that Clarke met Rose Leslie. An adept mimic, Clarke impersonates a \u201csmitten\u201d Harington mooning over his on-screen lover and future real-life fianc\u00e9e in the early days of the show: \u201cThere\u2019s the best human in the world. She\u2019s called Rose.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Clarke has a teasing relationship with Harington. \u201cI\u2019ll tell him, \u2018Kit, stop being a dick\u2014stop being so grumpy.\u2019 Like I would with my brother.\u201d And as the two transition in these final seasons from real-life friends to partners in TV\u2019s biggest romance (albeit one complicated by incest), the ribbing has only increased. \u201cIf you\u2019ve known someone for six years, and they\u2019re best friends with your girlfriend, and you\u2019re best friends with them,\u201d Harington says, \u201cthere is something unnatural and strange about doing a love scene. We\u2019ll end up kissing and then we\u2019re just pissing ourselves with laughter because it\u2019s so ridiculous.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s goofy,\u201d Weiss and Benioff confirm. \u201cWe have tried to let some of Emilia\u2019s humor and light seep into Daenerys whenever possible. Who says conquerors can\u2019t be funny?\u201d A memorable Season Four conversation between Daenerys and her right-hand woman, Missandei, concerning a eunuch\u2019s \u201cpillar and stones,\u201d for instance, is much more Clarke than Targaryen. Sadly, it\u2019s unclear how much space there will be in the show\u2019s climactic final season for bawdy, Clarke-ish humor. \u201cI\u2019m doing all this weird shit,\u201d Clarke says. \u201cYou\u2019ll know what I mean when you see it.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In the final episodes of a show with a body count as high as Game of Thrones\u2019, Clarke never really knows when she might be filming her last moments with a member of the cast. She\u2019s also shooting for the first time with several of the show\u2019s top stars, including Sophie Turner and Maisie Williams, who play the formidable Stark sisters.</p>\n\n<p>Clarke is well aware that the strong women of the series are leaving some kind of imprint on the culture, but she\u2019s saving up all her big-picture reflections on Daenerys for later: \u201cThis is going to be a Band-Aid that I\u2019m going to rip off.\u201d To help with that process, she started keeping a daily journal of her last season. With cell phones banned from the set due to security concerns, it\u2019s her best hope of chronicling the final days of Daenerys. Selfies are off limits, but Clarke has asked set photographer Helen Sloan to snap the occasional behind-the-scenes photo. Both the journal and the photos, Clarke hints, may be available to the show\u2019s fans someday.</p>\n\n<p>Clarke is unsurprisingly, and contractually, evasive when it comes to specifics of the concluding six episodes. Heavy hints in the most recent season indicate that, in addition to contending with the usual climactic end-of-the-world crises, Daenerys will also be grappling with more intimate parenthood and family issues. Here, Clarke and her on-screen alter ego may have something in common. Friends like Leslie and Harington are settling down to build their own families (\u201cTheir wedding is going to be siiiiick,\u201d Clarke says), and an old schoolmate recently made Clarke godmother to a highly photogenic baby boy who makes regular appearances on her Instagram account. She lights up when talking about him.</p>\n\n<p>Talking about her own parents evokes other emotions. The wounds from the loss of her father are still fresh, but her mother remains an inspiration. If all goes according to plan, it\u2019s Jennifer Clarke who will provide the map for Clarke\u2019s very first post-Thrones steps. After the show ends, Clarke plans to re-create a road trip her mother took in 1972 to Yosemite and the redwoods of Northern California. With best friend and scriptwriter Lola Frears by her side, Clarke intends to spend part of the trip working on ideas for new projects. Her agents offered to take these ideas to \u201cguys\u201d with writing experience, but her answer to that was pure Daenerys: \u201cNo, I\u2019m going to take it to me.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Citing Reese Witherspoon, Greta Gerwig, and other actresses turned creators as inspiration, Clarke says she wants to work with as many female filmmakers as she can. As for the conventional industry wisdom that women can\u2019t work together without infighting? \u201cIt\u2019s fucking bullshit. It\u2019s so annoying.\u201d An active member of Time\u2019s Up, Clarke negotiated with Weiss and Benioff in 2014 to ensure she maintained parity with her male counterparts. She and four co-stars\u2014Harington, Lena Headey (Cersei Lannister), Peter Dinklage (Tyrion Lannister), and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Jaime Lannister)\u2014reportedly each landed $300,000 per episode, a dazzling figure that skyrocketed to half a million per episode for the final two seasons. \u201cI get fucking paid the same as my guy friends,\u201d Clarke says. \u201cWe made sure of that.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And while Clarke would be thrilled to have her own Lady Bird or Big Little Lies, that\u2019s not all she\u2019s after. She says she\u2019s \u201cdesperate\u201d to make documentaries and shine a light on underserved causes. \u201cThat\u2019s the shit that gets me going personally.\u201d Inspired by her father\u2019s cancer ordeal, Clarke is especially passionate about the risks Brexit poses to the U.K.\u2019s National Health Service, and she was recently named ambassador to the Royal College of Nursing. \u201cThat\u2019s something I have in common with Dae-nerys,\u201d she says suddenly, after several hours of explaining all the reasons she and her character are nothing alike. \u201cI really feel for people and I want to help them. Not to sound too much like Oprah Winfrey.\u201d She pauses, and thinks again. \u201cFuck that, I\u2019m gonna sound like Oprah and I\u2019m going to be proud of it.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In the midst of the twin tornadoes of Star Wars and Game of Thrones, Clarke acknowledges that most of her choices these days are \u201cstudio choices.\u201d And if Solo is a hit, Clarke could be working for Lucasfilm for years to come. But Harington sees something else in her future: \u201cShe\u2019s done, far more than me or most people in the cast, these very high-budget, big-hitting blockbusters. Hopefully Star Wars continues for her and she does more of them. But I think she\u2019s an incredibly talented actor, and I would love to see her do something which is a more focused character piece, because the ones she\u2019s done are brilliant.\u201d Clarke\u2019s effervescent performance in 2016\u2019s romantic weepy Me Before You\u2014a surprise hit at the box office\u2014hints at what she\u2019s capable of.</p>\n\n<p>Clarke wants to stretch herself, and explore a new-media landscape where creators no longer have to rely on large companies in order to get their projects made. \u201cEveryone can. Get your iPhone out. Let\u2019s do something. You know what I mean?\u201d And with 17 million followers on Instagram, Clarke has the power to make and launch her own projects. Her recent Thrones-themed fund-raising Instagram video for the Royal College of Nursing Foundation racked up more than seven million views in just three days.</p>\n\n<p>All that takes some of the heat off Clarke as she decides how to follow up roles in two of entertainment\u2019s biggest franchises. She doesn\u2019t necessarily need another monster hit. She can afford to take her time, listen to herself, and do something that feels true to who she is\u2014whoever that may be.</p>\n\n<p>The most obvious evidence of the blur between Daenerys and Clarke is the relatively new shock of blond hair on her head. \u201cI did this, which was frigging stupid,\u201d she says, fingering the blunt-cut ends of her bleached hair.</p>\n\n<p>When Kit Harington trimmed his famous curls in 2015, fans were led to believe his character, presumed dead, wouldn\u2019t be returning to the show the following season. (He did.) But Clarke swears her decision to go blonde has nothing at all to do with Daenerys\u2019s fate. \u201cI got to a point where I said I just want to look in the mirror and see something different. So I was just like, \u2018Fuck it, it\u2019s the last season. I\u2019m going to dye my hair blond.\u2019 \u201d Clarke jokes that she immediately felt remorse and bought nine baseball caps online. \u201cBut they don\u2019t go with your outfit, so I don\u2019t wear them.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Clarke\u2019s brown hair had always been her shield. The blond hair makes it harder to slip back into her pre-fame life. Partying with her old friends is tricky because their friends get \u201cweird\u201d about it, and she misses the mundane pleasures of, say, running errands for her mother. \u201cWhat I get most heartbroken about is that those opportunities are almost completely gone.\u201d Then she catches herself, and apologizes for moaning about the \u201cchampagne problems\u201d of fame. \u201cIf I were reading this, I\u2019d be like, \u2018Cheer the fuck up, love.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n\n<p>Back underneath that statue at the Met, Emilia Clarke cranes her neck up to get a closer look at the ancient pharaoh\u2019s smooth granite face. Hatshepsut wears a false beard that allowed her to pass more easily through the male-dominated world. Our guide points out a faint piece of carved string running up the pharaoh\u2019s jawline holding the disguise in place. Thinking about it later, Clarke, who knows a thing or two about disguises, passing, alter egos, and powerful women, shakes her head in astonishment. \u201cThat is some fascinating shit right there.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>A towering granite Daenerys statue may never find its way into the hallowed halls of the Met, but it\u2019s not clear Emilia Clarke wants that anyway. As we duck out of the Met a bit behind schedule, only to find that it\u2019s raining and our sleek hired car is nowhere in sight, Clarke gamely suggests we rush out into the downpour and dive into the back of a yellow cab. Our driver doesn\u2019t recognize Clarke, either, which puts her at ease. Unsure how to get to where we\u2019re going, he passes his smartphone to her so she can type the hotel\u2019s address into his G.P.S. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, mate,\u201d she announces. \u201cYour little app will get us there!\u201d A satisfied smile plays on her face as the taxi twists, turns, and bumps along. She looks happier than she ever has riding a dragon.</p></div><div class=\"su-expand-link su-expand-link-more\" style=\"text-align:left\"><a href=\"javascript:;\" style=\"color:#E3C4C4;border-color:#E3C4C4\"><i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i>Read the rest of the article</a></div><div class=\"su-expand-link su-expand-link-less\" style=\"text-align:left\"><a href=\"javascript:;\" style=\"color:#E3C4C4;border-color:#E3C4C4\">Show less</a></div></div>\n\n<p></p><center><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NZuzudfcsek\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></center><center></center><center></center><center><img src=\"http://emilia-clarke.com/gallery/albums/Photoshoots/111-2018-VanityFairSummer/thumb_002.jpg\"><img src=\"http://emilia-clarke.com/gallery/albums/Photoshoots/111-2018-VanityFairSummer/thumb_003.jpg\"><img src=\"http://emilia-clarke.com/gallery/albums/Photoshoots/111-2018-VanityFairSummer/thumb_004.jpg\"><img src=\"http://emilia-clarke.com/gallery/albums/Magazines/2018/2018-VanityFair-Summer/thumb_001.jpg\"></center>\u00a0\n<p><strong>Gallery Links:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>PHOTOSHOOTS &amp; OUTTAKES &gt; <a href=\"http://emilia-clarke.com/gallery/thumbnails.php?album=997\"><strong>2018 Vanity Fair Magazine</strong></a></li>\n<li>MAGAZINES &gt; 2018 &gt; <a href=\"http://emilia-clarke.com/gallery/thumbnails.php?album=1002\"><strong>2018 Vanity Fair \u2013 Summer</strong></a></li>\n</ul><p class=\"tumblr-crosspostr-linkback\"><a href=\"http://emilia-clarke.com/news/2139-press-gallery-emilia-clarke-solo-flight/\" title=\"Go to the original post.\" rel=\"bookmark\">Press/Gallery: Emilia Clarke Solo Flight</a> was originally published on <a href=\"http://emilia-clarke.com\">Enchanting Emilia Clarke</a></p></p>",
                "content": "<p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"http://emilia-clarke.com/gallery/albums/Photoshoots/111-2018-VanityFairSummer/normal_005.jpg\">External image</div>&nbsp;\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/photos/2018/05/in-photos-emilia-clarke-going-solo\" target=\"_blank\">VANITY FAIR</a> &ndash; It may be another year before Daenerys Targaryen appears on HBO, but Emilia Clarke has wrapped up shooting for the final season of Game of Thrones and is prepared for the big screen.</strong></p>\n\n<p>On a rainy April afternoon, Emilia Clarke enters the bright, airy Egyptian galleries of the Metropolitan Museum of Art the way so many movie-lovers before her have: quoting Billy Crystal in When Harry Met Sally. Adopting the unsourceable accent Crystal uses opposite Meg Ryan in a famously improvised scene filmed in this very room, Clarke starts stuttering, &ldquo;Pah-pah-paprikash.&rdquo; Our amused if bewildered guide, too young to get the reference, adds the 1989 rom-com to her list of movie recommendations from Clarke, who has already gushed about the 2017 religious drama Novitiate. Chuckling over this unlikely double feature, Clarke assures her, &ldquo;You have two incredible movies coming your way.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>One reference the guide does get: Game of Thrones, the HBO juggernaut which stars Clarke as its most unstoppable heroine, Daenerys Targaryen. In fact, the very tour we&rsquo;re taking, put together by a company called Museum Hack, is based on the series, and offers a fan-friendly survey of the sometimes inscrutable displays of the Met. You don&rsquo;t have to be an art historian (our guide is an aspiring actress) to understand what Greek fire, Damascus blades, heraldry, mutilated men, samurai kamon, the dragon-born St. Margaret of Antioch, and an early female pharaoh have to do with wildfire, Valyrian steel, house words, and Clarke&rsquo;s world-famous alter ego.</p>\nAnd yet, despite her fame, Clarke has managed to spend a full half-hour in the museum sponging up our guide&rsquo;s trivia without being spotted. For years, Clarke&rsquo;s brown hair let her hide in plain sight, but she recently bleached it an icy Targaryen blond. So, why the invisibility? Maybe it&rsquo;s her height. &ldquo;We both have a thing about our stature not quite being what people expect,&rdquo; says her co-star Kit Harington, who, at five feet eight, has six inches on Clarke. Maybe it&rsquo;s her outfit&mdash;the gray overcoat, cream sweater, and jeans are a far cry from the cloaks and armor of Thrones. Or maybe it&rsquo;s her bright, decidedly non-intimidating personality. &ldquo;When I&rsquo;m goofing around with my pals, I&rsquo;m unrecognizable,&rdquo; she says. Harington calls Clarke&rsquo;s humor &ldquo;naughty,&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s certainly true that her informal, expletive-laced banter is a far cry from Daenerys&rsquo;s imperious tones. &ldquo;Sometimes, if I&rsquo;m in a really bad mood,&rdquo; Clarke notes, &ldquo;people are like, &lsquo;Khaleesi!&rsquo; &rdquo;\n\n<p>Finally, the spell of anonymity breaks, thanks to a display of competitiveness worthy of Game of Thrones. Our guide has challenged us to photograph as many birds and dragons as we can find in the paintings and sculptures on the tour, and Clarke is approaching the task with her usual effervescent zeal. Standing in the shadow of a stone Hatshepsut, one of patriarchal Egypt&rsquo;s first female pharaohs, she triumphantly displays one of the winged targets she has captured on her phone. &ldquo;This little birdie: Boom!&rdquo; she shouts, her voice ricocheting off the stone walls. A pair of young men look over, then descend, and, in thick French accents, ask for a photo. Clarke&rsquo;s triumphant grin tightens into a polite, distant smile.</p>\n\n<p>There it is: the face of Daenerys of the House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, the Unburnt, Queen of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons, who, over the course of seven seasons, has climbed from powerless pawn to resolute conqueror, forcing one rival after another to &ldquo;bend the knee&rdquo; or burn. As Daenerys has risen, so has Clarke, morphing from a struggling actress and part-time cater waiter to an international superstar and symbol of feminine fierceness. That journey is &ldquo;important and inspiring&mdash;particularly now, in our climate,&rdquo; says her close friend Rose Leslie, who played the wildling warrior Ygritte in early seasons of Game of Thrones. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s at the forefront of representing independent women.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>We still don&rsquo;t know if, as many expect, Daenerys Targaryen will win the right to rule the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, but we can be assured that Emilia Clarke will hang up her platinum wig for good when Game of Thrones ends its eight-season run, in 2019. There&rsquo;s still a lot of filming and post-production work to be done, but Clarke has already shot her character&rsquo;s final on-screen moments. &ldquo;It fucked me up,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Knowing that is going to be a lasting flavor in someone&rsquo;s mouth of what Daenerys is &hellip;&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Clarke has good reason to feel unsettled. Letting go of a culture-defining television role can be liberating, to be sure, but it can also be deflating&mdash;or worse. Jon Hamm may always be seen as Don Draper; Sarah Michelle Gellar is forever Buffy the Vampire Slayer; Jennifer Aniston will never not be Rachel. Fortunately, Clarke approaches this pivotal transition with a stubborn insistence on behaving like a normal, grounded human being. And her upcoming credits suggest that she&rsquo;s greatly in demand beyond Westeros.</p>\n\n<p>This month, Clarke, a self-described &ldquo;achievement junkie,&rdquo; joins the rapidly expanding Star Wars universe in Solo, a highly scrutinized origin story for Harrison Ford&rsquo;s Han Solo. Her well-honed gift for concealing every detail about her work&mdash;&ldquo;Everything in my life is a spoiler,&rdquo; she says&mdash;helped her get into character. Director Ron Howard, a Game of Thrones fan, explains that Qi&rsquo;ra, Han Solo&rsquo;s childhood friend turned unreliable ally, is secretive, slippery, and morally questionable&mdash;&ldquo;a much different sort of a character&rdquo; from Daenerys.</p>\n\n<p>If Solo becomes a major hit, it will give Clarke a rare chance to leap cleanly from one spectacularly successful genre franchise to another. But even if it doesn&rsquo;t, she has no shortage of options. An active participant in Time&rsquo;s Up, she has ambitious plans to write and produce her own material&mdash;and create new opportunities for other women in the industry. Discussing those issues, she begins to sound more like the fiery Daenerys. &ldquo;It becomes harder to separate you from the role when you&rsquo;ve been with it so long,&rdquo; she admits.</p>\n\n<p>Eight years ago, Dan Weiss and David Benioff were in trouble. Their pilot for Game of Thrones, an adaptation of George R. R. Martin&rsquo;s popular A Song of Ice and Fire book series, was a disaster. Along with re-shoots, the pair were looking to re-cast a few key roles, including the pivotal part of Daenerys Targaryen. Tall, willowy, and fair-haired, Tamzin Merchant, the actress originally cast as Khaleesi, was a far more conventional match for the character on the page. The second time around, Weiss and Benioff took a fresh look at the character.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Emilia was the only person we saw&mdash;and we saw hundreds&mdash;who could carry the full range that Daenerys required,&rdquo; the pair explained in tandem via e-mail. &ldquo;Young actors aren&rsquo;t often asked to play a combination of Joan of Arc, Lawrence of Arabia, and Napoleon.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>When Clarke started on the series, Daenerys was downtrodden, occasionally objectified, and stranded in a subplot that kept the character geographically distant from the main story and the actress isolated from most of her co-stars. &ldquo;I was cut off from the rest of the cast,&rdquo; Clarke says. Over the years, as the famously cutthroat Thrones has thinned its sprawling ensemble, Clarke has risen in the ranks, snagging the show&rsquo;s flashiest, most empowering moments.</p>\n\n<p>In an era when network and streaming platforms alike are struggling to get anyone to tune in, Game of Thrones has become one of the last surviving holdovers from the must-see TV era. For a handful of weeks every year, HBO owns Sunday nights, with devotees watching live to avoid spoilers at the office Monday morning. Clearing its own very high ratings bar, Thrones commanded an average of 32.8 million viewers in its 2017 season. Its 38 wins make it the most-awarded scripted-TV series in Emmy history.</p>\n\n<p>That glaring spotlight has made Daenerys a cultural touchstone&mdash;not to mention a costume-party staple, with Madonna, Katy Perry, Khlo&eacute; Kardashian, and Kristen Bell among her many famous impersonators. At a recent charity auction, Brad Pitt offered six figures to spend an evening with Clarke and Harington, only to be outbid. Last year, Daenerys finally powered into the heart of the series, earning long-awaited screen time with Harington and the rest of the surviving stars. Clarke, who has been nominated three times for best supporting actress at the Emmys, may soon be gunning for lead honors. &ldquo;Everything in my life is a spoiler,&rdquo; Clarke says.</p>\n\n<p>Clarke&rsquo;s upbringing in the bucolic countryside an hour outside of London couldn&rsquo;t be farther from the dysfunctional family dynamics that forged the orphaned Daenerys. Emilia&rsquo;s mother, Jennifer, is a businesswoman who currently runs the Anima Foundation, a charity aimed at raising awareness of specialty brain-injury care, and her father, Peter, was a theatrical sound engineer who prized education above all else. &ldquo;Your bookshelf should be bigger than your TV,&rdquo; he liked to remind Emilia and her older brother, Bennett. &ldquo;My mum, my brother, my dad, and I would sit around a table, and my happiest place was just discussing stuff,&rdquo; Emilia says. &ldquo;I really value intelligence. I&rsquo;m one of the very fortunate few people who really likes their family. I just like hanging out with them.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Clarke isn&rsquo;t the first woman in her family to engage in high-stakes identity juggling. Her maternal grandmother wore light makeup to disguise the fact that she was half Indian, owing to her mother&rsquo;s very secret affair with a mysterious man from the colonial subcontinent. &ldquo;The fact that [my grandmother] had to hide her skin color, essentially, and try desperately to fit in with everyone else must&rsquo;ve been incredibly difficult,&rdquo; Clarke says. &ldquo;So, yeah: history of fighters.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Emilia&rsquo;s parents saved up to send her to a pair of upper-crust boarding schools&mdash;Rye St. Antony and St. Edward&rsquo;s, both in Oxford&mdash;but she never felt at home with her much wealthier classmates. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t really fit in, like everybody who ever went to school ever.&rdquo; So she channeled her energy into performing. She was rejected the first time she applied to acting school, but eventually Drama Centre London claimed her from the waiting list when another student broke her leg and dropped out. There, she finally found the &ldquo;artistically inclined&rdquo; friends who would keep her grounded amid the circus of international fame.</p>\n\n<p>The jet-setting Clarke clings tightly to her roots even as her life and career take her ever farther from the Home Counties. For one thing, she recently got her brother a gig in the Thrones camera department. &ldquo;This job can be so alienating,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re in a trailer by yourself. You&rsquo;re in a car by yourself. You&rsquo;re in a plane. You&rsquo;re in a plane. You&rsquo;re in a plane. That&rsquo;s what success looks like if you&rsquo;re an actor. Success looks like being alone.&rdquo; Clarke stays sharp by devouring &ldquo;nerdy&rdquo; podcasts on a range of topics from politics to science. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s so informed,&rdquo; says Rose Leslie. &ldquo;She has an opinion on every topic.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Clarke&rsquo;s father passed away in 2016 after a long battle with cancer. At the time, Emilia was in the U.S. shooting the upcoming thriller Above Suspicion and couldn&rsquo;t break away to say her final good-byes. &ldquo;It still sucks. Grief sucks. He doesn&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m doing now,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it before I start crying.&rdquo; After a couple of romances with famous men&mdash;first, Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane, then, reportedly, actor Jai Courtney, a brief souvenir from her Terminator Genisys shoot&mdash;Clarke swore off dating actors. In fact, she hasn&rsquo;t been romantically linked in some time. When Solo premiered at Cannes, in May, she had hoped to walk the red carpet with her brother, and her goal in general is to keep her relationships out of the news. &ldquo;The guys that I&rsquo;ve met in my life that are dicks, I voluntarily walk the fuck away from them,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just bad taste. People shouldn&rsquo;t know about those choices.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Clarke usually appears in public with various non-famous &ldquo;mates&rdquo; from her drama-school days. Her &ldquo;perma-plus-one&rdquo; is Lola Frears, daughter of director Stephen Frears. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t got me no celebrity friends,&rdquo; Clarke says. &ldquo;My squad? They don&rsquo;t let me get away with anything. There&rsquo;s not a lot of actors I relate to.&rdquo; Leslie, a rare exception to Emilia&rsquo;s rule, confirms that Clarke&rsquo;s longtime friends keep her in check: &ldquo;There would be a ticking off or a bollocking if they felt she was no longer the lovely lady that they have always known.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The Star Wars tradition of featuring morally upright heroines, among them Carrie Fisher&rsquo;s General Leia, Daisy Ridley&rsquo;s Rey, and Felicity Jones&rsquo;s Jyn Erso, was part of what drew Emilia Clarke to the role of Qi&rsquo;ra in Solo, but it was the chance to break the mold that really sold her. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to hit you with a character that could very easily well be a dude, because you question her motives,&rdquo; she says, sitting in a back corner of the Met&rsquo;s no-frills cafeteria snacking on a pear and sipping English-breakfast tea from a paper cup. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s really fucking exciting in the Star Wars universe, because that has never happened.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Before accepting the Solo role, Clarke had to ask Game of Thrones show-runners Weiss and Benioff for permission to complicate their plans for a final season by adding a demanding Star Wars filming schedule to the mix. They didn&rsquo;t hesitate. &ldquo;Solo felt like a great fit that would let her show off her versatility,&rdquo; Weiss and Benioff explained. &ldquo;Also, we figured she&rsquo;d probably get to shoot a ray gun. Ray guns are something we just can&rsquo;t offer, unfortunately.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Swapping dragons for ray guns, Emilia Clarke was eager to prove her mettle in a whole new galaxy. But that plan hit a snag when the Solo production fell spectacularly and publicly apart. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not gonna lie,&rdquo; Clarke says. &ldquo;I struggled with Qi&rsquo;ra quite a lot. I was like: &lsquo;Y&rsquo;all need to stop telling me that she&rsquo;s &ldquo;film noir,&rdquo; because that ain&rsquo;t a note.&rsquo; &rdquo; Frustrated by the lack of direction, she turned to Solo&rsquo;s father-and-son screenwriters, Lawrence and Jon Kasdan, for support. Then, four and a half months into shooting, co-directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller exited the project, citing &ldquo;creative differences.&rdquo; Production was put on hold until they were replaced by Ron Howard, a longtime friend of franchise creator George Lucas&rsquo;s. With a brand-new director and an ambitious re-shoot schedule&mdash;Clarke reluctantly agrees when I call those first months &ldquo;a high-budget dress rehearsal&rdquo;&mdash;Solo still had to hit its opening date, in May of the following year.</p>\n\n<p>Clarke says Howard&rsquo;s arrival &ldquo;saved&rdquo; the movie: &ldquo;All hail to [Lucasfilm president] Kathy [Kennedy] for hiring Ron.&rdquo; Slipping into a mocking impression of herself, Clarke re-enacts a self-pitying therapy session with Howard over a private meal they shared before resuming production. &ldquo;He even feigned enthusiasm!&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I know for a fact he had that discussion with everybody. I think we all came to set feeling like his favorite. It makes for a really happy load of actors, with our egos.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Howard recalls that dinner a bit differently. The former child star of The Andy Griffith Show saw in Clarke &ldquo;the kind of pragmatism and a can-do spirit that often comes from people who have cut their teeth doing television.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I know some of how tough it was for her,&rdquo; Harington says. &ldquo;But she&rsquo;s pretty tough as well.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Clarke wasn&rsquo;t privy to everything that led up to the director swap, but she wasn&rsquo;t entirely surprised, either. &ldquo;When it comes to that amount of money, you&rsquo;re almost waiting for that to happen. Money fucks us all up, doesn&rsquo;t it? There&rsquo;s so much pressure. Han Solo is a really beloved character. This is a really important movie for the franchise as a whole. It&rsquo;s a shit ton of money. A shit ton of people. A shit ton of expectations.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Solo wasn&rsquo;t the first troubled blockbuster to test Clarke&rsquo;s resilience. If anything, the production of 2015&rsquo;s Terminator Genisys was more chaotic. She watched frequent Thrones director Alan Taylor get &ldquo;eaten and chewed up on Terminator. He was not the director I remembered. He didn&rsquo;t have a good time. No one had a good time.&rdquo; When the film underperformed at the box office, she was &ldquo;relieved&rdquo; to not have to return for any sequels. News of the rocky production traveled, and Clarke says the crew on the famously disastrous Fantastic Four, which was filming nearby, even had jackets made that read, AT LEAST WE&rsquo;RE NOT ON TERMINATOR. &ldquo;Just to give you a summary,&rdquo; she says, laughing.</p>\n\n<p>Rumors spreading between film sets is one thing, but the Solo tumult was covered exhaustively in the trades and on fan sites, adding another layer of pressure to an already pressurized project. &ldquo;I hope we did it good, then, because people have all this gossip,&rdquo; Clarke says. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want people to go, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the bit where it all went wrong. That&rsquo;s the bit, I know it.&rsquo; I just really hope that people have a good time, that it&rsquo;s good, and, you know, selfishly, that I&rsquo;m not shit and that people don&rsquo;t write reviews going, &lsquo;Oh my God, that&rsquo;s, like, the worst acting I&rsquo;ve ever seen in my life. Wow. How did they give her the part?&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>For all her anxieties about how her performance will go over, Clarke and I are both energized by the Solo footage we&rsquo;ve seen. Clarke&rsquo;s easy chemistry with Donald Glover, who plays fan favorite Lando Calrissian, is evident from their very first on-screen meeting. And though her shifting allegiances mean she has to play a range of emotions opposite Alden Ehrenreich&rsquo;s Han Solo, she endows every twist with an undercurrent of romantic possibility. Tonally closer to the Indiana Jones movies than to, say, Rogue One, Solo marks the franchise&rsquo;s return to lighthearted, fast-paced capers.</p>\n\n<p>Clarke&mdash;who spends most Thrones battles on the backs of her C.G.I. dragons&mdash;was eager to jump into the fray with some hand-to-hand combat. &ldquo;She had to deal with quite a large sword and some pretty elaborate fight choreography, and she made it look easy,&rdquo; Ehrenreich says. With all the re-shoots and reconfigured plotting, she also had to fight to keep some of her favorite moments in. &ldquo;That is going to be badass as fuck,&rdquo; she told the filmmakers of a showstopping Qi&rsquo;ra moment that made the cut. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget your audience.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Long before they shared a scene together, Clarke and Harington had become friends thanks to their time on the Game of Thrones promotional circuit. It was through Harington that Clarke met Rose Leslie. An adept mimic, Clarke impersonates a &ldquo;smitten&rdquo; Harington mooning over his on-screen lover and future real-life fianc&eacute;e in the early days of the show: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the best human in the world. She&rsquo;s called Rose.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Clarke has a teasing relationship with Harington. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell him, &lsquo;Kit, stop being a dick&mdash;stop being so grumpy.&rsquo; Like I would with my brother.&rdquo; And as the two transition in these final seasons from real-life friends to partners in TV&rsquo;s biggest romance (albeit one complicated by incest), the ribbing has only increased. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve known someone for six years, and they&rsquo;re best friends with your girlfriend, and you&rsquo;re best friends with them,&rdquo; Harington says, &ldquo;there is something unnatural and strange about doing a love scene. We&rsquo;ll end up kissing and then we&rsquo;re just pissing ourselves with laughter because it&rsquo;s so ridiculous.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s goofy,&rdquo; Weiss and Benioff confirm. &ldquo;We have tried to let some of Emilia&rsquo;s humor and light seep into Daenerys whenever possible. Who says conquerors can&rsquo;t be funny?&rdquo; A memorable Season Four conversation between Daenerys and her right-hand woman, Missandei, concerning a eunuch&rsquo;s &ldquo;pillar and stones,&rdquo; for instance, is much more Clarke than Targaryen. Sadly, it&rsquo;s unclear how much space there will be in the show&rsquo;s climactic final season for bawdy, Clarke-ish humor. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing all this weird shit,&rdquo; Clarke says. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll know what I mean when you see it.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>In the final episodes of a show with a body count as high as Game of Thrones&rsquo;, Clarke never really knows when she might be filming her last moments with a member of the cast. She&rsquo;s also shooting for the first time with several of the show&rsquo;s top stars, including Sophie Turner and Maisie Williams, who play the formidable Stark sisters.</p>\n\n<p>Clarke is well aware that the strong women of the series are leaving some kind of imprint on the culture, but she&rsquo;s saving up all her big-picture reflections on Daenerys for later: &ldquo;This is going to be a Band-Aid that I&rsquo;m going to rip off.&rdquo; To help with that process, she started keeping a daily journal of her last season. With cell phones banned from the set due to security concerns, it&rsquo;s her best hope of chronicling the final days of Daenerys. Selfies are off limits, but Clarke has asked set photographer Helen Sloan to snap the occasional behind-the-scenes photo. Both the journal and the photos, Clarke hints, may be available to the show&rsquo;s fans someday.</p>\n\n<p>Clarke is unsurprisingly, and contractually, evasive when it comes to specifics of the concluding six episodes. Heavy hints in the most recent season indicate that, in addition to contending with the usual climactic end-of-the-world crises, Daenerys will also be grappling with more intimate parenthood and family issues. Here, Clarke and her on-screen alter ego may have something in common. Friends like Leslie and Harington are settling down to build their own families (&ldquo;Their wedding is going to be siiiiick,&rdquo; Clarke says), and an old schoolmate recently made Clarke godmother to a highly photogenic baby boy who makes regular appearances on her Instagram account. She lights up when talking about him.</p>\n\n<p>Talking about her own parents evokes other emotions. The wounds from the loss of her father are still fresh, but her mother remains an inspiration. If all goes according to plan, it&rsquo;s Jennifer Clarke who will provide the map for Clarke&rsquo;s very first post-Thrones steps. After the show ends, Clarke plans to re-create a road trip her mother took in 1972 to Yosemite and the redwoods of Northern California. With best friend and scriptwriter Lola Frears by her side, Clarke intends to spend part of the trip working on ideas for new projects. Her agents offered to take these ideas to &ldquo;guys&rdquo; with writing experience, but her answer to that was pure Daenerys: &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m going to take it to me.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Citing Reese Witherspoon, Greta Gerwig, and other actresses turned creators as inspiration, Clarke says she wants to work with as many female filmmakers as she can. As for the conventional industry wisdom that women can&rsquo;t work together without infighting? &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fucking bullshit. It&rsquo;s so annoying.&rdquo; An active member of Time&rsquo;s Up, Clarke negotiated with Weiss and Benioff in 2014 to ensure she maintained parity with her male counterparts. She and four co-stars&mdash;Harington, Lena Headey (Cersei Lannister), Peter Dinklage (Tyrion Lannister), and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Jaime Lannister)&mdash;reportedly each landed $300,000 per episode, a dazzling figure that skyrocketed to half a million per episode for the final two seasons. &ldquo;I get fucking paid the same as my guy friends,&rdquo; Clarke says. &ldquo;We made sure of that.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>And while Clarke would be thrilled to have her own Lady Bird or Big Little Lies, that&rsquo;s not all she&rsquo;s after. She says she&rsquo;s &ldquo;desperate&rdquo; to make documentaries and shine a light on underserved causes. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the shit that gets me going personally.&rdquo; Inspired by her father&rsquo;s cancer ordeal, Clarke is especially passionate about the risks Brexit poses to the U.K.&rsquo;s National Health Service, and she was recently named ambassador to the Royal College of Nursing. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s something I have in common with Dae-nerys,&rdquo; she says suddenly, after several hours of explaining all the reasons she and her character are nothing alike. &ldquo;I really feel for people and I want to help them. Not to sound too much like Oprah Winfrey.&rdquo; She pauses, and thinks again. &ldquo;Fuck that, I&rsquo;m gonna sound like Oprah and I&rsquo;m going to be proud of it.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>In the midst of the twin tornadoes of Star Wars and Game of Thrones, Clarke acknowledges that most of her choices these days are &ldquo;studio choices.&rdquo; And if Solo is a hit, Clarke could be working for Lucasfilm for years to come. But Harington sees something else in her future: &ldquo;She&rsquo;s done, far more than me or most people in the cast, these very high-budget, big-hitting blockbusters. Hopefully Star Wars continues for her and she does more of them. But I think she&rsquo;s an incredibly talented actor, and I would love to see her do something which is a more focused character piece, because the ones she&rsquo;s done are brilliant.&rdquo; Clarke&rsquo;s effervescent performance in 2016&rsquo;s romantic weepy Me Before You&mdash;a surprise hit at the box office&mdash;hints at what she&rsquo;s capable of.</p>\n\n<p>Clarke wants to stretch herself, and explore a new-media landscape where creators no longer have to rely on large companies in order to get their projects made. &ldquo;Everyone can. Get your iPhone out. Let&rsquo;s do something. You know what I mean?&rdquo; And with 17 million followers on Instagram, Clarke has the power to make and launch her own projects. Her recent Thrones-themed fund-raising Instagram video for the Royal College of Nursing Foundation racked up more than seven million views in just three days.</p>\n\n<p>All that takes some of the heat off Clarke as she decides how to follow up roles in two of entertainment&rsquo;s biggest franchises. She doesn&rsquo;t necessarily need another monster hit. She can afford to take her time, listen to herself, and do something that feels true to who she is&mdash;whoever that may be.</p>\n\n<p>The most obvious evidence of the blur between Daenerys and Clarke is the relatively new shock of blond hair on her head. &ldquo;I did this, which was frigging stupid,&rdquo; she says, fingering the blunt-cut ends of her bleached hair.</p>\n\n<p>When Kit Harington trimmed his famous curls in 2015, fans were led to believe his character, presumed dead, wouldn&rsquo;t be returning to the show the following season. (He did.) But Clarke swears her decision to go blonde has nothing at all to do with Daenerys&rsquo;s fate. &ldquo;I got to a point where I said I just want to look in the mirror and see something different. So I was just like, &lsquo;Fuck it, it&rsquo;s the last season. I&rsquo;m going to dye my hair blond.&rsquo; &rdquo; Clarke jokes that she immediately felt remorse and bought nine baseball caps online. &ldquo;But they don&rsquo;t go with your outfit, so I don&rsquo;t wear them.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Clarke&rsquo;s brown hair had always been her shield. The blond hair makes it harder to slip back into her pre-fame life. Partying with her old friends is tricky because their friends get &ldquo;weird&rdquo; about it, and she misses the mundane pleasures of, say, running errands for her mother. &ldquo;What I get most heartbroken about is that those opportunities are almost completely gone.&rdquo; Then she catches herself, and apologizes for moaning about the &ldquo;champagne problems&rdquo; of fame. &ldquo;If I were reading this, I&rsquo;d be like, &lsquo;Cheer the fuck up, love.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Back underneath that statue at the Met, Emilia Clarke cranes her neck up to get a closer look at the ancient pharaoh&rsquo;s smooth granite face. Hatshepsut wears a false beard that allowed her to pass more easily through the male-dominated world. Our guide points out a faint piece of carved string running up the pharaoh&rsquo;s jawline holding the disguise in place. Thinking about it later, Clarke, who knows a thing or two about disguises, passing, alter egos, and powerful women, shakes her head in astonishment. &ldquo;That is some fascinating shit right there.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>A towering granite Daenerys statue may never find its way into the hallowed halls of the Met, but it&rsquo;s not clear Emilia Clarke wants that anyway. As we duck out of the Met a bit behind schedule, only to find that it&rsquo;s raining and our sleek hired car is nowhere in sight, Clarke gamely suggests we rush out into the downpour and dive into the back of a yellow cab. Our driver doesn&rsquo;t recognize Clarke, either, which puts her at ease. Unsure how to get to where we&rsquo;re going, he passes his smartphone to her so she can type the hotel&rsquo;s address into his G.P.S. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, mate,&rdquo; she announces. &ldquo;Your little app will get us there!&rdquo; A satisfied smile plays on her face as the taxi twists, turns, and bumps along. She looks happier than she ever has riding a dragon.</p><a href=\"denied:javascript:;\"><i></i>Read the rest of the article</a><a href=\"denied:javascript:;\">Show less</a>\n\n<p><a href=\"#\"><img src=\"https://assets.tumblr.com/images/inline_placeholder.png\" width=\"18\" height=\"14\"/></a></p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"http://emilia-clarke.com/gallery/albums/Photoshoots/111-2018-VanityFairSummer/thumb_002.jpg\">External image</div><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"http://emilia-clarke.com/gallery/albums/Photoshoots/111-2018-VanityFairSummer/thumb_003.jpg\">External image</div><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"http://emilia-clarke.com/gallery/albums/Photoshoots/111-2018-VanityFairSummer/thumb_004.jpg\">External image</div><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"http://emilia-clarke.com/gallery/albums/Magazines/2018/2018-VanityFair-Summer/thumb_001.jpg\">External image</div>&nbsp;\n<p><strong>Gallery Links:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>PHOTOSHOOTS &amp; OUTTAKES &gt; <a href=\"http://emilia-clarke.com/gallery/thumbnails.php?album=997\"><strong>2018 Vanity Fair Magazine</strong></a></li>\n<li>MAGAZINES &gt; 2018 &gt; <a href=\"http://emilia-clarke.com/gallery/thumbnails.php?album=1002\"><strong>2018 Vanity Fair &ndash; Summer</strong></a></li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"http://emilia-clarke.com/news/2139-press-gallery-emilia-clarke-solo-flight/\" title=\"Go to the original post.\">Press/Gallery: Emilia Clarke Solo Flight</a> was originally published on <a href=\"http://emilia-clarke.com\">Enchanting Emilia Clarke</a></p></p>",
