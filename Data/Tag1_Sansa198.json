I hope you\u00a0have a wonderful week.</i></p><hr><p>Sansa and Margaery had first come together one evening in a garden at King\u2019s landing. A small rose garden that was tucked away from prying eyes and was watched by mainly Olenna\u2019s spies.\u00a0They had come together with flowers in their hair, caution in their touches and a hesitance to their words. It had all begun during those sparse moments when neither woman was being crushed under the cruel weight of the world. It had been an accident, but it had been perfect.\u00a0</p><p>Surprisingly,\u00a0Sansa had been the one to act first.</p><p>She had spoken of her fears, of the dreams she had once had, of the hope that she would be saved. Margaery had listened, not saying a word, hardly even breathing. And, when she was finished Sansa had awaited with bated breath for Margaery to turn one her, to throw her to lions. Instead, Margaery had begun to speak as well. If Sansa\u2019s words had escaped from her in a rush, Margaery\u2019s were the exact opposite. She spoke in soft tones, her voice barely above a whisper and sometimes her silence explained more than her words. The two of them became each other\u2019s confidence, the only piece of happiness that they each had claim to.</p><p>It had not taken long before those moments of spoken truth turned to soft touches, laughter and kisses. Sansa had always believed that she was in love, she had thought Joffery was her Prince, that Loras would be her knight in shining armour. Sansa had never been more wrong. The love that she felt for Margaery was unlike anything she had ever felt, it was tender, pure and ever so perfect. Loving Margaery was easier than breathing and at times she felt as if they were two halves of one soul.</p><p>Margaery had never been in love. She had flirted with the idea of it, but never had she dared even contemplate the idea until Sansa. For Margaery loving Sansa was terrifying. Margaery had always been in charge of her emotions, her grandmother had taught her from a young age how to control herself, how to become the perfect lady. But, Sansa made Margaery want to run away from her responsibilities. To travel the world, with nothing but the love they held for each other. The love that Margaery felt for Sansa was uncontrollable and consuming. \u00a0</p><p>But, the small haven they had built was torn apart. They had gone down different roads. Separated by fate. The Dragon Queen had come bringing fire and blood. The North had risen up, naming a King in the North and the dead rose from their slumber.</p><p>Yet, they had survived, they had survived it all. </p><p>The world now was so different from the one they had been born into, some of it was changed for the better, some for the worse. They had met once after the fall of the walkers for a mere hour and it was as if no time had passed at all. They had been hurried in their coupling. Margaery had worn high necked dresses for days due to the mark that Sansa has left on her neck and Sansa could feel the bruises that Margaery\u2019s fingers had left behind on her thighs for weeks. They had agreed it wouldn\u2019t happen again, that they were women grown and that their love had been that of two young girls, na\u00efve to the ways of the world. </p><p>Oh, how wrong they were.</p><p>No matter what it seemed that they just kept coming back to each other. It was as if fate was apologising for all of the obstacles it had placed in their paths, for all the time it had kept them apart and the suffering they had endured. It was as if fate had decided to finally give them what they wanted. </p><p>Neither of them had married though there had been plenty of offers. They never spoke of their relationship but, Arya always looked at them knowingly and Willas seemed to constantly be encouraging Margaery to travel North.</p><h2><b>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 XxX</b></h2><p>If anyone were to ask Sansa\u2019s opinion she would have told them it was funny how everything involving them always began in the garden. From the Watergardens of Dorne, to the Gardens of Gelenei in Braavos and Highgarden. Their love, seemed to blossom like the flowers that made the gardens their home. Though perhaps it was fitting that they would both be drawn to such places. Sansa had always loved flowers as a girl and it was no secret she adored them still as a woman grown. While Margaery was a Tyrell, the House of the golden rose sigil. </p><p>When she was younger Sansa had feared the Godswood, disliked it for the power that it held. Now, all she felt within it was love and safety. The Godswood of Winterfell seemed to chase away her fears, reminding her that she was home. The trees loomed above her creating a dense canopy of red and warm steam drifted up from the three small pools.</p><p>The pale blue dress she wore was rather light by Northern standards, lacking any fur and having a rather low neckline in comparison to the dresses she wore during the middle of Winter. </p><p>It was the complete opposite to Margaery\u2019s dress. In fact, what Margaery was wearing could hardly be called a dress and Sansa had hardly been able to hold back her laughter when she had seen what her lover had chosen to wear. A white coat made of the fur from ice-bears was draped around the smaller woman\u2019s frame, practically engulfing her. Currently Sansa could only see Margaery\u2019s large brown eyes, the beautiful brunette having decided to wear a thick white fur cap. It was not at all in Northern fashion and Sansa wondered what it would take for her to persuade her lover into wearing a Northern style dress.</p><p>Neither of them said a word as Margaery walked up to Sansa, reaching for her hand. The two of them walked towards the hot springs, kneeling down and removing their shoes before dipping their feet into the warm water. Sansa couldn\u2019t help giggling when Margaery nearly toppled over trying to bend down, the ever so graceful woman appearing more like a snowball than a Lady.</p><p>Over the years everything between them seemed to have a hidden meaning. They could tell how the other was feeling by the tone of voice they were using, if Margaery was being overly sweet than Sansa knew her lover was unhappy, tired and stressed. If Margaery reached out and entwined their pinkies together it meant that she needed strength, the strength to get through a memory, a nightmare that Sansa wished she could make disappear. </p><p>The two of them talked for hours, relishing the time they had together before removing their clothes and slipping into the water. Neither wanted to leave, both of them holding onto each other, imprinting every moment into their memory. \u00a0</p><p>When Margaery left a few days later Sansa would remember Margaery soft skin, the way that she gasped breathlessly when she came undone and the promises and sweet declarations of love. </p><p>Sansa would remember every moment of her time with Margaery and treasure it, protecting it until the moment when they could meet again. </p><p>Sansa didn\u2019t pray anymore, not to any of the Gods for they had never answered her prayers. But, she did hope. Sansa hoped that the peace lasted, that the dragon Queen would keep her promises, that the North would stay strong and that those she loved would find happiness. Sansa had hoped for so many things when she was younger, but now she was careful not to hope for too many things. She made sure to hope for only the most important thing. She hoped that one day those fleeting touches and stolen kisses wouldn\u2019t have to be hidden. That one day they wouldn\u2019t have hide away in a garden. That one day she could just lie in the arms she felt safest in for an entire day without worry. Sansa hoped, she hoped that within in this new age she might finally be allowed keep her happiness. </p><h2><b>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 XxX</b></h2><p>The gardens had always been Margaery\u2019s domain, it was where her secrets were made and her truths revealed. \u00a0The Godswood was no different for it was a garden and a Tyrell was always at home in a garden. </p><p>The wind was biting and she couldn\u2019t stop herself from shivering, even though Sansa had been sure to assure that currently the North was experiencing what they called \u2018summer\u2019. Sometimes Margaery didn\u2019t understand why Sansa loved her. Most people would have thought this was because Sansa was stunning, tall and voluptuous, with red hair that flowed down her back in a beautiful Northern braid. But, for Margaery her doubts had nothing to do with the beauty of her lover. </p><p>No, Margaery didn\u2019t understand why Sansa, a pure, intelligent, kind hearted woman who had endured so much could bear to love her. Margaery had never apologised for who she was, for being cunning and self-preserving at times. The memory of Sansa in her arms had kept her alive, it had kept her from loosing all hope of a better world. Sansa was Margaery\u2019s hope, her promise of a better future.</p><p>The time apart was painful, though they tried their best to stay together. They visited each other for months on end, taking diplomatic trips to Dorne or Braavos where they could change into common clothes and walk the streets hand in hand without fear.</p><p>But, sometimes when they were together it was more painful than being apart. Margaery had to restrain herself from wrapping her arm possessively around Sansa\u2019s waist when a man attempted to court her. The memory of the soft, reverent touches that they shared and the way she stole Sansa\u2019s breath replayed over and over in her head. Reminding her that what they shared did not need to be public, nor did it need the labels that their society wished to dictate to them. They loved each other. </p><p>In the Godswood she could hardly keep her hands to herself as she whispered sweet nothings into the shell of Sansa\u2019s ear, kissing her lover until both of them had to pull away in need of air. Lover, Margaery loved that word, for Sansa was hers and she was Sansa\u2019s. \u00a0</p><p>Margaery had always been the dreamer, with her head in the clouds and her heart on her sleeve. Her grandmother had taught her to guard her heart, but had never quite dragged Margaery into reality. Margaery had once dreamed of being a Queen, she had dreamed of playing the \u2018game of thrones\u2019. And though she had lost the \u2018game of thrones\u2019 in the end,\u00a0admittedly she had played it better than most. Margaery had never dreamed of love, but now, it was all that she imagined when she closed her eyes. She dreamed of a better future, a place where everyone could find some form of happiness. Margaery dreamed of a better world filled with better people. But, if there was one thing that Margaery dreamed of the most it was Sansa, with her red hair, cornflower blue eyes and lips softer than the petal of any rose. She dreamed of a future where they could touch, speak and love as they both pleased, of a future where children who needed love and affection ran through a garden of roses and smiles were common place. Margaery dreamed.</p>",

I hope you\u00a0have a wonderful week.</i></p><hr><p>Sansa and Margaery had first come together one evening in a garden at King\u2019s landing. A small rose garden that was tucked away from prying eyes and was watched by mainly Olenna\u2019s spies.\u00a0They had come together with flowers in their hair, caution in their touches and a hesitance to their words. It had all begun during those sparse moments when neither woman was being crushed under the cruel weight of the world. It had been an accident, but it had been perfect.\u00a0</p><p>Surprisingly,\u00a0Sansa had been the one to act first.</p><p>She had spoken of her fears, of the dreams she had once had, of the hope that she would be saved. Margaery had listened, not saying a word, hardly even breathing. And, when she was finished Sansa had awaited with bated breath for Margaery to turn one her, to throw her to lions. Instead, Margaery had begun to speak as well. If Sansa\u2019s words had escaped from her in a rush, Margaery\u2019s were the exact opposite. She spoke in soft tones, her voice barely above a whisper and sometimes her silence explained more than her words. The two of them became each other\u2019s confidence, the only piece of happiness that they each had claim to.</p><p>It had not taken long before those moments of spoken truth turned to soft touches, laughter and kisses. Sansa had always believed that she was in love, she had thought Joffery was her Prince, that Loras would be her knight in shining armour. Sansa had never been more wrong. The love that she felt for Margaery was unlike anything she had ever felt, it was tender, pure and ever so perfect. Loving Margaery was easier than breathing and at times she felt as if they were two halves of one soul.</p><p>Margaery had never been in love. She had flirted with the idea of it, but never had she dared even contemplate the idea until Sansa. For Margaery loving Sansa was terrifying. Margaery had always been in charge of her emotions, her grandmother had taught her from a young age how to control herself, how to become the perfect lady. But, Sansa made Margaery want to run away from her responsibilities. To travel the world, with nothing but the love they held for each other. The love that Margaery felt for Sansa was uncontrollable and consuming. \u00a0</p><p>But, the small haven they had built was torn apart. They had gone down different roads. Separated by fate. The Dragon Queen had come bringing fire and blood. The North had risen up, naming a King in the North and the dead rose from their slumber.</p><p>Yet, they had survived, they had survived it all. </p><p>The world now was so different from the one they had been born into, some of it was changed for the better, some for the worse. They had met once after the fall of the walkers for a mere hour and it was as if no time had passed at all. They had been hurried in their coupling. Margaery had worn high necked dresses for days due to the mark that Sansa has left on her neck and Sansa could feel the bruises that Margaery\u2019s fingers had left behind on her thighs for weeks. They had agreed it wouldn\u2019t happen again, that they were women grown and that their love had been that of two young girls, na\u00efve to the ways of the world. </p><p>Oh, how wrong they were.</p><p>No matter what it seemed that they just kept coming back to each other. It was as if fate was apologising for all of the obstacles it had placed in their paths, for all the time it had kept them apart and the suffering they had endured. It was as if fate had decided to finally give them what they wanted. </p><p>Neither of them had married though there had been plenty of offers. They never spoke of their relationship but, Arya always looked at them knowingly and Willas seemed to constantly be encouraging Margaery to travel North.</p><h2><b>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 XxX</b></h2><p>If anyone were to ask Sansa\u2019s opinion she would have told them it was funny how everything involving them always began in the garden. From the Watergardens of Dorne, to the Gardens of Gelenei in Braavos and Highgarden. Their love, seemed to blossom like the flowers that made the gardens their home. Though perhaps it was fitting that they would both be drawn to such places. Sansa had always loved flowers as a girl and it was no secret she adored them still as a woman grown. While Margaery was a Tyrell, the House of the golden rose sigil. </p><p>When she was younger Sansa had feared the Godswood, disliked it for the power that it held. Now, all she felt within it was love and safety. The Godswood of Winterfell seemed to chase away her fears, reminding her that she was home. The trees loomed above her creating a dense canopy of red and warm steam drifted up from the three small pools.</p><p>The pale blue dress she wore was rather light by Northern standards, lacking any fur and having a rather low neckline in comparison to the dresses she wore during the middle of Winter. </p><p>It was the complete opposite to Margaery\u2019s dress. In fact, what Margaery was wearing could hardly be called a dress and Sansa had hardly been able to hold back her laughter when she had seen what her lover had chosen to wear. A white coat made of the fur from ice-bears was draped around the smaller woman\u2019s frame, practically engulfing her. Currently Sansa could only see Margaery\u2019s large brown eyes, the beautiful brunette having decided to wear a thick white fur cap. It was not at all in Northern fashion and Sansa wondered what it would take for her to persuade her lover into wearing a Northern style dress.</p><p>Neither of them said a word as Margaery walked up to Sansa, reaching for her hand. The two of them walked towards the hot springs, kneeling down and removing their shoes before dipping their feet into the warm water. Sansa couldn\u2019t help giggling when Margaery nearly toppled over trying to bend down, the ever so graceful woman appearing more like a snowball than a Lady.</p><p>Over the years everything between them seemed to have a hidden meaning. They could tell how the other was feeling by the tone of voice they were using, if Margaery was being overly sweet than Sansa knew her lover was unhappy, tired and stressed. If Margaery reached out and entwined their pinkies together it meant that she needed strength, the strength to get through a memory, a nightmare that Sansa wished she could make disappear. </p><p>The two of them talked for hours, relishing the time they had together before removing their clothes and slipping into the water. Neither wanted to leave, both of them holding onto each other, imprinting every moment into their memory. \u00a0</p><p>When Margaery left a few days later Sansa would remember Margaery soft skin, the way that she gasped breathlessly when she came undone and the promises and sweet declarations of love. </p><p>Sansa would remember every moment of her time with Margaery and treasure it, protecting it until the moment when they could meet again. </p><p>Sansa didn\u2019t pray anymore, not to any of the Gods for they had never answered her prayers. But, she did hope. Sansa hoped that the peace lasted, that the dragon Queen would keep her promises, that the North would stay strong and that those she loved would find happiness. Sansa had hoped for so many things when she was younger, but now she was careful not to hope for too many things. She made sure to hope for only the most important thing. She hoped that one day those fleeting touches and stolen kisses wouldn\u2019t have to be hidden. That one day they wouldn\u2019t have hide away in a garden. That one day she could just lie in the arms she felt safest in for an entire day without worry. Sansa hoped, she hoped that within in this new age she might finally be allowed keep her happiness. </p><h2><b>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 XxX</b></h2><p>The gardens had always been Margaery\u2019s domain, it was where her secrets were made and her truths revealed. \u00a0The Godswood was no different for it was a garden and a Tyrell was always at home in a garden. </p><p>The wind was biting and she couldn\u2019t stop herself from shivering, even though Sansa had been sure to assure that currently the North was experiencing what they called \u2018summer\u2019. Sometimes Margaery didn\u2019t understand why Sansa loved her. Most people would have thought this was because Sansa was stunning, tall and voluptuous, with red hair that flowed down her back in a beautiful Northern braid. But, for Margaery her doubts had nothing to do with the beauty of her lover. </p><p>No, Margaery didn\u2019t understand why Sansa, a pure, intelligent, kind hearted woman who had endured so much could bear to love her. Margaery had never apologised for who she was, for being cunning and self-preserving at times. The memory of Sansa in her arms had kept her alive, it had kept her from loosing all hope of a better world. Sansa was Margaery\u2019s hope, her promise of a better future.</p><p>The time apart was painful, though they tried their best to stay together. They visited each other for months on end, taking diplomatic trips to Dorne or Braavos where they could change into common clothes and walk the streets hand in hand without fear.</p><p>But, sometimes when they were together it was more painful than being apart. Margaery had to restrain herself from wrapping her arm possessively around Sansa\u2019s waist when a man attempted to court her. The memory of the soft, reverent touches that they shared and the way she stole Sansa\u2019s breath replayed over and over in her head. Reminding her that what they shared did not need to be public, nor did it need the labels that their society wished to dictate to them. They loved each other. </p><p>In the Godswood she could hardly keep her hands to herself as she whispered sweet nothings into the shell of Sansa\u2019s ear, kissing her lover until both of them had to pull away in need of air. Lover, Margaery loved that word, for Sansa was hers and she was Sansa\u2019s. \u00a0</p><p>Margaery had always been the dreamer, with her head in the clouds and her heart on her sleeve. Her grandmother had taught her to guard her heart, but had never quite dragged Margaery into reality. Margaery had once dreamed of being a Queen, she had dreamed of playing the \u2018game of thrones\u2019. And though she had lost the \u2018game of thrones\u2019 in the end,\u00a0admittedly she had played it better than most. Margaery had never dreamed of love, but now, it was all that she imagined when she closed her eyes. She dreamed of a better future, a place where everyone could find some form of happiness. Margaery dreamed of a better world filled with better people. But, if there was one thing that Margaery dreamed of the most it was Sansa, with her red hair, cornflower blue eyes and lips softer than the petal of any rose. She dreamed of a future where they could touch, speak and love as they both pleased, of a future where children who needed love and affection ran through a garden of roses and smiles were common place. Margaery dreamed.</p>",
