So I won\u2019t add my voice to the mix in regards to what was included in the trailer, but I did want to discuss what wasn\u2019t included. </p><p>As expected, the trailer was tightly edited. We were given very little that wasn\u2019t set up the previous season and as many have already discussed, the trailer seems to focus on the first three episodes and the battle with the White Walkers. I know some people dismiss the importance of GOT trailers, but on the whole, they do tend to tell a cohesive story in relation to each season\u2019s narrative arc. Therefore, you can tell just as much by what is omitted from the trailer as to what is included, especially when the expected is missing.</p><p>So what was missing from the trailer that the audience expected to see, especially in light of S7?</p><h2><i>1. <b>Daenerys and her dragons missing from the White Walker battle.</b></i></h2><p>At the end of S7, Daenerys, her dragons and her army were heading North to \u201csave\u201d it from the approaching Army of the Dead. Jon (and the majority of the GA) is convinced that the dragons are key to defeating the Night King (while the dragons have the potential to be effective in thinning out the wights, the White Walkers are immune to fire). So like <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/myHfbeJjjc8bFgVOAD6sAmg\">@jonsalways</a> asked, where is Daenerys? I expected a token shot of her riding Drogon, a dragon breathing fire and destroying wights - something that demonstrated her self-appointed role as saviour of the North. Instead, we have have Daenerys arriving at Winterfell, approaching Jon in the crypts, visiting her dragons and being very pretty and apprehensive in Winterfell. Which is an odd decision, because Daenerys role in defeating the Army of the Dead is taken as canon by some viewers, so a shot of her atop Drogon is not only expected, but it gives absolutely nothing away. So why isn\u2019t she there?</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"274\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"snowsource:MBz67q_Tibeskzgw58JbiA:ZRfqQY2ggH1aw\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/cbb7d4dba230f1d51d41d848268a48e5/tumblr_pnwp9y2Dwi1xixo8uo2_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"274\" data-orig-width=\"540\"/></figure><h2><i>2. <b>Where is Bran and Tyrion?</b></i></h2><p>Both Bran and Tyrion appear only once in the trailer. Bran in the first 30 seconds and Tyrion in the last 30 seconds. Considering their narrative importance, their omission from the battle with the White Walkers is pretty conspicuous. Bran has spent seven seasons preparing for this moment, and while many are placing their bets of Daenerys being the key to defeating the Night King, my money is on Bran. Therefore it makes sense to play down Bran\u2019s importance, only to blindside the audience with how Bran is integral in defeating the Night King.</p><p>Tyrion\u2019s absence from the battle is expected. He is Hand of the Queen and not expected to take up arms. But Tyrion is also absent (at least from the brief shots from the trailer) from where he is expected to be - either with Davos pacing the battlements or in the crypts with Varys. So why wasn\u2019t he shown? Is he no longer in Winterfell?</p><h2><i>3. <b>Where is Sansa?</b></i></h2><p>Sansa\u2019s absence from the battle is also expected, and while it could indicate absolutely nothing, I was surprised that Sansa wasn\u2019t shown waiting out the battle in the crypts with Varys (similar to her waiting out the siege of Kings Landing with Cersei in S2). Instead, they chose two shots of Sansa looking concerned - both of which followed (coincidentally I\u2019m sure) a Jon and Daenerys scene.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"bethnoel:2qw3MqQxH5UTN_l7CXqQQQ:ZSYFWd2ggKida\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2f8fb87e69af5cb9e9f98d1ed960886a/tumblr_pnwrggtatP1wteim4o1_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-orig-width=\"540\"/></figure><h2><i>4. <b>Oh Theon, where art thou?</b></i></h2><p>S7 ended with Theon on his way to rescue Yara from Euron\u2019s clutches.

It captures some of the lightness, some of the good; that inherent sense of&nbsp;&ldquo;it will all work out in the end,&rdquo;&ndash;even though we know by now that we should definitely not put any faith into that statement.&nbsp;</p><p>It is quietly regal and elegant, speaking to the royalty and thrones at play, though without the intensity of when the game is finally afoot. It hands you atmosphere and the tiniest bit of plot&ndash;enough to be mysterious but not enough to give anything away.&nbsp;</p><p>It is an introduction, a quick peek into what <i>could</i>&nbsp;be, but will most definitely not; the calm before the storm. The moment of peace that walks onward, unknowing that the ground beneath its feet is only moments from giving way and that everything is about to change.&nbsp;</p><p>All of this&ndash;the atmosphere, the delicate sense of foreboding buried underneath light and blinking rays of hope&ndash;lends to the overall tone of the piece, making it unique and striking; especially when considered against all that we know about the show in hindsight.&nbsp;</p><p>It is one of those short and sweet, near-perfect pieces of music that is crafted unbelievably well. <b>You&rsquo;ll Be Queen One Day</b>&nbsp;is versatile in its ability to be creatively applied while clinging to that distinctive tone that makes it intriguing to begin with.&nbsp;</p><p>As the end of GOT approaches, I think I&rsquo;ll find myself listening to this piece more and more. While it was, in a sense, the beginning, there is something about it that also feels final&ndash;a curtain drawing closed and the lights coming back up. The melancholic end to something that has been with us for many years.&nbsp;</p><p>And there is no other song I&rsquo;d rather hear when it makes its last farewell.&nbsp;</p></p>",
