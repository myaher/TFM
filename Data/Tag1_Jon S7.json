Not one bit.</p><p>Why? Why don\u2019t I believe this? Am I in denial? George said so, after all. Right?</p><p>No. </p><p>George said that he doesn\u2019t THINK it will be different. We\u2019ve known for years now that George gave dumb and dumber an outline for them to follow. And we know that he said that they\u2019d end up at the same point but take different roads. That was back in 2014/15 when GoT had just passed the source material. And at the time, George had no reason to suspect that they\u2019d absolutely fuck his life\u2019s work. I mean, George himself acknowledged that the show had made same changes that he wished he would have done. One of the main ones being Arya meeting Tywin at Harrenhal. Practically everyone agrees that it\u2019s one of the best changes. So, at the time, George had no reason to worry. And then S7 came out. And it was clear that George was distancing himself as much as humanly possibly from the shitshow he foresaw coming. iirc, D&amp;D didn\u2019t even give him a script to read for what was to come for S8 like they did previous seasons. </p><p>But Brandon! What about his interview with 60 minutes? Where George said he didn\u2019t think it\u2019d be that different? </p><p>To that I say, \u201cwatch it again\u201d. Look at the reluctance on that man\u2019s face as he answers it. There is goddamn pain there, hidden far better than Emilia Clarke\u2019s displeasure at S8 but still readable. Why is there pain? Because he knows that the ending is SO much different. Because what happened in the show does not line up with his ending in the books. Dorne? Fucked in the show? FAegon? His story is split between Cersei and Jon(who does jack shit in S8). White Walkers? The NK was created for a convenient one hit self destruct button. </p><p>Moreover, George didn\u2019t talk about S8 once. He never tweeted after an episode. He didn\u2019t write about it on his blog, instead rather more interested in the NFL draft. The only time he talked about S8 was after the finale and even then it was simply to tell us he was working on Winds of Winter. He didn\u2019t talk about how brilliant he found the season. Just that the ride was over. Yup. </p><p>Finally, it\u2019s also very clear that D&amp;D went their own way. Lena Headey\u2019s confirmation about filming a miscarriage was the final nail in the coffin that confirmed to me that S8 was no way in hell a direction that Martin was intending. David and Dan\u2019s own words confirm this. Saying that they wanted Arya to kill the NK because it was unexpected! This was a decision they came to in 2016. Years after Martin was done advising them. It became very clear to me that David and Dan abused their exclusive TV rights to the show and told the story how THEY wanted it to end. </p><h1>Now, onto why I think Jon and Dany will live.</h1><p>I believe I should first make it known that I do think Dany will die. Yup, I said it. I think she will die, and I think she will be resurrected. Why? Because Dany has been claimed to have been \u201creborn\u201d after emerging from the flames unscathed. Reborn, which implicated that she died and was born again. But she didn\u2019t die. Not at all. Martin has confirmed that it was a once in a lifetime miracle of blood magic involved. However, I don\u2019t believe he\u2019s using her description of rebirth just for smokes and mirrors. He is, correctly, using foreshadowing. </p><p>Dany will die and then be reborn via a red priestess. And why not? She has the entire fucking temple set to back her in the books, like in the show. And you\u2019re telling me that somebody isn\u2019t going to suggest having them revive her? One of her followers, possibly Jon, won\u2019t go to a red priestess and beg for something to be done? And you know what? I think she WAS meant to be reborn. And that\u2019s what pisses me off. Because I believe D&amp;D decided not to and then just teased us with it for a final slap in the face. Sam mentions that Drogon was seen in Volantis and one of the songs for season 8, \u201cPray\u201d, mentions that \u2018We can bring her back, we can bring her back\u2019. </p><p>So, I think she will die and be resurrected, further bringing Jon and Daenerys closer to one another and paralleling their roads as similar once again. </p><p>And after her resurrection, she\u2019ll find Jon living in a house with a red door and a lemon tree. A house that she told  him about when she was previously alive. And for the final cherry on top? It\u2019s in Dorne. Why in Dorne? Because Martin has hinted to us that Braavos does not grow lemon trees and does not hold the climate that Daenerys remembers so fondly. And Dorne also holds significance to Jon. It is the place of his birth and more significant, somewhere warm. </p><p>During season 6, the last season that D&amp;D followed the story logically with some little semblance, Jon tells Edd that he will look for some place to get warm. Yet, he never does. Not once does he ever go to a warm climate area. The closest he ever comes to warmth are Dragonstone, which is already described as being cold during the winter without experiencing snow, and King\u2019s Landing. And the only time he ever experienced the two are during&hellip;*drum roll*&hellip;winter&hellip; the coldest season. Something else that I\u2019m sure D&amp;D changed from the ending. You mean to tell me that Jon Snow has no intention of visiting where it all started? Where he was born? Where his mother died? Fuck off. </p><p>And lastly, they will have a child. Something else that D&amp;D ignored, I believe. Why? Because we already have evidence of them changing shit for their desires. I believe Jon WAS meant to go further south and end up in Dorne(the warmest place in Westeros). They teased in S6 and ignored it when it didn\u2019t suit their story. Something else that didn\u2019t suit their story? A baby. </p><p>At the end of S6, book readers were left wondering what the hell happened to Daenerys\u2019 fertility, seeing as she suffers a miscarriage at the end of ADWD. Then we said, \u201coh, better to leave it here for impact for boatbaby I guess\u201d when they finally fucking talked about it in S7. Except, no! She is barren after all! No suggestions that she ever got pregnant in S8. Screw you D&amp;D. George gave it clear to us that she can get pregnant once more. </p><p>So there. I think the Walker threat will be resolved (and no, I don\u2019t believe that shitty theory that Jon has to come to an agreement with the WW and live as an ambassador for the living. That\u2019s as worse as the \u201cBran is dreaming it all\u201d Theory), Dany will die and be resurrected and Jon and Dany will live together in Dorne in a House with a Red Door that has a lemon tree. And that they will live out their days with their children and grandchildren, away from all the politics and leadership they were forced into.</p>",

Not one bit.</p><p>Why? Why don&rsquo;t I believe this? Am I in denial? George said so, after all. Right?</p><p>No. </p><p>George said that he doesn&rsquo;t THINK it will be different. We&rsquo;ve known for years now that George gave dumb and dumber an outline for them to follow. And we know that he said that they&rsquo;d end up at the same point but take different roads. That was back in 2014/15 when GoT had just passed the source material. And at the time, George had no reason to suspect that they&rsquo;d absolutely fuck his life&rsquo;s work. I mean, George himself acknowledged that the show had made same changes that he wished he would have done. One of the main ones being Arya meeting Tywin at Harrenhal. Practically everyone agrees that it&rsquo;s one of the best changes. So, at the time, George had no reason to worry. And then S7 came out. And it was clear that George was distancing himself as much as humanly possibly from the shitshow he foresaw coming. iirc, D&amp;D didn&rsquo;t even give him a script to read for what was to come for S8 like they did previous seasons. </p><p>But Brandon! What about his interview with 60 minutes? Where George said he didn&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;d be that different? </p><p>To that I say, &ldquo;watch it again&rdquo;. Look at the reluctance on that man&rsquo;s face as he answers it. There is goddamn pain there, hidden far better than Emilia Clarke&rsquo;s displeasure at S8 but still readable. Why is there pain? Because he knows that the ending is SO much different. Because what happened in the show does not line up with his ending in the books. Dorne? Fucked in the show? FAegon? His story is split between Cersei and Jon(who does jack shit in S8). White Walkers? The NK was created for a convenient one hit self destruct button. </p><p>Moreover, George didn&rsquo;t talk about S8 once. He never tweeted after an episode. He didn&rsquo;t write about it on his blog, instead rather more interested in the NFL draft. The only time he talked about S8 was after the finale and even then it was simply to tell us he was working on Winds of Winter. He didn&rsquo;t talk about how brilliant he found the season. Just that the ride was over. Yup. </p><p>Finally, it&rsquo;s also very clear that D&amp;D went their own way. Lena Headey&rsquo;s confirmation about filming a miscarriage was the final nail in the coffin that confirmed to me that S8 was no way in hell a direction that Martin was intending. David and Dan&rsquo;s own words confirm this. Saying that they wanted Arya to kill the NK because it was unexpected! This was a decision they came to in 2016. Years after Martin was done advising them. It became very clear to me that David and Dan abused their exclusive TV rights to the show and told the story how THEY wanted it to end. </p><h1>Now, onto why I think Jon and Dany will live.</h1><p>I believe I should first make it known that I do think Dany will die. Yup, I said it. I think she will die, and I think she will be resurrected. Why? Because Dany has been claimed to have been &ldquo;reborn&rdquo; after emerging from the flames unscathed. Reborn, which implicated that she died and was born again. But she didn&rsquo;t die. Not at all. Martin has confirmed that it was a once in a lifetime miracle of blood magic involved. However, I don&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;s using her description of rebirth just for smokes and mirrors. He is, correctly, using foreshadowing. </p><p>Dany will die and then be reborn via a red priestess. And why not? She has the entire fucking temple set to back her in the books, like in the show. And you&rsquo;re telling me that somebody isn&rsquo;t going to suggest having them revive her? One of her followers, possibly Jon, won&rsquo;t go to a red priestess and beg for something to be done? And you know what? I think she WAS meant to be reborn. And that&rsquo;s what pisses me off. Because I believe D&amp;D decided not to and then just teased us with it for a final slap in the face. Sam mentions that Drogon was seen in Volantis and one of the songs for season 8, &ldquo;Pray&rdquo;, mentions that &lsquo;We can bring her back, we can bring her back&rsquo;. </p><p>So, I think she will die and be resurrected, further bringing Jon and Daenerys closer to one another and paralleling their roads as similar once again. </p><p>And after her resurrection, she&rsquo;ll find Jon living in a house with a red door and a lemon tree. A house that she told  him about when she was previously alive. And for the final cherry on top? It&rsquo;s in Dorne. Why in Dorne? Because Martin has hinted to us that Braavos does not grow lemon trees and does not hold the climate that Daenerys remembers so fondly. And Dorne also holds significance to Jon. It is the place of his birth and more significant, somewhere warm. </p><p>During season 6, the last season that D&amp;D followed the story logically with some little semblance, Jon tells Edd that he will look for some place to get warm. Yet, he never does. Not once does he ever go to a warm climate area. The closest he ever comes to warmth are Dragonstone, which is already described as being cold during the winter without experiencing snow, and King&rsquo;s Landing. And the only time he ever experienced the two are during&hellip;*drum roll*&hellip;winter&hellip; the coldest season. Something else that I&rsquo;m sure D&amp;D changed from the ending. You mean to tell me that Jon Snow has no intention of visiting where it all started? Where he was born? Where his mother died? Fuck off. </p><p>And lastly, they will have a child. Something else that D&amp;D ignored, I believe. Why? Because we already have evidence of them changing shit for their desires. I believe Jon WAS meant to go further south and end up in Dorne(the warmest place in Westeros). They teased in S6 and ignored it when it didn&rsquo;t suit their story. Something else that didn&rsquo;t suit their story? A baby. </p><p>At the end of S6, book readers were left wondering what the hell happened to Daenerys&rsquo; fertility, seeing as she suffers a miscarriage at the end of ADWD. Then we said, &ldquo;oh, better to leave it here for impact for boatbaby I guess&rdquo; when they finally fucking talked about it in S7. Except, no! She is barren after all! No suggestions that she ever got pregnant in S8. Screw you D&amp;D. George gave it clear to us that she can get pregnant once more. </p><p>So there. I think the Walker threat will be resolved (and no, I don&rsquo;t believe that shitty theory that Jon has to come to an agreement with the WW and live as an ambassador for the living. That&rsquo;s as worse as the &ldquo;Bran is dreaming it all&rdquo; Theory), Dany will die and be resurrected and Jon and Dany will live together in Dorne in a House with a Red Door that has a lemon tree. And that they will live out their days with their children and grandchildren, away from all the politics and leadership they were forced into.</p></p>",

And even though he wasn\u2019t very tall, he still looked slightly intimidating with his straight back and his lifted chin. </p><p>This could have been much worse, to be honest. </p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Sansa\u2019s voice sounded a little higher than usually, but she hoped Joffrey wouldn\u2019t notice that. \u201cBut we only met after I\u2019ve already dumped you.\u201d She cocked her head slightly and she let her head rest on the young man\u2019s shoulders. \u201cSo, this is Joffrey, my ex-boyfriend.\u201d She emphasized the ex. \u201cAnd this is\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cJon Snow.\u201d The stranger interrupted her before this entire situation could get humiliating and embarrassing. \u201cQuarterback, but since it\u2019s winter I\u2019m now kickboxing to stay in shape.\u201d His voice was warm and encouragingly he squeezed her hand. </p><p>Reluctantly Joffrey stepped back and he scratched the back of his neck. \u201cO, a quarterback.\u201d He grinned, but the grin missed its usual arrogance. \u201cWow, I never thought you had that in you.\u201d He turned his face towards Sansa again and Sansa felt her cheeks heating up.</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d She shrugged. \u201cStill waters run deep, I guess.\u201d She shifted her weight from one leg to the other and she took another sip from her wine. \u201cJon and I met at a party and he thought I was\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeautiful and brave and intelligent.\u201d Jon smiled and Sansa stared at him for a short moment. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe that a woman like her really fell in love with a guy like me.\u201d He pulled her a little closer towards him and his lips kissed her hair. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely lucky that things between you two didn\u2019t work out. So, I guess I have to thank you?\u201d</p><p>Joffrey furrowed his eyebrows and for the first time ever Sansa saw him speechless. It only lasted a few seconds and then he managed to get himself together again. \u201cThere are prettier fishes in the sea.\u201d He shrugged and turned around and a few seconds later he disappeared in the crowd.</p><p>Sansa finally allowed herself to let out a deep breath. \u201cThank you so much.\u201d She pulled her hand away and tucked a strand of red hair behind her ear. \u201cYou have no idea how much this meant to me.\u201d She shifted her weight again. \u201cSo, what can I get you? I was serious. The rest of the evening all drinks are on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d He reached for her hand again and strangely enough his touch felt comforting and pleasant. \u201cI guess things between you and that Joffrey guy didn\u2019t really end well?\u201d</p><p>Sansa bent her head and stared at her feet. \u201cIt\u2019s my own fault. I really thought he loved me, but\u2026\u201d She swallowed. \u201cI don\u2019t think he even knows what love is. He just wanted to posses me. I was so stupid and everything I remember that I almost\u2026\u201d She hesitated and thought about how close she had been to giving him her body.</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s the one who hurt you, then none of this was your fault, Sansa.\u201d Jon let her hand go again. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have known that he was a dick.\u201d He was the first one to ever say that to her. </p><p>\u201cYou really think so?\u201d She looked up at him and she noticed the frown on his forehead and a certain sadness in his wonderful brown eyes. </p><p>He nodded. \u201cIf someone hurts you it\u2019s their fault and only theirs.\u201d </p><p>She wondered how often he had told himself that story. She wondered who had hurt him and how long and often he had blamed himself for that. \u201cSo, do you prefer a beer? A Bacardi-Coke? Something else?\u201d</p><p>Jon\u2019s lips curled up into a slight smile. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d like something else.\u201d He cocked his head and his lips trembled slightly. \u201cWhat about you don\u2019t getting me that drink now, but taking me out for lunch tomorrow?\u201d </p><p>For a moment Sansa just stared at him and then she shook her head. \u201cIs this you asking me on a date?\u201d She widened her eyes and dropped her jaw.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not ready for it, I get that, but\u2026\u201d He licked his lips. \u201cYou seem like a girl worth getting to know better, so\u2026\u201d</p><p>A smile spread across Sansa\u2019s face and her heart skipped a beat in her chest. \u201cLunch tomorrow sounds perfect.\u201d</p><p>Jon smiled back. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you at one at the Smoking Log then.\u201d</p>",

Lady, for the short time that we knew her, was quiet and gentle like early Sansa. Summer is Bran in most aspects, as he gains Bran\u2019s intelligence whenever he is warged. Summer notably tries to climb a tree, despite being a wolf, because he is Bran\u2019s. Nymeria is just like Arya too, being adventurous, and violent. Very violent, Arya and Nymeria have a sort of positive feedback loop in their violence, for the Night Wolf, their combined personality, is a mankiller leading hundreds of wolves, killing Lannisters like a champion. That too is similar to Rickon and Shaggydog, Rickon is repeatedly described as being\u00a0\u2018wild\u2019, and Shaggydog repeatedly savages and bites humans. Ghost is silent like broody Jon, but seems to be a good deal smarter than his human. It\u2019s helpful to remember that, in the books, every single Stark kid is a warg. Robb and Grey Wind fight\u00a0\u2018like one\u2019, Sansa unfortunately never gets the opportunity to warg Lady, Bran is the most obvious example, Arya wargs Nymeria every night, as well as stray Braavosi cats, and we never see Rickon\u2019s perspective, but he too is very close to his wolf. Jon wargs Ghost in his sleep, and Varamyr Sixskins confirms that he is a powerful warg.</p><p>All of that is mostly surface-level, however. It\u2019s pretty obvious that the Starks warg their wolves and have similar personalities, but what I like about the wolves is how they represent life and Stark identity. Also, the placement of the direwolves when they are first found is important. If you were to compare it to a family tree, you have the mother direwolf, lying dead on the ground, the five underneath her, and then Ghost, a white direwolf (white like Targaryen hair?) is off to the side, like a cousin would be. Jon is a cousin to the Stark kids.</p><p>The deaths of the direwolves hold meaning too. Sansa is a Stark, but she is the least Stark of all the kids. Sansa looks like a Tully, is south for the entire story, and her direwolf dies very early on. The death of Lady can be interpreted as the death of Sansa\u2019s Stark identity or status, distancing her from the other children. Similairly, Arya sends away Nymeria, she sends away a crucial part of her person, which ties into her themes of the loss of identity, while putting the notion that, it is not dead, only sent away. Arya is never truly able to give up being Arya Stark, because Nymeria is not dead and gone, only away temporarily. Arya loses her identity but she will likely regain it in the next two books. Robb never loses his Stark status in this way, instead he dies with his wolf, he dies a Stark. RIckon is currently absent in the books, but it is likely he will die in that same way, with his wolf, Rickon will likely die a Stark. Summer is not yet dead, but it is likely that, in the effort to truly become the three-eyed crow, he will die like in the show, and Bran will cease to be a Stark, and start being a crow.\u00a0</p><p>I find that Nymeria is the most interesting of all the wolves, as she can kind of be seen as a split piece of Arya. When Arya is the Night Wolf, that is the only time she feels whole, when with Nymeria. She fishes the dead body of her mother out of a river, she has a real pack, she has power when she is Nymeria. Arya is repeatedly described to have a\u00a0\u2018hole where her heart used to be\u2019, a missing piece of her soul and identity, which is Nymeria. Arya will never be whole until she is back with Nymeria, back with her Stark identity, back with her family.\u00a0</p><p>Ghost is the other wolf we know the most about, and mostly I interpret wolf as a bit of a clue to Jon\u2019s Targaryen identity, as he is white like the silver hair of the Targs. Ghost is also a very smart direwolf, smarter than Jon I would say, and he is able to scout, find the dead wights in the forest, and generally be the best boy in the universe who deserves pets.</p>",
