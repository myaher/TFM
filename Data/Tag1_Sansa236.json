But Jon is determined to show that he&rsquo;s not like the men who scarred and hurt her at all.</small></p><p><i><small>post-canon // Canon Divergence, mentions of rape and implied smut</small></i></p></blockquote><p>It was a strange sight. It was a sight more painful than anything Jon had ever seen. It was a sight that didn\u2019t fit, didn\u2019t feel right, didn\u2019t seem right.</p><p>The beautiful young queen he had married sat on the edge of her bed with her dress still on and her arms nervously wrapped around her. She didn\u2019t look like a queen anymore. She didn\u2019t look like the fierce and proud woman she had become anymore. She looked like a young girl, afraid and terrified of what was to come. </p><p>\u201cSansa?\u201d He kneeled down in front of her. He was barely wearing anything anymore and he had untied his dark black curls. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d He already knew the answer, but he wanted to ask her anyway. He didn\u2019t want her to think that she looked broken and damaged, that she looked like a scarred girl, wounded in places no one got to see.</p><p>She tried to lift her chin and straighten her back, but she was trembling and shaking, her hands holding onto the white sheets covering the bed. \u201cI&rsquo;m fine.\u201d</p><p>Jon rolled his eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to lie to me, Sansa.\u201d He shook his head and reached for her hands. Her fingers were ice and ice cold and he tried to warm them between his palms. \u201cI hope you know that I always wanna hear the truth from you.\u201d</p><p>Sansa took a deep breath. The smile that had brightened her face all day faltered and disappeared. Her eyes stared at him, wide open and almost child like. It was easy to forget that she was still just a young girl, forced to live in a world that was harsh and didn\u2019t care about innocence and purity.</p><p>\u201cTalk to me.\u201d Jon whispered and he let one of his hands touch her face. The tips of his fingers caressed her cheek, slowly moving down until he let his palm rest in her neck. \u201cTalk to me, please.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>She pulled her hands back and turned her face away from him. Her glance moved to the window and the dark night surrounding the castle of Winterfell. \u201cI don\u2019t know how.\u201d She bent her head. She looked lost, lost in the memories that haunted her and scared her. \u201cI don\u2019t want to disappoint you.\u201d She bit her lip and Jon fought the urge to wrap his arms around her, to press her to his chest, to tell her stories about brave knights fighting fierce dragons, like Robb used to do when Sansa had been little and afraid of the dark. But stories wouldn\u2019t help her right now. Reality had caught up with the fairytales she had believed and reality had left scars on her heart and soul.</p><p>\u201cSansa\u2026\u201d Jon swallowed. If her demons had been humans he could kill with his swords, he would have fought for her. If her nightmares could be beaten in a hand to hand combat, he would have hit the beasts until his knuckles would bleed. But there were fights he couldn\u2019t fight for her, no matter how desperately he wanted to. \u201cYou&rsquo;ll never disappoint me. Just talk to me.\u201d He carefully reached for her chin and moved her face so their eyes could meet. \u201cWe can talk all night.\u201d</p><p>Sansa\u2019s entire body tensed and a salted tear rolled down her cheek. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry\u2026\u201d She could barely whisper, but Jon heard each and every word loud and clear anyway. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry he took what was yours and\u2026\u201d</p><p>Jon shook his head and his lips kissed the single tear away. \u201cDon\u2019t be sorry for me.\u201d He kissed her other cheek, the tip of her nose. \u201cTalk to me about you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d Sansa turned her glance away from him again. \u201cThe right words don\u2019t exist.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cI want you to know that\u2026\u201d She looked back at him and some of her fierceness returned to her glance. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to just do it.\u201d </p><p>Jon furrowed his eyebrows and then he curled his arms around her head and pressed her to his chest. \u201cIt&rsquo;s not okay to just do it, Sansa.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThis marriage will be worthless if you don\u2019t. You need to do it.\u201d She moved her head up so her lips touched his neck. \u201cThe people need to know you\u2019re a true Stark now.\u201d</p><p>Jon\u2019s hands went through her hair and he kept silent for a long moment. \u201cNo\u2026\u201d He wanted to speak firmly, but the word was stuck in his throat and came out less strong than he had intended. \u201cNothing is more important to me than you. If you\u2019re not ready for it, I\u2019ll wait. However long I have to. We can tell everyone it happened. But I won\u2019t just do it. Not when you\u2019re like this.\u201d</p><p>Sansa buried her face in his neck and after a while she relaxed a little in his arms. The tension in her shoulders eased. Her breathing steadied and she wrapped her arms around him like she had done so many times before. \u201cI&rsquo;ll never be ready for it.\u201d She pulled back and closed her eyes. \u201cAnd Winterfell does need an heir eventually.\u201d She sighed. \u201cSo I want you to just do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d This time Jon\u2019s voice was firm and certain. \u201cI won\u2019t just do it.\u201d He cupped her face between his strong hands and stared at her.</p><p>Despite the scars on her soul, despite her pride being gone, despite the pain and fear in her eyes, she was still beautiful. Even broken and hurt she was still beautiful. She would always be beautiful.</p><p>\u201cI will show you how it can be. Pleasant and nice, a whispered secret between two lovers.\u201d He moved closer towards her and his lips brushed hers. \u201cWe\u2019ll take it slowly. Step by step.\u201d</p><p>Sansa smiled a weak smile at him and she took a deep breath before she pulled her nightgown over her head. \u201cI trust you, Jon Snow.\u201d She shove backwards until she could lay her head down on her soft feathered pillow. \u201cI love you, Jon Snow.\u201d</p><p>He smiled back at her and crawled on the bed too. His lips searched for her neck. \u201cI love you more, Sansa Stark.\u201d He left a trace of soft kisses down her collarbone, her breast and her belly. </p><p>Sansa buried her hand in his hair. \u201cI love you most, Jon Snow.\u201d She spread her legs a little, but Jon was determined to stay true to his promise. </p><p>He wouldn\u2019t just do it. He would take his time, until even her scarred heart would dare to believe he would never ever hurt her. Until even her broken and damaged soul would dare to believe he loved her more than most.</p>",

But Jon is determined to show that he\u2019s not like the men who scarred and hurt her at all.</small></p><p><i><small>post-canon // Canon Divergence, mentions of rape and implied smut</small></i></p></blockquote><p>It was a strange sight. It was a sight more painful than anything Jon had ever seen. It was a sight that didn\u2019t fit, didn\u2019t feel right, didn\u2019t seem right.</p><p>The beautiful young queen he had married sat on the edge of her bed with her dress still on and her arms nervously wrapped around her. She didn\u2019t look like a queen anymore. She didn\u2019t look like the fierce and proud woman she had become anymore. She looked like a young girl, afraid and terrified of what was to come. </p><p>\u201cSansa?\u201d He kneeled down in front of her. He was barely wearing anything anymore and he had untied his dark black curls. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d He already knew the answer, but he wanted to ask her anyway. He didn\u2019t want her to think that she looked broken and damaged, that she looked like a scarred girl, wounded in places no one got to see.</p><p>She tried to lift her chin and straighten her back, but she was trembling and shaking, her hands holding onto the white sheets covering the bed. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>Jon rolled his eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to lie to me, Sansa.\u201d He shook his head and reached for her hands. Her fingers were ice and ice cold and he tried to warm them between his palms. \u201cI hope you know that I always wanna hear the truth from you.\u201d</p><p>Sansa took a deep breath. The smile that had brightened her face all day faltered and disappeared. Her eyes stared at him, wide open and almost child like. It was easy to forget that she was still just a young girl, forced to live in a world that was harsh and didn\u2019t care about innocence and purity.</p><p>\u201cTalk to me.\u201d Jon whispered and he let one of his hands touch her face. The tips of his fingers caressed her cheek, slowly moving down until he let his palm rest in her neck. \u201cTalk to me, please.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>She pulled her hands back and turned her face away from him. Her glance moved to the window and the dark night surrounding the castle of Winterfell. \u201cI don\u2019t know how.\u201d She bent her head. She looked lost, lost in the memories that haunted her and scared her. \u201cI don\u2019t want to disappoint you.\u201d She bit her lip and Jon fought the urge to wrap his arms around her, to press her to his chest, to tell her stories about brave knights fighting fierce dragons, like Robb used to do when Sansa had been little and afraid of the dark. But stories wouldn\u2019t help her right now. Reality had caught up with the fairytales she had believed and reality had left scars on her heart and soul.</p><p>\u201cSansa\u2026\u201d Jon swallowed. If her demons had been humans he could kill with his swords, he would have fought for her. If her nightmares could be beaten in a hand to hand combat, he would have hit the beasts until his knuckles would bleed. But there were fights he couldn\u2019t fight for her, no matter how desperately he wanted to. \u201cYou\u2019ll never disappoint me. Just talk to me.\u201d He carefully reached for her chin and moved her face so their eyes could meet. \u201cWe can talk all night.\u201d</p><p>Sansa\u2019s entire body tensed and a salted tear rolled down her cheek. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry\u2026\u201d She could barely whisper, but Jon heard each and every word loud and clear anyway. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry he took what was yours and\u2026\u201d</p><p>Jon shook his head and his lips kissed the single tear away. \u201cDon\u2019t be sorry for me.\u201d He kissed her other cheek, the tip of her nose. \u201cTalk to me about you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d Sansa turned her glance away from him again. \u201cThe right words don\u2019t exist.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cI want you to know that\u2026\u201d She looked back at him and some of her fierceness returned to her glance. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to just do it.\u201d </p><p>Jon furrowed his eyebrows and then he curled his arms around her head and pressed her to his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s not okay to just do it, Sansa.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThis marriage will be worthless if you don\u2019t. You need to do it.\u201d She moved her head up so her lips touched his neck. \u201cThe people need to know you\u2019re a true Stark now.\u201d</p><p>Jon\u2019s hands went through her hair and he kept silent for a long moment. \u201cNo\u2026\u201d He wanted to speak firmly, but the word was stuck in his throat and came out less strong than he had intended. \u201cNothing is more important to me than you. If you\u2019re not ready for it, I\u2019ll wait. However long I have to. We can tell everyone it happened. But I won\u2019t just do it. Not when you\u2019re like this.\u201d</p><p>Sansa buried her face in his neck and after a while she relaxed a little in his arms. The tension in her shoulders eased. Her breathing steadied and she wrapped her arms around him like she had done so many times before. \u201cI\u2019ll never be ready for it.\u201d She pulled back and closed her eyes. \u201cAnd Winterfell does need an heir eventually.\u201d She sighed. \u201cSo I want you to just do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d This time Jon\u2019s voice was firm and certain. \u201cI won\u2019t just do it.\u201d He cupped her face between his strong hands and stared at her.</p><p>Despite the scars on her soul, despite her pride being gone, despite the pain and fear in her eyes, she was still beautiful. Even broken and hurt she was still beautiful. She would always be beautiful.</p><p>\u201cI will show you how it can be. Pleasant and nice, a whispered secret between two lovers.\u201d He moved closer towards her and his lips brushed hers. \u201cWe\u2019ll take it slowly. Step by step.\u201d</p><p>Sansa smiled a weak smile at him and she took a deep breath before she pulled her nightgown over her head. \u201cI trust you, Jon Snow.\u201d She shove backwards until she could lay her head down on her soft feathered pillow. \u201cI love you, Jon Snow.\u201d</p><p>He smiled back at her and crawled on the bed too. His lips searched for her neck. \u201cI love you more, Sansa Stark.\u201d He left a trace of soft kisses down her collarbone, her breast and her belly. </p><p>Sansa buried her hand in his hair. \u201cI love you most, Jon Snow.\u201d She spread her legs a little, but Jon was determined to stay true to his promise. </p><p>He wouldn\u2019t just do it. He would take his time, until even her scarred heart would dare to believe he would never ever hurt her. Until even her broken and damaged soul would dare to believe he loved her more than most.</p></p>",

I&rsquo;m excited to read the stories of Jaehaerys and Alysanne. Will be interesting to see what other connections we can see between past characters and current characters. I do think there are some parallels between Alysanne and Sansa. Would J and A foreshadow Jonsa&hellip; Sadly Im not too sure on the idea, but that is my opinion of course.
