The Dance of the Dragons took place in 129 AC to 131 AC and therefore about 170 years before the events in the series. \u00a0The Targaryens lost many dragons in the conflict, and the animals soon went extinct from the world until Daenerys Targaryen hatched three eggs.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3733\" data-orig-height=\"2100\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/276200f1c7313dd757e8ff2548aa67fa/tumblr_inline_pnfuuhIXTn1wx65bx_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3733\" data-orig-height=\"2100\"/></figure><p>The first Dance of the Dragons happened when various nobles sided with one or the other of the rival branches of House Targaryen after the death of Viserys I. In the TV series, Daenerys Targaryen has advanced to Westeros and is in a conquest for the Iron Throne when she meets Jon Snow (now King in the North) and is persuaded that that it is in Westeros\u2019s best interests to seek a truce with Cersei in order to deal with the Army of the Dead to the North of The Wall. \u00a0Dany takes her dragons North in order to rescue Jon and others who are attempting to capture a wight to bring to Cersei. \u00a0There, one of her dragons, Viserion is killed by the Night King and transformed into a wight dragon.</p><p>Central to the plot, is the relationship of Jon Snow to Daenerys Targaryen. \u00a0The two become lovers before discovering that they are <i>both</i> Targaryens, and that the line of succession would place Jon (AKA Aegon Targaryen) ahead of Dany as a claimant to the Iron Throne. Genetically, the two are aunt and nephew, because Jon\u2019s biological father is Rhaegar, the older brother of Dany.</p><p>The romantic relationship of Jon and Dany was long anticipated by many viewers, and many consider it to the end game that the two will eventually rule together in spite of their incestuous union. \u00a0This is because the Targaryens were long known to marry blood relatives, including siblings, in order to preserve the purity of their bloodlines. \u00a0On the other hand, most inhabitants of Westerosi society do not look kindly on incestuous relationships, as is evidenced by Jaimie and Cersei Lannister having to keep their sexual relationship secret. \u00a0This union is an explosive issue on <i>Game of Thrones</i>, because their three deceased children (including two kings) were the products of incest.\u00a0</p><p>The catalyst for a second Dance of Dragons is quite straightforward: Dany and Jon learn about his true origins, and their alliance falls apart. \u00a0This most likely would not happen because Jon will try to take the throne for himself, but because events will unfold which will make him appear preferable to her as a leader to many key players.

Dany may react rashly to criticism and anger over her decision by those who are at Winterfell. \u00a0This may plant the seeds of dissent or even cause events to spiral out of control as Dany is branded as a sadistic usurper or an insane ruler like her father,\u00a0\u201cThe Mad King.\u201d</p><p>Further conflicts may be in the offing as Gendry, an ally of Jon\u2019s and friend of Arya Stark, is revealed to all as the bastard son of Robert Baratheon.

Genetically, the two are aunt and nephew, because Jon&rsquo;s biological father is Rhaegar, the older brother of Dany.</p><p>The romantic relationship of Jon and Dany was long anticipated by many viewers, and many consider it to the end game that the two will eventually rule together in spite of their incestuous union. &nbsp;This is because the Targaryens were long known to marry blood relatives, including siblings, in order to preserve the purity of their bloodlines. &nbsp;On the other hand, most inhabitants of Westerosi society do not look kindly on incestuous relationships, as is evidenced by Jaimie and Cersei Lannister having to keep their sexual relationship secret. &nbsp;This union is an explosive issue on <i>Game of Thrones</i>, because their three deceased children (including two kings) were the products of incest.&nbsp;</p><p>The catalyst for a second Dance of Dragons is quite straightforward: Dany and Jon learn about his true origins, and their alliance falls apart. &nbsp;This most likely would not happen because Jon will try to take the throne for himself, but because events will unfold which will make him appear preferable to her as a leader to many key players. Thus, Jon will again have leadership thrust upon him by others, rather than pursuing it for himself. &nbsp;This has been a key theme in his character arc.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bbd61b673e56aae25f9abf47eaa6e365/tumblr_inline_png0q6YS7s1wx65bx_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>The series has already foreshadowed that Tyrion and Varys have misgivings about Dany since she attacked the Lannisters and executed the Tarleys for refusing to bend the knee. &nbsp;Varys and Tyrion have a conversation about this in the Throne Room at Dragonstone. &nbsp;The Tarleys were the father and brother of Samwell Tarley, who is Jon Snow&rsquo;s best friend. &nbsp;Neither Samwell nor Jon have yet learned of their deaths, which is probably set to be a dramatic reveal in the first episode of season 8. Dany may react rashly to criticism and anger over her decision by those who are at Winterfell. &nbsp;This may plant the seeds of dissent or even cause events to spiral out of control as Dany is branded as a sadistic usurper or an insane ruler like her father,&nbsp;&ldquo;The Mad King.&rdquo;</p><p>Further conflicts may be in the offing as Gendry, an ally of Jon&rsquo;s and friend of Arya Stark, is revealed to all as the bastard son of Robert Baratheon. Although Gendry did not appear at the Dragon Pit meeting, one can only assume that he is traveling North with the others and headed to Winterfell. Dany will not like that another potential claimant is alive and allied with the Starks. Jaimie Lannister is also headed North. &nbsp;He is the brother of Cersei and Tyrion and tried to kill Dany during the Loot Train attack. Dany&rsquo;s misgivings about either of these characters are quite understandable, but in the context of her arrival at the hostile environment of Winterfell their presence could contribute to putting her over the edge.</p><p>So a possible scenario is for&nbsp;Daenery&rsquo;s reputation to be damaged right off the bat. &nbsp;This, combined with the revelation of Jon&rsquo;s true bloodline, may break her alliance with him and also cause key players to support Jon.</p>",
