But before he can face death, there are a few things he has to confess. And they&rsquo;re all about Sansa.</small></p><p><i><small>Canon Divergence / Canon Compliant</small></i></p></blockquote><p>He felt it. He didn\u2019t know how and he didn\u2019t know why, but he felt it. He felt it in his bones. He felt it in his soul. He felt it in his heart.<br/></p><p>They were coming.</p><p>The army of the death was coming.</p><p>They could be here tomorrow. They could be here in a few days or a week. But they were coming and there was no one to stop them.</p><p>No one but them.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time.\u201d Jon took a deep breath and stood up from his seat. He straightened his back and lifted his chin. He still wasn\u2019t used to being king, but he had watched Ned and hoped that looking as much like him as possible would be enough. \u201cThe white walkers are marching upon us and we are all that stands between them and Westeros.\u201d He spoke slowly. \u201cRight now it\u2019s not about who will end up on the iron throne. It\u2019s simply about who will survive.\u201d </p><p>There was nothing but absolute silence, but when he looked at Sansa, sitting firmly on his right, she nodded. </p><p>\u201cTonight love your husbands, love your wives and kiss your children goodnight. Tomorrow we\u2019ll show the death what we\u2019re made of.\u201d </p><p>The crowd in front of him started cheering and Jon felt the adrenaline rushing through his veins. Maybe he wasn\u2019t used to being a king, but he was used to fight and to command an army. He could do this. He would do this.</p><p>\u201cWinter is coming, but the North will endure!\u201d Jon raised his voice. \u201cFor Winterfell!\u201d He let his glance wander over all the people who had pledged their loyalty to him while they left the great hall to enjoy their possible last day on earth. </p><!-- more --><p>And only when there was nothing but utter silence and he and Sansa were the only ones left he fell down in his seat and allowed the weight of the upcoming war to crush him. </p><p>\u201cJon\u2026\u201d Sansa placed a hand on his. Her touch was gentle and light and her voice was soothing. \u201cYou should take your own advice and spend time with the people you love tonight, saying goodbye.\u201d She almost choked on the last word and Jon\u2019s hand went through his dark black curls. </p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He\u2019d have to say goodbye to Sam, to Bran, to Arya. He\u2019d have to say goodbye to Sansa. He\u2019d have to say much more to Sansa. It could be his very last chance. Maybe he would die tomorrow, or next week, or somewhere in between.

He straightened his back and lifted his chin. He still wasn&rsquo;t used to being king, but he had watched Ned and hoped that looking as much like him as possible would be enough. &ldquo;The white walkers are marching upon us and we are all that stands between them and Westeros.&rdquo; He spoke slowly. &ldquo;Right now it&rsquo;s not about who will end up on the iron throne. It&rsquo;s simply about who will survive.&rdquo; </p><p>There was nothing but absolute silence, but when he looked at Sansa, sitting firmly on his right, she nodded. </p><p>&ldquo;Tonight love your husbands, love your wives and kiss your children goodnight. Tomorrow we&rsquo;ll show the death what we&rsquo;re made of.&rdquo; </p><p>The crowd in front of him started cheering and Jon felt the adrenaline rushing through his veins. Maybe he wasn&rsquo;t used to being a king, but he was used to fight and to command an army. He could do this. He would do this.</p><p>&ldquo;Winter is coming, but the North will endure!&rdquo; Jon raised his voice. &ldquo;For Winterfell!&rdquo; He let his glance wander over all the people who had pledged their loyalty to him while they left the great hall to enjoy their possible last day on earth. </p><p>And only when there was nothing but utter silence and he and Sansa were the only ones left he fell down in his seat and allowed the weight of the upcoming war to crush him. </p><p>&ldquo;Jon&hellip;&rdquo; Sansa placed a hand on his. Her touch was gentle and light and her voice was soothing. &ldquo;You should take your own advice and spend time with the people you love tonight, saying goodbye.&rdquo; She almost choked on the last word and Jon&rsquo;s hand went through his dark black curls. </p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; He&rsquo;d have to say goodbye to Sam, to Bran, to Arya. He&rsquo;d have to say goodbye to Sansa. He&rsquo;d have to say much more to Sansa. It could be his very last chance. Maybe he would die tomorrow, or next week, or somewhere in between. Maybe he could never tell her anymore.</p><p>But he didn&rsquo;t know where to start. He had never been much of a talker, not when it came to his wishes, longings and feelings. He had never been much of a talker when it came to love.</p><p>But he wasn&rsquo;t the only one who didn&rsquo;t move. </p><p>&ldquo;Jon?&rdquo; Sansa was the first to break the silence. &ldquo;I know that I wasn&rsquo;t always nice to you when we were kids.&rdquo; Her lips curled up into a sad smile. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re an amazing king. Father, Robb&hellip;&rdquo; She hesitated for a moment. &ldquo;They would be really proud of you and how far you&rsquo;ve come.&rdquo;</p><p>He glanced at the girl next to him, speaking as if they were not children simply pretending to be kings and queens. &ldquo;It will all be pointless if we lose.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, it won&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Sansa firmly shook her head and she tightened her grip on his hand, which she was still holding. &ldquo;The last years have been hard, yes, but there have been nice moments too.&rdquo; Her smile brightened. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m glad I was here to see you become the amazing leader you are now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t have done it without you, Sansa.&rdquo; </p><p>Without her he would have been dead. He wouldn&rsquo;t have had the courage to march on Winterfell. He would have lost the battle against Ramsay. He wouldn&rsquo;t have won the trust of the North. He wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to tell everyone about the true war that was coming. </p><p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t have to.&rdquo; He added and swallowed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve always been beautiful, but I hope that by now you know that you&rsquo;re so much more than that. You&rsquo;re smart. You&rsquo;re brave. You&rsquo;re strong.&rdquo; He treaded on dangerous ground, but he realised he had not much to lose. &ldquo;And if there had been more time, I would have asked you if there was maybe a part of you that could love me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;O, Jon&hellip;&rdquo; Sansa let out a deep sigh and then she pressed the palms of her hands to his cheeks. &ldquo;There is not a part of me that doesn&rsquo;t love you.&rdquo; She locked her glance with his and then she leaned in to kiss him. </p><p>At first her kiss was soft and tender, but then he wrapped his arms around her and parted his lips. </p><p>They forgot where they were. They forgot who they were. They forgot the time.</p><p>And minutes, or hours, later, when they were both out of breath and their lips were red and swollen they pulled back and realised that every second that passed was one more second closer to what could be the end.</p><p>&ldquo;Let me go with you.&rdquo; Sansa bit her lip. &ldquo;I know I can&rsquo;t fight as well as you or Arya. But I can&rsquo;t stand the thought of staying behind, not knowing who will come knocking on my door. You or the army of the death.&rdquo; She kissed him again. &ldquo;And if these are our last days on earth, I want to spend them with you.&rdquo;</p><p>And despite the war that was coming, despite death waiting for them around the corner, despite the lack of promises if there would ever be a tomorrow, Jon felt himself smiling. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t leave your side until the last bit of air leaves my body.

I figured that if I am going to be sitting here doing nothing I might as well be doing something slightly productive. From here on I am going to try and write my thoughts on the show(s) I am currently watching. So !!SPOILER!! Hope you enjoy my mindless rambling and keep reading.",

        "question": "I think if people really understood the concept of \"the villain is the hero of the other side\" then they would have a much clearer grasp on what's going on.  Even though D&D are clearly not GRMM it's clear to me they are setting this up too.  A key pt to this storytelling is POVs.  Making both sides at some point rootable.  Dany has been questionable since s1 but there always is some kind of justification behind her actions.  Even when coming to Westeros and her actions became harder to (tbc)",
        "answer": "<blockquote><p>\n\njustify they used a \u201cvillain,\u201d Tarly. She was still excused and still rootable. No matter her further actions, matter what she does or who she does them to she will always have supporters in her stans and the GA. Hers is a villain origin story but in GRRMS sense of the word. We\u2019ve gotten to see her whole story and her motivations. Same with Jon. This is not a WW story. That will not be the final battle. That is a clear hero vs villain battle. Nobody is rooting for the NK. (Tbc)\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\n\nThis is between Dany and Jon. DotD. Between the kind of power they think is good for the Kingdom. Where both sides will have supporters. Obv she will get to a pt where she looks like what we typically view as the villain and people will root for Jon based on that. But she will have people who see her side and see why she does what she does. Jon betraying her probably contributes in someway. I\u2019m sure he will lose a few fans for his methods. Dany will be a hero to some. Thoughts? Thx!\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>Hey, nonnie!</p><blockquote><p>GRRM:\u00a0\n\nI have always been fascinated with the villain is the hero of the other side.The great fight in the Illiad between Achilles and Hector is in some ways my model more so than fights between a hero and villain traditionally are. What constitutes a hero?Is a hero always a hero?\n\n</p></blockquote><p>(<a href=\"https://www.thesomervilletimes.com/archives/17207\">source</a>)</p><p>This is, in essence, what I think. GRRM is not interested in telling a traditional hero vs. villain type story, as per his own admission. And that\u2019s exactly what a Jon/D*ny vs. Night King endgame is. The NK, even by traditional villain standards, is bland. He\u2019s not really even a character, he\u2019s a tool of destruction.</p><p>He\u2019s also already given us the precursor to his ultimate Hector vs. Achilles battle, during the first Dance of Dragons, with the fight between\u00a0\n\nPrince Daemon and\u00a0\n\nPrince Aemond. Neither one of those two men were heroes or villains. They had both done reprehensible things and they were both fighting not for the destruction of the human race but because of their own motives and ambitions. And that\u2019s far more fascinating than a fight between the good people and the zombies.\u00a0</p><p>Also, I\u2019d argue that the Ds are interested in telling the same kind of story. Not least because David Benioff wrote this:\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DtAtbzV8CTV0\"><iframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tAtbzV8CTV0?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></figure><p>He actually wrote Hector fighting against Achilles. Whatever\nqualms you might have about the way Troy (2004) goes about retelling the story\nof the Iliad, one thing is patently clear: neither Hector nor Achilles are\nbrutes. Neither one is evil, or a monster.\u00a0</p><p>And when they end up fighting\noutside the gates of Troy, they both have deeply personal and empathetic\nreasons to be there: Hector has his honor and his love for his home and people.\nAchilles has his overwhelming rage at the death of his cousin and his ultimate\ndestiny as the greatest warrior that ever lived.\u00a0</p><p>Aside from the brilliant\nfighting choreography, what makes this fight compelling, interesting and deeply\ntragic, are the characters and the seemingly impossible choice you, as a\nviewer, have in picking between the two of them. Because you can\u2019t help but\nlook at how they ended up there and think that if things had been just slightly\ndifferent, they wouldn\u2019t be trying to kill each other. They might have been\nfriends, comrades and considering Achilles relationship with Briseis, even\nfamily.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>So I\u2019d say David Benioff, and\nby extension David Weiss as well, know a thing or two about how to\nwrite\u00a0\u201cthe human heart in conflict with itself\u201d. And ultimately that\u2019s\nthat a Dance of Dragons between Jon Snow and Daenerys Targareyen is.\u00a0</p><p>On the one hand, you have Jon\nSnow, bastard of Winterfell, the shield that guards the realms of men, the man\ncommitted to his home and his family fighting to protect the people he loves\nand ensure the independence of his country.\u00a0</p><p>On the other hand you have\nDaenerys Targareyen, the exiled princess who endured abuse, rape, starvation\nand humiliation only to rise up as the Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains,\nthe most powerful, almost God-like figure in the world, fighting for the resurrection\nof her House, for her glory and ambition and for her own deep seethed desire to\nfind home.\u00a0</p><p>Neither one of these two\ncharacters will come out looking white as snow (no pun intended).\u00a0</p><p>Jon would have betrayed D*ny,\nin a sense, by going against the last member of his father\u2019s family and, if\nthings go the way I suspect, also by having stolen one of her dragons, a\ncreature she regards as her child. Not to mention that by the end of this\nstory, he might end up a kinslayer, a heavy price to pay in this universe. He\nwould have also gone back on his word to support her claim to the throne and\nfight her wars. His reasons for fighting her are valid but his actions will,\nmost definitely, be less than honorable.\u00a0</p><p>For her part, D*ny will allow\nher violent impulses to lead to more and more destruction.
