The prompts have been provided and the stories have all been written and I gotta say you&rsquo;re in for a lot of Jonerys content. So Day 7, the last day, 20th February, which is when I&rsquo;m uploading this, the prompt I chose was 'Free Choice&rsquo;. So I got thinking and decided to expand on my glorious reign series and give you the birth of their first child, Lyanna.</p><p>Link:\u00a0<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17864576\">https://archiveofourown.org/works/17864576</a></p><p>&mdash;-</p><p>Jon was going crazy.</p><p>Waiting for the arrival of his and Dany\u2019s child had left him drinking with Tyrion in the hands quarter as a promise to Dany that he\u2019d stay away while she laboured their baby. All of the dogs in King\u2019s Landing were howling, due to the storm that had captured the city and by extension scared the inhabitants into staying inside. Lighting and rain, flashing and fierce. There had been four storms since he and Dany assumed the throne five years ago, but this had by far been the worse. Ironic that their child would also be known as Stormborn like it\u2019s mother, but that also left deep rooted fear within Jon himself.</p><!-- more --><p>He wondered if she would survive, after all both of their mother\u2019s had perished when giving birth to them, although Sam was dealing with her, the only person he trusted. But there was still this nagging feeling of fear within him that meant he was on edge and pacing the hands chambers all the while it was going on. He could stand on the Balcony and see their chambers from it, but he wouldn\u2019t know what was happening.</p><p>They\u2019d lost a babe already, after the first time they\u2019d made love on the boat from dragonstone to White Harbour, Dany\u2019s bleeding had not arrived. They didn\u2019t count their chickens before they hatched, both of them knowing what happened to her last babe, but when her belly had began to swell with life they were joyous. Jon requested they not tell anyone, as only Missandei, Sam and themselves knew at that moment. But about ten weeks after the conception, Dany bled hard and the babe was lost.</p><p>She\u2019d cried for weeks in private with him, they\u2019d shared his chambers and it had been heart-wrenching to see her suffer. She put on a smile for the lords of Winterfell, and when they\u2019d caught her crying she\u2019d always played it off as the lose of her Dragon, which in a sense was also her child. So when her belly had become swollen once again six months ago, they\u2019d been very joyous yet extremely cautious. Jon had not let her do anything, she was to relax for the first few months, must to her annoyance.</p><p>And now, she was in labour, a month early.</p><p>To make matters worse, Lord Baratheon and Lady Stark (Jon\u2019s sister) had sprung upon them a surprise visit, which meant they too were in the hands chambers, drinking with him as the entertainment Tyrion had quickly thrown together for the visiting family got cut short. Daenerys was in the middle of giving a speech when she\u2019d gushed on the floor and began to feel light headed.</p><p>She was early, and this was all the more reason Jon was worried. The chances of both of them surviving was very small, but he\u2019d hoped that she had, they both had. If she was to go\u2026 Jon couldn\u2019t even bare to think about it, he loved her so hopelessly that the even consideration that Daenerys Targaryen, his wife, his queen, would never see him again, would never look at him with those eyes, was completely consuming him</p><p>\u201cStop pacing, you idiot\u201d Arya grumbled, fiddling with a knife, twisting it between her fingers. The Valyrian blade that Bran had bestowed upon her all those years ago, before he\u2019s met his end\u2026 Jon shook his head and did as he was told. He may be the king, but when Ayra said to do something, he listened without question.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s natural to be fearful, Your Grace\u201d Tyrion countered, pouring red wine into his goblet and almost downing it instantly. \u201cBut I can assure you she\u2019s in very good hands\u201d</p><p>Jon knew she was, Sam had delivered several babies now including that of his sister, Sansa\u2019s two children with her husband up in the north. He may be Lord of Horn Hill, but he also was their maester, and Jon trusted him more than anyone else besides Daenerys.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps we can do something to take your mind off of everything, Your Grace?\u201d Gendry offered. Nothing would take Jon\u2019s mind off of it, he knew as such, but he took the bate and sat down at the table with the other three. \u201cAre there any pressing issues that need resolving in the city?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been dealing with a speight of theft in flea bottom\u201d Jon shrugs, reminding himself that flea bottom needs to be renamed as it wasn\u2019t the hive of poverty it had once been in the era of the Lannisters rule. Jon and Dany had more than enough comforts here in the Red Keep that he\u2019d make monthly donations of food and clothes that were worn by servants down to them and handed them out personally.</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s focus on that then\u201d</p><p>It worked for maybe twenty minutes, until Jon swore he heard screaming all the way across the Red Keep. He knows he didn\u2019t, it was more than likely his mind playing tricks on him, but still, it was enough to stop him from wanting to commit to the City\u2019s issues and think about her instead.</p><p>He didn\u2019t pray to the old gods, after all he\u2019s seen in the world he doubted any god\u2019s existence anymore, but he did pray to Sam\u2019s ability that he\u2019d keep her alive, both of them. He should\u2019ve ignored Dany, stayed with her until the end, but it had been hours and she\u2019d begged him to go until it was done. He wouldn\u2019t if it was a case of not wanting to seem weak, or not wanting to see the birth, or perhaps if she did pass, she didn\u2019t want him to see it in front of his eyes.</p><p>Whatever her reasons, it was a decision that was driving him crazy and fearful and almost alone.</p><p>\u201cSansa has birthed two children, both of which were successfully delivered by Sam, stop having a crisis you\u2019ll look like you\u2019re supposed to be celebrating your fiftieth name day\u201d Arya was growing impatient and Jon did not blame her in the slightest, but had they known about the baby they lost, then perhaps she\u2019d know why he was frightened for his Queen.</p><p>Sansa knew now, shortly after the war and her engagement and subsequent wedding to Gawen of House Glover, she\u2019d come to Jon about bleeding heavily and unsure of anyone to turn too. She\u2019d suffered a miscarriage and it had affected her mentally. Jon had offered comfort and told her the story of her and Dany losing one and from that moment, Sansa had dealt with the issue better.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m her husband, she\u2019s my Queen, let me worry\u201d Jon sighs, thinking back to the times in which his worries were the living dead killing all of men-kind.</p><p>So much had changed and so much was still to change now that he and Daenerys were to become parents. The capital had been so happy at the news of their King and Queen welcoming a child soon, and thankfully, the other lords in the kingdom had too. Jon had struggled with it on some occasions. A child was something Jon had always wanted but never envisioned he would have when he was serving on the wall, but something that had come true and very shortly, he\u2019d have to be a father.</p><p>Would he be a good one?</p><p>\u201cYour Grace\u201d Jon hears behind him and so he turns to note several guardsmen and Sam, the Maester and man he trusted amongst everyone else. He was covered in blood, as was to be expected after delivering a baby, but his appearance still filled him with dread.</p><p>\u201cIs everything alright?\u201d Tyrion is the first one to speak.</p><p>\u201cMother and babe are both alright\u201d Sam nods and Jon almost wants to fall to his knees. The relief that over spills in his body is almost too much to handle. He doesn\u2019t know whether to sit down, to run to Dany\u2019s side, to kiss Sam even. \u201cThe Queen has lost a lot of blood however, so she needs to rest up for a few weeks, eat plenty and drink lots of water to get her up and running again\u201d Sam takes a small pause. \u201cIt\u2019s a girl\u201d</p><p>Arya squeals piercingly into the air and yet Jon isn\u2019t affected by it, he\u2019s just shocked, his entire system falling apart as he imagines a small girl in his arms. A girl, a little daughter to call my own, our beautiful miracle, our beloved angel . Jon needs to see them both, he need to hold her in her arms and look at the beautiful life he and Dany created together.</p><p>\u201cCan I seem them?\u201d Jon ask, knowing that even if Sam said know he\u2019d still go anyways. Sam just nods and that\u2019s all Jon needs to start a quick pace towards his own bedchambers.</p><p>The halls are quiet when he leaves Tyrion\u2019s chambers, only guardsmen with smiles on their faces as Jon feels glee and anticipation build in his chest. He follows the way to his chambers that he was so familiar with at this point, seeing servants cleaning and clearing stuff away, seeing cats up on the balcony, seeing the steps to their space. She was there, his little princess was waiting for him, and his queen too.</p><p>When he reached the door to his chambers, he was greeted by Missandei who was holding sheets covered in blood, she was smiling brightly when her eyes connected with Dany\u2019s. Clearly happy both the Queen and the girl were okay. She gleefully grins before heading off in the direction Jon came from, leaving him to open the door.</p><p>The sound he was greeted with was like music to his eyes, a soft gurgling and a sweet song that melted away every fear in his body. He did not know the song, he thinks perhaps she made it up, but her voice is tunely and melodic and the happiness that was radiating from it was enough to send Jon wild. He sees them then, Dany, sat up in the bed with a small clothed babe in her arms. Jon, in an instant, is at her side.</p><p>\u201cStars above\u201d Jon whispers as Dany kisses him on the cheek. \u201cShe\u2019s absolutely perfect\u201d</p><p>As he looked at her, he notices she has been born with a thick head full of hair, black hair like his own and a little bit all over the place. Her eyes however, magnificently violet and delightfully wild. Jon knows the babe can\u2019t see them both yet, but she was content just being in her mother\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here\u201d Dany sighed, Jon knew she was tired. \u201cShe needs to hear her Father speak to her\u201d</p><p>She passed him over and for what felt like hours, Jon just held her in his arms and looked at her. She was the most perfect creation that has ever been because of him. He loved her with every drop of blood in his veins, every breath in his lungs and ever word in his mouth. He whispered to her, promised her that he would protect her until his last breath, love her until he could not any longer and he even shed tears. He was sensitive in the moment but he did not care.</p><p>She was a dream.</p><p>\u201cI want to call her Lyanna\u201d He says out of nowhere, not having heard anything Dany had said, just cut off from it all as he stared at the perfect babe in his arms. \u201cI think my mother deserves that\u201d He stated. After everything his own mother went through, everything she and his real father gave up for him, and after wanting to know about her and finally finding out the truth, Jon felt sure that was the little babe in his arms name. \u201cIf that\u2019s okay with you\u201d</p><p>\u201cLittle Lyanna Targaryen\u201d She sighs, sleep wanting to take his wife over. She was now laying down, hoping to get a moment of sleep. Jon did not mind, it meant he got to hold his babe for longer. Little Lyanna Targaryen, it was. \u201cI like it, then if we have another one, we\u2019ll call him Robb\u201d</p><p>If we have another one, we\u2019ll call him Robb.</p><p>Jon liked the idea, but they had everything they needed for now. Him, his queen and their beautiful Princess Lyanna. A life Jon never envisioned, but one he was grateful of nonetheless.</p>",

He could stand on the Balcony and see their chambers from it, but he wouldn\u2019t know what was happening.</p><p>They\u2019d lost a babe already, after the first time they\u2019d made love on the boat from dragonstone to White Harbour, Dany\u2019s bleeding had not arrived. They didn\u2019t count their chickens before they hatched, both of them knowing what happened to her last babe, but when her belly had began to swell with life they were joyous. Jon requested they not tell anyone, as only Missandei, Sam and themselves knew at that moment. But about ten weeks after the conception, Dany bled hard and the babe was lost.</p><p>She\u2019d cried for weeks in private with him, they\u2019d shared his chambers and it had been heart-wrenching to see her suffer. She put on a smile for the lords of Winterfell, and when they\u2019d caught her crying she\u2019d always played it off as the lose of her Dragon, which in a sense was also her child. So when her belly had become swollen once again six months ago, they\u2019d been very joyous yet extremely cautious. Jon had not let her do anything, she was to relax for the first few months, must to her annoyance.</p><p>And now, she was in labour, a month early.</p><p>To make matters worse, Lord Baratheon and Lady Stark (Jon\u2019s sister) had sprung upon them a surprise visit, which meant they too were in the hands chambers, drinking with him as the entertainment Tyrion had quickly thrown together for the visiting family got cut short. Daenerys was in the middle of giving a speech when she\u2019d gushed on the floor and began to feel light headed.</p><p>She was early, and this was all the more reason Jon was worried. The chances of both of them surviving was very small, but he\u2019d hoped that she had, they both had. If she was to go\u2026 Jon couldn\u2019t even bare to think about it, he loved her so hopelessly that the even consideration that Daenerys Targaryen, his wife, his queen, would never see him again, would never look at him with those eyes, was completely consuming him</p><p>\u201cStop pacing, you idiot\u201d Arya grumbled, fiddling with a knife, twisting it between her fingers. The Valyrian blade that Bran had bestowed upon her all those years ago, before he\u2019s met his end\u2026 Jon shook his head and did as he was told. He may be the king, but when Ayra said to do something, he listened without question.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s natural to be fearful, Your Grace\u201d Tyrion countered, pouring red wine into his goblet and almost downing it instantly. \u201cBut I can assure you she\u2019s in very good hands\u201d</p><p>Jon knew she was, Sam had delivered several babies now including that of his sister, Sansa\u2019s two children with her husband up in the north. He may be Lord of Horn Hill, but he also was their maester, and Jon trusted him more than anyone else besides Daenerys.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps we can do something to take your mind off of everything, Your Grace?\u201d Gendry offered. Nothing would take Jon\u2019s mind off of it, he knew as such, but he took the bate and sat down at the table with the other three. \u201cAre there any pressing issues that need resolving in the city?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been dealing with a speight of theft in flea bottom\u201d Jon shrugs, reminding himself that flea bottom needs to be renamed as it wasn\u2019t the hive of poverty it had once been in the era of the Lannisters rule. Jon and Dany had more than enough comforts here in the Red Keep that he\u2019d make monthly donations of food and clothes that were worn by servants down to them and handed them out personally.</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s focus on that then\u201d</p><p>It worked for maybe twenty minutes, until Jon swore he heard screaming all the way across the Red Keep. He knows he didn\u2019t, it was more than likely his mind playing tricks on him, but still, it was enough to stop him from wanting to commit to the City\u2019s issues and think about her instead.</p><p>He didn\u2019t pray to the old gods, after all he\u2019s seen in the world he doubted any god\u2019s existence anymore, but he did pray to Sam\u2019s ability that he\u2019d keep her alive, both of them. He should\u2019ve ignored Dany, stayed with her until the end, but it had been hours and she\u2019d begged him to go until it was done. He wouldn\u2019t if it was a case of not wanting to seem weak, or not wanting to see the birth, or perhaps if she did pass, she didn\u2019t want him to see it in front of his eyes.</p><p>Whatever her reasons, it was a decision that was driving him crazy and fearful and almost alone.</p><p>\u201cSansa has birthed two children, both of which were successfully delivered by Sam, stop having a crisis you\u2019ll look like you\u2019re supposed to be celebrating your fiftieth name day\u201d Arya was growing impatient and Jon did not blame her in the slightest, but had they known about the baby they lost, then perhaps she\u2019d know why he was frightened for his Queen.</p><p>Sansa knew now, shortly after the war and her engagement and subsequent wedding to Gawen of House Glover, she\u2019d come to Jon about bleeding heavily and unsure of anyone to turn too. She\u2019d suffered a miscarriage and it had affected her mentally. Jon had offered comfort and told her the story of her and Dany losing one and from that moment, Sansa had dealt with the issue better.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m her husband, she\u2019s my Queen, let me worry\u201d Jon sighs, thinking back to the times in which his worries were the living dead killing all of men-kind.</p><p>So much had changed and so much was still to change now that he and Daenerys were to become parents. The capital had been so happy at the news of their King and Queen welcoming a child soon, and thankfully, the other lords in the kingdom had too. Jon had struggled with it on some occasions. A child was something Jon had always wanted but never envisioned he would have when he was serving on the wall, but something that had come true and very shortly, he\u2019d have to be a father.</p><p>Would he be a good one?</p><p>\u201cYour Grace\u201d Jon hears behind him and so he turns to note several guardsmen and Sam, the Maester and man he trusted amongst everyone else. He was covered in blood, as was to be expected after delivering a baby, but his appearance still filled him with dread.</p><p>\u201cIs everything alright?\u201d Tyrion is the first one to speak.</p><p>\u201cMother and babe are both alright\u201d Sam nods and Jon almost wants to fall to his knees. The relief that over spills in his body is almost too much to handle. He doesn\u2019t know whether to sit down, to run to Dany\u2019s side, to kiss Sam even. \u201cThe Queen has lost a lot of blood however, so she needs to rest up for a few weeks, eat plenty and drink lots of water to get her up and running again\u201d Sam takes a small pause. \u201cIt\u2019s a girl\u201d</p><p>Arya squeals piercingly into the air and yet Jon isn\u2019t affected by it, he\u2019s just shocked, his entire system falling apart as he imagines a small girl in his arms. A girl, a little daughter to call my own, our beautiful miracle, our beloved angel . Jon needs to see them both, he need to hold her in her arms and look at the beautiful life he and Dany created together.</p><p>\u201cCan I seem them?\u201d Jon ask, knowing that even if Sam said know he\u2019d still go anyways. Sam just nods and that\u2019s all Jon needs to start a quick pace towards his own bedchambers.</p><p>The halls are quiet when he leaves Tyrion\u2019s chambers, only guardsmen with smiles on their faces as Jon feels glee and anticipation build in his chest. He follows the way to his chambers that he was so familiar with at this point, seeing servants cleaning and clearing stuff away, seeing cats up on the balcony, seeing the steps to their space. She was there, his little princess was waiting for him, and his queen too.</p><p>When he reached the door to his chambers, he was greeted by Missandei who was holding sheets covered in blood, she was smiling brightly when her eyes connected with Dany\u2019s. Clearly happy both the Queen and the girl were okay. She gleefully grins before heading off in the direction Jon came from, leaving him to open the door.</p><p>The sound he was greeted with was like music to his eyes, a soft gurgling and a sweet song that melted away every fear in his body. He did not know the song, he thinks perhaps she made it up, but her voice is tunely and melodic and the happiness that was radiating from it was enough to send Jon wild. He sees them then, Dany, sat up in the bed with a small clothed babe in her arms. Jon, in an instant, is at her side.</p><p>\u201cStars above\u201d Jon whispers as Dany kisses him on the cheek. \u201cShe\u2019s absolutely perfect\u201d</p><p>As he looked at her, he notices she has been born with a thick head full of hair, black hair like his own and a little bit all over the place. Her eyes however, magnificently violet and delightfully wild. Jon knows the babe can\u2019t see them both yet, but she was content just being in her mother\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here\u201d Dany sighed, Jon knew she was tired. \u201cShe needs to hear her Father speak to her\u201d</p><p>She passed him over and for what felt like hours, Jon just held her in his arms and looked at her. She was the most perfect creation that has ever been because of him. He loved her with every drop of blood in his veins, every breath in his lungs and ever word in his mouth. He whispered to her, promised her that he would protect her until his last breath, love her until he could not any longer and he even shed tears. He was sensitive in the moment but he did not care.</p><p>She was a dream.</p><p>\u201cI want to call her Lyanna\u201d He says out of nowhere, not having heard anything Dany had said, just cut off from it all as he stared at the perfect babe in his arms. \u201cI think my mother deserves that\u201d He stated. After everything his own mother went through, everything she and his real father gave up for him, and after wanting to know about her and finally finding out the truth, Jon felt sure that was the little babe in his arms name. \u201cIf that\u2019s okay with you\u201d</p><p>\u201cLittle Lyanna Targaryen\u201d She sighs, sleep wanting to take his wife over. She was now laying down, hoping to get a moment of sleep. Jon did not mind, it meant he got to hold his babe for longer. Little Lyanna Targaryen, it was. \u201cI like it, then if we have another one, we\u2019ll call him Robb\u201d</p><p>If we have another one, we\u2019ll call him Robb.</p><p>Jon liked the idea, but they had everything they needed for now. Him, his queen and their beautiful Princess Lyanna. A life Jon never envisioned, but one he was grateful of nonetheless.</p>",

The prompts have been provided and the stories have all been written and I gotta say you\u2019re in for a lot of Jonerys content. So Day 7, the last day, 20th February, which is when I\u2019m uploading this, the prompt I chose was 'Free Choice\u2019. So I got thinking and decided to expand on my glorious reign series and give you the birth of their first child, Lyanna.</p><p>Link:\u00a0<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17864576\">https://archiveofourown.org/works/17864576</a></p><p>\u2014-</p><p>Jon was going crazy.</p><p>Waiting for the arrival of his and Dany\u2019s child had left him drinking with Tyrion in the hands quarter as a promise to Dany that he\u2019d stay away while she laboured their baby. All of the dogs in King\u2019s Landing were howling, due to the storm that had captured the city and by extension scared the inhabitants into staying inside. Lighting and rain, flashing and fierce. There had been four storms since he and Dany assumed the throne five years ago, but this had by far been the worse.

The prompts have been provided and the stories have all been written and I gotta say you&rsquo;re in for a lot of Jonerys content. So Day 7, the last day, 20th February, which is when I&rsquo;m uploading this, the prompt I chose was 'Free Choice&rsquo;. So I got thinking and decided to expand on my glorious reign series and give you the birth of their first child, Lyanna.</p><p>Link:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17864576\">https://archiveofourown.org/works/17864576</a></p><p>&mdash;-</p><p>Jon was going crazy.</p><p>Waiting for the arrival of his and Dany&rsquo;s child had left him drinking with Tyrion in the hands quarter as a promise to Dany that he&rsquo;d stay away while she laboured their baby. All of the dogs in King&rsquo;s Landing were howling, due to the storm that had captured the city and by extension scared the inhabitants into staying inside. Lighting and rain, flashing and fierce. There had been four storms since he and Dany assumed the throne five years ago, but this had by far been the worse. Ironic that their child would also be known as Stormborn like it&rsquo;s mother, but that also left deep rooted fear within Jon himself.</p><p>He wondered if she would survive, after all both of their mother&rsquo;s had perished when giving birth to them, although Sam was dealing with her, the only person he trusted. But there was still this nagging feeling of fear within him that meant he was on edge and pacing the hands chambers all the while it was going on. He could stand on the Balcony and see their chambers from it, but he wouldn&rsquo;t know what was happening.</p><p>They&rsquo;d lost a babe already, after the first time they&rsquo;d made love on the boat from dragonstone to White Harbour, Dany&rsquo;s bleeding had not arrived. They didn&rsquo;t count their chickens before they hatched, both of them knowing what happened to her last babe, but when her belly had began to swell with life they were joyous. Jon requested they not tell anyone, as only Missandei, Sam and themselves knew at that moment. But about ten weeks after the conception, Dany bled hard and the babe was lost.</p><p>She&rsquo;d cried for weeks in private with him, they&rsquo;d shared his chambers and it had been heart-wrenching to see her suffer. She put on a smile for the lords of Winterfell, and when they&rsquo;d caught her crying she&rsquo;d always played it off as the lose of her Dragon, which in a sense was also her child. So when her belly had become swollen once again six months ago, they&rsquo;d been very joyous yet extremely cautious. Jon had not let her do anything, she was to relax for the first few months, must to her annoyance.</p><p>And now, she was in labour, a month early.</p><p>To make matters worse, Lord Baratheon and Lady Stark (Jon&rsquo;s sister) had sprung upon them a surprise visit, which meant they too were in the hands chambers, drinking with him as the entertainment Tyrion had quickly thrown together for the visiting family got cut short. Daenerys was in the middle of giving a speech when she&rsquo;d gushed on the floor and began to feel light headed.</p><p>She was early, and this was all the more reason Jon was worried. The chances of both of them surviving was very small, but he&rsquo;d hoped that she had, they both had. If she was to go&hellip; Jon couldn&rsquo;t even bare to think about it, he loved her so hopelessly that the even consideration that Daenerys Targaryen, his wife, his queen, would never see him again, would never look at him with those eyes, was completely consuming him</p><p>&ldquo;Stop pacing, you idiot&rdquo; Arya grumbled, fiddling with a knife, twisting it between her fingers. The Valyrian blade that Bran had bestowed upon her all those years ago, before he&rsquo;s met his end&hellip; Jon shook his head and did as he was told. He may be the king, but when Ayra said to do something, he listened without question.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s natural to be fearful, Your Grace&rdquo; Tyrion countered, pouring red wine into his goblet and almost downing it instantly. &ldquo;But I can assure you she&rsquo;s in very good hands&rdquo;</p><p>Jon knew she was, Sam had delivered several babies now including that of his sister, Sansa&rsquo;s two children with her husband up in the north. He may be Lord of Horn Hill, but he also was their maester, and Jon trusted him more than anyone else besides Daenerys.</p><p>&ldquo;Perhaps we can do something to take your mind off of everything, Your Grace?&rdquo; Gendry offered. Nothing would take Jon&rsquo;s mind off of it, he knew as such, but he took the bate and sat down at the table with the other three. &ldquo;Are there any pressing issues that need resolving in the city?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been dealing with a speight of theft in flea bottom&rdquo; Jon shrugs, reminding himself that flea bottom needs to be renamed as it wasn&rsquo;t the hive of poverty it had once been in the era of the Lannisters rule. Jon and Dany had more than enough comforts here in the Red Keep that he&rsquo;d make monthly donations of food and clothes that were worn by servants down to them and handed them out personally.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, let&rsquo;s focus on that then&rdquo;</p><p>It worked for maybe twenty minutes, until Jon swore he heard screaming all the way across the Red Keep. He knows he didn&rsquo;t, it was more than likely his mind playing tricks on him, but still, it was enough to stop him from wanting to commit to the City&rsquo;s issues and think about her instead.</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t pray to the old gods, after all he&rsquo;s seen in the world he doubted any god&rsquo;s existence anymore, but he did pray to Sam&rsquo;s ability that he&rsquo;d keep her alive, both of them. He should&rsquo;ve ignored Dany, stayed with her until the end, but it had been hours and she&rsquo;d begged him to go until it was done. He wouldn&rsquo;t if it was a case of not wanting to seem weak, or not wanting to see the birth, or perhaps if she did pass, she didn&rsquo;t want him to see it in front of his eyes.</p><p>Whatever her reasons, it was a decision that was driving him crazy and fearful and almost alone.</p><p>&ldquo;Sansa has birthed two children, both of which were successfully delivered by Sam, stop having a crisis you&rsquo;ll look like you&rsquo;re supposed to be celebrating your fiftieth name day&rdquo; Arya was growing impatient and Jon did not blame her in the slightest, but had they known about the baby they lost, then perhaps she&rsquo;d know why he was frightened for his Queen.</p><p>Sansa knew now, shortly after the war and her engagement and subsequent wedding to Gawen of House Glover, she&rsquo;d come to Jon about bleeding heavily and unsure of anyone to turn too. She&rsquo;d suffered a miscarriage and it had affected her mentally. Jon had offered comfort and told her the story of her and Dany losing one and from that moment, Sansa had dealt with the issue better.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m her husband, she&rsquo;s my Queen, let me worry&rdquo; Jon sighs, thinking back to the times in which his worries were the living dead killing all of men-kind.</p><p>So much had changed and so much was still to change now that he and Daenerys were to become parents. The capital had been so happy at the news of their King and Queen welcoming a child soon, and thankfully, the other lords in the kingdom had too. Jon had struggled with it on some occasions. A child was something Jon had always wanted but never envisioned he would have when he was serving on the wall, but something that had come true and very shortly, he&rsquo;d have to be a father.</p><p>Would he be a good one?</p><p>&ldquo;Your Grace&rdquo; Jon hears behind him and so he turns to note several guardsmen and Sam, the Maester and man he trusted amongst everyone else. He was covered in blood, as was to be expected after delivering a baby, but his appearance still filled him with dread.</p><p>&ldquo;Is everything alright?&rdquo; Tyrion is the first one to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;Mother and babe are both alright&rdquo; Sam nods and Jon almost wants to fall to his knees. The relief that over spills in his body is almost too much to handle. He doesn&rsquo;t know whether to sit down, to run to Dany&rsquo;s side, to kiss Sam even. &ldquo;The Queen has lost a lot of blood however, so she needs to rest up for a few weeks, eat plenty and drink lots of water to get her up and running again&rdquo; Sam takes a small pause. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a girl&rdquo;</p><p>Arya squeals piercingly into the air and yet Jon isn&rsquo;t affected by it, he&rsquo;s just shocked, his entire system falling apart as he imagines a small girl in his arms. A girl, a little daughter to call my own, our beautiful miracle, our beloved angel . Jon needs to see them both, he need to hold her in her arms and look at the beautiful life he and Dany created together.</p><p>&ldquo;Can I seem them?&rdquo; Jon ask, knowing that even if Sam said know he&rsquo;d still go anyways. Sam just nods and that&rsquo;s all Jon needs to start a quick pace towards his own bedchambers.</p><p>The halls are quiet when he leaves Tyrion&rsquo;s chambers, only guardsmen with smiles on their faces as Jon feels glee and anticipation build in his chest. He follows the way to his chambers that he was so familiar with at this point, seeing servants cleaning and clearing stuff away, seeing cats up on the balcony, seeing the steps to their space. She was there, his little princess was waiting for him, and his queen too.</p><p>When he reached the door to his chambers, he was greeted by Missandei who was holding sheets covered in blood, she was smiling brightly when her eyes connected with Dany&rsquo;s. Clearly happy both the Queen and the girl were okay. She gleefully grins before heading off in the direction Jon came from, leaving him to open the door.</p><p>The sound he was greeted with was like music to his eyes, a soft gurgling and a sweet song that melted away every fear in his body. He did not know the song, he thinks perhaps she made it up, but her voice is tunely and melodic and the happiness that was radiating from it was enough to send Jon wild. He sees them then, Dany, sat up in the bed with a small clothed babe in her arms. Jon, in an instant, is at her side.</p><p>&ldquo;Stars above&rdquo; Jon whispers as Dany kisses him on the cheek. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s absolutely perfect&rdquo;</p><p>As he looked at her, he notices she has been born with a thick head full of hair, black hair like his own and a little bit all over the place. Her eyes however, magnificently violet and delightfully wild. Jon knows the babe can&rsquo;t see them both yet, but she was content just being in her mother&rsquo;s arm.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re here&rdquo; Dany sighed, Jon knew she was tired. &ldquo;She needs to hear her Father speak to her&rdquo;</p><p>She passed him over and for what felt like hours, Jon just held her in his arms and looked at her. She was the most perfect creation that has ever been because of him. He loved her with every drop of blood in his veins, every breath in his lungs and ever word in his mouth. He whispered to her, promised her that he would protect her until his last breath, love her until he could not any longer and he even shed tears. He was sensitive in the moment but he did not care.</p><p>She was a dream.</p><p>&ldquo;I want to call her Lyanna&rdquo; He says out of nowhere, not having heard anything Dany had said, just cut off from it all as he stared at the perfect babe in his arms. &ldquo;I think my mother deserves that&rdquo; He stated. After everything his own mother went through, everything she and his real father gave up for him, and after wanting to know about her and finally finding out the truth, Jon felt sure that was the little babe in his arms name. &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s okay with you&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Little Lyanna Targaryen&rdquo; She sighs, sleep wanting to take his wife over. She was now laying down, hoping to get a moment of sleep. Jon did not mind, it meant he got to hold his babe for longer. Little Lyanna Targaryen, it was. &ldquo;I like it, then if we have another one, we&rsquo;ll call him Robb&rdquo;</p><p>If we have another one, we&rsquo;ll call him Robb.</p><p>Jon liked the idea, but they had everything they needed for now. Him, his queen and their beautiful Princess Lyanna. A life Jon never envisioned, but one he was grateful of nonetheless.</p>",

As she keeps reminding everyone, she won the BOTB with a Vale army - that slew thousands of men - who all died with no dignity on the battlefield with their limbs chopped off, their guts hanging out and probably shitting themselves while dying.

Her pale face swam before him, those piercing blue eyes shining in the dark of his tent. She had pulled her furs closer, as if these would serve as protection from what was to come. They had quarreled, Sansa telling him not to make a mistake, to not do the things Ramsay had expected. And he&rsquo;d shouted back, telling her they&rsquo;d never have the number of men needed to take back Winterfell. But that he believed in the odds stacked against them. And it had been then that Sansa had uttered the words Jon had never wanted to hear. <i>If we lose&hellip; I won&rsquo;t go back to Ramsay alive</i>. She had stared at him then with those same blue eyes, as if daring him to disagree. <i>Do you understand me?</i> She had asked, her gaze unwavering, her heartbeat steady. Jon had barely been able to breathe. Of course he knew what she meant. Of course he knew the truth of her words. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t ever let him touch you again.&rdquo; He&rsquo;d said the only thing he could think to say. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll protect you, I promise.&rdquo; It was the only vow he knew he could make, the only promise that meant anything to him. Sansa had looked like she might smile, her eyes darkening as she gazed right at him. <i>No one can protect me</i>, she had said softly, <i>no one can protect anyone</i>. Then she had gone, disappearing into the darkness outside, to return to her own tent where she&rsquo;d remain awake well into the night.</p><p>He couldn&rsquo;t forget that. Not the sound of her voice, not the intense stare of her eyes. She had meant what she had said, about not returning to Ramsay alive. Jon knew that if he lost tomorrow, he&rsquo;d lose more than just Winterfell, more than just Rickon. He would lose Sansa. The very thought left him empty inside. No one can protect me, those soft words she&rsquo;d spoken wounded him more than any scream or insult could have. Those were the words of a young woman let down by everyone around her. Those were the words of someone without faith, without hope. Sansa had been beaten and betrayed, sold and abused, all at the hands of the men around her. Jon knew he could not protect her from what had happened to her already, but he would die defending her future. </p><p>Unable to shake her from his mind, he pulled on his furs and strode from his tent, the icy blast of cold air sending chills down his spine. He walked until he reached the red priestess&rsquo; tent, going inside without invite. Melisandre sat alone within, turning her head as he approached. &ldquo;You were not at the war council.&rdquo; He commented as she shifted in the chair to look at him, regarding him with her dark blue eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;I am not a soldier.&rdquo; She replied with a sigh. If she could tell he was restless, she did not comment on it. </p><p>&ldquo;Any advice?&rdquo; Jon heard himself ask, though a part of him already knew she would have none. </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lose,&rdquo; the red priestess replied, turning back to face the fire she sat before. Jon&rsquo;s lips twitched with a smile, knowing that was the best advice any one could have given him. <i>Don&rsquo;t lose indeed,</i> he thought, he could not begin to imagine what it would be like if he truly did lose to Ramsay. </p><p>At once, his mind turned to Sansa&hellip; To her smile that had just begun to return to her&hellip; To how soft the skin of her palm was when her hand gripped his own&hellip; To the way her voice changed when she said his name. No, he could not lose&hellip; But if he did? If he did&hellip; He could not, would not, live without her. \u00a0&quot;If I do&hellip; If I fall tomorrow&hellip; Don&rsquo;t bring me back.&ldquo; Melisandre turned back to him then, her eyes widening as they fell upon his somber features. The priestess could tell he was telling the truth then, that he truly did not want revived if the battle took a turn for the worst. Though she argued with him, Jon left her tent a few minutes later telling himself all would be well, that he would stay true to the promise he&rsquo;d made Sansa.</p><p> Approaching Sansa&rsquo;s tent, he had half of a mind to go inside, to tell her how much he cared, to tell her that everything would end as it should. But he could not see the light of a candle within and so he told himself she&rsquo;d gone off to sleep and he would tell her tomorrow when the battle was over. \u00a0Even if she didn&rsquo;t believe him, Jon would keep his promise to protect her. Even if it killed him, he&rsquo;d take Ramsay Bolton with him. </p><p>It was as he had said, he would never let him touch her again. <br/></p>",

No one can protect me, those soft words she\u2019d spoken wounded him more than any scream or insult could have. Those were the words of a young woman let down by everyone around her. Those were the words of someone without faith, without hope. Sansa had been beaten and betrayed, sold and abused, all at the hands of the men around her. Jon knew he could not protect her from what had happened to her already, but he would die defending her future. </p><p>Unable to shake her from his mind, he pulled on his furs and strode from his tent, the icy blast of cold air sending chills down his spine.

Jon\u2019s lips twitched with a smile, knowing that was the best advice any one could have given him. <i>Don\u2019t lose indeed,</i> he thought, he could not begin to imagine what it would be like if he truly did lose to Ramsay. </p><p>At once, his mind turned to Sansa\u2026 To her smile that had just begun to return to her\u2026 To how soft the skin of her palm was when her hand gripped his own\u2026 To the way her voice changed when she said his name. No, he could not lose\u2026 But if he did? If he did\u2026 He could not, would not, live without her. \u00a0\"If I do\u2026 If I fall tomorrow\u2026 Don\u2019t bring me back.\u201c Melisandre turned back to him then, her eyes widening as they fell upon his somber features. The priestess could tell he was telling the truth then, that he truly did not want revived if the battle took a turn for the worst. Though she argued with him, Jon left her tent a few minutes later telling himself all would be well, that he would stay true to the promise he\u2019d made Sansa.</p><p> Approaching Sansa\u2019s tent, he had half of a mind to go inside, to tell her how much he cared, to tell her that everything would end as it should. But he could not see the light of a candle within and so he told himself she\u2019d gone off to sleep and he would tell her tomorrow when the battle was over. \u00a0Even if she didn\u2019t believe him, Jon would keep his promise to protect her. Even if it killed him, he\u2019d take Ramsay Bolton with him. </p><p>It was as he had said, he would never let him touch her again. <br></p>",

She keeps getting better at lying and she\u2019s currently relying on her fake identity to survive. But just because she says lies that doesn\u2019t necessary means that she likes it. I believe that soon will come a time where she will have to choose between continuing the easy road of lying or following the hard path of truth. I\u2019m rooting for the second. After all, Sansa never wanted to play the game of thrones herself. </p><p>I can see why you picked that struggle for Arya but for me her major one is choosing between being alone (and No One) and being part of the pack (and a Stark). Ned\u2019s famous quote about the lone wolf dying and \u00a0the pack surviving keeps reappearing on some crucial scenes in her point of view for a reason. I think it\u2019s because so far Arya has achieved more things while being alone while tragedy has befallen to her family members who weren\u2019t alone (Catelyn and Robb, Bran and Rickon). But this quote coming from a person she really respected (her father) is a reminder that maybe on the darkest days to come will be better to be part of the pack instead of being alone. </p><p>Moving on to Jon, I think his major struggle is between doing his duty and doing what he believes it\u2019s the right thing. Jon always wanted to appear a dutiful person and not to be associated with the bastard\u2019s stigma (aka the bastard\u2019s honor). However, he also has a strong sense of justice that often conflicts with his duty. This is evident on the fifth book where that struggle of his takes central place and in the end it\u2019s partly the reason why he got killed.\u00a0</p><p>Daenerys most struggles come from her queedom. Daenerys doesn\u2019t have an older relative or a mentor to help her navigate the path of a leader and often questions her actions as the Queen. The major struggle being torn between being a merciful queen and a successful one. It comes natural to her to help others since she has been through so much all her life. That often comes in conflict with her wanting to follow the steps of her successful ancestors. The dragons plant to trees is a quote that shows exactly this. Thankfully Daenerys isn\u2019t only a dragon but a Mhysa as well.\u00a0</p><p>I admit that I\u2019m not sure about the major struggle of Bran and Tyruon(if they have a single major conflict at all). However I\u2019ll give it a try.\u00a0</p><p>Bran : so far his major inner struggle is about whether he should continue using Hodor\u2019s body for his own means. Bran\u2019s young age pretends us from seeing his actions in such a bad light as we would do if he was older. However, ripping someone off his free will is not a morally good action and I believe that Bran will come to realize it on the last two books.</p><p>\u00a0Tyrion : I think his major struggle is choosing whether he will lived hunted by his past ghosts or learning from the past. He\u2019s a character who has faced many hardships in his life and for a lot of shit he\u2019s going through his family is to blame. On the fifth book, he was at his lowest \u201cdefeated\u201d by the past ghosts and having little hope for the future. But at some point on the future books he\u2019ll have to decide whether he\u2019ll let everything that happened in the past bring him down or if he\u2019ll take a brave step forward, not forgetting his past but also no letting it define him.</p>",
