Every morning I&rsquo;d wake up at exactly six in the morning and then get ready for the day\u2013 and somehow, every morning felt better. As every morning came, I felt less dread to get out of bed.</p><p>After getting out of bed, I&rsquo;m instantly greeted by Bucky who shows up at my door by seven and joins me for breakfast. Stephen on the other hand wasn&rsquo;t all too thrilled that I had male company besides him, he&rsquo;d probably get even more furious if he knew it wasn&rsquo;t just Bucky I had for company. Stephen joins Bucky and I for breakfast most of the time\u2013 sometimes he isn&rsquo;t in the tower but whenever I&rsquo;d ask, he would just tell me it wasn&rsquo;t for me to worry. I&rsquo;d shrug it off, not wanting to get any negativity to ruin the positive mood that I&rsquo;ve grown accustomed to the past few days. All thanks to <i>Bucky.</i></p><p>Usually after a light breakfast, Bucky and I would go out for a run before returning back into the tower to do some stretching then start sparring. Conversations come here and there\u2013 sometimes Bucky is silent and I didn&rsquo;t mind. And sometimes he would talk when he tries teaching me new things. Thanks to Bucky, I&rsquo;ve learnt to deal with my emotions more\u2013learnt to accept them, and so far I hadn&rsquo;t had any of those <i>&lsquo;blackouts&rsquo;</i> that Bucky has decided to call them whenever my emotions take over my actions.</p><p><i>Oh, don&rsquo;t get me wrong.</i> The first few days of training with Bucky consisted with the same tense yelling but as time passed, Bucky and I fell into a pattern and I soon figured out to control them as Bucky never took it easy on me, making sure that I still had my emotions in check and was still using my head.</p><p><i>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve gotten soft, Bucky.&rdquo; I teased, a playful grin on my face as I successfully pin him down on the padded mats. He rolled his eyes before rolling us over with him now on top in one swift move. I let out a huff.</i></p><p><i>He laughed at this and shook his head, pinning my arms down on top of my head, &ldquo;Think again, Y/N. You always let your guard down, always so smug. You need to stop this.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>I scowled upon hearing his words before lifting my head up, aiming towards his arm and sinking my teeth down painfully on his skin. He instantly reacts with a surprised yell and I use the opportunity to break free from his hold, pushing myself up to stand and using the strength of my feet to hold him down by the chest.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Who said I was done, anyway?&rdquo; I scoffed smugly and all he could do was grin.</i></p><p>Though, I suppose I wouldn&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;d be able to keep my emotions in check when it came to other people. I&rsquo;ve only gotten used to Bucky\u2013 other people, not so much. I mean, I&rsquo;ve gotten to know a few of the Avengers so far.</p><p>There&rsquo;s Steve Rogers\u2013 Captain America, who treats me like a little sister. I&rsquo;ve grown fond of him lately, as he approaches me from time to time. He treated me almost like how Stephen does; he&rsquo;s become protective of me even. He&rsquo;s the only one, <i>at least I&rsquo;d like to think so,</i> who knew of my trips to the library at night with a particular God\u2013 <i>as he likes to claim himself,</i> I&rsquo;m not sure if it was true just yet. I have yet to meet his brother who hasn&rsquo;t returned from a Kree mission, apparently he had wanted to help just as much to find help for me.</p><p>Then there&rsquo;s Tony Stark\u2013 the Iron Man, who&rsquo;s suddenly a father figure in my eyes. Protective; always worrying if I&rsquo;ve settled in okay or if I&rsquo;m comfortable with my sleeping arrangements. Just like Stephen, worried if I had eaten enough or if I needed anything. Or maybe he was more like a mother, always fussing about every little thing.</p><p>Moving towards Natasha Romanoff\u2013 or Black Widow as she likes to be called, is like a sister I&rsquo;ve always wished to have. When I&rsquo;m not outside the comforts of my room, she&rsquo;d come barging in if she wasn&rsquo;t busy and from time to time, to pull me out to explore the city\u2013 which trust me, gave Stephen a heart attack. But I&rsquo;ve loved every moment of it, always savoring the freedom whenever Natasha would take me out on these trips. I had been too confined in the manor for so long that I had forgotten what being really outside felt. Also, she insists that I have feelings for Bucky, almost tormenting me to speak up and tell her something.</p><p><i>Do I have feelings for Bucky? I don&rsquo;t know.</i></p><p>He&rsquo;s just there, someone I&rsquo;ve learnt I could count on\u2013 someone who kept me grounded. He challenged me, constantly. Always wanted me to push myself, always knowing the things to say.</p><p><i>Anyways</i>\u2013 moving on to someone I&rsquo;ve just met, Doc. Or rather Doctor Bruce Banner, or the most important one to remember\u2013 <i>Hulk</i>. He&rsquo;d arrived the same day I arrived; apparently to keep an eye out for Loki\u2013 according to Loki himself, he was called by Tony to watch him. This of course, made me curious as to why. No one answers me, at least\u2013 the ones who I&rsquo;ve asked, such as Loki and Bucky. I had thought of approaching the Doc about it but he seemed standoffish at first\u2013 he was being cautious, I wouldn&rsquo;t blame him. As he&rsquo;s learnt to trust me, he told me about Loki and what he&rsquo;s done\u2013and apparently Loki gets a fright from Doc whenever he was in Hulk form. I would be, too.</p><p>That doesn&rsquo;t change though. I mean, it doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that I&rsquo;ve gone down to the library to spend time with the books and Loki, himself. He&rsquo;s become a companion. Bucky is someone I could feel comfortable with my emotions, someone like I&rsquo;ve mentioned\u2013 has kept me grounded. But for Loki, he&rsquo;s someone I can easily open up to about my feelings, about what I felt of the situation with Stephen and everything that&rsquo;s happened. And he&rsquo;s been more than a big help, especially with the whole Kree business.</p><p>I suppose Stephen would probably have a heart attack, die\u2013 get revived to just have a heart attack again if he found out that most of my nights consisted of moments with Loki in the library. It wasn&rsquo;t as if we were doing anything wrong, it&rsquo;s just that I&rsquo;ve found\u2026 <i>comfort in his presence.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Y/N? Y/N Strange, get back down to Earth.&rdquo;</i> Stephen snaps me out of my thoughts from the door, my brows furrowed in confusion. &ldquo;Steve said you were looking for me and I just got back, what did you need?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right, yeah.&rdquo; I said with a nod as I remember speaking to Steve earlier about Stephen&rsquo;s whereabouts. I watch Stephen stride towards me, eventually occupying a seat on the edge of the bed I was seated on. &ldquo;I just wanted to talk, about mum and dad\u2026&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen visually stiffens at the mention before he gives me a nod to continue speaking, &ldquo;Bucky\u2013&rdquo; I get cut off with a groan from Stephen at the mention of Bucky&rsquo;s name, I arched a brow, &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing, I guess I&rsquo;m just not used to having friendships\u2013specifically with a boy. I had hoped you would have either grown closer to Romanoff or the witch.&rdquo; He shrugged and I rolled my eyes in response.</p><p>&ldquo;Moving on\u2026&rdquo; I trailed off as I give him a look indicating that I didn&rsquo;t want to be interrupted, &ldquo;Bucky\u2013&rdquo; I repeated and watched his face scrunch up to a look of annoyance, &ldquo;He has been helping me control my emotions lately that Master Jia Li constantly reminded me doing so and I&rsquo;ve been able to channel them more properly thanks to him and he thinks that I&rsquo;m ready.&rdquo;</p><p>He raised a brow, &ldquo;Ready for what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To know more about my past, to know who my parents are without being so upset. Please, I know the last time I&rsquo;ve asked I\u2013 I went all crazy but I&rsquo;m ready now.&rdquo; I begged, nodding my head vigorously as I looked up at him with pleading eyes.</p><p>I watched his face shift from a worried look to a defeated one before he sighed with a nod. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know much, Y/N\u2026&rdquo; he trailed off as he reached out for my hands, his gesture of giving me comfort, &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t that old when you came to us as a baby and I wasn&rsquo;t even aware that my father still had contact with his brother. You remember the story about Donna don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, Donna was our\u2013<i>your</i> sister that passed away, and it strived you to be a doctor.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s <i>our </i>sister. You&rsquo;re still my sister, <i>nothing </i>will change that.&rdquo; he said sternly before speaking once more, &ldquo;Well mother and father had been devastated, broke them. It wasn&rsquo;t until you arrived, just a year old\u2013 that our parents have found the will to live again. You were everything to them.&rdquo; He said, giving a gentle squeeze to my hand. &ldquo;I never had the chance to ask them about your father but all I remember that night that he was panicking, mumbling something about Kree and handing you over to mother before fleeing. He looked scared, he didn&rsquo;t want to leave you\u2026&rdquo;</p><p>I scoffed, tears forming in the corners of my mouth. &ldquo;But he did and I still don&rsquo;t know anything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N\u2026&rdquo;</p><p>I let out a sigh before shaking my head as I flash Stephen a small reassuring smile, giving his own hand a squeeze. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine. I just, I wish I knew more.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And we will. I&rsquo;m doing the best I can to find answers and Thor is as well, I&rsquo;m sure he will return shortly with answers.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right\u2026&rdquo; I mumbled before pulling my hand away from his, &ldquo;Can I be left alone for a while? I just want the time to myself\u2026&rdquo;</p><p>I watched Stephen respond with an understanding nod before retreating out of the room. As soon as the door shut behind him, I let out a frustrated sigh and plopped myself back down onto the bed.</p><hr><p>I had spent most of my afternoon in the comforts of my room, avoiding Stephen\u2013 and that included Bucky. It wasn&rsquo;t my intention but honestly, I just wanted to be left alone. I was frustrated, not at Stephen for his vague answers but with the lack of information about my parents\u2013 <i>my real parents.</i></p><p>I had refused to leave the room when Bucky knocked and said it was time to eat some dinner, refused to speak a word to anyone as I try to put the pieces together from certain dreams that I was having. But the dreams were just as vague as Stephen&rsquo;s answers about my parents, always having missing pieces along the way and waking up sweating and screaming was something I hated. Thankfully, no one has heard my night terrors as much.</p><p>I glanced over at the digital clock and the red lights were blaring that it was almost ten. <i>That&rsquo;s right,</i> I&rsquo;ve spent the whole day after my talk with Stephen locked up in this room. Pacing, staring at the ceiling and walls. Somehow, the thought of the library pops into my head and my feet didn&rsquo;t make any protests as I began my journey, avoiding getting seen by certain avengers that were still awake and roaming around.</p><p>As I reached the library, he was already there. Lounging on the sofa that we&rsquo;ve claimed to occupy every night for the past few days, with a book in his hands.</p><p>&ldquo;I was beginning to think you&rsquo;d be avoiding me tonight as well, Y/N.&rdquo; he mused, not lifting his gaze from his book as I approached him.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;re you talking about?&rdquo; I asked as I sat on the other edge of the sofa, slipping my slippers off to bring my feet up on the couch, pulling my legs close to my chest as I face him.</p><p>He took awhile to respond after he flips a page, taking a minute to read the entry before shutting the book and placing it down on the coffee table. Turning his attention on me, I raised a brow in curiosity. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been avoiding your soldier, he&rsquo;s mentioned it to the captain a couple of times like a sick puppy in love.&rdquo; He drawled, the corner of his mouth twitching. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard from the shadows that you&rsquo;ve been cooped up in your room since this afternoon, and I had drawn up an assumption that you will not be showing up tonight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m here aren&rsquo;t I? So that&rsquo;s that.&rdquo; I said, almost in an irritated tone and all he could do was raise a brow. I rolled my eyes at him and shifted my position. Grabbing the book that I was reading last night from the coffee table, I leaned back against the sofa and began reading. No longer listening to Loki as he speaks in the background.</p><p>&ldquo;Stubborn little witch.&rdquo; He muttered underneath his breath before grabbing the book he was reading moments before I had entered and interrupted him and began reading again once more. And we continued reading in silence, neither of us bothering to speak a word to each other\u2013 even if I was practically itching to do so.</p><hr><p><i>I was practically gasping for air as I ran through the woods, my feet stumbling a little because of the broken branches along my way. My feet taking me far away as fast as I could, my heart beating rapidly against my chest.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t run away from us thorns!&rdquo; a voice laughed from behind me.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nowhere to hide thorns, we can find you. We can smell your fear.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>I held back the urge to scream at them as I continued to run, my legs feeling weak.</i></p><p><i>Silence.</i></p><p><i>I suddenly felt comfort at the thought that maybe I had lost them but not taking any chances, my feet continued despite my legs feeling like jelly. Glancing back over my shoulder, a sigh of relief leaves my lips. No one was there.</i></p><p><i>Oh how I regret it now.</i></p><p><i>Because the second that I turned my attention back up ahead, there she was. I didn&rsquo;t know who she was, but I had a feeling that she was Kree. I stop dead in my tracks as the blue skinned woman stopped a few feet away from me, her face unreadable.</i></p><p><i>Then everything went by fast as she levitated two silver orbs with her fingers, a smirk already forming on her lips.</i></p><p><i>And before I knew it\u2013the levitated orbs zoomed across the small gap between us, towards my direction.</i></p><p><i>I couldn&rsquo;t comprehend what was happening but as I looked down to where she had sent the silver orbs zooming across. My eyes widening at the sight.</i></p><p><i>It went right through my chest, blood already seeping through.</i></p><p><i>And then everything went <b>black</b>.</i></p><hr><p><i>&ldquo;Y/N! Wake up!&rdquo;</i></p><p>I gasp as I jolt up to sit, panting heavily as I feel myself drenched in sweat.

Every morning I\u2019d wake up at exactly six in the morning and then get ready for the day\u2013 and somehow, every morning felt better. As every morning came, I felt less dread to get out of bed.</p><p>After getting out of bed, I\u2019m instantly greeted by Bucky who shows up at my door by seven and joins me for breakfast. Stephen on the other hand wasn\u2019t all too thrilled that I had male company besides him, he\u2019d probably get even more furious if he knew it wasn\u2019t just Bucky I had for company. Stephen joins Bucky and I for breakfast most of the time\u2013 sometimes he isn\u2019t in the tower but whenever I\u2019d ask, he would just tell me it wasn\u2019t for me to worry. I\u2019d shrug it off, not wanting to get any negativity to ruin the positive mood that I\u2019ve grown accustomed to the past few days. All thanks to <i>Bucky.</i></p><p>Usually after a light breakfast, Bucky and I would go out for a run before returning back into the tower to do some stretching then start sparring. Conversations come here and there\u2013 sometimes Bucky is silent and I didn\u2019t mind. And sometimes he would talk when he tries teaching me new things. Thanks to Bucky, I\u2019ve learnt to deal with my emotions more\u2013learnt to accept them, and so far I hadn\u2019t had any of those <i>\u2018blackouts\u2019</i> that Bucky has decided to call them whenever my emotions take over my actions.</p><p><i>Oh, don\u2019t get me wrong.</i> The first few days of training with Bucky consisted with the same tense yelling but as time passed, Bucky and I fell into a pattern and I soon figured out to control them as Bucky never took it easy on me, making sure that I still had my emotions in check and was still using my head.</p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019ve gotten soft, Bucky.\u201d I teased, a playful grin on my face as I successfully pin him down on the padded mats. He rolled his eyes before rolling us over with him now on top in one swift move. I let out a huff.</i></p><p><i>He laughed at this and shook his head, pinning my arms down on top of my head, \u201cThink again, Y/N. You always let your guard down, always so smug. You need to stop this.\u201d</i></p><p><i>I scowled upon hearing his words before lifting my head up, aiming towards his arm and sinking my teeth down painfully on his skin. He instantly reacts with a surprised yell and I use the opportunity to break free from his hold, pushing myself up to stand and using the strength of my feet to hold him down by the chest.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWho said I was done, anyway?\u201d I scoffed smugly and all he could do was grin.</i></p><p>Though, I suppose I wouldn\u2019t know if I\u2019d be able to keep my emotions in check when it came to other people. I\u2019ve only gotten used to Bucky\u2013 other people, not so much. I mean, I\u2019ve gotten to know a few of the Avengers so far.</p><p>There\u2019s Steve Rogers\u2013 Captain America, who treats me like a little sister. I\u2019ve grown fond of him lately, as he approaches me from time to time. He treated me almost like how Stephen does; he\u2019s become protective of me even. He\u2019s the only one, <i>at least I\u2019d like to think so,</i> who knew of my trips to the library at night with a particular God\u2013 <i>as he likes to claim himself,</i> I\u2019m not sure if it was true just yet. I have yet to meet his brother who hasn\u2019t returned from a Kree mission, apparently he had wanted to help just as much to find help for me.</p><p>Then there\u2019s Tony Stark\u2013 the Iron Man, who\u2019s suddenly a father figure in my eyes. Protective; always worrying if I\u2019ve settled in okay or if I\u2019m comfortable with my sleeping arrangements. Just like Stephen, worried if I had eaten enough or if I needed anything. Or maybe he was more like a mother, always fussing about every little thing.</p><p>Moving towards Natasha Romanoff\u2013 or Black Widow as she likes to be called, is like a sister I\u2019ve always wished to have. When I\u2019m not outside the comforts of my room, she\u2019d come barging in if she wasn\u2019t busy and from time to time, to pull me out to explore the city\u2013 which trust me, gave Stephen a heart attack. But I\u2019ve loved every moment of it, always savoring the freedom whenever Natasha would take me out on these trips. I had been too confined in the manor for so long that I had forgotten what being really outside felt. Also, she insists that I have feelings for Bucky, almost tormenting me to speak up and tell her something.</p><p><i>Do I have feelings for Bucky? I don\u2019t know.</i></p><p>He\u2019s just there, someone I\u2019ve learnt I could count on\u2013 someone who kept me grounded. He challenged me, constantly. Always wanted me to push myself, always knowing the things to say.</p><p><i>Anyways</i>\u2013 moving on to someone I\u2019ve just met, Doc. Or rather Doctor Bruce Banner, or the most important one to remember\u2013 <i>Hulk</i>. He\u2019d arrived the same day I arrived; apparently to keep an eye out for Loki\u2013 according to Loki himself, he was called by Tony to watch him. This of course, made me curious as to why. No one answers me, at least\u2013 the ones who I\u2019ve asked, such as Loki and Bucky. I had thought of approaching the Doc about it but he seemed standoffish at first\u2013 he was being cautious, I wouldn\u2019t blame him. As he\u2019s learnt to trust me, he told me about Loki and what he\u2019s done\u2013and apparently Loki gets a fright from Doc whenever he was in Hulk form. I would be, too.</p><p>That doesn\u2019t change though. I mean, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that I\u2019ve gone down to the library to spend time with the books and Loki, himself. He\u2019s become a companion. Bucky is someone I could feel comfortable with my emotions, someone like I\u2019ve mentioned\u2013 has kept me grounded. But for Loki, he\u2019s someone I can easily open up to about my feelings, about what I felt of the situation with Stephen and everything that\u2019s happened. And he\u2019s been more than a big help, especially with the whole Kree business.</p><p>I suppose Stephen would probably have a heart attack, die\u2013 get revived to just have a heart attack again if he found out that most of my nights consisted of moments with Loki in the library. It wasn\u2019t as if we were doing anything wrong, it\u2019s just that I\u2019ve found\u2026 <i>comfort in his presence.</i></p><p><i>\u201cY/N? Y/N Strange, get back down to Earth.\u201d</i> Stephen snaps me out of my thoughts from the door, my brows furrowed in confusion. \u201cSteve said you were looking for me and I just got back, what did you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, yeah.\u201d I said with a nod as I remember speaking to Steve earlier about Stephen\u2019s whereabouts. I watch Stephen stride towards me, eventually occupying a seat on the edge of the bed I was seated on. \u201cI just wanted to talk, about mum and dad\u2026\u201d</p><p>Stephen visually stiffens at the mention before he gives me a nod to continue speaking, \u201cBucky\u2013\u201d I get cut off with a groan from Stephen at the mention of Bucky\u2019s name, I arched a brow, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, I guess I\u2019m just not used to having friendships\u2013specifically with a boy. I had hoped you would have either grown closer to Romanoff or the witch.\u201d He shrugged and I rolled my eyes in response.</p><p>\u201cMoving on\u2026\u201d I trailed off as I give him a look indicating that I didn\u2019t want to be interrupted, \u201cBucky\u2013\u201d I repeated and watched his face scrunch up to a look of annoyance, \u201cHe has been helping me control my emotions lately that Master Jia Li constantly reminded me doing so and I\u2019ve been able to channel them more properly thanks to him and he thinks that I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>He raised a brow, \u201cReady for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo know more about my past, to know who my parents are without being so upset. Please, I know the last time I\u2019ve asked I\u2013 I went all crazy but I\u2019m ready now.\u201d I begged, nodding my head vigorously as I looked up at him with pleading eyes.</p><p>I watched his face shift from a worried look to a defeated one before he sighed with a nod. \u201cI don\u2019t know much, Y/N\u2026\u201d he trailed off as he reached out for my hands, his gesture of giving me comfort, \u201cI wasn\u2019t that old when you came to us as a baby and I wasn\u2019t even aware that my father still had contact with his brother. You remember the story about Donna don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Donna was our\u2013<i>your</i> sister that passed away, and it strived you to be a doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s <i>our </i>sister. You\u2019re still my sister, <i>nothing </i>will change that.\u201d he said sternly before speaking once more, \u201cWell mother and father had been devastated, broke them. It wasn\u2019t until you arrived, just a year old\u2013 that our parents have found the will to live again. You were everything to them.\u201d He said, giving a gentle squeeze to my hand. \u201cI never had the chance to ask them about your father but all I remember that night that he was panicking, mumbling something about Kree and handing you over to mother before fleeing. He looked scared, he didn\u2019t want to leave you\u2026\u201d</p><p>I scoffed, tears forming in the corners of my mouth. \u201cBut he did and I still don\u2019t know anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N\u2026\u201d</p><p>I let out a sigh before shaking my head as I flash Stephen a small reassuring smile, giving his own hand a squeeze. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I just, I wish I knew more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we will. I\u2019m doing the best I can to find answers and Thor is as well, I\u2019m sure he will return shortly with answers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight\u2026\u201d I mumbled before pulling my hand away from his, \u201cCan I be left alone for a while? I just want the time to myself\u2026\u201d</p><p>I watched Stephen respond with an understanding nod before retreating out of the room. As soon as the door shut behind him, I let out a frustrated sigh and plopped myself back down onto the bed.</p><hr><p>I had spent most of my afternoon in the comforts of my room, avoiding Stephen\u2013 and that included Bucky. It wasn\u2019t my intention but honestly, I just wanted to be left alone. I was frustrated, not at Stephen for his vague answers but with the lack of information about my parents\u2013 <i>my real parents.</i></p><p>I had refused to leave the room when Bucky knocked and said it was time to eat some dinner, refused to speak a word to anyone as I try to put the pieces together from certain dreams that I was having. But the dreams were just as vague as Stephen\u2019s answers about my parents, always having missing pieces along the way and waking up sweating and screaming was something I hated. Thankfully, no one has heard my night terrors as much.</p><p>I glanced over at the digital clock and the red lights were blaring that it was almost ten. <i>That\u2019s right,</i> I\u2019ve spent the whole day after my talk with Stephen locked up in this room. Pacing, staring at the ceiling and walls. Somehow, the thought of the library pops into my head and my feet didn\u2019t make any protests as I began my journey, avoiding getting seen by certain avengers that were still awake and roaming around.</p><p>As I reached the library, he was already there. Lounging on the sofa that we\u2019ve claimed to occupy every night for the past few days, with a book in his hands.</p><p>\u201cI was beginning to think you\u2019d be avoiding me tonight as well, Y/N.\u201d he mused, not lifting his gaze from his book as I approached him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you talking about?\u201d I asked as I sat on the other edge of the sofa, slipping my slippers off to bring my feet up on the couch, pulling my legs close to my chest as I face him.</p><p>He took awhile to respond after he flips a page, taking a minute to read the entry before shutting the book and placing it down on the coffee table. Turning his attention on me, I raised a brow in curiosity. \u201cYou\u2019ve been avoiding your soldier, he\u2019s mentioned it to the captain a couple of times like a sick puppy in love.\u201d He drawled, the corner of his mouth twitching. \u201cI\u2019ve heard from the shadows that you\u2019ve been cooped up in your room since this afternoon, and I had drawn up an assumption that you will not be showing up tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m here aren\u2019t I? So that\u2019s that.\u201d I said, almost in an irritated tone and all he could do was raise a brow. I rolled my eyes at him and shifted my position. Grabbing the book that I was reading last night from the coffee table, I leaned back against the sofa and began reading. No longer listening to Loki as he speaks in the background.</p><p>\u201cStubborn little witch.\u201d He muttered underneath his breath before grabbing the book he was reading moments before I had entered and interrupted him and began reading again once more. And we continued reading in silence, neither of us bothering to speak a word to each other\u2013 even if I was practically itching to do so.</p><hr><p><i>I was practically gasping for air as I ran through the woods, my feet stumbling a little because of the broken branches along my way. My feet taking me far away as fast as I could, my heart beating rapidly against my chest.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou can\u2019t run away from us thorns!\u201d a voice laughed from behind me.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThere\u2019s nowhere to hide thorns, we can find you. We can smell your fear.\u201d</i></p><p><i>I held back the urge to scream at them as I continued to run, my legs feeling weak.</i></p><p><i>Silence.</i></p><p><i>I suddenly felt comfort at the thought that maybe I had lost them but not taking any chances, my feet continued despite my legs feeling like jelly. Glancing back over my shoulder, a sigh of relief leaves my lips. No one was there.</i></p><p><i>Oh how I regret it now.</i></p><p><i>Because the second that I turned my attention back up ahead, there she was. I didn\u2019t know who she was, but I had a feeling that she was Kree. I stop dead in my tracks as the blue skinned woman stopped a few feet away from me, her face unreadable.</i></p><p><i>Then everything went by fast as she levitated two silver orbs with her fingers, a smirk already forming on her lips.</i></p><p><i>And before I knew it\u2013the levitated orbs zoomed across the small gap between us, towards my direction.</i></p><p><i>I couldn\u2019t comprehend what was happening but as I looked down to where she had sent the silver orbs zooming across. My eyes widening at the sight.</i></p><p><i>It went right through my chest, blood already seeping through.</i></p><p><i>And then everything went <b>black</b>.</i></p><hr><p><i>\u201cY/N! Wake up!\u201d</i></p><p>I gasp as I jolt up to sit, panting heavily as I feel myself drenched in sweat. My gaze was blurry and it took awhile before I could regain proper sight and when I did, it fell upon Loki, his face scrunched up in concern. \u201cI\u2013I\u2026\u201d I stuttered in between breaths, feeling Loki\u2019s cold hand brush against my own, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d I asked breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cYou fell asleep and then suddenly you were screaming.\u201d He whispered as he laces his fingers with mine, \u201cI had been trying to wake you up but I couldn\u2019t for the past couple of minutes, gave me a scare.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t fully understand what he was saying but all I could do is nod and before you know it, my lips parted and I let out a cry of distraught. I felt his cold hands pull away from mine and I almost wanted to grab them back but instead, he wrapped me in his arms and pulled me close against his chest, his fingers now combing through my hair. The emotions that I have been bottling up in my chest the whole afternoon taking over, not bothering Loki\u2019s actions.</p><p>\u201cRelax, Y/N\u2026\u201d I heard him whisper.</p><p>It took a moment before I could regain composure and when I did, the comfort being in Loki\u2019s arms doesn\u2019t throw me off but instead I leaned myself in closer, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>I feel his arm wrap around my waist to hold me tight as he spoke, \u201cNo, don\u2019t be sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just everything with Stephen going rocky because of what he kept from me and me being frustrated because apparently I know nothing about my real heritage is just really getting to me.

Every morning I\u2019d wake up at exactly six in the morning and then get ready for the day\u2013 and somehow, every morning felt better. As every morning came, I felt less dread to get out of bed.</p><p>After getting out of bed, I\u2019m instantly greeted by Bucky who shows up at my door by seven and joins me for breakfast. Stephen on the other hand wasn\u2019t all too thrilled that I had male company besides him, he\u2019d probably get even more furious if he knew it wasn\u2019t just Bucky I had for company. Stephen joins Bucky and I for breakfast most of the time\u2013 sometimes he isn\u2019t in the tower but whenever I\u2019d ask, he would just tell me it wasn\u2019t for me to worry. I\u2019d shrug it off, not wanting to get any negativity to ruin the positive mood that I\u2019ve grown accustomed to the past few days. All thanks to <i>Bucky.</i></p><p>Usually after a light breakfast, Bucky and I would go out for a run before returning back into the tower to do some stretching then start sparring. Conversations come here and there\u2013 sometimes Bucky is silent and I didn\u2019t mind. And sometimes he would talk when he tries teaching me new things. Thanks to Bucky, I\u2019ve learnt to deal with my emotions more\u2013learnt to accept them, and so far I hadn\u2019t had any of those <i>\u2018blackouts\u2019</i> that Bucky has decided to call them whenever my emotions take over my actions.</p><p><i>Oh, don\u2019t get me wrong.</i> The first few days of training with Bucky consisted with the same tense yelling but as time passed, Bucky and I fell into a pattern and I soon figured out to control them as Bucky never took it easy on me, making sure that I still had my emotions in check and was still using my head.</p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019ve gotten soft, Bucky.\u201d I teased, a playful grin on my face as I successfully pin him down on the padded mats. He rolled his eyes before rolling us over with him now on top in one swift move. I let out a huff.</i></p><p><i>He laughed at this and shook his head, pinning my arms down on top of my head, \u201cThink again, Y/N. You always let your guard down, always so smug. You need to stop this.\u201d</i></p><p><i>I scowled upon hearing his words before lifting my head up, aiming towards his arm and sinking my teeth down painfully on his skin. He instantly reacts with a surprised yell and I use the opportunity to break free from his hold, pushing myself up to stand and using the strength of my feet to hold him down by the chest.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWho said I was done, anyway?\u201d I scoffed smugly and all he could do was grin.</i></p><p>Though, I suppose I wouldn\u2019t know if I\u2019d be able to keep my emotions in check when it came to other people. I\u2019ve only gotten used to Bucky\u2013 other people, not so much. I mean, I\u2019ve gotten to know a few of the Avengers so far.</p><p>There\u2019s Steve Rogers\u2013 Captain America, who treats me like a little sister. I\u2019ve grown fond of him lately, as he approaches me from time to time. He treated me almost like how Stephen does; he\u2019s become protective of me even. He\u2019s the only one, <i>at least I\u2019d like to think so,</i> who knew of my trips to the library at night with a particular God\u2013 <i>as he likes to claim himself,</i> I\u2019m not sure if it was true just yet. I have yet to meet his brother who hasn\u2019t returned from a Kree mission, apparently he had wanted to help just as much to find help for me.</p><p>Then there\u2019s Tony Stark\u2013 the Iron Man, who\u2019s suddenly a father figure in my eyes. Protective; always worrying if I\u2019ve settled in okay or if I\u2019m comfortable with my sleeping arrangements. Just like Stephen, worried if I had eaten enough or if I needed anything. Or maybe he was more like a mother, always fussing about every little thing.</p><p>Moving towards Natasha Romanoff\u2013 or Black Widow as she likes to be called, is like a sister I\u2019ve always wished to have. When I\u2019m not outside the comforts of my room, she\u2019d come barging in if she wasn\u2019t busy and from time to time, to pull me out to explore the city\u2013 which trust me, gave Stephen a heart attack. But I\u2019ve loved every moment of it, always savoring the freedom whenever Natasha would take me out on these trips. I had been too confined in the manor for so long that I had forgotten what being really outside felt. Also, she insists that I have feelings for Bucky, almost tormenting me to speak up and tell her something.</p><p><i>Do I have feelings for Bucky? I don\u2019t know.</i></p><p>He\u2019s just there, someone I\u2019ve learnt I could count on\u2013 someone who kept me grounded. He challenged me, constantly. Always wanted me to push myself, always knowing the things to say.</p><p><i>Anyways</i>\u2013 moving on to someone I\u2019ve just met, Doc. Or rather Doctor Bruce Banner, or the most important one to remember\u2013 <i>Hulk</i>. He\u2019d arrived the same day I arrived; apparently to keep an eye out for Loki\u2013 according to Loki himself, he was called by Tony to watch him. This of course, made me curious as to why. No one answers me, at least\u2013 the ones who I\u2019ve asked, such as Loki and Bucky. I had thought of approaching the Doc about it but he seemed standoffish at first\u2013 he was being cautious, I wouldn\u2019t blame him. As he\u2019s learnt to trust me, he told me about Loki and what he\u2019s done\u2013and apparently Loki gets a fright from Doc whenever he was in Hulk form. I would be, too.</p><p>That doesn\u2019t change though. I mean, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that I\u2019ve gone down to the library to spend time with the books and Loki, himself. He\u2019s become a companion. Bucky is someone I could feel comfortable with my emotions, someone like I\u2019ve mentioned\u2013 has kept me grounded. But for Loki, he\u2019s someone I can easily open up to about my feelings, about what I felt of the situation with Stephen and everything that\u2019s happened. And he\u2019s been more than a big help, especially with the whole Kree business.</p><p>I suppose Stephen would probably have a heart attack, die\u2013 get revived to just have a heart attack again if he found out that most of my nights consisted of moments with Loki in the library. It wasn\u2019t as if we were doing anything wrong, it\u2019s just that I\u2019ve found\u2026 <i>comfort in his presence.</i></p><p><i>\u201cY/N? Y/N Strange, get back down to Earth.\u201d</i> Stephen snaps me out of my thoughts from the door, my brows furrowed in confusion. \u201cSteve said you were looking for me and I just got back, what did you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, yeah.\u201d I said with a nod as I remember speaking to Steve earlier about Stephen\u2019s whereabouts. I watch Stephen stride towards me, eventually occupying a seat on the edge of the bed I was seated on. \u201cI just wanted to talk, about mum and dad\u2026\u201d</p><p>Stephen visually stiffens at the mention before he gives me a nod to continue speaking, \u201cBucky\u2013\u201d I get cut off with a groan from Stephen at the mention of Bucky\u2019s name, I arched a brow, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, I guess I\u2019m just not used to having friendships\u2013specifically with a boy. I had hoped you would have either grown closer to Romanoff or the witch.\u201d He shrugged and I rolled my eyes in response.</p><p>\u201cMoving on\u2026\u201d I trailed off as I give him a look indicating that I didn\u2019t want to be interrupted, \u201cBucky\u2013\u201d I repeated and watched his face scrunch up to a look of annoyance, \u201cHe has been helping me control my emotions lately that Master Jia Li constantly reminded me doing so and I\u2019ve been able to channel them more properly thanks to him and he thinks that I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>He raised a brow, \u201cReady for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo know more about my past, to know who my parents are without being so upset. Please, I know the last time I\u2019ve asked I\u2013 I went all crazy but I\u2019m ready now.\u201d I begged, nodding my head vigorously as I looked up at him with pleading eyes.</p><p>I watched his face shift from a worried look to a defeated one before he sighed with a nod. \u201cI don\u2019t know much, Y/N\u2026\u201d he trailed off as he reached out for my hands, his gesture of giving me comfort, \u201cI wasn\u2019t that old when you came to us as a baby and I wasn\u2019t even aware that my father still had contact with his brother. You remember the story about Donna don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Donna was our\u2013<i>your</i> sister that passed away, and it strived you to be a doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s <i>our </i>sister. You\u2019re still my sister, <i>nothing </i>will change that.\u201d he said sternly before speaking once more, \u201cWell mother and father had been devastated, broke them. It wasn\u2019t until you arrived, just a year old\u2013 that our parents have found the will to live again. You were everything to them.\u201d He said, giving a gentle squeeze to my hand. \u201cI never had the chance to ask them about your father but all I remember that night that he was panicking, mumbling something about Kree and handing you over to mother before fleeing. He looked scared, he didn\u2019t want to leave you\u2026\u201d</p><p>I scoffed, tears forming in the corners of my mouth. \u201cBut he did and I still don\u2019t know anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N\u2026\u201d</p><p>I let out a sigh before shaking my head as I flash Stephen a small reassuring smile, giving his own hand a squeeze. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I just, I wish I knew more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we will. I\u2019m doing the best I can to find answers and Thor is as well, I\u2019m sure he will return shortly with answers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight\u2026\u201d I mumbled before pulling my hand away from his, \u201cCan I be left alone for a while? I just want the time to myself\u2026\u201d</p><p>I watched Stephen respond with an understanding nod before retreating out of the room. As soon as the door shut behind him, I let out a frustrated sigh and plopped myself back down onto the bed.</p><hr><p>I had spent most of my afternoon in the comforts of my room, avoiding Stephen\u2013 and that included Bucky. It wasn\u2019t my intention but honestly, I just wanted to be left alone. I was frustrated, not at Stephen for his vague answers but with the lack of information about my parents\u2013 <i>my real parents.</i></p><p>I had refused to leave the room when Bucky knocked and said it was time to eat some dinner, refused to speak a word to anyone as I try to put the pieces together from certain dreams that I was having. But the dreams were just as vague as Stephen\u2019s answers about my parents, always having missing pieces along the way and waking up sweating and screaming was something I hated. Thankfully, no one has heard my night terrors as much.</p><p>I glanced over at the digital clock and the red lights were blaring that it was almost ten. <i>That\u2019s right,</i> I\u2019ve spent the whole day after my talk with Stephen locked up in this room. Pacing, staring at the ceiling and walls. Somehow, the thought of the library pops into my head and my feet didn\u2019t make any protests as I began my journey, avoiding getting seen by certain avengers that were still awake and roaming around.</p><p>As I reached the library, he was already there. Lounging on the sofa that we\u2019ve claimed to occupy every night for the past few days, with a book in his hands.</p><p>\u201cI was beginning to think you\u2019d be avoiding me tonight as well, Y/N.\u201d he mused, not lifting his gaze from his book as I approached him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you talking about?\u201d I asked as I sat on the other edge of the sofa, slipping my slippers off to bring my feet up on the couch, pulling my legs close to my chest as I face him.</p><p>He took awhile to respond after he flips a page, taking a minute to read the entry before shutting the book and placing it down on the coffee table. Turning his attention on me, I raised a brow in curiosity. \u201cYou\u2019ve been avoiding your soldier, he\u2019s mentioned it to the captain a couple of times like a sick puppy in love.\u201d He drawled, the corner of his mouth twitching. \u201cI\u2019ve heard from the shadows that you\u2019ve been cooped up in your room since this afternoon, and I had drawn up an assumption that you will not be showing up tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m here aren\u2019t I? So that\u2019s that.\u201d I said, almost in an irritated tone and all he could do was raise a brow. I rolled my eyes at him and shifted my position. Grabbing the book that I was reading last night from the coffee table, I leaned back against the sofa and began reading. No longer listening to Loki as he speaks in the background.</p><p>\u201cStubborn little witch.\u201d He muttered underneath his breath before grabbing the book he was reading moments before I had entered and interrupted him and began reading again once more. And we continued reading in silence, neither of us bothering to speak a word to each other\u2013 even if I was practically itching to do so.</p><hr><p><i>I was practically gasping for air as I ran through the woods, my feet stumbling a little because of the broken branches along my way. My feet taking me far away as fast as I could, my heart beating rapidly against my chest.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou can\u2019t run away from us thorns!\u201d a voice laughed from behind me.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThere\u2019s nowhere to hide thorns, we can find you. We can smell your fear.\u201d</i></p><p><i>I held back the urge to scream at them as I continued to run, my legs feeling weak.</i></p><p><i>Silence.</i></p><p><i>I suddenly felt comfort at the thought that maybe I had lost them but not taking any chances, my feet continued despite my legs feeling like jelly. Glancing back over my shoulder, a sigh of relief leaves my lips. No one was there.</i></p><p><i>Oh how I regret it now.</i></p><p><i>Because the second that I turned my attention back up ahead, there she was. I didn\u2019t know who she was, but I had a feeling that she was Kree. I stop dead in my tracks as the blue skinned woman stopped a few feet away from me, her face unreadable.</i></p><p><i>Then everything went by fast as she levitated two silver orbs with her fingers, a smirk already forming on her lips.</i></p><p><i>And before I knew it\u2013the levitated orbs zoomed across the small gap between us, towards my direction.</i></p><p><i>I couldn\u2019t comprehend what was happening but as I looked down to where she had sent the silver orbs zooming across. My eyes widening at the sight.</i></p><p><i>It went right through my chest, blood already seeping through.</i></p><p><i>And then everything went <b>black</b>.</i></p><hr><p><i>\u201cY/N! Wake up!\u201d</i></p><p>I gasp as I jolt up to sit, panting heavily as I feel myself drenched in sweat. My gaze was blurry and it took awhile before I could regain proper sight and when I did, it fell upon Loki, his face scrunched up in concern. \u201cI\u2013I\u2026\u201d I stuttered in between breaths, feeling Loki\u2019s cold hand brush against my own, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d I asked breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cYou fell asleep and then suddenly you were screaming.\u201d He whispered as he laces his fingers with mine, \u201cI had been trying to wake you up but I couldn\u2019t for the past couple of minutes, gave me a scare.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t fully understand what he was saying but all I could do is nod and before you know it, my lips parted and I let out a cry of distraught. I felt his cold hands pull away from mine and I almost wanted to grab them back but instead, he wrapped me in his arms and pulled me close against his chest, his fingers now combing through my hair. The emotions that I have been bottling up in my chest the whole afternoon taking over, not bothering Loki\u2019s actions.</p><p>\u201cRelax, Y/N\u2026\u201d I heard him whisper.</p><p>It took a moment before I could regain composure and when I did, the comfort being in Loki\u2019s arms doesn\u2019t throw me off but instead I leaned myself in closer, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>I feel his arm wrap around my waist to hold me tight as he spoke, \u201cNo, don\u2019t be sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just everything with Stephen going rocky because of what he kept from me and me being frustrated because apparently I know nothing about my real heritage is just really getting to me. Sometimes I wish, everyone would be better off, even me\u2013 if Stephen had let me perish when Kaecillius had attacked me back then\u2026\u201d I muttered underneath my breath, playing with my fingers. \u201cI would have probably died peacefully knowing the parents I had grown to love was really my parents and that none of this was real\u2026\u201d</p><p>I felt Loki stiffen from beneath me and then he shifts to sit up straight, the fingers that were combing through my hair gone and now was brushing against my arm. \u201cI doubt that.\u201d My face scrunches up in confusion upon his words, pushing myself up to sit\u2013I look up at him. \u201cThen I wouldn\u2019t have met you, someone I\u2019ve come to care about\u2013 someone I can trust, someone who doesn\u2019t look at me differently despite of the awful things I\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>My heart was screaming, what was this feeling? I felt my heart pumping at a rapid rate as I stare back into Loki\u2019s gaze, my mouth parted to speak but couldn\u2019t find the right words to say and before I knew it\u2013</p><p><i>His lips have met mine.</i></p><hr><p><b><i>TTTAGGED: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_3melGmsW9rPiRnApzszcA\">@alessia\u2013winchester</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpj0O9f5F11r6rnLdRoKWOA\">@totobyafricaa</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYkscGeS8JxzsZo-2Cf-TJA\">@wipplog</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mL6Mv773_-xCttASKkyqG4g\">@theladyofmanyfandomsofficial</a>\u00a0</i></b></p></p>",

No one answers me, at least&ndash; the ones who I&rsquo;ve asked, such as Loki and Bucky. I had thought of approaching the Doc about it but he seemed standoffish at first&ndash; he was being cautious, I wouldn&rsquo;t blame him. As he&rsquo;s learnt to trust me, he told me about Loki and what he&rsquo;s done&ndash;and apparently Loki gets a fright from Doc whenever he was in Hulk form. I would be, too.</p><p>That doesn&rsquo;t change though. I mean, it doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that I&rsquo;ve gone down to the library to spend time with the books and Loki, himself. He&rsquo;s become a companion. Bucky is someone I could feel comfortable with my emotions, someone like I&rsquo;ve mentioned&ndash; has kept me grounded. But for Loki, he&rsquo;s someone I can easily open up to about my feelings, about what I felt of the situation with Stephen and everything that&rsquo;s happened. And he&rsquo;s been more than a big help, especially with the whole Kree business.</p><p>I suppose Stephen would probably have a heart attack, die&ndash; get revived to just have a heart attack again if he found out that most of my nights consisted of moments with Loki in the library. It wasn&rsquo;t as if we were doing anything wrong, it&rsquo;s just that I&rsquo;ve found&hellip; <i>comfort in his presence.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Y/N? Y/N Strange, get back down to Earth.&rdquo;</i> Stephen snaps me out of my thoughts from the door, my brows furrowed in confusion. &ldquo;Steve said you were looking for me and I just got back, what did you need?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right, yeah.&rdquo; I said with a nod as I remember speaking to Steve earlier about Stephen&rsquo;s whereabouts. I watch Stephen stride towards me, eventually occupying a seat on the edge of the bed I was seated on. &ldquo;I just wanted to talk, about mum and dad&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen visually stiffens at the mention before he gives me a nod to continue speaking, &ldquo;Bucky&ndash;&rdquo; I get cut off with a groan from Stephen at the mention of Bucky&rsquo;s name, I arched a brow, &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing, I guess I&rsquo;m just not used to having friendships&ndash;specifically with a boy. I had hoped you would have either grown closer to Romanoff or the witch.&rdquo; He shrugged and I rolled my eyes in response.</p><p>&ldquo;Moving on&hellip;&rdquo; I trailed off as I give him a look indicating that I didn&rsquo;t want to be interrupted, &ldquo;Bucky&ndash;&rdquo; I repeated and watched his face scrunch up to a look of annoyance, &ldquo;He has been helping me control my emotions lately that Master Jia Li constantly reminded me doing so and I&rsquo;ve been able to channel them more properly thanks to him and he thinks that I&rsquo;m ready.&rdquo;</p><p>He raised a brow, &ldquo;Ready for what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To know more about my past, to know who my parents are without being so upset. Please, I know the last time I&rsquo;ve asked I&ndash; I went all crazy but I&rsquo;m ready now.&rdquo; I begged, nodding my head vigorously as I looked up at him with pleading eyes.</p><p>I watched his face shift from a worried look to a defeated one before he sighed with a nod. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know much, Y/N&hellip;&rdquo; he trailed off as he reached out for my hands, his gesture of giving me comfort, &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t that old when you came to us as a baby and I wasn&rsquo;t even aware that my father still had contact with his brother. You remember the story about Donna don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, Donna was our&ndash;<i>your</i> sister that passed away, and it strived you to be a doctor.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s <i>our </i>sister. You&rsquo;re still my sister, <i>nothing </i>will change that.&rdquo; he said sternly before speaking once more, &ldquo;Well mother and father had been devastated, broke them. It wasn&rsquo;t until you arrived, just a year old&ndash; that our parents have found the will to live again. You were everything to them.&rdquo; He said, giving a gentle squeeze to my hand. &ldquo;I never had the chance to ask them about your father but all I remember that night that he was panicking, mumbling something about Kree and handing you over to mother before fleeing. He looked scared, he didn&rsquo;t want to leave you&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>I scoffed, tears forming in the corners of my mouth. &ldquo;But he did and I still don&rsquo;t know anything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>I let out a sigh before shaking my head as I flash Stephen a small reassuring smile, giving his own hand a squeeze. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine. I just, I wish I knew more.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And we will. I&rsquo;m doing the best I can to find answers and Thor is as well, I&rsquo;m sure he will return shortly with answers.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right&hellip;&rdquo; I mumbled before pulling my hand away from his, &ldquo;Can I be left alone for a while? I just want the time to myself&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>I watched Stephen respond with an understanding nod before retreating out of the room. As soon as the door shut behind him, I let out a frustrated sigh and plopped myself back down onto the bed.</p><hr /><p>I had spent most of my afternoon in the comforts of my room, avoiding Stephen&ndash; and that included Bucky. It wasn&rsquo;t my intention but honestly, I just wanted to be left alone. I was frustrated, not at Stephen for his vague answers but with the lack of information about my parents&ndash; <i>my real parents.</i></p><p>I had refused to leave the room when Bucky knocked and said it was time to eat some dinner, refused to speak a word to anyone as I try to put the pieces together from certain dreams that I was having. But the dreams were just as vague as Stephen&rsquo;s answers about my parents, always having missing pieces along the way and waking up sweating and screaming was something I hated. Thankfully, no one has heard my night terrors as much.</p><p>I glanced over at the digital clock and the red lights were blaring that it was almost ten. <i>That&rsquo;s right,</i> I&rsquo;ve spent the whole day after my talk with Stephen locked up in this room. Pacing, staring at the ceiling and walls. Somehow, the thought of the library pops into my head and my feet didn&rsquo;t make any protests as I began my journey, avoiding getting seen by certain avengers that were still awake and roaming around.</p><p>As I reached the library, he was already there. Lounging on the sofa that we&rsquo;ve claimed to occupy every night for the past few days, with a book in his hands.</p><p>&ldquo;I was beginning to think you&rsquo;d be avoiding me tonight as well, Y/N.&rdquo; he mused, not lifting his gaze from his book as I approached him.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;re you talking about?&rdquo; I asked as I sat on the other edge of the sofa, slipping my slippers off to bring my feet up on the couch, pulling my legs close to my chest as I face him.</p><p>He took awhile to respond after he flips a page, taking a minute to read the entry before shutting the book and placing it down on the coffee table. Turning his attention on me, I raised a brow in curiosity. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been avoiding your soldier, he&rsquo;s mentioned it to the captain a couple of times like a sick puppy in love.&rdquo; He drawled, the corner of his mouth twitching. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard from the shadows that you&rsquo;ve been cooped up in your room since this afternoon, and I had drawn up an assumption that you will not be showing up tonight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m here aren&rsquo;t I? So that&rsquo;s that.&rdquo; I said, almost in an irritated tone and all he could do was raise a brow. I rolled my eyes at him and shifted my position. Grabbing the book that I was reading last night from the coffee table, I leaned back against the sofa and began reading. No longer listening to Loki as he speaks in the background.</p><p>&ldquo;Stubborn little witch.&rdquo; He muttered underneath his breath before grabbing the book he was reading moments before I had entered and interrupted him and began reading again once more. And we continued reading in silence, neither of us bothering to speak a word to each other&ndash; even if I was practically itching to do so.</p><hr /><p><i>I was practically gasping for air as I ran through the woods, my feet stumbling a little because of the broken branches along my way. My feet taking me far away as fast as I could, my heart beating rapidly against my chest.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t run away from us thorns!&rdquo; a voice laughed from behind me.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nowhere to hide thorns, we can find you. We can smell your fear.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>I held back the urge to scream at them as I continued to run, my legs feeling weak.</i></p><p><i>Silence.</i></p><p><i>I suddenly felt comfort at the thought that maybe I had lost them but not taking any chances, my feet continued despite my legs feeling like jelly. Glancing back over my shoulder, a sigh of relief leaves my lips. No one was there.</i></p><p><i>Oh how I regret it now.</i></p><p><i>Because the second that I turned my attention back up ahead, there she was. I didn&rsquo;t know who she was, but I had a feeling that she was Kree. I stop dead in my tracks as the blue skinned woman stopped a few feet away from me, her face unreadable.</i></p><p><i>Then everything went by fast as she levitated two silver orbs with her fingers, a smirk already forming on her lips.</i></p><p><i>And before I knew it&ndash;the levitated orbs zoomed across the small gap between us, towards my direction.</i></p><p><i>I couldn&rsquo;t comprehend what was happening but as I looked down to where she had sent the silver orbs zooming across. My eyes widening at the sight.</i></p><p><i>It went right through my chest, blood already seeping through.</i></p><p><i>And then everything went <b>black</b>.</i></p><hr /><p><i>&ldquo;Y/N! Wake up!&rdquo;</i></p><p>I gasp as I jolt up to sit, panting heavily as I feel myself drenched in sweat. My gaze was blurry and it took awhile before I could regain proper sight and when I did, it fell upon Loki, his face scrunched up in concern. &ldquo;I&ndash;I&hellip;&rdquo; I stuttered in between breaths, feeling Loki&rsquo;s cold hand brush against my own, &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; I asked breathlessly.</p><p>&ldquo;You fell asleep and then suddenly you were screaming.&rdquo; He whispered as he laces his fingers with mine, &ldquo;I had been trying to wake you up but I couldn&rsquo;t for the past couple of minutes, gave me a scare.&rdquo;</p><p>I couldn&rsquo;t fully understand what he was saying but all I could do is nod and before you know it, my lips parted and I let out a cry of distraught. I felt his cold hands pull away from mine and I almost wanted to grab them back but instead, he wrapped me in his arms and pulled me close against his chest, his fingers now combing through my hair. The emotions that I have been bottling up in my chest the whole afternoon taking over, not bothering Loki&rsquo;s actions.</p><p>&ldquo;Relax, Y/N&hellip;&rdquo; I heard him whisper.</p><p>It took a moment before I could regain composure and when I did, the comfort being in Loki&rsquo;s arms doesn&rsquo;t throw me off but instead I leaned myself in closer, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>I feel his arm wrap around my waist to hold me tight as he spoke, &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t be sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just everything with Stephen going rocky because of what he kept from me and me being frustrated because apparently I know nothing about my real heritage is just really getting to me. Sometimes I wish, everyone would be better off, even me&ndash; if Stephen had let me perish when Kaecillius had attacked me back then&hellip;&rdquo; I muttered underneath my breath, playing with my fingers. &ldquo;I would have probably died peacefully knowing the parents I had grown to love was really my parents and that none of this was real&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>I felt Loki stiffen from beneath me and then he shifts to sit up straight, the fingers that were combing through my hair gone and now was brushing against my arm. &ldquo;I doubt that.&rdquo; My face scrunches up in confusion upon his words, pushing myself up to sit&ndash;I look up at him. &ldquo;Then I wouldn&rsquo;t have met you, someone I&rsquo;ve come to care about&ndash; someone I can trust, someone who doesn&rsquo;t look at me differently despite of the awful things I&rsquo;ve done.&rdquo;</p><p>My heart was screaming, what was this feeling? I felt my heart pumping at a rapid rate as I stare back into Loki&rsquo;s gaze, my mouth parted to speak but couldn&rsquo;t find the right words to say and before I knew it&ndash;</p><p><i>His lips have met mine.</i></p><hr /><p><b><i>TTTAGGED: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_3melGmsW9rPiRnApzszcA\">@alessia&ndash;winchester</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpj0O9f5F11r6rnLdRoKWOA\">@totobyafricaa</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYkscGeS8JxzsZo-2Cf-TJA\">@wipplog</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mL6Mv773_-xCttASKkyqG4g\">@theladyofmanyfandomsofficial</a>&nbsp;</i></b></p></p>",
