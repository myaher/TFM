Apparently in his head the perfect opposite to the hallmark mushiness of the holliday was a horror movie. </p><p>Not that she would ever admit to it, but Beau hated horror movies almost as much as she hated Valentine\u2019s Day . Well not all horror, it\u2019s just she never feels compelled to care for the characters, and then she\u2019s just being scared for no reason. Well not scared, Beau doesn\u2019t experience fear. And it\u2019s not like she gets scared in real life easy. She\u2019s not a pansy ass little bitch, no sir. But horror movies use special effects, and lighting, and erie music, and suspense that makes things, like, extra spooky. Plus she can\u2019t react like she normally would when watching a movie at home. At a theater she has to sit still and stay quiet. She\u2019d rather be at home where she could perch on her seat when things got intense, or where she could make comments to Caleb and slap at Molly\u2019s arm. So most of the time she\u2019d prefer a nice action movie with lots of punching and guns and car chases. </p><p>But there she was, sitting in between Caleb and Molly. Both of whom had a morbid fascination with the happenings of the film. The little boy on the screen took a pair of scissors and sharpened them while making thinly veiled threats to his mom. Beau already had to watch the little shithead kill the dog, and she was not here for him killing the milf.</p><p>\u201cI gotta go pee.\u201d She said gruffly, stealing some popcorn from Molly, who swatted lightly at her hand. </p><p>\u201cAlright, go now before the plot picks up, ja.\u201d Caleb said absently, eyes fixed on the screen, hand playing with the fabric of his coat. </p><p>Beau quickly made her way out of the room. After looking around in the colorful hallways she made her way to the bathroom. That way if Molly called her out later she wouldn\u2019t technicality be lying. As she sat on the toilet Beau whipped out her phone and looked up a synopsis of the movie. It was kinda hard to find the big plot reveals cause the movie had just come out. There was nothing on the Wikipedia or IMDB. Eventually she found a review that spilled all the plot points. Apparently the little boy was sharing his body (and was not possessed) with the soul of a serial killer. The type of man who took advantage of women and the legal system that doesn\u2019t care about violent aggressions against women. But, like, the movie wasn\u2019t even a critique on that. It was more just jerking off to the idea of a sexy cereal killer. It sickened her. </p><p>Beau left the bathroom making her way back toward the movie she had left. She stood at the doorway checking the time. </p><p>\u201cUgh\u201d she sighed. She\u2019d only been gone for about 6 minutes. She was hoping to have missed more. She started amping herself up. The same way she would before a boxing match. She bounced up and down lightly, blowing air out of her lungs, and shaking her hands. </p><p>Rocking back on her heels she whispered \u201cAlright, Beau, you got this.\u201d And just as she was about to barrel her way back to her seat a voice interrupted her</p><p>\u201cPsyching yourself up for the spooky movie?\u201d </p><p>The voice caught her off guard and Beau may have stumbled a little bit. A pair of warm hands steadied her from behind, and then just as suddenly dropped. Beau turned around.</p><p>Standing in front of her was the most beautiful girl Beau had ever seen. Blue skin, blue hair, a wide smile. The girls teeth were pointed, bangs brushed her forehead, and there was a smattering of freckles across her smooth skin. </p><p>\u201cSorry, I don\u2019t mean to scare you!\u201d Her voice had a lilting quality to it \u201cbut you just looked really cute and funny, getting yourself prepared to go back in there.\u201d</p><p>Beau, recognizing that she was being teased, came out of her daze of seeing a pretty girl. A frown tugged at her face as she crossed her arms over her chest.</p><p>\u201cI just didn\u2019t want to interrupt the other movie goers.\u201d She grunted.</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d The girl replied \u201cI don\u2019t think I really want to go back into my movie either. You see I came with my friend Fjord, he\u2019s really cool, and we were gonna watch this suuuuuuer cute love story about a really hunky guy wooing this cute girl, but then while we were watching the ads before the film Fjord ate something weird and started spitting up a whole bunch of water so I had to take him to the bathroom \u2026\u201d </p><p>As the cute girl, as Beau had dubbed her in her head, continued to tell her story Beau let her eyes survey her. She stood just a half a head shorter than Beau, and had a plump frame. A pair of horns curled right above her ears, adorned with ribbons. She was wearing and appropriately themed pink dress with frills and the like. As she talked she moved her hands wildly and seemed to bounce on the balls of her feet. Even if she had just been teasing Beau, there was something quite endearing about the girl.</p><p>\u201c&hellip; yeah, so now I\u2019m just trying to decide if I want to go prank the ticket clerk or switch the signs on the movie goers!\u201d The girl finished talking and stuck out her hand \u201cI\u2019m Jester, by the way\u201d </p><p>Beau slowly pulled her own down from where it was crossed against her chest and took Jesters. \u201cNice to meet you? I\u2019m Beau.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi Beau\u201d their two hands remained locked \u201cso are you going to finish your movie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhhh\u201d Beau stalled for a moment. She really didn\u2019t want to finish the movie, but she also didn\u2019t want Molly to make fun of her. And there was the fact that there was this really pretty girl still holding onto her hand. \u201cI think I\u2019d rather stay out here.\u201d She let here eyes roam up and down the blue girls figure, giving her a small smirk.</p><p>\u201cGreat! Cause there\u2019s this really hard shooter game in the arcade area, and it\u2019s supposed to be easier with two people!\u201d Jester beamed. \u201cWanna join me?\u201d </p><p>\u201cJust give me a sec.\u201d She reluctantly let go of Jester\u2019s hand and pulled her phone out of her back pocket. She sent Molly and Caleb a quick text </p><p>Just met a cute girl in the hallway</p><p>Think I\u2019m gonna stay out here</p><p>\u2026</p><p>Okay</p><p>Have fun ;)</p><p>Ja, what the purple one said</p><p>stay safe</p><p>Beau looked up and Jester was still standing there smiling shyly. Almost like she was unsure now that she had time to think about what she had asked. </p><p>\u201cSorry, I just wanted to let my friends know where I was going.\u201d Beau said.</p><p>Jesters small smile then bloomed into a mischievous grin. She made some comment about how many coins they would need to get, but Beau was distracted when the shorter girl grabbed her hand again and drug her toward the machines. </p><p>Molly definitely made fun of her later for not being able to finish a silly horror movie. But Beau didn\u2019t care because she spent her Valentine\u2019s Day playing stupid arcade games with a stupid cute girl. She even managed to get 7 digits and maybe even a small kiss on the cheek. Not that she would admit to being so mushy. </p>",

A pair of warm hands steadied her from behind, and then just as suddenly dropped. Beau turned around.</p><p>Standing in front of her was the most beautiful girl Beau had ever seen. Blue skin, blue hair, a wide smile. The girls teeth were pointed, bangs brushed her forehead, and there was a smattering of freckles across her smooth skin. </p><p>\u201cSorry, I don\u2019t mean to scare you!\u201d Her voice had a lilting quality to it \u201cbut you just looked really cute and funny, getting yourself prepared to go back in there.\u201d</p><p>Beau, recognizing that she was being teased, came out of her daze of seeing a pretty girl. A frown tugged at her face as she crossed her arms over her chest.</p><p>\u201cI just didn\u2019t want to interrupt the other movie goers.\u201d She grunted.</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d The girl replied \u201cI don\u2019t think I really want to go back into my movie either. You see I came with my friend Fjord, he\u2019s really cool, and we were gonna watch this suuuuuuer cute love story about a really hunky guy wooing this cute girl, but then while we were watching the ads before the film Fjord ate something weird and started spitting up a whole bunch of water so I had to take him to the bathroom \u2026\u201d </p><p>As the cute girl, as Beau had dubbed her in her head, continued to tell her story Beau let her eyes survey her. She stood just a half a head shorter than Beau, and had a plump frame. A pair of horns curled right above her ears, adorned with ribbons. She was wearing and appropriately themed pink dress with frills and the like. As she talked she moved her hands wildly and seemed to bounce on the balls of her feet. Even if she had just been teasing Beau, there was something quite endearing about the girl.</p><p>\u201c\u2026 yeah, so now I\u2019m just trying to decide if I want to go prank the ticket clerk or switch the signs on the movie goers!\u201d The girl finished talking and stuck out her hand \u201cI\u2019m Jester, by the way\u201d </p><p>Beau slowly pulled her own down from where it was crossed against her chest and took Jesters. \u201cNice to meet you? I\u2019m Beau.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi Beau\u201d their two hands remained locked \u201cso are you going to finish your movie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhhh\u201d Beau stalled for a moment. She really didn\u2019t want to finish the movie, but she also didn\u2019t want Molly to make fun of her. And there was the fact that there was this really pretty girl still holding onto her hand. \u201cI think I\u2019d rather stay out here.\u201d She let here eyes roam up and down the blue girls figure, giving her a small smirk.</p><p>\u201cGreat! Cause there\u2019s this really hard shooter game in the arcade area, and it\u2019s supposed to be easier with two people!\u201d Jester beamed. \u201cWanna join me?\u201d </p><p>\u201cJust give me a sec.\u201d She reluctantly let go of Jester\u2019s hand and pulled her phone out of her back pocket. She sent Molly and Caleb a quick text </p><p>Just met a cute girl in the hallway</p><p>Think I\u2019m gonna stay out here</p><p>\u2026</p><p>Okay</p><p>Have fun ;)</p><p>Ja, what the purple one said</p><p>stay safe</p><p>Beau looked up and Jester was still standing there smiling shyly. Almost like she was unsure now that she had time to think about what she had asked. </p><p>\u201cSorry, I just wanted to let my friends know where I was going.\u201d Beau said.</p><p>Jesters small smile then bloomed into a mischievous grin. She made some comment about how many coins they would need to get, but Beau was distracted when the shorter girl grabbed her hand again and drug her toward the machines. </p><p>Molly definitely made fun of her later for not being able to finish a silly horror movie. But Beau didn\u2019t care because she spent her Valentine\u2019s Day playing stupid arcade games with a stupid cute girl. She even managed to get 7 digits and maybe even a small kiss on the cheek. Not that she would admit to being so mushy. </p>",

Beau\u2019s attitude toward horror, and this whole fic in general were inspired by a recent experience I had. For Galentines\u2122\ufe0f day my friends and I went to see the prodigy, and while I did leave to use the bathroom no cute girls invited me to play arcade games with them instead. I hope you enjoy!</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Molly had dragged her and Caleb to this stupid movie. \u201cNone of us are doing anything for Valentine\u2019s Day so I think we should just go do something together instead.\u201d He had explained. Apparently in his head the perfect opposite to the hallmark mushiness of the holliday was a horror movie. </p><p>Not that she would ever admit to it, but Beau hated horror movies almost as much as she hated Valentine\u2019s Day . Well not all horror, it\u2019s just she never feels compelled to care for the characters, and then she\u2019s just being scared for no reason. Well not scared, Beau doesn\u2019t experience fear. And it\u2019s not like she gets scared in real life easy. She\u2019s not a pansy ass little bitch, no sir. But horror movies use special effects, and lighting, and erie music, and suspense that makes things, like, extra spooky. Plus she can\u2019t react like she normally would when watching a movie at home. At a theater she has to sit still and stay quiet. She\u2019d rather be at home where she could perch on her seat when things got intense, or where she could make comments to Caleb and slap at Molly\u2019s arm. So most of the time she\u2019d prefer a nice action movie with lots of punching and guns and car chases. </p><p>But there she was, sitting in between Caleb and Molly. Both of whom had a morbid fascination with the happenings of the film. The little boy on the screen took a pair of scissors and sharpened them while making thinly veiled threats to his mom. Beau already had to watch the little shithead kill the dog, and she was not here for him killing the milf.</p><p>\u201cI gotta go pee.\u201d She said gruffly, stealing some popcorn from Molly, who swatted lightly at her hand. </p><p>\u201cAlright, go now before the plot picks up, ja.\u201d Caleb said absently, eyes fixed on the screen, hand playing with the fabric of his coat. </p><p>Beau quickly made her way out of the room. After looking around in the colorful hallways she made her way to the bathroom. That way if Molly called her out later she wouldn\u2019t technicality be lying. As she sat on the toilet Beau whipped out her phone and looked up a synopsis of the movie. It was kinda hard to find the big plot reveals cause the movie had just come out. There was nothing on the Wikipedia or IMDB. Eventually she found a review that spilled all the plot points. Apparently the little boy was sharing his body (and was not possessed) with the soul of a serial killer. The type of man who took advantage of women and the legal system that doesn\u2019t care about violent aggressions against women. But, like, the movie wasn\u2019t even a critique on that. It was more just jerking off to the idea of a sexy cereal killer. It sickened her. </p><p>Beau left the bathroom making her way back toward the movie she had left. She stood at the doorway checking the time. </p><p>\u201cUgh\u201d she sighed. She\u2019d only been gone for about 6 minutes. She was hoping to have missed more. She started amping herself up. The same way she would before a boxing match. She bounced up and down lightly, blowing air out of her lungs, and shaking her hands. </p><p>Rocking back on her heels she whispered \u201cAlright, Beau, you got this.\u201d And just as she was about to barrel her way back to her seat a voice interrupted her</p><p>\u201cPsyching yourself up for the spooky movie?\u201d </p><p>The voice caught her off guard and Beau may have stumbled a little bit.

Which, admittedly, seems to be my MO as the last fic I posted had child death in it.\u00a0<br/>CW: Suicide attempts and death in this one.\u00a0</p><p>\n\n<b>Back To The Worms Where You Belong<br/></b>No ship, Caduceus Clay and Mollymauk Tealeaf<br/>Critical Role<br/>Rated M<br/>CW WARNING FOR SUICIDE ATTEMPTS AND DEATH-BASED THINGS.</p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17865650\">Here</a> @ AO3\n\n<br/></p><hr><p>By the time that Mollymauk pushed his way through the packed dirt of his frigid grave, he had died four times. The first time, so far away from here in a world of colour and fancy, his will to live and the drive of whatever force had breathed a second chance into his body had him clawing through the fresh, warm dirt until he was gasping for breathe with no words or name to claim as his own. The soil had not been packed well by cat or man. It was soft, and while brown flecks had remained embedded in his teeth and nails for weeks, the effort had not broken skin.</p><!-- more --><p>The second and third times Molly woke up in his grave, the earth was frozen from the northern winter chill. It had frozen so solidly that it did not fill his mouth when he gasped for air and tried to cry out. He couldn\u2019t make it out.</p><p>The fourth time that Molly woke from the dead the winter snow had melted, sinking into the soil that had trapped him months earlier. He woke up feeling damp, with a trickle of water against his ears. The nails that he could not remember scratching and breaking against the frozen dirt pulled and tugged him out into the open air. He wheezed and he wept, scrambling away from the near frozen tomb. He couldn&rsquo;t remember what had scared him so severely, but the crunch of ice under now bruised knees, palms, elbows and bloodied fingers sent his stomach turning and his throat retching up nothing but newly thawed stomach acid in lingering panic.</p><p>Mollymauk came back with no memory each time. The first he had been left with nothing. The second and third found him trapped. The fourth came with panic, a pounding headache, and then a soft voice nearby.</p><p>\u201cI was wondering when you would come out of there. It\u2019s been a few months, but your friends really hoped that you would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere you go, this should warm you up.\u201d The tea cup in Molly\u2019s hands was the first truly warm sensation that he could recall. It seeped in through the crevices of his fingerprints like the coat wrapped around his body couldn\u2019t. The tall man that found him, that had hefted him into a cart and took Molly to the warmth of his home had wrapped the thing around Molly\u2019s body like it mattered. He said something about that coat being Molly\u2019s. \u00a0It rang no bells in Molly\u2019s ears, sounded no alarm. All that it was was not warm enough.</p><p>\u201cMy names Caduceus. Caduceus Clay. \u00a0Do you remember your name?\u201d</p><p>Silence. Molly opened his mouth. Closed it. There was nothing. The emptiness was dizzying.</p><p>\u201cWell that\u2019s no good.\u201d</p><p>The scraping of a chair on the ground broke the silence and, finally sitting, Caduceus nodded, and he smiled. He spoke slowly, like the words themselves took time to carry.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got some friends out there who think you\u2019re dead, but after what they told me&hellip;Well, I\u2019m not really a fan of anyone raising from the dead like you did but I\u2019ll admit, you had me curious, and I needed to make sure. They said your name\u2019s Molly. Can you say Molly for me?\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth again. He tried to speak, and all that passed through his lips was a weak rasp. <i>Molly</i>. \u00a0The sound of it couldn\u2019t find his tongue. The back of his eyes prickled, and he just couldn\u2019t grasp it.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s alright. \u00a0We\u2019ll get you there. Drink that tea, it\u2019ll help.\u201d</p><p>Caduceus smiled with such gentle surety that Molly believed him, and he drank.</p><p>Grief is a funny thing. Sometimes, it creeps up without anyone knowing it\u2019s there at all. It can come out screaming, or sink you deep into a void where nothing moves for miles and miles. Caduceus had seen grief in its many forms. He had seen it in the living, the dying, and the dead. The dead, he\u2019s found, grieve in stunned silence more often than not. They grieve viscerally, because they are in all senses of the word no longer attached. For his whole life Caduceus had worked with death and its griefs, and for five days Caduceus Clay worked on Molly. For five days he sat with him, talked with a practiced softness about nothing, with all the care he had worked his whole life to perfect. They picked leaves and vegetables from the garden, and Molly was alright. They dried out mushrooms and kept the dead company at their graves, and Molly was alright. Molly was alive, slowly finding words on his tongue, remembered nothing, but he was alright.</p><p>He was alright until he wasn\u2019t, but that\u2019s always the way with grief.</p><p>Caduceus stitched up the wounds on his wrists with a steady hand, the ones that had made the knife in Molly\u2019s hand glow and caused him to call out in surprise. \u00a0The wounds whose whole purpose of being was to bleed, and whose blood alerted Caduceus to their presence in the night. The stitches were perfect, masterfully done Molly imagined, with no frame of reference beyond how even they look in his skin. \u00a0Big, gentle hands wiped the blood away with a warm cloth, and that prickle in the back of his eyes came again at the sensation. His eyes were wet but there were no tears. No pain, no numbness, only the warmth of Caduceus\u2019 hand that seemed that it could never reach his insides at that magnitude.</p><p><i>You shouldn\u2019t be alive and you know it</i>. a voice had spoken into Molly\u2019s ear off the wing of some black-feathered bird passing ahead in the dead of night. It rang through straight to his core where the emptiness sat. No memories, no life, no connection to the names he was supposed to know, the people he was supposed to care for. Covered in scars he couldn\u2019t recall or identify, what would one more set do?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want this.\u201d Molly\u2019s voice didn\u2019t shake. It darted out past his tongue like a scared snake, and receded again.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy won\u2019t you just let me die?\u201d</p><p>Caduceus sighed, took a beat before sitting down on his haunches and looked at Molly from his position of care on the floor.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been in this house my whole life, taking care of those graves and the people who belong to them. All of my family have gone looking for some way to save this place, but I stayed here, because the Wildmother needed me to. I\u2019ve been looking for a sign from her for what to do next, for something important that I need to do. If you excuse what uh, might sound a little crass&hellip;Well, I think you might be it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care that you think I\u2019m important. I shouldn\u2019t be alive.\u201d</p><p>The void pricked at the back of Molly\u2019s eyes again, and it echoed inside his stomach. His voice wavered like it could crack. There was nothing. He was grasping at straws to find any reason at all to exist and all he that he found is nothing.</p><p>\u201cNo, you shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeath should be a natural thing. Everything dies eventually, and they go back to the earth where they came from. Death is&hellip;random, and a lot of the time it comes when maybe it shouldn\u2019t, but it comes anyway. Now I don\u2019t know how you died the first time, or if it even was the first time. This time you died badly, but you still died. You should have stayed dead, and I think that because you didn\u2019t, something else must have taken your place. That&hellip;That&rsquo;s not a good thing at all. You won\u2019t die if you kill yourself like this. You\u2019ll only make all of whatever this is worse, and who knows what will happen to you if you keep coming back from the dead. <i>This</i>, how you are right now, is unnatural. Going back into the dirt right now, the way you are, is even worse. Stay alive. Something is taking your place, surely.\u201d</p><p>Grief, Caduceus has found over the years, takes many forms. It shows it\u2019s soft underbelly and pretends that it wants the gentle caress of comfort. \u00a0It curls into a ball with it\u2019s spikes and points pointing outwards, threatening, wanting no touch at all, as if getting on the defensive means that all it has to do is wait until the danger has passed. More often than not though, he\u2019s found that a gentle caress, or simply walking away from the defensive barbs doesn\u2019t help. It isn\u2019t, at the end, what grief always needs. Sometimes it needs honesty, a grounding in reality that feels safe. Grief is terribly afraid of what comes next, if anything at all. The truth hurts enough to uncurl the defensive barbs and expose the stomach to the care it needs, and Mollymauk felt alone when he began to cry. \u00a0He clutched at his own wrists like he could tear the good stitching out, and the words he couldn\u2019t find didn\u2019t come. The hollowness bled and filled, remained hollow, bled and filled again to the brim and drained its excess.</p><p>\u201cHey, come here now,\u201d Comforting words came with the strong embrace of Caduceus\u2019 arms as he pulled Mollymauk into his chest, caressed his hair, let that very alive dead thing empty his fear into Caduceus\u2019 chest. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be fine. I\u2019ve got you. Well get you back in the ground later but right now, you get to live.\u201d</p>",

It was soft, and while brown flecks had remained embedded in his teeth and nails for weeks, the effort had not broken skin.</p>[[MORE]]<p>The second and third times Molly woke up in his grave, the earth was frozen from the northern winter chill. It had frozen so solidly that it did not fill his mouth when he gasped for air and tried to cry out. He couldn\u2019t make it out.</p><p>The fourth time that Molly woke from the dead the winter snow had melted, sinking into the soil that had trapped him months earlier. He woke up feeling damp, with a trickle of water against his ears. The nails that he could not remember scratching and breaking against the frozen dirt pulled and tugged him out into the open air. He wheezed and he wept, scrambling away from the near frozen tomb. He couldn\u2019t remember what had scared him so severely, but the crunch of ice under now bruised knees, palms, elbows and bloodied fingers sent his stomach turning and his throat retching up nothing but newly thawed stomach acid in lingering panic.</p><p>Mollymauk came back with no memory each time. The first he had been left with nothing. The second and third found him trapped. The fourth came with panic, a pounding headache, and then a soft voice nearby.</p><p>\u201cI was wondering when you would come out of there. It\u2019s been a few months, but your friends really hoped that you would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere you go, this should warm you up.\u201d The tea cup in Molly\u2019s hands was the first truly warm sensation that he could recall. It seeped in through the crevices of his fingerprints like the coat wrapped around his body couldn\u2019t. The tall man that found him, that had hefted him into a cart and took Molly to the warmth of his home had wrapped the thing around Molly\u2019s body like it mattered. He said something about that coat being Molly\u2019s. \u00a0It rang no bells in Molly\u2019s ears, sounded no alarm. All that it was was not warm enough.</p><p>\u201cMy names Caduceus. Caduceus Clay. \u00a0Do you remember your name?\u201d</p><p>Silence. Molly opened his mouth. Closed it. There was nothing. The emptiness was dizzying.</p><p>\u201cWell that\u2019s no good.\u201d</p><p>The scraping of a chair on the ground broke the silence and, finally sitting, Caduceus nodded, and he smiled. He spoke slowly, like the words themselves took time to carry.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got some friends out there who think you\u2019re dead, but after what they told me\u2026Well, I\u2019m not really a fan of anyone raising from the dead like you did but I\u2019ll admit, you had me curious, and I needed to make sure. They said your name\u2019s Molly. Can you say Molly for me?\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth again. He tried to speak, and all that passed through his lips was a weak rasp. <i>Molly</i>. \u00a0The sound of it couldn\u2019t find his tongue. The back of his eyes prickled, and he just couldn\u2019t grasp it.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s alright. \u00a0We\u2019ll get you there. Drink that tea, it\u2019ll help.\u201d</p><p>Caduceus smiled with such gentle surety that Molly believed him, and he drank.</p><p>Grief is a funny thing. Sometimes, it creeps up without anyone knowing it\u2019s there at all. It can come out screaming, or sink you deep into a void where nothing moves for miles and miles. Caduceus had seen grief in its many forms. He had seen it in the living, the dying, and the dead. The dead, he\u2019s found, grieve in stunned silence more often than not. They grieve viscerally, because they are in all senses of the word no longer attached. For his whole life Caduceus had worked with death and its griefs, and for five days Caduceus Clay worked on Molly. For five days he sat with him, talked with a practiced softness about nothing, with all the care he had worked his whole life to perfect. They picked leaves and vegetables from the garden, and Molly was alright. They dried out mushrooms and kept the dead company at their graves, and Molly was alright. Molly was alive, slowly finding words on his tongue, remembered nothing, but he was alright.</p><p>He was alright until he wasn\u2019t, but that\u2019s always the way with grief.</p><p>Caduceus stitched up the wounds on his wrists with a steady hand, the ones that had made the knife in Molly\u2019s hand glow and caused him to call out in surprise. \u00a0The wounds whose whole purpose of being was to bleed, and whose blood alerted Caduceus to their presence in the night. The stitches were perfect, masterfully done Molly imagined, with no frame of reference beyond how even they look in his skin. \u00a0Big, gentle hands wiped the blood away with a warm cloth, and that prickle in the back of his eyes came again at the sensation. His eyes were wet but there were no tears. No pain, no numbness, only the warmth of Caduceus\u2019 hand that seemed that it could never reach his insides at that magnitude.</p><p><i>You shouldn\u2019t be alive and you know it</i>. a voice had spoken into Molly\u2019s ear off the wing of some black-feathered bird passing ahead in the dead of night. It rang through straight to his core where the emptiness sat. No memories, no life, no connection to the names he was supposed to know, the people he was supposed to care for. Covered in scars he couldn\u2019t recall or identify, what would one more set do?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want this.\u201d Molly\u2019s voice didn\u2019t shake. It darted out past his tongue like a scared snake, and receded again.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy won\u2019t you just let me die?\u201d</p><p>Caduceus sighed, took a beat before sitting down on his haunches and looked at Molly from his position of care on the floor.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been in this house my whole life, taking care of those graves and the people who belong to them. All of my family have gone looking for some way to save this place, but I stayed here, because the Wildmother needed me to. I\u2019ve been looking for a sign from her for what to do next, for something important that I need to do. If you excuse what uh, might sound a little crass\u2026Well, I think you might be it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care that you think I\u2019m important. I shouldn\u2019t be alive.\u201d</p><p>The void pricked at the back of Molly\u2019s eyes again, and it echoed inside his stomach. His voice wavered like it could crack. There was nothing. He was grasping at straws to find any reason at all to exist and all he that he found is nothing.</p><p>\u201cNo, you shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeath should be a natural thing. Everything dies eventually, and they go back to the earth where they came from. Death is\u2026random, and a lot of the time it comes when maybe it shouldn\u2019t, but it comes anyway.

The first time, so far away from here in a world of colour and fancy, his will to live and the drive of whatever force had breathed a second chance into his body had him clawing through the fresh, warm dirt until he was gasping for breathe with no words or name to claim as his own. The soil had not been packed well by cat or man. It was soft, and while brown flecks had remained embedded in his teeth and nails for weeks, the effort had not broken skin.</p><p>The second and third times Molly woke up in his grave, the earth was frozen from the northern winter chill. It had frozen so solidly that it did not fill his mouth when he gasped for air and tried to cry out. He couldn&rsquo;t make it out.</p><p>The fourth time that Molly woke from the dead the winter snow had melted, sinking into the soil that had trapped him months earlier. He woke up feeling damp, with a trickle of water against his ears. The nails that he could not remember scratching and breaking against the frozen dirt pulled and tugged him out into the open air. He wheezed and he wept, scrambling away from the near frozen tomb. He couldn&rsquo;t remember what had scared him so severely, but the crunch of ice under now bruised knees, palms, elbows and bloodied fingers sent his stomach turning and his throat retching up nothing but newly thawed stomach acid in lingering panic.</p><p>Mollymauk came back with no memory each time. The first he had been left with nothing. The second and third found him trapped. The fourth came with panic, a pounding headache, and then a soft voice nearby.</p><p>&ldquo;I was wondering when you would come out of there. It&rsquo;s been a few months, but your friends really hoped that you would.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Here you go, this should warm you up.&rdquo; The tea cup in Molly&rsquo;s hands was the first truly warm sensation that he could recall. It seeped in through the crevices of his fingerprints like the coat wrapped around his body couldn&rsquo;t. The tall man that found him, that had hefted him into a cart and took Molly to the warmth of his home had wrapped the thing around Molly&rsquo;s body like it mattered. He said something about that coat being Molly&rsquo;s. &nbsp;It rang no bells in Molly&rsquo;s ears, sounded no alarm. All that it was was not warm enough.</p><p>&ldquo;My names Caduceus. Caduceus Clay. &nbsp;Do you remember your name?&rdquo;</p><p>Silence. Molly opened his mouth. Closed it. There was nothing. The emptiness was dizzying.</p><p>&ldquo;Well that&rsquo;s no good.&rdquo;</p><p>The scraping of a chair on the ground broke the silence and, finally sitting, Caduceus nodded, and he smiled. He spoke slowly, like the words themselves took time to carry.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got some friends out there who think you&rsquo;re dead, but after what they told me&hellip;Well, I&rsquo;m not really a fan of anyone raising from the dead like you did but I&rsquo;ll admit, you had me curious, and I needed to make sure. They said your name&rsquo;s Molly. Can you say Molly for me?&rdquo;</p><p>He opened his mouth again. He tried to speak, and all that passed through his lips was a weak rasp. <i>Molly</i>. &nbsp;The sound of it couldn&rsquo;t find his tongue. The back of his eyes prickled, and he just couldn&rsquo;t grasp it.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s alright. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ll get you there. Drink that tea, it&rsquo;ll help.&rdquo;</p><p>Caduceus smiled with such gentle surety that Molly believed him, and he drank.</p><p>Grief is a funny thing. Sometimes, it creeps up without anyone knowing it&rsquo;s there at all. It can come out screaming, or sink you deep into a void where nothing moves for miles and miles. Caduceus had seen grief in its many forms. He had seen it in the living, the dying, and the dead. The dead, he&rsquo;s found, grieve in stunned silence more often than not. They grieve viscerally, because they are in all senses of the word no longer attached. For his whole life Caduceus had worked with death and its griefs, and for five days Caduceus Clay worked on Molly. For five days he sat with him, talked with a practiced softness about nothing, with all the care he had worked his whole life to perfect. They picked leaves and vegetables from the garden, and Molly was alright. They dried out mushrooms and kept the dead company at their graves, and Molly was alright. Molly was alive, slowly finding words on his tongue, remembered nothing, but he was alright.</p><p>He was alright until he wasn&rsquo;t, but that&rsquo;s always the way with grief.</p><p>Caduceus stitched up the wounds on his wrists with a steady hand, the ones that had made the knife in Molly&rsquo;s hand glow and caused him to call out in surprise. &nbsp;The wounds whose whole purpose of being was to bleed, and whose blood alerted Caduceus to their presence in the night. The stitches were perfect, masterfully done Molly imagined, with no frame of reference beyond how even they look in his skin. &nbsp;Big, gentle hands wiped the blood away with a warm cloth, and that prickle in the back of his eyes came again at the sensation. His eyes were wet but there were no tears. No pain, no numbness, only the warmth of Caduceus&rsquo; hand that seemed that it could never reach his insides at that magnitude.</p><p><i>You shouldn&rsquo;t be alive and you know it</i>. a voice had spoken into Molly&rsquo;s ear off the wing of some black-feathered bird passing ahead in the dead of night. It rang through straight to his core where the emptiness sat. No memories, no life, no connection to the names he was supposed to know, the people he was supposed to care for. Covered in scars he couldn&rsquo;t recall or identify, what would one more set do?</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want this.&rdquo; Molly&rsquo;s voice didn&rsquo;t shake. It darted out past his tongue like a scared snake, and receded again.</p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why won&rsquo;t you just let me die?&rdquo;</p><p>Caduceus sighed, took a beat before sitting down on his haunches and looked at Molly from his position of care on the floor.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in this house my whole life, taking care of those graves and the people who belong to them. All of my family have gone looking for some way to save this place, but I stayed here, because the Wildmother needed me to. I&rsquo;ve been looking for a sign from her for what to do next, for something important that I need to do. If you excuse what uh, might sound a little crass&hellip;Well, I think you might be it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care that you think I&rsquo;m important. I shouldn&rsquo;t be alive.&rdquo;</p><p>The void pricked at the back of Molly&rsquo;s eyes again, and it echoed inside his stomach. His voice wavered like it could crack. There was nothing. He was grasping at straws to find any reason at all to exist and all he that he found is nothing.</p><p>&ldquo;No, you shouldn&rsquo;t be.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Death should be a natural thing. Everything dies eventually, and they go back to the earth where they came from. Death is&hellip;random, and a lot of the time it comes when maybe it shouldn&rsquo;t, but it comes anyway. Now I don&rsquo;t know how you died the first time, or if it even was the first time. This time you died badly, but you still died. You should have stayed dead, and I think that because you didn&rsquo;t, something else must have taken your place. That&hellip;That&rsquo;s not a good thing at all. You won&rsquo;t die if you kill yourself like this. You&rsquo;ll only make all of whatever this is worse, and who knows what will happen to you if you keep coming back from the dead. <i>This</i>, how you are right now, is unnatural. Going back into the dirt right now, the way you are, is even worse. Stay alive. Something is taking your place, surely.&rdquo;</p><p>Grief, Caduceus has found over the years, takes many forms. It shows it&rsquo;s soft underbelly and pretends that it wants the gentle caress of comfort. &nbsp;It curls into a ball with it&rsquo;s spikes and points pointing outwards, threatening, wanting no touch at all, as if getting on the defensive means that all it has to do is wait until the danger has passed. More often than not though, he&rsquo;s found that a gentle caress, or simply walking away from the defensive barbs doesn&rsquo;t help. It isn&rsquo;t, at the end, what grief always needs. Sometimes it needs honesty, a grounding in reality that feels safe. Grief is terribly afraid of what comes next, if anything at all. The truth hurts enough to uncurl the defensive barbs and expose the stomach to the care it needs, and Mollymauk felt alone when he began to cry. &nbsp;He clutched at his own wrists like he could tear the good stitching out, and the words he couldn&rsquo;t find didn&rsquo;t come. The hollowness bled and filled, remained hollow, bled and filled again to the brim and drained its excess.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, come here now,&rdquo; Comforting words came with the strong embrace of Caduceus&rsquo; arms as he pulled Mollymauk into his chest, caressed his hair, let that very alive dead thing empty his fear into Caduceus&rsquo; chest. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to be fine. I&rsquo;ve got you. Well get you back in the ground later but right now, you get to live.&rdquo;</p>",
