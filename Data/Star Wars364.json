Enjoy!</i></p><!-- more --><blockquote><p>Armitage Hux, the stoic general of the First Order, was trying his best to keep his composure. The blaster in his hand felt heavy with betrayal, love, loathing, desperation, and shame. His hand was yet to be placed on the trigger, yet his hand was raised.</p><p>Despite all that occurred, he still didn\u2019t want this. All the treason and folly and embarrassment that happened, he was struggling to follow commands. No, not commands. Just this command.</p><p>He should have every right to want this, shouldn\u2019t he? After how broken and shamed he felt, it was only natural. But\u2026her eyes, there was something in her eyes and yet nothing all the same. It held all the memories, but none at the same time.</p><p><i>This ain\u2019t for the best<br/>My reputation\u2019s never been worse, so<br/>You must like me for me<br/>Yeah, I want you<br/>We can\u2019t make<br/>Any promises now, can we, babe? (Delicate)</i><br/></p><p>She had simply been in maintenance. He recognized her from his home\u2026it had been so long since he had been home. She was everything he had loved about the place. The fresh air, the sound of thunder, the flashes of lightning, and the rain. All of that was in her eyes. She had easily gotten his attention.</p><p>She had been a tad nervous when she was called to his office. With the doors closed, Armitage couldn\u2019t help but to beam. Even more uncharacteristically, he hugged her. She giggled before hugging him back. The two had been nearly inseparable back on Arkanis.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been so long,\u201d he murmured when the two pulled away.<br/>She lowered her head a bit.\u00a0\u201cEver since you had started going on those trips, Arkanis wasn\u2019t the same.\u201d<br/>He smiled upon hearing the sentiment.\u00a0\u201cHome was never where you weren\u2019t.\u201d<br/></p><p>She blushed. Armitage had grown red as he flustered about. They were so close together. As if she could read his mind, she kissed him in the secrecy of his office.</p><p><i>Big reputation, big reputation<br/>Ooh you and me we got big reputations, ah<br/>And you heard about me, ooh<br/>I got some big enemies (End Game)</i><br/></p><p>A story as old as Time, the romance picked up like a whirlwind. The pair was sucked down into a black hole of passion and flames. For the purposes of safety, the two of them kept the relationship a secret. Initially, she didn\u2019t want to, but after hearing how terrified he was of Snoke, she relented.</p><p>So, to make things easier to explain, she was promoted to be the General\u2019s personal assistant. She performed the job well, helping him with logistics and finding any errors in the system. In fact, no one questioned her promotion because of how much she was excelling. Armitage felt a growing sense of pride for the woman he loved.</p><p>It was strange. He knew he loved her, but it wasn\u2019t terrifying like he thought. In fact, it was nice. Her eyes would sparkle when they were together. Privacy was their haven. The fact that no one knew pushed away the fear. It seemed that Kylo Ren didn\u2019t even know, or he didn\u2019t care. Regardless, it made sense that they were together. Her words could take his pain away. He could go to her with everything. She was a great listener. Maybe too good of a listener\u2026</p><p><i>I don\u2019t like your little games<br/>Don\u2019t like your tilted stage<br/>The role you made me play<br/>Of the fool, no, I don\u2019t like you<br/>I don\u2019t like your perfect crime<br/>How you laugh when you lie<br/>You said the gun was mine<br/>Isn\u2019t cool, no, I don\u2019t like you (Look What You Made me do)</i><br/></p><p>It was too good to be true. She had been using their relationship for intel. Not only was she stealing information, she was giving it to the Resistance. All those late nights together, she had been working. Working the job and working him. He fell right into it. Had Snoke not questioned her himself, Hux would\u2019ve given the entire Order to the Resistance.</p><p>What was a perfect oasis had now become a shattered fool\u2019s dream. No, it was worse. Not even a fool would\u2019ve taken that dream. And the worst part was that she hadn\u2019t said a word since she was found out. Nothing to defend herself or admit what she had done. Just silence. That glimmer in her eye that he had so often seen had dulled. Her expression had become solemn.</p><p>She was preparing for death\u2026</p><p><i>I could\u2019ve spent forever with your hands in my pockets<br/>Picture of your face in an invisible locket<br/>You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it<br/>I had a bad feeling (Dancing with our Hands Tied)</i><br/></p><p>That realization made the blaster in his hand shake. His stomach had dropped. Snoke must\u2019ve told her his plan to have Armitage kill her in the throne room. Both knew that Snoke was broadcasting this as far as he could. The Sith smirked at the shaky hand.</p><p>\u201cSurely you\u2019d enjoy getting revenge on the scum who fooled you,\u201d he instigated,\u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s non-repentant as well. No care for you or for the Order; just her squabbling Resistance.\u201d<br/></p><p>Hux, knowing the consequences of not following through, forced himself to stop shaking. He dryly swallowed as he continued to stare at her. That little bit of a glimmer left was directed to him. But, he couldn\u2019t trust it.
