Dany has good intentions, at least she tells herself that. The consequences of her choices and the fundamental truth (since Martin loves the unreliable narrator) of her character has a good element of debate.</p><p>Meeren remains such a malaise to muddle through, I had to force myself to read those chapters and I tend to skip them in my re-reads.  It is darkness induced apathy for me, especially after the long wait for the Dance of Dragons (Martin one ups kicking the puppy with eating unborn ones!)</p><p>I just don&rsquo;t care.</p><p>I do ascribe to the theory Dany will fall under shadow but not fall into it. Similar to Jon and Tyrion, they are the endgame in the salvation of the world and that path is not going to pretty. Death equals redemption, but your mileage will vary.</p><p>I am not invested in Dany or Jon or Tyrion but I have a weakness for the pretty posts.</p>",
