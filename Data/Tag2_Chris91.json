Even through the thick wood, we could hear our families and friends bustling about, talking and laughing while intermingling and enjoying the cocktail hour. I hoped everyone was getting along, but that didn\u2019t take my mind off of the butterflies concocting a tornado in my stomach. Chris and I stood arm in arm as we anxiously awaited our cue, about to be introduced to everyone we loved as husband and wife.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be alright,\u201d he reassured me, reaching to place his hand over mine. \u201cLove you,\u201d Chris said nonchalantly as if it was a reminder to pick up some milk after work or put on my seatbelt. As if I, standing next to him in a white dress I\u2019ve been dying to wear since I picked it out months ago with a wedding ring that matched his joining the diamond on my ring finger, needed a reminder.</p><p>\u201cLove you too. Need me to go through my vows again?\u201d I joked in an attempt to alleviate some of the tension that coiled up inside of me like a snake ready to strike in the form of an anxiety attack. Chris rolled his eyes and shook his head as he ran his hand through his dark hair, blowing out a breath I didn\u2019t notice he\u2019d been holding until now. I watched intently as he nervously twisted the silver piece of metal around his left ring finger, a new tick he\u2019d already developed. At least the state of being a nervous reck currently had a population of two. I guess you could say neither of us were too fond of being the center of attention. \u201cVery funny,\u201d Chris said like he thought the exact opposite, but the way the corner of his lip tugged up hinted otherwise.</p><p>Before I could offer another witty response, the sound of the DJ&rsquo;s voice reverberated into the hallway. \u201cAttention, please,\u201d he said into the mic. The sudden shushing of everyone just through those doors had my stomach doing the kind of flips that made me reconsider whether or not we could join a traveling circus as a trapeze act. Chris held my hand in his, gripping it a little tighter than before. \u201cIt\u2019s my honor to introduce everyone to Mr. and Mrs. Evans!\u201d The door ripped open, revealing a dimly lit room so full of everyone we loved it seemed to be overflowing. Beautiful red roses were everywhere- Chris picked those out, being the hopeless romantic I know and love. Candles as the centerpieces were a good call too, they provided a warm glow to everything and provided a soothing vanilla scent. It felt like heaven.</p><p>Chris held our joined hands above our heads as if we were champions as he led us through the crowd. He seemed to be trying to take the moment in, every overwhelming bit of it, as he looked around the room. Caught up in the smiles on everyone\u2019s faces, the resonating claps and cheers coming from all of our closest friends and family that made you feel so full of love you could just burst, Chris seemed so utterly happy I couldn\u2019t help how my eyes stuck to him. His cheeks were red as he flushed with embarrassment, but he took it in stride with a grin so big it all but squeezed his eyes closed.</p><p>Soon, we reached the center of the dance floor where everyone crowded around us in a ring with enough room in the circle for it to feel like the world was only made for the two of us. It reminded me of how many happy accidents had to happen for us to be here, for Chris and I to exist at the same time and somehow grow up on the same street and then fall hopelessly in love with each other. The thought of how much of the universe had to happen for us to even happen and how destined we seemed to be in the mess of everything else brought tears to my eyes. Chris took notice when he turned to me, caressing my face in one hand and wiping the trickling teardrops with his thumb.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked, devoting all of his attention to me despite the other hundred or so people in the room. Being surrounded by his family from all over the great state of Massachusetts made Chris\u2019s accent so much more evident as he couldn\u2019t resist emphasizing his broad a\u2019s, bringing out that Bostonian way of speaking more than usual. \u201cNot a single thing,\u201d I told him with unconditional honesty, biting my tongue in an effort to refrain from killing the mood by making fun of his speech. \u201cPlus,\u201d I laughed, reaching to wipe the tears from his cheeks despite the scratch of his scruff, \u201cyou\u2019re crying, too.\u201d Chris laughed from his belly as he agreed that I had a good point.</p><p>The familiar strum of an acoustic guitar began once everyone quieted down, the start of a song that made me feel like I was floating on a cloud. Chris smiled softly, taking my hand in his as the other found a comfortable place on my waist. I leaned into him, resting my hand on his shoulder as I laid my cheek against his check.</p><p><i>Hold me close and hold me fast, this magic spell you cast</i></p><p><i>This is la vie en rose</i></p><p><i>When you kiss me heaven sighs, and though I close my eyes</i></p><p><i>I see la vie en rose</i></p><p>We started to sway to the song, one that was the background music to many of our favorite moments, one in particular I cherished the most in retrospect. One morning, Chris woke up first and decided to make breakfast. I remember how the smell of blueberry pancakes wafted into his bedroom, tugging me out of bed and toward the kitchen. He was still shirtless and his hair was a wreck from all the times I ran my hands through it the night before, standing in front of the stove with a frying pan in his hand. Chris didn\u2019t notice me yet and I didn\u2019t want him to, I was completely enthralled with the gentle curve of his hips as they swung to the music while he whistled to the tune of the words and how his back rippled when he reached for the spatula. And everything else about him, really. When Chris finally turned around and saw me, he broke out into a grin. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotta dance to this song at our wedding,\u201d he told me as if it were as much of a fact as the sky being blue. \u201cWe\u2019re getting married?\u201d I laughed incredulously. It wasn\u2019t that the idea of it bothered me, in fact spending the rest of my life with Chris seemed like a dream, just that he\u2019d only recently convinced me that even becoming something-more-than-friends might possibly be a good idea. Still, he was so sure of it. \u201cSomeday,\u201d he insisted, turning back to the stove and pouring more batter onto the pan.</p><p><i>When you press me to your heart, I\u2019m in a world apart</i></p><p><i>A world where roses bloom</i></p><p><i>And when you speak angels sing from above,</i></p><p><i>Everyday words seem to turn into love songs</i></p><p>\u201cLooks like when people have dance battles in the movies,\u201d Chris joked, looking around at the crowd surrounding us. I glanced up at him with playful annoyance lacing my furrowed brow. \u201cFor the record, I\u2019d kick your ass,\u201d I said smugly, humoring him anyway. Chris threw his head back with a burst of deep, rumbling laughter like if thunder was comforting, a sound I would never grow tired of. I couldn\u2019t help imagining how his laugh would grow raspy with age, the same way it deepened at some point in high school. I could still hear the way Chris laughed until he cried when we were kids and he talked me into kissing a frog with the false promise that it would turn into a prince. \u201cI\u2019ll let you keep thinking that. Happy wife happy life, right?\u201d he shot back, even more snarky than I anticipated. He sighed before placing a kiss on top of my head. \u201cI could get used to that you know,\u201d he whispered wistfully, nostalgic for a moment as it was still happening. I closed my eyes as I tried to focus on hearing the steady thump of his heart and hummed, hoping Chris would understand it as a question.</p><p><i>Give your heart and soul to me</i></p><p><i>And life will always be la vie en rose</i></p><p>\u201cCalling you my wife, I mean. I like it,\u201d he elaborated shyly like he was worried I might laugh at him for being so mushy. I adjusted our position, wrapping my arms around his neck while Chris clasped his hands together at the small of my back. Our eyes met and everyone around us seemed to melt into the background. I thought about lampooning him with some wisecrack about how he better after the blood, sweat, and tears that went into making this wedding happen and completely ruining the moment. \u201cI like it too,\u201d I reassured him instead, leaning in a little to place a quick kiss on his lips. \u201cI\u2019d hope so, otherwise this is awfully embarrassing,\u201d Chris quipped as he kept us swaying to the tune of the guitar. Neither of us were as concerned with dancing well as we were with relishing in this moment, conscious of the fact that this was our only first dance. \u201cHave I told you how beautiful you are yet?\u201d Chris asked, taking my hand in his again before surprising me with a twirl. I giggled, looking down at our feet in an attempt to hide my blush. I noticed a couple tears already forming around the bottom of my dress\u2019s tulle from where Chris had missed the floor with his step.</p><p><i>And when you speak angels sing from above</i></p><p><i>Everyday words seem to turn into love songs</i></p><p>I didn\u2019t mind though, I imagined myself in another twenty years or so digging through our attic and uncovering the box my wedding dress had been tucked away into and remembering this exact moment, the wholehearted happiness I felt and the way Chris smiled at me with a familiar softness. \u201cOnly so many times I\u2019ve lost count. Have you seen yourself though?\u201d I retaliated the compliment with raised eyebrows, looking him up and down in his tux. It was a dark navy blue, just enough to make his beautiful baby blues pop against the shade. Chris only rolled his eyes, pulling me into his chest again to continue our dance. I was keenly aware that the song was about to end so I tried to soak up as much of this feeling of it being just two of us against the world while I still could. Soon, we\u2019d be drinking with our friends while they poked fun at us for being tied down, eating our choice of chicken or fish that wouldn\u2019t be worth the price tag regardless, and making small talk with the distant uncles and aunts we only saw at events like these anyway. For the last few chords of this guitar, it was just Chris and me holding each other close and sharing little things meant for just the two of us to hear.</p><p><i>Give your heart and soul to me</i></p><p><i>And life will always be la vie en rose</i></p><p>At the end of the song, Chris dipped me and leaned down into a passionate kiss that would\u2019ve been immensely embarrassing if I thought about how my grandmother was watching. I was intimately reminded of all of the eyes on us as the crowd erupted with cheers, but even that didn\u2019t faze us. Chris lifted me back up to stand with him, pulling away for air as we drowned in the sea of people around us. Without breaking eye contact, he grabbed both of my cheeks and pressed his soft lips against mine again like some sort of declaration, pouring every bit of his passion into me. I placed my hands over his, liking the feeling of the cold metal of his wedding ring pressing against my palm, and thought about how there were so many mind-bogglingly wonderful things like this we\u2019d get to get used to together.</p><hr><p>Tagged: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvx92Ca0bmTX9IHcJIKCwOQ\">@patzammit</a></p>",

When Chris finally turned around and saw me, he broke out into a grin. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotta dance to this song at our wedding,\u201d he told me as if it were as much of a fact as the sky being blue. \u201cWe\u2019re getting married?\u201d I laughed incredulously. It wasn\u2019t that the idea of it bothered me, in fact spending the rest of my life with Chris seemed like a dream, just that he\u2019d only recently convinced me that even becoming something-more-than-friends might possibly be a good idea. Still, he was so sure of it. \u201cSomeday,\u201d he insisted, turning back to the stove and pouring more batter onto the pan.</p><p><i>When you press me to your heart, I\u2019m in a world apart</i></p><p><i>A world where roses bloom</i></p><p><i>And when you speak angels sing from above,</i></p><p><i>Everyday words seem to turn into love songs</i></p><p>\u201cLooks like when people have dance battles in the movies,\u201d Chris joked, looking around at the crowd surrounding us. I glanced up at him with playful annoyance lacing my furrowed brow. \u201cFor the record, I\u2019d kick your ass,\u201d I said smugly, humoring him anyway. Chris threw his head back with a burst of deep, rumbling laughter like if thunder was comforting, a sound I would never grow tired of. I couldn\u2019t help imagining how his laugh would grow raspy with age, the same way it deepened at some point in high school. I could still hear the way Chris laughed until he cried when we were kids and he talked me into kissing a frog with the false promise that it would turn into a prince. \u201cI\u2019ll let you keep thinking that. Happy wife happy life, right?\u201d he shot back, even more snarky than I anticipated. He sighed before placing a kiss on top of my head. \u201cI could get used to that you know,\u201d he whispered wistfully, nostalgic for a moment as it was still happening. I closed my eyes as I tried to focus on hearing the steady thump of his heart and hummed, hoping Chris would understand it as a question.</p><p><i>Give your heart and soul to me</i></p><p><i>And life will always be la vie en rose</i></p><p>\u201cCalling you my wife, I mean. I like it,\u201d he elaborated shyly like he was worried I might laugh at him for being so mushy. I adjusted our position, wrapping my arms around his neck while Chris clasped his hands together at the small of my back. Our eyes met and everyone around us seemed to melt into the background. I thought about lampooning him with some wisecrack about how he better after the blood, sweat, and tears that went into making this wedding happen and completely ruining the moment. \u201cI like it too,\u201d I reassured him instead, leaning in a little to place a quick kiss on his lips. \u201cI\u2019d hope so, otherwise this is awfully embarrassing,\u201d Chris quipped as he kept us swaying to the tune of the guitar. Neither of us were as concerned with dancing well as we were with relishing in this moment, conscious of the fact that this was our only first dance. \u201cHave I told you how beautiful you are yet?\u201d Chris asked, taking my hand in his again before surprising me with a twirl. I giggled, looking down at our feet in an attempt to hide my blush. I noticed a couple tears already forming around the bottom of my dress\u2019s tulle from where Chris had missed the floor with his step.</p><p><i>And when you speak angels sing from above</i></p><p><i>Everyday words seem to turn into love songs</i></p><p>I didn\u2019t mind though, I imagined myself in another twenty years or so digging through our attic and uncovering the box my wedding dress had been tucked away into and remembering this exact moment, the wholehearted happiness I felt and the way Chris smiled at me with a familiar softness. \u201cOnly so many times I\u2019ve lost count. Have you seen yourself though?\u201d I retaliated the compliment with raised eyebrows, looking him up and down in his tux. It was a dark navy blue, just enough to make his beautiful baby blues pop against the shade. Chris only rolled his eyes, pulling me into his chest again to continue our dance. I was keenly aware that the song was about to end so I tried to soak up as much of this feeling of it being just two of us against the world while I still could. Soon, we\u2019d be drinking with our friends while they poked fun at us for being tied down, eating our choice of chicken or fish that wouldn\u2019t be worth the price tag regardless, and making small talk with the distant uncles and aunts we only saw at events like these anyway. For the last few chords of this guitar, it was just Chris and me holding each other close and sharing little things meant for just the two of us to hear.</p><p><i>Give your heart and soul to me</i></p><p><i>And life will always be la vie en rose</i></p><p>At the end of the song, Chris dipped me and leaned down into a passionate kiss that would\u2019ve been immensely embarrassing if I thought about how my grandmother was watching. I was intimately reminded of all of the eyes on us as the crowd erupted with cheers, but even that didn\u2019t faze us. Chris lifted me back up to stand with him, pulling away for air as we drowned in the sea of people around us. Without breaking eye contact, he grabbed both of my cheeks and pressed his soft lips against mine again like some sort of declaration, pouring every bit of his passion into me. I placed my hands over his, liking the feeling of the cold metal of his wedding ring pressing against my palm, and thought about how there were so many mind-bogglingly wonderful things like this we\u2019d get to get used to together.</p><hr><p>Tagged: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvx92Ca0bmTX9IHcJIKCwOQ\">@patzammit</a></p>",

Even through the thick wood, we could hear our families and friends bustling about, talking and laughing while intermingling and enjoying the cocktail hour. I hoped everyone was getting along, but that didn\u2019t take my mind off of the butterflies concocting a tornado in my stomach. Chris and I stood arm in arm as we anxiously awaited our cue, about to be introduced to everyone we loved as husband and wife.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be alright,\u201d he reassured me, reaching to place his hand over mine. \u201cLove you,\u201d Chris said nonchalantly as if it was a reminder to pick up some milk after work or put on my seatbelt. As if I, standing next to him in a white dress I\u2019ve been dying to wear since I picked it out months ago with a wedding ring that matched his joining the diamond on my ring finger, needed a reminder.</p><p>\u201cLove you too. Need me to go through my vows again?\u201d I joked in an attempt to alleviate some of the tension that coiled up inside of me like a snake ready to strike in the form of an anxiety attack. Chris rolled his eyes and shook his head as he ran his hand through his dark hair, blowing out a breath I didn\u2019t notice he\u2019d been holding until now. I watched intently as he nervously twisted the silver piece of metal around his left ring finger, a new tick he\u2019d already developed. At least the state of being a nervous reck currently had a population of two. I guess you could say neither of us were too fond of being the center of attention. \u201cVery funny,\u201d Chris said like he thought the exact opposite, but the way the corner of his lip tugged up hinted otherwise.</p><p>Before I could offer another witty response, the sound of the DJ\u2019s voice reverberated into the hallway. \u201cAttention, please,\u201d he said into the mic. The sudden shushing of everyone just through those doors had my stomach doing the kind of flips that made me reconsider whether or not we could join a traveling circus as a trapeze act. Chris held my hand in his, gripping it a little tighter than before. \u201cIt\u2019s my honor to introduce everyone to Mr. and Mrs. Evans!\u201d The door ripped open, revealing a dimly lit room so full of everyone we loved it seemed to be overflowing. Beautiful red roses were everywhere- Chris picked those out, being the hopeless romantic I know and love. Candles as the centerpieces were a good call too, they provided a warm glow to everything and provided a soothing vanilla scent. It felt like heaven.</p><p>Chris held our joined hands above our heads as if we were champions as he led us through the crowd. He seemed to be trying to take the moment in, every overwhelming bit of it, as he looked around the room. Caught up in the smiles on everyone\u2019s faces, the resonating claps and cheers coming from all of our closest friends and family that made you feel so full of love you could just burst, Chris seemed so utterly happy I couldn\u2019t help how my eyes stuck to him. His cheeks were red as he flushed with embarrassment, but he took it in stride with a grin so big it all but squeezed his eyes closed.</p><p>Soon, we reached the center of the dance floor where everyone crowded around us in a ring with enough room in the circle for it to feel like the world was only made for the two of us. It reminded me of how many happy accidents had to happen for us to be here, for Chris and I to exist at the same time and somehow grow up on the same street and then fall hopelessly in love with each other. The thought of how much of the universe had to happen for us to even happen and how destined we seemed to be in the mess of everything else brought tears to my eyes. Chris took notice when he turned to me, caressing my face in one hand and wiping the trickling teardrops with his thumb.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked, devoting all of his attention to me despite the other hundred or so people in the room. Being surrounded by his family from all over the great state of Massachusetts made Chris\u2019s accent so much more evident as he couldn\u2019t resist emphasizing his broad a\u2019s, bringing out that Bostonian way of speaking more than usual. \u201cNot a single thing,\u201d I told him with unconditional honesty, biting my tongue in an effort to refrain from killing the mood by making fun of his speech. \u201cPlus,\u201d I laughed, reaching to wipe the tears from his cheeks despite the scratch of his scruff, \u201cyou\u2019re crying, too.\u201d Chris laughed from his belly as he agreed that I had a good point.</p><p>The familiar strum of an acoustic guitar began once everyone quieted down, the start of a song that made me feel like I was floating on a cloud. Chris smiled softly, taking my hand in his as the other found a comfortable place on my waist. I leaned into him, resting my hand on his shoulder as I laid my cheek against his check.</p><p><i>Hold me close and hold me fast, this magic spell you cast</i></p><p><i>This is la vie en rose</i></p><p><i>When you kiss me heaven sighs, and though I close my eyes</i></p><p><i>I see la vie en rose</i></p><p>We started to sway to the song, one that was the background music to many of our favorite moments, one in particular I cherished the most in retrospect. One morning, Chris woke up first and decided to make breakfast. I remember how the smell of blueberry pancakes wafted into his bedroom, tugging me out of bed and toward the kitchen. He was still shirtless and his hair was a wreck from all the times I ran my hands through it the night before, standing in front of the stove with a frying pan in his hand. Chris didn\u2019t notice me yet and I didn\u2019t want him to, I was completely enthralled with the gentle curve of his hips as they swung to the music while he whistled to the tune of the words and how his back rippled when he reached for the spatula.

Chris didn&rsquo;t notice me yet and I didn&rsquo;t want him to, I was completely enthralled with the gentle curve of his hips as they swung to the music while he whistled to the tune of the words and how his back rippled when he reached for the spatula. And everything else about him, really. When Chris finally turned around and saw me, he broke out into a grin. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve gotta dance to this song at our wedding,&rdquo; he told me as if it were as much of a fact as the sky being blue. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting married?&rdquo; I laughed incredulously. It wasn&rsquo;t that the idea of it bothered me, in fact spending the rest of my life with Chris seemed like a dream, just that he&rsquo;d only recently convinced me that even becoming something-more-than-friends might possibly be a good idea. Still, he was so sure of it. &ldquo;Someday,&rdquo; he insisted, turning back to the stove and pouring more batter onto the pan.</p><p><i>When you press me to your heart, I&rsquo;m in a world apart</i></p><p><i>A world where roses bloom</i></p><p><i>And when you speak angels sing from above,</i></p><p><i>Everyday words seem to turn into love songs</i></p><p>&ldquo;Looks like when people have dance battles in the movies,&rdquo; Chris joked, looking around at the crowd surrounding us. I glanced up at him with playful annoyance lacing my furrowed brow. &ldquo;For the record, I&rsquo;d kick your ass,&rdquo; I said smugly, humoring him anyway. Chris threw his head back with a burst of deep, rumbling laughter like if thunder was comforting, a sound I would never grow tired of. I couldn&rsquo;t help imagining how his laugh would grow raspy with age, the same way it deepened at some point in high school. I could still hear the way Chris laughed until he cried when we were kids and he talked me into kissing a frog with the false promise that it would turn into a prince. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you keep thinking that. Happy wife happy life, right?&rdquo; he shot back, even more snarky than I anticipated. He sighed before placing a kiss on top of my head. &ldquo;I could get used to that you know,&rdquo; he whispered wistfully, nostalgic for a moment as it was still happening. I closed my eyes as I tried to focus on hearing the steady thump of his heart and hummed, hoping Chris would understand it as a question.</p><p><i>Give your heart and soul to me</i></p><p><i>And life will always be la vie en rose</i></p><p>&ldquo;Calling you my wife, I mean. I like it,&rdquo; he elaborated shyly like he was worried I might laugh at him for being so mushy. I adjusted our position, wrapping my arms around his neck while Chris clasped his hands together at the small of my back. Our eyes met and everyone around us seemed to melt into the background. I thought about lampooning him with some wisecrack about how he better after the blood, sweat, and tears that went into making this wedding happen and completely ruining the moment. &ldquo;I like it too,&rdquo; I reassured him instead, leaning in a little to place a quick kiss on his lips. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d hope so, otherwise this is awfully embarrassing,&rdquo; Chris quipped as he kept us swaying to the tune of the guitar. Neither of us were as concerned with dancing well as we were with relishing in this moment, conscious of the fact that this was our only first dance. &ldquo;Have I told you how beautiful you are yet?&rdquo; Chris asked, taking my hand in his again before surprising me with a twirl. I giggled, looking down at our feet in an attempt to hide my blush. I noticed a couple tears already forming around the bottom of my dress&rsquo;s tulle from where Chris had missed the floor with his step.</p><p><i>And when you speak angels sing from above</i></p><p><i>Everyday words seem to turn into love songs</i></p><p>I didn&rsquo;t mind though, I imagined myself in another twenty years or so digging through our attic and uncovering the box my wedding dress had been tucked away into and remembering this exact moment, the wholehearted happiness I felt and the way Chris smiled at me with a familiar softness. &ldquo;Only so many times I&rsquo;ve lost count. Have you seen yourself though?&rdquo; I retaliated the compliment with raised eyebrows, looking him up and down in his tux. It was a dark navy blue, just enough to make his beautiful baby blues pop against the shade. Chris only rolled his eyes, pulling me into his chest again to continue our dance. I was keenly aware that the song was about to end so I tried to soak up as much of this feeling of it being just two of us against the world while I still could. Soon, we&rsquo;d be drinking with our friends while they poked fun at us for being tied down, eating our choice of chicken or fish that wouldn&rsquo;t be worth the price tag regardless, and making small talk with the distant uncles and aunts we only saw at events like these anyway. For the last few chords of this guitar, it was just Chris and me holding each other close and sharing little things meant for just the two of us to hear.</p><p><i>Give your heart and soul to me</i></p><p><i>And life will always be la vie en rose</i></p><p>At the end of the song, Chris dipped me and leaned down into a passionate kiss that would&rsquo;ve been immensely embarrassing if I thought about how my grandmother was watching. I was intimately reminded of all of the eyes on us as the crowd erupted with cheers, but even that didn&rsquo;t faze us. Chris lifted me back up to stand with him, pulling away for air as we drowned in the sea of people around us. Without breaking eye contact, he grabbed both of my cheeks and pressed his soft lips against mine again like some sort of declaration, pouring every bit of his passion into me. I placed my hands over his, liking the feeling of the cold metal of his wedding ring pressing against my palm, and thought about how there were so many mind-bogglingly wonderful things like this we&rsquo;d get to get used to together.</p><hr /><p>Tagged: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvx92Ca0bmTX9IHcJIKCwOQ\">@patzammit</a></p>",

Y/N had been digging through her clothes for nearly an hour in an effort to find something to wear on her date with Chris that night.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like that one either,\u201d she heard her sister say over the video call.</p><p>She tossed the top aside and threw herself back onto the bed. \u201cYou\u2019re not helping here, Rach,\u201d she growled at the screen.</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cWell it\u2019s not my fault you didn\u2019t pack any date clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know I\u2019d need them.\u201d Y/N threw her hands up in frustration.</p><p>This day was turning out to be a disaster. Y/N had practically squealed with excitement that morning when she gotten up. The thought of her date with Chris had been enough to send her to the moon and back over breakfast. Mrs. Travinski had noticed her mood over breakfast. The wylie old woman had decided to play a game of twenty questions with her. She\u2019d been so excited to learn about Y/N\u2019s date that she\u2019d practically pushed her out the door.</p><p>\u201cYou need to make sure you still have time to get ready,\u201d she\u2019d told her.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until Y/N was about half way through her round of site seeing that the reality of her situation hit her in the face.</p><p>She was going on a date. She was going on a date in Boston with one of the city\u2019s favorite sons. Surely that came with certain expectations. God, she didn\u2019t even know where he was taking her. Would it be some fancy restaurant with a private dining area just for them, or would it be another one of those local treasures he seemed to be so fond of? She just didn\u2019t know what to do.</p><p>\u201cWhere did he say he was taking you again?\u201d she heard her sister ask.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t.\u201d Y/N rolled onto her side and turned the phone so that she could see her sister.</p><p>Rachel worried her lower lip for a minute before her eyes lit up. \u201cDid you take that blue tunic dress looking thing with you?\u201d</p><p>The top Rachel was referring to was one of Y/N\u2019s favorites. She always kept it in reserve for days when she wasn\u2019t really feeling herself. It\u2019s soft material and flattering lines always made her feel better.</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about leggings do you have those?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe point Rach,\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cGo try them on.\u201d <i>This isn\u2019t going to work.</i></p><p>She stopped short when she spotted herself in the mirror after putting on the outfit her sister suggested. The deep blue of the top accentuated the color of her eyes and gave her skin a healthy glow. The simple black leggings dressed it up beautifully. It was nothing fancy, but it was exactly what she needed.</p><p>\u201cLet me see!\u201d Y/N rolled her eyes and retrieved her phone, holding it up so that her sister could see the mirror. \u201cLooks good. I told you it would work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know you love me.\u201d</p><p>Y/N grinned and rolled her eyes. Yay younger siblings. She glanced over at the clock 6:30. She didn\u2019t have time to waste if she was going to be ready on time. She quickly bid her sister goodbye and started racing around her suite. She\u2019d just finished putting on the last stitch of makeup when a knock sounded on her door followed by the sound of Mrs. Travinski\u2019s voice announcing that her young man was here.</p><hr><p>It was everything Chris could do to keep from fidgeting while he waited for Y/N to come downstairs, but nothing was working. He kept fiddling with the ribbon on the bouquet he\u2019d brought her, and his feet wouldn\u2019t stay still. He kept shifting his weight from foot to foot, pacing a few steps here and there for good measure.</p><p>He\u2019d spent all day running around, getting everything ready for tonight. Things that should only have taken a few minutes took nearly half an hour. Chris kept finding himself going in circles. Running over the most insignificant details over and over again until he\u2019d been forced to take Dodger on a long walk to clear his mind.</p><p>The sound of feet on the stairs drew his attention. Chris closed his eyes and took a deep breath. <i>Come on, Chris. Get it together.</i> Opening his eyes, he turned to she the older woman that had greeted him when he first walked through the door coming down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be down in just a minute,\u201d she said. Her kind age-wizzled eyes gazing up at him. \u201cYou\u2019re a nice looking boy.\u201d Chris smiled in thanks. \u201cYou take good care of her now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a smile before turning and walking away. Chris watched her go before turning his eyes back towards the stairs and doing a double take.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d he breathed.</p><p>In all his years of extravagant Hollywood parties and glitzy premiers, Chris couldn\u2019t remember ever seeing anyone look as beautiful as Y/N did in that moment. It was like she was lit from within. Not even a glittering ball gown would hold a candle to the way she looked in her simple tunic and boots.</p><p>\u201cYou look amazing,\u201d he said, walking up to great her as her foot hit the landing.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She looked down and tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. She gestured towards the flowers. \u201cAre those for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, uh, yeah. Here.\u201d He thrust the forgotten flowers into her face.</p><p>He half expected her to frown and back away at his less than smooth gesture, but she just smiled and thanked him.</p><p>Y/N looked around awkwardly. \u201cUmm\u2026\u201d</p><p><i>Shit</i>. He hadn\u2019t thought about her not having a place to keep them.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d a voice from across the room said. Chris turned his head to see the older woman approaching them with a vase in her hand. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of those. You two go have a good time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mrs Travinski,\u201d Y/N said with a smile. She handed the woman her bouquet before turning her attention back to Chris.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Y/N nodded. Chris grabbed her coat off of the rack near the door and held it out for her. He couldn\u2019t help but notice the slightest hint of a blush on her cheeks when she thanked him. Once she had her coat on, Chris offered her his arm to lead her out to the car.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Y/N asked once they were away from her temporary home, \u201cwhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, uh,\u201d Chris swallowed around the lump in his throat. In all his careful planning, he hadn\u2019t stopped to think about her opinion on his plan for their date.\u00a0\u201cI thought this might be a good time to cook you that meal I promised you a while back.\u201d He cast a quick glance over at Y/N just in time to see her eyes grow wide.\u00a0</p><p>Chris wanted to kick himself in the teeth. He stopped at a red light and squeezed his eyes closed for a moment.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to,\u201d he added, slowly opening his eyes and turning them towards her. \u201cWe can go anywhere you want. Just say the word and\u2026\u201d His rambling was cut short by the feeling of her hand resting on his arm.</p><p>\u201cChris, it\u2019s okay.\u201d She gave him a sweet smile. \u201cThat sounds great. You just surprised me is all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood surprise?\u201d he asked, the hope that he hadn\u2019t ruined the date before it began clear in his voice.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cGood surprise.\u201d</p><p>He gave a sigh of relief and smiled over at her. It was going to be a good night. He could feel it.</p><hr><p>An unexpected flurry of nerves rushed through her when Chris pulled into the private garage attached to his apartment building. The thought of spending the evening completely alone with Chris sent a thrill through her that she wasn\u2019t sure how to describe. She\u2019d been nervous when he first suggested it, but her excitement quickly outweighed it. Chris had proven to her on more than one occasion that he was a good man.She would never have agreed to the date if she thought otherwise..</p><p>Chris got out of the car and made his way around to get the door. Accepting his offered hand, Y/N thanked him before taking his hand and letting him lead her to what she could only assume was a private elevator since it required a key and a special code to work.</p><p>As the elevator continued to rise, Y/N\u2019s nerves returned. It had been so long since she\u2019d been on a real date, let alone one as intimate as this. What if she did something wrong?</p><p>The elevator dinged, and the door slid open to reveal the most breathtaking view of the city she could imagine. A audible gasp left her lips as she took a step into the open concept apartment. The floor to ceiling windows that made up the opposite wall of the condo offered one of the most spectacular views she had ever seen and made the space feel much larger than it was. The lights of the city twinkled to her in greeting. Her heels clicked against the wooden floor as she moved farther into the room.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she heard Chris say softly behind her. \u201cThe view was one of the key selling points.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see why.\u201d</p><p>An excited yip and the sound of nails clacking on the hardwood floor filled the room. Y/N turned to see Dodger rounding the corner. The excited pup made a beeline straight towards Chris, receiving a scratch on the head before turning his attention to Y/N. She squatted down to give him some attention.</p><p>\u201cHello boy.\u201d</p><p>She rose to her feet and turned to find Chris standing a few feet away, his hands in his pockets and an easy smile on his lips. Y/N\u2019s heart gave a little flutter when he stepped forward and brought a hand up to brush a strand of hair behind her ear before leaning in ever so slightly. She pulled her bottom lip between her teeth and started to lean forward to met him when the sound of a door closing to her left followed by the sound of footsteps made her jump. Someone else was there.</p><p>Chris grabbed her by the shoulder and pulled her behind him. A shiver of fear ran down her spine and she took a trembling step closer to him. Chris kept an arm extended behind him to shield her as he took a step forward. Y/N\u2019s fist clinched the back of his shirt to keep him close. A scream lodged in her throat when a man with spiky blonde hair came around the corner of the kitchen, he head slowly coming up to look at them.</p><p>Chris immediately relaxed at the sight of him. \u201cWhat the fuck, Scott?!\u201d he yelled.</p><p>Y/N let go of the back of his shirt and looked back and forth between the two men, her mind frantically trying to make sense of the situation.</p><p>\u201cWell hello to you too big brother,\u201d Scott said, taking a step towards him. He looked at Y/N over his brother\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I scared you. I didn\u2019t know anyone else would be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d she said, stepping out from behind Chris. \u201cNo worries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? I can\u2019t just want to see you?\u201d Scott grabbed a handful of nuts from the container of mixed nuts on the counter and started munching away.</p><p>\u201cThat key is for emergencies, Scott,\u201d Chris chastened. \u201cNot so you can break in and eat my food.\u201d</p><p>Scott shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll call next time.\u201d His eyes locked on Y/N. \u201cI really am sorry. Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>Y/N waved him off with a smile.\u00a0She\u2019d been watching their exchange in silence. Seeing Chris so flustered was actually pretty amusing. The way his Bostonian accent thickened when he was berating his younger brother made her smile. She\u2019d heard bits and pieces of it here and there, but it had never been like that before. She liked it.</p><p>\u201cIs this the girl?\u201d Scott asked. Y/N had to put a hand over her mouth to stifle a laugh at the almost murderous look Chris gave him. Scott moved past Chris and held his hand out towards her. \u201cMy brother won\u2019t shut up about you. I\u2019m Scott by the way. Since he seems to have lost all of his manners and won\u2019t introduce me. Ma would be so pissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said, shaking his hand, \u201cI\u2019m Y/N.\u201d Chris rolled his eyes behind is brother\u2019s back, making her bite her lower lip to keep her laughter in check. \u201cPleased to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScott,\u201d Chris groaned, running a hand down his face.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mind?\u201d</p><p>Chris gesturing towards the door, but Scott didn\u2019t move. Chris gestured again, his mouth forming a grim line. Scott looked from his brother to the woman beside him and back again.</p><p>\u201cOh, is this a date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Chris huffed. \u201cSo could you please?\u201d He made a fluttering gesture with his hands.</p><p>Y/N watched with a rueful smile on her face as Chris escorted his younger brother to the door.</p><p>\u201cSee you guys later,\u201d he called.</p><p>\u201cBye, Scott,\u201d Y/N called cheerfully. \u201cIt was nice meeting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too.\u201d He stepped into the waiting elevator before turning his attention to Chris. \u201cYou,\u201d he pointed at his brother, \u201cuse a condom.\u201d</p><p>Y/N couldn\u2019t hold it back anymore and burst into laughter when she saw the murderous expression cross Chris\u2019 face while his brother grinned back at him in cheeky satisfaction behind the slowly closing door.</p><hr><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry about that,\u201d Chris said for what felt like the millionth time since his brother left.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t believe Scott had shown up like that. Well, maybe he could, but he should have realized what was going on and left sooner. Chris heard Y/N giggle behind him and turned away from the pasta sauce he had been stirring to see her sitting on the other side of the island watching him, a hint of amusement on her face. She\u2019d taken a seat on one of the barstools to watch him cook after he shoo\u2019ed her out of the kitchen with the assurance that he had everything under control.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she assured him. \u201cYour brother\u2019s really funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has his moments.\u201d Chris looked back down at the stove. \u201cI think it\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get the plates.\u201d</p><p>Chris waved her off. \u201cNo. I\u2019ve got it. If you\u2019ll just grab the wine we\u2019ll be all set.\u201d Chris nodded towards the bottle of wine he\u2019d pulled out for them earlier.</p><p>He drained the pasta and grabbed a couple plates from the cabinet. Putting a heaping serving of pasta and sauce on each, he motioned for Y/N to follow him to the table near the bank of windows. The table was small, only four chairs, so Chris sat the plates on either end of the table before pulling out Y/N\u2019s chair for her.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she whispered, sitting the wine glasses down next to the plates.</p><p>Chris smiled and nodded before pushing in her chair. He poured them each a glass of wine and moving around to his seat. He was half seated when he looked up and spotted something missing from the table.</p><p>He held up a finger. \u201cJust a second.\u201d</p><p>He walked back over to the kitchen, nearly tripping over Dodger in the process, and started rummaging through the drawers for a lighter. He couldn\u2019t believe that he\u2019d forgotten to light the candles. <i>You can\u2019t have a candlelight dinner without candles, dumbass.</i></p><p>\u201cAh ha.\u201d He held the lighter over his head in triumph. \u201cGot it.\u201d</p><p>Chris smiled over at Y/N as he lit the candles.</p><p>\u201cHow romantic,\u201d she teased.</p><p>Chris shrugged. He\u2019d never made it a secret that he was a romantic at heart. His only goal for the evening was to make Y/N feel special, and if the smile on her face was any indication, he was doing a great job so far.</p><p>They ate in a comfortable silence, broken up here and there with easy conversation. It made Chris glad he decided to cook for her instead of going out somewhere. He was never able to really relax in a restaurant. There were too many prying eyes and ears just waiting for a juicy bit of information they could sell to the tabloids. This was better. They could talk without having to worry about anyone but themselves. It was perfect.</p><p>\u201cThis sauce is really good,\u201d Y/N said. \u201cHow\u2019d you learn to cook?\u201d</p><p>Chris couldn\u2019t keep the note of pride out of his voice. \u201cI\u2019m glad you like it. Ma taught me. She taught all of us actually. She wanted us all to know how to cook so we wouldn\u2019t starve to death once we left the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart woman.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, an adoring grin on his face. \u201cShe is.\u201d</p><p>They finished eating, and Chris cleared away the dishes, depositing them in the sink for later. When he turned around, he found Y/N looking out across the city with Dodger planted at her feet. A smile formed on his face. Three of the things he loved most in the world in one image. His city, his dog, and his girl. He shook the thought from his mind. Thinking like that this early in the relationship wouldn\u2019t do either of them any good. He needed to pump the breaks and give it time.</p><p>Chris found the remote for the sound system sitting on one of the end tables and clicked it on. Soft music began floating through the room. Y/N turned away from the window to look at him. The smile on her face nearly stopped him in his tracks, and Chris was once again struck by just how quickly he was falling for this woman. He forced the fluttering in his stomach to subside and made his way towards her.</p><p>\u201cWanna dance?\u201d he asked, holding a hand out to her.</p><p>An almost panicked look formed on her face. \u201cI-I don\u2019t know how to dance?\u201d</p><p>He smiled and took her hand in his. \u201cI\u2019ll teach you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. You\u2019re funeral.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her into the empty space in the middle of the room before placing a hand on the small of her back and pulling her closer. He studied her y/e/c eyes as they swayed gently to the music. They were so beautiful. They spoke of kindness, and love, and everything Chris had ever hoped to find in life. He could see his future in those eyes, a thought that terrified him almost as much as it excited him.</p><p>The music swelled, and Chris lifted his hand above their heads, leading her into an unexpected turn that had Y/N tripping over her feet in an attempt to keep up with him. She fumbled a bit and landed against Chris\u2019 chest with a thud.</p><p>\u201cYou really have a problem with balance don\u2019t you?\u201d he teased.</p><p>Y/N just laughed. \u201cYeah. Mom always said there was a reason my middle name is Grace.\u201d</p><p>The sound of her laugh made Chris feel lighter, and he soon found himself laughing along with her. As their laughter died, he held her a little tighter and reached up to brush a strand of hair out of her eyes. His fingertips tingle where they grazed her skin. He was certain that if he died in that moment, he\u2019d die a happy man.</p><p>He leaned forward, slanting his lips against hers in a gentle kiss that betrayed the overwhelming rush of emotion that surged through him at her touch.</p><hr><p>Chris\u2019 kiss was intoxicating. It sent Y/N reeling. She was halfway convinced that she would have fallen if it weren\u2019t for Chris\u2019 arms still wrapped around her. She tilted her head to the side and deepen the kiss with a sigh</p><p>She wanted to stay like this forever. Everything else was just falling away until the only thing that existed was the two of them and the mind numbingly wonderful feeling of contentment that came with being in Chris\u2019 arms.</p><p>An excited yip from the space beside them forced them apart. Chris looked down to see Dodger jumping up on his leg for attention. They looked at each other and laughed.</p><p>\u201cGetting jealous bud?\u201d Chris asked. The dog leaned into his hand before sitting back on the floor.</p><p>Y/N smiled sweetly to herself as she watched the two interact. When Chris straightened, he tried to apologize for the interruption, but she assured him it was fine. He took her hand and lead her back into the dance. It wasn\u2019t long before she found herself being drawn back in by his eyes. Her heart accelerated when he lifted a hand to run his thumb back and forth across her cheek before leaning in for another kiss.</p><p>This one was disappointingly brief. Chris pulled away just as she was about to lose herself all over again. A momentary tinge of disappointment ran through her when he stepped away. Her first thought was that she had done something wrong, but the seductive smile forming on Chris\u2019 lips told another story. He had been every bit as affected by their kiss as she had.</p><p>\u201cDo, uh,\u201d he stopped to clear his throat and looked away, effectively breaking the spell Y/N had found herself under, \u201cdo you want to step outside for a bit? Get some air?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. Maybe some fresh air would help clear away the fog she kept finding herself in when he was around. \u201cSounds great.\u201d</p><p>Chris placed a hand on the small of her back and motioned her towards the sliding glass door that lead out onto the balcony.</p><p>The crisp air made Y/N shiver. She started rubbing her arms for warmth when a blanket was draped over her shoulders. She looked back to see Chris smiling down at her.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a gentle smile while running his hands up and down her arms to warm her. \u201cDo you want to sit down?\u201d He motioned towards the lounge chairs she hadn\u2019t noticed when she first stepped through the door.</p><p>Chris made himself busy with the small gas fire pit, lighting a fire before taking a seat on the opposite chair. Even with the warmth from the fire, it wasn\u2019t long before Y/N noticed him rubbing his arms from time to time. Y/N started looking around for another blanket, but it quickly became clear that he\u2019d given her the only one he\u2019d brought.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to share?\u201d she asked, gesturing to him with the blanket.</p><p>A sweet smile formed on his face. \u201cSure. Come here.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach fluttered as Y/N moved over to Chris\u2019 chair. She handed him the blanket and settled between his outstretched legs. Y/N leaned back against his chest, allowing him to wrap the blanket around them both, Dodger quickly taking his place on top of her legs.</p><p>The smell of Chris\u2019 cologne surrounded her as she sank back into his arms. The combination of the warmth from the blanket and his body seeped into her.</p><p>\u201cThis is nice,\u201d she said, leaning farther back into his embrace.</p><p>\u201cYeah. It is.\u201d</p><p>They watched the twinkling lights of the city stretched out before them as they whispered back and forth about their lives, getting to know each other a bit more. Eventually the conversation petered out, and they sat in a comfortable silence, enjoying the intimacy of the moment and the comfort of the other\u2019s presence.</p><p>Y/N closed her eyes and sighed in contentment. She leaned her head back on Chris\u2019 shoulder and felt him rest his head on top of hers. The thought that she had never felt better danced a cross her mind. She never felt safer than she did in that moment with Chris arms wrapped around her.</p><p><br/></p><p><b><a

Y/N had been digging through her clothes for nearly an hour in an effort to find something to wear on her date with Chris that night.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like that one either,\u201d she heard her sister say over the video call.</p><p>She tossed the top aside and threw herself back onto the bed. \u201cYou\u2019re not helping here, Rach,\u201d she growled at the screen.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cWell it\u2019s not my fault you didn\u2019t pack any date clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know I\u2019d need them.\u201d Y/N threw her hands up in frustration.</p><p>This day was turning out to be a disaster. Y/N had practically squealed with excitement that morning when she gotten up. The thought of her date with Chris had been enough to send her to the moon and back over breakfast. Mrs. Travinski had noticed her mood over breakfast. The wylie old woman had decided to play a game of twenty questions with her. She\u2019d been so excited to learn about Y/N\u2019s date that she\u2019d practically pushed her out the door.</p><p>\u201cYou need to make sure you still have time to get ready,\u201d she\u2019d told her.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until Y/N was about half way through her round of site seeing that the reality of her situation hit her in the face.</p><p>She was going on a date. She was going on a date in Boston with one of the city\u2019s favorite sons. Surely that came with certain expectations. God, she didn\u2019t even know where he was taking her. Would it be some fancy restaurant with a private dining area just for them, or would it be another one of those local treasures he seemed to be so fond of? She just didn\u2019t know what to do.</p><p>\u201cWhere did he say he was taking you again?\u201d she heard her sister ask.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t.\u201d Y/N rolled onto her side and turned the phone so that she could see her sister.</p><p>Rachel worried her lower lip for a minute before her eyes lit up. \u201cDid you take that blue tunic dress looking thing with you?\u201d</p><p>The top Rachel was referring to was one of Y/N\u2019s favorites. She always kept it in reserve for days when she wasn\u2019t really feeling herself. It\u2019s soft material and flattering lines always made her feel better.</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about leggings do you have those?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe point Rach,\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cGo try them on.\u201d <i>This isn\u2019t going to work.</i></p><p>She stopped short when she spotted herself in the mirror after putting on the outfit her sister suggested. The deep blue of the top accentuated the color of her eyes and gave her skin a healthy glow. The simple black leggings dressed it up beautifully. It was nothing fancy, but it was exactly what she needed.</p><p>\u201cLet me see!\u201d Y/N rolled her eyes and retrieved her phone, holding it up so that her sister could see the mirror. \u201cLooks good. I told you it would work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know you love me.\u201d</p><p>Y/N grinned and rolled her eyes. Yay younger siblings. She glanced over at the clock 6:30. She didn\u2019t have time to waste if she was going to be ready on time. She quickly bid her sister goodbye and started racing around her suite. She\u2019d just finished putting on the last stitch of makeup when a knock sounded on her door followed by the sound of Mrs. Travinski\u2019s voice announcing that her young man was here.</p><hr><p>It was everything Chris could do to keep from fidgeting while he waited for Y/N to come downstairs, but nothing was working. He kept fiddling with the ribbon on the bouquet he\u2019d brought her, and his feet wouldn\u2019t stay still. He kept shifting his weight from foot to foot, pacing a few steps here and there for good measure.</p><p>He\u2019d spent all day running around, getting everything ready for tonight. Things that should only have taken a few minutes took nearly half an hour. Chris kept finding himself going in circles. Running over the most insignificant details over and over again until he\u2019d been forced to take Dodger on a long walk to clear his mind.</p><p>The sound of feet on the stairs drew his attention. Chris closed his eyes and took a deep breath. <i>Come on, Chris. Get it together.</i> Opening his eyes, he turned to she the older woman that had greeted him when he first walked through the door coming down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be down in just a minute,\u201d she said. Her kind age-wizzled eyes gazing up at him. \u201cYou\u2019re a nice looking boy.\u201d Chris smiled in thanks. \u201cYou take good care of her now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a smile before turning and walking away. Chris watched her go before turning his eyes back towards the stairs and doing a double take.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d he breathed.</p><p>In all his years of extravagant Hollywood parties and glitzy premiers, Chris couldn\u2019t remember ever seeing anyone look as beautiful as Y/N did in that moment. It was like she was lit from within. Not even a glittering ball gown would hold a candle to the way she looked in her simple tunic and boots.</p><p>\u201cYou look amazing,\u201d he said, walking up to great her as her foot hit the landing.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She looked down and tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. She gestured towards the flowers. \u201cAre those for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, uh, yeah. Here.\u201d He thrust the forgotten flowers into her face.</p><p>He half expected her to frown and back away at his less than smooth gesture, but she just smiled and thanked him.</p><p>Y/N looked around awkwardly. \u201cUmm\u2026\u201d</p><p><i>Shit</i>. He hadn\u2019t thought about her not having a place to keep them.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d a voice from across the room said. Chris turned his head to see the older woman approaching them with a vase in her hand. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of those. You two go have a good time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mrs Travinski,\u201d Y/N said with a smile. She handed the woman her bouquet before turning her attention back to Chris.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Y/N nodded. Chris grabbed her coat off of the rack near the door and held it out for her. He couldn\u2019t help but notice the slightest hint of a blush on her cheeks when she thanked him. Once she had her coat on, Chris offered her his arm to lead her out to the car.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Y/N asked once they were away from her temporary home, \u201cwhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, uh,\u201d Chris swallowed around the lump in his throat. In all his careful planning, he hadn\u2019t stopped to think about her opinion on his plan for their date.\u00a0\u201cI thought this might be a good time to cook you that meal I promised you a while back.\u201d He cast a quick glance over at Y/N just in time to see her eyes grow wide.\u00a0</p><p>Chris wanted to kick himself in the teeth. He stopped at a red light and squeezed his eyes closed for a moment.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to,\u201d he added, slowly opening his eyes and turning them towards her. \u201cWe can go anywhere you want. Just say the word and\u2026\u201d His rambling was cut short by the feeling of her hand resting on his arm.</p><p>\u201cChris, it\u2019s okay.\u201d She gave him a sweet smile. \u201cThat sounds great. You just surprised me is all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood surprise?\u201d he asked, the hope that he hadn\u2019t ruined the date before it began clear in his voice.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cGood surprise.\u201d</p><p>He gave a sigh of relief and smiled over at her. It was going to be a good night. He could feel it.</p><hr><p>An unexpected flurry of nerves rushed through her when Chris pulled into the private garage attached to his apartment building. The thought of spending the evening completely alone with Chris sent a thrill through her that she wasn\u2019t sure how to describe. She\u2019d been nervous when he first suggested it, but her excitement quickly outweighed it. Chris had proven to her on more than one occasion that he was a good man.She would never have agreed to the date if she thought otherwise..</p><p>Chris got out of the car and made his way around to get the door. Accepting his offered hand, Y/N thanked him before taking his hand and letting him lead her to what she could only assume was a private elevator since it required a key and a special code to work.</p><p>As the elevator continued to rise, Y/N\u2019s nerves returned. It had been so long since she\u2019d been on a real date, let alone one as intimate as this. What if she did something wrong?</p><p>The elevator dinged, and the door slid open to reveal the most breathtaking view of the city she could imagine. A audible gasp left her lips as she took a step into the open concept apartment. The floor to ceiling windows that made up the opposite wall of the condo offered one of the most spectacular views she had ever seen and made the space feel much larger than it was. The lights of the city twinkled to her in greeting. Her heels clicked against the wooden floor as she moved farther into the room.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she heard Chris say softly behind her. \u201cThe view was one of the key selling points.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see why.\u201d</p><p>An excited yip and the sound of nails clacking on the hardwood floor filled the room. Y/N turned to see Dodger rounding the corner. The excited pup made a beeline straight towards Chris, receiving a scratch on the head before turning his attention to Y/N. She squatted down to give him some attention.</p><p>\u201cHello boy.\u201d</p><p>She rose to her feet and turned to find Chris standing a few feet away, his hands in his pockets and an easy smile on his lips. Y/N\u2019s heart gave a little flutter when he stepped forward and brought a hand up to brush a strand of hair behind her ear before leaning in ever so slightly. She pulled her bottom lip between her teeth and started to lean forward to met him when the sound of a door closing to her left followed by the sound of footsteps made her jump. Someone else was there.</p><p>Chris grabbed her by the shoulder and pulled her behind him. A shiver of fear ran down her spine and she took a trembling step closer to him. Chris kept an arm extended behind him to shield her as he took a step forward. Y/N\u2019s fist clinched the back of his shirt to keep him close. A scream lodged in her throat when a man with spiky blonde hair came around the corner of the kitchen, he head slowly coming up to look at them.</p><p>Chris immediately relaxed at the sight of him. \u201cWhat the fuck, Scott?!\u201d he yelled.</p><p>Y/N let go of the back of his shirt and looked back and forth between the two men, her mind frantically trying to make sense of the situation.</p><p>\u201cWell hello to you too big brother,\u201d Scott said, taking a step towards him. He looked at Y/N over his brother\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I scared you. I didn\u2019t know anyone else would be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d she said, stepping out from behind Chris. \u201cNo worries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? I can\u2019t just want to see you?\u201d Scott grabbed a handful of nuts from the container of mixed nuts on the counter and started munching away.</p><p>\u201cThat key is for emergencies, Scott,\u201d Chris chastened. \u201cNot so you can break in and eat my food.\u201d</p><p>Scott shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll call next time.\u201d His eyes locked on Y/N. \u201cI really am sorry. Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>Y/N waved him off with a smile.\u00a0She\u2019d been watching their exchange in silence. Seeing Chris so flustered was actually pretty amusing. The way his Bostonian accent thickened when he was berating his younger brother made her smile. She\u2019d heard bits and pieces of it here and there, but it had never been like that before. She liked it.</p><p>\u201cIs this the girl?\u201d Scott asked. Y/N had to put a hand over her mouth to stifle a laugh at the almost murderous look Chris gave him. Scott moved past Chris and held his hand out towards her. \u201cMy brother won\u2019t shut up about you. I\u2019m Scott by the way. Since he seems to have lost all of his manners and won\u2019t introduce me. Ma would be so pissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said, shaking his hand, \u201cI\u2019m Y/N.\u201d Chris rolled his eyes behind is brother\u2019s back, making her bite her lower lip to keep her laughter in check. \u201cPleased to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScott,\u201d Chris groaned, running a hand down his face.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mind?\u201d</p><p>Chris gesturing towards the door, but Scott didn\u2019t move. Chris gestured again, his mouth forming a grim line. Scott looked from his brother to the woman beside him and back again.</p><p>\u201cOh, is this a date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Chris huffed. \u201cSo could you please?\u201d He made a fluttering gesture with his hands.</p><p>Y/N watched with a rueful smile on her face as Chris escorted his younger brother to the door.</p><p>\u201cSee you guys later,\u201d he called.</p><p>\u201cBye, Scott,\u201d Y/N called cheerfully. \u201cIt was nice meeting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too.\u201d He stepped into the waiting elevator before turning his attention to Chris. \u201cYou,\u201d he pointed at his brother, \u201cuse a condom.\u201d</p><p>Y/N couldn\u2019t hold it back anymore and burst into laughter when she saw the murderous expression cross Chris\u2019 face while his brother grinned back at him in cheeky satisfaction behind the slowly closing door.</p><hr><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry about that,\u201d Chris said for what felt like the millionth time since his brother left.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t believe Scott had shown up like that. Well, maybe he could, but he should have realized what was going on and left sooner. Chris heard Y/N giggle behind him and turned away from the pasta sauce he had been stirring to see her sitting on the other side of the island watching him, a hint of amusement on her face. She\u2019d taken a seat on one of the barstools to watch him cook after he shoo\u2019ed her out of the kitchen with the assurance that he had everything under control.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she assured him. \u201cYour brother\u2019s really funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has his moments.\u201d Chris looked back down at the stove. \u201cI think it\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get the plates.\u201d</p><p>Chris waved her off. \u201cNo. I\u2019ve got it. If you\u2019ll just grab the wine we\u2019ll be all set.\u201d Chris nodded towards the bottle of wine he\u2019d pulled out for them earlier.</p><p>He drained the pasta and grabbed a couple plates from the cabinet. Putting a heaping serving of pasta and sauce on each, he motioned for Y/N to follow him to the table near the bank of windows. The table was small, only four chairs, so Chris sat the plates on either end of the table before pulling out Y/N\u2019s chair for her.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she whispered, sitting the wine glasses down next to the plates.</p><p>Chris smiled and nodded before pushing in her chair. He poured them each a glass of wine and moving around to his seat. He was half seated when he looked up and spotted something missing from the table.</p><p>He held up a finger. \u201cJust a second.\u201d</p><p>He walked back over to the kitchen, nearly tripping over Dodger in the process, and started rummaging through the drawers for a lighter. He couldn\u2019t believe that he\u2019d forgotten to light the candles. <i>You can\u2019t have a candlelight dinner without candles, dumbass.</i></p><p>\u201cAh ha.\u201d He held the lighter over his head in triumph. \u201cGot it.\u201d</p><p>Chris smiled over at Y/N as he lit the candles.</p><p>\u201cHow romantic,\u201d she teased.</p><p>Chris shrugged. He\u2019d never made it a secret that he was a romantic at heart. His only goal for the evening was to make Y/N feel special, and if the smile on her face was any indication, he was doing a great job so far.</p><p>They ate in a comfortable silence, broken up here and there with easy conversation. It made Chris glad he decided to cook for her instead of going out somewhere. He was never able to really relax in a restaurant. There were too many prying eyes and ears just waiting for a juicy bit of information they could sell to the tabloids. This was better. They could talk without having to worry about anyone but themselves. It was perfect.</p><p>\u201cThis sauce is really good,\u201d Y/N said. \u201cHow\u2019d you learn to cook?\u201d</p><p>Chris couldn\u2019t keep the note of pride out of his voice. \u201cI\u2019m glad you like it. Ma taught me. She taught all of us actually. She wanted us all to know how to cook so we wouldn\u2019t starve to death once we left the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart woman.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, an adoring grin on his face. \u201cShe is.\u201d</p><p>They finished eating, and Chris cleared away the dishes, depositing them in the sink for later. When he turned around, he found Y/N looking out across the city with Dodger planted at her feet. A smile formed on his face. Three of the things he loved most in the world in one image. His city, his dog, and his girl. He shook the thought from his mind. Thinking like that this early in the relationship wouldn\u2019t do either of them any good. He needed to pump the breaks and give it time.</p><p>Chris found the remote for the sound system sitting on one of the end tables and clicked it on. Soft music began floating through the room. Y/N turned away from the window to look at him. The smile on her face nearly stopped him in his tracks, and Chris was once again struck by just how quickly he was falling for this woman. He forced the fluttering in his stomach to subside and made his way towards her.</p><p>\u201cWanna dance?\u201d he asked, holding a hand out to her.</p><p>An almost panicked look formed on her face. \u201cI-I don\u2019t know how to dance?\u201d</p><p>He smiled and took her hand in his. \u201cI\u2019ll teach you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. You\u2019re funeral.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her into the empty space in the middle of the room before placing a hand on the small of her back and pulling her closer. He studied her y/e/c eyes as they swayed gently to the music. They were so beautiful. They spoke of kindness, and love, and everything Chris had ever hoped to find in life. He could see his future in those eyes, a thought that terrified him almost as much as it excited him.</p><p>The music swelled, and Chris lifted his hand above their heads, leading her into an unexpected turn that had Y/N tripping over her feet in an attempt to keep up with him. She fumbled a bit and landed against Chris\u2019 chest with a thud.</p><p>\u201cYou really have a problem with balance don\u2019t you?\u201d he teased.</p><p>Y/N just laughed. \u201cYeah. Mom always said there was a reason my middle name is Grace.\u201d</p><p>The sound of her laugh made Chris feel lighter, and he soon found himself laughing along with her. As their laughter died, he held her a little tighter and reached up to brush a strand of hair out of her eyes. His fingertips tingle where they grazed her skin. He was certain that if he died in that moment, he\u2019d die a happy man.</p><p>He leaned forward, slanting his lips against hers in a gentle kiss that betrayed the overwhelming rush of emotion that surged through him at her touch.</p><hr><p>Chris\u2019 kiss was intoxicating. It sent Y/N reeling. She was halfway convinced that she would have fallen if it weren\u2019t for Chris\u2019 arms still wrapped around her. She tilted her head to the side and deepen the kiss with a sigh</p><p>She wanted to stay like this forever. Everything else was just falling away until the only thing that existed was the two of them and the mind numbingly wonderful feeling of contentment that came with being in Chris\u2019 arms.</p><p>An excited yip from the space beside them forced them apart. Chris looked down to see Dodger jumping up on his leg for attention. They looked at each other and laughed.</p><p>\u201cGetting jealous bud?\u201d Chris asked. The dog leaned into his hand before sitting back on the floor.</p><p>Y/N smiled sweetly to herself as she watched the two interact. When Chris straightened, he tried to apologize for the interruption, but she assured him it was fine. He took her hand and lead her back into the dance. It wasn\u2019t long before she found herself being drawn back in by his eyes. Her heart accelerated when he lifted a hand to run his thumb back and forth across her cheek before leaning in for another kiss.</p><p>This one was disappointingly brief. Chris pulled away just as she was about to lose herself all over again. A momentary tinge of disappointment ran through her when he stepped away. Her first thought was that she had done something wrong, but the seductive smile forming on Chris\u2019 lips told another story. He had been every bit as affected by their kiss as she had.</p><p>\u201cDo, uh,\u201d he stopped to clear his throat and looked away, effectively breaking the spell Y/N had found herself under, \u201cdo you want to step outside for a bit? Get some air?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. Maybe some fresh air would help clear away the fog she kept finding herself in when he was around. \u201cSounds great.\u201d</p><p>Chris placed a hand on the small of her back and motioned her towards the sliding glass door that lead out onto the balcony.</p><p>The crisp air made Y/N shiver. She started rubbing her arms for warmth when a blanket was draped over her shoulders. She looked back to see Chris smiling down at her.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a gentle smile while running his hands up and down her arms to warm her. \u201cDo you want to sit down?\u201d He motioned towards the lounge chairs she hadn\u2019t noticed when she first stepped through the door.</p><p>Chris made himself busy with the small gas fire pit, lighting a fire before taking a seat on the opposite chair. Even with the warmth from the fire, it wasn\u2019t long before Y/N noticed him rubbing his arms from time to time. Y/N started looking around for another blanket, but it quickly became clear that he\u2019d given her the only one he\u2019d brought.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to share?\u201d she asked, gesturing to him with the blanket.</p><p>A sweet smile formed on his face. \u201cSure. Come here.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach fluttered as Y/N moved over to Chris\u2019 chair. She handed him the blanket and settled between his outstretched legs. Y/N leaned back against his chest, allowing him to wrap the blanket around them both, Dodger quickly taking his place on top of her legs.</p><p>The smell of Chris\u2019 cologne surrounded her as she sank back into his arms. The combination of the warmth from the blanket and his body seeped into her.</p><p>\u201cThis is nice,\u201d she said, leaning farther back into his embrace.</p><p>\u201cYeah. It is.\u201d</p><p>They watched the twinkling lights of the city stretched out before them as they whispered back and forth about their lives, getting to know each other a bit more. Eventually the conversation petered out, and they sat in a comfortable silence, enjoying the intimacy of the moment and the comfort of the other\u2019s presence.</p><p>Y/N closed her eyes and sighed in contentment. She leaned her head back on Chris\u2019 shoulder and felt him rest his head on top of hers. The thought that she had never felt better danced a cross her mind. She never felt safer than she did in that moment with Chris arms wrapped around her.</p><p><br></p><p><b><a

One week all by yourself in the big city of Boston. No rules. No expectations. Just a list of places to go and things you wanted to see. That all changed when you run into a certain blue-eyed Boston boy who turned your world upside down. Is it really possible to fall in love with someone in just one week? Or is that kind of love just a fairytale?</p><p>Warning: language</p><p>Word Count:\t4100</p><p>Author\u2019s Note: Hey guys! I\u2019m so excited to be able to update this story for you guys.

Y/N had been digging through her clothes for nearly an hour in an effort to find something to wear on her date with Chris that night.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like that one either,\u201d she heard her sister say over the video call.</p><p>She tossed the top aside and threw herself back onto the bed. \u201cYou\u2019re not helping here, Rach,\u201d she growled at the screen.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cWell it\u2019s not my fault you didn\u2019t pack any date clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know I\u2019d need them.\u201d Y/N threw her hands up in frustration.</p><p>This day was turning out to be a disaster. Y/N had practically squealed with excitement that morning when she gotten up. The thought of her date with Chris had been enough to send her to the moon and back over breakfast. Mrs. Travinski had noticed her mood over breakfast. The wylie old woman had decided to play a game of twenty questions with her. She\u2019d been so excited to learn about Y/N\u2019s date that she\u2019d practically pushed her out the door.</p><p>\u201cYou need to make sure you still have time to get ready,\u201d she\u2019d told her.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until Y/N was about half way through her round of site seeing that the reality of her situation hit her in the face.</p><p>She was going on a date. She was going on a date in Boston with one of the city\u2019s favorite sons. Surely that came with certain expectations. God, she didn\u2019t even know where he was taking her. Would it be some fancy restaurant with a private dining area just for them, or would it be another one of those local treasures he seemed to be so fond of? She just didn\u2019t know what to do.</p><p>\u201cWhere did he say he was taking you again?\u201d she heard her sister ask.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t.\u201d Y/N rolled onto her side and turned the phone so that she could see her sister.</p><p>Rachel worried her lower lip for a minute before her eyes lit up. \u201cDid you take that blue tunic dress looking thing with you?\u201d</p><p>The top Rachel was referring to was one of Y/N\u2019s favorites. She always kept it in reserve for days when she wasn\u2019t really feeling herself. It\u2019s soft material and flattering lines always made her feel better.</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about leggings do you have those?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe point Rach,\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cGo try them on.\u201d <i>This isn\u2019t going to work.</i></p><p>She stopped short when she spotted herself in the mirror after putting on the outfit her sister suggested. The deep blue of the top accentuated the color of her eyes and gave her skin a healthy glow. The simple black leggings dressed it up beautifully. It was nothing fancy, but it was exactly what she needed.</p><p>\u201cLet me see!\u201d Y/N rolled her eyes and retrieved her phone, holding it up so that her sister could see the mirror. \u201cLooks good. I told you it would work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know you love me.\u201d</p><p>Y/N grinned and rolled her eyes. Yay younger siblings. She glanced over at the clock 6:30. She didn\u2019t have time to waste if she was going to be ready on time. She quickly bid her sister goodbye and started racing around her suite. She\u2019d just finished putting on the last stitch of makeup when a knock sounded on her door followed by the sound of Mrs. Travinski\u2019s voice announcing that her young man was here.</p><hr><p>It was everything Chris could do to keep from fidgeting while he waited for Y/N to come downstairs, but nothing was working. He kept fiddling with the ribbon on the bouquet he\u2019d brought her, and his feet wouldn\u2019t stay still. He kept shifting his weight from foot to foot, pacing a few steps here and there for good measure.</p><p>He\u2019d spent all day running around, getting everything ready for tonight. Things that should only have taken a few minutes took nearly half an hour. Chris kept finding himself going in circles. Running over the most insignificant details over and over again until he\u2019d been forced to take Dodger on a long walk to clear his mind.</p><p>The sound of feet on the stairs drew his attention. Chris closed his eyes and took a deep breath. <i>Come on, Chris. Get it together.</i> Opening his eyes, he turned to she the older woman that had greeted him when he first walked through the door coming down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be down in just a minute,\u201d she said. Her kind age-wizzled eyes gazing up at him. \u201cYou\u2019re a nice looking boy.\u201d Chris smiled in thanks. \u201cYou take good care of her now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a smile before turning and walking away. Chris watched her go before turning his eyes back towards the stairs and doing a double take.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d he breathed.</p><p>In all his years of extravagant Hollywood parties and glitzy premiers, Chris couldn\u2019t remember ever seeing anyone look as beautiful as Y/N did in that moment. It was like she was lit from within. Not even a glittering ball gown would hold a candle to the way she looked in her simple tunic and boots.</p><p>\u201cYou look amazing,\u201d he said, walking up to great her as her foot hit the landing.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She looked down and tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. She gestured towards the flowers. \u201cAre those for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, uh, yeah. Here.\u201d He thrust the forgotten flowers into her face.</p><p>He half expected her to frown and back away at his less than smooth gesture, but she just smiled and thanked him.</p><p>Y/N looked around awkwardly. \u201cUmm\u2026\u201d</p><p><i>Shit</i>. He hadn\u2019t thought about her not having a place to keep them.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d a voice from across the room said. Chris turned his head to see the older woman approaching them with a vase in her hand. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of those. You two go have a good time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mrs Travinski,\u201d Y/N said with a smile. She handed the woman her bouquet before turning her attention back to Chris.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Y/N nodded. Chris grabbed her coat off of the rack near the door and held it out for her. He couldn\u2019t help but notice the slightest hint of a blush on her cheeks when she thanked him. Once she had her coat on, Chris offered her his arm to lead her out to the car.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Y/N asked once they were away from her temporary home, \u201cwhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, uh,\u201d Chris swallowed around the lump in his throat. In all his careful planning, he hadn\u2019t stopped to think about her opinion on his plan for their date.\u00a0\u201cI thought this might be a good time to cook you that meal I promised you a while back.\u201d He cast a quick glance over at Y/N just in time to see her eyes grow wide.\u00a0</p><p>Chris wanted to kick himself in the teeth. He stopped at a red light and squeezed his eyes closed for a moment.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to,\u201d he added, slowly opening his eyes and turning them towards her. \u201cWe can go anywhere you want. Just say the word and\u2026\u201d His rambling was cut short by the feeling of her hand resting on his arm.</p><p>\u201cChris, it\u2019s okay.\u201d She gave him a sweet smile. \u201cThat sounds great. You just surprised me is all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood surprise?\u201d he asked, the hope that he hadn\u2019t ruined the date before it began clear in his voice.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cGood surprise.\u201d</p><p>He gave a sigh of relief and smiled over at her. It was going to be a good night. He could feel it.</p><hr><p>An unexpected flurry of nerves rushed through her when Chris pulled into the private garage attached to his apartment building. The thought of spending the evening completely alone with Chris sent a thrill through her that she wasn\u2019t sure how to describe. She\u2019d been nervous when he first suggested it, but her excitement quickly outweighed it. Chris had proven to her on more than one occasion that he was a good man.She would never have agreed to the date if she thought otherwise..</p><p>Chris got out of the car and made his way around to get the door. Accepting his offered hand, Y/N thanked him before taking his hand and letting him lead her to what she could only assume was a private elevator since it required a key and a special code to work.</p><p>As the elevator continued to rise, Y/N\u2019s nerves returned. It had been so long since she\u2019d been on a real date, let alone one as intimate as this. What if she did something wrong?</p><p>The elevator dinged, and the door slid open to reveal the most breathtaking view of the city she could imagine. A audible gasp left her lips as she took a step into the open concept apartment. The floor to ceiling windows that made up the opposite wall of the condo offered one of the most spectacular views she had ever seen and made the space feel much larger than it was. The lights of the city twinkled to her in greeting. Her heels clicked against the wooden floor as she moved farther into the room.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she heard Chris say softly behind her. \u201cThe view was one of the key selling points.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see why.\u201d</p><p>An excited yip and the sound of nails clacking on the hardwood floor filled the room. Y/N turned to see Dodger rounding the corner. The excited pup made a beeline straight towards Chris, receiving a scratch on the head before turning his attention to Y/N. She squatted down to give him some attention.</p><p>\u201cHello boy.\u201d</p><p>She rose to her feet and turned to find Chris standing a few feet away, his hands in his pockets and an easy smile on his lips. Y/N\u2019s heart gave a little flutter when he stepped forward and brought a hand up to brush a strand of hair behind her ear before leaning in ever so slightly. She pulled her bottom lip between her teeth and started to lean forward to met him when the sound of a door closing to her left followed by the sound of footsteps made her jump. Someone else was there.</p><p>Chris grabbed her by the shoulder and pulled her behind him. A shiver of fear ran down her spine and she took a trembling step closer to him. Chris kept an arm extended behind him to shield her as he took a step forward. Y/N\u2019s fist clinched the back of his shirt to keep him close. A scream lodged in her throat when a man with spiky blonde hair came around the corner of the kitchen, he head slowly coming up to look at them.</p><p>Chris immediately relaxed at the sight of him. \u201cWhat the fuck, Scott?!\u201d he yelled.</p><p>Y/N let go of the back of his shirt and looked back and forth between the two men, her mind frantically trying to make sense of the situation.</p><p>\u201cWell hello to you too big brother,\u201d Scott said, taking a step towards him. He looked at Y/N over his brother\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I scared you. I didn\u2019t know anyone else would be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d she said, stepping out from behind Chris. \u201cNo worries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? I can\u2019t just want to see you?\u201d Scott grabbed a handful of nuts from the container of mixed nuts on the counter and started munching away.</p><p>\u201cThat key is for emergencies, Scott,\u201d Chris chastened. \u201cNot so you can break in and eat my food.\u201d</p><p>Scott shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll call next time.\u201d His eyes locked on Y/N. \u201cI really am sorry. Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>Y/N waved him off with a smile.\u00a0She\u2019d been watching their exchange in silence. Seeing Chris so flustered was actually pretty amusing. The way his Bostonian accent thickened when he was berating his younger brother made her smile. She\u2019d heard bits and pieces of it here and there, but it had never been like that before. She liked it.</p><p>\u201cIs this the girl?\u201d Scott asked. Y/N had to put a hand over her mouth to stifle a laugh at the almost murderous look Chris gave him. Scott moved past Chris and held his hand out towards her. \u201cMy brother won\u2019t shut up about you. I\u2019m Scott by the way. Since he seems to have lost all of his manners and won\u2019t introduce me. Ma would be so pissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said, shaking his hand, \u201cI\u2019m Y/N.\u201d Chris rolled his eyes behind is brother\u2019s back, making her bite her lower lip to keep her laughter in check. \u201cPleased to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScott,\u201d Chris groaned, running a hand down his face.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mind?\u201d</p><p>Chris gesturing towards the door, but Scott didn\u2019t move. Chris gestured again, his mouth forming a grim line. Scott looked from his brother to the woman beside him and back again.</p><p>\u201cOh, is this a date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Chris huffed. \u201cSo could you please?\u201d He made a fluttering gesture with his hands.</p><p>Y/N watched with a rueful smile on her face as Chris escorted his younger brother to the door.</p><p>\u201cSee you guys later,\u201d he called.</p><p>\u201cBye, Scott,\u201d Y/N called cheerfully. \u201cIt was nice meeting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too.\u201d He stepped into the waiting elevator before turning his attention to Chris. \u201cYou,\u201d he pointed at his brother, \u201cuse a condom.\u201d</p><p>Y/N couldn\u2019t hold it back anymore and burst into laughter when she saw the murderous expression cross Chris\u2019 face while his brother grinned back at him in cheeky satisfaction behind the slowly closing door.</p><hr><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry about that,\u201d Chris said for what felt like the millionth time since his brother left.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t believe Scott had shown up like that. Well, maybe he could, but he should have realized what was going on and left sooner. Chris heard Y/N giggle behind him and turned away from the pasta sauce he had been stirring to see her sitting on the other side of the island watching him, a hint of amusement on her face. She\u2019d taken a seat on one of the barstools to watch him cook after he shoo\u2019ed her out of the kitchen with the assurance that he had everything under control.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she assured him. \u201cYour brother\u2019s really funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has his moments.\u201d Chris looked back down at the stove. \u201cI think it\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get the plates.\u201d</p><p>Chris waved her off. \u201cNo. I\u2019ve got it. If you\u2019ll just grab the wine we\u2019ll be all set.\u201d Chris nodded towards the bottle of wine he\u2019d pulled out for them earlier.</p><p>He drained the pasta and grabbed a couple plates from the cabinet. Putting a heaping serving of pasta and sauce on each, he motioned for Y/N to follow him to the table near the bank of windows. The table was small, only four chairs, so Chris sat the plates on either end of the table before pulling out Y/N\u2019s chair for her.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she whispered, sitting the wine glasses down next to the plates.</p><p>Chris smiled and nodded before pushing in her chair. He poured them each a glass of wine and moving around to his seat. He was half seated when he looked up and spotted something missing from the table.</p><p>He held up a finger. \u201cJust a second.\u201d</p><p>He walked back over to the kitchen, nearly tripping over Dodger in the process, and started rummaging through the drawers for a lighter. He couldn\u2019t believe that he\u2019d forgotten to light the candles. <i>You can\u2019t have a candlelight dinner without candles, dumbass.</i></p><p>\u201cAh ha.\u201d He held the lighter over his head in triumph. \u201cGot it.\u201d</p><p>Chris smiled over at Y/N as he lit the candles.</p><p>\u201cHow romantic,\u201d she teased.</p><p>Chris shrugged. He\u2019d never made it a secret that he was a romantic at heart. His only goal for the evening was to make Y/N feel special, and if the smile on her face was any indication, he was doing a great job so far.</p><p>They ate in a comfortable silence, broken up here and there with easy conversation. It made Chris glad he decided to cook for her instead of going out somewhere. He was never able to really relax in a restaurant. There were too many prying eyes and ears just waiting for a juicy bit of information they could sell to the tabloids. This was better. They could talk without having to worry about anyone but themselves. It was perfect.</p><p>\u201cThis sauce is really good,\u201d Y/N said. \u201cHow\u2019d you learn to cook?\u201d</p><p>Chris couldn\u2019t keep the note of pride out of his voice. \u201cI\u2019m glad you like it. Ma taught me. She taught all of us actually. She wanted us all to know how to cook so we wouldn\u2019t starve to death once we left the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart woman.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, an adoring grin on his face. \u201cShe is.\u201d</p><p>They finished eating, and Chris cleared away the dishes, depositing them in the sink for later. When he turned around, he found Y/N looking out across the city with Dodger planted at her feet. A smile formed on his face. Three of the things he loved most in the world in one image. His city, his dog, and his girl. He shook the thought from his mind. Thinking like that this early in the relationship wouldn\u2019t do either of them any good. He needed to pump the breaks and give it time.</p><p>Chris found the remote for the sound system sitting on one of the end tables and clicked it on. Soft music began floating through the room. Y/N turned away from the window to look at him. The smile on her face nearly stopped him in his tracks, and Chris was once again struck by just how quickly he was falling for this woman. He forced the fluttering in his stomach to subside and made his way towards her.</p><p>\u201cWanna dance?\u201d he asked, holding a hand out to her.</p><p>An almost panicked look formed on her face. \u201cI-I don\u2019t know how to dance?\u201d</p><p>He smiled and took her hand in his. \u201cI\u2019ll teach you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. You\u2019re funeral.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her into the empty space in the middle of the room before placing a hand on the small of her back and pulling her closer. He studied her y/e/c eyes as they swayed gently to the music. They were so beautiful. They spoke of kindness, and love, and everything Chris had ever hoped to find in life. He could see his future in those eyes, a thought that terrified him almost as much as it excited him.</p><p>The music swelled, and Chris lifted his hand above their heads, leading her into an unexpected turn that had Y/N tripping over her feet in an attempt to keep up with him. She fumbled a bit and landed against Chris\u2019 chest with a thud.</p><p>\u201cYou really have a problem with balance don\u2019t you?\u201d he teased.</p><p>Y/N just laughed. \u201cYeah. Mom always said there was a reason my middle name is Grace.\u201d</p><p>The sound of her laugh made Chris feel lighter, and he soon found himself laughing along with her. As their laughter died, he held her a little tighter and reached up to brush a strand of hair out of her eyes. His fingertips tingle where they grazed her skin. He was certain that if he died in that moment, he\u2019d die a happy man.</p><p>He leaned forward, slanting his lips against hers in a gentle kiss that betrayed the overwhelming rush of emotion that surged through him at her touch.</p><hr><p>Chris\u2019 kiss was intoxicating. It sent Y/N reeling. She was halfway convinced that she would have fallen if it weren\u2019t for Chris\u2019 arms still wrapped around her. She tilted her head to the side and deepen the kiss with a sigh</p><p>She wanted to stay like this forever. Everything else was just falling away until the only thing that existed was the two of them and the mind numbingly wonderful feeling of contentment that came with being in Chris\u2019 arms.</p><p>An excited yip from the space beside them forced them apart. Chris looked down to see Dodger jumping up on his leg for attention. They looked at each other and laughed.</p><p>\u201cGetting jealous bud?\u201d Chris asked. The dog leaned into his hand before sitting back on the floor.</p><p>Y/N smiled sweetly to herself as she watched the two interact. When Chris straightened, he tried to apologize for the interruption, but she assured him it was fine. He took her hand and lead her back into the dance. It wasn\u2019t long before she found herself being drawn back in by his eyes. Her heart accelerated when he lifted a hand to run his thumb back and forth across her cheek before leaning in for another kiss.</p><p>This one was disappointingly brief. Chris pulled away just as she was about to lose herself all over again. A momentary tinge of disappointment ran through her when he stepped away. Her first thought was that she had done something wrong, but the seductive smile forming on Chris\u2019 lips told another story. He had been every bit as affected by their kiss as she had.</p><p>\u201cDo, uh,\u201d he stopped to clear his throat and looked away, effectively breaking the spell Y/N had found herself under, \u201cdo you want to step outside for a bit? Get some air?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. Maybe some fresh air would help clear away the fog she kept finding herself in when he was around. \u201cSounds great.\u201d</p><p>Chris placed a hand on the small of her back and motioned her towards the sliding glass door that lead out onto the balcony.</p><p>The crisp air made Y/N shiver. She started rubbing her arms for warmth when a blanket was draped over her shoulders. She looked back to see Chris smiling down at her.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a gentle smile while running his hands up and down her arms to warm her. \u201cDo you want to sit down?\u201d He motioned towards the lounge chairs she hadn\u2019t noticed when she first stepped through the door.</p><p>Chris made himself busy with the small gas fire pit, lighting a fire before taking a seat on the opposite chair. Even with the warmth from the fire, it wasn\u2019t long before Y/N noticed him rubbing his arms from time to time. Y/N started looking around for another blanket, but it quickly became clear that he\u2019d given her the only one he\u2019d brought.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to share?\u201d she asked, gesturing to him with the blanket.</p><p>A sweet smile formed on his face. \u201cSure. Come here.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach fluttered as Y/N moved over to Chris\u2019 chair. She handed him the blanket and settled between his outstretched legs. Y/N leaned back against his chest, allowing him to wrap the blanket around them both, Dodger quickly taking his place on top of her legs.</p><p>The smell of Chris\u2019 cologne surrounded her as she sank back into his arms. The combination of the warmth from the blanket and his body seeped into her.</p><p>\u201cThis is nice,\u201d she said, leaning farther back into his embrace.</p><p>\u201cYeah. It is.\u201d</p><p>They watched the twinkling lights of the city stretched out before them as they whispered back and forth about their lives, getting to know each other a bit more. Eventually the conversation petered out, and they sat in a comfortable silence, enjoying the intimacy of the moment and the comfort of the other\u2019s presence.</p><p>Y/N closed her eyes and sighed in contentment. She leaned her head back on Chris\u2019 shoulder and felt him rest his head on top of hers. The thought that she had never felt better danced a cross her mind. She never felt safer than she did in that moment with Chris arms wrapped around her.</p><p><br></p><p><b><a

One week all by yourself in the big city of Boston. No rules. No expectations. Just a list of places to go and things you wanted to see. That all changed when you run into a certain blue-eyed Boston boy who turned your world upside down. Is it really possible to fall in love with someone in just one week? Or is that kind of love just a fairytale?</p><p>Warning: language</p><p>Word Count:\t4100</p><p>Author&rsquo;s Note: Hey guys! I&rsquo;m so excited to be able to update this story for you guys.

Y/N had been digging through her clothes for nearly an hour in an effort to find something to wear on her date with Chris that night.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like that one either,&rdquo; she heard her sister say over the video call.</p><p>She tossed the top aside and threw herself back onto the bed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not helping here, Rach,&rdquo; she growled at the screen.</p><p>&ldquo;Well it&rsquo;s not my fault you didn&rsquo;t pack any date clothes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know I&rsquo;d need them.&rdquo; Y/N threw her hands up in frustration.</p><p>This day was turning out to be a disaster. Y/N had practically squealed with excitement that morning when she gotten up. The thought of her date with Chris had been enough to send her to the moon and back over breakfast. Mrs. Travinski had noticed her mood over breakfast. The wylie old woman had decided to play a game of twenty questions with her. She&rsquo;d been so excited to learn about Y/N&rsquo;s date that she&rsquo;d practically pushed her out the door.</p><p>&ldquo;You need to make sure you still have time to get ready,&rdquo; she&rsquo;d told her.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t until Y/N was about half way through her round of site seeing that the reality of her situation hit her in the face.</p><p>She was going on a date. She was going on a date in Boston with one of the city&rsquo;s favorite sons. Surely that came with certain expectations. God, she didn&rsquo;t even know where he was taking her. Would it be some fancy restaurant with a private dining area just for them, or would it be another one of those local treasures he seemed to be so fond of? She just didn&rsquo;t know what to do.</p><p>&ldquo;Where did he say he was taking you again?&rdquo; she heard her sister ask.</p><p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Y/N rolled onto her side and turned the phone so that she could see her sister.</p><p>Rachel worried her lower lip for a minute before her eyes lit up. &ldquo;Did you take that blue tunic dress looking thing with you?&rdquo;</p><p>The top Rachel was referring to was one of Y/N&rsquo;s favorites. She always kept it in reserve for days when she wasn&rsquo;t really feeling herself. It&rsquo;s soft material and flattering lines always made her feel better.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How about leggings do you have those?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The point Rach,&rdquo; she demanded.</p><p>&ldquo;Go try them on.&rdquo; <i>This isn&rsquo;t going to work.</i></p><p>She stopped short when she spotted herself in the mirror after putting on the outfit her sister suggested. The deep blue of the top accentuated the color of her eyes and gave her skin a healthy glow. The simple black leggings dressed it up beautifully. It was nothing fancy, but it was exactly what she needed.</p><p>&ldquo;Let me see!&rdquo; Y/N rolled her eyes and retrieved her phone, holding it up so that her sister could see the mirror. &ldquo;Looks good. I told you it would work.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Whatever.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You know you love me.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N grinned and rolled her eyes. Yay younger siblings. She glanced over at the clock 6:30. She didn&rsquo;t have time to waste if she was going to be ready on time. She quickly bid her sister goodbye and started racing around her suite. She&rsquo;d just finished putting on the last stitch of makeup when a knock sounded on her door followed by the sound of Mrs. Travinski&rsquo;s voice announcing that her young man was here.</p><hr /><p>It was everything Chris could do to keep from fidgeting while he waited for Y/N to come downstairs, but nothing was working. He kept fiddling with the ribbon on the bouquet he&rsquo;d brought her, and his feet wouldn&rsquo;t stay still. He kept shifting his weight from foot to foot, pacing a few steps here and there for good measure.</p><p>He&rsquo;d spent all day running around, getting everything ready for tonight. Things that should only have taken a few minutes took nearly half an hour. Chris kept finding himself going in circles. Running over the most insignificant details over and over again until he&rsquo;d been forced to take Dodger on a long walk to clear his mind.</p><p>The sound of feet on the stairs drew his attention. Chris closed his eyes and took a deep breath. <i>Come on, Chris. Get it together.</i> Opening his eyes, he turned to she the older woman that had greeted him when he first walked through the door coming down the stairs.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be down in just a minute,&rdquo; she said. Her kind age-wizzled eyes gazing up at him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a nice looking boy.&rdquo; Chris smiled in thanks. &ldquo;You take good care of her now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p><p>She gave him a smile before turning and walking away. Chris watched her go before turning his eyes back towards the stairs and doing a double take.</p><p>&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; he breathed.</p><p>In all his years of extravagant Hollywood parties and glitzy premiers, Chris couldn&rsquo;t remember ever seeing anyone look as beautiful as Y/N did in that moment. It was like she was lit from within. Not even a glittering ball gown would hold a candle to the way she looked in her simple tunic and boots.</p><p>&ldquo;You look amazing,&rdquo; he said, walking up to great her as her foot hit the landing.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; She looked down and tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. She gestured towards the flowers. &ldquo;Are those for me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, uh, yeah. Here.&rdquo; He thrust the forgotten flowers into her face.</p><p>He half expected her to frown and back away at his less than smooth gesture, but she just smiled and thanked him.</p><p>Y/N looked around awkwardly. &ldquo;Umm&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p><i>Shit</i>. He hadn&rsquo;t thought about her not having a place to keep them.</p><p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; a voice from across the room said. Chris turned his head to see the older woman approaching them with a vase in her hand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of those. You two go have a good time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mrs Travinski,&rdquo; Y/N said with a smile. She handed the woman her bouquet before turning her attention back to Chris.</p><p>&ldquo;Ready?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>Y/N nodded. Chris grabbed her coat off of the rack near the door and held it out for her. He couldn&rsquo;t help but notice the slightest hint of a blush on her cheeks when she thanked him. Once she had her coat on, Chris offered her his arm to lead her out to the car.</p><p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Y/N asked once they were away from her temporary home, &ldquo;where are we going?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I, uh,&rdquo; Chris swallowed around the lump in his throat. In all his careful planning, he hadn&rsquo;t stopped to think about her opinion on his plan for their date.&nbsp;&ldquo;I thought this might be a good time to cook you that meal I promised you a while back.&rdquo; He cast a quick glance over at Y/N just in time to see her eyes grow wide.&nbsp;</p><p>Chris wanted to kick himself in the teeth. He stopped at a red light and squeezed his eyes closed for a moment.</p><p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have to,&rdquo; he added, slowly opening his eyes and turning them towards her. &ldquo;We can go anywhere you want. Just say the word and&hellip;&rdquo; His rambling was cut short by the feeling of her hand resting on his arm.</p><p>&ldquo;Chris, it&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo; She gave him a sweet smile. &ldquo;That sounds great. You just surprised me is all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good surprise?&rdquo; he asked, the hope that he hadn&rsquo;t ruined the date before it began clear in his voice.</p><p>She nodded. &ldquo;Good surprise.&rdquo;</p><p>He gave a sigh of relief and smiled over at her. It was going to be a good night. He could feel it.</p><hr /><p>An unexpected flurry of nerves rushed through her when Chris pulled into the private garage attached to his apartment building. The thought of spending the evening completely alone with Chris sent a thrill through her that she wasn&rsquo;t sure how to describe. She&rsquo;d been nervous when he first suggested it, but her excitement quickly outweighed it. Chris had proven to her on more than one occasion that he was a good man.She would never have agreed to the date if she thought otherwise..</p><p>Chris got out of the car and made his way around to get the door. Accepting his offered hand, Y/N thanked him before taking his hand and letting him lead her to what she could only assume was a private elevator since it required a key and a special code to work.</p><p>As the elevator continued to rise, Y/N&rsquo;s nerves returned. It had been so long since she&rsquo;d been on a real date, let alone one as intimate as this. What if she did something wrong?</p><p>The elevator dinged, and the door slid open to reveal the most breathtaking view of the city she could imagine. A audible gasp left her lips as she took a step into the open concept apartment. The floor to ceiling windows that made up the opposite wall of the condo offered one of the most spectacular views she had ever seen and made the space feel much larger than it was. The lights of the city twinkled to her in greeting. Her heels clicked against the wooden floor as she moved farther into the room.</p><p>&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; she breathed.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; she heard Chris say softly behind her. &ldquo;The view was one of the key selling points.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can see why.&rdquo;</p><p>An excited yip and the sound of nails clacking on the hardwood floor filled the room. Y/N turned to see Dodger rounding the corner. The excited pup made a beeline straight towards Chris, receiving a scratch on the head before turning his attention to Y/N. She squatted down to give him some attention.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello boy.&rdquo;</p><p>She rose to her feet and turned to find Chris standing a few feet away, his hands in his pockets and an easy smile on his lips. Y/N&rsquo;s heart gave a little flutter when he stepped forward and brought a hand up to brush a strand of hair behind her ear before leaning in ever so slightly. She pulled her bottom lip between her teeth and started to lean forward to met him when the sound of a door closing to her left followed by the sound of footsteps made her jump. Someone else was there.</p><p>Chris grabbed her by the shoulder and pulled her behind him. A shiver of fear ran down her spine and she took a trembling step closer to him. Chris kept an arm extended behind him to shield her as he took a step forward. Y/N&rsquo;s fist clinched the back of his shirt to keep him close. A scream lodged in her throat when a man with spiky blonde hair came around the corner of the kitchen, he head slowly coming up to look at them.</p><p>Chris immediately relaxed at the sight of him. &ldquo;What the fuck, Scott?!&rdquo; he yelled.</p><p>Y/N let go of the back of his shirt and looked back and forth between the two men, her mind frantically trying to make sense of the situation.</p><p>&ldquo;Well hello to you too big brother,&rdquo; Scott said, taking a step towards him. He looked at Y/N over his brother&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I scared you. I didn&rsquo;t know anyone else would be here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; she said, stepping out from behind Chris. &ldquo;No worries.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What the hell are you doing here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What? I can&rsquo;t just want to see you?&rdquo; Scott grabbed a handful of nuts from the container of mixed nuts on the counter and started munching away.</p><p>&ldquo;That key is for emergencies, Scott,&rdquo; Chris chastened. &ldquo;Not so you can break in and eat my food.&rdquo;</p><p>Scott shrugged. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call next time.&rdquo; His eyes locked on Y/N. &ldquo;I really am sorry. Are you okay?&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N waved him off with a smile.&nbsp;She&rsquo;d been watching their exchange in silence. Seeing Chris so flustered was actually pretty amusing. The way his Bostonian accent thickened when he was berating his younger brother made her smile. She&rsquo;d heard bits and pieces of it here and there, but it had never been like that before. She liked it.</p><p>&ldquo;Is this the girl?&rdquo; Scott asked. Y/N had to put a hand over her mouth to stifle a laugh at the almost murderous look Chris gave him. Scott moved past Chris and held his hand out towards her. &ldquo;My brother won&rsquo;t shut up about you. I&rsquo;m Scott by the way. Since he seems to have lost all of his manners and won&rsquo;t introduce me. Ma would be so pissed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; she said, shaking his hand, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Y/N.&rdquo; Chris rolled his eyes behind is brother&rsquo;s back, making her bite her lower lip to keep her laughter in check. &ldquo;Pleased to meet you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Scott,&rdquo; Chris groaned, running a hand down his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you mind?&rdquo;</p><p>Chris gesturing towards the door, but Scott didn&rsquo;t move. Chris gestured again, his mouth forming a grim line. Scott looked from his brother to the woman beside him and back again.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, is this a date?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Chris huffed. &ldquo;So could you please?&rdquo; He made a fluttering gesture with his hands.</p><p>Y/N watched with a rueful smile on her face as Chris escorted his younger brother to the door.</p><p>&ldquo;See you guys later,&rdquo; he called.</p><p>&ldquo;Bye, Scott,&rdquo; Y/N called cheerfully. &ldquo;It was nice meeting you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You too.&rdquo; He stepped into the waiting elevator before turning his attention to Chris. &ldquo;You,&rdquo; he pointed at his brother, &ldquo;use a condom.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N couldn&rsquo;t hold it back anymore and burst into laughter when she saw the murderous expression cross Chris&rsquo; face while his brother grinned back at him in cheeky satisfaction behind the slowly closing door.</p><hr /><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry about that,&rdquo; Chris said for what felt like the millionth time since his brother left.</p><p>He couldn&rsquo;t believe Scott had shown up like that. Well, maybe he could, but he should have realized what was going on and left sooner. Chris heard Y/N giggle behind him and turned away from the pasta sauce he had been stirring to see her sitting on the other side of the island watching him, a hint of amusement on her face. She&rsquo;d taken a seat on one of the barstools to watch him cook after he shoo&rsquo;ed her out of the kitchen with the assurance that he had everything under control.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; she assured him. &ldquo;Your brother&rsquo;s really funny.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He has his moments.&rdquo; Chris looked back down at the stove. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s done.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get the plates.&rdquo;</p><p>Chris waved her off. &ldquo;No. I&rsquo;ve got it. If you&rsquo;ll just grab the wine we&rsquo;ll be all set.&rdquo; Chris nodded towards the bottle of wine he&rsquo;d pulled out for them earlier.</p><p>He drained the pasta and grabbed a couple plates from the cabinet. Putting a heaping serving of pasta and sauce on each, he motioned for Y/N to follow him to the table near the bank of windows. The table was small, only four chairs, so Chris sat the plates on either end of the table before pulling out Y/N&rsquo;s chair for her.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; she whispered, sitting the wine glasses down next to the plates.</p><p>Chris smiled and nodded before pushing in her chair. He poured them each a glass of wine and moving around to his seat. He was half seated when he looked up and spotted something missing from the table.</p><p>He held up a finger. &ldquo;Just a second.&rdquo;</p><p>He walked back over to the kitchen, nearly tripping over Dodger in the process, and started rummaging through the drawers for a lighter. He couldn&rsquo;t believe that he&rsquo;d forgotten to light the candles. <i>You can&rsquo;t have a candlelight dinner without candles, dumbass.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Ah ha.&rdquo; He held the lighter over his head in triumph. &ldquo;Got it.&rdquo;</p><p>Chris smiled over at Y/N as he lit the candles.</p><p>&ldquo;How romantic,&rdquo; she teased.</p><p>Chris shrugged. He&rsquo;d never made it a secret that he was a romantic at heart. His only goal for the evening was to make Y/N feel special, and if the smile on her face was any indication, he was doing a great job so far.</p><p>They ate in a comfortable silence, broken up here and there with easy conversation. It made Chris glad he decided to cook for her instead of going out somewhere. He was never able to really relax in a restaurant. There were too many prying eyes and ears just waiting for a juicy bit of information they could sell to the tabloids. This was better. They could talk without having to worry about anyone but themselves. It was perfect.</p><p>&ldquo;This sauce is really good,&rdquo; Y/N said. &ldquo;How&rsquo;d you learn to cook?&rdquo;</p><p>Chris couldn&rsquo;t keep the note of pride out of his voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you like it. Ma taught me. She taught all of us actually. She wanted us all to know how to cook so we wouldn&rsquo;t starve to death once we left the house.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Smart woman.&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded, an adoring grin on his face. &ldquo;She is.&rdquo;</p><p>They finished eating, and Chris cleared away the dishes, depositing them in the sink for later. When he turned around, he found Y/N looking out across the city with Dodger planted at her feet. A smile formed on his face. Three of the things he loved most in the world in one image. His city, his dog, and his girl. He shook the thought from his mind. Thinking like that this early in the relationship wouldn&rsquo;t do either of them any good. He needed to pump the breaks and give it time.</p><p>Chris found the remote for the sound system sitting on one of the end tables and clicked it on. Soft music began floating through the room. Y/N turned away from the window to look at him. The smile on her face nearly stopped him in his tracks, and Chris was once again struck by just how quickly he was falling for this woman. He forced the fluttering in his stomach to subside and made his way towards her.</p><p>&ldquo;Wanna dance?&rdquo; he asked, holding a hand out to her.</p><p>An almost panicked look formed on her face. &ldquo;I-I don&rsquo;t know how to dance?&rdquo;</p><p>He smiled and took her hand in his. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll teach you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay. You&rsquo;re funeral.&rdquo;</p><p>He pulled her into the empty space in the middle of the room before placing a hand on the small of her back and pulling her closer. He studied her y/e/c eyes as they swayed gently to the music. They were so beautiful. They spoke of kindness, and love, and everything Chris had ever hoped to find in life. He could see his future in those eyes, a thought that terrified him almost as much as it excited him.</p><p>The music swelled, and Chris lifted his hand above their heads, leading her into an unexpected turn that had Y/N tripping over her feet in an attempt to keep up with him. She fumbled a bit and landed against Chris&rsquo; chest with a thud.</p><p>&ldquo;You really have a problem with balance don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he teased.</p><p>Y/N just laughed. &ldquo;Yeah. Mom always said there was a reason my middle name is Grace.&rdquo;</p><p>The sound of her laugh made Chris feel lighter, and he soon found himself laughing along with her. As their laughter died, he held her a little tighter and reached up to brush a strand of hair out of her eyes. His fingertips tingle where they grazed her skin. He was certain that if he died in that moment, he&rsquo;d die a happy man.</p><p>He leaned forward, slanting his lips against hers in a gentle kiss that betrayed the overwhelming rush of emotion that surged through him at her touch.</p><hr /><p>Chris&rsquo; kiss was intoxicating. It sent Y/N reeling. She was halfway convinced that she would have fallen if it weren&rsquo;t for Chris&rsquo; arms still wrapped around her. She tilted her head to the side and deepen the kiss with a sigh</p><p>She wanted to stay like this forever. Everything else was just falling away until the only thing that existed was the two of them and the mind numbingly wonderful feeling of contentment that came with being in Chris&rsquo; arms.</p><p>An excited yip from the space beside them forced them apart. Chris looked down to see Dodger jumping up on his leg for attention. They looked at each other and laughed.</p><p>&ldquo;Getting jealous bud?&rdquo; Chris asked. The dog leaned into his hand before sitting back on the floor.</p><p>Y/N smiled sweetly to herself as she watched the two interact. When Chris straightened, he tried to apologize for the interruption, but she assured him it was fine. He took her hand and lead her back into the dance. It wasn&rsquo;t long before she found herself being drawn back in by his eyes. Her heart accelerated when he lifted a hand to run his thumb back and forth across her cheek before leaning in for another kiss.</p><p>This one was disappointingly brief. Chris pulled away just as she was about to lose herself all over again. A momentary tinge of disappointment ran through her when he stepped away. Her first thought was that she had done something wrong, but the seductive smile forming on Chris&rsquo; lips told another story. He had been every bit as affected by their kiss as she had.</p><p>&ldquo;Do, uh,&rdquo; he stopped to clear his throat and looked away, effectively breaking the spell Y/N had found herself under, &ldquo;do you want to step outside for a bit? Get some air?&rdquo;</p><p>She nodded. Maybe some fresh air would help clear away the fog she kept finding herself in when he was around. &ldquo;Sounds great.&rdquo;</p><p>Chris placed a hand on the small of her back and motioned her towards the sliding glass door that lead out onto the balcony.</p><p>The crisp air made Y/N shiver. She started rubbing her arms for warmth when a blanket was draped over her shoulders. She looked back to see Chris smiling down at her.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>He gave her a gentle smile while running his hands up and down her arms to warm her. &ldquo;Do you want to sit down?&rdquo; He motioned towards the lounge chairs she hadn&rsquo;t noticed when she first stepped through the door.</p><p>Chris made himself busy with the small gas fire pit, lighting a fire before taking a seat on the opposite chair. Even with the warmth from the fire, it wasn&rsquo;t long before Y/N noticed him rubbing his arms from time to time. Y/N started looking around for another blanket, but it quickly became clear that he&rsquo;d given her the only one he&rsquo;d brought.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want to share?&rdquo; she asked, gesturing to him with the blanket.</p><p>A sweet smile formed on his face. &ldquo;Sure. Come here.&rdquo;</p><p>Her stomach fluttered as Y/N moved over to Chris&rsquo; chair. She handed him the blanket and settled between his outstretched legs. Y/N leaned back against his chest, allowing him to wrap the blanket around them both, Dodger quickly taking his place on top of her legs.</p><p>The smell of Chris&rsquo; cologne surrounded her as she sank back into his arms. The combination of the warmth from the blanket and his body seeped into her.</p><p>&ldquo;This is nice,&rdquo; she said, leaning farther back into his embrace.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. It is.&rdquo;</p><p>They watched the twinkling lights of the city stretched out before them as they whispered back and forth about their lives, getting to know each other a bit more. Eventually the conversation petered out, and they sat in a comfortable silence, enjoying the intimacy of the moment and the comfort of the other&rsquo;s presence.</p><p>Y/N closed her eyes and sighed in contentment. She leaned her head back on Chris&rsquo; shoulder and felt him rest his head on top of hers. The thought that she had never felt better danced a cross her mind.

One week all by yourself in the big city of Boston. No rules. No expectations. Just a list of places to go and things you wanted to see. That all changed when you run into a certain blue-eyed Boston boy who turned your world upside down. Is it really possible to fall in love with someone in just one week? Or is that kind of love just a fairytale?</p>\n<p>Warning: language</p>\n<p>Word Count:\t4100</p>\n<p>Author&rsquo;s Note: Hey guys! I&rsquo;m so excited to be able to update this story for you guys.
