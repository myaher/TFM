Dearest Taylor, \"I'll be there (like I always have been) if you're the toast of the town or if you strike out.\" I make Taylor edits and appreciation posts \u2605Here to hopefully get noticed by the queen of my heart and soul herself\u2605 Also here to support and give a whole bunch of love to fellow gorgeous swiftlets. At the Pittsburgh show Taylor was so close and I think she waved at me. Do you remember me Taylor?! I was in the blue TS shirt with Mer and Olivia on it and you sang Getaway Car right in front of me.

I heard Love Story on the radio and I\u2019ve been hooked ever since.<br/>\nIn 2009 my best friend at the time, Nick, surprised me with nosebleed tickets to see you for the Fearless tour at Key Arena, in Seattle! It was my first big concert and I was completely shocked with the ending rain song, Should\u2019ve Said No! In 2011 I saw you at the Tacoma Dome (Seattle) with my mom\u2019s friend\u2019s daughter, Savanna, for Speak Now. Taylor Nation upgraded some girls, so they found us near the back, and upgraded us to their close, side view seats! What a dream that was!<br/>\nIn 2013 you came back to the Tacoma Dome for the Red tour. Personally, I believe Red is a masterpiece! I went with my friend from work, Oak, and we made our own T-shirt\u2019s! In 2015 you upgraded your stage to Century Link Field, in Seattle, for 1989! I had never had better seats, in the lower bowl. I went with three friends from work, Haily, Saul, and Gabby, and dressed up as a baker! I was a touch disappointed that I didn\u2019t get chosen for Loft 89, because I had recently learned that you did that! I had been a fan for ages, but not active in the fandom at all on tumblr, and didn\u2019t have a Twitter yet. Anyways, I had THE BEST time at 1989, you really outdid yourself.<br/>\nA few weeks after 1989 Seattle, you followed me on tumblr! I was so happy, I couldn\u2019t believe it! You had met my friend Erica in Seattle and you also followed her on tumblr, and I was on a list she made for you of dedicated swifties to follow. I\u2019ll forever be thankful that you clicked \u201cfollow\u201d and most likely saw my icon as a picture of me in my baker costume for 1989. <br/>\nWhen reputation came out, I lost my damn mind! It was so different and good and different, I just couldn\u2019t wait to hear it live! So when I heard on the radio that you were headlining Poptopia! in San Jose, I knew I HAD to get tickets! When I did, they were even better than my 1989 tickets in Seattle! I took my sister, Haley (who used to sing and dance along with me to Fearless when I drove her around in high school), and we seriously had the best time! I was completely in awe of you and your set of six songs.<br/>\nNow comes the recent part! For reputation I saw you in Glendale, Pasadena, and Seattle! For Glendale I went with my mom, aunt, grandma, and sister, and we all had custom shirts that I made. It was an absolute dream to be at the first show of tour! I bawled when you sang All Too Well and was in complete shock when you mashed up Should\u2019ve Said No and Bad Blood! I had a baby Twitter account at this point and posted my family\u2019s shirts, and was amazed that people were tweeting for us to meet you! This fandom is so kind.<br/>\nI had the privilege of seeing you twice in Pasadena! My sister, Haley, lives in LA, so that was a good excuse! I went with her, and her friend to night one, and bawled again when you played Red. Red is one of my all time favorites of yours, and I never thought I would hear it acoustic, so thank you so much for that. And what a surprise when you brought out Shawn Mendes!<br/>\nNight two in Pasadena was my first concert alone! I met up with some friends from Twitter though, which was so nice! It was also my first time on the floor at one of your shows! Omg, that was an insane show! All Too Well again for the surprise, and honestly, I was so close to the stage and you! I was right near the end of one of the catwalks, with no one in front of me! Wow, that\u2019s the only way I want to experience a show from now on. I wish! Troye Sivan and Selena Gomez were there too?! Unreal.<br/>\nThe last show for me was my hometown show, Seattle! I had floor seats again with my friends Catherine and Kevin! Kevin flew from Philadelphia to see you with us! We met some local swifties I had followed for a while, and they took us to the b-stage for Dress and Blank Space! I was front row, right when you sang Dress and just about died. And I loved hearing you sing Holy Ground that night!<br/>\nI was a bit sad after Seattle, because I really wanted to thank you for always being here for me, and it was my last show. But, a few weeks later, some swiftie friends that I had met in Pasadena, convinced me to come with them to Pittsburgh! I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m going to see you five times this tour! I am so thankful for what you have done for me, for what you have thought me, and for the friends you\u2019ve brought into my life. I hope, one day, I can thank for for all this in person. Let\u2019s make a date for Pittsburgh?<br/>\nLove you, Forever &amp; Always (that\u2019s my all time favorite song of yours, by the way),<br/>\nErin <br/><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzlqFgYPhDbBo0OlTSyWY3g\" target=\"_blank\">@taylornation</a></p>",

Kevin flew from Philadelphia to see you with us! We met some local swifties I had followed for a while, and they took us to the b-stage for Dress and Blank Space! I was front row, right when you sang Dress and just about died. And I loved hearing you sing Holy Ground that night!<br>\nI was a bit sad after Seattle, because I really wanted to thank you for always being here for me, and it was my last show. But, a few weeks later, some swiftie friends that I had met in Pasadena, convinced me to come with them to Pittsburgh! I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m going to see you five times this tour! I am so thankful for what you have done for me, for what you have thought me, and for the friends you\u2019ve brought into my life. I hope, one day, I can thank for for all this in person. Let\u2019s make a date for Pittsburgh?<br>\nLove you, Forever &amp; Always (that\u2019s my all time favorite song of yours, by the way),<br>\nErin <br><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzlqFgYPhDbBo0OlTSyWY3g\" target=\"_blank\">@taylornation</a></p>",
                "content": "<p>Hey, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mV4Fl3h9EtbA_AoZ0ZPG8QQ\" target=\"_blank\">@taylorswift</a><br />\nWe&rsquo;ve been together for a long time now (though maybe you don&rsquo;t know that!), but I&rsquo;ve been so lucky to have you as a role model since 2008! I heard Love Story on the radio and I&rsquo;ve been hooked ever since.<br />\nIn 2009 my best friend at the time, Nick, surprised me with nosebleed tickets to see you for the Fearless tour at Key Arena, in Seattle! It was my first big concert and I was completely shocked with the ending rain song, Should&rsquo;ve Said No! In 2011 I saw you at the Tacoma Dome (Seattle) with my mom&rsquo;s friend&rsquo;s daughter, Savanna, for Speak Now. Taylor Nation upgraded some girls, so they found us near the back, and upgraded us to their close, side view seats! What a dream that was!<br />\nIn 2013 you came back to the Tacoma Dome for the Red tour. Personally, I believe Red is a masterpiece! I went with my friend from work, Oak, and we made our own T-shirt&rsquo;s! In 2015 you upgraded your stage to Century Link Field, in Seattle, for 1989! I had never had better seats, in the lower bowl. I went with three friends from work, Haily, Saul, and Gabby, and dressed up as a baker! I was a touch disappointed that I didn&rsquo;t get chosen for Loft 89, because I had recently learned that you did that! I had been a fan for ages, but not active in the fandom at all on tumblr, and didn&rsquo;t have a Twitter yet. Anyways, I had THE BEST time at 1989, you really outdid yourself.<br />\nA few weeks after 1989 Seattle, you followed me on tumblr! I was so happy, I couldn&rsquo;t believe it! You had met my friend Erica in Seattle and you also followed her on tumblr, and I was on a list she made for you of dedicated swifties to follow. I&rsquo;ll forever be thankful that you clicked &ldquo;follow&rdquo; and most likely saw my icon as a picture of me in my baker costume for 1989. <br />\nWhen reputation came out, I lost my damn mind! It was so different and good and different, I just couldn&rsquo;t wait to hear it live! So when I heard on the radio that you were headlining Poptopia! in San Jose, I knew I HAD to get tickets! When I did, they were even better than my 1989 tickets in Seattle! I took my sister, Haley (who used to sing and dance along with me to Fearless when I drove her around in high school), and we seriously had the best time! I was completely in awe of you and your set of six songs.<br />\nNow comes the recent part! For reputation I saw you in Glendale, Pasadena, and Seattle! For Glendale I went with my mom, aunt, grandma, and sister, and we all had custom shirts that I made. It was an absolute dream to be at the first show of tour! I bawled when you sang All Too Well and was in complete shock when you mashed up Should&rsquo;ve Said No and Bad Blood! I had a baby Twitter account at this point and posted my family&rsquo;s shirts, and was amazed that people were tweeting for us to meet you! This fandom is so kind.<br />\nI had the privilege of seeing you twice in Pasadena! My sister, Haley, lives in LA, so that was a good excuse! I went with her, and her friend to night one, and bawled again when you played Red. Red is one of my all time favorites of yours, and I never thought I would hear it acoustic, so thank you so much for that. And what a surprise when you brought out Shawn Mendes!<br />\nNight two in Pasadena was my first concert alone! I met up with some friends from Twitter though, which was so nice! It was also my first time on the floor at one of your shows! Omg, that was an insane show! All Too Well again for the surprise, and honestly, I was so close to the stage and you! I was right near the end of one of the catwalks, with no one in front of me! Wow, that&rsquo;s the only way I want to experience a show from now on. I wish! Troye Sivan and Selena Gomez were there too?! Unreal.<br />\nThe last show for me was my hometown show, Seattle! I had floor seats again with my friends Catherine and Kevin!
