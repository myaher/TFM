Really expensive one. And it needs to be more sweet than bitter. Because HBO still wants to make money on it after finale airing. And when you are unhappy, you will stop watching. Making a lof of people unhappy, you make a lot of people to stop watching and encourage others to watch.</p><p>2. Shipping is important. HBO is not CW but some groups really increase studio\u2019s earnings. They can kill some of couples but not all. If they try, they will follow Martin\u2019s instructions. And in that case Martin cannot decline. If there is a lot of complaints, D&amp;D just told the truth and these ends up very nasty. Remember Castle? After all these producers and cast drama, everyone lose- studio, Fillion and Katic. And it wasn\u2019t that expensive show. Well, Martin can be millioner and he has a lot of fanboys but these kind of scandal would smell really bad for years. Like Nightflyers - flop and disaster (if you wanna watch sth really good try Expanse, in my opinion Corey is better writer than Martin). Better say: Yeah, finale is so cheesy, I will write it better.<br/></p><p>3. I remember leaks about episode 3. We burried half of the cast on Saturday. All those extras, collegues, cleaners etc. And we lost two additional guys. I don\u2019t count Lyanna Mormont, she was more Internet meme than part of the cast. Theon died as a hero, everyone cried but let be honest, what dickless, former traitor, on a redemption road guy can do in generation\u2019s saga? And Jorah - the example of friendzone, make Daenerys fragile. Fun fact - I think that Jorah will died of greyscale in books and it would be Barristan Selmy who will die during Winterfell battle. But you know, Iain Glenn is much more handsome so they kinda swing their fates.</p><p>4. I also remember two things - the article when I read that they even hire some of crew as extras in 8x06 to increase safety and NCW\u2019s duck. That was perfect trolling from actor, always get me laugh. Don\u2019t analize what they said or what they wrote, no one wants lose their job.</p><p>5. I admit episode 4 was shitty. I think it\u2019s because first three episodes was still in the Winds of Winter and three others would be Dream of spring (or like first Martin\u2019s draft said ,,Time for wolves\u201d). D&amp;D just want put the characters in final stage really quickly and they just cross out point by point like in you shop list. It doesn\u2019t exactly work because character must developed through time. Jaime\u2019s case is perfect example. I can understand that not all redemption road can be success (although sex scene I think was just for Braimie fans), and he could has some concers and doubts and eventually come back to Cersei but not during one episode! Even half of it! BTW I love Bronn in these. ,,Well, we have different path for Sam, what can we do with Reach, we cut all the Tyrells?\u201d ,,Give it to Bronn, everyone likes him, everone will be happy\u201d. Sorry, but it could be also case for Gendry and Arya, they have more important (and longer) relationship in two last books but D&amp;D just cut it short in their list.</p><p>6. On the other thing knowing that Tyrion get his head cut (what is actually really possible) I think it would be enough bitter for studio. Audience wants a baby, at least one. I don\u2019t think Gilly\u2019s count. For now Daenerys not be shown beeing pregnant, her realtionship with Jon is still to incest for standards, Sansa with Tyrion\u2019s death and lonely Arya doesn\u2019t feel good. Well, there is always a chance of Martin\u2019s nihilism so let\u2019s see. But calmy :)</p><p>7. In the end, when we talking about best endings remember finale of ,,Six feet under\u201d - just the flash forward, where everyone dies, so great, amazing, happy but little sad, real bittersweet - just masterpiece. Also HBO.<br/></p>",

And in that case Martin cannot decline. If there is a lot of complaints, D&amp;D just told the truth and these ends up very nasty. Remember Castle? After all these producers and cast drama, everyone lose- studio, Fillion and Katic. And it wasn&rsquo;t that expensive show. Well, Martin can be millioner and he has a lot of fanboys but these kind of scandal would smell really bad for years. Like Nightflyers - flop and disaster (if you wanna watch sth really good try Expanse, in my opinion Corey is better writer than Martin). Better say: Yeah, finale is so cheesy, I will write it better.<br /></p><p>3. I remember leaks about episode 3. We burried half of the cast on Saturday. All those extras, collegues, cleaners etc. And we lost two additional guys. I don&rsquo;t count Lyanna Mormont, she was more Internet meme than part of the cast. Theon died as a hero, everyone cried but let be honest, what dickless, former traitor, on a redemption road guy can do in generation&rsquo;s saga? And Jorah - the example of friendzone, make Daenerys fragile. Fun fact - I think that Jorah will died of greyscale in books and it would be Barristan Selmy who will die during Winterfell battle. But you know, Iain Glenn is much more handsome so they kinda swing their fates.</p><p>4. I also remember two things - the article when I read that they even hire some of crew as extras in 8x06 to increase safety and NCW&rsquo;s duck. That was perfect trolling from actor, always get me laugh. Don&rsquo;t analize what they said or what they wrote, no one wants lose their job.</p><p>5. I admit episode 4 was shitty. I think it&rsquo;s because first three episodes was still in the Winds of Winter and three others would be Dream of spring (or like first Martin&rsquo;s draft said ,,Time for wolves&rdquo;). D&amp;D just want put the characters in final stage really quickly and they just cross out point by point like in you shop list. It doesn&rsquo;t exactly work because character must developed through time. Jaime&rsquo;s case is perfect example. I can understand that not all redemption road can be success (although sex scene I think was just for Braimie fans), and he could has some concers and doubts and eventually come back to Cersei but not during one episode! Even half of it! BTW I love Bronn in these. ,,Well, we have different path for Sam, what can we do with Reach, we cut all the Tyrells?&rdquo; ,,Give it to Bronn, everyone likes him, everone will be happy&rdquo;. Sorry, but it could be also case for Gendry and Arya, they have more important (and longer) relationship in two last books but D&amp;D just cut it short in their list.</p><p>6. On the other thing knowing that Tyrion get his head cut (what is actually really possible) I think it would be enough bitter for studio. Audience wants a baby, at least one. I don&rsquo;t think Gilly&rsquo;s count. For now Daenerys not be shown beeing pregnant, her realtionship with Jon is still to incest for standards, Sansa with Tyrion&rsquo;s death and lonely Arya doesn&rsquo;t feel good. Well, there is always a chance of Martin&rsquo;s nihilism so let&rsquo;s see. But calmy :)</p><p>7. In the end, when we talking about best endings remember finale of ,,Six feet under&rdquo; - just the flash forward, where everyone dies, so great, amazing, happy but little sad, real bittersweet - just masterpiece. Also HBO.<br /></p>",
