But now that Peter is here,Steve and Tony both feel protective over him. It doesn&rsquo;t help that Peter hates everyone other than Steve and tony. But as Steve and tony raise Peter, they start to fall for one another.

Knew it was because he wanted to see Peter. And Tony was tempted to do the same thing. But he managed to refrain. Ben had been very clear, he didn&rsquo;t want them involved. So Tony was making a point of not getting involved. But it was killing a small part of him, not seeing that smiling, giggling face Peter bore. It had been more than a month since Tony had seen that face. Tony shook his head, burying himself deeper into his work. That&rsquo;s when Steve walked into the workshop, and sat down on the couch. <br/>&ldquo;Hello to you too Rogers.&rdquo; Tony murmured dryly. <br/>&ldquo;Does this not bother you?&rdquo; Steve demanded and Tony sighed. <br/>&ldquo;You know it does. But Ben was very clear- we are not supposed to get involved.&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;But-&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;No buts Steve. The best thing we can do is move on and hope the kid comes back to us later on, hope he wants to be an avenger then.&rdquo; Steve sighed and shook his head. <br/>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t accept that Tony. You can&rsquo;t either, even if you won&rsquo;t admit it now. You want to go and get him as much as I do-&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;But we can do nothing Steve. Don&rsquo;t you have some mission to attend to or?&rdquo; Steve raised a brow. <br/>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re just going to pretend like the last couple of months never happened?&rdquo; Steve demanded and Tony sighed. <br/>&ldquo;What do you want me to say? That I miss a kid that was never mine? That I wish May and Ben would gain some common sense and understand that he&rsquo;d be better off here? That a part of me hates Ben for taking Peter away? Steve He isn&rsquo;t ours!&rdquo; Tony shouted and Steve shook his head. <br/>&ldquo;But you wanted him to be.&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;That was never an option. He was never going to be ours and he never will be. Now get your self righteous ass out of my workshop!&rdquo; Tony snapped and Steve shook his head. <br/>&ldquo;Why won&rsquo;t you admit that you wanted Peter?&rdquo; Steve demanded. <br/>&ldquo;Why do you care?&rdquo; Tony didn&rsquo;t want to talk about this. <br/>&ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re the only person who understands what it feels like to lose Peter.&rdquo; Steve murmured and tony sighed. <br/>&ldquo;Just go Steve. I don&rsquo;t want to talk about this. I <i>can&rsquo;t</i> talk about this. <i>Please</i>.&rdquo; Steve sighed but nodded his head. He got up and left, slamming the door shut behind him.\n\n<br/></p><hr><p>\n\nSteve was standing in the kitchen, bleary eyed and pouring milk into his cereal. He hadn&rsquo;t spoken to Tony in a week and didn&rsquo;t feel slightly inclined to talk to him today. When Peter was around&hellip; Tony seemed tolerable. Now Tony had reverted back to the same old asshole that he used to be. There was a banging at the front door and with a deep sigh, Steve went to answer it. There was a slight scar from the bullet but he had healed well. Steve opened the door to find May. Her eyes were red and swollen and she had a crying Peter on her hip. <br/>&ldquo;Take him. Please. I just can&rsquo;t-&rdquo; <br/>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Steve asked and took Peter. <br/>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be here.&rdquo; She then sprinted down the driveway, got in her car and sped off. Peter didn&rsquo;t settle, only continued to cry. <br/>&ldquo;Steve?&rdquo; It was Natasha&rsquo;s voice. But Steve had his phone out and was calling Ben. Had he gotten into a fight with May? The phone went to voicemail. This time he tried May. She didn&rsquo;t answer. <br/>&ldquo;Somethings wrong with May. She was crying and she handed Peter over and then ran&hellip;&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;Was Ben there?&rdquo; Nat asked and Steve shook his head. <br/>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t answer their phones.&rdquo; Steve made an attempt to calm Peter down but the wailing continued. <br/>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take him to Tony. Maybe his powers were too much&hellip;&rdquo; Nat nodded and Steve headed down to Tony&rsquo;s workshop. When Steve got to the workshop, coffee cups were strewn all about the place. <br/>&ldquo;Tony?&rdquo; Steve asked softly and Tony turned. Spotting Peter immediately. <br/>&ldquo;Why do you have him?&rdquo; Tony blurted and Steve handed him over. Tony hugging him immediately. <br/>&ldquo;May was crying, something&rsquo;s wrong Tony, and I can&rsquo;t get ahold of her or Ben and-&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be alright Steve. I&rsquo;ll call them and watch Peter. Maybe you should go out looking for them?&rdquo; Tony offered. <br/>&ldquo;No need.&rdquo; Nat said from the doorway. May beside her. <br/>&ldquo;May?&rdquo; Steve asked. <br/>&ldquo;I feel bad. Leaving him like that, so I turned around and I just, I can&rsquo;t do it alone.&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;Alone?&rdquo; Tony asked. <br/>&ldquo;Ben&hellip;&rdquo; May began crying and shook her head. <br/>&ldquo;What? What happened May?&rdquo; Natasha asked gently. <br/>&ldquo;They caught the guy who killed him. He&rsquo;s going to prison, but I just&hellip;I can&rsquo;t raise Peter. Not alone.&rdquo; Ben was dead. Steve shared a look with Tony. This poor woman had lost so much. <br/>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re grieving May. Why don&rsquo;t we look after Peter for a little while and you can decide later. You might just need time&hellip;&rdquo; she nodded. <br/>&ldquo;I just can&rsquo;t be here. I can&rsquo;t do this.&rdquo; And then she left with Natasha. Tony held Peter tightly to his chest and tony was watching Steve very closely. <br/>&ldquo;I know we wanted Peter to be ours but&hellip;&rdquo; Tony couldn&rsquo;t even finish the sentence. But Steve understood. <br/>&ldquo;Not like this.&rdquo; Steve agreed. <br/>&ldquo;If she really doesn&rsquo;t want him though, I&rsquo;m not going to abandon him.&rdquo; Steve nodded. <br/>&ldquo;Agreed.&rdquo; Tony sat down and studied Peter, who had mercifully stopped crying. <br/>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to have to baby proof the entire damn building.&rdquo; Tony muttered. <br/>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have to.&rdquo; Steve thought of the one place he kept secret from the avengers. <br/>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; <br/>&ldquo;I have an apartment. In Brooklyn. It&rsquo;d be easier to look after him there&hellip;&rdquo; <br/>&ldquo;Why am I only learning about this now?&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;I asked Jarvis to not say anything and&hellip;&rdquo; Steve shrugged. <br/>&ldquo;Okay, well we can baby proof your secret apartment and take shifts looking after Peter until May makes a decision.&rdquo; Steve nodded.<br/>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; This could work. This <i>would</i> work. \n\n<br/></p><hr><p>\n\nTony soon realised he and Steve had both seriously underestimated just how hard it was to look after Peter. An hour into Steve&rsquo;s first shift, Tony got a phone call requesting help. Tony had lasted a triumphant three hours before calling Steve. So now they were co-parenting. Full time. Which was strange. But the first time Tony had walked into Steve&rsquo;s apartment, it felt strange. Homey. Which was a foreign thing to Tony. There was an amazing view of the skyline, there were books and sketches and clothes everywhere. His kitchen was small and could barely fit three people in it. But it was homey. And Tony found he loved to spend time there. More than his workshop.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Okay Pete I&rsquo;m going to make us some lunch, so no climbing the walls or the roof. Okay?&rdquo; Peter giggled. It had become a routine now, they had been doing this for a couple weeks and the guilt of enjoying this vanished very quickly. Now Tony just enjoyed every second with Peter. But as much as he loved Steve&rsquo;s apartment, he hated Steve&rsquo;s couch. It was leather and old and totally uncomfortable to sleep on. He knew he could always go back to the compound to sleep, but hated the idea of leaving Peter. So tony put up with the couch while Steve slept in his bedroom. Tony opened the cupboards and found an old packet of two minute noodles. With a frown, tony decided to check the empty fridge. <br/>&ldquo;I think we need to go grocery shopping Pete.&rdquo; Tony muttered. Steve was out, training with Nat or something. It didn&rsquo;t bother Tony all that much, but it felt a little strange going grocery shopping for cap&rsquo;s kitchen. What if Tony bought the wrong cereal? And should Tony get coffee? Because Steve didn&rsquo;t even have a coffee machine here, which Tony was struggling with. It just made more sense to buy the damn coffee machine, but Tony didn&rsquo;t want to invade Steve&rsquo;s space. <br/>&ldquo;This is weird isn&rsquo;t it kid?&rdquo; Tony asked but Peter being a toddler, didn&rsquo;t respond. <br/>&ldquo;I mean, Steve and I are barely even civil and I&rsquo;m sleeping on his couch!&rdquo; Tony ran a hand through his hair. This was crazy. Tony felt tempted to run, but knew that would be stupid. They were going to make this work. For Peter. <br/>&ldquo;This is gonna work. We will make this work for you kid. So you better appreciate it when you&rsquo;re older.&rdquo; Tony told him. Peter merely smiled at tony. <br/>&ldquo;Are you even hungry?&rdquo; Tony asked. Peter merely stared and Tony sat down next to him. <br/>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been researching everything about being a good father. My dad wasn&rsquo;t good to me and if we do end up keeping you, I want to be a good father. Someone you can count on&hellip;&rdquo; Tony never wanted Peter to walk into someone else&rsquo;s home and find it strange because he had never experienced a home before. <br/>&ldquo;Tony?&rdquo; Steve swung the door open and mercifully had bought food. <br/>&ldquo;Oh thank god, we were going to starve.&rdquo; Steve rolled his eyes and placed the food down on the counter. <br/>&ldquo;I checked this morning before I left, how&rsquo;s he been today?&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;Good. I think he&rsquo;s settled into this routine. With you and me and this place.&rdquo; Steve nodded and began to put things in cupboards and in the fridge. <br/>&ldquo;I bought you some instant coffee which I know isn&rsquo;t as good as a coffee machine but-in case this doesn&rsquo;t work out, I didn&rsquo;t want to invest in a coffee machine just yet.&rdquo; It was an olive branch. Steve had bought Tony coffee. <br/>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; Steve smiled, seemingly relieved that tony wasn&rsquo;t going to argue.<br/>&ldquo;How is everyone back at the compound?&rdquo; Tony asked. <br/>&ldquo;Good. They think this is very weird but they&rsquo;ve gotten used to us not being around as much.&rdquo; Steve shrugged. <br/>&ldquo;I was thinking about swinging by later, tinkering with the suit for a bit&hellip;&rdquo; Steve nodded. <br/>&ldquo;Sure. I&rsquo;ve got no plans tonight so I&rsquo;m happy to look after the little guy.&rdquo; Steve said over his shoulder and tony nodded. <br/>&ldquo;Have you heard from May recently?&rdquo; Tony asked. <br/>&ldquo;No. Not a word. Nat checks up on her though. Makes sure she is doing alright.&rdquo; Steve murmured and Tony nodded. <br/>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t even begin to imagine what she must be feeling right now.&rdquo; Tony murmured. And a part of him hoped he would never have to go through that. That he&rsquo;d never have to experience the horror of losing those he loved the most. He already lost his parents in a car accident. <br/>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a strong woman. She&rsquo;ll get through this.&rdquo; Steve began to make lunch and Tony smiled, his stomach seemed to settle a little now that food was on the way. <br/>&ldquo;Yeah. She will.&rdquo;\n\n<br/></p><hr><p>Steve and Tony were in the middle of watching the lion king with Peter when the doorbell rang. It was pouring with rain outside and Steve wasn&rsquo;t expecting anyone. It had been a risk, buying Tony the coffee. But it seemed worth it now. It was a step in the right direction apparently. Tony paused the movie as Steve got up to answer the door. <br/>&ldquo;Pizza must be here.&rdquo; Steve murmured. They had both been far too lazy to cook dinner and had just ordered pizza. Steve grabbed the money and swung the door open, ready to pay for the pizza but it wasn&rsquo;t the pizza guy standing there. <br/>&ldquo;May?&rdquo; His heart was pounding, mind racing. <br/>&ldquo;Hi Steve. Can I come in?&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; And he stepped aside, letting her in. <br/>&ldquo;Natasha told me you&rsquo;d be here.&rdquo; She smiled at Peter and Steve&rsquo;s heart sunk a little. <br/>&ldquo;How are you holding up?&rdquo; Steve asked. <br/>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a lot better.&rdquo; May admitted and Steve noticed how Tony was studying Peter. <br/>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry May.&rdquo; Steve murmured and she nodded. <br/>&ldquo;I know I haven&rsquo;t been fair to the two of you, dropping by to sleep whilst you babysit and abandoning Peter all together. I haven&rsquo;t been the best guardian to him.&rdquo; There was a lump in the back of Steve&rsquo;s throat. His gut was churning. Here it was. Her decision. The truth. <br/>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been through a lot.&rdquo; Steve was relieved Tony spoke, because Steve was pretty sure he had lost all of his abillity of speech.<br/>&ldquo;I know. But I should have been better. Tried harder. And I&rsquo;m still in a bad way, but I&rsquo;m seeing a therapist which is helping.&rdquo; May murmured. <br/>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good.&rdquo; Twice Peter has been ripped away from them. Steve wasn&rsquo;t sure he could bare it a third time. <br/>&ldquo;My therapist helped me come to this decision. I left the two of you as anonymous trusted family friends. But I want you two to know I made this decision with a clear head and I have a second opinion which didn&rsquo;t in any way effect the outcome of this decision.&rdquo; <i>Just say it already. Rip it off like a band aid. </i>Steve couldn&rsquo;t bare the wait. The anticipation. He just wanted to know her choice. <br/>&ldquo;This wasn&rsquo;t an easy decision. But it is the best decision. For the both of us.&rdquo; Tony was watching Steve. They were both terrified and anxious. <br/>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve decided that Peter is better off living with the two of you. But I still want to be involved in his life. Like Friday night dinner or something.&rdquo; Steve let out a deep and relieved breath. He was ecstatic. <br/>&ldquo;Of course May.&rdquo; He couldn&rsquo;t surprise the grin and neither could tony. <br/>&ldquo;So we&rsquo;ll foster him?&rdquo; Tony asked and May shook her head. <br/>&ldquo;It would be easier if the two of you simply adopted him. I can arrange for a lawyer to talk to us all on Tuesday.&rdquo; May explained and tony shared a look with Steve. While the co-parenting was working right now, would it still be working in five months? A year? What about when Peter was a teenager? When they were off on missions? Was adoption truly the best option? A silent conversation passed between them. Steve nodded and Tony did too. <br/>&ldquo;Sounds perfect May.

Knew it was because he wanted to see Peter. And Tony was tempted to do the same thing. But he managed to refrain. Ben had been very clear, he didn\u2019t want them involved. So Tony was making a point of not getting involved. But it was killing a small part of him, not seeing that smiling, giggling face Peter bore. It had been more than a month since Tony had seen that face. Tony shook his head, burying himself deeper into his work. That\u2019s when Steve walked into the workshop, and sat down on the couch. <br>\u201cHello to you too Rogers.\u201d Tony murmured dryly. <br>\u201cDoes this not bother you?\u201d Steve demanded and Tony sighed. <br>\u201cYou know it does. But Ben was very clear- we are not supposed to get involved.\u201d<br>\u201cBut-\u201d<br>\u201cNo buts Steve. The best thing we can do is move on and hope the kid comes back to us later on, hope he wants to be an avenger then.\u201d Steve sighed and shook his head. <br>\u201cI can\u2019t accept that Tony. You can\u2019t either, even if you won\u2019t admit it now. You want to go and get him as much as I do-\u201d<br>\u201cBut we can do nothing Steve. Don\u2019t you have some mission to attend to or?\u201d Steve raised a brow. <br>\u201cSo you\u2019re just going to pretend like the last couple of months never happened?\u201d Steve demanded and Tony sighed. <br>\u201cWhat do you want me to say? That I miss a kid that was never mine? That I wish May and Ben would gain some common sense and understand that he\u2019d be better off here? That a part of me hates Ben for taking Peter away? Steve He isn\u2019t ours!\u201d Tony shouted and Steve shook his head. <br>\u201cBut you wanted him to be.\u201d<br>\u201cThat was never an option. He was never going to be ours and he never will be. Now get your self righteous ass out of my workshop!\u201d Tony snapped and Steve shook his head. <br>\u201cWhy won\u2019t you admit that you wanted Peter?\u201d Steve demanded. <br>\u201cWhy do you care?\u201d Tony didn\u2019t want to talk about this. <br>\u201cBecause you\u2019re the only person who understands what it feels like to lose Peter.\u201d Steve murmured and tony sighed. <br>\u201cJust go Steve. I don\u2019t want to talk about this. I <i>can\u2019t</i> talk about this. <i>Please</i>.\u201d Steve sighed but nodded his head. He got up and left, slamming the door shut behind him.\n\n<br></p><hr><p>\n\nSteve was standing in the kitchen, bleary eyed and pouring milk into his cereal. He hadn\u2019t spoken to Tony in a week and didn\u2019t feel slightly inclined to talk to him today. When Peter was around\u2026 Tony seemed tolerable. Now Tony had reverted back to the same old asshole that he used to be. There was a banging at the front door and with a deep sigh, Steve went to answer it. There was a slight scar from the bullet but he had healed well. Steve opened the door to find May. Her eyes were red and swollen and she had a crying Peter on her hip. <br>\u201cTake him. Please. I just can\u2019t-\u201d <br>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Steve asked and took Peter. <br>\u201cI can\u2019t be here.\u201d She then sprinted down the driveway, got in her car and sped off. Peter didn\u2019t settle, only continued to cry. <br>\u201cSteve?\u201d It was Natasha\u2019s voice. But Steve had his phone out and was calling Ben. Had he gotten into a fight with May? The phone went to voicemail. This time he tried May. She didn\u2019t answer. <br>\u201cSomethings wrong with May. She was crying and she handed Peter over and then ran\u2026\u201d<br>\u201cWas Ben there?\u201d Nat asked and Steve shook his head. <br>\u201cThey won\u2019t answer their phones.\u201d Steve made an attempt to calm Peter down but the wailing continued. <br>\u201cI\u2019m going to take him to Tony. Maybe his powers were too much\u2026\u201d Nat nodded and Steve headed down to Tony\u2019s workshop. When Steve got to the workshop, coffee cups were strewn all about the place. <br>\u201cTony?\u201d Steve asked softly and Tony turned. Spotting Peter immediately. <br>\u201cWhy do you have him?\u201d Tony blurted and Steve handed him over. Tony hugging him immediately. <br>\u201cMay was crying, something\u2019s wrong Tony, and I can\u2019t get ahold of her or Ben and-\u201d<br>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be alright Steve. I\u2019ll call them and watch Peter. Maybe you should go out looking for them?\u201d Tony offered. <br>\u201cNo need.\u201d Nat said from the doorway. May beside her. <br>\u201cMay?\u201d Steve asked. <br>\u201cI feel bad. Leaving him like that, so I turned around and I just, I can\u2019t do it alone.\u201d<br>\u201cAlone?\u201d Tony asked. <br>\u201cBen\u2026\u201d May began crying and shook her head. <br>\u201cWhat? What happened May?\u201d Natasha asked gently. <br>\u201cThey caught the guy who killed him. He\u2019s going to prison, but I just\u2026I can\u2019t raise Peter. Not alone.\u201d Ben was dead. Steve shared a look with Tony. This poor woman had lost so much. <br>\u201cYou\u2019re grieving May. Why don\u2019t we look after Peter for a little while and you can decide later. You might just need time\u2026\u201d she nodded. <br>\u201cI just can\u2019t be here. I can\u2019t do this.\u201d And then she left with Natasha. Tony held Peter tightly to his chest and tony was watching Steve very closely. <br>\u201cI know we wanted Peter to be ours but\u2026\u201d Tony couldn\u2019t even finish the sentence. But Steve understood. <br>\u201cNot like this.\u201d Steve agreed. <br>\u201cIf she really doesn\u2019t want him though, I\u2019m not going to abandon him.\u201d Steve nodded. <br>\u201cAgreed.\u201d Tony sat down and studied Peter, who had mercifully stopped crying. <br>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to baby proof the entire damn building.\u201d Tony muttered. <br>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to.\u201d Steve thought of the one place he kept secret from the avengers. <br>\u201cWhy not?\u201d <br>\u201cI have an apartment. In Brooklyn. It\u2019d be easier to look after him there\u2026\u201d <br>\u201cWhy am I only learning about this now?\u201d<br>\u201cI asked Jarvis to not say anything and\u2026\u201d Steve shrugged. <br>\u201cOkay, well we can baby proof your secret apartment and take shifts looking after Peter until May makes a decision.\u201d Steve nodded.<br>\u201cOkay.\u201d This could work. This <i>would</i> work. \n\n<br></p><hr><p>\n\nTony soon realised he and Steve had both seriously underestimated just how hard it was to look after Peter. An hour into Steve\u2019s first shift, Tony got a phone call requesting help. Tony had lasted a triumphant three hours before calling Steve. So now they were co-parenting. Full time. Which was strange. But the first time Tony had walked into Steve\u2019s apartment, it felt strange. Homey. Which was a foreign thing to Tony. There was an amazing view of the skyline, there were books and sketches and clothes everywhere. His kitchen was small and could barely fit three people in it. But it was homey. And Tony found he loved to spend time there. More than his workshop.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay Pete I\u2019m going to make us some lunch, so no climbing the walls or the roof. Okay?\u201d Peter giggled. It had become a routine now, they had been doing this for a couple weeks and the guilt of enjoying this vanished very quickly. Now Tony just enjoyed every second with Peter. But as much as he loved Steve\u2019s apartment, he hated Steve\u2019s couch. It was leather and old and totally uncomfortable to sleep on. He knew he could always go back to the compound to sleep, but hated the idea of leaving Peter. So tony put up with the couch while Steve slept in his bedroom. Tony opened the cupboards and found an old packet of two minute noodles. With a frown, tony decided to check the empty fridge. <br>\u201cI think we need to go grocery shopping Pete.\u201d Tony muttered. Steve was out, training with Nat or something. It didn\u2019t bother Tony all that much, but it felt a little strange going grocery shopping for cap\u2019s kitchen. What if Tony bought the wrong cereal? And should Tony get coffee? Because Steve didn\u2019t even have a coffee machine here, which Tony was struggling with. It just made more sense to buy the damn coffee machine, but Tony didn\u2019t want to invade Steve\u2019s space. <br>\u201cThis is weird isn\u2019t it kid?\u201d Tony asked but Peter being a toddler, didn\u2019t respond. <br>\u201cI mean, Steve and I are barely even civil and I\u2019m sleeping on his couch!\u201d Tony ran a hand through his hair. This was crazy. Tony felt tempted to run, but knew that would be stupid. They were going to make this work. For Peter. <br>\u201cThis is gonna work. We will make this work for you kid. So you better appreciate it when you\u2019re older.\u201d Tony told him. Peter merely smiled at tony. <br>\u201cAre you even hungry?\u201d Tony asked. Peter merely stared and Tony sat down next to him. <br>\u201cI\u2019ve been researching everything about being a good father. My dad wasn\u2019t good to me and if we do end up keeping you, I want to be a good father. Someone you can count on\u2026\u201d Tony never wanted Peter to walk into someone else\u2019s home and find it strange because he had never experienced a home before. <br>\u201cTony?\u201d Steve swung the door open and mercifully had bought food. <br>\u201cOh thank god, we were going to starve.\u201d Steve rolled his eyes and placed the food down on the counter. <br>\u201cI checked this morning before I left, how\u2019s he been today?\u201d<br>\u201cGood. I think he\u2019s settled into this routine. With you and me and this place.\u201d Steve nodded and began to put things in cupboards and in the fridge. <br>\u201cI bought you some instant coffee which I know isn\u2019t as good as a coffee machine but-in case this doesn\u2019t work out, I didn\u2019t want to invest in a coffee machine just yet.\u201d It was an olive branch. Steve had bought Tony coffee. <br>\u201cThanks.\u201d Steve smiled, seemingly relieved that tony wasn\u2019t going to argue.<br>\u201cHow is everyone back at the compound?\u201d Tony asked. <br>\u201cGood. They think this is very weird but they\u2019ve gotten used to us not being around as much.\u201d Steve shrugged. <br>\u201cI was thinking about swinging by later, tinkering with the suit for a bit\u2026\u201d Steve nodded. <br>\u201cSure. I\u2019ve got no plans tonight so I\u2019m happy to look after the little guy.\u201d Steve said over his shoulder and tony nodded. <br>\u201cHave you heard from May recently?\u201d Tony asked. <br>\u201cNo. Not a word. Nat checks up on her though. Makes sure she is doing alright.\u201d Steve murmured and Tony nodded. <br>\u201cI can\u2019t even begin to imagine what she must be feeling right now.\u201d Tony murmured. And a part of him hoped he would never have to go through that. That he\u2019d never have to experience the horror of losing those he loved the most. He already lost his parents in a car accident. <br>\u201cShe\u2019s a strong woman. She\u2019ll get through this.\u201d Steve began to make lunch and Tony smiled, his stomach seemed to settle a little now that food was on the way. <br>\u201cYeah. She will.\u201d\n\n<br></p><hr><p>Steve and Tony were in the middle of watching the lion king with Peter when the doorbell rang. It was pouring with rain outside and Steve wasn\u2019t expecting anyone. It had been a risk, buying Tony the coffee. But it seemed worth it now. It was a step in the right direction apparently. Tony paused the movie as Steve got up to answer the door. <br>\u201cPizza must be here.\u201d Steve murmured. They had both been far too lazy to cook dinner and had just ordered pizza. Steve grabbed the money and swung the door open, ready to pay for the pizza but it wasn\u2019t the pizza guy standing there. <br>\u201cMay?\u201d His heart was pounding, mind racing. <br>\u201cHi Steve. Can I come in?\u201d<br>\u201cOf course.\u201d And he stepped aside, letting her in. <br>\u201cNatasha told me you\u2019d be here.\u201d She smiled at Peter and Steve\u2019s heart sunk a little. <br>\u201cHow are you holding up?\u201d Steve asked. <br>\u201cI\u2019ve been a lot better.\u201d May admitted and Steve noticed how Tony was studying Peter. <br>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry May.\u201d Steve murmured and she nodded. <br>\u201cI know I haven\u2019t been fair to the two of you, dropping by to sleep whilst you babysit and abandoning Peter all together. I haven\u2019t been the best guardian to him.\u201d There was a lump in the back of Steve\u2019s throat. His gut was churning. Here it was. Her decision. The truth. <br>\u201cYou\u2019ve been through a lot.\u201d Steve was relieved Tony spoke, because Steve was pretty sure he had lost all of his abillity of speech.<br>\u201cI know. But I should have been better. Tried harder. And I\u2019m still in a bad way, but I\u2019m seeing a therapist which is helping.\u201d May murmured. <br>\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Twice Peter has been ripped away from them. Steve wasn\u2019t sure he could bare it a third time. <br>\u201cMy therapist helped me come to this decision. I left the two of you as anonymous trusted family friends. But I want you two to know I made this decision with a clear head and I have a second opinion which didn\u2019t in any way effect the outcome of this decision.\u201d <i>Just say it already. Rip it off like a band aid. </i>Steve couldn\u2019t bare the wait. The anticipation. He just wanted to know her choice. <br>\u201cThis wasn\u2019t an easy decision. But it is the best decision. For the both of us.\u201d Tony was watching Steve. They were both terrified and anxious. <br>\u201cI\u2019ve decided that Peter is better off living with the two of you. But I still want to be involved in his life. Like Friday night dinner or something.\u201d Steve let out a deep and relieved breath. He was ecstatic. <br>\u201cOf course May.\u201d He couldn\u2019t surprise the grin and neither could tony. <br>\u201cSo we\u2019ll foster him?\u201d Tony asked and May shook her head. <br>\u201cIt would be easier if the two of you simply adopted him. I can arrange for a lawyer to talk to us all on Tuesday.\u201d May explained and tony shared a look with Steve. While the co-parenting was working right now, would it still be working in five months? A year? What about when Peter was a teenager? When they were off on missions? Was adoption truly the best option? A silent conversation passed between them. Steve nodded and Tony did too. <br>\u201cSounds perfect May. Thank you.\u201d Steve said, his grin grew even wider. <br>\u201cWe would love to adopt him.\u201d Tony murmured and looked down at Peter. <i>My son</i>. And this time, it was true. Peter really was theirs now. And now they really, truly, did have to make this work. They were in it for the long haul and there was no backing out. Peter was their responsibility and with a bit of luck, it would remain that way forever.</p>",

Don\u2019t you have some mission to attend to or?\u201d Steve raised a brow. <br>\u201cSo you\u2019re just going to pretend like the last couple of months never happened?\u201d Steve demanded and Tony sighed. <br>\u201cWhat do you want me to say? That I miss a kid that was never mine? That I wish May and Ben would gain some common sense and understand that he\u2019d be better off here? That a part of me hates Ben for taking Peter away? Steve He isn\u2019t ours!\u201d Tony shouted and Steve shook his head. <br>\u201cBut you wanted him to be.\u201d<br>\u201cThat was never an option. He was never going to be ours and he never will be. Now get your self righteous ass out of my workshop!\u201d Tony snapped and Steve shook his head. <br>\u201cWhy won\u2019t you admit that you wanted Peter?\u201d Steve demanded. <br>\u201cWhy do you care?\u201d Tony didn\u2019t want to talk about this. <br>\u201cBecause you\u2019re the only person who understands what it feels like to lose Peter.\u201d Steve murmured and tony sighed. <br>\u201cJust go Steve. I don\u2019t want to talk about this. I <i>can\u2019t</i> talk about this. <i>Please</i>.\u201d Steve sighed but nodded his head. He got up and left, slamming the door shut behind him.\n\n<br></p><hr><p>\n\nSteve was standing in the kitchen, bleary eyed and pouring milk into his cereal. He hadn\u2019t spoken to Tony in a week and didn\u2019t feel slightly inclined to talk to him today. When Peter was around\u2026 Tony seemed tolerable. Now Tony had reverted back to the same old asshole that he used to be. There was a banging at the front door and with a deep sigh, Steve went to answer it. There was a slight scar from the bullet but he had healed well. Steve opened the door to find May. Her eyes were red and swollen and she had a crying Peter on her hip. <br>\u201cTake him. Please. I just can\u2019t-\u201d <br>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Steve asked and took Peter. <br>\u201cI can\u2019t be here.\u201d She then sprinted down the driveway, got in her car and sped off. Peter didn\u2019t settle, only continued to cry. <br>\u201cSteve?\u201d It was Natasha\u2019s voice. But Steve had his phone out and was calling Ben. Had he gotten into a fight with May? The phone went to voicemail. This time he tried May. She didn\u2019t answer. <br>\u201cSomethings wrong with May. She was crying and she handed Peter over and then ran\u2026\u201d<br>\u201cWas Ben there?\u201d Nat asked and Steve shook his head. <br>\u201cThey won\u2019t answer their phones.\u201d Steve made an attempt to calm Peter down but the wailing continued. <br>\u201cI\u2019m going to take him to Tony. Maybe his powers were too much\u2026\u201d Nat nodded and Steve headed down to Tony\u2019s workshop. When Steve got to the workshop, coffee cups were strewn all about the place. <br>\u201cTony?\u201d Steve asked softly and Tony turned. Spotting Peter immediately. <br>\u201cWhy do you have him?\u201d Tony blurted and Steve handed him over. Tony hugging him immediately. <br>\u201cMay was crying, something\u2019s wrong Tony, and I can\u2019t get ahold of her or Ben and-\u201d<br>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be alright Steve. I\u2019ll call them and watch Peter. Maybe you should go out looking for them?\u201d Tony offered. <br>\u201cNo need.\u201d Nat said from the doorway. May beside her. <br>\u201cMay?\u201d Steve asked. <br>\u201cI feel bad. Leaving him like that, so I turned around and I just, I can\u2019t do it alone.\u201d<br>\u201cAlone?\u201d Tony asked. <br>\u201cBen\u2026\u201d May began crying and shook her head. <br>\u201cWhat? What happened May?\u201d Natasha asked gently. <br>\u201cThey caught the guy who killed him. He\u2019s going to prison, but I just\u2026I can\u2019t raise Peter. Not alone.\u201d Ben was dead. Steve shared a look with Tony. This poor woman had lost so much. <br>\u201cYou\u2019re grieving May. Why don\u2019t we look after Peter for a little while and you can decide later. You might just need time\u2026\u201d she nodded. <br>\u201cI just can\u2019t be here. I can\u2019t do this.\u201d And then she left with Natasha. Tony held Peter tightly to his chest and tony was watching Steve very closely. <br>\u201cI know we wanted Peter to be ours but\u2026\u201d Tony couldn\u2019t even finish the sentence. But Steve understood. <br>\u201cNot like this.\u201d Steve agreed. <br>\u201cIf she really doesn\u2019t want him though, I\u2019m not going to abandon him.\u201d Steve nodded. <br>\u201cAgreed.\u201d Tony sat down and studied Peter, who had mercifully stopped crying. <br>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to baby proof the entire damn building.\u201d Tony muttered. <br>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to.\u201d Steve thought of the one place he kept secret from the avengers. <br>\u201cWhy not?\u201d <br>\u201cI have an apartment. In Brooklyn. It\u2019d be easier to look after him there\u2026\u201d <br>\u201cWhy am I only learning about this now?\u201d<br>\u201cI asked Jarvis to not say anything and\u2026\u201d Steve shrugged. <br>\u201cOkay, well we can baby proof your secret apartment and take shifts looking after Peter until May makes a decision.\u201d Steve nodded.<br>\u201cOkay.\u201d This could work. This <i>would</i> work. \n\n<br></p><hr><p>\n\nTony soon realised he and Steve had both seriously underestimated just how hard it was to look after Peter. An hour into Steve\u2019s first shift, Tony got a phone call requesting help. Tony had lasted a triumphant three hours before calling Steve. So now they were co-parenting. Full time. Which was strange. But the first time Tony had walked into Steve\u2019s apartment, it felt strange. Homey. Which was a foreign thing to Tony. There was an amazing view of the skyline, there were books and sketches and clothes everywhere. His kitchen was small and could barely fit three people in it. But it was homey. And Tony found he loved to spend time there. More than his workshop.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay Pete I\u2019m going to make us some lunch, so no climbing the walls or the roof. Okay?\u201d Peter giggled. It had become a routine now, they had been doing this for a couple weeks and the guilt of enjoying this vanished very quickly. Now Tony just enjoyed every second with Peter. But as much as he loved Steve\u2019s apartment, he hated Steve\u2019s couch. It was leather and old and totally uncomfortable to sleep on. He knew he could always go back to the compound to sleep, but hated the idea of leaving Peter. So tony put up with the couch while Steve slept in his bedroom. Tony opened the cupboards and found an old packet of two minute noodles. With a frown, tony decided to check the empty fridge. <br>\u201cI think we need to go grocery shopping Pete.\u201d Tony muttered. Steve was out, training with Nat or something. It didn\u2019t bother Tony all that much, but it felt a little strange going grocery shopping for cap\u2019s kitchen. What if Tony bought the wrong cereal? And should Tony get coffee? Because Steve didn\u2019t even have a coffee machine here, which Tony was struggling with. It just made more sense to buy the damn coffee machine, but Tony didn\u2019t want to invade Steve\u2019s space. <br>\u201cThis is weird isn\u2019t it kid?\u201d Tony asked but Peter being a toddler, didn\u2019t respond. <br>\u201cI mean, Steve and I are barely even civil and I\u2019m sleeping on his couch!\u201d Tony ran a hand through his hair. This was crazy. Tony felt tempted to run, but knew that would be stupid. They were going to make this work. For Peter. <br>\u201cThis is gonna work. We will make this work for you kid. So you better appreciate it when you\u2019re older.\u201d Tony told him. Peter merely smiled at tony. <br>\u201cAre you even hungry?\u201d Tony asked. Peter merely stared and Tony sat down next to him. <br>\u201cI\u2019ve been researching everything about being a good father. My dad wasn\u2019t good to me and if we do end up keeping you, I want to be a good father. Someone you can count on\u2026\u201d Tony never wanted Peter to walk into someone else\u2019s home and find it strange because he had never experienced a home before. <br>\u201cTony?\u201d Steve swung the door open and mercifully had bought food. <br>\u201cOh thank god, we were going to starve.\u201d Steve rolled his eyes and placed the food down on the counter. <br>\u201cI checked this morning before I left, how\u2019s he been today?\u201d<br>\u201cGood. I think he\u2019s settled into this routine. With you and me and this place.\u201d Steve nodded and began to put things in cupboards and in the fridge. <br>\u201cI bought you some instant coffee which I know isn\u2019t as good as a coffee machine but-in case this doesn\u2019t work out, I didn\u2019t want to invest in a coffee machine just yet.\u201d It was an olive branch. Steve had bought Tony coffee. <br>\u201cThanks.\u201d Steve smiled, seemingly relieved that tony wasn\u2019t going to argue.<br>\u201cHow is everyone back at the compound?\u201d Tony asked. <br>\u201cGood. They think this is very weird but they\u2019ve gotten used to us not being around as much.\u201d Steve shrugged. <br>\u201cI was thinking about swinging by later, tinkering with the suit for a bit\u2026\u201d Steve nodded. <br>\u201cSure. I\u2019ve got no plans tonight so I\u2019m happy to look after the little guy.\u201d Steve said over his shoulder and tony nodded. <br>\u201cHave you heard from May recently?\u201d Tony asked. <br>\u201cNo. Not a word. Nat checks up on her though. Makes sure she is doing alright.\u201d Steve murmured and Tony nodded. <br>\u201cI can\u2019t even begin to imagine what she must be feeling right now.\u201d Tony murmured. And a part of him hoped he would never have to go through that. That he\u2019d never have to experience the horror of losing those he loved the most. He already lost his parents in a car accident. <br>\u201cShe\u2019s a strong woman. She\u2019ll get through this.\u201d Steve began to make lunch and Tony smiled, his stomach seemed to settle a little now that food was on the way. <br>\u201cYeah. She will.\u201d\n\n<br></p><hr><p>Steve and Tony were in the middle of watching the lion king with Peter when the doorbell rang. It was pouring with rain outside and Steve wasn\u2019t expecting anyone. It had been a risk, buying Tony the coffee. But it seemed worth it now. It was a step in the right direction apparently. Tony paused the movie as Steve got up to answer the door. <br>\u201cPizza must be here.\u201d Steve murmured. They had both been far too lazy to cook dinner and had just ordered pizza. Steve grabbed the money and swung the door open, ready to pay for the pizza but it wasn\u2019t the pizza guy standing there. <br>\u201cMay?\u201d His heart was pounding, mind racing. <br>\u201cHi Steve. Can I come in?\u201d<br>\u201cOf course.\u201d And he stepped aside, letting her in. <br>\u201cNatasha told me you\u2019d be here.\u201d She smiled at Peter and Steve\u2019s heart sunk a little. <br>\u201cHow are you holding up?\u201d Steve asked. <br>\u201cI\u2019ve been a lot better.\u201d May admitted and Steve noticed how Tony was studying Peter. <br>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry May.\u201d Steve murmured and she nodded. <br>\u201cI know I haven\u2019t been fair to the two of you, dropping by to sleep whilst you babysit and abandoning Peter all together. I haven\u2019t been the best guardian to him.\u201d There was a lump in the back of Steve\u2019s throat. His gut was churning. Here it was. Her decision. The truth. <br>\u201cYou\u2019ve been through a lot.\u201d Steve was relieved Tony spoke, because Steve was pretty sure he had lost all of his abillity of speech.<br>\u201cI know. But I should have been better. Tried harder. And I\u2019m still in a bad way, but I\u2019m seeing a therapist which is helping.\u201d May murmured. <br>\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Twice Peter has been ripped away from them. Steve wasn\u2019t sure he could bare it a third time. <br>\u201cMy therapist helped me come to this decision. I left the two of you as anonymous trusted family friends. But I want you two to know I made this decision with a clear head and I have a second opinion which didn\u2019t in any way effect the outcome of this decision.\u201d <i>Just say it already. Rip it off like a band aid. </i>Steve couldn\u2019t bare the wait. The anticipation. He just wanted to know her choice. <br>\u201cThis wasn\u2019t an easy decision. But it is the best decision. For the both of us.\u201d Tony was watching Steve. They were both terrified and anxious. <br>\u201cI\u2019ve decided that Peter is better off living with the two of you. But I still want to be involved in his life. Like Friday night dinner or something.\u201d Steve let out a deep and relieved breath. He was ecstatic. <br>\u201cOf course May.\u201d He couldn\u2019t surprise the grin and neither could tony. <br>\u201cSo we\u2019ll foster him?\u201d Tony asked and May shook her head. <br>\u201cIt would be easier if the two of you simply adopted him. I can arrange for a lawyer to talk to us all on Tuesday.\u201d May explained and tony shared a look with Steve. While the co-parenting was working right now, would it still be working in five months? A year? What about when Peter was a teenager? When they were off on missions? Was adoption truly the best option? A silent conversation passed between them. Steve nodded and Tony did too. <br>\u201cSounds perfect May. Thank you.\u201d Steve said, his grin grew even wider. <br>\u201cWe would love to adopt him.\u201d Tony murmured and looked down at Peter. <i>My son</i>. And this time, it was true. Peter really was theirs now. And now they really, truly, did have to make this work. They were in it for the long haul and there was no backing out. Peter was their responsibility and with a bit of luck, it would remain that way forever.</p>",

Knew it was because he wanted to see Peter. And Tony was tempted to do the same thing. But he managed to refrain. Ben had been very clear, he didn&rsquo;t want them involved. So Tony was making a point of not getting involved. But it was killing a small part of him, not seeing that smiling, giggling face Peter bore. It had been more than a month since Tony had seen that face. Tony shook his head, burying himself deeper into his work. That&rsquo;s when Steve walked into the workshop, and sat down on the couch. <br />&ldquo;Hello to you too Rogers.&rdquo; Tony murmured dryly. <br />&ldquo;Does this not bother you?&rdquo; Steve demanded and Tony sighed. <br />&ldquo;You know it does. But Ben was very clear- we are not supposed to get involved.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;But-&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;No buts Steve.

She will.&rdquo;\n\n<br /></p><hr /><p>Steve and Tony were in the middle of watching the lion king with Peter when the doorbell rang. It was pouring with rain outside and Steve wasn&rsquo;t expecting anyone. It had been a risk, buying Tony the coffee. But it seemed worth it now. It was a step in the right direction apparently. Tony paused the movie as Steve got up to answer the door. <br />&ldquo;Pizza must be here.&rdquo; Steve murmured. They had both been far too lazy to cook dinner and had just ordered pizza. Steve grabbed the money and swung the door open, ready to pay for the pizza but it wasn&rsquo;t the pizza guy standing there. <br />&ldquo;May?&rdquo; His heart was pounding, mind racing. <br />&ldquo;Hi Steve. Can I come in?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; And he stepped aside, letting her in. <br />&ldquo;Natasha told me you&rsquo;d be here.&rdquo; She smiled at Peter and Steve&rsquo;s heart sunk a little. <br />&ldquo;How are you holding up?&rdquo; Steve asked. <br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a lot better.&rdquo; May admitted and Steve noticed how Tony was studying Peter. <br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry May.&rdquo; Steve murmured and she nodded. <br />&ldquo;I know I haven&rsquo;t been fair to the two of you, dropping by to sleep whilst you babysit and abandoning Peter all together. I haven&rsquo;t been the best guardian to him.&rdquo; There was a lump in the back of Steve&rsquo;s throat. His gut was churning. Here it was. Her decision. The truth. <br />&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been through a lot.&rdquo; Steve was relieved Tony spoke, because Steve was pretty sure he had lost all of his abillity of speech.<br />&ldquo;I know. But I should have been better. Tried harder. And I&rsquo;m still in a bad way, but I&rsquo;m seeing a therapist which is helping.&rdquo; May murmured. <br />&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good.&rdquo; Twice Peter has been ripped away from them. Steve wasn&rsquo;t sure he could bare it a third time. <br />&ldquo;My therapist helped me come to this decision. I left the two of you as anonymous trusted family friends. But I want you two to know I made this decision with a clear head and I have a second opinion which didn&rsquo;t in any way effect the outcome of this decision.&rdquo; <i>Just say it already. Rip it off like a band aid. </i>Steve couldn&rsquo;t bare the wait. The anticipation. He just wanted to know her choice. <br />&ldquo;This wasn&rsquo;t an easy decision. But it is the best decision. For the both of us.&rdquo; Tony was watching Steve. They were both terrified and anxious. <br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve decided that Peter is better off living with the two of you. But I still want to be involved in his life. Like Friday night dinner or something.&rdquo; Steve let out a deep and relieved breath. He was ecstatic. <br />&ldquo;Of course May.&rdquo; He couldn&rsquo;t surprise the grin and neither could tony. <br />&ldquo;So we&rsquo;ll foster him?&rdquo; Tony asked and May shook her head. <br />&ldquo;It would be easier if the two of you simply adopted him. I can arrange for a lawyer to talk to us all on Tuesday.&rdquo; May explained and tony shared a look with Steve. While the co-parenting was working right now, would it still be working in five months? A year? What about when Peter was a teenager? When they were off on missions? Was adoption truly the best option? A silent conversation passed between them. Steve nodded and Tony did too. <br />&ldquo;Sounds perfect May. Thank you.&rdquo; Steve said, his grin grew even wider. <br />&ldquo;We would love to adopt him.&rdquo; Tony murmured and looked down at Peter. <i>My son</i>. And this time, it was true. Peter really was theirs now. And now they really, truly, did have to make this work. They were in it for the long haul and there was no backing out. Peter was their responsibility and with a bit of luck, it would remain that way forever.</p>",

But now that Peter is here,Steve and Tony both feel protective over him. It doesn&rsquo;t help that Peter hates everyone other than Steve and tony. But as Steve and tony raise Peter, they start to fall for one another.

So say she&rsquo;s been their 2-4 years (I only say that long because she was on a solo mission which means she must have been trusted at that point, and that trust ain&rsquo;t easy to get). The majority of the book then takes place about a year after New York. Which means Natasha has actually only been a good guy for around 10-14 years. Which might seem a lot for a normal person, but in the comic books she is similar to Steve Rogers and the Winter Soldier, she&rsquo;s genetically advanced and in the comics had been around since pre WW2. Plus there is a brief mention that her birthday is redacted from her file which could show that she&rsquo;s actually a lot older than she looks and it&rsquo;s never implicitly contradicted that in the movies (or book, so far).</li></ul><h2>Bear in mind that the only person to state that this is part of the MCU is the author if the book, no one else from Marvel has confirmed or denied that&hellip;</h2><ul><li>Now this is a big <b>*spoiler* </b>but Coulson is in it. Not just in the first chapter either he is in it throughout. Him and Nat talk and he helps her out for a bit. Now do you remember me mentioning that this is after New York? This is indesputible because there is 1 or 2 pages dedicated to Natasha thinking about how hard it&rsquo;s been to keep a low profile since the Avengers became world famous, how she&rsquo;s had to work a whole lot harder to disguise herself because the entire world now knows what she looks like.</li><li>Natasha knowing Coulson is alive isn&rsquo;t even the best part.</li><li>Tony Stark is in it.</li><li>He only appears for a few chapters (so far, he might come back) to try and help Natasha and Ava with a lil problem they have.</li><li>But</li><li>He</li><li>Mentions</li><li>Natasha getting help from Coulson.</li><li>Obviously the rest of his line won&rsquo;t make sense until you read the book but he says this &ldquo;So you circle the wagons, pick up Mini-Me, take out Ivan&rsquo;s welcome party, <i><b>hop aboard Coulson&rsquo;s good ship</b></i> Lollipop and hitch a ride to S.H.I.E.L.D.&rsquo;s doorstep?&rdquo;. Plus earlier it says &ldquo;a few well placed calls from Coulson&rdquo; help Tony and Natasha get access to what they want access to at the New York Triskellion. So this HEAVILY implies that Tony Stark also knew Coulson was alive?? Which leads on to the question do the others know? Did they tell them or did they realise he was *dead* for a reason and keep the secret?</li></ul><h2>&hellip;.Or it could be set in an entirely alternate universe where Coulson never died&hellip;.in which case half this post is pointless (but it&rsquo;s still a good book so go read)</h2><ul><li>Plus there are a few other bits, for example Tony makes a Star Trek reference proving many people&rsquo;s headcannons that he is a huge nerd. And Natasha follows that with &ldquo;is that before or after they blow up the death star&rdquo; proving that even in the midst and a crisis she is a HUGE troll&hellip;.OR&hellip;. she is completely anti-nerd and doesn&rsquo;t care for movies or pop culture&hellip;</li></ul><p>Now I&rsquo;m not gonna lie, it&rsquo;s not the BEST book I&rsquo;ve ever read (maybe because I&rsquo;m a year or 2 too old) but it&rsquo;s well written and thorough and it gives a really big insight to Natasha&rsquo; s character. When she isn&rsquo;t with her Avenger buddies, people she trusts implicitly, she is cold and calculating and has no fucking clue on how to deal with teenagers, or how to connect with Ava (who is very similar to her in experiences and past traumas). Through this it also gives a large insight into what the Red Room was like, which lots of fans have been searching for for a long time. Also there are lots of bits in Russian which is interesting and it&rsquo;s written in a way that you can usually understand what it translates to (or it&rsquo;s translated for you).</p><p>However, the only major downside to this book that I can find is that Clint Barton isn&rsquo;t in it. So far he hasn&rsquo;t even been mentioned (I think\ud83d\ude05) and I looked some things up and it doesn&rsquo;t look like he comes into the second half of the book either. Now as much as that is disappointed there are still 1 or 2 books (i forget) in this series in which he m<i>ight </i>appear in. I doubt it though.</p><p>All in all its a thouraghly enjoyable book and I definitely wouldn&rsquo;t mind any Black Widow movie to be based on it (although the inclusion on Clint Barton would be preferable) so you BW fans out there go read it it&rsquo;s good\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"540\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"mithborien:4wWTbDJzPyopvCOTiK_KXw:ZNhUmt25cDta6\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4de48127e8a95d3a1e8e6cd53dc1ce82/tumblr_o64zzi9QbH1rls5aco1_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"540\" data-orig-width=\"540\"/></figure><p>-E</p>",
