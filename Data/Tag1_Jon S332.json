It\u2019s intoxicating, being the focus of such intensity. She bites her lip, scanning the crowded hall till she spots him leaning against his locker, arms crossed over his chest. It\u2019s crazy how attuned she is to him, how just looking at him can set her heart racing, and it\u2019s both terrifying and empowering. She ducks her head and pushes into the crowd, clutching her biology book to her chest as if it might keep her from floating away. People side-eye her and no one stops her as she presses toward her locker. A week ago this would have bothered her, but now\u2026 now she has the undivided attention of the only person who matters. <br/></p><!-- more --><p>Their lockers are close enough that she can hear Theon call his name and the resulting conversation. She shoves her books into her locker and seizes her opening. </p><p>\u201cHey Theon,\u201d she says, though she has a hard time looking away from Jon.</p><p>\u201cHey, San, didn\u2019t see you at the game last night,\u201d Theon replies, appraising her with unabashed approval. She doesn\u2019t take it too personally, Theon is harmless, but Jon flexes his hand a few times, shoulders tensing. </p><p>\u201cYeah, I had, uh, homework,\u201d she lies, praying she isn\u2019t blushing too obviously. </p><p>In truth she\u2019d snuck out her bedroom window to make out with Jon in the guest house for several wonderful, perfect hours. She\u2019d been a distracted mess all morning remembering the way he\u2019d pressed her back into the couch and slipped his hand up her loose shorts, palming her ass as he\u2019d ground into her. She can\u2019t stop herself from chancing a glance, and the heat in his eyes tell her she\u2019s not the only one remembering. </p><p>Theon snorts, and she looks quickly away before she loses all sense and does something stupid, like kiss him. \u201cLaaaaaame, when did you turn into such a bookworm?\u201d</p><p>He knows why, of course.

Jon and Arya still have\na very, very close relationship as in the most recent book where Jon ends\nup dying to save Arya. Jon has almost no relationship with Sansa in the books\nand they are very indifferent and distant siblings who rarely think of each\nother and whose stories/plots have nothing to do with each other. </p><p>3. Sansa\nstill betrays her family as per the original outline and Tyrion is not in love\nwith her. Tyrion loved Shae while he was married to Sansa. <br/></p><p>4. There\nis foreshadowing in the books for both Jon/Arya and Jon/Dany. Some of the most\nheartfelt love in the books is between Jon and Arya \u2013 <i>what do you know of my heart, priestess? What do you know of my sister?\nNeedle was Jon Snow\u2019s smile. </i>And between Jon and Dany the foreshadowing of\n- <i>A blue flower grew from a chink in a\nwall of ice, and filled the air with sweetness.</i></p><p>5. Seeing\nas how Tyrion had a strange look on his face when Jon went into Dany\u2019s room, it\u2019s\npossible that we are actually getting some version of a Jon \u2013 Dany \u2013 Tyrion love\ntriangle on the show next season and possibly in the books as well. </p><p>6. When\nGRRM originally intended for Jon and Arya to fall in love, it was a passion\nthat <b><i>TORMENTS</i></b>\nthem both because they dearly loved each other as siblings and that love was\nnow turning into something else. GRRM is all about <b>forbidden love</b>. Jon\u2019s oaths as a brother of the NW are also a big\ndeal as he is sworn to celibacy. In the books, Jon finally breaks his oaths for\nArya and chooses love over duty. <br/></p><p>7. In the outline, Tyrion burns down Winterfell and Jon and Tyrion fight\nover Arya. In the books, Ramsay burns down Winterfell and Jon and Ramsay fight\nover fake Arya.</p><p>8. Jon constantly compares the women he is\nattracted to with Arya in the books.

Let&rsquo;s get a\nfew things straight here:</p><p>1.&nbsp; THE\nSTARK SISTERS ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE</p><p>2.&nbsp; GRRM\nis still sticking to the story and ending he came up with in the early nineties. Jon and Arya still have\na very, very close relationship as in the most recent book where Jon ends\nup dying to save Arya. Jon has almost no relationship with Sansa in the books\nand they are very indifferent and distant siblings who rarely think of each\nother and whose stories/plots have nothing to do with each other. </p><p>3. Sansa\nstill betrays her family as per the original outline and Tyrion is not in love\nwith her. Tyrion loved Shae while he was married to Sansa. <br /></p><p>4. There\nis foreshadowing in the books for both Jon/Arya and Jon/Dany. Some of the most\nheartfelt love in the books is between Jon and Arya &ndash; <i>what do you know of my heart, priestess? What do you know of my sister?\nNeedle was Jon Snow&rsquo;s smile. </i>And between Jon and Dany the foreshadowing of\n- <i>A blue flower grew from a chink in a\nwall of ice, and filled the air with sweetness.</i></p><p>5. Seeing\nas how Tyrion had a strange look on his face when Jon went into Dany&rsquo;s room, it&rsquo;s\npossible that we are actually getting some version of a Jon &ndash; Dany &ndash; Tyrion love\ntriangle on the show next season and possibly in the books as well. </p><p>6. When\nGRRM originally intended for Jon and Arya to fall in love, it was a passion\nthat <b><i>TORMENTS</i></b>\nthem both because they dearly loved each other as siblings and that love was\nnow turning into something else. GRRM is all about <b>forbidden love</b>. Jon&rsquo;s oaths as a brother of the NW are also a big\ndeal as he is sworn to celibacy. In the books, Jon finally breaks his oaths for\nArya and chooses love over duty. <br /></p><p>7. In the outline, Tyrion burns down Winterfell and Jon and Tyrion fight\nover Arya. In the books, Ramsay burns down Winterfell and Jon and Ramsay fight\nover fake Arya.</p><p>8. Jon constantly compares the women he is\nattracted to with Arya in the books. Ygritte and Val signify the tough, take no\nprisoners, pro-active women that Jon falls for. Dany would fit right in there\nas well &ndash; <i>lonely, lovely and lethal</i>.\nAs recent as book 5, Jon espouses a dislike for girls like Sansa - <i>A warrior princess, he decided, not some willowy creature who\nsits up in a </i>tower<i>, brushing her hair and waiting\nfor some knight to rescue her.</i></p><p>9. The show putting Sansa in\nthe North is often used to justify Jonsa. On the contrary, Sansa in the North\nhad nothing to do with Jonsa and everything to do with David and Dan finding\nSansa&rsquo;s book plot too boring to adapt to TV and wanting to give Sophie Turner\nsomething meaty to do. As Benioff states : </p><blockquote><p> And it&rsquo;s because of Turner&rsquo;s strength,\nBenioff continued, that it made sense to give Sansa a dramatic storyline this\nseason and to use Ramsay&rsquo;s engagement&nbsp;for that very purpose. In fact, the\nshowrunners first thought about&nbsp;putting <b>Sansa and Ramsay together back when they were writing season 2</b>. &ldquo;<b>We really wanted Sansa to play a major part\nthis season</b>,&rdquo; Benioff said. &ldquo;<b>If we\nwere going to stay absolutely faithful to the book, it was going to be very\nhard to do that. There was a subplot we loved from the books, but it used a\ncharacter that&rsquo;s not in the show.&rdquo;</b>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"http://ew.com/article/2015/04/26/game-thrones-sansa-ramsay-interview/\">http://ew.com/article/2015/04/26/game-thrones-sansa-ramsay-interview/</a><br /></p><p>So basically\nDavid and Dan wanted Sophie Turner/ Sansa to play a major role on the show,\nunlike in the books, and therefore put her in Winterfell instead of Jeyne Poole.Sansa&rsquo;s story on the show will be different to her book one. <br /></p><p>&nbsp;So there it is.\nPlease stop using the original outline to justify Jonsa. If we actually take\nthe original outline into consideration then it does not bode well for Sansa at all.\nAs per the outline Sansa is most likely doomed and is going to end the series\ndead. GRRM has always maintained that he knew the ending way back in the early\nnineties. It is possible he is going for Jon/Arya. Or he is intending for\nJon/Dany. Either way one thing he is definitely not doing is Jon/Sansa\nconsidering how very little these characters have to do with each other in the\nbooks despite growing up as siblings. </p>",
