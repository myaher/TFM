I admit I had to cheat at certain points due to a lack of information. If anyone else wants to suggest alternate timelines it\u2019d be interesting to compare them.<br/><br/>I admit parts of this I had to guesstimate so I welcome feedback or alternative suggestions.* With any luck we could pin this down year by year. <br/><br/>For the record this isn\u2019t intended to be used to bash Life Story if it dare violate this timeline, it\u2019s just for fun.<br/><br/>Also for the record I used the Marvel Chronology Project Spider-Man page as the skeleton for my timeline.<br/><a

I took a deep sigh, closing my eyes shut.</p><p>It seemed like someone pressed the rewind button, that too in 8x speed, leaving me at the beginning, the very beginning!</p><!-- more --><p><i>&ldquo;It took centuries to make Chronicom a green, happy planet. We were thankful to our new king who made all this possible. His name was Enoch. He lived 365 years for us, to ensure that his children lived, he was my great great grandfather. He was so much different from his elder brother Kaius, the king of Atlantis, the reason why we were abandoned to a far-flung planet. Enoch was a God for all of us, everyone loved him, everyone prayed day and night so that he could live forever, enlighten all the coming generations. We thought that the prayers were the thing keeping him alive, until one day after 365 years he finally died.</i></p><p><i>The day was a historical day, everyone was mourning for him, Enoch was considered divine, his death was something beyond belief. We were wrong! He wasn&rsquo;t alive so long, because of him being divine or holy, but because of the 3 rings, he owned. He never wore them, but he was connected to them. The rings were miles, even light years apart from him, but still he could use their powers. He died because someone else found them, 2 of them. Her name was Dorothea, Kauis&rsquo;s only heir. She was close to Enoch, he loved her like a daughter. She used his love to find out the reason for his immortality and succeeded. She captured 2 of the rings that were buried deep inside Chronicom by Enoch. The sudden retrieval of 2 of the 3 rings made Enoch weak, he died of that. Dorothea made herself young again, we thought she would kill all of us, but she rather introduced better food and living for us. I befriended her, she was my far relative. I was just 10 years old and that 200 years old Dorothea who looked like she was 18, was already my best friend. Although I&rsquo;m 17, I can bet she still looks like 18. There was something in her, that made people believe her. And I loved to hang out with her, to get the spotlight. We became close friends, almost like sisters at least from my side. Everything was going so smooth, but then she finally revealed her plan. She finally found the location of the third and last ring, that was on Earth. So, she sent me here, to retrieve it. Her true intentions weren&rsquo;t to kill our people, but yours. If she gets all the 3 rings, she will make the whole Earth sunk underwater like Atlantis, killing everyone, to take revenge for the people of Atlantis who died, when we were abandoned. I supported her, in this plan. I did support her, I too wanted revenge. Also, she threatened me to kill my family if I fail.</i></p><p><i>But now after coming here, spending more than four years on this planet, I realized it&rsquo;s not good to kill the current generation because of the mistakes your ancestors did. So I remained silent. Hidden. Trying to adjust in this planet, to make it my home. So that she couldn&rsquo;t complete her intentions and my family won&rsquo;t be hurt. I&rsquo;m no more like her. I just prayed to meet my family, to go back home, my real home. But, it can&rsquo;t happen.&rdquo;</i></p><p>I was just finished with telling the truth. I didn&rsquo;t even notice Peter&rsquo;s reaction when I heard someone&rsquo;s footsteps behind before I could even turn to see who it was, I felt electrocuted. My body was shivering at an immense rate, making my vision blurry, I turned back to see Fury, Nick Fury?!</p><p>This taser is of course not working on two 3-volt lithium batteries, like the normal one, its fucking something higher than 10 volts!</p><p>Peter wasn&rsquo;t responding, he was looking at me in disbelief.</p><p><i>Something wrong is going to happen.</i><br/><i>Wait it&rsquo;s actually happening!</i></p><p>I could pass out within nano-seconds, so I intentionally made my trembling body fall over Peter, secretly sliding that ring into that nearly invisible Spider-man suit pocket.</p><p>After that, what else can happen? Who can resist this extreme taser shock?</p><p>So&hellip; I fainted, even Thor couldn&rsquo;t resist this taser attack, who am I?</p><p>Everything went black, just black&hellip;!</p><p>\u2022\u2022\u2022<br/>I woke about 15 minutes later! How do I know this? There is a freakin&rsquo; wall clock, just in front of me. There is a bed, a desk with a flower pot, a wooden floor with a carpet laid, there were lamps, an entirely furnished room!</p><p><i>I didn&rsquo;t know SHIELD prison looked like this?</i></p><p>Just the only negative thing is that I&rsquo;m tied to a chair.</p><p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure it isn&rsquo;t SHIELD!</p><p>And as speaking of SHIELD, I heard the door cracking open revealing Nick Fury.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know your prison facilities were so much better than my own bedroom.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The queen purchased the best facility in New York, till she finds the ring.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Queen? Ring? Fu-Fury?&rdquo;</p><p>And he laughed at my question, moving his arm towards his face lifting up skin???</p><p>And his face showed picture cells, like on an electronic screen.</p><p>&ldquo;You know these photostatic veil made by Selwyn have served a lot of SHIELD and HYDRA agents and now they are serving Chromicoms too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jonah&hellip;?! &rdquo;</p><p>That voice was of Jonah, and he pulled off that nano face mask revealing his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Peter??&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You mean that kid standing with you? I convinced him that you were found guilty of contacting our Queen Dorothea. He appeared so broken when he handed you to us&rdquo; he explained with a fake pout.</p><p>&ldquo;Asshole,&rdquo; I said trying to get out of the ropes, failing miserably.</p><p>&ldquo;Awww&hellip; Young love, so cute&rdquo;</p><p>I turned my head, hearing another voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Dorothea??!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thea, call me Queen Thea!&rdquo;</p><p>That evil Dorothea showed up in front of me, biting an apple held by her hands full of rings and jewellery.</p><p>&ldquo;He is gonna miss you, so sad for him,&rdquo; she said pressing her lips.</p><p>&ldquo;I think we should kill her, your highness, she failed in finding the ring&rdquo; Jonah spoke up.</p><p>&ldquo;Kill me and you won&rsquo;t even know where the ring is now,&rdquo; I said slightly laughing.</p><p>&ldquo;You already found it&rdquo; &lsquo;Thea&rsquo; curiously asked keeping her apple down.</p><p>&ldquo;Found it four years ago, just changed my mind, handling it to you&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What? but you said you were still finding it? &rdquo; Jonah got confused.</p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I lie?&rdquo; I said tilting my head.</p><p>&ldquo;Where is it now?? &rdquo; he yelled.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s over Jonah. Sending me fake information&rdquo; Thea said, taking out a sword that was hanging from her armour.</p><p>Jonah pleaded not to kill him, but she passed that sword into his abdomen in one go, making him fall on the ground dead. I almost freaked out at this.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t wanna die too right? Tell me where is the last ring?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t kill me, Thea, you need me to get it for you.&rdquo;</p><p>She groaned.</p><p>&ldquo;Then tell where is it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Only after my death.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You got so uptight living, with these poor humans, but I got a solution to this!&rdquo; she tittered, moving back.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>And then with a thud sound, 4 metal walls surrounded me, one of them had a glass window. The ropes were automatically untied with a clicking sound. I rushed up from the chair. I banged through the glass window, only to see Dorothea laughing, faintly.

We were thankful to our new king who made all this possible. His name was Enoch. He lived 365 years for us, to ensure that his children lived, he was my great great grandfather. He was so much different from his elder brother Kaius, the king of Atlantis, the reason why we were abandoned to a far-flung planet. Enoch was a God for all of us, everyone loved him, everyone prayed day and night so that he could live forever, enlighten all the coming generations. We thought that the prayers were the thing keeping him alive, until one day after 365 years he finally died.</i></p><p><i>The day was a historical day, everyone was mourning for him, Enoch was considered divine, his death was something beyond belief. We were wrong! He wasn\u2019t alive so long, because of him being divine or holy, but because of the 3 rings, he owned. He never wore them, but he was connected to them. The rings were miles, even light years apart from him, but still he could use their powers. He died because someone else found them, 2 of them. Her name was Dorothea, Kauis\u2019s only heir. She was close to Enoch, he loved her like a daughter. She used his love to find out the reason for his immortality and succeeded. She captured 2 of the rings that were buried deep inside Chronicom by Enoch. The sudden retrieval of 2 of the 3 rings made Enoch weak, he died of that. Dorothea made herself young again, we thought she would kill all of us, but she rather introduced better food and living for us. I befriended her, she was my far relative. I was just 10 years old and that 200 years old Dorothea who looked like she was 18, was already my best friend. Although I\u2019m 17, I can bet she still looks like 18. There was something in her, that made people believe her. And I loved to hang out with her, to get the spotlight. We became close friends, almost like sisters at least from my side. Everything was going so smooth, but then she finally revealed her plan. She finally found the location of the third and last ring, that was on Earth. So, she sent me here, to retrieve it. Her true intentions weren\u2019t to kill our people, but yours. If she gets all the 3 rings, she will make the whole Earth sunk underwater like Atlantis, killing everyone, to take revenge for the people of Atlantis who died, when we were abandoned. I supported her, in this plan. I did support her, I too wanted revenge. Also, she threatened me to kill my family if I fail.</i></p><p><i>But now after coming here, spending more than four years on this planet, I realized it\u2019s not good to kill the current generation because of the mistakes your ancestors did. So I remained silent. Hidden. Trying to adjust in this planet, to make it my home. So that she couldn\u2019t complete her intentions and my family won\u2019t be hurt. I\u2019m no more like her. I just prayed to meet my family, to go back home, my real home. But, it can\u2019t happen.\u201d</i></p><p>I was just finished with telling the truth. I didn\u2019t even notice Peter\u2019s reaction when I heard someone\u2019s footsteps behind before I could even turn to see who it was, I felt electrocuted. My body was shivering at an immense rate, making my vision blurry, I turned back to see Fury, Nick Fury?!</p><p>This taser is of course not working on two 3-volt lithium batteries, like the normal one, its fucking something higher than 10 volts!</p><p>Peter wasn\u2019t responding, he was looking at me in disbelief.</p><p><i>Something wrong is going to happen.</i><br><i>Wait it\u2019s actually happening!</i></p><p>I could pass out within nano-seconds, so I intentionally made my trembling body fall over Peter, secretly sliding that ring into that nearly invisible Spider-man suit pocket.</p><p>After that, what else can happen? Who can resist this extreme taser shock?</p><p>So\u2026 I fainted, even Thor couldn\u2019t resist this taser attack, who am I?</p><p>Everything went black, just black\u2026!</p><p>\u2022\u2022\u2022<br>I woke about 15 minutes later! How do I know this? There is a freakin\u2019 wall clock, just in front of me. There is a bed, a desk with a flower pot, a wooden floor with a carpet laid, there were lamps, an entirely furnished room!</p><p><i>I didn\u2019t know SHIELD prison looked like this?</i></p><p>Just the only negative thing is that I\u2019m tied to a chair.</p><p>I\u2019m pretty sure it isn\u2019t SHIELD!</p><p>And as speaking of SHIELD, I heard the door cracking open revealing Nick Fury.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know your prison facilities were so much better than my own bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe queen purchased the best facility in New York, till she finds the ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQueen?

Sending me fake information\u201d Thea said, taking out a sword that was hanging from her armour.</p><p>Jonah pleaded not to kill him, but she passed that sword into his abdomen in one go, making him fall on the ground dead. I almost freaked out at this.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t wanna die too right? Tell me where is the last ring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t kill me, Thea, you need me to get it for you.\u201d</p><p>She groaned.</p><p>\u201cThen tell where is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly after my death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got so uptight living, with these poor humans, but I got a solution to this!\u201d she tittered, moving back.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>And then with a thud sound, 4 metal walls surrounded me, one of them had a glass window.

I took a deep sigh, closing my eyes shut.</p><p>It seemed like someone pressed the rewind button, that too in 8x speed, leaving me at the beginning, the very beginning!</p><p><i>&ldquo;It took centuries to make Chronicom a green, happy planet. We were thankful to our new king who made all this possible. His name was Enoch. He lived 365 years for us, to ensure that his children lived, he was my great great grandfather. He was so much different from his elder brother Kaius, the king of Atlantis, the reason why we were abandoned to a far-flung planet. Enoch was a God for all of us, everyone loved him, everyone prayed day and night so that he could live forever, enlighten all the coming generations. We thought that the prayers were the thing keeping him alive, until one day after 365 years he finally died.</i></p><p><i>The day was a historical day, everyone was mourning for him, Enoch was considered divine, his death was something beyond belief. We were wrong! He wasn&rsquo;t alive so long, because of him being divine or holy, but because of the 3 rings, he owned. He never wore them, but he was connected to them. The rings were miles, even light years apart from him, but still he could use their powers. He died because someone else found them, 2 of them. Her name was Dorothea, Kauis&rsquo;s only heir. She was close to Enoch, he loved her like a daughter. She used his love to find out the reason for his immortality and succeeded. She captured 2 of the rings that were buried deep inside Chronicom by Enoch. The sudden retrieval of 2 of the 3 rings made Enoch weak, he died of that. Dorothea made herself young again, we thought she would kill all of us, but she rather introduced better food and living for us. I befriended her, she was my far relative. I was just 10 years old and that 200 years old Dorothea who looked like she was 18, was already my best friend. Although I&rsquo;m 17, I can bet she still looks like 18. There was something in her, that made people believe her. And I loved to hang out with her, to get the spotlight. We became close friends, almost like sisters at least from my side. Everything was going so smooth, but then she finally revealed her plan. She finally found the location of the third and last ring, that was on Earth. So, she sent me here, to retrieve it. Her true intentions weren&rsquo;t to kill our people, but yours. If she gets all the 3 rings, she will make the whole Earth sunk underwater like Atlantis, killing everyone, to take revenge for the people of Atlantis who died, when we were abandoned. I supported her, in this plan. I did support her, I too wanted revenge. Also, she threatened me to kill my family if I fail.</i></p><p><i>But now after coming here, spending more than four years on this planet, I realized it&rsquo;s not good to kill the current generation because of the mistakes your ancestors did. So I remained silent. Hidden. Trying to adjust in this planet, to make it my home. So that she couldn&rsquo;t complete her intentions and my family won&rsquo;t be hurt. I&rsquo;m no more like her. I just prayed to meet my family, to go back home, my real home. But, it can&rsquo;t happen.&rdquo;</i></p><p>I was just finished with telling the truth. I didn&rsquo;t even notice Peter&rsquo;s reaction when I heard someone&rsquo;s footsteps behind before I could even turn to see who it was, I felt electrocuted. My body was shivering at an immense rate, making my vision blurry, I turned back to see Fury, Nick Fury?!</p><p>This taser is of course not working on two 3-volt lithium batteries, like the normal one, its fucking something higher than 10 volts!</p><p>Peter wasn&rsquo;t responding, he was looking at me in disbelief.</p><p><i>Something wrong is going to happen.</i><br /><i>Wait it&rsquo;s actually happening!</i></p><p>I could pass out within nano-seconds, so I intentionally made my trembling body fall over Peter, secretly sliding that ring into that nearly invisible Spider-man suit pocket.</p><p>After that, what else can happen? Who can resist this extreme taser shock?</p><p>So&hellip; I fainted, even Thor couldn&rsquo;t resist this taser attack, who am I?</p><p>Everything went black, just black&hellip;!</p><p>&bull;&bull;&bull;<br />I woke about 15 minutes later! How do I know this? There is a freakin&rsquo; wall clock, just in front of me. There is a bed, a desk with a flower pot, a wooden floor with a carpet laid, there were lamps, an entirely furnished room!</p><p><i>I didn&rsquo;t know SHIELD prison looked like this?</i></p><p>Just the only negative thing is that I&rsquo;m tied to a chair.</p><p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure it isn&rsquo;t SHIELD!</p><p>And as speaking of SHIELD, I heard the door cracking open revealing Nick Fury.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know your prison facilities were so much better than my own bedroom.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The queen purchased the best facility in New York, till she finds the ring.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Queen? Ring? Fu-Fury?&rdquo;</p><p>And he laughed at my question, moving his arm towards his face lifting up skin???</p><p>And his face showed picture cells, like on an electronic screen.</p><p>&ldquo;You know these photostatic veil made by Selwyn have served a lot of SHIELD and HYDRA agents and now they are serving Chromicoms too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jonah&hellip;?! &rdquo;</p><p>That voice was of Jonah, and he pulled off that nano face mask revealing his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Peter??&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You mean that kid standing with you? I convinced him that you were found guilty of contacting our Queen Dorothea. He appeared so broken when he handed you to us&rdquo; he explained with a fake pout.</p><p>&ldquo;Asshole,&rdquo; I said trying to get out of the ropes, failing miserably.</p><p>&ldquo;Awww&hellip; Young love, so cute&rdquo;</p><p>I turned my head, hearing another voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Dorothea??!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thea, call me Queen Thea!&rdquo;</p><p>That evil Dorothea showed up in front of me, biting an apple held by her hands full of rings and jewellery.</p><p>&ldquo;He is gonna miss you, so sad for him,&rdquo; she said pressing her lips.</p><p>&ldquo;I think we should kill her, your highness, she failed in finding the ring&rdquo; Jonah spoke up.</p><p>&ldquo;Kill me and you won&rsquo;t even know where the ring is now,&rdquo; I said slightly laughing.</p><p>&ldquo;You already found it&rdquo; &lsquo;Thea&rsquo; curiously asked keeping her apple down.</p><p>&ldquo;Found it four years ago, just changed my mind, handling it to you&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What? but you said you were still finding it? &rdquo; Jonah got confused.</p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I lie?&rdquo; I said tilting my head.</p><p>&ldquo;Where is it now?? &rdquo; he yelled.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s over Jonah. Sending me fake information&rdquo; Thea said, taking out a sword that was hanging from her armour.</p><p>Jonah pleaded not to kill him, but she passed that sword into his abdomen in one go, making him fall on the ground dead. I almost freaked out at this.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t wanna die too right? Tell me where is the last ring?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t kill me, Thea, you need me to get it for you.&rdquo;</p><p>She groaned.</p><p>&ldquo;Then tell where is it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Only after my death.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You got so uptight living, with these poor humans, but I got a solution to this!&rdquo; she tittered, moving back.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>And then with a thud sound, 4 metal walls surrounded me, one of them had a glass window. The ropes were automatically untied with a clicking sound. I rushed up from the chair. I banged through the glass window, only to see Dorothea laughing, faintly. She had a controller in her hand, like a remote control, and in a flash that room looked like an aeroplane, accompanied by the sound of ejection sequence. I peeped through the window only to see the plane&rsquo;s floor beneath my storage pod was opening revealing a big ocean underneath.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t any facility in New York, it was a freakin&rsquo; hellicarrier.</p><p>&ldquo;I can find that ring myself, it will be an honour to die in the Atlantic Ocean with our ancestors,&rdquo; she said, watching my storage pod clinging to the side of the opening.</p><p>I banged that window with my whole strength, screaming and screaming, but she just watched my pod falling from a great altitude into that ocean.</p><p>Due to gravity, my body floated to the roof of the storage pod, making my head bang to its roof.

This is just a normal blog where I just detail my interests and ocasionally rant about comics, films, or media like normal people. I am also clinically depressed and been asked to commit to a hospital, but it's Florida and they want to dope me up with enough drugs so I can't feel aything without my permission if I do commit myself. I rather be in pain than numb to feeling things. Anyways, off on that bleak and dark point, welcome and enjoy.</p>",

Just fluff!</p><p>It was Friday night, and as the nights grew darker earlier, your stress grew greater as well, as midterms gloomed near.<br/></p><p>You were sat in your room, leaning on your arm as your eyes pored over the material in your textbook, your eyes struggling to stay awake as your head slowly&hellip;.slid down your arm&hellip;. and hit your&hellip;. desk, shaking yourself awake as not to slam your face into your book.</p><p>You exhaled deeply and looked over to your roommate, who was also studying but had fallen asleep with an open notebook filled with History notes.</p><p>You yawned and rubbed your eyes, about to turn in for the night, when you got a sudden text from your boyfriend.</p><p>Laying in his room, Peter was sprawled in his bed, the TV on as he watched a movie.</p><p>He wasn&rsquo;t really paying attention, having you on his mind.</p><p>He then decided to text you, wanting to check on you since he hadn&rsquo;t seen you lately and was concerned.</p><p><b>Peter: Hey Babe.</b></p><p><b>You: Hey Peter.</b></p><p><b>Peter: So, what are you doing? Studying as per usual?</b></p><p><b>You: Yes, of course. But I\u2019m really tired, I don\u2019t think I&rsquo;ll be able to keep my eyes open for much longer.</b></p><p><b>Peter: Then come over to my dorm, I\u2019ll cuddle you to sleep.</b></p><p><b>You: Peter, c'mon&hellip;</b></p><p><b>Peter: Pleaseee? Come on, I haven\u2019t seen you all week, upcoming finals week has got you cooped up in your room.</b></p><p><b>Peter: Your boyfriend misses you, babe.</b></p><p><b>Peter: Please come to my dorm and fall asleep with your boyfriend who misses you dearly??</b></p><p>You bit your lip as you left Peter waiting for an answer, looking over to your roommate, Michelle, who was fast asleep, her phone ringing.</p><p>You got up and looked at her phone, noticing it was one of your best friends calling.</p><p>You smiled lightly and picked it up, knowing she wouldn&rsquo;t mind since you two had been friends since high school.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Ned.\u00a0Michelle&rsquo;s here sleeping, so feel free to come over and keep her company. I&rsquo;m headed to Peter&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;ll leave the door open for you. Hopefully, she\u2019ll be up by then.
