        "answer": "<p>Yes. Apart from Robb, Bran is the Stark whose presence is strongest in Theon\u2019s arc. Bran was the Stark in Winterfell\u00a0 when Theon took it and he witnessed Theon at his lowest. Theon hurt people Bran loved like maester Luwin and in the show Rodrick. Bran spoke to Theon through the weirwood tree which helped Theon break past the Reek persona. The show has replaced Bran\u2019s presence in Theon\u2019s life with Jon and Sansa because the show ableist trash to both Bran and Theon. I love Theon and Sansa scenes a lot but the show has had a habit of reducing Bran\u2019s importance from his powers, his connection to the Others/Night King, Winterfell and his family. I do think Bran and Theon will meet again in both canons but D&amp;D won\u2019t do it any justice.</p><p>As for the books, Bran will stop Stannis from executing Theon. This to me is the biggest proof that Bran will not pass the sentence and kill Theon for his crimes. In fact if Theon goes to the Iron Islands to render the Kingsmoot, well moot, then it\u2019ll be because Bran tells him what Euron is doing. Maybe I\u2019m being sappy because they are two of my favourite characters apart from Sansa, Catelyn and Cersei but I do think Bran will forgive Theon and give him both peace and purpose. Yes, Theon hurt Bran greatly but I don\u2019t know, I\u2019ll love it if Bran said,\u00a0\u201cDespite everything, I forgive you.\u201d If Bran does execute Theon, I\u2019ll be sad but not angry.</p>",

        "body": "<h1>Why favouritism sucks</h1><p>Recently I came across a video where J.K Rowling was talking about the movies of Hp with Daniel Radcliffe and Steve Kloves, the writer of the Hp movie scripts.</p><p>And something caught my attention. Steve said that his favourite character was not Harry but in fact it was Hermione. And that is when I understood why movie!Hermione is the way she is. </p><p>We know in the books Hermione is smart, independent, brave and strong. However she\u2019s still far from perfect. She has lots of flaws, including lack of empathy, emotional breakdowns during times of crisis, arrogance and narrow mindedness. </p><p>Albeit, in the movies those negative traits are completely absent. Instead she\u2019s the most sensitive and empathetic of the trio, level headed in times of stress and only acts like a know it all in the first movie which makes her totally unrelatable as a character because she\u2019s just perfect. Now that\u2019s not even my main issue here. What really bothers me is how Hermione\u2019s flawless nature affects other character\u2019s portrayal therefore how they\u2019re perceived by the audience. Aside from the fact that Hermione being too flawless takes away her authenticity, it\u2019s also at the expense of other characters. Best example: Ron Weasley. </p><p>A lot of great moments in the books that Ron had were given to Hermione in the movies (like in the 3rd movie when Hermione defended Harry in front of Lupin and Sirius or in the 1st movie when she instantly came up with the spell that saved Ron\u2019s life, even though in the books she freaked out and Ron was the one who calmed her down). So obviously a lot of people that have only watched the movies don\u2019t really care about Ron and think he\u2019s useless. At the same time Hermione is their fave because she\u2019s fierce and smart and sweet (not to mention absolutely beautiful which is also a deviation from the books). And that whole mischaracterization comes from the fact that Hermione was the writer\u2019s fave. She was completely whitewashed since being the writer\u2019s fave results in idealisation and ignorance of flaws. </p><p>That is a huge problem that I\u2019ve also encountered in GoT. The character that is the writer\u2019s fave (D&amp;D and Brian Cogman\u2019s in particular) is Sansa Stark. Beforehand I don\u2019t have a problem with book!Sansa. I actually like her. She\u2019s realistic and fully fleshed out. Show!Sansa however is portrayed as way more compassionate, fierce and superior. I wouldn\u2019t even have a problem with that IF it wasn\u2019t at the expense of other characters, particularly Jon and Arya. They took a lot of elements from Arya\u2019s arc that were only relevant and crucial in her story and gave them to Sansa (the lone wolf speech that was only given to Arya and only appears in her chapters because she is the most pack and family-oriented and fully identifies as a wolf, Sansa as the key to the north even though in the books they emphasise Sansa as being the one with the weakest connection to the north and Arya even being the one that got married off to Ramsay though it was not really Arya but that\u2019s what was believed). They also changed Arya and Sansa\u2019s dynamic and turned Arya into the \u201cproblem\u201d by making her mean and resentful towards Sansa despite it being the other way around in the books. That was in order to make Sansa more likeable and sympathetic. </p><p>Moreover, Sansa is also shown as the \u201csmartest Stark\u201d and clearly superior to the rest. But that\u2019s really not true at all. Arya is incredibly smart and perceptive, she is good at math and knows how to solve problems with cunning and stealth, Jon is a military strategist and Bran is also very wise and insightful. In the show however, they tend to dumb down all the characters that interact with Sansa in order to establish her intelligence and intellectual superiority. (I mean Sansa knowing more about armor than actual armorers that are dealing with this their whole life? Really?) </p><p>That again is the consequence of favouritism. It has come to the point where I wouldn\u2019t even be surprised anymore if Sansa suddenly knew more about ruling and warfare than Dany even though she\u2019s a Queen and knows all about conquering (at least more than Sansa). </p><p>As I\u2019ve already mentioned my problem is not really Sansa\u2019s flawlessness it\u2019s more how that affects other characters\u2019 story lines and personalities. If Arya and Jon were still true to their book counterparts when interacting with Sansa, I would even be fine with that. But that\u2019s not the case. Jon turns into a  dumb idiot and Arya an irrational rage ball when sharing a scene with Sansa. And that change is solely made to prop up Sansa because she\u2019s the show writers\u2019 favourite character (which is also a contradiction in itself because if she was their fave then why would they change her and her story line?). </p><p>My point is favouritism does not just negatively affect the character that\u2019s favoured but also every other character. </p>",

Now that\u2019s not even my main issue here. What really bothers me is how Hermione\u2019s flawless nature affects other character\u2019s portrayal therefore how they\u2019re perceived by the audience. Aside from the fact that Hermione being too flawless takes away her authenticity, it\u2019s also at the expense of other characters. Best example: Ron Weasley. </p><p>A lot of great moments in the books that Ron had were given to Hermione in the movies (like in the 3rd movie when Hermione defended Harry in front of Lupin and Sirius or in the 1st movie when she instantly came up with the spell that saved Ron\u2019s life, even though in the books she freaked out and Ron was the one who calmed her down). So obviously a lot of people that have only watched the movies don\u2019t really care about Ron and think he\u2019s useless. At the same time Hermione is their fave because she\u2019s fierce and smart and sweet (not to mention absolutely beautiful which is also a deviation from the books). And that whole mischaracterization comes from the fact that Hermione was the writer\u2019s fave. She was completely whitewashed since being the writer\u2019s fave results in idealisation and ignorance of flaws. </p><p>That is a huge problem that I\u2019ve also encountered in GoT. The character that is the writer\u2019s fave (D&amp;D and Brian Cogman\u2019s in particular) is Sansa Stark. Beforehand I don\u2019t have a problem with book!Sansa. I actually like her.
