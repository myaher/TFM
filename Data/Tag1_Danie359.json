Dan couldn&rsquo;t believe that the day was finally here. After months of talking over </i>Skype<i> he was finally going to be meeting the </i>amazingphil<i>. Dan&rsquo;s hand shook as he picked up his backpack and threw it over his shoulder. He had almost not come today because he was scared Phil was just playing a huge joke on him and really wasn&rsquo;t going to meet him. Of course, he had not voiced these fears to Phil when they had talked on the phone until 3 AM last night.\u00a0</i><br/><i>His whole body shook with fear and excitement as he exited the train and stepped onto the platform. His scanned his eyes through the crowd, hoping to spot the raven-haired boy. His breathing sped up and his breath caught in his throat as his chocolate brown eyes found a familiar pair of blue ones that he had grown to love over the last few months. Phil hadn&rsquo;t spotted him yet, but that didn&rsquo;t stop Dan, who took off towards him, pushing through the crowd of people. The moment Phil spotted him his smile grew huge.</i><br/><i>Dan couldn&rsquo;t believe he was finally here, couldn&rsquo;t believe that Phil was actually here. Phil looked even more beautiful in person than he did over his shitty webcam. Dan&rsquo;s heart raced in his chest as he got closer and closer.</i><br/><i>Dan let out a breath as Phil pulled him in for a bone-crushing hug.</i><br/><b>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;re finally here!&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;Sorry I was a bit late, the train was running behind schedule.&rdquo; <i>Dan breathed into Phil&rsquo;s shoulder.</i></b><br/><b>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ok, you&rsquo;re here now and that is all that matters.&rdquo;<br/></b><i>Phil pulled away to look at him and his smile grew wider as his eyes found Dan&rsquo;s.</i><br/><i>&ldquo;So, you ready to go?&rdquo; Phil rocked back and forth and rubbed his neck awkwardly.</i><br/><b>&ldquo;Y-y-Yeah.&rdquo;</b><i> He stuttered. He smiled at Phil and bumped his shoulder into his as the started to walk.</i><br/><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really glad I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo; He said smiling at Phil.</i><br/><i>&ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; Phil said with a huge grin breaking out on his face.</i></p><p>~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>Dan was once again pinned to the dirty floor, one of the men was on top of him and the other in the corner, watching. He doesn&rsquo;t know when he had stopped fighting, but he knows he must have been out of it for a few days. He had woke up on that blasted metal table again, and he knew he must have been in little space for at least a few days. There were an array of new bruises scattered on his body that hadn&rsquo;t been there before, and he noticed he had lost a little weight, so he must have been out of it for at least three or four days. He figures little Dan had stopped fighting as well because the men didn&rsquo;t seem to notice the change in him. They had drug him straight from the room with the metal table back to his cell, not even giving him time to recover before they were on top of him, assaulting him again.<br/>He heard a grunt from above him signifying that the men were finished. He pulled out and gave Dan&rsquo;s ass a smack and both of them were gone. He has no idea how many times he had been assaulted over the last few days but it must be a lot because of the dried blood all over his legs. He was in pain all over the place, but it was especially bad in his rear. There was also an acute pain in his chest, so he must have developed a bad cold since he had been kidnapped. Dane let out a low, hard cough. He curled himself into a ball and hoped to catch a few hours of sleep before the men came back.</p><p>He jolted awake as the sound of the door being unlock rang through the room. He didn&rsquo;t know how long he was asleep, but by the way he was still exhausted it couldn&rsquo;t have been very long. He sat up and the door opened to reveal the men, but this time they were lugging in what he suspected was another bucket of water judging from the sloshing sound coming from it as it was dropped to the floor.</p><p><b>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to try something a little different, princess.&quot;\u00a0</b><br/>The look In Seth&rsquo;s eyes was so dark and evil Dan&rsquo;s body shivered in fear. He had given up long ago trying, so he didn&rsquo;t even resist as Roger dragged him over to the bucket of water.<br/>&quot;Look, Seth, the little slut is so broken. If his daddy didn&rsquo;t want him before then <b>he surely won&rsquo;t want him now.&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;So pathetic. Such a worthless, little slut, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</b><br/>Roger hummed in agreement.</p><p>Dan had no doubt that what they were saying was true\u2014f Phil didn&rsquo;t want him before he definitely wouldn&rsquo;t want him now. He was spoiled goods, worthless and unlovable.<br/>He squeezed his eyes shut just in time to feel a hand grip the back of his head and push him down into the bucket. If his lungs hadn&rsquo;t been on fire before, they were now.<br/>He couldn&rsquo;t breathe, his survival instincts kicking in and he started to struggle, trying to pull his head to the surface to get some air, but with no avail, he was just pushed deeper into the bucket. He knew this was the end as his vision started to go black, but before he had fully slipped out of consciousness he was pulled to the surface. He had just enough time to gulp in a huge lungful of air before he was being pushed back under.<br/>This happened several more times before he was thrown, spitting and sputtering back onto the mattress.<br/><b>&ldquo;Get some rest, princess, there will be more of that later,&rdquo;</b> Seth said as he flashed an evil grin Dan&rsquo;s way. Both men exited the room, but before they slammed the door shut the man Roger gave him a creepy wink.<br/>Once the men were gone Dan all but collapsed onto the mattress with the nightmares pulling him under.</p><p>************<br/><b>&ldquo;Mr. Lester&hellip;&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;Call me Phil.&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;Alright. Phil, we believe this is the man who abducted Dan.&rdquo;</b> Officer Temple pointed to a grainy looking picture.<br/><b>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;Someone who saw the abduction happen from the park finally came forward and identified this man.&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;What do you know about him?</b>&rdquo; Phil asked still looking at the photo.</p><p><b>&ldquo;His name is Seth Conray. He has a record of domestic abuse against his girlfriend and has several charges of sexual assault.&rdquo;</b><br/>Phil couldn&rsquo;t believe how was this monster allowed to roam the street freely. When he voiced this to Officer Temple, the man just gave Phil a sympathetic look.\u00a0<br/><b>&ldquo;The last woman who accused him of sexual assault pulled out of testifying at the last minute and the case was thrown out due to the lack of her testimony.&rdquo;</b><br/>Phil clenched his fist. He was by no means a violent person, but he was trying really hard not to hit something right now because getting thrown in a cell wouldn&rsquo;t help Dan right now.<br/><b>&ldquo;Mr. Conray inherited a cabin last year from his grandfather who passed away, and we suspect that is where he may have taken Dan.&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;Well Let&rsquo;s go then!&rdquo;</b> Phil exclaimed as he reached for his coat.</p><p><b>&ldquo;Hold on, We need to wait for the officers that have been dispatched to get back with us.&rdquo;</b><br/><b>&ldquo;Are you fucking kidding me!&rdquo;</b> He finally exploded.<b> &ldquo;My boyfriend has been missing for a week now and you tell me you know who took him and you want me to wait? This is ridiculous!&rdquo;</b> His chest was heaving now. Officer Temple looked at him, clearly startled by his outburst. <b>&ldquo;Listen, I need to find him, I need to see him. I love him.&rdquo; </b>Phil whispered as he closed his eyes.</p><p>The whole police station seemed to be quiet.\u00a0<br/><b>&ldquo;Listen, the most I can do for you is drive you out there. It&rsquo;ll be against the books, but I&rsquo;m willing to take the fall for it.&rdquo; </b>He put his hand on Phil&rsquo;s shoulder. Phil opened his eyes slowly. The Officer was looking at him with pity, but he didn&rsquo;t care. All he cared about was saving Dan. So he nodded his head and followed Officer Temple out of the Police station.<br/>I&rsquo;m coming, Dan, he thought, just hold on a little bit longer.</p>",

He had almost not come today because he was scared Phil was just playing a huge joke on him and really wasn\u2019t going to meet him. Of course, he had not voiced these fears to Phil when they had talked on the phone until 3 AM last night.\u00a0</i><br><i>His whole body shook with fear and excitement as he exited the train and stepped onto the platform. His scanned his eyes through the crowd, hoping to spot the raven-haired boy. His breathing sped up and his breath caught in his throat as his chocolate brown eyes found a familiar pair of blue ones that he had grown to love over the last few months. Phil hadn\u2019t spotted him yet, but that didn\u2019t stop Dan, who took off towards him, pushing through the crowd of people. The moment Phil spotted him his smile grew huge.</i><br><i>Dan couldn\u2019t believe he was finally here, couldn\u2019t believe that Phil was actually here.

He doesn\u2019t know when he had stopped fighting, but he knows he must have been out of it for a few days. He had woke up on that blasted metal table again, and he knew he must have been in little space for at least a few days. There were an array of new bruises scattered on his body that hadn\u2019t been there before, and he noticed he had lost a little weight, so he must have been out of it for at least three or four days. He figures little Dan had stopped fighting as well because the men didn\u2019t seem to notice the change in him. They had drug him straight from the room with the metal table back to his cell, not even giving him time to recover before they were on top of him, assaulting him again.<br>He heard a grunt from above him signifying that the men were finished. He pulled out and gave Dan\u2019s ass a smack and both of them were gone. He has no idea how many times he had been assaulted over the last few days but it must be a lot because of the dried blood all over his legs. He was in pain all over the place, but it was especially bad in his rear. There was also an acute pain in his chest, so he must have developed a bad cold since he had been kidnapped. Dane let out a low, hard cough. He curled himself into a ball and hoped to catch a few hours of sleep before the men came back.</p><p>He jolted awake as the sound of the door being unlock rang through the room. He didn\u2019t know how long he was asleep, but by the way he was still exhausted it couldn\u2019t have been very long. He sat up and the door opened to reveal the men, but this time they were lugging in what he suspected was another bucket of water judging from the sloshing sound coming from it as it was dropped to the floor.</p><p><b>\u201cWe\u2019re going to try something a little different, princess.\"\u00a0</b><br>The look In Seth\u2019s eyes was so dark and evil Dan\u2019s body shivered in fear. He had given up long ago trying, so he didn\u2019t even resist as Roger dragged him over to the bucket of water.<br>\"Look, Seth, the little slut is so broken. If his daddy didn\u2019t want him before then <b>he surely won\u2019t want him now.\u201d<br>\u201cSo pathetic.

He was spoiled goods, worthless and unlovable.<br>He squeezed his eyes shut just in time to feel a hand grip the back of his head and push him down into the bucket. If his lungs hadn\u2019t been on fire before, they were now.<br>He couldn\u2019t breathe, his survival instincts kicking in and he started to struggle, trying to pull his head to the surface to get some air, but with no avail, he was just pushed deeper into the bucket. He knew this was the end as his vision started to go black, but before he had fully slipped out of consciousness he was pulled to the surface. He had just enough time to gulp in a huge lungful of air before he was being pushed back under.<br>This happened several more times before he was thrown, spitting and sputtering back onto the mattress.<br><b>\u201cGet some rest, princess, there will be more of that later,\u201d</b> Seth said as he flashed an evil grin Dan\u2019s way.
