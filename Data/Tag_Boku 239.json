She&rsquo;s going to eat him!!!&rdquo; Sero was near tears at this point as he gripped his friend&rsquo;s arm.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, I have an idea!&rdquo; Half dragging the other boy, Kaminari ran off towards where you had disappeared in pursuit of Tokoyami, leaving Kirishima to stare after the two, one eyebrow quirked in confusion.</p><p>&ldquo;What was that about? Can&rsquo;t they tell she has a crush on him?&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Gulping, your fists clenched and unclenched nervously, palms sweaty. Today was the day! You were finally going to confess to the boy you&rsquo;d been crushing on for months!</p><p>Ahead of you, the object of your affections ran a hand through his black feathers, catching sight of you following him from the corner of his eye. You froze, unable to breath, as Tokoyami turned his red eyes on you questioningly.</p><p>As he stared at you, bird-like eyes making your heart beat faster, you almost lost the courage it&rsquo;d taken you months to summon. Everything you&rsquo;d practiced was thrown out the window as your mind went blank, an embarrassing blush creeping up your neck and making your face burn.</p><p>&lsquo;Say something, idiot!&rsquo; your mind screamed.</p><p>&ldquo;(L/n)?&rdquo; Tokoyami tilted his head to the side, the movement like that of a curious bird.</p><p>Gulping, your mouth opened and closed a few times before you took a deep breath.</p><p>'Just tell him you like him! Simple as that!&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Toko-!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey! Tokoyami what&rsquo;s up!&rdquo; Seeming to appear out of nowhere, Kaminari and Sero wrapped their arms around the feathered boy&rsquo;s shoulders, all easy laughs and smiles, without a clue as to what they&rsquo;d just interrupted.</p><p>You blinked, mouth hanging open as the relationship changing words you&rsquo;d been about to say died on your tongue. As you watched with wide, surprised eyes, Kaminari and Sero pulled Tokoyami away, already talking about something that you couldn&rsquo;t really make out over the blood rushing in your ears.</p><p>Sighing, you leaned your forehead against a wall, trying to calm your still racing heartbeat. A part of you was relieved by the distraction- what if Tokoyami had rejected you, after all?- but, after devoting so much effort and planning to this one, simple confession, disappointment quickly replaced your momentary relief.</p><p>Sighing again, you pulled your shoulders back and shook your head, shedding the heavy feeling that had entered your heart. You may not have been able to confess this time, but there&rsquo;d be other opportunities! What mattered most was that you didn&rsquo;t give up! Heartened, you blinked your tiger-like eyes and continued on your way.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Dude, that was so close!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know! She was totally about to eat him!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We barely made it in time!&rdquo;</p><p>Having successfully &ldquo;saved&rdquo; Tokoyami from the clutches of death, Kaminari and Sero slumped against each other, trying to catch their breath.</p><p>&ldquo;That was kinda scary actually&hellip;&rdquo; Sero mumbled, shivering a little. &ldquo;Did you see the glimmer in her eyes?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I did! It was really scary!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait&hellip;do you think she&rsquo;ll try again?&rdquo;</p><p>Both boys froze, brains slowly processing the idea, before suddenly springing up, falling over each other in their rush to find Tokoyami and protect him from your savage jaws once more.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Okay, second try!&rdquo; you mumbled to yourself, fists clenched in determination. Taking a deep breath, you walked up to where Tokoyami stood leaning against a wall, reading, before class started. &ldquo;You can do it!&rdquo; you whispered softly, trying to appear composed despite how fast your heart was pounding. &ldquo;H-hey, Tokoyami!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hmm? Oh, (L/n), good morning. Sorry about what happened earlier.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Huh? Oh! T-That&rsquo;s okay! No problem!&rdquo; Waving your hands in front of you, you hurriedly dismissed his apology, the beginnings of a nervous sweat breaking out on your palms.</p><p><i>'Now&rsquo;s the perfect opportunity! Confess!&rsquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;So, um, the thing is-!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tokoyami! I really need your help with something before class starts!&rdquo; Kaminari barreled into the cool mannered boy, nearly knocking him off his feet. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really important, man! We gotta go now!&rdquo; Joining Kaminari, Sero grabbed Tokoyami&rsquo;s arm, both boys dragging their surprised classmate away. </p><p>You stood frozen for a few seconds, mouth hanging open, before a deep, animalistic growl rumbled in your chest. Before it could grow, you swallowed forcefully, pushing down the tiger you could feel just below your skin. Whereas you were surprised before, now you were more annoyed. The first time this happened seemed like a likely coincidence, but a second time? No, Sero and Kaminari were up to something, you just didn&rsquo;t know what.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;What was that about?&rdquo; Tokoyami questioned, clearly annoyed.<br/></p><p>&ldquo;Uhhhhhh&hellip;&rdquo; Kaminari looked back and forth between the feathered boy and Sero, lacking an excuse.</p><p>&ldquo;W-Well, you know! We need your help!&rdquo; Sero tried.</p><p>&ldquo;With what?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;With what? Uhh&hellip;&rdquo; It was Sero&rsquo;s turn to look between Tokoyami and Kaminari, asking for help. Red eyes narrowing, Tokoyami crossed his arms, his annoyance obviously growing.</p><p>&ldquo;We-We were saving you, okay?!&rdquo; Kaminari confessed, breaking under the crow-headed boy&rsquo;s scrutiny. </p><p>Tokoyami blinked, confused. &ldquo;Saving me? What are you talking about?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;From (l/n)! She&rsquo;s trying to eat you!&rdquo; </p><p>A few silent beats passed before Tokoyami groaned, one hand palming his forehead.</p><p>&ldquo;Both of you are complete-.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>That</i> was it? You thought I was trying to <i>eat</i> him?!&rdquo; a usually timid voice said from around the corner, startling them. Stepping out, you leveled Kaminari and Sero with a glare, tiger eyes blazing. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so stupid! Why would I be trying to eat him?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a tiger, a cat! And he&rsquo;s a bird!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re people, not animals! You two are ridiculous!&rdquo; You could feel the frustrated tears forming in your eyes, but you couldn&rsquo;t help it, too embarrassed and upset to be shy like usual. Before you could think about it, the truth slipped out of your mouth. &ldquo;I was trying to confess to him, not eat him!&rdquo;</p><p>A second too late you realized what you&rsquo;d done, your hands covering your mouth. Your eyes dropped to the floor, unable to see the stunned faces of the three boys in front of you. Mind racing, you tried to think of what to do in this situation. Run? Don&rsquo;t run?</p><p>&ldquo;No way!&rdquo; Kaminari and Sero screeched in unison, disbelieving.</p><p>Run. You decided to run.</p><p>Turning on your heel, you fled, tears of mortification beginning to fall down your face. Behind you voices called your name, but you ignored them, human body shifting into that of a Siberian tiger. </p><p><i>'They thought I was going to eat him and now he knows! Tokoyami knows I like him and any chance I had is gone!&rsquo;</i></p><p>Heart hammering, you clawed your way up a tree blindly, hiding yourself in the dense branches. All you wanted to do at this point was disappear, forget about everything that had happened. You were so deeply ingrained in your thoughts that you didn&rsquo;t realize you weren&rsquo;t alone.</p><p>A tentative hand touched your furred shoulder, almost making you fall off your branch in surprise. Spinning around, you took in a winded Tokoyami, his fingers burying into your thick fur in an effort to keep you from running away. </p><p>&ldquo;(L/n)&hellip;(y/n), are you okay? Those two are just idiots, alright? Don&rsquo;t let them upset you.&rdquo; </p><p>A few awkward, silent moments passed before you let yourself shift back into human form, Tokoyami&rsquo;s hand leaving you shoulder uncertainly.</p><p>&ldquo;Was&hellip;&rdquo; he trailed off, fidgeting a little. &ldquo;Was what you said true? Were you trying to confess to me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;Yes,&rdquo; you murmured quietly, keeping your eyes turned away. There wasn&rsquo;t any point in lying now, the had already admitted it earlier. </p><p>&ldquo;So&hellip;you like me?&rdquo; Tokoyami almost sounded&hellip;nervous? Peaking at him, you saw him shift uncomfortably, his eyes still glued to you with an expression you couldn&rsquo;t place.</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;Yes,&rdquo; you whispered, blushing. Tokoyami sighed next to you, his tense shoulders relaxing. </p><p>&ldquo;T-That&rsquo;s good&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>You blinked at him curiously. What did <i>that</i> mean?</p><p>&ldquo;I like you too.&rdquo; </p><p><i>'What?&rsquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;I really like you, (y/n).&rdquo;</p><p>You couldn&rsquo;t help the smile that spread over your face, your tears of embarrassment replaced by tears of happiness. </p><p>&ldquo;(Y/n)?&rdquo; Tokoyami questioned, alarmed, as your shoulders shook. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay if you don&rsquo;t want to go out with me anym-!&rdquo; </p><p>Cutting him off, you turned to fully face your long-time crush and threw your arms around him, hugging him tightly. &ldquo;Of course I still want to go out with you, Tokoyami! I really like you too!&rdquo;</p><p>Wrapping his arms around you, Tokoyami smiled into your hair, both of you finally happy now that Kaminari and Sero&rsquo;s nonsensical misunderstanding had been cleared up. </p><p>&ldquo;Tokoyami and (l/n) sitting in a tree~! K-I-S-S-I-N-G~!&rdquo; </p><p>Speaking of Kaminari and Sero&hellip;</p><p>Didn&rsquo;t they ever know when to quit? For a split second, the idea of eating them flitted across your mind, but only for a moment. Next time they interrupted though&hellip;that was a different story.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>A/N: Writer\u2019s block was strong with this one.^^; I do not own My Hero Academia or any of its characters.

No problem!\u201d Waving your hands in front of you, you hurriedly dismissed his apology, the beginnings of a nervous sweat breaking out on your palms.</p><p><i>'Now\u2019s the perfect opportunity! Confess!\u2019</i></p><p>\u201cSo, um, the thing is-!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTokoyami! I really need your help with something before class starts!\u201d Kaminari barreled into the cool mannered boy, nearly knocking him off his feet. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really important, man! We gotta go now!\u201d Joining Kaminari, Sero grabbed Tokoyami\u2019s arm, both boys dragging their surprised classmate away. </p><p>You stood frozen for a few seconds, mouth hanging open, before a deep, animalistic growl rumbled in your chest. Before it could grow, you swallowed forcefully, pushing down the tiger you could feel just below your skin. Whereas you were surprised before, now you were more annoyed. The first time this happened seemed like a likely coincidence, but a second time? No, Sero and Kaminari were up to something, you just didn\u2019t know what.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhat was that about?\u201d Tokoyami questioned, clearly annoyed.<br></p><p>\u201cUhhhhhh\u2026\u201d Kaminari looked back and forth between the feathered boy and Sero, lacking an excuse.</p><p>\u201cW-Well, you know! We need your help!\u201d Sero tried.</p><p>\u201cWith what?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWith what? Uhh\u2026\u201d It was Sero\u2019s turn to look between Tokoyami and Kaminari, asking for help. Red eyes narrowing, Tokoyami crossed his arms, his annoyance obviously growing.</p><p>\u201cWe-We were saving you, okay?!\u201d Kaminari confessed, breaking under the crow-headed boy\u2019s scrutiny. </p><p>Tokoyami blinked, confused. \u201cSaving me? What are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom (l/n)! She\u2019s trying to eat you!\u201d </p><p>A few silent beats passed before Tokoyami groaned, one hand palming his forehead.</p><p>\u201cBoth of you are complete-.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>That</i> was it? You thought I was trying to <i>eat</i> him?!\u201d a usually timid voice said from around the corner, startling them. Stepping out, you leveled Kaminari and Sero with a glare, tiger eyes blazing. \u201cThat\u2019s so stupid! Why would I be trying to eat him?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a tiger, a cat! And he\u2019s a bird!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re people, not animals! You two are ridiculous!\u201d You could feel the frustrated tears forming in your eyes, but you couldn\u2019t help it, too embarrassed and upset to be shy like usual. Before you could think about it, the truth slipped out of your mouth. \u201cI was trying to confess to him, not eat him!\u201d</p><p>A second too late you realized what you\u2019d done, your hands covering your mouth. Your eyes dropped to the floor, unable to see the stunned faces of the three boys in front of you. Mind racing, you tried to think of what to do in this situation. Run? Don\u2019t run?</p><p>\u201cNo way!\u201d Kaminari and Sero screeched in unison, disbelieving.</p><p>Run. You decided to run.</p><p>Turning on your heel, you fled, tears of mortification beginning to fall down your face. Behind you voices called your name, but you ignored them, human body shifting into that of a Siberian tiger. </p><p><i>'They thought I was going to eat him and now he knows! Tokoyami knows I like him and any chance I had is gone!\u2019</i></p><p>Heart hammering, you clawed your way up a tree blindly, hiding yourself in the dense branches. All you wanted to do at this point was disappear, forget about everything that had happened. You were so deeply ingrained in your thoughts that you didn\u2019t realize you weren\u2019t alone.</p><p>A tentative hand touched your furred shoulder, almost making you fall off your branch in surprise. Spinning around, you took in a winded Tokoyami, his fingers burying into your thick fur in an effort to keep you from running away. </p><p>\u201c(L/n)\u2026(y/n), are you okay? Those two are just idiots, alright? Don\u2019t let them upset you.\u201d </p><p>A few awkward, silent moments passed before you let yourself shift back into human form, Tokoyami\u2019s hand leaving you shoulder uncertainly.</p><p>\u201cWas\u2026\u201d he trailed off, fidgeting a little. \u201cWas what you said true? Were you trying to confess to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026Yes,\u201d you murmured quietly, keeping your eyes turned away. There wasn\u2019t any point in lying now, the had already admitted it earlier. </p><p>\u201cSo\u2026you like me?\u201d Tokoyami almost sounded\u2026nervous? Peaking at him, you saw him shift uncomfortably, his eyes still glued to you with an expression you couldn\u2019t place.</p><p>\u201c\u2026Yes,\u201d you whispered, blushing. Tokoyami sighed next to you, his tense shoulders relaxing. </p><p>\u201cT-That\u2019s good\u2026\u201d </p><p>You blinked at him curiously. What did <i>that</i> mean?</p><p>\u201cI like you too.\u201d </p><p><i>'What?\u2019</i></p><p>\u201cI really like you, (y/n).\u201d</p><p>You couldn\u2019t help the smile that spread over your face, your tears of embarrassment replaced by tears of happiness. </p><p>\u201c(Y/n)?\u201d Tokoyami questioned, alarmed, as your shoulders shook. \u201cIt\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t want to go out with me anym-!\u201d </p><p>Cutting him off, you turned to fully face your long-time crush and threw your arms around him, hugging him tightly. \u201cOf course I still want to go out with you, Tokoyami! I really like you too!\u201d</p><p>Wrapping his arms around you, Tokoyami smiled into your hair, both of you finally happy now that Kaminari and Sero\u2019s nonsensical misunderstanding had been cleared up. </p><p>\u201cTokoyami and (l/n) sitting in a tree~! K-I-S-S-I-N-G~!\u201d </p><p>Speaking of Kaminari and Sero\u2026</p><p>Didn\u2019t they ever know when to quit?

She\u2019s going to eat him!!!\u201d Sero was near tears at this point as he gripped his friend\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cCome on, I have an idea!\u201d Half dragging the other boy, Kaminari ran off towards where you had disappeared in pursuit of Tokoyami, leaving Kirishima to stare after the two, one eyebrow quirked in confusion.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that about? Can\u2019t they tell she has a crush on him?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Gulping, your fists clenched and unclenched nervously, palms sweaty. Today was the day!

You froze, unable to breath, as Tokoyami turned his red eyes on you questioningly.</p><p>As he stared at you, bird-like eyes making your heart beat faster, you almost lost the courage it\u2019d taken you months to summon. Everything you\u2019d practiced was thrown out the window as your mind went blank, an embarrassing blush creeping up your neck and making your face burn.</p><p>\u2018Say something, idiot!\u2019 your mind screamed.</p><p>\u201c(L/n)?\u201d Tokoyami tilted his head to the side, the movement like that of a curious bird.</p><p>Gulping, your mouth opened and closed a few times before you took a deep breath.</p><p>'Just tell him you like him! Simple as that!\u2019</p><p>\u201cToko-!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey! Tokoyami what\u2019s up!\u201d Seeming to appear out of nowhere, Kaminari and Sero wrapped their arms around the feathered boy\u2019s shoulders, all easy laughs and smiles, without a clue as to what they\u2019d just interrupted.</p><p>You blinked, mouth hanging open as the relationship changing words you\u2019d been about to say died on your tongue. As you watched with wide, surprised eyes, Kaminari and Sero pulled Tokoyami away, already talking about something that you couldn\u2019t really make out over the blood rushing in your ears.</p><p>Sighing, you leaned your forehead against a wall, trying to calm your still racing heartbeat. A part of you was relieved by the distraction- what if Tokoyami had rejected you, after all?- but, after devoting so much effort and planning to this one, simple confession, disappointment quickly replaced your momentary relief.</p><p>Sighing again, you pulled your shoulders back and shook your head, shedding the heavy feeling that had entered your heart. You may not have been able to confess this time, but there\u2019d be other opportunities! What mattered most was that you didn\u2019t give up! Heartened, you blinked your tiger-like eyes and continued on your way.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cDude, that was so close!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know! She was totally about to eat him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe barely made it in time!\u201d</p><p>Having successfully \u201csaved\u201d Tokoyami from the clutches of death, Kaminari and Sero slumped against each other, trying to catch their breath.</p><p>\u201cThat was kinda scary actually\u2026\u201d Sero mumbled, shivering a little. \u201cDid you see the glimmer in her eyes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did! It was really scary!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait\u2026do you think she\u2019ll try again?\u201d</p><p>Both boys froze, brains slowly processing the idea, before suddenly springing up, falling over each other in their rush to find Tokoyami and protect him from your savage jaws once more.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOkay, second try!\u201d you mumbled to yourself, fists clenched in determination. Taking a deep breath, you walked up to where Tokoyami stood leaning against a wall, reading, before class started. \u201cYou can do it!\u201d you whispered softly, trying to appear composed despite how fast your heart was pounding. \u201cH-hey, Tokoyami!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?

As you watched with wide, surprised eyes, Kaminari and Sero pulled Tokoyami away, already talking about something that you couldn&rsquo;t really make out over the blood rushing in your ears.</p><p>Sighing, you leaned your forehead against a wall, trying to calm your still racing heartbeat. A part of you was relieved by the distraction- what if Tokoyami had rejected you, after all?- but, after devoting so much effort and planning to this one, simple confession, disappointment quickly replaced your momentary relief.</p><p>Sighing again, you pulled your shoulders back and shook your head, shedding the heavy feeling that had entered your heart. You may not have been able to confess this time, but there&rsquo;d be other opportunities! What mattered most was that you didn&rsquo;t give up! Heartened, you blinked your tiger-like eyes and continued on your way.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Dude, that was so close!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know! She was totally about to eat him!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We barely made it in time!&rdquo;</p><p>Having successfully &ldquo;saved&rdquo; Tokoyami from the clutches of death, Kaminari and Sero slumped against each other, trying to catch their breath.</p><p>&ldquo;That was kinda scary actually&hellip;&rdquo; Sero mumbled, shivering a little. &ldquo;Did you see the glimmer in her eyes?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I did! It was really scary!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait&hellip;do you think she&rsquo;ll try again?&rdquo;</p><p>Both boys froze, brains slowly processing the idea, before suddenly springing up, falling over each other in their rush to find Tokoyami and protect him from your savage jaws once more.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Okay, second try!&rdquo; you mumbled to yourself, fists clenched in determination. Taking a deep breath, you walked up to where Tokoyami stood leaning against a wall, reading, before class started. &ldquo;You can do it!&rdquo; you whispered softly, trying to appear composed despite how fast your heart was pounding. &ldquo;H-hey, Tokoyami!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hmm? Oh, (L/n), good morning. Sorry about what happened earlier.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Huh? Oh! T-That&rsquo;s okay! No problem!&rdquo; Waving your hands in front of you, you hurriedly dismissed his apology, the beginnings of a nervous sweat breaking out on your palms.</p><p><i>'Now&rsquo;s the perfect opportunity! Confess!&rsquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;So, um, the thing is-!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tokoyami! I really need your help with something before class starts!&rdquo; Kaminari barreled into the cool mannered boy, nearly knocking him off his feet. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really important, man! We gotta go now!&rdquo; Joining Kaminari, Sero grabbed Tokoyami&rsquo;s arm, both boys dragging their surprised classmate away. </p><p>You stood frozen for a few seconds, mouth hanging open, before a deep, animalistic growl rumbled in your chest. Before it could grow, you swallowed forcefully, pushing down the tiger you could feel just below your skin. Whereas you were surprised before, now you were more annoyed. The first time this happened seemed like a likely coincidence, but a second time? No, Sero and Kaminari were up to something, you just didn&rsquo;t know what.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;What was that about?&rdquo; Tokoyami questioned, clearly annoyed.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Uhhhhhh&hellip;&rdquo; Kaminari looked back and forth between the feathered boy and Sero, lacking an excuse.</p><p>&ldquo;W-Well, you know! We need your help!&rdquo; Sero tried.</p><p>&ldquo;With what?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;With what? Uhh&hellip;&rdquo; It was Sero&rsquo;s turn to look between Tokoyami and Kaminari, asking for help. Red eyes narrowing, Tokoyami crossed his arms, his annoyance obviously growing.</p><p>&ldquo;We-We were saving you, okay?!&rdquo; Kaminari confessed, breaking under the crow-headed boy&rsquo;s scrutiny. </p><p>Tokoyami blinked, confused. &ldquo;Saving me? What are you talking about?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;From (l/n)! She&rsquo;s trying to eat you!&rdquo; </p><p>A few silent beats passed before Tokoyami groaned, one hand palming his forehead.</p><p>&ldquo;Both of you are complete-.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>That</i> was it? You thought I was trying to <i>eat</i> him?!&rdquo; a usually timid voice said from around the corner, startling them. Stepping out, you leveled Kaminari and Sero with a glare, tiger eyes blazing. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so stupid! Why would I be trying to eat him?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a tiger, a cat! And he&rsquo;s a bird!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re people, not animals! You two are ridiculous!&rdquo; You could feel the frustrated tears forming in your eyes, but you couldn&rsquo;t help it, too embarrassed and upset to be shy like usual. Before you could think about it, the truth slipped out of your mouth. &ldquo;I was trying to confess to him, not eat him!&rdquo;</p><p>A second too late you realized what you&rsquo;d done, your hands covering your mouth. Your eyes dropped to the floor, unable to see the stunned faces of the three boys in front of you. Mind racing, you tried to think of what to do in this situation. Run? Don&rsquo;t run?</p><p>&ldquo;No way!&rdquo; Kaminari and Sero screeched in unison, disbelieving.</p><p>Run. You decided to run.</p><p>Turning on your heel, you fled, tears of mortification beginning to fall down your face. Behind you voices called your name, but you ignored them, human body shifting into that of a Siberian tiger. </p><p><i>'They thought I was going to eat him and now he knows! Tokoyami knows I like him and any chance I had is gone!&rsquo;</i></p><p>Heart hammering, you clawed your way up a tree blindly, hiding yourself in the dense branches. All you wanted to do at this point was disappear, forget about everything that had happened. You were so deeply ingrained in your thoughts that you didn&rsquo;t realize you weren&rsquo;t alone.</p><p>A tentative hand touched your furred shoulder, almost making you fall off your branch in surprise. Spinning around, you took in a winded Tokoyami, his fingers burying into your thick fur in an effort to keep you from running away. </p><p>&ldquo;(L/n)&hellip;(y/n), are you okay? Those two are just idiots, alright? Don&rsquo;t let them upset you.&rdquo; </p><p>A few awkward, silent moments passed before you let yourself shift back into human form, Tokoyami&rsquo;s hand leaving you shoulder uncertainly.</p><p>&ldquo;Was&hellip;&rdquo; he trailed off, fidgeting a little. &ldquo;Was what you said true? Were you trying to confess to me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;Yes,&rdquo; you murmured quietly, keeping your eyes turned away. There wasn&rsquo;t any point in lying now, the had already admitted it earlier. </p><p>&ldquo;So&hellip;you like me?&rdquo; Tokoyami almost sounded&hellip;nervous? Peaking at him, you saw him shift uncomfortably, his eyes still glued to you with an expression you couldn&rsquo;t place.</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;Yes,&rdquo; you whispered, blushing. Tokoyami sighed next to you, his tense shoulders relaxing. </p><p>&ldquo;T-That&rsquo;s good&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>You blinked at him curiously. What did <i>that</i> mean?</p><p>&ldquo;I like you too.&rdquo; </p><p><i>'What?&rsquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;I really like you, (y/n).&rdquo;</p><p>You couldn&rsquo;t help the smile that spread over your face, your tears of embarrassment replaced by tears of happiness. </p><p>&ldquo;(Y/n)?&rdquo; Tokoyami questioned, alarmed, as your shoulders shook. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay if you don&rsquo;t want to go out with me anym-!&rdquo; </p><p>Cutting him off, you turned to fully face your long-time crush and threw your arms around him, hugging him tightly. &ldquo;Of course I still want to go out with you, Tokoyami! I really like you too!&rdquo;</p><p>Wrapping his arms around you, Tokoyami smiled into your hair, both of you finally happy now that Kaminari and Sero&rsquo;s nonsensical misunderstanding had been cleared up. </p><p>&ldquo;Tokoyami and (l/n) sitting in a tree~! K-I-S-S-I-N-G~!&rdquo; </p><p>Speaking of Kaminari and Sero&hellip;</p><p>Didn&rsquo;t they ever know when to quit? For a split second, the idea of eating them flitted across your mind, but only for a moment. Next time they interrupted though&hellip;that was a different story.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>A/N: Writer&rsquo;s block was strong with this one.^^; I do not own My Hero Academia or any of its characters.
