By the time I\u2019m standing out in the courtyard my soldiers are all standing tall and ready whilst staring straight forward. A fourth of my men were standing in front of me. The other soldiers had been stationed by Ser Vadin. They\u2019re all good men and even better soldiers. I had hand picked them before our departure back to the mainland. They\u2019ve been trained in man different areas of combat, though they may not be as obedient and fearless as the Unsullied they still are worth a hundred soldiers each.</p><p>\u201cQueen (Y/N),\u201d I heard a voice come from my right and I look over to see Daenerys\u2019 Hand. If it wasn\u2019t the Hand\u2019s pin over his heart than it was definitely his height that gave away who the man was. </p><p>\u201cI presume you are Tyrion Lannister, Daenerys\u2019 Hand?\u201d I asked with a small nod of my head in his direction.</p><p>\u201cYou presumed correctly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell what is it you\u2019re here for?\u201d I asked him looking back to my men.</p><p>\u201cJust wanted to meet the Dragonslayer Queen in person, is all,\u201d I looked down at the man with a raised brow.</p><p>\u201cWell it is good to meet you in person as well. Though you may be the last person I meet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it seems to be that way,\u201d and just like that Tyrion left.</p><p>\u201cPeculiar fellow,\u201d I heard Robin say from beside me.</p><p>\u201cHe seems too smart to be in the middle of all of this,\u201d I told him in reply as I watched the Hand of the Queen leave.</p><!-- more --><p>I got on to my horse and from the corner of my eye I saw Robin also get on his. I waited for him to come by my side before going forward and out the main gates. As we made our way out I saw Daenerys\u2019 Unsullied and Dothraki army make their way to the battlefield as well. The contrast between the people in her army was quite interesting. The Unsullied moved in complete unison, almost as if they were one entity, whilst the Dothraki ran out on their horses screaming and yelling in their native tongue full of pride and will. Though they were both equally terrifying, no one could argue that. Both were fearless which was admirable. It seems the people of Essos are more fearless, loyal, and brave than the people of Westeros have ever been.</p><p>Getting into position my soldiers stood by some of the wildings and behind to the left of the Dothraki. Whilst I stood in front of them and my head up. </p><p>Everyone stood in front of Winterfell whilst staring at the darkness ahead of us. Everyone was on edge and ready to head head first into battle to protect their homes, people, lives, and rulers. </p><p>Hearing the familiar sound of hooves hitting the snow I looked over to see a woman draped in red while galloping up to one of the Dothraki. She places her hand onto his sword and starts to chant what seems to be a spell, but I am too far away to make out what she is saying. Then all of a sudden all of the Dothraki\u2019s weapons lit on fire. My eyes widened at the sight.</p><p>Though I have heard of magic and I have believed that it had existed once long ago I had not believed that anyone on this time still could possess such powers. I guess I have been proven wrong.</p><p>The Dothraki yelled louder as their horses neighed. Then they charged. Like a stampede of a wild unstable force they ran head first into the darkness before them. Yet, they were not unstoppable. They\u2019re not beasts. They are simply warriors fighting for their queen, and with every light that went out I felt my stomach drop farther and farther into my stomach. Till the last light was gone and my stomach twisted out of fear. </p><p>I\u2019ve never seen one of these \u201cundead\u201d creatures, but if the mere thought can send a man running for the hills then what can the sight of one hurling at you do?</p><p>I saw a few men running back towards us and right after them I saw them. The undead. The creatures I swore to fight without even seeing evidence of their existence. Yet rather than turning back I unsheathed my sword and ordered my men to charge, and with that the battle begun. I slashed at the enemy which were coming from all directions. I stabbed, slashed, kicked, and fought.</p><p>One of the Wights grabbed onto my horse and bit down, hard. My horse neighed and stood up on its hind legs, knocking me off of her. I coughed trying to regain the breath that had been knocked out of me. My eyes widened as one of the wights came out of nowhere jumping on top of me and trying to chomp down on my face. I quickly grabbed my sword and stabbed it and as it went limp I pushed it off. I looked around and whipped my head to the sound of my horse whining at the wights tearing at her flesh. I ran over to her and slashed at the wights, eventually getting them off of her, but the poor creature was on the brink of death. I looked down at the poor horse as it cried out in pain trying to get itself up as its feet moved. I couldn\u2019t leave her and let her suffer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry girl,\u201d I whispered as I pet her head before raising up my sword and stabbing it though her head; killing her instantly.</p><p>I don\u2019t have time to even take a breath before I hear rushing footsteps coming from beside me, making me stab out my sword which in return had the wight collapsing onto the red colored snow floor.</p><p>I fight my way through trying to kill as many of them as I can. Sadly, that was not enough. More of them came and more soldiers were killed. I heard someone yell fallback. I looked around and screamed as well, \u201cFall back!\u201d<br/><br/></p><p>My men did so as they fended off other wights and turned to rush between the Unsullied into Winterfell. I fought off more of the wights and ran through the Unsullied as well. Men were limping and crawling towards the gates. </p><p>I heard Lyanna Mormont yell, \u201cKeep moving back as she ushered the men inside.\u201d I looked behind me and saw the Unsullied protecting the ones retreating. I quickly turned back around and ran to one of the towers and up the stairs onto one of the walls. I looked out upon the battle going on around us. It was terrifying and devastating. Men were coming from all sides pouring in through the gates of Winterfell while the Unsullied stood in clean cut formations protecting the ones who were retreating. Yet, even they couldn\u2019t stop the wights. They were pushing forward inch by inch, body by body. Soon they will be at the gates forcing themselves in.</p><p>I looked around and saw Jamie Lannister and Brienne of Tarth urging the men back into the castle. I glanced back to the men stationed around the walls. Their arrows wouldn\u2019t do anything yet. The wights were too far away for them to get proper shots without killing the Unsullied too.</p><p>As the Unsullied finally moved to close up the gap the retreating men were running through the few last soldiers rushed through the gates. Yet the wights were getting closer and closer, and were not slowing down. Some of the wights broke through and were making their way towards the trenches I quickly picked up a bow and grabbed a handful of arrows I lit one up and aimed. I fired my shot hitting the wight and I kept on firing. </p><p>I saw the Unsullied retreating whilst screaming \u201cRetreat\u201d in High Valyrian. I kept on firing arrows trying to stop the undead from claiming anymore for their army.</p><p>I saw one of the unsullied pull the rope to the bridge across the trenches, and I heard another scream \u201cLight the trenches.\u201d I quickly aimed my bow down towards the sharpened logs lining the trenches and repeatedly fired one arrow after another, each hitting its mark, but it was not enough. I looked above us to try and find Daenerys\u2019 dragons, but I could not see them at all. The dark night mixed with the harsh winds blocked their view of us. They were flying blindly through the storm. I started to fire more arrows at a more rapid pace making my aim become more and more accurate yet all we needed was the logs to catch on fire. To signal to them where we are.</p><p>Only a few Unsullied were left as they guarded one another in front of the entrance of Winterfell which had its gates still wide open. I saw the same women dressed in red walk out and place herself next to a log. I saw her starting to whisper once again, but my concerns grew as I saw no flames emitting and the wights were coming closer. I started aiming my arrows to defend her. Then they the trenches lit aflame all around the castle. </p><p>Through all the shouts and screaming I hear a distinct screech. I look up to see Daenerys\u2019 dragons. They\u2019re absolutely astonishing. I had never seen them before this moment. They were huge cruel looking beasts, yet beautiful as they came swooping down upon the wights below. Spreading fire upon them giving the men left outside of the walls to fall back.</p><p>I looked away from the dragons and down upon the wights below, to my surprise they just stood there. Staring and unmoving from their positions. A bone chilling scene. I aimed and fired my bow once again at the wights who were nearest.</p><p>I stopped shooting and lowered my bow as I saw them moving and laying themselves down upon the trenches. They were killing themselves to make a bridge for the others. I heard Ser Davos scream out, \u201cMan the walls!\u201d</p><p>Seemed as though many of the soldiers were just staring wide eyed at the scene ahead of them.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you men gawking at? Man the goddamn walls!\u201d I ordered at them with a fierce voice as loud as I could to where my throat burned at the strain. I quickly raised up my bow and fired at the enemy that were once again making their way towards us as they rushed past the corpse bridge they had created over the trenches.</p><p>Everyone was rushing and making their way up the walls. All you could hear was the horrible sounds of the wights, the shouts of soldiers, and the sounds of arrows being fired left and right. </p><p>The wights inched closer to the walls and I screamed out, \u201cMind the walls they\u2019re coming up the walls!\u201d At that I started to fire at the wights below us which were crawling and clawing their way on top of m]one another trying to make it up and over the walls. I saw them making up their way at the walls to my left and I quickly grabbed more arrows and ran. I made it seeing Jamie Lannister, Tormund, one of the wildling men Jon is acquainted with, and another man who I have seen forging the weapons getting ready for battle. I quickly place the arrows in their containers and light them and fire them off. The wights slowly make their way up the wall and as the three men are fighting them off I try to shoot each one that gets passed them.</p><p>I reach over for more arrows only to find none left. I quickly grab for my sword and unsheath it as I swing it at a wight which in return slices the undead in half. More soldiers join us at the wall as each and everyone one of us slices at the foe, holding them back as much as we can, but they still end up breaking through. No matter our efforts. </p><p>There\u2019s so many of them crawling over all I can see is wights and men fighting and all I can do is the do the same as everyone around me. Fight till I can\u2019t anymore. I see Samwell Tarly being attacked as he tries to fend it off I quickly run towards him and slash off the ones coming up behind him while the blacksmith from before stabs the one latched on to Tarly\u2019s arm. </p><p>As I kill another coming up behind me my head whipps towards the sound of wood breaking. I see the sight of the wights breaking through the railing and falling onto the courtyard floor. The wights run and impale themselves atop the spiked logs as other wights run either over or around them as they attack the men below. I turn away from the sight and keep fighting off the wights coming over the wall. As en around me were being torn apart, pushed off the wall, and killed I fell back slashing my way to one of the towers and making my way out into the courtyard to join the fight down below.</p><p>I hear large monstrous footsteps nearing and I look over to see a giant. My eyes widen as I look around for a way to kill it. I grab one of the bows discarded on the floor and pick it up and I search for an arrow which I luckily quickly find. I aim it towards the eye of the giant and with an exhale I release the arrow. It hits the giant dead in the eye and it starts making its way towards me. My eyes widen in fear, but then I hear a high pitched scream that in no way could belong to any of the soldiers I look over, as does the giant wight, to the sound and see Lyanna mormont running towards the giant with a weapon raised in her hands. She rush at the giant and straight into its grip as it lifts the girl up effortlessly. My eyes widened as I try to find some sort of way to top the girl from being crushed. I see the poor girl start to cough up blood as the giant pulls her closer and clenches its fists harder around her small frame.</p><p>Before I could do anti thing to help her Lyanna\u2019s stabs the eight in the eye with her dagger. My eyes widen. I would\u2019ve never expected a trained warrior to do such a thing let alone a young girl. </p><p>I run towards the giant as it falls down with Lyanna clutched in its fist. The giant has already fallen by the time I get to it. I drop down next to the girl and smile at her sadly. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve fought well,\u201d I whisper to her. </p><p>I hear a sound coming from behind me and I quickly turn around with my sword once again unsheathed and I stab it into the wight which had been approaching me, and I quickly dart out of the way of the oncoming onslaught of wights barreling through the gates. Swiftly I move \u00a0to get on top of an object and from there make my way up to get to a higher point away from the wights down below.</p><p>I run through the corridors and halls of the castle. Quickly and quietly whilst killing wights silently to not cause too much attention to be drawn to me. For if I do they\u2019ll all come heading in my way and no matter how well I\u2019ve been taught to fight I am no match for a horde of the undead.</p><p>I ran upstairs and around corners trying to find my way back out to one of the walls to see if there were any people in need of help, if there is anyone left that is. The moment I rush out from around a corner I\u2019m met with a wight hurling towards me. I let out a surprised scream as I\u2019m knocked to the ground. I struggle with keeping the wight away from my face as it tries to chomp its teeth near it. I struggle with pushing it away, but then an axe is embedded through its skull making the creature collapse on top of me.</p><p>\u201cCome on dragon slayer, get of your ass,\u201d I hear my supposed savior say as I look up I\u2019m met with the all too familiar fiery red hair of Tormund.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Tormund,\u201d I sigh out taking his hand that he reached out for me as I pull myself up with his help.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mention it, lass. Now come on,\u201d He says as he pulls the axe from the wight\u2019s skull.</p><p>The two of us make it to one of the walls where the blacksmith is also standing atop of, but all of us stop as we look around and see the people slain starting to rise back up with glowing blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d I heard Tormund say as I nod along with his statement. </p><p>The wights start to attack once again and the ones left alive all throw themselves back into battle once more. The bodies started to pile up one by one till we were standing on mounds of them fighting off other wights which would then collapse and add onto the pile of bodies I\u2019m already standing on. </p><p>I make my way through the wights and into the middle of the courtyard to see Jon Snow making his way further into the castle. I somehow get a bad feeling in my gut and I follow him further into Winterfell and fight off any oncoming creatures that jump out at me. I follow him into a tunnel and quickly make my way behind him as I see a wight fall from the ceiling and behind him. I swiftly take care of it and pull him back as another falls from the ceiling. Jon looks over at me in shock.</p><p>\u201cYou can thank me later now lets go!\u201d I urge him pushing him forward to the end of the hall as we fight our way through. He pushes me through and as fast as he can turns around to pull the door closed and shuts it. In return the wights press themselves against the cage like wall and reach through trying to get at us. <br/><br/></p><p>The two of us run out into the courtyard and run towards some wights trying to get at some poor man, but the two of us stop in out tracks as a large screech is heard and the undead dragon lands atop the walls of Winterfell and spits out blue flames at the ones in the courtyard. The two of us automatically turn and run back into the hallway to hide from the flames of the dragon.</p><p>I run through the hallway as Jon follows closely behind me. Making our way back into the courtyard I hide behind a wall from the dragon and pull Jon to my side before the dragon could take notice. </p><p>Not even being able to take a breath before our head whipp over to the sound of wights breaking through the doors in front of us and falling atop one another as they do so. </p><p>I turn my head to Jon, \u201cYou stay here and try not to get killed, I have a plan.\u201d I tell him as I run off towards one of the towers that can lead me up to the wall nearest to the dragon. Before Jon could protest a wight comes up and tries to get at him, but he quickly move out of the way and slices it in half.</p><p>I turn back around and push myself against the door to break through it. My feet rapidly make their way up each step. I run out onto one of the many walls of the castle and look out to see the dragon breathing its fire towards Jon\u2019s location as he tries dogging it. I quickly run to get closer to the half faced beast. I look at Jon and see him make eye contact with me. Giving him a short nod he nods back in reply and runs out and to another cover making the back of the dragon face me. I quickly run forward onto some rubble with my unsheathed sword and hold it above my head as I lead on top of the dragon and stab it down into its back. It cries out and its head reaches towards the sky as it breathes out blue flames once more. It struggles as twists its body trying to throw me off. I pull myself up on its back closer and closer to its head. Stabbing it in the back \u00a0to pull myself closer and holding onto the scales on its back to keep myself from being flung off the dragon every time I pull out my sword.</p><p>Once I get to its neck I stab it hard and the half faced dragon breathes out fire in Jon\u2019s direction as if it were a reflex. I quickly pull myself to its head as it is at a slight stand still when breathing out fire and shove my sword into the top of its head. As I push my sword farther and farther into its skull. I take out my dagger and start yelling out a victory cry as I repeatedly stab its head. Placing all my eight on top of the sword to make it go farther into its skulls as I keep on pulling out my dagger from its head and thrust it back in repeatedly. </p><p>The dragon lets out a large cry as it breathes out a large gust of fire, which I hope Jon has been able to avoid. Right before it goes limp and collapses below me. I hold onto my sword as the beast falls finally. I breath in and out at a rapid breath as I stare wide eyed at where my hands are clutching the sword. I did it. I killed it.</p><p>I sigh out in relief as I lay on top of the dragon. My final bursts of energy leaving me as fatigue took over. I hear a sound and look up and see a wight rushing towards me. My eyes widen and I can hear Jon yelling at me in the background to get up, but I can\u2019t. I\u2019m too tired and too scared to do anything. </p><p>Then the creature out of nowhere falls down. I look around me in confusion and see the other wights collapse one by one. I look over to Jon with a confused face which he returns as well. My face then contorts from confusion to happiness and relief.</p><p>\u201cWe won!\u201d I scream out in victory as I get up. </p><p>I hear other people yell and scream out in victory and relief.</p><p>I looked down on Jon and gave him a bright smile which he returned with his own slight smile.</p><p><b>TAGLIST:</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpeXAbc6f8N73rvpKxXH3CA\">@silver-tigress</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mld3nLUW63f-3F3LpM9H81g\">@youre-a-good-man-theon</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4QKcbOAnXrP6vSTOYH_XwA\">@bee-wrecker</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjxb79IPZGjrizp6l9CLHwg\">@boogiebunnies</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjA-s-BnEr1oEREDb1IsscA\">@precious-bands-love</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSIEa6ytnOYsd8qADIe6Zbw\">@supernaturaltrashy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAiUabVhvNAz2MaXF6yGG6Q\">@immortal-imagination</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkPj0f2ty26pT7fVvwVAqvQ\">@mikariell95</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOfByibyY7u993pmF27UR_Q\">@saoirsewhittle</a> @jinx-is-fire\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mANQNtJRAtP5Fu7ZcruWCvA\">@askblog12</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mskF3SuK8Meuym69rDiTwWQ\">@colors-for-the-world-please</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvpXWDNB2F8OKmVBNGrszZg\">@magical-spit</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNBYZXaBmOngftAlUtwDspg\">@a-sweet-little-fangirl</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAh6a39s2KEY4msop2nNeog\">@letsloveimagines</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJrk1EdTkhsVoCSpHXq5gNg\">@turtlelurky</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7kQrR3yXUNh2djY604wmTw\">@fandomsfanman</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1V-JXiBN1ZN00Jtg0JjjVg\">@frog-face-wolfhard</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTm4t4wWQ6oCiNBOm4lHU5A\">@jordy&mdash;9</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbJfaLddeawsIHrslk_hmVQ\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbJfaLddeawsIHrslk_hmVQ\">@breadisrawtoast</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWkZQ0eW4wG-DyExQkH9bzQ\">@discoball-deaky</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4xQAD9mTw6qbQ2_ZVYsU9g\">@lusyschwa</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkAIjqHnc7dxnIXtNRtOOfw\">@believeinyourdreamsxo</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYxgt7IfdmGjuSBVGdlc8Bg\">@amandasugg09</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxiEV7PdKwqlReS7r15EzVg\">@patdsinner33</a></p>",

By the time I\u2019m standing out in the courtyard my soldiers are all standing tall and ready whilst staring straight forward. A fourth of my men were standing in front of me. The other soldiers had been stationed by Ser Vadin. They\u2019re all good men and even better soldiers. I had hand picked them before our departure back to the mainland. They\u2019ve been trained in man different areas of combat, though they may not be as obedient and fearless as the Unsullied they still are worth a hundred soldiers each.</p><p>\u201cQueen (Y/N),\u201d I heard a voice come from my right and I look over to see Daenerys\u2019 Hand. If it wasn\u2019t the Hand\u2019s pin over his heart than it was definitely his height that gave away who the man was. </p><p>\u201cI presume you are Tyrion Lannister, Daenerys\u2019 Hand?\u201d I asked with a small nod of my head in his direction.</p><p>\u201cYou presumed correctly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell what is it you\u2019re here for?\u201d I asked him looking back to my men.</p><p>\u201cJust wanted to meet the Dragonslayer Queen in person, is all,\u201d I looked down at the man with a raised brow.</p><p>\u201cWell it is good to meet you in person as well.

I waited for him to come by my side before going forward and out the main gates. As we made our way out I saw Daenerys\u2019 Unsullied and Dothraki army make their way to the battlefield as well. The contrast between the people in her army was quite interesting. The Unsullied moved in complete unison, almost as if they were one entity, whilst the Dothraki ran out on their horses screaming and yelling in their native tongue full of pride and will. Though they were both equally terrifying, no one could argue that. Both were fearless which was admirable. It seems the people of Essos are more fearless, loyal, and brave than the people of Westeros have ever been.</p><p>Getting into position my soldiers stood by some of the wildings and behind to the left of the Dothraki. Whilst I stood in front of them and my head up. </p><p>Everyone stood in front of Winterfell whilst staring at the darkness ahead of us. Everyone was on edge and ready to head head first into battle to protect their homes, people, lives, and rulers. </p><p>Hearing the familiar sound of hooves hitting the snow I looked over to see a woman draped in red while galloping up to one of the Dothraki. She places her hand onto his sword and starts to chant what seems to be a spell, but I am too far away to make out what she is saying. Then all of a sudden all of the Dothraki\u2019s weapons lit on fire. My eyes widened at the sight.</p><p>Though I have heard of magic and I have believed that it had existed once long ago I had not believed that anyone on this time still could possess such powers. I guess I have been proven wrong.</p><p>The Dothraki yelled louder as their horses neighed. Then they charged. Like a stampede of a wild unstable force they ran head first into the darkness before them. Yet, they were not unstoppable. They\u2019re not beasts. They are simply warriors fighting for their queen, and with every light that went out I felt my stomach drop farther and farther into my stomach. Till the last light was gone and my stomach twisted out of fear. </p><p>I\u2019ve never seen one of these \u201cundead\u201d creatures, but if the mere thought can send a man running for the hills then what can the sight of one hurling at you do?</p><p>I saw a few men running back towards us and right after them I saw them. The undead. The creatures I swore to fight without even seeing evidence of their existence. Yet rather than turning back I unsheathed my sword and ordered my men to charge, and with that the battle begun. I slashed at the enemy which were coming from all directions. I stabbed, slashed, kicked, and fought.</p><p>One of the Wights grabbed onto my horse and bit down, hard. My horse neighed and stood up on its hind legs, knocking me off of her. I coughed trying to regain the breath that had been knocked out of me. My eyes widened as one of the wights came out of nowhere jumping on top of me and trying to chomp down on my face. I quickly grabbed my sword and stabbed it and as it went limp I pushed it off. I looked around and whipped my head to the sound of my horse whining at the wights tearing at her flesh. I ran over to her and slashed at the wights, eventually getting them off of her, but the poor creature was on the brink of death. I looked down at the poor horse as it cried out in pain trying to get itself up as its feet moved. I couldn\u2019t leave her and let her suffer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry girl,\u201d I whispered as I pet her head before raising up my sword and stabbing it though her head; killing her instantly.</p><p>I don\u2019t have time to even take a breath before I hear rushing footsteps coming from beside me, making me stab out my sword which in return had the wight collapsing onto the red colored snow floor.</p><p>I fight my way through trying to kill as many of them as I can. Sadly, that was not enough. More of them came and more soldiers were killed. I heard someone yell fallback. I looked around and screamed as well, \u201cFall back!\u201d<br><br></p><p>My men did so as they fended off other wights and turned to rush between the Unsullied into Winterfell. I fought off more of the wights and ran through the Unsullied as well. Men were limping and crawling towards the gates. </p><p>I heard Lyanna Mormont yell, \u201cKeep moving back as she ushered the men inside.\u201d I looked behind me and saw the Unsullied protecting the ones retreating. I quickly turned back around and ran to one of the towers and up the stairs onto one of the walls. I looked out upon the battle going on around us. It was terrifying and devastating. Men were coming from all sides pouring in through the gates of Winterfell while the Unsullied stood in clean cut formations protecting the ones who were retreating. Yet, even they couldn\u2019t stop the wights. They were pushing forward inch by inch, body by body. Soon they will be at the gates forcing themselves in.</p><p>I looked around and saw Jamie Lannister and Brienne of Tarth urging the men back into the castle. I glanced back to the men stationed around the walls. Their arrows wouldn\u2019t do anything yet. The wights were too far away for them to get proper shots without killing the Unsullied too.</p><p>As the Unsullied finally moved to close up the gap the retreating men were running through the few last soldiers rushed through the gates. Yet the wights were getting closer and closer, and were not slowing down. Some of the wights broke through and were making their way towards the trenches I quickly picked up a bow and grabbed a handful of arrows I lit one up and aimed. I fired my shot hitting the wight and I kept on firing. </p><p>I saw the Unsullied retreating whilst screaming \u201cRetreat\u201d in High Valyrian. I kept on firing arrows trying to stop the undead from claiming anymore for their army.</p><p>I saw one of the unsullied pull the rope to the bridge across the trenches, and I heard another scream \u201cLight the trenches.\u201d I quickly aimed my bow down towards the sharpened logs lining the trenches and repeatedly fired one arrow after another, each hitting its mark, but it was not enough. I looked above us to try and find Daenerys\u2019 dragons, but I could not see them at all. The dark night mixed with the harsh winds blocked their view of us. They were flying blindly through the storm. I started to fire more arrows at a more rapid pace making my aim become more and more accurate yet all we needed was the logs to catch on fire. To signal to them where we are.</p><p>Only a few Unsullied were left as they guarded one another in front of the entrance of Winterfell which had its gates still wide open. I saw the same women dressed in red walk out and place herself next to a log. I saw her starting to whisper once again, but my concerns grew as I saw no flames emitting and the wights were coming closer. I started aiming my arrows to defend her. Then they the trenches lit aflame all around the castle. </p><p>Through all the shouts and screaming I hear a distinct screech. I look up to see Daenerys\u2019 dragons. They\u2019re absolutely astonishing. I had never seen them before this moment. They were huge cruel looking beasts, yet beautiful as they came swooping down upon the wights below. Spreading fire upon them giving the men left outside of the walls to fall back.</p><p>I looked away from the dragons and down upon the wights below, to my surprise they just stood there. Staring and unmoving from their positions. A bone chilling scene. I aimed and fired my bow once again at the wights who were nearest.</p><p>I stopped shooting and lowered my bow as I saw them moving and laying themselves down upon the trenches. They were killing themselves to make a bridge for the others. I heard Ser Davos scream out, \u201cMan the walls!\u201d</p><p>Seemed as though many of the soldiers were just staring wide eyed at the scene ahead of them.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you men gawking at? Man the goddamn walls!\u201d I ordered at them with a fierce voice as loud as I could to where my throat burned at the strain. I quickly raised up my bow and fired at the enemy that were once again making their way towards us as they rushed past the corpse bridge they had created over the trenches.</p><p>Everyone was rushing and making their way up the walls. All you could hear was the horrible sounds of the wights, the shouts of soldiers, and the sounds of arrows being fired left and right. </p><p>The wights inched closer to the walls and I screamed out, \u201cMind the walls they\u2019re coming up the walls!\u201d At that I started to fire at the wights below us which were crawling and clawing their way on top of m]one another trying to make it up and over the walls. I saw them making up their way at the walls to my left and I quickly grabbed more arrows and ran. I made it seeing Jamie Lannister, Tormund, one of the wildling men Jon is acquainted with, and another man who I have seen forging the weapons getting ready for battle. I quickly place the arrows in their containers and light them and fire them off. The wights slowly make their way up the wall and as the three men are fighting them off I try to shoot each one that gets passed them.</p><p>I reach over for more arrows only to find none left. I quickly grab for my sword and unsheath it as I swing it at a wight which in return slices the undead in half. More soldiers join us at the wall as each and everyone one of us slices at the foe, holding them back as much as we can, but they still end up breaking through. No matter our efforts. </p><p>There\u2019s so many of them crawling over all I can see is wights and men fighting and all I can do is the do the same as everyone around me. Fight till I can\u2019t anymore. I see Samwell Tarly being attacked as he tries to fend it off I quickly run towards him and slash off the ones coming up behind him while the blacksmith from before stabs the one latched on to Tarly\u2019s arm. </p><p>As I kill another coming up behind me my head whipps towards the sound of wood breaking. I see the sight of the wights breaking through the railing and falling onto the courtyard floor. The wights run and impale themselves atop the spiked logs as other wights run either over or around them as they attack the men below. I turn away from the sight and keep fighting off the wights coming over the wall. As en around me were being torn apart, pushed off the wall, and killed I fell back slashing my way to one of the towers and making my way out into the courtyard to join the fight down below.</p><p>I hear large monstrous footsteps nearing and I look over to see a giant. My eyes widen as I look around for a way to kill it. I grab one of the bows discarded on the floor and pick it up and I search for an arrow which I luckily quickly find. I aim it towards the eye of the giant and with an exhale I release the arrow. It hits the giant dead in the eye and it starts making its way towards me. My eyes widen in fear, but then I hear a high pitched scream that in no way could belong to any of the soldiers I look over, as does the giant wight, to the sound and see Lyanna mormont running towards the giant with a weapon raised in her hands. She rush at the giant and straight into its grip as it lifts the girl up effortlessly. My eyes widened as I try to find some sort of way to top the girl from being crushed. I see the poor girl start to cough up blood as the giant pulls her closer and clenches its fists harder around her small frame.</p><p>Before I could do anti thing to help her Lyanna\u2019s stabs the eight in the eye with her dagger. My eyes widen. I would\u2019ve never expected a trained warrior to do such a thing let alone a young girl. </p><p>I run towards the giant as it falls down with Lyanna clutched in its fist. The giant has already fallen by the time I get to it. I drop down next to the girl and smile at her sadly. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve fought well,\u201d I whisper to her. </p><p>I hear a sound coming from behind me and I quickly turn around with my sword once again unsheathed and I stab it into the wight which had been approaching me, and I quickly dart out of the way of the oncoming onslaught of wights barreling through the gates. Swiftly I move \u00a0to get on top of an object and from there make my way up to get to a higher point away from the wights down below.</p><p>I run through the corridors and halls of the castle. Quickly and quietly whilst killing wights silently to not cause too much attention to be drawn to me. For if I do they\u2019ll all come heading in my way and no matter how well I\u2019ve been taught to fight I am no match for a horde of the undead.</p><p>I ran upstairs and around corners trying to find my way back out to one of the walls to see if there were any people in need of help, if there is anyone left that is. The moment I rush out from around a corner I\u2019m met with a wight hurling towards me. I let out a surprised scream as I\u2019m knocked to the ground. I struggle with keeping the wight away from my face as it tries to chomp its teeth near it. I struggle with pushing it away, but then an axe is embedded through its skull making the creature collapse on top of me.</p><p>\u201cCome on dragon slayer, get of your ass,\u201d I hear my supposed savior say as I look up I\u2019m met with the all too familiar fiery red hair of Tormund.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Tormund,\u201d I sigh out taking his hand that he reached out for me as I pull myself up with his help.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mention it, lass. Now come on,\u201d He says as he pulls the axe from the wight\u2019s skull.</p><p>The two of us make it to one of the walls where the blacksmith is also standing atop of, but all of us stop as we look around and see the people slain starting to rise back up with glowing blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d I heard Tormund say as I nod along with his statement. </p><p>The wights start to attack once again and the ones left alive all throw themselves back into battle once more. The bodies started to pile up one by one till we were standing on mounds of them fighting off other wights which would then collapse and add onto the pile of bodies I\u2019m already standing on. </p><p>I make my way through the wights and into the middle of the courtyard to see Jon Snow making his way further into the castle. I somehow get a bad feeling in my gut and I follow him further into Winterfell and fight off any oncoming creatures that jump out at me. I follow him into a tunnel and quickly make my way behind him as I see a wight fall from the ceiling and behind him. I swiftly take care of it and pull him back as another falls from the ceiling. Jon looks over at me in shock.</p><p>\u201cYou can thank me later now lets go!\u201d I urge him pushing him forward to the end of the hall as we fight our way through. He pushes me through and as fast as he can turns around to pull the door closed and shuts it. In return the wights press themselves against the cage like wall and reach through trying to get at us. <br><br></p><p>The two of us run out into the courtyard and run towards some wights trying to get at some poor man, but the two of us stop in out tracks as a large screech is heard and the undead dragon lands atop the walls of Winterfell and spits out blue flames at the ones in the courtyard. The two of us automatically turn and run back into the hallway to hide from the flames of the dragon.</p><p>I run through the hallway as Jon follows closely behind me. Making our way back into the courtyard I hide behind a wall from the dragon and pull Jon to my side before the dragon could take notice. </p><p>Not even being able to take a breath before our head whipp over to the sound of wights breaking through the doors in front of us and falling atop one another as they do so. </p><p>I turn my head to Jon, \u201cYou stay here and try not to get killed, I have a plan.\u201d I tell him as I run off towards one of the towers that can lead me up to the wall nearest to the dragon. Before Jon could protest a wight comes up and tries to get at him, but he quickly move out of the way and slices it in half.</p><p>I turn back around and push myself against the door to break through it. My feet rapidly make their way up each step. I run out onto one of the many walls of the castle and look out to see the dragon breathing its fire towards Jon\u2019s location as he tries dogging it. I quickly run to get closer to the half faced beast. I look at Jon and see him make eye contact with me. Giving him a short nod he nods back in reply and runs out and to another cover making the back of the dragon face me. I quickly run forward onto some rubble with my unsheathed sword and hold it above my head as I lead on top of the dragon and stab it down into its back. It cries out and its head reaches towards the sky as it breathes out blue flames once more. It struggles as twists its body trying to throw me off. I pull myself up on its back closer and closer to its head. Stabbing it in the back \u00a0to pull myself closer and holding onto the scales on its back to keep myself from being flung off the dragon every time I pull out my sword.</p><p>Once I get to its neck I stab it hard and the half faced dragon breathes out fire in Jon\u2019s direction as if it were a reflex. I quickly pull myself to its head as it is at a slight stand still when breathing out fire and shove my sword into the top of its head. As I push my sword farther and farther into its skull. I take out my dagger and start yelling out a victory cry as I repeatedly stab its head. Placing all my eight on top of the sword to make it go farther into its skulls as I keep on pulling out my dagger from its head and thrust it back in repeatedly. </p><p>The dragon lets out a large cry as it breathes out a large gust of fire, which I hope Jon has been able to avoid. Right before it goes limp and collapses below me. I hold onto my sword as the beast falls finally. I breath in and out at a rapid breath as I stare wide eyed at where my hands are clutching the sword. I did it. I killed it.</p><p>I sigh out in relief as I lay on top of the dragon. My final bursts of energy leaving me as fatigue took over. I hear a sound and look up and see a wight rushing towards me. My eyes widen and I can hear Jon yelling at me in the background to get up, but I can\u2019t. I\u2019m too tired and too scared to do anything. </p><p>Then the creature out of nowhere falls down. I look around me in confusion and see the other wights collapse one by one. I look over to Jon with a confused face which he returns as well. My face then contorts from confusion to happiness and relief.</p><p>\u201cWe won!\u201d I scream out in victory as I get up. </p><p>I hear other people yell and scream out in victory and relief.</p><p>I looked down on Jon and gave him a bright smile which he returned with his own slight smile.</p><p><b>TAGLIST:</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpeXAbc6f8N73rvpKxXH3CA\">@silver-tigress</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mld3nLUW63f-3F3LpM9H81g\">@youre-a-good-man-theon</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4QKcbOAnXrP6vSTOYH_XwA\">@bee-wrecker</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjxb79IPZGjrizp6l9CLHwg\">@boogiebunnies</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjA-s-BnEr1oEREDb1IsscA\">@precious-bands-love</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSIEa6ytnOYsd8qADIe6Zbw\">@supernaturaltrashy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAiUabVhvNAz2MaXF6yGG6Q\">@immortal-imagination</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkPj0f2ty26pT7fVvwVAqvQ\">@mikariell95</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOfByibyY7u993pmF27UR_Q\">@saoirsewhittle</a> @jinx-is-fire\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mANQNtJRAtP5Fu7ZcruWCvA\">@askblog12</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mskF3SuK8Meuym69rDiTwWQ\">@colors-for-the-world-please</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvpXWDNB2F8OKmVBNGrszZg\">@magical-spit</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNBYZXaBmOngftAlUtwDspg\">@a-sweet-little-fangirl</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAh6a39s2KEY4msop2nNeog\">@letsloveimagines</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJrk1EdTkhsVoCSpHXq5gNg\">@turtlelurky</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7kQrR3yXUNh2djY604wmTw\">@fandomsfanman</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1V-JXiBN1ZN00Jtg0JjjVg\">@frog-face-wolfhard</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTm4t4wWQ6oCiNBOm4lHU5A\">@jordy\u20149</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbJfaLddeawsIHrslk_hmVQ\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbJfaLddeawsIHrslk_hmVQ\">@breadisrawtoast</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWkZQ0eW4wG-DyExQkH9bzQ\">@discoball-deaky</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4xQAD9mTw6qbQ2_ZVYsU9g\">@lusyschwa</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkAIjqHnc7dxnIXtNRtOOfw\">@believeinyourdreamsxo</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYxgt7IfdmGjuSBVGdlc8Bg\">@amandasugg09</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxiEV7PdKwqlReS7r15EzVg\">@patdsinner33</a></p></p>",

Sorry for the long wait guys but here it is and this is a long chapter too, in docs it was 8 pages long</p><p><b>Gifs aren\u2019t mine.</b></p><p>If you want to be tagged in my taglist send me a message</p><p><i>(Female Reader)</i></p><p><i><br></i></p><p>I walked briskly down the halls of Winterfell and get to my men to make sure they\u2019re ready. By the time I\u2019m standing out in the courtyard my soldiers are all standing tall and ready whilst staring straight forward. A fourth of my men were standing in front of me. The other soldiers had been stationed by Ser Vadin. They\u2019re all good men and even better soldiers. I had hand picked them before our departure back to the mainland. They\u2019ve been trained in man different areas of combat, though they may not be as obedient and fearless as the Unsullied they still are worth a hundred soldiers each.</p><p>\u201cQueen (Y/N),\u201d I heard a voice come from my right and I look over to see Daenerys\u2019 Hand. If it wasn\u2019t the Hand\u2019s pin over his heart than it was definitely his height that gave away who the man was. </p><p>\u201cI presume you are Tyrion Lannister, Daenerys\u2019 Hand?\u201d I asked with a small nod of my head in his direction.</p><p>\u201cYou presumed correctly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell what is it you\u2019re here for?\u201d I asked him looking back to my men.</p><p>\u201cJust wanted to meet the Dragonslayer Queen in person, is all,\u201d I looked down at the man with a raised brow.</p><p>\u201cWell it is good to meet you in person as well. Though you may be the last person I meet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it seems to be that way,\u201d and just like that Tyrion left.</p><p>\u201cPeculiar fellow,\u201d I heard Robin say from beside me.</p><p>\u201cHe seems too smart to be in the middle of all of this,\u201d I told him in reply as I watched the Hand of the Queen leave.</p>[[MORE]]<p>I got on to my horse and from the corner of my eye I saw Robin also get on his. I waited for him to come by my side before going forward and out the main gates. As we made our way out I saw Daenerys\u2019 Unsullied and Dothraki army make their way to the battlefield as well. The contrast between the people in her army was quite interesting. The Unsullied moved in complete unison, almost as if they were one entity, whilst the Dothraki ran out on their horses screaming and yelling in their native tongue full of pride and will. Though they were both equally terrifying, no one could argue that. Both were fearless which was admirable. It seems the people of Essos are more fearless, loyal, and brave than the people of Westeros have ever been.</p><p>Getting into position my soldiers stood by some of the wildings and behind to the left of the Dothraki. Whilst I stood in front of them and my head up. </p><p>Everyone stood in front of Winterfell whilst staring at the darkness ahead of us. Everyone was on edge and ready to head head first into battle to protect their homes, people, lives, and rulers. </p><p>Hearing the familiar sound of hooves hitting the snow I looked over to see a woman draped in red while galloping up to one of the Dothraki. She places her hand onto his sword and starts to chant what seems to be a spell, but I am too far away to make out what she is saying. Then all of a sudden all of the Dothraki\u2019s weapons lit on fire. My eyes widened at the sight.</p><p>Though I have heard of magic and I have believed that it had existed once long ago I had not believed that anyone on this time still could possess such powers. I guess I have been proven wrong.</p><p>The Dothraki yelled louder as their horses neighed. Then they charged. Like a stampede of a wild unstable force they ran head first into the darkness before them. Yet, they were not unstoppable. They\u2019re not beasts. They are simply warriors fighting for their queen, and with every light that went out I felt my stomach drop farther and farther into my stomach. Till the last light was gone and my stomach twisted out of fear. </p><p>I\u2019ve never seen one of these \u201cundead\u201d creatures, but if the mere thought can send a man running for the hills then what can the sight of one hurling at you do?</p><p>I saw a few men running back towards us and right after them I saw them. The undead. The creatures I swore to fight without even seeing evidence of their existence. Yet rather than turning back I unsheathed my sword and ordered my men to charge, and with that the battle begun. I slashed at the enemy which were coming from all directions. I stabbed, slashed, kicked, and fought.</p><p>One of the Wights grabbed onto my horse and bit down, hard. My horse neighed and stood up on its hind legs, knocking me off of her. I coughed trying to regain the breath that had been knocked out of me. My eyes widened as one of the wights came out of nowhere jumping on top of me and trying to chomp down on my face. I quickly grabbed my sword and stabbed it and as it went limp I pushed it off. I looked around and whipped my head to the sound of my horse whining at the wights tearing at her flesh. I ran over to her and slashed at the wights, eventually getting them off of her, but the poor creature was on the brink of death. I looked down at the poor horse as it cried out in pain trying to get itself up as its feet moved. I couldn\u2019t leave her and let her suffer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry girl,\u201d I whispered as I pet her head before raising up my sword and stabbing it though her head; killing her instantly.</p><p>I don\u2019t have time to even take a breath before I hear rushing footsteps coming from beside me, making me stab out my sword which in return had the wight collapsing onto the red colored snow floor.</p><p>I fight my way through trying to kill as many of them as I can. Sadly, that was not enough. More of them came and more soldiers were killed. I heard someone yell fallback. I looked around and screamed as well, \u201cFall back!\u201d<br><br></p><p>My men did so as they fended off other wights and turned to rush between the Unsullied into Winterfell. I fought off more of the wights and ran through the Unsullied as well. Men were limping and crawling towards the gates. </p><p>I heard Lyanna Mormont yell, \u201cKeep moving back as she ushered the men inside.\u201d I looked behind me and saw the Unsullied protecting the ones retreating. I quickly turned back around and ran to one of the towers and up the stairs onto one of the walls. I looked out upon the battle going on around us. It was terrifying and devastating. Men were coming from all sides pouring in through the gates of Winterfell while the Unsullied stood in clean cut formations protecting the ones who were retreating. Yet, even they couldn\u2019t stop the wights. They were pushing forward inch by inch, body by body. Soon they will be at the gates forcing themselves in.</p><p>I looked around and saw Jamie Lannister and Brienne of Tarth urging the men back into the castle. I glanced back to the men stationed around the walls. Their arrows wouldn\u2019t do anything yet. The wights were too far away for them to get proper shots without killing the Unsullied too.</p><p>As the Unsullied finally moved to close up the gap the retreating men were running through the few last soldiers rushed through the gates. Yet the wights were getting closer and closer, and were not slowing down. Some of the wights broke through and were making their way towards the trenches I quickly picked up a bow and grabbed a handful of arrows I lit one up and aimed. I fired my shot hitting the wight and I kept on firing. </p><p>I saw the Unsullied retreating whilst screaming \u201cRetreat\u201d in High Valyrian. I kept on firing arrows trying to stop the undead from claiming anymore for their army.</p><p>I saw one of the unsullied pull the rope to the bridge across the trenches, and I heard another scream \u201cLight the trenches.\u201d I quickly aimed my bow down towards the sharpened logs lining the trenches and repeatedly fired one arrow after another, each hitting its mark, but it was not enough. I looked above us to try and find Daenerys\u2019 dragons, but I could not see them at all. The dark night mixed with the harsh winds blocked their view of us. They were flying blindly through the storm. I started to fire more arrows at a more rapid pace making my aim become more and more accurate yet all we needed was the logs to catch on fire. To signal to them where we are.</p><p>Only a few Unsullied were left as they guarded one another in front of the entrance of Winterfell which had its gates still wide open. I saw the same women dressed in red walk out and place herself next to a log. I saw her starting to whisper once again, but my concerns grew as I saw no flames emitting and the wights were coming closer. I started aiming my arrows to defend her. Then they the trenches lit aflame all around the castle. </p><p>Through all the shouts and screaming I hear a distinct screech. I look up to see Daenerys\u2019 dragons. They\u2019re absolutely astonishing. I had never seen them before this moment. They were huge cruel looking beasts, yet beautiful as they came swooping down upon the wights below. Spreading fire upon them giving the men left outside of the walls to fall back.</p><p>I looked away from the dragons and down upon the wights below, to my surprise they just stood there. Staring and unmoving from their positions. A bone chilling scene. I aimed and fired my bow once again at the wights who were nearest.</p><p>I stopped shooting and lowered my bow as I saw them moving and laying themselves down upon the trenches. They were killing themselves to make a bridge for the others. I heard Ser Davos scream out, \u201cMan the walls!\u201d</p><p>Seemed as though many of the soldiers were just staring wide eyed at the scene ahead of them.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you men gawking at? Man the goddamn walls!\u201d I ordered at them with a fierce voice as loud as I could to where my throat burned at the strain. I quickly raised up my bow and fired at the enemy that were once again making their way towards us as they rushed past the corpse bridge they had created over the trenches.</p><p>Everyone was rushing and making their way up the walls. All you could hear was the horrible sounds of the wights, the shouts of soldiers, and the sounds of arrows being fired left and right. </p><p>The wights inched closer to the walls and I screamed out, \u201cMind the walls they\u2019re coming up the walls!\u201d At that I started to fire at the wights below us which were crawling and clawing their way on top of m]one another trying to make it up and over the walls. I saw them making up their way at the walls to my left and I quickly grabbed more arrows and ran. I made it seeing Jamie Lannister, Tormund, one of the wildling men Jon is acquainted with, and another man who I have seen forging the weapons getting ready for battle. I quickly place the arrows in their containers and light them and fire them off. The wights slowly make their way up the wall and as the three men are fighting them off I try to shoot each one that gets passed them.</p><p>I reach over for more arrows only to find none left. I quickly grab for my sword and unsheath it as I swing it at a wight which in return slices the undead in half. More soldiers join us at the wall as each and everyone one of us slices at the foe, holding them back as much as we can, but they still end up breaking through. No matter our efforts. </p><p>There\u2019s so many of them crawling over all I can see is wights and men fighting and all I can do is the do the same as everyone around me. Fight till I can\u2019t anymore. I see Samwell Tarly being attacked as he tries to fend it off I quickly run towards him and slash off the ones coming up behind him while the blacksmith from before stabs the one latched on to Tarly\u2019s arm. </p><p>As I kill another coming up behind me my head whipps towards the sound of wood breaking. I see the sight of the wights breaking through the railing and falling onto the courtyard floor. The wights run and impale themselves atop the spiked logs as other wights run either over or around them as they attack the men below. I turn away from the sight and keep fighting off the wights coming over the wall. As en around me were being torn apart, pushed off the wall, and killed I fell back slashing my way to one of the towers and making my way out into the courtyard to join the fight down below.</p><p>I hear large monstrous footsteps nearing and I look over to see a giant. My eyes widen as I look around for a way to kill it. I grab one of the bows discarded on the floor and pick it up and I search for an arrow which I luckily quickly find. I aim it towards the eye of the giant and with an exhale I release the arrow. It hits the giant dead in the eye and it starts making its way towards me. My eyes widen in fear, but then I hear a high pitched scream that in no way could belong to any of the soldiers I look over, as does the giant wight, to the sound and see Lyanna mormont running towards the giant with a weapon raised in her hands. She rush at the giant and straight into its grip as it lifts the girl up effortlessly. My eyes widened as I try to find some sort of way to top the girl from being crushed. I see the poor girl start to cough up blood as the giant pulls her closer and clenches its fists harder around her small frame.</p><p>Before I could do anti thing to help her Lyanna\u2019s stabs the eight in the eye with her dagger. My eyes widen. I would\u2019ve never expected a trained warrior to do such a thing let alone a young girl. </p><p>I run towards the giant as it falls down with Lyanna clutched in its fist. The giant has already fallen by the time I get to it. I drop down next to the girl and smile at her sadly. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve fought well,\u201d I whisper to her. </p><p>I hear a sound coming from behind me and I quickly turn around with my sword once again unsheathed and I stab it into the wight which had been approaching me, and I quickly dart out of the way of the oncoming onslaught of wights barreling through the gates. Swiftly I move \u00a0to get on top of an object and from there make my way up to get to a higher point away from the wights down below.</p><p>I run through the corridors and halls of the castle. Quickly and quietly whilst killing wights silently to not cause too much attention to be drawn to me. For if I do they\u2019ll all come heading in my way and no matter how well I\u2019ve been taught to fight I am no match for a horde of the undead.</p><p>I ran upstairs and around corners trying to find my way back out to one of the walls to see if there were any people in need of help, if there is anyone left that is. The moment I rush out from around a corner I\u2019m met with a wight hurling towards me. I let out a surprised scream as I\u2019m knocked to the ground. I struggle with keeping the wight away from my face as it tries to chomp its teeth near it. I struggle with pushing it away, but then an axe is embedded through its skull making the creature collapse on top of me.</p><p>\u201cCome on dragon slayer, get of your ass,\u201d I hear my supposed savior say as I look up I\u2019m met with the all too familiar fiery red hair of Tormund.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Tormund,\u201d I sigh out taking his hand that he reached out for me as I pull myself up with his help.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mention it, lass. Now come on,\u201d He says as he pulls the axe from the wight\u2019s skull.</p><p>The two of us make it to one of the walls where the blacksmith is also standing atop of, but all of us stop as we look around and see the people slain starting to rise back up with glowing blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d I heard Tormund say as I nod along with his statement. </p><p>The wights start to attack once again and the ones left alive all throw themselves back into battle once more. The bodies started to pile up one by one till we were standing on mounds of them fighting off other wights which would then collapse and add onto the pile of bodies I\u2019m already standing on. </p><p>I make my way through the wights and into the middle of the courtyard to see Jon Snow making his way further into the castle. I somehow get a bad feeling in my gut and I follow him further into Winterfell and fight off any oncoming creatures that jump out at me. I follow him into a tunnel and quickly make my way behind him as I see a wight fall from the ceiling and behind him. I swiftly take care of it and pull him back as another falls from the ceiling. Jon looks over at me in shock.</p><p>\u201cYou can thank me later now lets go!\u201d I urge him pushing him forward to the end of the hall as we fight our way through. He pushes me through and as fast as he can turns around to pull the door closed and shuts it. In return the wights press themselves against the cage like wall and reach through trying to get at us. <br><br></p><p>The two of us run out into the courtyard and run towards some wights trying to get at some poor man, but the two of us stop in out tracks as a large screech is heard and the undead dragon lands atop the walls of Winterfell and spits out blue flames at the ones in the courtyard. The two of us automatically turn and run back into the hallway to hide from the flames of the dragon.</p><p>I run through the hallway as Jon follows closely behind me. Making our way back into the courtyard I hide behind a wall from the dragon and pull Jon to my side before the dragon could take notice. </p><p>Not even being able to take a breath before our head whipp over to the sound of wights breaking through the doors in front of us and falling atop one another as they do so. </p><p>I turn my head to Jon, \u201cYou stay here and try not to get killed, I have a plan.\u201d I tell him as I run off towards one of the towers that can lead me up to the wall nearest to the dragon. Before Jon could protest a wight comes up and tries to get at him, but he quickly move out of the way and slices it in half.</p><p>I turn back around and push myself against the door to break through it. My feet rapidly make their way up each step. I run out onto one of the many walls of the castle and look out to see the dragon breathing its fire towards Jon\u2019s location as he tries dogging it. I quickly run to get closer to the half faced beast. I look at Jon and see him make eye contact with me. Giving him a short nod he nods back in reply and runs out and to another cover making the back of the dragon face me. I quickly run forward onto some rubble with my unsheathed sword and hold it above my head as I lead on top of the dragon and stab it down into its back. It cries out and its head reaches towards the sky as it breathes out blue flames once more. It struggles as twists its body trying to throw me off. I pull myself up on its back closer and closer to its head. Stabbing it in the back \u00a0to pull myself closer and holding onto the scales on its back to keep myself from being flung off the dragon every time I pull out my sword.</p><p>Once I get to its neck I stab it hard and the half faced dragon breathes out fire in Jon\u2019s direction as if it were a reflex. I quickly pull myself to its head as it is at a slight stand still when breathing out fire and shove my sword into the top of its head. As I push my sword farther and farther into its skull. I take out my dagger and start yelling out a victory cry as I repeatedly stab its head. Placing all my eight on top of the sword to make it go farther into its skulls as I keep on pulling out my dagger from its head and thrust it back in repeatedly. </p><p>The dragon lets out a large cry as it breathes out a large gust of fire, which I hope Jon has been able to avoid. Right before it goes limp and collapses below me. I hold onto my sword as the beast falls finally. I breath in and out at a rapid breath as I stare wide eyed at where my hands are clutching the sword. I did it. I killed it.</p><p>I sigh out in relief as I lay on top of the dragon. My final bursts of energy leaving me as fatigue took over. I hear a sound and look up and see a wight rushing towards me. My eyes widen and I can hear Jon yelling at me in the background to get up, but I can\u2019t. I\u2019m too tired and too scared to do anything. </p><p>Then the creature out of nowhere falls down. I look around me in confusion and see the other wights collapse one by one. I look over to Jon with a confused face which he returns as well.

By the time I&rsquo;m standing out in the courtyard my soldiers are all standing tall and ready whilst staring straight forward. A fourth of my men were standing in front of me. The other soldiers had been stationed by Ser Vadin. They&rsquo;re all good men and even better soldiers. I had hand picked them before our departure back to the mainland. They&rsquo;ve been trained in man different areas of combat, though they may not be as obedient and fearless as the Unsullied they still are worth a hundred soldiers each.</p><p>&ldquo;Queen (Y/N),&rdquo; I heard a voice come from my right and I look over to see Daenerys&rsquo; Hand. If it wasn&rsquo;t the Hand&rsquo;s pin over his heart than it was definitely his height that gave away who the man was. </p><p>&ldquo;I presume you are Tyrion Lannister, Daenerys&rsquo; Hand?&rdquo; I asked with a small nod of my head in his direction.</p><p>&ldquo;You presumed correctly.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well what is it you&rsquo;re here for?&rdquo; I asked him looking back to my men.</p><p>&ldquo;Just wanted to meet the Dragonslayer Queen in person, is all,&rdquo; I looked down at the man with a raised brow.</p><p>&ldquo;Well it is good to meet you in person as well. Though you may be the last person I meet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So it seems to be that way,&rdquo; and just like that Tyrion left.</p><p>&ldquo;Peculiar fellow,&rdquo; I heard Robin say from beside me.</p><p>&ldquo;He seems too smart to be in the middle of all of this,&rdquo; I told him in reply as I watched the Hand of the Queen leave.</p><p>I got on to my horse and from the corner of my eye I saw Robin also get on his. I waited for him to come by my side before going forward and out the main gates. As we made our way out I saw Daenerys&rsquo; Unsullied and Dothraki army make their way to the battlefield as well. The contrast between the people in her army was quite interesting. The Unsullied moved in complete unison, almost as if they were one entity, whilst the Dothraki ran out on their horses screaming and yelling in their native tongue full of pride and will. Though they were both equally terrifying, no one could argue that. Both were fearless which was admirable. It seems the people of Essos are more fearless, loyal, and brave than the people of Westeros have ever been.</p><p>Getting into position my soldiers stood by some of the wildings and behind to the left of the Dothraki. Whilst I stood in front of them and my head up. </p><p>Everyone stood in front of Winterfell whilst staring at the darkness ahead of us. Everyone was on edge and ready to head head first into battle to protect their homes, people, lives, and rulers. </p><p>Hearing the familiar sound of hooves hitting the snow I looked over to see a woman draped in red while galloping up to one of the Dothraki. She places her hand onto his sword and starts to chant what seems to be a spell, but I am too far away to make out what she is saying. Then all of a sudden all of the Dothraki&rsquo;s weapons lit on fire. My eyes widened at the sight.</p><p>Though I have heard of magic and I have believed that it had existed once long ago I had not believed that anyone on this time still could possess such powers. I guess I have been proven wrong.</p><p>The Dothraki yelled louder as their horses neighed. Then they charged. Like a stampede of a wild unstable force they ran head first into the darkness before them. Yet, they were not unstoppable. They&rsquo;re not beasts. They are simply warriors fighting for their queen, and with every light that went out I felt my stomach drop farther and farther into my stomach. Till the last light was gone and my stomach twisted out of fear. </p><p>I&rsquo;ve never seen one of these &ldquo;undead&rdquo; creatures, but if the mere thought can send a man running for the hills then what can the sight of one hurling at you do?</p><p>I saw a few men running back towards us and right after them I saw them. The undead. The creatures I swore to fight without even seeing evidence of their existence. Yet rather than turning back I unsheathed my sword and ordered my men to charge, and with that the battle begun. I slashed at the enemy which were coming from all directions. I stabbed, slashed, kicked, and fought.</p><p>One of the Wights grabbed onto my horse and bit down, hard. My horse neighed and stood up on its hind legs, knocking me off of her. I coughed trying to regain the breath that had been knocked out of me. My eyes widened as one of the wights came out of nowhere jumping on top of me and trying to chomp down on my face. I quickly grabbed my sword and stabbed it and as it went limp I pushed it off. I looked around and whipped my head to the sound of my horse whining at the wights tearing at her flesh. I ran over to her and slashed at the wights, eventually getting them off of her, but the poor creature was on the brink of death. I looked down at the poor horse as it cried out in pain trying to get itself up as its feet moved. I couldn&rsquo;t leave her and let her suffer.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry girl,&rdquo; I whispered as I pet her head before raising up my sword and stabbing it though her head; killing her instantly.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t have time to even take a breath before I hear rushing footsteps coming from beside me, making me stab out my sword which in return had the wight collapsing onto the red colored snow floor.</p><p>I fight my way through trying to kill as many of them as I can. Sadly, that was not enough. More of them came and more soldiers were killed. I heard someone yell fallback. I looked around and screamed as well, &ldquo;Fall back!&rdquo;<br /><br /></p><p>My men did so as they fended off other wights and turned to rush between the Unsullied into Winterfell. I fought off more of the wights and ran through the Unsullied as well. Men were limping and crawling towards the gates. </p><p>I heard Lyanna Mormont yell, &ldquo;Keep moving back as she ushered the men inside.&rdquo; I looked behind me and saw the Unsullied protecting the ones retreating. I quickly turned back around and ran to one of the towers and up the stairs onto one of the walls. I looked out upon the battle going on around us. It was terrifying and devastating. Men were coming from all sides pouring in through the gates of Winterfell while the Unsullied stood in clean cut formations protecting the ones who were retreating. Yet, even they couldn&rsquo;t stop the wights. They were pushing forward inch by inch, body by body. Soon they will be at the gates forcing themselves in.</p><p>I looked around and saw Jamie Lannister and Brienne of Tarth urging the men back into the castle. I glanced back to the men stationed around the walls. Their arrows wouldn&rsquo;t do anything yet. The wights were too far away for them to get proper shots without killing the Unsullied too.</p><p>As the Unsullied finally moved to close up the gap the retreating men were running through the few last soldiers rushed through the gates. Yet the wights were getting closer and closer, and were not slowing down. Some of the wights broke through and were making their way towards the trenches I quickly picked up a bow and grabbed a handful of arrows I lit one up and aimed. I fired my shot hitting the wight and I kept on firing. </p><p>I saw the Unsullied retreating whilst screaming &ldquo;Retreat&rdquo; in High Valyrian. I kept on firing arrows trying to stop the undead from claiming anymore for their army.</p><p>I saw one of the unsullied pull the rope to the bridge across the trenches, and I heard another scream &ldquo;Light the trenches.&rdquo; I quickly aimed my bow down towards the sharpened logs lining the trenches and repeatedly fired one arrow after another, each hitting its mark, but it was not enough. I looked above us to try and find Daenerys&rsquo; dragons, but I could not see them at all. The dark night mixed with the harsh winds blocked their view of us. They were flying blindly through the storm. I started to fire more arrows at a more rapid pace making my aim become more and more accurate yet all we needed was the logs to catch on fire. To signal to them where we are.</p><p>Only a few Unsullied were left as they guarded one another in front of the entrance of Winterfell which had its gates still wide open. I saw the same women dressed in red walk out and place herself next to a log. I saw her starting to whisper once again, but my concerns grew as I saw no flames emitting and the wights were coming closer. I started aiming my arrows to defend her. Then they the trenches lit aflame all around the castle. </p><p>Through all the shouts and screaming I hear a distinct screech. I look up to see Daenerys&rsquo; dragons. They&rsquo;re absolutely astonishing. I had never seen them before this moment. They were huge cruel looking beasts, yet beautiful as they came swooping down upon the wights below. Spreading fire upon them giving the men left outside of the walls to fall back.</p><p>I looked away from the dragons and down upon the wights below, to my surprise they just stood there. Staring and unmoving from their positions. A bone chilling scene. I aimed and fired my bow once again at the wights who were nearest.</p><p>I stopped shooting and lowered my bow as I saw them moving and laying themselves down upon the trenches. They were killing themselves to make a bridge for the others. I heard Ser Davos scream out, &ldquo;Man the walls!&rdquo;</p><p>Seemed as though many of the soldiers were just staring wide eyed at the scene ahead of them.</p><p>&ldquo;What the fuck are you men gawking at? Man the goddamn walls!&rdquo; I ordered at them with a fierce voice as loud as I could to where my throat burned at the strain. I quickly raised up my bow and fired at the enemy that were once again making their way towards us as they rushed past the corpse bridge they had created over the trenches.</p><p>Everyone was rushing and making their way up the walls. All you could hear was the horrible sounds of the wights, the shouts of soldiers, and the sounds of arrows being fired left and right. </p><p>The wights inched closer to the walls and I screamed out, &ldquo;Mind the walls they&rsquo;re coming up the walls!&rdquo; At that I started to fire at the wights below us which were crawling and clawing their way on top of m]one another trying to make it up and over the walls. I saw them making up their way at the walls to my left and I quickly grabbed more arrows and ran. I made it seeing Jamie Lannister, Tormund, one of the wildling men Jon is acquainted with, and another man who I have seen forging the weapons getting ready for battle. I quickly place the arrows in their containers and light them and fire them off. The wights slowly make their way up the wall and as the three men are fighting them off I try to shoot each one that gets passed them.</p><p>I reach over for more arrows only to find none left. I quickly grab for my sword and unsheath it as I swing it at a wight which in return slices the undead in half. More soldiers join us at the wall as each and everyone one of us slices at the foe, holding them back as much as we can, but they still end up breaking through. No matter our efforts. </p><p>There&rsquo;s so many of them crawling over all I can see is wights and men fighting and all I can do is the do the same as everyone around me. Fight till I can&rsquo;t anymore. I see Samwell Tarly being attacked as he tries to fend it off I quickly run towards him and slash off the ones coming up behind him while the blacksmith from before stabs the one latched on to Tarly&rsquo;s arm. </p><p>As I kill another coming up behind me my head whipps towards the sound of wood breaking. I see the sight of the wights breaking through the railing and falling onto the courtyard floor. The wights run and impale themselves atop the spiked logs as other wights run either over or around them as they attack the men below. I turn away from the sight and keep fighting off the wights coming over the wall. As en around me were being torn apart, pushed off the wall, and killed I fell back slashing my way to one of the towers and making my way out into the courtyard to join the fight down below.</p><p>I hear large monstrous footsteps nearing and I look over to see a giant. My eyes widen as I look around for a way to kill it. I grab one of the bows discarded on the floor and pick it up and I search for an arrow which I luckily quickly find. I aim it towards the eye of the giant and with an exhale I release the arrow. It hits the giant dead in the eye and it starts making its way towards me. My eyes widen in fear, but then I hear a high pitched scream that in no way could belong to any of the soldiers I look over, as does the giant wight, to the sound and see Lyanna mormont running towards the giant with a weapon raised in her hands. She rush at the giant and straight into its grip as it lifts the girl up effortlessly. My eyes widened as I try to find some sort of way to top the girl from being crushed. I see the poor girl start to cough up blood as the giant pulls her closer and clenches its fists harder around her small frame.</p><p>Before I could do anti thing to help her Lyanna&rsquo;s stabs the eight in the eye with her dagger. My eyes widen. I would&rsquo;ve never expected a trained warrior to do such a thing let alone a young girl. </p><p>I run towards the giant as it falls down with Lyanna clutched in its fist. The giant has already fallen by the time I get to it. I drop down next to the girl and smile at her sadly. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve fought well,&rdquo; I whisper to her. </p><p>I hear a sound coming from behind me and I quickly turn around with my sword once again unsheathed and I stab it into the wight which had been approaching me, and I quickly dart out of the way of the oncoming onslaught of wights barreling through the gates. Swiftly I move &nbsp;to get on top of an object and from there make my way up to get to a higher point away from the wights down below.</p><p>I run through the corridors and halls of the castle. Quickly and quietly whilst killing wights silently to not cause too much attention to be drawn to me. For if I do they&rsquo;ll all come heading in my way and no matter how well I&rsquo;ve been taught to fight I am no match for a horde of the undead.</p><p>I ran upstairs and around corners trying to find my way back out to one of the walls to see if there were any people in need of help, if there is anyone left that is. The moment I rush out from around a corner I&rsquo;m met with a wight hurling towards me. I let out a surprised scream as I&rsquo;m knocked to the ground. I struggle with keeping the wight away from my face as it tries to chomp its teeth near it. I struggle with pushing it away, but then an axe is embedded through its skull making the creature collapse on top of me.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on dragon slayer, get of your ass,&rdquo; I hear my supposed savior say as I look up I&rsquo;m met with the all too familiar fiery red hair of Tormund.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Tormund,&rdquo; I sigh out taking his hand that he reached out for me as I pull myself up with his help.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it, lass. Now come on,&rdquo; He says as he pulls the axe from the wight&rsquo;s skull.</p><p>The two of us make it to one of the walls where the blacksmith is also standing atop of, but all of us stop as we look around and see the people slain starting to rise back up with glowing blue eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Shit,&rdquo; I heard Tormund say as I nod along with his statement. </p><p>The wights start to attack once again and the ones left alive all throw themselves back into battle once more. The bodies started to pile up one by one till we were standing on mounds of them fighting off other wights which would then collapse and add onto the pile of bodies I&rsquo;m already standing on. </p><p>I make my way through the wights and into the middle of the courtyard to see Jon Snow making his way further into the castle. I somehow get a bad feeling in my gut and I follow him further into Winterfell and fight off any oncoming creatures that jump out at me. I follow him into a tunnel and quickly make my way behind him as I see a wight fall from the ceiling and behind him. I swiftly take care of it and pull him back as another falls from the ceiling. Jon looks over at me in shock.</p><p>&ldquo;You can thank me later now lets go!&rdquo; I urge him pushing him forward to the end of the hall as we fight our way through. He pushes me through and as fast as he can turns around to pull the door closed and shuts it. In return the wights press themselves against the cage like wall and reach through trying to get at us. <br /><br /></p><p>The two of us run out into the courtyard and run towards some wights trying to get at some poor man, but the two of us stop in out tracks as a large screech is heard and the undead dragon lands atop the walls of Winterfell and spits out blue flames at the ones in the courtyard. The two of us automatically turn and run back into the hallway to hide from the flames of the dragon.</p><p>I run through the hallway as Jon follows closely behind me. Making our way back into the courtyard I hide behind a wall from the dragon and pull Jon to my side before the dragon could take notice. </p><p>Not even being able to take a breath before our head whipp over to the sound of wights breaking through the doors in front of us and falling atop one another as they do so. </p><p>I turn my head to Jon, &ldquo;You stay here and try not to get killed, I have a plan.&rdquo; I tell him as I run off towards one of the towers that can lead me up to the wall nearest to the dragon. Before Jon could protest a wight comes up and tries to get at him, but he quickly move out of the way and slices it in half.</p><p>I turn back around and push myself against the door to break through it. My feet rapidly make their way up each step. I run out onto one of the many walls of the castle and look out to see the dragon breathing its fire towards Jon&rsquo;s location as he tries dogging it. I quickly run to get closer to the half faced beast. I look at Jon and see him make eye contact with me. Giving him a short nod he nods back in reply and runs out and to another cover making the back of the dragon face me. I quickly run forward onto some rubble with my unsheathed sword and hold it above my head as I lead on top of the dragon and stab it down into its back. It cries out and its head reaches towards the sky as it breathes out blue flames once more. It struggles as twists its body trying to throw me off. I pull myself up on its back closer and closer to its head. Stabbing it in the back &nbsp;to pull myself closer and holding onto the scales on its back to keep myself from being flung off the dragon every time I pull out my sword.</p><p>Once I get to its neck I stab it hard and the half faced dragon breathes out fire in Jon&rsquo;s direction as if it were a reflex. I quickly pull myself to its head as it is at a slight stand still when breathing out fire and shove my sword into the top of its head. As I push my sword farther and farther into its skull. I take out my dagger and start yelling out a victory cry as I repeatedly stab its head. Placing all my eight on top of the sword to make it go farther into its skulls as I keep on pulling out my dagger from its head and thrust it back in repeatedly. </p><p>The dragon lets out a large cry as it breathes out a large gust of fire, which I hope Jon has been able to avoid. Right before it goes limp and collapses below me. I hold onto my sword as the beast falls finally. I breath in and out at a rapid breath as I stare wide eyed at where my hands are clutching the sword. I did it. I killed it.</p><p>I sigh out in relief as I lay on top of the dragon. My final bursts of energy leaving me as fatigue took over. I hear a sound and look up and see a wight rushing towards me. My eyes widen and I can hear Jon yelling at me in the background to get up, but I can&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m too tired and too scared to do anything. </p><p>Then the creature out of nowhere falls down. I look around me in confusion and see the other wights collapse one by one. I look over to Jon with a confused face which he returns as well.

By the time I&rsquo;m standing out in the courtyard my soldiers are all standing tall and ready whilst staring straight forward. A fourth of my men were standing in front of me. The other soldiers had been stationed by Ser Vadin. They&rsquo;re all good men and even better soldiers. I had hand picked them before our departure back to the mainland. They&rsquo;ve been trained in man different areas of combat, though they may not be as obedient and fearless as the Unsullied they still are worth a hundred soldiers each.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Queen (Y/N),&rdquo; I heard a voice come from my right and I look over to see Daenerys&rsquo; Hand. If it wasn&rsquo;t the Hand&rsquo;s pin over his heart than it was definitely his height that gave away who the man was. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;I presume you are Tyrion Lannister, Daenerys&rsquo; Hand?&rdquo; I asked with a small nod of my head in his direction.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You presumed correctly.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Well what is it you&rsquo;re here for?&rdquo; I asked him looking back to my men.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Just wanted to meet the Dragonslayer Queen in person, is all,&rdquo; I looked down at the man with a raised brow.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Well it is good to meet you in person as well. Though you may be the last person I meet.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;So it seems to be that way,&rdquo; and just like that Tyrion left.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Peculiar fellow,&rdquo; I heard Robin say from beside me.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;He seems too smart to be in the middle of all of this,&rdquo; I told him in reply as I watched the Hand of the Queen leave.</p>\n</p>",

The Night King, the powers he possessed to create an army of dead men and beasts alike was unlike anything she had ever seen before. It was terrifying, and yet it still didn\u2019t scare her more than the terrible secret Jon Snow had revealed to her the night they had arrived in the North.</p><p>Aegon Targaryen.</p><!-- more --><p>If it was true, if Jon Snow was the true-born son of her brother Rhaegar Targaryen, then he had a claim to the iron throne. All the allies and connections she had made in Westeros would fall from her already fragile grasp and into his lap. His birthright was a direct challenge to everything she had ever worked for, and it rattled her more than a million dead soldiers could.</p><p>Flinching as the stiff wooden door creaked open, she glanced over her shoulder and felt a wave of unease tumble in her belly as Jon greeted her with his steady dark gaze. It was as if he knew she had been thinking about him.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace.\u201d He murmured, lowering his head respectfully as he hovered in the doorway. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to disturb you&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not.\u201d Dany raised her chin and composed herself enough to smile at the King in the North, still feeling so deeply for him even after his revelation. \u201cClose the door behind you, it\u2019ll keep the heat in.\u201d</p><p>Stepping inside the dark room that was lit by candlelight, Jon pushed the door shut and clicked the lock into place. It was a move that didn\u2019t go unnoticed by Daenerys as her pale violet eyes locked into his gloved hand before finding his face again.</p><p>His expression was unreadable, as it always seemed to be. Dark brow furrowed and lips pressed into a firm line, he took long strides towards her.</p><p>A breath hitched in her throat when one of his hands pressed against the small of her back, pulling her into his chest while the other tangled into her braided silver locks. His lips were against hers in an instant, a feverish crash of tongue and teeth as he breathed her in.</p><p>In this moment, titles and birthrights meant nothing. In this moment she had found heaven and she didn\u2019t want to leave.</p><p>\u201cJon&hellip;\u201d She whispered lovingly, wrapping her arms around his neck.</p><p>Leaning back, the King in the North peppered kisses down her pale throat and nuzzled his nose beneath her jaw. He could have drowned in her right there and then, but the bastard name that he had carried on his shoulders for all these years pulled him out of his trance.</p><p>Stroking his thumb against her lower lip, he gazed into her eyes and saw for himself the kind of love he had craved since Igrid\u2019s death.</p><p>\u201cAegon.\u201d He corrected her, his voice ragged. \u201cSay it.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys was stunned into silence, and she was torn from the clouds above and thrust into reality once again. Facing the man she loved, the Targaryen Queen shook her head.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d She whispered, wanting the earth to swallow her whole.</p><p>\u201cYou can.\u201d He told her.</p><p>\u201cIf I say it \u2014 it makes it real.\u201d She said. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you so afraid of?\u201d He asked, seeing terror bleed into her features. \u201cYou are my Queen, you will always be my Queen. My real name changes nothing between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt changes everything!\u201d Daenerys snapped, not understanding how Jon was so oblivious to it all. \u201cYou are the last male Targaryen heir, if Westeros learns that your name is Aegon Targaryen then I lose everything I have ever worked towards. I lose my claim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will lose nothing.\u201d He assured her, the tone in his voice deep and unwavering. \u201cYou will rule the seven kingdoms of Westeros by my side, you will rule any land you choose to by my side. I will give you anything and everything you could ever want, so long as you give yourself to me now and always.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys parted her lips to speak, but she was speechless as Jon took her face between his hands. \u201cI bent the knee for you because I love you, would you do the same for me?\u201d</p>",
