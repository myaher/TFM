Written from Dany\u2019s PoV which was very hard to write. I think it\u2019s extremely difficult.<br/></p><p>A short warning. Dany thinks she is pregnant, but she isn\u2019t. Just for the people who don\u2019t like that particular plot.</p><p>Lady Stark\nhad been as good as her word. There had been meat for Drogon and food and\nclothing for her Unsullied, even something like a feast, if you could call it\nthat. The frugality was certainly overdone, and Dany was sure, that Lady Stark\nheld back, just to drive home her insistence that they had to ration for the\nwinter. But her stomach was tender, and she was grateful for the bland food, that\nshe could keep down. The tension in the great hall had been almost thick enough\nfor her to hold it, but the Northern Lords had been polite enough. Certainly, for\nsomeone who had faced down the hatred of the Mereen masters, it was nothing.</p><!-- more --><p>Her rooms\nwere a bit too serene for her taste as well. Apparently, Lady Stark had reserved\nthe best room for Dany as was her due, and Lady Stark herself had moved to\nanother part of the castle. Dany had not slept well, though. Her dreams were\nstill haunted by the green flames that had engulfed the Red Keep, the voices\nthat screamed, and her narrow escape on Drogon. It didn\u2019t matter. The Red Keep\nhad collapsed as if the sun had gone down in red and green fire. <i>If I look back, I am lost.</i> The capital\nwas hers, Lady Stark already tried to get in her good graces. When Jon\nreturned, Dany would get her dragon back.</p><p>Dany was on\nher way to the godswood, led by both the Stark ladies. Greyworm was her escort\nand she was glad about him. Of late, she didn\u2019t like to be alone, and she did\nnot trust the Starks, especially not Arya. <i>Stick\nher with the pointy end.</i> Jon had insisted it was a joke, but the smaller\nStark girl looked fierce.</p><p>The\ngodswood was indeed a small wood, the branches were laden with snow. When they\npassed under the trees, one of the trees shuddered as if he wanted to get rid\nof his burden and snow fell. It hit Dany at the neck, and she shuddered\ninvoluntarily when the cold crept down her back. She tried to picture years and\nyears living in this silent snow. She did not like it. In such a silent wood\nshe could almost hear voices screaming as from afar. Once she had her other\ndragon back, she would see to it, that Winterfell would burn, and that her\ninsolent nephew would pay for the crime of stealing Rhaegal. She could be\npatient though. <i>First things first.</i></p><p>They came\nto a small clearing. In the mid of it was a small pool and a huge tree at the\npool, the bark only slightly less white than the snow all around them, the\nleaves red as a fresh wound. Tendrils of steam rose from the pool like fingers\nthat reached out to the tree. The pool must have a connection to the hot water\npools beneath Winterfell. </p><p>Brandon\nStark sat beside the tree, on a chair with wheels, his legs packed into layers\nof covers. His face showed no motion when they approached, but his eyes snapped\nin her direction.</p><p>\u201cBran, this\nis Daenerys Targaryen,\u201d Arya said.</p><p>Dany\nfrowned. <i>She should have introduced me as\nqueen.</i> Missandei would have done that better.</p><p>The\ncrippled man, <i>no really, still a boy, by\nthe look of him,</i> nodded and gestured at his legs as if apologizing for not\ngetting up to greet her.</p><p>\u201cI am the\nthree-eyed raven.\u201d</p><p>Dany gave\nhim one of her dazzling smiles. </p><p>\u201cI heard\nabout you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome\nhere.\u201d</p><p>When Dany\ncame closer, his eyes locked onto hers.</p><p>\u201cYou need\nto see, but let me explain.\u201d</p><p>He took her\nleft hand in his, his hand felt strange, not cold, but not warm either, as if the\nwarm blood stole away when her fingers touched his.</p><p>\u201cThe future\nis an ever-shifting stream.

Apparently, Lady Stark had reserved\nthe best room for Dany as was her due, and Lady Stark herself had moved to\nanother part of the castle. Dany had not slept well, though. Her dreams were\nstill haunted by the green flames that had engulfed the Red Keep, the voices\nthat screamed, and her narrow escape on Drogon. It didn\u2019t matter. The Red Keep\nhad collapsed as if the sun had gone down in red and green fire. <i>If I look back, I am lost.</i> The capital\nwas hers, Lady Stark already tried to get in her good graces.

When they\npassed under the trees, one of the trees shuddered as if he wanted to get rid\nof his burden and snow fell. It hit Dany at the neck, and she shuddered\ninvoluntarily when the cold crept down her back. She tried to picture years and\nyears living in this silent snow. She did not like it. In such a silent wood\nshe could almost hear voices screaming as from afar.

In the mid of it was a small pool and a huge tree at the\npool, the bark only slightly less white than the snow all around them, the\nleaves red as a fresh wound. Tendrils of steam rose from the pool like fingers\nthat reached out to the tree. The pool must have a connection to the hot water\npools beneath Winterfell. </p><p>Brandon\nStark sat beside the tree, on a chair with wheels, his legs packed into layers\nof covers.

She was never a patient creature and the crown that rests upon her head only serves to validate her impatience. She is tired of waiting for men. The world would be better off without them, she thinks. They\u2019re all treacherous scum seeking to feed off of the fairer sex. And once their appetite has been satiated they leave in search of something new. </p><p>The throne room is empty save for the Mountain. Qyburn has just left, his message delivered and received. The remaining lords and ladies have already scampered back to their hovels. <i>It\u2019s better to be alone than in bad company. Much better. </i></p><p>In strides Euron Greyjoy. If rumors are to be believed, he\u2019s the last male Greyjoy with a working cock. Cersei thinks the wannabe pirate brags too much about his <i>sword</i>. Of what she\u2019s seen, her prisoner in the dark cells is more of a kraken than both remaining male relatives combined. But that is the lot of women. Their sex will always pull them under. She is the exception.</p><p>A crown and a throne work wonders. A queen is so much more than a woman. A queen is power. And Cersei will burn anyone who stands in her way. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re back. Good. Am I to assume you were successful?\u201d </p><p>Euron Greyjoy tries to saunter towards her. He only succeeds in repulsing her. The weeks he spent away have diluted her memory of him. He is fouler than she remembered. The odor of stagnant ocean water can not be masked by the, rather obvious, perfumes he has brought back from across the Narrow Sea. Even from atop the throne she can smell him.</p><p><i>As if I would ever suffer another man with an ego-complex. </i>Cersei looks towards her shield. <i>The Mountain will snap his neck before his breath ever so much as </i>touches<i> me.</i></p><p>The Mountain strikes out a thick arm to stop his advances. Greyjoy lifts a dark eyebrow and puts his hands up in a mocking gesture of surrender. He doesn\u2019t move any closer. Cersei likes this. Who knew she would one day be able to command men with a simple tilt of her head? The Mountain drops his arm but stays standing next to Euron. </p><p>\u201cYes, my queen,\u201d his leer is more than evident in his voice, \u201cI\u2019ve brought back the Golden Company just as we agreed. Now, I expect to be properly compensated.\u201d </p><p>She peers down at him. He wants to marry her and be her king. She would be an idiot to trust him. There are others who have pledged themselves to her. Others who she can, and has, controlled better. But there may be some use to him, yet.</p><p>Cersei leers back. She is queen, and a lion. She will not be cowed by an irreverent squid. \u201cAh, yes. Your compensation&hellip;\u201d</p><p>//</p><p><i>It\u2019s certainly not what I was expecting. Not that I know what I was expecting to begin with but&hellip;</i> Dany accepts Jorah\u2019s hand as he helps her dismount the finicky Northern steed. Her eyes wander to Jon who is looking towards Winterfell. <i>Nevermind that. I\u2019m sure it is more inviting, warmer, on the inside. Much like its former king.</i></p><p>\u201cIt is a sight I did not think I would ever see again. You have made one of my greatest dreams possible, my queen.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys turns towards the old bear. She can see true thankfulness in his eyes. It is a homecoming for more than one northerner, today. In the flurry of action she had forgotten that Jorah would most likely be reuniting with family. She is glad one of her oldest supporters will soon fulfill their biggest wish because of her. </p><p>\u201cMy dear friend, it has been a long journey but you are finally back home in the north.\u201d She clasps his arm. \u201cMayhaps the north will become a home of sorts for me as well.\u201d</p><p>Underneath her hand she can feel him tense at her words. She knows her bear holds no love for the wolf that is slowly, but surely, melting the ice around her heart. Jorah\u2019s jealousy is flattering but she knows what she wants. With a smile Daenerys leaves Jorah and walks towards Jon.</p><p>The white landscape and the cold makes her uncomfortable but she will never admit it. What is a little snow and winter wind to a dragon made of fire? Jon remains facing towards Winterfell when she finally arrives at his side. \u201cWe are almost there. I am eager to meet your family, Jon Snow.\u201d</p><p>Jon hums his agreement. </p><p>They\u2019ve stopped to arrange any last minute details before arriving at Winterfell. Her children are to be sent somewhere close to the keep but far away enough to not cause panic. Jon had insisted. She is loathe to part from them but ultimately yields. He probably knows the northerners better than she. Nevertheless, she misses them. She fears to lose them ever since the incident beyond the wall. Her eyes search the sky for Drogon. She can feel his presence. He is still near. </p><p>Tyrion, and Varys are discussing some trivial matters with the Unsullied about what to expect in regards to their welcome. <i>Details, details, details. I\u2019m tired of waiting.</i></p><p>Daenerys touches Jon and gently turns him away from Winterfell and towards her. He moves stiffly in the cold. <i>I will be sure to warm him up later in his Lord\u2019s chambers.</i> \u201cYou have been awfully quiet. More so than usual. Should I be worried?\u201d</p><p>Jon\u2019s eyes slowly warm at her words. The corner of his lips upturn in a reassuring smile. No wonder Jorah is jealous. His worry over her is obvious now. In her very rare moments of worry, or anxiety he is always there to reassure her. She is quite sure he is in love with her. She herself doesn\u2019t love him. Yet. <i>I could. I am in danger of it. I feel it.</i></p><p>\u201cNo. There is nothing to worry about. I will speak with the Northern lords and make them understand that you are here to fight with us.\u201d He pauses to collect his thoughts. \u201cThey will see you for what you are.\u201d</p><p>Those words again. Just like before they light a fire within her. He sees her for what she is. A liberator. A savior. A queen.</p><p><i>His queen.</i> </p><p>The breaker of chains looks up at the last King of the North. He looks like he is holding himself back from a great emotion. <i>He must want to hold me now.</i> Daenerys wouldn\u2019t care but he has been adamant in avoiding any kind of public intimacy for fear of repercussion to their political alliance. She admires his patience and fortitude. As mother of dragons she forgets how it must be for the rest of the world. To always have to care what others think or do. To not take without asking. Always waiting for permission. What a bleak existence that must be. </p><p>A shout from behind breaks their tension. It is time to move again. Jon nods at her and leaves to mount his horse. Daenerys watches his cloak flap behind him like \u00a0black wings. Soon she\u2019ll meet his people. His family. Soon she\u2019ll learn more about the king who gave away his kingdom for love. </p><p><i>For me.</i></p><p><i>//</i></p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s almost here.\u201d Bran says. The low and long sound of a horn interrupts him. \u201cObserve and take in as much as you can. Go.\u201d</p><p>//</p><p>Tyrion had forgotten how utterly dull the North is. <i>Everywhere I look, snow covers everything.</i></p><p>Varys has his hands hidden away, like always, within the confines of his sleeves. The muted colors of his robes only serve to remind him that summer is long gone. Tyrion turns to look outside of the carriage window. They are near Winterfell\u2019s gates. Won\u2019t be long before it all goes to the Seven Hells. The Northern fools are too stubborn to take kindly to a Targaryen queen. He doesn\u2019t have high hopes for this alliance. <i>Not since\u2013</i></p><p>\u201dYou know, your face is doing that thing again.\u201d</p><p>\u201dI\u2019m sorry but I\u2019m afraid you will have to elaborate. My handsome features do many \u2018things\u2019. What exactly are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>Varys looks out of the opposite window. The view is the same. Snow. \u201cYou used to be better at hiding your thoughts, your feelings. Not enough to fool me, of course. But now you\u2019re an open book even an illiterate could read.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion turns to look at Varys. \u201cAnd what do you see on my face, hm? If I\u2019m such an open book, pray, tell me.\u201d</p><p>The imp of Casterly Rock watches the eunuch watch the scenery pass by.</p><p><i>Of course. </i>Now<i> he\u2019s quiet.</i> </p><p>The carriage rolls to a stop. They\u2019ve arrived. \u201cFear, Tyrion. That\u2019s what I see. You are wise to feel that way.\u201d Varys pauses before fully exiting the carriage. \u201cBut a fool to show it.\u201d</p><p>The serving girl leaves the godswood behind her. She picks up her coarse skirts and makes her way to the outside of the keep proper. The king is come back with a Targaryen! Her curiosity makes her run fast and nimble as she weaves her way through the soldiers and serving folk. </p><p>\u201cWatch it, girl. You near ran me over!\u201d</p><p>Anise doesn\u2019t stop. Her hazel eyes drink in everything they can. The horses, the people, the carts. She perches herself atop a stack of empty vegetable crates to get a better view. She anxiously awaits for a sign of dragons in the overcast sky. The Lannister imp is here, as is a bald plump man. She can see them through the small windows of their carriage.</p><p><i>Varys. His name is Varys.</i></p><p>Anise has never met them before. But names are easy to come by. She notices the soldiers are well trained. Even in their strange winter garb they show no signs of discomfort. That must be the Unsullied. </p><p>There is another kind of soldier in the courtyard. They are quite different and seem to be faring worse than the Unsullied. Their ears are rust red and their long black hair swings wildly behind them. There aren\u2019t many of them here. Thirty at most.</p><p><i>Dothraki.</i></p><p>They are speaking a strange mixture of the common tongue and a language Anise has never heard before. Nevertheless, she listens and recognizes a few phrases.</p><p>\u201cCold&hellip;Khalessi&hellip;Snow\u201d</p><p>\u201c&hellip;Gold&hellip;lions&hellip;burn\u201d</p><p>\u201c&hellip;food&hellip;food&hellip;food&hellip;\u201d</p><p>Anise turns her attention towards the king. He has finally returned to Winterfell. He\u2019s finally here. </p><p><i>Will he recognize me after all these years? Do I want him to recognize me?</i></p><p>Anise pushes these strange thoughts away. She is a simple serving girl. She has no ties to the king. She is only here to watch and observe.</p><p>The main party and King Jon are soon within the walls of Winterfell. The procession of Unsullied keeps passing by, arranging themselves around the keep. She watches them.</p><p><i>They are too many to house inside. The \u00a0Targaryen girl and her retinue will be housed inside. But what about all her men?</i></p><p>Anise swings her feet and, to pass the time, makes a game of counting how many carts of food and resources she can see.</p><p><i>Five,</i></p><p>Grain.</p><p><i>Ten,</i></p><p>Cloth, animal skins, a few furs.</p><p><i>Fifteen,</i></p><p>Weapons.</p><p><i>Twen\u2014</i></p><p>A screech is the only warning she and the rest of the bystanders receive before everyone scampers away in fear. Anise doesn\u2019t know where her courage comes from but she stands on the crates and bends her head back in awe. </p><p><i>Dragons. They\u2019re real.</i></p><p><i>They\u2019re </i>here<i>.</i></p><p>The dragon flies directly above Winterfell before flying into the mist and fog of the woods. She jumps off the crates. There is much one can learn from being at the right place at the right time. It\u2019s time to leave her perch. Anise looks with wonder at the passing caravan. With wide eyes and a juvenile smile she follows the Targaryen procession into Winterfell\u2019s courtyard.</p><p>//</p><p>It\u2019s cold and the days are getting shorter. Gilly is used to it so she doesn\u2019t complain. Everyone is in a frenzy. A horn of some sort is signaling the arrival of Jon Snow and his aunt. She remembers hearing it an hour or two ago when they had first been spotted by the watchmen. \u00a0Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen are here. Her name sounds funny to Gilly but what does she know of queens and dragons? </p><p>\u201cGilly, come! He\u2019s here!\u201d</p><p>Gilly looks at Sam in mild bemusement. He sounds like a child in his excitement. Gilly adjusts Little Sam on her hip and follows him to the railing that overlooks the courtyard. There is so much noise that Little Sam squirms in curiosity but Gilly strengthens her hold. It wouldn\u2019t do for him to leave her arms. Not with soldiers and dragons in their midst. </p><p>\u201cWhere are the dragons, Sam?\u201d</p><p>His eyes never waver from the action underneath. \u201cEh, I don\u2019t know. Perhaps they\u2019re away from the keep?\u201d</p><p>She has never seen a dragon. But she has seen creatures of ice. She isn\u2019t sure that creatures of fire are any better.</p><p>Gilly sets her sight on the newcomers. A head of white, silverlike hair stands off by the entrance to the castle. She, for Gilly can see her fair features, is flanked by soldiers. They are dressed in black leather with dark, sun-kissed skin she has never seen before. <i>That must be the dragon queen. Then where is Jon Snow&hellip;</i></p><p>Gilly finds him. His head of black hair is walking towards Sansa Stark. Gilly inhales her surprise. The Lady opens her arms and holds Jon Snow in a welcoming embrace. In the small amount of time Gilly has been in Winterfell she has noted how restrictive Sansa Stark is with her affection and touch. When she first met her she had thought her to be Winterfell\u2019s queen. Gilly brushes Little Sam\u2019s hair back. She doesn\u2019t think she has ever seen the Lady of Winterfell touch someone so intimately before. </p><p>She wonders where Lady Arya is. If Sam is correct, she was the one Jon Snow would talk about the most during their time at the Night\u2019s Watch. It seems she isn\u2019t here to welcome her cousin home. </p><p>In that moment a terrible sound meets her ears, and makes Little Sam cry. The courtyard is hit by wind and shadow as the sun seems to be momentarily smothered. In the covered walkway Gilly can only see the end of the beast\u2019s tail as it flies overhead. She presses her son closer to her chest.</p><p>\u201cSam! A dragon! They\u2014they\u2019re real!\u201d</p><p>What else could it be if not a dragon?</p><p>There is a change in the air after that small terrifying moment and Gilly focuses on the men and women in the courtyard. She wasn\u2019t the only one scared by the dragon. Common and noble folk alike \u00a0are twisting and turning their heads to see if another dragon will pass by. Lady Sansa acts as if nothing happened but Gilly can see how the blonde lady knight moved closer to her lady.</p><p>\u201c&hellip;queen Daenerys Targaryen. I promised I would&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Sam mutters. \u201cOh, no.\u201d</p><p>No one is kneeling in the courtyard. Isn\u2019t it part of their customs? To kneel? She read that somewhere, she is sure of it. But no one is kneeling when Jon Snow introduces his aunt to the people of Winterfell. Gilly is confused. Is he no longer king?</p><p>Little Sam pulls at his father\u2019s cloak until Sam relents and carries him. Daenerys Targaryen walks towards Jon Snow and Sansa Stark. Unlike her soldiers, the queen is dressed in thick white furs that surely keep her warm.</p><p>\u201cWinterfell is yours, your grace.\u201d Sansa Stark\u2019s voice carries in the stillness of the moment. Gilly doesn\u2019t believe her. She has seen this woman care for her castle like Gilly herself cares for Little Sam. Daenerys Targaryen seems pleased, though.</p><p>\u201cIs Winterfell no longer the Starks\u2019? What is going on, Sam?\u201d</p><p>Sam continues to look at Jon Snow as he leads his aunt to the inside of Winterfell.</p><p>\u201cI\u2018m not sure, Gilly. All I know is this complicates everything.\u201d Gilly and Sam watch how the dragon queen\u2019s eyes follow Jon Snow everywhere he goes. \u201cJon, what have you done?\u201d</p><p>//</p><p><i>It\u2019s strange, being here.</i> He hikes his rucksack over his shoulder. <i>I wonder if&hellip;</i></p><p>\u201cThis is queen Daenerys Targaryen. I promised I would come back with aid for the fight against the Others.\u201d She begins to walk towards Jon Snow as he introduces her. \u201cIn bringing her to the North I have fulfilled that promise.\u201d</p><p>Her white and red furs make her stand out against the stones, mud, and wood. Sansa Stark seems to lose some of the levity she had upon embracing her brother. He doesn\u2019t blame her. Having a dragon flying above your home without warning and scaring your people <i>is</i> a bit rude. Then again, <i>are</i> there proper courtesies when it comes to dragons?</p><p>The Targaryen girl stops by Jon Snow\u2019s side and faces Sansa Stark. He makes note that no one in the courtyard kneels before the mother of dragons. If the Lady of Winterfell doesn\u2019t kneel neither does its people.</p><p><i>Well, this is awkward.</i></p><p>She doesn\u2019t seem bothered. <i>Or maybe she doesn\u2019t see it as a slight. Considering her and Jon\u2019s\u2014</i></p><p>\u201cWinterfell is yours&hellip;\u201d</p><p>A servant squeezes past him and draws his attention away from the scene playing out before them all. His rucksack slides off his shoulder with her movement and thuds to the cold ground.</p><p>\u201cHey, look where you\u2019re going,\u201d he mutters as he bends to pick it up.</p><p>Quick as a whip the little maid turns her blonde head. Her mouth opens when she sees him. Her eyes shift from young innocence to something far too jaded for her age. The girl\u2019s stare makes him feel transparent. </p><p>\u201cWhat? You want to catch flies or something, kid?\u201d</p><p>She looks down at his war hammer before looking back up at him. </p><p>\u201cGendry?\u201d Her voice tilts at the end but it doesn\u2019t sound like a question. She seems certain of who he is.</p><p>\u201cDo I know you?\u201d His eyebrows come together in concentration as he takes a step towards her. </p><p>Before he knows it she\u2019s gone and lost among the Unsullied, Dothraki, and northerners. </p><p>The Hound hits his shoulder with a heavy hand. \u201cCome on, <i>Bull</i>.\u201d His voice is mocking. \u201cUs beasts are far too low for them pretty creatures. She had one look at ya and ran away.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s in <strike>Arry\u2019s</strike><i> Lady Arya\u2019s</i> home, now. There\u2019s no way he can forget how low he is. Gendry shoulders the offending hand away and follows the rest of the men inside. <i>As if I needed a reminder of how low I am. I\u2019ve known that my entire life.</i></p><p><i>//</i></p><p>Leagues away from Winterfell the fingers of winter are tightening their grip. Slowly and surely the grass and trees are stiffening with frost. Jaime squints at the lowering sun. Nightfall is drawing near. He would be worried but it has been more than a sennight since he left Kings Landing behind. The chances of being captured by his sister\u2019s forces weaken with each step his horse takes.</p><p>\u201cYou know, it\u2019s gonna cost you more than before.

She was never a patient creature and the crown that rests upon her head only serves to validate her impatience. She is tired of waiting for men. The world would be better off without them, she thinks. They\u2019re all treacherous scum seeking to feed off of the fairer sex. And once their appetite has been satiated they leave in search of something new. </p><p>The throne room is empty save for the Mountain. Qyburn has just left, his message delivered and received. The remaining lords and ladies have already scampered back to their hovels. <i>It\u2019s better to be alone than in bad company. Much better. </i></p><p>In strides Euron Greyjoy. If rumors are to be believed, he\u2019s the last male Greyjoy with a working cock. Cersei thinks the wannabe pirate brags too much about his <i>sword</i>. Of what she\u2019s seen, her prisoner in the dark cells is more of a kraken than both remaining male relatives combined. But that is the lot of women. Their sex will always pull them under. She is the exception.</p><p>A crown and a throne work wonders. A queen is so much more than a woman. A queen is power. And Cersei will burn anyone who stands in her way. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re back. Good. Am I to assume you were successful?\u201d </p><p>Euron Greyjoy tries to saunter towards her. He only succeeds in repulsing her. The weeks he spent away have diluted her memory of him. He is fouler than she remembered. The odor of stagnant ocean water can not be masked by the, rather obvious, perfumes he has brought back from across the Narrow Sea. Even from atop the throne she can smell him.</p><p><i>As if I would ever suffer another man with an ego-complex. </i>Cersei looks towards her shield. <i>The Mountain will snap his neck before his breath ever so much as </i>touches<i> me.</i></p><p>The Mountain strikes out a thick arm to stop his advances. Greyjoy lifts a dark eyebrow and puts his hands up in a mocking gesture of surrender. He doesn\u2019t move any closer. Cersei likes this. Who knew she would one day be able to command men with a simple tilt of her head? The Mountain drops his arm but stays standing next to Euron. </p><p>\u201cYes, my queen,\u201d his leer is more than evident in his voice, \u201cI\u2019ve brought back the Golden Company just as we agreed. Now, I expect to be properly compensated.\u201d </p><p>She peers down at him. He wants to marry her and be her king. She would be an idiot to trust him. There are others who have pledged themselves to her. Others who she can, and has, controlled better. But there may be some use to him, yet.</p><p>Cersei leers back. She is queen, and a lion. She will not be cowed by an irreverent squid. \u201cAh, yes. Your compensation\u2026\u201d</p><p>//</p><p><i>It\u2019s certainly not what I was expecting. Not that I know what I was expecting to begin with but\u2026</i> Dany accepts Jorah\u2019s hand as he helps her dismount the finicky Northern steed. Her eyes wander to Jon who is looking towards Winterfell. <i>Nevermind that. I\u2019m sure it is more inviting, warmer, on the inside. Much like its former king.</i></p><p>\u201cIt is a sight I did not think I would ever see again. You have made one of my greatest dreams possible, my queen.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys turns towards the old bear. She can see true thankfulness in his eyes. It is a homecoming for more than one northerner, today. In the flurry of action she had forgotten that Jorah would most likely be reuniting with family. She is glad one of her oldest supporters will soon fulfill their biggest wish because of her. </p><p>\u201cMy dear friend, it has been a long journey but you are finally back home in the north.\u201d She clasps his arm. \u201cMayhaps the north will become a home of sorts for me as well.\u201d</p><p>Underneath her hand she can feel him tense at her words. She knows her bear holds no love for the wolf that is slowly, but surely, melting the ice around her heart. Jorah\u2019s jealousy is flattering but she knows what she wants. With a smile Daenerys leaves Jorah and walks towards Jon.</p><p>The white landscape and the cold makes her uncomfortable but she will never admit it. What is a little snow and winter wind to a dragon made of fire? Jon remains facing towards Winterfell when she finally arrives at his side. \u201cWe are almost there. I am eager to meet your family, Jon Snow.\u201d</p><p>Jon hums his agreement. </p><p>They\u2019ve stopped to arrange any last minute details before arriving at Winterfell. Her children are to be sent somewhere close to the keep but far away enough to not cause panic. Jon had insisted. She is loathe to part from them but ultimately yields. He probably knows the northerners better than she. Nevertheless, she misses them. She fears to lose them ever since the incident beyond the wall. Her eyes search the sky for Drogon. She can feel his presence. He is still near. </p><p>Tyrion, and Varys are discussing some trivial matters with the Unsullied about what to expect in regards to their welcome. <i>Details, details, details. I\u2019m tired of waiting.</i></p><p>Daenerys touches Jon and gently turns him away from Winterfell and towards her. He moves stiffly in the cold. <i>I will be sure to warm him up later in his Lord\u2019s chambers.</i> \u201cYou have been awfully quiet. More so than usual. Should I be worried?\u201d</p><p>Jon\u2019s eyes slowly warm at her words. The corner of his lips upturn in a reassuring smile. No wonder Jorah is jealous. His worry over her is obvious now. In her very rare moments of worry, or anxiety he is always there to reassure her. She is quite sure he is in love with her. She herself doesn\u2019t love him. Yet. <i>I could. I am in danger of it. I feel it.</i></p><p>\u201cNo. There is nothing to worry about. I will speak with the Northern lords and make them understand that you are here to fight with us.\u201d He pauses to collect his thoughts. \u201cThey will see you for what you are.\u201d</p><p>Those words again. Just like before they light a fire within her. He sees her for what she is. A liberator. A savior. A queen.</p><p><i>His queen.</i> </p><p>The breaker of chains looks up at the last King of the North. He looks like he is holding himself back from a great emotion. <i>He must want to hold me now.</i> Daenerys wouldn\u2019t care but he has been adamant in avoiding any kind of public intimacy for fear of repercussion to their political alliance. She admires his patience and fortitude. As mother of dragons she forgets how it must be for the rest of the world. To always have to care what others think or do. To not take without asking. Always waiting for permission. What a bleak existence that must be. </p><p>A shout from behind breaks their tension. It is time to move again. Jon nods at her and leaves to mount his horse. Daenerys watches his cloak flap behind him like \u00a0black wings. Soon she\u2019ll meet his people. His family. Soon she\u2019ll learn more about the king who gave away his kingdom for love. </p><p><i>For me.</i></p><p><i>//</i></p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s almost here.\u201d Bran says. The low and long sound of a horn interrupts him. \u201cObserve and take in as much as you can. Go.\u201d</p><p>//</p><p>Tyrion had forgotten how utterly dull the North is. <i>Everywhere I look, snow covers everything.</i></p><p>Varys has his hands hidden away, like always, within the confines of his sleeves. The muted colors of his robes only serve to remind him that summer is long gone. Tyrion turns to look outside of the carriage window. They are near Winterfell\u2019s gates. Won\u2019t be long before it all goes to the Seven Hells. The Northern fools are too stubborn to take kindly to a Targaryen queen. He doesn\u2019t have high hopes for this alliance. <i>Not since\u2013</i></p><p>\u201dYou know, your face is doing that thing again.\u201d</p><p>\u201dI\u2019m sorry but I\u2019m afraid you will have to elaborate. My handsome features do many \u2018things\u2019. What exactly are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>Varys looks out of the opposite window. The view is the same. Snow. \u201cYou used to be better at hiding your thoughts, your feelings. Not enough to fool me, of course. But now you\u2019re an open book even an illiterate could read.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion turns to look at Varys. \u201cAnd what do you see on my face, hm? If I\u2019m such an open book, pray, tell me.\u201d</p><p>The imp of Casterly Rock watches the eunuch watch the scenery pass by.</p><p><i>Of course. </i>Now<i> he\u2019s quiet.</i> </p><p>The carriage rolls to a stop. They\u2019ve arrived. \u201cFear, Tyrion. That\u2019s what I see. You are wise to feel that way.\u201d Varys pauses before fully exiting the carriage. \u201cBut a fool to show it.\u201d</p><p>The serving girl leaves the godswood behind her. She picks up her coarse skirts and makes her way to the outside of the keep proper. The king is come back with a Targaryen! Her curiosity makes her run fast and nimble as she weaves her way through the soldiers and serving folk. </p><p>\u201cWatch it, girl. You near ran me over!\u201d</p><p>Anise doesn\u2019t stop. Her hazel eyes drink in everything they can. The horses, the people, the carts. She perches herself atop a stack of empty vegetable crates to get a better view. She anxiously awaits for a sign of dragons in the overcast sky. The Lannister imp is here, as is a bald plump man. She can see them through the small windows of their carriage.</p><p><i>Varys. His name is Varys.</i></p><p>Anise has never met them before. But names are easy to come by. She notices the soldiers are well trained. Even in their strange winter garb they show no signs of discomfort. That must be the Unsullied. </p><p>There is another kind of soldier in the courtyard. They are quite different and seem to be faring worse than the Unsullied. Their ears are rust red and their long black hair swings wildly behind them. There aren\u2019t many of them here. Thirty at most.</p><p><i>Dothraki.</i></p><p>They are speaking a strange mixture of the common tongue and a language Anise has never heard before. Nevertheless, she listens and recognizes a few phrases.</p><p>\u201cCold\u2026Khalessi\u2026Snow\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026Gold\u2026lions\u2026burn\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026food\u2026food\u2026food\u2026\u201d</p><p>Anise turns her attention towards the king. He has finally returned to Winterfell. He\u2019s finally here. </p><p><i>Will he recognize me after all these years? Do I want him to recognize me?</i></p><p>Anise pushes these strange thoughts away. She is a simple serving girl. She has no ties to the king. She is only here to watch and observe.</p><p>The main party and King Jon are soon within the walls of Winterfell. The procession of Unsullied keeps passing by, arranging themselves around the keep. She watches them.</p><p><i>They are too many to house inside. The \u00a0Targaryen girl and her retinue will be housed inside. But what about all her men?</i></p><p>Anise swings her feet and, to pass the time, makes a game of counting how many carts of food and resources she can see.</p><p><i>Five,</i></p><p>Grain.</p><p><i>Ten,</i></p><p>Cloth, animal skins, a few furs.</p><p><i>Fifteen,</i></p><p>Weapons.</p><p><i>Twen\u2014</i></p><p>A screech is the only warning she and the rest of the bystanders receive before everyone scampers away in fear. Anise doesn\u2019t know where her courage comes from but she stands on the crates and bends her head back in awe. </p><p><i>Dragons. They\u2019re real.</i></p><p><i>They\u2019re </i>here<i>.</i></p><p>The dragon flies directly above Winterfell before flying into the mist and fog of the woods. She jumps off the crates. There is much one can learn from being at the right place at the right time. It\u2019s time to leave her perch. Anise looks with wonder at the passing caravan. With wide eyes and a juvenile smile she follows the Targaryen procession into Winterfell\u2019s courtyard.</p><p>//</p><p>It\u2019s cold and the days are getting shorter. Gilly is used to it so she doesn\u2019t complain. Everyone is in a frenzy. A horn of some sort is signaling the arrival of Jon Snow and his aunt. She remembers hearing it an hour or two ago when they had first been spotted by the watchmen. \u00a0Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen are here. Her name sounds funny to Gilly but what does she know of queens and dragons? </p><p>\u201cGilly, come! He\u2019s here!\u201d</p><p>Gilly looks at Sam in mild bemusement. He sounds like a child in his excitement. Gilly adjusts Little Sam on her hip and follows him to the railing that overlooks the courtyard. There is so much noise that Little Sam squirms in curiosity but Gilly strengthens her hold. It wouldn\u2019t do for him to leave her arms. Not with soldiers and dragons in their midst. </p><p>\u201cWhere are the dragons, Sam?\u201d</p><p>His eyes never waver from the action underneath. \u201cEh, I don\u2019t know. Perhaps they\u2019re away from the keep?\u201d</p><p>She has never seen a dragon. But she has seen creatures of ice. She isn\u2019t sure that creatures of fire are any better.</p><p>Gilly sets her sight on the newcomers. A head of white, silverlike hair stands off by the entrance to the castle. She, for Gilly can see her fair features, is flanked by soldiers. They are dressed in black leather with dark, sun-kissed skin she has never seen before. <i>That must be the dragon queen. Then where is Jon Snow\u2026</i></p><p>Gilly finds him. His head of black hair is walking towards Sansa Stark. Gilly inhales her surprise. The Lady opens her arms and holds Jon Snow in a welcoming embrace. In the small amount of time Gilly has been in Winterfell she has noted how restrictive Sansa Stark is with her affection and touch. When she first met her she had thought her to be Winterfell\u2019s queen. Gilly brushes Little Sam\u2019s hair back. She doesn\u2019t think she has ever seen the Lady of Winterfell touch someone so intimately before. </p><p>She wonders where Lady Arya is. If Sam is correct, she was the one Jon Snow would talk about the most during their time at the Night\u2019s Watch. It seems she isn\u2019t here to welcome her cousin home. </p><p>In that moment a terrible sound meets her ears, and makes Little Sam cry. The courtyard is hit by wind and shadow as the sun seems to be momentarily smothered. In the covered walkway Gilly can only see the end of the beast\u2019s tail as it flies overhead. She presses her son closer to her chest.</p><p>\u201cSam! A dragon! They\u2014they\u2019re real!\u201d</p><p>What else could it be if not a dragon?</p><p>There is a change in the air after that small terrifying moment and Gilly focuses on the men and women in the courtyard. She wasn\u2019t the only one scared by the dragon. Common and noble folk alike \u00a0are twisting and turning their heads to see if another dragon will pass by. Lady Sansa acts as if nothing happened but Gilly can see how the blonde lady knight moved closer to her lady.</p><p>\u201c\u2026queen Daenerys Targaryen. I promised I would\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Sam mutters. \u201cOh, no.\u201d</p><p>No one is kneeling in the courtyard. Isn\u2019t it part of their customs? To kneel? She read that somewhere, she is sure of it. But no one is kneeling when Jon Snow introduces his aunt to the people of Winterfell. Gilly is confused. Is he no longer king?</p><p>Little Sam pulls at his father\u2019s cloak until Sam relents and carries him. Daenerys Targaryen walks towards Jon Snow and Sansa Stark. Unlike her soldiers, the queen is dressed in thick white furs that surely keep her warm.</p><p>\u201cWinterfell is yours, your grace.\u201d Sansa Stark\u2019s voice carries in the stillness of the moment. Gilly doesn\u2019t believe her. She has seen this woman care for her castle like Gilly herself cares for Little Sam. Daenerys Targaryen seems pleased, though.</p><p>\u201cIs Winterfell no longer the Starks\u2019? What is going on, Sam?\u201d</p><p>Sam continues to look at Jon Snow as he leads his aunt to the inside of Winterfell.</p><p>\u201cI\u2018m not sure, Gilly. All I know is this complicates everything.\u201d Gilly and Sam watch how the dragon queen\u2019s eyes follow Jon Snow everywhere he goes. \u201cJon, what have you done?\u201d</p><p>//</p><p><i>It\u2019s strange, being here.</i> He hikes his rucksack over his shoulder. <i>I wonder if\u2026</i></p><p>\u201cThis is queen Daenerys Targaryen. I promised I would come back with aid for the fight against the Others.\u201d She begins to walk towards Jon Snow as he introduces her. \u201cIn bringing her to the North I have fulfilled that promise.\u201d</p><p>Her white and red furs make her stand out against the stones, mud, and wood. Sansa Stark seems to lose some of the levity she had upon embracing her brother. He doesn\u2019t blame her. Having a dragon flying above your home without warning and scaring your people <i>is</i> a bit rude. Then again, <i>are</i> there proper courtesies when it comes to dragons?</p><p>The Targaryen girl stops by Jon Snow\u2019s side and faces Sansa Stark. He makes note that no one in the courtyard kneels before the mother of dragons. If the Lady of Winterfell doesn\u2019t kneel neither does its people.</p><p><i>Well, this is awkward.</i></p><p>She doesn\u2019t seem bothered. <i>Or maybe she doesn\u2019t see it as a slight. Considering her and Jon\u2019s\u2014</i></p><p>\u201cWinterfell is yours\u2026\u201d</p><p>A servant squeezes past him and draws his attention away from the scene playing out before them all. His rucksack slides off his shoulder with her movement and thuds to the cold ground.</p><p>\u201cHey, look where you\u2019re going,\u201d he mutters as he bends to pick it up.</p><p>Quick as a whip the little maid turns her blonde head. Her mouth opens when she sees him. Her eyes shift from young innocence to something far too jaded for her age. The girl\u2019s stare makes him feel transparent. </p><p>\u201cWhat? You want to catch flies or something, kid?\u201d</p><p>She looks down at his war hammer before looking back up at him. </p><p>\u201cGendry?\u201d Her voice tilts at the end but it doesn\u2019t sound like a question. She seems certain of who he is.</p><p>\u201cDo I know you?\u201d His eyebrows come together in concentration as he takes a step towards her. </p><p>Before he knows it she\u2019s gone and lost among the Unsullied, Dothraki, and northerners. </p><p>The Hound hits his shoulder with a heavy hand. \u201cCome on, <i>Bull</i>.\u201d His voice is mocking. \u201cUs beasts are far too low for them pretty creatures. She had one look at ya and ran away.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s in <strike>Arry\u2019s</strike><i> Lady Arya\u2019s</i> home, now. There\u2019s no way he can forget how low he is. Gendry shoulders the offending hand away and follows the rest of the men inside. <i>As if I needed a reminder of how low I am. I\u2019ve known that my entire life.</i></p><p><i>//</i></p><p>Leagues away from Winterfell the fingers of winter are tightening their grip. Slowly and surely the grass and trees are stiffening with frost. Jaime squints at the lowering sun. Nightfall is drawing near. He would be worried but it has been more than a sennight since he left Kings Landing behind. The chances of being captured by his sister\u2019s forces weaken with each step his horse takes.</p><p>\u201cYou know, it\u2019s gonna cost you more than before. Now that there\u2019s two queens who\u2019d put your pretty blonde head on a spike.\u201d</p><p><i>You\u2019re wrong. There\u2019s three queens. My father wasn\u2019t wrong when he named Sansa Stark the Key to the North.</i></p><p>Jaime pulls on the reins of his horse and steers him towards an off-road clearing.</p><p><i>I\u2019m only hoping Brienne will stay the hand of her red-haired queen.</i></p><p>\u201cIf I didn\u2019t know any better I\u2019d almost think you cared about me, Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.\u201d</p><p>The mercenary lets out a cackle into the thicket and trees. \u201cOh, I care. You Lannisters always pay your debts.\u201d He unstraps the bundles from his horse. \u201cBut you can only pay them if I keep you alive.\u201d</p><p>Jaime let\u2019s the conversation drop. They\u2019re close to their destination. Two more days and he\u2019ll be able to divest himself of one of the many guilts that taint his conscience.</p><p>//</p><p>Bran drops his hand from the carved face. The world is blurry before it rights itself to the present. It won\u2019t be long, now.</p><p>He watches as a clump of snow crashes to the ground from above. The heart tree\u2019s leaves are heavy, weighed down by Winter\u2019s first true snowfall.</p><p>Like a round of cyvasse, the pieces are all in place.</p><p>The final game has begun.</p><p>//</p><hr></p>",

She was never a patient creature and the crown that rests upon her head only serves to validate her impatience. She is tired of waiting for men. The world would be better off without them, she thinks. They\u2019re all treacherous scum seeking to feed off of the fairer sex. And once their appetite has been satiated they leave in search of something new. </p><p>The throne room is empty save for the Mountain. Qyburn has just left, his message delivered and received. The remaining lords and ladies have already scampered back to their hovels. <i>It\u2019s better to be alone than in bad company. Much better. </i></p><p>In strides Euron Greyjoy. If rumors are to be believed, he\u2019s the last male Greyjoy with a working cock. Cersei thinks the wannabe pirate brags too much about his <i>sword</i>. Of what she\u2019s seen, her prisoner in the dark cells is more of a kraken than both remaining male relatives combined. But that is the lot of women. Their sex will always pull them under. She is the exception.</p><p>A crown and a throne work wonders. A queen is so much more than a woman. A queen is power. And Cersei will burn anyone who stands in her way. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re back. Good. Am I to assume you were successful?\u201d </p><p>Euron Greyjoy tries to saunter towards her. He only succeeds in repulsing her. The weeks he spent away have diluted her memory of him. He is fouler than she remembered. The odor of stagnant ocean water can not be masked by the, rather obvious, perfumes he has brought back from across the Narrow Sea. Even from atop the throne she can smell him.</p><p><i>As if I would ever suffer another man with an ego-complex. </i>Cersei looks towards her shield. <i>The Mountain will snap his neck before his breath ever so much as </i>touches<i> me.</i></p><p>The Mountain strikes out a thick arm to stop his advances. Greyjoy lifts a dark eyebrow and puts his hands up in a mocking gesture of surrender. He doesn\u2019t move any closer. Cersei likes this. Who knew she would one day be able to command men with a simple tilt of her head? The Mountain drops his arm but stays standing next to Euron. </p><p>\u201cYes, my queen,\u201d his leer is more than evident in his voice, \u201cI\u2019ve brought back the Golden Company just as we agreed. Now, I expect to be properly compensated.\u201d </p><p>She peers down at him. He wants to marry her and be her king. She would be an idiot to trust him. There are others who have pledged themselves to her. Others who she can, and has, controlled better. But there may be some use to him, yet.</p><p>Cersei leers back. She is queen, and a lion. She will not be cowed by an irreverent squid. \u201cAh, yes. Your compensation\u2026\u201d</p><p>//</p><p><i>It\u2019s certainly not what I was expecting. Not that I know what I was expecting to begin with but\u2026</i> Dany accepts Jorah\u2019s hand as he helps her dismount the finicky Northern steed. Her eyes wander to Jon who is looking towards Winterfell. <i>Nevermind that. I\u2019m sure it is more inviting, warmer, on the inside. Much like its former king.</i></p><p>\u201cIt is a sight I did not think I would ever see again. You have made one of my greatest dreams possible, my queen.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys turns towards the old bear. She can see true thankfulness in his eyes. It is a homecoming for more than one northerner, today. In the flurry of action she had forgotten that Jorah would most likely be reuniting with family. She is glad one of her oldest supporters will soon fulfill their biggest wish because of her. </p><p>\u201cMy dear friend, it has been a long journey but you are finally back home in the north.\u201d She clasps his arm. \u201cMayhaps the north will become a home of sorts for me as well.\u201d</p><p>Underneath her hand she can feel him tense at her words. She knows her bear holds no love for the wolf that is slowly, but surely, melting the ice around her heart. Jorah\u2019s jealousy is flattering but she knows what she wants. With a smile Daenerys leaves Jorah and walks towards Jon.</p><p>The white landscape and the cold makes her uncomfortable but she will never admit it. What is a little snow and winter wind to a dragon made of fire? Jon remains facing towards Winterfell when she finally arrives at his side. \u201cWe are almost there. I am eager to meet your family, Jon Snow.\u201d</p><p>Jon hums his agreement. </p><p>They\u2019ve stopped to arrange any last minute details before arriving at Winterfell. Her children are to be sent somewhere close to the keep but far away enough to not cause panic. Jon had insisted. She is loathe to part from them but ultimately yields. He probably knows the northerners better than she. Nevertheless, she misses them. She fears to lose them ever since the incident beyond the wall. Her eyes search the sky for Drogon. She can feel his presence. He is still near. </p><p>Tyrion, and Varys are discussing some trivial matters with the Unsullied about what to expect in regards to their welcome. <i>Details, details, details. I\u2019m tired of waiting.</i></p><p>Daenerys touches Jon and gently turns him away from Winterfell and towards her. He moves stiffly in the cold. <i>I will be sure to warm him up later in his Lord\u2019s chambers.</i> \u201cYou have been awfully quiet. More so than usual. Should I be worried?\u201d</p><p>Jon\u2019s eyes slowly warm at her words. The corner of his lips upturn in a reassuring smile. No wonder Jorah is jealous. His worry over her is obvious now. In her very rare moments of worry, or anxiety he is always there to reassure her. She is quite sure he is in love with her. She herself doesn\u2019t love him. Yet. <i>I could. I am in danger of it. I feel it.</i></p><p>\u201cNo. There is nothing to worry about. I will speak with the Northern lords and make them understand that you are here to fight with us.\u201d He pauses to collect his thoughts. \u201cThey will see you for what you are.\u201d</p><p>Those words again. Just like before they light a fire within her. He sees her for what she is. A liberator. A savior. A queen.</p><p><i>His queen.</i> </p><p>The breaker of chains looks up at the last King of the North. He looks like he is holding himself back from a great emotion. <i>He must want to hold me now.</i> Daenerys wouldn\u2019t care but he has been adamant in avoiding any kind of public intimacy for fear of repercussion to their political alliance. She admires his patience and fortitude. As mother of dragons she forgets how it must be for the rest of the world. To always have to care what others think or do. To not take without asking. Always waiting for permission. What a bleak existence that must be. </p><p>A shout from behind breaks their tension. It is time to move again. Jon nods at her and leaves to mount his horse. Daenerys watches his cloak flap behind him like \u00a0black wings. Soon she\u2019ll meet his people. His family. Soon she\u2019ll learn more about the king who gave away his kingdom for love. </p><p><i>For me.</i></p><p><i>//</i></p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s almost here.\u201d Bran says. The low and long sound of a horn interrupts him. \u201cObserve and take in as much as you can. Go.\u201d</p><p>//</p><p>Tyrion had forgotten how utterly dull the North is. <i>Everywhere I look, snow covers everything.</i></p><p>Varys has his hands hidden away, like always, within the confines of his sleeves. The muted colors of his robes only serve to remind him that summer is long gone. Tyrion turns to look outside of the carriage window. They are near Winterfell\u2019s gates. Won\u2019t be long before it all goes to the Seven Hells. The Northern fools are too stubborn to take kindly to a Targaryen queen. He doesn\u2019t have high hopes for this alliance. <i>Not since\u2013</i></p><p>\u201dYou know, your face is doing that thing again.\u201d</p><p>\u201dI\u2019m sorry but I\u2019m afraid you will have to elaborate. My handsome features do many \u2018things\u2019. What exactly are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>Varys looks out of the opposite window. The view is the same. Snow. \u201cYou used to be better at hiding your thoughts, your feelings. Not enough to fool me, of course. But now you\u2019re an open book even an illiterate could read.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion turns to look at Varys. \u201cAnd what do you see on my face, hm? If I\u2019m such an open book, pray, tell me.\u201d</p><p>The imp of Casterly Rock watches the eunuch watch the scenery pass by.</p><p><i>Of course. </i>Now<i> he\u2019s quiet.</i> </p><p>The carriage rolls to a stop. They\u2019ve arrived. \u201cFear, Tyrion. That\u2019s what I see. You are wise to feel that way.\u201d Varys pauses before fully exiting the carriage. \u201cBut a fool to show it.\u201d</p><p>The serving girl leaves the godswood behind her. She picks up her coarse skirts and makes her way to the outside of the keep proper. The king is come back with a Targaryen! Her curiosity makes her run fast and nimble as she weaves her way through the soldiers and serving folk. </p><p>\u201cWatch it, girl. You near ran me over!\u201d</p><p>Anise doesn\u2019t stop. Her hazel eyes drink in everything they can. The horses, the people, the carts. She perches herself atop a stack of empty vegetable crates to get a better view. She anxiously awaits for a sign of dragons in the overcast sky. The Lannister imp is here, as is a bald plump man. She can see them through the small windows of their carriage.</p><p><i>Varys. His name is Varys.</i></p><p>Anise has never met them before. But names are easy to come by. She notices the soldiers are well trained. Even in their strange winter garb they show no signs of discomfort. That must be the Unsullied. </p><p>There is another kind of soldier in the courtyard. They are quite different and seem to be faring worse than the Unsullied. Their ears are rust red and their long black hair swings wildly behind them. There aren\u2019t many of them here. Thirty at most.</p><p><i>Dothraki.</i></p><p>They are speaking a strange mixture of the common tongue and a language Anise has never heard before. Nevertheless, she listens and recognizes a few phrases.</p><p>\u201cCold\u2026Khalessi\u2026Snow\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026Gold\u2026lions\u2026burn\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026food\u2026food\u2026food\u2026\u201d</p><p>Anise turns her attention towards the king. He has finally returned to Winterfell. He\u2019s finally here. </p><p><i>Will he recognize me after all these years? Do I want him to recognize me?</i></p><p>Anise pushes these strange thoughts away. She is a simple serving girl. She has no ties to the king. She is only here to watch and observe.</p><p>The main party and King Jon are soon within the walls of Winterfell. The procession of Unsullied keeps passing by, arranging themselves around the keep. She watches them.</p><p><i>They are too many to house inside. The \u00a0Targaryen girl and her retinue will be housed inside. But what about all her men?</i></p><p>Anise swings her feet and, to pass the time, makes a game of counting how many carts of food and resources she can see.</p><p><i>Five,</i></p><p>Grain.</p><p><i>Ten,</i></p><p>Cloth, animal skins, a few furs.</p><p><i>Fifteen,</i></p><p>Weapons.</p><p><i>Twen\u2014</i></p><p>A screech is the only warning she and the rest of the bystanders receive before everyone scampers away in fear. Anise doesn\u2019t know where her courage comes from but she stands on the crates and bends her head back in awe. </p><p><i>Dragons. They\u2019re real.</i></p><p><i>They\u2019re </i>here<i>.</i></p><p>The dragon flies directly above Winterfell before flying into the mist and fog of the woods. She jumps off the crates. There is much one can learn from being at the right place at the right time. It\u2019s time to leave her perch. Anise looks with wonder at the passing caravan. With wide eyes and a juvenile smile she follows the Targaryen procession into Winterfell\u2019s courtyard.</p><p>//</p><p>It\u2019s cold and the days are getting shorter. Gilly is used to it so she doesn\u2019t complain. Everyone is in a frenzy. A horn of some sort is signaling the arrival of Jon Snow and his aunt. She remembers hearing it an hour or two ago when they had first been spotted by the watchmen. \u00a0Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen are here. Her name sounds funny to Gilly but what does she know of queens and dragons? </p><p>\u201cGilly, come! He\u2019s here!\u201d</p><p>Gilly looks at Sam in mild bemusement. He sounds like a child in his excitement. Gilly adjusts Little Sam on her hip and follows him to the railing that overlooks the courtyard. There is so much noise that Little Sam squirms in curiosity but Gilly strengthens her hold. It wouldn\u2019t do for him to leave her arms. Not with soldiers and dragons in their midst. </p><p>\u201cWhere are the dragons, Sam?\u201d</p><p>His eyes never waver from the action underneath. \u201cEh, I don\u2019t know. Perhaps they\u2019re away from the keep?\u201d</p><p>She has never seen a dragon. But she has seen creatures of ice. She isn\u2019t sure that creatures of fire are any better.</p><p>Gilly sets her sight on the newcomers. A head of white, silverlike hair stands off by the entrance to the castle. She, for Gilly can see her fair features, is flanked by soldiers. They are dressed in black leather with dark, sun-kissed skin she has never seen before. <i>That must be the dragon queen. Then where is Jon Snow\u2026</i></p><p>Gilly finds him. His head of black hair is walking towards Sansa Stark. Gilly inhales her surprise. The Lady opens her arms and holds Jon Snow in a welcoming embrace. In the small amount of time Gilly has been in Winterfell she has noted how restrictive Sansa Stark is with her affection and touch. When she first met her she had thought her to be Winterfell\u2019s queen. Gilly brushes Little Sam\u2019s hair back. She doesn\u2019t think she has ever seen the Lady of Winterfell touch someone so intimately before. </p><p>She wonders where Lady Arya is. If Sam is correct, she was the one Jon Snow would talk about the most during their time at the Night\u2019s Watch. It seems she isn\u2019t here to welcome her cousin home. </p><p>In that moment a terrible sound meets her ears, and makes Little Sam cry. The courtyard is hit by wind and shadow as the sun seems to be momentarily smothered. In the covered walkway Gilly can only see the end of the beast\u2019s tail as it flies overhead. She presses her son closer to her chest.</p><p>\u201cSam! A dragon! They\u2014they\u2019re real!\u201d</p><p>What else could it be if not a dragon?</p><p>There is a change in the air after that small terrifying moment and Gilly focuses on the men and women in the courtyard. She wasn\u2019t the only one scared by the dragon. Common and noble folk alike \u00a0are twisting and turning their heads to see if another dragon will pass by. Lady Sansa acts as if nothing happened but Gilly can see how the blonde lady knight moved closer to her lady.</p><p>\u201c\u2026queen Daenerys Targaryen. I promised I would\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Sam mutters. \u201cOh, no.\u201d</p><p>No one is kneeling in the courtyard. Isn\u2019t it part of their customs? To kneel? She read that somewhere, she is sure of it. But no one is kneeling when Jon Snow introduces his aunt to the people of Winterfell. Gilly is confused. Is he no longer king?</p><p>Little Sam pulls at his father\u2019s cloak until Sam relents and carries him. Daenerys Targaryen walks towards Jon Snow and Sansa Stark. Unlike her soldiers, the queen is dressed in thick white furs that surely keep her warm.</p><p>\u201cWinterfell is yours, your grace.\u201d Sansa Stark\u2019s voice carries in the stillness of the moment. Gilly doesn\u2019t believe her. She has seen this woman care for her castle like Gilly herself cares for Little Sam. Daenerys Targaryen seems pleased, though.</p><p>\u201cIs Winterfell no longer the Starks\u2019? What is going on, Sam?\u201d</p><p>Sam continues to look at Jon Snow as he leads his aunt to the inside of Winterfell.</p><p>\u201cI\u2018m not sure, Gilly. All I know is this complicates everything.\u201d Gilly and Sam watch how the dragon queen\u2019s eyes follow Jon Snow everywhere he goes. \u201cJon, what have you done?\u201d</p><p>//</p><p><i>It\u2019s strange, being here.</i> He hikes his rucksack over his shoulder. <i>I wonder if\u2026</i></p><p>\u201cThis is queen Daenerys Targaryen. I promised I would come back with aid for the fight against the Others.\u201d She begins to walk towards Jon Snow as he introduces her. \u201cIn bringing her to the North I have fulfilled that promise.\u201d</p><p>Her white and red furs make her stand out against the stones, mud, and wood. Sansa Stark seems to lose some of the levity she had upon embracing her brother. He doesn\u2019t blame her. Having a dragon flying above your home without warning and scaring your people <i>is</i> a bit rude. Then again, <i>are</i> there proper courtesies when it comes to dragons?</p><p>The Targaryen girl stops by Jon Snow\u2019s side and faces Sansa Stark. He makes note that no one in the courtyard kneels before the mother of dragons. If the Lady of Winterfell doesn\u2019t kneel neither does its people.</p><p><i>Well, this is awkward.</i></p><p>She doesn\u2019t seem bothered. <i>Or maybe she doesn\u2019t see it as a slight. Considering her and Jon\u2019s\u2014</i></p><p>\u201cWinterfell is yours\u2026\u201d</p><p>A servant squeezes past him and draws his attention away from the scene playing out before them all. His rucksack slides off his shoulder with her movement and thuds to the cold ground.</p><p>\u201cHey, look where you\u2019re going,\u201d he mutters as he bends to pick it up.</p><p>Quick as a whip the little maid turns her blonde head. Her mouth opens when she sees him. Her eyes shift from young innocence to something far too jaded for her age. The girl\u2019s stare makes him feel transparent. </p><p>\u201cWhat? You want to catch flies or something, kid?\u201d</p><p>She looks down at his war hammer before looking back up at him. </p><p>\u201cGendry?\u201d Her voice tilts at the end but it doesn\u2019t sound like a question. She seems certain of who he is.</p><p>\u201cDo I know you?\u201d His eyebrows come together in concentration as he takes a step towards her. </p><p>Before he knows it she\u2019s gone and lost among the Unsullied, Dothraki, and northerners. </p><p>The Hound hits his shoulder with a heavy hand. \u201cCome on, <i>Bull</i>.\u201d His voice is mocking. \u201cUs beasts are far too low for them pretty creatures. She had one look at ya and ran away.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s in <strike>Arry\u2019s</strike><i> Lady Arya\u2019s</i> home, now. There\u2019s no way he can forget how low he is. Gendry shoulders the offending hand away and follows the rest of the men inside. <i>As if I needed a reminder of how low I am. I\u2019ve known that my entire life.</i></p><p><i>//</i></p><p>Leagues away from Winterfell the fingers of winter are tightening their grip. Slowly and surely the grass and trees are stiffening with frost. Jaime squints at the lowering sun. Nightfall is drawing near. He would be worried but it has been more than a sennight since he left Kings Landing behind. The chances of being captured by his sister\u2019s forces weaken with each step his horse takes.</p><p>\u201cYou know, it\u2019s gonna cost you more than before.

She was never a patient creature and the crown that rests upon her head only serves to validate her impatience. She is tired of waiting for men. The world would be better off without them, she thinks. They&rsquo;re all treacherous scum seeking to feed off of the fairer sex. And once their appetite has been satiated they leave in search of something new. </p><p>The throne room is empty save for the Mountain. Qyburn has just left, his message delivered and received. The remaining lords and ladies have already scampered back to their hovels. <i>It&rsquo;s better to be alone than in bad company. Much better. </i></p><p>In strides Euron Greyjoy. If rumors are to be believed, he&rsquo;s the last male Greyjoy with a working cock. Cersei thinks the wannabe pirate brags too much about his <i>sword</i>. Of what she&rsquo;s seen, her prisoner in the dark cells is more of a kraken than both remaining male relatives combined. But that is the lot of women. Their sex will always pull them under. She is the exception.</p><p>A crown and a throne work wonders. A queen is so much more than a woman. A queen is power. And Cersei will burn anyone who stands in her way. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re back. Good. Am I to assume you were successful?&rdquo; </p><p>Euron Greyjoy tries to saunter towards her. He only succeeds in repulsing her. The weeks he spent away have diluted her memory of him. He is fouler than she remembered. The odor of stagnant ocean water can not be masked by the, rather obvious, perfumes he has brought back from across the Narrow Sea. Even from atop the throne she can smell him.</p><p><i>As if I would ever suffer another man with an ego-complex. </i>Cersei looks towards her shield. <i>The Mountain will snap his neck before his breath ever so much as </i>touches<i> me.</i></p><p>The Mountain strikes out a thick arm to stop his advances. Greyjoy lifts a dark eyebrow and puts his hands up in a mocking gesture of surrender. He doesn&rsquo;t move any closer. Cersei likes this. Who knew she would one day be able to command men with a simple tilt of her head? The Mountain drops his arm but stays standing next to Euron. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes, my queen,&rdquo; his leer is more than evident in his voice, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve brought back the Golden Company just as we agreed. Now, I expect to be properly compensated.&rdquo; </p><p>She peers down at him. He wants to marry her and be her king. She would be an idiot to trust him. There are others who have pledged themselves to her. Others who she can, and has, controlled better. But there may be some use to him, yet.</p><p>Cersei leers back. She is queen, and a lion. She will not be cowed by an irreverent squid. &ldquo;Ah, yes. Your compensation&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>//</p><p><i>It&rsquo;s certainly not what I was expecting. Not that I know what I was expecting to begin with but&hellip;</i> Dany accepts Jorah&rsquo;s hand as he helps her dismount the finicky Northern steed. Her eyes wander to Jon who is looking towards Winterfell. <i>Nevermind that. I&rsquo;m sure it is more inviting, warmer, on the inside. Much like its former king.</i></p><p>&ldquo;It is a sight I did not think I would ever see again. You have made one of my greatest dreams possible, my queen.&rdquo;</p><p>Daenerys turns towards the old bear. She can see true thankfulness in his eyes. It is a homecoming for more than one northerner, today. In the flurry of action she had forgotten that Jorah would most likely be reuniting with family. She is glad one of her oldest supporters will soon fulfill their biggest wish because of her. </p><p>&ldquo;My dear friend, it has been a long journey but you are finally back home in the north.&rdquo; She clasps his arm. &ldquo;Mayhaps the north will become a home of sorts for me as well.&rdquo;</p><p>Underneath her hand she can feel him tense at her words. She knows her bear holds no love for the wolf that is slowly, but surely, melting the ice around her heart. Jorah&rsquo;s jealousy is flattering but she knows what she wants. With a smile Daenerys leaves Jorah and walks towards Jon.</p><p>The white landscape and the cold makes her uncomfortable but she will never admit it. What is a little snow and winter wind to a dragon made of fire? Jon remains facing towards Winterfell when she finally arrives at his side. &ldquo;We are almost there. I am eager to meet your family, Jon Snow.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon hums his agreement. </p><p>They&rsquo;ve stopped to arrange any last minute details before arriving at Winterfell. Her children are to be sent somewhere close to the keep but far away enough to not cause panic. Jon had insisted. She is loathe to part from them but ultimately yields. He probably knows the northerners better than she. Nevertheless, she misses them. She fears to lose them ever since the incident beyond the wall. Her eyes search the sky for Drogon. She can feel his presence. He is still near. </p><p>Tyrion, and Varys are discussing some trivial matters with the Unsullied about what to expect in regards to their welcome. <i>Details, details, details. I&rsquo;m tired of waiting.</i></p><p>Daenerys touches Jon and gently turns him away from Winterfell and towards her. He moves stiffly in the cold. <i>I will be sure to warm him up later in his Lord&rsquo;s chambers.</i> &ldquo;You have been awfully quiet. More so than usual. Should I be worried?&rdquo;</p><p>Jon&rsquo;s eyes slowly warm at her words. The corner of his lips upturn in a reassuring smile. No wonder Jorah is jealous. His worry over her is obvious now. In her very rare moments of worry, or anxiety he is always there to reassure her. She is quite sure he is in love with her. She herself doesn&rsquo;t love him. Yet. <i>I could. I am in danger of it. I feel it.</i></p><p>&ldquo;No. There is nothing to worry about. I will speak with the Northern lords and make them understand that you are here to fight with us.&rdquo; He pauses to collect his thoughts. &ldquo;They will see you for what you are.&rdquo;</p><p>Those words again. Just like before they light a fire within her. He sees her for what she is. A liberator. A savior. A queen.</p><p><i>His queen.</i> </p><p>The breaker of chains looks up at the last King of the North. He looks like he is holding himself back from a great emotion. <i>He must want to hold me now.</i> Daenerys wouldn&rsquo;t care but he has been adamant in avoiding any kind of public intimacy for fear of repercussion to their political alliance. She admires his patience and fortitude. As mother of dragons she forgets how it must be for the rest of the world. To always have to care what others think or do. To not take without asking. Always waiting for permission. What a bleak existence that must be. </p><p>A shout from behind breaks their tension. It is time to move again. Jon nods at her and leaves to mount his horse. Daenerys watches his cloak flap behind him like &nbsp;black wings. Soon she&rsquo;ll meet his people. His family. Soon she&rsquo;ll learn more about the king who gave away his kingdom for love. </p><p><i>For me.</i></p><p><i>//</i></p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s almost here.&rdquo; Bran says. The low and long sound of a horn interrupts him. &ldquo;Observe and take in as much as you can. Go.&rdquo;</p><p>//</p><p>Tyrion had forgotten how utterly dull the North is. <i>Everywhere I look, snow covers everything.</i></p><p>Varys has his hands hidden away, like always, within the confines of his sleeves. The muted colors of his robes only serve to remind him that summer is long gone. Tyrion turns to look outside of the carriage window. They are near Winterfell&rsquo;s gates. Won&rsquo;t be long before it all goes to the Seven Hells. The Northern fools are too stubborn to take kindly to a Targaryen queen. He doesn&rsquo;t have high hopes for this alliance. <i>Not since&ndash;</i></p><p>&rdquo;You know, your face is doing that thing again.&rdquo;</p><p>&rdquo;I&rsquo;m sorry but I&rsquo;m afraid you will have to elaborate. My handsome features do many &lsquo;things&rsquo;. What exactly are you talking about?&rdquo;</p><p>Varys looks out of the opposite window. The view is the same. Snow. &ldquo;You used to be better at hiding your thoughts, your feelings. Not enough to fool me, of course. But now you&rsquo;re an open book even an illiterate could read.&rdquo;</p><p>Tyrion turns to look at Varys. &ldquo;And what do you see on my face, hm? If I&rsquo;m such an open book, pray, tell me.&rdquo;</p><p>The imp of Casterly Rock watches the eunuch watch the scenery pass by.</p><p><i>Of course. </i>Now<i> he&rsquo;s quiet.</i> </p><p>The carriage rolls to a stop. They&rsquo;ve arrived. &ldquo;Fear, Tyrion. That&rsquo;s what I see. You are wise to feel that way.&rdquo; Varys pauses before fully exiting the carriage. &ldquo;But a fool to show it.&rdquo;</p><p>The serving girl leaves the godswood behind her. She picks up her coarse skirts and makes her way to the outside of the keep proper. The king is come back with a Targaryen! Her curiosity makes her run fast and nimble as she weaves her way through the soldiers and serving folk. </p><p>&ldquo;Watch it, girl. You near ran me over!&rdquo;</p><p>Anise doesn&rsquo;t stop. Her hazel eyes drink in everything they can. The horses, the people, the carts. She perches herself atop a stack of empty vegetable crates to get a better view. She anxiously awaits for a sign of dragons in the overcast sky. The Lannister imp is here, as is a bald plump man. She can see them through the small windows of their carriage.</p><p><i>Varys. His name is Varys.</i></p><p>Anise has never met them before. But names are easy to come by. She notices the soldiers are well trained. Even in their strange winter garb they show no signs of discomfort. That must be the Unsullied. </p><p>There is another kind of soldier in the courtyard. They are quite different and seem to be faring worse than the Unsullied. Their ears are rust red and their long black hair swings wildly behind them. There aren&rsquo;t many of them here. Thirty at most.</p><p><i>Dothraki.</i></p><p>They are speaking a strange mixture of the common tongue and a language Anise has never heard before. Nevertheless, she listens and recognizes a few phrases.</p><p>&ldquo;Cold&hellip;Khalessi&hellip;Snow&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;Gold&hellip;lions&hellip;burn&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;food&hellip;food&hellip;food&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Anise turns her attention towards the king. He has finally returned to Winterfell. He&rsquo;s finally here. </p><p><i>Will he recognize me after all these years? Do I want him to recognize me?</i></p><p>Anise pushes these strange thoughts away. She is a simple serving girl. She has no ties to the king. She is only here to watch and observe.</p><p>The main party and King Jon are soon within the walls of Winterfell. The procession of Unsullied keeps passing by, arranging themselves around the keep. She watches them.</p><p><i>They are too many to house inside. The &nbsp;Targaryen girl and her retinue will be housed inside. But what about all her men?</i></p><p>Anise swings her feet and, to pass the time, makes a game of counting how many carts of food and resources she can see.</p><p><i>Five,</i></p><p>Grain.</p><p><i>Ten,</i></p><p>Cloth, animal skins, a few furs.</p><p><i>Fifteen,</i></p><p>Weapons.</p><p><i>Twen&mdash;</i></p><p>A screech is the only warning she and the rest of the bystanders receive before everyone scampers away in fear. Anise doesn&rsquo;t know where her courage comes from but she stands on the crates and bends her head back in awe. </p><p><i>Dragons. They&rsquo;re real.</i></p><p><i>They&rsquo;re </i>here<i>.</i></p><p>The dragon flies directly above Winterfell before flying into the mist and fog of the woods. She jumps off the crates. There is much one can learn from being at the right place at the right time. It&rsquo;s time to leave her perch. Anise looks with wonder at the passing caravan. With wide eyes and a juvenile smile she follows the Targaryen procession into Winterfell&rsquo;s courtyard.</p><p>//</p><p>It&rsquo;s cold and the days are getting shorter. Gilly is used to it so she doesn&rsquo;t complain. Everyone is in a frenzy. A horn of some sort is signaling the arrival of Jon Snow and his aunt. She remembers hearing it an hour or two ago when they had first been spotted by the watchmen. &nbsp;Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen are here. Her name sounds funny to Gilly but what does she know of queens and dragons? </p><p>&ldquo;Gilly, come! He&rsquo;s here!&rdquo;</p><p>Gilly looks at Sam in mild bemusement. He sounds like a child in his excitement. Gilly adjusts Little Sam on her hip and follows him to the railing that overlooks the courtyard. There is so much noise that Little Sam squirms in curiosity but Gilly strengthens her hold. It wouldn&rsquo;t do for him to leave her arms. Not with soldiers and dragons in their midst. </p><p>&ldquo;Where are the dragons, Sam?&rdquo;</p><p>His eyes never waver from the action underneath. &ldquo;Eh, I don&rsquo;t know. Perhaps they&rsquo;re away from the keep?&rdquo;</p><p>She has never seen a dragon. But she has seen creatures of ice. She isn&rsquo;t sure that creatures of fire are any better.</p><p>Gilly sets her sight on the newcomers. A head of white, silverlike hair stands off by the entrance to the castle. She, for Gilly can see her fair features, is flanked by soldiers. They are dressed in black leather with dark, sun-kissed skin she has never seen before. <i>That must be the dragon queen. Then where is Jon Snow&hellip;</i></p><p>Gilly finds him. His head of black hair is walking towards Sansa Stark. Gilly inhales her surprise. The Lady opens her arms and holds Jon Snow in a welcoming embrace. In the small amount of time Gilly has been in Winterfell she has noted how restrictive Sansa Stark is with her affection and touch. When she first met her she had thought her to be Winterfell&rsquo;s queen. Gilly brushes Little Sam&rsquo;s hair back. She doesn&rsquo;t think she has ever seen the Lady of Winterfell touch someone so intimately before. </p><p>She wonders where Lady Arya is. If Sam is correct, she was the one Jon Snow would talk about the most during their time at the Night&rsquo;s Watch. It seems she isn&rsquo;t here to welcome her cousin home. </p><p>In that moment a terrible sound meets her ears, and makes Little Sam cry. The courtyard is hit by wind and shadow as the sun seems to be momentarily smothered. In the covered walkway Gilly can only see the end of the beast&rsquo;s tail as it flies overhead. She presses her son closer to her chest.</p><p>&ldquo;Sam! A dragon! They&mdash;they&rsquo;re real!&rdquo;</p><p>What else could it be if not a dragon?</p><p>There is a change in the air after that small terrifying moment and Gilly focuses on the men and women in the courtyard. She wasn&rsquo;t the only one scared by the dragon. Common and noble folk alike &nbsp;are twisting and turning their heads to see if another dragon will pass by. Lady Sansa acts as if nothing happened but Gilly can see how the blonde lady knight moved closer to her lady.</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;queen Daenerys Targaryen. I promised I would&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; Sam mutters. &ldquo;Oh, no.&rdquo;</p><p>No one is kneeling in the courtyard. Isn&rsquo;t it part of their customs? To kneel? She read that somewhere, she is sure of it. But no one is kneeling when Jon Snow introduces his aunt to the people of Winterfell. Gilly is confused. Is he no longer king?</p><p>Little Sam pulls at his father&rsquo;s cloak until Sam relents and carries him. Daenerys Targaryen walks towards Jon Snow and Sansa Stark. Unlike her soldiers, the queen is dressed in thick white furs that surely keep her warm.</p><p>&ldquo;Winterfell is yours, your grace.&rdquo; Sansa Stark&rsquo;s voice carries in the stillness of the moment. Gilly doesn&rsquo;t believe her. She has seen this woman care for her castle like Gilly herself cares for Little Sam. Daenerys Targaryen seems pleased, though.</p><p>&ldquo;Is Winterfell no longer the Starks&rsquo;? What is going on, Sam?&rdquo;</p><p>Sam continues to look at Jon Snow as he leads his aunt to the inside of Winterfell.</p><p>&ldquo;I&lsquo;m not sure, Gilly. All I know is this complicates everything.&rdquo; Gilly and Sam watch how the dragon queen&rsquo;s eyes follow Jon Snow everywhere he goes. &ldquo;Jon, what have you done?&rdquo;</p><p>//</p><p><i>It&rsquo;s strange, being here.</i> He hikes his rucksack over his shoulder. <i>I wonder if&hellip;</i></p><p>&ldquo;This is queen Daenerys Targaryen. I promised I would come back with aid for the fight against the Others.&rdquo; She begins to walk towards Jon Snow as he introduces her. &ldquo;In bringing her to the North I have fulfilled that promise.&rdquo;</p><p>Her white and red furs make her stand out against the stones, mud, and wood. Sansa Stark seems to lose some of the levity she had upon embracing her brother. He doesn&rsquo;t blame her. Having a dragon flying above your home without warning and scaring your people <i>is</i> a bit rude. Then again, <i>are</i> there proper courtesies when it comes to dragons?</p><p>The Targaryen girl stops by Jon Snow&rsquo;s side and faces Sansa Stark. He makes note that no one in the courtyard kneels before the mother of dragons. If the Lady of Winterfell doesn&rsquo;t kneel neither does its people.</p><p><i>Well, this is awkward.</i></p><p>She doesn&rsquo;t seem bothered. <i>Or maybe she doesn&rsquo;t see it as a slight. Considering her and Jon&rsquo;s&mdash;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Winterfell is yours&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>A servant squeezes past him and draws his attention away from the scene playing out before them all. His rucksack slides off his shoulder with her movement and thuds to the cold ground.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, look where you&rsquo;re going,&rdquo; he mutters as he bends to pick it up.</p><p>Quick as a whip the little maid turns her blonde head. Her mouth opens when she sees him. Her eyes shift from young innocence to something far too jaded for her age. The girl&rsquo;s stare makes him feel transparent. </p><p>&ldquo;What? You want to catch flies or something, kid?&rdquo;</p><p>She looks down at his war hammer before looking back up at him. </p><p>&ldquo;Gendry?&rdquo; Her voice tilts at the end but it doesn&rsquo;t sound like a question. She seems certain of who he is.</p><p>&ldquo;Do I know you?&rdquo; His eyebrows come together in concentration as he takes a step towards her. </p><p>Before he knows it she&rsquo;s gone and lost among the Unsullied, Dothraki, and northerners. </p><p>The Hound hits his shoulder with a heavy hand. &ldquo;Come on, <i>Bull</i>.&rdquo; His voice is mocking. &ldquo;Us beasts are far too low for them pretty creatures. She had one look at ya and ran away.&rdquo;</p><p>He&rsquo;s in <strike>Arry&rsquo;s</strike><i> Lady Arya&rsquo;s</i> home, now. There&rsquo;s no way he can forget how low he is. Gendry shoulders the offending hand away and follows the rest of the men inside. <i>As if I needed a reminder of how low I am. I&rsquo;ve known that my entire life.</i></p><p><i>//</i></p><p>Leagues away from Winterfell the fingers of winter are tightening their grip. Slowly and surely the grass and trees are stiffening with frost. Jaime squints at the lowering sun. Nightfall is drawing near. He would be worried but it has been more than a sennight since he left Kings Landing behind. The chances of being captured by his sister&rsquo;s forces weaken with each step his horse takes.</p><p>&ldquo;You know, it&rsquo;s gonna cost you more than before. Now that there&rsquo;s two queens who&rsquo;d put your pretty blonde head on a spike.&rdquo;</p><p><i>You&rsquo;re wrong. There&rsquo;s three queens.

        "body": "<p><b><br/></b>This week, I tweeted a \u2018Bold prediction\u2019 that tbh wasn\u2019t much of a bold prediction. The basic premise was the Starks come out on top. The tweet read like this:<br/><i>Bold prediction that I will at some point write a tumblr meta about. Bran gets the NK, Arya kills Daenerys, Sansa takes out Tyrion, and Jon valonqars the sh*t out of Cersei. Just like that all their enemies are gone. #Starks4theWin #Starklings</i><br/></p><p><b>Bran v\u2019s Night King</b></p><p>This is the point I am the least sure about. But in the end, I do think Bran will play a pivotal role in taking out the Night King and the White Walkers. Jon will come in with the huge assist along with Arya. I fully expect them to have some big kills.</p><p><b>Arya v\u2019s Daenerys</b></p><p>A few other people in the fandom have mentioned this or talked about it. Arya has long been about killing Cersei, the Queen. Except for last season when Lannister soldiers asked her where she was going she said \u2018To kill the Queen.\u2019 A great twist to this would be that she eventually kills or plays a huge role in taking out Daenerys. She may come to a place where her skills are better used to protect her family. <br/>I could also see Daenerys being substituted in for Drogon in this case. I would love an Eowyn like moment where Arya takes off whatever face she is wearing and slays the beast. The show even gave us misdirects with the recent Arya staring in awe at dragons footage.\u00a0</p><p><b>Sansa v\u2019s Tyrion</b></p><p>This is the point I am most confident about. Sansa really needs to get Tyrion out of the way if she wants to live her life. The show made a bit of a mess of this. However, in the books, she is still very much married to Tyrion. She very much didn\u2019t want to be married to him and still doesn\u2019t. A higher authority could give her an annulment. Except for Jon just made the lovely decision to pledge to Daenerys. And Daenerys would have no interest in annulling a marriage between Tyrion and Sansa. What would better tie the North and the Westerlands to her cause then maintaining this marriage. See when Jon gave up his crown (sorta&hellip;he never actually got down on his knee\u2026) he gave up his authority in the North outside of commanding the armies. Sansa has the real power in Winterfell, now. The check on that. The check on Northern independence is Tyrion re-asserting their marriage. So yea Sansa really has to get out of it. This whole scenario may not play out in the show, we may get hints of it instead. Since the show has to end the same as the books, Sansa still has to take out Tyrion, the reasoning just might shift a bit.</p><p>**Also, I fully believe Tyrion is the real \u2018giant\u2019 Sansa slays in the castle made of snow. Again in the show, she may do it somewhere else. Tyrion is the only character referred to as a giant among men etc. etc. Littlefinger is a red herring for this prophecy imo.</p><p><b>Jon v\u2019s Cersei</b></p><p>As I said in my tweet, I believe Jon will valonqar the shit out of Cersei. I\u2019ve written about this is <a href=\"https://castaliareed.tumblr.com/post/182427278385/could-jon-really-marry-cersei-in-season-8\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://castaliareed.tumblr.com/post/169096688840/the-younger-more-beautiful-queen-the-valonqar\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://castaliareed.tumblr.com/post/174930749380/tinfoil-and-crack-whos-the-valonqar\">here</a>. The basic argument goes a bit like this, the use of the term hints at someone with valyrian ancestry. Or someone who would become known by that term which means people might attribute valyrian ancestry to them. The term also means little sibling or brother. This makes it an ideal term to refer to Jon after the parent reveal because he is the younger of Rhaegar\u2019s children. He is the younger Aegon. The added bonus is he is the younger King in the North, too. This makes more sense in the books where (f)Aegon, Rhaegar\u2019s older son and the older Aegon because Jon will be named Aegon in the books, plays a big role. I mean seriously guys can\u2019t you just see it&hellip;Jon will become know as Aegon the Valonqar.</p><p>Another point in this theories favor is that Jon is the only character we see get in close and lose his sh*t on people. He punched Ramsey repeatedly and uncontrollably. He choked out Littlefinger. In the books, he is constantly clutching and unclutching his sword hand to the point that it is a nervous habit. He\u2019s just waiting to wrap his hands around someone\u2019s neck.</p><p>And what sets him off like this? People who have harmed or mention Sansa. It\u2019s pretty safe to say that Sansa is on the very short list of two of being the younger more beautiful queen. If Cersei threatens her in any way&hellip;well&hellip;Jon is very likely to lose his mind. This is becoming even more likely because there are serious rumors out there that Cersei kidnaps Sansa. Yes, this theory relates to Jonsa and a possible Jonsa ending but it is not limited to that.\u00a0</p><p>Generally, the \u2018pack\u2019 kills together. They will all help each other take out the various other parties. We\u2019ve already seen this with Jon and Sansa in the BoTB and later when Sansa, Arya, and Bran execute Littlefinger. \u00a0But each Starkling takes the lead on one of these end game deaths. There are other noteworthy deaths that our Starks may have a hand in (The Mountain, Euron, etc). But the ones mentioned here are the big ones. The Starks are the center of this story. They are our erstwhile heroes. This story is about them coming into their own. About them perhaps starting a new dynasty. To do that they are going to have to take a few people out first.</p>",

Bran gets the NK, Arya kills Daenerys, Sansa takes out Tyrion, and Jon valonqars the sh*t out of Cersei. Just like that all their enemies are gone. #Starks4theWin #Starklings</i><br /></p><p><b>Bran v&rsquo;s Night King</b></p><p>This is the point I am the least sure about. But in the end, I do think Bran will play a pivotal role in taking out the Night King and the White Walkers. Jon will come in with the huge assist along with Arya. I fully expect them to have some big kills.</p><p><b>Arya v&rsquo;s Daenerys</b></p><p>A few other people in the fandom have mentioned this or talked about it. Arya has long been about killing Cersei, the Queen. Except for last season when Lannister soldiers asked her where she was going she said &lsquo;To kill the Queen.&rsquo; A great twist to this would be that she eventually kills or plays a huge role in taking out Daenerys. She may come to a place where her skills are better used to protect her family. <br />I could also see Daenerys being substituted in for Drogon in this case. I would love an Eowyn like moment where Arya takes off whatever face she is wearing and slays the beast. The show even gave us misdirects with the recent Arya staring in awe at dragons footage.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Sansa v&rsquo;s Tyrion</b></p><p>This is the point I am most confident about. Sansa really needs to get Tyrion out of the way if she wants to live her life. The show made a bit of a mess of this. However, in the books, she is still very much married to Tyrion. She very much didn&rsquo;t want to be married to him and still doesn&rsquo;t. A higher authority could give her an annulment. Except for Jon just made the lovely decision to pledge to Daenerys. And Daenerys would have no interest in annulling a marriage between Tyrion and Sansa. What would better tie the North and the Westerlands to her cause then maintaining this marriage. See when Jon gave up his crown (sorta&hellip;he never actually got down on his knee&hellip;) he gave up his authority in the North outside of commanding the armies. Sansa has the real power in Winterfell, now. The check on that. The check on Northern independence is Tyrion re-asserting their marriage. So yea Sansa really has to get out of it. This whole scenario may not play out in the show, we may get hints of it instead. Since the show has to end the same as the books, Sansa still has to take out Tyrion, the reasoning just might shift a bit.</p><p>**Also, I fully believe Tyrion is the real &lsquo;giant&rsquo; Sansa slays in the castle made of snow. Again in the show, she may do it somewhere else. Tyrion is the only character referred to as a giant among men etc. etc. Littlefinger is a red herring for this prophecy imo.</p><p><b>Jon v&rsquo;s Cersei</b></p><p>As I said in my tweet, I believe Jon will valonqar the shit out of Cersei. I&rsquo;ve written about this is <a href=\"https://castaliareed.tumblr.com/post/182427278385/could-jon-really-marry-cersei-in-season-8\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://castaliareed.tumblr.com/post/169096688840/the-younger-more-beautiful-queen-the-valonqar\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://castaliareed.tumblr.com/post/174930749380/tinfoil-and-crack-whos-the-valonqar\">here</a>. The basic argument goes a bit like this, the use of the term hints at someone with valyrian ancestry. Or someone who would become known by that term which means people might attribute valyrian ancestry to them. The term also means little sibling or brother. This makes it an ideal term to refer to Jon after the parent reveal because he is the younger of Rhaegar&rsquo;s children. He is the younger Aegon. The added bonus is he is the younger King in the North, too. This makes more sense in the books where (f)Aegon, Rhaegar&rsquo;s older son and the older Aegon because Jon will be named Aegon in the books, plays a big role. I mean seriously guys can&rsquo;t you just see it&hellip;Jon will become know as Aegon the Valonqar.</p><p>Another point in this theories favor is that Jon is the only character we see get in close and lose his sh*t on people. He punched Ramsey repeatedly and uncontrollably. He choked out Littlefinger. In the books, he is constantly clutching and unclutching his sword hand to the point that it is a nervous habit. He&rsquo;s just waiting to wrap his hands around someone&rsquo;s neck.</p><p>And what sets him off like this? People who have harmed or mention Sansa. It&rsquo;s pretty safe to say that Sansa is on the very short list of two of being the younger more beautiful queen. If Cersei threatens her in any way&hellip;well&hellip;Jon is very likely to lose his mind. This is becoming even more likely because there are serious rumors out there that Cersei kidnaps Sansa. Yes, this theory relates to Jonsa and a possible Jonsa ending but it is not limited to that.&nbsp;</p><p>Generally, the &lsquo;pack&rsquo; kills together. They will all help each other take out the various other parties. We&rsquo;ve already seen this with Jon and Sansa in the BoTB and later when Sansa, Arya, and Bran execute Littlefinger. &nbsp;But each Starkling takes the lead on one of these end game deaths. There are other noteworthy deaths that our Starks may have a hand in (The Mountain, Euron, etc). But the ones mentioned here are the big ones. The Starks are the center of this story. They are our erstwhile heroes. This story is about them coming into their own. About them perhaps starting a new dynasty. To do that they are going to have to take a few people out first.</p>",
