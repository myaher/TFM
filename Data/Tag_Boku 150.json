Where have you been all day?&rdquo;, Izuku finally noticed you, his gaze fixating on you instead of the brunette next to him.</p><p>Before you could answer, he was gone again, yanked away by the same girl that had been troubling you for some time now, </p><p>&ldquo;Deku, I have to tell you something real quick.&rdquo;</p><p>And with that they were gone.</p><p>As you slumped your body onto the chair, arms and head on the table, Todoroki spoke up,</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s failing at being a good boyfriend, I see.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do not worry, (l/n)! I&rsquo;m sure everything will work out just fine!&rdquo;, Iida rubbed his hand on your back from the chair to the left of you.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe you should text him if you can&rsquo;t catch him to talk to in person.&rdquo;, the dual haired boy suggested, continuing to slurp his cold soba right after. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried, but he won&rsquo;t respond.&rdquo;, you threw your head back and leaned against the back of the chair, sighing. You needed some time alone, as you felt the tears welling up in your eyes, just like they had been every night now, so you stood up with quiet words before leaving,</p><p>&ldquo;Please excuse me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;(l/n)&hellip;&rdquo;, your friends at the table whispered after you were gone.</p><p>You sprinted towards the exit that Midoriya and Uraraka took and you immediately regretted that decision.

Sadly that plan backfired, making your eyes overflow with tears. Your legs couldn&rsquo;t hold you much longer, so they gave in, leaving you in a sitting position against a wall.</p><p>&ldquo;(y/n)? Did someone hurt you?&rdquo;, a certain boy asked innocently, only to anger you to an even bigger extent. You didn&rsquo;t even need to look up at him to know who it was. It seemed like he must&rsquo;ve heard you pass by moments ago for him to even come here.</p><p>&ldquo;Midoriya, if you love Uraraka, why would you start dating me?
