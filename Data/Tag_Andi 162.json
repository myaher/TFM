Like the whole issue of if he ever did manipulate Cyrus (which is kinda sad if he did) was kinda quickly dropped which didn't feel natural. I guess him signing the basketball was what that was supposed to be?",

It looked like one of those small towns in the movies that you would see. A tight-knit community where everyone knows each other and everyone knows each others drama. For Badriya, She just didn\u2019t want to leave another home again. In Northpond, Driya finally found a friend. More than that, a best friend in Marty. Some who just got who she was. Understood her and her personality. Someone who knew exactly what to say just by the look on her face. Driya didn\u2019t know if she would find that in Shadyside.\u00a0</p><p>As more and more houses started to pass by, Driya pondered what she should do. Should she fight against this move as much as she could. Get bad grades, not make any friends and not sign up for any clubs. Just go through the motions. School, homework, and sleep over and over and over again. An ugly feeling settled in her stomach at the thought of such a dreary life. Driya\u2019s never been that type of person. Despite moving so much, Driya had gotten the hang of adjusting to new environments. She\u2019s seen what her mom\u2019s job demanded of her and she recognized that if her mom had any say they wouldn\u2019t have moved as frequently as they did. That\u2019s why no matter where they moved, Driya made it a point to not make it harder on her mom. To try and make friends, adjust and settle down so her mom didn\u2019t have to worry about her.\u00a0</p><p>As the suns rays hit her face, Driya decide to act on the advice Marty had texted to her that morning to heart,\u00a0</p><p><b><i>Shadyside may be a new place but trust me when I say this, Driya. I know you, there is no way you won\u2019t find new life there. I believe in you!</i></b></p><p>Driya\u2019s mom, Ahaana, took a second to glance at her daughter\u2019s face in the window and saw a smile that hasn\u2019t been there since they left in the wee hours of the morning. Ahaana released the breath she was holding. She anticipated more of a fight about moving away from Northpond, moving away from Badriya\u2019s friend Marty. It lifted weights from her shoulders seeing her daughters smile as they pulled up to their new home in Shadyside.</p><hr><p>\u201cMOM WHERE\u2019S MY SUPER SUIT!!\u201d Driya, holding back laughter, yelled down to her mom who was in the kitchen making breakfast.</p><p>\u201cPretty sure I didn\u2019t give birth to a super but if your looking for your lucky boots, there in the hallway closet!\u201d Ahaana yells back, smiling at her daughters antics.\u00a0</p><p>Ahaana continues to fix some food for her kid before she starts her first day of high school. She hears stomps coming down the stairs right as she finishes up. When Driya comes around the corner, shes dancing around in her new outfit for the first day. Driya chose a pair of ripped jeans, a cropped grey hoodie, red timberland&rsquo;s and a faux leather snap back. Her hair was in a ponytail through the back of the hat. Driya took her headphones out and plopped down at the kitchen table.</p><p>\u201cHey mom!\u201d Driya grabs her lunch and drops it in her backpack.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey you look happy. Really like the outfit choice.\u201d Ahaana places a smoothie bowl in front of Driya before grabbing her own and sitting down across from her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019m stepping into a new situation. I had to wear my super suit. Marty approved.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Ahaana nods along.\u00a0\u201cAh yes I heard Marty this morning. Doesn\u2019t he have school to attend, like you?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah but we just comparing outfits. He wanted my opinion because there is this girl he\u2019s trying to impress back in Northpond.\u201d Driya and Ahaana continue to eat their shared breakfast. Soon enough, Driya finished up, rinsed her bowl and placed it in the sink. She walked over and grabbed her water bottle out of the refrigerator and headed towards the front door. As she was about to walk out, Ahaana calls her name.</p><p>\u201cYeah mom?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cRemember Pat\u2019s kid is gonna meet you to show you around. Ok?\u201d Ahaana questions.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes, mom, I got it. Can I go? If I don\u2019t leave now, I\u2019m gonna miss the bus.\u201d Her mother opens her arms and gestures to Driya. Driya rolls her eyes before being embraced by her mother.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still so sorry for moving around again but I\u2019m praying that this is the last time. I am so proud of you. You\u2019re gonna do great.\u201d Ahaana releases Driya and smooths her hat down on her head. Driya smiles up at her mom</p><p>\u201cThanks mom. I\u2019ll text you about how my days going when I get to lunch.\u201d Her mom nods and Driya finally walks out of the door. She gets to the end of the driveway when she turns around. Driya flashes a peace sign to her mom before heading down the sidewalk. Walking toward her bus stop, Driya blasts Champion by Fall Out Boy. Her mind drifts to Marty and how he\u2019s doing. This was a song on their shared playlist. Just then she gets a text. She opens up the messenger app to see a text from Marty. It\u2019s lyrics to the song she was listening to.\u00a0</p><p><b>You can do this!!</b></p><p><b><i>If I can live through this</i></b></p><p><b><i>I can do anything</i></b></p><p>Driya smiles down at her phone but she doesn\u2019t realize she\u2019s about to bump into someone. Said someone grabs her and the touch startles Driya out of her Fall Out Boy filled bubble. Said person, a boy, had overly gelled hair, a basketball hoodie and really beautiful eyes.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that. You we\u2019re about to bump into me.\u201d He removes his hands from Driya\u2019s shoulders.\u00a0\u201cAre you new here? Not a lot of kids have this bus stop.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUmm Yeah! Yeah I\u2019m new. I just moved to the vacant house down the street. My name\u2019s Driya and you are?\u201d Driya sticks her hand out and the boy takes it with a smile.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m TJ\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Driya and TJ ended up talking on the bus the entire way to school. TJ bragging about his basketball skills and Driya promising to show him up. There was nonstop chatter from both of them as the bus pulled up in the front of the school.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo do you know what your first class is? Mine is&hellip;.\u201d TJ voice faded into the background of her mind as they approached the entrance to her new school. It was massive. The front entrance had this open quad area that went down one fight of stairs. Tons of kids were everywhere, hugging old friends, making promises of lunch later, posing for pictures and checking schedules. From the outside, Jefferson High\u2019s building was in the shape of a T. The view of the school made everything real again. The move, leaving Marty, starting over. All of a sudden, the emotions and anxiety Driya was facing were pushed back into the forefront of her mind. Driya took several deep breaths before she heard TJ calling her name.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDriya. Driya!!\u201d TJ shook her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cH huh, What\u2019s up?\u201d Dryia stopped walking and took a second to reacquaint herself to reality again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou spaced out. You ok?\u201d The two starting walking toward the entrance again albeit at a slower pace.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. It just the reality of starting at a new school and trying to make new friends just hit me like a tidal wave. It basically took me a year to make the one friend I have that goes to my old school. How long will it be here before I make more?\u201d Dryia stopped at the top of the staircase. Dryia looked around and saw the ton of strange, unknown faces running and walking around TJ and her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell, You wont have to wait long.\u201d TJ sticks out his hand with a smile.\u00a0\u201cHi I\u2019m TJ, your new best friend. You can tell your old friend, they\u2019ve been replaced.\u201d Dryia laughs before shaking his hand. TJ wraps his arm around her shoulders and they begin their descent to the front of the school where two girls and a guy are talking.\u00a0</p><hr><p>\u201cAre you sure I look ok?\u201d Cyrus asked once again while gesturing to his outfit. Both Andi and Buffy rolled their eyes before Andi speaks up.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFor the FIFTEENTH TIME, yes you look great. TJ is gonna love it.\u201d Andi brings out her phone seeing a text from Jonah on the screen. \u201dJonah said his bus is running a little late so we have a little more time to wait on&hellip;ah Dryia right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah that\u2019s her name but I haven\u2019t spotted her yet. My mom told me that she\u2019ll be wearing a hat and her hair is dyed.\u201d Buffy continues to search around the quad.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOOO what\u2019s her hair look like? I\u2019ve been thinking about letting Bex dye my hair.\u201d Andi moves closer to Buffy as fellow GHC member pulls up the picture on her phone.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh My God its GORGEOUS!!\u201d Andi exclaims.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus crowds around Buffy\u2019s other side to see the picture. Said picture of Badriya is recent. Driya is posing, blowing a kiss to the camera, with her hair held in a ponytail by her hand. Her straight black hair was as long as a waterfall on the back of her head. The tips of Dirya\u2019s hair were dyed in cascading colors, from dark green to blue to sliver on the very edge.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUh love it!! But it looks like a ton to manage. I have a hard enough time with the inch I have already.\u201d Both girls laugh at Cyrus when he notices something out of the corner of his eye. His eyebrows lifted.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey guys, Isn\u2019t that TJ?\u201d Cyrus points to the top of the stairs that TJ was walking down with an unknown girl. She had on ripped, black skinny jeans, A cropped grey hoodie, red boots and a snap back. Cyrus, Andi and Buffy\u2019s heads all tilted to the side at the same time staring at the strange pair. TJ saw the group staring and waved with a smile.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUmm We all have it confirmed that TJ only has one sister right. That sister is Amber Kippen. So if he has one sister, who is that.\u201d Cyrus and the girls continue to stare at them as TJ and this new girl inch closer and closer to them.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey guys, How was your summer?\u201d TJ wraps Cyrus in a one sided hug that Cyrus didnt respond to. All of the GHC\u2019s attention was on the girl standing on TJ right side.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDude you saw us yesterday. Matter of fact, you spent most of the summer with us!\u201d\u00a0 Buffy gave a befuddled look.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAlright Driscoll, the question just felt appropriate to the situation. No need for the hostility.\u201d TJ adjusted his backpack.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSoo TJ, after that failed attempt at small talk, Who is this?\u201d Andi glances over at the girl with her eyes.</p><p>\u201cOH Yeah! So guys this is Badriya. She just moved on my block and is starting school here.\u201d TJ introduces Driya but She only gives a wave.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWait your name is Badriya? You wouldn\u2019t be happen to be looking for a girl named Buffy right?\u201d Andi remarks.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Driya clears her throat.\u00a0\u201cYeah I am. Do you know her?\u201d Driya asks.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe does. Hi, I\u2019m Buffy.\u201d Buffy sticks her hand out. Driya gives a look of surprise.</p><p>\u201cOMG I\u2019m am so sorry for not recognizing you. Hi, its nice to meet you. Your mom, Pat really talked you up to my mom.\u201d Driya shakes her hand.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like my mom. So, these are my friends Andi and Cyrus.\u201d Both give Driya a wave which she returns in kind.\u00a0\u201cWe were gonna wait for our other friend, Jonah but he\u2019s running late and we should probably head in for the festivities.\u201d Buffy waggles her eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cFestivities?\u201d Driya looks confused.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah, the first day of school at Jefferson is usually a soft open kind of day. The students get to come in and traverse the school. Next, we all get called in to an assembly where the principal gives a speech and any announcements. Then, everyone goes to all their classes, including clubs, for twenty minutes each. After all that, we all go home.\u201d Cyrus explains.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWow that\u2019s super cool. They didn\u2019t have any of this at my old school.\u201d Driya utters.</p><p>Andi checks the time and throws her hands in the air in exasperation.\u00a0\u201cJonah\u2019s bus is taking to long. He can catch up with us when he gets here. Lets head in.\u201d As the group moves into the school. Andi grabs Driya\u2019s elbow and entangles it with her arm.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo how did you choose those colors for your hair? They are gorgeous!\u201d Andi asks and Driya launches into a explanation. Suddenly, all the apprehension she felt walking up to the school faded away. It looked like this new school was gonna be a good fit for Driya.\u00a0</p>",

            "comment": "<p><h2>New Life In Shadyside Chapter 1: Moving In</h2><p>It wasn\u2019t like she hated Shadyside. It was actually pretty cool. It looked like one of those small towns in the movies that you would see. A tight-knit community where everyone knows each other and everyone knows each others drama. For Badriya, She just didn\u2019t want to leave another home again. In Northpond, Driya finally found a friend. More than that, a best friend in Marty. Some who just got who she was. Understood her and her personality. Someone who knew exactly what to say just by the look on her face. Driya didn\u2019t know if she would find that in Shadyside.\u00a0</p><p>As more and more houses started to pass by, Driya pondered what she should do. Should she fight against this move as much as she could. Get bad grades, not make any friends and not sign up for any clubs. Just go through the motions. School, homework, and sleep over and over and over again. An ugly feeling settled in her stomach at the thought of such a dreary life. Driya\u2019s never been that type of person. Despite moving so much, Driya had gotten the hang of adjusting to new environments. She\u2019s seen what her mom\u2019s job demanded of her and she recognized that if her mom had any say they wouldn\u2019t have moved as frequently as they did. That\u2019s why no matter where they moved, Driya made it a point to not make it harder on her mom. To try and make friends, adjust and settle down so her mom didn\u2019t have to worry about her.\u00a0</p><p>As the suns rays hit her face, Driya decide to act on the advice Marty had texted to her that morning to heart,\u00a0</p><p><b><i>Shadyside may be a new place but trust me when I say this, Driya.

It looked like one of those small towns in the movies that you would see. A tight-knit community where everyone knows each other and everyone knows each others drama. For Badriya, She just didn\u2019t want to leave another home again. In Northpond, Driya finally found a friend. More than that, a best friend in Marty. Some who just got who she was. Understood her and her personality. Someone who knew exactly what to say just by the look on her face. Driya didn\u2019t know if she would find that in Shadyside.\u00a0</p><p>As more and more houses started to pass by, Driya pondered what she should do. Should she fight against this move as much as she could. Get bad grades, not make any friends and not sign up for any clubs. Just go through the motions. School, homework, and sleep over and over and over again. An ugly feeling settled in her stomach at the thought of such a dreary life. Driya\u2019s never been that type of person. Despite moving so much, Driya had gotten the hang of adjusting to new environments. She\u2019s seen what her mom\u2019s job demanded of her and she recognized that if her mom had any say they wouldn\u2019t have moved as frequently as they did. That\u2019s why no matter where they moved, Driya made it a point to not make it harder on her mom. To try and make friends, adjust and settle down so her mom didn\u2019t have to worry about her.\u00a0</p><p>As the suns rays hit her face, Driya decide to act on the advice Marty had texted to her that morning to heart,\u00a0</p><p><b><i>Shadyside may be a new place but trust me when I say this, Driya. I know you, there is no way you won\u2019t find new life there. I believe in you!</i></b></p><p>Driya\u2019s mom, Ahaana, took a second to glance at her daughter\u2019s face in the window and saw a smile that hasn\u2019t been there since they left in the wee hours of the morning. Ahaana released the breath she was holding. She anticipated more of a fight about moving away from Northpond, moving away from Badriya\u2019s friend Marty. It lifted weights from her shoulders seeing her daughters smile as they pulled up to their new home in Shadyside.</p><hr><p>\u201cMOM WHERE\u2019S MY SUPER SUIT!!\u201d Driya, holding back laughter, yelled down to her mom who was in the kitchen making breakfast.</p><p>\u201cPretty sure I didn\u2019t give birth to a super but if your looking for your lucky boots, there in the hallway closet!\u201d Ahaana yells back, smiling at her daughters antics.\u00a0</p><p>Ahaana continues to fix some food for her kid before she starts her first day of high school. She hears stomps coming down the stairs right as she finishes up. When Driya comes around the corner, shes dancing around in her new outfit for the first day. Driya chose a pair of ripped jeans, a cropped grey hoodie, red timberland\u2019s and a faux leather snap back. Her hair was in a ponytail through the back of the hat. Driya took her headphones out and plopped down at the kitchen table.</p><p>\u201cHey mom!\u201d Driya grabs her lunch and drops it in her backpack.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey you look happy. Really like the outfit choice.\u201d Ahaana places a smoothie bowl in front of Driya before grabbing her own and sitting down across from her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019m stepping into a new situation. I had to wear my super suit. Marty approved.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Ahaana nods along.\u00a0\u201cAh yes I heard Marty this morning. Doesn\u2019t he have school to attend, like you?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah but we just comparing outfits. He wanted my opinion because there is this girl he\u2019s trying to impress back in Northpond.\u201d Driya and Ahaana continue to eat their shared breakfast. Soon enough, Driya finished up, rinsed her bowl and placed it in the sink. She walked over and grabbed her water bottle out of the refrigerator and headed towards the front door. As she was about to walk out, Ahaana calls her name.</p><p>\u201cYeah mom?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cRemember Pat\u2019s kid is gonna meet you to show you around. Ok?\u201d Ahaana questions.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes, mom, I got it. Can I go? If I don\u2019t leave now, I\u2019m gonna miss the bus.\u201d Her mother opens her arms and gestures to Driya. Driya rolls her eyes before being embraced by her mother.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still so sorry for moving around again but I\u2019m praying that this is the last time. I am so proud of you. You\u2019re gonna do great.\u201d Ahaana releases Driya and smooths her hat down on her head. Driya smiles up at her mom</p><p>\u201cThanks mom. I\u2019ll text you about how my days going when I get to lunch.\u201d Her mom nods and Driya finally walks out of the door. She gets to the end of the driveway when she turns around. Driya flashes a peace sign to her mom before heading down the sidewalk. Walking toward her bus stop, Driya blasts Champion by Fall Out Boy. Her mind drifts to Marty and how he\u2019s doing. This was a song on their shared playlist. Just then she gets a text. She opens up the messenger app to see a text from Marty. It\u2019s lyrics to the song she was listening to.\u00a0</p><p><b>You can do this!!</b></p><p><b><i>If I can live through this</i></b></p><p><b><i>I can do anything</i></b></p><p>Driya smiles down at her phone but she doesn\u2019t realize she\u2019s about to bump into someone. Said someone grabs her and the touch startles Driya out of her Fall Out Boy filled bubble. Said person, a boy, had overly gelled hair, a basketball hoodie and really beautiful eyes.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that. You we\u2019re about to bump into me.\u201d He removes his hands from Driya\u2019s shoulders.\u00a0\u201cAre you new here? Not a lot of kids have this bus stop.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUmm Yeah! Yeah I\u2019m new. I just moved to the vacant house down the street. My name\u2019s Driya and you are?\u201d Driya sticks her hand out and the boy takes it with a smile.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m TJ\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Driya and TJ ended up talking on the bus the entire way to school. TJ bragging about his basketball skills and Driya promising to show him up. There was nonstop chatter from both of them as the bus pulled up in the front of the school.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo do you know what your first class is? Mine is\u2026.\u201d TJ voice faded into the background of her mind as they approached the entrance to her new school. It was massive. The front entrance had this open quad area that went down one fight of stairs. Tons of kids were everywhere, hugging old friends, making promises of lunch later, posing for pictures and checking schedules. From the outside, Jefferson High\u2019s building was in the shape of a T. The view of the school made everything real again. The move, leaving Marty, starting over. All of a sudden, the emotions and anxiety Driya was facing were pushed back into the forefront of her mind. Driya took several deep breaths before she heard TJ calling her name.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDriya. Driya!!\u201d TJ shook her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cH huh, What\u2019s up?\u201d Dryia stopped walking and took a second to reacquaint herself to reality again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou spaced out. You ok?\u201d The two starting walking toward the entrance again albeit at a slower pace.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. It just the reality of starting at a new school and trying to make new friends just hit me like a tidal wave. It basically took me a year to make the one friend I have that goes to my old school. How long will it be here before I make more?\u201d Dryia stopped at the top of the staircase. Dryia looked around and saw the ton of strange, unknown faces running and walking around TJ and her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell, You wont have to wait long.\u201d TJ sticks out his hand with a smile.\u00a0\u201cHi I\u2019m TJ, your new best friend. You can tell your old friend, they\u2019ve been replaced.\u201d Dryia laughs before shaking his hand. TJ wraps his arm around her shoulders and they begin their descent to the front of the school where two girls and a guy are talking.\u00a0</p><hr><p>\u201cAre you sure I look ok?\u201d Cyrus asked once again while gesturing to his outfit. Both Andi and Buffy rolled their eyes before Andi speaks up.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFor the FIFTEENTH TIME, yes you look great. TJ is gonna love it.\u201d Andi brings out her phone seeing a text from Jonah on the screen. \u201dJonah said his bus is running a little late so we have a little more time to wait on\u2026ah Dryia right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah that\u2019s her name but I haven\u2019t spotted her yet. My mom told me that she\u2019ll be wearing a hat and her hair is dyed.\u201d Buffy continues to search around the quad.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOOO what\u2019s her hair look like? I\u2019ve been thinking about letting Bex dye my hair.\u201d Andi moves closer to Buffy as fellow GHC member pulls up the picture on her phone.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh My God its GORGEOUS!!\u201d Andi exclaims.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus crowds around Buffy\u2019s other side to see the picture. Said picture of Badriya is recent. Driya is posing, blowing a kiss to the camera, with her hair held in a ponytail by her hand. Her straight black hair was as long as a waterfall on the back of her head. The tips of Dirya\u2019s hair were dyed in cascading colors, from dark green to blue to sliver on the very edge.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUh love it!! But it looks like a ton to manage. I have a hard enough time with the inch I have already.\u201d Both girls laugh at Cyrus when he notices something out of the corner of his eye. His eyebrows lifted.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey guys, Isn\u2019t that TJ?\u201d Cyrus points to the top of the stairs that TJ was walking down with an unknown girl. She had on ripped, black skinny jeans, A cropped grey hoodie, red boots and a snap back. Cyrus, Andi and Buffy\u2019s heads all tilted to the side at the same time staring at the strange pair. TJ saw the group staring and waved with a smile.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUmm We all have it confirmed that TJ only has one sister right. That sister is Amber Kippen. So if he has one sister, who is that.\u201d Cyrus and the girls continue to stare at them as TJ and this new girl inch closer and closer to them.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey guys, How was your summer?\u201d TJ wraps Cyrus in a one sided hug that Cyrus didnt respond to. All of the GHC\u2019s attention was on the girl standing on TJ right side.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDude you saw us yesterday. Matter of fact, you spent most of the summer with us!\u201d\u00a0 Buffy gave a befuddled look.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAlright Driscoll, the question just felt appropriate to the situation. No need for the hostility.\u201d TJ adjusted his backpack.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSoo TJ, after that failed attempt at small talk, Who is this?\u201d Andi glances over at the girl with her eyes.</p><p>\u201cOH Yeah! So guys this is Badriya. She just moved on my block and is starting school here.\u201d TJ introduces Driya but She only gives a wave.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWait your name is Badriya? You wouldn\u2019t be happen to be looking for a girl named Buffy right?\u201d Andi remarks.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Driya clears her throat.\u00a0\u201cYeah I am. Do you know her?\u201d Driya asks.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe does. Hi, I\u2019m Buffy.\u201d Buffy sticks her hand out. Driya gives a look of surprise.</p><p>\u201cOMG I\u2019m am so sorry for not recognizing you. Hi, its nice to meet you. Your mom, Pat really talked you up to my mom.\u201d Driya shakes her hand.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like my mom. So, these are my friends Andi and Cyrus.\u201d Both give Driya a wave which she returns in kind.\u00a0\u201cWe were gonna wait for our other friend, Jonah but he\u2019s running late and we should probably head in for the festivities.\u201d Buffy waggles her eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cFestivities?\u201d Driya looks confused.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah, the first day of school at Jefferson is usually a soft open kind of day. The students get to come in and traverse the school. Next, we all get called in to an assembly where the principal gives a speech and any announcements. Then, everyone goes to all their classes, including clubs, for twenty minutes each. After all that, we all go home.\u201d Cyrus explains.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWow that\u2019s super cool. They didn\u2019t have any of this at my old school.\u201d Driya utters.</p><p>Andi checks the time and throws her hands in the air in exasperation.\u00a0\u201cJonah\u2019s bus is taking to long. He can catch up with us when he gets here. Lets head in.\u201d As the group moves into the school. Andi grabs Driya\u2019s elbow and entangles it with her arm.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo how did you choose those colors for your hair? They are gorgeous!\u201d Andi asks and Driya launches into a explanation. Suddenly, all the apprehension she felt walking up to the school faded away. It looked like this new school was gonna be a good fit for Driya.\u00a0</p></p>",

TJ saw the group staring and waved with a smile.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Umm We all have it confirmed that TJ only has one sister right. That sister is Amber Kippen. So if he has one sister, who is that.&rdquo; Cyrus and the girls continue to stare at them as TJ and this new girl inch closer and closer to them.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey guys, How was your summer?&rdquo; TJ wraps Cyrus in a one sided hug that Cyrus didnt respond to. All of the GHC&rsquo;s attention was on the girl standing on TJ right side.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Dude you saw us yesterday. Matter of fact, you spent most of the summer with us!&rdquo;&nbsp; Buffy gave a befuddled look.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Alright Driscoll, the question just felt appropriate to the situation. No need for the hostility.&rdquo; TJ adjusted his backpack.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Soo TJ, after that failed attempt at small talk, Who is this?&rdquo; Andi glances over at the girl with her eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;OH Yeah! So guys this is Badriya. She just moved on my block and is starting school here.&rdquo; TJ introduces Driya but She only gives a wave.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait your name is Badriya? You wouldn&rsquo;t be happen to be looking for a girl named Buffy right?&rdquo; Andi remarks.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hmm.&rdquo; Driya clears her throat.&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah I am. Do you know her?&rdquo; Driya asks.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;She does. Hi, I&rsquo;m Buffy.&rdquo; Buffy sticks her hand out. Driya gives a look of surprise.</p><p>&ldquo;OMG I&rsquo;m am so sorry for not recognizing you. Hi, its nice to meet you. Your mom, Pat really talked you up to my mom.&rdquo; Driya shakes her hand.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;That sounds like my mom. So, these are my friends Andi and Cyrus.&rdquo; Both give Driya a wave which she returns in kind.&nbsp;&ldquo;We were gonna wait for our other friend, Jonah but he&rsquo;s running late and we should probably head in for the festivities.&rdquo; Buffy waggles her eyebrows.</p><p>&ldquo;Festivities?&rdquo; Driya looks confused.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, the first day of school at Jefferson is usually a soft open kind of day. The students get to come in and traverse the school. Next, we all get called in to an assembly where the principal gives a speech and any announcements. Then, everyone goes to all their classes, including clubs, for twenty minutes each. After all that, we all go home.&rdquo; Cyrus explains.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Wow that&rsquo;s super cool. They didn&rsquo;t have any of this at my old school.&rdquo; Driya utters.</p><p>Andi checks the time and throws her hands in the air in exasperation.&nbsp;&ldquo;Jonah&rsquo;s bus is taking to long. He can catch up with us when he gets here. Lets head in.&rdquo; As the group moves into the school. Andi grabs Driya&rsquo;s elbow and entangles it with her arm.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;So how did you choose those colors for your hair? They are gorgeous!&rdquo; Andi asks and Driya launches into a explanation. Suddenly, all the apprehension she felt walking up to the school faded away. It looked like this new school was gonna be a good fit for Driya.&nbsp;</p></p>",
