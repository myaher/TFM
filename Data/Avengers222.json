He was well aware that his Captain America suit, despite its convenience in battle, was the most impractical thing to wear while walking through the tundra. Though he was absolutely freezing, Steve knew that he couldn\u2019t forsake this particular mission. He had spent decades in the ice. A few more hours couldn\u2019t hurt him now. Not to mention, he had a special friend who may have faced the same icy fate; someone who hopefully had survived the same way he had.<b><br/></b></p><p>\tThe first thing Steve had remembered upon waking up after years of thawing was Bucky\u2019s face when he fell off the side of the train. He wished he could have returned to the frigid, abandoned Hydra facility earlier, but the battle of New York kept him painfully busy. Now that he had time, Steve caught the first plane and began his search. </p><p>Hours had passed since Steve had last been in a warm room, but he could do this all day. Time continued to pass slowly and painfully, the frigid wind biting at his face and numbing his fingers. The cold was simply torturous. Sure the punch of an enemy or a bullet wound hurt, but the relentless blowing and biting of the cold winds possessed a far more malevolent temperament and were simply inescapable. \u00a0Steve Rogers was no milquetoast coward. He would brave the cold or die trying (though he had been recently questioning his mortality). </p><p>Finally, the snow began to raise in certain places, creating the snow covered outlines of an abandoned train track. Steve\u2019s chest filled with both the warmth of reaching his destination and the chilling dread that he\u2019d have to return empty-handed. Breathing deeply, he followed the train-tracks until he reached a snowy, rugged precipice. Looking over the painfully familiar tracks, his breath caught in his throat. It was a long, long fall. Ever so slowly, he climbed down the cliff-side, using his inhuman strength to stop him from plummeting into the snowy valley. The descent was difficult due to his numb fingers and dwindling strength. Still, Steve made it to the bottom, running on the hopes that he\u2019d be reunited with Bucky. Slowly he dragged his feet over the the bank of the icy river, searching for the outline of a body. His search from the bank futile, Steve began to wade into the water, the cold quickly becoming unbearable. Frustration began to bubble up, sending Steve thrashing through the water, travelling further and further downstream. </p><p>By the time Steve realized that he would have to return without Bucky, he was beginning to feel very warm, something he was thankful for. All he wanted was to curl up on the side of the river and take a nice nap. Maybe Bucky would be waiting for him then. Or maybe even Peggy. Of course. He owed Peggy a dance. When was it again? Oh yes, that weekend. It would be best if he took a nap now so he\u2019d be rested for later. Nodding to himself, he stumbled out of the river and fell supine on the snowy ground. So warm. So very warm. </p><p><i><br/></i></p><p><i>Get up</i>. A commanding, British voice said, sounding awfully far away.<i> Get up. You\u2019re not supposed to die of hypothermia.

The man pushed him back down, placing the \u00a0blankets Steve had previously thrown off over his shoulders again. </p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Steve choked out, clearing his throat.</p><p>\u201cOh, so you don\u2019t recognize me?\u201d The old man chuckled again. \u201cWell I guess I didn\u2019t age quite as well as you did, Rogers, but you could at least try to remember your old pal Dugan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been that long.\u201d Steve whispered. </p><p>\u201cHey, I think I look pretty good for my age!\u201d Dugan retaliated, leaning against his metal walker. </p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t find Bucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s fretting in the afterlife about how his little friend is risking his life again. You should be dead anyway. I don\u2019t even know how you\u2019re alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe neither.\u201d Steve sighed. He lay on Dugan\u2019s warm bed, waiting for the feeling to return to his limbs before he grabbed a parka and set off into the snow again, headed back to New York, empty handed.</p>",

Unfortunately, Bucky\u2019s last known location is the freezing tundra.</b></p><p><i>Hypothermia</i></p><p>Steve sighed forlornly, his breath visible in the frigid climate. He was well aware that his Captain America suit, despite its convenience in battle, was the most impractical thing to wear while walking through the tundra. Though he was absolutely freezing, Steve knew that he couldn\u2019t forsake this particular mission. He had spent decades in the ice. A few more hours couldn\u2019t hurt him now. Not to mention, he had a special friend who may have faced the same icy fate; someone who hopefully had survived the same way he had.<b><br></b></p><p>\tThe first thing Steve had remembered upon waking up after years of thawing was Bucky\u2019s face when he fell off the side of the train. He wished he could have returned to the frigid, abandoned Hydra facility earlier, but the battle of New York kept him painfully busy. Now that he had time, Steve caught the first plane and began his search. </p><p>Hours had passed since Steve had last been in a warm room, but he could do this all day. Time continued to pass slowly and painfully, the frigid wind biting at his face and numbing his fingers. The cold was simply torturous. Sure the punch of an enemy or a bullet wound hurt, but the relentless blowing and biting of the cold winds possessed a far more malevolent temperament and were simply inescapable. \u00a0Steve Rogers was no milquetoast coward. He would brave the cold or die trying (though he had been recently questioning his mortality). </p><p>Finally, the snow began to raise in certain places, creating the snow covered outlines of an abandoned train track. Steve\u2019s chest filled with both the warmth of reaching his destination and the chilling dread that he\u2019d have to return empty-handed. Breathing deeply, he followed the train-tracks until he reached a snowy, rugged precipice. Looking over the painfully familiar tracks, his breath caught in his throat. It was a long, long fall. Ever so slowly, he climbed down the cliff-side, using his inhuman strength to stop him from plummeting into the snowy valley. The descent was difficult due to his numb fingers and dwindling strength. Still, Steve made it to the bottom, running on the hopes that he\u2019d be reunited with Bucky. Slowly he dragged his feet over the the bank of the icy river, searching for the outline of a body. His search from the bank futile, Steve began to wade into the water, the cold quickly becoming unbearable. Frustration began to bubble up, sending Steve thrashing through the water, travelling further and further downstream. </p><p>By the time Steve realized that he would have to return without Bucky, he was beginning to feel very warm, something he was thankful for. All he wanted was to curl up on the side of the river and take a nice nap. Maybe Bucky would be waiting for him then. Or maybe even Peggy. Of course. He owed Peggy a dance. When was it again? Oh yes, that weekend. It would be best if he took a nap now so he\u2019d be rested for later. Nodding to himself, he stumbled out of the river and fell supine on the snowy ground. So warm.
