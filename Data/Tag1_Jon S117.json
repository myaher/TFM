What\u2019s been only days felt like months. The Night King predicted that the living armies would be unforgiving and so he had half of his army wait beyond the Wall. So when there appeared to be signs of stopping, when Daenerys believed they have won, there would be a second wave of the undead arriving in the next day or so. The Night King waited for this window when the living would be worn out and cut down to size. Now that the living had defeated his first wave of the dead, Bran could finally see what his true plan was all along.</p><p>\u201cIt was a trap. A diversion. He has a second wave of the dead coming this way. They will be here tomorrow morning. He wanted to wait for us to grow tired before he sent the rest of his army out to us.\u201d<br/></p><p>It appeared that all was lost. Everyone stood around the war table with defeat in their eyes. Daenerys slumped back in her chair, exhausted and draining of hope. When she bothered to spare a glance in your direction, you didn\u2019t so much as blink. You had been sitting in the same chair, staring into the fireplace for hours now, never moving, never responding to anything her family said to her.</p><p>Daenerys couldn\u2019t convince you to fight anymore. You have already given up. You had already spent hours out in the empty battlefields, trying to cling onto hope&hellip; trying, and failing to find your brother.</p><p>But there was no sign of Jon. Every part of you knew that your twin was gone, along with the part of you that kept the two of you bonded, connected in both mind and soul. Your heart told you Jon was dead, and you felt the rest of your body shut down and die with him.</p><p>Daenerys reached over and took your hand in hers, but neither did you hold her back or even look up from the fireplace. You became unresponsive and unmoving, practically dead to the world yourself. Even though your family mourns for Jon, they tried pressing on so that maybe they could survive another war.\u00a0</p><p>Daenerys tried to listen as a tearstained Sansa and a broken down Arya tried to come up with a battle strategy. Both Stark sisters were trying to be strong and strike hope back into everyone\u2019s hearts. They came up with a plan to have the newly won Greyjoy fleet bring the remaining of the North\u2019s women and children under ten years of age to Essos while they finished the war. Everyone knew they couldn\u2019t bring the women and children south where Cersei would be waiting, so this was the only option.</p><p>\u201cIf anything happens,\u201d Daenerys looks towards Yara and Theon, both looking smaller and broken since they defeated their uncle,\u00a0\u201cIf Winterfell falls, take the woman and children to Meereen instead for a more permanent home. Tell Daario Naharis of the Second Sons that Daenerys Stormborn sent you.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t go until you\u2019ve received word from Westeros that the Dead have won,\u201d Sansa added,\u00a0\u201cWait for a raven to come if we&ndash;\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWhen,\u201d Arya corrected.<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>When</i> we win. So that you know when to travel back.\u201d<br/></p><p>The plan seemed simple enough and the Lords of the North appeared to have hope in winning this war again, even without their King in the North.</p><p>~~~~~~~~~</p><p>The next day had to be the longest day of your entire life. Too weak to go back out there fighting, Daenerys had you remain in Winterfell with her, Tyrion, and Sansa. The Mother of Dragons herself had injured her arm from flying on top of Drogon during their last battle, so the Queen was grounded and her dragons were flying aimlessly in the air, trying to desperately take down Verserion without their mother to guide them.\u00a0</p><p>Everyone was beyond the walls of the keep, fighting to their last breath and dying with the great honor of protecting their home. Or that\u2019s what they believed. You knew it would be a fruitless death. Without Jon, this war was pointless.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace!\u201d<br/></p><p>Daenerys sighed in relief to see her oldest friend, Jorah Mormont, still alive from the battle. He came back to give her a report and his smile was wider than she has ever seen in the years she\u2019s known him.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s wonderful news, Khaleesi! Word is spreading throughout the battlefield. The dead are withering and Jon Snow is among the fighting ranks again!\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sansa gasped when words failed both you and Daenerys.<br/></p><p>\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d Tyrion exclaimed.<br/></p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s terribly wounded, but alive! I saw him out there! Beyond the hill!\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cY/n?\u201d Sansa questioned when she noticed you racing down the stairs off the wall, her heart now screaming to stop you,\u00a0\u201cY/N! Where are you going?? Come back! Y/n, please! You\u2019ll die out there! Come back!\u201d<br/></p><p>But you refused, taking two steps at a time and throwing off your fur cloak before running to the nearest horse. Swinging your leg over, you jump onto the steed\u2019s back and grip the reins. You only spare a glance at your family, locking violet eyes with Daenerys before harshly kicking the horse\u2019s sides and galloping out of the front gates of Winterfell.</p><p>When you disappeared into the fight, Daenerys shouting orders at Jorah to send men out to follow you. During the chaos, Tyrion noticed Sansa in the corner of his eye. He watched as she walked down the stairs, watching the front gates with fear in her eyes. As she reached the ground, she knelt down to take your fur cloak from the mud. Wiping off the muck, her hands started to shake while staring down at the Stark symbol she embroidered into the leather.</p><p>~~~~~~~~~</p><p>Meanwhile, you were racing through the battlefield without a second glance. Your horse stomped over anything in its path while your eyes frantically searched for the familiar mop of thick, curly, entangled dark hair.</p><p>Coming up to the growing hill of bodies and blood, you could see, far out in the distance a group of men fighting the dead back to back, never letting the circle break. If one man fell, they would quickly burn the body and fill in the hole. Squinting your eyes, heart pounding in your ears, you could see one man being dragged away from the circle by a white walker, but quickly cuts it down and shatters it to pieces with their Valyrian steel sword.</p><p>\u201cJOOON!\u201d You called out to him, your voice croaking after not talking for so long.</p><p>He only spared a glance when he heard his sister\u2019s voice scream out his name, eyes widening before he started fighting harder against the dead so he could try to run to you.</p><p>You kick your horse\u2019s sides again, willing the beast to run even faster, seeing more of Jon\u2019s features now that you were drawing closer. He heaved his sword over his head, clearly exhausted and barely able to swing his weapon. He fought and fought until his arms grew tired and heavy, then he dropped his sword somewhere and started using his fists in slow, excruciatingly painful swings.\u00a0</p><p>Looking up again, he sees how close you are now and simply pushes a skeleton out of his way to get to you.</p><p>\u201cCome on!\u201d You encourage with a desperate look in your eye, reaching out with your arm and your horse draws closer.<br/></p><p>Jon trudges forward, tripping on a few bodies before pushing himself up again, reaching out with his arm.</p><p>Time slows down, your breath and heartbeat were all you could hear in your ears, stretching your arm out so much you felt as though your shoulder would pop.</p><p>Before you could blink, you felt Jon\u2019s arm grab yours and with all your might, you scream in pain and pull him up onto your horse in one swift movement. Once he was placed on the saddle behind you, you turn your horse around and race back towards Winterfell.</p><p>You hear Jon groan behind you, and without even looking, you knew he was in bad shape. You practically broke your horse into making it run faster towards the keep, praying you would make it in time.</p><p>Your heart almost stops beating when you see the front gate slowly starting to close in the distance, and you lean forward to try and get your horse to gallop faster.</p><p>\u201cY/n&hellip;\u201d Jon groaned in pain,\u00a0\u201cWe won\u2019t make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll make it,\u201d you snap, shouting at your horse when it staggered to catch its breath.</p><p>The gate was still closing, faster than you liked to see. You want to scream at them to hold the gates opened, but you knew they wouldn\u2019t hear you, not in time at least. You were so close now you could see what was beyond the gate. You could see the courtyard and the wounded being tended to. You could see Sansa\u2019s hair.</p><p>You could breathe a sigh of relief as your horse just makes into the crack of the front gates. You made it.</p><p>But your horse collapsed at its knees. Exhausted and possibly half dead, your horse gave in and fell into the ground of the courtyard, causing you and Jon to tumble off and crash into the mud. You screamed out when you landed on your arm, clutching it in pain while trying to breathe again. You were certain your arm and a few ribs were broken.\u00a0</p><p>Despite your pain, you began to crawl towards Jon, faintly hearing your sister scream in the background. People were gathering all around, trying to help you stand but your swipe them away, just wanting to reach your brother. You slap your hand onto him once you get to him, pulling yourself to sit up and rolling him onto his back, sighing in relief that he was still breathing,\u00a0\u201cJon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey&hellip;\u201d he grumbled, coughing on what could only be blood while trying to smile, his hand reaching up and grabbing your uninjured one, \u201cWe made it. You were right.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cDid you ever doubt me?\u201d You laugh slightly as Daenerys races over, kneeling on the other side of Jon and taking his other hand, crying in relief that the two of you were okay.<br/></p><p>Now that you had time, you finally look down to inspect Jon\u2019s wounds, and you felt the blood eave your face at the sight. He had an arrow broken off in his hip and guts were almost spilling out of his stomach. He was covered in grime from head to toe, a big gash lying just over his eye. How could he have possibly still been fighting out there half dead like this?!</p><p>\u201cSOMEONE GET SAMWELL TARLY!\u201d You screamed out the order,\u00a0\u201cTELL HIM HIS KING IS WOUNDED!\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cY/n, stop,\u201d Jon whispered,\u00a0\u201cListen to me&hellip;\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cSomeone, just grab a maester!\u201d You kept ordering around at the people standing about to watch the scene,\u00a0\u201cAnyone! PLEASE! Save him!\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cListen to me, Y/n,\u201d Jon coughed out more sternly this time, causing you to look back down with tears running down your face,<br/></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find someone, Jon. Don\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll be alright&hellip;\u201d<br/></p><p>He tried to smile, his lips quivering as he tried to breathe,\u00a0\u201cNot this time.\u201d</p><p>Your lip quivered as well, but it was more so from trying to hold back your sobs as your broken hand trailed over his hair, \u201cI went out there to save you&hellip;\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou did. You saved me from dying out there, among the bodies of my friends and enemies. You saved me from dying on the bloodsoaked ground. You saved me so that I may die surrounded by my family, here in Winterfell.\u201d<br/></p><p>He coughs again, this time looking around to see Sansa now kneeling by his head, stroking his hair with you while she silently cried. He could see a part of Bran\u2019s wheelchair somewhere behind his sister, but couldn\u2019t see his brother\u2019s face. He looks over at Daenerys and smiles, his fingers trailing over her cheek in an attempt to wipe her tears away. He wished Arya was here with them, but she was most likely still out there, fighting what remained of the Dead army,\u00a0\u201cSend word to Arya. Tell her to kill the Night King. Kill the Night King and the rest of the army will fall. It\u2019s a task I only trust her to do so.\u201d</p><p>Sansa nods for Daenerys, breath shaking while trying to hold in her cries,\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ll win, Jon. I promise.\u201d</p><p>He smiles before looking up at the sky, blinking slowly before letting out a huge sigh. When he opened his eyes again, they were distant, far away in another world as he croaked out,\u00a0\u201cY/n&hellip;\u201d</p><p>You lean over more to catch his gaze, trying to smile,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m right here.\u201d</p><p><b>\u201cI miss moments like this more than anything&hellip;\u201d</b><br/></p><p>\u201cLike what, Jon?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou and me. It felt like it was just us for a long time. We couldn\u2019t sit at the table among the rest of the Starks. We had to sit alone, together, on the other far side of the room where Catelyn couldn\u2019t see us. Do you&hellip; do you think if she had known about our mother&hellip; would she have loved us like her own?\u201d<br/></p><p>You sniff back your tears and nod,\u00a0\u201cI have no doubt in my mind we would have known what a mother\u2019s love would have been like.\u201d</p><p>His smile was wider this time, and you saw something you haven\u2019t seen in years. You saw a younger Jon Snow, with no scars and no horrors behind his eyes. For a moment, he looked like the young Jon Snow before he left for the Night\u2019s Watch.<br/></p><p>\u201cY/n, there you are,\u201d he muttered, his voice sounded different and more&hellip; joyful. It brought you to confusion until he spoke again, shattering any pieces of your heart that was left,\u00a0\u201cI had a dream, dear sister. I dreamt I joined the Night\u2019s Watch and became Lord Commander. I dreamt about becoming King in the North. The very best, it made our father proud. I dreamt about dragons and direwolves and silver-haired queens. I dreamt about a long night and six years where I couldn\u2019t see you or the rest of our siblings. It was terrible.\u201d<br/></p><p>You shush him, gripping his hand even tighter,\u00a0\u201cIt was just a dream, brother.\u201d</p><p>He smiled before closing his eyes&hellip; never to open them again.</p><p>~~~~~~~~~</p><p><b>Please don\u2019t forget to like, reblog, and follow!

What\u2019s been only days felt like months. The Night King predicted that the living armies would be unforgiving and so he had half of his army wait beyond the Wall. So when there appeared to be signs of stopping, when Daenerys believed they have won, there would be a second wave of the undead arriving in the next day or so. The Night King waited for this window when the living would be worn out and cut down to size. Now that the living had defeated his first wave of the dead, Bran could finally see what his true plan was all along.</p><p>\u201cIt was a trap. A diversion. He has a second wave of the dead coming this way. They will be here tomorrow morning. He wanted to wait for us to grow tired before he sent the rest of his army out to us.\u201d<br></p><p>It appeared that all was lost. Everyone stood around the war table with defeat in their eyes. Daenerys slumped back in her chair, exhausted and draining of hope. When she bothered to spare a glance in your direction, you didn\u2019t so much as blink. You had been sitting in the same chair, staring into the fireplace for hours now, never moving, never responding to anything her family said to her.</p><p>Daenerys couldn\u2019t convince you to fight anymore. You have already given up. You had already spent hours out in the empty battlefields, trying to cling onto hope\u2026 trying, and failing to find your brother.</p><p>But there was no sign of Jon. Every part of you knew that your twin was gone, along with the part of you that kept the two of you bonded, connected in both mind and soul. Your heart told you Jon was dead, and you felt the rest of your body shut down and die with him.</p><p>Daenerys reached over and took your hand in hers, but neither did you hold her back or even look up from the fireplace. You became unresponsive and unmoving, practically dead to the world yourself. Even though your family mourns for Jon, they tried pressing on so that maybe they could survive another war.\u00a0</p><p>Daenerys tried to listen as a tearstained Sansa and a broken down Arya tried to come up with a battle strategy. Both Stark sisters were trying to be strong and strike hope back into everyone\u2019s hearts. They came up with a plan to have the newly won Greyjoy fleet bring the remaining of the North\u2019s women and children under ten years of age to Essos while they finished the war. Everyone knew they couldn\u2019t bring the women and children south where Cersei would be waiting, so this was the only option.</p><p>\u201cIf anything happens,\u201d Daenerys looks towards Yara and Theon, both looking smaller and broken since they defeated their uncle,\u00a0\u201cIf Winterfell falls, take the woman and children to Meereen instead for a more permanent home. Tell Daario Naharis of the Second Sons that Daenerys Stormborn sent you.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t go until you\u2019ve received word from Westeros that the Dead have won,\u201d Sansa added,\u00a0\u201cWait for a raven to come if we\u2013\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhen,\u201d Arya corrected.<br></p><p>\u201c<i>When</i> we win. So that you know when to travel back.\u201d<br></p><p>The plan seemed simple enough and the Lords of the North appeared to have hope in winning this war again, even without their King in the North.</p><p>~~~~~~~~~</p><p>The next day had to be the longest day of your entire life. Too weak to go back out there fighting, Daenerys had you remain in Winterfell with her, Tyrion, and Sansa. The Mother of Dragons herself had injured her arm from flying on top of Drogon during their last battle, so the Queen was grounded and her dragons were flying aimlessly in the air, trying to desperately take down Verserion without their mother to guide them.\u00a0</p><p>Everyone was beyond the walls of the keep, fighting to their last breath and dying with the great honor of protecting their home. Or that\u2019s what they believed. You knew it would be a fruitless death. Without Jon, this war was pointless.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace!\u201d<br></p><p>Daenerys sighed in relief to see her oldest friend, Jorah Mormont, still alive from the battle. He came back to give her a report and his smile was wider than she has ever seen in the years she\u2019s known him.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s wonderful news, Khaleesi! Word is spreading throughout the battlefield. The dead are withering and Jon Snow is among the fighting ranks again!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sansa gasped when words failed both you and Daenerys.<br></p><p>\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d Tyrion exclaimed.<br></p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s terribly wounded, but alive! I saw him out there! Beyond the hill!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cY/n?\u201d Sansa questioned when she noticed you racing down the stairs off the wall, her heart now screaming to stop you,\u00a0\u201cY/N! Where are you going?? Come back! Y/n, please! You\u2019ll die out there! Come back!\u201d<br></p><p>But you refused, taking two steps at a time and throwing off your fur cloak before running to the nearest horse. Swinging your leg over, you jump onto the steed\u2019s back and grip the reins. You only spare a glance at your family, locking violet eyes with Daenerys before harshly kicking the horse\u2019s sides and galloping out of the front gates of Winterfell.</p><p>When you disappeared into the fight, Daenerys shouting orders at Jorah to send men out to follow you. During the chaos, Tyrion noticed Sansa in the corner of his eye. He watched as she walked down the stairs, watching the front gates with fear in her eyes. As she reached the ground, she knelt down to take your fur cloak from the mud. Wiping off the muck, her hands started to shake while staring down at the Stark symbol she embroidered into the leather.</p><p>~~~~~~~~~</p><p>Meanwhile, you were racing through the battlefield without a second glance. Your horse stomped over anything in its path while your eyes frantically searched for the familiar mop of thick, curly, entangled dark hair.</p><p>Coming up to the growing hill of bodies and blood, you could see, far out in the distance a group of men fighting the dead back to back, never letting the circle break.

Don\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll be alright\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>He tried to smile, his lips quivering as he tried to breathe,\u00a0\u201cNot this time.\u201d</p><p>Your lip quivered as well, but it was more so from trying to hold back your sobs as your broken hand trailed over his hair, \u201cI went out there to save you\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou did.

What\u2019s been only days felt like months. The Night King predicted that the living armies would be unforgiving and so he had half of his army wait beyond the Wall. So when there appeared to be signs of stopping, when Daenerys believed they have won, there would be a second wave of the undead arriving in the next day or so. The Night King waited for this window when the living would be worn out and cut down to size. Now that the living had defeated his first wave of the dead, Bran could finally see what his true plan was all along.</p><p>\u201cIt was a trap. A diversion. He has a second wave of the dead coming this way. They will be here tomorrow morning. He wanted to wait for us to grow tired before he sent the rest of his army out to us.\u201d<br></p><p>It appeared that all was lost. Everyone stood around the war table with defeat in their eyes. Daenerys slumped back in her chair, exhausted and draining of hope. When she bothered to spare a glance in your direction, you didn\u2019t so much as blink. You had been sitting in the same chair, staring into the fireplace for hours now, never moving, never responding to anything her family said to her.</p><p>Daenerys couldn\u2019t convince you to fight anymore. You have already given up. You had already spent hours out in the empty battlefields, trying to cling onto hope\u2026 trying, and failing to find your brother.</p><p>But there was no sign of Jon. Every part of you knew that your twin was gone, along with the part of you that kept the two of you bonded, connected in both mind and soul. Your heart told you Jon was dead, and you felt the rest of your body shut down and die with him.</p><p>Daenerys reached over and took your hand in hers, but neither did you hold her back or even look up from the fireplace. You became unresponsive and unmoving, practically dead to the world yourself. Even though your family mourns for Jon, they tried pressing on so that maybe they could survive another war.\u00a0</p><p>Daenerys tried to listen as a tearstained Sansa and a broken down Arya tried to come up with a battle strategy. Both Stark sisters were trying to be strong and strike hope back into everyone\u2019s hearts. They came up with a plan to have the newly won Greyjoy fleet bring the remaining of the North\u2019s women and children under ten years of age to Essos while they finished the war. Everyone knew they couldn\u2019t bring the women and children south where Cersei would be waiting, so this was the only option.</p><p>\u201cIf anything happens,\u201d Daenerys looks towards Yara and Theon, both looking smaller and broken since they defeated their uncle,\u00a0\u201cIf Winterfell falls, take the woman and children to Meereen instead for a more permanent home. Tell Daario Naharis of the Second Sons that Daenerys Stormborn sent you.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t go until you\u2019ve received word from Westeros that the Dead have won,\u201d Sansa added,\u00a0\u201cWait for a raven to come if we\u2013\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhen,\u201d Arya corrected.<br></p><p>\u201c<i>When</i> we win. So that you know when to travel back.\u201d<br></p><p>The plan seemed simple enough and the Lords of the North appeared to have hope in winning this war again, even without their King in the North.</p><p>~~~~~~~~~</p><p>The next day had to be the longest day of your entire life. Too weak to go back out there fighting, Daenerys had you remain in Winterfell with her, Tyrion, and Sansa. The Mother of Dragons herself had injured her arm from flying on top of Drogon during their last battle, so the Queen was grounded and her dragons were flying aimlessly in the air, trying to desperately take down Verserion without their mother to guide them.\u00a0</p><p>Everyone was beyond the walls of the keep, fighting to their last breath and dying with the great honor of protecting their home. Or that\u2019s what they believed. You knew it would be a fruitless death. Without Jon, this war was pointless.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace!\u201d<br></p><p>Daenerys sighed in relief to see her oldest friend, Jorah Mormont, still alive from the battle. He came back to give her a report and his smile was wider than she has ever seen in the years she\u2019s known him.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s wonderful news, Khaleesi! Word is spreading throughout the battlefield. The dead are withering and Jon Snow is among the fighting ranks again!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sansa gasped when words failed both you and Daenerys.<br></p><p>\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d Tyrion exclaimed.<br></p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s terribly wounded, but alive! I saw him out there! Beyond the hill!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cY/n?\u201d Sansa questioned when she noticed you racing down the stairs off the wall, her heart now screaming to stop you,\u00a0\u201cY/N! Where are you going?? Come back! Y/n, please! You\u2019ll die out there! Come back!\u201d<br></p><p>But you refused, taking two steps at a time and throwing off your fur cloak before running to the nearest horse. Swinging your leg over, you jump onto the steed\u2019s back and grip the reins. You only spare a glance at your family, locking violet eyes with Daenerys before harshly kicking the horse\u2019s sides and galloping out of the front gates of Winterfell.</p><p>When you disappeared into the fight, Daenerys shouting orders at Jorah to send men out to follow you. During the chaos, Tyrion noticed Sansa in the corner of his eye. He watched as she walked down the stairs, watching the front gates with fear in her eyes. As she reached the ground, she knelt down to take your fur cloak from the mud. Wiping off the muck, her hands started to shake while staring down at the Stark symbol she embroidered into the leather.</p><p>~~~~~~~~~</p><p>Meanwhile, you were racing through the battlefield without a second glance. Your horse stomped over anything in its path while your eyes frantically searched for the familiar mop of thick, curly, entangled dark hair.</p><p>Coming up to the growing hill of bodies and blood, you could see, far out in the distance a group of men fighting the dead back to back, never letting the circle break. If one man fell, they would quickly burn the body and fill in the hole. Squinting your eyes, heart pounding in your ears, you could see one man being dragged away from the circle by a white walker, but quickly cuts it down and shatters it to pieces with their Valyrian steel sword.</p><p>\u201cJOOON!\u201d You called out to him, your voice croaking after not talking for so long.</p><p>He only spared a glance when he heard his sister\u2019s voice scream out his name, eyes widening before he started fighting harder against the dead so he could try to run to you.</p><p>You kick your horse\u2019s sides again, willing the beast to run even faster, seeing more of Jon\u2019s features now that you were drawing closer. He heaved his sword over his head, clearly exhausted and barely able to swing his weapon. He fought and fought until his arms grew tired and heavy, then he dropped his sword somewhere and started using his fists in slow, excruciatingly painful swings.\u00a0</p><p>Looking up again, he sees how close you are now and simply pushes a skeleton out of his way to get to you.</p><p>\u201cCome on!\u201d You encourage with a desperate look in your eye, reaching out with your arm and your horse draws closer.<br></p><p>Jon trudges forward, tripping on a few bodies before pushing himself up again, reaching out with his arm.</p><p>Time slows down, your breath and heartbeat were all you could hear in your ears, stretching your arm out so much you felt as though your shoulder would pop.</p><p>Before you could blink, you felt Jon\u2019s arm grab yours and with all your might, you scream in pain and pull him up onto your horse in one swift movement. Once he was placed on the saddle behind you, you turn your horse around and race back towards Winterfell.</p><p>You hear Jon groan behind you, and without even looking, you knew he was in bad shape. You practically broke your horse into making it run faster towards the keep, praying you would make it in time.</p><p>Your heart almost stops beating when you see the front gate slowly starting to close in the distance, and you lean forward to try and get your horse to gallop faster.</p><p>\u201cY/n\u2026\u201d Jon groaned in pain,\u00a0\u201cWe won\u2019t make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll make it,\u201d you snap, shouting at your horse when it staggered to catch its breath.</p><p>The gate was still closing, faster than you liked to see. You want to scream at them to hold the gates opened, but you knew they wouldn\u2019t hear you, not in time at least. You were so close now you could see what was beyond the gate. You could see the courtyard and the wounded being tended to. You could see Sansa\u2019s hair.</p><p>You could breathe a sigh of relief as your horse just makes into the crack of the front gates. You made it.</p><p>But your horse collapsed at its knees. Exhausted and possibly half dead, your horse gave in and fell into the ground of the courtyard, causing you and Jon to tumble off and crash into the mud. You screamed out when you landed on your arm, clutching it in pain while trying to breathe again. You were certain your arm and a few ribs were broken.\u00a0</p><p>Despite your pain, you began to crawl towards Jon, faintly hearing your sister scream in the background. People were gathering all around, trying to help you stand but your swipe them away, just wanting to reach your brother. You slap your hand onto him once you get to him, pulling yourself to sit up and rolling him onto his back, sighing in relief that he was still breathing,\u00a0\u201cJon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey\u2026\u201d he grumbled, coughing on what could only be blood while trying to smile, his hand reaching up and grabbing your uninjured one, \u201cWe made it. You were right.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDid you ever doubt me?\u201d You laugh slightly as Daenerys races over, kneeling on the other side of Jon and taking his other hand, crying in relief that the two of you were okay.<br></p><p>Now that you had time, you finally look down to inspect Jon\u2019s wounds, and you felt the blood eave your face at the sight. He had an arrow broken off in his hip and guts were almost spilling out of his stomach. He was covered in grime from head to toe, a big gash lying just over his eye. How could he have possibly still been fighting out there half dead like this?!</p><p>\u201cSOMEONE GET SAMWELL TARLY!\u201d You screamed out the order,\u00a0\u201cTELL HIM HIS KING IS WOUNDED!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cY/n, stop,\u201d Jon whispered,\u00a0\u201cListen to me\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSomeone, just grab a maester!\u201d You kept ordering around at the people standing about to watch the scene,\u00a0\u201cAnyone! PLEASE! Save him!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cListen to me, Y/n,\u201d Jon coughed out more sternly this time, causing you to look back down with tears running down your face,<br></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find someone, Jon. Don\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll be alright\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>He tried to smile, his lips quivering as he tried to breathe,\u00a0\u201cNot this time.\u201d</p><p>Your lip quivered as well, but it was more so from trying to hold back your sobs as your broken hand trailed over his hair, \u201cI went out there to save you\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou did. You saved me from dying out there, among the bodies of my friends and enemies. You saved me from dying on the bloodsoaked ground. You saved me so that I may die surrounded by my family, here in Winterfell.\u201d<br></p><p>He coughs again, this time looking around to see Sansa now kneeling by his head, stroking his hair with you while she silently cried. He could see a part of Bran\u2019s wheelchair somewhere behind his sister, but couldn\u2019t see his brother\u2019s face. He looks over at Daenerys and smiles, his fingers trailing over her cheek in an attempt to wipe her tears away. He wished Arya was here with them, but she was most likely still out there, fighting what remained of the Dead army,\u00a0\u201cSend word to Arya. Tell her to kill the Night King. Kill the Night King and the rest of the army will fall. It\u2019s a task I only trust her to do so.\u201d</p><p>Sansa nods for Daenerys, breath shaking while trying to hold in her cries,\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ll win, Jon. I promise.\u201d</p><p>He smiles before looking up at the sky, blinking slowly before letting out a huge sigh. When he opened his eyes again, they were distant, far away in another world as he croaked out,\u00a0\u201cY/n\u2026\u201d</p><p>You lean over more to catch his gaze, trying to smile,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m right here.\u201d</p><p><b>\u201cI miss moments like this more than anything\u2026\u201d</b><br></p><p>\u201cLike what, Jon?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou and me. It felt like it was just us for a long time. We couldn\u2019t sit at the table among the rest of the Starks. We had to sit alone, together, on the other far side of the room where Catelyn couldn\u2019t see us. Do you\u2026 do you think if she had known about our mother\u2026 would she have loved us like her own?\u201d<br></p><p>You sniff back your tears and nod,\u00a0\u201cI have no doubt in my mind we would have known what a mother\u2019s love would have been like.\u201d</p><p>His smile was wider this time, and you saw something you haven\u2019t seen in years. You saw a younger Jon Snow, with no scars and no horrors behind his eyes. For a moment, he looked like the young Jon Snow before he left for the Night\u2019s Watch.<br></p><p>\u201cY/n, there you are,\u201d he muttered, his voice sounded different and more\u2026 joyful. It brought you to confusion until he spoke again, shattering any pieces of your heart that was left,\u00a0\u201cI had a dream, dear sister. I dreamt I joined the Night\u2019s Watch and became Lord Commander. I dreamt about becoming King in the North. The very best, it made our father proud. I dreamt about dragons and direwolves and silver-haired queens. I dreamt about a long night and six years where I couldn\u2019t see you or the rest of our siblings. It was terrible.\u201d<br></p><p>You shush him, gripping his hand even tighter,\u00a0\u201cIt was just a dream, brother.\u201d</p><p>He smiled before closing his eyes\u2026 never to open them again.</p><p>~~~~~~~~~</p><p><b>Please don\u2019t forget to like, reblog, and follow!

You screamed out when you landed on your arm, clutching it in pain while trying to breathe again. You were certain your arm and a few ribs were broken.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite your pain, you began to crawl towards Jon, faintly hearing your sister scream in the background. People were gathering all around, trying to help you stand but your swipe them away, just wanting to reach your brother. You slap your hand onto him once you get to him, pulling yourself to sit up and rolling him onto his back, sighing in relief that he was still breathing,&nbsp;&ldquo;Jon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey&hellip;&rdquo; he grumbled, coughing on what could only be blood while trying to smile, his hand reaching up and grabbing your uninjured one, &ldquo;We made it. You were right.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Did you ever doubt me?&rdquo; You laugh slightly as Daenerys races over, kneeling on the other side of Jon and taking his other hand, crying in relief that the two of you were okay.<br /></p><p>Now that you had time, you finally look down to inspect Jon&rsquo;s wounds, and you felt the blood eave your face at the sight. He had an arrow broken off in his hip and guts were almost spilling out of his stomach. He was covered in grime from head to toe, a big gash lying just over his eye. How could he have possibly still been fighting out there half dead like this?!</p><p>&ldquo;SOMEONE GET SAMWELL TARLY!&rdquo; You screamed out the order,&nbsp;&ldquo;TELL HIM HIS KING IS WOUNDED!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Y/n, stop,&rdquo; Jon whispered,&nbsp;&ldquo;Listen to me&hellip;&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Someone, just grab a maester!&rdquo; You kept ordering around at the people standing about to watch the scene,&nbsp;&ldquo;Anyone! PLEASE! Save him!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Listen to me, Y/n,&rdquo; Jon coughed out more sternly this time, causing you to look back down with tears running down your face,<br /></p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find someone, Jon. Don&rsquo;t worry. You&rsquo;ll be alright&hellip;&rdquo;<br /></p><p>He tried to smile, his lips quivering as he tried to breathe,&nbsp;&ldquo;Not this time.&rdquo;</p><p>Your lip quivered as well, but it was more so from trying to hold back your sobs as your broken hand trailed over his hair, &ldquo;I went out there to save you&hellip;&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You did. You saved me from dying out there, among the bodies of my friends and enemies. You saved me from dying on the bloodsoaked ground. You saved me so that I may die surrounded by my family, here in Winterfell.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>He coughs again, this time looking around to see Sansa now kneeling by his head, stroking his hair with you while she silently cried. He could see a part of Bran&rsquo;s wheelchair somewhere behind his sister, but couldn&rsquo;t see his brother&rsquo;s face. He looks over at Daenerys and smiles, his fingers trailing over her cheek in an attempt to wipe her tears away. He wished Arya was here with them, but she was most likely still out there, fighting what remained of the Dead army,&nbsp;&ldquo;Send word to Arya. Tell her to kill the Night King. Kill the Night King and the rest of the army will fall. It&rsquo;s a task I only trust her to do so.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa nods for Daenerys, breath shaking while trying to hold in her cries,&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll win, Jon. I promise.&rdquo;</p><p>He smiles before looking up at the sky, blinking slowly before letting out a huge sigh. When he opened his eyes again, they were distant, far away in another world as he croaked out,&nbsp;&ldquo;Y/n&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>You lean over more to catch his gaze, trying to smile,&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m right here.&rdquo;</p><p><b>&ldquo;I miss moments like this more than anything&hellip;&rdquo;</b><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Like what, Jon?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You and me. It felt like it was just us for a long time. We couldn&rsquo;t sit at the table among the rest of the Starks. We had to sit alone, together, on the other far side of the room where Catelyn couldn&rsquo;t see us. Do you&hellip; do you think if she had known about our mother&hellip; would she have loved us like her own?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>You sniff back your tears and nod,&nbsp;&ldquo;I have no doubt in my mind we would have known what a mother&rsquo;s love would have been like.&rdquo;</p><p>His smile was wider this time, and you saw something you haven&rsquo;t seen in years. You saw a younger Jon Snow, with no scars and no horrors behind his eyes. For a moment, he looked like the young Jon Snow before he left for the Night&rsquo;s Watch.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Y/n, there you are,&rdquo; he muttered, his voice sounded different and more&hellip; joyful. It brought you to confusion until he spoke again, shattering any pieces of your heart that was left,&nbsp;&ldquo;I had a dream, dear sister. I dreamt I joined the Night&rsquo;s Watch and became Lord Commander. I dreamt about becoming King in the North. The very best, it made our father proud. I dreamt about dragons and direwolves and silver-haired queens. I dreamt about a long night and six years where I couldn&rsquo;t see you or the rest of our siblings. It was terrible.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>You shush him, gripping his hand even tighter,&nbsp;&ldquo;It was just a dream, brother.&rdquo;</p><p>He smiled before closing his eyes&hellip; never to open them again.</p><p>~~~~~~~~~</p><p><b>Please don&rsquo;t forget to like, reblog, and follow!
