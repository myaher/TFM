His decision to attack Casterly Rock instead of\u00a0 reclaiming the North was the final nail in the coffin. Robb\u2019s last war plan, which was a divergence from the books, was a conscious choice from the show writers to emphasize how Robb\u2019s choice was different from that of his siblings. And I believe the consequences would be different. <b>Robb chose the path of a lonewolf and he died. The surviving Stark kids would not repeat the mistakes of their brother. </b>They would choose Home (and each other) over everything else. The strength of the pack will help them survive the Long Night and the threats from other enemies.</p><p>Throughout the length of the series, the kids were driven away from home, separated, constantly endangered, abused and even murdered.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"672\" data-orig-height=\"368\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3d20d24797d1d9a070e492983acdfa38/tumblr_inline_pol6bzyeYO1v86ltz_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"672\" data-orig-height=\"368\"/></figure><p>Each of them suffered traumatic experiences, witnessing their loved ones die horribly before their very eyes. However, despite being forced to abandon their identity, they never stopped thinking of home and their family. Winterfell (and the North) holds a sacred place in their heart, the place of childhood memory, love and hope. No other characters in the series have memories of home as vivid as the Starklings. <b>Home is where they drew their strengths from.</b></p><blockquote><p>\u201c<b>Winterfell</b> is our home.

He is\nthe one who knows every little corner of Winterfell, even the most secretive\npart of it. \n\nAs the younger son, Bran didn\u2019t expect to inherit the ancestral home. His role is to become Robb\u2019s bannerman. But he had his own way to become lord of the castle. As he frequently climbed to Winterfell\u2019s rooftop, where he\nclaimed his \u201csecond home\u201d, he saw the life of the castle, everyone, and\neverything.</p><blockquote><p>Bran could perch for hours among the shapeless, rain-worn gargoyles that brooded over the First Keep, watching it all: the men drilling with wood and steel in the yard, the cooks tending their vegetables in the glass garden, restless dogs running back and forth in the kennels, the silence of the godswood, the girls gossiping beside the washing well. It made him<b> feel like he was the lord of the castle, in a way even Robb would never know.</b>\u00a0(Bran II, A Game of Thrones) <br/></p></blockquote><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"230\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9f943148709a0efda50c039ac7476dfc/tumblr_oxfxcalWWC1svpp7to4_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"230\"/></figure><p>Gif:\u00a0\n\n<a href=\"http://fuckyeahhousestark.tumblr.com/post/166146309590\">fuckyeahhousestark</a>\n\n</p><p>Even the crypts do not frighten\nBran. He feels like he is a part of it.<br/></p><blockquote><p>Their\nfootsteps echoed through the cavernous crypts. The shadows behind them\nswallowed his father as the shadows ahead retreated to unveil other statues; no\nmere lords, these, but the old Kings in the North. On their brows they wore\nstone crowns. [\u2026] Their faces were stern and strong, and some of them had done\nterrible things, but they were <i>Starks</i>\neveryone, and Bran knew all their tales. <b>He had never feared the crypts; they\nwere part of his home and who he was, and he had always known that one day he\nwould lie here too.</b> (Bran VII, A Clash of Kings)</p></blockquote><p>Bran\u2019s happy childhood didn\u2019t last long. His life changed upside down after he was shoved from the tower by Jaime and lost his mobility. However, the worst was yet to come. Waking up from his coma, Bran was disappointed that his mother had left him, although she left to investigate the cause of his fall and to demand justice for him. Maester Luwin was surprised and couldn\u2019t answer the seemingly childlike question from Bran.</p><blockquote><p>Luwin: Your mother had to leave Winterfell to protect the family.</p><p>Bran: <b>How can she protect the family if she\u2019s not with her family?</b></p></blockquote><p>What happened after proved that Bran was actually reasonable. One cannot protect the family while he/she is not with the family. Robb left for war and Bran was assumed Lord of Winterfell in his stead. That was a huge responsibility for a cripple 10-year-old child. With the help from Maester Luwin, Bran took care of Winterfell and its people, showing great potentials to become a good lord.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"230\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9f54e9145f0e0905350b1bfac40b08ae/tumblr_oxfxcalWWC1svpp7to1_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"230\"/></figure><p>Still, defending the whole North and Winterfell while the best Northern soldiers were going South with Robb was too much of a responsibility for a child. Winterfell was sacked after a surprise attack from ironbonn led by Theon.

While he was\ntraining in the cave, Bran was frequently brought back to Winterfell in the\nvisions and he didn\u2019t want to leave.

I was Home. (Bran to Bloodraven, 6x02)</p></blockquote><p>Bran has been through a horrific\njourney. Be crippled by a knight he aspired to become when he grows up, betrayed\nand captured by a surrogate brother, witnessed Ser Rodrick and Maester\nLuwin killed, saw his home burnt, captured and tortured by the mutineers,\nwitnessed the death of his mentors and companions, hunted by the dead beyond the\nWall, learned in a short time to master the magical power he can hardly\ncontrol. Now he\u2019s back home but it\u2019s not yet safe. The Dead is marching on\nthem, and he bears the responsibility to face the Night King and save his home and humankind. As a child, Bran always dreamed to become a knight and was so devastated when he learned he could never walk again, meaning there was no chance to fulfilling his dream. But he might in the end be a knight in another way.\u00a0<br/></p><blockquote><p>Benjen\nto Bran: You must learn to control it before the Night King comes. One way or\nanother, he will find his way to the world of men. And when he does, you will\nbe there waiting for him. And you will be ready. (6x06)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Bran\nto Sansa: I need to learn to see better. When the Long Night comes again, I\nneed to be ready.

In season 7, Bran\nlost his sense of self. He claims to be the 3-Eyed-Raven now and only remembers\nhow it was to be Bran Stark. Does he forget that he is Bran? Does he forget he\nis a Stark? For someone who knows and loves every inch of Winterfell, who knows\nall the story of the Starks before him, who endured so much pain and horror to\nbe back home and defend it, just to lose himself and become emotionless would\nrender the story totally bitter and quite meaningless.</p><blockquote><p>\n\nIt\u2019s not like he\u2019s not Bran anymore. It\u2019s just the part of his head that is Bran is a much, much smaller part of his personality now. <b>When he is with the Starks and his family, that part of him flares up.</b> But really, he\u2019s transcended that \u2013 he kind of exists beyond human beings and human issues and problems. He is time.

And if the speculation that the Night King was\nthe ancestor of House Stark is true, perhaps in season 8, Bran would need to\nlearn much more about his family\u2019s history and secrets, and he would come to understand\n<b>what it truly means to be a Stark of\nWinterfell</b>.\u00a0</p><hr><h2><b>Arya</b></h2><p>Arya left\nWinterfell for King\u2019s Landing with Ned and Sansa since season 1 and ever since,\nher life has become a horror story.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"230\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"lovableamy:C39KJGSmDlpmVAoxVsiq0w:ZpoBqx2PDjNQZ\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3892f6e9a34342fe0413557264ff7015/tumblr_ov4j0xZduR1qgild1o2_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"230\"/></figure><p>After Ned was beheaded, Arya went into the\nhiding, travelled with the Night\u2019s Watch\u2019s recruits, became a captive at\nHarrenhal and then the Hound\u2019s.

And I hope that would not be the path for Arya.\n\n Her childhood was ruined by all the misfortunes happened to her family, forcing her to become a cold-blooded assassin. Winterfell and all the good memories of her family were the only lights in Arya\u2019s darkest days which prevent her from totally losing herself and the humanity that was left in her. Now she\u2019s home with her siblings, would the love in her heart eventually outgrow the hatred that she embraced for years?<br/></p><blockquote><p>\n\nThere\u2019s this split with Arya between trying to be <b>who she wants to be \u2014 getting back to back to that naivet\u00e9 and innocence with her family</b> \u2014 and her unfinished business. (<a href=\"https://ew.com/tv/game-of-thrones-cast-photos-season-8/\">Maisie Williams on Arya Stark in season 8</a>, EW interview)\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>Another positive\naspect of Arya\u2019s journey that makes us hopeful is, while travelling across a war-torn Westeros, Arya lived among the common folks, befriended with\nthem and suffered the same as they did, she comes to understand the ugliness of\nwar, of the current oppressive social system and what the people really need. She\ndevelops a sense of empathy with the common people and is always ready to\ndefend the weak. Her path also led her to an encounter with the Lannister soldiers when she realized the soldiers were just common folks dragged into someone else\u2019s war. They are humans with all the concerns, and hopes and dreams, and families to care for, just like her.\u00a0<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"536\" data-orig-height=\"214\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6d27f6ef2d2ace1fe095d7d816e9344e/tumblr_inline_pomwlbpPTn1v86ltz_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"536\" data-orig-height=\"214\"/></figure><p>This is a parallel with Robb\u2019s encounter with the Lannister child soldier who lost his leg in the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0IzTU5pehM\">Battle of Oxcross</a>, allowing us to see wars from different view point. I believe with all her experiences living among the commoners, Arya will finally realize that wars and revenge would not be the solution for Westeros. Would that be interesting if the person who is driven by revenge is the one who learns to forgive and actively seek out a way to end war for the benefit of the common people? Would that be meaningful if the person who is trained to bring death, to serve the Many-Faced God will end up fighting to save lives?</p><p>Arya knows that she can never be as good a lady (aka a ruler) as Sansa and she still need to figure out what she can do.</p><blockquote><p>I was never going to be as good as a lady as you.

She found twigs and fallen branches\nbeneath the snow and broke off the ends to make the trees for the godswood. For the gravestones in the lichyard she used bits of bark.

Since then, the Night\u2019s Watch became his family, Castle Black became his home and \u201cguarding the realm of men\u201d is his sole mission.

His role is to become Robb\u2019s bannerman. But he had his own way to become lord of the castle. As he frequently climbed to Winterfell\u2019s rooftop, where he\nclaimed his \u201csecond home\u201d, he saw the life of the castle, everyone, and\neverything.</p><blockquote><p>Bran could perch for hours among the shapeless, rain-worn gargoyles that brooded over the First Keep, watching it all: the men drilling with wood and steel in the yard, the cooks tending their vegetables in the glass garden, restless dogs running back and forth in the kennels, the silence of the godswood, the girls gossiping beside the washing well. It made him<b> feel like he was the lord of the castle, in a way even Robb would never know.</b>\u00a0(Bran II, A Game of Thrones) <br></p></blockquote><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"230\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9f943148709a0efda50c039ac7476dfc/tumblr_oxfxcalWWC1svpp7to4_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"230\"></figure><p>Gif:\u00a0\n\n<a href=\"http://fuckyeahhousestark.tumblr.com/post/166146309590\">fuckyeahhousestark</a>\n\n</p><p>Even the crypts do not frighten\nBran. He feels like he is a part of it.<br></p><blockquote><p>Their\nfootsteps echoed through the cavernous crypts. The shadows behind them\nswallowed his father as the shadows ahead retreated to unveil other statues; no\nmere lords, these, but the old Kings in the North. On their brows they wore\nstone crowns. [\u2026] Their faces were stern and strong, and some of them had done\nterrible things, but they were <i>Starks</i>\neveryone, and Bran knew all their tales. <b>He had never feared the crypts; they\nwere part of his home and who he was, and he had always known that one day he\nwould lie here too.</b> (Bran VII, A Clash of Kings)</p></blockquote><p>Bran\u2019s happy childhood didn\u2019t last long. His life changed upside down after he was shoved from the tower by Jaime and lost his mobility. However, the worst was yet to come. Waking up from his coma, Bran was disappointed that his mother had left him, although she left to investigate the cause of his fall and to demand justice for him. Maester Luwin was surprised and couldn\u2019t answer the seemingly childlike question from Bran.</p><blockquote><p>Luwin: Your mother had to leave Winterfell to protect the family.</p><p>Bran: <b>How can she protect the family if she\u2019s not with her family?</b></p></blockquote><p>What happened after proved that Bran was actually reasonable. One cannot protect the family while he/she is not with the family. Robb left for war and Bran was assumed Lord of Winterfell in his stead. That was a huge responsibility for a cripple 10-year-old child. With the help from Maester Luwin, Bran took care of Winterfell and its people, showing great potentials to become a good lord.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"230\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9f54e9145f0e0905350b1bfac40b08ae/tumblr_oxfxcalWWC1svpp7to1_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"230\"></figure><p>Still, defending the whole North and Winterfell while the best Northern soldiers were going South with Robb was too much of a responsibility for a child. Winterfell was sacked after a surprise attack from ironbonn led by Theon.

As he fled North, he turned to have a last\nlook of \u201cthe castle that had been his life\u201d.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"270\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/451ee5a54f59e7e13b34735d77e24c8a/tumblr_inline_po2fe0sCVb1v86ltz_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"270\"></figure><h2><i>The stone is strong, </i>Bran told himself, <i>the roots of the trees go deep, and under\nthe ground the Kings of Winter sit their thrones. </i>So long as those\nremained, Winterfell remained. <b>It was not dead, just broken. <i>Like me, </i>he thought, </b><i><b>I\u2019m not dead either.</b> </i>(Bran VII, A Clash\nof Kings)</h2><p>Following the call from the Bloodraven, Bran and his companion arrived in a cave under a heart tree beyond the Wall. While he was\ntraining in the cave, Bran was frequently brought back to Winterfell in the\nvisions and he didn\u2019t want to leave. Because staying in the visions was the only way he could be home.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"270\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/177c135e88c6136b44a75595b244dbe3/tumblr_inline_pom7g4coKH1v86ltz_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"270\"></figure><p>When Bloodraven warned him if he stayed in\nthe visions for too long, he will be drowned,<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sYAtQXeclw\"> he responded with despair</a>.</p><blockquote><p>I wasn\u2019t drowning. I was Home. (Bran to Bloodraven, 6x02)</p></blockquote><p>Bran has been through a horrific\njourney. Be crippled by a knight he aspired to become when he grows up, betrayed\nand captured by a surrogate brother, witnessed Ser Rodrick and Maester\nLuwin killed, saw his home burnt, captured and tortured by the mutineers,\nwitnessed the death of his mentors and companions, hunted by the dead beyond the\nWall, learned in a short time to master the magical power he can hardly\ncontrol. Now he\u2019s back home but it\u2019s not yet safe. The Dead is marching on\nthem, and he bears the responsibility to face the Night King and save his home and humankind. As a child, Bran always dreamed to become a knight and was so devastated when he learned he could never walk again, meaning there was no chance to fulfilling his dream. But he might in the end be a knight in another way.\u00a0<br></p><blockquote><p>Benjen\nto Bran: You must learn to control it before the Night King comes. One way or\nanother, he will find his way to the world of men. And when he does, you will\nbe there waiting for him. And you will be ready. (6x06)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Bran\nto Sansa: I need to learn to see better. When the Long Night comes again, I\nneed to be ready.

In season 7, Bran\nlost his sense of self. He claims to be the 3-Eyed-Raven now and only remembers\nhow it was to be Bran Stark. Does he forget that he is Bran? Does he forget he\nis a Stark? For someone who knows and loves every inch of Winterfell, who knows\nall the story of the Starks before him, who endured so much pain and horror to\nbe back home and defend it, just to lose himself and become emotionless would\nrender the story totally bitter and quite meaningless.</p><blockquote><p>\n\nIt\u2019s not like he\u2019s not Bran anymore. It\u2019s just the part of his head that is Bran is a much, much smaller part of his personality now. <b>When he is with the Starks and his family, that part of him flares up.</b> But really, he\u2019s transcended that \u2013 he kind of exists beyond human beings and human issues and problems. He is time.

And if the speculation that the Night King was\nthe ancestor of House Stark is true, perhaps in season 8, Bran would need to\nlearn much more about his family\u2019s history and secrets, and he would come to understand\n<b>what it truly means to be a Stark of\nWinterfell</b>.\u00a0</p><hr><h2><b>Arya</b></h2><p>Arya left\nWinterfell for King\u2019s Landing with Ned and Sansa since season 1 and ever since,\nher life has become a horror story.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"230\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"lovableamy:C39KJGSmDlpmVAoxVsiq0w:ZpoBqx2PDjNQZ\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3892f6e9a34342fe0413557264ff7015/tumblr_ov4j0xZduR1qgild1o2_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"230\"></figure><p>After Ned was beheaded, Arya went into the\nhiding, travelled with the Night\u2019s Watch\u2019s recruits, became a captive at\nHarrenhal and then the Hound\u2019s.

However, at the back of her mind, Arya could never forget where she came\nfrom. <b></b></p><h2>When\nyou smell our candles burning, what does it make you think of, my child? <i><b>Winterfell</b>, </i>she might have said. <i>I smell Hodor laughing, and Jon and Robb\nbattling in the yard, and Sansa singing about some stupid lady fair.

The degree of ruthlessness and brutality she inflicted\non her enemies is quite alarming. Luckily, the bright spot is, she never let\nhatred and rage took over her to the point that she would kill innocents. She\nrefused to complete her assignment of killing Lady Crane (note that the actress actually played Cersei, her number one enemey), knowing fully well\nthat the failed mission would risk her life. Later on, aware of the Frey women\u2019s innocence in the Red Wedding, she didn\u2019t let them drink the poisoned\nwine either. </p><p>\n\n Among the Stark kids, Arya has the highest risk of following Robb\u2019s footsteps since revenge has become her primary motivation for a considerable period of time. And as far as we know, blind vengeance only leads to self-destruction. And I hope that would not be the path for Arya.\n\n Her childhood was ruined by all the misfortunes happened to her family, forcing her to become a cold-blooded assassin. Winterfell and all the good memories of her family were the only lights in Arya\u2019s darkest days which prevent her from totally losing herself and the humanity that was left in her. Now she\u2019s home with her siblings, would the love in her heart eventually outgrow the hatred that she embraced for years?<br></p><blockquote><p>\n\nThere\u2019s this split with Arya between trying to be <b>who she wants to be \u2014 getting back to back to that naivet\u00e9 and innocence with her family</b> \u2014 and her unfinished business. (<a href=\"https://ew.com/tv/game-of-thrones-cast-photos-season-8/\">Maisie Williams on Arya Stark in season 8</a>, EW interview)\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>Another positive\naspect of Arya\u2019s journey that makes us hopeful is, while travelling across a war-torn Westeros, Arya lived among the common folks, befriended with\nthem and suffered the same as they did, she comes to understand the ugliness of\nwar, of the current oppressive social system and what the people really need. She\ndevelops a sense of empathy with the common people and is always ready to\ndefend the weak. Her path also led her to an encounter with the Lannister soldiers when she realized the soldiers were just common folks dragged into someone else\u2019s war. They are humans with all the concerns, and hopes and dreams, and families to care for, just like her.\u00a0<br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"536\" data-orig-height=\"214\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6d27f6ef2d2ace1fe095d7d816e9344e/tumblr_inline_pomwlbpPTn1v86ltz_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"536\" data-orig-height=\"214\"></figure><p>This is a parallel with Robb\u2019s encounter with the Lannister child soldier who lost his leg in the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0IzTU5pehM\">Battle of Oxcross</a>, allowing us to see wars from different view point. I believe with all her experiences living among the commoners, Arya will finally realize that wars and revenge would not be the solution for Westeros. Would that be interesting if the person who is driven by revenge is the one who learns to forgive and actively seek out a way to end war for the benefit of the common people? Would that be meaningful if the person who is trained to bring death, to serve the Many-Faced God will end up fighting to save lives?</p><p>Arya knows that she can never be as good a lady (aka a ruler) as Sansa and she still need to figure out what she can do.</p><blockquote><p>I was never going to be as good as a lady as you.

She found twigs and fallen branches\nbeneath the snow and broke off the ends to make the trees for the godswood. For the gravestones in the lichyard she used bits of bark.

Back in season 1, Jon\nwas eager to leave home to become a brother of the Night\u2019s Watch like his Uncle\nBenjen, whom he admired. Before he left, his \u201cfather\u201d reminded him that manning\nthe Wall is a Starks\u2019 duty for thousands of years and that he had a Stark blood\ndespite not bearing the Stark name.</p><blockquote><p>There\u2019s great honor serving in the Night\u2019s Watch. The Starks have manned the Wall for thousands of years. And <b>you are a Stark</b>. You might not have my name, but you have my blood.

He might have chosen the Night\u2019s Watch, a duty that the Starks have borne for thousands of years, and aspired to become a ranger like Uncle Benjen to make his father proud. He longed for the same attention his father granted Robb.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>I was jealous of Robb my whole life. The way my Father looked at him. I wanted that. (Jon to Sam, 4x01)</p></blockquote><p><b>Jon\u2019s deepest fear is rejection</b>, that he is not a Stark. In his nightmares, he saw himself running through in an empty Winterfell to the crypts.</p><blockquote><p>And then I find myself in front of the door to the crypts. It\u2019s black inside, and I can see the steps spiraling down. Somehow I know I have to go down there, but I don\u2019t want to. I\u2019m afraid of what might be waiting for me. The old Kings of Winter are down there, sitting on their thrones with stone wolves at their feet and iron swords across their laps, but it\u2019s not them I\u2019m afraid of. <b>I scream that I\u2019m not a Stark, that this isn\u2019t my place, but it\u2019s no good, I have to go anyway</b>, do I start down, feeling the walls as I descend, with no torch to light the way. (Jon IV, A Game of Thrones)</p></blockquote><p><b>Being recognized as a Stark is Jon\u2019s biggest passion</b>. He loves and adores\u00a0Ned and in his wildest dream, he dreamed that his father would place Ice in his hand.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>When Jon had been Bran\u2019s age, he had dreamed of doing great deeds, as boys always did. The details of his feats changed with every dreaming, but quite often he imagined saving his father\u2019s life. Afterward, <b>Lord Eddard would declare that Jon had proved himself a true Stark, and place Ice in his hand. </b>Even then he had known it was only a child\u2019s folly; no bastard could ever hope to wield a father\u2019s sword. (Jon VIII, A Game of Thrones)\n\n</p></blockquote><p>Even after Lord Mormont gave him Long Claw, an honor that no bastard could dare dream of, here was what Jon thought.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p><i>He (Lord Mormont) is not my father. </i>The thought leapt unbidden to Jon\u2019s mind. <i><b>Lord Eddard Stark is my father.</b> I will not forget him, no matter how many swords they give me. </i>(Jon VIII, A Game of Thrones)</p></blockquote><p>Upon\nlearning about Ned\u2019s death, Jon decided to leave the Night\u2019s Watch to join Robb\navenging their father. He hoped that Robb would take him in and he would have\nchance fight those who murdered his father on the battlefield. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</p><blockquote><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJon\nwas not afraid of death, but he did not want to die like that, trussed and\nbound and beheaded like a common brigand. If he must perish, let it be with a\nsword in his hand, fighting his father\u2019s killers. <b>He was no true Stark, had\nnever been one \u2026 but he could die like one.</b> <b>Let them say that Eddard Stark had\nfathered four sons, not three.</b>\u00a0(Jon IX, A Game of Thrones)\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>His comrades intercepted and convinced him to stay. The next day, Lord Commander Mormont told Jon that fighting the White Walkers to protect the living is more important than the wars of the lords. Jon then swore to Mormont that he would not attempt to desert again and joined the mission beyond the Wall. Since then, the Night\u2019s Watch became his family, Castle Black became his home and \u201cguarding the realm of men\u201d is his sole mission. Even when he was living among the wildings (as a spy) and falling in love with Yigritte, Jon never forgot his Night\u2019s Watch vow as \u201cthe sword in the darkness\u201d and\u00a0\u201cthe shield that guards the realm of men\u201d.<br></p><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter\ncoming back from beyond the Wall and defeating the wildings\u2019 attack, Jon\nreceived an offer from Stannis to legitimize him and make him Lord of\nWinterfell if he bent the knee to Stannis and helped him take Winterfell from\nthe Boltons. The prospects of becoming Jon Stark, Lord of Winterfell excited\nhim as he confessed to Sam.\n\n\n\n<br></p><blockquote><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s\nthe first thing I ever remember wanting.

(It is not revealed in the\nshow, but I don\u2019t think that book!Jon and show!Jon would have different\nopinions in this regard.)\n\n\n\n<br></p><h2><i>Winterfell</i>,\nhe thought. <i>Theon left it burned and\nbroken, but <b>I could restore it</b>.</i> Surely his father would have wanted that,\nand Robb as well.

Believing that his Stark family was all dead and losing faith in his new family (the Night\u2019s Watch), Jon decided to flee South and find some warmth. But Sansa arrived at the Wall right at that moment.

His decision to attack Casterly Rock instead of\u00a0 reclaiming the North was the final nail in the coffin. Robb\u2019s last war plan, which was a divergence from the books, was a conscious choice from the show writers to emphasize how Robb\u2019s choice was different from that of his siblings. And I believe the consequences would be different. <b>Robb chose the path of a lonewolf and he died. The surviving Stark kids would not repeat the mistakes of their brother. </b>They would choose Home (and each other) over everything else.

He is\nthe one who knows every little corner of Winterfell, even the most secretive\npart of it. \n\nAs the younger son, Bran didn\u2019t expect to inherit the ancestral home. His role is to become Robb\u2019s bannerman. But he had his own way to become lord of the castle. As he frequently climbed to Winterfell\u2019s rooftop, where he\nclaimed his \u201csecond home\u201d, he saw the life of the castle, everyone, and\neverything.</p><blockquote><p>Bran could perch for hours among the shapeless, rain-worn gargoyles that brooded over the First Keep, watching it all: the men drilling with wood and steel in the yard, the cooks tending their vegetables in the glass garden, restless dogs running back and forth in the kennels, the silence of the godswood, the girls gossiping beside the washing well. It made him<b> feel like he was the lord of the castle, in a way even Robb would never know.</b>\u00a0(Bran II, A Game of Thrones) <br></p></blockquote><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"230\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9f943148709a0efda50c039ac7476dfc/tumblr_oxfxcalWWC1svpp7to4_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"230\"></figure><p>Gif:\u00a0\n\n<a href=\"http://fuckyeahhousestark.tumblr.com/post/166146309590\">fuckyeahhousestark</a>\n\n</p><p>Even the crypts do not frighten\nBran. He feels like he is a part of it.<br></p><blockquote><p>Their\nfootsteps echoed through the cavernous crypts. The shadows behind them\nswallowed his father as the shadows ahead retreated to unveil other statues; no\nmere lords, these, but the old Kings in the North. On their brows they wore\nstone crowns. [\u2026] Their faces were stern and strong, and some of them had done\nterrible things, but they were <i>Starks</i>\neveryone, and Bran knew all their tales. <b>He had never feared the crypts; they\nwere part of his home and who he was, and he had always known that one day he\nwould lie here too.</b> (Bran VII, A Clash of Kings)</p></blockquote><p>Bran\u2019s happy childhood didn\u2019t last long. His life changed upside down after he was shoved from the tower by Jaime and lost his mobility. However, the worst was yet to come. Waking up from his coma, Bran was disappointed that his mother had left him, although she left to investigate the cause of his fall and to demand justice for him. Maester Luwin was surprised and couldn\u2019t answer the seemingly childlike question from Bran.</p><blockquote><p>Luwin: Your mother had to leave Winterfell to protect the family.</p><p>Bran: <b>How can she protect the family if she\u2019s not with her family?</b></p></blockquote><p>What happened after proved that Bran was actually reasonable. One cannot protect the family while he/she is not with the family. Robb left for war and Bran was assumed Lord of Winterfell in his stead. That was a huge responsibility for a cripple 10-year-old child. With the help from Maester Luwin, Bran took care of Winterfell and its people, showing great potentials to become a good lord.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"230\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9f54e9145f0e0905350b1bfac40b08ae/tumblr_oxfxcalWWC1svpp7to1_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"230\"></figure><p>Still, defending the whole North and Winterfell while the best Northern soldiers were going South with Robb was too much of a responsibility for a child.

Be crippled by a knight he aspired to become when he grows up, betrayed\nand captured by a surrogate brother, witnessed Ser Rodrick and Maester\nLuwin killed, saw his home burnt, captured and tortured by the mutineers,\nwitnessed the death of his mentors and companions, hunted by the dead beyond the\nWall, learned in a short time to master the magical power he can hardly\ncontrol. Now he\u2019s back home but it\u2019s not yet safe. The Dead is marching on\nthem, and he bears the responsibility to face the Night King and save his home and humankind. As a child, Bran always dreamed to become a knight and was so devastated when he learned he could never walk again, meaning there was no chance to fulfilling his dream. But he might in the end be a knight in another way.\u00a0<br></p><blockquote><p>Benjen\nto Bran: You must learn to control it before the Night King comes.

For someone who knows and loves every inch of Winterfell, who knows\nall the story of the Starks before him, who endured so much pain and horror to\nbe back home and defend it, just to lose himself and become emotionless would\nrender the story totally bitter and quite meaningless.</p><blockquote><p>\n\nIt\u2019s not like he\u2019s not Bran anymore. It\u2019s just the part of his head that is Bran is a much, much smaller part of his personality now. <b>When he is with the Starks and his family, that part of him flares up.</b> But really, he\u2019s transcended that \u2013 he kind of exists beyond human beings and human issues and problems.

The degree of ruthlessness and brutality she inflicted\non her enemies is quite alarming. Luckily, the bright spot is, she never let\nhatred and rage took over her to the point that she would kill innocents. She\nrefused to complete her assignment of killing Lady Crane (note that the actress actually played Cersei, her number one enemey), knowing fully well\nthat the failed mission would risk her life. Later on, aware of the Frey women\u2019s innocence in the Red Wedding, she didn\u2019t let them drink the poisoned\nwine either. </p><p>\n\n Among the Stark kids, Arya has the highest risk of following Robb\u2019s footsteps since revenge has become her primary motivation for a considerable period of time. And as far as we know, blind vengeance only leads to self-destruction. And I hope that would not be the path for Arya.\n\n Her childhood was ruined by all the misfortunes happened to her family, forcing her to become a cold-blooded assassin. Winterfell and all the good memories of her family were the only lights in Arya\u2019s darkest days which prevent her from totally losing herself and the humanity that was left in her. Now she\u2019s home with her siblings, would the love in her heart eventually outgrow the hatred that she embraced for years?<br></p><blockquote><p>\n\nThere\u2019s this split with Arya between trying to be <b>who she wants to be \u2014 getting back to back to that naivet\u00e9 and innocence with her family</b> \u2014 and her unfinished business. (<a href=\"https://ew.com/tv/game-of-thrones-cast-photos-season-8/\">Maisie Williams on Arya Stark in season 8</a>, EW interview)\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>Another positive\naspect of Arya\u2019s journey that makes us hopeful is, while travelling across a war-torn Westeros, Arya lived among the common folks, befriended with\nthem and suffered the same as they did, she comes to understand the ugliness of\nwar, of the current oppressive social system and what the people really need. She\ndevelops a sense of empathy with the common people and is always ready to\ndefend the weak. Her path also led her to an encounter with the Lannister soldiers when she realized the soldiers were just common folks dragged into someone else\u2019s war. They are humans with all the concerns, and hopes and dreams, and families to care for, just like her.\u00a0<br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"536\" data-orig-height=\"214\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6d27f6ef2d2ace1fe095d7d816e9344e/tumblr_inline_pomwlbpPTn1v86ltz_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"536\" data-orig-height=\"214\"></figure><p>This is a parallel with Robb\u2019s encounter with the Lannister child soldier who lost his leg in the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0IzTU5pehM\">Battle of Oxcross</a>, allowing us to see wars from different view point. I believe with all her experiences living among the commoners, Arya will finally realize that wars and revenge would not be the solution for Westeros. Would that be interesting if the person who is driven by revenge is the one who learns to forgive and actively seek out a way to end war for the benefit of the common people? Would that be meaningful if the person who is trained to bring death, to serve the Many-Faced God will end up fighting to save lives?</p><p>Arya knows that she can never be as good a lady (aka a ruler) as Sansa and she still need to figure out what she can do.</p><blockquote><p>I was never going to be as good as a lady as you. So I have to be something else. (Arya to Sansa, 7x07)</p></blockquote><p>What does\u00a0\u201csomething else\u201d mean for Arya? A fighter, maybe. But she might also have a more important role to play in the political landscape of the North (and Westeros) afterwards.</p><p>Remember Robb\u2019s conversation with Talisa about his father?<br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"240\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/aa009b3c5fcc4450604c36ed30b8b0e2/tumblr_peqs6fDcpt1s5m21go1_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"240\"></figure><p>Gif:\u00a0\n\n<a href=\"http://iheartgot.tumblr.com/post/183544353895\">iheartgot</a>\n\n</p><blockquote><p>\n\nHe once told me that being a lord is like being a father, except you have thousands of children and you worry about all of them.

(Robb to Talisa, 2x08)\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>\n\n<b>Taking care of the common folks under their rule is a Stark tradition.</b>\n\n<br></p><p>Since Arya is so much inspired by Ned, she will \n\nfollow the example of her father\n\n when she comes back to Winterfell.\u00a0<br></p><blockquote><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack\nat Winterfell, they had eaten in the Great Hall almost half the time. Her\nfather used to say that a lord needed to eat with his men, if he hoped to keep\nthem. \u201cKnow the men who follow you,\u201d she heard him tell Robb once, \u201cand let\nthem know you.

(Arya II, A Game of Thrones)\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Sitting among the soldiers and commoners, talking with them, listening to their concerns and being the voice of the people, it\u2019s not too far-fetch to picture Arya that way. \n\nThe skills she learned as a Faceless Men trainee to play her part as someone else, \u201cspeak in their voices\u201d, \u201clive in their skin\u201d could be transcended to serve people instead, if she could utilize such skills to empathize with people of various backgrounds. \n\nBut first of all, let\u2019s pray that she would find the strength to let go of vengeance and deploy her \u201cexpertise\u201d for good.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"618\" data-orig-height=\"298\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/938322cb71d7ac5b17064cc8bd03cfeb/tumblr_inline_poos7d9xhJ1v86ltz_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"618\" data-orig-height=\"298\"></figure><hr><h2><b>Sansa</b></h2><p>Sansa began\nthe series excited to leave home for King\u2019s Landing to fulfill her dream of\nmarrying a handsome young prince and becoming queen someday.

Sansa had\nlittle agency over her situation, she had to pretend to survive, but in her\nmind, she was free. She is still a Stark, through and through; and her heart\nbelongs to Winterfell. </p><blockquote><p><b>I\u2019m a Stark.

Two walls ankle-high, the inner taller than the outer. Towers and\nturrets, keeps and stairs, a round kitchen, a square armory, the stables along\nthe inside of the west wall. It was only a castle when she began, but before\nvery long Sansa knew it was Winterfell. She found twigs and fallen branches\nbeneath the snow and broke off the ends to make the trees for the godswood. For the gravestones in the lichyard she used bits of bark. Soon her\ngloves and her boots were crusty white, her hands were tingling, and her feet\nwere soaked and cold, but she did not care. The castle was all that mattered.\nSome things were hard to remember, but most came back to her easily, as if she\nhad been there only yesterday.

It\u2019s black inside, and I can see the steps spiraling down. Somehow I know I have to go down there, but I don\u2019t want to. I\u2019m afraid of what might be waiting for me. The old Kings of Winter are down there, sitting on their thrones with stone wolves at their feet and iron swords across their laps, but it\u2019s not them I\u2019m afraid of. <b>I scream that I\u2019m not a Stark, that this isn\u2019t my place, but it\u2019s no good, I have to go anyway</b>, do I start down, feeling the walls as I descend, with no torch to light the way. (Jon IV, A Game of Thrones)</p></blockquote><p><b>Being recognized as a Stark is Jon\u2019s biggest passion</b>. He loves and adores\u00a0Ned and in his wildest dream, he dreamed that his father would place Ice in his hand.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>When Jon had been Bran\u2019s age, he had dreamed of doing great deeds, as boys always did. The details of his feats changed with every dreaming, but quite often he imagined saving his father\u2019s life. Afterward, <b>Lord Eddard would declare that Jon had proved himself a true Stark, and place Ice in his hand. </b>Even then he had known it was only a child\u2019s folly; no bastard could ever hope to wield a father\u2019s sword. (Jon VIII, A Game of Thrones)\n\n</p></blockquote><p>Even after Lord Mormont gave him Long Claw, an honor that no bastard could dare dream of, here was what Jon thought.\u00a0</p><blockquote><p><i>He (Lord Mormont) is not my father. </i>The thought leapt unbidden to Jon\u2019s mind. <i><b>Lord Eddard Stark is my father.</b> I will not forget him, no matter how many swords they give me. </i>(Jon VIII, A Game of Thrones)</p></blockquote><p>Upon\nlearning about Ned\u2019s death, Jon decided to leave the Night\u2019s Watch to join Robb\navenging their father. He hoped that Robb would take him in and he would have\nchance fight those who murdered his father on the battlefield. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</p><blockquote><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJon\nwas not afraid of death, but he did not want to die like that, trussed and\nbound and beheaded like a common brigand. If he must perish, let it be with a\nsword in his hand, fighting his father\u2019s killers. <b>He was no true Stark, had\nnever been one \u2026 but he could die like one.</b> <b>Let them say that Eddard Stark had\nfathered four sons, not three.</b>\u00a0(Jon IX, A Game of Thrones)\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>His comrades intercepted and convinced him to stay. The next day, Lord Commander Mormont told Jon that fighting the White Walkers to protect the living is more important than the wars of the lords. Jon then swore to Mormont that he would not attempt to desert again and joined the mission beyond the Wall. Since then, the Night\u2019s Watch became his family, Castle Black became his home and \u201cguarding the realm of men\u201d is his sole mission. Even when he was living among the wildings (as a spy) and falling in love with Yigritte, Jon never forgot his Night\u2019s Watch vow as \u201cthe sword in the darkness\u201d and\u00a0\u201cthe shield that guards the realm of men\u201d.<br></p><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter\ncoming back from beyond the Wall and defeating the wildings\u2019 attack, Jon\nreceived an offer from Stannis to legitimize him and make him Lord of\nWinterfell if he bent the knee to Stannis and helped him take Winterfell from\nthe Boltons. The prospects of becoming Jon Stark, Lord of Winterfell excited\nhim as he confessed to Sam.\n\n\n\n<br></p><blockquote><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s\nthe first thing I ever remember wanting. I daydreamed that my father would ask\nthe king. Just like that I would never be the Bastard of Winterfell again. (Jon\nto Sam, 5x02)\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<br></p></blockquote><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the book, he even thought of what he would do\nwhen he is Lord of Winterfell, his father\u2019s heir. (It is not revealed in the\nshow, but I don\u2019t think that book!Jon and show!Jon would have different\nopinions in this regard.)\n\n\n\n<br></p><h2><i>Winterfell</i>,\nhe thought. <i>Theon left it burned and\nbroken, but <b>I could restore it</b>.</i> Surely his father would have wanted that,\nand Robb as well. They would never have wanted the castle left in ruins. \u00a0(Jon XII, A Storm of Swords)</h2><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever,\nJon still declined Stannis\u2019 offer and chose to uphold his Night\u2019s Watch\u2019s vow\nand only left the Night\u2019s Watch after being murdered by his \u201cbrothers\u201d. Believing that his Stark family was all dead and losing faith in his new family (the Night\u2019s Watch), Jon decided to flee South and find some warmth. But Sansa arrived at the Wall right at that moment. After years apart, the Starks finally started to get back together with a very emotional reunion.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"225\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fc565b829e5c88875f8443b06ae4586c/tumblr_pbd8aoN1DX1u034pso3_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"225\"></figure><p>Gif:\u00a0\n\n<a href=\"http://daenerys-stormborn.tumblr.com/post/175556170307\">daenerys-stormborn</a>\n\n</p><p>The two people who couldn\u2019t wait to leave Winterfell from the beginning to pursue their fantasies admitted to each other that they should never have left home in the first place <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvUfmgE5Ig4\">(6x04)</a>.</p><blockquote><p>Jon: We never should have left Winterfell.</p><p>Sansa: Don\u2019t you wish we could go back to the day we left?

I will quote some texts from the books (which have been adapted on screen or do not contradict with what introduced to us about the characters by the show) to have a better of understanding about the inner thoughts and motivations of the characters.<br /></p><h2><b>Bran</b></h2><h2>&ldquo;<b>Winterfell</b> had been the only home\nhe had ever known.&rdquo; (Bran II, A Game of Thrones)</h2><p>Among the Starklings, perhaps Bran\nis the most knowledgeable of the castle&rsquo;s architecture and its stories, and the \n\ntopography of&nbsp; the surrounding area. He is\nthe one who knows every little corner of Winterfell, even the most secretive\npart of it. \n\nAs the younger son, Bran didn&rsquo;t expect to inherit the ancestral home. His role is to become Robb&rsquo;s bannerman. But he had his own way to become lord of the castle. As he frequently climbed to Winterfell&rsquo;s rooftop, where he\nclaimed his &ldquo;second home&rdquo;, he saw the life of the castle, everyone, and\neverything.</p><blockquote><p>Bran could perch for hours among the shapeless, rain-worn gargoyles that brooded over the First Keep, watching it all: the men drilling with wood and steel in the yard, the cooks tending their vegetables in the glass garden, restless dogs running back and forth in the kennels, the silence of the godswood, the girls gossiping beside the washing well. It made him<b> feel like he was the lord of the castle, in a way even Robb would never know.</b>&nbsp;(Bran II, A Game of Thrones) <br /></p></blockquote><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9f943148709a0efda50c039ac7476dfc/tumblr_oxfxcalWWC1svpp7to4_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Gif:&nbsp;\n\n<a href=\"http://fuckyeahhousestark.tumblr.com/post/166146309590\">fuckyeahhousestark</a>\n\n</p><p>Even the crypts do not frighten\nBran. He feels like he is a part of it.<br /></p><blockquote><p>Their\nfootsteps echoed through the cavernous crypts. The shadows behind them\nswallowed his father as the shadows ahead retreated to unveil other statues; no\nmere lords, these, but the old Kings in the North. On their brows they wore\nstone crowns. [&hellip;] Their faces were stern and strong, and some of them had done\nterrible things, but they were <i>Starks</i>\neveryone, and Bran knew all their tales. <b>He had never feared the crypts; they\nwere part of his home and who he was, and he had always known that one day he\nwould lie here too.</b> (Bran VII, A Clash of Kings)</p></blockquote><p>Bran&rsquo;s happy childhood didn&rsquo;t last long. His life changed upside down after he was shoved from the tower by Jaime and lost his mobility. However, the worst was yet to come. Waking up from his coma, Bran was disappointed that his mother had left him, although she left to investigate the cause of his fall and to demand justice for him. Maester Luwin was surprised and couldn&rsquo;t answer the seemingly childlike question from Bran.</p><blockquote><p>Luwin: Your mother had to leave Winterfell to protect the family.</p><p>Bran: <b>How can she protect the family if she&rsquo;s not with her family?</b></p></blockquote><p>What happened after proved that Bran was actually reasonable. One cannot protect the family while he/she is not with the family. Robb left for war and Bran was assumed Lord of Winterfell in his stead. That was a huge responsibility for a cripple 10-year-old child. With the help from Maester Luwin, Bran took care of Winterfell and its people, showing great potentials to become a good lord.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9f54e9145f0e0905350b1bfac40b08ae/tumblr_oxfxcalWWC1svpp7to1_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Still, defending the whole North and Winterfell while the best Northern soldiers were going South with Robb was too much of a responsibility for a child.

Now he&rsquo;s back home but it&rsquo;s not yet safe. The Dead is marching on\nthem, and he bears the responsibility to face the Night King and save his home and humankind. As a child, Bran always dreamed to become a knight and was so devastated when he learned he could never walk again, meaning there was no chance to fulfilling his dream. But he might in the end be a knight in another way.&nbsp;<br /></p><blockquote><p>Benjen\nto Bran: You must learn to control it before the Night King comes.

For someone who knows and loves every inch of Winterfell, who knows\nall the story of the Starks before him, who endured so much pain and horror to\nbe back home and defend it, just to lose himself and become emotionless would\nrender the story totally bitter and quite meaningless.</p><blockquote><p>\n\nIt&rsquo;s not like he&rsquo;s not Bran anymore.

She\nrefused to complete her assignment of killing Lady Crane (note that the actress actually played Cersei, her number one enemey), knowing fully well\nthat the failed mission would risk her life. Later on, aware of the Frey women&rsquo;s innocence in the Red Wedding, she didn&rsquo;t let them drink the poisoned\nwine either. </p><p>\n\n Among the Stark kids, Arya has the highest risk of following Robb&rsquo;s footsteps since revenge has become her primary motivation for a considerable period of time. And as far as we know, blind vengeance only leads to self-destruction. And I hope that would not be the path for Arya.\n\n Her childhood was ruined by all the misfortunes happened to her family, forcing her to become a cold-blooded assassin. Winterfell and all the good memories of her family were the only lights in Arya&rsquo;s darkest days which prevent her from totally losing herself and the humanity that was left in her. Now she&rsquo;s home with her siblings, would the love in her heart eventually outgrow the hatred that she embraced for years?<br /></p><blockquote><p>\n\nThere&rsquo;s this split with Arya between trying to be <b>who she wants to be &mdash; getting back to back to that naivet&eacute; and innocence with her family</b> &mdash; and her unfinished business.

She\ndevelops a sense of empathy with the common people and is always ready to\ndefend the weak. Her path also led her to an encounter with the Lannister soldiers when she realized the soldiers were just common folks dragged into someone else&rsquo;s war.

I believe with all her experiences living among the commoners, Arya will finally realize that wars and revenge would not be the solution for Westeros. Would that be interesting if the person who is driven by revenge is the one who learns to forgive and actively seek out a way to end war for the benefit of the common people? Would that be meaningful if the person who is trained to bring death, to serve the Many-Faced God will end up fighting to save lives?</p><p>Arya knows that she can never be as good a lady (aka a ruler) as Sansa and she still need to figure out what she can do.</p><blockquote><p>I was never going to be as good as a lady as you.

As she declared before executing Littlefinger, she didn&rsquo;t want to execute him but she would do everything necessary to defend those matter most to her.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0cd39d51755d0d57e9cd5eb794543cb2/tumblr_inline_poknb6OQur1v86ltz_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s not what I want.

She has&nbsp;<b>evolved from a pawn to\na decisive player in the game</b>. Her diplomatic and political competency\ncould help to cement the political standings of the Starks in Westeros. Learning from Robb&rsquo;s mistakes, Sansa understood the importance of listening to people&rsquo;s concerns and find ways to make everyone work together instead of purely using laws, order and punishment to make them submit.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e7e9ab868789f793ee6df4107844ccc5/tumblr_inline_oxu896h55A1v4fp6z_400.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Besides, Sansa has demonstrated that she possesses excellent administrative skills which are very helpful to\neffectively run the kingdom. Arya herself admitted she would never as good a lady as Sansa (7x07). It&rsquo;s now time for Sansa to step up and become a leader in her own right. Perhaps, among the Starklings, Sansa is now the one who is most sure of herself and what she wants: &ldquo;peace and quiet&rdquo;; Jon, Arya and Bran all back to her; safety for her family and her people. And perhaps in season 8, she would also realize that the dream of having a happy family of her own that mirrors her parents&rsquo; is not just a stupid dream after all. It&rsquo;s real and it&rsquo;s something worth fighting for.<br /></p><blockquote><p><b>Sansa really comes into her own</b> this season. She knows what she wants. She knows what she stands for.

Back in season 1, Jon\nwas eager to leave home to become a brother of the Night&rsquo;s Watch like his Uncle\nBenjen, whom he admired. Before he left, his &ldquo;father&rdquo; reminded him that manning\nthe Wall is a Starks&rsquo; duty for thousands of years and that he had a Stark blood\ndespite not bearing the Stark name.</p><blockquote><p>There&rsquo;s great honor serving in the Night&rsquo;s Watch. The Starks have manned the Wall for thousands of years. And <b>you are a Stark</b>. You might not have my name, but you have my blood. (Ned to Jon, 1x02)&nbsp;</p></blockquote><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/53257eecb9243722098bf617c973aa6c/tumblr_inline_pl1klxM64P1v86ltz_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Being a &ldquo;bastard&rdquo;, Jon wanted to find ways to prove himself to his father. He might have chosen the Night&rsquo;s Watch, a duty that the Starks have borne for thousands of years, and aspired to become a ranger like Uncle Benjen to make his father proud. He longed for the same attention his father granted Robb.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>I was jealous of Robb my whole life. The way my Father looked at him. I wanted that. (Jon to Sam, 4x01)</p></blockquote><p><b>Jon&rsquo;s deepest fear is rejection</b>, that he is not a Stark. In his nightmares, he saw himself running through in an empty Winterfell to the crypts.</p><blockquote><p>And then I find myself in front of the door to the crypts. It&rsquo;s black inside, and I can see the steps spiraling down. Somehow I know I have to go down there, but I don&rsquo;t want to. I&rsquo;m afraid of what might be waiting for me. The old Kings of Winter are down there, sitting on their thrones with stone wolves at their feet and iron swords across their laps, but it&rsquo;s not them I&rsquo;m afraid of. <b>I scream that I&rsquo;m not a Stark, that this isn&rsquo;t my place, but it&rsquo;s no good, I have to go anyway</b>, do I start down, feeling the walls as I descend, with no torch to light the way. (Jon IV, A Game of Thrones)</p></blockquote><p><b>Being recognized as a Stark is Jon&rsquo;s biggest passion</b>. He loves and adores&nbsp;Ned and in his wildest dream, he dreamed that his father would place Ice in his hand.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>When Jon had been Bran&rsquo;s age, he had dreamed of doing great deeds, as boys always did. The details of his feats changed with every dreaming, but quite often he imagined saving his father&rsquo;s life. Afterward, <b>Lord Eddard would declare that Jon had proved himself a true Stark, and place Ice in his hand. </b>Even then he had known it was only a child&rsquo;s folly; no bastard could ever hope to wield a father&rsquo;s sword. (Jon VIII, A Game of Thrones)\n\n</p></blockquote><p>Even after Lord Mormont gave him Long Claw, an honor that no bastard could dare dream of, here was what Jon thought.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><i>He (Lord Mormont) is not my father. </i>The thought leapt unbidden to Jon&rsquo;s mind. <i><b>Lord Eddard Stark is my father.</b> I will not forget him, no matter how many swords they give me. </i>(Jon VIII, A Game of Thrones)</p></blockquote><p>Upon\nlearning about Ned&rsquo;s death, Jon decided to leave the Night&rsquo;s Watch to join Robb\navenging their father. He hoped that Robb would take him in and he would have\nchance fight those who murdered his father on the battlefield. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</p><blockquote><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJon\nwas not afraid of death, but he did not want to die like that, trussed and\nbound and beheaded like a common brigand. If he must perish, let it be with a\nsword in his hand, fighting his father&rsquo;s killers. <b>He was no true Stark, had\nnever been one &hellip; but he could die like one.</b> <b>Let them say that Eddard Stark had\nfathered four sons, not three.</b>&nbsp;(Jon IX, A Game of Thrones)&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>His comrades intercepted and convinced him to stay. The next day, Lord Commander Mormont told Jon that fighting the White Walkers to protect the living is more important than the wars of the lords. Jon then swore to Mormont that he would not attempt to desert again and joined the mission beyond the Wall. Since then, the Night&rsquo;s Watch became his family, Castle Black became his home and &ldquo;guarding the realm of men&rdquo; is his sole mission. Even when he was living among the wildings (as a spy) and falling in love with Yigritte, Jon never forgot his Night&rsquo;s Watch vow as &ldquo;the sword in the darkness&rdquo; and&nbsp;&ldquo;the shield that guards the realm of men&rdquo;.<br /></p><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter\ncoming back from beyond the Wall and defeating the wildings&rsquo; attack, Jon\nreceived an offer from Stannis to legitimize him and make him Lord of\nWinterfell if he bent the knee to Stannis and helped him take Winterfell from\nthe Boltons. The prospects of becoming Jon Stark, Lord of Winterfell excited\nhim as he confessed to Sam.\n\n\n\n<br /></p><blockquote><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt&rsquo;s\nthe first thing I ever remember wanting. I daydreamed that my father would ask\nthe king. Just like that I would never be the Bastard of Winterfell again. (Jon\nto Sam, 5x02)&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></p></blockquote><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the book, he even thought of what he would do\nwhen he is Lord of Winterfell, his father&rsquo;s heir. (It is not revealed in the\nshow, but I don&rsquo;t think that book!Jon and show!Jon would have different\nopinions in this regard.)\n\n\n\n<br /></p><h2><i>Winterfell</i>,\nhe thought. <i>Theon left it burned and\nbroken, but <b>I could restore it</b>.</i> Surely his father would have wanted that,\nand Robb as well. They would never have wanted the castle left in ruins. &nbsp;(Jon XII, A Storm of Swords)</h2><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever,\nJon still declined Stannis&rsquo; offer and chose to uphold his Night&rsquo;s Watch&rsquo;s vow\nand only left the Night&rsquo;s Watch after being murdered by his &ldquo;brothers&rdquo;. Believing that his Stark family was all dead and losing faith in his new family (the Night&rsquo;s Watch), Jon decided to flee South and find some warmth. But Sansa arrived at the Wall right at that moment. After years apart, the Starks finally started to get back together with a very emotional reunion.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fc565b829e5c88875f8443b06ae4586c/tumblr_pbd8aoN1DX1u034pso3_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Gif:&nbsp;\n\n<a href=\"http://daenerys-stormborn.tumblr.com/post/175556170307\">daenerys-stormborn</a>\n\n</p><p>The two people who couldn&rsquo;t wait to leave Winterfell from the beginning to pursue their fantasies admitted to each other that they should never have left home in the first place <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvUfmgE5Ig4\">(6x04)</a>.</p><blockquote><p>Jon: We never should have left Winterfell.</p><p>Sansa: Don&rsquo;t you wish we could go back to the day we left?

It&rsquo;s ours, and Arya&rsquo;s, and Bran&rsquo;s and Rickon&rsquo;s, wherever they are. It belongs to our family. We have to fight for it.&rdquo; (Sansa to Jon, 6x04)</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>Home is the place where their paths finally converge</b>. It was a promise from the beginning.<br /></p>\n<h2>&ldquo;Different roads sometimes lead to the same castle.&rdquo;&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>(Jon to Arya, Jon II, A Game of Thrones)</p>\n<figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2d50f9d0804ab60e172d79dea88adebc/tumblr_o7vf5qUi7s1s6bxzqo5_r4_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>\n\nGif: &nbsp;<a href=\"http://makebeliever.tumblr.com/post/145040805649\">makebeliever</a> \n\n<br /></p>\n<hr />\n<h2><b>Coming home to know who they are and who to fight for</b></h2>\n<p>In this part, we will have a brief look on the homecoming journeys of the Starklings and elaborate how their arcs mean for their future development and the restoration of House Stark. I will quote some texts from the books (which have been adapted on screen or do not contradict with what introduced to us about the characters by the show) to have a better of understanding about the inner thoughts and motivations of the characters.<br /></p>\n</p>",
