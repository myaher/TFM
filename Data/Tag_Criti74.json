So I combined <a href=\"https://theres-no-comma.tumblr.com/post/183903297832\" target=\"_blank\">all</a> <a href=\"https://theres-no-comma.tumblr.com/post/183903676857/combining-two-of-those-together-its-fascinating\" target=\"_blank\">these</a> <a href=\"https://theres-no-comma.tumblr.com/post/183904481782/do-we-have-any-strong-elemental-associations-with\" target=\"_blank\">posts</a> and edited them, so here\u2019s my combined thoughts about (western) elemental symbolism and our favorite group of assholes</p><!-- more --><p>Okay, so first off, is <b>Yasha</b>; I really think about <b>air </b>with her. Yes, we have her wings but also you\u2019ve got her trips away. Really I think it\u2019s interesting, how she\u2019s always been a traveller. Living in the Moorlands rather than a city, then her stay with a Circus, and now she\u2019s part of the Nein- an adventuring party. If we assume her Tribe lived in a village (which I think Jester said and Yasha didn\u2019t correct her) and Zuala was her rock, after the death (destruction) of her grounding, she got extra flighty (Lost time, leaving Xhorhas, worshiping the Lord of <i>Storms</i>). Then, she found another person that grounded her- Molly, and the Circus (\u201cShe always comes back\u201d). Now, she has another anchor- the Mighty Nein.</p><p>There\u2019s also a fun thought with her being an Aasimar, a distinctly <i>celestial</i> being, associated (generally) with the sky, <i>upwards</i>, but a <i>fallen Aasimar</i>, which could be construed as a connection to <b>earth</b>. (Some of her other earth connections: Zuala\u2019s grave, the flower collections). <br/></p><hr><p>Then, <b>Jester</b>. The obvious choice would be <b>water</b>, right? Blue, lived on the coast, very likely her Father is a <i>water genasi</i>, her Mother\u2019s the Ruby of the <i>Sea</i>. However, I\u2019m not just here for aesthetics. Her personality really rings <b>fire </b>to me. Her trickery, her passion, her <i>warmth </i>towards most everyone she meets, just how <i>wild </i>she is. (All of this could also be attributed to air, as well). Also, she doesn\u2019t seem to be the type to hold grudges? Maybe I\u2019ve got this pegged wrong, but when she gets mad it generally burns hot and then burns out quick. (Her anger at Caleb during the Cave Fight, and then her attitude afterwards when she realizes he was mind-spelled)</p><p>A quick note though, is how well two opposing elements fit her- water, fire. It\u2019s so perfect that the trickster is made of opposites.</p><hr><p><b>Nott</b>, of course, is <b>water</b>. Her drinking, her phobia, and, as we later learn, Nott was basically <i>born </i>from the water- her drowning in the river. But then, we learn about Veth (time for backstory speculation!) Who was born in Felderwin, the agricultural center of the Empire, if I\u2019m recalling accurately. We can make a fair inference that her family was that of farmers, or else worked the land in some way. Veth goes on to become an alchemist, and while that\u2019s not as blatantly related to the <b>earth </b>as farming, it is still connected to the land- knowledge of plants, for one. </p><p>So, if we decide <i>Veth = earth</i> and <i>Nott = water</i>, you have some erosion imagery that\u2019s pretty powerful, especially with how Nott believes that \u201cVeth\u201d is slowly slipping away from her (Couldn\u2019t remember Luke\u2019s face), how Nott is becoming more and more goblin-like; it\u2019s a steady erasure, like the tide on the sand. <br/></p><hr><p><b>Caleb</b>! My dirty, dirty trash son. I think y\u2019all know what the deal is here, <b>fire</b>. Now, strap in, because we\u2019re going for another ride on the speculation-about-past-lives train here: Bren? Total, total fire. From what I can decipher from Liams bread<i>crumbs</i>, Bren was a child prodigy, a little spark of ambition and smarts- and the symbolism of Bren as a spark that becomes a flame that burns itself out as a metaphor for his journey through the Academy is somethin\u2019 else; in fact, if you\u2019ll allow me a bit of extended metaphor: Bren, a spark, lit by the Academy and Trent, shining brightly, killing his parents and burning out, his time in the Asylum as a pile of ashes. </p><p>Speaking of, ashes let us segue nicely into Caleb\u2019s connection with <b>earth</b>. How, in particular, he finds comfort in it- literally smearing himself with mud to sever any connections between him and Bren that others may see, how attached he is to Nott, his best friend, his <i>rock</i>. I fully believe that if Caleb cleaned up, shed the earth and stepped fully back into his fire, he\u2019d turn heads- 16 charisma, like moths to a <i>flame</i>. (Yeah, this got a little poetic, this is what happens when you let english nerds rhapsodize about symbolism).</p><hr><p>Now, <b>Beau</b>, Beau is difficult because we know so little about her backstory, compared to the others. Really, all we got (from what she\u2019s both said and implied) is that she was rich, or at least upper middle class, had abusive parents, is gay, does crimes. You could make a case for <b>earth</b>- her loyalty to her friends, her stubbornness, how persistent she is in her search for information, patient defense, and her \u201cI&hellip;wait,\u201d scene. </p><p>Mostly though, I\u2019m going with air. She\u2019s a <i>monk</i>. Her speed, her acrobatics, how averse (in the early episodes at least, hoorah for character growth!) she was to getting attached. I saw someone put it well in a different post I can\u2019t find for the life of me- \u201cI\u2019ll be friends but only \u2018cause <i>you </i>want to be friends\u201d. (Again, this contrasts well with her current attitude towards her friends, how steadfast she is in her support of them, +2 for earth). Another point for air is her mentality about relationships, how she\u2019s a one night stand only kind of girl, \u201cno strings attached\u201d.</p><hr><p><b>Caduceus </b>is another kinder egg character, to use a term I\u2019ve just made up. He\u2019s got super obvious connections on the outside, but he\u2019s also got hidden connections that aren\u2019t actually that hard to find. Anyway! <b>Earth</b>! Obviously! He comes from a family of, essentially, gravediggers, he drinks dead people tea, lived in the middle of the literal fucking woods, worships the Wildmother (I know she also lords over the sea as well as the land, but he primarily has a connection to the woods, okay). </p><p>Also, I know there are a fair amount of Party Therapist jokes, but for real he does act in a grounding capacity to most of the party. He\u2019s very steady, from his worldview to the literal timbre of his voice. (Gravelly. <i>Gravelly </i>voice.)</p><hr><p>Now, <b>Fjord</b>. The thing about my good good green bastard boi, is that he\u2019s <i>the</i> <b>water </b>guy. He grew up in <i>Port </i>Damali, became a <i>sailor</i>, is a warlock of Uk\u2019otoa, a <i>sea serpent demi-god who rules the sea</i>, etc etc. Recently, however, we\u2019ve seen him take (teeny, tiny) steps away from that. His &amp; Caduceus\u2019 conversation made me think about this, and while one conversation does not a parallel make, there is something to be said for another person who\u2019s trauma relates to water (team drowning victims!) seeking comfort in <b>earth</b>. His conversation with Caduceus brings up the possibility of allying himself with Melora. As mentioned above, while she does technically have domain over the sea (the lighthouse), we\u2019ve mostly seen her as she relates to earth. <br/></p><hr><p>Last, but not least, Mr Obnoxious One himself, <b>Molly</b>. For him, I see a very strong case for <b>air</b>. He was essentially born from the earth, but that almost- seems like the remnants of Lucien (spec-u-lation-!). Lucien, the cult leader, who was presumably, if not trusted by, relied on, by the other cult members, given Cree\u2019s reaction. Molly waking up and immediately wandering <i>away </i>is his first move. </p><p>He joins the Circus, as close to as home as you can get without actually putting down roots- anyone can leave the Circus, it could get disbanded, new acts are being thought up, discarded, changed. They are traveling to new places all the time, putting on acts, masks, whatever faces they need to sell tickets. His friendship with Yasha, aasimar and Stormlord follower. </p><p>If we associate Lucien with earth, stability, roots, Molly\u2019s attitude to learning anything about that can be summed up with Fuck No. (There\u2019s also his peacock/bird imagery.)</p>",

Yes, we have her wings but also you\u2019ve got her trips away. Really I think it\u2019s interesting, how she\u2019s always been a traveller. Living in the Moorlands rather than a city, then her stay with a Circus, and now she\u2019s part of the Nein- an adventuring party. If we assume her Tribe lived in a village (which I think Jester said and Yasha didn\u2019t correct her) and Zuala was her rock, after the death (destruction) of her grounding, she got extra flighty (Lost time, leaving Xhorhas, worshiping the Lord of <i>Storms</i>). Then, she found another person that grounded her- Molly, and the Circus (\u201cShe always comes back\u201d). Now, she has another anchor- the Mighty Nein.</p><p>There\u2019s also a fun thought with her being an Aasimar, a distinctly <i>celestial</i> being, associated (generally) with the sky, <i>upwards</i>, but a <i>fallen Aasimar</i>, which could be construed as a connection to <b>earth</b>. (Some of her other earth connections: Zuala\u2019s grave, the flower collections). <br></p><hr><p>Then, <b>Jester</b>. The obvious choice would be <b>water</b>, right? Blue, lived on the coast, very likely her Father is a <i>water genasi</i>, her Mother\u2019s the Ruby of the <i>Sea</i>. However, I\u2019m not just here for aesthetics. Her personality really rings <b>fire </b>to me. Her trickery, her passion, her <i>warmth </i>towards most everyone she meets, just how <i>wild </i>she is. (All of this could also be attributed to air, as well). Also, she doesn\u2019t seem to be the type to hold grudges? Maybe I\u2019ve got this pegged wrong, but when she gets mad it generally burns hot and then burns out quick. (Her anger at Caleb during the Cave Fight, and then her attitude afterwards when she realizes he was mind-spelled)</p><p>A quick note though, is how well two opposing elements fit her- water, fire. It\u2019s so perfect that the trickster is made of opposites.</p><hr><p><b>Nott</b>, of course, is <b>water</b>. Her drinking, her phobia, and, as we later learn, Nott was basically <i>born </i>from the water- her drowning in the river. But then, we learn about Veth (time for backstory speculation!) Who was born in Felderwin, the agricultural center of the Empire, if I\u2019m recalling accurately. We can make a fair inference that her family was that of farmers, or else worked the land in some way. Veth goes on to become an alchemist, and while that\u2019s not as blatantly related to the <b>earth </b>as farming, it is still connected to the land- knowledge of plants, for one. </p><p>So, if we decide <i>Veth = earth</i> and <i>Nott = water</i>, you have some erosion imagery that\u2019s pretty powerful, especially with how Nott believes that \u201cVeth\u201d is slowly slipping away from her (Couldn\u2019t remember Luke\u2019s face), how Nott is becoming more and more goblin-like; it\u2019s a steady erasure, like the tide on the sand. <br></p><hr><p><b>Caleb</b>! My dirty, dirty trash son. I think y\u2019all know what the deal is here, <b>fire</b>. Now, strap in, because we\u2019re going for another ride on the speculation-about-past-lives train here: Bren? Total, total fire. From what I can decipher from Liams bread<i>crumbs</i>, Bren was a child prodigy, a little spark of ambition and smarts- and the symbolism of Bren as a spark that becomes a flame that burns itself out as a metaphor for his journey through the Academy is somethin\u2019 else; in fact, if you\u2019ll allow me a bit of extended metaphor: Bren, a spark, lit by the Academy and Trent, shining brightly, killing his parents and burning out, his time in the Asylum as a pile of ashes. </p><p>Speaking of, ashes let us segue nicely into Caleb\u2019s connection with <b>earth</b>. How, in particular, he finds comfort in it- literally smearing himself with mud to sever any connections between him and Bren that others may see, how attached he is to Nott, his best friend, his <i>rock</i>. I fully believe that if Caleb cleaned up, shed the earth and stepped fully back into his fire, he\u2019d turn heads- 16 charisma, like moths to a <i>flame</i>. (Yeah, this got a little poetic, this is what happens when you let english nerds rhapsodize about symbolism).</p><hr><p>Now, <b>Beau</b>, Beau is difficult because we know so little about her backstory, compared to the others. Really, all we got (from what she\u2019s both said and implied) is that she was rich, or at least upper middle class, had abusive parents, is gay, does crimes. You could make a case for <b>earth</b>- her loyalty to her friends, her stubbornness, how persistent she is in her search for information, patient defense, and her \u201cI\u2026wait,\u201d scene. </p><p>Mostly though, I\u2019m going with air. She\u2019s a <i>monk</i>. Her speed, her acrobatics, how averse (in the early episodes at least, hoorah for character growth!) she was to getting attached. I saw someone put it well in a different post I can\u2019t find for the life of me- \u201cI\u2019ll be friends but only \u2018cause <i>you </i>want to be friends\u201d. (Again, this contrasts well with her current attitude towards her friends, how steadfast she is in her support of them, +2 for earth). Another point for air is her mentality about relationships, how she\u2019s a one night stand only kind of girl, \u201cno strings attached\u201d.</p><hr><p><b>Caduceus </b>is another kinder egg character, to use a term I\u2019ve just made up. He\u2019s got super obvious connections on the outside, but he\u2019s also got hidden connections that aren\u2019t actually that hard to find. Anyway! <b>Earth</b>! Obviously! He comes from a family of, essentially, gravediggers, he drinks dead people tea, lived in the middle of the literal fucking woods, worships the Wildmother (I know she also lords over the sea as well as the land, but he primarily has a connection to the woods, okay). </p><p>Also, I know there are a fair amount of Party Therapist jokes, but for real he does act in a grounding capacity to most of the party. He\u2019s very steady, from his worldview to the literal timbre of his voice. (Gravelly. <i>Gravelly </i>voice.)</p><hr><p>Now, <b>Fjord</b>. The thing about my good good green bastard boi, is that he\u2019s <i>the</i> <b>water </b>guy. He grew up in <i>Port </i>Damali, became a <i>sailor</i>, is a warlock of Uk\u2019otoa, a <i>sea serpent demi-god who rules the sea</i>, etc etc. Recently, however, we\u2019ve seen him take (teeny, tiny) steps away from that. His &amp; Caduceus\u2019 conversation made me think about this, and while one conversation does not a parallel make, there is something to be said for another person who\u2019s trauma relates to water (team drowning victims!) seeking comfort in <b>earth</b>. His conversation with Caduceus brings up the possibility of allying himself with Melora. As mentioned above, while she does technically have domain over the sea (the lighthouse), we\u2019ve mostly seen her as she relates to earth. <br></p><hr><p>Last, but not least, Mr Obnoxious One himself, <b>Molly</b>. For him, I see a very strong case for <b>air</b>. He was essentially born from the earth, but that almost- seems like the remnants of Lucien (spec-u-lation-!).
