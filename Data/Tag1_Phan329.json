Phil starts out as a regular passerby, until an intervention from his dog gets them talking. Dan talks in plant metaphors, which slowly becomes something that Phil can\u2019t get enough of.</p><p><b>Warnings:</b> body issues, gender dysphoria, gender stereotypes, minor injuries, mild depression, a little smut, slight angst, blood mentions</p><p><b>Chapters: </b>3/15</p><p><b>Word Count (this chapter):</b> 2.1k</p><p><b>A/N: </b>Hope you enjoy chapter 3!

Thor didn\u2019t mind the rain too much; he\u2019d just shake it off all over Phil\u2019s floor when they got home. Phil would wear a coat, maybe take an umbrella. He didn\u2019t enjoy the rain as much as Thor, but being out in the bad weather certainly felt like he was doing something badass, almost mysterious.</p><p>Phil never expected to find Dan gardening on such a rainy Monday. He had always presumed it to be a weather-dependant activity, but here Dan was, dressed fully in waterproofs, still working on the garden.</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cDan!?\u201d Phil greeted them, surprised. \u201cYou still work when its raining!?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well I can\u2019t cut the grass, but there\u2019s other things needing done,\u201d Dan explained. \u201cI won\u2019t be working so many hours so I\u2019ll charge less, but this is the one job I do my best not to cancel on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so wet; are you sure this is a good idea?\u201d Phil asked, concerned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Dan insisted, a contradictory cold shiver wracking its way through their body.</p><p>\u201cYou look freezing,\u201d Phil told them. \u201cAt least make sure you have a hot shower when you get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes mum,\u201d Dan said, sounding slightly irritable, their eyebrows forming into a frown.</p><p>Phil tried to warm Dan\u2019s heart a little, talking to him for a while and letting him play with a soggy Thor. Phil didn\u2019t stay as long as he usually would, but he had a reason for that. Phil planned to buy both himself and Dan a hot chocolate in the town, then return to the garden to give Dan one, and maybe drink them together.</p><p>Phil and Thor made their way to the town centre where Phil tied Thor up under a tree, hoping it would give him a little bit of shelter. He felt bad for leaving his dog like that, but he\u2019d give Thor a treat to make up for it later, once they were home. He stepped into the cafe and took his place in the queue behind the person already at the counter. When they were finished with their transaction, Phil stepped forward, ordering two regular hot chocolates to take away. Whilst he would sometimes indulge in cream and marshmallows, they always got stuck in the lid of takeaway cups, so he went for the perfectly good standard hot chocolate.</p><p>When Phil finally had a carrier tray of two hot chocolates in his hand, he stepped back out into the rain. He quickly set about untying Thor, slipping the leash onto the same hand as he held his umbrella, not wanting to risk spilling the hot chocolates.</p><p>Doubling back to see Dan again was a change from Phil and Thor\u2019s usual route, but with today\u2019s weather, taking Dan a hot chocolate seemed like a necessity. He fed Thor a treat, and the two of them headed off, hurrying through the rain, Phil somehow managing to juggle the Thor\u2019s lead, the umbrella and the hot chocolate.</p><p>Dan hadn\u2019t got that far when Phil returned; they were a little further along the front flowerbed, but as they pulled a weed, Phil could see their hands shaking. The rain was running off Dan\u2019s hood and dripping on their face, small rivulets of water trickling down like tears.</p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d Phil said, announcing his presence, \u201cI brought you hot chocolate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d Dan said, looking up in surprise, \u201cFor me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, for you,\u201d Phil nodded, smiling and holding out one of the cups to Dan. \u201cTake a break for a minute and drink it, okay? You look freezing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Dan smiled, taking the hot chocolate, \u201cThank you so much.\u201d</p><p>Dan wrapped both their hands around the hot chocolate and tentatively took a sip. After determining it was a perfectly drinkable temperature, they took another, bigger sip, their smile growing with the realisation of how nice a hot chocolate this was.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good,\u201d Dan smiled at Phil, \u201cReally good. Thank you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, honestly,\u201d Phil smiled, \u201cI was thinking about getting one myself, then when I saw you shivering by the rhododendron, I knew I needed to make it two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do I owe you?\u201d Dan asked, looking up at Phil with wide eyes wide, their voice a little quiet and unsure.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Phil said, slightly shocked, smiling down at Dan. \u201cIt\u2019s on me, a present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Dan said, brushing some water away from under their eye, \u201cUhh, d\u2019you want to come sit in my van for bit while we drink these?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be nice,\u201d Phil said, happy for an excuse to get out of the rain.</p><p>Dan got themself up and started to head along towards their van, Phil following on the pavement side of the flowerbed. They met at the driveway, where Dan\u2019s van was parked. Dan opened the passenger door for Phil and hurried him and Thor inside before getting in their own side.</p><p>The dryness of the van was quite a relief from the steady pelting rain outside. Both Dan and Phil fell quiet for a moment, listening to the rain drumming on the van\u2019s metal roof, sipping on their hot chocolates. The peace would never last though, not with Thor around - who, after a few moments in the dry, decided it was time to shake all the drips off. He had a lesser amount of fur to shake out than some dogs, but still, he managed to cover Dan and Phil with lots of little droplets of water.</p><p>\u201cThor,\u201d Phil scolded, blinking some water out of his eye, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Dan, brushing some wet dog spray from their own face, laughed at Phil\u2019s attempt to tell Thor off, \u201cIt\u2019s okay; my van is full of mud anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhh still, I\u2019m sorry for him contributing it,\u201d Phil apologised, glancing at Thor with another look of disapproval.</p><p>\u201cHonestly, it\u2019s fine. It makes the van feel loved; he\u2019s the first dog friend I\u2019ve had in here\u2026\u201d Dan insisted, a sheepish smile forming as they continued, \u201cAnd you\u2019re the first human friend, as it happens.\u201d</p><p>Phil felt honoured to be classed as a friend, and even more so to be the first friend in Dan\u2019s van. He watched Dan take another sip of their hot chocolate, still shivering slightly, but looking like they had a little colour in their face now. Phil too was feeling warmed by the drink, and now also by Dan\u2019s van. The conversation moved on from Thor\u2019s shaking habits and the cleanliness of the van to other things. </p><p>They found it pretty easy to talk to each other, both having similar interests in video games and in music. Even their schedules aligned to some extent: Phil worked from Tuesday to Saturday and Dan from Monday to Friday, and their hours were more or less the same. This interested Phil; he enjoyed Dan\u2019s company and wondered if they\u2019d be able to get together sometime, outside of Dan\u2019s work.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Dan, realising that they were slowly letting Phil into their life, made the decision that it would be wise to open up about their gender identity, at least a little. Dan knew that their gender presentation was confusing to others and it was something they felt they could tell Phil, this amazingly kind man with an adorable corgi.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably wondering about me,\u201d Dan started slowly, a little hesitant about how to have this conversation, as it wasn\u2019t one they\u2019d ever had with someone they\u2019d just met.</p><p>\u201cAbout?\u201d Phil asked, not sure what Dan was going to tell him.</p><p>\u201cAbout like my gender and stuff?\u201d Dan said quietly, words almost blending into the steady thrumming of the rain. \u201cPeople either take me for a lesbian, or a prepubescent boy, or sometimes they\u2019re just confused?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in the confused category, I guess, but, like, it doesn\u2019t exactly matter to me,\u201d Phil said. \u201cYou seem a pretty cool person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Dan laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s what I like to hear. To be honest. I\u2026 I\u2019d rather not have a gender, like I don\u2019t feel like a man or a woman, if you get what I mean?\u201d</p><p>Phil looked curious so Dan continued with his explanation, \u201cYou know about transgender people, right? I\u2019m kind of like that in a way; I feel some of the same dislike of my body. I was assigned female at birth, but that\u2019s not me. In some ways, I\u2019d like to be more like a man. I\u2019d love to be flat chested, I\u2019d like to have a deeper voice, but there\u2019s other aspects I wouldn\u2019t like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a word for how you identify?\u201d Phil asked, knowing a lot of LGBTQ+ terminology but not wanting to put Dan under the wrong one.</p><p>\u201cAgender,\u201d Dan smiled, his voice now soft and steady. \u201cI\u2019m an agender gardener who identifies more strongly with plants than most people. I\u2019m a mystic illusion, my friend, but sometimes being different is a good thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d Phil nodded, \u201cI could tell you were different when I first spoke to you, but that intrigued me more than anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d Dan smiled, relaxing into the seat a little. \u201cAnd you intrigue me too. Like what do you do for a living? If you don\u2019t mind me asking? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s something you\u2019ve spoken about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a video editor; I work for a company but the work is kind of flexible, letting me work at home some of the time,\u201d Phil explained. \u201cI\u2019m usually in the office Tuesday through Friday, but it depends on the job\u2026 and Saturdays I work from home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s pretty cool,\u201d Dan said, \u201cSo d\u2019you make films or adverts or music videos or what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOther companies pay us to make promotional stuff, and yeah sometimes we work with smaller musicians to produce music videos,\u201d Phil explained, gesticulating as he tried to give Dan a gist of what he did. \u201cI try to make short films as a hobby, but they\u2019re nothing special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo with being agender, do you go by \u2018they\u2019?\u201d Phil asked, returning the conversation to the topic of Dan\u2019s gender as he thought of this question. \u201cI\u2019d like to get this right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Dan nodded, \u201cLike, I won\u2019t get too offended if people call me \u2018she\u2019 or \u2018he\u2019 because I\u2019m used to it, but they/them/their are the only pronouns that feel right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Phil said smiling, \u201cI think I can manage that. I\u2019m not exactly used to it, but I\u2019ll do my absolute best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Dan laughed, \u201cBut thank you!\u201d</p><p>As the two finished off their hot chocolates, the conversation slowly died down, the thoughts of returning to the outdoors suddenly taking over.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better get back to work,\u201d Dan said, a little sadly, placing their cup in a cup holder by the gear stick.</p><p>\u201cHow long are you gonna be stuck out in this for?\u201d Phil asked, concerned. \u201cWhen do you finish work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do nine to twelve and two to four usually,\u201d Dan explained, \u201cBut today I\u2019m just going to work hard up to lunch time and then call it a day; I think the weather\u2019s to get worse later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll see you next week probably, but look after yourself, yeah? You\u2019ll have a hot shower or something when you get home, right?\u201d Phil said, genuinely concerned about Dan staying out in this weather, even if only for another hour or two.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Dan smiled, \u201cI\u2019ll probably have a hot bath and some soup and then stay in for the afternoon doing my finances. And yes, I\u2019ll be here next week if you want to drop by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be walking Thor, as always,\u201d Phil nodded. \u201cWill you be free after work next Monday? I was wondering if you wanted to go for coffee sometime?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext Monday? Yeah, I will be,\u201d Dan smiled, \u201cSounds good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Phil smiled, \u201cWe\u2019ll I\u2019ll see you next Monday morning when I walk Thor; we can confirm the details then.\u201d</p><p>With that, the two humans and their four-legged friend prepared to step back out into the rain and get on with their lives. The van had provided a warm, comfortable environment for them to enjoy their hot drinks, but that goodness had to come to an end. They would see each other again soon; like a flower which blooms again, the joy of being together would return.</p><hr><p><a href=\"https://philsdrill.tumblr.com/post/176994463713/chapter-4-let-me-water-that-growing-feeling\">\n\nNext Chapter =&gt;</a><br/></p>",

You\u2019ll have a hot shower or something when you get home, right?\u201d Phil said, genuinely concerned about Dan staying out in this weather, even if only for another hour or two.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Dan smiled, \u201cI\u2019ll probably have a hot bath and some soup and then stay in for the afternoon doing my finances. And yes, I\u2019ll be here next week if you want to drop by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be walking Thor, as always,\u201d Phil nodded. \u201cWill you be free after work next Monday?

Yeah, I will be,\u201d Dan smiled, \u201cSounds good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Phil smiled, \u201cWe\u2019ll I\u2019ll see you next Monday morning when I walk Thor; we can confirm the details then.\u201d</p><p>With that, the two humans and their four-legged friend prepared to step back out into the rain and get on with their lives.

Thor didn\u2019t mind the rain too much; he\u2019d just shake it off all over Phil\u2019s floor when they got home. Phil would wear a coat, maybe take an umbrella. He didn\u2019t enjoy the rain as much as Thor, but being out in the bad weather certainly felt like he was doing something badass, almost mysterious.</p><p>Phil never expected to find Dan gardening on such a rainy Monday. He had always presumed it to be a weather-dependant activity, but here Dan was, dressed fully in waterproofs, still working on the garden.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cDan!?\u201d Phil greeted them, surprised. \u201cYou still work when its raining!?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well I can\u2019t cut the grass, but there\u2019s other things needing done,\u201d Dan explained. \u201cI won\u2019t be working so many hours so I\u2019ll charge less, but this is the one job I do my best not to cancel on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so wet; are you sure this is a good idea?\u201d Phil asked, concerned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Dan insisted, a contradictory cold shiver wracking its way through their body.</p><p>\u201cYou look freezing,\u201d Phil told them. \u201cAt least make sure you have a hot shower when you get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes mum,\u201d Dan said, sounding slightly irritable, their eyebrows forming into a frown.</p><p>Phil tried to warm Dan\u2019s heart a little, talking to him for a while and letting him play with a soggy Thor. Phil didn\u2019t stay as long as he usually would, but he had a reason for that. Phil planned to buy both himself and Dan a hot chocolate in the town, then return to the garden to give Dan one, and maybe drink them together.</p><p>Phil and Thor made their way to the town centre where Phil tied Thor up under a tree, hoping it would give him a little bit of shelter. He felt bad for leaving his dog like that, but he\u2019d give Thor a treat to make up for it later, once they were home. He stepped into the cafe and took his place in the queue behind the person already at the counter. When they were finished with their transaction, Phil stepped forward, ordering two regular hot chocolates to take away. Whilst he would sometimes indulge in cream and marshmallows, they always got stuck in the lid of takeaway cups, so he went for the perfectly good standard hot chocolate.</p><p>When Phil finally had a carrier tray of two hot chocolates in his hand, he stepped back out into the rain. He quickly set about untying Thor, slipping the leash onto the same hand as he held his umbrella, not wanting to risk spilling the hot chocolates.</p><p>Doubling back to see Dan again was a change from Phil and Thor\u2019s usual route, but with today\u2019s weather, taking Dan a hot chocolate seemed like a necessity. He fed Thor a treat, and the two of them headed off, hurrying through the rain, Phil somehow managing to juggle the Thor\u2019s lead, the umbrella and the hot chocolate.</p><p>Dan hadn\u2019t got that far when Phil returned; they were a little further along the front flowerbed, but as they pulled a weed, Phil could see their hands shaking. The rain was running off Dan\u2019s hood and dripping on their face, small rivulets of water trickling down like tears.</p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d Phil said, announcing his presence, \u201cI brought you hot chocolate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d Dan said, looking up in surprise, \u201cFor me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, for you,\u201d Phil nodded, smiling and holding out one of the cups to Dan. \u201cTake a break for a minute and drink it, okay? You look freezing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Dan smiled, taking the hot chocolate, \u201cThank you so much.\u201d</p><p>Dan wrapped both their hands around the hot chocolate and tentatively took a sip. After determining it was a perfectly drinkable temperature, they took another, bigger sip, their smile growing with the realisation of how nice a hot chocolate this was.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good,\u201d Dan smiled at Phil, \u201cReally good. Thank you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, honestly,\u201d Phil smiled, \u201cI was thinking about getting one myself, then when I saw you shivering by the rhododendron, I knew I needed to make it two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do I owe you?\u201d Dan asked, looking up at Phil with wide eyes wide, their voice a little quiet and unsure.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Phil said, slightly shocked, smiling down at Dan. \u201cIt\u2019s on me, a present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Dan said, brushing some water away from under their eye, \u201cUhh, d\u2019you want to come sit in my van for bit while we drink these?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be nice,\u201d Phil said, happy for an excuse to get out of the rain.</p><p>Dan got themself up and started to head along towards their van, Phil following on the pavement side of the flowerbed. They met at the driveway, where Dan\u2019s van was parked. Dan opened the passenger door for Phil and hurried him and Thor inside before getting in their own side.</p><p>The dryness of the van was quite a relief from the steady pelting rain outside. Both Dan and Phil fell quiet for a moment, listening to the rain drumming on the van\u2019s metal roof, sipping on their hot chocolates. The peace would never last though, not with Thor around - who, after a few moments in the dry, decided it was time to shake all the drips off. He had a lesser amount of fur to shake out than some dogs, but still, he managed to cover Dan and Phil with lots of little droplets of water.</p><p>\u201cThor,\u201d Phil scolded, blinking some water out of his eye, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Dan, brushing some wet dog spray from their own face, laughed at Phil\u2019s attempt to tell Thor off, \u201cIt\u2019s okay; my van is full of mud anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhh still, I\u2019m sorry for him contributing it,\u201d Phil apologised, glancing at Thor with another look of disapproval.</p><p>\u201cHonestly, it\u2019s fine. It makes the van feel loved; he\u2019s the first dog friend I\u2019ve had in here\u2026\u201d Dan insisted, a sheepish smile forming as they continued, \u201cAnd you\u2019re the first human friend, as it happens.\u201d</p><p>Phil felt honoured to be classed as a friend, and even more so to be the first friend in Dan\u2019s van. He watched Dan take another sip of their hot chocolate, still shivering slightly, but looking like they had a little colour in their face now. Phil too was feeling warmed by the drink, and now also by Dan\u2019s van. The conversation moved on from Thor\u2019s shaking habits and the cleanliness of the van to other things. </p><p>They found it pretty easy to talk to each other, both having similar interests in video games and in music. Even their schedules aligned to some extent: Phil worked from Tuesday to Saturday and Dan from Monday to Friday, and their hours were more or less the same. This interested Phil; he enjoyed Dan\u2019s company and wondered if they\u2019d be able to get together sometime, outside of Dan\u2019s work.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>Dan, realising that they were slowly letting Phil into their life, made the decision that it would be wise to open up about their gender identity, at least a little. Dan knew that their gender presentation was confusing to others and it was something they felt they could tell Phil, this amazingly kind man with an adorable corgi.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably wondering about me,\u201d Dan started slowly, a little hesitant about how to have this conversation, as it wasn\u2019t one they\u2019d ever had with someone they\u2019d just met.</p><p>\u201cAbout?\u201d Phil asked, not sure what Dan was going to tell him.</p><p>\u201cAbout like my gender and stuff?\u201d Dan said quietly, words almost blending into the steady thrumming of the rain. \u201cPeople either take me for a lesbian, or a prepubescent boy, or sometimes they\u2019re just confused?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in the confused category, I guess, but, like, it doesn\u2019t exactly matter to me,\u201d Phil said. \u201cYou seem a pretty cool person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Dan laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s what I like to hear. To be honest. I\u2026 I\u2019d rather not have a gender, like I don\u2019t feel like a man or a woman, if you get what I mean?\u201d</p><p>Phil looked curious so Dan continued with his explanation, \u201cYou know about transgender people, right? I\u2019m kind of like that in a way; I feel some of the same dislike of my body. I was assigned female at birth, but that\u2019s not me. In some ways, I\u2019d like to be more like a man. I\u2019d love to be flat chested, I\u2019d like to have a deeper voice, but there\u2019s other aspects I wouldn\u2019t like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a word for how you identify?\u201d Phil asked, knowing a lot of LGBTQ+ terminology but not wanting to put Dan under the wrong one.</p><p>\u201cAgender,\u201d Dan smiled, his voice now soft and steady. \u201cI\u2019m an agender gardener who identifies more strongly with plants than most people. I\u2019m a mystic illusion, my friend, but sometimes being different is a good thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d Phil nodded, \u201cI could tell you were different when I first spoke to you, but that intrigued me more than anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d Dan smiled, relaxing into the seat a little. \u201cAnd you intrigue me too. Like what do you do for a living? If you don\u2019t mind me asking? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s something you\u2019ve spoken about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a video editor; I work for a company but the work is kind of flexible, letting me work at home some of the time,\u201d Phil explained. \u201cI\u2019m usually in the office Tuesday through Friday, but it depends on the job\u2026 and Saturdays I work from home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s pretty cool,\u201d Dan said, \u201cSo d\u2019you make films or adverts or music videos or what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOther companies pay us to make promotional stuff, and yeah sometimes we work with smaller musicians to produce music videos,\u201d Phil explained, gesticulating as he tried to give Dan a gist of what he did. \u201cI try to make short films as a hobby, but they\u2019re nothing special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo with being agender, do you go by \u2018they\u2019?\u201d Phil asked, returning the conversation to the topic of Dan\u2019s gender as he thought of this question. \u201cI\u2019d like to get this right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Dan nodded, \u201cLike, I won\u2019t get too offended if people call me \u2018she\u2019 or \u2018he\u2019 because I\u2019m used to it, but they/them/their are the only pronouns that feel right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Phil said smiling, \u201cI think I can manage that. I\u2019m not exactly used to it, but I\u2019ll do my absolute best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Dan laughed, \u201cBut thank you!\u201d</p><p>As the two finished off their hot chocolates, the conversation slowly died down, the thoughts of returning to the outdoors suddenly taking over.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better get back to work,\u201d Dan said, a little sadly, placing their cup in a cup holder by the gear stick.</p><p>\u201cHow long are you gonna be stuck out in this for?\u201d Phil asked, concerned. \u201cWhen do you finish work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do nine to twelve and two to four usually,\u201d Dan explained, \u201cBut today I\u2019m just going to work hard up to lunch time and then call it a day; I think the weather\u2019s to get worse later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll see you next week probably, but look after yourself, yeah?

Thor didn&rsquo;t mind the rain too much; he&rsquo;d just shake it off all over Phil&rsquo;s floor when they got home. Phil would wear a coat, maybe take an umbrella. He didn&rsquo;t enjoy the rain as much as Thor, but being out in the bad weather certainly felt like he was doing something badass, almost mysterious.</p><p>Phil never expected to find Dan gardening on such a rainy Monday. He had always presumed it to be a weather-dependant activity, but here Dan was, dressed fully in waterproofs, still working on the garden.</p><p>&ldquo;Dan!?&rdquo; Phil greeted them, surprised. &ldquo;You still work when its raining!?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, well I can&rsquo;t cut the grass, but there&rsquo;s other things needing done,&rdquo; Dan explained. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be working so many hours so I&rsquo;ll charge less, but this is the one job I do my best not to cancel on.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so wet; are you sure this is a good idea?&rdquo; Phil asked, concerned.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be fine,&rdquo; Dan insisted, a contradictory cold shiver wracking its way through their body.</p><p>&ldquo;You look freezing,&rdquo; Phil told them. &ldquo;At least make sure you have a hot shower when you get home.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes mum,&rdquo; Dan said, sounding slightly irritable, their eyebrows forming into a frown.</p><p>Phil tried to warm Dan&rsquo;s heart a little, talking to him for a while and letting him play with a soggy Thor. Phil didn&rsquo;t stay as long as he usually would, but he had a reason for that. Phil planned to buy both himself and Dan a hot chocolate in the town, then return to the garden to give Dan one, and maybe drink them together.</p><p>Phil and Thor made their way to the town centre where Phil tied Thor up under a tree, hoping it would give him a little bit of shelter. He felt bad for leaving his dog like that, but he&rsquo;d give Thor a treat to make up for it later, once they were home. He stepped into the cafe and took his place in the queue behind the person already at the counter. When they were finished with their transaction, Phil stepped forward, ordering two regular hot chocolates to take away. Whilst he would sometimes indulge in cream and marshmallows, they always got stuck in the lid of takeaway cups, so he went for the perfectly good standard hot chocolate.</p><p>When Phil finally had a carrier tray of two hot chocolates in his hand, he stepped back out into the rain. He quickly set about untying Thor, slipping the leash onto the same hand as he held his umbrella, not wanting to risk spilling the hot chocolates.</p><p>Doubling back to see Dan again was a change from Phil and Thor&rsquo;s usual route, but with today&rsquo;s weather, taking Dan a hot chocolate seemed like a necessity. He fed Thor a treat, and the two of them headed off, hurrying through the rain, Phil somehow managing to juggle the Thor&rsquo;s lead, the umbrella and the hot chocolate.</p><p>Dan hadn&rsquo;t got that far when Phil returned; they were a little further along the front flowerbed, but as they pulled a weed, Phil could see their hands shaking. The rain was running off Dan&rsquo;s hood and dripping on their face, small rivulets of water trickling down like tears.</p><p>&ldquo;Dan,&rdquo; Phil said, announcing his presence, &ldquo;I brought you hot chocolate.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You what?&rdquo; Dan said, looking up in surprise, &ldquo;For me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, for you,&rdquo; Phil nodded, smiling and holding out one of the cups to Dan. &ldquo;Take a break for a minute and drink it, okay? You look freezing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Dan smiled, taking the hot chocolate, &ldquo;Thank you so much.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan wrapped both their hands around the hot chocolate and tentatively took a sip. After determining it was a perfectly drinkable temperature, they took another, bigger sip, their smile growing with the realisation of how nice a hot chocolate this was.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; Dan smiled at Phil, &ldquo;Really good. Thank you!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, honestly,&rdquo; Phil smiled, &ldquo;I was thinking about getting one myself, then when I saw you shivering by the rhododendron, I knew I needed to make it two.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do I owe you?&rdquo; Dan asked, looking up at Phil with wide eyes wide, their voice a little quiet and unsure.</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; Phil said, slightly shocked, smiling down at Dan. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s on me, a present.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Dan said, brushing some water away from under their eye, &ldquo;Uhh, d&rsquo;you want to come sit in my van for bit while we drink these?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That would be nice,&rdquo; Phil said, happy for an excuse to get out of the rain.</p><p>Dan got themself up and started to head along towards their van, Phil following on the pavement side of the flowerbed. They met at the driveway, where Dan&rsquo;s van was parked. Dan opened the passenger door for Phil and hurried him and Thor inside before getting in their own side.</p><p>The dryness of the van was quite a relief from the steady pelting rain outside. Both Dan and Phil fell quiet for a moment, listening to the rain drumming on the van&rsquo;s metal roof, sipping on their hot chocolates. The peace would never last though, not with Thor around - who, after a few moments in the dry, decided it was time to shake all the drips off. He had a lesser amount of fur to shake out than some dogs, but still, he managed to cover Dan and Phil with lots of little droplets of water.</p><p>&ldquo;Thor,&rdquo; Phil scolded, blinking some water out of his eye, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan, brushing some wet dog spray from their own face, laughed at Phil&rsquo;s attempt to tell Thor off, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay; my van is full of mud anyway.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ahh still, I&rsquo;m sorry for him contributing it,&rdquo; Phil apologised, glancing at Thor with another look of disapproval.</p><p>&ldquo;Honestly, it&rsquo;s fine. It makes the van feel loved; he&rsquo;s the first dog friend I&rsquo;ve had in here&hellip;&rdquo; Dan insisted, a sheepish smile forming as they continued, &ldquo;And you&rsquo;re the first human friend, as it happens.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil felt honoured to be classed as a friend, and even more so to be the first friend in Dan&rsquo;s van. He watched Dan take another sip of their hot chocolate, still shivering slightly, but looking like they had a little colour in their face now. Phil too was feeling warmed by the drink, and now also by Dan&rsquo;s van. The conversation moved on from Thor&rsquo;s shaking habits and the cleanliness of the van to other things. </p><p>They found it pretty easy to talk to each other, both having similar interests in video games and in music. Even their schedules aligned to some extent: Phil worked from Tuesday to Saturday and Dan from Monday to Friday, and their hours were more or less the same. This interested Phil; he enjoyed Dan&rsquo;s company and wondered if they&rsquo;d be able to get together sometime, outside of Dan&rsquo;s work.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Dan, realising that they were slowly letting Phil into their life, made the decision that it would be wise to open up about their gender identity, at least a little. Dan knew that their gender presentation was confusing to others and it was something they felt they could tell Phil, this amazingly kind man with an adorable corgi.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re probably wondering about me,&rdquo; Dan started slowly, a little hesitant about how to have this conversation, as it wasn&rsquo;t one they&rsquo;d ever had with someone they&rsquo;d just met.</p><p>&ldquo;About?&rdquo; Phil asked, not sure what Dan was going to tell him.</p><p>&ldquo;About like my gender and stuff?&rdquo; Dan said quietly, words almost blending into the steady thrumming of the rain. &ldquo;People either take me for a lesbian, or a prepubescent boy, or sometimes they&rsquo;re just confused?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in the confused category, I guess, but, like, it doesn&rsquo;t exactly matter to me,&rdquo; Phil said. &ldquo;You seem a pretty cool person.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Dan laughed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I like to hear. To be honest. I&hellip; I&rsquo;d rather not have a gender, like I don&rsquo;t feel like a man or a woman, if you get what I mean?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil looked curious so Dan continued with his explanation, &ldquo;You know about transgender people, right? I&rsquo;m kind of like that in a way; I feel some of the same dislike of my body. I was assigned female at birth, but that&rsquo;s not me. In some ways, I&rsquo;d like to be more like a man. I&rsquo;d love to be flat chested, I&rsquo;d like to have a deeper voice, but there&rsquo;s other aspects I wouldn&rsquo;t like.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you have a word for how you identify?&rdquo; Phil asked, knowing a lot of LGBTQ+ terminology but not wanting to put Dan under the wrong one.</p><p>&ldquo;Agender,&rdquo; Dan smiled, his voice now soft and steady. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an agender gardener who identifies more strongly with plants than most people. I&rsquo;m a mystic illusion, my friend, but sometimes being different is a good thing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; Phil nodded, &ldquo;I could tell you were different when I first spoke to you, but that intrigued me more than anything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad,&rdquo; Dan smiled, relaxing into the seat a little. &ldquo;And you intrigue me too. Like what do you do for a living? If you don&rsquo;t mind me asking? I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;ve spoken about?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a video editor; I work for a company but the work is kind of flexible, letting me work at home some of the time,&rdquo; Phil explained. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m usually in the office Tuesday through Friday, but it depends on the job&hellip; and Saturdays I work from home.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s pretty cool,&rdquo; Dan said, &ldquo;So d&rsquo;you make films or adverts or music videos or what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Other companies pay us to make promotional stuff, and yeah sometimes we work with smaller musicians to produce music videos,&rdquo; Phil explained, gesticulating as he tried to give Dan a gist of what he did. &ldquo;I try to make short films as a hobby, but they&rsquo;re nothing special.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So with being agender, do you go by &lsquo;they&rsquo;?&rdquo; Phil asked, returning the conversation to the topic of Dan&rsquo;s gender as he thought of this question. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to get this right.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Dan nodded, &ldquo;Like, I won&rsquo;t get too offended if people call me &lsquo;she&rsquo; or &lsquo;he&rsquo; because I&rsquo;m used to it, but they/them/their are the only pronouns that feel right.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Phil said smiling, &ldquo;I think I can manage that. I&rsquo;m not exactly used to it, but I&rsquo;ll do my absolute best.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it,&rdquo; Dan laughed, &ldquo;But thank you!&rdquo;</p><p>As the two finished off their hot chocolates, the conversation slowly died down, the thoughts of returning to the outdoors suddenly taking over.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d better get back to work,&rdquo; Dan said, a little sadly, placing their cup in a cup holder by the gear stick.</p><p>&ldquo;How long are you gonna be stuck out in this for?&rdquo; Phil asked, concerned. &ldquo;When do you finish work?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do nine to twelve and two to four usually,&rdquo; Dan explained, &ldquo;But today I&rsquo;m just going to work hard up to lunch time and then call it a day; I think the weather&rsquo;s to get worse later.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll see you next week probably, but look after yourself, yeah? You&rsquo;ll have a hot shower or something when you get home, right?&rdquo; Phil said, genuinely concerned about Dan staying out in this weather, even if only for another hour or two.</p><p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; Dan smiled, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll probably have a hot bath and some soup and then stay in for the afternoon doing my finances. And yes, I&rsquo;ll be here next week if you want to drop by.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be walking Thor, as always,&rdquo; Phil nodded. &ldquo;Will you be free after work next Monday? I was wondering if you wanted to go for coffee sometime?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Next Monday? Yeah, I will be,&rdquo; Dan smiled, &ldquo;Sounds good.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Great,&rdquo; Phil smiled, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll I&rsquo;ll see you next Monday morning when I walk Thor; we can confirm the details then.&rdquo;</p><p>With that, the two humans and their four-legged friend prepared to step back out into the rain and get on with their lives. The van had provided a warm, comfortable environment for them to enjoy their hot drinks, but that goodness had to come to an end. They would see each other again soon; like a flower which blooms again, the joy of being together would return.</p><hr /><p><a href=\"https://philsdrill.tumblr.com/post/176994463713/chapter-4-let-me-water-that-growing-feeling\">\n\nNext Chapter =&gt;</a><br /></p></p>",
