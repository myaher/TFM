        "body": "<p>You were awoken the next morning when a knock on the door echoed through your room, and the soft muffle of a familiar voice heard through the wall. </p><p>\u201c(y/n), wake up and come eat breakfast\u201d he called. You got up, opening the door still in your groggy state and greeting your newfound friend, following him down to the dining room. You were dressed in the white night gown he had provided you last night in place of your torn dress.</p><p>And of course, the blonde male was already down there, devouring his plate. The atmosphere tense, and not daring to speak a word. Both choosing to ignore one another, you grabbed your own plate of food and sat next to your friend.</p><p>You opted to engage into small conversation with Bernard, not even batting an eyelash to the ash blonde. Seeing you carrying on such a carefree attitude, despite yesterday\u2019s events, seemed to fuel the male making his blood boil. How could you just ignore him? You were just a shitty brat? How did you even manage to be speaking so calmly? And to a peasant what more?</p><p>Was he jealous?</p><p>\u201cHey brat\u201d he called, but you went on with your conversation with your friend uninterrupted.</p><p>An irk mark surfaced his skin knowing you were purposefully ignoring him. \u201cOi, princess I know you heard me.\u201d</p><p>You side eyed him giving him a quick glance then turning your attention back to Bernard. Oh we were gonna be petty huh? Well we can be petty. <i>We can fucking be petty.</i></p><p>\u201cWell since you\u2019re not answering me I guess that means I\u2019ll be going outside by myself today\u2026\u201d he sighs, doing his best to keep a smirk from showing on his face. Leaning his head on the palm of hand and resting his elbow on top of the table, keeping his face bored and uninterested. \u201cI was gonna fly by the Suijin Kingdom, they\u2019re pretty close to the ocean. Heard the water there is so clear you couldn\u2019t even tell if there was water there, maybe I\u2019ll even go for a little dip myself\u2026\u201d </p><p>Your ears perked up at his words, but you stay defiant and held your ground. </p><p>You heard the scraping of the chair against the wooden floor as Bakugou got up from his seat, and turning towards the door. You swallowed the lump in your throat as you pondered at the thought of the ocean. When had been the last time you had gone to the beach or even seen one? Being able to feel the cool ocean waves hit your legs, and feel the sand digging in between your toes just sounded so\u2026 <i>enticing\u2026.</i></p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d </p><p>Gotcha.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re taking me with you&hellip;I\u2026\u201d</p><p>Now looking at you from the corner of his eye, that smirk he was hiding now stretched across his face. \u201cI want to see the ocean.\u201d</p><p>Turning back around, crimson irises now making eye contact with your (e/c) ones. His shit eating smirk now in full display. </p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s get a move on princess.\u201d</p><p>~</p><p>You dressed back into your torn dress. Internally cursing to yourself for not even considering packing at least some extra clothes from home. Well it hadn\u2019t been all that bad, with the breeze seeping through the manmade entrance and running up your exposed calves. Everything important was in tact and covered up, you could be thankful for that in the least. </p><p>The flight wasn\u2019t too bad. Your stomach flipped occasionally due to still not being used to flying, but you were able to hold back any of your breakfast from coming back up. Luckily you weren\u2019t in the sky for too long, Bakugou informing you that they were going to make a pit stop in a city in Suijin Kingdom. </p><p>You landed in front of a tall gate, which granted access to the city that was secured within the connecting walls of the gate. A group of knights guarded the front, one stepping forward towards the three of you.</p><p>\u201cState your name and purpose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me you asshat, just let me in!\u201d Bakugou growls, wearing an annoyed scowl. Behind him you were still cautiously getting down from the beast\u2019s neck before you could join the male. </p><p>The man sighs, looking back at the knights that stood at the gate. </p><p>\u201cKing Bakugou, we\u2019ve told you many times to stop coming here. You know you\u2019re banned from this city.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit! Outta my way!!\u201d he shoves the knight to the side, forcefully making his way towards the entrance. Before he could reach the door his path is blocked by swords crossed against each other in an x. \u201cKing Bakugou, we will not tell you twice. You are restricted from entering this city. Now please leave before we take further action.\u201d </p><p>He clicks his tongue. His hand gripping at the handle of his sword preparing for a fight, but pauses when your voice calls him from behind. \u201cHey king could you hurry it up and let us in, I really gotta pee!\u201d waving a hand in the air, the other one cupping at the side of your mouth.</p><p>Glaring back over his shoulder at you, a confused expression on your features completely oblivious of the situation. He grudgingly walks back to you, and yanking at your elbow. \u201cC\u2019mon they won\u2019t open the damn gate so we\u2019ll just have to enter our way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>Next thing you knew you were thrown back onto the dragon, not even getting the chance to properly seat yourself as the beast takes flight once again. Your body sprawled sideways on the dragon\u2019s neck, desperately clinging for dear life in the uncomfortable position. \u201cH-hey! I\u2019m gonna die!!!\u201d your legs swinging freely and your grip just about to slip. </p><p>With one strong motion of his neck, you slip off the beasts neck and you free fall for a few seconds until your bottom hits the ground hard. The fall was a good 5 ft to the rough gravel, but it still hurt like hell. \u201cAt least let me settle down before you take off!\u201d you snap at the male, but he ignores your nagging and sets off on his own.</p><p>You catch up to the blonde, trailing close to this back to avoid getting lost as you venture deeper into a bustling city. People crowded the streets, children running around, horses pulling carts, merchants selling products, mothers gossiping about juicy rumors. It was all another new setting to you. You were lost in the noise with curiosity painted on every inch of your face. \u00a0</p><p>As you were too busy gazing and questioning everything you saw, you hadn\u2019t noticed Bakugou had stopped walking and you directly run into his back.</p><p>\u201cWha-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch where you\u2019re going dumbass! I\u2019m gonna talk to this merchant, so don\u2019t get lost and wait here like a good girl.\u201d motioning a thumb to the store you had stopped in front of. You click your tongue in response and mumble something incoherent under your breath, but you oblige nonetheless and seat yourself on top of a nearby crate. </p><p>You mindlessly swing your legs and whistle to yourself to pass the time, staring up at the clear blue sky above. When you felt the eyes of strangers burning into you. </p><p><i>\u201cThat girl\u2019s dress is torn, her legs are completely exposed how distasteful.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cShe must be a vagrant.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI have never seen such poor etiquette from a young lady, someone should at least teach her some sense.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI saw that girl walking along side that barbaric king of Kojin. She must be his new mistress.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cKing of Kojin is here? Who in their right mind would ever let themselves be courted by that horrible man. That girl is asking for her death wish.\u201d</i></p><p>Your eye twitched at the judgmental comments. <i>\u2018Jeez people here really don\u2019t know how to mind their business and keep their mouth shut huh.\u2019</i>\u00a0looking down at your torn dress. The (s/c) of your legs completely exposed, and you couldn\u2019t deny that wearing such a raggedy dress did make you look like some kind of dirty tramp. Everyone else in the city had been dressed in neat gowns with shining brooches adorning their necks, making them seem more than well off. Not one person looked less than a commoner. Or even of a commoner.</p><p>Bakugou steps out of the shop, walking back over to you. </p><p>\u201cHey king.\u201d pulling yourself out of your thoughts, he narrows his eyes down at you.</p><p>\u201cBuy me new clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa?!\u201d his mouth hangs open in annoyance. Pulling at the torn area of your dress, fumbling awkwardly with the loose threads that bunched together. \u201cI didn\u2019t bring any other clothes with me. And as you can see,\u201d wiggling your legs in the air, \u201cMy dress is torn, and my legs get <i>awfully</i> cold.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo way go buy your own damn clothes princess.\u201d</p><p>You scowl, jutting your lips out in a pout. \u201cBut you\u2019re the one who did this! So expiate! Besides\u2026 I don\u2019t have money\u2026 \u201d Bakugou just groans, rubbing his face in his hand. \u201cFine fine! What fucking ever! Just make it quick!\u201d </p><p>~</p><p>\u201cHow bout this one? Oh! Oh! Or this one!\u201d </p><p>You plucked at multiple dresses, each with different designs and colors. Some with frills, others adorned with satin bows or fancy jewels. There was just so many to choose from.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna go try these on!\u201d you exclaimed dragging an armful of gowns into the changing room. Bakugou sat with his head in his hands, internally screaming that he was dragged into this episode of \u2018Say Yes to the Dress\u2019</p><p>\u201cWhy the fuck did I even comply\u201d he groans. The sound of curtain being swung open, and you stepped out. You were wearing a long-sleeve red gown that nicely complimented your skin color. The neckline was an off the shoulder design, maturely exposing your neck and collarbones, with the hem decorated with lace and pearls. There was a black satin ribbon tied around your midriff that cinched your waist, accentuating your curves. And the skirt fell down to just an inch above the ground, with frills falling in the front. </p><p>You twirled around the store, modeling in front of the ash blonde male. \u201cSo how does it look? The color is really nice dontcha think? It\u2019s my favorite out of all of them.\u201d you smile at him, as you rub at the soft fabric of the gown. </p><p>Bakugou just stares at you. His face unusually calm, but his brows furrowed in a focus on your form. He silently gets up walking to the counter and throwing money in front of the store keeper, causing them to jump. \u201cI\u2019m taking that dress.\u201d pointing a finger to you.</p><p>\u201cEh?!\u201d </p><p>Turning back to look at you, you tilt your head in confusion. He sighs, \u201cAnd whatever other dresses that idiot over there wants.\u201d and he walks out the store leaving both you and the storekeeper abruptly and utterly lost. </p><p>Outside, Bakugou makes his way to a dark empty alleyway. Leaning against the cool brick wall and raising a hand to his slowly heating face. <i>\u2018Idiot\u2026\u2019</i></p><p>~</p><p>After your little shopping spree, the two of you headed back to the dragon who was resting under a patch of shade underneath some trees.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon bud, we\u2019re heading east\u201d Bakugou says as he pats the snout of the red beast, rising to his wake. \u201cWow you\u2019re so much nicer to your dragons than any other human.\u201d you snicker. \u201cShut it princess before I leave you behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah yeah\u201d you roll your eyes.</p><p>You watched from above as the light beige of sand came into sight, and very soon the crystal blue water of the ocean. You squealed in excitement, excitedly shaking Bakugou\u2019s shoulders. \u201cLook! Look! It\u2019s the sea! It\u2019s the sea!\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes I know I can see it idiot!\u201d he barked back, \u201cQuit shaking me!\u201d</p><p>The dragon eased down onto the sand, much softer this time to avoid the grainy particles from flying around. You couldn\u2019t hold your extreme thrill as you threw yourself off it\u2019s neck and dart towards the shore. Hurriedly kicking off your boots and pulling up the skirt of your dress, and you anticipated the cool waves hitting your skin. </p><p>The water was so cold and refreshing, and the wet sand in between your toes was like a soft cushion that sunk you into the earth. You were in bliss. </p><p>\u201cOi princess be careful! I just bought that fucking dress you\u2019re going to ruin it!\u201d he yelled from behind you, though you ignored his angry scolding and continued admiring the transparency of the water and spotting the small wildlife inhabiting below the surface. </p><p>\u201cHey hey! There\u2019s little fish here!\u201d </p><p>\u201cHey! Don\u2019t ignore me idiot!\u201d </p><p>You turn over your shoulder giving him an angry pout, \u201cLoosen up a bit would ya? We\u2019re at the beach!\u201d he steps closer to you, stopping just before where the incoming waves could reach him. \u201cTch, we\u2019re only here because it was my bait into getting you to come with me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell whatever\u201d you bend down, attempting to chase one of the fish with your hands, causing the bottom of your gown to dip into the water. </p><p>\u201cOi! What the fuck did I just say! Don\u2019t you ever listen!?\u201d he runs to your back, lifting up your skirt on each side, just enough to hover above the water. \u201cYou\u2019re one big fucking airhead of a princess!\u201d </p><p>You quickly straightened your back back up and glaring at the male behind you. \u201cI am not! And I am not a princess! Quit calling me that!\u201d you swiftly scoop up a handful of water and throw it at him, \u201cTake that idiot king!\u201d </p><p>He steps back, blocking your attack with an arm. \u201cCut that out idiot!\u201d you just laugh sending splashes of water his way in a barrage of waves. \u201cFine then. You asked for it princess.\u201d and thus you spent the rest of your afternoon having a salty water war and scavenging through tide pools for little treasures. Most of the time Bakugou screaming at you and you running off too happy without a care in the world.</p><p>After your little fun was over, the two took shelter under the wing of his dragon, resting against the smooth scales of the beast, watching the sun slowly start to set.</p><p>\u201cThat was fun. I totally kicked your butt.\u201d you chuckled to yourself. Bakugou gave you a disagreeing look and scoffed, \u201cYeah right. As if you could ever beat me princess, I\u2019m a fucking warlord.\u201d you roll your eyes at his narcissistic response. \u201cMan would you quit with that?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs, \u201cit\u2019s true, I\u2019m the best fucking fighter there is, no one-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that.\u201d </p><p>Raising a brow at you in confusion. \u201cYou haven\u2019t even bothered to learn my name, all you do is call me princess. I already told you I\u2019m not a princess. Far from it.\u201d</p><p>You sigh, staring at the orange hues that warmed up the sky. \u201c(y/n). (l/n)(y/n)\u201d tilting your head to the ash blonde. \u201cThat\u2019s my name.\u201d a small smirk pulls his lips, \u201cAlright (y/n). Then you can refer to me as \u2018my lord\u2019 hmm, or \u2018your majesty\u2019. Your pick\u201d </p><p>You lightly punch his shoulder, \u201cJeez what is wrong with you\u201d he snickers, your gaze going back to the sky laying there in silence for a bit. </p><p>\u201cKatsuki.\u201d his voice low, almost a whisper. </p><p>\u201cKatsuki?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name. Bakugou Katsuki.\u201d </p><p>Your eyes widen and your irises glow in amusement. You nod happily. Finally some progress.</p><p>\u201cOk Katsuki!\u201d</p><p>Maybe staying here wouldn\u2019t be all that bad.</p>",

Oh we were gonna be petty huh? Well we can be petty. <i>We can fucking be petty.</i></p><p>\u201cWell since you\u2019re not answering me I guess that means I\u2019ll be going outside by myself today\u2026\u201d he sighs, doing his best to keep a smirk from showing on his face. Leaning his head on the palm of hand and resting his elbow on top of the table, keeping his face bored and uninterested. \u201cI was gonna fly by the Suijin Kingdom, they\u2019re pretty close to the ocean. Heard the water there is so clear you couldn\u2019t even tell if there was water there, maybe I\u2019ll even go for a little dip myself\u2026\u201d </p><p>Your ears perked up at his words, but you stay defiant and held your ground. </p><p>You heard the scraping of the chair against the wooden floor as Bakugou got up from his seat, and turning towards the door. You swallowed the lump in your throat as you pondered at the thought of the ocean. When had been the last time you had gone to the beach or even seen one? Being able to feel the cool ocean waves hit your legs, and feel the sand digging in between your toes just sounded so\u2026 <i>enticing\u2026.</i></p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d </p><p>Gotcha.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re taking me with you\u2026I\u2026\u201d</p><p>Now looking at you from the corner of his eye, that smirk he was hiding now stretched across his face. \u201cI want to see the ocean.\u201d</p><p>Turning back around, crimson irises now making eye contact with your (e/c) ones. His shit eating smirk now in full display. </p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s get a move on princess.\u201d</p><p>~</p><p>You dressed back into your torn dress. Internally cursing to yourself for not even considering packing at least some extra clothes from home. Well it hadn\u2019t been all that bad, with the breeze seeping through the manmade entrance and running up your exposed calves. Everything important was in tact and covered up, you could be thankful for that in the least. </p><p>The flight wasn\u2019t too bad. Your stomach flipped occasionally due to still not being used to flying, but you were able to hold back any of your breakfast from coming back up. Luckily you weren\u2019t in the sky for too long, Bakugou informing you that they were going to make a pit stop in a city in Suijin Kingdom. </p><p>You landed in front of a tall gate, which granted access to the city that was secured within the connecting walls of the gate. A group of knights guarded the front, one stepping forward towards the three of you.</p><p>\u201cState your name and purpose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me you asshat, just let me in!\u201d Bakugou growls, wearing an annoyed scowl. Behind him you were still cautiously getting down from the beast\u2019s neck before you could join the male. </p><p>The man sighs, looking back at the knights that stood at the gate. </p><p>\u201cKing Bakugou, we\u2019ve told you many times to stop coming here. You know you\u2019re banned from this city.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit! Outta my way!!\u201d he shoves the knight to the side, forcefully making his way towards the entrance. Before he could reach the door his path is blocked by swords crossed against each other in an x. \u201cKing Bakugou, we will not tell you twice. You are restricted from entering this city. Now please leave before we take further action.\u201d </p><p>He clicks his tongue. His hand gripping at the handle of his sword preparing for a fight, but pauses when your voice calls him from behind. \u201cHey king could you hurry it up and let us in, I really gotta pee!\u201d waving a hand in the air, the other one cupping at the side of your mouth.</p><p>Glaring back over his shoulder at you, a confused expression on your features completely oblivious of the situation. He grudgingly walks back to you, and yanking at your elbow. \u201cC\u2019mon they won\u2019t open the damn gate so we\u2019ll just have to enter our way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>Next thing you knew you were thrown back onto the dragon, not even getting the chance to properly seat yourself as the beast takes flight once again. Your body sprawled sideways on the dragon\u2019s neck, desperately clinging for dear life in the uncomfortable position. \u201cH-hey! I\u2019m gonna die!!!\u201d your legs swinging freely and your grip just about to slip. </p><p>With one strong motion of his neck, you slip off the beasts neck and you free fall for a few seconds until your bottom hits the ground hard. The fall was a good 5 ft to the rough gravel, but it still hurt like hell. \u201cAt least let me settle down before you take off!\u201d you snap at the male, but he ignores your nagging and sets off on his own.</p><p>You catch up to the blonde, trailing close to this back to avoid getting lost as you venture deeper into a bustling city. People crowded the streets, children running around, horses pulling carts, merchants selling products, mothers gossiping about juicy rumors. It was all another new setting to you. You were lost in the noise with curiosity painted on every inch of your face. \u00a0</p><p>As you were too busy gazing and questioning everything you saw, you hadn\u2019t noticed Bakugou had stopped walking and you directly run into his back.</p><p>\u201cWha-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch where you\u2019re going dumbass! I\u2019m gonna talk to this merchant, so don\u2019t get lost and wait here like a good girl.\u201d motioning a thumb to the store you had stopped in front of. You click your tongue in response and mumble something incoherent under your breath, but you oblige nonetheless and seat yourself on top of a nearby crate. </p><p>You mindlessly swing your legs and whistle to yourself to pass the time, staring up at the clear blue sky above. When you felt the eyes of strangers burning into you. </p><p><i>\u201cThat girl\u2019s dress is torn, her legs are completely exposed how distasteful.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cShe must be a vagrant.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI have never seen such poor etiquette from a young lady, someone should at least teach her some sense.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI saw that girl walking along side that barbaric king of Kojin. She must be his new mistress.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cKing of Kojin is here? Who in their right mind would ever let themselves be courted by that horrible man. That girl is asking for her death wish.\u201d</i></p><p>Your eye twitched at the judgmental comments. <i>\u2018Jeez people here really don\u2019t know how to mind their business and keep their mouth shut huh.\u2019</i>\u00a0looking down at your torn dress. The (s/c) of your legs completely exposed, and you couldn\u2019t deny that wearing such a raggedy dress did make you look like some kind of dirty tramp. Everyone else in the city had been dressed in neat gowns with shining brooches adorning their necks, making them seem more than well off. Not one person looked less than a commoner. Or even of a commoner.</p><p>Bakugou steps out of the shop, walking back over to you. </p><p>\u201cHey king.\u201d pulling yourself out of your thoughts, he narrows his eyes down at you.</p><p>\u201cBuy me new clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa?!\u201d his mouth hangs open in annoyance. Pulling at the torn area of your dress, fumbling awkwardly with the loose threads that bunched together. \u201cI didn\u2019t bring any other clothes with me. And as you can see,\u201d wiggling your legs in the air, \u201cMy dress is torn, and my legs get <i>awfully</i> cold.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo way go buy your own damn clothes princess.\u201d</p><p>You scowl, jutting your lips out in a pout. \u201cBut you\u2019re the one who did this! So expiate! Besides\u2026 I don\u2019t have money\u2026 \u201d Bakugou just groans, rubbing his face in his hand. \u201cFine fine! What fucking ever! Just make it quick!\u201d </p><p>~</p><p>\u201cHow bout this one? Oh! Oh! Or this one!\u201d </p><p>You plucked at multiple dresses, each with different designs and colors. Some with frills, others adorned with satin bows or fancy jewels. There was just so many to choose from.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna go try these on!\u201d you exclaimed dragging an armful of gowns into the changing room. Bakugou sat with his head in his hands, internally screaming that he was dragged into this episode of \u2018Say Yes to the Dress\u2019</p><p>\u201cWhy the fuck did I even comply\u201d he groans. The sound of curtain being swung open, and you stepped out. You were wearing a long-sleeve red gown that nicely complimented your skin color. The neckline was an off the shoulder design, maturely exposing your neck and collarbones, with the hem decorated with lace and pearls. There was a black satin ribbon tied around your midriff that cinched your waist, accentuating your curves. And the skirt fell down to just an inch above the ground, with frills falling in the front. </p><p>You twirled around the store, modeling in front of the ash blonde male. \u201cSo how does it look? The color is really nice dontcha think? It\u2019s my favorite out of all of them.\u201d you smile at him, as you rub at the soft fabric of the gown. </p><p>Bakugou just stares at you. His face unusually calm, but his brows furrowed in a focus on your form. He silently gets up walking to the counter and throwing money in front of the store keeper, causing them to jump. \u201cI\u2019m taking that dress.\u201d pointing a finger to you.</p><p>\u201cEh?!\u201d </p><p>Turning back to look at you, you tilt your head in confusion. He sighs, \u201cAnd whatever other dresses that idiot over there wants.\u201d and he walks out the store leaving both you and the storekeeper abruptly and utterly lost. </p><p>Outside, Bakugou makes his way to a dark empty alleyway. Leaning against the cool brick wall and raising a hand to his slowly heating face. <i>\u2018Idiot\u2026\u2019</i></p><p>~</p><p>After your little shopping spree, the two of you headed back to the dragon who was resting under a patch of shade underneath some trees.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon bud, we\u2019re heading east\u201d Bakugou says as he pats the snout of the red beast, rising to his wake. \u201cWow you\u2019re so much nicer to your dragons than any other human.\u201d you snicker. \u201cShut it princess before I leave you behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah yeah\u201d you roll your eyes.</p><p>You watched from above as the light beige of sand came into sight, and very soon the crystal blue water of the ocean. You squealed in excitement, excitedly shaking Bakugou\u2019s shoulders. \u201cLook! Look! It\u2019s the sea! It\u2019s the sea!\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes I know I can see it idiot!\u201d he barked back, \u201cQuit shaking me!\u201d</p><p>The dragon eased down onto the sand, much softer this time to avoid the grainy particles from flying around. You couldn\u2019t hold your extreme thrill as you threw yourself off it\u2019s neck and dart towards the shore. Hurriedly kicking off your boots and pulling up the skirt of your dress, and you anticipated the cool waves hitting your skin. </p><p>The water was so cold and refreshing, and the wet sand in between your toes was like a soft cushion that sunk you into the earth. You were in bliss. </p><p>\u201cOi princess be careful! I just bought that fucking dress you\u2019re going to ruin it!\u201d he yelled from behind you, though you ignored his angry scolding and continued admiring the transparency of the water and spotting the small wildlife inhabiting below the surface. </p><p>\u201cHey hey! There\u2019s little fish here!\u201d </p><p>\u201cHey! Don\u2019t ignore me idiot!\u201d </p><p>You turn over your shoulder giving him an angry pout, \u201cLoosen up a bit would ya? We\u2019re at the beach!\u201d he steps closer to you, stopping just before where the incoming waves could reach him. \u201cTch, we\u2019re only here because it was my bait into getting you to come with me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell whatever\u201d you bend down, attempting to chase one of the fish with your hands, causing the bottom of your gown to dip into the water. </p><p>\u201cOi! What the fuck did I just say! Don\u2019t you ever listen!?\u201d he runs to your back, lifting up your skirt on each side, just enough to hover above the water. \u201cYou\u2019re one big fucking airhead of a princess!\u201d </p><p>You quickly straightened your back back up and glaring at the male behind you. \u201cI am not! And I am not a princess! Quit calling me that!\u201d you swiftly scoop up a handful of water and throw it at him, \u201cTake that idiot king!\u201d </p><p>He steps back, blocking your attack with an arm. \u201cCut that out idiot!\u201d you just laugh sending splashes of water his way in a barrage of waves. \u201cFine then. You asked for it princess.\u201d and thus you spent the rest of your afternoon having a salty water war and scavenging through tide pools for little treasures. Most of the time Bakugou screaming at you and you running off too happy without a care in the world.</p><p>After your little fun was over, the two took shelter under the wing of his dragon, resting against the smooth scales of the beast, watching the sun slowly start to set.</p><p>\u201cThat was fun.

Bakugou Katsuki.\u201d </p><p>Your eyes widen and your irises glow in amusement. You nod happily. Finally some progress.</p><p>\u201cOk Katsuki!\u201d</p><p>Maybe staying here wouldn\u2019t be all that bad.</p>",

A group of knights guarded the front, one stepping forward towards the three of you.</p><p>\u201cState your name and purpose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me you asshat, just let me in!\u201d Bakugou growls, wearing an annoyed scowl. Behind him you were still cautiously getting down from the beast\u2019s neck before you could join the male. </p><p>The man sighs, looking back at the knights that stood at the gate. </p><p>\u201cKing Bakugou, we\u2019ve told you many times to stop coming here. You know you\u2019re banned from this city.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit! Outta my way!!\u201d he shoves the knight to the side, forcefully making his way towards the entrance. Before he could reach the door his path is blocked by swords crossed against each other in an x. \u201cKing Bakugou, we will not tell you twice. You are restricted from entering this city. Now please leave before we take further action.\u201d </p><p>He clicks his tongue. His hand gripping at the handle of his sword preparing for a fight, but pauses when your voice calls him from behind. \u201cHey king could you hurry it up and let us in, I really gotta pee!\u201d waving a hand in the air, the other one cupping at the side of your mouth.</p><p>Glaring back over his shoulder at you, a confused expression on your features completely oblivious of the situation. He grudgingly walks back to you, and yanking at your elbow. \u201cC\u2019mon they won\u2019t open the damn gate so we\u2019ll just have to enter our way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>Next thing you knew you were thrown back onto the dragon, not even getting the chance to properly seat yourself as the beast takes flight once again. Your body sprawled sideways on the dragon\u2019s neck, desperately clinging for dear life in the uncomfortable position. \u201cH-hey! I\u2019m gonna die!!!\u201d your legs swinging freely and your grip just about to slip. </p><p>With one strong motion of his neck, you slip off the beasts neck and you free fall for a few seconds until your bottom hits the ground hard. The fall was a good 5 ft to the rough gravel, but it still hurt like hell. \u201cAt least let me settle down before you take off!\u201d you snap at the male, but he ignores your nagging and sets off on his own.</p><p>You catch up to the blonde, trailing close to this back to avoid getting lost as you venture deeper into a bustling city. People crowded the streets, children running around, horses pulling carts, merchants selling products, mothers gossiping about juicy rumors. It was all another new setting to you. You were lost in the noise with curiosity painted on every inch of your face. \u00a0</p><p>As you were too busy gazing and questioning everything you saw, you hadn\u2019t noticed Bakugou had stopped walking and you directly run into his back.</p><p>\u201cWha-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch where you\u2019re going dumbass! I\u2019m gonna talk to this merchant, so don\u2019t get lost and wait here like a good girl.\u201d motioning a thumb to the store you had stopped in front of. You click your tongue in response and mumble something incoherent under your breath, but you oblige nonetheless and seat yourself on top of a nearby crate. </p><p>You mindlessly swing your legs and whistle to yourself to pass the time, staring up at the clear blue sky above. When you felt the eyes of strangers burning into you. </p><p><i>\u201cThat girl\u2019s dress is torn, her legs are completely exposed how distasteful.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cShe must be a vagrant.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI have never seen such poor etiquette from a young lady, someone should at least teach her some sense.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI saw that girl walking along side that barbaric king of Kojin. She must be his new mistress.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cKing of Kojin is here? Who in their right mind would ever let themselves be courted by that horrible man. That girl is asking for her death wish.\u201d</i></p><p>Your eye twitched at the judgmental comments. <i>\u2018Jeez people here really don\u2019t know how to mind their business and keep their mouth shut huh.\u2019</i>\u00a0looking down at your torn dress. The (s/c) of your legs completely exposed, and you couldn\u2019t deny that wearing such a raggedy dress did make you look like some kind of dirty tramp. Everyone else in the city had been dressed in neat gowns with shining brooches adorning their necks, making them seem more than well off. Not one person looked less than a commoner. Or even of a commoner.</p><p>Bakugou steps out of the shop, walking back over to you. </p><p>\u201cHey king.\u201d pulling yourself out of your thoughts, he narrows his eyes down at you.</p><p>\u201cBuy me new clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa?!\u201d his mouth hangs open in annoyance. Pulling at the torn area of your dress, fumbling awkwardly with the loose threads that bunched together. \u201cI didn\u2019t bring any other clothes with me. And as you can see,\u201d wiggling your legs in the air, \u201cMy dress is torn, and my legs get <i>awfully</i> cold.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo way go buy your own damn clothes princess.\u201d</p><p>You scowl, jutting your lips out in a pout. \u201cBut you\u2019re the one who did this! So expiate! Besides\u2026 I don\u2019t have money\u2026 \u201d Bakugou just groans, rubbing his face in his hand. \u201cFine fine! What fucking ever! Just make it quick!\u201d </p><p>~</p><p>\u201cHow bout this one? Oh! Oh! Or this one!\u201d </p><p>You plucked at multiple dresses, each with different designs and colors. Some with frills, others adorned with satin bows or fancy jewels. There was just so many to choose from.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna go try these on!\u201d you exclaimed dragging an armful of gowns into the changing room. Bakugou sat with his head in his hands, internally screaming that he was dragged into this episode of \u2018Say Yes to the Dress\u2019</p><p>\u201cWhy the fuck did I even comply\u201d he groans. The sound of curtain being swung open, and you stepped out. You were wearing a long-sleeve red gown that nicely complimented your skin color. The neckline was an off the shoulder design, maturely exposing your neck and collarbones, with the hem decorated with lace and pearls. There was a black satin ribbon tied around your midriff that cinched your waist, accentuating your curves. And the skirt fell down to just an inch above the ground, with frills falling in the front. </p><p>You twirled around the store, modeling in front of the ash blonde male. \u201cSo how does it look? The color is really nice dontcha think? It\u2019s my favorite out of all of them.\u201d you smile at him, as you rub at the soft fabric of the gown. </p><p>Bakugou just stares at you. His face unusually calm, but his brows furrowed in a focus on your form. He silently gets up walking to the counter and throwing money in front of the store keeper, causing them to jump. \u201cI\u2019m taking that dress.\u201d pointing a finger to you.</p><p>\u201cEh?!\u201d </p><p>Turning back to look at you, you tilt your head in confusion. He sighs, \u201cAnd whatever other dresses that idiot over there wants.\u201d and he walks out the store leaving both you and the storekeeper abruptly and utterly lost. </p><p>Outside, Bakugou makes his way to a dark empty alleyway. Leaning against the cool brick wall and raising a hand to his slowly heating face. <i>\u2018Idiot\u2026\u2019</i></p><p>~</p><p>After your little shopping spree, the two of you headed back to the dragon who was resting under a patch of shade underneath some trees.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon bud, we\u2019re heading east\u201d Bakugou says as he pats the snout of the red beast, rising to his wake. \u201cWow you\u2019re so much nicer to your dragons than any other human.\u201d you snicker. \u201cShut it princess before I leave you behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah yeah\u201d you roll your eyes.</p><p>You watched from above as the light beige of sand came into sight, and very soon the crystal blue water of the ocean. You squealed in excitement, excitedly shaking Bakugou\u2019s shoulders. \u201cLook! Look! It\u2019s the sea! It\u2019s the sea!\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes I know I can see it idiot!\u201d he barked back, \u201cQuit shaking me!\u201d</p><p>The dragon eased down onto the sand, much softer this time to avoid the grainy particles from flying around. You couldn\u2019t hold your extreme thrill as you threw yourself off it\u2019s neck and dart towards the shore. Hurriedly kicking off your boots and pulling up the skirt of your dress, and you anticipated the cool waves hitting your skin. </p><p>The water was so cold and refreshing, and the wet sand in between your toes was like a soft cushion that sunk you into the earth. You were in bliss. </p><p>\u201cOi princess be careful! I just bought that fucking dress you\u2019re going to ruin it!\u201d he yelled from behind you, though you ignored his angry scolding and continued admiring the transparency of the water and spotting the small wildlife inhabiting below the surface. </p><p>\u201cHey hey! There\u2019s little fish here!\u201d </p><p>\u201cHey! Don\u2019t ignore me idiot!\u201d </p><p>You turn over your shoulder giving him an angry pout, \u201cLoosen up a bit would ya? We\u2019re at the beach!\u201d he steps closer to you, stopping just before where the incoming waves could reach him. \u201cTch, we\u2019re only here because it was my bait into getting you to come with me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell whatever\u201d you bend down, attempting to chase one of the fish with your hands, causing the bottom of your gown to dip into the water. </p><p>\u201cOi! What the fuck did I just say! Don\u2019t you ever listen!?\u201d he runs to your back, lifting up your skirt on each side, just enough to hover above the water. \u201cYou\u2019re one big fucking airhead of a princess!\u201d </p><p>You quickly straightened your back back up and glaring at the male behind you. \u201cI am not! And I am not a princess! Quit calling me that!\u201d you swiftly scoop up a handful of water and throw it at him, \u201cTake that idiot king!\u201d </p><p>He steps back, blocking your attack with an arm. \u201cCut that out idiot!\u201d you just laugh sending splashes of water his way in a barrage of waves. \u201cFine then. You asked for it princess.\u201d and thus you spent the rest of your afternoon having a salty water war and scavenging through tide pools for little treasures. Most of the time Bakugou screaming at you and you running off too happy without a care in the world.</p><p>After your little fun was over, the two took shelter under the wing of his dragon, resting against the smooth scales of the beast, watching the sun slowly start to set.</p><p>\u201cThat was fun. I totally kicked your butt.\u201d you chuckled to yourself. Bakugou gave you a disagreeing look and scoffed, \u201cYeah right. As if you could ever beat me princess, I\u2019m a fucking warlord.\u201d you roll your eyes at his narcissistic response. \u201cMan would you quit with that?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs, \u201cit\u2019s true, I\u2019m the best fucking fighter there is, no one-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that.\u201d </p><p>Raising a brow at you in confusion. \u201cYou haven\u2019t even bothered to learn my name, all you do is call me princess. I already told you I\u2019m not a princess. Far from it.\u201d</p><p>You sigh, staring at the orange hues that warmed up the sky. \u201c(y/n). (l/n)(y/n)\u201d tilting your head to the ash blonde. \u201cThat\u2019s my name.\u201d a small smirk pulls his lips, \u201cAlright (y/n). Then you can refer to me as \u2018my lord\u2019 hmm, or \u2018your majesty\u2019. Your pick\u201d </p><p>You lightly punch his shoulder, \u201cJeez what is wrong with you\u201d he snickers, your gaze going back to the sky laying there in silence for a bit. </p><p>\u201cKatsuki.\u201d his voice low, almost a whisper. </p><p>\u201cKatsuki?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name. Bakugou Katsuki.\u201d </p><p>Your eyes widen and your irises glow in amusement. You nod happily. Finally some progress.</p><p>\u201cOk Katsuki!\u201d</p><p>Maybe staying here wouldn\u2019t be all that bad.</p>",
                "content": "<p>You were awoken the next morning when a knock on the door echoed through your room, and the soft muffle of a familiar voice heard through the wall. </p><p>&ldquo;(y/n), wake up and come eat breakfast&rdquo; he called. You got up, opening the door still in your groggy state and greeting your newfound friend, following him down to the dining room. You were dressed in the white night gown he had provided you last night in place of your torn dress.</p><p>And of course, the blonde male was already down there, devouring his plate. The atmosphere tense, and not daring to speak a word. Both choosing to ignore one another, you grabbed your own plate of food and sat next to your friend.</p><p>You opted to engage into small conversation with Bernard, not even batting an eyelash to the ash blonde. Seeing you carrying on such a carefree attitude, despite yesterday&rsquo;s events, seemed to fuel the male making his blood boil. How could you just ignore him? You were just a shitty brat? How did you even manage to be speaking so calmly? And to a peasant what more?</p><p>Was he jealous?</p><p>&ldquo;Hey brat&rdquo; he called, but you went on with your conversation with your friend uninterrupted.</p><p>An irk mark surfaced his skin knowing you were purposefully ignoring him. &ldquo;Oi, princess I know you heard me.&rdquo;</p><p>You side eyed him giving him a quick glance then turning your attention back to Bernard. Oh we were gonna be petty huh? Well we can be petty. <i>We can fucking be petty.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Well since you&rsquo;re not answering me I guess that means I&rsquo;ll be going outside by myself today&hellip;&rdquo; he sighs, doing his best to keep a smirk from showing on his face. Leaning his head on the palm of hand and resting his elbow on top of the table, keeping his face bored and uninterested. &ldquo;I was gonna fly by the Suijin Kingdom, they&rsquo;re pretty close to the ocean. Heard the water there is so clear you couldn&rsquo;t even tell if there was water there, maybe I&rsquo;ll even go for a little dip myself&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>Your ears perked up at his words, but you stay defiant and held your ground. </p><p>You heard the scraping of the chair against the wooden floor as Bakugou got up from his seat, and turning towards the door. You swallowed the lump in your throat as you pondered at the thought of the ocean. When had been the last time you had gone to the beach or even seen one? Being able to feel the cool ocean waves hit your legs, and feel the sand digging in between your toes just sounded so&hellip; <i>enticing&hellip;.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Wait.&rdquo; </p><p>Gotcha.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re taking me with you&hellip;I&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Now looking at you from the corner of his eye, that smirk he was hiding now stretched across his face. &ldquo;I want to see the ocean.&rdquo;</p><p>Turning back around, crimson irises now making eye contact with your (e/c) ones. His shit eating smirk now in full display. </p><p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s get a move on princess.&rdquo;</p><p>~</p><p>You dressed back into your torn dress. Internally cursing to yourself for not even considering packing at least some extra clothes from home. Well it hadn&rsquo;t been all that bad, with the breeze seeping through the manmade entrance and running up your exposed calves. Everything important was in tact and covered up, you could be thankful for that in the least. </p><p>The flight wasn&rsquo;t too bad. Your stomach flipped occasionally due to still not being used to flying, but you were able to hold back any of your breakfast from coming back up. Luckily you weren&rsquo;t in the sky for too long, Bakugou informing you that they were going to make a pit stop in a city in Suijin Kingdom. </p><p>You landed in front of a tall gate, which granted access to the city that was secured within the connecting walls of the gate.
