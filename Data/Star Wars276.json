I think that Obi Wan needs (Y/N)\u2019s company and vice versa.

The young woman could hear some muffled cries,\nbut the door was closed. </p><p>With a sigh, she turned\nher back to the door only to be greeted by the young Anakin Skywalker, a little\nboy Obi-Wan and his Master had found on Tatooine. </p><p>\u201cHello little Padawan,\u201d\nshe greeted him with a smile on her face. The boy blinked at her for a moment\nwithout any expression.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry Master\n(Y/L/N), Master Kenobi will be fine,\u201d the young boy tried reassure her and she\nruffled his hair slightly.</p><p>\u201cThank you for your words,\nAnakin.\u201d (Y/N) left the boy near the doors, but her worry for her friend grew\nas she distanced herself from his chambers.</p><p>Obi-Wan now had the task\nto train the young Skywalker to be a Jedi. Hopefully, it distracted him from\nthe loss of his Master.</p><p>Or so she had hoped to the\nForce.</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cAnakin, calm down. I can\nsense you uneasiness,\u201d Obi-Wan scolded the his Padawan, but the young man\ncouldn\u2019t hide his excitement of seeing Padme once again after such a long time.</p><p>With a little smirk he\nturned to his Master.</p><p>\u201cIs it my uneasiness,\nMaster? Or is it yours of seeing Master (Y/L/N)?\u201d Anakin laughed a bit as he\nsaw the shocked expression of his Master.</p><p>He was ready to scold him,\ntelling him once more about the Jedi Code and forbidden affections, when the\nelevator doors chimed open.</p><p>In front it waited (Y/N)\npatiently for the both to step out.</p><p>Her (Y/H/C) hair was bound\ninto a compact braided bun, still some strands fell down from it, her brown\nrobes hugged her form and flew down to the ground as she started to grin.</p><p>\u201cObi-Wan,\u201d she cheered and\nhugged her old friend tightly. Taken aback by her actions, Obi-Wan carefully\nlaid his arms around her and patted her back, making Anakin snicker behind him.</p><p>She let go of her friend\nand turned to his Padawan, needing to look up at him. A teasing smile crossed\nher lips.</p><p>\u201cWell, someone ate their\nvegetables,\u201d Anakin rolled his eyes at her comment but he smiled.</p><p>\u201cHello, Master (Y/L/N),\u201d he\nalso got a warm hug from the woman, making Obi-Wan a bit jealous, but quickly\nhe got rid of this emotion. It didn\u2019t suit a Jedi like him.</p><p>\u201cFollow me. I am sure\nPadme is glad to see you, too,\u201d and with that, she led the way to the Senator.</p><p>-</p><p>It was night time and\neverything was quiet. Everything expect for Obi-Wan\u2019s mind, which was racing\naround many topics, but no matter what he did, his thoughts wandered back to\n(Y/N).</p><p>Not seeing the point in\nlaying in bed, drowning in his own thoughts, he got up and left his room.</p><p>He felt conflicted ever\nsince he met (Y/N) again. She grew even more beautiful than he had feared it to\nbe. </p><p>Her (Y/E/C) haunted his\ndreams, her laugh made his heart skip a beat. Feelings he had sworn to never\ndevelop boiled in the depths of his heart.</p><p>It was against the Jedi\nCode, against everything he stood for and believed in. Still, he didn\u2019t want to\nlose this feeling he had when he was so near her.</p><p>\u201cObi-Wan?\u201d her voice\nsounded in his ears and he quickly turned around to see (Y/N) standing in the\ndark halls, her night robes tightly around her body.</p><p>\u201cWhat are doing \u00a0this\nlate at night?\u201d she asked with a tilted head and worry in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026couldn\u2019t sleep,\u201d he\nanswered truthfully to her and she nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing at\nthese late hours?\u201d he asked after an uncomfortable silence. </p><p>They both started to walk\naround the halls, as (Y/N) explained her grief about the death of her Master. A\nmission gone horribly wrong, she blamed herself for it.</p><p>The man stopped in his\ntracks, making the woman turn to him. Obi-Wan pulled at her shoulders, pulling\nher close to him so he could see her eyes clearly.</p><p>\u201cNothing was your fault,\u201d\nhe whispered. \u201cYou did everything you were capable of. Master Meelto, for sure,\nwas proud of you,\u201d a silent tear escaped her eye, but he caught it with his\nthumb as he grazed her cheek lightly.</p><p>For a moment, he was\nconflicted with himself. One half wanted to kiss her so badly, but the other\nscolded himself for these unappreciated thoughts. The Code stood between him\nand his feelings he had for (Y/N).</p><p>While his mind tried to\nget a solution to his dilemma, his body reacted faster. </p><p>He leant into (Y/N), their\nlips barely met, but neither of them flinched away.</p><p>As he realized what he\ndid, it was too late. Their lips met in a shy kiss.</p><p>Quickly, Obi-Wan pulled\naway, scared of what he had done, of the reaction she might have.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t\u2026\u201d he whispered\nlowly. \u201cThe Code\u2026\u201d but she pressed a finger to his lips to silence him.</p><p>\u201cForget this Code just for\ntonight\u2026\u201d she pleaded him and it seemed that this was it, what he needed to\nhear from her to kiss her once again.</p><p>This time the kiss was\nmore confident, full of passion and love.</p><p>Tonight, they weren\u2019t Jedi\nanymore. Tonight, they were two people who enjoyed the love of the other and no\nCode shall stop them.</p>",

The young woman could hear some muffled cries,\nbut the door was closed. </p><p>With a sigh, she turned\nher back to the door only to be greeted by the young Anakin Skywalker, a little\nboy Obi-Wan and his Master had found on Tatooine. </p><p>&ldquo;Hello little Padawan,&rdquo;\nshe greeted him with a smile on her face. The boy blinked at her for a moment\nwithout any expression.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry Master\n(Y/L/N), Master Kenobi will be fine,&rdquo; the young boy tried reassure her and she\nruffled his hair slightly.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you for your words,\nAnakin.&rdquo; (Y/N) left the boy near the doors, but her worry for her friend grew\nas she distanced herself from his chambers.</p><p>Obi-Wan now had the task\nto train the young Skywalker to be a Jedi. Hopefully, it distracted him from\nthe loss of his Master.</p><p>Or so she had hoped to the\nForce.</p><p>-</p><p>&ldquo;Anakin, calm down. I can\nsense you uneasiness,&rdquo; Obi-Wan scolded the his Padawan, but the young man\ncouldn&rsquo;t hide his excitement of seeing Padme once again after such a long time.</p><p>With a little smirk he\nturned to his Master.</p><p>&ldquo;Is it my uneasiness,\nMaster? Or is it yours of seeing Master (Y/L/N)?&rdquo; Anakin laughed a bit as he\nsaw the shocked expression of his Master.</p><p>He was ready to scold him,\ntelling him once more about the Jedi Code and forbidden affections, when the\nelevator doors chimed open.</p><p>In front it waited (Y/N)\npatiently for the both to step out.</p><p>Her (Y/H/C) hair was bound\ninto a compact braided bun, still some strands fell down from it, her brown\nrobes hugged her form and flew down to the ground as she started to grin.</p><p>&ldquo;Obi-Wan,&rdquo; she cheered and\nhugged her old friend tightly. Taken aback by her actions, Obi-Wan carefully\nlaid his arms around her and patted her back, making Anakin snicker behind him.</p><p>She let go of her friend\nand turned to his Padawan, needing to look up at him. A teasing smile crossed\nher lips.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, someone ate their\nvegetables,&rdquo; Anakin rolled his eyes at her comment but he smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello, Master (Y/L/N),&rdquo; he\nalso got a warm hug from the woman, making Obi-Wan a bit jealous, but quickly\nhe got rid of this emotion. It didn&rsquo;t suit a Jedi like him.</p><p>&ldquo;Follow me. I am sure\nPadme is glad to see you, too,&rdquo; and with that, she led the way to the Senator.</p><p>-</p><p>It was night time and\neverything was quiet. Everything expect for Obi-Wan&rsquo;s mind, which was racing\naround many topics, but no matter what he did, his thoughts wandered back to\n(Y/N).</p><p>Not seeing the point in\nlaying in bed, drowning in his own thoughts, he got up and left his room.</p><p>He felt conflicted ever\nsince he met (Y/N) again. She grew even more beautiful than he had feared it to\nbe. </p><p>Her (Y/E/C) haunted his\ndreams, her laugh made his heart skip a beat. Feelings he had sworn to never\ndevelop boiled in the depths of his heart.</p><p>It was against the Jedi\nCode, against everything he stood for and believed in. Still, he didn&rsquo;t want to\nlose this feeling he had when he was so near her.</p><p>&ldquo;Obi-Wan?&rdquo; her voice\nsounded in his ears and he quickly turned around to see (Y/N) standing in the\ndark halls, her night robes tightly around her body.</p><p>&ldquo;What are doing &nbsp;this\nlate at night?&rdquo; she asked with a tilted head and worry in her eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip;couldn&rsquo;t sleep,&rdquo; he\nanswered truthfully to her and she nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing at\nthese late hours?&rdquo; he asked after an uncomfortable silence. </p><p>They both started to walk\naround the halls, as (Y/N) explained her grief about the death of her Master. A\nmission gone horribly wrong, she blamed herself for it.</p><p>The man stopped in his\ntracks, making the woman turn to him. Obi-Wan pulled at her shoulders, pulling\nher close to him so he could see her eyes clearly.</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing was your fault,&rdquo;\nhe whispered. &ldquo;You did everything you were capable of. Master Meelto, for sure,\nwas proud of you,&rdquo; a silent tear escaped her eye, but he caught it with his\nthumb as he grazed her cheek lightly.</p><p>For a moment, he was\nconflicted with himself. One half wanted to kiss her so badly, but the other\nscolded himself for these unappreciated thoughts. The Code stood between him\nand his feelings he had for (Y/N).</p><p>While his mind tried to\nget a solution to his dilemma, his body reacted faster. </p><p>He leant into (Y/N), their\nlips barely met, but neither of them flinched away.</p><p>As he realized what he\ndid, it was too late. Their lips met in a shy kiss.</p><p>Quickly, Obi-Wan pulled\naway, scared of what he had done, of the reaction she might have.</p><p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo; he whispered\nlowly. &ldquo;The Code&hellip;&rdquo; but she pressed a finger to his lips to silence him.</p><p>&ldquo;Forget this Code just for\ntonight&hellip;&rdquo; she pleaded him and it seemed that this was it, what he needed to\nhear from her to kiss her once again.</p><p>This time the kiss was\nmore confident, full of passion and love.</p><p>Tonight, they weren&rsquo;t Jedi\nanymore. Tonight, they were two people who enjoyed the love of the other and no\nCode shall stop them.</p>",
