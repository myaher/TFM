I grew up being told I was the best, that I could do amazing things and was basically better than everyone thanks to being smart. I believed it. I thought I was the best.

That&rsquo;s it. So, to make up for that, he&rsquo;s angry. He&rsquo;s also angry because people seem to think they&rsquo;re just as good as or better than him. I was like that too. Constantly angry when others tried to best me (I still get like that sometimes). Angry to make up for my absolute lack of a real personality. I never got into physical fights over it, but verbal brawls were common. I was an extremely angry kid because I thought I was the best and other kids kept trying to beat me. And they couldn&rsquo;t. I thought they were pathetic.</p><p>Bakugou got knocked off his pedestal real fucking fast when he got to high school. Dozens of other kids had quirks he couldn&rsquo;t even imagine. He finally met others who were on par with his power. And some who were stronger. I got to high school and immediately realized I wasn&rsquo;t anything special. My intelligence was average at best.

Here\u2019s why.</p><p>He grew up being told he was the best, that he could do amazing things and was basically better than everyone thanks to his quirk. I grew up being told I was the best, that I could do amazing things and was basically better than everyone thanks to being smart. I believed it. I thought I was the best. I had scholar bowl awards and writing awards. I was on the honor roll every year. My intelligence became who I was, just like how Bakugou\u2019s quirk became who he was.</p><p>Bakugou\u2019s anger is compensation for lack of a developed personality. His quirk is who he is. That\u2019s it. So, to make up for that, he\u2019s angry. He\u2019s also angry because people seem to think they\u2019re just as good as or better than him. I was like that too. Constantly angry when others tried to best me (I still get like that sometimes). Angry to make up for my absolute lack of a real personality. I never got into physical fights over it, but verbal brawls were common. I was an extremely angry kid because I thought I was the best and other kids kept trying to beat me. And they couldn\u2019t. I thought they were pathetic.</p><p>Bakugou got knocked off his pedestal real fucking fast when he got to high school. Dozens of other kids had quirks he couldn\u2019t even imagine. He finally met others who were on par with his power. And some who were stronger. I got to high school and immediately realized I wasn\u2019t anything special. My intelligence was average at best. It was like a punch in the gut. I had been bested when I had always been told I was the best.</p><p>Bakugou gets angry when others don\u2019t come at him at 100%. If I\u2019m having a debate or something, I won\u2019t continue unless the other person is 100% involved.</p><p>All of his anger and insecurities are things I\u2019ve felt. He\u2019s the anime version of a gifted kid who found out he wasn\u2019t all that gifted. But this character didn\u2019t let it ruin him. He let it drive him to actually become the best. He\u2019s learning and adjusting. He didn\u2019t break because of it.</p><p>I did. I broke. I became the dreaded \u201cGifted Kid Burnout.\u201d I stopped caring about school and graduated with a 2.8 GPA. I failed two classes. I managed to graduate early, but only out of spite. Now I\u2019m 19, and don\u2019t know who I am.</p><p>Somehow this show\u2026 This ridiculous show about kids with super powers going to a hero school has inspired me. It\u2019s inspired me to figure out who I am. This character has inspired me to figure out who I am and how I can truly be the best and what I can do. </p><p>Maybe it\u2019s stupid to say a tv show character helped me, but it did. And I thank Horikoshi for that.</p><p>Thanks to this inspiration, I have a plan for my future. It\u2019s not what I planned when I was in high school. I\u2019m not going to go to a university to study weather-based science. But I\u2019m okay with that. I\u2019m going to do something I\u2019m good at and become the best at it. Because this goddamn tv show gave me a character who was just like me and made him better than me.</p><p>Sorry for my rambling and everything, but I wanted to explain why a character like Bakugou is my absolute favorite. </p><p>(Also I\u2019m an idiot and don\u2019t know how to do a Read More or whatever so y'all just gotta suffer through the long post.)</p></p>",

I tried my best to portray my character&rsquo;s disability and her and Kaminari&rsquo;s struggles with mental health as realistically as possible.</p><p>The title is inspired by the song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sd_2g-pVakw\">Heilig </a>by Tokio Hotel.

She was already a\ndisappointment as she was.</p><p>With that thought\nin mind, Moe forced herself to get up and do the things she was asked to do,\nbut soon \u2013 too soon, right when she poured the pills in her hand and realized <i>how easily she could take an extra pill and\nforget</i> \u2013 she found her thoughts swirling in her head again.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this.\nI\u2019m useless and weak and broken and weird and\u201d The broken string of words that\nshe slurred out, not actually hearing them because she didn\u2019t have her hearing\naids, was choked, breathless, waking an ancient terror that never left her body\nand soul.</p><p>Her hands felt\ncold and she let the pills fall down between her fingers to start idly\nscratching at her arms in an attempt to get some feeling in her frozen fingers,\nher eyes burning with tears, she felt so upset and useless and she couldn\u2019t\nbreathe, <i>oh kami </i>she couldn\u2019t\nbreathe.</p><p>She didn\u2019t\nremember falling on her side, but the feeling of the floor beneath her and the throbbing\nof her head where she banged it helped her try to focus. But everything was\nblurry and her head was buzzing, she was so tired, she should probably have\nstayed in bed for a while longer. Sleep sounded really good right now\u2026</p><p>She closed her\neyes and went to sleep.</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cMoe, wake up\nplease. C'mon baby, you\u2019re fine aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Denki cursed\nhimself for being so stupid, he should have picked up something was wrong right\nwhen Moe skipped school: she never skipped unless it was really bad.</p><p>And when he went\nto her house and knocked he just assumed she had her hearing aids off. How\ncould he have been such an idiot?</p><p>He gently patted\nher cheek, trying to get the girl to stir and wake up. When he saw her eyelids\nflicker and open slowly, grey eyes hooded by pale lashes, he breathed in relief\nand kissed her forehead. \u201cGood girl sweetie, you\u2019re doing amazing.\u201d\nHe praised and gently held her hands as she woke up groggily, blinking confused\nat him.</p><p>\u201cMhmh\u2026\nDenki\u2026?\u201d Moe slurred.</p><p>Denki nodded and gently\nkissed her forehead. \u201cLet\u2019s get you in bed okay fluffypuff?\u201d He said,\nmore to himself than to her, since she obliviously couldn\u2019t hear him. He helped\nher on her feet, legs shaking as a newborn foal as she clutched his hands\ntightly.</p><p>Once his girlfriend\nwas safely lying on the bed, still looking pretty confused and lost, he sat\nbeside her and tucked a strand of curls behind her ear, taking note of the\nangry red of her earlobes, as if she had been scratching them.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the\nfirst time Denki found his girlfriend in a state like this, he knew about her\nanxiety and how it took an heavy toll on her life and health. More than once\nMoe had confessed to him that she felt like she was losing her mind every time\nshe had a panic attack, the fact that it was always when she had her hearing\naids off only made her more terrified because there were no sounds, nothing\nthat could anchor her to reality.</p><p>With that thought\nin mind, he reached for the small box containing Moe\u2019s hearing aids on the\nbedside table, placing the other hand on Moe\u2019s shoulder and giving it a gentle\nsqueeze. \u201cC'mon Cotton candy, sit up for me?\u201d He asked. \u201cLet\u2019s\nput your hearing aids on, \u2018kay?\u201d</p><p>The girl only\nblinked slowly at him, sitting up with his help and letting him put on her the\nsmall objects.</p><p>With a soft click,\nMoe\u2019s world was not silent anymore.</p><p>Wind outside.</p><p>The neighbor\u2019s dog\nbarking.</p><p>Kaminari\u2019s breaths\nand his voice.</p><p>\u201cCan you hear\nme, sweetcheeks?\u201d She nodded. \u201cGreat!\u201d He smiled and gave her a\nsoft kiss on the tip of her nose. \u201cHow are you feeling now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter\u2026\u201d Moe\u2019s\nwords were still slow and slightly slurred, but she was starting to look more\nfocused on reality and Denki internally took a breath of relief for this.</p><p>\u201cDid you do what I\nasked? Drank a glass of water and took your meds?\u201d</p><p>Moe frowned, lost\nin thought. She didn\u2019t remember if she did it or not\u2026 she probably didn\u2019t.\nshe was taking her pills and they fell because\u2026</p><p>God, she was such\na disappointment, wasn\u2019t she?</p><p>Denki noticed her\nconfusion and the panic that she was starting to feel, and gave her a tight\nsqueeze on her hand. \u201cHey hey, it\u2019s not a big deal, okay? You can take them\ntomorrow. Now you need to eat some cookies and rest!\u201d He declared. Cookies sounded\nreally good to Moe and she perked up at the mention. \u201cI have the ones with chocolate\nchips!\u201d</p><p>In a matter of minutes,\nthe both of them were safely tucked under a blanket, a bag of cookies on Moe\u2019s\nlap as she laid her head against Denki\u2019s shoulder and kept an hand on his\nchest, gripping lightly at his shirt as her boyfriend played with her hair and\nmade stupid jokes. His other hand was gently tracing circles on Moe\u2019s wrist, feeling\nunder his fingertips the light rise of the scars he knew littered her arms. </p><p>In those moments\nhe wished he could protect her always, not letting anything hurt her, much less\nher own mind that turned against her for no reason. He wished that Moe could\nalways smile and laugh and be happy, like she deserved to be, and not be\nhaunted by anxiety and nothingness.</p><p>Denki hated not\nbeing able to help Moe like he wanted to. He loved her so much, and it hurt to\nknow he couldn\u2019t do anything but try to be always here for her when it all\nbecame too much. He could just be there and hold her, try to distract her from the\nstorm of her mind and hope it was enough.</p><p>\u201cI can hear you\nthinking, <i>Arashi</i>.\u201d Moe mumbled suddenly,\nmunching on a cookie.</p><p>\u201cSorry, <i>Kumo</i>.\u201d He kissed her forehead, smiling\napologetically. She hummed contentedly and closed her eyes, a soft smile on her\nface.</p><p>He would have done\nanything to see her smile like this.</p><p><i>\u201cdu wirst\nf\u00fcr mich, immer heilig sein<br>Ich sterb\u2019 f\u00fcr unsere Unsterblichkeit<br>Meine Hand von Anfang an<br>\u00fcber dir, ich glaub\u2019 an dich<br>du wirst f\u00fcr mich, immer heilig sein\u201d<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cTo me\nyou\u2019ll be forever sacred<br>I\u2019m dying\nbut I know<br>Our love\nwill live<br>Your hand\nabove<br>Like a dove<br>Over me<br>Remember<br>To me you\u2019ll\nbe forever sacred\u201d \u2013</i><b> Heilig, Tokio Hotel</b></p>",
