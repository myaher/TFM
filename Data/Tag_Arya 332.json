But she knew it wouldn&rsquo;t, and anyhow <b>Sansa</b> <b>was still in the city and would wash away too. When she remembered that, Arya decided to wish for Winterfell instead.</b></i>\u201d - Arya I, ACoK\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>Arya sipped at her tankard cautiously, between spoonfuls of pie still warm from the oven. Her father sometimes let them have a cup of beer, she remembered. <b>Sansa used to make a face at the taste and say that wine was ever so much finer, but Arya had liked it well enough. It made her sad to think of Sansa and her father</b>.</i>\n\u201c - Arya II, ACoK</p><p><i>\u201c Bugs weren&rsquo;t so bad when you got used to them. Worms were worse, but still not as bad as the pain in your belly after days without food. Finding bugs was easy, all you had to do was kick over a rock.<b> Arya had eaten a bug once when she was little, just to make Sansa screech, so she hadn&rsquo;t been afraid to eat another</b>. Weasel wasn&rsquo;t either, but Hot Pie retched up the beetle he tried to swallow, and Lommy and Gendry wouldn&rsquo;t even try.\u201d - </i>Arya V, ACoK</p><p>\u201c<i>Arya looked down at her ragged clothes and bare feet, all cracked and callused. She saw the dirt under her nails, the scabs on her elbows, the scratches on her hands. <b>Septa Mordane wouldn&rsquo;t even know me, I bet. Sansa might, but she&rsquo;d pretend not to</b>.</i>\u201d - Arya V, ACoK<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>Three black dogs raced across his faded yellow surcoat, and his face looked as hard as if it had been cut from stone. Suddenly Arya knew where she had seen those dogs before. The night of the tourney at King&rsquo;s Landing, all the knights had hung their shields outside their pavilions.<b> &ldquo;That one belongs to the Hound&rsquo;s brother,&rdquo; Sansa had confided when they passed the black dogs on the yellow field. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s even bigger than Hodor, you&rsquo;ll see.

Jon and Arya still have\na very, very close relationship as in the most recent book where Jon ends\nup dying to save Arya. Jon has almost no relationship with Sansa in the books\nand they are very indifferent and distant siblings who rarely think of each\nother and whose stories/plots have nothing to do with each other. </p><p>3. Sansa\nstill betrays her family as per the original outline and Tyrion is not in love\nwith her. Tyrion loved Shae while he was married to Sansa. <br/></p><p>4. There\nis foreshadowing in the books for both Jon/Arya and Jon/Dany. Some of the most\nheartfelt love in the books is between Jon and Arya \u2013 <i>what do you know of my heart, priestess? What do you know of my sister?\nNeedle was Jon Snow\u2019s smile. </i>And between Jon and Dany the foreshadowing of\n- <i>A blue flower grew from a chink in a\nwall of ice, and filled the air with sweetness.</i></p><p>5. Seeing\nas how Tyrion had a strange look on his face when Jon went into Dany\u2019s room, it\u2019s\npossible that we are actually getting some version of a Jon \u2013 Dany \u2013 Tyrion love\ntriangle on the show next season and possibly in the books as well. </p><p>6. When\nGRRM originally intended for Jon and Arya to fall in love, it was a passion\nthat <b><i>TORMENTS</i></b>\nthem both because they dearly loved each other as siblings and that love was\nnow turning into something else. GRRM is all about <b>forbidden love</b>. Jon\u2019s oaths as a brother of the NW are also a big\ndeal as he is sworn to celibacy. In the books, Jon finally breaks his oaths for\nArya and chooses love over duty. <br/></p><p>7. In the outline, Tyrion burns down Winterfell and Jon and Tyrion fight\nover Arya. In the books, Ramsay burns down Winterfell and Jon and Ramsay fight\nover fake Arya.</p><p>8. Jon constantly compares the women he is\nattracted to with Arya in the books. Ygritte and Val signify the tough, take no\nprisoners, pro-active women that Jon falls for. Dany would fit right in there\nas well \u2013 <i>lonely, lovely and lethal</i>.\nAs recent as book 5, Jon espouses a dislike for girls like Sansa - <i>A warrior princess, he decided, not some willowy creature who\nsits up in a </i>tower<i>, brushing her hair and waiting\nfor some knight to rescue her.</i></p><p>9. The show putting Sansa in\nthe North is often used to justify Jonsa. On the contrary, Sansa in the North\nhad nothing to do with Jonsa and everything to do with David and Dan finding\nSansa\u2019s book plot too boring to adapt to TV and wanting to give Sophie Turner\nsomething meaty to do. As Benioff states : </p><blockquote><p> And it\u2019s because of Turner\u2019s strength,\nBenioff continued, that it made sense to give Sansa a dramatic storyline this\nseason and to use Ramsay\u2019s engagement\u00a0for that very purpose. In fact, the\nshowrunners first thought about\u00a0putting <b>Sansa and Ramsay together back when they were writing season 2</b>. \u201c<b>We really wanted Sansa to play a major part\nthis season</b>,\u201d Benioff said. \u201c<b>If we\nwere going to stay absolutely faithful to the book, it was going to be very\nhard to do that. There was a subplot we loved from the books, but it used a\ncharacter that\u2019s not in the show.\u201d</b>\u00a0</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"http://ew.com/article/2015/04/26/game-thrones-sansa-ramsay-interview/\">http://ew.com/article/2015/04/26/game-thrones-sansa-ramsay-interview/</a><br/></p><p>So basically\nDavid and Dan wanted Sophie Turner/ Sansa to play a major role on the show,\nunlike in the books, and therefore put her in Winterfell instead of Jeyne Poole.Sansa\u2019s story on the show will be different to her book one. <br/></p><p>\u00a0So there it is.\nPlease stop using the original outline to justify Jonsa. If we actually take\nthe original outline into consideration then it does not bode well for Sansa at all.\nAs per the outline Sansa is most likely doomed and is going to end the series\ndead. GRRM has always maintained that he knew the ending way back in the early\nnineties. It is possible he is going for Jon/Arya. Or he is intending for\nJon/Dany. Either way one thing he is definitely not doing is Jon/Sansa\nconsidering how very little these characters have to do with each other in the\nbooks despite growing up as siblings. </p>",
