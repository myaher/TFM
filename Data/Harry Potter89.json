When no one reply but the sobbing grows louder, Harry pushes the door fully open. &ldquo;Draco, I know you probably want some time alone, but I just want to make sure that your alright.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;m not alright, Harry. My father, the person I&rsquo;ve been trying to make proud for all of my life, has pretty much just disowned me, and called me a disappointment. Do you think I&rsquo;m all right?!&rdquo; Draco looks at him incredulous and angry. Looking startled and bemused, his heart heavy and sad, but full of love too, Harry stares at him, Draco only really ever called him by his actually name before their relationship and early on.</p><p>&ldquo;Look I&rsquo;m sorry. I just wanted to know how you&rsquo;re doing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;d better leave right now, Harry. I don&rsquo;t have time for this bullshit. Thank you for your concern, now go.&rdquo; when the messy haired Gryffindor doesn&rsquo;t move Draco yells at him. As Harry exits the classroom, Draco hears him whisper something.</p><p>&ldquo;I think I better leave right now. Before I fall right now. I think I better leave right now. I&rsquo;m feeling weaker and weaker.&rdquo;</p></p>",

Don&rsquo;t forget to send it!&rdquo; Potter left the room savouring the beverage.</p><p>What the hell had just happened?</p></p>",
