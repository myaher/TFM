Don&rsquo;t worry, I am still writing An Unexpected Journey, but I needed a little break from it. I ended up getting writers block on it and I just need some time to get out of that funk&hellip;so that is why I decided to write this one. I only plan on making two more parts to this one but&hellip;.I don&rsquo;t really know, it make be longer. Anyway, as an early bday gift to myself (It&rsquo;s tomorrow) I decided to give you all the next part. I hope you enjoy!!\n\n<br/></p><!-- more --><p>The <i>Nymeria </i>docked in Griffin\u2019s Roost in the early morn.\nThe sun had yet to rise above the horizon and the sea let off a light fog. Arya\nhad wanted to leave to Storm\u2019s End as soon as the ship had been tied and the\nanchor dropped, but Aries had convinced her to wait until midday. The crew had\nworked tirelessly to get her here faster than normal and deserved to rest for a\ntime. Most of them had agreed to stay on the ship and explore the local inns\nwhile Aries, Donovan, Sienna, and Alyse had agreed to travel with Arya on the\ntwo day trek to Storm\u2019s End. </p><p>She was hesitant at first, just wanting to travel with Bella and\nherself, but again, Aries had suggested that it would be better for them to\ncome along in case she needed help with the babe. </p><p>In her haste to reach Strom\u2019s End, it seemed all logically\nthinking that be wiped from her being. Perhaps it had to do with her excitement\nof being back in Westeros. But Aries had thought it was just her nerves of\nseeing Gendry again. Arya would never admit to it, Aries knew this, but it was\never present that she was nervous. She didn\u2019t know what to expect. He could\nhave gotten married, for all she knew, but she wouldn\u2019t be the Arya that she is\nif she didn\u2019t at least try to see for herself. </p><p>Sienna had voiced Arya\u2019s concerns the morning they docked. </p><p>\u201cHe could have moved on, you are aware of that?\u201d She questioned. </p><p>Arya gave a hesitant nod, \u201cOf course I am aware. I just feel like\nhe should know Bella exists. If he wants nothing to do with us, then so be it.\nI\u2019ll board my ship once more and sail for Bravos and raise my daughter myself.\u201d\n</p><p>Arya had maintained a tough exterior, but Sienna knew deep down\nthat she was screaming on the inside. </p><p>Sienna shook her head and continued to fold garments into a small\ntrunk. They weren\u2019t taking many things, just a few to last them the days on the\nroad. Arya had wanted to pack lightly, hoping it would help them make the\njourney faster. </p><p>\u201cHave you thought of what you would say to him?\u201d Sienna asked as\nshe placed the last piece of clothing in the trunk. </p><p>Arya sighed, \u201cHonestly?\nNo I haven\u2019t. How do I explain to him that I had a babe and it\u2019s his?\u201d </p><p>Sienna gave a curt laugh, \u201cYou say exactly that. Will his feeling\nbe crushed? Of course, but you have to make him see why you did what you did.\nIf he doesn\u2019t accept that, it is his loss.\u201d </p><p>Arya couldn\u2019t help but smile at the woman. She truly had become\nlike a mother to her and couldn\u2019t bear to part ways with her. Her and Alyse\nwere good company and would make a welcome addition to Storm\u2019s End, if Gendry\nwould have them. Even Aries and Donovan could help around the keep. Arya was\nsure that Storm\u2019s End could use more sailors like Aries and Donovan was a\nparticularly good cook. He could make the best stew, although is bread needed\nwork. </p><p>Arya knew midday had arrived when the sun was at its highest. She\ngathered her small traveling party and departed on the road leading to Strom\u2019s\nEnd. They each were able to acquire a horse, thanks to Alysa\u2019s clever flirting,\nmaking the trip a little less uncomfortable. Aries had agreed to carry the\ntrunk of all their clothing and the women rotated carrying Bella. Although she\nwas small babe, carrying an extra 14 pounds put stress on ones back and Arya\nwas truly grateful for the help. \u00a0</p><p>They road all day until they upon a small inn halfway through\ntheir ride. With Bella getting irritable and Aries\u2019 back aching from the added\nweight, they all decided to rest for the night before continuing on. </p><p>Arya had made quick work on settling down the babe and putting\nher to rest. She had surprised herself at how much better she was getting at\nbeing a mother. All she had were the old memories of her mother caring for\nRickon and tried her best to imitate the past. Of course she had Sienna, but\neven Arya knew that no two mothers were going to be the same when it came to\ncaring for their child. Each would learn their own ways and that was what Arya\nwas doing. </p><p>Arya wasn\u2019t going to be a conventional mother, she vowed to raise\nher daughter the way she would raise a son; without boundaries or limitations.\nShe wanted Bella to grow up running in fields and wielding swords. She wanted\nher to shoot arrows and run a castle, all while still being a fierce lady she\nknew she would grow to be. Arya never wants to force her child into becoming\nsomething that they are not; traditions be damned. </p><p>Arya looked down at the sleeping babe. Her hair had gotten\nslightly longer and it reminded Arya so much of Gendry. She was the spitting\nimage of him, even down to her tiny hands. She could only imagine what the babe\nwould look like when she grew older. <i>Certainly like a Baratheon, she\u2019d\nprobably have the fury of one too, </i>Arya thought. </p><p>A soft knock broke Arya\u2019s gaze from her sleeping child. She made\nher way to the door and opened it reveling Aries with a bowl of what seemed to\nbe soup, if they could call it that. </p><p>\u201cI brought some soup for you, figured you\u2019d be hungry from the\nlong ride.\u201d He said as he handed her the bowl. </p><p>She took it from him and looked at the contents. Her stomach went\nqueasy and she decided to pass on the substance. No amount of hunger would\ncompel her to eat that concoction. The smell alone could clear a forest of any\ncreature. Arya has eaten plenty of grotesque things in her life, but that soup\nwould be by far be the worst thing she would ever stick in her mouth. </p><p>Aries took note of Arya\u2019s face and laughed, \u201cPerhaps you should\ntell that blacksmith of yours to hire better cooks for the inn.\u201d </p><p>Arya cocked an eyebrow, \u201cSomeone like Donovan?\u201d </p><p>Aries blushed. Since their time on <i>Nymeria, </i>the two had\ngotten close; closer than any man that Aries had the pleasure of knowing. He\nwas beginning to fall in love with him and it gave him an exciting feeling. </p><p>\u201cMayhap.\u201d He said slyly. </p><p>Arya smiled and gave him a hug. He was truly shocked by the\ngesture but returned the embrace. When he met the stubborn she wolf, she had\nbeen distant and hard, but now, as new mother, she had opened up and let him\nsee a side of her that he believed she rarely showed anyone. </p><p>She was smiling more and her laugh would now bellow out for all\nto hear. That cold exterior had melted and he believed it had to do with the\nbabe that softly snoring on the bed beside them. </p><p>\u201cTry to get some rest. We have a long day tomorrow, she wolf. Oh,\nDonovan wanted me to tell you he will carry Bella for most of the way.\u201d Aries\nsmiled. </p><p>Arya gave a nod, \u201cI will get rest. Now go, enjoy your lover.\u201d </p><p>She shooed him away and locked the door behind him. She disrobed\nand climbed into bed, nuzzling next to her babe. </p><p>When dawn broke, the traveling party were the first to rise. They\nhad made good time the day prior and Arya wanted to get to Storm\u2019s End before\nmidday. The anticipation was eating her up inside and she didn\u2019t know if she\ncould take much for any longer. </p><p>They paid their dues to the innkeeper and headed out on the road\nahead. Donovan stayed true to his word and carried Bella nearly the whole way.\nIt wasn\u2019t until she began to get fussy, that Arya took her. </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s probably hungry.\u201d Arya said as Donovan handed her the\nbabe. </p><p>She quickly undid her laces and pulled her cotton shirt aside for\nthe babe to have easy access to her breast. Bella latched on almost immediately\nand began to suckle the milk Arya had produced. It amazed Arya at how much the\nbabe could eat. She was of average size, according to Sienna, but the child\ncould eat that of two babes. </p><p>\u201cWell she\u2019s a greedy one.\u201d Observed Donovan. </p><p>\u201cAye, she is.\u201d Arya agreed. </p><p>They rested while Arya fed Bella, each gaining their composure\nbefore they finished the trek ahead. </p><p>Arya had estimated that they had a few hours of riding left and\nonce she finished burping the babe, they were on their way. Arya had held on to\nBella for the rest of their journey. She wanted to keep her close and obscured\nfrom any prying eyes. She didn\u2019t need unfamiliar people asking unwanted questions.\n</p><p>She was sure that people wouldn\u2019t be able to recognize to her;\nshe had never been in the Stormlands and she doubted the people ventured to\nKing\u2019s Landing in the time she had been there, considering it was and still is\nbeing rebuilt. </p><p>As they made their way through the small town nestled right\noutside Storm\u2019s End, Arya couldn\u2019t help but feel the staring eyes. She hadn\u2019t\nthought the five of them would stir any talk, but perhaps she was mistaken. </p><p>\u201cIs that it? The castle is huge!\u201d Alyse exclaimed. She\u2019d only\never seen the Red Keep and didn\u2019t think that there were castles just as big in\nother parts of Westeros. She had heard the stories as a child, but never\nthought she would lay eyes on such castles. </p><p>\u201cI guess you blacksmith isn\u2019t doing too badly for himself.\u201d Aries\nmused. </p><p>But all the awes that her companions had mustered were nothing\ncompared to the joy she felt within her heart. She had finally made it and she\ncouldn\u2019t me more nervous. She was excited, but her nerves were beginning to\ntake over. She thought about all her insecurities and her lack of affection she\nhad shown to him the last time she saw him. What if she was too late and he had\nalready married, or worse, what if he didn\u2019t want her? </p><p>Her heart began to race and she began feeling much like she when\nshe was about to give birth to Bella. The panic was swelling and at that very\nmoment she wanted to take her horses\u2019 reins and steer them in the opposite\ndirection. </p><p>Sienna could see the panic set in Arya\u2019s eyes and she immediately\npulled her horse to stand beside the girl. </p><p>\u201cDo not panic. Everything will turn out like it is supposed to\nbe. If you wish to turn around, we will, and if you wish to move forward, all\nof us will follow. But this is your choice and only you can make it.\u201d Sienna\ntold her. </p><p>Arya gulped, trying to calm her panic. This was the choice Bran\nhad talked about, Arya knew it in her gut. She looked down at the babe cradled\nat her chest; her peaceful face filled with slumber. It only took that one look\nand she knew what she had to do. </p><p>She nudged her horse to move forward and they made their way to\nthe castle gates. </p><p>Four guards were manning the entrance, each with armor adorning\nthe Baratheon sigil. They had swords ate their hips and war hammers in their\nhands. It seemed they were ready for any threat that would make themselves\nknown. </p><p>\u201cSpeak your business!\u201d One guard bellowed. </p><p>\u201cI wish to speak to the lord! We have traveled far and seek\nrefreshment.\u201d Arya yelled back. </p><p>The guards spoke among themselves before gesturing for the five\nto make their way through the castle gates. Arya thanked them and followed one\nguard to the courtyard. </p><p>\u201cWait here, the squire went to fetch the lord.\u201d The guard said.\nArya nodded and followed his instructions. </p><p>It hadn\u2019t been more than a few minutes when woman about Aries\u2019\nage emerged from the castle. Her hair was a thick black mane and her eyes were\nthat all too familiar Baratheon blue. She was dressed in a light corseted vest\nand trousers. Her boots came up to her knees and she had a small sword strapped\nto her waist. She stood tall and with an attitude that Arya knew all too well. </p><p>Arya gently jumped off her horse, being mindful of Bella strapped\nto her chest, and approached the woman. </p><p>\u201cMay I help you with something?\u201d The woman spoke. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking to speak with Lord Gendry Baratheon, is he here?\u201d\nArya asked. </p><p>The woman pressed her lips into a thin line. She was studying\nArya from head to toe. She was dressed much like the woman in front of her,\nwith her own weapons fashioned at her waist. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not here, but you have me instead, Lady Mya Baratheon.\u201d She\nsaid calmly. </p><p>Arya\u2019s heart began to shatter. The woman standing in front of her\nwas Gendry\u2019s wife and here she was walking in her home to tell her husband of\nhis bastard child. Arya began to feel sick. She wasn\u2019t sure how to respond. At\nthat moment, she wanted to climb back onto her horse and run away from all her\nproblems. </p><p>\u201cI-I am sorry. I should not have come.\u201d Arya\u2019s voice was no more\nthan a whisper. She began to climb back on her horse when the women grabbed her\narm, stopping her from doing so. </p><p>\u201cWait! Who did you say you were?\u201d She asked. </p><p>Arya meet her blue eyes, \u201cMy name is Arya Stark of Winterfell, my\nlady.\u201d </p><p>\u201cArya Stark? <i>The </i>Arya Stark? My Gods, I have heard so many\nthings about you from Gendry!\u201d Arya could see the excitement in the woman\u2019s\neyes and it filled her with utter confusion. </p><p>\u201cHe told you about me? Why would he do that?\u201d Arya asked her. </p><p>Mya scoffed, as if the answer was obvious, \u201cBecause he is madly\nin love you, that\u2019s why!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd&hellip;You\u2019re okay with that?\u201d Confusion laced Arya\u2019s voice. </p><p>\u201cOf course, why wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d Mya asked her. </p><p>\u201cWell because you are his wife. You should want me dead, not\npraise his love for me.\u201d </p><p>Mya burst into laughter. It was the kind of laughter that made\nyour belly hurt and your eyes water. Arya looked at her in shock, she couldn\u2019t\nbelieve what she was seeing. </p><p>\u201cWhy are you laughing?\u201d </p><p>\u201cGendry is not my husband! He\u2019s my brother! It\u2019s a long story,\nbut we\u2019re siblings.\u201d Mya assured her. </p><p>Arya let out a breath she didn\u2019t know she was holding. There was\na weight lifted off of her and she felt like she could finally relax. </p><p>\u201cSo, he\u2019s not married?\u201d Arya needed that confirmation. </p><p>\u201cNo! My brother is not married.\u201d Mya assured her. </p><p>Arya\u2019s face broke out into a smile. She felt a happiness swell\ninside her that she hadn\u2019t felt since Bella was born. She looked down at the\nbabe once more and saw that she was now wide awake. </p><p>Mya followed her gaze and peeked into the cradled wrap holding\nthe babe in place. What she saw took her breath away. Inside was a small babe\nwho looked exactly like her brother; exactly like her. Everything was beginning\nto make sense and she looked up at Arya, never needing to ask the question. Her\neyes had said it all. The babe was no doubt, her brothers. </p><p>\u201cHarold, make up two rooms for our other guest. Make sure they\nare fed and well rested.\u201d Mya said to the squire. The young squire quickly\nnodded his head and ran back inside the castle. </p><p>Mya turned towards the remaining party, \u201cIf you could follow my\nguard, he will take you to the stables to rest your horses. I will have Harold\ncome fetch you to show you to your rooms.\u201d</p><p>Arya gave a nod to Aries to follow, \u201cI will meet up with you lot\nshortly.\u201d </p><p>Aries smiled and galloped behind the rest of the traveling crew. </p><p>Arya turned to Mya and began following the tall woman inside the\ncastle, making sure to keep Bella concealed. Mya lead Arya up a winding stair\ncase, reaching up to the top of the tower that could be seen from Griffin\u2019s\nRoost. </p><p>They reached a large door and Mya had easily pushed it open.\nInside was a large solar with an oak table in the middle. There were six chairs\nseated around the table and a tray of food resting on top of it. Arya had noticed\nthat it had not been touched, that is until Mya took a chunk of bread and\nstuffed it in her mouth. She hummed with delight and began to pour two goblets\nof wine. </p><p>\u201cPlease, have seat. You must be hungry as well.\u201d Mya pushed the\ntray of food to Arya\u2019s direction. She immediately went straight for the grapes\non the tray and shoved them in her mouth. She had been ravenous, her appetite\nfinally coming back to her. \u00a0</p><p>Mya let Arya indulge in the food before she began to question the\nyoung girl. She may have heard the stories from Gendry, but she didn\u2019t fully\ntrust the wolf yet. </p><p>\u201cSo the babe is his then?\u201d Mya casually took a sip of her wine.\nShe studied Arya\u2019s reaction and noticed a cold exterior that would be difficult\nto crack. </p><p>Arya gave a slight nod; a blush rushing to her cheeks. Aside from\nthe people she trusted, she hadn\u2019t explicitly stated out loud that Bella was\nGendry\u2019s. She didn\u2019t want the wrong ears to hear and get word to Gendry. She\nknew Westeros, and word tended to travel fast throughout the seven kingdoms.\nShe wanted to be able to tell him that they had created a child together, and\nnot some stranger he didn\u2019t know. </p><p>\u201cAye, I see it. I mean she looks exactly like us.\u201d Mya quipped. </p><p>Arya was beginning to get irritated with the woman. She had come\nto Storm\u2019s End to see Gendry, not his half-sister that he didn\u2019t know existed. </p><p>\u201cWhere is Gendry?\u201d Arya asked, her tone harsh. </p><p>Mya lifted an eyebrow, \u201cHe is out. He should be back sometime\nafter dinner. You can wait for him here. It is his chambers after all.\u201d </p><p>Arya\u2019s eyes narrowed. She knew that this Mya had ulterior motives\nand she wanted to know exactly what those motives were. </p><p>\u201cMya, is it? I can\u2019t help but feel like you want to ask me a\nquestion. Please, don\u2019t be afraid, I don\u2019t bite\u2026much.\u201d A sly smile formed on\nArya\u2019s lips. She wanted to stir the woman in any way possible, even if it meant\nplay a game she hadn\u2019t played in a while. </p><p>Mya sighed. She had heard plenty of stories about the great Night\nKing slayer and not just from her brother. Word had traveled far and fast about\nthe young wolf and all about her journeys. Of course, one could not know if\nwhat was being said was truth, but Mya believed that perhaps it was. If she did\nin fact train with the faceless men than she had to tread careful, as to not\nstir direwolf inside of her. </p><p>\u201cVery well. I will play your game, Arya Stark of Winterfell. Why\nare you here? The last my brother saw of you, you were on a ship sailing away.\nI understand that you have his babe in your arms, but she was not the only\nreason you came back. I want to know why.\u201d Mya said in a low voice. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t owe anyone an explanation but Gendry. Once he returns, I\nwill tell him.\u201d Arya\u2019s eyes were like daggers. If looks could kill, Mya would surely\nbe dead. </p><p>Mya stayed focus on Arya, which is until a bang came through the\ndoor. </p><p>\u201cGood, then tell him.\u201d Mya\u2019s eyes flicked to the door. </p><p>Arya could feel a presence behind her. Every inch in her body\nwanted to turn to see him, but she couldn\u2019t. </p><p>\u201cTell me what?\u201d When he spoke, is was like the ice that froze her\nbody had suddenly melted and the only thing she needed was to look at him. </p><p>She turned in her chair and was faced with those oh-so familiar\ndeep blue eyes. </p>",

I hope you enjoy!!\n\n<br></p>[[MORE]]<p>The <i>Nymeria </i>docked in Griffin\u2019s Roost in the early morn.\nThe sun had yet to rise above the horizon and the sea let off a light fog. Arya\nhad wanted to leave to Storm\u2019s End as soon as the ship had been tied and the\nanchor dropped, but Aries had convinced her to wait until midday. The crew had\nworked tirelessly to get her here faster than normal and deserved to rest for a\ntime. Most of them had agreed to stay on the ship and explore the local inns\nwhile Aries, Donovan, Sienna, and Alyse had agreed to travel with Arya on the\ntwo day trek to Storm\u2019s End. </p><p>She was hesitant at first, just wanting to travel with Bella and\nherself, but again, Aries had suggested that it would be better for them to\ncome along in case she needed help with the babe. </p><p>In her haste to reach Strom\u2019s End, it seemed all logically\nthinking that be wiped from her being. Perhaps it had to do with her excitement\nof being back in Westeros. But Aries had thought it was just her nerves of\nseeing Gendry again. Arya would never admit to it, Aries knew this, but it was\never present that she was nervous. She didn\u2019t know what to expect. He could\nhave gotten married, for all she knew, but she wouldn\u2019t be the Arya that she is\nif she didn\u2019t at least try to see for herself. </p><p>Sienna had voiced Arya\u2019s concerns the morning they docked. </p><p>\u201cHe could have moved on, you are aware of that?\u201d She questioned. </p><p>Arya gave a hesitant nod, \u201cOf course I am aware. I just feel like\nhe should know Bella exists. If he wants nothing to do with us, then so be it.\nI\u2019ll board my ship once more and sail for Bravos and raise my daughter myself.\u201d\n</p><p>Arya had maintained a tough exterior, but Sienna knew deep down\nthat she was screaming on the inside. </p><p>Sienna shook her head and continued to fold garments into a small\ntrunk. They weren\u2019t taking many things, just a few to last them the days on the\nroad. Arya had wanted to pack lightly, hoping it would help them make the\njourney faster. </p><p>\u201cHave you thought of what you would say to him?\u201d Sienna asked as\nshe placed the last piece of clothing in the trunk. </p><p>Arya sighed, \u201cHonestly?\nNo I haven\u2019t. How do I explain to him that I had a babe and it\u2019s his?\u201d </p><p>Sienna gave a curt laugh, \u201cYou say exactly that. Will his feeling\nbe crushed? Of course, but you have to make him see why you did what you did.\nIf he doesn\u2019t accept that, it is his loss.\u201d </p><p>Arya couldn\u2019t help but smile at the woman. She truly had become\nlike a mother to her and couldn\u2019t bear to part ways with her. Her and Alyse\nwere good company and would make a welcome addition to Storm\u2019s End, if Gendry\nwould have them. Even Aries and Donovan could help around the keep. Arya was\nsure that Storm\u2019s End could use more sailors like Aries and Donovan was a\nparticularly good cook. He could make the best stew, although is bread needed\nwork. </p><p>Arya knew midday had arrived when the sun was at its highest. She\ngathered her small traveling party and departed on the road leading to Strom\u2019s\nEnd. They each were able to acquire a horse, thanks to Alysa\u2019s clever flirting,\nmaking the trip a little less uncomfortable. Aries had agreed to carry the\ntrunk of all their clothing and the women rotated carrying Bella. Although she\nwas small babe, carrying an extra 14 pounds put stress on ones back and Arya\nwas truly grateful for the help. \u00a0</p><p>They road all day until they upon a small inn halfway through\ntheir ride. With Bella getting irritable and Aries\u2019 back aching from the added\nweight, they all decided to rest for the night before continuing on. </p><p>Arya had made quick work on settling down the babe and putting\nher to rest. She had surprised herself at how much better she was getting at\nbeing a mother. All she had were the old memories of her mother caring for\nRickon and tried her best to imitate the past.

She wanted\nher to shoot arrows and run a castle, all while still being a fierce lady she\nknew she would grow to be. Arya never wants to force her child into becoming\nsomething that they are not; traditions be damned. </p><p>Arya looked down at the sleeping babe. Her hair had gotten\nslightly longer and it reminded Arya so much of Gendry. She was the spitting\nimage of him, even down to her tiny hands. She could only imagine what the babe\nwould look like when she grew older. <i>Certainly like a Baratheon, she\u2019d\nprobably have the fury of one too, </i>Arya thought. </p><p>A soft knock broke Arya\u2019s gaze from her sleeping child.

She didn\u2019t need unfamiliar people asking unwanted questions.\n</p><p>She was sure that people wouldn\u2019t be able to recognize to her;\nshe had never been in the Stormlands and she doubted the people ventured to\nKing\u2019s Landing in the time she had been there, considering it was and still is\nbeing rebuilt. </p><p>As they made their way through the small town nestled right\noutside Storm\u2019s End, Arya couldn\u2019t help but feel the staring eyes. She hadn\u2019t\nthought the five of them would stir any talk, but perhaps she was mistaken. </p><p>\u201cIs that it? The castle is huge!\u201d Alyse exclaimed. She\u2019d only\never seen the Red Keep and didn\u2019t think that there were castles just as big in\nother parts of Westeros. She had heard the stories as a child, but never\nthought she would lay eyes on such castles. </p><p>\u201cI guess you blacksmith isn\u2019t doing too badly for himself.\u201d Aries\nmused. </p><p>But all the awes that her companions had mustered were nothing\ncompared to the joy she felt within her heart. She had finally made it and she\ncouldn\u2019t me more nervous. She was excited, but her nerves were beginning to\ntake over. She thought about all her insecurities and her lack of affection she\nhad shown to him the last time she saw him. What if she was too late and he had\nalready married, or worse, what if he didn\u2019t want her? </p><p>Her heart began to race and she began feeling much like she when\nshe was about to give birth to Bella. The panic was swelling and at that very\nmoment she wanted to take her horses\u2019 reins and steer them in the opposite\ndirection. </p><p>Sienna could see the panic set in Arya\u2019s eyes and she immediately\npulled her horse to stand beside the girl. </p><p>\u201cDo not panic. Everything will turn out like it is supposed to\nbe. If you wish to turn around, we will, and if you wish to move forward, all\nof us will follow. But this is your choice and only you can make it.\u201d Sienna\ntold her. </p><p>Arya gulped, trying to calm her panic. This was the choice Bran\nhad talked about, Arya knew it in her gut. She looked down at the babe cradled\nat her chest; her peaceful face filled with slumber. It only took that one look\nand she knew what she had to do. </p><p>She nudged her horse to move forward and they made their way to\nthe castle gates. </p><p>Four guards were manning the entrance, each with armor adorning\nthe Baratheon sigil. They had swords ate their hips and war hammers in their\nhands. It seemed they were ready for any threat that would make themselves\nknown. </p><p>\u201cSpeak your business!\u201d One guard bellowed. </p><p>\u201cI wish to speak to the lord! We have traveled far and seek\nrefreshment.\u201d Arya yelled back. </p><p>The guards spoke among themselves before gesturing for the five\nto make their way through the castle gates. Arya thanked them and followed one\nguard to the courtyard. </p><p>\u201cWait here, the squire went to fetch the lord.\u201d The guard said.\nArya nodded and followed his instructions. </p><p>It hadn\u2019t been more than a few minutes when woman about Aries\u2019\nage emerged from the castle. Her hair was a thick black mane and her eyes were\nthat all too familiar Baratheon blue. She was dressed in a light corseted vest\nand trousers. Her boots came up to her knees and she had a small sword strapped\nto her waist. She stood tall and with an attitude that Arya knew all too well. </p><p>Arya gently jumped off her horse, being mindful of Bella strapped\nto her chest, and approached the woman. </p><p>\u201cMay I help you with something?\u201d The woman spoke. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking to speak with Lord Gendry Baratheon, is he here?\u201d\nArya asked. </p><p>The woman pressed her lips into a thin line. She was studying\nArya from head to toe. She was dressed much like the woman in front of her,\nwith her own weapons fashioned at her waist. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not here, but you have me instead, Lady Mya Baratheon.\u201d She\nsaid calmly. </p><p>Arya\u2019s heart began to shatter. The woman standing in front of her\nwas Gendry\u2019s wife and here she was walking in her home to tell her husband of\nhis bastard child. Arya began to feel sick. She wasn\u2019t sure how to respond. At\nthat moment, she wanted to climb back onto her horse and run away from all her\nproblems. </p><p>\u201cI-I am sorry. I should not have come.\u201d Arya\u2019s voice was no more\nthan a whisper. She began to climb back on her horse when the women grabbed her\narm, stopping her from doing so. </p><p>\u201cWait! Who did you say you were?\u201d She asked. </p><p>Arya meet her blue eyes, \u201cMy name is Arya Stark of Winterfell, my\nlady.\u201d </p><p>\u201cArya Stark? <i>The </i>Arya Stark? My Gods, I have heard so many\nthings about you from Gendry!\u201d Arya could see the excitement in the woman\u2019s\neyes and it filled her with utter confusion. </p><p>\u201cHe told you about me? Why would he do that?\u201d Arya asked her. </p><p>Mya scoffed, as if the answer was obvious, \u201cBecause he is madly\nin love you, that\u2019s why!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd\u2026You\u2019re okay with that?\u201d Confusion laced Arya\u2019s voice. </p><p>\u201cOf course, why wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d Mya asked her. </p><p>\u201cWell because you are his wife. You should want me dead, not\npraise his love for me.\u201d </p><p>Mya burst into laughter. It was the kind of laughter that made\nyour belly hurt and your eyes water. Arya looked at her in shock, she couldn\u2019t\nbelieve what she was seeing. </p><p>\u201cWhy are you laughing?\u201d </p><p>\u201cGendry is not my husband! He\u2019s my brother! It\u2019s a long story,\nbut we\u2019re siblings.\u201d Mya assured her. </p><p>Arya let out a breath she didn\u2019t know she was holding. There was\na weight lifted off of her and she felt like she could finally relax. </p><p>\u201cSo, he\u2019s not married?\u201d Arya needed that confirmation. </p><p>\u201cNo! My brother is not married.\u201d Mya assured her. </p><p>Arya\u2019s face broke out into a smile. She felt a happiness swell\ninside her that she hadn\u2019t felt since Bella was born. She looked down at the\nbabe once more and saw that she was now wide awake. </p><p>Mya followed her gaze and peeked into the cradled wrap holding\nthe babe in place. What she saw took her breath away. Inside was a small babe\nwho looked exactly like her brother; exactly like her. Everything was beginning\nto make sense and she looked up at Arya, never needing to ask the question. Her\neyes had said it all. The babe was no doubt, her brothers. </p><p>\u201cHarold, make up two rooms for our other guest. Make sure they\nare fed and well rested.\u201d Mya said to the squire. The young squire quickly\nnodded his head and ran back inside the castle. </p><p>Mya turned towards the remaining party, \u201cIf you could follow my\nguard, he will take you to the stables to rest your horses. I will have Harold\ncome fetch you to show you to your rooms.\u201d</p><p>Arya gave a nod to Aries to follow, \u201cI will meet up with you lot\nshortly.\u201d </p><p>Aries smiled and galloped behind the rest of the traveling crew. </p><p>Arya turned to Mya and began following the tall woman inside the\ncastle, making sure to keep Bella concealed. Mya lead Arya up a winding stair\ncase, reaching up to the top of the tower that could be seen from Griffin\u2019s\nRoost. </p><p>They reached a large door and Mya had easily pushed it open.\nInside was a large solar with an oak table in the middle. There were six chairs\nseated around the table and a tray of food resting on top of it. Arya had noticed\nthat it had not been touched, that is until Mya took a chunk of bread and\nstuffed it in her mouth. She hummed with delight and began to pour two goblets\nof wine. </p><p>\u201cPlease, have seat. You must be hungry as well.\u201d Mya pushed the\ntray of food to Arya\u2019s direction. She immediately went straight for the grapes\non the tray and shoved them in her mouth. She had been ravenous, her appetite\nfinally coming back to her. \u00a0</p><p>Mya let Arya indulge in the food before she began to question the\nyoung girl. She may have heard the stories from Gendry, but she didn\u2019t fully\ntrust the wolf yet. </p><p>\u201cSo the babe is his then?\u201d Mya casually took a sip of her wine.\nShe studied Arya\u2019s reaction and noticed a cold exterior that would be difficult\nto crack. </p><p>Arya gave a slight nod; a blush rushing to her cheeks. Aside from\nthe people she trusted, she hadn\u2019t explicitly stated out loud that Bella was\nGendry\u2019s. She didn\u2019t want the wrong ears to hear and get word to Gendry. She\nknew Westeros, and word tended to travel fast throughout the seven kingdoms.\nShe wanted to be able to tell him that they had created a child together, and\nnot some stranger he didn\u2019t know. </p><p>\u201cAye, I see it. I mean she looks exactly like us.\u201d Mya quipped. </p><p>Arya was beginning to get irritated with the woman. She had come\nto Storm\u2019s End to see Gendry, not his half-sister that he didn\u2019t know existed. </p><p>\u201cWhere is Gendry?\u201d Arya asked, her tone harsh. </p><p>Mya lifted an eyebrow, \u201cHe is out. He should be back sometime\nafter dinner. You can wait for him here. It is his chambers after all.\u201d </p><p>Arya\u2019s eyes narrowed. She knew that this Mya had ulterior motives\nand she wanted to know exactly what those motives were. </p><p>\u201cMya, is it? I can\u2019t help but feel like you want to ask me a\nquestion. Please, don\u2019t be afraid, I don\u2019t bite\u2026much.\u201d A sly smile formed on\nArya\u2019s lips. She wanted to stir the woman in any way possible, even if it meant\nplay a game she hadn\u2019t played in a while. </p><p>Mya sighed. She had heard plenty of stories about the great Night\nKing slayer and not just from her brother. Word had traveled far and fast about\nthe young wolf and all about her journeys. Of course, one could not know if\nwhat was being said was truth, but Mya believed that perhaps it was. If she did\nin fact train with the faceless men than she had to tread careful, as to not\nstir direwolf inside of her. </p><p>\u201cVery well. I will play your game, Arya Stark of Winterfell. Why\nare you here? The last my brother saw of you, you were on a ship sailing away.\nI understand that you have his babe in your arms, but she was not the only\nreason you came back. I want to know why.\u201d Mya said in a low voice. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t owe anyone an explanation but Gendry. Once he returns, I\nwill tell him.\u201d Arya\u2019s eyes were like daggers. If looks could kill, Mya would surely\nbe dead. </p><p>Mya stayed focus on Arya, which is until a bang came through the\ndoor. </p><p>\u201cGood, then tell him.\u201d Mya\u2019s eyes flicked to the door. </p><p>Arya could feel a presence behind her. Every inch in her body\nwanted to turn to see him, but she couldn\u2019t. </p><p>\u201cTell me what?\u201d When he spoke, is was like the ice that froze her\nbody had suddenly melted and the only thing she needed was to look at him. </p><p>She turned in her chair and was faced with those oh-so familiar\ndeep blue eyes. </p>",

Don\u2019t worry, I am still writing An Unexpected Journey, but I needed a little break from it. I ended up getting writers block on it and I just need some time to get out of that funk\u2026so that is why I decided to write this one. I only plan on making two more parts to this one but\u2026.I don\u2019t really know, it make be longer. Anyway, as an early bday gift to myself (It\u2019s tomorrow) I decided to give you all the next part. I hope you enjoy!!\n\n<br></p>[[MORE]]<p>The <i>Nymeria </i>docked in Griffin\u2019s Roost in the early morn.\nThe sun had yet to rise above the horizon and the sea let off a light fog. Arya\nhad wanted to leave to Storm\u2019s End as soon as the ship had been tied and the\nanchor dropped, but Aries had convinced her to wait until midday. The crew had\nworked tirelessly to get her here faster than normal and deserved to rest for a\ntime. Most of them had agreed to stay on the ship and explore the local inns\nwhile Aries, Donovan, Sienna, and Alyse had agreed to travel with Arya on the\ntwo day trek to Storm\u2019s End. </p><p>She was hesitant at first, just wanting to travel with Bella and\nherself, but again, Aries had suggested that it would be better for them to\ncome along in case she needed help with the babe. </p><p>In her haste to reach Strom\u2019s End, it seemed all logically\nthinking that be wiped from her being. Perhaps it had to do with her excitement\nof being back in Westeros. But Aries had thought it was just her nerves of\nseeing Gendry again. Arya would never admit to it, Aries knew this, but it was\never present that she was nervous. She didn\u2019t know what to expect. He could\nhave gotten married, for all she knew, but she wouldn\u2019t be the Arya that she is\nif she didn\u2019t at least try to see for herself. </p><p>Sienna had voiced Arya\u2019s concerns the morning they docked. </p><p>\u201cHe could have moved on, you are aware of that?\u201d She questioned. </p><p>Arya gave a hesitant nod, \u201cOf course I am aware. I just feel like\nhe should know Bella exists. If he wants nothing to do with us, then so be it.\nI\u2019ll board my ship once more and sail for Bravos and raise my daughter myself.\u201d\n</p><p>Arya had maintained a tough exterior, but Sienna knew deep down\nthat she was screaming on the inside. </p><p>Sienna shook her head and continued to fold garments into a small\ntrunk. They weren\u2019t taking many things, just a few to last them the days on the\nroad. Arya had wanted to pack lightly, hoping it would help them make the\njourney faster. </p><p>\u201cHave you thought of what you would say to him?\u201d Sienna asked as\nshe placed the last piece of clothing in the trunk. </p><p>Arya sighed, \u201cHonestly?\nNo I haven\u2019t. How do I explain to him that I had a babe and it\u2019s his?\u201d </p><p>Sienna gave a curt laugh, \u201cYou say exactly that. Will his feeling\nbe crushed? Of course, but you have to make him see why you did what you did.\nIf he doesn\u2019t accept that, it is his loss.\u201d </p><p>Arya couldn\u2019t help but smile at the woman. She truly had become\nlike a mother to her and couldn\u2019t bear to part ways with her. Her and Alyse\nwere good company and would make a welcome addition to Storm\u2019s End, if Gendry\nwould have them. Even Aries and Donovan could help around the keep. Arya was\nsure that Storm\u2019s End could use more sailors like Aries and Donovan was a\nparticularly good cook. He could make the best stew, although is bread needed\nwork. </p><p>Arya knew midday had arrived when the sun was at its highest. She\ngathered her small traveling party and departed on the road leading to Strom\u2019s\nEnd. They each were able to acquire a horse, thanks to Alysa\u2019s clever flirting,\nmaking the trip a little less uncomfortable. Aries had agreed to carry the\ntrunk of all their clothing and the women rotated carrying Bella. Although she\nwas small babe, carrying an extra 14 pounds put stress on ones back and Arya\nwas truly grateful for the help. \u00a0</p><p>They road all day until they upon a small inn halfway through\ntheir ride. With Bella getting irritable and Aries\u2019 back aching from the added\nweight, they all decided to rest for the night before continuing on. </p><p>Arya had made quick work on settling down the babe and putting\nher to rest. She had surprised herself at how much better she was getting at\nbeing a mother. All she had were the old memories of her mother caring for\nRickon and tried her best to imitate the past. Of course she had Sienna, but\neven Arya knew that no two mothers were going to be the same when it came to\ncaring for their child. Each would learn their own ways and that was what Arya\nwas doing. </p><p>Arya wasn\u2019t going to be a conventional mother, she vowed to raise\nher daughter the way she would raise a son; without boundaries or limitations.\nShe wanted Bella to grow up running in fields and wielding swords. She wanted\nher to shoot arrows and run a castle, all while still being a fierce lady she\nknew she would grow to be. Arya never wants to force her child into becoming\nsomething that they are not; traditions be damned. </p><p>Arya looked down at the sleeping babe. Her hair had gotten\nslightly longer and it reminded Arya so much of Gendry. She was the spitting\nimage of him, even down to her tiny hands. She could only imagine what the babe\nwould look like when she grew older. <i>Certainly like a Baratheon, she\u2019d\nprobably have the fury of one too, </i>Arya thought. </p><p>A soft knock broke Arya\u2019s gaze from her sleeping child. She made\nher way to the door and opened it reveling Aries with a bowl of what seemed to\nbe soup, if they could call it that. </p><p>\u201cI brought some soup for you, figured you\u2019d be hungry from the\nlong ride.\u201d He said as he handed her the bowl. </p><p>She took it from him and looked at the contents. Her stomach went\nqueasy and she decided to pass on the substance. No amount of hunger would\ncompel her to eat that concoction. The smell alone could clear a forest of any\ncreature. Arya has eaten plenty of grotesque things in her life, but that soup\nwould be by far be the worst thing she would ever stick in her mouth. </p><p>Aries took note of Arya\u2019s face and laughed, \u201cPerhaps you should\ntell that blacksmith of yours to hire better cooks for the inn.\u201d </p><p>Arya cocked an eyebrow, \u201cSomeone like Donovan?\u201d </p><p>Aries blushed. Since their time on <i>Nymeria, </i>the two had\ngotten close; closer than any man that Aries had the pleasure of knowing. He\nwas beginning to fall in love with him and it gave him an exciting feeling. </p><p>\u201cMayhap.\u201d He said slyly. </p><p>Arya smiled and gave him a hug. He was truly shocked by the\ngesture but returned the embrace. When he met the stubborn she wolf, she had\nbeen distant and hard, but now, as new mother, she had opened up and let him\nsee a side of her that he believed she rarely showed anyone. </p><p>She was smiling more and her laugh would now bellow out for all\nto hear. That cold exterior had melted and he believed it had to do with the\nbabe that softly snoring on the bed beside them. </p><p>\u201cTry to get some rest. We have a long day tomorrow, she wolf. Oh,\nDonovan wanted me to tell you he will carry Bella for most of the way.\u201d Aries\nsmiled. </p><p>Arya gave a nod, \u201cI will get rest. Now go, enjoy your lover.\u201d </p><p>She shooed him away and locked the door behind him. She disrobed\nand climbed into bed, nuzzling next to her babe. </p><p>When dawn broke, the traveling party were the first to rise. They\nhad made good time the day prior and Arya wanted to get to Storm\u2019s End before\nmidday. The anticipation was eating her up inside and she didn\u2019t know if she\ncould take much for any longer. </p><p>They paid their dues to the innkeeper and headed out on the road\nahead. Donovan stayed true to his word and carried Bella nearly the whole way.\nIt wasn\u2019t until she began to get fussy, that Arya took her. </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s probably hungry.\u201d Arya said as Donovan handed her the\nbabe. </p><p>She quickly undid her laces and pulled her cotton shirt aside for\nthe babe to have easy access to her breast. Bella latched on almost immediately\nand began to suckle the milk Arya had produced. It amazed Arya at how much the\nbabe could eat. She was of average size, according to Sienna, but the child\ncould eat that of two babes. </p><p>\u201cWell she\u2019s a greedy one.\u201d Observed Donovan. </p><p>\u201cAye, she is.\u201d Arya agreed. </p><p>They rested while Arya fed Bella, each gaining their composure\nbefore they finished the trek ahead. </p><p>Arya had estimated that they had a few hours of riding left and\nonce she finished burping the babe, they were on their way. Arya had held on to\nBella for the rest of their journey. She wanted to keep her close and obscured\nfrom any prying eyes. She didn\u2019t need unfamiliar people asking unwanted questions.\n</p><p>She was sure that people wouldn\u2019t be able to recognize to her;\nshe had never been in the Stormlands and she doubted the people ventured to\nKing\u2019s Landing in the time she had been there, considering it was and still is\nbeing rebuilt. </p><p>As they made their way through the small town nestled right\noutside Storm\u2019s End, Arya couldn\u2019t help but feel the staring eyes. She hadn\u2019t\nthought the five of them would stir any talk, but perhaps she was mistaken. </p><p>\u201cIs that it? The castle is huge!\u201d Alyse exclaimed. She\u2019d only\never seen the Red Keep and didn\u2019t think that there were castles just as big in\nother parts of Westeros. She had heard the stories as a child, but never\nthought she would lay eyes on such castles. </p><p>\u201cI guess you blacksmith isn\u2019t doing too badly for himself.\u201d Aries\nmused. </p><p>But all the awes that her companions had mustered were nothing\ncompared to the joy she felt within her heart. She had finally made it and she\ncouldn\u2019t me more nervous. She was excited, but her nerves were beginning to\ntake over. She thought about all her insecurities and her lack of affection she\nhad shown to him the last time she saw him. What if she was too late and he had\nalready married, or worse, what if he didn\u2019t want her? </p><p>Her heart began to race and she began feeling much like she when\nshe was about to give birth to Bella. The panic was swelling and at that very\nmoment she wanted to take her horses\u2019 reins and steer them in the opposite\ndirection. </p><p>Sienna could see the panic set in Arya\u2019s eyes and she immediately\npulled her horse to stand beside the girl. </p><p>\u201cDo not panic. Everything will turn out like it is supposed to\nbe. If you wish to turn around, we will, and if you wish to move forward, all\nof us will follow. But this is your choice and only you can make it.\u201d Sienna\ntold her. </p><p>Arya gulped, trying to calm her panic. This was the choice Bran\nhad talked about, Arya knew it in her gut. She looked down at the babe cradled\nat her chest; her peaceful face filled with slumber. It only took that one look\nand she knew what she had to do. </p><p>She nudged her horse to move forward and they made their way to\nthe castle gates. </p><p>Four guards were manning the entrance, each with armor adorning\nthe Baratheon sigil. They had swords ate their hips and war hammers in their\nhands. It seemed they were ready for any threat that would make themselves\nknown. </p><p>\u201cSpeak your business!\u201d One guard bellowed. </p><p>\u201cI wish to speak to the lord! We have traveled far and seek\nrefreshment.\u201d Arya yelled back. </p><p>The guards spoke among themselves before gesturing for the five\nto make their way through the castle gates. Arya thanked them and followed one\nguard to the courtyard. </p><p>\u201cWait here, the squire went to fetch the lord.\u201d The guard said.\nArya nodded and followed his instructions. </p><p>It hadn\u2019t been more than a few minutes when woman about Aries\u2019\nage emerged from the castle. Her hair was a thick black mane and her eyes were\nthat all too familiar Baratheon blue. She was dressed in a light corseted vest\nand trousers. Her boots came up to her knees and she had a small sword strapped\nto her waist. She stood tall and with an attitude that Arya knew all too well. </p><p>Arya gently jumped off her horse, being mindful of Bella strapped\nto her chest, and approached the woman. </p><p>\u201cMay I help you with something?\u201d The woman spoke. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking to speak with Lord Gendry Baratheon, is he here?\u201d\nArya asked. </p><p>The woman pressed her lips into a thin line. She was studying\nArya from head to toe. She was dressed much like the woman in front of her,\nwith her own weapons fashioned at her waist. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not here, but you have me instead, Lady Mya Baratheon.\u201d She\nsaid calmly. </p><p>Arya\u2019s heart began to shatter. The woman standing in front of her\nwas Gendry\u2019s wife and here she was walking in her home to tell her husband of\nhis bastard child. Arya began to feel sick. She wasn\u2019t sure how to respond. At\nthat moment, she wanted to climb back onto her horse and run away from all her\nproblems. </p><p>\u201cI-I am sorry. I should not have come.\u201d Arya\u2019s voice was no more\nthan a whisper. She began to climb back on her horse when the women grabbed her\narm, stopping her from doing so. </p><p>\u201cWait! Who did you say you were?\u201d She asked. </p><p>Arya meet her blue eyes, \u201cMy name is Arya Stark of Winterfell, my\nlady.\u201d </p><p>\u201cArya Stark? <i>The </i>Arya Stark? My Gods, I have heard so many\nthings about you from Gendry!\u201d Arya could see the excitement in the woman\u2019s\neyes and it filled her with utter confusion. </p><p>\u201cHe told you about me? Why would he do that?\u201d Arya asked her. </p><p>Mya scoffed, as if the answer was obvious, \u201cBecause he is madly\nin love you, that\u2019s why!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd\u2026You\u2019re okay with that?\u201d Confusion laced Arya\u2019s voice. </p><p>\u201cOf course, why wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d Mya asked her. </p><p>\u201cWell because you are his wife. You should want me dead, not\npraise his love for me.\u201d </p><p>Mya burst into laughter. It was the kind of laughter that made\nyour belly hurt and your eyes water. Arya looked at her in shock, she couldn\u2019t\nbelieve what she was seeing. </p><p>\u201cWhy are you laughing?\u201d </p><p>\u201cGendry is not my husband! He\u2019s my brother! It\u2019s a long story,\nbut we\u2019re siblings.\u201d Mya assured her. </p><p>Arya let out a breath she didn\u2019t know she was holding. There was\na weight lifted off of her and she felt like she could finally relax. </p><p>\u201cSo, he\u2019s not married?\u201d Arya needed that confirmation. </p><p>\u201cNo! My brother is not married.\u201d Mya assured her. </p><p>Arya\u2019s face broke out into a smile. She felt a happiness swell\ninside her that she hadn\u2019t felt since Bella was born. She looked down at the\nbabe once more and saw that she was now wide awake. </p><p>Mya followed her gaze and peeked into the cradled wrap holding\nthe babe in place. What she saw took her breath away. Inside was a small babe\nwho looked exactly like her brother; exactly like her. Everything was beginning\nto make sense and she looked up at Arya, never needing to ask the question. Her\neyes had said it all. The babe was no doubt, her brothers. </p><p>\u201cHarold, make up two rooms for our other guest. Make sure they\nare fed and well rested.\u201d Mya said to the squire. The young squire quickly\nnodded his head and ran back inside the castle. </p><p>Mya turned towards the remaining party, \u201cIf you could follow my\nguard, he will take you to the stables to rest your horses. I will have Harold\ncome fetch you to show you to your rooms.\u201d</p><p>Arya gave a nod to Aries to follow, \u201cI will meet up with you lot\nshortly.\u201d </p><p>Aries smiled and galloped behind the rest of the traveling crew. </p><p>Arya turned to Mya and began following the tall woman inside the\ncastle, making sure to keep Bella concealed. Mya lead Arya up a winding stair\ncase, reaching up to the top of the tower that could be seen from Griffin\u2019s\nRoost. </p><p>They reached a large door and Mya had easily pushed it open.\nInside was a large solar with an oak table in the middle. There were six chairs\nseated around the table and a tray of food resting on top of it. Arya had noticed\nthat it had not been touched, that is until Mya took a chunk of bread and\nstuffed it in her mouth. She hummed with delight and began to pour two goblets\nof wine. </p><p>\u201cPlease, have seat. You must be hungry as well.\u201d Mya pushed the\ntray of food to Arya\u2019s direction. She immediately went straight for the grapes\non the tray and shoved them in her mouth. She had been ravenous, her appetite\nfinally coming back to her. \u00a0</p><p>Mya let Arya indulge in the food before she began to question the\nyoung girl. She may have heard the stories from Gendry, but she didn\u2019t fully\ntrust the wolf yet. </p><p>\u201cSo the babe is his then?\u201d Mya casually took a sip of her wine.\nShe studied Arya\u2019s reaction and noticed a cold exterior that would be difficult\nto crack. </p><p>Arya gave a slight nod; a blush rushing to her cheeks. Aside from\nthe people she trusted, she hadn\u2019t explicitly stated out loud that Bella was\nGendry\u2019s. She didn\u2019t want the wrong ears to hear and get word to Gendry. She\nknew Westeros, and word tended to travel fast throughout the seven kingdoms.\nShe wanted to be able to tell him that they had created a child together, and\nnot some stranger he didn\u2019t know. </p><p>\u201cAye, I see it. I mean she looks exactly like us.\u201d Mya quipped. </p><p>Arya was beginning to get irritated with the woman. She had come\nto Storm\u2019s End to see Gendry, not his half-sister that he didn\u2019t know existed. </p><p>\u201cWhere is Gendry?\u201d Arya asked, her tone harsh. </p><p>Mya lifted an eyebrow, \u201cHe is out. He should be back sometime\nafter dinner. You can wait for him here. It is his chambers after all.\u201d </p><p>Arya\u2019s eyes narrowed. She knew that this Mya had ulterior motives\nand she wanted to know exactly what those motives were. </p><p>\u201cMya, is it? I can\u2019t help but feel like you want to ask me a\nquestion. Please, don\u2019t be afraid, I don\u2019t bite\u2026much.\u201d A sly smile formed on\nArya\u2019s lips. She wanted to stir the woman in any way possible, even if it meant\nplay a game she hadn\u2019t played in a while. </p><p>Mya sighed. She had heard plenty of stories about the great Night\nKing slayer and not just from her brother. Word had traveled far and fast about\nthe young wolf and all about her journeys. Of course, one could not know if\nwhat was being said was truth, but Mya believed that perhaps it was. If she did\nin fact train with the faceless men than she had to tread careful, as to not\nstir direwolf inside of her. </p><p>\u201cVery well. I will play your game, Arya Stark of Winterfell. Why\nare you here? The last my brother saw of you, you were on a ship sailing away.\nI understand that you have his babe in your arms, but she was not the only\nreason you came back. I want to know why.\u201d Mya said in a low voice. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t owe anyone an explanation but Gendry. Once he returns, I\nwill tell him.\u201d Arya\u2019s eyes were like daggers. If looks could kill, Mya would surely\nbe dead. </p><p>Mya stayed focus on Arya, which is until a bang came through the\ndoor. </p><p>\u201cGood, then tell him.\u201d Mya\u2019s eyes flicked to the door. </p><p>Arya could feel a presence behind her. Every inch in her body\nwanted to turn to see him, but she couldn\u2019t. </p><p>\u201cTell me what?\u201d When he spoke, is was like the ice that froze her\nbody had suddenly melted and the only thing she needed was to look at him. </p><p>She turned in her chair and was faced with those oh-so familiar\ndeep blue eyes. </p>",
                "content": "<p>\n\nHahaha, remember when I said that this was going to be 3 parts&hellip;well I guess I lied and I totally made it longer than I anticipated. Don&rsquo;t worry, I am still writing An Unexpected Journey, but I needed a little break from it. I ended up getting writers block on it and I just need some time to get out of that funk&hellip;so that is why I decided to write this one. I only plan on making two more parts to this one but&hellip;.I don&rsquo;t really know, it make be longer. Anyway, as an early bday gift to myself (It&rsquo;s tomorrow) I decided to give you all the next part. I hope you enjoy!!\n\n<br /></p><p>The <i>Nymeria </i>docked in Griffin&rsquo;s Roost in the early morn.\nThe sun had yet to rise above the horizon and the sea let off a light fog. Arya\nhad wanted to leave to Storm&rsquo;s End as soon as the ship had been tied and the\nanchor dropped, but Aries had convinced her to wait until midday. The crew had\nworked tirelessly to get her here faster than normal and deserved to rest for a\ntime. Most of them had agreed to stay on the ship and explore the local inns\nwhile Aries, Donovan, Sienna, and Alyse had agreed to travel with Arya on the\ntwo day trek to Storm&rsquo;s End. </p><p>She was hesitant at first, just wanting to travel with Bella and\nherself, but again, Aries had suggested that it would be better for them to\ncome along in case she needed help with the babe. </p><p>In her haste to reach Strom&rsquo;s End, it seemed all logically\nthinking that be wiped from her being. Perhaps it had to do with her excitement\nof being back in Westeros. But Aries had thought it was just her nerves of\nseeing Gendry again. Arya would never admit to it, Aries knew this, but it was\never present that she was nervous. She didn&rsquo;t know what to expect. He could\nhave gotten married, for all she knew, but she wouldn&rsquo;t be the Arya that she is\nif she didn&rsquo;t at least try to see for herself. </p><p>Sienna had voiced Arya&rsquo;s concerns the morning they docked. </p><p>&ldquo;He could have moved on, you are aware of that?&rdquo; She questioned. </p><p>Arya gave a hesitant nod, &ldquo;Of course I am aware. I just feel like\nhe should know Bella exists. If he wants nothing to do with us, then so be it.\nI&rsquo;ll board my ship once more and sail for Bravos and raise my daughter myself.&rdquo;\n</p><p>Arya had maintained a tough exterior, but Sienna knew deep down\nthat she was screaming on the inside. </p><p>Sienna shook her head and continued to fold garments into a small\ntrunk. They weren&rsquo;t taking many things, just a few to last them the days on the\nroad. Arya had wanted to pack lightly, hoping it would help them make the\njourney faster. </p><p>&ldquo;Have you thought of what you would say to him?&rdquo; Sienna asked as\nshe placed the last piece of clothing in the trunk. </p><p>Arya sighed, &ldquo;Honestly?\nNo I haven&rsquo;t. How do I explain to him that I had a babe and it&rsquo;s his?&rdquo; </p><p>Sienna gave a curt laugh, &ldquo;You say exactly that. Will his feeling\nbe crushed? Of course, but you have to make him see why you did what you did.\nIf he doesn&rsquo;t accept that, it is his loss.&rdquo; </p><p>Arya couldn&rsquo;t help but smile at the woman. She truly had become\nlike a mother to her and couldn&rsquo;t bear to part ways with her. Her and Alyse\nwere good company and would make a welcome addition to Storm&rsquo;s End, if Gendry\nwould have them. Even Aries and Donovan could help around the keep. Arya was\nsure that Storm&rsquo;s End could use more sailors like Aries and Donovan was a\nparticularly good cook. He could make the best stew, although is bread needed\nwork. </p><p>Arya knew midday had arrived when the sun was at its highest. She\ngathered her small traveling party and departed on the road leading to Strom&rsquo;s\nEnd. They each were able to acquire a horse, thanks to Alysa&rsquo;s clever flirting,\nmaking the trip a little less uncomfortable. Aries had agreed to carry the\ntrunk of all their clothing and the women rotated carrying Bella. Although she\nwas small babe, carrying an extra 14 pounds put stress on ones back and Arya\nwas truly grateful for the help. &nbsp;</p><p>They road all day until they upon a small inn halfway through\ntheir ride. With Bella getting irritable and Aries&rsquo; back aching from the added\nweight, they all decided to rest for the night before continuing on. </p><p>Arya had made quick work on settling down the babe and putting\nher to rest. She had surprised herself at how much better she was getting at\nbeing a mother. All she had were the old memories of her mother caring for\nRickon and tried her best to imitate the past. Of course she had Sienna, but\neven Arya knew that no two mothers were going to be the same when it came to\ncaring for their child. Each would learn their own ways and that was what Arya\nwas doing. </p><p>Arya wasn&rsquo;t going to be a conventional mother, she vowed to raise\nher daughter the way she would raise a son; without boundaries or limitations.\nShe wanted Bella to grow up running in fields and wielding swords. She wanted\nher to shoot arrows and run a castle, all while still being a fierce lady she\nknew she would grow to be. Arya never wants to force her child into becoming\nsomething that they are not; traditions be damned. </p><p>Arya looked down at the sleeping babe. Her hair had gotten\nslightly longer and it reminded Arya so much of Gendry. She was the spitting\nimage of him, even down to her tiny hands. She could only imagine what the babe\nwould look like when she grew older. <i>Certainly like a Baratheon, she&rsquo;d\nprobably have the fury of one too, </i>Arya thought. </p><p>A soft knock broke Arya&rsquo;s gaze from her sleeping child. She made\nher way to the door and opened it reveling Aries with a bowl of what seemed to\nbe soup, if they could call it that. </p><p>&ldquo;I brought some soup for you, figured you&rsquo;d be hungry from the\nlong ride.&rdquo; He said as he handed her the bowl. </p><p>She took it from him and looked at the contents. Her stomach went\nqueasy and she decided to pass on the substance. No amount of hunger would\ncompel her to eat that concoction. The smell alone could clear a forest of any\ncreature. Arya has eaten plenty of grotesque things in her life, but that soup\nwould be by far be the worst thing she would ever stick in her mouth. </p><p>Aries took note of Arya&rsquo;s face and laughed, &ldquo;Perhaps you should\ntell that blacksmith of yours to hire better cooks for the inn.&rdquo; </p><p>Arya cocked an eyebrow, &ldquo;Someone like Donovan?&rdquo; </p><p>Aries blushed. Since their time on <i>Nymeria, </i>the two had\ngotten close; closer than any man that Aries had the pleasure of knowing. He\nwas beginning to fall in love with him and it gave him an exciting feeling. </p><p>&ldquo;Mayhap.&rdquo; He said slyly. </p><p>Arya smiled and gave him a hug. He was truly shocked by the\ngesture but returned the embrace. When he met the stubborn she wolf, she had\nbeen distant and hard, but now, as new mother, she had opened up and let him\nsee a side of her that he believed she rarely showed anyone. </p><p>She was smiling more and her laugh would now bellow out for all\nto hear. That cold exterior had melted and he believed it had to do with the\nbabe that softly snoring on the bed beside them. </p><p>&ldquo;Try to get some rest. We have a long day tomorrow, she wolf. Oh,\nDonovan wanted me to tell you he will carry Bella for most of the way.&rdquo; Aries\nsmiled. </p><p>Arya gave a nod, &ldquo;I will get rest. Now go, enjoy your lover.&rdquo; </p><p>She shooed him away and locked the door behind him. She disrobed\nand climbed into bed, nuzzling next to her babe. </p><p>When dawn broke, the traveling party were the first to rise. They\nhad made good time the day prior and Arya wanted to get to Storm&rsquo;s End before\nmidday. The anticipation was eating her up inside and she didn&rsquo;t know if she\ncould take much for any longer. </p><p>They paid their dues to the innkeeper and headed out on the road\nahead. Donovan stayed true to his word and carried Bella nearly the whole way.\nIt wasn&rsquo;t until she began to get fussy, that Arya took her. </p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s probably hungry.&rdquo; Arya said as Donovan handed her the\nbabe. </p><p>She quickly undid her laces and pulled her cotton shirt aside for\nthe babe to have easy access to her breast. Bella latched on almost immediately\nand began to suckle the milk Arya had produced. It amazed Arya at how much the\nbabe could eat. She was of average size, according to Sienna, but the child\ncould eat that of two babes. </p><p>&ldquo;Well she&rsquo;s a greedy one.&rdquo; Observed Donovan. </p><p>&ldquo;Aye, she is.&rdquo; Arya agreed. </p><p>They rested while Arya fed Bella, each gaining their composure\nbefore they finished the trek ahead. </p><p>Arya had estimated that they had a few hours of riding left and\nonce she finished burping the babe, they were on their way. Arya had held on to\nBella for the rest of their journey. She wanted to keep her close and obscured\nfrom any prying eyes. She didn&rsquo;t need unfamiliar people asking unwanted questions.\n</p><p>She was sure that people wouldn&rsquo;t be able to recognize to her;\nshe had never been in the Stormlands and she doubted the people ventured to\nKing&rsquo;s Landing in the time she had been there, considering it was and still is\nbeing rebuilt. </p><p>As they made their way through the small town nestled right\noutside Storm&rsquo;s End, Arya couldn&rsquo;t help but feel the staring eyes. She hadn&rsquo;t\nthought the five of them would stir any talk, but perhaps she was mistaken. </p><p>&ldquo;Is that it? The castle is huge!&rdquo; Alyse exclaimed. She&rsquo;d only\never seen the Red Keep and didn&rsquo;t think that there were castles just as big in\nother parts of Westeros. She had heard the stories as a child, but never\nthought she would lay eyes on such castles. </p><p>&ldquo;I guess you blacksmith isn&rsquo;t doing too badly for himself.&rdquo; Aries\nmused. </p><p>But all the awes that her companions had mustered were nothing\ncompared to the joy she felt within her heart. She had finally made it and she\ncouldn&rsquo;t me more nervous. She was excited, but her nerves were beginning to\ntake over. She thought about all her insecurities and her lack of affection she\nhad shown to him the last time she saw him. What if she was too late and he had\nalready married, or worse, what if he didn&rsquo;t want her? </p><p>Her heart began to race and she began feeling much like she when\nshe was about to give birth to Bella. The panic was swelling and at that very\nmoment she wanted to take her horses&rsquo; reins and steer them in the opposite\ndirection. </p><p>Sienna could see the panic set in Arya&rsquo;s eyes and she immediately\npulled her horse to stand beside the girl. </p><p>&ldquo;Do not panic. Everything will turn out like it is supposed to\nbe. If you wish to turn around, we will, and if you wish to move forward, all\nof us will follow. But this is your choice and only you can make it.&rdquo; Sienna\ntold her. </p><p>Arya gulped, trying to calm her panic. This was the choice Bran\nhad talked about, Arya knew it in her gut. She looked down at the babe cradled\nat her chest; her peaceful face filled with slumber. It only took that one look\nand she knew what she had to do. </p><p>She nudged her horse to move forward and they made their way to\nthe castle gates. </p><p>Four guards were manning the entrance, each with armor adorning\nthe Baratheon sigil. They had swords ate their hips and war hammers in their\nhands. It seemed they were ready for any threat that would make themselves\nknown. </p><p>&ldquo;Speak your business!&rdquo; One guard bellowed. </p><p>&ldquo;I wish to speak to the lord! We have traveled far and seek\nrefreshment.&rdquo; Arya yelled back. </p><p>The guards spoke among themselves before gesturing for the five\nto make their way through the castle gates. Arya thanked them and followed one\nguard to the courtyard. </p><p>&ldquo;Wait here, the squire went to fetch the lord.&rdquo; The guard said.\nArya nodded and followed his instructions. </p><p>It hadn&rsquo;t been more than a few minutes when woman about Aries&rsquo;\nage emerged from the castle. Her hair was a thick black mane and her eyes were\nthat all too familiar Baratheon blue. She was dressed in a light corseted vest\nand trousers. Her boots came up to her knees and she had a small sword strapped\nto her waist. She stood tall and with an attitude that Arya knew all too well. </p><p>Arya gently jumped off her horse, being mindful of Bella strapped\nto her chest, and approached the woman. </p><p>&ldquo;May I help you with something?&rdquo; The woman spoke. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking to speak with Lord Gendry Baratheon, is he here?&rdquo;\nArya asked. </p><p>The woman pressed her lips into a thin line. She was studying\nArya from head to toe. She was dressed much like the woman in front of her,\nwith her own weapons fashioned at her waist. </p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not here, but you have me instead, Lady Mya Baratheon.&rdquo; She\nsaid calmly. </p><p>Arya&rsquo;s heart began to shatter. The woman standing in front of her\nwas Gendry&rsquo;s wife and here she was walking in her home to tell her husband of\nhis bastard child. Arya began to feel sick. She wasn&rsquo;t sure how to respond. At\nthat moment, she wanted to climb back onto her horse and run away from all her\nproblems. </p><p>&ldquo;I-I am sorry.

She may have heard the stories from Gendry, but she didn&rsquo;t fully\ntrust the wolf yet. </p><p>&ldquo;So the babe is his then?&rdquo; Mya casually took a sip of her wine.\nShe studied Arya&rsquo;s reaction and noticed a cold exterior that would be difficult\nto crack. </p><p>Arya gave a slight nod; a blush rushing to her cheeks. Aside from\nthe people she trusted, she hadn&rsquo;t explicitly stated out loud that Bella was\nGendry&rsquo;s. She didn&rsquo;t want the wrong ears to hear and get word to Gendry. She\nknew Westeros, and word tended to travel fast throughout the seven kingdoms.\nShe wanted to be able to tell him that they had created a child together, and\nnot some stranger he didn&rsquo;t know. </p><p>&ldquo;Aye, I see it. I mean she looks exactly like us.&rdquo; Mya quipped. </p><p>Arya was beginning to get irritated with the woman. She had come\nto Storm&rsquo;s End to see Gendry, not his half-sister that he didn&rsquo;t know existed. </p><p>&ldquo;Where is Gendry?&rdquo; Arya asked, her tone harsh. </p><p>Mya lifted an eyebrow, &ldquo;He is out. He should be back sometime\nafter dinner. You can wait for him here. It is his chambers after all.&rdquo; </p><p>Arya&rsquo;s eyes narrowed. She knew that this Mya had ulterior motives\nand she wanted to know exactly what those motives were. </p><p>&ldquo;Mya, is it? I can&rsquo;t help but feel like you want to ask me a\nquestion. Please, don&rsquo;t be afraid, I don&rsquo;t bite&hellip;much.&rdquo; A sly smile formed on\nArya&rsquo;s lips. She wanted to stir the woman in any way possible, even if it meant\nplay a game she hadn&rsquo;t played in a while. </p><p>Mya sighed. She had heard plenty of stories about the great Night\nKing slayer and not just from her brother. Word had traveled far and fast about\nthe young wolf and all about her journeys. Of course, one could not know if\nwhat was being said was truth, but Mya believed that perhaps it was. If she did\nin fact train with the faceless men than she had to tread careful, as to not\nstir direwolf inside of her. </p><p>&ldquo;Very well. I will play your game, Arya Stark of Winterfell. Why\nare you here? The last my brother saw of you, you were on a ship sailing away.\nI understand that you have his babe in your arms, but she was not the only\nreason you came back. I want to know why.&rdquo; Mya said in a low voice. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t owe anyone an explanation but Gendry. Once he returns, I\nwill tell him.&rdquo; Arya&rsquo;s eyes were like daggers. If looks could kill, Mya would surely\nbe dead. </p><p>Mya stayed focus on Arya, which is until a bang came through the\ndoor. </p><p>&ldquo;Good, then tell him.&rdquo; Mya&rsquo;s eyes flicked to the door. </p><p>Arya could feel a presence behind her. Every inch in her body\nwanted to turn to see him, but she couldn&rsquo;t. </p><p>&ldquo;Tell me what?&rdquo; When he spoke, is was like the ice that froze her\nbody had suddenly melted and the only thing she needed was to look at him. </p><p>She turned in her chair and was faced with those oh-so familiar\ndeep blue eyes. </p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n\nHahaha, remember when I said that this was going to be 3 parts&hellip;well I guess I lied and I totally made it longer than I anticipated. Don&rsquo;t worry, I am still writing An Unexpected Journey, but I needed a little break from it. I ended up getting writers block on it and I just need some time to get out of that funk&hellip;so that is why I decided to write this one. I only plan on making two more parts to this one but&hellip;.I don&rsquo;t really know, it make be longer. Anyway, as an early bday gift to myself (It&rsquo;s tomorrow) I decided to give you all the next part. I hope you enjoy!!\n\n<br /></p>",

But despite its simplicity, there\u2019s a lot going on in this chapter. Jon I introduced the first really big conflict in the Stark family (Jon vs Catelyn), and Arya I introduces the second (Sansa vs Arya). It also our first real introduction to Sansa; not just her as a person, but a character in her element and the social sphere she\u2019s most comfortable in. </p><p>Martin has said before that he originally created Sansa as a contrast for Arya and to introduce some conflict into the Stark family, and that\u2019s very much in evidence in these first few chapters, starting with how in the second paragraph of her very first POV chapter Arya is already being contrasted unfavorably with Sansa by Septa Mordane.</p><blockquote><p><i>Arya\u2019s stitches were crooked again.</i></p><p><i>She frowned down at them with dismay and glanced over to where her sister Sansa sat among the other girls. Sansa\u2019s needlework was exquisite. Everyone said so. \u201cSansa\u2019s work is as pretty as she is,\u201d Septa Mordane told their lady mother once. \u201cShe has such fine, delicate hands.\u201d When Lady Catelyn had asked about Arya, the septa had sniffed. \u201cArya has the hands of a blacksmith.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>There\u2019s a perception in fandom that Sansa and Arya fundamentally don\u2019t like each other or that Sansa was condescending to Arya, but something that\u2019s underrated is just how much the two are actively pitted against each other by Septa Mordane. And this is as good a time as any to mention that Septa Mordane fails epically in her role as a mentor and is kind of a dick. It\u2019s one thing for Septa Mordane to not want to encourage Arya\u2019s more rambunctious interests, but it\u2019s entirely another for her to constantly beat Arya down and reinforce her negative self image.</p><p>It\u2019s unfortunate in a lot of ways that Arya\u2019s POV comes before Sansa\u2019s. It\u2019s a known psychological phenomenon that your first impression of someone else really does affect how you see them: there\u2019s a study (wish I still had the link) where two groups were given the same list of actions someone took with the only difference being a negative or positive news story they had the group read about the person before the list of actions. Sure enough, people who read the negative news story rated that person\u2019s actions as more negative, while the people who read the positive news story rated their actions as more positive.</p><p>With Sansa all her negatives as a character are front loaded, and our perception of her is permanently tarnished by Arya\u2019s frustration and issues with her. This has the cascade of making the reader judge Sansa more harshly than they should for everything she does later.</p><!-- more --><blockquote><p><i>She looked glumly at her sister. Sansa was chatting away happily as she worked. Beth Cassel, Ser Rodrik\u2019s little girl, was sitting by her feet, listening to every word she said, and Jeyne Poole was leaning over to whisper something in her ear.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Arya asked suddenly.</i></p><p><i>Jeyne gave her a startled look, then giggled. Sansa looked abashed. Beth blushed. No one answered.</i></p></blockquote><p>Arya is pretty clearly excluded from this group, though considering what they\u2019re talking about it\u2019s not that surprising.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cJoffrey likes your sister,\u201d Jeyne whispered, proud as if she had something to do with it. She was the daughter of Winterfell\u2019s steward and Sansa\u2019s dearest friend. \u201cHe told her she was very beautiful.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHe\u2019s going to marry her,\u201d little Beth said dreamily, hugging herself. \u201cThen Sansa will be queen of all the realm.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Sansa had the grace to blush. She blushed prettily. She did everything prettily, Arya thought with dull resentment. \u201cBeth, you shouldn\u2019t make up stories,\u201d Sansa corrected the younger girl, gently stroking her hair to take the harshness out of her words. She looked at Arya. \u201cWhat did you think of Prince Joff, sister? He\u2019s very gallant, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>We can see here in Sansa holding court a lot her natural leadership qualities that will make her a good lady or queen someday. She\u2019s kind when she corrects Beth, and doesn\u2019t embarrass her. She also tries to include Arya in the conversation now that\u2019s she engaged in it. I think there\u2019s a tendency to read this interaction as Sansa fishing for a compliment, but there\u2019s no actual reason to read negative intent into it. She really does seem to just be trying to include Arya.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cJon says he looks like a girl,\u201d Arya said.</i></p><p><i>Sansa sighed as she stitched. \u201cPoor Jon,\u201d she said. \u201cHe gets jealous because he\u2019s a bastard.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>It\u2019s worth pointing out that Sansa isn\u2019t completely off base here. If Jon\u2019s <a href=\"https://tacitwhisky.tumblr.com/post/185430416635/jon-sansa-reread-jon-i-agot\" target=\"_blank\">first chapter</a> showed anything it\u2019s that he is remarkably bitter about the cards life has dealt him and it\u2019ll be an ongoing aspect in this chapter too. So while it\u2019s dickish of Sansa to dismiss Jon\u2019s opinion because of his birth, she\u2019s not actually wrong on the substance of it.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cHe\u2019s our brother,\u201d Arya said, much too loudly. Her voice cut through the afternoon quiet of the tower room.</i></p><p><i>\u201cOur half brother,\u201d Sansa corrected, soft and precise.</i></p></blockquote><p>It\u2019s the same thing here with her calling Jon their half brother. Sansa is the Stark most aware of formalities, and there is a formal distance between Jon and the other starklings that even he observes (for example back in Bran I where he called Robb \u201cStark\u201d). There\u2019s a legitimate argument to be made that\u2019s Sansa\u2019s simply being precise here and not trying to distance him from them.</p><p>That\u2019s not how Arya perceives it though; for her to be bastard is to be other (we\u2019ll see this again in a minute), so when Sansa says, \u201cHe gets jealous because he\u2019s a bastard\u201d Arya immediately interprets that as Sansa othering and distancing Jon. Thus why her answer is that Jon is their brother despite Sansa not actually saying he wasn\u2019t related to them. Bastard is other, and Arya is closer to Jon than anyone.</p><p>I actually think since we don\u2019t get Sansa POV of this interaction there\u2019s enough ambiguity to support either reading depending on your headcanon: she may simply be being precise and formal, or she may be trying to distance Jon from them. Or maybe a mixture of both.</p><p>Of course, because we\u2019re in Arya\u2019s viewpoint and already preset to think the worst of Sansa, I imagine most readers interpreted it the second way on their first read, which would then make them dislike Sansa: we\u2019ve had two chapters to empathize with Jon, so just by narrative law our first loyalty is to him, and we\u2019re currently in Arya\u2019s viewpoint and thus biased towards her interpretations of events.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cArya, why aren\u2019t you at work?\u201d the septa asked. She rose to her feet, starched skirts rustling as she started across the room. \u201cLet me see your stitches.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Arya wanted to scream. It was just like Sansa to go and attract the septa\u2019s attention. \u201cHere,\u201d she said, surrendering up her work.</i></p><p><i>The septa examined the fabric. \u201cArya, Arya, Arya,\u201d she said. \u201cThis will not do. This will not do at all.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Everyone was looking at her. It was too much. Sansa was too well bred to smile at her sister\u2019s disgrace, but Jeyne was smirking on her behalf. Even Princess Myrcella looked sorry for her. Arya felt tears filling her eyes. She pushed herself out of her chair and bolted for the door.</i></p></blockquote><p>This is one of the pettier and crueler things Septa Mordane does. Instead of minimizing Arya\u2019s embarrassment, she amplifies it so she can preen and cast herself as long suffering. She truly is the worst.</p><p>There\u2019s also an interesting thing going on here where Arya\u2019s attributing things to Sansa that aren\u2019t actually happening. First she blames Sansa for attracting Mordane\u2019s attention, then thinks thinks Sansa is internally pleased at her embarrassment but just isn\u2019t showing it. In both instances there\u2019s no actual proof this is what&rsquo;s happening, but again we run into that cascade of negativity in how the reader sees Sansa. It also dovetails perfectly with the negative trope of the snooty feminine older sister that Sansa already falls into.</p><blockquote><p><i>It wasn\u2019t fair. Sansa had everything. Sansa was two years older; maybe by the time Arya had been born, there had been nothing left. Often it felt that way. Sansa could sew and dance and sing. She wrote poetry. She knew how to dress. She played the high harp and the bells. Worse, she was beautiful. Sansa had gotten their mother\u2019s fine high cheekbones and the thick auburn hair of the Tullys. Arya took after their lord father. Her hair was a lusterless brown, and her face was long and solemn. Jeyne used to call her Arya Horseface, and neigh whenever she came near.</i></p></blockquote><p>Again we see a zero sum dynamic between Sansa and Arya: there\u2019s only enough femininity for one of them, and Sansa already used it all up (again attributing something to Sansa that she actually has no control over).</p><p>It\u2019s also interesting to note that I think a lot of people actually conflate Sansa and Jeyne when it comes to their treatment of Arya: even I internally thought that both of them called Arya horseface, when the paragraph very clearly states it was just Jeyne. And while Sansa doesn\u2019t seem to have shut Jeyne down (though I can\u2019t remember if she ever knew Jeyne was doing that), it is worth noting that Sansa doesn\u2019t bully Arya, and outside of arguments doesn\u2019t seem to antagonize her.</p><p>This matters because Sansa and Jeyne despite being lumped together in Arya\u2019s head, actually occupy very different positions within Winterfell. I wish I had bookmarked it, but I just read a meta the other day about how galling Arya\u2019s existence must\u2019ve been for Jeyne; no matter how much closer she is to Sansa or better at feminine pursuits, Jeyne because of her birth will always be lower than Arya, never Sansa\u2019s true sister. Which is kind of fascinating when you remember that Jeyne will later be forced to be Arya when she\u2019s married to Ramsay. She gets what she wants, but very much not how she wanted it.</p><p>(this also makes me want to read a Jon x Jeyne AU. No? Just me? Fine)</p><blockquote><p><i>It hurt that the one thing Arya could do better than her sister was ride a horse. Well, that and manage a household. Sansa had never had much of a head for figures. If she did marry Prince Joff, Arya hoped for his sake that he had a good steward.</i></p></blockquote><p>Being canonically bad at horse riding and math are strangely enough two things people tend to forget about Sansa. Partly I\u2019m sure it\u2019s that this isn\u2019t in the show, and partly it just doesn\u2019t really jive with the rest of Sansa\u2019s character. Being able to manage a household is part of the westerosi feminine ideal, and so it doesn\u2019t really make sense that she\u2019d be bad at it, especially considering how well she is at logistics and managing a household later on in the Eyrie. Chalking this one up to early installment weirdness seems fair.</p><blockquote><p><i>By now Septa Mordane would certainly have sent word to her lady mother. If she went to her room, they would find her. Arya did not care to be found. She had a better notion. The boys were at practice in the yard. She wanted to see Robb put gallant Prince Joffrey flat on his back. \u201cCome,\u201d she whispered to Nymeria. She got up and ran, the wolf coming hard at her heels.</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>They [Arya and Nymeria] arrived, flushed and breathless, to find Jon seated on the sill, one leg drawn up languidly to his chin.</i></p></blockquote><p>This is a very Jon pose; composed, thoughtful, intent. It\u2019s actually low-key one of my favorite descriptions for just how much it tells you about Jon in just a few words. It\u2019s also very in keeping with how Bran described him in his chapter as slender and quick and graceful. Jon in these early chapters and from the viewpoint of Bran and Arya has a very different physicality to him than later when things are solely from his viewpoint. In these early chapters he\u2019s a little more bishie than later; partly because he\u2019s younger, partly because men don\u2019t think there appearance as much in fiction.</p><p>Which all on its own is interesting to contrast with Tyrion who is exceptionally aware of his body at all times, and the female characters who are much more attentive to what they wear and how they look. I tend to think it comes from Martin\u2019s, however subconscious, male gaze, but it also fits westeros: women from a young age are socialized to view themselves as sex objects and to be hyper aware of their attractiveness and appearance. It\u2019s sadly not that different from the real world.</p><blockquote><p><i>Jon gave her a curious look. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be working on your stitches, little sister?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Arya made a face at him. \u201cI wanted to see them fight.\u201d</i></p><p><i>He smiled. \u201cCome here, then.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Arya climbed up on the window and sat beside him, to a chorus of thuds and grunts from the yard below.</i></p><p><i>\u201cA shade more exhausting than needlework,\u201d Jon observed.</i></p><p><i>\u201cA shade more fun than needlework,\u201d Arya gave back at him. Jon grinned, reached over, and messed up her hair. Arya flushed. They had always been close. Jon had their father\u2019s face, as she did. They were the only ones. Robb and Sansa and Bran and even little Rickon all took after the Tullys, with easy smiles and fire in their hair. When Arya had been little, she had been afraid that meant that she was a bastard too. It had been Jon she had gone to in her fear, and Jon who had reassured her.</i></p></blockquote><p>Arya\u2019s fear that her outsider qualities stem from bastardy hints at just how much damage Catelyn\u2019s ostracization of Jon seeps unintentionally into the rest of the starklings. As we saw when Sansa called Jon a bastard, Arya equates bastardy with otherness. It\u2019s no doubt one of the reasons she\u2019s so close to Jon as they both don\u2019t feel like they fit. That and his unquestioning acceptance of her less feminine coded interests.</p><p>And just like when he gave up having his own wolf so Bran and the other starklings could get theirs, we see again just how much Jon loves his siblings. It must\u2019ve stung for Arya to so blatantly unhappy about being like him, but he wasn\u2019t bitter about it. In general with his siblings Jon doesn\u2019t get bitter (outside of some stuff with Robb), only when the rest of the world intrudes.</p><p>(this also marks the first of many, many, many times Arya thinks about Jon mussing her hair. It gets old)</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you down in the yard?\u201d Arya asked him.</i></p><p><i>He gave her a half smile. \u201cBastards are not allowed to damage young princes,\u201d he said. \u201cAny bruises they take in the practice yard must come from trueborn swords.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOh.\u201d Arya felt abashed. She should have realized. For the second time today, Arya reflected that life was not fair.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThe Lannisters are proud,\u201d Jon observed. \u201cYou\u2019d think the royal sigil would be sufficient, but no. He makes his mother\u2019s House equal in honor to the king\u2019s.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThe woman is important too!\u201d Arya protested.</i></p><p><i>Jon chuckled. \u201cPerhaps you should do the same thing, little sister. Wed Tully to Stark in your arms.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cA wolf with a fish in its mouth?\u201d It made her laugh. \u201cThat would look silly. Besides, if a girl can\u2019t fight, why should she have a coat of arms?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Jon shrugged. \u201cGirls get the arms but not the swords. Bastards get the swords but not the arms. I did not make the rules, little sister.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>Like with Tyrion <a href=\"https://tacitwhisky.tumblr.com/post/185430416635/jon-sansa-reread-jon-i-agot\" target=\"_blank\">last chapter</a>, we can see here the seeds of Jon\u2019s later ability to empathize and understand other marginalized groups. Jon\u2019s narrative is a constant examination of his own privilege and then using his bastard status as a way to extend sympathy and understanding. This is something he\u2019s challenged with again and again.<br/></p><p>It\u2019s also reminiscent of <a href=\"https://tacitwhisky.tumblr.com/post/185340901530/jon-sansa-reread-bran-i-agot\" target=\"_blank\">Bran I</a> where he was sympathetic to Bran but also didn\u2019t hesitate to tell him the truth. Jon as a person is fiercely loyal and kind to those he cares about, but doesn\u2019t coddle. Like we talked about last chapter, because of his position Jon is keenly aware that the world is not fair.</p><blockquote><p><i>Jon watched them leave, and Arya watched Jon. His face had grown as still as the pool at the heart of the godswood. Finally he climbed down off the window. \u201cThe show is done,\u201d he said. He bent to scratch Ghost behind the ears. The white wolf rose and rubbed against him. \u201cYou had best run back to your room, little sister. Septa Mordane will surely be lurking. The longer you hide, the sterner the penance. You\u2019ll be sewing all through winter. When the spring thaw comes, they will find your body with a needle still locked tight between your frozen fingers.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Arya didn\u2019t think it was funny. \u201cI hate needlework!\u201d she said with passion. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNothing is fair,\u201d Jon said. He messed up her hair again and walked away from her, Ghost moving silently beside him.</i></p></blockquote><p>I find it endlessly hilarious how extra Jon tends to be in these Winterfell chapters; it\u2019s a good writing tip though. Teenagers in general tend to be extra.</p><p><b>Show Comparison</b></p><p>I\u2019m putting this as its own section this time because both of these scenes are almost entirely missing from the show: in the first episode we see Arya bored at sewing before she runs off to hang with the boys, but there\u2019s no confrontation or dialogue with Sansa. And the second scene with Jon simply doesn\u2019t exist.</p><p>While on the surface these aren\u2019t big cuts, and were most likely simply due to time constraints and attempts to streamline things, they do subtly change the characters and speak to an underlying difference in how D&amp;D see Arya and Sansa: feminine arts become something Arya generally despises because she thinks they\u2019re dumb, not something that she dislikes because she\u2019s bad at them and there\u2019s no place for someone like her in her society.</p><p>We also miss her \u201cthe woman matters too!\u201d exclamation, which is a far cry from her \u201cmost girls are dumb\u201d line later in the show. It\u2019s a subtle shift, but an important one.</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>This wraps up Arya I. Overall it\u2019s a strong chapter, and an interesting introduction to Sansa: not a favorable one because of the POV, but one that\u2019s consistent with her character. We won\u2019t get her perspective on her relationship until both of them are well on their way south, but luckily for us we won\u2019t have to wait that long. Next reread will be Jon II where he has the infamous scene with Catelyn at Bran\u2019s bedside, and then the chapter after that will be Sansa I.</p><p>If you\u2019ve got any questions or comments hit me up on my asks; I love talking with you all.</p><p><b>Previous Chapters:</b></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://tacitwhisky.tumblr.com/post/185340901530/jon-sansa-reread-bran-i-agot\" target=\"_blank\">Bran I</a></li><li><a href=\"https://tacitwhisky.tumblr.com/post/185430416635/jon-sansa-reread-jon-i-agot\" target=\"_blank\">Jon I</a></li></ul><p>Next Chapter (Jon II) &gt;</p>",

Sansa was chatting away happily as she worked. Beth Cassel, Ser Rodrik\u2019s little girl, was sitting by her feet, listening to every word she said, and Jeyne Poole was leaning over to whisper something in her ear.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Arya asked suddenly.</i></p><p><i>Jeyne gave her a startled look, then giggled. Sansa looked abashed. Beth blushed. No one answered.</i></p></blockquote><p>Arya is pretty clearly excluded from this group, though considering what they\u2019re talking about it\u2019s not that surprising.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cJoffrey likes your sister,\u201d Jeyne whispered, proud as if she had something to do with it. She was the daughter of Winterfell\u2019s steward and Sansa\u2019s dearest friend. \u201cHe told her she was very beautiful.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHe\u2019s going to marry her,\u201d little Beth said dreamily, hugging herself. \u201cThen Sansa will be queen of all the realm.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Sansa had the grace to blush. She blushed prettily. She did everything prettily, Arya thought with dull resentment. \u201cBeth, you shouldn\u2019t make up stories,\u201d Sansa corrected the younger girl, gently stroking her hair to take the harshness out of her words. She looked at Arya. \u201cWhat did you think of Prince Joff, sister? He\u2019s very gallant, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>We can see here in Sansa holding court a lot her natural leadership qualities that will make her a good lady or queen someday. She\u2019s kind when she corrects Beth, and doesn\u2019t embarrass her. She also tries to include Arya in the conversation now that\u2019s she engaged in it. I think there\u2019s a tendency to read this interaction as Sansa fishing for a compliment, but there\u2019s no actual reason to read negative intent into it. She really does seem to just be trying to include Arya.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cJon says he looks like a girl,\u201d Arya said.</i></p><p><i>Sansa sighed as she stitched. \u201cPoor Jon,\u201d she said. \u201cHe gets jealous because he\u2019s a bastard.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>It\u2019s worth pointing out that Sansa isn\u2019t completely off base here. If Jon\u2019s <a href=\"https://tacitwhisky.tumblr.com/post/185430416635/jon-sansa-reread-jon-i-agot\" target=\"_blank\">first chapter</a> showed anything it\u2019s that he is remarkably bitter about the cards life has dealt him and it\u2019ll be an ongoing aspect in this chapter too. So while it\u2019s dickish of Sansa to dismiss Jon\u2019s opinion because of his birth, she\u2019s not actually wrong on the substance of it.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cHe\u2019s our brother,\u201d Arya said, much too loudly. Her voice cut through the afternoon quiet of the tower room.</i></p><p><i>\u201cOur half brother,\u201d Sansa corrected, soft and precise.</i></p></blockquote><p>It\u2019s the same thing here with her calling Jon their half brother. Sansa is the Stark most aware of formalities, and there is a formal distance between Jon and the other starklings that even he observes (for example back in Bran I where he called Robb \u201cStark\u201d). There\u2019s a legitimate argument to be made that\u2019s Sansa\u2019s simply being precise here and not trying to distance him from them.</p><p>That\u2019s not how Arya perceives it though; for her to be bastard is to be other (we\u2019ll see this again in a minute), so when Sansa says, \u201cHe gets jealous because he\u2019s a bastard\u201d Arya immediately interprets that as Sansa othering and distancing Jon. Thus why her answer is that Jon is their brother despite Sansa not actually saying he wasn\u2019t related to them. Bastard is other, and Arya is closer to Jon than anyone.</p><p>I actually think since we don\u2019t get Sansa POV of this interaction there\u2019s enough ambiguity to support either reading depending on your headcanon: she may simply be being precise and formal, or she may be trying to distance Jon from them. Or maybe a mixture of both.</p><p>Of course, because we\u2019re in Arya\u2019s viewpoint and already preset to think the worst of Sansa, I imagine most readers interpreted it the second way on their first read, which would then make them dislike Sansa: we\u2019ve had two chapters to empathize with Jon, so just by narrative law our first loyalty is to him, and we\u2019re currently in Arya\u2019s viewpoint and thus biased towards her interpretations of events.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cArya, why aren\u2019t you at work?\u201d the septa asked. She rose to her feet, starched skirts rustling as she started across the room. \u201cLet me see your stitches.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Arya wanted to scream. It was just like Sansa to go and attract the septa\u2019s attention. \u201cHere,\u201d she said, surrendering up her work.</i></p><p><i>The septa examined the fabric. \u201cArya, Arya, Arya,\u201d she said. \u201cThis will not do. This will not do at all.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Everyone was looking at her. It was too much. Sansa was too well bred to smile at her sister\u2019s disgrace, but Jeyne was smirking on her behalf. Even Princess Myrcella looked sorry for her. Arya felt tears filling her eyes. She pushed herself out of her chair and bolted for the door.</i></p></blockquote><p>This is one of the pettier and crueler things Septa Mordane does. Instead of minimizing Arya\u2019s embarrassment, she amplifies it so she can preen and cast herself as long suffering. She truly is the worst.</p><p>There\u2019s also an interesting thing going on here where Arya\u2019s attributing things to Sansa that aren\u2019t actually happening. First she blames Sansa for attracting Mordane\u2019s attention, then thinks thinks Sansa is internally pleased at her embarrassment but just isn\u2019t showing it. In both instances there\u2019s no actual proof this is what\u2019s happening, but again we run into that cascade of negativity in how the reader sees Sansa. It also dovetails perfectly with the negative trope of the snooty feminine older sister that Sansa already falls into.</p><blockquote><p><i>It wasn\u2019t fair. Sansa had everything. Sansa was two years older; maybe by the time Arya had been born, there had been nothing left. Often it felt that way. Sansa could sew and dance and sing. She wrote poetry. She knew how to dress. She played the high harp and the bells. Worse, she was beautiful. Sansa had gotten their mother\u2019s fine high cheekbones and the thick auburn hair of the Tullys. Arya took after their lord father. Her hair was a lusterless brown, and her face was long and solemn. Jeyne used to call her Arya Horseface, and neigh whenever she came near.</i></p></blockquote><p>Again we see a zero sum dynamic between Sansa and Arya: there\u2019s only enough femininity for one of them, and Sansa already used it all up (again attributing something to Sansa that she actually has no control over).</p><p>It\u2019s also interesting to note that I think a lot of people actually conflate Sansa and Jeyne when it comes to their treatment of Arya: even I internally thought that both of them called Arya horseface, when the paragraph very clearly states it was just Jeyne. And while Sansa doesn\u2019t seem to have shut Jeyne down (though I can\u2019t remember if she ever knew Jeyne was doing that), it is worth noting that Sansa doesn\u2019t bully Arya, and outside of arguments doesn\u2019t seem to antagonize her.</p><p>This matters because Sansa and Jeyne despite being lumped together in Arya\u2019s head, actually occupy very different positions within Winterfell. I wish I had bookmarked it, but I just read a meta the other day about how galling Arya\u2019s existence must\u2019ve been for Jeyne; no matter how much closer she is to Sansa or better at feminine pursuits, Jeyne because of her birth will always be lower than Arya, never Sansa\u2019s true sister. Which is kind of fascinating when you remember that Jeyne will later be forced to be Arya when she\u2019s married to Ramsay. She gets what she wants, but very much not how she wanted it.</p><p>(this also makes me want to read a Jon x Jeyne AU. No? Just me? Fine)</p><blockquote><p><i>It hurt that the one thing Arya could do better than her sister was ride a horse. Well, that and manage a household. Sansa had never had much of a head for figures. If she did marry Prince Joff, Arya hoped for his sake that he had a good steward.</i></p></blockquote><p>Being canonically bad at horse riding and math are strangely enough two things people tend to forget about Sansa. Partly I\u2019m sure it\u2019s that this isn\u2019t in the show, and partly it just doesn\u2019t really jive with the rest of Sansa\u2019s character. Being able to manage a household is part of the westerosi feminine ideal, and so it doesn\u2019t really make sense that she\u2019d be bad at it, especially considering how well she is at logistics and managing a household later on in the Eyrie. Chalking this one up to early installment weirdness seems fair.</p><blockquote><p><i>By now Septa Mordane would certainly have sent word to her lady mother. If she went to her room, they would find her. Arya did not care to be found. She had a better notion. The boys were at practice in the yard. She wanted to see Robb put gallant Prince Joffrey flat on his back. \u201cCome,\u201d she whispered to Nymeria. She got up and ran, the wolf coming hard at her heels.</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>They [Arya and Nymeria] arrived, flushed and breathless, to find Jon seated on the sill, one leg drawn up languidly to his chin.</i></p></blockquote><p>This is a very Jon pose; composed, thoughtful, intent. It\u2019s actually low-key one of my favorite descriptions for just how much it tells you about Jon in just a few words. It\u2019s also very in keeping with how Bran described him in his chapter as slender and quick and graceful. Jon in these early chapters and from the viewpoint of Bran and Arya has a very different physicality to him than later when things are solely from his viewpoint. In these early chapters he\u2019s a little more bishie than later; partly because he\u2019s younger, partly because men don\u2019t think there appearance as much in fiction.</p><p>Which all on its own is interesting to contrast with Tyrion who is exceptionally aware of his body at all times, and the female characters who are much more attentive to what they wear and how they look. I tend to think it comes from Martin\u2019s, however subconscious, male gaze, but it also fits westeros: women from a young age are socialized to view themselves as sex objects and to be hyper aware of their attractiveness and appearance. It\u2019s sadly not that different from the real world.</p><blockquote><p><i>Jon gave her a curious look. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be working on your stitches, little sister?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Arya made a face at him. \u201cI wanted to see them fight.\u201d</i></p><p><i>He smiled. \u201cCome here, then.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Arya climbed up on the window and sat beside him, to a chorus of thuds and grunts from the yard below.</i></p><p><i>\u201cA shade more exhausting than needlework,\u201d Jon observed.</i></p><p><i>\u201cA shade more fun than needlework,\u201d Arya gave back at him. Jon grinned, reached over, and messed up her hair. Arya flushed. They had always been close. Jon had their father\u2019s face, as she did. They were the only ones. Robb and Sansa and Bran and even little Rickon all took after the Tullys, with easy smiles and fire in their hair. When Arya had been little, she had been afraid that meant that she was a bastard too. It had been Jon she had gone to in her fear, and Jon who had reassured her.</i></p></blockquote><p>Arya\u2019s fear that her outsider qualities stem from bastardy hints at just how much damage Catelyn\u2019s ostracization of Jon seeps unintentionally into the rest of the starklings. As we saw when Sansa called Jon a bastard, Arya equates bastardy with otherness. It\u2019s no doubt one of the reasons she\u2019s so close to Jon as they both don\u2019t feel like they fit. That and his unquestioning acceptance of her less feminine coded interests.</p><p>And just like when he gave up having his own wolf so Bran and the other starklings could get theirs, we see again just how much Jon loves his siblings. It must\u2019ve stung for Arya to so blatantly unhappy about being like him, but he wasn\u2019t bitter about it. In general with his siblings Jon doesn\u2019t get bitter (outside of some stuff with Robb), only when the rest of the world intrudes.</p><p>(this also marks the first of many, many, many times Arya thinks about Jon mussing her hair. It gets old)</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you down in the yard?\u201d Arya asked him.</i></p><p><i>He gave her a half smile. \u201cBastards are not allowed to damage young princes,\u201d he said. \u201cAny bruises they take in the practice yard must come from trueborn swords.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOh.\u201d Arya felt abashed. She should have realized. For the second time today, Arya reflected that life was not fair.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThe Lannisters are proud,\u201d Jon observed. \u201cYou\u2019d think the royal sigil would be sufficient, but no. He makes his mother\u2019s House equal in honor to the king\u2019s.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThe woman is important too!\u201d Arya protested.</i></p><p><i>Jon chuckled. \u201cPerhaps you should do the same thing, little sister. Wed Tully to Stark in your arms.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cA wolf with a fish in its mouth?\u201d It made her laugh. \u201cThat would look silly. Besides, if a girl can\u2019t fight, why should she have a coat of arms?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Jon shrugged. \u201cGirls get the arms but not the swords. Bastards get the swords but not the arms. I did not make the rules, little sister.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>Like with Tyrion <a href=\"https://tacitwhisky.tumblr.com/post/185430416635/jon-sansa-reread-jon-i-agot\" target=\"_blank\">last chapter</a>, we can see here the seeds of Jon\u2019s later ability to empathize and understand other marginalized groups. Jon\u2019s narrative is a constant examination of his own privilege and then using his bastard status as a way to extend sympathy and understanding. This is something he\u2019s challenged with again and again.<br></p><p>It\u2019s also reminiscent of <a href=\"https://tacitwhisky.tumblr.com/post/185340901530/jon-sansa-reread-bran-i-agot\" target=\"_blank\">Bran I</a> where he was sympathetic to Bran but also didn\u2019t hesitate to tell him the truth. Jon as a person is fiercely loyal and kind to those he cares about, but doesn\u2019t coddle. Like we talked about last chapter, because of his position Jon is keenly aware that the world is not fair.</p><blockquote><p><i>Jon watched them leave, and Arya watched Jon. His face had grown as still as the pool at the heart of the godswood. Finally he climbed down off the window. \u201cThe show is done,\u201d he said. He bent to scratch Ghost behind the ears. The white wolf rose and rubbed against him. \u201cYou had best run back to your room, little sister. Septa Mordane will surely be lurking. The longer you hide, the sterner the penance. You\u2019ll be sewing all through winter. When the spring thaw comes, they will find your body with a needle still locked tight between your frozen fingers.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Arya didn\u2019t think it was funny. \u201cI hate needlework!\u201d she said with passion. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNothing is fair,\u201d Jon said. He messed up her hair again and walked away from her, Ghost moving silently beside him.</i></p></blockquote><p>I find it endlessly hilarious how extra Jon tends to be in these Winterfell chapters; it\u2019s a good writing tip though. Teenagers in general tend to be extra.</p><p><b>Show Comparison</b></p><p>I\u2019m putting this as its own section this time because both of these scenes are almost entirely missing from the show: in the first episode we see Arya bored at sewing before she runs off to hang with the boys, but there\u2019s no confrontation or dialogue with Sansa. And the second scene with Jon simply doesn\u2019t exist.</p><p>While on the surface these aren\u2019t big cuts, and were most likely simply due to time constraints and attempts to streamline things, they do subtly change the characters and speak to an underlying difference in how D&amp;D see Arya and Sansa: feminine arts become something Arya generally despises because she thinks they\u2019re dumb, not something that she dislikes because she\u2019s bad at them and there\u2019s no place for someone like her in her society.</p><p>We also miss her \u201cthe woman matters too!\u201d exclamation, which is a far cry from her \u201cmost girls are dumb\u201d line later in the show. It\u2019s a subtle shift, but an important one.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>This wraps up Arya I. Overall it\u2019s a strong chapter, and an interesting introduction to Sansa: not a favorable one because of the POV, but one that\u2019s consistent with her character. We won\u2019t get her perspective on her relationship until both of them are well on their way south, but luckily for us we won\u2019t have to wait that long. Next reread will be Jon II where he has the infamous scene with Catelyn at Bran\u2019s bedside, and then the chapter after that will be Sansa I.</p><p>If you\u2019ve got any questions or comments hit me up on my asks; I love talking with you all.</p><p><b>Previous Chapters:</b></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://tacitwhisky.tumblr.com/post/185340901530/jon-sansa-reread-bran-i-agot\" target=\"_blank\">Bran I</a></li><li><a href=\"https://tacitwhisky.tumblr.com/post/185430416635/jon-sansa-reread-jon-i-agot\" target=\"_blank\">Jon I</a></li></ul><p>Next Chapter (Jon II) &gt;</p></p>",

But despite its simplicity, there\u2019s a lot going on in this chapter. Jon I introduced the first really big conflict in the Stark family (Jon vs Catelyn), and Arya I introduces the second (Sansa vs Arya). It also our first real introduction to Sansa; not just her as a person, but a character in her element and the social sphere she\u2019s most comfortable in. </p><p>Martin has said before that he originally created Sansa as a contrast for Arya and to introduce some conflict into the Stark family, and that\u2019s very much in evidence in these first few chapters, starting with how in the second paragraph of her very first POV chapter Arya is already being contrasted unfavorably with Sansa by Septa Mordane.</p><blockquote><p><i>Arya\u2019s stitches were crooked again.</i></p><p><i>She frowned down at them with dismay and glanced over to where her sister Sansa sat among the other girls. Sansa\u2019s needlework was exquisite. Everyone said so. \u201cSansa\u2019s work is as pretty as she is,\u201d Septa Mordane told their lady mother once. \u201cShe has such fine, delicate hands.\u201d When Lady Catelyn had asked about Arya, the septa had sniffed. \u201cArya has the hands of a blacksmith.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>There\u2019s a perception in fandom that Sansa and Arya fundamentally don\u2019t like each other or that Sansa was condescending to Arya, but something that\u2019s underrated is just how much the two are actively pitted against each other by Septa Mordane. And this is as good a time as any to mention that Septa Mordane fails epically in her role as a mentor and is kind of a dick. It\u2019s one thing for Septa Mordane to not want to encourage Arya\u2019s more rambunctious interests, but it\u2019s entirely another for her to constantly beat Arya down and reinforce her negative self image.</p><p>It\u2019s unfortunate in a lot of ways that Arya\u2019s POV comes before Sansa\u2019s. It\u2019s a known psychological phenomenon that your first impression of someone else really does affect how you see them: there\u2019s a study (wish I still had the link) where two groups were given the same list of actions someone took with the only difference being a negative or positive news story they had the group read about the person before the list of actions. Sure enough, people who read the negative news story rated that person\u2019s actions as more negative, while the people who read the positive news story rated their actions as more positive.</p><p>With Sansa all her negatives as a character are front loaded, and our perception of her is permanently tarnished by Arya\u2019s frustration and issues with her. This has the cascade of making the reader judge Sansa more harshly than they should for everything she does later.</p>[[MORE]]<blockquote><p><i>She looked glumly at her sister. Sansa was chatting away happily as she worked. Beth Cassel, Ser Rodrik\u2019s little girl, was sitting by her feet, listening to every word she said, and Jeyne Poole was leaning over to whisper something in her ear.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Arya asked suddenly.</i></p><p><i>Jeyne gave her a startled look, then giggled. Sansa looked abashed. Beth blushed. No one answered.</i></p></blockquote><p>Arya is pretty clearly excluded from this group, though considering what they\u2019re talking about it\u2019s not that surprising.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cJoffrey likes your sister,\u201d Jeyne whispered, proud as if she had something to do with it. She was the daughter of Winterfell\u2019s steward and Sansa\u2019s dearest friend. \u201cHe told her she was very beautiful.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHe\u2019s going to marry her,\u201d little Beth said dreamily, hugging herself. \u201cThen Sansa will be queen of all the realm.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Sansa had the grace to blush. She blushed prettily. She did everything prettily, Arya thought with dull resentment. \u201cBeth, you shouldn\u2019t make up stories,\u201d Sansa corrected the younger girl, gently stroking her hair to take the harshness out of her words. She looked at Arya. \u201cWhat did you think of Prince Joff, sister? He\u2019s very gallant, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>We can see here in Sansa holding court a lot her natural leadership qualities that will make her a good lady or queen someday. She\u2019s kind when she corrects Beth, and doesn\u2019t embarrass her. She also tries to include Arya in the conversation now that\u2019s she engaged in it. I think there\u2019s a tendency to read this interaction as Sansa fishing for a compliment, but there\u2019s no actual reason to read negative intent into it. She really does seem to just be trying to include Arya.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cJon says he looks like a girl,\u201d Arya said.</i></p><p><i>Sansa sighed as she stitched. \u201cPoor Jon,\u201d she said. \u201cHe gets jealous because he\u2019s a bastard.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>It\u2019s worth pointing out that Sansa isn\u2019t completely off base here. If Jon\u2019s <a href=\"https://tacitwhisky.tumblr.com/post/185430416635/jon-sansa-reread-jon-i-agot\" target=\"_blank\">first chapter</a> showed anything it\u2019s that he is remarkably bitter about the cards life has dealt him and it\u2019ll be an ongoing aspect in this chapter too. So while it\u2019s dickish of Sansa to dismiss Jon\u2019s opinion because of his birth, she\u2019s not actually wrong on the substance of it.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cHe\u2019s our brother,\u201d Arya said, much too loudly. Her voice cut through the afternoon quiet of the tower room.</i></p><p><i>\u201cOur half brother,\u201d Sansa corrected, soft and precise.</i></p></blockquote><p>It\u2019s the same thing here with her calling Jon their half brother. Sansa is the Stark most aware of formalities, and there is a formal distance between Jon and the other starklings that even he observes (for example back in Bran I where he called Robb \u201cStark\u201d). There\u2019s a legitimate argument to be made that\u2019s Sansa\u2019s simply being precise here and not trying to distance him from them.</p><p>That\u2019s not how Arya perceives it though; for her to be bastard is to be other (we\u2019ll see this again in a minute), so when Sansa says, \u201cHe gets jealous because he\u2019s a bastard\u201d Arya immediately interprets that as Sansa othering and distancing Jon. Thus why her answer is that Jon is their brother despite Sansa not actually saying he wasn\u2019t related to them. Bastard is other, and Arya is closer to Jon than anyone.</p><p>I actually think since we don\u2019t get Sansa POV of this interaction there\u2019s enough ambiguity to support either reading depending on your headcanon: she may simply be being precise and formal, or she may be trying to distance Jon from them. Or maybe a mixture of both.</p><p>Of course, because we\u2019re in Arya\u2019s viewpoint and already preset to think the worst of Sansa, I imagine most readers interpreted it the second way on their first read, which would then make them dislike Sansa: we\u2019ve had two chapters to empathize with Jon, so just by narrative law our first loyalty is to him, and we\u2019re currently in Arya\u2019s viewpoint and thus biased towards her interpretations of events.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cArya, why aren\u2019t you at work?\u201d the septa asked.

In both instances there\u2019s no actual proof this is what\u2019s happening, but again we run into that cascade of negativity in how the reader sees Sansa. It also dovetails perfectly with the negative trope of the snooty feminine older sister that Sansa already falls into.</p><blockquote><p><i>It wasn\u2019t fair. Sansa had everything. Sansa was two years older; maybe by the time Arya had been born, there had been nothing left. Often it felt that way. Sansa could sew and dance and sing. She wrote poetry. She knew how to dress. She played the high harp and the bells. Worse, she was beautiful. Sansa had gotten their mother\u2019s fine high cheekbones and the thick auburn hair of the Tullys. Arya took after their lord father. Her hair was a lusterless brown, and her face was long and solemn. Jeyne used to call her Arya Horseface, and neigh whenever she came near.</i></p></blockquote><p>Again we see a zero sum dynamic between Sansa and Arya: there\u2019s only enough femininity for one of them, and Sansa already used it all up (again attributing something to Sansa that she actually has no control over).</p><p>It\u2019s also interesting to note that I think a lot of people actually conflate Sansa and Jeyne when it comes to their treatment of Arya: even I internally thought that both of them called Arya horseface, when the paragraph very clearly states it was just Jeyne. And while Sansa doesn\u2019t seem to have shut Jeyne down (though I can\u2019t remember if she ever knew Jeyne was doing that), it is worth noting that Sansa doesn\u2019t bully Arya, and outside of arguments doesn\u2019t seem to antagonize her.</p><p>This matters because Sansa and Jeyne despite being lumped together in Arya\u2019s head, actually occupy very different positions within Winterfell. I wish I had bookmarked it, but I just read a meta the other day about how galling Arya\u2019s existence must\u2019ve been for Jeyne; no matter how much closer she is to Sansa or better at feminine pursuits, Jeyne because of her birth will always be lower than Arya, never Sansa\u2019s true sister. Which is kind of fascinating when you remember that Jeyne will later be forced to be Arya when she\u2019s married to Ramsay. She gets what she wants, but very much not how she wanted it.</p><p>(this also makes me want to read a Jon x Jeyne AU. No? Just me? Fine)</p><blockquote><p><i>It hurt that the one thing Arya could do better than her sister was ride a horse. Well, that and manage a household. Sansa had never had much of a head for figures.

Partly I\u2019m sure it\u2019s that this isn\u2019t in the show, and partly it just doesn\u2019t really jive with the rest of Sansa\u2019s character. Being able to manage a household is part of the westerosi feminine ideal, and so it doesn\u2019t really make sense that she\u2019d be bad at it, especially considering how well she is at logistics and managing a household later on in the Eyrie. Chalking this one up to early installment weirdness seems fair.</p><blockquote><p><i>By now Septa Mordane would certainly have sent word to her lady mother. If she went to her room, they would find her. Arya did not care to be found. She had a better notion. The boys were at practice in the yard. She wanted to see Robb put gallant Prince Joffrey flat on his back. \u201cCome,\u201d she whispered to Nymeria. She got up and ran, the wolf coming hard at her heels.</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>They [Arya and Nymeria] arrived, flushed and breathless, to find Jon seated on the sill, one leg drawn up languidly to his chin.</i></p></blockquote><p>This is a very Jon pose; composed, thoughtful, intent. It\u2019s actually low-key one of my favorite descriptions for just how much it tells you about Jon in just a few words. It\u2019s also very in keeping with how Bran described him in his chapter as slender and quick and graceful. Jon in these early chapters and from the viewpoint of Bran and Arya has a very different physicality to him than later when things are solely from his viewpoint. In these early chapters he\u2019s a little more bishie than later; partly because he\u2019s younger, partly because men don\u2019t think there appearance as much in fiction.</p><p>Which all on its own is interesting to contrast with Tyrion who is exceptionally aware of his body at all times, and the female characters who are much more attentive to what they wear and how they look. I tend to think it comes from Martin\u2019s, however subconscious, male gaze, but it also fits westeros: women from a young age are socialized to view themselves as sex objects and to be hyper aware of their attractiveness and appearance. It\u2019s sadly not that different from the real world.</p><blockquote><p><i>Jon gave her a curious look. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be working on your stitches, little sister?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Arya made a face at him. \u201cI wanted to see them fight.\u201d</i></p><p><i>He smiled. \u201cCome here, then.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Arya climbed up on the window and sat beside him, to a chorus of thuds and grunts from the yard below.</i></p><p><i>\u201cA shade more exhausting than needlework,\u201d Jon observed.</i></p><p><i>\u201cA shade more fun than needlework,\u201d Arya gave back at him. Jon grinned, reached over, and messed up her hair. Arya flushed. They had always been close. Jon had their father\u2019s face, as she did. They were the only ones. Robb and Sansa and Bran and even little Rickon all took after the Tullys, with easy smiles and fire in their hair. When Arya had been little, she had been afraid that meant that she was a bastard too. It had been Jon she had gone to in her fear, and Jon who had reassured her.</i></p></blockquote><p>Arya\u2019s fear that her outsider qualities stem from bastardy hints at just how much damage Catelyn\u2019s ostracization of Jon seeps unintentionally into the rest of the starklings. As we saw when Sansa called Jon a bastard, Arya equates bastardy with otherness. It\u2019s no doubt one of the reasons she\u2019s so close to Jon as they both don\u2019t feel like they fit. That and his unquestioning acceptance of her less feminine coded interests.</p><p>And just like when he gave up having his own wolf so Bran and the other starklings could get theirs, we see again just how much Jon loves his siblings. It must\u2019ve stung for Arya to so blatantly unhappy about being like him, but he wasn\u2019t bitter about it. In general with his siblings Jon doesn\u2019t get bitter (outside of some stuff with Robb), only when the rest of the world intrudes.</p><p>(this also marks the first of many, many, many times Arya thinks about Jon mussing her hair. It gets old)</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you down in the yard?\u201d Arya asked him.</i></p><p><i>He gave her a half smile. \u201cBastards are not allowed to damage young princes,\u201d he said. \u201cAny bruises they take in the practice yard must come from trueborn swords.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOh.\u201d Arya felt abashed. She should have realized. For the second time today, Arya reflected that life was not fair.</i></p><p><i>\u201cThe Lannisters are proud,\u201d Jon observed. \u201cYou\u2019d think the royal sigil would be sufficient, but no. He makes his mother\u2019s House equal in honor to the king\u2019s.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThe woman is important too!\u201d Arya protested.</i></p><p><i>Jon chuckled. \u201cPerhaps you should do the same thing, little sister. Wed Tully to Stark in your arms.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cA wolf with a fish in its mouth?\u201d It made her laugh. \u201cThat would look silly. Besides, if a girl can\u2019t fight, why should she have a coat of arms?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Jon shrugged. \u201cGirls get the arms but not the swords. Bastards get the swords but not the arms. I did not make the rules, little sister.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>Like with Tyrion <a href=\"https://tacitwhisky.tumblr.com/post/185430416635/jon-sansa-reread-jon-i-agot\" target=\"_blank\">last chapter</a>, we can see here the seeds of Jon\u2019s later ability to empathize and understand other marginalized groups. Jon\u2019s narrative is a constant examination of his own privilege and then using his bastard status as a way to extend sympathy and understanding. This is something he\u2019s challenged with again and again.<br></p><p>It\u2019s also reminiscent of <a href=\"https://tacitwhisky.tumblr.com/post/185340901530/jon-sansa-reread-bran-i-agot\" target=\"_blank\">Bran I</a> where he was sympathetic to Bran but also didn\u2019t hesitate to tell him the truth. Jon as a person is fiercely loyal and kind to those he cares about, but doesn\u2019t coddle. Like we talked about last chapter, because of his position Jon is keenly aware that the world is not fair.</p><blockquote><p><i>Jon watched them leave, and Arya watched Jon. His face had grown as still as the pool at the heart of the godswood. Finally he climbed down off the window. \u201cThe show is done,\u201d he said. He bent to scratch Ghost behind the ears. The white wolf rose and rubbed against him. \u201cYou had best run back to your room, little sister. Septa Mordane will surely be lurking. The longer you hide, the sterner the penance. You\u2019ll be sewing all through winter. When the spring thaw comes, they will find your body with a needle still locked tight between your frozen fingers.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Arya didn\u2019t think it was funny. \u201cI hate needlework!\u201d she said with passion. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNothing is fair,\u201d Jon said. He messed up her hair again and walked away from her, Ghost moving silently beside him.</i></p></blockquote><p>I find it endlessly hilarious how extra Jon tends to be in these Winterfell chapters; it\u2019s a good writing tip though. Teenagers in general tend to be extra.</p><p><b>Show Comparison</b></p><p>I\u2019m putting this as its own section this time because both of these scenes are almost entirely missing from the show: in the first episode we see Arya bored at sewing before she runs off to hang with the boys, but there\u2019s no confrontation or dialogue with Sansa. And the second scene with Jon simply doesn\u2019t exist.</p><p>While on the surface these aren\u2019t big cuts, and were most likely simply due to time constraints and attempts to streamline things, they do subtly change the characters and speak to an underlying difference in how D&amp;D see Arya and Sansa: feminine arts become something Arya generally despises because she thinks they\u2019re dumb, not something that she dislikes because she\u2019s bad at them and there\u2019s no place for someone like her in her society.</p><p>We also miss her \u201cthe woman matters too!\u201d exclamation, which is a far cry from her \u201cmost girls are dumb\u201d line later in the show. It\u2019s a subtle shift, but an important one.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>This wraps up Arya I. Overall it\u2019s a strong chapter, and an interesting introduction to Sansa: not a favorable one because of the POV, but one that\u2019s consistent with her character. We won\u2019t get her perspective on her relationship until both of them are well on their way south, but luckily for us we won\u2019t have to wait that long. Next reread will be Jon II where he has the infamous scene with Catelyn at Bran\u2019s bedside, and then the chapter after that will be Sansa I.</p><p>If you\u2019ve got any questions or comments hit me up on my asks; I love talking with you all.</p><p><b>Previous Chapters:</b></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://tacitwhisky.tumblr.com/post/185340901530/jon-sansa-reread-bran-i-agot\" target=\"_blank\">Bran I</a></li><li><a href=\"https://tacitwhisky.tumblr.com/post/185430416635/jon-sansa-reread-jon-i-agot\" target=\"_blank\">Jon I</a></li></ul><p>Next Chapter (Jon II) &gt;</p></p>",

But despite its simplicity, there&rsquo;s a lot going on in this chapter. Jon I introduced the first really big conflict in the Stark family (Jon vs Catelyn), and Arya I introduces the second (Sansa vs Arya). It also our first real introduction to Sansa; not just her as a person, but a character in her element and the social sphere she&rsquo;s most comfortable in. </p><p>Martin has said before that he originally created Sansa as a contrast for Arya and to introduce some conflict into the Stark family, and that&rsquo;s very much in evidence in these first few chapters, starting with how in the second paragraph of her very first POV chapter Arya is already being contrasted unfavorably with Sansa by Septa Mordane.</p><blockquote><p><i>Arya&rsquo;s stitches were crooked again.</i></p><p><i>She frowned down at them with dismay and glanced over to where her sister Sansa sat among the other girls. Sansa&rsquo;s needlework was exquisite. Everyone said so. &ldquo;Sansa&rsquo;s work is as pretty as she is,&rdquo; Septa Mordane told their lady mother once. &ldquo;She has such fine, delicate hands.&rdquo; When Lady Catelyn had asked about Arya, the septa had sniffed. &ldquo;Arya has the hands of a blacksmith.&rdquo;</i></p></blockquote><p>There&rsquo;s a perception in fandom that Sansa and Arya fundamentally don&rsquo;t like each other or that Sansa was condescending to Arya, but something that&rsquo;s underrated is just how much the two are actively pitted against each other by Septa Mordane. And this is as good a time as any to mention that Septa Mordane fails epically in her role as a mentor and is kind of a dick. It&rsquo;s one thing for Septa Mordane to not want to encourage Arya&rsquo;s more rambunctious interests, but it&rsquo;s entirely another for her to constantly beat Arya down and reinforce her negative self image.</p><p>It&rsquo;s unfortunate in a lot of ways that Arya&rsquo;s POV comes before Sansa&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s a known psychological phenomenon that your first impression of someone else really does affect how you see them: there&rsquo;s a study (wish I still had the link) where two groups were given the same list of actions someone took with the only difference being a negative or positive news story they had the group read about the person before the list of actions. Sure enough, people who read the negative news story rated that person&rsquo;s actions as more negative, while the people who read the positive news story rated their actions as more positive.</p><p>With Sansa all her negatives as a character are front loaded, and our perception of her is permanently tarnished by Arya&rsquo;s frustration and issues with her. This has the cascade of making the reader judge Sansa more harshly than they should for everything she does later.</p><blockquote><p><i>She looked glumly at her sister. Sansa was chatting away happily as she worked. Beth Cassel, Ser Rodrik&rsquo;s little girl, was sitting by her feet, listening to every word she said, and Jeyne Poole was leaning over to whisper something in her ear.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo; Arya asked suddenly.</i></p><p><i>Jeyne gave her a startled look, then giggled. Sansa looked abashed. Beth blushed. No one answered.</i></p></blockquote><p>Arya is pretty clearly excluded from this group, though considering what they&rsquo;re talking about it&rsquo;s not that surprising.</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Joffrey likes your sister,&rdquo; Jeyne whispered, proud as if she had something to do with it. She was the daughter of Winterfell&rsquo;s steward and Sansa&rsquo;s dearest friend. &ldquo;He told her she was very beautiful.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to marry her,&rdquo; little Beth said dreamily, hugging herself. &ldquo;Then Sansa will be queen of all the realm.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Sansa had the grace to blush. She blushed prettily. She did everything prettily, Arya thought with dull resentment. &ldquo;Beth, you shouldn&rsquo;t make up stories,&rdquo; Sansa corrected the younger girl, gently stroking her hair to take the harshness out of her words. She looked at Arya. &ldquo;What did you think of Prince Joff, sister? He&rsquo;s very gallant, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</i></p></blockquote><p>We can see here in Sansa holding court a lot her natural leadership qualities that will make her a good lady or queen someday. She&rsquo;s kind when she corrects Beth, and doesn&rsquo;t embarrass her. She also tries to include Arya in the conversation now that&rsquo;s she engaged in it. I think there&rsquo;s a tendency to read this interaction as Sansa fishing for a compliment, but there&rsquo;s no actual reason to read negative intent into it. She really does seem to just be trying to include Arya.</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Jon says he looks like a girl,&rdquo; Arya said.</i></p><p><i>Sansa sighed as she stitched. &ldquo;Poor Jon,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He gets jealous because he&rsquo;s a bastard.&rdquo;</i></p></blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s worth pointing out that Sansa isn&rsquo;t completely off base here. If Jon&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://tacitwhisky.tumblr.com/post/185430416635/jon-sansa-reread-jon-i-agot\" target=\"_blank\">first chapter</a> showed anything it&rsquo;s that he is remarkably bitter about the cards life has dealt him and it&rsquo;ll be an ongoing aspect in this chapter too. So while it&rsquo;s dickish of Sansa to dismiss Jon&rsquo;s opinion because of his birth, she&rsquo;s not actually wrong on the substance of it.</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s our brother,&rdquo; Arya said, much too loudly. Her voice cut through the afternoon quiet of the tower room.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Our half brother,&rdquo; Sansa corrected, soft and precise.</i></p></blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s the same thing here with her calling Jon their half brother. Sansa is the Stark most aware of formalities, and there is a formal distance between Jon and the other starklings that even he observes (for example back in Bran I where he called Robb &ldquo;Stark&rdquo;). There&rsquo;s a legitimate argument to be made that&rsquo;s Sansa&rsquo;s simply being precise here and not trying to distance him from them.</p><p>That&rsquo;s not how Arya perceives it though; for her to be bastard is to be other (we&rsquo;ll see this again in a minute), so when Sansa says, &ldquo;He gets jealous because he&rsquo;s a bastard&rdquo; Arya immediately interprets that as Sansa othering and distancing Jon. Thus why her answer is that Jon is their brother despite Sansa not actually saying he wasn&rsquo;t related to them. Bastard is other, and Arya is closer to Jon than anyone.</p><p>I actually think since we don&rsquo;t get Sansa POV of this interaction there&rsquo;s enough ambiguity to support either reading depending on your headcanon: she may simply be being precise and formal, or she may be trying to distance Jon from them. Or maybe a mixture of both.</p><p>Of course, because we&rsquo;re in Arya&rsquo;s viewpoint and already preset to think the worst of Sansa, I imagine most readers interpreted it the second way on their first read, which would then make them dislike Sansa: we&rsquo;ve had two chapters to empathize with Jon, so just by narrative law our first loyalty is to him, and we&rsquo;re currently in Arya&rsquo;s viewpoint and thus biased towards her interpretations of events.</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Arya, why aren&rsquo;t you at work?&rdquo; the septa asked. She rose to her feet, starched skirts rustling as she started across the room. &ldquo;Let me see your stitches.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Arya wanted to scream. It was just like Sansa to go and attract the septa&rsquo;s attention. &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; she said, surrendering up her work.</i></p><p><i>The septa examined the fabric. &ldquo;Arya, Arya, Arya,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;This will not do. This will not do at all.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Everyone was looking at her. It was too much. Sansa was too well bred to smile at her sister&rsquo;s disgrace, but Jeyne was smirking on her behalf. Even Princess Myrcella looked sorry for her. Arya felt tears filling her eyes. She pushed herself out of her chair and bolted for the door.</i></p></blockquote><p>This is one of the pettier and crueler things Septa Mordane does. Instead of minimizing Arya&rsquo;s embarrassment, she amplifies it so she can preen and cast herself as long suffering. She truly is the worst.</p><p>There&rsquo;s also an interesting thing going on here where Arya&rsquo;s attributing things to Sansa that aren&rsquo;t actually happening. First she blames Sansa for attracting Mordane&rsquo;s attention, then thinks thinks Sansa is internally pleased at her embarrassment but just isn&rsquo;t showing it. In both instances there&rsquo;s no actual proof this is what&rsquo;s happening, but again we run into that cascade of negativity in how the reader sees Sansa. It also dovetails perfectly with the negative trope of the snooty feminine older sister that Sansa already falls into.</p><blockquote><p><i>It wasn&rsquo;t fair. Sansa had everything. Sansa was two years older; maybe by the time Arya had been born, there had been nothing left. Often it felt that way. Sansa could sew and dance and sing. She wrote poetry. She knew how to dress. She played the high harp and the bells. Worse, she was beautiful. Sansa had gotten their mother&rsquo;s fine high cheekbones and the thick auburn hair of the Tullys. Arya took after their lord father. Her hair was a lusterless brown, and her face was long and solemn. Jeyne used to call her Arya Horseface, and neigh whenever she came near.</i></p></blockquote><p>Again we see a zero sum dynamic between Sansa and Arya: there&rsquo;s only enough femininity for one of them, and Sansa already used it all up (again attributing something to Sansa that she actually has no control over).</p><p>It&rsquo;s also interesting to note that I think a lot of people actually conflate Sansa and Jeyne when it comes to their treatment of Arya: even I internally thought that both of them called Arya horseface, when the paragraph very clearly states it was just Jeyne.

In general with his siblings Jon doesn&rsquo;t get bitter (outside of some stuff with Robb), only when the rest of the world intrudes.</p><p>(this also marks the first of many, many, many times Arya thinks about Jon mussing her hair. It gets old)</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t you down in the yard?&rdquo; Arya asked him.</i></p><p><i>He gave her a half smile. &ldquo;Bastards are not allowed to damage young princes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Any bruises they take in the practice yard must come from trueborn swords.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; Arya felt abashed. She should have realized. For the second time today, Arya reflected that life was not fair.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;The Lannisters are proud,&rdquo; Jon observed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d think the royal sigil would be sufficient, but no. He makes his mother&rsquo;s House equal in honor to the king&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;The woman is important too!&rdquo; Arya protested.</i></p><p><i>Jon chuckled. &ldquo;Perhaps you should do the same thing, little sister. Wed Tully to Stark in your arms.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;A wolf with a fish in its mouth?&rdquo; It made her laugh. &ldquo;That would look silly. Besides, if a girl can&rsquo;t fight, why should she have a coat of arms?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Jon shrugged. &ldquo;Girls get the arms but not the swords. Bastards get the swords but not the arms. I did not make the rules, little sister.&rdquo;</i></p></blockquote><p>Like with Tyrion <a href=\"https://tacitwhisky.tumblr.com/post/185430416635/jon-sansa-reread-jon-i-agot\" target=\"_blank\">last chapter</a>, we can see here the seeds of Jon&rsquo;s later ability to empathize and understand other marginalized groups. Jon&rsquo;s narrative is a constant examination of his own privilege and then using his bastard status as a way to extend sympathy and understanding. This is something he&rsquo;s challenged with again and again.<br /></p><p>It&rsquo;s also reminiscent of <a href=\"https://tacitwhisky.tumblr.com/post/185340901530/jon-sansa-reread-bran-i-agot\" target=\"_blank\">Bran I</a> where he was sympathetic to Bran but also didn&rsquo;t hesitate to tell him the truth. Jon as a person is fiercely loyal and kind to those he cares about, but doesn&rsquo;t coddle. Like we talked about last chapter, because of his position Jon is keenly aware that the world is not fair.</p><blockquote><p><i>Jon watched them leave, and Arya watched Jon. His face had grown as still as the pool at the heart of the godswood. Finally he climbed down off the window. &ldquo;The show is done,&rdquo; he said. He bent to scratch Ghost behind the ears. The white wolf rose and rubbed against him. &ldquo;You had best run back to your room, little sister. Septa Mordane will surely be lurking. The longer you hide, the sterner the penance. You&rsquo;ll be sewing all through winter. When the spring thaw comes, they will find your body with a needle still locked tight between your frozen fingers.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Arya didn&rsquo;t think it was funny. &ldquo;I hate needlework!&rdquo; she said with passion. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not fair!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Nothing is fair,&rdquo; Jon said. He messed up her hair again and walked away from her, Ghost moving silently beside him.</i></p></blockquote><p>I find it endlessly hilarious how extra Jon tends to be in these Winterfell chapters; it&rsquo;s a good writing tip though. Teenagers in general tend to be extra.</p><p><b>Show Comparison</b></p><p>I&rsquo;m putting this as its own section this time because both of these scenes are almost entirely missing from the show: in the first episode we see Arya bored at sewing before she runs off to hang with the boys, but there&rsquo;s no confrontation or dialogue with Sansa. And the second scene with Jon simply doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p><p>While on the surface these aren&rsquo;t big cuts, and were most likely simply due to time constraints and attempts to streamline things, they do subtly change the characters and speak to an underlying difference in how D&amp;D see Arya and Sansa: feminine arts become something Arya generally despises because she thinks they&rsquo;re dumb, not something that she dislikes because she&rsquo;s bad at them and there&rsquo;s no place for someone like her in her society.</p><p>We also miss her &ldquo;the woman matters too!&rdquo; exclamation, which is a far cry from her &ldquo;most girls are dumb&rdquo; line later in the show. It&rsquo;s a subtle shift, but an important one.</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>This wraps up Arya I. Overall it&rsquo;s a strong chapter, and an interesting introduction to Sansa: not a favorable one because of the POV, but one that&rsquo;s consistent with her character. We won&rsquo;t get her perspective on her relationship until both of them are well on their way south, but luckily for us we won&rsquo;t have to wait that long. Next reread will be Jon II where he has the infamous scene with Catelyn at Bran&rsquo;s bedside, and then the chapter after that will be Sansa I.</p><p>If you&rsquo;ve got any questions or comments hit me up on my asks; I love talking with you all.</p><p><b>Previous Chapters:</b></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://tacitwhisky.tumblr.com/post/185340901530/jon-sansa-reread-bran-i-agot\" target=\"_blank\">Bran I</a></li><li><a href=\"https://tacitwhisky.tumblr.com/post/185430416635/jon-sansa-reread-jon-i-agot\" target=\"_blank\">Jon I</a></li></ul><p>Next Chapter (Jon II) &gt;</p></p>",

But despite its simplicity, there&rsquo;s a lot going on in this chapter. Jon I introduced the first really big conflict in the Stark family (Jon vs Catelyn), and Arya I introduces the second (Sansa vs Arya). It also our first real introduction to Sansa; not just her as a person, but a character in her element and the social sphere she&rsquo;s most comfortable in. </p>\n<p>Martin has said before that he originally created Sansa as a contrast for Arya and to introduce some conflict into the Stark family, and that&rsquo;s very much in evidence in these first few chapters, starting with how in the second paragraph of her very first POV chapter Arya is already being contrasted unfavorably with Sansa by Septa Mordane.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><i>Arya&rsquo;s stitches were crooked again.</i></p>\n<p><i>She frowned down at them with dismay and glanced over to where her sister Sansa sat among the other girls. Sansa&rsquo;s needlework was exquisite. Everyone said so. &ldquo;Sansa&rsquo;s work is as pretty as she is,&rdquo; Septa Mordane told their lady mother once. &ldquo;She has such fine, delicate hands.&rdquo; When Lady Catelyn had asked about Arya, the septa had sniffed. &ldquo;Arya has the hands of a blacksmith.&rdquo;</i></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There&rsquo;s a perception in fandom that Sansa and Arya fundamentally don&rsquo;t like each other or that Sansa was condescending to Arya, but something that&rsquo;s underrated is just how much the two are actively pitted against each other by Septa Mordane. And this is as good a time as any to mention that Septa Mordane fails epically in her role as a mentor and is kind of a dick. It&rsquo;s one thing for Septa Mordane to not want to encourage Arya&rsquo;s more rambunctious interests, but it&rsquo;s entirely another for her to constantly beat Arya down and reinforce her negative self image.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s unfortunate in a lot of ways that Arya&rsquo;s POV comes before Sansa&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s a known psychological phenomenon that your first impression of someone else really does affect how you see them: there&rsquo;s a study (wish I still had the link) where two groups were given the same list of actions someone took with the only difference being a negative or positive news story they had the group read about the person before the list of actions. Sure enough, people who read the negative news story rated that person&rsquo;s actions as more negative, while the people who read the positive news story rated their actions as more positive.</p>\n<p>With Sansa all her negatives as a character are front loaded, and our perception of her is permanently tarnished by Arya&rsquo;s frustration and issues with her. This has the cascade of making the reader judge Sansa more harshly than they should for everything she does later.</p>\n</p>",
