I do think you should be dating someone else. I do think you don\u2019t belong to me.\u201d He buried his face in his hands, but kept on mumbling. \u201cBut not because I don\u2019t want you or don\u2019t love you!

You\u2019ll break my soul.\u201d He paused for a moment. \u201cBut you know?\u201d He looked up at the moon, at the stars, at the trees, freed from their weight, waving in the wind. \u201cI\u2019ll let you!\u201d He started yelling now. \u201cBecause those few moments, those few kisses, those nights\u2026.\u201d He licked his lips. \u201cIt\u2019s all worth it.\u201d</p><p>A warm hand rested on his back.

You\u2019re emphatic and kind. You\u2019re understanding. You prefer peace over war. You want to save lives instead of destroying them\u201d She shook her head. \u201cYou don\u2019t see yourself as a knight in shining armor or a prince on a white horse.\u201d She cocked her head. \u201cBecause you are neither of those.\u201d </p><p>Jon held his breath, longer than he had ever thought himself capable of.</p><p>\u201cYou are the king of my kingdom, my love and my heart.

She would appeal to the Vale knights and lords based on her knowledge of heraldry, and actually call a trial for the true mastermind, thus bringing about the Justice Catelyn wanted.

                "content": "<p><p><b>HISTORY / BRIEF DESCRIPTION:</b></p><blockquote><p><small>Sansa, born into one of most noble houses, that being House Stark of Winterfell, was brought up according to the ways of women in Westeros. From a young age, she was taught the arts of sewing, music, and so forth, how to be courteous and gentle. Whilst her family did encourage a good level of education also, she never received more the physical sort that her brothers did, nor did she receive the ability to be as politically minded as they were. They would grow up to be rulers of the land, she would grow up to be a Lady, a wife and mother foremost, and unlike her younger sister Arya, she is welcome and willing of this role, not aware yet of the poison that fills the hearts of so many people.</small></p><p><small>As she grew, she yearned to hear all the romantic tales of Knights and their Ladies, the love songs passed through ages, beauty found in them. She started to always want a life of her own that would be as fairy tale as these, becoming a true romantic at heart. Naive as to the ways of the world, she continues to believe that her life will be so. She tries to play the part well enough, becoming benevolent and courteous in all that she does, striving to be right. Though her father is gone, she wishes to make him proud with the steps that she takes in life. Her family has always been extremely dear to her, and she idealizes her newfound father figure, and older brother especially.</small></p><p><small>However, she&rsquo;s impressionable and easily taken in, her traditional values and naivety hardly an aid in the troublesome world that she&rsquo;s soon to encounter. In the Game of Thrones, you win or you die, and she&rsquo;s currently merely a pawn in the web of lies, though she&rsquo;ll grow into a player in her own time.</small></p></blockquote><p><b>STATISTICS: </b></p><blockquote><p><small>BIRTH YEAR: 284 AC. <br />MARITAL STATUS: Unmarried<br />GENDER: Female<br /><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Feasydamus.com%2Falignmenttest.html&amp;t=ZjhmNWEwZTQzZjNjMWI2NzczZjE4OTM3NjM2YjIxNjE4NTE4Njg1MSxnQUNJdXlvRA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3Axqr-xupHDjF5KFndIUJp6Q&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ficeandfirerpg.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F179376296185%2Flineage-sansa-stark-is-the-second-child-and&amp;m=1\">MORAL ALIGNMENT</a>: &nbsp;Lawful Neutral<br />SUN SIGN: Pisces<br />POSITIVE TRAITS: Idealistic, benevolent, resilient, courteous, adaptable<br />NEGATIVE TRAITS: Naive, impressionable, prideful, vengeful, traditional</small></p></blockquote><p><b>LINEAGE:</b></p><blockquote><p><small>\n\n<i>mother:</i> &nbsp;Catelyn Stark n&eacute;e Tully&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><i>father: </i>Brandon Stark &dagger;\n\n<br /><i>siblings: </i><strike>Rodrik</strike><i>,&nbsp;</i>Eyron, Arya, Bran, &amp; Rickon Stark<br /><i>aunt:</i> Lysa Arryn<br /><i>uncles:</i> Ned Stark, Benjen Stark, Edmure Tully<br /><i>maternal cousins</i>: &nbsp;Jasper &amp; Kyra Arryn<br /><i>paternal cousins</i>: Aegon Targaryen, Lyna &amp; Rodrik Stark<br /></small></p></blockquote><p><b>FACE CLAIM:</b></p><blockquote><p><small>Sophie Turner</small></p></blockquote></p>",
