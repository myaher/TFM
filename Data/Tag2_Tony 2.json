Just a few days from home is all. Why did\nyou take off wandering?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause\nthere isn&rsquo;t an Alpha in the world with enough common sense to take a\nthrone at twenty one.\u201d Steve informed him, and Tony muffled a\ngiggle into his hand. \u201cI wasn&rsquo;t ready to rule and there was an\nentire world out there to see and my best friend&ndash;\u201d</p><p>For\nthe first time, the Alpha&rsquo;s smile faltered and dimmed. \u201cMy best\nfriend went off to find fortune and fame as a knight when he came of\nage.

And by the time\nI was ready to come and join him&ndash;\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlpha?\u201d\nTony whispered when the broad shoulders sagged in remembered grief.\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d \n</p><p>\u201cThe\nlast letter from him came from a spot of war on this continent.\u201d\nSteve cleared his throat and went back to unpacking, laying out\nanother blanket for them to lie on. \u201cSo my parents gave me Nomad as\na coming of age present and I set off across the sea to find him.\u201d</p><p><i>I never did find him</i> went unspoken in the air and Tony felt his heart break a little for his mate.\u00a0\u201cEight\nyears you&rsquo;ve been looking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEight\nyears I&rsquo;ve been <i>wandering</i>.\u201d Steve corrected without looking away from the blankets. \u201cI\nhoped I would find him of course, but the continents been involved in\nwar for so long and so many soldiers have fallen, I know I never\nwill.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo\nyou stayed wandering to find your own adventure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nstayed wandering to find my own adventure.\u201d Steve agreed, then\nundid the clasp of his wine skin and offered it to Tony, mustering up a smile when\ntheir hands brushed. \u201cAnd what an adventure I found, hm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m\nsorry about your friend.\u201d Tony took a sip of the wine and hummed\nagreeably when he found the taste to his liking. \u201cBut not sorry you\nended up here. Is that alright to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d\nSteve said warmly, then sat himself down on the far edge of the pile\nof blankets, motioning to the other side for Tony to sit as well. \u201cNo\nreason for you to sit way over there, sweetheart, at least come sit\nsome where comfortable.\u201d</p><p>Tony\nbrought the blanket he&rsquo;d been sitting on to roll up as a pillow and\npropped it behind his back, sitting cross legged&ndash; and not close\nenough to his Alpha as \u00a0far as he was concerned&ndash; and clasping his\nhands in his lap.</p><p>\u201cWhat&rsquo;s\nyour best friends name?\u201d Steve took the wine back for a drink and\nset it aside, mirroring Tony&rsquo;s position on their bed. \u201cAnd how long\nhave you known them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy\nbest friend&ndash;\u201d Tony started to answer, then frowned. \u201cYou know, I\ndon&rsquo;t have a best friend. No one other than Jarvis, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho&rsquo;s\nJarvis?\u201d Steve prompted, inching just a tiny bit closer and\nthrilling clear to his <i>soul </i>when the Omega budged closer as well,\nrelieved his mate felt the same urge to be near.</p><p>\u201cJarvis\nis the Beta that raised me, along with his mate Ana. My parents&ndash;\u201d\n<i>were murdered.</i> \u201c&ndash;passed when I was young and they took me in. Tell\nme about where you live?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cOur\ncastle is on\na cliff overlooking the sea.\u201d Steve&rsquo;s fingers itched with the need\nto erase the hint of sadness in the Omega&rsquo;s eyes. \u201cThere are gardens behind\nthe castle, and I can climb down the cliffs to the beach below and\nswim in the waves. Fishing too, do you like to fish?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2019ve\nnever tried.\u201d Tony answered truthfully. \u201cMy home is&ndash;\u201d <i>Dark.\nCursed. Not home at all anymore.</i>\u00a0\u201c&ndash;surrounded by forest on all\nsides and very few plants or flowers grow. The river here is the\nclosest I am to ever seeing water.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou&rsquo;ll\nlove our castle.\u201d Steve decided. \u201cIt\u2019s where my parents fell in\nlove, right there on the beach. My dad knew my ma was the perfect\nOmega for him, so he went running down the sands one day and scooped\nher up into his arms ready to make a proclamation of love and intent\nto bond. My ma was so startled at being snatched up by an Alpha, she flailed around and smacked the hell out of him and he dropped her\nright in the waves, right on the rocks and bruised her ribs all up.\u201d</p><p>\nTony\nburst into horrified laughter and Steve laughed too. \u201cHe picked her\nup off the rocks and informer her that she was his mate. Ma said \u2018the\nhell I am\u2019 and stomped away. Made him chase for her almost a year\nbefore she so much as let him close enough to scent her again.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cSo\nyou <i>don&rsquo;t </i>get your charm from your father, then?\u201d Tony hazarded a guess and\nthe Alpha laughed even louder. \u201cBut\nthey <i>were </i>mates, weren&rsquo;t they? And she would have known right away\ntoo, so why did she make him wait?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cBecause\nma wanted to know he wasn\u2019t just scent stupid and looking for an\nOmega to rut on.\u201d Steve took another sip from the wine and passed\nit over again. \u201cForgive my crudeness, what I meant to say is&ndash;\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cHe\nwas looking for a warm spot to bury his knot and she was the closest\nthing that didn\u2019t stink?\u201d Tony finished and the Alpha barked a\ndelighted laugh at the impish grin the Omega sent his way. \u201cI was\nraised by Betas who have very little tolerance for Alphas and\ntheir antics. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve heard all sorts of things about\nyour lot.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cAll\nterrible, I\u2019m sure.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cOh\nI don\u2019t know.\u201d Tony let his gaze drift appreciatively over\nSteve\u2019s frame. \u201cI\u2019m starting to think Alpha&rsquo;s aren\u2019t <i>all\n</i>bad.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\nSteve\npreened under the attention from the lovely brunette, rolling his\nshoulders and letting the seams of his coat pull tight over his arms\nso Tony would keep looking, but he readied another question to turn the conversation back around to getting to know each other,\nnot willing to get too distracted by&ndash;</p><p>\n\u201cTake\nyour coat off.\u201d The Omega demanded in a sort of whisper the Alpha had only ever <i>dreamed </i>about hearing.\n\u201cIt&rsquo;s warm enough, isn&rsquo;t it? I&rsquo;d like to see you, if you don&rsquo;t\nmind.\u201d</p><p>\nIt\nwas warm by the fire, almost unnaturally so, the usual freezing\ntemperatures of the winter night seeming not to exist in the circle\nof their clearing and Steve suddenly realized he was sweating\nunder the long jacket.</p><p>And it\ndidn&rsquo;t matter if he was sweating from the unexpected warmth of the\nwinter night or if he was sweating because his Omega had been bold\nenough to ask to see him&ndash; either way Steve stood and stripped the coat\naway without a seconds hesitation, letting it fall carelessly onto\nthe ground.</p><p>\n\u201cBetter?\u201d\nHe barely managed to get the words out over the <i>shine </i>in his mate&rsquo;s\neyes, the fire reflecting onto Tony&rsquo;s face and turning the deep brown\na rich whiskey color. \u201cOmega?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cMuch.\u201d\nTony didn&rsquo;t bother making an effort not to stare, licking his lips as he looked the Alpha over, admiring\nthe cut of fitted trousers over Steve&rsquo;s thighs and the way his waist\nlooked so small compared to the breadth of his shoulders. \u201c&hellip;thank\nyou.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cAre\nyou warm too, my love?\u201d Steve asked hoarsely, his hands clenching\nat his sides as if restraining himself from reaching out. \u201cCould\nyou&ndash; your jacket as well?\u201d</p><p>Tony wanted to tease about how just a bit\nearlier the Alpha had given him a blanket to cover up with, but Steve\ngave an urgent, <i>coaxing </i>growl and Tony just nodded instead, shrugging\nout of his jacket and pushing it away.</p><p>\u201cMy favorite color&rsquo;s blue.\u201d Steve said\nthen, loving the way the silk clung to his mate&rsquo;s collarbone, the\nlace on the hems that gave peeks at skin beneath. \u201cYou&rsquo;re beautiful\nin it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d The Omega looked so pleased\nby the compliment Steve wondered for a moment if Tony had never been\npraised before but that&ndash; <i>that </i>couldn&rsquo;t be true. His mate was breathtaking, stunning in a way that was nearly ethereal, gorgeous even\njust sitting there in a torn shirt and&ndash;</p><p><i>A torn shirt?</i></p><p>\n\u201cIs\nthat a <i>bruise </i>on your wrist?\u201d The light moment was banished\nabruptly by an angry snarl from the Alpha, Steve all but leaping\nacross the blankets to snatch at Tony\u2019s wrist, the one he hadn\u2019t\nseen before when Tony had been wearing his coat. \u201cMy Omega, did\nsomeone hurt you?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh\nit&rsquo;s&ndash;\u201d Tony tugged at his shirt sleeve half-heartedly. \u201cIt\u2019s\nnothing.

Tell me about\nyour friends Ana and Jarvis.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cAna\nand Jarvis are saints.\u201d Tony dipped his head to lick experimentally\nat the hollow of Steve&rsquo;s throat, thrilling over the Alpha&rsquo;s answering\nwhine. \u201cJarvis taught me how to use the stars to find my way and how\nto tie knots and use a sword and Ana&ndash;\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Steve\nmoaned aloud over the dig of fangs at his collarbone. \u201cAna taught\nme how to make bread and how to mend clothes and how to garden. They\nwere both determined I wouldn\u2019t grow up useless, and never missed\nan opportunity to tell me that just because I was <i>spoiled </i>didn\u2019t\nmean someone would always be there to bring me food.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cThey\nsound practical and boring.\u201d Steve informed him, panting with the\neffort of conversation when he&rsquo;d much rather be pinning his mate to\nthe blankets and losing himself in another moment entirely.\u00a0\u201cNo fun at all.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever let Ana hear\nthat.\u201d Tony sassed back. \u201cShe\u2019ll send you out to the yard to beat rugs or something\nequally awful.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cI\nthink I\u2019m big enough to beat any rugs your Ana sends me for.\u201d the\nAlpha nosed at Tony&rsquo;s cheek so the Omega would sit back and look at\nhim. \u201cDo you have a favorite food?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cApples.\u201d\nTony\u2019s smile was <i>brilliant</i>, fangs on full display and Steve thought\nhe could have melted from how beautiful it was. \u201cI love apples.\nPlain or with cinnamon, baked into pies or served over meat, I love\napple cider and apple sauce and anything else along those lines.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWe\nhave apple orchards at the castle.\u201d Steve rubbed his thumb along\nTony&rsquo;s bottom lip. \u201c<i>Acres </i>of them. Green and red and this mixed\napple our gardeners were working on when I left, something pink and\ncrisp, I only had it once but I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s amazing, you would love\nit. When I bring you home with me&ndash;\u201d He fit his palm to the back of\nTony&rsquo;s neck, pressing purposefully over the bonding mark and rumbling\nin satisfaction when the Omega automatically arched into it, tipping\nhis head back to offer more of himself.</p><p>\u201cHow\ndo I scent to you, Omega?\u201d Steve forgot all about <i>apples </i>as Tony melted\nforward into his chest, notched his nose into the curve of Steve&rsquo;s\nthroat and hummed against his skin. \u201cDo I scent&ndash; I know we match,\nobviously our scents match, but do you <i>like </i>it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nscent like rosewood.\u201d Tony crooned into the Alpha&rsquo;s ear. \u201cRosewood\nlike what I work with in my shop and pine trees like the ones that\ngrow outside my window. And you scent warm.\u201d he tried to get closer\nstill. \u201cYou scent warm and I feel as if I&rsquo;ve been cold for my\nentire life. Didn&rsquo;t realize how cold I was until you made me feel\nwarm.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cMmm,\nmy love.\u201d Steve whispered, playing at the hem of Tony&rsquo;s blouse but\nnot daring to lift it without permission. \u201cI&rsquo;ll always keep you\nwarm, don&rsquo;t you worry.\u201d</p><p>\nTony\nhesitated, kneading his fingers into the muscle at Steve&rsquo;s shoulder\nand biting his lip nervously. \u201cI&rsquo;m a little&ndash; I&rsquo;m a little cold\nnow. Would you hold me a tighter? Closer?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cOh.\u201d\nThe blue eyes flared red for a second before the Alpha got himself\nunder control. \u201cYes sweetheart, come here. Right here.\u201d</p><p>\nBig\nhands up and under Tony&rsquo;s legs and he gave a startled yelp when the\nAlpha picked him up as if he didn&rsquo;t weigh anything at all, lifting\nhim right off the blanket and onto his lap and suddenly they were\nmuch closer than they\u2019d been before, mouths nearly meeting with each\nbreath, eyes wide as they stared from just a few inches\naway.</p><p>\nTony\nalmost bit through his lip when he settled firm onto the Alpha\u2019s\nthighs, rocking forward experimentally, <i>instinctively</i>, shuddering\nwhen he felt the Alpha&rsquo;s cock already hard beneath him.\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cOmega.\u201d\nSteve groaned over the welcome weight, palming over the tempting\ncurve of his mate&rsquo;s rear and feeling the way the yellow pants strained\ntight now that Tony&rsquo;s legs were open, knees spread on either side of\nSteve&rsquo;s waist. \u201cYou feel good.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cYou\nwant me.\u201d Tony whispered into his mate\u2019s ear, feeling the thick\nlength twitching against the underside of his thigh and hiding a secret, proud smile that he\u2019d brought his Alpha to such a state with so little effort. \u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cTell\nme&ndash;\u201d Even half drunk on Omega scent, Steve tried his damnedest to\nwait, to give his mate the time he&rsquo;d promised. \u201cDo you like\nmusic?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cI\nlove to sing.\u201d Being this close to his Alpha helped to settle the\n<i>wild </i>coursing through Tony&rsquo;s veins, the aggravating <i>empty </i>that seemed\nto grow worse the longer he wasn\u2019t with the Alpha\nthe way he needed to be. \u201cAnd play the piano. I can sing better\nthan I play though. What about you?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cMy\nma sings like an angel.\u201d Steve bent the Omega&rsquo;s back into a\ngraceful arch and suckled at his earlobe, tracing the shell with the\ntip of his tongue and blowing warm across the damp skin to make his\nmate shiver. \u201cBut I don\u2019t so much <i>sing </i>as I do yowl like a long\ntailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\nTony\nclapped a hand over his mouth to muffle his laughter, shoulders\nshaking and eyes sparkling with mirth. \u201cCharming.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cMy singing\nis entirely un-charming\u201d\n<i>God</i>, Steve loved the sound of his mate&rsquo;s laughter. \u201cBut I do love to\ndraw and one day after we\u2019re officially mated, I\u2019m going to lay\nyou out in the sunshine and draw every inch of your beautiful&ndash;\u201d he\nsighed when Tony wriggled closer. \u201c&ndash;<i>perfect</i>&ndash;\u201d dragging his\nfingers down Tony\u2019s back to smooth over his hips and the barest\ninch lower. \u201c&ndash;<i>gorgeous</i>&ndash;\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cWait.\u201d\nTony leaned away and put his hand over the Alpha\u2019s mouth before he\ncould finish. \u201cWait, wait before you say whatever you\u2019re going to say,\nI need&ndash;\u201d he paused, playing with the buttons on his blouse. \u201cI\nneed to show you something.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cAnything.\u201d\u00a0Steve\nsaid immediately, honestly. \u201cYou can tell me anything at all, my\nmate.\u201d</p><p>\nTony\nundid the garment slowly, not missing the way the Alpha\u2019s eyes\nwidened a little more at every bit of skin exposed but still\nhesitating before opening his shirt entirely to show Steve the mark\non his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s not scars, I wasn&rsquo;t hurt, it\u2019s just a birth\nmark. And I know it\u2019s ugly and I keep it hidden all the time but I\nthought\u2013 if you say you want to draw me you should know ahead of\ntime\u2013\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cWhoever\ntold you this was ugly?\u201d Steve\u2019s hand was so big it covered the\nbirthmark completely from edge to edge when he spread it over Tony\u2019s\nheart. \u201cWhy do you hide it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cWell,\nbecause it looks like\u2013\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cIt\nlooks like the stars themselves were jealous the night you were\nborn.\u201d Steve whispered. \u201cAnd fell from heaven to make their home\nhere on your heart so you would never outshine them.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cBut\nI\u2013\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cIt\nobviously didn\u2019t work.\u201d he continued, leaning in to touch a\nsoft kiss to the birthmark. \u201cYour eyes are brighter than star shine\nand your smile enough to shame the sun. You are perfect in every way,\nand having a piece of heaven on your heart just confirms it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cOh.\u201d\nTony brushed his fingers over Steve\u2019s jaw, swallowing when the\nAlpha turned his head into the touch. \u201cHave you\u2013 have you ever\nheard the story about the child born beneath star fall?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nSteve traced the lines of star burst curiously, the rough pads of his\nfingertips spreading goosebumps across Tony\u2019s skin. \u201cIs it a story I should know?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cIs\nthere a reason beyond wanderings you ended up here, close to the\nriver right now?\u201d Tony asked instead and a wrinkle of confusion crossed his\nAlpha&rsquo;s brow. \u201cBecause of a Prince coming of age or anything like\nthat?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cNo,\nsweetheart.\u201d Steve shook his head. \u201cNo, nothing like that. I\nheard there was a castle a few days ride from the river but I hadn&rsquo;t\ndecided to stop there yet. Why? What&rsquo;s the matter?\u201d \n</p><p>\n\u201cIt\ndoesn&rsquo;t matter right now.\u201d Tony decided, because some things were\nmore important than old stories and legends, things like the way\nSteve was staring at him with nothing but pure honesty and adoration,\nadmiration, and something that already looked an awful lot like <i>love</i>.\n\u201cKiss me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cYou\u2019re\nsure?\u201d Steve cupped Tony\u2019s jaw and stared deep into his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll be <i>lost</i>,\nOmega, do you know? I won\u2019t be able to kiss you and stop, I\u2019ll\nwant all of you. Every <i>bit </i>of you. We can wait. We can talk more if\nyou have more questions or we could just wrap up in a blanket so I\ncan hold you\u2013 sweetheart, I\u2019d love to just <i>hold\n</i>you\u2013\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cKiss\nme.\u201d Tony fit tighter into the Alpha\u2019s lap, wove his fingers into\nthe blond hair and tugged until the blue eyes slid dark red and\nwhispered, \u201cMy Alpha. <i>Mate</i>.\nKiss me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cYou&rsquo;re\nsure.\u201d Steve asked again, just one more time and this time when\nTony nodded Steve leaned in and pressed their mouths together in a\nchaste kiss. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of you, my love. I promise I will.\nWe&rsquo;ll learn how to do this together, hm?\u201d \n</p><p>\n\u201cTogether.\u201d\nTony repeated, and pursed his lips for another kiss, a <i>better </i>kiss\nthat his mate gave him readily, happily, with all the pent energy of\nan Alpha who had been waiting far too long.</p><p>\nAnd\nwhen Steve lay them out on the blanket, pinned his Omega to their bed\nand stretched out on top to kiss him breathless, everything <i>else\n</i>slipped away from Tony&ndash; the stress and the uncertainty, the worry of\nbeing caught by Sunset&rsquo;s men and the confusion over a prophecy he&rsquo;d\nalways thought was a fairy tale&ndash; \n</p><p>&ndash;It\nall slipped away until the only thing Tony knew was the taste of his\nmate, the feel of his Alpha, and the scent of wild flowers as they\nburst into bloom beneath the night sky. \n</p><p>******************</p><p>\nSteve\nwas too intent on listening to the pleased purr from his Omega to put\nany thought into why flowers were <i>blooming </i>all the sudden, but he did\nreach over and pluck one anyway, tucking it behind Tony&rsquo;s ear and\nkissing the pleased grin from his mate&rsquo;s mouth.</p><p>\n\u201cYou\nare incredible.\u201d he whispered, dipping past lovely lips to delve\ninto the warmth beneath, swallowing Tony&rsquo;s surprised moan with a\ngreedier noise of his own and sliding an arm under the trim waist to\nget the Omega right up into his body. They just weren&rsquo;t close enough,\nnot yet, not with clothes still on but <i>oh </i>it helped when Tony hitched\nan ankle around Steve&rsquo;s calf and canted his hips, rubbing against him\nlanguidly.</p><p>\n\u201cOmega.\u201d\nThe Alpha rumbled and Tony trilled something sweet and <i>wanting </i>into\nhis ear, following it up with a sharp dart of fangs that had Steve\nmaking a thoroughly undignified noise and Tony huffed a laugh when\nthe blonde tried to cover it with a sexier one.</p><p>\n\u201cCharming.\u201d\nHe teased and Steve licked a long line up his throat to growl,\n\u201c<i>Yours</i>.\u201d subsequently ruining anything else sassy Tony might have\nthought to say, the Omega simply looping his arms tight around his\nmate\u2019s neck and pulling him down for another and another and\nanother kiss because <i>yes yes yes</i> this Alpha was his.</p><p>\n\u201cCan\nI touch you here?\u201d The Alpha ran his hand the length of a lean\nthigh and up to the fastens of the yellow trousers. \u201cMy mate, can I\ntake these off?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\nTony\nnodded because he didn\u2019t think he could talk but Steve urged him, \u201cI need you to tell\nme yes or tell me no but I need to hear it, sweetheart need\nto know what you want. Just because our scents match doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m\ngoing to assume everything is a <i>yes</i>.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cCharming.\u201d\nTony said again, but this time he meant it, lifting his hips when the\nAlpha passed just lightly over the front of his pants, barely any\npressure at all over where his cock was straining against the cloth,\nstaining it damp because he <i>wanted </i>so badly.</p><p>\n\u201cI\nwant you.\u201d Tony keened over another pass of Steve&rsquo;s hand. \u201cAlpha\nAlpha please&ndash; please touch me&ndash; Yes, the answer is yes&ndash; it&rsquo;s <i>yes</i>&ndash;\u201d</p><p>\nIt\ntook all of Steve&rsquo;s self control to not rip the garment right in\nhalf, all of his self control to not lose his mind as he\npeeled the cloth down long legs and tossed it aside and he could\nfinally <i>properly </i>see every inch of the Omega meant to be his mate. \n</p><p>\nHe\ncould cover his Omega entirely with just one hand, the delicate\nlength flushed red and hard with a gentle curve Steve wanted to learn with his mouth and again with his lips and over and over with his fingers.</p><p>Tony cried out at the first real\ntouch, back arching and mouth falling open, sobbing something <i>pleading </i>when the Alpha stroked over him and he\nwas <i>soaked </i>between his thighs, slick mixing with warm vanilla and\nsharply scented cloves. Steve couldn&rsquo;t bear to take his hand away for several minutes, not with the way Tony writhed and gasped and arced\ninto every touch, but finally he couldn\u2019t fight the need to taste and he let go with a near regretful sigh, despite knowing what was waiting for him even lower.</p><p>\nTony\nwhimpered when Steve let go, but it slid into a gasp when the Alpha\nparted his knees and slid two fingers through the clear <i>wet</i>, sticking\nthem far in his mouth and groaning as though he were <i>starving</i>. \n</p><p>\n\u201cYou\ntaste like&ndash;\u201d Steve didn&rsquo;t have words, there were <i>no words</i> that\nwould suffice, but he went back for more, three fingers this\ntime and used it to ease the way up Tony&rsquo;s cock, bending low to kiss\nhim and loving ever desperate pant and needy whine from his\nOmega, murmuring quiet, <i>filthy </i>encouragement when Tony thrust up into\nhis palm.</p><p>\n\u201cI\nthink I might die if I can&rsquo;t feel you.\u201d Tony begged. \u201cAlpha, my\nmate, I need&ndash; please please please&ndash;\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI&rsquo;m\nhere, I&rsquo;m right here.\u201d Steve didn&rsquo;t let go of Tony but sat back\nonto his heels and guided the Omega&rsquo;s small hand to the front of his\ntrousers, his head falling back at the first tentative touch. \u201c<i>Yes\n</i>my Omega, right there&ndash;\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYou&rsquo;re\nso big.\u201d Tony choked out. \u201cChrist, how will you fit inside me?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI&rsquo;ll\nfit.\u201d Steve undid his buttons and lifted his cock free, slotting it\nnext to Tony&rsquo;s and reveling in the openly <i>shocked </i>noise that came\nfrom his mate, the fresh pass of slick that filled the air. \u201cI&rsquo;ll\nbe slow and I&rsquo;ll be so gentle, I&rsquo;ll be so gentle with you my love and\nif you don&rsquo;t like it, if you don&rsquo;t like me inside&ndash;\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cGod, how could I <i>not</i>&ndash;\u201d Tony raked his nails down the Alpha&rsquo;s back to grab\nhim closer, rocking up impatiently.</p><p>\n\u201c&ndash;but\nif you <i>do</i>, if you hate the feel of me inside you, I&rsquo;ll stop. We&rsquo;ll\nstop and I&rsquo;ll hold you and we&rsquo;ll sleep because it won&rsquo;t change a\nthing.\u201d Steve swore. \u201cIt won&rsquo;t change a thing between us, you are\nmy mate and we have <i>time</i>&ndash;\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI\ndon&rsquo;t want time though.\u201d Tony crushed their mouths together, not\nletting up until his Alpha was growling against his lips, rocking\ninto him insistently. \u201cI don&rsquo;t want time, I want you now. <i>Please</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m yours.\u201d Steve slid his hand over\nthat lovely rear, down into the cleft between well rounded cheeks,\nlower and <i>lower </i>until his fingers found the tightly furled entrance\ndripping with slick, the muscle relaxing at the first experimental\npress of his finger. \u201cYou have me, no matter what. I&rsquo;m yours, your\nmate, Omega.\u201d \n</p><p>\u201cMine.\u201d Glee so potent it was nearly\n<i>giddy </i>had a pleased smile creasing Tony&rsquo;s face, lighting his eyes\nup and rippling sweet through his scent. <i>He&rsquo;d never had anything that\nwas just his</i>. \u201cMy mate, my very own Prince Charming.\u201d \n</p><p>\u201c<i>Yours</i>.\u201d</p><p>\nTony\nwas tight and so <i>so </i>hot inside when Steve opened him around one\nfinger, but greedy, so greedy, bearing down on the intrusion and almost immediate rocking\nup in an obvious, anxious ask for another.</p><p>\n\u201cMore,\nmy love?\u201d \n</p><p>\u201cYes.\n<i>Yes </i>more, I didn&rsquo;t know I needed&ndash; Alpha&ndash;\u201d</p><p>\nSteve\ncould already feel his rut descending, his vision sharpening and\nnarrowing until all he could see was the whiskey and gold of his\nmate&rsquo;s eyes and the glint off the perfect little fangs. Tony&rsquo;s \nlittle cry at the feel of two fingers made Steve want to roar, the\nway the Omega clung to him, scratching his nails down Steve&rsquo;s chest\nand around to his side, canting his hips up and rolling his body to\ndrag them deeper.</p><p>\n\u201cYou&rsquo;re\nso small.\u201d Steve was suddenly terrified at how tight Tony\nfelt even around two fingers, thinking there was no way for his\nlittle mate to ever be able to take all of him. \u201cI&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ll\nbreak you.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI\nwon&rsquo;t break.\u201d The words cracked over a shaky sigh at\nthe stretch of three. \u201cYou won&rsquo;t break me, we&rsquo;re made for each\nother. <i>Mates</i>.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cMates.\u201d\nSteve repeated, leaning far over and sealing their lips together,\nexploring Tony&rsquo;s mouth in hungry licks and little nibbles. \u201cMy\nmate. <i>Mine</i>. Precious, beautiful. You\u2019re perfect. I\u2019ve waited my whole life to find you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Steve kept whispering sweet things, praising his mate even as he used\nthe slick of Tony&rsquo;s body to stroke down his cock, lining the blunt\nhead up with Tony\u2019s entrance. \u201cSweetheart, darling thing, are you ready for me?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYes\nyes yes yes.\u201d</p><p>\nThe\nfirst push was <i>agonizing</i>, a burn so sharp it was nearly painful and\nTony turned his face away so Steve wouldn&rsquo;t see the tears in his\neyes. The Alpha was huge, nearly massive and Tony thought he might split in two with the effort, even with the care and time and preparation Steve had taken.\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cTell\nme to stop.\u201d The Alpha said raggedly, stilling at once and bringing Tony back to kiss the tears away. \u201cMy love, tell me to stop and I will.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cDon&rsquo;t\nstop.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cOmega&ndash;\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cDon&rsquo;t\nstop.\u201d It was already better, the burn settling into a low throb in\nTony\u2019s core, the empty that had been soothed by Steve&rsquo;s presence earlier\nreappearing pained enough to make him cry out. \u201cPlease, my Alpha, I want&ndash; I\nneed&ndash;\u201d</p><p><i>\nPressure\npressure pressure</i>, hot and tight and the Alpha gritted his teeth to\nkeep himself slow, unable to tear his eyes away from where so much\nof himself was disappearing into Tony, where his mate was opening around him until their hips finally met\nand he was all the way through, buried to the hilt and already\nwishing he had <i>more </i>because it just wasn&rsquo;t enough yet. \n</p><p><i>They weren\u2019t together enough yet.</i></p><p>\u201cOh\ngod.\u201d Tony&rsquo;s eyes were wide open, staring almost unseeingly at the\nstars above. \u201cOh m-my god.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cSweetheart? Alright?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI&rsquo;m\nso full.\u201d Tony reached down between their bodies and slid his\nfingers along where they were connected, ripping a moan from his\nAlpha.\u201d Oh god I&rsquo;m so <i>full</i>, you&rsquo;re so big and I\u2019m so&ndash;\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Steve\nmoved just the barest bit, nothing more than an inch away and then\nback again and Tony tossed his head back and shouted loud enough to\ncover Steve&rsquo;s answering growl.</p><p>\n\u201cYes\nOmega,\u201d he praised, dotting kisses along Tony&rsquo;s face and jaw,\nwiping away the last stray tear and <i>melting </i>over the sweet purr Tony\ngave him in return. \u201cYes sweetheart, you are perfect.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201c<i>Again</i>.\u201d</p><p>\nSteve\nwithdrew further this time, until Tony was whining and arching his\nback and scrabbling at his sides to bring him back and then he sank\nin in one smooth stroke, filling his mate completely.</p><p>\n\u201c<i>Again</i>.\u201d\n\n</p><p>Steve\nnudged Tony&rsquo;s knees up to make more room between the lean thighs, propping himself up on one arm so the other hand was free to wander.\nHe thrust into Tony slowly, steadily, rolling his hips in a lazy sort\nof fashion that had him bottoming out on every stroke before lifting\nfree again. With his other hand he explored the lines of star light\non Tony&rsquo;s chest, smoothed away curls from his mates forehead and\nrubbed soothing circles over the bare bonding spot.</p><p>\nTony\nlinked their fingers together and Steve stretched his mates arms out\nabove his head, pinning them to the blankets and admiring the lines \nof his Omega\u2019s body, learning the arc of his back and the span of each\nbreath, the hollow of Tony\u2019s throat and the dip of his navel and when\nTony&rsquo;s breath caught over a particularly good push deep in his core,\nSteve shifted back to try and find that spot again, the one that made\nhis mates eyes flash and body tighten and \u2013</p><p><i>\nThere</i>.\nTony gave a needy little sob and Steve rumbled something <i>amazed </i>because he&rsquo;d never seen an Omega like this before, never could have\n<i>imagined </i>an Omega like this, spread open and wanting as he took Steve deeper with every push,\ngasping for his Alpha and demanding <i>more</i>, flushing beautifully up over his chest and into his cheeks as Steve drove into the same spot over and over\nuntil the Omega was a trembling mess beneath him.</p><p>\n\u201cDo\nyou want all of me?\u201d Steve grasped at a narrow hip\nand thrust <i>harder </i>now as his knot started to swell, the edge of it\ncatching the rim of Tony&rsquo;s entrance and making both Alpha and Omega stammer through each stroke, breath stuttering with every tug. \u201cCan I knot you, my mate?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201c<i>Yes</i>.\u201d\nTony moaned, nearly coming off the blanket as the swelling knot\ncaught for a split second before giving again. \u201cYes, yes I want all\nof you, my mate, <i>mine</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Mine</i>.\u201d\nSteve repeated, voice nothing more than a growl as he got closer\nto his release, leaning back over Tony&rsquo;s body to pull over his cock\nwith sure strokes, mindful to keep the maddening rhythm deep inside\nTony&rsquo;s center just <i>right </i>to have his Omega hovering on the edge.\n\u201cYou are <i>mine</i>, Omega.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cAlpha.\u201d\nTony\u2019s cries of satisfaction slid towards frustration, his legs wrapping around Steve\u2019s waist as he tried to lift into each thrust, trying to get the Alpha deeper or fuller&ndash; he didn\u2019t know exactly what he needed but he knew his Alpha wasn\u2019t giving him <i>enough </i>yet. \u201cI can&rsquo;t&ndash; I\nneed more, give me more&ndash;\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI&rsquo;ve\ngot you, lovely\u201d Steve&rsquo;s knot was catching every stroke now, stuck\ninside the Omega&rsquo;s sweet body for a little longer each time before\ngiving free and with a snarl of impatience, Steve pinned Tony to the\nblanket, ground their hips together until his knot swelled full size\nand locked tight.</p><p>\n\u201cAlpha!\u201d That was all it took, the heavy weight of a full knot, and Tony <i>screamed </i>his release into the night air, cock spilling white all\nover his stomach and Steve&rsquo;s fist, pooling in his navel and dripping off his sides into the blankets, his center tightening, tensing, clenching down around the Alpha.\u00a0</p><p>He was still lost in white hot rapture when Steve surged forward and sank his teeth in over Tony\u2019s bonding mark, fangs puncturing clear skin and pouring pheromone laced blood into the Alpha\u2019s mouth.\u00a0</p><p>Tony cried out again, pure joy and sweet satisfaction and the Alpha groaned in response, cock swelling impossibly bigger for a few seconds before he was losing himself as well, pouring wet inside his Omega,\nrutting through each pulse and letting a possessive growl vibrate\nthrough his chest and into his mate.</p><p>\nTony\nshuddered through another peak before the first had even fully\nfinished, his body shattering apart around mind blanking and\nleaving him barely lucid, barely breathing as the Alpha rocked\nthrough the last few waves.</p><p>\n\u201cMy\nmate.\u201d Steve&rsquo;s voice was still little more than a growl as he\nunlocked his jaw and licked gently over the sluggishly bleeding bite mark.\n\u201cMy mate, my Omega&ndash;\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cMmm,\nmy <i>mate</i>.\u201d Tony whispered tiredly, carding his fingers through\nSteve&rsquo;s hair and bringing him down for a long kiss, shivering over\nthe lingering taste of himself on the Alpha&rsquo;s lips, the iron tinge of\nblood on the hooked fangs.</p><p>\n\u201cYou\nare perfect.\u201d Steve told him. \u201cBeautiful. Made for me. That was\nincredible. Waited my whole life for this moment with you, star\nshine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStar\nshine?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cStar\nshine.\u201d Steve spread his hand over the mark on Tony&rsquo;s chest, then\nslid it up to the bite mark and captured his mate&rsquo;s lips in another\nkiss. \u201cI know the bond won&rsquo;t take fully yet, not without you being in heat but\noh <i>my love</i>&ndash;\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nknow.\u201d Tony pushed their foreheads together and purred shakily as\nhis body lit up from the pressure at his mark. \u201cI know. Won\u2019t take yet but it still feels good, it feels good, you feel<i> so good</i>&ndash;\u201d He lifted his hips\nand moaned as the knot tugged at him. \u201cI heard it would be like\nthis, but I didn&rsquo;t <i>really </i>know. Not until right now.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cCome\nhere.\u201d Steve cradled Tony close to his chest and rolled carefully\nso the Omega wouldn&rsquo;t be crushed under his weight, feeling around for\nthe blanket and dragging it up and over Tony&rsquo;s shoulders. \u201cDon&rsquo;t\nwant the stars to be jealous of your beauty.\u201d he teased and Tony\ntucked his head into Steve&rsquo;s chest to hide his blush, wondering how he could even still blush after what they had just shared.</p><p>\n\u201cCharming.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWell, that&rsquo;s\nwhat they say.\u201d Steve held him close, smoothing his hands up and\ndown Tony&rsquo;s back as they waited for the shivers to calm, breathing in\nthe floral scented air and letting his eyes fall closed. \u201cAre you\nmine, Omega?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYours.\u201d\nTony curled tight over the Alpha&rsquo;s heartbeat. \u201cAlpha.\u201d</p><p>\n******************</p><p>\nSteve\nwas adamant about cleaning Tony up, wrapping his little mate in\nthe blanket despite the warm night air and stepping back into his\npants to pour some water over a rag. He wiped carefully between\nTony&rsquo;s legs, crooned sweetly at the lingering blush on Tony&rsquo;s cheeks and rubbed his cheek on the soft belly, leaving a gentle kiss at the base of\nhis cock.</p><p>\n\u201cBeautiful.\u201d\nhe sighed and Tony tugged the Alpha back onto the bed, rolling\nover so his rear was tucked into Steve&rsquo;s hips, the Alpha able to lick\nand nuzzle at the bite mark as he wanted.</p><p>\n\u201cThere&rsquo;s\na lot we need to talk about.\u201d He said after a long time, after his\nheart had settled and body had cooled and everything <i>real life</i> started to sink\nback in.</p><p>\n\u201cI\nknow.\u201d Steve assured him, rubbing slow circles on Tony&rsquo;s stomach.\n\u201cWe need to know more than each others favorite foods and colors to\nmake this work. I have to prove to you I&rsquo;m not a scent drunk Alpha\nand that we are <i>really </i>mates. I know.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cBut\nthere&rsquo;s a lot of things you need to know about&ndash;\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cTony.\u201d\nSteve propped up on his elbow, cupping Tony&rsquo;s jaw and laying a gentle\nkiss on his lips. \u201cWe have forever to talk about it all. No rush.\nNo hurry. I&rsquo;m not going anywhere. I&rsquo;m completely under your spell.\u201d</p><p>\nExhausted,\nthe Alpha collapsed back onto the bedroll and was asleep within a few minutes, secure and content with his arms tight around his newly found\nmate.</p><p>\nTony\nlay awake in his Alpha&rsquo;s arms for another hour, wondering if Steve&rsquo;s\ncomment about a spell had just been the Alpha being sweet or if\nSunset&rsquo;s spell from the day before was still lingering, influencing\nSteve&rsquo;s actions and elevating levels of devotion that wouldn&rsquo;t exist\nwhen the sun rose again.</p><p>\nEverything\nelse in his life was the result of magic, of a witch&rsquo;s power, of a\ncurse set in place before he was born, what\nif his mate was the same?</p><p><i>\n&hellip;What\nif this wasn&rsquo;t real at all?</i></p><p>\n*******************</p><p>\nSteve\nwoke to the morning sun, stretching and smiling and reaching out for\nhis Omega, fully intent on burying his nose and his teeth in the\nOmega&rsquo;s throat to re-stake his claim and burying his cock inside that\nperfect body because he&rsquo;d <i>dreamed </i>all night about his mate, dreamed\nabout the way Tony opened so sweetly for him, the way the whiskey and\ngold eyes sparked so bright when his Omega <i>wanted</i>.</p><p>But\nSteve frowned when he went to move and his arm didn&rsquo;t come along, his\neyes widening when he realized he&rsquo;d been tied quite thoroughly to one\nof the trees.</p><p>\n\u201cTony?\u201d\nHe sat up awkwardly, shifting to take the strain off his shoulder and\nsquinting over at the Omega on the other side of the now cold fire.\n\u201cSweetheart, what is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m\nsorry.\u201d Tony was already fully dressed, his coat wrapped around\nhim. \u201cMy Alpha, I&ndash; there&rsquo;s things you don&rsquo;t know about me.\nImportant things that I was stupid enough to forget about last night\nbut now&ndash;\u201d<br/></p><p>\n\u201cTony?\u201d\nThe Alpha tried the knot but it held firm and he swiveled back to his\nmate. \u201cWhat&rsquo;s going on?\u201d \n</p><p>\u201cLast\nnight, you said you were completely under my spell.\u201d Tony&rsquo;s eyes\nwere dull this morning, dull and distant and Steve hated it. \u201cWere\nyou just being charming, or did you say it because it&rsquo;s true? What\nhappened last night, was it real or was it magic?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat\nare you talking about&ndash;\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m\ncursed.\u201d Tony blurted. \u201cThere&rsquo;s a prophecy that has to do with my\nbirth mark and why my parents died and I can&rsquo;t tell you much more\nthan that right now because I don&rsquo;t <i>understand</i>\nmuch more than that, but until I know if this is real&ndash;\u201d tears were\nfalling down his cheeks. \u201c&ndash;until I know what the prophecy means\nfor me and for my life, I can&rsquo;t stay here with you.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d\nSteve strained at the ropes again but the knots held. \u201cNo, Tony. I\ndon&rsquo;t care about any of that. I don&rsquo;t care about prophecies or\nsecrets or anything&ndash; this isn&rsquo;t magic sweetheart, this is true love,\ntrue mates, we are <i>made </i>for each other&ndash;\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI\ndon&rsquo;t know that for sure.\u201d<br/></p><p>Steve\njerked as if he was slapped, and Tony made a wounded noise as well.\n\u201cSo everything last night&ndash; you didn&rsquo;t mean it?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI\nmeant every word.\u201d Tony whispered. \u201cOh god, I meant I every word.\nI <i>did</i>. Last night was amazing, and no matter what happens I will\nnever&ndash;\u201d he put his hand at his neck. \u201cEven if this was magic and\nwasn&rsquo;t real and you forget about me by sundown tonight, I will never\nforget you, Steve, my mate. My Alpha. Even if it isn&rsquo;t real for you\nbecause of some stupid spell, I <i>promise </i>it&rsquo;s real for me.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI don&rsquo;t\nunderstand.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI\nhave a responsibility to figure this all out.\u201d Tony said woodenly.\n\u201cI have to understand what my life is supposed to mean and I&rsquo;m\nsorry I wasn&rsquo;t strong enough to say no last night, I&rsquo;m sorry I\ndragged you into this but if you can forgive me&ndash;\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cMy\nmate, there is nothing to forgive. Make me understand and we will\nfigure it out&ndash;\u201d</p><p>\n\u201c&ndash;and\nif you can wait for me&ndash;\u201d Tony dug his fingers into his thighs so\nhe wouldn&rsquo;t throw himself at the Alpha. \u201c&ndash;One day when this is\nover, we can try again. See if we&rsquo;re actually mates.\u201d \n</p><p>\u201cWe\n<i>are </i>mates.\u201d Steve&rsquo;s eyes snapped red, his strength <i>surging </i>but\nJarvis had taught Tony well and the rope held tight. \u201cWe <i>are </i>mates,\nTony. There is no magic, there is no spell. I&rsquo;m yours and you&rsquo;re mine\nand that&rsquo;s all there is to it.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cEveryone\nwho has gotten involved in my life has ended up dead or at least in\ndanger.\u201d Tony said quietly. \u201cAnd I&rsquo;d rather lose you like this\nthan lose you to a witch and a quest for revenge.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cMake\nme understand and I&rsquo;ll save you.\u201d Steve was begging now, his heart\nvisibly \u00a0breaking. \u201cSweetheart? Please. I&rsquo;ll save you. I will. I&rsquo;m\nnot scared of witches or magic or spells or anything like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy\nPrince Charming, of course you want to save me.\u201d Tony backed towards his horse and climbed into\nthe saddle. \u201cI&rsquo;m so sorry. I&rsquo;m so so sorry. The knot unwinds first backwards and then again forward, I tied a piece of red twine around the end so you\u2019ll know how to undo it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTony?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTONY!\u201d\n\n</p><p>Tears\npouring down his face, Tony spurred the horse on into the woods at a\nflat our run, purposefully heading away from the river so Steve\nwouldn&rsquo;t know where he had gone, planning to double back and cross\nlater.<br/></p><p>Every\nhoof beat that took him further from his Alpha felt like a blow to\nhis body, his heart seizing in his chest and jolting pain through his soul but Tony never looked back, never stopped, thundering through\nthe woods towards an uncertain future.</p><p>\nAn anguished howl broke through the trees a moment later, the\nsound of an Alpha who had lost his mate and didn&rsquo;t know <i>why</i>, and all\nat once the flowers that had bloomed in the show of their love,\nwithered and fell away.\u00a0</p><p>And trailing along behind the horse, <i>frost </i>creeping back along the ground.</p><p>*************************</p><p><b><a

We only have tonight one\ntime, only one time for our very first time and I don\u2019t want to miss\na single second of it.\u201d Tony\u2019s coat had fallen open while they\u2019d\nscented each other and now the Alpha gathered it up again, buttoning it closed against the night air. \u201cI suppose\nthat\u2019s old fashioned but\u2013\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI\nthink it\u2019s charming.\u201d Tony couldn\u2019t help his smile, and it\nstretched further when streaks of pink highlighted his Alpha\u2019s\ncheekbones. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cThank\nyou?\u201d Steve echoed, the pine rich scent blurring with embarrassment\nin a way that made the Omega want to croon in open adoration, the\nsweet Alpha <i>embarrassed </i>at being old fashioned. \u201cWhy thank you?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2019ve\nbeen so lost in\u2013\u201d Tony motioned between their bodies, flushing as he shifted on the blankets and realized\nhe was wet just from being scented, just from being close to the\nAlpha that was meant to be his mate. \u201c\u2013I forgot to even be\nnervous.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYou\ndon\u2019t have to be nervous with me.\u201d Steve told him, gaze dropping to\nthe long legs wrapped in yellow trousers, knowing full well why his\nOmega had suddenly blushed and re-positioned and the knowledge made\nhis mouth <i>water</i>, made him throb in his pants. \u201cMy love, I would\nnever do anything\u2013\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cIt\u2019s\nmy first time.\u201d Tony was calmer than he\u2019d thought he\u2019d be saying\nsomething like this, running his tongue absentmindedly over his fangs\nand reveling in the sudden urge to sink them into the Prince\u2019s neck\nto claim the handsome Alpha as his own. \u201cMy <i>very </i>first time. I\u2019ve\nnever had an Alpha at all, I\u2019ve never wanted an Alpha before meeting\nyou and now I\u2013\u201d his smile was more than a hint eager. \u201c\u2013I\nforgot to be nervous about it.

You\u2019re my first, Tony.\u201d he picked\nup the Omega\u2019s hand and laced their fingers together, laying them first at\nthe bonding spot at the base of his neck, then down to rest over his\nheart.\u00a0\u201cAnd you\u2019ll be my only.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Alpha</i>.\u201d\nTony breathed and Steve rumbled something indecipherable in return,\npressing at Tony\u2019s hand. \u201cYour only?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cMy\nonly.\u201d Steve confirmed, looking as it physically pained him to\nstand up and move back to the other side of the fire. \u201cAnd you\ndeserve better than an Alpha who kisses you once and is lost in a rut\nthe rest of the night, so let\u2019s wait. Just a bit. Is that alright?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cWell\nthen what should we do?\u201d Tony never took his eyes off the Prince,\nwondering at the <i>sincerity </i>that shone from astonishingly blue eyes.\n\u201cIf you aren\u2019t going to kiss me\u2013\u201d</p><p>\n\u201c<i>Yet</i>.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201c\u2013yet.\u201d\nhe amended, his core clenching tight in anticipation. \u201cIf you\naren\u2019t going to kiss me yet. What should we do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell\nme everything about you, Tony. I want to know it all.\u201d\u00a0Steve\nbusied himself retrieving more blankets from his horse\u2019s pack,\nspreading them out in the grass between himself and the Omega with\nclear intention. \u201cI know you\u2019ve never had an Alpha, but I want to\nknow\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid\nyou know that before I told you?\u201d Tony interrupted and Steve paused\nin the bed making to nod. \u201cHow? <i>How </i>did you know?\u201d</p><p>Most\nAlphas probably would have been cocky about this sort of thing,\nbut Steve sounded almost humbled as he explained, \u201cYou scent\n<i>innocent</i>, Tony. You scent like innocent and you scent like <i>mine</i>.\nThat\u2019s how I knew.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201c\u2026I\nscent like <i>yours</i>?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cLike\nvanilla.\u201d Steve let <i>possessive </i>roll through his words simply to\nwatch his mate catch his bottom lip with the edge of his darling\nfangs. \u201cVanilla and honey and spicy like cloves and like every\nthing that\u2019s mine. It\u2019s perfect. <i>You\u2019re </i>perfect. Waited my whole\nlife to find someone who scented the way you do.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cYour\nwhole life.\u201d Tony hugged his knees to his chest, peering over at\nhis apparent mate from beneath his lashes and trilling in quiet\npleasure over hearing such devotion from his Alpha. \u201cAnd how many\nyears would that be exactly?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cTwenty\nnine.\u201d Steve tore himself away from the hypnotizing gold in the\nOmega\u2019s eyes and went back to the saddle bags for more blankets. \u201cI\nturn thirty in the spring, and then I\u2019ll have to stop wandering and\nactually return home to take over the throne.\u201d He cocked his head\nand amended, \u201c<i>We </i>will have to return home, I suppose. Unless you\nhave your heart set on staying here? Do you live close to here or are\nyou traveling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\ntraveling.\u201d Tony didn\u2019t want to lie to his Alpha\u2013 he\u2019d always been\na terrible liar the few times he\u2019d attempted it anyway, and he\ncertainly didn\u2019t want to lie now, not when his Prince was being so\nhonest. \u201cBut not too far. Just a few days from home is all. Why did\nyou take off wandering?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause\nthere isn\u2019t an Alpha in the world with enough common sense to take a\nthrone at twenty one.\u201d Steve informed him, and Tony muffled a\ngiggle into his hand. \u201cI wasn\u2019t ready to rule and there was an\nentire world out there to see and my best friend\u2013\u201d</p><p>For\nthe first time, the Alpha\u2019s smile faltered and dimmed. \u201cMy best\nfriend went off to find fortune and fame as a knight when he came of\nage. I was only twenty at the time, so I couldn\u2019t go. And by the time\nI was ready to come and join him\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlpha?\u201d\nTony whispered when the broad shoulders sagged in remembered grief.\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d \n</p><p>\u201cThe\nlast letter from him came from a spot of war on this continent.\u201d\nSteve cleared his throat and went back to unpacking, laying out\nanother blanket for them to lie on. \u201cSo my parents gave me Nomad as\na coming of age present and I set off across the sea to find him.\u201d</p><p><i>I never did find him</i> went unspoken in the air and Tony felt his heart break a little for his mate.\u00a0\u201cEight\nyears you\u2019ve been looking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEight\nyears I\u2019ve been <i>wandering</i>.\u201d Steve corrected without looking away from the blankets. \u201cI\nhoped I would find him of course, but the continents been involved in\nwar for so long and so many soldiers have fallen, I know I never\nwill.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo\nyou stayed wandering to find your own adventure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nstayed wandering to find my own adventure.\u201d Steve agreed, then\nundid the clasp of his wine skin and offered it to Tony, mustering up a smile when\ntheir hands brushed. \u201cAnd what an adventure I found, hm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nsorry about your friend.\u201d Tony took a sip of the wine and hummed\nagreeably when he found the taste to his liking. \u201cBut not sorry you\nended up here. Is that alright to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d\nSteve said warmly, then sat himself down on the far edge of the pile\nof blankets, motioning to the other side for Tony to sit as well. \u201cNo\nreason for you to sit way over there, sweetheart, at least come sit\nsome where comfortable.\u201d</p><p>Tony\nbrought the blanket he\u2019d been sitting on to roll up as a pillow and\npropped it behind his back, sitting cross legged\u2013 and not close\nenough to his Alpha as \u00a0far as he was concerned\u2013 and clasping his\nhands in his lap.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s\nyour best friends name?\u201d Steve took the wine back for a drink and\nset it aside, mirroring Tony\u2019s position on their bed. \u201cAnd how long\nhave you known them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy\nbest friend\u2013\u201d Tony started to answer, then frowned. \u201cYou know, I\ndon\u2019t have a best friend. No one other than Jarvis, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s\nJarvis?\u201d Steve prompted, inching just a tiny bit closer and\nthrilling clear to his <i>soul </i>when the Omega budged closer as well,\nrelieved his mate felt the same urge to be near.</p><p>\u201cJarvis\nis the Beta that raised me, along with his mate Ana. My parents\u2013\u201d\n<i>were murdered.</i> \u201c\u2013passed when I was young and they took me in. Tell\nme about where you live?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cOur\ncastle is on\na cliff overlooking the sea.\u201d Steve\u2019s fingers itched with the need\nto erase the hint of sadness in the Omega\u2019s eyes. \u201cThere are gardens behind\nthe castle, and I can climb down the cliffs to the beach below and\nswim in the waves. Fishing too, do you like to fish?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2019ve\nnever tried.\u201d Tony answered truthfully. \u201cMy home is\u2013\u201d <i>Dark.\nCursed. Not home at all anymore.</i>\u00a0\u201c\u2013surrounded by forest on all\nsides and very few plants or flowers grow. The river here is the\nclosest I am to ever seeing water.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll\nlove our castle.\u201d Steve decided. \u201cIt\u2019s where my parents fell in\nlove, right there on the beach. My dad knew my ma was the perfect\nOmega for him, so he went running down the sands one day and scooped\nher up into his arms ready to make a proclamation of love and intent\nto bond. My ma was so startled at being snatched up by an Alpha, she flailed around and smacked the hell out of him and he dropped her\nright in the waves, right on the rocks and bruised her ribs all up.\u201d</p><p>\nTony\nburst into horrified laughter and Steve laughed too. \u201cHe picked her\nup off the rocks and informer her that she was his mate. Ma said \u2018the\nhell I am\u2019 and stomped away. Made him chase for her almost a year\nbefore she so much as let him close enough to scent her again.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cSo\nyou <i>don\u2019t </i>get your charm from your father, then?\u201d Tony hazarded a guess and\nthe Alpha laughed even louder. \u201cBut\nthey <i>were </i>mates, weren\u2019t they? And she would have known right away\ntoo, so why did she make him wait?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cBecause\nma wanted to know he wasn\u2019t just scent stupid and looking for an\nOmega to rut on.\u201d Steve took another sip from the wine and passed\nit over again. \u201cForgive my crudeness, what I meant to say is\u2013\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cHe\nwas looking for a warm spot to bury his knot and she was the closest\nthing that didn\u2019t stink?\u201d Tony finished and the Alpha barked a\ndelighted laugh at the impish grin the Omega sent his way. \u201cI was\nraised by Betas who have very little tolerance for Alphas and\ntheir antics. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve heard all sorts of things about\nyour lot.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cAll\nterrible, I\u2019m sure.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cOh\nI don\u2019t know.\u201d Tony let his gaze drift appreciatively over\nSteve\u2019s frame. \u201cI\u2019m starting to think Alpha\u2019s aren\u2019t <i>all\n</i>bad.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\nSteve\npreened under the attention from the lovely brunette, rolling his\nshoulders and letting the seams of his coat pull tight over his arms\nso Tony would keep looking, but he readied another question to turn the conversation back around to getting to know each other,\nnot willing to get too distracted by\u2013</p><p>\n\u201cTake\nyour coat off.\u201d The Omega demanded in a sort of whisper the Alpha had only ever <i>dreamed </i>about hearing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s warm enough, isn\u2019t it? I\u2019d like to see you, if you don\u2019t\nmind.\u201d</p><p>\nIt\nwas warm by the fire, almost unnaturally so, the usual freezing\ntemperatures of the winter night seeming not to exist in the circle\nof their clearing and Steve suddenly realized he was sweating\nunder the long jacket.</p><p>And it\ndidn\u2019t matter if he was sweating from the unexpected warmth of the\nwinter night or if he was sweating because his Omega had been bold\nenough to ask to see him\u2013 either way Steve stood and stripped the coat\naway without a seconds hesitation, letting it fall carelessly onto\nthe ground.</p><p>\n\u201cBetter?\u201d\nHe barely managed to get the words out over the <i>shine </i>in his mate\u2019s\neyes, the fire reflecting onto Tony\u2019s face and turning the deep brown\na rich whiskey color. \u201cOmega?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cMuch.\u201d\nTony didn\u2019t bother making an effort not to stare, licking his lips as he looked the Alpha over, admiring\nthe cut of fitted trousers over Steve\u2019s thighs and the way his waist\nlooked so small compared to the breadth of his shoulders. \u201c\u2026thank\nyou.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cAre\nyou warm too, my love?\u201d Steve asked hoarsely, his hands clenching\nat his sides as if restraining himself from reaching out. \u201cCould\nyou\u2013 your jacket as well?\u201d</p><p>Tony wanted to tease about how just a bit\nearlier the Alpha had given him a blanket to cover up with, but Steve\ngave an urgent, <i>coaxing </i>growl and Tony just nodded instead, shrugging\nout of his jacket and pushing it away.</p><p>\u201cMy favorite color\u2019s blue.\u201d Steve said\nthen, loving the way the silk clung to his mate\u2019s collarbone, the\nlace on the hems that gave peeks at skin beneath. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful\nin it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d The Omega looked so pleased\nby the compliment Steve wondered for a moment if Tony had never been\npraised before but that\u2013 <i>that </i>couldn\u2019t be true. His mate was breathtaking, stunning in a way that was nearly ethereal, gorgeous even\njust sitting there in a torn shirt and\u2013</p><p><i>A torn shirt?</i></p><p>\n\u201cIs\nthat a <i>bruise </i>on your wrist?\u201d The light moment was banished\nabruptly by an angry snarl from the Alpha, Steve all but leaping\nacross the blankets to snatch at Tony\u2019s wrist, the one he hadn\u2019t\nseen before when Tony had been wearing his coat. \u201cMy Omega, did\nsomeone hurt you?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh\nit\u2019s\u2013\u201d Tony tugged at his shirt sleeve half-heartedly. \u201cIt\u2019s\nnothing. I\u2019m fine. It was a misunderstanding between myself and\nanother Alpha\u2013\u201d he jumped when Steve snarled again and softened\nhis voice to add, \u201c\u2013but we were separated immediately and I never\nsaw him again.

Would you hold me a tighter? Closer?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cOh.\u201d\nThe blue eyes flared red for a second before the Alpha got himself\nunder control. \u201cYes sweetheart, come here.

What about you?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cMy\nma sings like an angel.\u201d Steve bent the Omega\u2019s back into a\ngraceful arch and suckled at his earlobe, tracing the shell with the\ntip of his tongue and blowing warm across the damp skin to make his\nmate shiver. \u201cBut I don\u2019t so much <i>sing </i>as I do yowl like a long\ntailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\nTony\nclapped a hand over his mouth to muffle his laughter, shoulders\nshaking and eyes sparkling with mirth. \u201cCharming.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cMy singing\nis entirely un-charming\u201d\n<i>God</i>, Steve loved the sound of his mate\u2019s laughter. \u201cBut I do love to\ndraw and one day after we\u2019re officially mated, I\u2019m going to lay\nyou out in the sunshine and draw every inch of your beautiful\u2013\u201d he\nsighed when Tony wriggled closer. \u201c\u2013<i>perfect</i>\u2013\u201d dragging his\nfingers down Tony\u2019s back to smooth over his hips and the barest\ninch lower. \u201c\u2013<i>gorgeous</i>\u2013\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cWait.\u201d\nTony leaned away and put his hand over the Alpha\u2019s mouth before he\ncould finish. \u201cWait, wait before you say whatever you\u2019re going to say,\nI need\u2013\u201d he paused, playing with the buttons on his blouse. \u201cI\nneed to show you something.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cAnything.\u201d\u00a0Steve\nsaid immediately, honestly. \u201cYou can tell me anything at all, my\nmate.\u201d</p><p>\nTony\nundid the garment slowly, not missing the way the Alpha\u2019s eyes\nwidened a little more at every bit of skin exposed but still\nhesitating before opening his shirt entirely to show Steve the mark\non his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s not scars, I wasn\u2019t hurt, it\u2019s just a birth\nmark. And I know it\u2019s ugly and I keep it hidden all the time but I\nthought\u2013 if you say you want to draw me you should know ahead of\ntime\u2013\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cWhoever\ntold you this was ugly?\u201d Steve\u2019s hand was so big it covered the\nbirthmark completely from edge to edge when he spread it over Tony\u2019s\nheart. \u201cWhy do you hide it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cWell,\nbecause it looks like\u2013\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cIt\nlooks like the stars themselves were jealous the night you were\nborn.\u201d Steve whispered. \u201cAnd fell from heaven to make their home\nhere on your heart so you would never outshine them.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cBut\nI\u2013\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cIt\nobviously didn\u2019t work.\u201d he continued, leaning in to touch a\nsoft kiss to the birthmark. \u201cYour eyes are brighter than star shine\nand your smile enough to shame the sun. You are perfect in every way,\nand having a piece of heaven on your heart just confirms it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cOh.\u201d\nTony brushed his fingers over Steve\u2019s jaw, swallowing when the\nAlpha turned his head into the touch. \u201cHave you\u2013 have you ever\nheard the story about the child born beneath star fall?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nSteve traced the lines of star burst curiously, the rough pads of his\nfingertips spreading goosebumps across Tony\u2019s skin. \u201cIs it a story I should know?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cIs\nthere a reason beyond wanderings you ended up here, close to the\nriver right now?\u201d Tony asked instead and a wrinkle of confusion crossed his\nAlpha\u2019s brow. \u201cBecause of a Prince coming of age or anything like\nthat?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cNo,\nsweetheart.\u201d Steve shook his head. \u201cNo, nothing like that.

I promise I will.\nWe\u2019ll learn how to do this together, hm?\u201d \n</p><p>\n\u201cTogether.\u201d\nTony repeated, and pursed his lips for another kiss, a <i>better </i>kiss\nthat his mate gave him readily, happily, with all the pent energy of\nan Alpha who had been waiting far too long.</p><p>\nAnd\nwhen Steve lay them out on the blanket, pinned his Omega to their bed\nand stretched out on top to kiss him breathless, everything <i>else\n</i>slipped away from Tony\u2013 the stress and the uncertainty, the worry of\nbeing caught by Sunset\u2019s men and the confusion over a prophecy he\u2019d\nalways thought was a fairy tale\u2013 \n</p><p>\u2013It\nall slipped away until the only thing Tony knew was the taste of his\nmate, the feel of his Alpha, and the scent of wild flowers as they\nburst into bloom beneath the night sky. \n</p><p>******************</p><p>\nSteve\nwas too intent on listening to the pleased purr from his Omega to put\nany thought into why flowers were <i>blooming </i>all the sudden, but he did\nreach over and pluck one anyway, tucking it behind Tony\u2019s ear and\nkissing the pleased grin from his mate\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\n\u201cYou\nare incredible.\u201d he whispered, dipping past lovely lips to delve\ninto the warmth beneath, swallowing Tony\u2019s surprised moan with a\ngreedier noise of his own and sliding an arm under the trim waist to\nget the Omega right up into his body. They just weren\u2019t close enough,\nnot yet, not with clothes still on but <i>oh </i>it helped when Tony hitched\nan ankle around Steve\u2019s calf and canted his hips, rubbing against him\nlanguidly.</p><p>\n\u201cOmega.\u201d\nThe Alpha rumbled and Tony trilled something sweet and <i>wanting </i>into\nhis ear, following it up with a sharp dart of fangs that had Steve\nmaking a thoroughly undignified noise and Tony huffed a laugh when\nthe blonde tried to cover it with a sexier one.</p><p>\n\u201cCharming.\u201d\nHe teased and Steve licked a long line up his throat to growl,\n\u201c<i>Yours</i>.\u201d subsequently ruining anything else sassy Tony might have\nthought to say, the Omega simply looping his arms tight around his\nmate\u2019s neck and pulling him down for another and another and\nanother kiss because <i>yes yes yes</i> this Alpha was his.</p><p>\n\u201cCan\nI touch you here?\u201d The Alpha ran his hand the length of a lean\nthigh and up to the fastens of the yellow trousers. \u201cMy mate, can I\ntake these off?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\nTony\nnodded because he didn\u2019t think he could talk but Steve urged him, \u201cI need you to tell\nme yes or tell me no but I need to hear it, sweetheart need\nto know what you want.

Tony\u2019s \nlittle cry at the feel of two fingers made Steve want to roar, the\nway the Omega clung to him, scratching his nails down Steve\u2019s chest\nand around to his side, canting his hips up and rolling his body to\ndrag them deeper.</p><p>\n\u201cYou\u2019re\nso small.\u201d Steve was suddenly terrified at how tight Tony\nfelt even around two fingers, thinking there was no way for his\nlittle mate to ever be able to take all of him. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll\nbreak you.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI\nwon\u2019t break.\u201d The words cracked over a shaky sigh at\nthe stretch of three. \u201cYou won\u2019t break me, we\u2019re made for each\nother. <i>Mates</i>.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cMates.\u201d\nSteve repeated, leaning far over and sealing their lips together,\nexploring Tony\u2019s mouth in hungry licks and little nibbles. \u201cMy\nmate. <i>Mine</i>. Precious, beautiful. You\u2019re perfect. I\u2019ve waited my whole life to find you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Steve kept whispering sweet things, praising his mate even as he used\nthe slick of Tony\u2019s body to stroke down his cock, lining the blunt\nhead up with Tony\u2019s entrance. \u201cSweetheart, darling thing, are you ready for me?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYes\nyes yes yes.\u201d</p><p>\nThe\nfirst push was <i>agonizing</i>, a burn so sharp it was nearly painful and\nTony turned his face away so Steve wouldn\u2019t see the tears in his\neyes. The Alpha was huge, nearly massive and Tony thought he might split in two with the effort, even with the care and time and preparation Steve had taken.\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cTell\nme to stop.\u201d The Alpha said raggedly, stilling at once and bringing Tony back to kiss the tears away. \u201cMy love, tell me to stop and I will.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cDon\u2019t\nstop.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cOmega\u2013\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cDon\u2019t\nstop.\u201d It was already better, the burn settling into a low throb in\nTony\u2019s core, the empty that had been soothed by Steve\u2019s presence earlier\nreappearing pained enough to make him cry out. \u201cPlease, my Alpha, I want\u2013 I\nneed\u2013\u201d</p><p><i>\nPressure\npressure pressure</i>, hot and tight and the Alpha gritted his teeth to\nkeep himself slow, unable to tear his eyes away from where so much\nof himself was disappearing into Tony, where his mate was opening around him until their hips finally met\nand he was all the way through, buried to the hilt and already\nwishing he had <i>more </i>because it just wasn\u2019t enough yet. \n</p><p><i>They weren\u2019t together enough yet.</i></p><p>\u201cOh\ngod.\u201d Tony\u2019s eyes were wide open, staring almost unseeingly at the\nstars above. \u201cOh m-my god.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cSweetheart? Alright?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2019m\nso full.\u201d Tony reached down between their bodies and slid his\nfingers along where they were connected, ripping a moan from his\nAlpha.\u201d Oh god I\u2019m so <i>full</i>, you\u2019re so big and I\u2019m so\u2013\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Steve\nmoved just the barest bit, nothing more than an inch away and then\nback again and Tony tossed his head back and shouted loud enough to\ncover Steve\u2019s answering growl.</p><p>\n\u201cYes\nOmega,\u201d he praised, dotting kisses along Tony\u2019s face and jaw,\nwiping away the last stray tear and <i>melting </i>over the sweet purr Tony\ngave him in return. \u201cYes sweetheart, you are perfect.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201c<i>Again</i>.\u201d</p><p>\nSteve\nwithdrew further this time, until Tony was whining and arching his\nback and scrabbling at his sides to bring him back and then he sank\nin in one smooth stroke, filling his mate completely.</p><p>\n\u201c<i>Again</i>.\u201d\n\n</p><p>Steve\nnudged Tony\u2019s knees up to make more room between the lean thighs, propping himself up on one arm so the other hand was free to wander.\nHe thrust into Tony slowly, steadily, rolling his hips in a lazy sort\nof fashion that had him bottoming out on every stroke before lifting\nfree again. With his other hand he explored the lines of star light\non Tony\u2019s chest, smoothed away curls from his mates forehead and\nrubbed soothing circles over the bare bonding spot.</p><p>\nTony\nlinked their fingers together and Steve stretched his mates arms out\nabove his head, pinning them to the blankets and admiring the lines \nof his Omega\u2019s body, learning the arc of his back and the span of each\nbreath, the hollow of Tony\u2019s throat and the dip of his navel and when\nTony\u2019s breath caught over a particularly good push deep in his core,\nSteve shifted back to try and find that spot again, the one that made\nhis mates eyes flash and body tighten and \u2013</p><p><i>\nThere</i>.\nTony gave a needy little sob and Steve rumbled something <i>amazed </i>because he\u2019d never seen an Omega like this before, never could have\n<i>imagined </i>an Omega like this, spread open and wanting as he took Steve deeper with every push,\ngasping for his Alpha and demanding <i>more</i>, flushing beautifully up over his chest and into his cheeks as Steve drove into the same spot over and over\nuntil the Omega was a trembling mess beneath him.</p><p>\n\u201cDo\nyou want all of me?\u201d Steve grasped at a narrow hip\nand thrust <i>harder </i>now as his knot started to swell, the edge of it\ncatching the rim of Tony\u2019s entrance and making both Alpha and Omega stammer through each stroke, breath stuttering with every tug. \u201cCan I knot you, my mate?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201c<i>Yes</i>.\u201d\nTony moaned, nearly coming off the blanket as the swelling knot\ncaught for a split second before giving again. \u201cYes, yes I want all\nof you, my mate, <i>mine</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Mine</i>.\u201d\nSteve repeated, voice nothing more than a growl as he got closer\nto his release, leaning back over Tony\u2019s body to pull over his cock\nwith sure strokes, mindful to keep the maddening rhythm deep inside\nTony\u2019s center just <i>right </i>to have his Omega hovering on the edge.\n\u201cYou are <i>mine</i>, Omega.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cAlpha.\u201d\nTony\u2019s cries of satisfaction slid towards frustration, his legs wrapping around Steve\u2019s waist as he tried to lift into each thrust, trying to get the Alpha deeper or fuller\u2013 he didn\u2019t know exactly what he needed but he knew his Alpha wasn\u2019t giving him <i>enough </i>yet. \u201cI can\u2019t\u2013 I\nneed more, give me more\u2013\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2019ve\ngot you, lovely\u201d Steve\u2019s knot was catching every stroke now, stuck\ninside the Omega\u2019s sweet body for a little longer each time before\ngiving free and with a snarl of impatience, Steve pinned Tony to the\nblanket, ground their hips together until his knot swelled full size\nand locked tight.</p><p>\n\u201cAlpha!\u201d That was all it took, the heavy weight of a full knot, and Tony <i>screamed </i>his release into the night air, cock spilling white all\nover his stomach and Steve\u2019s fist, pooling in his navel and dripping off his sides into the blankets, his center tightening, tensing, clenching down around the Alpha.\u00a0</p><p>He was still lost in white hot rapture when Steve surged forward and sank his teeth in over Tony\u2019s bonding mark, fangs puncturing clear skin and pouring pheromone laced blood into the Alpha\u2019s mouth.\u00a0</p><p>Tony cried out again, pure joy and sweet satisfaction and the Alpha groaned in response, cock swelling impossibly bigger for a few seconds before he was losing himself as well, pouring wet inside his Omega,\nrutting through each pulse and letting a possessive growl vibrate\nthrough his chest and into his mate.</p><p>\nTony\nshuddered through another peak before the first had even fully\nfinished, his body shattering apart around mind blanking and\nleaving him barely lucid, barely breathing as the Alpha rocked\nthrough the last few waves.</p><p>\n\u201cMy\nmate.\u201d Steve\u2019s voice was still little more than a growl as he\nunlocked his jaw and licked gently over the sluggishly bleeding bite mark.\n\u201cMy mate, my Omega\u2013\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cMmm,\nmy <i>mate</i>.\u201d Tony whispered tiredly, carding his fingers through\nSteve\u2019s hair and bringing him down for a long kiss, shivering over\nthe lingering taste of himself on the Alpha\u2019s lips, the iron tinge of\nblood on the hooked fangs.</p><p>\n\u201cYou\nare perfect.\u201d Steve told him. \u201cBeautiful.

Not until right now.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cCome\nhere.\u201d Steve cradled Tony close to his chest and rolled carefully\nso the Omega wouldn\u2019t be crushed under his weight, feeling around for\nthe blanket and dragging it up and over Tony\u2019s shoulders. \u201cDon\u2019t\nwant the stars to be jealous of your beauty.\u201d he teased and Tony\ntucked his head into Steve\u2019s chest to hide his blush, wondering how he could even still blush after what they had just shared.</p><p>\n\u201cCharming.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s\nwhat they say.\u201d Steve held him close, smoothing his hands up and\ndown Tony\u2019s back as they waited for the shivers to calm, breathing in\nthe floral scented air and letting his eyes fall closed. \u201cAre you\nmine, Omega?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cYours.\u201d\nTony curled tight over the Alpha\u2019s heartbeat. \u201cAlpha.\u201d</p><p>\n******************</p><p>\nSteve\nwas adamant about cleaning Tony up, wrapping his little mate in\nthe blanket despite the warm night air and stepping back into his\npants to pour some water over a rag. He wiped carefully between\nTony\u2019s legs, crooned sweetly at the lingering blush on Tony\u2019s cheeks and rubbed his cheek on the soft belly, leaving a gentle kiss at the base of\nhis cock.</p><p>\n\u201cBeautiful.\u201d\nhe sighed and Tony tugged the Alpha back onto the bed, rolling\nover so his rear was tucked into Steve\u2019s hips, the Alpha able to lick\nand nuzzle at the bite mark as he wanted.</p><p>\n\u201cThere\u2019s\na lot we need to talk about.\u201d He said after a long time, after his\nheart had settled and body had cooled and everything <i>real life</i> started to sink\nback in.</p><p>\n\u201cI\nknow.\u201d Steve assured him, rubbing slow circles on Tony\u2019s stomach.\n\u201cWe need to know more than each others favorite foods and colors to\nmake this work.

What\nhappened last night, was it real or was it magic?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhat\nare you talking about\u2013\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\ncursed.\u201d Tony blurted. \u201cThere\u2019s a prophecy that has to do with my\nbirth mark and why my parents died and I can\u2019t tell you much more\nthan that right now because I don\u2019t <i>understand</i>\nmuch more than that, but until I know if this is real\u2013\u201d tears were\nfalling down his cheeks. \u201c\u2013until I know what the prophecy means\nfor me and for my life, I can\u2019t stay here with you.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d\nSteve strained at the ropes again but the knots held. \u201cNo, Tony. I\ndon\u2019t care about any of that. I don\u2019t care about prophecies or\nsecrets or anything\u2013 this isn\u2019t magic sweetheart, this is true love,\ntrue mates, we are <i>made </i>for each other\u2013\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\ndon\u2019t know that for sure.\u201d<br></p><p>Steve\njerked as if he was slapped, and Tony made a wounded noise as well.\n\u201cSo everything last night\u2013 you didn\u2019t mean it?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\nmeant every word.\u201d Tony whispered. \u201cOh god, I meant I every word.\nI <i>did</i>.

I\u2019ve\nnever had an Alpha at all, I\u2019ve never wanted an Alpha before meeting\nyou and now I\u2013\u201d his smile was more than a hint eager. \u201c\u2013I\nforgot to be nervous about it.

You\u2019re my first, Tony.\u201d he picked\nup the Omega\u2019s hand and laced their fingers together, laying them first at\nthe bonding spot at the base of his neck, then down to rest over his\nheart.\u00a0\u201cAnd you\u2019ll be my only.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Alpha</i>.\u201d\nTony breathed and Steve rumbled something indecipherable in return,\npressing at Tony\u2019s hand. \u201cYour only?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cMy\nonly.\u201d Steve confirmed, looking as it physically pained him to\nstand up and move back to the other side of the fire. \u201cAnd you\ndeserve better than an Alpha who kisses you once and is lost in a rut\nthe rest of the night, so let\u2019s wait. Just a bit. Is that alright?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cWell\nthen what should we do?\u201d Tony never took his eyes off the Prince,\nwondering at the <i>sincerity </i>that shone from astonishingly blue eyes.\n\u201cIf you aren\u2019t going to kiss me\u2013\u201d</p><p>\n\u201c<i>Yet</i>.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201c\u2013yet.\u201d\nhe amended, his core clenching tight in anticipation. \u201cIf you\naren\u2019t going to kiss me yet. What should we do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell\nme everything about you, Tony. I want to know it all.\u201d\u00a0Steve\nbusied himself retrieving more blankets from his horse\u2019s pack,\nspreading them out in the grass between himself and the Omega with\nclear intention. \u201cI know you\u2019ve never had an Alpha, but I want to\nknow\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid\nyou know that before I told you?\u201d Tony interrupted and Steve paused\nin the bed making to nod. \u201cHow? <i>How </i>did you know?\u201d</p><p>Most\nAlphas probably would have been cocky about this sort of thing,\nbut Steve sounded almost humbled as he explained, \u201cYou scent\n<i>innocent</i>, Tony. You scent like innocent and you scent like <i>mine</i>.\nThat\u2019s how I knew.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201c\u2026I\nscent like <i>yours</i>?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cLike\nvanilla.\u201d Steve let <i>possessive </i>roll through his words simply to\nwatch his mate catch his bottom lip with the edge of his darling\nfangs. \u201cVanilla and honey and spicy like cloves and like every\nthing that\u2019s mine. It\u2019s perfect. <i>You\u2019re </i>perfect. Waited my whole\nlife to find someone who scented the way you do.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cYour\nwhole life.\u201d Tony hugged his knees to his chest, peering over at\nhis apparent mate from beneath his lashes and trilling in quiet\npleasure over hearing such devotion from his Alpha. \u201cAnd how many\nyears would that be exactly?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cTwenty\nnine.\u201d Steve tore himself away from the hypnotizing gold in the\nOmega\u2019s eyes and went back to the saddle bags for more blankets. \u201cI\nturn thirty in the spring, and then I\u2019ll have to stop wandering and\nactually return home to take over the throne.\u201d He cocked his head\nand amended, \u201c<i>We </i>will have to return home, I suppose. Unless you\nhave your heart set on staying here? Do you live close to here or are\nyou traveling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\ntraveling.\u201d Tony didn\u2019t want to lie to his Alpha\u2013 he\u2019d always been\na terrible liar the few times he\u2019d attempted it anyway, and he\ncertainly didn\u2019t want to lie now, not when his Prince was being so\nhonest. \u201cBut not too far. Just a few days from home is all. Why did\nyou take off wandering?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause\nthere isn\u2019t an Alpha in the world with enough common sense to take a\nthrone at twenty one.\u201d Steve informed him, and Tony muffled a\ngiggle into his hand. \u201cI wasn\u2019t ready to rule and there was an\nentire world out there to see and my best friend\u2013\u201d</p><p>For\nthe first time, the Alpha\u2019s smile faltered and dimmed. \u201cMy best\nfriend went off to find fortune and fame as a knight when he came of\nage. I was only twenty at the time, so I couldn\u2019t go. And by the time\nI was ready to come and join him\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlpha?\u201d\nTony whispered when the broad shoulders sagged in remembered grief.\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d \n</p><p>\u201cThe\nlast letter from him came from a spot of war on this continent.\u201d\nSteve cleared his throat and went back to unpacking, laying out\nanother blanket for them to lie on. \u201cSo my parents gave me Nomad as\na coming of age present and I set off across the sea to find him.\u201d</p><p><i>I never did find him</i> went unspoken in the air and Tony felt his heart break a little for his mate.\u00a0\u201cEight\nyears you\u2019ve been looking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEight\nyears I\u2019ve been <i>wandering</i>.\u201d Steve corrected without looking away from the blankets. \u201cI\nhoped I would find him of course, but the continents been involved in\nwar for so long and so many soldiers have fallen, I know I never\nwill.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo\nyou stayed wandering to find your own adventure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nstayed wandering to find my own adventure.\u201d Steve agreed, then\nundid the clasp of his wine skin and offered it to Tony, mustering up a smile when\ntheir hands brushed. \u201cAnd what an adventure I found, hm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nsorry about your friend.\u201d Tony took a sip of the wine and hummed\nagreeably when he found the taste to his liking. \u201cBut not sorry you\nended up here. Is that alright to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d\nSteve said warmly, then sat himself down on the far edge of the pile\nof blankets, motioning to the other side for Tony to sit as well. \u201cNo\nreason for you to sit way over there, sweetheart, at least come sit\nsome where comfortable.\u201d</p><p>Tony\nbrought the blanket he\u2019d been sitting on to roll up as a pillow and\npropped it behind his back, sitting cross legged\u2013 and not close\nenough to his Alpha as \u00a0far as he was concerned\u2013 and clasping his\nhands in his lap.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s\nyour best friends name?\u201d Steve took the wine back for a drink and\nset it aside, mirroring Tony\u2019s position on their bed. \u201cAnd how long\nhave you known them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy\nbest friend\u2013\u201d Tony started to answer, then frowned. \u201cYou know, I\ndon\u2019t have a best friend. No one other than Jarvis, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s\nJarvis?\u201d Steve prompted, inching just a tiny bit closer and\nthrilling clear to his <i>soul </i>when the Omega budged closer as well,\nrelieved his mate felt the same urge to be near.</p><p>\u201cJarvis\nis the Beta that raised me, along with his mate Ana. My parents\u2013\u201d\n<i>were murdered.</i> \u201c\u2013passed when I was young and they took me in. Tell\nme about where you live?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cOur\ncastle is on\na cliff overlooking the sea.\u201d Steve\u2019s fingers itched with the need\nto erase the hint of sadness in the Omega\u2019s eyes. \u201cThere are gardens behind\nthe castle, and I can climb down the cliffs to the beach below and\nswim in the waves. Fishing too, do you like to fish?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2019ve\nnever tried.\u201d Tony answered truthfully. \u201cMy home is\u2013\u201d <i>Dark.\nCursed. Not home at all anymore.</i>\u00a0\u201c\u2013surrounded by forest on all\nsides and very few plants or flowers grow. The river here is the\nclosest I am to ever seeing water.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll\nlove our castle.\u201d Steve decided. \u201cIt\u2019s where my parents fell in\nlove, right there on the beach. My dad knew my ma was the perfect\nOmega for him, so he went running down the sands one day and scooped\nher up into his arms ready to make a proclamation of love and intent\nto bond. My ma was so startled at being snatched up by an Alpha, she flailed around and smacked the hell out of him and he dropped her\nright in the waves, right on the rocks and bruised her ribs all up.\u201d</p><p>\nTony\nburst into horrified laughter and Steve laughed too. \u201cHe picked her\nup off the rocks and informer her that she was his mate. Ma said \u2018the\nhell I am\u2019 and stomped away. Made him chase for her almost a year\nbefore she so much as let him close enough to scent her again.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cSo\nyou <i>don\u2019t </i>get your charm from your father, then?\u201d Tony hazarded a guess and\nthe Alpha laughed even louder. \u201cBut\nthey <i>were </i>mates, weren\u2019t they? And she would have known right away\ntoo, so why did she make him wait?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cBecause\nma wanted to know he wasn\u2019t just scent stupid and looking for an\nOmega to rut on.\u201d Steve took another sip from the wine and passed\nit over again. \u201cForgive my crudeness, what I meant to say is\u2013\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cHe\nwas looking for a warm spot to bury his knot and she was the closest\nthing that didn\u2019t stink?\u201d Tony finished and the Alpha barked a\ndelighted laugh at the impish grin the Omega sent his way. \u201cI was\nraised by Betas who have very little tolerance for Alphas and\ntheir antics.

I\u2019d like to see you, if you don\u2019t\nmind.\u201d</p><p>\nIt\nwas warm by the fire, almost unnaturally so, the usual freezing\ntemperatures of the winter night seeming not to exist in the circle\nof their clearing and Steve suddenly realized he was sweating\nunder the long jacket.</p><p>And it\ndidn\u2019t matter if he was sweating from the unexpected warmth of the\nwinter night or if he was sweating because his Omega had been bold\nenough to ask to see him\u2013 either way Steve stood and stripped the coat\naway without a seconds hesitation, letting it fall carelessly onto\nthe ground.</p><p>\n\u201cBetter?\u201d\nHe barely managed to get the words out over the <i>shine </i>in his mate\u2019s\neyes, the fire reflecting onto Tony\u2019s face and turning the deep brown\na rich whiskey color. \u201cOmega?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cMuch.\u201d\nTony didn\u2019t bother making an effort not to stare, licking his lips as he looked the Alpha over, admiring\nthe cut of fitted trousers over Steve\u2019s thighs and the way his waist\nlooked so small compared to the breadth of his shoulders. \u201c\u2026thank\nyou.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cAre\nyou warm too, my love?\u201d Steve asked hoarsely, his hands clenching\nat his sides as if restraining himself from reaching out. \u201cCould\nyou\u2013 your jacket as well?\u201d</p><p>Tony wanted to tease about how just a bit\nearlier the Alpha had given him a blanket to cover up with, but Steve\ngave an urgent, <i>coaxing </i>growl and Tony just nodded instead, shrugging\nout of his jacket and pushing it away.</p><p>\u201cMy favorite color\u2019s blue.\u201d Steve said\nthen, loving the way the silk clung to his mate\u2019s collarbone, the\nlace on the hems that gave peeks at skin beneath. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful\nin it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d The Omega looked so pleased\nby the compliment Steve wondered for a moment if Tony had never been\npraised before but that\u2013 <i>that </i>couldn\u2019t be true.

Tell me about\nyour friends Ana and Jarvis.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cAna\nand Jarvis are saints.\u201d Tony dipped his head to lick experimentally\nat the hollow of Steve\u2019s throat, thrilling over the Alpha\u2019s answering\nwhine. \u201cJarvis taught me how to use the stars to find my way and how\nto tie knots and use a sword and Ana\u2013\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Steve\nmoaned aloud over the dig of fangs at his collarbone. \u201cAna taught\nme how to make bread and how to mend clothes and how to garden.

Green and red and this mixed\napple our gardeners were working on when I left, something pink and\ncrisp, I only had it once but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s amazing, you would love\nit. When I bring you home with me\u2013\u201d He fit his palm to the back of\nTony\u2019s neck, pressing purposefully over the bonding mark and rumbling\nin satisfaction when the Omega automatically arched into it, tipping\nhis head back to offer more of himself.</p><p>\u201cHow\ndo I scent to you, Omega?\u201d Steve forgot all about <i>apples </i>as Tony melted\nforward into his chest, notched his nose into the curve of Steve\u2019s\nthroat and hummed against his skin. \u201cDo I scent\u2013 I know we match,\nobviously our scents match, but do you <i>like </i>it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nscent like rosewood.\u201d Tony crooned into the Alpha\u2019s ear. \u201cRosewood\nlike what I work with in my shop and pine trees like the ones that\ngrow outside my window. And you scent warm.\u201d he tried to get closer\nstill. \u201cYou scent warm and I feel as if I\u2019ve been cold for my\nentire life. Didn\u2019t realize how cold I was until you made me feel\nwarm.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cMmm,\nmy love.\u201d Steve whispered, playing at the hem of Tony\u2019s blouse but\nnot daring to lift it without permission. \u201cI\u2019ll always keep you\nwarm, don\u2019t you worry.\u201d</p><p>\nTony\nhesitated, kneading his fingers into the muscle at Steve\u2019s shoulder\nand biting his lip nervously. \u201cI\u2019m a little\u2013 I\u2019m a little cold\nnow. Would you hold me a tighter? Closer?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cOh.\u201d\nThe blue eyes flared red for a second before the Alpha got himself\nunder control. \u201cYes sweetheart, come here. Right here.\u201d</p><p>\nBig\nhands up and under Tony\u2019s legs and he gave a startled yelp when the\nAlpha picked him up as if he didn\u2019t weigh anything at all, lifting\nhim right off the blanket and onto his lap and suddenly they were\nmuch closer than they\u2019d been before, mouths nearly meeting with each\nbreath, eyes wide as they stared from just a few inches\naway.</p><p>\nTony\nalmost bit through his lip when he settled firm onto the Alpha\u2019s\nthighs, rocking forward experimentally, <i>instinctively</i>, shuddering\nwhen he felt the Alpha\u2019s cock already hard beneath him.\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cOmega.\u201d\nSteve groaned over the welcome weight, palming over the tempting\ncurve of his mate\u2019s rear and feeling the way the yellow pants strained\ntight now that Tony\u2019s legs were open, knees spread on either side of\nSteve\u2019s waist. \u201cYou feel good.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cYou\nwant me.\u201d Tony whispered into his mate\u2019s ear, feeling the thick\nlength twitching against the underside of his thigh and hiding a secret, proud smile that he\u2019d brought his Alpha to such a state with so little effort. \u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cTell\nme\u2013\u201d Even half drunk on Omega scent, Steve tried his damnedest to\nwait, to give his mate the time he\u2019d promised. \u201cDo you like\nmusic?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cI\nlove to sing.\u201d Being this close to his Alpha helped to settle the\n<i>wild </i>coursing through Tony\u2019s veins, the aggravating <i>empty </i>that seemed\nto grow worse the longer he wasn\u2019t with the Alpha\nthe way he needed to be. \u201cAnd play the piano. I can sing better\nthan I play though. What about you?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cMy\nma sings like an angel.\u201d Steve bent the Omega\u2019s back into a\ngraceful arch and suckled at his earlobe, tracing the shell with the\ntip of his tongue and blowing warm across the damp skin to make his\nmate shiver. \u201cBut I don\u2019t so much <i>sing </i>as I do yowl like a long\ntailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\nTony\nclapped a hand over his mouth to muffle his laughter, shoulders\nshaking and eyes sparkling with mirth. \u201cCharming.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cMy singing\nis entirely un-charming\u201d\n<i>God</i>, Steve loved the sound of his mate\u2019s laughter. \u201cBut I do love to\ndraw and one day after we\u2019re officially mated, I\u2019m going to lay\nyou out in the sunshine and draw every inch of your beautiful\u2013\u201d he\nsighed when Tony wriggled closer. \u201c\u2013<i>perfect</i>\u2013\u201d dragging his\nfingers down Tony\u2019s back to smooth over his hips and the barest\ninch lower. \u201c\u2013<i>gorgeous</i>\u2013\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cWait.\u201d\nTony leaned away and put his hand over the Alpha\u2019s mouth before he\ncould finish. \u201cWait, wait before you say whatever you\u2019re going to say,\nI need\u2013\u201d he paused, playing with the buttons on his blouse. \u201cI\nneed to show you something.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cAnything.\u201d\u00a0Steve\nsaid immediately, honestly. \u201cYou can tell me anything at all, my\nmate.\u201d</p><p>\nTony\nundid the garment slowly, not missing the way the Alpha\u2019s eyes\nwidened a little more at every bit of skin exposed but still\nhesitating before opening his shirt entirely to show Steve the mark\non his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s not scars, I wasn\u2019t hurt, it\u2019s just a birth\nmark. And I know it\u2019s ugly and I keep it hidden all the time but I\nthought\u2013 if you say you want to draw me you should know ahead of\ntime\u2013\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cWhoever\ntold you this was ugly?\u201d Steve\u2019s hand was so big it covered the\nbirthmark completely from edge to edge when he spread it over Tony\u2019s\nheart. \u201cWhy do you hide it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cWell,\nbecause it looks like\u2013\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cIt\nlooks like the stars themselves were jealous the night you were\nborn.\u201d Steve whispered. \u201cAnd fell from heaven to make their home\nhere on your heart so you would never outshine them.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cBut\nI\u2013\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cIt\nobviously didn\u2019t work.\u201d he continued, leaning in to touch a\nsoft kiss to the birthmark. \u201cYour eyes are brighter than star shine\nand your smile enough to shame the sun. You are perfect in every way,\nand having a piece of heaven on your heart just confirms it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cOh.\u201d\nTony brushed his fingers over Steve\u2019s jaw, swallowing when the\nAlpha turned his head into the touch. \u201cHave you\u2013 have you ever\nheard the story about the child born beneath star fall?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nSteve traced the lines of star burst curiously, the rough pads of his\nfingertips spreading goosebumps across Tony\u2019s skin. \u201cIs it a story I should know?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cIs\nthere a reason beyond wanderings you ended up here, close to the\nriver right now?\u201d Tony asked instead and a wrinkle of confusion crossed his\nAlpha\u2019s brow. \u201cBecause of a Prince coming of age or anything like\nthat?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cNo,\nsweetheart.\u201d Steve shook his head. \u201cNo, nothing like that.

I promise I will.\nWe\u2019ll learn how to do this together, hm?\u201d \n</p><p>\n\u201cTogether.\u201d\nTony repeated, and pursed his lips for another kiss, a <i>better </i>kiss\nthat his mate gave him readily, happily, with all the pent energy of\nan Alpha who had been waiting far too long.</p><p>\nAnd\nwhen Steve lay them out on the blanket, pinned his Omega to their bed\nand stretched out on top to kiss him breathless, everything <i>else\n</i>slipped away from Tony\u2013 the stress and the uncertainty, the worry of\nbeing caught by Sunset\u2019s men and the confusion over a prophecy he\u2019d\nalways thought was a fairy tale\u2013 \n</p><p>\u2013It\nall slipped away until the only thing Tony knew was the taste of his\nmate, the feel of his Alpha, and the scent of wild flowers as they\nburst into bloom beneath the night sky. \n</p><p>******************</p><p>\nSteve\nwas too intent on listening to the pleased purr from his Omega to put\nany thought into why flowers were <i>blooming </i>all the sudden, but he did\nreach over and pluck one anyway, tucking it behind Tony\u2019s ear and\nkissing the pleased grin from his mate\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\n\u201cYou\nare incredible.\u201d he whispered, dipping past lovely lips to delve\ninto the warmth beneath, swallowing Tony\u2019s surprised moan with a\ngreedier noise of his own and sliding an arm under the trim waist to\nget the Omega right up into his body. They just weren\u2019t close enough,\nnot yet, not with clothes still on but <i>oh </i>it helped when Tony hitched\nan ankle around Steve\u2019s calf and canted his hips, rubbing against him\nlanguidly.</p><p>\n\u201cOmega.\u201d\nThe Alpha rumbled and Tony trilled something sweet and <i>wanting </i>into\nhis ear, following it up with a sharp dart of fangs that had Steve\nmaking a thoroughly undignified noise and Tony huffed a laugh when\nthe blonde tried to cover it with a sexier one.</p><p>\n\u201cCharming.\u201d\nHe teased and Steve licked a long line up his throat to growl,\n\u201c<i>Yours</i>.\u201d subsequently ruining anything else sassy Tony might have\nthought to say, the Omega simply looping his arms tight around his\nmate\u2019s neck and pulling him down for another and another and\nanother kiss because <i>yes yes yes</i> this Alpha was his.</p><p>\n\u201cCan\nI touch you here?\u201d The Alpha ran his hand the length of a lean\nthigh and up to the fastens of the yellow trousers. \u201cMy mate, can I\ntake these off?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\nTony\nnodded because he didn\u2019t think he could talk but Steve urged him, \u201cI need you to tell\nme yes or tell me no but I need to hear it, sweetheart need\nto know what you want.

With his other hand he explored the lines of star light\non Tony\u2019s chest, smoothed away curls from his mates forehead and\nrubbed soothing circles over the bare bonding spot.</p><p>\nTony\nlinked their fingers together and Steve stretched his mates arms out\nabove his head, pinning them to the blankets and admiring the lines \nof his Omega\u2019s body, learning the arc of his back and the span of each\nbreath, the hollow of Tony\u2019s throat and the dip of his navel and when\nTony\u2019s breath caught over a particularly good push deep in his core,\nSteve shifted back to try and find that spot again, the one that made\nhis mates eyes flash and body tighten and \u2013</p><p><i>\nThere</i>.\nTony gave a needy little sob and Steve rumbled something <i>amazed </i>because he\u2019d never seen an Omega like this before, never could have\n<i>imagined </i>an Omega like this, spread open and wanting as he took Steve deeper with every push,\ngasping for his Alpha and demanding <i>more</i>, flushing beautifully up over his chest and into his cheeks as Steve drove into the same spot over and over\nuntil the Omega was a trembling mess beneath him.</p><p>\n\u201cDo\nyou want all of me?\u201d Steve grasped at a narrow hip\nand thrust <i>harder </i>now as his knot started to swell, the edge of it\ncatching the rim of Tony\u2019s entrance and making both Alpha and Omega stammer through each stroke, breath stuttering with every tug. \u201cCan I knot you, my mate?\u201d</p><p>\n\u201c<i>Yes</i>.\u201d\nTony moaned, nearly coming off the blanket as the swelling knot\ncaught for a split second before giving again. \u201cYes, yes I want all\nof you, my mate, <i>mine</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Mine</i>.\u201d\nSteve repeated, voice nothing more than a growl as he got closer\nto his release, leaning back over Tony\u2019s body to pull over his cock\nwith sure strokes, mindful to keep the maddening rhythm deep inside\nTony\u2019s center just <i>right </i>to have his Omega hovering on the edge.\n\u201cYou are <i>mine</i>, Omega.\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cAlpha.\u201d\nTony\u2019s cries of satisfaction slid towards frustration, his legs wrapping around Steve\u2019s waist as he tried to lift into each thrust, trying to get the Alpha deeper or fuller\u2013 he didn\u2019t know exactly what he needed but he knew his Alpha wasn\u2019t giving him <i>enough </i>yet. \u201cI can\u2019t\u2013 I\nneed more, give me more\u2013\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cI\u2019ve\ngot you, lovely\u201d Steve\u2019s knot was catching every stroke now, stuck\ninside the Omega\u2019s sweet body for a little longer each time before\ngiving free and with a snarl of impatience, Steve pinned Tony to the\nblanket, ground their hips together until his knot swelled full size\nand locked tight.</p><p>\n\u201cAlpha!\u201d That was all it took, the heavy weight of a full knot, and Tony <i>screamed </i>his release into the night air, cock spilling white all\nover his stomach and Steve\u2019s fist, pooling in his navel and dripping off his sides into the blankets, his center tightening, tensing, clenching down around the Alpha.\u00a0</p><p>He was still lost in white hot rapture when Steve surged forward and sank his teeth in over Tony\u2019s bonding mark, fangs puncturing clear skin and pouring pheromone laced blood into the Alpha\u2019s mouth.\u00a0</p><p>Tony cried out again, pure joy and sweet satisfaction and the Alpha groaned in response, cock swelling impossibly bigger for a few seconds before he was losing himself as well, pouring wet inside his Omega,\nrutting through each pulse and letting a possessive growl vibrate\nthrough his chest and into his mate.</p><p>\nTony\nshuddered through another peak before the first had even fully\nfinished, his body shattering apart around mind blanking and\nleaving him barely lucid, barely breathing as the Alpha rocked\nthrough the last few waves.</p><p>\n\u201cMy\nmate.\u201d Steve\u2019s voice was still little more than a growl as he\nunlocked his jaw and licked gently over the sluggishly bleeding bite mark.\n\u201cMy mate, my Omega\u2013\u201d</p><p>\n\u201cMmm,\nmy <i>mate</i>.\u201d Tony whispered tiredly, carding his fingers through\nSteve\u2019s hair and bringing him down for a long kiss, shivering over\nthe lingering taste of himself on the Alpha\u2019s lips, the iron tinge of\nblood on the hooked fangs.</p><p>\n\u201cYou\nare perfect.\u201d Steve told him. \u201cBeautiful.

Make me understand and we will\nfigure it out\u2013\u201d</p><p>\n\u201c\u2013and\nif you can wait for me\u2013\u201d Tony dug his fingers into his thighs so\nhe wouldn\u2019t throw himself at the Alpha. \u201c\u2013One day when this is\nover, we can try again. See if we\u2019re actually mates.\u201d \n</p><p>\u201cWe\n<i>are </i>mates.\u201d Steve\u2019s eyes snapped red, his strength <i>surging </i>but\nJarvis had taught Tony well and the rope held tight. \u201cWe <i>are </i>mates,\nTony. There is no magic, there is no spell. I\u2019m yours and you\u2019re mine\nand that\u2019s all there is to it.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cEveryone\nwho has gotten involved in my life has ended up dead or at least in\ndanger.\u201d Tony said quietly. \u201cAnd I\u2019d rather lose you like this\nthan lose you to a witch and a quest for revenge.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cMake\nme understand and I\u2019ll save you.\u201d Steve was begging now, his heart\nvisibly \u00a0breaking. \u201cSweetheart? Please. I\u2019ll save you. I will. I\u2019m\nnot scared of witches or magic or spells or anything like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy\nPrince Charming, of course you want to save me.\u201d Tony backed towards his horse and climbed into\nthe saddle. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m so so sorry. The knot unwinds first backwards and then again forward, I tied a piece of red twine around the end so you\u2019ll know how to undo it.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTony?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTONY!\u201d\n\n</p><p>Tears\npouring down his face, Tony spurred the horse on into the woods at a\nflat our run, purposefully heading away from the river so Steve\nwouldn\u2019t know where he had gone, planning to double back and cross\nlater.<br></p><p>Every\nhoof beat that took him further from his Alpha felt like a blow to\nhis body, his heart seizing in his chest and jolting pain through his soul but Tony never looked back, never stopped, thundering through\nthe woods towards an uncertain future.</p><p>\nAn anguished howl broke through the trees a moment later, the\nsound of an Alpha who had lost his mate and didn\u2019t know <i>why</i>, and all\nat once the flowers that had bloomed in the show of their love,\nwithered and fell away.\u00a0</p><p>And trailing along behind the horse, <i>frost </i>creeping back along the ground.</p><p>*************************</p><p><b><a

Kiss me.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p><br />&ldquo;No,\nnot yet.&rdquo; Steve shook his head even as he leaned further into\nTony&rsquo;s palms, needing his Omega&rsquo;s touch like he needed to breathe.\n&ldquo;Not&ndash; not yet, sweetheart. We have time for all that. No need to\nrush.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\n&ldquo;What&rsquo;s\nrushing about a kiss?&rdquo; Tony had never been kissed of course, but it\ndidn&rsquo;t stop him from <i>wanting </i>one, didn&rsquo;t stop him from sitting up in\ntheir half embrace until his mouth met the Alpha&rsquo;s cheek. &ldquo;My\nPrince, why are we waiting?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\nSteve\n turned his head so Tony&rsquo;s lips swept towards his ear, tucked his\nface back into the Omega&rsquo;s throat and breathed in another mouthful of\nsyrupy sweet scent. &ldquo;We have time, my love, there&rsquo;s no hurry.&rdquo;</p><p>\nHe\neased away from Tony&rsquo;s grasping hands, soothed an uncertain whine\nwith a pass of his lips over Tony&rsquo;s knuckles. &ldquo;We have time to\nkiss and to&ndash; to touch&ndash;&rdquo; the Alpha&rsquo;s eyes sparked <i>wanting</i>\nas he traced the curve of his Omega&rsquo;s hip, exploring the dip of the\ntrim waist. &ldquo;&ndash; to know each other in every way mate&rsquo;s should know\neach other.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;&hellip;but?&rdquo;\nTony furrowed his brow and Steve leaned over to kiss the wrinkle\naway.</p><p>\n&ldquo;But\nwe only have this moment once, you know? We only have tonight one\ntime, only one time for our very first time and I don&rsquo;t want to miss\na single second of it.&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s coat had fallen open while they&rsquo;d\nscented each other and now the Alpha gathered it up again, buttoning it closed against the night air. &ldquo;I suppose\nthat&rsquo;s old fashioned but&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;I\nthink it&rsquo;s charming.&rdquo; Tony couldn&rsquo;t help his smile, and it\nstretched further when streaks of pink highlighted his Alpha&rsquo;s\ncheekbones. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Thank\nyou?&rdquo; Steve echoed, the pine rich scent blurring with embarrassment\nin a way that made the Omega want to croon in open adoration, the\nsweet Alpha <i>embarrassed </i>at being old fashioned. &ldquo;Why thank you?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve\nbeen so lost in&ndash;&rdquo; Tony motioned between their bodies, flushing as he shifted on the blankets and realized\nhe was wet just from being scented, just from being close to the\nAlpha that was meant to be his mate. &ldquo;&ndash;I forgot to even be\nnervous.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;You\ndon&rsquo;t have to be nervous with me.&rdquo; Steve told him, gaze dropping to\nthe long legs wrapped in yellow trousers, knowing full well why his\nOmega had suddenly blushed and re-positioned and the knowledge made\nhis mouth <i>water</i>, made him throb in his pants. &ldquo;My love, I would\nnever do anything&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s\nmy first time.&rdquo; Tony was calmer than he&rsquo;d thought he&rsquo;d be saying\nsomething like this, running his tongue absentmindedly over his fangs\nand reveling in the sudden urge to sink them into the Prince&rsquo;s neck\nto claim the handsome Alpha as his own. &ldquo;My <i>very </i>first time. I&rsquo;ve\nnever had an Alpha at all, I&rsquo;ve never wanted an Alpha before meeting\nyou and now I&ndash;&rdquo; his smile was more than a hint eager. &ldquo;&ndash;I\nforgot to be nervous about it. Thank you for remembering for me.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I\nhope this doesn&rsquo;t sound less charming, but I&rsquo;m not nervous for&nbsp;<i>you&nbsp;</i>sweetheart, I&rsquo;m nervous for me.&rdquo; Steve hesitated, weighing his words.\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never had an Omega, not once, not even just to try the whole\nthing out like other Alphas do. You&rsquo;re my first, Tony.&rdquo; he picked\nup the Omega&rsquo;s hand and laced their fingers together, laying them first at\nthe bonding spot at the base of his neck, then down to rest over his\nheart.&nbsp;&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll be my only.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Alpha</i>.&rdquo;\nTony breathed and Steve rumbled something indecipherable in return,\npressing at Tony&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Your only?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;My\nonly.&rdquo; Steve confirmed, looking as it physically pained him to\nstand up and move back to the other side of the fire. &ldquo;And you\ndeserve better than an Alpha who kisses you once and is lost in a rut\nthe rest of the night, so let&rsquo;s wait. Just a bit. Is that alright?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Well\nthen what should we do?&rdquo; Tony never took his eyes off the Prince,\nwondering at the <i>sincerity </i>that shone from astonishingly blue eyes.\n&ldquo;If you aren&rsquo;t going to kiss me&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;<i>Yet</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;&ndash;yet.&rdquo;\nhe amended, his core clenching tight in anticipation. &ldquo;If you\naren&rsquo;t going to kiss me yet. What should we do?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tell\nme everything about you, Tony. I want to know it all.&rdquo;&nbsp;Steve\nbusied himself retrieving more blankets from his horse&rsquo;s pack,\nspreading them out in the grass between himself and the Omega with\nclear intention. &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;ve never had an Alpha, but I want to\nknow&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did\nyou know that before I told you?&rdquo; Tony interrupted and Steve paused\nin the bed making to nod. &ldquo;How? <i>How </i>did you know?&rdquo;</p><p>Most\nAlphas probably would have been cocky about this sort of thing,\nbut Steve sounded almost humbled as he explained, &ldquo;You scent\n<i>innocent</i>, Tony. You scent like innocent and you scent like <i>mine</i>.\nThat&rsquo;s how I knew.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;&hellip;I\nscent like <i>yours</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Like\nvanilla.&rdquo; Steve let <i>possessive </i>roll through his words simply to\nwatch his mate catch his bottom lip with the edge of his darling\nfangs. &ldquo;Vanilla and honey and spicy like cloves and like every\nthing that&rsquo;s mine. It&rsquo;s perfect. <i>You&rsquo;re </i>perfect. Waited my whole\nlife to find someone who scented the way you do.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Your\nwhole life.&rdquo; Tony hugged his knees to his chest, peering over at\nhis apparent mate from beneath his lashes and trilling in quiet\npleasure over hearing such devotion from his Alpha. &ldquo;And how many\nyears would that be exactly?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Twenty\nnine.&rdquo; Steve tore himself away from the hypnotizing gold in the\nOmega&rsquo;s eyes and went back to the saddle bags for more blankets. &ldquo;I\nturn thirty in the spring, and then I&rsquo;ll have to stop wandering and\nactually return home to take over the throne.&rdquo; He cocked his head\nand amended, &ldquo;<i>We </i>will have to return home, I suppose. Unless you\nhave your heart set on staying here? Do you live close to here or are\nyou traveling?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m\ntraveling.&rdquo; Tony didn&rsquo;t want to lie to his Alpha&ndash; he&rsquo;d always been\na terrible liar the few times he&rsquo;d attempted it anyway, and he\ncertainly didn&rsquo;t want to lie now, not when his Prince was being so\nhonest. &ldquo;But not too far. Just a few days from home is all. Why did\nyou take off wandering?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because\nthere isn&rsquo;t an Alpha in the world with enough common sense to take a\nthrone at twenty one.&rdquo; Steve informed him, and Tony muffled a\ngiggle into his hand. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t ready to rule and there was an\nentire world out there to see and my best friend&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>For\nthe first time, the Alpha&rsquo;s smile faltered and dimmed. &ldquo;My best\nfriend went off to find fortune and fame as a knight when he came of\nage. I was only twenty at the time, so I couldn&rsquo;t go. And by the time\nI was ready to come and join him&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alpha?&rdquo;\nTony whispered when the broad shoulders sagged in remembered grief.\n&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; \n</p><p>&ldquo;The\nlast letter from him came from a spot of war on this continent.&rdquo;\nSteve cleared his throat and went back to unpacking, laying out\nanother blanket for them to lie on. &ldquo;So my parents gave me Nomad as\na coming of age present and I set off across the sea to find him.&rdquo;</p><p><i>I never did find him</i> went unspoken in the air and Tony felt his heart break a little for his mate.&nbsp;&ldquo;Eight\nyears you&rsquo;ve been looking?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Eight\nyears I&rsquo;ve been <i>wandering</i>.&rdquo; Steve corrected without looking away from the blankets. &ldquo;I\nhoped I would find him of course, but the continents been involved in\nwar for so long and so many soldiers have fallen, I know I never\nwill.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;So\nyou stayed wandering to find your own adventure?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I\nstayed wandering to find my own adventure.&rdquo; Steve agreed, then\nundid the clasp of his wine skin and offered it to Tony, mustering up a smile when\ntheir hands brushed. &ldquo;And what an adventure I found, hm?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m\nsorry about your friend.&rdquo; Tony took a sip of the wine and hummed\nagreeably when he found the taste to his liking. &ldquo;But not sorry you\nended up here. Is that alright to say?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Always.&rdquo;\nSteve said warmly, then sat himself down on the far edge of the pile\nof blankets, motioning to the other side for Tony to sit as well. &ldquo;No\nreason for you to sit way over there, sweetheart, at least come sit\nsome where comfortable.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony\nbrought the blanket he&rsquo;d been sitting on to roll up as a pillow and\npropped it behind his back, sitting cross legged&ndash; and not close\nenough to his Alpha as &nbsp;far as he was concerned&ndash; and clasping his\nhands in his lap.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s\nyour best friends name?&rdquo; Steve took the wine back for a drink and\nset it aside, mirroring Tony&rsquo;s position on their bed. &ldquo;And how long\nhave you known them?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My\nbest friend&ndash;&rdquo; Tony started to answer, then frowned. &ldquo;You know, I\ndon&rsquo;t have a best friend. No one other than Jarvis, I suppose.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s\nJarvis?&rdquo; Steve prompted, inching just a tiny bit closer and\nthrilling clear to his <i>soul </i>when the Omega budged closer as well,\nrelieved his mate felt the same urge to be near.</p><p>&ldquo;Jarvis\nis the Beta that raised me, along with his mate Ana. My parents&ndash;&rdquo;\n<i>were murdered.</i> &ldquo;&ndash;passed when I was young and they took me in. Tell\nme about where you live?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Our\ncastle is on\na cliff overlooking the sea.&rdquo; Steve&rsquo;s fingers itched with the need\nto erase the hint of sadness in the Omega&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;There are gardens behind\nthe castle, and I can climb down the cliffs to the beach below and\nswim in the waves. Fishing too, do you like to fish?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve\nnever tried.&rdquo; Tony answered truthfully. &ldquo;My home is&ndash;&rdquo; <i>Dark.\nCursed. Not home at all anymore.</i>&nbsp;&ldquo;&ndash;surrounded by forest on all\nsides and very few plants or flowers grow. The river here is the\nclosest I am to ever seeing water.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll\nlove our castle.&rdquo; Steve decided. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s where my parents fell in\nlove, right there on the beach. My dad knew my ma was the perfect\nOmega for him, so he went running down the sands one day and scooped\nher up into his arms ready to make a proclamation of love and intent\nto bond. My ma was so startled at being snatched up by an Alpha, she flailed around and smacked the hell out of him and he dropped her\nright in the waves, right on the rocks and bruised her ribs all up.&rdquo;</p><p>\nTony\nburst into horrified laughter and Steve laughed too. &ldquo;He picked her\nup off the rocks and informer her that she was his mate. Ma said &lsquo;the\nhell I am&rsquo; and stomped away. Made him chase for her almost a year\nbefore she so much as let him close enough to scent her again.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\n&ldquo;So\nyou <i>don&rsquo;t </i>get your charm from your father, then?&rdquo; Tony hazarded a guess and\nthe Alpha laughed even louder. &ldquo;But\nthey <i>were </i>mates, weren&rsquo;t they? And she would have known right away\ntoo, so why did she make him wait?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Because\nma wanted to know he wasn&rsquo;t just scent stupid and looking for an\nOmega to rut on.&rdquo; Steve took another sip from the wine and passed\nit over again. &ldquo;Forgive my crudeness, what I meant to say is&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;He\nwas looking for a warm spot to bury his knot and she was the closest\nthing that didn&rsquo;t stink?&rdquo; Tony finished and the Alpha barked a\ndelighted laugh at the impish grin the Omega sent his way. &ldquo;I was\nraised by Betas who have very little tolerance for Alphas and\ntheir antics. I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ve heard all sorts of things about\nyour lot.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\n&ldquo;All\nterrible, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Oh\nI don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Tony let his gaze drift appreciatively over\nSteve&rsquo;s frame. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m starting to think Alpha&rsquo;s aren&rsquo;t <i>all\n</i>bad.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\nSteve\npreened under the attention from the lovely brunette, rolling his\nshoulders and letting the seams of his coat pull tight over his arms\nso Tony would keep looking, but he readied another question to turn the conversation back around to getting to know each other,\nnot willing to get too distracted by&ndash;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Take\nyour coat off.&rdquo; The Omega demanded in a sort of whisper the Alpha had only ever <i>dreamed </i>about hearing.\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s warm enough, isn&rsquo;t it? I&rsquo;d like to see you, if you don&rsquo;t\nmind.&rdquo;</p><p>\nIt\nwas warm by the fire, almost unnaturally so, the usual freezing\ntemperatures of the winter night seeming not to exist in the circle\nof their clearing and Steve suddenly realized he was sweating\nunder the long jacket.</p><p>And it\ndidn&rsquo;t matter if he was sweating from the unexpected warmth of the\nwinter night or if he was sweating because his Omega had been bold\nenough to ask to see him&ndash; either way Steve stood and stripped the coat\naway without a seconds hesitation, letting it fall carelessly onto\nthe ground.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Better?&rdquo;\nHe barely managed to get the words out over the <i>shine </i>in his mate&rsquo;s\neyes, the fire reflecting onto Tony&rsquo;s face and turning the deep brown\na rich whiskey color. &ldquo;Omega?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Much.&rdquo;\nTony didn&rsquo;t bother making an effort not to stare, licking his lips as he looked the Alpha over, admiring\nthe cut of fitted trousers over Steve&rsquo;s thighs and the way his waist\nlooked so small compared to the breadth of his shoulders. &ldquo;&hellip;thank\nyou.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Are\nyou warm too, my love?&rdquo; Steve asked hoarsely, his hands clenching\nat his sides as if restraining himself from reaching out. &ldquo;Could\nyou&ndash; your jacket as well?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony wanted to tease about how just a bit\nearlier the Alpha had given him a blanket to cover up with, but Steve\ngave an urgent, <i>coaxing </i>growl and Tony just nodded instead, shrugging\nout of his jacket and pushing it away.</p><p>&ldquo;My favorite color&rsquo;s blue.&rdquo; Steve said\nthen, loving the way the silk clung to his mate&rsquo;s collarbone, the\nlace on the hems that gave peeks at skin beneath. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re beautiful\nin it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; The Omega looked so pleased\nby the compliment Steve wondered for a moment if Tony had never been\npraised before but that&ndash; <i>that </i>couldn&rsquo;t be true. His mate was breathtaking, stunning in a way that was nearly ethereal, gorgeous even\njust sitting there in a torn shirt and&ndash;</p><p><i>A torn shirt?</i></p><p>\n&ldquo;Is\nthat a <i>bruise </i>on your wrist?&rdquo; The light moment was banished\nabruptly by an angry snarl from the Alpha, Steve all but leaping\nacross the blankets to snatch at Tony&rsquo;s wrist, the one he hadn&rsquo;t\nseen before when Tony had been wearing his coat. &ldquo;My Omega, did\nsomeone hurt you?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh\nit&rsquo;s&ndash;&rdquo; Tony tugged at his shirt sleeve half-heartedly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s\nnothing. I&rsquo;m fine. It was a misunderstanding between myself and\nanother Alpha&ndash;&rdquo; he jumped when Steve snarled again and softened\nhis voice to add, &ldquo;&ndash;but we were separated immediately and I never\nsaw him again. He liked my scent and went a bit wild&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;That&rsquo;s\nno excuse!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\n&ldquo;&ndash;and\nhe frightened me, but I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo; Tony sifted his fingers through\nblonde strands, pushing them out of the Alpha&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m\n<i>fine</i>. I just bruise easily, that&rsquo;s all. It doesn&rsquo;t even hurt\nanymore.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll\nbandage it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m\nfine.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\n&ldquo;I\nsaid I&rsquo;ll <i>bandage </i>it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\n&ldquo;My\nPrince.&rdquo; Tony trilled and predictably, the Alpha snapped to\nattention, his gaze riveted on Tony&rsquo;s. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d much rather you\nstay here and sit with me.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;re\nsure you&rsquo;re alright.&rdquo; Steve had to check again, holding Tony&rsquo;s\nwrist closer to the fire so he could see the finger shaped bruises,\ndotting kisses over the marks as if he could make them disappear with\nthat alone.&nbsp;</p><p>\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m\nalright.&rdquo; Tony tugged at Steve&rsquo;s other hand, urging the Alpha\nback down until they were sitting cross legged together, knees\ntouching on either side. &ldquo;I promise, I <i>promise</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>\nSteve\nhated the bruises, hated the idea of his mate being hurt or even put\nin a position to be hurt and he wanted to rage against anyone who had\nlet his mate around a dangerous Alpha&ndash; <i>any </i>Alpha if he were being\nhonest&ndash; but Tony was staring up at him as if he were awestruck, as\nif no one had ever stood up for him before and that was another thing\nSteve didn&rsquo;t quite understand.</p><p>\nHow\nhad an Omega so darling not been loved before, not been complimented\nand sought after and defended?</p><p>\n&ldquo;Tell\nme about the Beta&rsquo;s who raised you.&rdquo; He shook his head and kept the\nconversation light, enjoying the extra contact with his mate even if\nit were just their knees. &ldquo;Ana and Jarvis.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Alright\nthen.&rdquo; Tony leaned in and pushed their foreheads together, inhaling\ndeep to taste the pine and rosewood of his Alpha&rsquo;s scent, eyes\nfalling shut when Steve sighed in contentment.</p><p>\nThey\nwere only talking, mundane conversation about their home and favorite\ncolors and for heaven&rsquo;s sake they were barely touching knees and now\nforeheads, scenting each other as they wanted but nothing terribly\n<i>real</i>, nothing <i>intense </i>after his Alpha had whispered that they had\ntime, that they should wait just a bit.</p><p>\nThey\nwere only <i>talking </i>but Steve&rsquo;s scent was heavy with desire anyway,\nperfumed rose and heady pine dragging with a heat that had Tony\ntongue tied and feeling antsy, mouth tingling with the need to <i>taste\n</i>and fingers itching with the want to <i>know</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;Tell\nme about Ana and Jarvis.&rdquo; Steve couldn&rsquo;t ignore the sudden thread\nof <i>spice </i>in the air, the Omega&rsquo;s scent sharpening in arousal, in\nreadiness and he bit back a groan. &ldquo;Omega&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Take\nyour shirt off first.&rdquo; Tony ordered more than asked, and since neither one of them\nwas willing to lean away and break contact, Steve unbuttoned his\nshirt as best he could with their foreheads still together, the\nstitches at his shoulders tearing as he forced the material off and\naway.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Shit</i>.&rdquo;\nHe didn&rsquo;t mean to curse, didn&rsquo;t want to sully his Omega&rsquo;s ears with\nlanguage like that but there wasn&rsquo;t a word that wasn&rsquo;t profanity that\ncould come close to describing how good it felt when Tony spread his\nfingers as far as they could go over Steve&rsquo;s heart, when they trailed\ndown his ribs and dug into his sides. &ldquo;Tony&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My\nAlpha.&rdquo; Tony felt&nbsp;suddenly, distinctly,\n<i>wantonly </i>slick between his legs and squeezed his thighs together in an attempt at hiding it, a useless attempt judging by the way Steve&rsquo;s gaze hazed red. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re gorgeous. Oh my.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\n&ldquo;You\nsaid Beta&rsquo;s raised you.&rdquo; Steve reminded him, stilling Tony&rsquo;s hand when it headed towards the\nfastens of his trousers. &ldquo;We&ndash;We have time, my love. We can wait. Tell me about\nyour friends Ana and Jarvis.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Ana\nand Jarvis are saints.&rdquo; Tony dipped his head to lick experimentally\nat the hollow of Steve&rsquo;s throat, thrilling over the Alpha&rsquo;s answering\nwhine. &ldquo;Jarvis taught me how to use the stars to find my way and how\nto tie knots and use a sword and Ana&ndash;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Steve\nmoaned aloud over the dig of fangs at his collarbone. &ldquo;Ana taught\nme how to make bread and how to mend clothes and how to garden. They\nwere both determined I wouldn&rsquo;t grow up useless, and never missed\nan opportunity to tell me that just because I was <i>spoiled </i>didn&rsquo;t\nmean someone would always be there to bring me food.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\n&ldquo;They\nsound practical and boring.&rdquo; Steve informed him, panting with the\neffort of conversation when he&rsquo;d much rather be pinning his mate to\nthe blankets and losing himself in another moment entirely.&nbsp;&ldquo;No fun at all.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ever let Ana hear\nthat.&rdquo; Tony sassed back. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll send you out to the yard to beat rugs or something\nequally awful.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\n&ldquo;I\nthink I&rsquo;m big enough to beat any rugs your Ana sends me for.&rdquo; the\nAlpha nosed at Tony&rsquo;s cheek so the Omega would sit back and look at\nhim. &ldquo;Do you have a favorite food?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Apples.&rdquo;\nTony&rsquo;s smile was <i>brilliant</i>, fangs on full display and Steve thought\nhe could have melted from how beautiful it was. &ldquo;I love apples.\nPlain or with cinnamon, baked into pies or served over meat, I love\napple cider and apple sauce and anything else along those lines.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;We\nhave apple orchards at the castle.&rdquo; Steve rubbed his thumb along\nTony&rsquo;s bottom lip. &ldquo;<i>Acres </i>of them. Green and red and this mixed\napple our gardeners were working on when I left, something pink and\ncrisp, I only had it once but I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s amazing, you would love\nit. When I bring you home with me&ndash;&rdquo; He fit his palm to the back of\nTony&rsquo;s neck, pressing purposefully over the bonding mark and rumbling\nin satisfaction when the Omega automatically arched into it, tipping\nhis head back to offer more of himself.</p><p>&ldquo;How\ndo I scent to you, Omega?&rdquo; Steve forgot all about <i>apples </i>as Tony melted\nforward into his chest, notched his nose into the curve of Steve&rsquo;s\nthroat and hummed against his skin. &ldquo;Do I scent&ndash; I know we match,\nobviously our scents match, but do you <i>like </i>it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You\nscent like rosewood.&rdquo; Tony crooned into the Alpha&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;Rosewood\nlike what I work with in my shop and pine trees like the ones that\ngrow outside my window. And you scent warm.&rdquo; he tried to get closer\nstill. &ldquo;You scent warm and I feel as if I&rsquo;ve been cold for my\nentire life. Didn&rsquo;t realize how cold I was until you made me feel\nwarm.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Mmm,\nmy love.&rdquo; Steve whispered, playing at the hem of Tony&rsquo;s blouse but\nnot daring to lift it without permission. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll always keep you\nwarm, don&rsquo;t you worry.&rdquo;</p><p>\nTony\nhesitated, kneading his fingers into the muscle at Steve&rsquo;s shoulder\nand biting his lip nervously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a little&ndash; I&rsquo;m a little cold\nnow. Would you hold me a tighter? Closer?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;\nThe blue eyes flared red for a second before the Alpha got himself\nunder control. &ldquo;Yes sweetheart, come here. Right here.&rdquo;</p><p>\nBig\nhands up and under Tony&rsquo;s legs and he gave a startled yelp when the\nAlpha picked him up as if he didn&rsquo;t weigh anything at all, lifting\nhim right off the blanket and onto his lap and suddenly they were\nmuch closer than they&rsquo;d been before, mouths nearly meeting with each\nbreath, eyes wide as they stared from just a few inches\naway.</p><p>\nTony\nalmost bit through his lip when he settled firm onto the Alpha&rsquo;s\nthighs, rocking forward experimentally, <i>instinctively</i>, shuddering\nwhen he felt the Alpha&rsquo;s cock already hard beneath him.&nbsp;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Omega.&rdquo;\nSteve groaned over the welcome weight, palming over the tempting\ncurve of his mate&rsquo;s rear and feeling the way the yellow pants strained\ntight now that Tony&rsquo;s legs were open, knees spread on either side of\nSteve&rsquo;s waist. &ldquo;You feel good.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\n&ldquo;You\nwant me.&rdquo; Tony whispered into his mate&rsquo;s ear, feeling the thick\nlength twitching against the underside of his thigh and hiding a secret, proud smile that he&rsquo;d brought his Alpha to such a state with so little effort. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Tell\nme&ndash;&rdquo; Even half drunk on Omega scent, Steve tried his damnedest to\nwait, to give his mate the time he&rsquo;d promised. &ldquo;Do you like\nmusic?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\n&ldquo;I\nlove to sing.&rdquo; Being this close to his Alpha helped to settle the\n<i>wild </i>coursing through Tony&rsquo;s veins, the aggravating <i>empty </i>that seemed\nto grow worse the longer he wasn&rsquo;t with the Alpha\nthe way he needed to be. &ldquo;And play the piano. I can sing better\nthan I play though. What about you?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\n&ldquo;My\nma sings like an angel.&rdquo; Steve bent the Omega&rsquo;s back into a\ngraceful arch and suckled at his earlobe, tracing the shell with the\ntip of his tongue and blowing warm across the damp skin to make his\nmate shiver. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t so much <i>sing </i>as I do yowl like a long\ntailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\nTony\nclapped a hand over his mouth to muffle his laughter, shoulders\nshaking and eyes sparkling with mirth. &ldquo;Charming.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\n&ldquo;My singing\nis entirely un-charming&rdquo;\n<i>God</i>, Steve loved the sound of his mate&rsquo;s laughter. &ldquo;But I do love to\ndraw and one day after we&rsquo;re officially mated, I&rsquo;m going to lay\nyou out in the sunshine and draw every inch of your beautiful&ndash;&rdquo; he\nsighed when Tony wriggled closer. &ldquo;&ndash;<i>perfect</i>&ndash;&rdquo; dragging his\nfingers down Tony&rsquo;s back to smooth over his hips and the barest\ninch lower. &ldquo;&ndash;<i>gorgeous</i>&ndash;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Wait.&rdquo;\nTony leaned away and put his hand over the Alpha&rsquo;s mouth before he\ncould finish. &ldquo;Wait, wait before you say whatever you&rsquo;re going to say,\nI need&ndash;&rdquo; he paused, playing with the buttons on his blouse. &ldquo;I\nneed to show you something.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Anything.&rdquo;&nbsp;Steve\nsaid immediately, honestly. &ldquo;You can tell me anything at all, my\nmate.&rdquo;</p><p>\nTony\nundid the garment slowly, not missing the way the Alpha&rsquo;s eyes\nwidened a little more at every bit of skin exposed but still\nhesitating before opening his shirt entirely to show Steve the mark\non his chest. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not scars, I wasn&rsquo;t hurt, it&rsquo;s just a birth\nmark. And I know it&rsquo;s ugly and I keep it hidden all the time but I\nthought&ndash; if you say you want to draw me you should know ahead of\ntime&ndash;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Whoever\ntold you this was ugly?&rdquo; Steve&rsquo;s hand was so big it covered the\nbirthmark completely from edge to edge when he spread it over Tony&rsquo;s\nheart. &ldquo;Why do you hide it?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Well,\nbecause it looks like&ndash;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\n&ldquo;It\nlooks like the stars themselves were jealous the night you were\nborn.&rdquo; Steve whispered. &ldquo;And fell from heaven to make their home\nhere on your heart so you would never outshine them.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\n&ldquo;But\nI&ndash;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\n&ldquo;It\nobviously didn&rsquo;t work.&rdquo; he continued, leaning in to touch a\nsoft kiss to the birthmark. &ldquo;Your eyes are brighter than star shine\nand your smile enough to shame the sun. You are perfect in every way,\nand having a piece of heaven on your heart just confirms it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;\nTony brushed his fingers over Steve&rsquo;s jaw, swallowing when the\nAlpha turned his head into the touch. &ldquo;Have you&ndash; have you ever\nheard the story about the child born beneath star fall?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\n&ldquo;No.&rdquo;\nSteve traced the lines of star burst curiously, the rough pads of his\nfingertips spreading goosebumps across Tony&rsquo;s skin. &ldquo;Is it a story I should know?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Is\nthere a reason beyond wanderings you ended up here, close to the\nriver right now?&rdquo; Tony asked instead and a wrinkle of confusion crossed his\nAlpha&rsquo;s brow. &ldquo;Because of a Prince coming of age or anything like\nthat?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;No,\nsweetheart.&rdquo; Steve shook his head. &ldquo;No, nothing like that. I\nheard there was a castle a few days ride from the river but I hadn&rsquo;t\ndecided to stop there yet. Why? What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n&ldquo;It\ndoesn&rsquo;t matter right now.&rdquo; Tony decided, because some things were\nmore important than old stories and legends, things like the way\nSteve was staring at him with nothing but pure honesty and adoration,\nadmiration, and something that already looked an awful lot like <i>love</i>.\n&ldquo;Kiss me.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;re\nsure?&rdquo; Steve cupped Tony&rsquo;s jaw and stared deep into his eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be <i>lost</i>,\nOmega, do you know? I won&rsquo;t be able to kiss you and stop, I&rsquo;ll\nwant all of you. Every <i>bit </i>of you. We can wait. We can talk more if\nyou have more questions or we could just wrap up in a blanket so I\ncan hold you&ndash; sweetheart, I&rsquo;d love to just <i>hold\n</i>you&ndash;&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Kiss\nme.&rdquo; Tony fit tighter into the Alpha&rsquo;s lap, wove his fingers into\nthe blond hair and tugged until the blue eyes slid dark red and\nwhispered, &ldquo;My Alpha. <i>Mate</i>.\nKiss me.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;re\nsure.&rdquo; Steve asked again, just one more time and this time when\nTony nodded Steve leaned in and pressed their mouths together in a\nchaste kiss. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of you, my love. I promise I will.\nWe&rsquo;ll learn how to do this together, hm?&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n&ldquo;Together.&rdquo;\nTony repeated, and pursed his lips for another kiss, a <i>better </i>kiss\nthat his mate gave him readily, happily, with all the pent energy of\nan Alpha who had been waiting far too long.</p><p>\nAnd\nwhen Steve lay them out on the blanket, pinned his Omega to their bed\nand stretched out on top to kiss him breathless, everything <i>else\n</i>slipped away from Tony&ndash; the stress and the uncertainty, the worry of\nbeing caught by Sunset&rsquo;s men and the confusion over a prophecy he&rsquo;d\nalways thought was a fairy tale&ndash; \n</p><p>&ndash;It\nall slipped away until the only thing Tony knew was the taste of his\nmate, the feel of his Alpha, and the scent of wild flowers as they\nburst into bloom beneath the night sky. \n</p><p>******************</p><p>\nSteve\nwas too intent on listening to the pleased purr from his Omega to put\nany thought into why flowers were <i>blooming </i>all the sudden, but he did\nreach over and pluck one anyway, tucking it behind Tony&rsquo;s ear and\nkissing the pleased grin from his mate&rsquo;s mouth.</p><p>\n&ldquo;You\nare incredible.&rdquo; he whispered, dipping past lovely lips to delve\ninto the warmth beneath, swallowing Tony&rsquo;s surprised moan with a\ngreedier noise of his own and sliding an arm under the trim waist to\nget the Omega right up into his body. They just weren&rsquo;t close enough,\nnot yet, not with clothes still on but <i>oh </i>it helped when Tony hitched\nan ankle around Steve&rsquo;s calf and canted his hips, rubbing against him\nlanguidly.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Omega.&rdquo;\nThe Alpha rumbled and Tony trilled something sweet and <i>wanting </i>into\nhis ear, following it up with a sharp dart of fangs that had Steve\nmaking a thoroughly undignified noise and Tony huffed a laugh when\nthe blonde tried to cover it with a sexier one.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Charming.&rdquo;\nHe teased and Steve licked a long line up his throat to growl,\n&ldquo;<i>Yours</i>.&rdquo; subsequently ruining anything else sassy Tony might have\nthought to say, the Omega simply looping his arms tight around his\nmate&rsquo;s neck and pulling him down for another and another and\nanother kiss because <i>yes yes yes</i> this Alpha was his.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Can\nI touch you here?&rdquo; The Alpha ran his hand the length of a lean\nthigh and up to the fastens of the yellow trousers. &ldquo;My mate, can I\ntake these off?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\nTony\nnodded because he didn&rsquo;t think he could talk but Steve urged him, &ldquo;I need you to tell\nme yes or tell me no but I need to hear it, sweetheart need\nto know what you want. Just because our scents match doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m\ngoing to assume everything is a <i>yes</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Charming.&rdquo;\nTony said again, but this time he meant it, lifting his hips when the\nAlpha passed just lightly over the front of his pants, barely any\npressure at all over where his cock was straining against the cloth,\nstaining it damp because he <i>wanted </i>so badly.</p><p>\n&ldquo;I\nwant you.&rdquo; Tony keened over another pass of Steve&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Alpha\nAlpha please&ndash; please touch me&ndash; Yes, the answer is yes&ndash; it&rsquo;s <i>yes</i>&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>\nIt\ntook all of Steve&rsquo;s self control to not rip the garment right in\nhalf, all of his self control to not lose his mind as he\npeeled the cloth down long legs and tossed it aside and he could\nfinally <i>properly </i>see every inch of the Omega meant to be his mate. \n</p><p>\nHe\ncould cover his Omega entirely with just one hand, the delicate\nlength flushed red and hard with a gentle curve Steve wanted to learn with his mouth and again with his lips and over and over with his fingers.</p><p>Tony cried out at the first real\ntouch, back arching and mouth falling open, sobbing something <i>pleading </i>when the Alpha stroked over him and he\nwas <i>soaked </i>between his thighs, slick mixing with warm vanilla and\nsharply scented cloves. Steve couldn&rsquo;t bear to take his hand away for several minutes, not with the way Tony writhed and gasped and arced\ninto every touch, but finally he couldn&rsquo;t fight the need to taste and he let go with a near regretful sigh, despite knowing what was waiting for him even lower.</p><p>\nTony\nwhimpered when Steve let go, but it slid into a gasp when the Alpha\nparted his knees and slid two fingers through the clear <i>wet</i>, sticking\nthem far in his mouth and groaning as though he were <i>starving</i>. \n</p><p>\n&ldquo;You\ntaste like&ndash;&rdquo; Steve didn&rsquo;t have words, there were <i>no words</i> that\nwould suffice, but he went back for more, three fingers this\ntime and used it to ease the way up Tony&rsquo;s cock, bending low to kiss\nhim and loving ever desperate pant and needy whine from his\nOmega, murmuring quiet, <i>filthy </i>encouragement when Tony thrust up into\nhis palm.</p><p>\n&ldquo;I\nthink I might die if I can&rsquo;t feel you.&rdquo; Tony begged. &ldquo;Alpha, my\nmate, I need&ndash; please please please&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m\nhere, I&rsquo;m right here.&rdquo; Steve didn&rsquo;t let go of Tony but sat back\nonto his heels and guided the Omega&rsquo;s small hand to the front of his\ntrousers, his head falling back at the first tentative touch. &ldquo;<i>Yes\n</i>my Omega, right there&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;re\nso big.&rdquo; Tony choked out. &ldquo;Christ, how will you fit inside me?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll\nfit.&rdquo; Steve undid his buttons and lifted his cock free, slotting it\nnext to Tony&rsquo;s and reveling in the openly <i>shocked </i>noise that came\nfrom his mate, the fresh pass of slick that filled the air. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll\nbe slow and I&rsquo;ll be so gentle, I&rsquo;ll be so gentle with you my love and\nif you don&rsquo;t like it, if you don&rsquo;t like me inside&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;God, how could I <i>not</i>&ndash;&rdquo; Tony raked his nails down the Alpha&rsquo;s back to grab\nhim closer, rocking up impatiently.</p><p>\n&ldquo;&ndash;but\nif you <i>do</i>, if you hate the feel of me inside you, I&rsquo;ll stop. We&rsquo;ll\nstop and I&rsquo;ll hold you and we&rsquo;ll sleep because it won&rsquo;t change a\nthing.&rdquo; Steve swore. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t change a thing between us, you are\nmy mate and we have <i>time</i>&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;I\ndon&rsquo;t want time though.&rdquo; Tony crushed their mouths together, not\nletting up until his Alpha was growling against his lips, rocking\ninto him insistently. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want time, I want you now. <i>Please</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m yours.&rdquo; Steve slid his hand over\nthat lovely rear, down into the cleft between well rounded cheeks,\nlower and <i>lower </i>until his fingers found the tightly furled entrance\ndripping with slick, the muscle relaxing at the first experimental\npress of his finger. &ldquo;You have me, no matter what. I&rsquo;m yours, your\nmate, Omega.&rdquo; \n</p><p>&ldquo;Mine.&rdquo; Glee so potent it was nearly\n<i>giddy </i>had a pleased smile creasing Tony&rsquo;s face, lighting his eyes\nup and rippling sweet through his scent. <i>He&rsquo;d never had anything that\nwas just his</i>. &ldquo;My mate, my very own Prince Charming.&rdquo; \n</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Yours</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>\nTony\nwas tight and so <i>so </i>hot inside when Steve opened him around one\nfinger, but greedy, so greedy, bearing down on the intrusion and almost immediate rocking\nup in an obvious, anxious ask for another.</p><p>\n&ldquo;More,\nmy love?&rdquo; \n</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.\n<i>Yes </i>more, I didn&rsquo;t know I needed&ndash; Alpha&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>\nSteve\ncould already feel his rut descending, his vision sharpening and\nnarrowing until all he could see was the whiskey and gold of his\nmate&rsquo;s eyes and the glint off the perfect little fangs. Tony&rsquo;s \nlittle cry at the feel of two fingers made Steve want to roar, the\nway the Omega clung to him, scratching his nails down Steve&rsquo;s chest\nand around to his side, canting his hips up and rolling his body to\ndrag them deeper.</p><p>\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;re\nso small.&rdquo; Steve was suddenly terrified at how tight Tony\nfelt even around two fingers, thinking there was no way for his\nlittle mate to ever be able to take all of him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ll\nbreak you.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;I\nwon&rsquo;t break.&rdquo; The words cracked over a shaky sigh at\nthe stretch of three. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t break me, we&rsquo;re made for each\nother. <i>Mates</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Mates.&rdquo;\nSteve repeated, leaning far over and sealing their lips together,\nexploring Tony&rsquo;s mouth in hungry licks and little nibbles. &ldquo;My\nmate. <i>Mine</i>.

With his other hand he explored the lines of star light\non Tony&rsquo;s chest, smoothed away curls from his mates forehead and\nrubbed soothing circles over the bare bonding spot.</p><p>\nTony\nlinked their fingers together and Steve stretched his mates arms out\nabove his head, pinning them to the blankets and admiring the lines \nof his Omega&rsquo;s body, learning the arc of his back and the span of each\nbreath, the hollow of Tony&rsquo;s throat and the dip of his navel and when\nTony&rsquo;s breath caught over a particularly good push deep in his core,\nSteve shifted back to try and find that spot again, the one that made\nhis mates eyes flash and body tighten and &ndash;</p><p><i>\nThere</i>.\nTony gave a needy little sob and Steve rumbled something <i>amazed </i>because he&rsquo;d never seen an Omega like this before, never could have\n<i>imagined </i>an Omega like this, spread open and wanting as he took Steve deeper with every push,\ngasping for his Alpha and demanding <i>more</i>, flushing beautifully up over his chest and into his cheeks as Steve drove into the same spot over and over\nuntil the Omega was a trembling mess beneath him.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Do\nyou want all of me?&rdquo; Steve grasped at a narrow hip\nand thrust <i>harder </i>now as his knot started to swell, the edge of it\ncatching the rim of Tony&rsquo;s entrance and making both Alpha and Omega stammer through each stroke, breath stuttering with every tug. &ldquo;Can I knot you, my mate?&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;<i>Yes</i>.&rdquo;\nTony moaned, nearly coming off the blanket as the swelling knot\ncaught for a split second before giving again. &ldquo;Yes, yes I want all\nof you, my mate, <i>mine</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Mine</i>.&rdquo;\nSteve repeated, voice nothing more than a growl as he got closer\nto his release, leaning back over Tony&rsquo;s body to pull over his cock\nwith sure strokes, mindful to keep the maddening rhythm deep inside\nTony&rsquo;s center just <i>right </i>to have his Omega hovering on the edge.\n&ldquo;You are <i>mine</i>, Omega.&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Alpha.&rdquo;\nTony&rsquo;s cries of satisfaction slid towards frustration, his legs wrapping around Steve&rsquo;s waist as he tried to lift into each thrust, trying to get the Alpha deeper or fuller&ndash; he didn&rsquo;t know exactly what he needed but he knew his Alpha wasn&rsquo;t giving him <i>enough </i>yet. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t&ndash; I\nneed more, give me more&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve\ngot you, lovely&rdquo; Steve&rsquo;s knot was catching every stroke now, stuck\ninside the Omega&rsquo;s sweet body for a little longer each time before\ngiving free and with a snarl of impatience, Steve pinned Tony to the\nblanket, ground their hips together until his knot swelled full size\nand locked tight.</p><p>\n&ldquo;Alpha!&rdquo; That was all it took, the heavy weight of a full knot, and Tony <i>screamed </i>his release into the night air, cock spilling white all\nover his stomach and Steve&rsquo;s fist, pooling in his navel and dripping off his sides into the blankets, his center tightening, tensing, clenching down around the Alpha.&nbsp;</p><p>He was still lost in white hot rapture when Steve surged forward and sank his teeth in over Tony&rsquo;s bonding mark, fangs puncturing clear skin and pouring pheromone laced blood into the Alpha&rsquo;s mouth.&nbsp;</p><p>Tony cried out again, pure joy and sweet satisfaction and the Alpha groaned in response, cock swelling impossibly bigger for a few seconds before he was losing himself as well, pouring wet inside his Omega,\nrutting through each pulse and letting a possessive growl vibrate\nthrough his chest and into his mate.</p><p>\nTony\nshuddered through another peak before the first had even fully\nfinished, his body shattering apart around mind blanking and\nleaving him barely lucid, barely breathing as the Alpha rocked\nthrough the last few waves.</p><p>\n&ldquo;My\nmate.&rdquo; Steve&rsquo;s voice was still little more than a growl as he\nunlocked his jaw and licked gently over the sluggishly bleeding bite mark.\n&ldquo;My mate, my Omega&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Mmm,\nmy <i>mate</i>.&rdquo; Tony whispered tiredly, carding his fingers through\nSteve&rsquo;s hair and bringing him down for a long kiss, shivering over\nthe lingering taste of himself on the Alpha&rsquo;s lips, the iron tinge of\nblood on the hooked fangs.</p><p>\n&ldquo;You\nare perfect.&rdquo; Steve told him. &ldquo;Beautiful.

                "content": "<p>So I always thought Steve would be the one to die and sacrifice himself. Not that I wanted him dead specifically, but it made more sense imo. And I could see him actually dying throughout the movie - it wouldn&rsquo;t be obvious, the camera wouldn&rsquo;t focus on these little details, they would all happen in the background so we wouldn&rsquo;t really notice them: Steve trying to hide a bout of coughing, Steve being out of breath after a training, Steve being slower, Steve not healing as quickly as he used to heal, Steve squinting his eyes occasionally. The serum wouldn&rsquo;t work as well as it used to, as if it slowly wore off. And towards the end of the movie, we would&rsquo;ve had a scene with Tony finding out the truth.
