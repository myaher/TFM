You decide who she chooses\ud83d\ude40 xx",
        "answer": "<p>You always had a crush on Harry. I mean who wouldn\u2019t? <br/>Your parents were friends with Anne, you\u2019ve known the Styles family since forever and Harry had always been a good friend, when you guys saw each other. That little crush had quickly changed when you got into that certain age where boys weren\u2019t just boys but became more interesting and there you found yourself being head over heels in love with Harry Styles who soon became a huge superstar, traveling the whole world. <br/>You had always been in contact and in between the hiatus of his band One Direction and the start of his solo career the two of you again spend more time with each other, as he was in England again. You saw each other every few weeks for dinner or just for something to drink. <br/>You never were one of the girls who would just take what she wants. You were one of those girl who would wait for the boy to do the first move. That didn\u2019t seem to work with Harry. He was always very polite, also flirty on some days but he never made one step further and so you just enjoyed spending time with him - in that moment you were totally fine with it. <br/>Until he met his new girlfriend. A tall, blonde, perfect model. It broke your heart deep down. You knew you had missed your chance, the chance of Harry finally being more than just someone you would have dinner now and than, Harry finally being more than just a acquaintance. <br/>As soon as Harry got his girlfriend the two of you stopped seeing each other. He had more to do with his own work, and his girlfriend also took a lot of time, and you decided to not bother him anymore.\u00a0</p><p>After a few months you met someone very special. Brad. He was funny, he was nice and he looked damn good. You fell in love, head over heels just like you did with Harry. But this time you didn\u2019t miss your chance and shortly after Brad became your boyfriend. You very the happiest you had been in such a long time. You felt so safe around him, so comfortable and loved. And you really did love him as well. It was the first boy you really had a relationship with, not just a crush. You really loved him and soon you forgot about Harry and the crush you have had. <br/>It wasn\u2019t until that one night he stood in front of your door, in the middle of the night. You had just come home from a night with your girlfriends, your boyfriend already in bed when he texted you saying he was outside. <br/>Never in a million years you thought he would just show up, you always imagined seeing him at a fancy restaurant or something like that.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d, you asked after your opened the door with a light smile on your face. But that smile disappeared as soon as you looked into his eyes. They were puffy and red - he had cried. <br/>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d, you asked confused and full of worry. You had never seen Harry like this before. <br/>\u201cIt\u2019s - I broke up with her.\u201d, he stumbled. You felt bad, you felt so bad and wanted to shove him inside, but you were afraid of Brad waking up to you and Harry in the living room so you stepped outside and shut the door behind you, after grabbing your keys. <br/>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d, you asked, still confused. <br/>\u201cI just don\u2019t love her. I never really had. In the beginning I had feelings - she\u2019s a great girl. But she\u2019s just not the one. I guess I\u2019m just not able to actually love and being in a relationship.\u201d, he said, then running a hand over his face. <br/>You felt bad, you felt so sorry for him. Even though you hadn\u2019t seen each other quite a bit, you still cared for him and you didn\u2019t wanted to see him like that. <br/>\u201cDon\u2019t say that. You\u2019ll find someone, you\u2019ll find the one Harry. I always thought I would be alone until the day I die and now look at me.\u201d, you chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019ll find someone great.\u201d, you said. <br/>Harry sighted. \u201cI should have never let you go.\u201d<br/>You didn\u2019t know what to say and at first you didn\u2019t really understand what he meant. <br/>\u201cWhat?\u201d, you asked. \u201cI had a crush on you Y/n. I mean I still have. All the time but I thought this would never work out, that you probably never wanted to be with me, like as my girlfriend.\u201d, he said. You swallowed hard, your cheeks getting red. <br/>\u201cWell I thought the same about you.\u201d, you said after a moment. <br/>\u201cYou <i>thought</i>.\u201d, Harry said more to himself than to you. <br/>\u201cLook Harry - Brad\u2019s a great guy, I\u2019m really happy with him and - I\u2019m sorry.\u201d, you said quietly. Harry nodded. \u201cI know - I know.\u201d, then he ran a hand through his hair. \u201cI\u2019m sorry - I shouln\u2019t have come in the first place.\u201d, he said and was about to take off. <br/>\u201cHarry wait. I don\u2019t want to not see you again for like another 5 months. I care about you and I want us to be friends again.\u201d <br/>It was like Harrys jaw tightened at the word <i>friends </i>but he nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d, he said quietly. \u201cI\u2019ll text you.\u201d, he said, then he was gone and there you were thinking about if you once again made the wrong choice or if it was the right way just following your guts. <br/></p><p><br/></p><hr><p><br/></p><p><i>Hope you like it xx <br/></i></p><p><a href=\"https://cthhesimvgines.tumblr.com/post/177700613150/masterlist\"><i>masterlist</i></a><br/></p>",
