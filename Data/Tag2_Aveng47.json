She bid her life on it.\u201d</p><p>Steve lowers his head, eyes closed in an effort to stem the tears streaming down his face. Bruce gives a terrible, heartbreaking roar, and as Steve looks up to watch the bench go flying over the lake he feels a flare of white-hot anger at the sight of the sheer stillness of the water.</p><p>How\u00a0<i>dare</i>\u00a0the earth look this good when she is not here to see it? How\u00a0<i>dare</i>\u2014</p><p>\u201cWe have to make it worth it,\u201d Bruce says, and as Steve stands to meet his eyes he feels an aching determination start to form in his stomach.</p><p><i>Where else am I gonna get a view like this?</i></p><p>\u201cWe will.\u201d</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>Clint finds him after they\u2019ve all shuffled inside, a slightly sheepish look on his face.</p><p>\u201cWhen we\u2014when this is all over, and we put the stones back,\u201d he mumbles, fingers jammed inside his pockets, \u201cI\u2014um, I don\u2019t think I can\u2014I just can\u2019t go back there\u2014&quot;</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Steve says softly, a sense of resolve settling in his gut. \u201cI\u2019ll do it. I want to\u2014I want to talk to her, say a real goodbye.\u201d</p><p>Clint looks up, the pain in his face a direct replica of the one currently tearing its way through Steve\u2019s heart. \u201cShe loved you, you know.\u201d</p><p>The grief writhing in Steve\u2019s stomach like a monstrous parasite starts thrashing even harder, and even though Clint\u2019s eyes are kind Steve finds it inordinately difficult to meet them. \u201cShe loved all of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you, especially\u2014you helped her, a lot. She told me what she told you, what you did for her. You were there for her, all those years, when I\u2014when I wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Steve gives him a sad, knowing smile and shakes his head. \u201cDon\u2019t beat yourself up for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I had just\u2014we could\u2019ve had more time\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know,\u201d Steve says resolutely. \u201cNone of us did. Trust me, if I had, things would be different right now.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0&mdash;</p><p>Vormir is\u00a0<i>freezing</i>.</p><p>It\u2019s the first time he has been truly alone since the Quantum realm, and as he climbs, the icy ground crunching beneath his boots, Steve feels a dull hollow start to expand inside of him. It is achingly painful and he ignores it, even as it becomes harder and harder to disregard\u2014he does not want to be alone with it, does not want to confront the dark abyss that has appeared where Natasha once was.</p><p>She had climbed this mountain, too; she might have even taken this path. His feet could be landing where hers did, minutes earlier.</p><p>They\u2019d climbed a similar one, on Earth, back before the snap, before the world seemed so irreparably full of despair, and she\u2019d joked about going rock climbing sometime, to see which of them could scale a wall faster. They had never gone\u2014and now he would never know\u2014</p><p>He thinks he might be hallucinating, because every now and then he thinks he can see her, shivering but still excited, cracking jokes and smiles with her old friend, completely unaware of the terrible bargain awaiting her at the top.</p><p>The cliff comes slowly into view, the top surrounded by swirling clouds and what looks like smoke, and as he stares at the sky Steve sends a brief prayer of thanks to his past self for leaving the soul stone for the end. Ice and snow coat every inch of the ground, and the temperature seems to drop with every step he takes.</p><p>The suitcase in his hand seems to grow heavier as he approaches the top, and his grief is briefly replaced by unease as a black, shadowy figure begins to form in front of him. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cSteven Rogers\u201d, the figure says, his voice sending a burst of adrenaline through Steve\u2019s veins, \u201cSon of\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d Steve snarls, fingers curling into a fist.</p><p>\u201cMe,\u201d Red Skull says calmly, floating forward so that his face, as grotesque as ever, is brought into the dim light of the sky. \u00a0\u201cWelcome\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI killed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u00a0<i>thought</i>\u00a0you killed me, just as you\u00a0thought\u00a0you killed HYDRA. But I am not dead; instead, I have been assigned to a fate far less desirable\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave it,\u201d Steve says roughly, ignoring the pounding in his chest. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid you are too late,\u201d the Skull says softly. \u201cYour friends have already gone.\u201d</p><p>The double meaning of the word is not lost on him.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he says, trying to ignore the fresh grief that has just jolted through his body. \u201cI\u2019m from the future. I\u2019m here to return the stone. And to take her back. A soul for a soul, right? That was the deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is nothing that can be done. Surely Barton told you? It is irreversible.\u201d</p><p>And he knows, he\u00a0<i>knows</i>, he has known since Clint\u2019s knees buckled in front of his eyes, but there is something in him that keeps him fighting even though he knows it is futile.</p><p>\u201cThen take me. Take me instead\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will not. What\u2019s done is done. You may keep the stone\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u00a0<i>want</i>\u00a0the stone, I want<i>\u00a0her</i>.&ldquo;</p><p>The man that was once Johann Schmidt merely looks at him, an almost detached look on his face. \u201cIs this love, Captain Rogers?\u201d</p><p>Steve laughs, a bitter, hollow sound that rings through the nothingness around them. \u201c<i>Love</i>.\u00a0Nothing more than an empty, meaningless word when you\u2019re too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you knew you were going to be too late,\u201d Red Skull says quietly. \u201cAnd you came anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Steve says, voice cracking slightly. \u201cI wanted to make things right, as much as I can. She spent her whole life thinking she was alone. I\u2019m not gonna let her die that way, too.\u201d</p><p>There is a moment of silence before Red Skull speaks. \u201cFor what it\u2019s worth,\u201d he almost murmurs, \u201cShe did not die alone. Her friend\u2014Barton\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Steve mutters, ignoring the pang in his heart as Clint\u2019s grief-stricken face swims into his mind. \u201cBut I wanted to be here too. I couldn\u2019t\u2014if she\u2019s really gone\u2014 \u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat an honorable thing to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d Steve snarls, frustration seeping into his voice. \u201cShe was my anchor to this life, my guide through the labyrinth of moral ambiguity that is the present. I owe her this, at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man out of time,\u201d Red Skull says softly. \u201cYet somehow always cursed with too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>You</i>\u00a0did that,\u201d Steve spits, his nails digging deeper and deeper into his palm. \u201cI lost\u00a0<i>everything</i>\u00a0because of you. Everything. She showed me there was a purpose. That there\u2019s a reason to keep fighting. She gave me back my life. The least I can do is try and do the same for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is nothing you can do,\u201d Red Skull says simply, seemingly unaware of Steve\u2019s mounting anger. \u201cThe stone\u2014\u201d</p><p>Something snaps. \u201cI\u2014DON\u2019T\u2014CARE\u2014ABOUT\u2014THE\u2014STONE!\u201d he roars, slamming the case onto the ground. The latch breaks open, and the orange gleam of light that beams into the air sends another jolt of fury through Steve\u2019s body.</p><p>\u201cTake the stone,\u201d he snarls, both hands clenched tightly at his sides. \u201cTake it, and keep it for the next <i>sick</i> person who wants it for some\u00a0<i>revolting,\u00a0demented</i>\u00a0purpose\u2014I never want to see it again.\u201d</p><p>He stops, breathing heavily, and Red Skull holds his gaze steadily, a calm and indifferent look on his face.</p><p>Steve\u2019s voice is cold and eerily calm when he speaks again. \u201cI want her body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s down there. I can get it\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says softly, a strange glittering in his eyes. \u201cYou may talk to it, pay your respects. But you cannot take it. It must stay here, as a reminder of the sacrifice made for the stone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Steve growls, as another surge of anger washes over him. \u201cI\u2019m going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long way down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk.\u201d</p><p>The trek down the mountain is more painful, somehow, than the one up it. The cold silence, broken occasionally by a sharp gust of wind, becomes more unbearable with every step. He climbs downward, jaw clenched against the wind, and wonders briefly where the Skull lives when he isn\u2019t greeting people on the way to their deaths.</p><p>The trek down the mountain seems endless, but as Steve\u2019s feet hit solid ground and he sees the body crumpled at the foot of the cliff, it seems to come to an end much too quickly.</p><p>He approaches the body as if in slow motion, hardly daring to breathe, and as he catches a sight of achingly familiar red hair a sob starts to make its way out of his chest.</p><p>His knees buckle as he reaches her side and sees her face. Her eyes are closed\u2014he wonders if she\u2019d done that on purpose\u2014and her expression is so calm that if he didn\u2019t know better he\u2019d think she was simply pretending to sleep, ready to leap up and scare him at any moment.</p><p>Natasha, once so strong and full of life, is lying limp and broken in front of him, and despite himself he feels a wave of futile denial crash through his body.</p><p><i>See you in a minute,</i> she\u2019d said, her eyes dancing with excitement, so giddy that she\u2019d hardly been able to stand still in her suit.</p><p><i>See you in a minute</i>,\u00a0she\u2019d said, her face full of the first glimpse of genuine happiness he\u2019d seen from her in over five years. She\u2019d been so joyful, so relieved to have gotten her family back, so excited to be saving the world with them again.</p><p><i>See you in a minute</i>,\u00a0she\u2019d said, and then she\u2019d gone\u2014</p><p>He wonders what her last words were.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he murmurs, taking her cold, limp hand. Something hot starts to prickle behind his eyes. \u201cFor the record, when I told you to get a life, this was not what I meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just\u2014we just wanted to tell you: we did it. We won. Because of you.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t respond, and the silence gets more unbearable every second, so he starts talking. He tells her about the funeral, about the way Bruce threw a bench into the sky, and then he keeps going\u2014his voice breaks every few sentences, but he tells her about Bruce\u2019s snap, about the final, big, battle, about everyone coming back just in the nick of time, like they always do\u2014</p><p>He falters slightly when he gets to Tony.</p><p>\u201cI never\u2014I didn\u2019t realize until after\u2014I never really apologized to him. We just kind of moved on. I guess I thought, if we actually won, we\u2019d have the rest of our lives to fix things.\u201d</p><p>His eyes shut, ever so briefly.</p><p>\u201cI keep thinking about that, too. How I never say things until none of it means anything anymore. How little words mean when you\u2019re too late.\u201d</p><p>He sighs, trailing a finger along her cold, stiff palm. \u201cGrief and regret. They\u2019re like old enemies to me, now. I\u2019m no stranger to them. But it still hurts, every single time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose, objectively, that the cost we pay is nothing compared to what we get. But I look at the world we saved, the world we brought back, and I just\u2014I don\u2019t know if I have a place in it, anymore. It feels different without you.\u201d</p><p>Ice crystals are starting to form on her hair, and Steve runs a hand down a few strands, wiping them clean as much as he can.</p><p>\u201cFor you, it hasn\u2019t been that long since you\u2014since you fell. But for me, it\u2019s been days, and I really\u2014I just really, really miss you. You worked so hard to make me see that I belonged in that world, but\u2014I don\u2019t know, Nat, I think I always just belonged with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m gonna do. I wish you were here to tell me.\u201d</p><p>Her skin looks\u00a0so\u00a0pale in the shadow of the cliff.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, I know you can\u2019t hear me. And if you could, you\u2019d probably chew me out for walking a million miles in the snow just to talk to someone who can\u2019t respond. But I guess I just\u2014I didn\u2019t want you to be alone.\u201d</p><p>Her hand is freezing and unmoving in his, and his voice, hoarse and full of tears, fades away as his eyes rove over her pale, lifeless face. He lets the silence sit with them for what feels like hours, only moving when he feels his body start to go numb from the cold.</p><p>He buries her, there in the cold, his fingers scraping at the icy dirt in a sort of numb desperation. He finds a sharp rock to use as a spade and starts digging. The wind, unforgivingly harsh, bites at his skin as he works, but he hardly feels it at all\u2014he digs with a kind of cold fury, deeper and deeper into the cold, hard earth. He funnels his grief into work, just as he always has; he welcomes the sharp, physical pain of the cuts that form on his hands and lets it wash over the ache in his heart.</p><p>In that way, he thinks, they have always been similar.</p><p>In this world, time is of no consequence, and he is completely unaware of the amount of it that passes. He sinks deeper and deeper into the hole, fingers raw but always working, and when it finally seems deep enough he looks up to find that the sky looks exactly the same.</p><p>He lifts his companion, his guiding light, as gently as possible and lowers her into the grave, arranging her limbs so that she appears to be sleeping. As he straightens up, he remembers Tony\u2019s funeral\u2014the beauty of the lake and the sky, and the rows and rows of people, of families, all there to pay their respects.</p><p>And here she lies, in a rough, hand-dug hole in the ground on a completely foreign planet.</p><p>He covers her in the earth, eyes never leaving her body, and after she is completely obscured from view he reaches into his pocket.</p><p>The makeshift gravestone expands in his hand, whirring softly, and he leans over to tuck it into the earth near her head. He doesn\u2019t understand the technology, but Bruce had said that it would find roots in the ground, that it would work its way into the planet and stay there. A semblance of permanence, an eternal monument for the one who had given everything for the\u00a0chance\u00a0to make the world right again.</p><p>He glances at the stone, which is still buzzing steadily, and runs a final hand along the dirt beside it.</p><p>\u201cBye, Nat,\u201d he murmurs softly as he gets to his feet. \u201cWe miss you, and we\u2014I\u2014love you.\u201d</p><p>Long after Steve has disappeared back into the night, the humming stops. A completed marker stands, small but erect, at the head of a makeshift grave at the bottom of the cliff. It will stand there for the rest of eternity, for nobody and for everybody. On the surface of the stone, a hand-written conscription has taken form, carved painstakingly by a multitude of different hands. \u00a0</p><p><i>Here lies Natasha Romanoff,</i></p><p><i>One who would give everything and ask for nothing in return.</i></p><p><i>May the world remember her for who she was:</i></p><p><i>A spy, a hero, a friend.</i></p><p><i>A loved one.</i></p>",

She bid her life on it.\u201d</p><p>Steve lowers his head, eyes closed in an effort to stem the tears streaming down his face. Bruce gives a terrible, heartbreaking roar, and as Steve looks up to watch the bench go flying over the lake he feels a flare of white-hot anger at the sight of the sheer stillness of the water.</p><p>How\u00a0<i>dare</i>\u00a0the earth look this good when she is not here to see it? How\u00a0<i>dare</i>\u2014</p><p>\u201cWe have to make it worth it,\u201d Bruce says, and as Steve stands to meet his eyes he feels an aching determination start to form in his stomach.</p><p><i>Where else am I gonna get a view like this?</i></p><p>\u201cWe will.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>Clint finds him after they\u2019ve all shuffled inside, a slightly sheepish look on his face.</p><p>\u201cWhen we\u2014when this is all over, and we put the stones back,\u201d he mumbles, fingers jammed inside his pockets, \u201cI\u2014um, I don\u2019t think I can\u2014I just can\u2019t go back there\u2014\"</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Steve says softly, a sense of resolve settling in his gut. \u201cI\u2019ll do it. I want to\u2014I want to talk to her, say a real goodbye.\u201d</p><p>Clint looks up, the pain in his face a direct replica of the one currently tearing its way through Steve\u2019s heart. \u201cShe loved you, you know.\u201d</p><p>The grief writhing in Steve\u2019s stomach like a monstrous parasite starts thrashing even harder, and even though Clint\u2019s eyes are kind Steve finds it inordinately difficult to meet them. \u201cShe loved all of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you, especially\u2014you helped her, a lot. She told me what she told you, what you did for her. You were there for her, all those years, when I\u2014when I wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Steve gives him a sad, knowing smile and shakes his head. \u201cDon\u2019t beat yourself up for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I had just\u2014we could\u2019ve had more time\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know,\u201d Steve says resolutely. \u201cNone of us did. Trust me, if I had, things would be different right now.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u2014</p><p>Vormir is\u00a0<i>freezing</i>.</p><p>It\u2019s the first time he has been truly alone since the Quantum realm, and as he climbs, the icy ground crunching beneath his boots, Steve feels a dull hollow start to expand inside of him. It is achingly painful and he ignores it, even as it becomes harder and harder to disregard\u2014he does not want to be alone with it, does not want to confront the dark abyss that has appeared where Natasha once was.</p><p>She had climbed this mountain, too; she might have even taken this path. His feet could be landing where hers did, minutes earlier.</p><p>They\u2019d climbed a similar one, on Earth, back before the snap, before the world seemed so irreparably full of despair, and she\u2019d joked about going rock climbing sometime, to see which of them could scale a wall faster. They had never gone\u2014and now he would never know\u2014</p><p>He thinks he might be hallucinating, because every now and then he thinks he can see her, shivering but still excited, cracking jokes and smiles with her old friend, completely unaware of the terrible bargain awaiting her at the top.</p><p>The cliff comes slowly into view, the top surrounded by swirling clouds and what looks like smoke, and as he stares at the sky Steve sends a brief prayer of thanks to his past self for leaving the soul stone for the end. Ice and snow coat every inch of the ground, and the temperature seems to drop with every step he takes.</p><p>The suitcase in his hand seems to grow heavier as he approaches the top, and his grief is briefly replaced by unease as a black, shadowy figure begins to form in front of him. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cSteven Rogers\u201d, the figure says, his voice sending a burst of adrenaline through Steve\u2019s veins, \u201cSon of\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d Steve snarls, fingers curling into a fist.</p><p>\u201cMe,\u201d Red Skull says calmly, floating forward so that his face, as grotesque as ever, is brought into the dim light of the sky. \u00a0\u201cWelcome\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI killed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u00a0<i>thought</i>\u00a0you killed me, just as you\u00a0thought\u00a0you killed HYDRA. But I am not dead; instead, I have been assigned to a fate far less desirable\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave it,\u201d Steve says roughly, ignoring the pounding in his chest. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid you are too late,\u201d the Skull says softly. \u201cYour friends have already gone.\u201d</p><p>The double meaning of the word is not lost on him.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he says, trying to ignore the fresh grief that has just jolted through his body. \u201cI\u2019m from the future. I\u2019m here to return the stone. And to take her back. A soul for a soul, right? That was the deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is nothing that can be done. Surely Barton told you? It is irreversible.\u201d</p><p>And he knows, he\u00a0<i>knows</i>, he has known since Clint\u2019s knees buckled in front of his eyes, but there is something in him that keeps him fighting even though he knows it is futile.</p><p>\u201cThen take me. Take me instead\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will not. What\u2019s done is done. You may keep the stone\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u00a0<i>want</i>\u00a0the stone, I want<i>\u00a0her</i>.\u201c</p><p>The man that was once Johann Schmidt merely looks at him, an almost detached look on his face. \u201cIs this love, Captain Rogers?\u201d</p><p>Steve laughs, a bitter, hollow sound that rings through the nothingness around them. \u201c<i>Love</i>.\u00a0Nothing more than an empty, meaningless word when you\u2019re too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you knew you were going to be too late,\u201d Red Skull says quietly. \u201cAnd you came anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Steve says, voice cracking slightly. \u201cI wanted to make things right, as much as I can. She spent her whole life thinking she was alone. I\u2019m not gonna let her die that way, too.\u201d</p><p>There is a moment of silence before Red Skull speaks. \u201cFor what it\u2019s worth,\u201d he almost murmurs, \u201cShe did not die alone. Her friend\u2014Barton\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Steve mutters, ignoring the pang in his heart as Clint\u2019s grief-stricken face swims into his mind. \u201cBut I wanted to be here too. I couldn\u2019t\u2014if she\u2019s really gone\u2014 \u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat an honorable thing to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d Steve snarls, frustration seeping into his voice. \u201cShe was my anchor to this life, my guide through the labyrinth of moral ambiguity that is the present. I owe her this, at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man out of time,\u201d Red Skull says softly. \u201cYet somehow always cursed with too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>You</i>\u00a0did that,\u201d Steve spits, his nails digging deeper and deeper into his palm. \u201cI lost\u00a0<i>everything</i>\u00a0because of you. Everything. She showed me there was a purpose. That there\u2019s a reason to keep fighting. She gave me back my life. The least I can do is try and do the same for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is nothing you can do,\u201d Red Skull says simply, seemingly unaware of Steve\u2019s mounting anger. \u201cThe stone\u2014\u201d</p><p>Something snaps. \u201cI\u2014DON\u2019T\u2014CARE\u2014ABOUT\u2014THE\u2014STONE!\u201d he roars, slamming the case onto the ground. The latch breaks open, and the orange gleam of light that beams into the air sends another jolt of fury through Steve\u2019s body.</p><p>\u201cTake the stone,\u201d he snarls, both hands clenched tightly at his sides. \u201cTake it, and keep it for the next <i>sick</i> person who wants it for some\u00a0<i>revolting,\u00a0demented</i>\u00a0purpose\u2014I never want to see it again.\u201d</p><p>He stops, breathing heavily, and Red Skull holds his gaze steadily, a calm and indifferent look on his face.</p><p>Steve\u2019s voice is cold and eerily calm when he speaks again. \u201cI want her body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s down there. I can get it\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says softly, a strange glittering in his eyes. \u201cYou may talk to it, pay your respects. But you cannot take it. It must stay here, as a reminder of the sacrifice made for the stone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Steve growls, as another surge of anger washes over him. \u201cI\u2019m going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long way down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk.\u201d</p><p>The trek down the mountain is more painful, somehow, than the one up it. The cold silence, broken occasionally by a sharp gust of wind, becomes more unbearable with every step. He climbs downward, jaw clenched against the wind, and wonders briefly where the Skull lives when he isn\u2019t greeting people on the way to their deaths.</p><p>The trek down the mountain seems endless, but as Steve\u2019s feet hit solid ground and he sees the body crumpled at the foot of the cliff, it seems to come to an end much too quickly.</p><p>He approaches the body as if in slow motion, hardly daring to breathe, and as he catches a sight of achingly familiar red hair a sob starts to make its way out of his chest.</p><p>His knees buckle as he reaches her side and sees her face. Her eyes are closed\u2014he wonders if she\u2019d done that on purpose\u2014and her expression is so calm that if he didn\u2019t know better he\u2019d think she was simply pretending to sleep, ready to leap up and scare him at any moment.</p><p>Natasha, once so strong and full of life, is lying limp and broken in front of him, and despite himself he feels a wave of futile denial crash through his body.</p><p><i>See you in a minute,</i> she\u2019d said, her eyes dancing with excitement, so giddy that she\u2019d hardly been able to stand still in her suit.</p><p><i>See you in a minute</i>,\u00a0she\u2019d said, her face full of the first glimpse of genuine happiness he\u2019d seen from her in over five years. She\u2019d been so joyful, so relieved to have gotten her family back, so excited to be saving the world with them again.</p><p><i>See you in a minute</i>,\u00a0she\u2019d said, and then she\u2019d gone\u2014</p><p>He wonders what her last words were.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he murmurs, taking her cold, limp hand. Something hot starts to prickle behind his eyes. \u201cFor the record, when I told you to get a life, this was not what I meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just\u2014we just wanted to tell you: we did it. We won. Because of you.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t respond, and the silence gets more unbearable every second, so he starts talking. He tells her about the funeral, about the way Bruce threw a bench into the sky, and then he keeps going\u2014his voice breaks every few sentences, but he tells her about Bruce\u2019s snap, about the final, big, battle, about everyone coming back just in the nick of time, like they always do\u2014</p><p>He falters slightly when he gets to Tony.</p><p>\u201cI never\u2014I didn\u2019t realize until after\u2014I never really apologized to him. We just kind of moved on. I guess I thought, if we actually won, we\u2019d have the rest of our lives to fix things.\u201d</p><p>His eyes shut, ever so briefly.</p><p>\u201cI keep thinking about that, too. How I never say things until none of it means anything anymore. How little words mean when you\u2019re too late.\u201d</p><p>He sighs, trailing a finger along her cold, stiff palm. \u201cGrief and regret. They\u2019re like old enemies to me, now. I\u2019m no stranger to them. But it still hurts, every single time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose, objectively, that the cost we pay is nothing compared to what we get. But I look at the world we saved, the world we brought back, and I just\u2014I don\u2019t know if I have a place in it, anymore. It feels different without you.\u201d</p><p>Ice crystals are starting to form on her hair, and Steve runs a hand down a few strands, wiping them clean as much as he can.</p><p>\u201cFor you, it hasn\u2019t been that long since you\u2014since you fell. But for me, it\u2019s been days, and I really\u2014I just really, really miss you. You worked so hard to make me see that I belonged in that world, but\u2014I don\u2019t know, Nat, I think I always just belonged with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m gonna do. I wish you were here to tell me.\u201d</p><p>Her skin looks\u00a0so\u00a0pale in the shadow of the cliff.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, I know you can\u2019t hear me. And if you could, you\u2019d probably chew me out for walking a million miles in the snow just to talk to someone who can\u2019t respond. But I guess I just\u2014I didn\u2019t want you to be alone.\u201d</p><p>Her hand is freezing and unmoving in his, and his voice, hoarse and full of tears, fades away as his eyes rove over her pale, lifeless face. He lets the silence sit with them for what feels like hours, only moving when he feels his body start to go numb from the cold.</p><p>He buries her, there in the cold, his fingers scraping at the icy dirt in a sort of numb desperation. He finds a sharp rock to use as a spade and starts digging. The wind, unforgivingly harsh, bites at his skin as he works, but he hardly feels it at all\u2014he digs with a kind of cold fury, deeper and deeper into the cold, hard earth. He funnels his grief into work, just as he always has; he welcomes the sharp, physical pain of the cuts that form on his hands and lets it wash over the ache in his heart.</p><p>In that way, he thinks, they have always been similar.</p><p>In this world, time is of no consequence, and he is completely unaware of the amount of it that passes. He sinks deeper and deeper into the hole, fingers raw but always working, and when it finally seems deep enough he looks up to find that the sky looks exactly the same.</p><p>He lifts his companion, his guiding light, as gently as possible and lowers her into the grave, arranging her limbs so that she appears to be sleeping. As he straightens up, he remembers Tony\u2019s funeral\u2014the beauty of the lake and the sky, and the rows and rows of people, of families, all there to pay their respects.</p><p>And here she lies, in a rough, hand-dug hole in the ground on a completely foreign planet.</p><p>He covers her in the earth, eyes never leaving her body, and after she is completely obscured from view he reaches into his pocket.</p><p>The makeshift gravestone expands in his hand, whirring softly, and he leans over to tuck it into the earth near her head. He doesn\u2019t understand the technology, but Bruce had said that it would find roots in the ground, that it would work its way into the planet and stay there. A semblance of permanence, an eternal monument for the one who had given everything for the\u00a0chance\u00a0to make the world right again.</p><p>He glances at the stone, which is still buzzing steadily, and runs a final hand along the dirt beside it.</p><p>\u201cBye, Nat,\u201d he murmurs softly as he gets to his feet. \u201cWe miss you, and we\u2014I\u2014love you.\u201d</p><p>Long after Steve has disappeared back into the night, the humming stops. A completed marker stands, small but erect, at the head of a makeshift grave at the bottom of the cliff. It will stand there for the rest of eternity, for nobody and for everybody. On the surface of the stone, a hand-written conscription has taken form, carved painstakingly by a multitude of different hands. \u00a0</p><p><i>Here lies Natasha Romanoff,</i></p><p><i>One who would give everything and ask for nothing in return.</i></p><p><i>May the world remember her for who she was:</i></p><p><i>A spy, a hero, a friend.</i></p><p><i>A loved one.</i></p>",

Everyone starts, stumbling through a few choked-up words, then fades into a despairing silence with a shake of their heads.</p><p>Steve thinks, somehow, that this is more fitting anyway. She\u2019d always been content to let silence do the talking\u2014she might\u2019ve liked that their love and pain hung in the air around them, unburdened by clumsy turns of phrase and awkward word choices that could never quite capture what a person could feel.</p><p>The real emotional eruption comes after, when the silent tears are interrupted by Tony\u2019s quiet question.</p><p>\u201cDo we know if she had family?\u201d</p><p><i>Two little gravestones by a chain-linked fence.</i></p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Steve answers, his voice low. \u201cUs.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>Thor grunts, and Steve knows exactly what is coming before it does\u2014he has experienced the all-too-familiar spiral of denial Thor is about to embark on too many times.

He doesn\u2019t flinch as Clint starts yelling about floating red things, and as his voice gets louder and angrier the pit inside of him seems to eat away at more and more of his chest.</p><p><i>If it was the other way around, and it was down to me to save your life\u2014would you trust me to do it?</i></p><p>\u201cIt was supposed to be me,\u201d Clint says, his voice suddenly much smaller. \u201cShe sacrificed her life for that goddamn stone. She bid her life on it.\u201d</p><p>Steve lowers his head, eyes closed in an effort to stem the tears streaming down his face. Bruce gives a terrible, heartbreaking roar, and as Steve looks up to watch the bench go flying over the lake he feels a flare of white-hot anger at the sight of the sheer stillness of the water.</p><p>How\u00a0<i>dare</i>\u00a0the earth look this good when she is not here to see it? How\u00a0<i>dare</i>\u2014</p><p>\u201cWe have to make it worth it,\u201d Bruce says, and as Steve stands to meet his eyes he feels an aching determination start to form in his stomach.</p><p><i>Where else am I gonna get a view like this?</i></p><p>\u201cWe will.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>Clint finds him after they\u2019ve all shuffled inside, a slightly sheepish look on his face.</p><p>\u201cWhen we\u2014when this is all over, and we put the stones back,\u201d he mumbles, fingers jammed inside his pockets, \u201cI\u2014um, I don\u2019t think I can\u2014I just can\u2019t go back there\u2014\"</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Steve says softly, a sense of resolve settling in his gut. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.

Ice and snow coat every inch of the ground, and the temperature seems to drop with every step he takes.</p><p>The suitcase in his hand seems to grow heavier as he approaches the top, and his grief is briefly replaced by unease as a black, shadowy figure begins to form in front of him. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cSteven Rogers\u201d, the figure says, his voice sending a burst of adrenaline through Steve\u2019s veins, \u201cSon of\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d Steve snarls, fingers curling into a fist.</p><p>\u201cMe,\u201d Red Skull says calmly, floating forward so that his face, as grotesque as ever, is brought into the dim light of the sky. \u00a0\u201cWelcome\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI killed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u00a0<i>thought</i>\u00a0you killed me, just as you\u00a0thought\u00a0you killed HYDRA. But I am not dead; instead, I have been assigned to a fate far less desirable\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave it,\u201d Steve says roughly, ignoring the pounding in his chest. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid you are too late,\u201d the Skull says softly. \u201cYour friends have already gone.\u201d</p><p>The double meaning of the word is not lost on him.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he says, trying to ignore the fresh grief that has just jolted through his body. \u201cI\u2019m from the future. I\u2019m here to return the stone. And to take her back. A soul for a soul, right? That was the deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is nothing that can be done. Surely Barton told you? It is irreversible.\u201d</p><p>And he knows, he\u00a0<i>knows</i>, he has known since Clint\u2019s knees buckled in front of his eyes, but there is something in him that keeps him fighting even though he knows it is futile.</p><p>\u201cThen take me. Take me instead\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will not. What\u2019s done is done. You may keep the stone\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u00a0<i>want</i>\u00a0the stone, I want<i>\u00a0her</i>.\u201c</p><p>The man that was once Johann Schmidt merely looks at him, an almost detached look on his face. \u201cIs this love, Captain Rogers?\u201d</p><p>Steve laughs, a bitter, hollow sound that rings through the nothingness around them. \u201c<i>Love</i>.\u00a0Nothing more than an empty, meaningless word when you\u2019re too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you knew you were going to be too late,\u201d Red Skull says quietly. \u201cAnd you came anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Steve says, voice cracking slightly. \u201cI wanted to make things right, as much as I can. She spent her whole life thinking she was alone. I\u2019m not gonna let her die that way, too.\u201d</p><p>There is a moment of silence before Red Skull speaks. \u201cFor what it\u2019s worth,\u201d he almost murmurs, \u201cShe did not die alone. Her friend\u2014Barton\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Steve mutters, ignoring the pang in his heart as Clint\u2019s grief-stricken face swims into his mind. \u201cBut I wanted to be here too. I couldn\u2019t\u2014if she\u2019s really gone\u2014 \u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat an honorable thing to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d Steve snarls, frustration seeping into his voice. \u201cShe was my anchor to this life, my guide through the labyrinth of moral ambiguity that is the present. I owe her this, at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man out of time,\u201d Red Skull says softly. \u201cYet somehow always cursed with too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>You</i>\u00a0did that,\u201d Steve spits, his nails digging deeper and deeper into his palm. \u201cI lost\u00a0<i>everything</i>\u00a0because of you. Everything. She showed me there was a purpose. That there\u2019s a reason to keep fighting. She gave me back my life. The least I can do is try and do the same for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is nothing you can do,\u201d Red Skull says simply, seemingly unaware of Steve\u2019s mounting anger. \u201cThe stone\u2014\u201d</p><p>Something snaps. \u201cI\u2014DON\u2019T\u2014CARE\u2014ABOUT\u2014THE\u2014STONE!\u201d he roars, slamming the case onto the ground. The latch breaks open, and the orange gleam of light that beams into the air sends another jolt of fury through Steve\u2019s body.</p><p>\u201cTake the stone,\u201d he snarls, both hands clenched tightly at his sides. \u201cTake it, and keep it for the next <i>sick</i> person who wants it for some\u00a0<i>revolting,\u00a0demented</i>\u00a0purpose\u2014I never want to see it again.\u201d</p><p>He stops, breathing heavily, and Red Skull holds his gaze steadily, a calm and indifferent look on his face.</p><p>Steve\u2019s voice is cold and eerily calm when he speaks again. \u201cI want her body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s down there. I can get it\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says softly, a strange glittering in his eyes. \u201cYou may talk to it, pay your respects. But you cannot take it. It must stay here, as a reminder of the sacrifice made for the stone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Steve growls, as another surge of anger washes over him. \u201cI\u2019m going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long way down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk.\u201d</p><p>The trek down the mountain is more painful, somehow, than the one up it. The cold silence, broken occasionally by a sharp gust of wind, becomes more unbearable with every step. He climbs downward, jaw clenched against the wind, and wonders briefly where the Skull lives when he isn\u2019t greeting people on the way to their deaths.</p><p>The trek down the mountain seems endless, but as Steve\u2019s feet hit solid ground and he sees the body crumpled at the foot of the cliff, it seems to come to an end much too quickly.</p><p>He approaches the body as if in slow motion, hardly daring to breathe, and as he catches a sight of achingly familiar red hair a sob starts to make its way out of his chest.</p><p>His knees buckle as he reaches her side and sees her face. Her eyes are closed\u2014he wonders if she\u2019d done that on purpose\u2014and her expression is so calm that if he didn\u2019t know better he\u2019d think she was simply pretending to sleep, ready to leap up and scare him at any moment.</p><p>Natasha, once so strong and full of life, is lying limp and broken in front of him, and despite himself he feels a wave of futile denial crash through his body.</p><p><i>See you in a minute,</i> she\u2019d said, her eyes dancing with excitement, so giddy that she\u2019d hardly been able to stand still in her suit.</p><p><i>See you in a minute</i>,\u00a0she\u2019d said, her face full of the first glimpse of genuine happiness he\u2019d seen from her in over five years. She\u2019d been so joyful, so relieved to have gotten her family back, so excited to be saving the world with them again.</p><p><i>See you in a minute</i>,\u00a0she\u2019d said, and then she\u2019d gone\u2014</p><p>He wonders what her last words were.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he murmurs, taking her cold, limp hand. Something hot starts to prickle behind his eyes. \u201cFor the record, when I told you to get a life, this was not what I meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just\u2014we just wanted to tell you: we did it. We won. Because of you.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t respond, and the silence gets more unbearable every second, so he starts talking. He tells her about the funeral, about the way Bruce threw a bench into the sky, and then he keeps going\u2014his voice breaks every few sentences, but he tells her about Bruce\u2019s snap, about the final, big, battle, about everyone coming back just in the nick of time, like they always do\u2014</p><p>He falters slightly when he gets to Tony.</p><p>\u201cI never\u2014I didn\u2019t realize until after\u2014I never really apologized to him. We just kind of moved on. I guess I thought, if we actually won, we\u2019d have the rest of our lives to fix things.\u201d</p><p>His eyes shut, ever so briefly.</p><p>\u201cI keep thinking about that, too. How I never say things until none of it means anything anymore. How little words mean when you\u2019re too late.\u201d</p><p>He sighs, trailing a finger along her cold, stiff palm. \u201cGrief and regret. They\u2019re like old enemies to me, now. I\u2019m no stranger to them. But it still hurts, every single time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose, objectively, that the cost we pay is nothing compared to what we get. But I look at the world we saved, the world we brought back, and I just\u2014I don\u2019t know if I have a place in it, anymore. It feels different without you.\u201d</p><p>Ice crystals are starting to form on her hair, and Steve runs a hand down a few strands, wiping them clean as much as he can.</p><p>\u201cFor you, it hasn\u2019t been that long since you\u2014since you fell. But for me, it\u2019s been days, and I really\u2014I just really, really miss you. You worked so hard to make me see that I belonged in that world, but\u2014I don\u2019t know, Nat, I think I always just belonged with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m gonna do. I wish you were here to tell me.\u201d</p><p>Her skin looks\u00a0so\u00a0pale in the shadow of the cliff.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, I know you can\u2019t hear me. And if you could, you\u2019d probably chew me out for walking a million miles in the snow just to talk to someone who can\u2019t respond. But I guess I just\u2014I didn\u2019t want you to be alone.\u201d</p><p>Her hand is freezing and unmoving in his, and his voice, hoarse and full of tears, fades away as his eyes rove over her pale, lifeless face. He lets the silence sit with them for what feels like hours, only moving when he feels his body start to go numb from the cold.</p><p>He buries her, there in the cold, his fingers scraping at the icy dirt in a sort of numb desperation. He finds a sharp rock to use as a spade and starts digging. The wind, unforgivingly harsh, bites at his skin as he works, but he hardly feels it at all\u2014he digs with a kind of cold fury, deeper and deeper into the cold, hard earth. He funnels his grief into work, just as he always has; he welcomes the sharp, physical pain of the cuts that form on his hands and lets it wash over the ache in his heart.</p><p>In that way, he thinks, they have always been similar.</p><p>In this world, time is of no consequence, and he is completely unaware of the amount of it that passes. He sinks deeper and deeper into the hole, fingers raw but always working, and when it finally seems deep enough he looks up to find that the sky looks exactly the same.</p><p>He lifts his companion, his guiding light, as gently as possible and lowers her into the grave, arranging her limbs so that she appears to be sleeping. As he straightens up, he remembers Tony\u2019s funeral\u2014the beauty of the lake and the sky, and the rows and rows of people, of families, all there to pay their respects.</p><p>And here she lies, in a rough, hand-dug hole in the ground on a completely foreign planet.</p><p>He covers her in the earth, eyes never leaving her body, and after she is completely obscured from view he reaches into his pocket.</p><p>The makeshift gravestone expands in his hand, whirring softly, and he leans over to tuck it into the earth near her head. He doesn\u2019t understand the technology, but Bruce had said that it would find roots in the ground, that it would work its way into the planet and stay there. A semblance of permanence, an eternal monument for the one who had given everything for the\u00a0chance\u00a0to make the world right again.</p><p>He glances at the stone, which is still buzzing steadily, and runs a final hand along the dirt beside it.</p><p>\u201cBye, Nat,\u201d he murmurs softly as he gets to his feet. \u201cWe miss you, and we\u2014I\u2014love you.\u201d</p><p>Long after Steve has disappeared back into the night, the humming stops. A completed marker stands, small but erect, at the head of a makeshift grave at the bottom of the cliff. It will stand there for the rest of eternity, for nobody and for everybody. On the surface of the stone, a hand-written conscription has taken form, carved painstakingly by a multitude of different hands. \u00a0</p><p><i>Here lies Natasha Romanoff,</i></p><p><i>One who would give everything and ask for nothing in return.</i></p><p><i>May the world remember her for who she was:</i></p><p><i>A spy, a hero, a friend.</i></p><p><i>A loved one.</i></p>",

Everyone starts, stumbling through a few choked-up words, then fades into a despairing silence with a shake of their heads.</p><p>Steve thinks, somehow, that this is more fitting anyway. She&rsquo;d always been content to let silence do the talking&mdash;she might&rsquo;ve liked that their love and pain hung in the air around them, unburdened by clumsy turns of phrase and awkward word choices that could never quite capture what a person could feel.</p><p>The real emotional eruption comes after, when the silent tears are interrupted by Tony&rsquo;s quiet question.</p><p>&ldquo;Do we know if she had family?&rdquo;</p><p><i>Two little gravestones by a chain-linked fence.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Steve answers, his voice low. &ldquo;Us.&rdquo;</p><p>Thor grunts, and Steve knows exactly what is coming before it does&mdash;he has experienced the all-too-familiar spiral of denial Thor is about to embark on too many times. He doesn&rsquo;t move as the god in front of him spouts theories he knows are impossible, making plans Steve knows will never work. He doesn&rsquo;t flinch as Clint starts yelling about floating red things, and as his voice gets louder and angrier the pit inside of him seems to eat away at more and more of his chest.</p><p><i>If it was the other way around, and it was down to me to save your life&mdash;would you trust me to do it?</i></p><p>&ldquo;It was supposed to be me,&rdquo; Clint says, his voice suddenly much smaller. &ldquo;She sacrificed her life for that goddamn stone. She bid her life on it.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve lowers his head, eyes closed in an effort to stem the tears streaming down his face. Bruce gives a terrible, heartbreaking roar, and as Steve looks up to watch the bench go flying over the lake he feels a flare of white-hot anger at the sight of the sheer stillness of the water.</p><p>How&nbsp;<i>dare</i>&nbsp;the earth look this good when she is not here to see it? How&nbsp;<i>dare</i>&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;We have to make it worth it,&rdquo; Bruce says, and as Steve stands to meet his eyes he feels an aching determination start to form in his stomach.</p><p><i>Where else am I gonna get a view like this?</i></p><p>&ldquo;We will.&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>Clint finds him after they&rsquo;ve all shuffled inside, a slightly sheepish look on his face.</p><p>&ldquo;When we&mdash;when this is all over, and we put the stones back,&rdquo; he mumbles, fingers jammed inside his pockets, &ldquo;I&mdash;um, I don&rsquo;t think I can&mdash;I just can&rsquo;t go back there&mdash;\"</p><p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; Steve says softly, a sense of resolve settling in his gut. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it. I want to&mdash;I want to talk to her, say a real goodbye.&rdquo;</p><p>Clint looks up, the pain in his face a direct replica of the one currently tearing its way through Steve&rsquo;s heart. &ldquo;She loved you, you know.&rdquo;</p><p>The grief writhing in Steve&rsquo;s stomach like a monstrous parasite starts thrashing even harder, and even though Clint&rsquo;s eyes are kind Steve finds it inordinately difficult to meet them. &ldquo;She loved all of us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, but you, especially&mdash;you helped her, a lot. She told me what she told you, what you did for her. You were there for her, all those years, when I&mdash;when I wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve gives him a sad, knowing smile and shakes his head. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t beat yourself up for that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If I had just&mdash;we could&rsquo;ve had more time&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Steve says resolutely. &ldquo;None of us did. Trust me, if I had, things would be different right now.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&mdash;</p><p>Vormir is&nbsp;<i>freezing</i>.</p><p>It&rsquo;s the first time he has been truly alone since the Quantum realm, and as he climbs, the icy ground crunching beneath his boots, Steve feels a dull hollow start to expand inside of him.

She&rsquo;d been so joyful, so relieved to have gotten her family back, so excited to be saving the world with them again.</p><p><i>See you in a minute</i>,&nbsp;she&rsquo;d said, and then she&rsquo;d gone&mdash;</p><p>He wonders what her last words were.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; he murmurs, taking her cold, limp hand. Something hot starts to prickle behind his eyes. &ldquo;For the record, when I told you to get a life, this was not what I meant.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I just&mdash;we just wanted to tell you: we did it. We won. Because of you.&rdquo;</p><p>She doesn&rsquo;t respond, and the silence gets more unbearable every second, so he starts talking. He tells her about the funeral, about the way Bruce threw a bench into the sky, and then he keeps going&mdash;his voice breaks every few sentences, but he tells her about Bruce&rsquo;s snap, about the final, big, battle, about everyone coming back just in the nick of time, like they always do&mdash;</p><p>He falters slightly when he gets to Tony.</p><p>&ldquo;I never&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t realize until after&mdash;I never really apologized to him. We just kind of moved on. I guess I thought, if we actually won, we&rsquo;d have the rest of our lives to fix things.&rdquo;</p><p>His eyes shut, ever so briefly.</p><p>&ldquo;I keep thinking about that, too. How I never say things until none of it means anything anymore. How little words mean when you&rsquo;re too late.&rdquo;</p><p>He sighs, trailing a finger along her cold, stiff palm. &ldquo;Grief and regret. They&rsquo;re like old enemies to me, now. I&rsquo;m no stranger to them. But it still hurts, every single time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I suppose, objectively, that the cost we pay is nothing compared to what we get. But I look at the world we saved, the world we brought back, and I just&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know if I have a place in it, anymore. It feels different without you.&rdquo;</p><p>Ice crystals are starting to form on her hair, and Steve runs a hand down a few strands, wiping them clean as much as he can.</p><p>&ldquo;For you, it hasn&rsquo;t been that long since you&mdash;since you fell. But for me, it&rsquo;s been days, and I really&mdash;I just really, really miss you. You worked so hard to make me see that I belonged in that world, but&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know, Nat, I think I always just belonged with you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So I don&rsquo;t know what to do anymore. I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m gonna do. I wish you were here to tell me.&rdquo;</p><p>Her skin looks&nbsp;so&nbsp;pale in the shadow of the cliff.</p><p>&ldquo;Anyway, I know you can&rsquo;t hear me. And if you could, you&rsquo;d probably chew me out for walking a million miles in the snow just to talk to someone who can&rsquo;t respond. But I guess I just&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t want you to be alone.&rdquo;</p><p>Her hand is freezing and unmoving in his, and his voice, hoarse and full of tears, fades away as his eyes rove over her pale, lifeless face. He lets the silence sit with them for what feels like hours, only moving when he feels his body start to go numb from the cold.</p><p>He buries her, there in the cold, his fingers scraping at the icy dirt in a sort of numb desperation. He finds a sharp rock to use as a spade and starts digging. The wind, unforgivingly harsh, bites at his skin as he works, but he hardly feels it at all&mdash;he digs with a kind of cold fury, deeper and deeper into the cold, hard earth. He funnels his grief into work, just as he always has; he welcomes the sharp, physical pain of the cuts that form on his hands and lets it wash over the ache in his heart.</p><p>In that way, he thinks, they have always been similar.</p><p>In this world, time is of no consequence, and he is completely unaware of the amount of it that passes. He sinks deeper and deeper into the hole, fingers raw but always working, and when it finally seems deep enough he looks up to find that the sky looks exactly the same.</p><p>He lifts his companion, his guiding light, as gently as possible and lowers her into the grave, arranging her limbs so that she appears to be sleeping. As he straightens up, he remembers Tony&rsquo;s funeral&mdash;the beauty of the lake and the sky, and the rows and rows of people, of families, all there to pay their respects.</p><p>And here she lies, in a rough, hand-dug hole in the ground on a completely foreign planet.</p><p>He covers her in the earth, eyes never leaving her body, and after she is completely obscured from view he reaches into his pocket.</p><p>The makeshift gravestone expands in his hand, whirring softly, and he leans over to tuck it into the earth near her head. He doesn&rsquo;t understand the technology, but Bruce had said that it would find roots in the ground, that it would work its way into the planet and stay there. A semblance of permanence, an eternal monument for the one who had given everything for the&nbsp;chance&nbsp;to make the world right again.</p><p>He glances at the stone, which is still buzzing steadily, and runs a final hand along the dirt beside it.</p><p>&ldquo;Bye, Nat,&rdquo; he murmurs softly as he gets to his feet. &ldquo;We miss you, and we&mdash;I&mdash;love you.&rdquo;</p><p>Long after Steve has disappeared back into the night, the humming stops. A completed marker stands, small but erect, at the head of a makeshift grave at the bottom of the cliff. It will stand there for the rest of eternity, for nobody and for everybody. On the surface of the stone, a hand-written conscription has taken form, carved painstakingly by a multitude of different hands. &nbsp;</p><p><i>Here lies Natasha Romanoff,</i></p><p><i>One who would give everything and ask for nothing in return.</i></p><p><i>May the world remember her for who she was:</i></p><p><i>A spy, a hero, a friend.</i></p><p><i>A loved one.</i></p>",
