How could I even forget? Every weekend that was your addiction!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Do you remember aunt how y/n/n snapped when that weekend your new employee tried to suggest her some new dishes?&rdquo; Tae said laughing. </p><p>&ldquo;How can I even forget? And also that time when she punched that guy who got drunk and behaved badly with me! Oh my! How much all of you have grown up!&rdquo; Aunt exclaimed sighing.\u00a0</p><!-- more --><p>&ldquo;The habit of feeling sleepy after heavy eating is never going to leave me.&rdquo; I thought as I was drowsing off in the back seat while Tae was chatting relentlessly in the front seat beside Yoongs while returning. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 After a few moments I was suddenly wide awake and Yoongs coughed signalling Tae to something. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 &ldquo;Tae weren&rsquo;t you trying to tell me something at the club?&rdquo; I said while sitting upright. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 &ldquo; Yes y/n/n, there&rsquo;s something you should know.&rdquo; Tae looked at Yoongs and continued, &ldquo;The castle has been taken over.&rdquo; </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 I sprang from my seat, &ldquo;Tell me you are joking!&rdquo; </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Tae scratched the back of his head, &ldquo;I am not joking.

Great!&rdquo; I scoffed. I didn&rsquo;t expect this. &ldquo;I was supposed to be the queen.&rdquo; I whined and pouted. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 As I calmed down and sat quietly, a frown permanent on my face, the street lights, the sound of the busy road slowly faded away&hellip;</p><p><i>&ldquo;One day I&rsquo;ll be the queen of this castle!&rdquo; exclaimed a dreamy eyed eleven years old Y/n. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;And I will be the king!&rdquo; exclaimed a giggly faced Y/n&rsquo;s best friend. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;But then we have to marry each other.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Friends can marry each other I think. &lsquo;I do&rsquo; this is what you have to say to get married.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;And kiss too.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Ew I won&rsquo;t kiss you.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;But if you become king then we get to stay together forever!&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What about Yoongi hyung?&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll marry both of you, you two can be kings and I&rsquo;ll be your queen and we&rsquo;ll be able to stay together!&rdquo; with a content and proud expression Y/n nodded, &ldquo;Yes! A perfect plan!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 All these conversations were taking place in the local park facing the famous castle in the neighborhood. After turning right at the end of the road where Y/n and Tae lives, the road continues for about five minutes if you walk and then it takes a left turn and there is the park at the left side where all the kids of the neighborhood go in the afternoons and evenings. And the castle was just on the opposite side. </i></p><p><i>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The castle was surrounded by a big boundary and the area was covered in different types of plants and trees. But one can see the yellow coloured castle through the huge gate. </i></p><p><i>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 &ldquo;I had a dream yesterday and it was so real!&rdquo; Y/n exclaimed when she arrived at the park with Tae. Yoongi was already there waiting for them. </i></p><p><i>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 </i></p><p><i>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 </i>The sudden jerk pulled me out of my reverie. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey y/n/n, we are at your house. It&rsquo;s so late already. Go!&rdquo; Tae said while he held the gate open for me. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh! Yeah, yeah. Bye Tae. Bye Yoongs.&rdquo; said a still absentminded me. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey y/n/n, let&rsquo;s meet up tomorrow morning 10 o&rsquo; clock at the park. Ok?&rdquo; Yoongi said peeking through the car&rsquo;s window, smiling. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 I gave him a small smile and waved goodbye. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 My alarm had never been my friend but today I thought it was. Because it saved my sleepy late ass by singing relentlessly since 8 am. When I finally gave in it was already 9am and Yoongs never liked waiting. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 I finished my morning routine, got ready and called Tae. I heard him shout from under my window, &ldquo;Come out you bum! It&rsquo;s already 9:45!&rdquo; </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 I fell asleep pretty late last night thinking about the castle. I don&rsquo;t know why but the castle had always attracted me. It&rsquo;s owners lived abroad and never visited. There were servants employed to maintain it. I had a plan ready that in the future I&rsquo;ll earn enough money to buy the castle. But I think that either the owners are back or someone became rich earlier than me. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 I quickly came out with my bicycle and we rode together towards the park. </p><p>.</p><p>. </p><p>Can you tell me the exact feeling when you feel the warmth of the sun on your skin in a chilly winter morning? Or the feeling when you see an oasis after being lost in a desert? That&rsquo;s what I felt like when I first saw him. He was collecting letters from the mailbox of the castle. That glowing skin, that flawless smile when few children passed by him made him look like he was the happiest child, that eye smile, that blonde hair, plush lips made me stop on my way. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 When we reached the park he had already gone inside. </p><p>&ldquo;Yah! Don&rsquo;t step on my precious foot, you brat!&rdquo; Yoongs exclaimed &ldquo;Where are your eyes?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Is it love at first sight?&rdquo; Tae&rsquo;s expression was thoughtful,&ldquo; How can you skip more than one heart beat? Are you even alive?&rdquo; </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Shocked, I looked at Tae and realised the emotion that I was feeling. &ldquo;Is it really that?&rdquo; I was confused. I looked over at the castle and wondered was that dream all those years ago about this?</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Tae clapped to draw our attention and said,&ldquo;I think we should head home for now. Y/n/n needs to clear her head!&rdquo; Tae was right and I was thankful. </p><p>&ldquo;Tae, is this really love?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;y/n/n, it&rsquo;s 2 am! If it isn&rsquo;t love then why did you call me instead of sleeping that you love to do so much? And if the feelings aren&rsquo;t that strong then why am I feeling them too? Why did your breath hitched the moment you saw him?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;But what should I do now?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s play overwatch! Ok? You can&rsquo;t sleep anyways! And that won&rsquo;t let me sleep. So, by this we can kill the night. Now keep the phone down and login. I&rsquo;m waiting!&rdquo; </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Despite of being soulmates there are some areas where we just don&rsquo;t want to reside. One of them is playing overwatch. I can&rsquo;t play violent games or shooting games. Those are just too stimulating for me. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 This overwatch account though was made last year as a result of Tae&rsquo;s endless whining because he missed me and wanted to talk to me. At the same time he couldn&rsquo;t miss overwatch. So this was the solution that he came up with. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 The night ended quickly by hearing Tae&rsquo;s loud cheers and me being absent minded most of the time. But Tae didn&rsquo;t give up, he never does. He kept on making jokes to lighten the atmosphere and at some point I did forget about the day&rsquo;s uneasiness and cracked jokes with Tae. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Well, apparently it seemed that staying up the night was a really bad idea and that became a regret when I started to doze off in the very first lecture at the university. &ldquo;Great! First day at uni and I am already going to get a sleepy nickname.&rdquo; That was all I could think about at that time. These moments of thoughtless thoughtfulness were always peaceful. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 I tried to stay awake as much as I could. The teacher suddenly asked me,&ldquo;Ms. Y/l/n are you having difficulty in understanding any of these? Your eyes have become big like Donuts!&rdquo; Everyone started laughing at this. </p><p>&ldquo;No sir I don&rsquo;t have any problems.&rdquo; This was so embarrassing. I promised to myself to never ever stay awake at night.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 The first lecture ended quickly after that, much to my convenience. The next one was about an hour later. I took out my phone to text Tae to meet me at the cafeteria. And at that moment I received a text from him.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"715\" data-orig-height=\"1246\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d091f584df520f0cfec00dc8c6399577/tumblr_picniiND1E1umxiba_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"715\" data-orig-height=\"1246\"/></figure><p>I smiled at my phone screen and increased my pace towards the cafeteria. I was hungry too. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 When I arrived at the cafeteria I saw Tae was sitting at the far corner table by the window. He had already ordered burger and Coke, our favourites. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 While walking over to Tae I heard some of the girls talking at another table. </p><p>&ldquo;OMG! Taehyung is looking so hot just as usual! I just wish he would accept my proposal some day.&rdquo; said a really sweet voiced girl. </p><p>I slowed down my pace intentionally. </p><p>&ldquo; Oh, don&rsquo;t keep your hopes up Lilith. Almost all the girls here are dreaming about that!&rdquo; scoffed a deep voiced girl. </p><p>&ldquo;But why is that newly transferred girl from my literature lecture walking over to him?&rdquo; this was said by another girl with a ringing voice. I couldn&rsquo;t believe it. Was I in a k-drama? I laughed mentally thinking what would they do once they know who I am? </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Tae was looking out the window deeply thinking something so he didn&rsquo;t notice me. What was he so absentminded for? </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 &ldquo;Guess you are really popular here, huh!&rdquo; My comment pulled Tae out from his deep thoughts. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Sometimes I really hate this setting of being soulmates. If you want you can block feelings from reaching your soulmate to a certain extent or completely. Tae did this a few times before. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <i>The most memorable incident was when in high school I started going out with my then crush. I didn&rsquo;t know at that time why Tae blocked his feelings. He started to disappear at different times along with Yoongs. I didn&rsquo;t push him much to tell me because I knew that he will tell me everything at the right time. And after a few days Tae invited himself and Yoongs over to one of our dinner dates. Until we finished eating they both were quite calm and chatted friendly with c/n.</i></p><p><i>After ordering dessert Yoongs asked c/n,&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know c/n that you are so talented!&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>C/n chuckled,&ldquo;well I guess I am quite talented. May be that&rsquo;s why y/n likes me,&rdquo; I blushed and looked down. Tae looked at me and then at c/n with an unreadable expression. </i></p><p><i>Yoongs smirked,&ldquo;You must be pretty talented, making so many girls fall for you! And you must have a pretty big heart too.. liking back all those girls! Isn&rsquo;t it difficult?&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>Tae kept his chin on his hands and smiled at c/n. Confused, I looked at Tae and then at c/n. I exclaimed,&ldquo;Tae give me your phone!&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Gladly&rdquo; he fished out his phone and gave it to me. I instantly opened his phone&rsquo;s gallery&rsquo;s camera section and saw the pictures. There were photos of c/n with other girls and anyone could tell that they were couples. I looked at c/n who was stuttering and trying to mutter something. </i></p><p><i>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 I said curtly,&ldquo;You are going to pay for all of the things you have done.&rdquo; Saying this I stood up. Tae and Yoongs stood up too to leave with me. </i></p><p><i>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 On our way out Tae walked over to the waitress and said,&ldquo; Ma'am, our friend sitting over there at the table will pay the bill. Thank you and have a great evening.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I didn&rsquo;t realise that I was walking so fast that Tae and Yoongs had to literally run to catch up to me. When we got far enough I stopped on my tracks. Yoongs huffed after reaching me,&ldquo; I didn&rsquo;t know you could walk so fast! Who is Usain Bolt? I only know y/n y/l/n.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 I couldn&rsquo;t walk anymore. I collapsed in Yoongs&rsquo; arms and started sobbing violently. I didn&rsquo;t want Tae to feel the pain that I was feeling in my heart. That day I learnt how to stop my feelings from reaching Tae. </i></p><p><i>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 He took me in his arms and walked a little distance. I didn&rsquo;t know that we were so close to the park. He made me sit on a swing and looked at my face for sometime as if he was trying to find something there. </i></p><p><i>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 &ldquo;You are so ugly! I wonder why he dated you!&rdquo; he blurted out suddenly. &ldquo;He surely has a bad taste but the other girls were beautiful.&rdquo; he put his right hand under his chin and pretended to think hard. </i></p><p><i>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 I looked at him and kicked his legs,&ldquo;Yah! You jerk!&rdquo; I turned my face away from him. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to hide the smile.&rdquo; he hummed and I couldn&rsquo;t control my smile. </i></p><p><i>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 As I was brushing off my tears Yoongs knelt in front of me and held both of my hands,&ldquo; Look in front of you. What do you see?&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>I lifted my face up and said,&ldquo;The castle!&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 &ldquo;Yeah right! The same castle that you dream to be queen of. Don&rsquo;t you think that you are worth more? You ARE a queen. So don&rsquo;t waste your tears on someone who doesn&rsquo;t even know how to treasure something so precious. I know there&rsquo;ll be someone who will come with a heart big enough to treasure and protect all the love that you&rsquo;ll offer and will give you a lot more back!&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>Yoongs smiled at me and I don&rsquo;t know why but those words made me happy and determined to move on. </i></p><p><i>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get going then and get some ice cream. Shall we?&rdquo; Yoongs flashed his gummy smile and lead us. </i></p><p><i>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 That was the day when Tae&rsquo;s admiration for Yoongs turned into love. </i></p><h2><a href=\"https://apotatomashedbybts.tumblr.com/post/183268583966/ill-be-your-knight-masterlist\">Other chapters</a></h2><p><b>A/n:</b> thank you for reading.

I don\u2019t know why but the castle had always attracted me. It\u2019s owners lived abroad and never visited. There were servants employed to maintain it. I had a plan ready that in the future I\u2019ll earn enough money to buy the castle. But I think that either the owners are back or someone became rich earlier than me. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 I quickly came out with my bicycle and we rode together towards the park. </p><p>.</p><p>. </p><p>Can you tell me the exact feeling when you feel the warmth of the sun on your skin in a chilly winter morning? Or the feeling when you see an oasis after being lost in a desert? That\u2019s what I felt like when I first saw him. He was collecting letters from the mailbox of the castle. That glowing skin, that flawless smile when few children passed by him made him look like he was the happiest child, that eye smile, that blonde hair, plush lips made me stop on my way. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 When we reached the park he had already gone inside. </p><p>\u201cYah! Don\u2019t step on my precious foot, you brat!\u201d Yoongs exclaimed \u201cWhere are your eyes?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIs it love at first sight?\u201d Tae\u2019s expression was thoughtful,\u201c How can you skip more than one heart beat? Are you even alive?\u201d </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Shocked, I looked at Tae and realised the emotion that I was feeling. \u201cIs it really that?\u201d I was confused. I looked over at the castle and wondered was that dream all those years ago about this?</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Tae clapped to draw our attention and said,\u201cI think we should head home for now. Y/n/n needs to clear her head!\u201d Tae was right and I was thankful. </p><p>\u201cTae, is this really love?\u201d </p><p>\u201cy/n/n, it\u2019s 2 am! If it isn\u2019t love then why did you call me instead of sleeping that you love to do so much? And if the feelings aren\u2019t that strong then why am I feeling them too? Why did your breath hitched the moment you saw him?\u201d </p><p>\u201cBut what should I do now?\u201d </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s play overwatch! Ok? You can\u2019t sleep anyways! And that won\u2019t let me sleep. So, by this we can kill the night. Now keep the phone down and login. I\u2019m waiting!\u201d </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Despite of being soulmates there are some areas where we just don\u2019t want to reside. One of them is playing overwatch. I can\u2019t play violent games or shooting games. Those are just too stimulating for me. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 This overwatch account though was made last year as a result of Tae\u2019s endless whining because he missed me and wanted to talk to me. At the same time he couldn\u2019t miss overwatch. So this was the solution that he came up with. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 The night ended quickly by hearing Tae\u2019s loud cheers and me being absent minded most of the time. But Tae didn\u2019t give up, he never does. He kept on making jokes to lighten the atmosphere and at some point I did forget about the day\u2019s uneasiness and cracked jokes with Tae. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Well, apparently it seemed that staying up the night was a really bad idea and that became a regret when I started to doze off in the very first lecture at the university. \u201cGreat! First day at uni and I am already going to get a sleepy nickname.\u201d That was all I could think about at that time. These moments of thoughtless thoughtfulness were always peaceful. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 I tried to stay awake as much as I could. The teacher suddenly asked me,\u201cMs. Y/l/n are you having difficulty in understanding any of these? Your eyes have become big like Donuts!\u201d Everyone started laughing at this. </p><p>\u201cNo sir I don\u2019t have any problems.\u201d This was so embarrassing. I promised to myself to never ever stay awake at night.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 The first lecture ended quickly after that, much to my convenience. The next one was about an hour later. I took out my phone to text Tae to meet me at the cafeteria. And at that moment I received a text from him.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"715\" data-orig-height=\"1246\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d091f584df520f0cfec00dc8c6399577/tumblr_picniiND1E1umxiba_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"715\" data-orig-height=\"1246\"></figure><p>I smiled at my phone screen and increased my pace towards the cafeteria. I was hungry too. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 When I arrived at the cafeteria I saw Tae was sitting at the far corner table by the window. He had already ordered burger and Coke, our favourites. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 While walking over to Tae I heard some of the girls talking at another table. </p><p>\u201cOMG! Taehyung is looking so hot just as usual! I just wish he would accept my proposal some day.\u201d said a really sweet voiced girl. </p><p>I slowed down my pace intentionally. </p><p>\u201c Oh, don\u2019t keep your hopes up Lilith. Almost all the girls here are dreaming about that!\u201d scoffed a deep voiced girl. </p><p>\u201cBut why is that newly transferred girl from my literature lecture walking over to him?\u201d this was said by another girl with a ringing voice. I couldn\u2019t believe it. Was I in a k-drama? I laughed mentally thinking what would they do once they know who I am? </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Tae was looking out the window deeply thinking something so he didn\u2019t notice me. What was he so absentminded for? </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cGuess you are really popular here, huh!\u201d My comment pulled Tae out from his deep thoughts. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Sometimes I really hate this setting of being soulmates. If you want you can block feelings from reaching your soulmate to a certain extent or completely. Tae did this a few times before. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <i>The most memorable incident was when in high school I started going out with my then crush. I didn\u2019t know at that time why Tae blocked his feelings. He started to disappear at different times along with Yoongs. I didn\u2019t push him much to tell me because I knew that he will tell me everything at the right time. And after a few days Tae invited himself and Yoongs over to one of our dinner dates. Until we finished eating they both were quite calm and chatted friendly with c/n.</i></p><p><i>After ordering dessert Yoongs asked c/n,\u201cI didn\u2019t know c/n that you are so talented!\u201d </i></p><p><i>C/n chuckled,\u201cwell I guess I am quite talented. May be that\u2019s why y/n likes me,\u201d I blushed and looked down. Tae looked at me and then at c/n with an unreadable expression. </i></p><p><i>Yoongs smirked,\u201cYou must be pretty talented, making so many girls fall for you! And you must have a pretty big heart too.. liking back all those girls! Isn\u2019t it difficult?\u201d </i></p><p><i>Tae kept his chin on his hands and smiled at c/n. Confused, I looked at Tae and then at c/n. I exclaimed,\u201cTae give me your phone!\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cGladly\u201d he fished out his phone and gave it to me. I instantly opened his phone\u2019s gallery\u2019s camera section and saw the pictures. There were photos of c/n with other girls and anyone could tell that they were couples. I looked at c/n who was stuttering and trying to mutter something. </i></p><p><i>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 I said curtly,\u201cYou are going to pay for all of the things you have done.\u201d Saying this I stood up. Tae and Yoongs stood up too to leave with me. </i></p><p><i>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 On our way out Tae walked over to the waitress and said,\u201c Ma'am, our friend sitting over there at the table will pay the bill. Thank you and have a great evening.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I didn\u2019t realise that I was walking so fast that Tae and Yoongs had to literally run to catch up to me. When we got far enough I stopped on my tracks. Yoongs huffed after reaching me,\u201c I didn\u2019t know you could walk so fast! Who is Usain Bolt? I only know y/n y/l/n.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t walk anymore. I collapsed in Yoongs\u2019 arms and started sobbing violently. I didn\u2019t want Tae to feel the pain that I was feeling in my heart. That day I learnt how to stop my feelings from reaching Tae. </i></p><p><i>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 He took me in his arms and walked a little distance. I didn\u2019t know that we were so close to the park. He made me sit on a swing and looked at my face for sometime as if he was trying to find something there. </i></p><p><i>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cYou are so ugly! I wonder why he dated you!\u201d he blurted out suddenly. \u201cHe surely has a bad taste but the other girls were beautiful.\u201d he put his right hand under his chin and pretended to think hard. </i></p><p><i>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 I looked at him and kicked his legs,\u201cYah! You jerk!\u201d I turned my face away from him. </i></p><p><i>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to hide the smile.\u201d he hummed and I couldn\u2019t control my smile. </i></p><p><i>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 As I was brushing off my tears Yoongs knelt in front of me and held both of my hands,\u201c Look in front of you. What do you see?\u201d </i></p><p><i>I lifted my face up and said,\u201cThe castle!\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYeah right! The same castle that you dream to be queen of. Don\u2019t you think that you are worth more? You ARE a queen. So don\u2019t waste your tears on someone who doesn\u2019t even know how to treasure something so precious. I know there\u2019ll be someone who will come with a heart big enough to treasure and protect all the love that you\u2019ll offer and will give you a lot more back!\u201d </i></p><p><i>Yoongs smiled at me and I don\u2019t know why but those words made me happy and determined to move on. </i></p><p><i>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cLet\u2019s get going then and get some ice cream. Shall we?\u201d Yoongs flashed his gummy smile and lead us. </i></p><p><i>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 That was the day when Tae\u2019s admiration for Yoongs turned into love. </i></p><h2><a href=\"https://apotatomashedbybts.tumblr.com/post/183268583966/ill-be-your-knight-masterlist\">Other chapters</a></h2><p><b>A/n:</b> thank you for reading.

Ok?\u201d Yoongi said peeking through the car\u2019s window, smiling. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 I gave him a small smile and waved goodbye. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 My alarm had never been my friend but today I thought it was. Because it saved my sleepy late ass by singing relentlessly since 8 am. When I finally gave in it was already 9am and Yoongs never liked waiting. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 I finished my morning routine, got ready and called Tae. I heard him shout from under my window, \u201cCome out you bum! It\u2019s already 9:45!\u201d </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 I fell asleep pretty late last night thinking about the castle. I don\u2019t know why but the castle had always attracted me. It\u2019s owners lived abroad and never visited. There were servants employed to maintain it. I had a plan ready that in the future I\u2019ll earn enough money to buy the castle. But I think that either the owners are back or someone became rich earlier than me. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 I quickly came out with my bicycle and we rode together towards the park. </p><p>.</p><p>. </p><p>Can you tell me the exact feeling when you feel the warmth of the sun on your skin in a chilly winter morning? Or the feeling when you see an oasis after being lost in a desert? That\u2019s what I felt like when I first saw him. He was collecting letters from the mailbox of the castle. That glowing skin, that flawless smile when few children passed by him made him look like he was the happiest child, that eye smile, that blonde hair, plush lips made me stop on my way. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 When we reached the park he had already gone inside. </p><p>\u201cYah! Don\u2019t step on my precious foot, you brat!\u201d Yoongs exclaimed \u201cWhere are your eyes?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIs it love at first sight?\u201d Tae\u2019s expression was thoughtful,\u201c How can you skip more than one heart beat? Are you even alive?\u201d </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Shocked, I looked at Tae and realised the emotion that I was feeling. \u201cIs it really that?\u201d I was confused. I looked over at the castle and wondered was that dream all those years ago about this?</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Tae clapped to draw our attention and said,\u201cI think we should head home for now. Y/n/n needs to clear her head!\u201d Tae was right and I was thankful. </p><p>\u201cTae, is this really love?\u201d </p><p>\u201cy/n/n, it\u2019s 2 am! If it isn\u2019t love then why did you call me instead of sleeping that you love to do so much? And if the feelings aren\u2019t that strong then why am I feeling them too? Why did your breath hitched the moment you saw him?\u201d </p><p>\u201cBut what should I do now?\u201d </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s play overwatch! Ok? You can\u2019t sleep anyways! And that won\u2019t let me sleep. So, by this we can kill the night. Now keep the phone down and login. I\u2019m waiting!\u201d </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Despite of being soulmates there are some areas where we just don\u2019t want to reside. One of them is playing overwatch. I can\u2019t play violent games or shooting games. Those are just too stimulating for me. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 This overwatch account though was made last year as a result of Tae\u2019s endless whining because he missed me and wanted to talk to me. At the same time he couldn\u2019t miss overwatch. So this was the solution that he came up with. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 The night ended quickly by hearing Tae\u2019s loud cheers and me being absent minded most of the time. But Tae didn\u2019t give up, he never does. He kept on making jokes to lighten the atmosphere and at some point I did forget about the day\u2019s uneasiness and cracked jokes with Tae. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Well, apparently it seemed that staying up the night was a really bad idea and that became a regret when I started to doze off in the very first lecture at the university. \u201cGreat! First day at uni and I am already going to get a sleepy nickname.\u201d That was all I could think about at that time. These moments of thoughtless thoughtfulness were always peaceful. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 I tried to stay awake as much as I could. The teacher suddenly asked me,\u201cMs. Y/l/n are you having difficulty in understanding any of these? Your eyes have become big like Donuts!\u201d Everyone started laughing at this. </p><p>\u201cNo sir I don\u2019t have any problems.\u201d This was so embarrassing. I promised to myself to never ever stay awake at night.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 The first lecture ended quickly after that, much to my convenience. The next one was about an hour later. I took out my phone to text Tae to meet me at the cafeteria. And at that moment I received a text from him.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"715\" data-orig-height=\"1246\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d091f584df520f0cfec00dc8c6399577/tumblr_picniiND1E1umxiba_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"715\" data-orig-height=\"1246\"></figure><p>I smiled at my phone screen and increased my pace towards the cafeteria. I was hungry too. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 When I arrived at the cafeteria I saw Tae was sitting at the far corner table by the window. He had already ordered burger and Coke, our favourites. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 While walking over to Tae I heard some of the girls talking at another table. </p><p>\u201cOMG! Taehyung is looking so hot just as usual! I just wish he would accept my proposal some day.\u201d said a really sweet voiced girl. </p><p>I slowed down my pace intentionally. </p><p>\u201c Oh, don\u2019t keep your hopes up Lilith. Almost all the girls here are dreaming about that!\u201d scoffed a deep voiced girl. </p><p>\u201cBut why is that newly transferred girl from my literature lecture walking over to him?\u201d this was said by another girl with a ringing voice. I couldn\u2019t believe it. Was I in a k-drama? I laughed mentally thinking what would they do once they know who I am? </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Tae was looking out the window deeply thinking something so he didn\u2019t notice me. What was he so absentminded for? </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cGuess you are really popular here, huh!\u201d My comment pulled Tae out from his deep thoughts. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Sometimes I really hate this setting of being soulmates. If you want you can block feelings from reaching your soulmate to a certain extent or completely. Tae did this a few times before. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <i>The most memorable incident was when in high school I started going out with my then crush. I didn\u2019t know at that time why Tae blocked his feelings. He started to disappear at different times along with Yoongs. I didn\u2019t push him much to tell me because I knew that he will tell me everything at the right time. And after a few days Tae invited himself and Yoongs over to one of our dinner dates. Until we finished eating they both were quite calm and chatted friendly with c/n.</i></p><p><i>After ordering dessert Yoongs asked c/n,\u201cI didn\u2019t know c/n that you are so talented!\u201d </i></p><p><i>C/n chuckled,\u201cwell I guess I am quite talented. May be that\u2019s why y/n likes me,\u201d I blushed and looked down. Tae looked at me and then at c/n with an unreadable expression. </i></p><p><i>Yoongs smirked,\u201cYou must be pretty talented, making so many girls fall for you! And you must have a pretty big heart too.. liking back all those girls! Isn\u2019t it difficult?\u201d </i></p><p><i>Tae kept his chin on his hands and smiled at c/n. Confused, I looked at Tae and then at c/n. I exclaimed,\u201cTae give me your phone!\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cGladly\u201d he fished out his phone and gave it to me. I instantly opened his phone\u2019s gallery\u2019s camera section and saw the pictures. There were photos of c/n with other girls and anyone could tell that they were couples. I looked at c/n who was stuttering and trying to mutter something. </i></p><p><i>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 I said curtly,\u201cYou are going to pay for all of the things you have done.\u201d Saying this I stood up. Tae and Yoongs stood up too to leave with me. </i></p><p><i>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 On our way out Tae walked over to the waitress and said,\u201c Ma'am, our friend sitting over there at the table will pay the bill. Thank you and have a great evening.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I didn\u2019t realise that I was walking so fast that Tae and Yoongs had to literally run to catch up to me. When we got far enough I stopped on my tracks. Yoongs huffed after reaching me,\u201c I didn\u2019t know you could walk so fast! Who is Usain Bolt? I only know y/n y/l/n.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t walk anymore. I collapsed in Yoongs\u2019 arms and started sobbing violently. I didn\u2019t want Tae to feel the pain that I was feeling in my heart. That day I learnt how to stop my feelings from reaching Tae. </i></p><p><i>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 He took me in his arms and walked a little distance. I didn\u2019t know that we were so close to the park. He made me sit on a swing and looked at my face for sometime as if he was trying to find something there. </i></p><p><i>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cYou are so ugly! I wonder why he dated you!\u201d he blurted out suddenly. \u201cHe surely has a bad taste but the other girls were beautiful.\u201d he put his right hand under his chin and pretended to think hard. </i></p><p><i>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 I looked at him and kicked his legs,\u201cYah! You jerk!\u201d I turned my face away from him. </i></p><p><i>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to hide the smile.\u201d he hummed and I couldn\u2019t control my smile. </i></p><p><i>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 As I was brushing off my tears Yoongs knelt in front of me and held both of my hands,\u201c Look in front of you. What do you see?\u201d </i></p><p><i>I lifted my face up and said,\u201cThe castle!\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYeah right! The same castle that you dream to be queen of. Don\u2019t you think that you are worth more? You ARE a queen. So don\u2019t waste your tears on someone who doesn\u2019t even know how to treasure something so precious. I know there\u2019ll be someone who will come with a heart big enough to treasure and protect all the love that you\u2019ll offer and will give you a lot more back!\u201d </i></p><p><i>Yoongs smiled at me and I don\u2019t know why but those words made me happy and determined to move on. </i></p><p><i>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cLet\u2019s get going then and get some ice cream.

We used to visit here since middle school and aunt always tolerated our baseless naughtiness. </p><p>&ldquo; So three servings of samgyeopsal and three glasses of coke, right?&rdquo; aunt asked us while leading us to our favourite table. </p><p>&ldquo;Aunt you remember that?!&rdquo; I asked surprised. </p><p>&ldquo;Of course I remember! How could I even forget? Every weekend that was your addiction!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Do you remember aunt how y/n/n snapped when that weekend your new employee tried to suggest her some new dishes?&rdquo; Tae said laughing. </p><p>&ldquo;How can I even forget? And also that time when she punched that guy who got drunk and behaved badly with me! Oh my! How much all of you have grown up!&rdquo; Aunt exclaimed sighing.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;The habit of feeling sleepy after heavy eating is never going to leave me.&rdquo; I thought as I was drowsing off in the back seat while Tae was chatting relentlessly in the front seat beside Yoongs while returning. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; After a few moments I was suddenly wide awake and Yoongs coughed signalling Tae to something. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Tae weren&rsquo;t you trying to tell me something at the club?&rdquo; I said while sitting upright. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo; Yes y/n/n, there&rsquo;s something you should know.&rdquo; Tae looked at Yoongs and continued, &ldquo;The castle has been taken over.&rdquo; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I sprang from my seat, &ldquo;Tell me you are joking!&rdquo; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tae scratched the back of his head, &ldquo;I am not joking. It&rsquo;s the truth.&rdquo; I knew Tae wasn&rsquo;t lying. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I leaned back to my seat with a thud,&ldquo;Wow! Great!&rdquo; I scoffed. I didn&rsquo;t expect this. &ldquo;I was supposed to be the queen.&rdquo; I whined and pouted. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; As I calmed down and sat quietly, a frown permanent on my face, the street lights, the sound of the busy road slowly faded away&hellip;</p><p><i>&ldquo;One day I&rsquo;ll be the queen of this castle!&rdquo; exclaimed a dreamy eyed eleven years old Y/n. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;And I will be the king!&rdquo; exclaimed a giggly faced Y/n&rsquo;s best friend. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;But then we have to marry each other.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Friends can marry each other I think. &lsquo;I do&rsquo; this is what you have to say to get married.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;And kiss too.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Ew I won&rsquo;t kiss you.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;But if you become king then we get to stay together forever!&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What about Yoongi hyung?&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll marry both of you, you two can be kings and I&rsquo;ll be your queen and we&rsquo;ll be able to stay together!&rdquo; with a content and proud expression Y/n nodded, &ldquo;Yes! A perfect plan!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All these conversations were taking place in the local park facing the famous castle in the neighborhood. After turning right at the end of the road where Y/n and Tae lives, the road continues for about five minutes if you walk and then it takes a left turn and there is the park at the left side where all the kids of the neighborhood go in the afternoons and evenings. And the castle was just on the opposite side. </i></p><p><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The castle was surrounded by a big boundary and the area was covered in different types of plants and trees. But one can see the yellow coloured castle through the huge gate. </i></p><p><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;I had a dream yesterday and it was so real!&rdquo; Y/n exclaimed when she arrived at the park with Tae.

It&rsquo;s so late already. Go!&rdquo; Tae said while he held the gate open for me. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh! Yeah, yeah. Bye Tae. Bye Yoongs.&rdquo; said a still absentminded me. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey y/n/n, let&rsquo;s meet up tomorrow morning 10 o&rsquo; clock at the park. Ok?&rdquo; Yoongi said peeking through the car&rsquo;s window, smiling. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I gave him a small smile and waved goodbye. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; My alarm had never been my friend but today I thought it was.

He kept on making jokes to lighten the atmosphere and at some point I did forget about the day&rsquo;s uneasiness and cracked jokes with Tae. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Well, apparently it seemed that staying up the night was a really bad idea and that became a regret when I started to doze off in the very first lecture at the university. &ldquo;Great! First day at uni and I am already going to get a sleepy nickname.&rdquo; That was all I could think about at that time. These moments of thoughtless thoughtfulness were always peaceful. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I tried to stay awake as much as I could. The teacher suddenly asked me,&ldquo;Ms. Y/l/n are you having difficulty in understanding any of these? Your eyes have become big like Donuts!&rdquo; Everyone started laughing at this. </p><p>&ldquo;No sir I don&rsquo;t have any problems.&rdquo; This was so embarrassing. I promised to myself to never ever stay awake at night.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The first lecture ended quickly after that, much to my convenience. The next one was about an hour later. I took out my phone to text Tae to meet me at the cafeteria. And at that moment I received a text from him.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d091f584df520f0cfec00dc8c6399577/tumblr_picniiND1E1umxiba_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>I smiled at my phone screen and increased my pace towards the cafeteria. I was hungry too. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; When I arrived at the cafeteria I saw Tae was sitting at the far corner table by the window. He had already ordered burger and Coke, our favourites. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; While walking over to Tae I heard some of the girls talking at another table. </p><p>&ldquo;OMG! Taehyung is looking so hot just as usual! I just wish he would accept my proposal some day.&rdquo; said a really sweet voiced girl. </p><p>I slowed down my pace intentionally. </p><p>&ldquo; Oh, don&rsquo;t keep your hopes up Lilith. Almost all the girls here are dreaming about that!&rdquo; scoffed a deep voiced girl. </p><p>&ldquo;But why is that newly transferred girl from my literature lecture walking over to him?&rdquo; this was said by another girl with a ringing voice. I couldn&rsquo;t believe it. Was I in a k-drama? I laughed mentally thinking what would they do once they know who I am? </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Tae was looking out the window deeply thinking something so he didn&rsquo;t notice me. What was he so absentminded for? </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Guess you are really popular here, huh!&rdquo; My comment pulled Tae out from his deep thoughts. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes I really hate this setting of being soulmates. If you want you can block feelings from reaching your soulmate to a certain extent or completely. Tae did this a few times before. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>The most memorable incident was when in high school I started going out with my then crush. I didn&rsquo;t know at that time why Tae blocked his feelings. He started to disappear at different times along with Yoongs. I didn&rsquo;t push him much to tell me because I knew that he will tell me everything at the right time. And after a few days Tae invited himself and Yoongs over to one of our dinner dates. Until we finished eating they both were quite calm and chatted friendly with c/n.</i></p><p><i>After ordering dessert Yoongs asked c/n,&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know c/n that you are so talented!&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>C/n chuckled,&ldquo;well I guess I am quite talented. May be that&rsquo;s why y/n likes me,&rdquo; I blushed and looked down. Tae looked at me and then at c/n with an unreadable expression. </i></p><p><i>Yoongs smirked,&ldquo;You must be pretty talented, making so many girls fall for you! And you must have a pretty big heart too.. liking back all those girls! Isn&rsquo;t it difficult?&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>Tae kept his chin on his hands and smiled at c/n. Confused, I looked at Tae and then at c/n. I exclaimed,&ldquo;Tae give me your phone!&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Gladly&rdquo; he fished out his phone and gave it to me. I instantly opened his phone&rsquo;s gallery&rsquo;s camera section and saw the pictures. There were photos of c/n with other girls and anyone could tell that they were couples. I looked at c/n who was stuttering and trying to mutter something. </i></p><p><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I said curtly,&ldquo;You are going to pay for all of the things you have done.&rdquo; Saying this I stood up. Tae and Yoongs stood up too to leave with me. </i></p><p><i>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; On our way out Tae walked over to the waitress and said,&ldquo; Ma'am, our friend sitting over there at the table will pay the bill. Thank you and have a great evening.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t realise that I was walking so fast that Tae and Yoongs had to literally run to catch up to me. When we got far enough I stopped on my tracks. Yoongs huffed after reaching me,&ldquo; I didn&rsquo;t know you could walk so fast! Who is Usain Bolt? I only know y/n y/l/n.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t walk anymore. I collapsed in Yoongs&rsquo; arms and started sobbing violently. I didn&rsquo;t want Tae to feel the pain that I was feeling in my heart. That day I learnt how to stop my feelings from reaching Tae. </i></p><p><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He took me in his arms and walked a little distance. I didn&rsquo;t know that we were so close to the park. He made me sit on a swing and looked at my face for sometime as if he was trying to find something there. </i></p><p><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;You are so ugly! I wonder why he dated you!&rdquo; he blurted out suddenly. &ldquo;He surely has a bad taste but the other girls were beautiful.&rdquo; he put his right hand under his chin and pretended to think hard. </i></p><p><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I looked at him and kicked his legs,&ldquo;Yah! You jerk!&rdquo; I turned my face away from him. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to hide the smile.&rdquo; he hummed and I couldn&rsquo;t control my smile. </i></p><p><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; As I was brushing off my tears Yoongs knelt in front of me and held both of my hands,&ldquo; Look in front of you. What do you see?&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>I lifted my face up and said,&ldquo;The castle!&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yeah right! The same castle that you dream to be queen of. Don&rsquo;t you think that you are worth more? You ARE a queen. So don&rsquo;t waste your tears on someone who doesn&rsquo;t even know how to treasure something so precious. I know there&rsquo;ll be someone who will come with a heart big enough to treasure and protect all the love that you&rsquo;ll offer and will give you a lot more back!&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>Yoongs smiled at me and I don&rsquo;t know why but those words made me happy and determined to move on. </i></p><p><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get going then and get some ice cream. Shall we?&rdquo; Yoongs flashed his gummy smile and lead us. </i></p><p><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; That was the day when Tae&rsquo;s admiration for Yoongs turned into love. </i></p><h2><a href=\"https://apotatomashedbybts.tumblr.com/post/183268583966/ill-be-your-knight-masterlist\">Other chapters</a></h2><p><b>A/n:</b> thank you for reading.

I love the mellow chill sound of this track. RM really showcases his vocal ability in addition to his rapping skills. Namjoon is a member that is really well rounded and this song really showcases that. Moonchild is an amazing track and I will definitely be checking out the rest of his newest mixtape this weekend. <br/></p><p>[C] I\u2019m still so behind, I knew he released this I just haven\u2019t gotten around to listening to it so here I am. RM hasn\u2019t let me down yet so I have hopes for this track. I haven\u2019t listened to the rest of the album yet but I can tell you this track will probably be my favourite right now just listening to it I want to just sit here with this on repeat. I\u2019ll definitely be listening to it for a while now.<br/></p>",
