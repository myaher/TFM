They tackled issues like mental health, religion and LGBTQ+ in a very honest way but never forget to show you that at the end of the day it\u2019s going to be okay. OG SKAM was magical because sometimes the actors had pimples and sometimes their hair was greasy and sometimes their makeup just wasn\u2019t perfect. It was magical because they talked like a normal teen would and they did all that stupid stuff that teens do. SKAM was never about making another American teen drama where 25 yo models play the lead. It was about showing how shit things can get and how they get better. </p><p>Season 3 was FINALLY the representation of two LGBTQA+ characters and their journey - and it felt like their story could have happened in real life. Tarjej and Henrik are both without a doubt good looking - whatever that means anyway - but not ONCE did they look like someone in a magazine or on a billboard. They were average Norwegian boys. Their relationship didn\u2019t just happen but it was also never tragic. Even is pan and struggles with mental illness and it\u2019s god damn relevant. We don\u2019t see LGBTQA+ relationships like that often. But we need to see them - so badly! So stop fetishising Isak\u2018s and Even\u2019s characters. I know french Even is literally a model (and frankly they couldn\u2019t have chosen a better guy!) but other Evens won\u2019t. And maybe some Even\u2019s will have a different storyline. And that\u2019s okay because it means that they will give other minorities a voice. Season 3 isn\u2019t your soft version of \u201cstraight men watching lesbian porn\u201d.

It\u2019s so interesting though. </p><p>Strangely, I think Mika gives the best advice of the 3\u2026 but Eskild would be who I\u2019d want with me at Pride and having a cuppa with and I\u2019d want to be friends with Filippo so I guess that sums it up!!!</p>",
                "content": "<p>GOD! This is a question and a half&hellip;</p><p>I feel like I can only comment on Eskild, Filippo and Mika as I don&rsquo;t feel like I know Hans all that well and I haven&rsquo;t seen any of the other remakes as I have got time to keep up with them all!</p><p>So out of the 3 I do know&hellip; it&rsquo;s a really difficult one.</p><p>They all share some specific similarities like fierce protection and pride and commitment to the LGBT+ community and some inate wish to care for baby gays! </p><p>Difference wise&hellip; Eskild was kind of a mother hen, a fussy over protective kind of figure but who loved fiercely even if he could be petty but he was lonely and also deeply emotional at times. That Eskild and Linn scene still makes me cry. Eskild was a bit of an attention seeker but I think it masked a lot of other stuff. </p><p>Filippo is undoubtedly the coolest guru! He has style and strikes me as the most composed of the 3. Like, he&rsquo;s into photography and is artistic and a little rebellious. He&rsquo;s also sarcastic and up front and funny and says whatever he thinks&hellip; he&rsquo;s also got a decent knowledge of film because he brings movies up all the time! He&rsquo;s also perceptive and kind. What he did for Marti was so special and he genuinely stepped up for Marti the morning in Milan and was like a wiser older role model for him. </p><p>Mika is more vocal, more in your face and less bothered about people liking him it seems. He doesn&rsquo;t give a shit! He&rsquo;s bold and has no filter and can also be cutting at times to the detriment of people around him. He&rsquo;s loud and has a bit more of an aggressive personality than the others but he does care and he has more of a tough love attitude.</p><p>I think it&rsquo;s difficult to say what they&rsquo;d think of each other! I think Eskild would think Filippo was attractive as hell with his piercings and cool hair and style and I think they&rsquo;d get on in terms of temperament but Eskild was anything but cool and edgy haha</p><p>Mika is kind of a Marmite person so he&rsquo;s someone you either love or hate so I don&rsquo;t know what the others would think! </p><p>It&rsquo;s a vvvvv difficult one as they&rsquo;re all v different even if they are versions of the same character! It&rsquo;s so interesting though. </p><p>Strangely, I think Mika gives the best advice of the 3&hellip; but Eskild would be who I&rsquo;d want with me at Pride and having a cuppa with and I&rsquo;d want to be friends with Filippo so I guess that sums it up!!!</p>",
