Peter loses track of time while on patrol, and Tony isn\u2019t happy about it.</b></i></p><p>Peter hadn\u2019t <i>meant </i>to stay out on patrol two hours later\nthan he should have, but he did. He blamed the cute cats he just <i>had</i> to stop and pet while swinging\nthrough the streets.</p><p>Of course, nothing ever <i>meant </i>to happen with Peter Parker. He\u2019d simply lost track of time and somehow forgot Tony\u2019s rule of \u201ccome home at eleven pm.\u201d He hadn\u2019t really thought about looking up to the sky for\njust a brief second and figuring out that the it was pitch black, covered in stars, and <i>well </i>past eleven. It wasn\u2019t\nthat he <i>hated </i>the rule \u2013 he knew Tony was only thinking of him when it came to\nexam season and getting in enough sleep \u2013 but he wished he had just a little\nmore time. Still, this didn\u2019t get rid of the fact that this hadn\u2019t meant to\nhappen at <i>all</i>. Usually, Tony would check his watch, see that it was one minute\nto eleven, sigh and shake his head at the fact that Peter still hadn\u2019t come\nhome and begin to leave his workshop and head upstairs to wait for the\nrebellious child, only for Peter to come swinging in through the door when the\nclock reached <i>exactly </i>eleven pm, face as red as his suit and breaths coming in\nheavy gasps. There\u2019d still be a giddy smile on his face, though. The one thing\nthat had driven Tony away from lecturing him every damn time.</p><p>Of course, Karen had completely given up telling Peter that it was time to head home. The kid would readily comply, swing to the next building, find\na cat perched on the roof and then spend the next hour petting it. Then,\nanother cat would join and ask for Peter\u2019s attention, and then another, and\nthen another\u2026 until the AI decided it would probably be best to just call Tony\nand let him do the speaking.</p><p>\u201cCalling Mr Stark.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes widened at the sound of Karen\u2019s voice and the\nsudden tell-tale <i>\u2018beep, beep\u2019</i> of the phone ringing which followed after. \u201cKaren!\u201d he\nsquealed (though he\u2019d never admit he did). The cat in his lap meowed and nudged\nhis side in an effortless attempt to get the kid\u2019s hand back on her belly.\nPeter, however, was not focusing entirely on the cat for once in his short\nlife. He checked the time and his mouth dropped open the tiniest bit as \u201912:47\u2019\nblinked back at him. He stared at it for a while until the white light (that he\ncould have <i>sworn </i>was mocking him) became too much for his eyes.</p><p>He tried all he could to get Karen to hang up, even going so\nfar as to quickly try and get out of the suit before his mentor answered.\nNevertheless, as Parker luck so <i>loved </i>to follow him around everywhere, the\nbeeping he had wanted so badly to stop but now was practically <i>begging</i> to keep going went silent. With\na hint of hope, Peter ventured to ask the question that would inevitably tell\nhim if he was grounded or not. \u201cUm\u2026 Karen?\u201d There was a slight break in his\nvoice, and his hands were growing increasingly hot and sweaty. Deep down, he\nknew his AI hadn\u2019t ended the call, but he\u2019d had to at least try.</p><p>\u201cThis is Mr Stark.\u201d</p><p>Peter could tell the man wasn\u2019t exactly\u2026 <i>pleased </i>with him.\nHis voice had adopted an almost firm tone, something he rarely ever used with\nhim. He gulped. \u201cUh, y-yes. I know. Hi, Mr Stark, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, hi. Wanna tell me why you\u2019re\u2026 hm, let\u2019s see. Two.\nHours. <i>Late</i>?\u201d</p><p>Peter didn\u2019t even notice the cats moving off him one by one,\ndistaste in their steps as they pranced off; he was way too focused on trying\nto calm his breathing and pin all his attention on the man\u2019s voice. It wasn\u2019t that he was\n<i>scared </i>of the man, per se, he just\u2026 <i>well</i>. It was easier to handle when he was\nin a good mood, as you\u2019d probably expect.</p><p>Apparently, he was thinking too much to figure out an\nanswer, because Tony did something. He cleared his throat.</p><p>Peter would have screamed if he hadn\u2019t clapped his hand over\nhis mouth. </p><p>\u201cPeter, you better give me an answer, \u2018cause I\u2019m not happy\nright now.\u201d</p><p>The kid felt his heart swell with something he hadn\u2019t felt\nsince Tony took the suit from him. Shame. Like he had let the only man he cared\nabout \u2013 the only man he had left \u2013 down. That he\u2019d broken Tony\u2019s trust and he\u2019d never\nbe allowed back at the compound and he would hate him forever and he\u2019d take\nback what he said about getting him into MIT and he\u2019d never let him wear the Spider-Man suit again and he\u2019d never give it back and he\u2019d tell all the cats in the world never to\ngo near him again and-</p><p>\u201cKid, stop thinking what you\u2019re thinking, okay?\u201d Tony\u2019s\nvoice broke though his thoughts, voice sounding a little softer yet that\nsternness was still there. \u201cYou know it\u2019s not gonna happen, you know we\u2019re\ngonna sort this out, and you know nothing\u2019s gonna change. D\u2019you hear me?\u201d It\nnever ceased to amaze Peter how much Tony knew him. Nobody had <i>ever </i>been able\nto read him that well (save for maybe Ned) when they were standing right in\n<i>front </i>of him, never mind on the other end of a <i>phone</i>.</p><p>\u201cI-I guess\u2026\u201d So, he\u2019d found his voice. Probably not as\nfortunate as you\u2019d think.</p><p>The kid could imagine the billionaire\u2019s eyebrows shooting up\nto his hairline and his face adopting that \u2018are you serious?\u2019 look with the\nnext words he spoke. \u201cYou <i>guess</i>? Kid, I love you, okay? That enough proof for\nyou that everything\u2019s gonna be fine?\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded, though Tony couldn\u2019t see him, and gulped yet\nagain. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Right, then. I expect you\u2019re heading home right now?\u201d</p><p>Peter had never swung into motion so fast. His eyes widened\nand a string of web zoomed out of his shooter simultaneously and so fast he\ncould feel his blood rushing through his body. \u201cUh, yeah! Yeah, of course, Mr\nStark! En compound route- I mean, en route to\u2026 the compound\u2026 uh.\u201d He faltered. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re coming back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Yes. Exactly that.\u201d Why hadn\u2019t he just said he was on\nhis way to begin with?</p><p>\u201cOkay. So let\u2019s start talking.\u201d</p><p><i>Why?</i> \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re late, Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-yes. Yes, I am, and I\u2019m so sorry, Mr Stark, I swear-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay. Why are you late?\u201d</p><p>The kid gasped slightly as he almost missed catching the end\nof his web, grappling with it for a moment and cursing his nerves for making\nhim slip. He <i>never </i>slipped. \u201cYou alright, Pete?\u201d</p><p><i>Pete.</i></p><p>Somehow, that made him feel better already.</p><p>\u201cYeah, just\u2026 slipped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Wanna tell me, then?\u201d</p><p><i>\u2018Yeah, Mr Stark, I was playing with a bunch of cats like the five-year old I am.\u2019</i>\u00a0\u201cI\ngot side-tracked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSide-tracked, hey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere, uh- well. There were some, you know\u2026\u201d</p><p>He heard Tony sigh on the other end and bit his lip, still\nswinging from building to building and not really bothering to check whether\npeople were watching him or not. \u201cPete,\u201d came the man\u2019s voice, \u201cjust tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, well, uh, there, um\u2026 uh. Oh <i>my</i>- okay. There were\ncats, Mr Stark, okay? There were cute little cats everywhere and Karen told me\nI should head home and so I did but then I <i>had </i>to stop and stroke this little\nkitty \u2013 I named him Tony, by the way\u00a0\u2013\n\n and then, oh my God, Mr Stark, you\nshould\u2019ve <i>seen </i>them! All these cats came out of nowhere and I really tried,\nsir, but I just couldn\u2019t leave, you know? I mean, Bruce was on my lap, and Wolf\nwas climbing up my back, and you- I mean, Tony was licking my hand, and Tasha\njust wouldn\u2019t stop <i>meowing </i>at me! They were just\u2026 they were so <i>cute</i>, Mr Stark.\nPlease don\u2019t be mad.\u201d His voice went quiet at the end, as if he were about to\ncry (from the utter adorableness of the kittens or from the possible\ndisappointment his mentor may currently be feeling, he had no clue whatsoever)\nand both ends of the line went silent.</p><p>Tony didn\u2019t quite know what to say. He\u2019d expected the\nculprit to be cats, if he were being honest \u2013 it definitely wouldn\u2019t be the\nfirst time those little creatures stopped him on the street when they were\nwalking together and the billionaire would keep moving and talking until he\nrealized the kid had stopped several blocks back \u2013 but he had <i>not\n</i>expected that outburst.</p><p>On thing for sure, he was getting that kid a damn kitten.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Pete, calm down. Listen, I\u2019m not- I\u2019m not mad.\nDon\u2019t think I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou <i>seemed </i>it\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was a tad frustrated that you\u2019re two hours late home, but\nthat\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>Peter grimaced at the reminder. \u201cI\u2019m <i>really </i>sorry,\u201d he\napologised, \u201cbut I promise I\u2019ll go to bed as soon as I get home, and I\u2019ll cut\nrevision time back a little in the morning so I can sleep for longer, and I <i>swear </i>I\nwon\u2019t be tired-\u201c</p><p>\u201cKid, honestly, I don\u2019t care about your bedtime right now.\u201d</p><p>Unexpected. \u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. What I <i>care </i>about is the fact that anything could have\nhappened to you in those two hours. I <i>mean </i>it, Peter, <i>any</i>thing. I tell you to\ncome home at eleven because I have a set time I know you\u2019ll be back. Of course,\nI want you well rested for your exams, but I also\u2026 I guess\u2026\u201d Now <i>he </i>was\nstumbling on his words, god<i>dammit</i>. <i>He </i>wasn\u2019t the one being reprimanded, here! He\nsighed, putting his head in his hands from where he was sat on a seat by the\ndoor to the compound, waiting for the kid to get back. \u201cThe world\u2019s a dangerous\nplace, buddy. Seriously. I\u2019m not just saying that. There are- there are people\nout there. <i>Bad </i>people that will do anything to get their hands on Spider-Man. I\njust need to know you\u2019re safe, okay? If you\u2019re not home by eleven, then I know\nsomething may be wrong, and I can look into it. That\u2019s why I\u2019m so strict about\nthese rules. I can\u2019t have you getting hurt; on my watch, on <i>anybody\u2019s </i>watch.\nIt\u2019s <i>not </i>happening.\u201d</p><p>Peter bit his lip harder, feeling guilt swell inside his\nstomach. He looked up, tears shining in his eyes, and saw the compound in the\ndistance. He sniffed. \u201cI understand, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t do it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you won\u2019t.\u201d And he did. He knew it. He could tell\nthe kid was probably a little overwhelmed at the moment by what he\u2019d said, and\nwas most likely also feeling slightly upset by his words. Peter wasn\u2019t one to\nhave to be told off for something, whether it be by himself, someone else in the compound, or one of his\nteachers. He was a good boy. And this changed absolutely <i>nothing</i>.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mr Stark? Why didn\u2019t you call me <i>earlier </i>and ask where\nI was?\u201d</p><p>This was where Tony\u2019s face scrunched up a little in what\ncould only be described as embarrassment. He coughed slightly. \u201cUh, definitely didn\u2019t fall asleep.\nNope. Not me.\u201d</p><p>Peter laughed, and the carefree sound brought joy back to\nthe billionaire\u2019s heart as he stood and walked closer to the door, seeing the\nkid a little further away. \u201cThe great Mr Stark fell asleep? Wow. Whatever will\nbecome of you?\u201d</p><p>Tony chuckled. \u201cI know, right? It\u2019s a disgrace. FRIDAY woke\nme up and told me you still weren\u2019t home, but I didn\u2019t want to phone you, if\nwe\u2019re being honest, here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t? How come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I thought something might have happened. I checked\nyour location and you weren\u2019t moving like you would have been if you were\nswinging\u2026 you were still. And I thought that\u2026 maybe you\u2019d been kidnapped or\nyou\u2019d run into trouble\u2026 or worse.

Peter loses track of time while on patrol, and Tony isn\u2019t happy about it.</b></i></p><p>Peter hadn\u2019t <i>meant </i>to stay out on patrol two hours later\nthan he should have, but he did. He blamed the cute cats he just <i>had</i> to stop and pet while swinging\nthrough the streets.</p><p>Of course, nothing ever <i>meant </i>to happen with Peter Parker. He\u2019d simply lost track of time and somehow forgot Tony\u2019s rule of \u201ccome home at eleven pm.\u201d He hadn\u2019t really thought about looking up to the sky for\njust a brief second and figuring out that the it was pitch black, covered in stars, and <i>well </i>past eleven. It wasn\u2019t\nthat he <i>hated </i>the rule \u2013 he knew Tony was only thinking of him when it came to\nexam season and getting in enough sleep \u2013 but he wished he had just a little\nmore time. Still, this didn\u2019t get rid of the fact that this hadn\u2019t meant to\nhappen at <i>all</i>. Usually, Tony would check his watch, see that it was one minute\nto eleven, sigh and shake his head at the fact that Peter still hadn\u2019t come\nhome and begin to leave his workshop and head upstairs to wait for the\nrebellious child, only for Peter to come swinging in through the door when the\nclock reached <i>exactly </i>eleven pm, face as red as his suit and breaths coming in\nheavy gasps. There\u2019d still be a giddy smile on his face, though. The one thing\nthat had driven Tony away from lecturing him every damn time.</p><p>Of course, Karen had completely given up telling Peter that it was time to head home. The kid would readily comply, swing to the next building, find\na cat perched on the roof and then spend the next hour petting it. Then,\nanother cat would join and ask for Peter\u2019s attention, and then another, and\nthen another\u2026 until the AI decided it would probably be best to just call Tony\nand let him do the speaking.</p><p>\u201cCalling Mr Stark.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes widened at the sound of Karen\u2019s voice and the\nsudden tell-tale <i>\u2018beep, beep\u2019</i> of the phone ringing which followed after. \u201cKaren!\u201d he\nsquealed (though he\u2019d never admit he did). The cat in his lap meowed and nudged\nhis side in an effortless attempt to get the kid\u2019s hand back on her belly.\nPeter, however, was not focusing entirely on the cat for once in his short\nlife. He checked the time and his mouth dropped open the tiniest bit as \u201912:47\u2019\nblinked back at him. He stared at it for a while until the white light (that he\ncould have <i>sworn </i>was mocking him) became too much for his eyes.</p><p>He tried all he could to get Karen to hang up, even going so\nfar as to quickly try and get out of the suit before his mentor answered.\nNevertheless, as Parker luck so <i>loved </i>to follow him around everywhere, the\nbeeping he had wanted so badly to stop but now was practically <i>begging</i> to keep going went silent. With\na hint of hope, Peter ventured to ask the question that would inevitably tell\nhim if he was grounded or not. \u201cUm\u2026 Karen?\u201d There was a slight break in his\nvoice, and his hands were growing increasingly hot and sweaty. Deep down, he\nknew his AI hadn\u2019t ended the call, but he\u2019d had to at least try.</p><p>\u201cThis is Mr Stark.\u201d</p><p>Peter could tell the man wasn\u2019t exactly\u2026 <i>pleased </i>with him.\nHis voice had adopted an almost firm tone, something he rarely ever used with\nhim. He gulped. \u201cUh, y-yes. I know. Hi, Mr Stark, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, hi. Wanna tell me why you\u2019re\u2026 hm, let\u2019s see. Two.\nHours. <i>Late</i>?\u201d</p><p>Peter didn\u2019t even notice the cats moving off him one by one,\ndistaste in their steps as they pranced off; he was way too focused on trying\nto calm his breathing and pin all his attention on the man\u2019s voice. It wasn\u2019t that he was\n<i>scared </i>of the man, per se, he just\u2026 <i>well</i>. It was easier to handle when he was\nin a good mood, as you\u2019d probably expect.</p><p>Apparently, he was thinking too much to figure out an\nanswer, because Tony did something. He cleared his throat.</p><p>Peter would have screamed if he hadn\u2019t clapped his hand over\nhis mouth. </p><p>\u201cPeter, you better give me an answer, \u2018cause I\u2019m not happy\nright now.\u201d</p><p>The kid felt his heart swell with something he hadn\u2019t felt\nsince Tony took the suit from him. Shame. Like he had let the only man he cared\nabout \u2013 the only man he had left \u2013 down. That he\u2019d broken Tony\u2019s trust and he\u2019d never\nbe allowed back at the compound and he would hate him forever and he\u2019d take\nback what he said about getting him into MIT and he\u2019d never let him wear the Spider-Man suit again and he\u2019d never give it back and he\u2019d tell all the cats in the world never to\ngo near him again and-</p><p>\u201cKid, stop thinking what you\u2019re thinking, okay?\u201d Tony\u2019s\nvoice broke though his thoughts, voice sounding a little softer yet that\nsternness was still there. \u201cYou know it\u2019s not gonna happen, you know we\u2019re\ngonna sort this out, and you know nothing\u2019s gonna change. D\u2019you hear me?\u201d It\nnever ceased to amaze Peter how much Tony knew him. Nobody had <i>ever </i>been able\nto read him that well (save for maybe Ned) when they were standing right in\n<i>front </i>of him, never mind on the other end of a <i>phone</i>.</p><p>\u201cI-I guess\u2026\u201d So, he\u2019d found his voice. Probably not as\nfortunate as you\u2019d think.</p><p>The kid could imagine the billionaire\u2019s eyebrows shooting up\nto his hairline and his face adopting that \u2018are you serious?\u2019 look with the\nnext words he spoke. \u201cYou <i>guess</i>? Kid, I love you, okay? That enough proof for\nyou that everything\u2019s gonna be fine?\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded, though Tony couldn\u2019t see him, and gulped yet\nagain. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Right, then. I expect you\u2019re heading home right now?\u201d</p><p>Peter had never swung into motion so fast. His eyes widened\nand a string of web zoomed out of his shooter simultaneously and so fast he\ncould feel his blood rushing through his body. \u201cUh, yeah! Yeah, of course, Mr\nStark! En compound route- I mean, en route to\u2026 the compound\u2026 uh.\u201d He faltered. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re coming back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Yes. Exactly that.\u201d Why hadn\u2019t he just said he was on\nhis way to begin with?</p><p>\u201cOkay. So let\u2019s start talking.\u201d</p><p><i>Why?</i> \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re late, Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-yes. Yes, I am, and I\u2019m so sorry, Mr Stark, I swear-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay. Why are you late?\u201d</p><p>The kid gasped slightly as he almost missed catching the end\nof his web, grappling with it for a moment and cursing his nerves for making\nhim slip. He <i>never </i>slipped. \u201cYou alright, Pete?\u201d</p><p><i>Pete.</i></p><p>Somehow, that made him feel better already.</p><p>\u201cYeah, just\u2026 slipped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Wanna tell me, then?\u201d</p><p><i>\u2018Yeah, Mr Stark, I was playing with a bunch of cats like the five-year old I am.\u2019</i>\u00a0\u201cI\ngot side-tracked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSide-tracked, hey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere, uh- well. There were some, you know\u2026\u201d</p><p>He heard Tony sigh on the other end and bit his lip, still\nswinging from building to building and not really bothering to check whether\npeople were watching him or not. \u201cPete,\u201d came the man\u2019s voice, \u201cjust tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, well, uh, there, um\u2026 uh. Oh <i>my</i>- okay. There were\ncats, Mr Stark, okay? There were cute little cats everywhere and Karen told me\nI should head home and so I did but then I <i>had </i>to stop and stroke this little\nkitty \u2013 I named him Tony, by the way\u00a0\u2013\n\n and then, oh my God, Mr Stark, you\nshould\u2019ve <i>seen </i>them! All these cats came out of nowhere and I really tried,\nsir, but I just couldn\u2019t leave, you know? I mean, Bruce was on my lap, and Wolf\nwas climbing up my back, and you- I mean, Tony was licking my hand, and Tasha\njust wouldn\u2019t stop <i>meowing </i>at me! They were just\u2026 they were so <i>cute</i>, Mr Stark.\nPlease don\u2019t be mad.\u201d His voice went quiet at the end, as if he were about to\ncry (from the utter adorableness of the kittens or from the possible\ndisappointment his mentor may currently be feeling, he had no clue whatsoever)\nand both ends of the line went silent.</p><p>Tony didn\u2019t quite know what to say. He\u2019d expected the\nculprit to be cats, if he were being honest \u2013 it definitely wouldn\u2019t be the\nfirst time those little creatures stopped him on the street when they were\nwalking together and the billionaire would keep moving and talking until he\nrealized the kid had stopped several blocks back \u2013 but he had <i>not\n</i>expected that outburst.</p><p>On thing for sure, he was getting that kid a damn kitten.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Pete, calm down. Listen, I\u2019m not- I\u2019m not mad.\nDon\u2019t think I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou <i>seemed </i>it\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was a tad frustrated that you\u2019re two hours late home, but\nthat\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>Peter grimaced at the reminder. \u201cI\u2019m <i>really </i>sorry,\u201d he\napologised, \u201cbut I promise I\u2019ll go to bed as soon as I get home, and I\u2019ll cut\nrevision time back a little in the morning so I can sleep for longer, and I <i>swear </i>I\nwon\u2019t be tired-\u201c</p><p>\u201cKid, honestly, I don\u2019t care about your bedtime right now.\u201d</p><p>Unexpected. \u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. What I <i>care </i>about is the fact that anything could have\nhappened to you in those two hours. I <i>mean </i>it, Peter, <i>any</i>thing. I tell you to\ncome home at eleven because I have a set time I know you\u2019ll be back. Of course,\nI want you well rested for your exams, but I also\u2026 I guess\u2026\u201d Now <i>he </i>was\nstumbling on his words, god<i>dammit</i>. <i>He </i>wasn\u2019t the one being reprimanded, here! He\nsighed, putting his head in his hands from where he was sat on a seat by the\ndoor to the compound, waiting for the kid to get back. \u201cThe world\u2019s a dangerous\nplace, buddy. Seriously. I\u2019m not just saying that. There are- there are people\nout there. <i>Bad </i>people that will do anything to get their hands on Spider-Man. I\njust need to know you\u2019re safe, okay? If you\u2019re not home by eleven, then I know\nsomething may be wrong, and I can look into it. That\u2019s why I\u2019m so strict about\nthese rules. I can\u2019t have you getting hurt; on my watch, on <i>anybody\u2019s </i>watch.\nIt\u2019s <i>not </i>happening.\u201d</p><p>Peter bit his lip harder, feeling guilt swell inside his\nstomach. He looked up, tears shining in his eyes, and saw the compound in the\ndistance. He sniffed. \u201cI understand, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t do it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you won\u2019t.\u201d And he did. He knew it. He could tell\nthe kid was probably a little overwhelmed at the moment by what he\u2019d said, and\nwas most likely also feeling slightly upset by his words. Peter wasn\u2019t one to\nhave to be told off for something, whether it be by himself, someone else in the compound, or one of his\nteachers. He was a good boy. And this changed absolutely <i>nothing</i>.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mr Stark? Why didn\u2019t you call me <i>earlier </i>and ask where\nI was?\u201d</p><p>This was where Tony\u2019s face scrunched up a little in what\ncould only be described as embarrassment. He coughed slightly. \u201cUh, definitely didn\u2019t fall asleep.\nNope. Not me.\u201d</p><p>Peter laughed, and the carefree sound brought joy back to\nthe billionaire\u2019s heart as he stood and walked closer to the door, seeing the\nkid a little further away. \u201cThe great Mr Stark fell asleep? Wow. Whatever will\nbecome of you?\u201d</p><p>Tony chuckled. \u201cI know, right? It\u2019s a disgrace. FRIDAY woke\nme up and told me you still weren\u2019t home, but I didn\u2019t want to phone you, if\nwe\u2019re being honest, here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t? How come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I thought something might have happened. I checked\nyour location and you weren\u2019t moving like you would have been if you were\nswinging\u2026 you were still. And I thought that\u2026 maybe you\u2019d been kidnapped or\nyou\u2019d run into trouble\u2026 or worse. I didn\u2019t want to ring you and get no answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was playing with cats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you were. Would\u2019ve been nice to know.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo\u2026 you were scared?\u201d</p><p>Tony make a face. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say <i>scared</i>, exactly,\u201d he\ninsisted, \u201cjust\u2026 slightly concerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlightly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more than that.\u201d</p><p>At this point, a flash of red swung through the open door,\nlanding perfectly behind the billionaire. Peter turned and slipped off his\nmask, a grin plastered on his face. \u201cOf <i>course</i>, dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Tony rolled his eyes and hung up the phone,\ntossing it onto the couch before moving towards his boy. \u201cC\u2019mere, you.\u201d His\narms opened and Peter crashed into them, burying his face in the man\u2019s shirt and\nclinging onto the fabric. There was a happy smile gracing his lips, which made\nTony smile. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever do anything like that again, you hear me?\u201d he\nasked, landing a well-aimed poke to the boy\u2019s side.</p><p>Peter giggled and batted his hand away, nodding. \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey\u2026 am I grounded?\u201d</p><p>Tony rose both eyebrows. \u201cDo you think you <i>should </i>be?\u201d he\nasked as he crossed his arms.</p><p>Peter felt awkwardly put on the spot, fidgeting with his\nfingers and shuffling his feet. \u201cUm, I, uh, I-I <i>guess</i>, yeah? I\u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>The billionaire had to chuckle at the kid\u2019s stuttering,\nreaching down to ruffle his hair. \u201cYou\u2019re not grounded. I know\nyou won\u2019t do it again.\u201d</p><p>Peter smiled up at the man. \u201cSorry\u2026 again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019ve said. Stop it. I\u2019m getting bored of the word.\nIt\u2019s all sorted. Now, what was that about you heading straight to bed as soon\nas you got home?\u201d</p><p>The kid\u2019s eyes widened and he stepped back. \u201cRight! Yeah.\nOkay, I\u2019ll go, then. G\u2019night, Mr Stark!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight, buddy. Also, don\u2019t you set that alarm earlier than\nhalf six, alright? I\u2019ll know if you do!\u201d He made the \u2018I\u2019m watching you!\u2019\ngesture with his fingers, causing Peter to give a cheeky salute before rushing off\nto his room.</p><p>Tony watched him go with a sparkle in his eyes.

Still, this didn\u2019t get rid of the fact that this hadn\u2019t meant to\nhappen at <i>all</i>. Usually, Tony would check his watch, see that it was one minute\nto eleven, sigh and shake his head at the fact that Peter still hadn\u2019t come\nhome and begin to leave his workshop and head upstairs to wait for the\nrebellious child, only for Peter to come swinging in through the door when the\nclock reached <i>exactly </i>eleven pm, face as red as his suit and breaths coming in\nheavy gasps. There\u2019d still be a giddy smile on his face, though. The one thing\nthat had driven Tony away from lecturing him every damn time.</p><p>Of course, Karen had completely given up telling Peter that it was time to head home. The kid would readily comply, swing to the next building, find\na cat perched on the roof and then spend the next hour petting it. Then,\nanother cat would join and ask for Peter\u2019s attention, and then another, and\nthen another\u2026 until the AI decided it would probably be best to just call Tony\nand let him do the speaking.</p><p>\u201cCalling Mr Stark.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes widened at the sound of Karen\u2019s voice and the\nsudden tell-tale <i>\u2018beep, beep\u2019</i> of the phone ringing which followed after. \u201cKaren!\u201d he\nsquealed (though he\u2019d never admit he did). The cat in his lap meowed and nudged\nhis side in an effortless attempt to get the kid\u2019s hand back on her belly.\nPeter, however, was not focusing entirely on the cat for once in his short\nlife. He checked the time and his mouth dropped open the tiniest bit as \u201912:47\u2019\nblinked back at him. He stared at it for a while until the white light (that he\ncould have <i>sworn </i>was mocking him) became too much for his eyes.</p><p>He tried all he could to get Karen to hang up, even going so\nfar as to quickly try and get out of the suit before his mentor answered.\nNevertheless, as Parker luck so <i>loved </i>to follow him around everywhere, the\nbeeping he had wanted so badly to stop but now was practically <i>begging</i> to keep going went silent. With\na hint of hope, Peter ventured to ask the question that would inevitably tell\nhim if he was grounded or not. \u201cUm\u2026 Karen?\u201d There was a slight break in his\nvoice, and his hands were growing increasingly hot and sweaty. Deep down, he\nknew his AI hadn\u2019t ended the call, but he\u2019d had to at least try.</p><p>\u201cThis is Mr Stark.\u201d</p><p>Peter could tell the man wasn\u2019t exactly\u2026 <i>pleased </i>with him.\nHis voice had adopted an almost firm tone, something he rarely ever used with\nhim. He gulped. \u201cUh, y-yes. I know. Hi, Mr Stark, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, hi. Wanna tell me why you\u2019re\u2026 hm, let\u2019s see. Two.\nHours. <i>Late</i>?\u201d</p><p>Peter didn\u2019t even notice the cats moving off him one by one,\ndistaste in their steps as they pranced off; he was way too focused on trying\nto calm his breathing and pin all his attention on the man\u2019s voice. It wasn\u2019t that he was\n<i>scared </i>of the man, per se, he just\u2026 <i>well</i>. It was easier to handle when he was\nin a good mood, as you\u2019d probably expect.</p><p>Apparently, he was thinking too much to figure out an\nanswer, because Tony did something. He cleared his throat.</p><p>Peter would have screamed if he hadn\u2019t clapped his hand over\nhis mouth. </p><p>\u201cPeter, you better give me an answer, \u2018cause I\u2019m not happy\nright now.\u201d</p><p>The kid felt his heart swell with something he hadn\u2019t felt\nsince Tony took the suit from him. Shame. Like he had let the only man he cared\nabout \u2013 the only man he had left \u2013 down. That he\u2019d broken Tony\u2019s trust and he\u2019d never\nbe allowed back at the compound and he would hate him forever and he\u2019d take\nback what he said about getting him into MIT and he\u2019d never let him wear the Spider-Man suit again and he\u2019d never give it back and he\u2019d tell all the cats in the world never to\ngo near him again and-</p><p>\u201cKid, stop thinking what you\u2019re thinking, okay?\u201d Tony\u2019s\nvoice broke though his thoughts, voice sounding a little softer yet that\nsternness was still there. \u201cYou know it\u2019s not gonna happen, you know we\u2019re\ngonna sort this out, and you know nothing\u2019s gonna change. D\u2019you hear me?\u201d It\nnever ceased to amaze Peter how much Tony knew him. Nobody had <i>ever </i>been able\nto read him that well (save for maybe Ned) when they were standing right in\n<i>front </i>of him, never mind on the other end of a <i>phone</i>.</p><p>\u201cI-I guess\u2026\u201d So, he\u2019d found his voice. Probably not as\nfortunate as you\u2019d think.</p><p>The kid could imagine the billionaire\u2019s eyebrows shooting up\nto his hairline and his face adopting that \u2018are you serious?\u2019 look with the\nnext words he spoke. \u201cYou <i>guess</i>? Kid, I love you, okay? That enough proof for\nyou that everything\u2019s gonna be fine?\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded, though Tony couldn\u2019t see him, and gulped yet\nagain. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Right, then. I expect you\u2019re heading home right now?\u201d</p><p>Peter had never swung into motion so fast. His eyes widened\nand a string of web zoomed out of his shooter simultaneously and so fast he\ncould feel his blood rushing through his body. \u201cUh, yeah! Yeah, of course, Mr\nStark! En compound route- I mean, en route to\u2026 the compound\u2026 uh.\u201d He faltered. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re coming back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Yes. Exactly that.\u201d Why hadn\u2019t he just said he was on\nhis way to begin with?</p><p>\u201cOkay. So let\u2019s start talking.\u201d</p><p><i>Why?</i> \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re late, Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-yes. Yes, I am, and I\u2019m so sorry, Mr Stark, I swear-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay. Why are you late?\u201d</p><p>The kid gasped slightly as he almost missed catching the end\nof his web, grappling with it for a moment and cursing his nerves for making\nhim slip. He <i>never </i>slipped. \u201cYou alright, Pete?\u201d</p><p><i>Pete.</i></p><p>Somehow, that made him feel better already.</p><p>\u201cYeah, just\u2026 slipped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Wanna tell me, then?\u201d</p><p><i>\u2018Yeah, Mr Stark, I was playing with a bunch of cats like the five-year old I am.\u2019</i>\u00a0\u201cI\ngot side-tracked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSide-tracked, hey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere, uh- well. There were some, you know\u2026\u201d</p><p>He heard Tony sigh on the other end and bit his lip, still\nswinging from building to building and not really bothering to check whether\npeople were watching him or not. \u201cPete,\u201d came the man\u2019s voice, \u201cjust tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, well, uh, there, um\u2026 uh. Oh <i>my</i>- okay. There were\ncats, Mr Stark, okay? There were cute little cats everywhere and Karen told me\nI should head home and so I did but then I <i>had </i>to stop and stroke this little\nkitty \u2013 I named him Tony, by the way\u00a0\u2013\n\n and then, oh my God, Mr Stark, you\nshould\u2019ve <i>seen </i>them! All these cats came out of nowhere and I really tried,\nsir, but I just couldn\u2019t leave, you know? I mean, Bruce was on my lap, and Wolf\nwas climbing up my back, and you- I mean, Tony was licking my hand, and Tasha\njust wouldn\u2019t stop <i>meowing </i>at me! They were just\u2026 they were so <i>cute</i>, Mr Stark.\nPlease don\u2019t be mad.\u201d His voice went quiet at the end, as if he were about to\ncry (from the utter adorableness of the kittens or from the possible\ndisappointment his mentor may currently be feeling, he had no clue whatsoever)\nand both ends of the line went silent.</p><p>Tony didn\u2019t quite know what to say. He\u2019d expected the\nculprit to be cats, if he were being honest \u2013 it definitely wouldn\u2019t be the\nfirst time those little creatures stopped him on the street when they were\nwalking together and the billionaire would keep moving and talking until he\nrealized the kid had stopped several blocks back \u2013 but he had <i>not\n</i>expected that outburst.</p><p>On thing for sure, he was getting that kid a damn kitten.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Pete, calm down. Listen, I\u2019m not- I\u2019m not mad.\nDon\u2019t think I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou <i>seemed </i>it\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was a tad frustrated that you\u2019re two hours late home, but\nthat\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>Peter grimaced at the reminder. \u201cI\u2019m <i>really </i>sorry,\u201d he\napologised, \u201cbut I promise I\u2019ll go to bed as soon as I get home, and I\u2019ll cut\nrevision time back a little in the morning so I can sleep for longer, and I <i>swear </i>I\nwon\u2019t be tired-\u201c</p><p>\u201cKid, honestly, I don\u2019t care about your bedtime right now.\u201d</p><p>Unexpected. \u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. What I <i>care </i>about is the fact that anything could have\nhappened to you in those two hours. I <i>mean </i>it, Peter, <i>any</i>thing. I tell you to\ncome home at eleven because I have a set time I know you\u2019ll be back. Of course,\nI want you well rested for your exams, but I also\u2026 I guess\u2026\u201d Now <i>he </i>was\nstumbling on his words, god<i>dammit</i>. <i>He </i>wasn\u2019t the one being reprimanded, here! He\nsighed, putting his head in his hands from where he was sat on a seat by the\ndoor to the compound, waiting for the kid to get back. \u201cThe world\u2019s a dangerous\nplace, buddy. Seriously. I\u2019m not just saying that. There are- there are people\nout there. <i>Bad </i>people that will do anything to get their hands on Spider-Man. I\njust need to know you\u2019re safe, okay? If you\u2019re not home by eleven, then I know\nsomething may be wrong, and I can look into it. That\u2019s why I\u2019m so strict about\nthese rules. I can\u2019t have you getting hurt; on my watch, on <i>anybody\u2019s </i>watch.\nIt\u2019s <i>not </i>happening.\u201d</p><p>Peter bit his lip harder, feeling guilt swell inside his\nstomach. He looked up, tears shining in his eyes, and saw the compound in the\ndistance. He sniffed. \u201cI understand, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t do it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you won\u2019t.\u201d And he did. He knew it. He could tell\nthe kid was probably a little overwhelmed at the moment by what he\u2019d said, and\nwas most likely also feeling slightly upset by his words. Peter wasn\u2019t one to\nhave to be told off for something, whether it be by himself, someone else in the compound, or one of his\nteachers. He was a good boy. And this changed absolutely <i>nothing</i>.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mr Stark? Why didn\u2019t you call me <i>earlier </i>and ask where\nI was?\u201d</p><p>This was where Tony\u2019s face scrunched up a little in what\ncould only be described as embarrassment. He coughed slightly. \u201cUh, definitely didn\u2019t fall asleep.\nNope. Not me.\u201d</p><p>Peter laughed, and the carefree sound brought joy back to\nthe billionaire\u2019s heart as he stood and walked closer to the door, seeing the\nkid a little further away. \u201cThe great Mr Stark fell asleep? Wow. Whatever will\nbecome of you?\u201d</p><p>Tony chuckled. \u201cI know, right? It\u2019s a disgrace. FRIDAY woke\nme up and told me you still weren\u2019t home, but I didn\u2019t want to phone you, if\nwe\u2019re being honest, here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t? How come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I thought something might have happened. I checked\nyour location and you weren\u2019t moving like you would have been if you were\nswinging\u2026 you were still. And I thought that\u2026 maybe you\u2019d been kidnapped or\nyou\u2019d run into trouble\u2026 or worse. I didn\u2019t want to ring you and get no answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was playing with cats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you were. Would\u2019ve been nice to know.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo\u2026 you were scared?\u201d</p><p>Tony make a face. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say <i>scared</i>, exactly,\u201d he\ninsisted, \u201cjust\u2026 slightly concerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlightly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more than that.\u201d</p><p>At this point, a flash of red swung through the open door,\nlanding perfectly behind the billionaire. Peter turned and slipped off his\nmask, a grin plastered on his face. \u201cOf <i>course</i>, dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Tony rolled his eyes and hung up the phone,\ntossing it onto the couch before moving towards his boy. \u201cC\u2019mere, you.\u201d His\narms opened and Peter crashed into them, burying his face in the man\u2019s shirt and\nclinging onto the fabric. There was a happy smile gracing his lips, which made\nTony smile. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever do anything like that again, you hear me?\u201d he\nasked, landing a well-aimed poke to the boy\u2019s side.</p><p>Peter giggled and batted his hand away, nodding. \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey\u2026 am I grounded?\u201d</p><p>Tony rose both eyebrows. \u201cDo you think you <i>should </i>be?\u201d he\nasked as he crossed his arms.</p><p>Peter felt awkwardly put on the spot, fidgeting with his\nfingers and shuffling his feet. \u201cUm, I, uh, I-I <i>guess</i>, yeah? I\u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>The billionaire had to chuckle at the kid\u2019s stuttering,\nreaching down to ruffle his hair. \u201cYou\u2019re not grounded. I know\nyou won\u2019t do it again.\u201d</p><p>Peter smiled up at the man. \u201cSorry\u2026 again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019ve said. Stop it. I\u2019m getting bored of the word.\nIt\u2019s all sorted. Now, what was that about you heading straight to bed as soon\nas you got home?\u201d</p><p>The kid\u2019s eyes widened and he stepped back. \u201cRight! Yeah.\nOkay, I\u2019ll go, then. G\u2019night, Mr Stark!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight, buddy. Also, don\u2019t you set that alarm earlier than\nhalf six, alright? I\u2019ll know if you do!\u201d He made the \u2018I\u2019m watching you!\u2019\ngesture with his fingers, causing Peter to give a cheeky salute before rushing off\nto his room.</p><p>Tony watched him go with a sparkle in his eyes. One could\ncall it pride, or adoration, or, to the more watchful people, love. It was\nclear as day that Tony Stark loved his young intern more than he\u2019d ever admit. He felt happy when Peter\nshowed him his good grades, he felt delighted when he showed him a new trick he\u2019d\nlearned with his suit, and he felt elated when he helped him with his Iron\nMan suit and managed to improve something not even he would have thought of. He\nfelt so much pride for Peter. Like he was <i>his </i>boy. <i>His</i>. He cared for him as\nwell as mentored him. <i>Hell</i>, out of all the empty rooms in the compound, the kid\u2019s one was right next to Tony\u2019s. It was no secret to anyone in the building that Peter Parker\nwas so much more than an intern to Tony Stark, especially since May had died\u2026</p><p>It was like this little beacon\nof light \u2013 of <i>hope </i>\u2013 had entered his life and turned it around in the best of\nways.</p><p>And, as the man began to make his way back to his own room,\na smile on his lips and love in his heart, he remembered two things.</p><p>The first one was that Peter had named a cat after him.</p><p>And the second, was that he had called him <i>dad.</i></p><hr><p><b>For the people that wanted to be tagged: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4EDXbV48QEjzzx3QFZcncw\" target=\"_blank\">@sourpatchthief16</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYn8SSEDj7tG9p63kBCBWwA\" target=\"_blank\">@butterflyphangirl15</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNgQV7vB0bNDeRIC0Q3ammw\" target=\"_blank\">@principessadislytherin</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mg_VtYcP1DhD5eVL5beALZw\" target=\"_blank\">@gold165</a></b></p>",

The cat in his lap meowed and nudged\nhis side in an effortless attempt to get the kid&rsquo;s hand back on her belly.\nPeter, however, was not focusing entirely on the cat for once in his short\nlife. He checked the time and his mouth dropped open the tiniest bit as &rsquo;12:47&rsquo;\nblinked back at him. He stared at it for a while until the white light (that he\ncould have <i>sworn </i>was mocking him) became too much for his eyes.</p><p>He tried all he could to get Karen to hang up, even going so\nfar as to quickly try and get out of the suit before his mentor answered.\nNevertheless, as Parker luck so <i>loved </i>to follow him around everywhere, the\nbeeping he had wanted so badly to stop but now was practically <i>begging</i> to keep going went silent. With\na hint of hope, Peter ventured to ask the question that would inevitably tell\nhim if he was grounded or not. &ldquo;Um&hellip; Karen?&rdquo; There was a slight break in his\nvoice, and his hands were growing increasingly hot and sweaty. Deep down, he\nknew his AI hadn&rsquo;t ended the call, but he&rsquo;d had to at least try.</p><p>&ldquo;This is Mr Stark.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter could tell the man wasn&rsquo;t exactly&hellip; <i>pleased </i>with him.\nHis voice had adopted an almost firm tone, something he rarely ever used with\nhim. He gulped. &ldquo;Uh, y-yes. I know. Hi, Mr Stark, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, hi. Wanna tell me why you&rsquo;re&hellip; hm, let&rsquo;s see. Two.\nHours. <i>Late</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter didn&rsquo;t even notice the cats moving off him one by one,\ndistaste in their steps as they pranced off; he was way too focused on trying\nto calm his breathing and pin all his attention on the man&rsquo;s voice. It wasn&rsquo;t that he was\n<i>scared </i>of the man, per se, he just&hellip; <i>well</i>. It was easier to handle when he was\nin a good mood, as you&rsquo;d probably expect.</p><p>Apparently, he was thinking too much to figure out an\nanswer, because Tony did something. He cleared his throat.</p><p>Peter would have screamed if he hadn&rsquo;t clapped his hand over\nhis mouth. </p><p>&ldquo;Peter, you better give me an answer, &lsquo;cause I&rsquo;m not happy\nright now.&rdquo;</p><p>The kid felt his heart swell with something he hadn&rsquo;t felt\nsince Tony took the suit from him. Shame. Like he had let the only man he cared\nabout &ndash; the only man he had left &ndash; down. That he&rsquo;d broken Tony&rsquo;s trust and he&rsquo;d never\nbe allowed back at the compound and he would hate him forever and he&rsquo;d take\nback what he said about getting him into MIT and he&rsquo;d never let him wear the Spider-Man suit again and he&rsquo;d never give it back and he&rsquo;d tell all the cats in the world never to\ngo near him again and-</p><p>&ldquo;Kid, stop thinking what you&rsquo;re thinking, okay?&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s\nvoice broke though his thoughts, voice sounding a little softer yet that\nsternness was still there. &ldquo;You know it&rsquo;s not gonna happen, you know we&rsquo;re\ngonna sort this out, and you know nothing&rsquo;s gonna change. D&rsquo;you hear me?&rdquo; It\nnever ceased to amaze Peter how much Tony knew him. Nobody had <i>ever </i>been able\nto read him that well (save for maybe Ned) when they were standing right in\n<i>front </i>of him, never mind on the other end of a <i>phone</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;I-I guess&hellip;&rdquo; So, he&rsquo;d found his voice. Probably not as\nfortunate as you&rsquo;d think.</p><p>The kid could imagine the billionaire&rsquo;s eyebrows shooting up\nto his hairline and his face adopting that &lsquo;are you serious?&rsquo; look with the\nnext words he spoke. &ldquo;You <i>guess</i>? Kid, I love you, okay? That enough proof for\nyou that everything&rsquo;s gonna be fine?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter nodded, though Tony couldn&rsquo;t see him, and gulped yet\nagain. &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good. Right, then. I expect you&rsquo;re heading home right now?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter had never swung into motion so fast. His eyes widened\nand a string of web zoomed out of his shooter simultaneously and so fast he\ncould feel his blood rushing through his body. &ldquo;Uh, yeah! Yeah, of course, Mr\nStark! En compound route- I mean, en route to&hellip; the compound&hellip; uh.&rdquo; He faltered. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re coming back?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. Yes. Exactly that.&rdquo; Why hadn&rsquo;t he just said he was on\nhis way to begin with?</p><p>&ldquo;Okay. So let&rsquo;s start talking.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Why?</i> &ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re late, Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y-yes. Yes, I am, and I&rsquo;m so sorry, Mr Stark, I swear-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, okay. Why are you late?&rdquo;</p><p>The kid gasped slightly as he almost missed catching the end\nof his web, grappling with it for a moment and cursing his nerves for making\nhim slip. He <i>never </i>slipped. &ldquo;You alright, Pete?&rdquo;</p><p><i>Pete.</i></p><p>Somehow, that made him feel better already.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, just&hellip; slipped.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay. Wanna tell me, then?&rdquo;</p><p><i>&lsquo;Yeah, Mr Stark, I was playing with a bunch of cats like the five-year old I am.&rsquo;</i>&nbsp;&ldquo;I\ngot side-tracked.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Side-tracked, hey?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There, uh- well. There were some, you know&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>He heard Tony sigh on the other end and bit his lip, still\nswinging from building to building and not really bothering to check whether\npeople were watching him or not. &ldquo;Pete,&rdquo; came the man&rsquo;s voice, &ldquo;just tell me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, well, uh, there, um&hellip; uh. Oh <i>my</i>- okay. There were\ncats, Mr Stark, okay? There were cute little cats everywhere and Karen told me\nI should head home and so I did but then I <i>had </i>to stop and stroke this little\nkitty &ndash; I named him Tony, by the way&nbsp;&ndash;\n\n and then, oh my God, Mr Stark, you\nshould&rsquo;ve <i>seen </i>them! All these cats came out of nowhere and I really tried,\nsir, but I just couldn&rsquo;t leave, you know? I mean, Bruce was on my lap, and Wolf\nwas climbing up my back, and you- I mean, Tony was licking my hand, and Tasha\njust wouldn&rsquo;t stop <i>meowing </i>at me! They were just&hellip; they were so <i>cute</i>, Mr Stark.\nPlease don&rsquo;t be mad.&rdquo; His voice went quiet at the end, as if he were about to\ncry (from the utter adorableness of the kittens or from the possible\ndisappointment his mentor may currently be feeling, he had no clue whatsoever)\nand both ends of the line went silent.</p><p>Tony didn&rsquo;t quite know what to say. He&rsquo;d expected the\nculprit to be cats, if he were being honest &ndash; it definitely wouldn&rsquo;t be the\nfirst time those little creatures stopped him on the street when they were\nwalking together and the billionaire would keep moving and talking until he\nrealized the kid had stopped several blocks back &ndash; but he had <i>not\n</i>expected that outburst.</p><p>On thing for sure, he was getting that kid a damn kitten.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, Pete, calm down. Listen, I&rsquo;m not- I&rsquo;m not mad.\nDon&rsquo;t think I am.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You <i>seemed </i>it&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was a tad frustrated that you&rsquo;re two hours late home, but\nthat&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter grimaced at the reminder. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m <i>really </i>sorry,&rdquo; he\napologised, &ldquo;but I promise I&rsquo;ll go to bed as soon as I get home, and I&rsquo;ll cut\nrevision time back a little in the morning so I can sleep for longer, and I <i>swear </i>I\nwon&rsquo;t be tired-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Kid, honestly, I don&rsquo;t care about your bedtime right now.&rdquo;</p><p>Unexpected. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. What I <i>care </i>about is the fact that anything could have\nhappened to you in those two hours. I <i>mean </i>it, Peter, <i>any</i>thing. I tell you to\ncome home at eleven because I have a set time I know you&rsquo;ll be back. Of course,\nI want you well rested for your exams, but I also&hellip; I guess&hellip;&rdquo; Now <i>he </i>was\nstumbling on his words, god<i>dammit</i>. <i>He </i>wasn&rsquo;t the one being reprimanded, here! He\nsighed, putting his head in his hands from where he was sat on a seat by the\ndoor to the compound, waiting for the kid to get back. &ldquo;The world&rsquo;s a dangerous\nplace, buddy. Seriously. I&rsquo;m not just saying that. There are- there are people\nout there. <i>Bad </i>people that will do anything to get their hands on Spider-Man. I\njust need to know you&rsquo;re safe, okay? If you&rsquo;re not home by eleven, then I know\nsomething may be wrong, and I can look into it. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m so strict about\nthese rules. I can&rsquo;t have you getting hurt; on my watch, on <i>anybody&rsquo;s </i>watch.\nIt&rsquo;s <i>not </i>happening.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter bit his lip harder, feeling guilt swell inside his\nstomach. He looked up, tears shining in his eyes, and saw the compound in the\ndistance. He sniffed. &ldquo;I understand, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know you do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t do it again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know you won&rsquo;t.&rdquo; And he did. He knew it. He could tell\nthe kid was probably a little overwhelmed at the moment by what he&rsquo;d said, and\nwas most likely also feeling slightly upset by his words. Peter wasn&rsquo;t one to\nhave to be told off for something, whether it be by himself, someone else in the compound, or one of his\nteachers. He was a good boy. And this changed absolutely <i>nothing</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Mr Stark? Why didn&rsquo;t you call me <i>earlier </i>and ask where\nI was?&rdquo;</p><p>This was where Tony&rsquo;s face scrunched up a little in what\ncould only be described as embarrassment. He coughed slightly. &ldquo;Uh, definitely didn&rsquo;t fall asleep.\nNope. Not me.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter laughed, and the carefree sound brought joy back to\nthe billionaire&rsquo;s heart as he stood and walked closer to the door, seeing the\nkid a little further away. &ldquo;The great Mr Stark fell asleep? Wow. Whatever will\nbecome of you?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony chuckled. &ldquo;I know, right? It&rsquo;s a disgrace. FRIDAY woke\nme up and told me you still weren&rsquo;t home, but I didn&rsquo;t want to phone you, if\nwe&rsquo;re being honest, here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t? How come?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because I thought something might have happened. I checked\nyour location and you weren&rsquo;t moving like you would have been if you were\nswinging&hellip; you were still. And I thought that&hellip; maybe you&rsquo;d been kidnapped or\nyou&rsquo;d run into trouble&hellip; or worse. I didn&rsquo;t want to ring you and get no answer.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was playing with cats.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, you were. Would&rsquo;ve been nice to know.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;So&hellip; you were scared?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony make a face. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say <i>scared</i>, exactly,&rdquo; he\ninsisted, &ldquo;just&hellip; slightly concerned.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Slightly.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No more than that.&rdquo;</p><p>At this point, a flash of red swung through the open door,\nlanding perfectly behind the billionaire. Peter turned and slipped off his\nmask, a grin plastered on his face. &ldquo;Of <i>course</i>, dad.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; Tony rolled his eyes and hung up the phone,\ntossing it onto the couch before moving towards his boy. &ldquo;C&rsquo;mere, you.&rdquo; His\narms opened and Peter crashed into them, burying his face in the man&rsquo;s shirt and\nclinging onto the fabric. There was a happy smile gracing his lips, which made\nTony smile. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you ever do anything like that again, you hear me?&rdquo; he\nasked, landing a well-aimed poke to the boy&rsquo;s side.</p><p>Peter giggled and batted his hand away, nodding. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey&hellip; am I grounded?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony rose both eyebrows. &ldquo;Do you think you <i>should </i>be?&rdquo; he\nasked as he crossed his arms.</p><p>Peter felt awkwardly put on the spot, fidgeting with his\nfingers and shuffling his feet. &ldquo;Um, I, uh, I-I <i>guess</i>, yeah? I&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p><p>The billionaire had to chuckle at the kid&rsquo;s stuttering,\nreaching down to ruffle his hair. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not grounded. I know\nyou won&rsquo;t do it again.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter smiled up at the man. &ldquo;Sorry&hellip; again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, you&rsquo;ve said. Stop it. I&rsquo;m getting bored of the word.\nIt&rsquo;s all sorted. Now, what was that about you heading straight to bed as soon\nas you got home?&rdquo;</p><p>The kid&rsquo;s eyes widened and he stepped back. &ldquo;Right! Yeah.\nOkay, I&rsquo;ll go, then. G&rsquo;night, Mr Stark!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Night, buddy. Also, don&rsquo;t you set that alarm earlier than\nhalf six, alright? I&rsquo;ll know if you do!&rdquo; He made the &lsquo;I&rsquo;m watching you!&rsquo;\ngesture with his fingers, causing Peter to give a cheeky salute before rushing off\nto his room.</p><p>Tony watched him go with a sparkle in his eyes. One could\ncall it pride, or adoration, or, to the more watchful people, love. It was\nclear as day that Tony Stark loved his young intern more than he&rsquo;d ever admit. He felt happy when Peter\nshowed him his good grades, he felt delighted when he showed him a new trick he&rsquo;d\nlearned with his suit, and he felt elated when he helped him with his Iron\nMan suit and managed to improve something not even he would have thought of. He\nfelt so much pride for Peter. Like he was <i>his </i>boy. <i>His</i>. He cared for him as\nwell as mentored him. <i>Hell</i>, out of all the empty rooms in the compound, the kid&rsquo;s one was right next to Tony&rsquo;s. It was no secret to anyone in the building that Peter Parker\nwas so much more than an intern to Tony Stark, especially since May had died&hellip;</p><p>It was like this little beacon\nof light &ndash; of <i>hope </i>&ndash; had entered his life and turned it around in the best of\nways.</p><p>And, as the man began to make his way back to his own room,\na smile on his lips and love in his heart, he remembered two things.</p><p>The first one was that Peter had named a cat after him.</p><p>And the second, was that he had called him <i>dad.</i></p><hr /><p><b>For the people that wanted to be tagged: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4EDXbV48QEjzzx3QFZcncw\" target=\"_blank\">@sourpatchthief16</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYn8SSEDj7tG9p63kBCBWwA\" target=\"_blank\">@butterflyphangirl15</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNgQV7vB0bNDeRIC0Q3ammw\" target=\"_blank\">@principessadislytherin</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mg_VtYcP1DhD5eVL5beALZw\" target=\"_blank\">@gold165</a></b></p>",
