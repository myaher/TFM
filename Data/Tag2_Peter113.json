        "body": "<h2><b>Irondad || Angst &amp; Comfort || WC: 3.6k</b></h2><p>Peter was patrolling 14th Street when he heard a loud BANG, followed by the unmistakable tire squeal of a car veering off the road.<br/></p><p>He immediately swung into action, ricocheting off and around buildings to where he heard the noise.</p><p>Peter had dealt with car crashes before. An oblivious new young driver ran a stop sign, or someone checked their phone while behind the wheel, and the car swerved to the next lane over.</p><p>The injuries were generally the same - minor cuts or bruises, or, on the more severe end of the spectrum, a concussion. On any other day, Peter would arrive at the scene, help people out of the cars, wait for the authorities to arrive, and swing off again.</p><p>This was not any other day.</p><!-- more --><p>After swinging around the final corner, Peter almost fell when he saw the scene before him.</p><p>One of the vehicles, a shiny new sports car, lay on its side as smoke billowed from the hood. A tire was rolling lazily away from the vehicle as the surrounding cars had formed a ring-like space around it, all swerving to avoid the catastrophe.</p><p>But that wasn\u2019t what concerned Peter the most.</p><p>In front of the overturned car, having plowed into the brick wall of a shoe store, was a minivan, the bumper sticker of a mother, father, and three baby girls on the back window.</p><p>The minivan had hit the wall hard enough to leave a dent, dust beginning to rise from the settling brick. The entire right side of the vehicle was pressed against the wall, parts of it dented and crumpled from the pure force of the impact.</p><p>Peter tried to shake off the hollow feeling of dread in his stomach as he shook his head and swung into action.</p><p>He went first for the minivan, the three smiling stick figures of children seeming to taunt Peter as he brought himself down in the middle of the street, quickly running the final steps to the red van.</p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d Peter jumped at the sudden reminder of Karen. \u201cDo you require my assistance?\u201d</p><p>Peter found his head spinning. Why - why couldn\u2019t he focus? He was <i>Spiderman</i>. He had rescued people from car crashes before. He could do this.</p><p>\u201cY-yeah, Karen.\u201d He hated how young his voice shouted.</p><p>\u201cBefore we begin, there is gasoline dripping from the vehicle behind you. It may light soon.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s breath quickened. \u201cLet\u2019s make this fast, then.\u201d He reassessed the vehicle in front of him, fighting to keep his breathing steady. \u201cWhere\u2019s my best point of entry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDriver\u2019s side door is the only one not tainted by rubble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Karen.\u201d</p><p>Peter reached out a shaking hand <i>(why was it shaking?)</i> and gripped the handle, easily pulling it open with his extra strength. Spoke billowed out but his mask stopped him from squinting against it. And when it cleared\u2026.</p><p>He expected crying.</p><p>Screaming.</p><p>Pleads for help.</p><p>He didn\u2019t expect <i>silence</i>.</p><p>Peter\u2019s heart beat faster, blocking out the noises of the oncoming sirens. <i>Were they even still there? Was help ever coming?</i></p><p>\u201cPeter, a small fire has started in the engine of the vehicle behind you.\u201d Karen\u2019s soft voice interrupted his thoughts, but at the moment even the gentle AI couldn\u2019t snap him out of his predicament. Peter ignored her and instead asked his own question, focusing on the slumped-over man behind the wheel, not being able to take his eyes off where the man\u2019s eyes were - were rolled back in his-</p><p>\u201cKaren, read his vitals.\u201d</p><p>His heart pounded in his throat as he assessed the pale face and the blood dripping down the various wounds of the man before him. The airbag was deployed but it was tinted - it was tinted <i>red</i>-</p><p>\u201cDead. No vitals.\u201d</p><p>Peter felt like he was going to throw up.</p><p>\u201cPeter, the fire is spreading dangerously close to the gasoline-\u201d</p><p>\u201cRead the woman\u2019s vitals,\u201d he ignored her, finding the mother in the passenger seat.</p><p>His limbs felt like lead, and he wasn\u2019t sure how long he stood there, waiting for Karen\u2019s response.</p><p>Could\u2019ve been days.</p><p>Could\u2019ve been mere seconds.</p><p>It didn\u2019t change her answer.</p><p>\u201cDead. No vitals.\u201d</p><p>Peter shook his head.</p><p>Spiderman.</p><p><i>He was Spiderman.</i></p><p>Focus.</p><p>\u201cPeter, the flame-\u201d</p><p>\u201cKaren,\u201d he choked out. He had to save them. He was Spiderman; he <i>had </i>to save them.</p><p>\u201cCheck for heat signatures in the back.\u201d</p><p>Maybe the stickers were left on the van from the last owner. Maybe there weren\u2019t any kids <i>in </i>the van-</p><p>\u201cThree heat signatures detected.\u201d</p><p>Peter fought to move, to see them, to open the door to the back seat and help the children out - children. There were <i>children </i>back there.</p><p>But all he could do was gasp out, \u201cRead vitals.\u201d</p><p>Everything went quiet.</p><p>Still.</p><p>Silent.</p><p>The world itself seemed to stop spinning as Peter awaited the response.</p><p>\u201cAll dead. No vitals.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s brain shut down.</p><p>Then, it went into hyperdrive.</p><p>Peter\u2019s breath quickened as he backed away - <i>stumbled </i>away from the car, staggering as he clutched a hand to his chest. He couldn\u2019t breathe, <i>couldn\u2019t breathe-</i></p><p>\u201cPeter, you have to leave <i>now</i>. The car is about to explode.\u201d</p><p>Peter just shook his head and fell to his knees as his ears altered between hearing everything, and hearing nothing.</p><p>He was Spiderman. He should have the strength to get up and save himself.</p><p><i>But was it worth it, if everyone else was dead?</i></p><p>Suddenly, a force hit Peter from behind, and he went flying.</p><ul><li>\u2022 \u2022</li>\n</ul><p>\u201cPeter? Pete! You gotta get up, bud.\u201d A shiver of dread raced up Tony\u2019s spine as he watched the boy lying limp on the pavement, the fire behind him being put out by firemen.</p><p>He had been notified as soon as Peter went unconscious by Karen. Already, he was planning 20 different changes he could make to the suit to better protect Peter. To notify Tony <i>before </i>his kid went unconscious.</p><p>But that didn\u2019t matter now. All that did was that Peter was <i>still </i>unresponsive.</p><p>As soon as Tony was notified of Peter\u2019s condition, he raced to suit up and fly to his location, only keeping the suit on once he landed long enough to hear F.R.I.D.A.Y. tell him Peter was alive and in stable condition, before disengaging it and racing, as nothing more than Tony Stark, to the kid\u2019s side. Still, Tony couldn\u2019t stop the anxious thoughts racing through his mind, mainly revolving around the suit.</p><p>Why didn\u2019t Karen warn Peter when he was in danger? What had Tony done wrong with the programming of the suit?</p><p>How had he failed his kid so terribly?</p><p>The thoughts were quickly erased from his mind when a groan was emitted from the body on the floor.</p><p>\u201cPeter? You with me?\u201d</p><p>The boy\u2019s eyes fluttered open, Tony removing his mask just enough to see his face, but using Tony\u2019s own body to shield him from the crowd forming not far from the two. Tony knew he had to get the kid out of there. Iron Man and Spiderman crouched beside a still-smoking car crash? The news reports would be brutal.</p><p>Still, he wanted to be absolutely positive Peter was okay before moving him.</p><p>\u201cMis\u2019r S\u2019ark,\u201d Peter mumbled groggily, mouth full of cotton. Tony sighed as he momentarily rested back on his heels. He ran a hand over his forehead, stopping at the bridge of his nose as his heartbeat slowed significantly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re giving my gray hairs, kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018M sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize.\u201d</p><p>Tony gently readjusted the kid\u2019s mask so it covered his face once more, promising himself to take it off as soon as the cameras people had begin to point their way were out of sight. His chest panged when Peter\u2019s large brown eyes left his sight, and he desperately wanted to keep the mask off and just keep looking into them to assure himself that <i>Peter was okay</i>, but he knew the last thing the kid would want was others knowing his identity.</p><p>So he kept the mask on.</p><p>Tony called his suit back to him as soon as he had convinced himself Peter was alright. \u201cCome on kid, let\u2019s go back to the tower. Can you stand?\u201d</p><p>He pushed himself to his feet, waiting for the kid to join him, but he found himself waiting a second too long. A glance to where Peter remained on the floor explained why.</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes looked desperate, lost, as they drifted over the scene before him. The fire, the overturned cars-</p><p>Tony himself had to choke back a sob.</p><p>The bodies in the front seats.</p><p>And the three in the back.</p><p>\u201cKid, don\u2019t look.\u201d His voice came out weak, quivering, because it was too little, too late. Peter had already seen the damage, and no matter what Tony did, he could never remove those horrors from his kid\u2019s mind.</p><p>Peter didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d Tony urged his voice to come out stronger, more in control, as his two metal-clad hands gripped Peter\u2019s shoulders and forced them away from the wreckage. Peter fought him at first, but then allowed himself to be turned.</p><p>Allowed Tony to see the raw <i>emotion </i>on his face.</p><p>His eyes were red with unshed tears, but they weren\u2019t sad. No, they were <i>lost</i>. Hopeless. Guilt-ridden. Staring somewhere beyond Tony. Somewhere <i>through </i>him.</p><p>Like he wasn\u2019t even there.</p><p>Tony gripped his shoulder a bit tighter, essentially holding the kid up.</p><p>\u201cPete. Hey, look at me.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, hesitantly, the kid\u2019s eyes lolled their way up to find Tony\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cNot your fault.\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded slowly, as if he was in a trance. Tony knew he didn\u2019t actually agree. He wouldn\u2019t for a long while, maybe even ever - Tony understood better than most.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we go back to the tower?\u201d he murmured gently, offering his arms to Peter and helping him to his feet.</p><p>Tony allowed the kid to curl into his arms as they lifted into the sky, leaving the wreckage behind.</p><ul><li>\u2022 \u2022</li>\n</ul><p>When they touched down at the tower, it took Peter longer than expected to detangle himself from his mentor\u2019s iron-clad arms. He moved slow, sluggish, and Tony\u2019s heart ached as he watched his kid trudge into the tower.</p><p>Tony followed not too far behind, thinking back to his own mistakes, all the times he\u2019d let civilians die. How afterwards he\u2019s had trouble eating, sleeping. The first time he lost a civilian, shot in a shootout Tony was trying to prevent, he considered hanging up the suit altogether.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t.</p><p>And he would make sure Peter wouldn\u2019t, either.</p><p>Take a seat on the couch, Pete,\u201d he spoke softly when he saw Peter standing in the middle of the foyer, looking lost. \u201cYou can even turn on one of those Star Wars movies, if you like. I\u2019ll actually allow you to do it. Take advantage.\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded slowly, avoiding eye contact, as he slowly stumbled to the couch and collapsed, gingerly reaching for the remote and beginning to flip through the channels.</p><p>Tony sighed, sending one last look to his kid before jogging up the stairs and returning not two minutes later with a pile of blankets. He didn\u2019t hesitate to recline on the couch beside his kid and wrap him in the fluffiest one, knowing Peter wouldn\u2019t be opposed to the sudden contact.</p><p>But Tony wondered if he even noticed it at all.</p><p>His shoulders remained stiff, eyes focused on what was playing on the t.v., the news-</p><p>The news? But Peter <i>hated </i>the news. All the politics and arguments didn\u2019t sit right with him.</p><p>He was about to speak up when he heard an intake of breath beside him followed by a soft voice.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t hate me.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s breath caught in his throat.</p><p>Peter was shaking where he was huddled on the couch, his eyes not moving from where his knees were tucked to his chest, refusing to look up.</p><p>Tony watched his kid in disbelief, not understanding how Peter could say something so - so <i>stupid</i>. How the <i>heck</i> could Peter ever believe Tony would hate him? That was his <i>kid</i>. Peter could do anything and Tony would support him - even <i>murder</i>. Heck, Tony would help him hide the body.</p><p>With a cringe, Tony realized he had waited too long to answer as Peter\u2019s shuddering grew more violent.</p><p>Tony rested a hand on his shoulder. Peter lightly flinched, but Tony decided not to take it personally when the kid leaned into his touch shortly after.</p><p>\u201cPeter, look at me.\u201d</p><p>Peter shook his head.</p><p>Tony gripped his shoulder tighter and forced the kid around to look at him. Tony <i>hated </i>how harsh he was being, but he needed the kid to understand.</p><p>He gently placed two fingers under Peter\u2019s chin and lifted his face until Peter\u2019s large, watering brown eyes met Tony\u2019s own.</p><p>\u201cListen to me.\u201d There was more passion in his voice than he had expected, but he wasn\u2019t surprised. Tony would <i>kill </i>for Peter.</p><p>\u201cI will never, <i>ever</i>, hate you, you hear me? No matter what happens, I know the real you. I know you would never do anything to warrant my-\u201d Tony had trouble even getting the word out. \u201c-my <i>hatred</i>!\u201d</p><p>Peter still looked unsure as he fidgeted him hands in his lap, shifting uncomfortably as his eyes searched the room, chin held tightly in Tony\u2019s grasp.</p><p>\u201cBut you - you have to k-kick me out of the Av-Avengers now.\u201d</p><p>A look of confusion crossed Tony\u2019s features as he fought to not let his fingers clench in anger at how little Peter placed his self-worth.</p><p>He forced his voice to calm as his eyes softened.</p><p>\u201cAnd why would I do that?\u201d</p><p>Peter leaned back to remove his chin from Tony\u2019s grip. Tony complied, letting his hand fall to his lap as Peter looked down, ashamed, his voice deathly quiet.</p><p>\u201cI - I killed-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Tony cut him off with newfound ferocity in his voice, making Peter wince. Screw gentle. Peter needed to understand. Tony <i>desperately</i> needed Peter to understand. \u201cYou did <i>not </i>kill them. Did you crash the car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no, but-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you pour out the gasoline?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>No</i>-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you set the fire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were <i>kids</i>, Tony!\u201d</p><p>Tony froze at the sudden outburst, Peter\u2019s eyes widening at the use of the name.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Peter rushed to gasp out, but Tony just held up a finger.</p><p>\u201cNo apologizing, kid.\u201d</p><p>Peter paused a moment before letting out a light chuckle, catching the both of them off guard.</p><p>\u201cThat word felt really weird coming out of my mouth.\u201d</p><p>Tony raised his eyebrows before falling into a small fit of laughter himself.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m gonna stick with Mr. Stark.\u201d Tony nodded, appreciating the opportunity for humour, the chance to laugh with his kid again.</p><p>But the dark, haunted look that returned to cloud Peter\u2019s sullen eyes reminded Tony of the underlying threat still at hand.</p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d Tony called the kid\u2019s attention back to him. \u201cJust answer this for me. What more could you have done to save them?\u201d</p><p>Peter hesitated for a moment, looking lost; then-</p><p>\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t taken so long to get my stuff out of my locker after school, maybe I would\u2019ve been on that corner before it happened. I could\u2019ve stopped it.\u201d</p><p>Tony watched his kid with pity. This was the worst part of any mission - the \u201cwhat-ifs\u201d. What if I had moved a bit faster? What if I had turned left rather than right?</p><p>But Tony had enough experience to know that there would always be \u201cwhat-ifs\u201d. Things would always go wrong. It was how you dealt with it that mattered.</p><p>\u201cI need you to listen to me, kid.\u201d Peter looked up at Tony with wide, watering eyes, giving him a look that made Tony want to lock the doors and separate them from the outside world. Just the two of them, safe and protected forever.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t. He couldn\u2019t hide himself, and neither could Peter. They had to deal with this, to fight it. Tony would make sure Peter knew he was loved. He was <i>appreciated</i>. That never in a million years would he be <i>hated</i>.</p><p>\u201cThis was not your fault. No interrupting.\u201d Tony held up a finger when Peter opened his mouth, and he closed it again dejectedly. \u201cYou can\u2019t save everyone, kid, no matter how hard you try. And it\u2019s gonna suck. After an event like this, you\u2019re gonna want to hang up your suit. Stop fighting.\u201d Peter looked down at his lap, ashamed, and Tony guessed he had hit the nail on the head.</p><p>\u201cBut you can\u2019t. This happens to everyone, kid. Happened to me.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes flashed up in shock, and Tony chuckled humorlessly at the response.</p><p>\u201cYeah, kid, even Iron Man can\u2019t save everyone. Goodness knows I tried.\u201d</p><p>It was quiet for a minute, until Peter whispered a quiet, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Tony focused straight ahead, thinking back to the one memory that would haunt him every time he put on the suit. It had been a while ago, but he still hadn\u2019t quite forgiven himself yet. Ironic, then, that he was teaching Peter to move on. Tony just hoped that Peter could be better than he himself ever was.</p><p>\u201cIt was one of my first times wearing the suit,\u201d Tony started, staring somewhere into the distance. Peter waited quietly.</p><p>\u201cI was just flying over the city, testing out my thrusters, when I heard screaming. It was a man, with a gun, in the middle of an intersection. So I touched down and raised my thruster-\u201d</p><p>Peter clutched a hand to his mouth with a gasp. Tony looked up suddenly, realizing what it must\u2019ve sounded like.</p><p>\u201cNo, kid, geez, no, I didn\u2019t shoot him.\u201d Peter seemed to relax, but Tony inwardly cursed himself. Tony was finally proving to be the terrible monster Peter had always been too innocent to notice.</p><p>\u201cBut that was part of the problem. See, I waited too long, said some smart-ass comment-\u201d Tony sighed as he ran a hand down his face to pinch the bridge of his nose. The memory still haunted him, the look on the girl\u2019s face clear as day.</p><p>\u201cHe aimed the gun and shot it and it - it hit-\u201d</p><p>Tony cut himself off, not being able to continue. The memories were just too strong.</p><p>Tony was started by Peter moving on the couch to sit closer to his mentor, his small frame providing an insurmountable amount of comfort to the mechanic as Tony wrapped his arm around his kid and held him close.</p><p>\u201cIt was a young girl,\u201d Tony found the strength to continue, though he knew that when he finished, Peter would never look at him the same way. He guessed it was for the best, though - Tony needed to put as much distance between the two of them as possible. As much as he loved the kid, If he continued to hang around Tony, he would get hurt, or worse. The story just helped prove that.</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t have been older than five. And you want to hear what she said to bring the gunman\u2019s attention to her?\u201d</p><p>Tony blinked the tears from his eyes as the words, the voice, replayed themselves in his mind, clear as day. They were the sounds that had haunted him for the longest time, and would continue to until - well, Tony didn\u2019t know how long it would be until he forgot. Maybe never. And honestly, he didn\u2019t even know if he <i>wanted </i>to forget. He was responsible for that girl\u2019s death. He had no right to a clear conscience.</p><p>\u201cShe said, \u2018Look, mom, it\u2019s Iron Man. He\u2019ll save us.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Tony felt Peter tense in his side but tried to cherish the feeling of his kid leaning against him, realizing it might be the last time Peter would ever want to be close to him.</p><p><i>Seems about right</i>, he thought as he hastily wiped away a tear he hadn\u2019t even realized had fallen. <i>Now Peter realizes what a monster I am. I\u2019m not a hero, I\u2019m-</i></p><p>Suddenly, Peter was wrapping his arms around his mentor, resting his chin on his shoulder as Tony looked down at him in surprise.</p><p>\u201cKid, what-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot your fault.\u201d</p><p>Tony stared down at the matted curls of his kid incredulously. Why was Peter hugging him? He had killed a five-year-old-</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t kill her.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Geez</i>, kid, can you read minds or something?\u201d Tony gasped, but Peter just held him tighter. Tony rested a light hand on Peter\u2019s head, fingers threading through his soft curls.</p><p>\u201cDid you aim the gun at her?\u201d</p><p>Tony chuckled at the irony and couldn\u2019t held smiling at how <i>selfless </i>the kid was.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you pull the trigger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Did </i>you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Peter sat back up like that decided it.</p><p>\u201cThen you didn\u2019t kill her.\u201d</p><p>Tony sighed quietly as he leaned back into the couch cushions.</p><p>\u201cStill hurts.\u201d</p><p>Peter mirrored his position.</p><p>\u201cSo this feeling will never go away, then?\u201d</p><p>Tony turned his gaze to the kid and saw his brown eyes looking back sadly. Tony shook his head slightly.</p><p>\u201cNo, but you can try to move on.\u201d He spoke stronger, as if he really believed in what he was saying. For Peter\u2019s sake, at least. \u201cTry to continue saving people. Being a hero isn\u2019t the mistakes you didn\u2019t make; it\u2019s coming back from the ones you did.\u201d</p><p>Peter smiled then, but Tony could still see the brokenness behind it. He figured he would for a while. He would help him, though. He would save Peter, help him get back on his feet.</p><p>And he would never leave him. No, Peter was his kid.</p><p>Maybe that was selfish. Maybe Tony\u2019s self-destructive tendencies would rub off on the kid - maybe something worse would. Tony didn\u2019t care.</p><p>Peter was his kid, and Tony would never leave him.</p>",

On any other day, Peter would arrive at the scene, help people out of the cars, wait for the authorities to arrive, and swing off again.</p><p>This was not any other day.</p>[[MORE]]<p>After swinging around the final corner, Peter almost fell when he saw the scene before him.</p><p>One of the vehicles, a shiny new sports car, lay on its side as smoke billowed from the hood. A tire was rolling lazily away from the vehicle as the surrounding cars had formed a ring-like space around it, all swerving to avoid the catastrophe.</p><p>But that wasn\u2019t what concerned Peter the most.</p><p>In front of the overturned car, having plowed into the brick wall of a shoe store, was a minivan, the bumper sticker of a mother, father, and three baby girls on the back window.</p><p>The minivan had hit the wall hard enough to leave a dent, dust beginning to rise from the settling brick. The entire right side of the vehicle was pressed against the wall, parts of it dented and crumpled from the pure force of the impact.</p><p>Peter tried to shake off the hollow feeling of dread in his stomach as he shook his head and swung into action.</p><p>He went first for the minivan, the three smiling stick figures of children seeming to taunt Peter as he brought himself down in the middle of the street, quickly running the final steps to the red van.</p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d Peter jumped at the sudden reminder of Karen. \u201cDo you require my assistance?\u201d</p><p>Peter found his head spinning. Why - why couldn\u2019t he focus? He was <i>Spiderman</i>. He had rescued people from car crashes before. He could do this.</p><p>\u201cY-yeah, Karen.\u201d He hated how young his voice shouted.</p><p>\u201cBefore we begin, there is gasoline dripping from the vehicle behind you. It may light soon.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s breath quickened. \u201cLet\u2019s make this fast, then.\u201d He reassessed the vehicle in front of him, fighting to keep his breathing steady. \u201cWhere\u2019s my best point of entry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDriver\u2019s side door is the only one not tainted by rubble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Karen.\u201d</p><p>Peter reached out a shaking hand <i>(why was it shaking?)</i> and gripped the handle, easily pulling it open with his extra strength. Spoke billowed out but his mask stopped him from squinting against it. And when it cleared\u2026.</p><p>He expected crying.</p><p>Screaming.</p><p>Pleads for help.</p><p>He didn\u2019t expect <i>silence</i>.</p><p>Peter\u2019s heart beat faster, blocking out the noises of the oncoming sirens. <i>Were they even still there? Was help ever coming?</i></p><p>\u201cPeter, a small fire has started in the engine of the vehicle behind you.\u201d Karen\u2019s soft voice interrupted his thoughts, but at the moment even the gentle AI couldn\u2019t snap him out of his predicament. Peter ignored her and instead asked his own question, focusing on the slumped-over man behind the wheel, not being able to take his eyes off where the man\u2019s eyes were - were rolled back in his-</p><p>\u201cKaren, read his vitals.\u201d</p><p>His heart pounded in his throat as he assessed the pale face and the blood dripping down the various wounds of the man before him. The airbag was deployed but it was tinted - it was tinted <i>red</i>-</p><p>\u201cDead. No vitals.\u201d</p><p>Peter felt like he was going to throw up.</p><p>\u201cPeter, the fire is spreading dangerously close to the gasoline-\u201d</p><p>\u201cRead the woman\u2019s vitals,\u201d he ignored her, finding the mother in the passenger seat.</p><p>His limbs felt like lead, and he wasn\u2019t sure how long he stood there, waiting for Karen\u2019s response.</p><p>Could\u2019ve been days.</p><p>Could\u2019ve been mere seconds.</p><p>It didn\u2019t change her answer.</p><p>\u201cDead. No vitals.\u201d</p><p>Peter shook his head.</p><p>Spiderman.</p><p><i>He was Spiderman.</i></p><p>Focus.</p><p>\u201cPeter, the flame-\u201d</p><p>\u201cKaren,\u201d he choked out. He had to save them. He was Spiderman; he <i>had </i>to save them.</p><p>\u201cCheck for heat signatures in the back.\u201d</p><p>Maybe the stickers were left on the van from the last owner. Maybe there weren\u2019t any kids <i>in </i>the van-</p><p>\u201cThree heat signatures detected.\u201d</p><p>Peter fought to move, to see them, to open the door to the back seat and help the children out - children. There were <i>children </i>back there.</p><p>But all he could do was gasp out, \u201cRead vitals.\u201d</p><p>Everything went quiet.</p><p>Still.</p><p>Silent.</p><p>The world itself seemed to stop spinning as Peter awaited the response.</p><p>\u201cAll dead. No vitals.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s brain shut down.</p><p>Then, it went into hyperdrive.</p><p>Peter\u2019s breath quickened as he backed away - <i>stumbled </i>away from the car, staggering as he clutched a hand to his chest. He couldn\u2019t breathe, <i>couldn\u2019t breathe-</i></p><p>\u201cPeter, you have to leave <i>now</i>. The car is about to explode.\u201d</p><p>Peter just shook his head and fell to his knees as his ears altered between hearing everything, and hearing nothing.</p><p>He was Spiderman. He should have the strength to get up and save himself.</p><p><i>But was it worth it, if everyone else was dead?</i></p><p>Suddenly, a force hit Peter from behind, and he went flying.</p><ul><li>\u2022 \u2022</li>\n</ul><p>\u201cPeter? Pete! You gotta get up, bud.\u201d A shiver of dread raced up Tony\u2019s spine as he watched the boy lying limp on the pavement, the fire behind him being put out by firemen.</p><p>He had been notified as soon as Peter went unconscious by Karen. Already, he was planning 20 different changes he could make to the suit to better protect Peter. To notify Tony <i>before </i>his kid went unconscious.</p><p>But that didn\u2019t matter now. All that did was that Peter was <i>still </i>unresponsive.</p><p>As soon as Tony was notified of Peter\u2019s condition, he raced to suit up and fly to his location, only keeping the suit on once he landed long enough to hear F.R.I.D.A.Y. tell him Peter was alive and in stable condition, before disengaging it and racing, as nothing more than Tony Stark, to the kid\u2019s side. Still, Tony couldn\u2019t stop the anxious thoughts racing through his mind, mainly revolving around the suit.</p><p>Why didn\u2019t Karen warn Peter when he was in danger? What had Tony done wrong with the programming of the suit?</p><p>How had he failed his kid so terribly?</p><p>The thoughts were quickly erased from his mind when a groan was emitted from the body on the floor.</p><p>\u201cPeter? You with me?\u201d</p><p>The boy\u2019s eyes fluttered open, Tony removing his mask just enough to see his face, but using Tony\u2019s own body to shield him from the crowd forming not far from the two. Tony knew he had to get the kid out of there. Iron Man and Spiderman crouched beside a still-smoking car crash? The news reports would be brutal.</p><p>Still, he wanted to be absolutely positive Peter was okay before moving him.</p><p>\u201cMis\u2019r S\u2019ark,\u201d Peter mumbled groggily, mouth full of cotton. Tony sighed as he momentarily rested back on his heels. He ran a hand over his forehead, stopping at the bridge of his nose as his heartbeat slowed significantly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re giving my gray hairs, kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018M sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize.\u201d</p><p>Tony gently readjusted the kid\u2019s mask so it covered his face once more, promising himself to take it off as soon as the cameras people had begin to point their way were out of sight. His chest panged when Peter\u2019s large brown eyes left his sight, and he desperately wanted to keep the mask off and just keep looking into them to assure himself that <i>Peter was okay</i>, but he knew the last thing the kid would want was others knowing his identity.</p><p>So he kept the mask on.</p><p>Tony called his suit back to him as soon as he had convinced himself Peter was alright. \u201cCome on kid, let\u2019s go back to the tower. Can you stand?\u201d</p><p>He pushed himself to his feet, waiting for the kid to join him, but he found himself waiting a second too long. A glance to where Peter remained on the floor explained why.</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes looked desperate, lost, as they drifted over the scene before him. The fire, the overturned cars-</p><p>Tony himself had to choke back a sob.</p><p>The bodies in the front seats.</p><p>And the three in the back.</p><p>\u201cKid, don\u2019t look.\u201d His voice came out weak, quivering, because it was too little, too late. Peter had already seen the damage, and no matter what Tony did, he could never remove those horrors from his kid\u2019s mind.</p><p>Peter didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d Tony urged his voice to come out stronger, more in control, as his two metal-clad hands gripped Peter\u2019s shoulders and forced them away from the wreckage. Peter fought him at first, but then allowed himself to be turned.</p><p>Allowed Tony to see the raw <i>emotion </i>on his face.</p><p>His eyes were red with unshed tears, but they weren\u2019t sad. No, they were <i>lost</i>. Hopeless. Guilt-ridden. Staring somewhere beyond Tony. Somewhere <i>through </i>him.</p><p>Like he wasn\u2019t even there.</p><p>Tony gripped his shoulder a bit tighter, essentially holding the kid up.</p><p>\u201cPete. Hey, look at me.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, hesitantly, the kid\u2019s eyes lolled their way up to find Tony\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cNot your fault.\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded slowly, as if he was in a trance. Tony knew he didn\u2019t actually agree. He wouldn\u2019t for a long while, maybe even ever - Tony understood better than most.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we go back to the tower?\u201d he murmured gently, offering his arms to Peter and helping him to his feet.</p><p>Tony allowed the kid to curl into his arms as they lifted into the sky, leaving the wreckage behind.</p><ul><li>\u2022 \u2022</li>\n</ul><p>When they touched down at the tower, it took Peter longer than expected to detangle himself from his mentor\u2019s iron-clad arms. He moved slow, sluggish, and Tony\u2019s heart ached as he watched his kid trudge into the tower.</p><p>Tony followed not too far behind, thinking back to his own mistakes, all the times he\u2019d let civilians die. How afterwards he\u2019s had trouble eating, sleeping. The first time he lost a civilian, shot in a shootout Tony was trying to prevent, he considered hanging up the suit altogether.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t.</p><p>And he would make sure Peter wouldn\u2019t, either.</p><p>Take a seat on the couch, Pete,\u201d he spoke softly when he saw Peter standing in the middle of the foyer, looking lost. \u201cYou can even turn on one of those Star Wars movies, if you like. I\u2019ll actually allow you to do it. Take advantage.\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded slowly, avoiding eye contact, as he slowly stumbled to the couch and collapsed, gingerly reaching for the remote and beginning to flip through the channels.</p><p>Tony sighed, sending one last look to his kid before jogging up the stairs and returning not two minutes later with a pile of blankets. He didn\u2019t hesitate to recline on the couch beside his kid and wrap him in the fluffiest one, knowing Peter wouldn\u2019t be opposed to the sudden contact.</p><p>But Tony wondered if he even noticed it at all.</p><p>His shoulders remained stiff, eyes focused on what was playing on the t.v., the news-</p><p>The news? But Peter <i>hated </i>the news. All the politics and arguments didn\u2019t sit right with him.</p><p>He was about to speak up when he heard an intake of breath beside him followed by a soft voice.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t hate me.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s breath caught in his throat.</p><p>Peter was shaking where he was huddled on the couch, his eyes not moving from where his knees were tucked to his chest, refusing to look up.</p><p>Tony watched his kid in disbelief, not understanding how Peter could say something so - so <i>stupid</i>. How the <i>heck</i> could Peter ever believe Tony would hate him? That was his <i>kid</i>. Peter could do anything and Tony would support him - even <i>murder</i>. Heck, Tony would help him hide the body.</p><p>With a cringe, Tony realized he had waited too long to answer as Peter\u2019s shuddering grew more violent.</p><p>Tony rested a hand on his shoulder. Peter lightly flinched, but Tony decided not to take it personally when the kid leaned into his touch shortly after.</p><p>\u201cPeter, look at me.\u201d</p><p>Peter shook his head.</p><p>Tony gripped his shoulder tighter and forced the kid around to look at him. Tony <i>hated </i>how harsh he was being, but he needed the kid to understand.</p><p>He gently placed two fingers under Peter\u2019s chin and lifted his face until Peter\u2019s large, watering brown eyes met Tony\u2019s own.</p><p>\u201cListen to me.\u201d There was more passion in his voice than he had expected, but he wasn\u2019t surprised. Tony would <i>kill </i>for Peter.</p><p>\u201cI will never, <i>ever</i>, hate you, you hear me? No matter what happens, I know the real you. I know you would never do anything to warrant my-\u201d Tony had trouble even getting the word out. \u201c-my <i>hatred</i>!\u201d</p><p>Peter still looked unsure as he fidgeted him hands in his lap, shifting uncomfortably as his eyes searched the room, chin held tightly in Tony\u2019s grasp.</p><p>\u201cBut you - you have to k-kick me out of the Av-Avengers now.\u201d</p><p>A look of confusion crossed Tony\u2019s features as he fought to not let his fingers clench in anger at how little Peter placed his self-worth.</p><p>He forced his voice to calm as his eyes softened.</p><p>\u201cAnd why would I do that?\u201d</p><p>Peter leaned back to remove his chin from Tony\u2019s grip. Tony complied, letting his hand fall to his lap as Peter looked down, ashamed, his voice deathly quiet.</p><p>\u201cI - I killed-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Tony cut him off with newfound ferocity in his voice, making Peter wince. Screw gentle. Peter needed to understand. Tony <i>desperately</i> needed Peter to understand. \u201cYou did <i>not </i>kill them. Did you crash the car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no, but-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you pour out the gasoline?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>No</i>-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you set the fire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were <i>kids</i>, Tony!\u201d</p><p>Tony froze at the sudden outburst, Peter\u2019s eyes widening at the use of the name.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Peter rushed to gasp out, but Tony just held up a finger.</p><p>\u201cNo apologizing, kid.\u201d</p><p>Peter paused a moment before letting out a light chuckle, catching the both of them off guard.</p><p>\u201cThat word felt really weird coming out of my mouth.\u201d</p><p>Tony raised his eyebrows before falling into a small fit of laughter himself.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m gonna stick with Mr. Stark.\u201d Tony nodded, appreciating the opportunity for humour, the chance to laugh with his kid again.</p><p>But the dark, haunted look that returned to cloud Peter\u2019s sullen eyes reminded Tony of the underlying threat still at hand.</p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d Tony called the kid\u2019s attention back to him. \u201cJust answer this for me. What more could you have done to save them?\u201d</p><p>Peter hesitated for a moment, looking lost; then-</p><p>\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t taken so long to get my stuff out of my locker after school, maybe I would\u2019ve been on that corner before it happened. I could\u2019ve stopped it.\u201d</p><p>Tony watched his kid with pity. This was the worst part of any mission - the \u201cwhat-ifs\u201d. What if I had moved a bit faster? What if I had turned left rather than right?</p><p>But Tony had enough experience to know that there would always be \u201cwhat-ifs\u201d. Things would always go wrong. It was how you dealt with it that mattered.</p><p>\u201cI need you to listen to me, kid.\u201d Peter looked up at Tony with wide, watering eyes, giving him a look that made Tony want to lock the doors and separate them from the outside world. Just the two of them, safe and protected forever.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t. He couldn\u2019t hide himself, and neither could Peter. They had to deal with this, to fight it. Tony would make sure Peter knew he was loved. He was <i>appreciated</i>. That never in a million years would he be <i>hated</i>.</p><p>\u201cThis was not your fault. No interrupting.\u201d Tony held up a finger when Peter opened his mouth, and he closed it again dejectedly. \u201cYou can\u2019t save everyone, kid, no matter how hard you try. And it\u2019s gonna suck. After an event like this, you\u2019re gonna want to hang up your suit. Stop fighting.\u201d Peter looked down at his lap, ashamed, and Tony guessed he had hit the nail on the head.</p><p>\u201cBut you can\u2019t. This happens to everyone, kid. Happened to me.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes flashed up in shock, and Tony chuckled humorlessly at the response.</p><p>\u201cYeah, kid, even Iron Man can\u2019t save everyone. Goodness knows I tried.\u201d</p><p>It was quiet for a minute, until Peter whispered a quiet, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Tony focused straight ahead, thinking back to the one memory that would haunt him every time he put on the suit. It had been a while ago, but he still hadn\u2019t quite forgiven himself yet. Ironic, then, that he was teaching Peter to move on. Tony just hoped that Peter could be better than he himself ever was.</p><p>\u201cIt was one of my first times wearing the suit,\u201d Tony started, staring somewhere into the distance. Peter waited quietly.</p><p>\u201cI was just flying over the city, testing out my thrusters, when I heard screaming. It was a man, with a gun, in the middle of an intersection. So I touched down and raised my thruster-\u201d</p><p>Peter clutched a hand to his mouth with a gasp. Tony looked up suddenly, realizing what it must\u2019ve sounded like.</p><p>\u201cNo, kid, geez, no, I didn\u2019t shoot him.\u201d Peter seemed to relax, but Tony inwardly cursed himself. Tony was finally proving to be the terrible monster Peter had always been too innocent to notice.</p><p>\u201cBut that was part of the problem. See, I waited too long, said some smart-ass comment-\u201d Tony sighed as he ran a hand down his face to pinch the bridge of his nose. The memory still haunted him, the look on the girl\u2019s face clear as day.</p><p>\u201cHe aimed the gun and shot it and it - it hit-\u201d</p><p>Tony cut himself off, not being able to continue. The memories were just too strong.</p><p>Tony was started by Peter moving on the couch to sit closer to his mentor, his small frame providing an insurmountable amount of comfort to the mechanic as Tony wrapped his arm around his kid and held him close.</p><p>\u201cIt was a young girl,\u201d Tony found the strength to continue, though he knew that when he finished, Peter would never look at him the same way. He guessed it was for the best, though - Tony needed to put as much distance between the two of them as possible. As much as he loved the kid, If he continued to hang around Tony, he would get hurt, or worse. The story just helped prove that.</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t have been older than five. And you want to hear what she said to bring the gunman\u2019s attention to her?\u201d</p><p>Tony blinked the tears from his eyes as the words, the voice, replayed themselves in his mind, clear as day. They were the sounds that had haunted him for the longest time, and would continue to until - well, Tony didn\u2019t know how long it would be until he forgot. Maybe never. And honestly, he didn\u2019t even know if he <i>wanted </i>to forget. He was responsible for that girl\u2019s death. He had no right to a clear conscience.</p><p>\u201cShe said, \u2018Look, mom, it\u2019s Iron Man. He\u2019ll save us.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Tony felt Peter tense in his side but tried to cherish the feeling of his kid leaning against him, realizing it might be the last time Peter would ever want to be close to him.</p><p><i>Seems about right</i>, he thought as he hastily wiped away a tear he hadn\u2019t even realized had fallen. <i>Now Peter realizes what a monster I am. I\u2019m not a hero, I\u2019m-</i></p><p>Suddenly, Peter was wrapping his arms around his mentor, resting his chin on his shoulder as Tony looked down at him in surprise.</p><p>\u201cKid, what-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot your fault.\u201d</p><p>Tony stared down at the matted curls of his kid incredulously. Why was Peter hugging him? He had killed a five-year-old-</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t kill her.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Geez</i>, kid, can you read minds or something?\u201d Tony gasped, but Peter just held him tighter. Tony rested a light hand on Peter\u2019s head, fingers threading through his soft curls.</p><p>\u201cDid you aim the gun at her?\u201d</p><p>Tony chuckled at the irony and couldn\u2019t held smiling at how <i>selfless </i>the kid was.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you pull the trigger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Did </i>you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Peter sat back up like that decided it.</p><p>\u201cThen you didn\u2019t kill her.\u201d</p><p>Tony sighed quietly as he leaned back into the couch cushions.</p><p>\u201cStill hurts.\u201d</p><p>Peter mirrored his position.</p><p>\u201cSo this feeling will never go away, then?\u201d</p><p>Tony turned his gaze to the kid and saw his brown eyes looking back sadly. Tony shook his head slightly.</p><p>\u201cNo, but you can try to move on.\u201d He spoke stronger, as if he really believed in what he was saying. For Peter\u2019s sake, at least. \u201cTry to continue saving people. Being a hero isn\u2019t the mistakes you didn\u2019t make; it\u2019s coming back from the ones you did.\u201d</p><p>Peter smiled then, but Tony could still see the brokenness behind it. He figured he would for a while. He would help him, though. He would save Peter, help him get back on his feet.</p><p>And he would never leave him. No, Peter was his kid.</p><p>Maybe that was selfish. Maybe Tony\u2019s self-destructive tendencies would rub off on the kid - maybe something worse would. Tony didn\u2019t care.</p><p>Peter was his kid, and Tony would never leave him.</p></p>",

An oblivious new young driver ran a stop sign, or someone checked their phone while behind the wheel, and the car swerved to the next lane over.</p><p>The injuries were generally the same - minor cuts or bruises, or, on the more severe end of the spectrum, a concussion. On any other day, Peter would arrive at the scene, help people out of the cars, wait for the authorities to arrive, and swing off again.</p><p>This was not any other day.</p>[[MORE]]<p>After swinging around the final corner, Peter almost fell when he saw the scene before him.</p><p>One of the vehicles, a shiny new sports car, lay on its side as smoke billowed from the hood. A tire was rolling lazily away from the vehicle as the surrounding cars had formed a ring-like space around it, all swerving to avoid the catastrophe.</p><p>But that wasn\u2019t what concerned Peter the most.</p><p>In front of the overturned car, having plowed into the brick wall of a shoe store, was a minivan, the bumper sticker of a mother, father, and three baby girls on the back window.</p><p>The minivan had hit the wall hard enough to leave a dent, dust beginning to rise from the settling brick. The entire right side of the vehicle was pressed against the wall, parts of it dented and crumpled from the pure force of the impact.</p><p>Peter tried to shake off the hollow feeling of dread in his stomach as he shook his head and swung into action.</p><p>He went first for the minivan, the three smiling stick figures of children seeming to taunt Peter as he brought himself down in the middle of the street, quickly running the final steps to the red van.</p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d Peter jumped at the sudden reminder of Karen. \u201cDo you require my assistance?\u201d</p><p>Peter found his head spinning. Why - why couldn\u2019t he focus? He was <i>Spiderman</i>. He had rescued people from car crashes before. He could do this.</p><p>\u201cY-yeah, Karen.\u201d He hated how young his voice shouted.</p><p>\u201cBefore we begin, there is gasoline dripping from the vehicle behind you. It may light soon.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s breath quickened. \u201cLet\u2019s make this fast, then.\u201d He reassessed the vehicle in front of him, fighting to keep his breathing steady. \u201cWhere\u2019s my best point of entry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDriver\u2019s side door is the only one not tainted by rubble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Karen.\u201d</p><p>Peter reached out a shaking hand <i>(why was it shaking?)</i> and gripped the handle, easily pulling it open with his extra strength. Spoke billowed out but his mask stopped him from squinting against it. And when it cleared\u2026.</p><p>He expected crying.</p><p>Screaming.</p><p>Pleads for help.</p><p>He didn\u2019t expect <i>silence</i>.</p><p>Peter\u2019s heart beat faster, blocking out the noises of the oncoming sirens. <i>Were they even still there? Was help ever coming?</i></p><p>\u201cPeter, a small fire has started in the engine of the vehicle behind you.\u201d Karen\u2019s soft voice interrupted his thoughts, but at the moment even the gentle AI couldn\u2019t snap him out of his predicament. Peter ignored her and instead asked his own question, focusing on the slumped-over man behind the wheel, not being able to take his eyes off where the man\u2019s eyes were - were rolled back in his-</p><p>\u201cKaren, read his vitals.\u201d</p><p>His heart pounded in his throat as he assessed the pale face and the blood dripping down the various wounds of the man before him. The airbag was deployed but it was tinted - it was tinted <i>red</i>-</p><p>\u201cDead. No vitals.\u201d</p><p>Peter felt like he was going to throw up.</p><p>\u201cPeter, the fire is spreading dangerously close to the gasoline-\u201d</p><p>\u201cRead the woman\u2019s vitals,\u201d he ignored her, finding the mother in the passenger seat.</p><p>His limbs felt like lead, and he wasn\u2019t sure how long he stood there, waiting for Karen\u2019s response.</p><p>Could\u2019ve been days.</p><p>Could\u2019ve been mere seconds.</p><p>It didn\u2019t change her answer.</p><p>\u201cDead. No vitals.\u201d</p><p>Peter shook his head.</p><p>Spiderman.</p><p><i>He was Spiderman.</i></p><p>Focus.</p><p>\u201cPeter, the flame-\u201d</p><p>\u201cKaren,\u201d he choked out. He had to save them. He was Spiderman; he <i>had </i>to save them.</p><p>\u201cCheck for heat signatures in the back.\u201d</p><p>Maybe the stickers were left on the van from the last owner. Maybe there weren\u2019t any kids <i>in </i>the van-</p><p>\u201cThree heat signatures detected.\u201d</p><p>Peter fought to move, to see them, to open the door to the back seat and help the children out - children. There were <i>children </i>back there.</p><p>But all he could do was gasp out, \u201cRead vitals.\u201d</p><p>Everything went quiet.</p><p>Still.</p><p>Silent.</p><p>The world itself seemed to stop spinning as Peter awaited the response.</p><p>\u201cAll dead. No vitals.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s brain shut down.</p><p>Then, it went into hyperdrive.</p><p>Peter\u2019s breath quickened as he backed away - <i>stumbled </i>away from the car, staggering as he clutched a hand to his chest. He couldn\u2019t breathe, <i>couldn\u2019t breathe-</i></p><p>\u201cPeter, you have to leave <i>now</i>. The car is about to explode.\u201d</p><p>Peter just shook his head and fell to his knees as his ears altered between hearing everything, and hearing nothing.</p><p>He was Spiderman. He should have the strength to get up and save himself.</p><p><i>But was it worth it, if everyone else was dead?</i></p><p>Suddenly, a force hit Peter from behind, and he went flying.</p><ul><li>\u2022 \u2022</li>\n</ul><p>\u201cPeter? Pete! You gotta get up, bud.\u201d A shiver of dread raced up Tony\u2019s spine as he watched the boy lying limp on the pavement, the fire behind him being put out by firemen.</p><p>He had been notified as soon as Peter went unconscious by Karen. Already, he was planning 20 different changes he could make to the suit to better protect Peter. To notify Tony <i>before </i>his kid went unconscious.</p><p>But that didn\u2019t matter now. All that did was that Peter was <i>still </i>unresponsive.</p><p>As soon as Tony was notified of Peter\u2019s condition, he raced to suit up and fly to his location, only keeping the suit on once he landed long enough to hear F.R.I.D.A.Y. tell him Peter was alive and in stable condition, before disengaging it and racing, as nothing more than Tony Stark, to the kid\u2019s side. Still, Tony couldn\u2019t stop the anxious thoughts racing through his mind, mainly revolving around the suit.</p><p>Why didn\u2019t Karen warn Peter when he was in danger? What had Tony done wrong with the programming of the suit?</p><p>How had he failed his kid so terribly?</p><p>The thoughts were quickly erased from his mind when a groan was emitted from the body on the floor.</p><p>\u201cPeter? You with me?\u201d</p><p>The boy\u2019s eyes fluttered open, Tony removing his mask just enough to see his face, but using Tony\u2019s own body to shield him from the crowd forming not far from the two. Tony knew he had to get the kid out of there. Iron Man and Spiderman crouched beside a still-smoking car crash? The news reports would be brutal.</p><p>Still, he wanted to be absolutely positive Peter was okay before moving him.</p><p>\u201cMis\u2019r S\u2019ark,\u201d Peter mumbled groggily, mouth full of cotton. Tony sighed as he momentarily rested back on his heels. He ran a hand over his forehead, stopping at the bridge of his nose as his heartbeat slowed significantly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re giving my gray hairs, kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018M sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize.\u201d</p><p>Tony gently readjusted the kid\u2019s mask so it covered his face once more, promising himself to take it off as soon as the cameras people had begin to point their way were out of sight. His chest panged when Peter\u2019s large brown eyes left his sight, and he desperately wanted to keep the mask off and just keep looking into them to assure himself that <i>Peter was okay</i>, but he knew the last thing the kid would want was others knowing his identity.</p><p>So he kept the mask on.</p><p>Tony called his suit back to him as soon as he had convinced himself Peter was alright. \u201cCome on kid, let\u2019s go back to the tower. Can you stand?\u201d</p><p>He pushed himself to his feet, waiting for the kid to join him, but he found himself waiting a second too long. A glance to where Peter remained on the floor explained why.</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes looked desperate, lost, as they drifted over the scene before him. The fire, the overturned cars-</p><p>Tony himself had to choke back a sob.</p><p>The bodies in the front seats.</p><p>And the three in the back.</p><p>\u201cKid, don\u2019t look.\u201d His voice came out weak, quivering, because it was too little, too late. Peter had already seen the damage, and no matter what Tony did, he could never remove those horrors from his kid\u2019s mind.</p><p>Peter didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d Tony urged his voice to come out stronger, more in control, as his two metal-clad hands gripped Peter\u2019s shoulders and forced them away from the wreckage. Peter fought him at first, but then allowed himself to be turned.</p><p>Allowed Tony to see the raw <i>emotion </i>on his face.</p><p>His eyes were red with unshed tears, but they weren\u2019t sad. No, they were <i>lost</i>. Hopeless. Guilt-ridden. Staring somewhere beyond Tony. Somewhere <i>through </i>him.</p><p>Like he wasn\u2019t even there.</p><p>Tony gripped his shoulder a bit tighter, essentially holding the kid up.</p><p>\u201cPete. Hey, look at me.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, hesitantly, the kid\u2019s eyes lolled their way up to find Tony\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cNot your fault.\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded slowly, as if he was in a trance. Tony knew he didn\u2019t actually agree. He wouldn\u2019t for a long while, maybe even ever - Tony understood better than most.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we go back to the tower?\u201d he murmured gently, offering his arms to Peter and helping him to his feet.</p><p>Tony allowed the kid to curl into his arms as they lifted into the sky, leaving the wreckage behind.</p><ul><li>\u2022 \u2022</li>\n</ul><p>When they touched down at the tower, it took Peter longer than expected to detangle himself from his mentor\u2019s iron-clad arms. He moved slow, sluggish, and Tony\u2019s heart ached as he watched his kid trudge into the tower.</p><p>Tony followed not too far behind, thinking back to his own mistakes, all the times he\u2019d let civilians die. How afterwards he\u2019s had trouble eating, sleeping. The first time he lost a civilian, shot in a shootout Tony was trying to prevent, he considered hanging up the suit altogether.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t.</p><p>And he would make sure Peter wouldn\u2019t, either.</p><p>Take a seat on the couch, Pete,\u201d he spoke softly when he saw Peter standing in the middle of the foyer, looking lost. \u201cYou can even turn on one of those Star Wars movies, if you like. I\u2019ll actually allow you to do it. Take advantage.\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded slowly, avoiding eye contact, as he slowly stumbled to the couch and collapsed, gingerly reaching for the remote and beginning to flip through the channels.</p><p>Tony sighed, sending one last look to his kid before jogging up the stairs and returning not two minutes later with a pile of blankets. He didn\u2019t hesitate to recline on the couch beside his kid and wrap him in the fluffiest one, knowing Peter wouldn\u2019t be opposed to the sudden contact.</p><p>But Tony wondered if he even noticed it at all.</p><p>His shoulders remained stiff, eyes focused on what was playing on the t.v., the news-</p><p>The news? But Peter <i>hated </i>the news. All the politics and arguments didn\u2019t sit right with him.</p><p>He was about to speak up when he heard an intake of breath beside him followed by a soft voice.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t hate me.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s breath caught in his throat.</p><p>Peter was shaking where he was huddled on the couch, his eyes not moving from where his knees were tucked to his chest, refusing to look up.</p><p>Tony watched his kid in disbelief, not understanding how Peter could say something so - so <i>stupid</i>. How the <i>heck</i> could Peter ever believe Tony would hate him? That was his <i>kid</i>. Peter could do anything and Tony would support him - even <i>murder</i>. Heck, Tony would help him hide the body.</p><p>With a cringe, Tony realized he had waited too long to answer as Peter\u2019s shuddering grew more violent.</p><p>Tony rested a hand on his shoulder. Peter lightly flinched, but Tony decided not to take it personally when the kid leaned into his touch shortly after.</p><p>\u201cPeter, look at me.\u201d</p><p>Peter shook his head.</p><p>Tony gripped his shoulder tighter and forced the kid around to look at him. Tony <i>hated </i>how harsh he was being, but he needed the kid to understand.</p><p>He gently placed two fingers under Peter\u2019s chin and lifted his face until Peter\u2019s large, watering brown eyes met Tony\u2019s own.</p><p>\u201cListen to me.\u201d There was more passion in his voice than he had expected, but he wasn\u2019t surprised. Tony would <i>kill </i>for Peter.</p><p>\u201cI will never, <i>ever</i>, hate you, you hear me? No matter what happens, I know the real you. I know you would never do anything to warrant my-\u201d Tony had trouble even getting the word out. \u201c-my <i>hatred</i>!\u201d</p><p>Peter still looked unsure as he fidgeted him hands in his lap, shifting uncomfortably as his eyes searched the room, chin held tightly in Tony\u2019s grasp.</p><p>\u201cBut you - you have to k-kick me out of the Av-Avengers now.\u201d</p><p>A look of confusion crossed Tony\u2019s features as he fought to not let his fingers clench in anger at how little Peter placed his self-worth.</p><p>He forced his voice to calm as his eyes softened.</p><p>\u201cAnd why would I do that?\u201d</p><p>Peter leaned back to remove his chin from Tony\u2019s grip. Tony complied, letting his hand fall to his lap as Peter looked down, ashamed, his voice deathly quiet.</p><p>\u201cI - I killed-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Tony cut him off with newfound ferocity in his voice, making Peter wince. Screw gentle. Peter needed to understand. Tony <i>desperately</i> needed Peter to understand. \u201cYou did <i>not </i>kill them. Did you crash the car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no, but-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you pour out the gasoline?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>No</i>-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you set the fire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were <i>kids</i>, Tony!\u201d</p><p>Tony froze at the sudden outburst, Peter\u2019s eyes widening at the use of the name.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Peter rushed to gasp out, but Tony just held up a finger.</p><p>\u201cNo apologizing, kid.\u201d</p><p>Peter paused a moment before letting out a light chuckle, catching the both of them off guard.</p><p>\u201cThat word felt really weird coming out of my mouth.\u201d</p><p>Tony raised his eyebrows before falling into a small fit of laughter himself.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m gonna stick with Mr. Stark.\u201d Tony nodded, appreciating the opportunity for humour, the chance to laugh with his kid again.</p><p>But the dark, haunted look that returned to cloud Peter\u2019s sullen eyes reminded Tony of the underlying threat still at hand.</p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d Tony called the kid\u2019s attention back to him. \u201cJust answer this for me. What more could you have done to save them?\u201d</p><p>Peter hesitated for a moment, looking lost; then-</p><p>\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t taken so long to get my stuff out of my locker after school, maybe I would\u2019ve been on that corner before it happened. I could\u2019ve stopped it.\u201d</p><p>Tony watched his kid with pity. This was the worst part of any mission - the \u201cwhat-ifs\u201d. What if I had moved a bit faster? What if I had turned left rather than right?</p><p>But Tony had enough experience to know that there would always be \u201cwhat-ifs\u201d. Things would always go wrong. It was how you dealt with it that mattered.</p><p>\u201cI need you to listen to me, kid.\u201d Peter looked up at Tony with wide, watering eyes, giving him a look that made Tony want to lock the doors and separate them from the outside world. Just the two of them, safe and protected forever.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t. He couldn\u2019t hide himself, and neither could Peter. They had to deal with this, to fight it. Tony would make sure Peter knew he was loved. He was <i>appreciated</i>. That never in a million years would he be <i>hated</i>.</p><p>\u201cThis was not your fault. No interrupting.\u201d Tony held up a finger when Peter opened his mouth, and he closed it again dejectedly. \u201cYou can\u2019t save everyone, kid, no matter how hard you try. And it\u2019s gonna suck. After an event like this, you\u2019re gonna want to hang up your suit. Stop fighting.\u201d Peter looked down at his lap, ashamed, and Tony guessed he had hit the nail on the head.</p><p>\u201cBut you can\u2019t. This happens to everyone, kid. Happened to me.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes flashed up in shock, and Tony chuckled humorlessly at the response.</p><p>\u201cYeah, kid, even Iron Man can\u2019t save everyone. Goodness knows I tried.\u201d</p><p>It was quiet for a minute, until Peter whispered a quiet, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Tony focused straight ahead, thinking back to the one memory that would haunt him every time he put on the suit. It had been a while ago, but he still hadn\u2019t quite forgiven himself yet. Ironic, then, that he was teaching Peter to move on. Tony just hoped that Peter could be better than he himself ever was.</p><p>\u201cIt was one of my first times wearing the suit,\u201d Tony started, staring somewhere into the distance. Peter waited quietly.</p><p>\u201cI was just flying over the city, testing out my thrusters, when I heard screaming. It was a man, with a gun, in the middle of an intersection. So I touched down and raised my thruster-\u201d</p><p>Peter clutched a hand to his mouth with a gasp. Tony looked up suddenly, realizing what it must\u2019ve sounded like.</p><p>\u201cNo, kid, geez, no, I didn\u2019t shoot him.\u201d Peter seemed to relax, but Tony inwardly cursed himself. Tony was finally proving to be the terrible monster Peter had always been too innocent to notice.</p><p>\u201cBut that was part of the problem. See, I waited too long, said some smart-ass comment-\u201d Tony sighed as he ran a hand down his face to pinch the bridge of his nose. The memory still haunted him, the look on the girl\u2019s face clear as day.</p><p>\u201cHe aimed the gun and shot it and it - it hit-\u201d</p><p>Tony cut himself off, not being able to continue. The memories were just too strong.</p><p>Tony was started by Peter moving on the couch to sit closer to his mentor, his small frame providing an insurmountable amount of comfort to the mechanic as Tony wrapped his arm around his kid and held him close.</p><p>\u201cIt was a young girl,\u201d Tony found the strength to continue, though he knew that when he finished, Peter would never look at him the same way. He guessed it was for the best, though - Tony needed to put as much distance between the two of them as possible. As much as he loved the kid, If he continued to hang around Tony, he would get hurt, or worse. The story just helped prove that.</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t have been older than five. And you want to hear what she said to bring the gunman\u2019s attention to her?\u201d</p><p>Tony blinked the tears from his eyes as the words, the voice, replayed themselves in his mind, clear as day. They were the sounds that had haunted him for the longest time, and would continue to until - well, Tony didn\u2019t know how long it would be until he forgot. Maybe never. And honestly, he didn\u2019t even know if he <i>wanted </i>to forget. He was responsible for that girl\u2019s death. He had no right to a clear conscience.</p><p>\u201cShe said, \u2018Look, mom, it\u2019s Iron Man. He\u2019ll save us.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Tony felt Peter tense in his side but tried to cherish the feeling of his kid leaning against him, realizing it might be the last time Peter would ever want to be close to him.</p><p><i>Seems about right</i>, he thought as he hastily wiped away a tear he hadn\u2019t even realized had fallen. <i>Now Peter realizes what a monster I am. I\u2019m not a hero, I\u2019m-</i></p><p>Suddenly, Peter was wrapping his arms around his mentor, resting his chin on his shoulder as Tony looked down at him in surprise.</p><p>\u201cKid, what-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot your fault.\u201d</p><p>Tony stared down at the matted curls of his kid incredulously. Why was Peter hugging him? He had killed a five-year-old-</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t kill her.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Geez</i>, kid, can you read minds or something?\u201d Tony gasped, but Peter just held him tighter. Tony rested a light hand on Peter\u2019s head, fingers threading through his soft curls.</p><p>\u201cDid you aim the gun at her?\u201d</p><p>Tony chuckled at the irony and couldn\u2019t held smiling at how <i>selfless </i>the kid was.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you pull the trigger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Did </i>you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Peter sat back up like that decided it.</p><p>\u201cThen you didn\u2019t kill her.\u201d</p><p>Tony sighed quietly as he leaned back into the couch cushions.</p><p>\u201cStill hurts.\u201d</p><p>Peter mirrored his position.</p><p>\u201cSo this feeling will never go away, then?\u201d</p><p>Tony turned his gaze to the kid and saw his brown eyes looking back sadly. Tony shook his head slightly.</p><p>\u201cNo, but you can try to move on.\u201d He spoke stronger, as if he really believed in what he was saying. For Peter\u2019s sake, at least. \u201cTry to continue saving people. Being a hero isn\u2019t the mistakes you didn\u2019t make; it\u2019s coming back from the ones you did.\u201d</p><p>Peter smiled then, but Tony could still see the brokenness behind it. He figured he would for a while. He would help him, though. He would save Peter, help him get back on his feet.</p><p>And he would never leave him. No, Peter was his kid.</p><p>Maybe that was selfish. Maybe Tony\u2019s self-destructive tendencies would rub off on the kid - maybe something worse would. Tony didn\u2019t care.</p><p>Peter was his kid, and Tony would never leave him.</p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h2><b>Irondad || Angst &amp; Comfort || WC: 3.6k</b></h2><p>Peter was patrolling 14th Street when he heard a loud BANG, followed by the unmistakable tire squeal of a car veering off the road.<br /></p><p>He immediately swung into action, ricocheting off and around buildings to where he heard the noise.</p><p>Peter had dealt with car crashes before. An oblivious new young driver ran a stop sign, or someone checked their phone while behind the wheel, and the car swerved to the next lane over.</p><p>The injuries were generally the same - minor cuts or bruises, or, on the more severe end of the spectrum, a concussion. On any other day, Peter would arrive at the scene, help people out of the cars, wait for the authorities to arrive, and swing off again.</p><p>This was not any other day.</p><p>After swinging around the final corner, Peter almost fell when he saw the scene before him.</p><p>One of the vehicles, a shiny new sports car, lay on its side as smoke billowed from the hood. A tire was rolling lazily away from the vehicle as the surrounding cars had formed a ring-like space around it, all swerving to avoid the catastrophe.</p><p>But that wasn&rsquo;t what concerned Peter the most.</p><p>In front of the overturned car, having plowed into the brick wall of a shoe store, was a minivan, the bumper sticker of a mother, father, and three baby girls on the back window.</p><p>The minivan had hit the wall hard enough to leave a dent, dust beginning to rise from the settling brick. The entire right side of the vehicle was pressed against the wall, parts of it dented and crumpled from the pure force of the impact.</p><p>Peter tried to shake off the hollow feeling of dread in his stomach as he shook his head and swung into action.</p><p>He went first for the minivan, the three smiling stick figures of children seeming to taunt Peter as he brought himself down in the middle of the street, quickly running the final steps to the red van.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter.&rdquo; Peter jumped at the sudden reminder of Karen. &ldquo;Do you require my assistance?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter found his head spinning. Why - why couldn&rsquo;t he focus? He was <i>Spiderman</i>. He had rescued people from car crashes before. He could do this.</p><p>&ldquo;Y-yeah, Karen.&rdquo; He hated how young his voice shouted.</p><p>&ldquo;Before we begin, there is gasoline dripping from the vehicle behind you. It may light soon.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s breath quickened. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make this fast, then.&rdquo; He reassessed the vehicle in front of him, fighting to keep his breathing steady. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my best point of entry?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Driver&rsquo;s side door is the only one not tainted by rubble.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, Karen.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter reached out a shaking hand <i>(why was it shaking?)</i> and gripped the handle, easily pulling it open with his extra strength. Spoke billowed out but his mask stopped him from squinting against it. And when it cleared&hellip;.</p><p>He expected crying.</p><p>Screaming.</p><p>Pleads for help.</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t expect <i>silence</i>.</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s heart beat faster, blocking out the noises of the oncoming sirens. <i>Were they even still there? Was help ever coming?</i></p><p>&ldquo;Peter, a small fire has started in the engine of the vehicle behind you.&rdquo; Karen&rsquo;s soft voice interrupted his thoughts, but at the moment even the gentle AI couldn&rsquo;t snap him out of his predicament. Peter ignored her and instead asked his own question, focusing on the slumped-over man behind the wheel, not being able to take his eyes off where the man&rsquo;s eyes were - were rolled back in his-</p><p>&ldquo;Karen, read his vitals.&rdquo;</p><p>His heart pounded in his throat as he assessed the pale face and the blood dripping down the various wounds of the man before him. The airbag was deployed but it was tinted - it was tinted <i>red</i>-</p><p>&ldquo;Dead. No vitals.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter felt like he was going to throw up.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter, the fire is spreading dangerously close to the gasoline-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Read the woman&rsquo;s vitals,&rdquo; he ignored her, finding the mother in the passenger seat.</p><p>His limbs felt like lead, and he wasn&rsquo;t sure how long he stood there, waiting for Karen&rsquo;s response.</p><p>Could&rsquo;ve been days.</p><p>Could&rsquo;ve been mere seconds.</p><p>It didn&rsquo;t change her answer.</p><p>&ldquo;Dead. No vitals.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter shook his head.</p><p>Spiderman.</p><p><i>He was Spiderman.</i></p><p>Focus.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter, the flame-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Karen,&rdquo; he choked out. He had to save them. He was Spiderman; he <i>had </i>to save them.</p><p>&ldquo;Check for heat signatures in the back.&rdquo;</p><p>Maybe the stickers were left on the van from the last owner. Maybe there weren&rsquo;t any kids <i>in </i>the van-</p><p>&ldquo;Three heat signatures detected.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter fought to move, to see them, to open the door to the back seat and help the children out - children. There were <i>children </i>back there.</p><p>But all he could do was gasp out, &ldquo;Read vitals.&rdquo;</p><p>Everything went quiet.</p><p>Still.</p><p>Silent.</p><p>The world itself seemed to stop spinning as Peter awaited the response.</p><p>&ldquo;All dead. No vitals.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s brain shut down.</p><p>Then, it went into hyperdrive.</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s breath quickened as he backed away - <i>stumbled </i>away from the car, staggering as he clutched a hand to his chest. He couldn&rsquo;t breathe, <i>couldn&rsquo;t breathe-</i></p><p>&ldquo;Peter, you have to leave <i>now</i>. The car is about to explode.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter just shook his head and fell to his knees as his ears altered between hearing everything, and hearing nothing.</p><p>He was Spiderman. He should have the strength to get up and save himself.</p><p><i>But was it worth it, if everyone else was dead?</i></p><p>Suddenly, a force hit Peter from behind, and he went flying.</p><ul><li>&bull; &bull;</li>\n</ul><p>&ldquo;Peter? Pete! You gotta get up, bud.&rdquo; A shiver of dread raced up Tony&rsquo;s spine as he watched the boy lying limp on the pavement, the fire behind him being put out by firemen.</p><p>He had been notified as soon as Peter went unconscious by Karen. Already, he was planning 20 different changes he could make to the suit to better protect Peter. To notify Tony <i>before </i>his kid went unconscious.</p><p>But that didn&rsquo;t matter now. All that did was that Peter was <i>still </i>unresponsive.</p><p>As soon as Tony was notified of Peter&rsquo;s condition, he raced to suit up and fly to his location, only keeping the suit on once he landed long enough to hear F.R.I.D.A.Y. tell him Peter was alive and in stable condition, before disengaging it and racing, as nothing more than Tony Stark, to the kid&rsquo;s side. Still, Tony couldn&rsquo;t stop the anxious thoughts racing through his mind, mainly revolving around the suit.</p><p>Why didn&rsquo;t Karen warn Peter when he was in danger? What had Tony done wrong with the programming of the suit?</p><p>How had he failed his kid so terribly?</p><p>The thoughts were quickly erased from his mind when a groan was emitted from the body on the floor.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter? You with me?&rdquo;</p><p>The boy&rsquo;s eyes fluttered open, Tony removing his mask just enough to see his face, but using Tony&rsquo;s own body to shield him from the crowd forming not far from the two. Tony knew he had to get the kid out of there. Iron Man and Spiderman crouched beside a still-smoking car crash? The news reports would be brutal.</p><p>Still, he wanted to be absolutely positive Peter was okay before moving him.</p><p>&ldquo;Mis&rsquo;r S&rsquo;ark,&rdquo; Peter mumbled groggily, mouth full of cotton. Tony sighed as he momentarily rested back on his heels. He ran a hand over his forehead, stopping at the bridge of his nose as his heartbeat slowed significantly.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re giving my gray hairs, kid.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;M sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t apologize.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony gently readjusted the kid&rsquo;s mask so it covered his face once more, promising himself to take it off as soon as the cameras people had begin to point their way were out of sight. His chest panged when Peter&rsquo;s large brown eyes left his sight, and he desperately wanted to keep the mask off and just keep looking into them to assure himself that <i>Peter was okay</i>, but he knew the last thing the kid would want was others knowing his identity.</p><p>So he kept the mask on.</p><p>Tony called his suit back to him as soon as he had convinced himself Peter was alright. &ldquo;Come on kid, let&rsquo;s go back to the tower. Can you stand?&rdquo;</p><p>He pushed himself to his feet, waiting for the kid to join him, but he found himself waiting a second too long. A glance to where Peter remained on the floor explained why.</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s eyes looked desperate, lost, as they drifted over the scene before him. The fire, the overturned cars-</p><p>Tony himself had to choke back a sob.</p><p>The bodies in the front seats.</p><p>And the three in the back.</p><p>&ldquo;Kid, don&rsquo;t look.&rdquo; His voice came out weak, quivering, because it was too little, too late. Peter had already seen the damage, and no matter what Tony did, he could never remove those horrors from his kid&rsquo;s mind.</p><p>Peter didn&rsquo;t respond.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter.&rdquo; Tony urged his voice to come out stronger, more in control, as his two metal-clad hands gripped Peter&rsquo;s shoulders and forced them away from the wreckage. Peter fought him at first, but then allowed himself to be turned.</p><p>Allowed Tony to see the raw <i>emotion </i>on his face.</p><p>His eyes were red with unshed tears, but they weren&rsquo;t sad. No, they were <i>lost</i>. Hopeless. Guilt-ridden. Staring somewhere beyond Tony. Somewhere <i>through </i>him.</p><p>Like he wasn&rsquo;t even there.</p><p>Tony gripped his shoulder a bit tighter, essentially holding the kid up.</p><p>&ldquo;Pete. Hey, look at me.&rdquo;</p><p>Slowly, hesitantly, the kid&rsquo;s eyes lolled their way up to find Tony&rsquo;s.</p><p>&ldquo;Not your fault.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter nodded slowly, as if he was in a trance. Tony knew he didn&rsquo;t actually agree. He wouldn&rsquo;t for a long while, maybe even ever - Tony understood better than most.</p><p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we go back to the tower?&rdquo; he murmured gently, offering his arms to Peter and helping him to his feet.</p><p>Tony allowed the kid to curl into his arms as they lifted into the sky, leaving the wreckage behind.</p><ul><li>&bull; &bull;</li>\n</ul><p>When they touched down at the tower, it took Peter longer than expected to detangle himself from his mentor&rsquo;s iron-clad arms. He moved slow, sluggish, and Tony&rsquo;s heart ached as he watched his kid trudge into the tower.</p><p>Tony followed not too far behind, thinking back to his own mistakes, all the times he&rsquo;d let civilians die. How afterwards he&rsquo;s had trouble eating, sleeping. The first time he lost a civilian, shot in a shootout Tony was trying to prevent, he considered hanging up the suit altogether.</p><p>But he didn&rsquo;t.</p><p>And he would make sure Peter wouldn&rsquo;t, either.</p><p>Take a seat on the couch, Pete,&rdquo; he spoke softly when he saw Peter standing in the middle of the foyer, looking lost. &ldquo;You can even turn on one of those Star Wars movies, if you like. I&rsquo;ll actually allow you to do it. Take advantage.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter nodded slowly, avoiding eye contact, as he slowly stumbled to the couch and collapsed, gingerly reaching for the remote and beginning to flip through the channels.</p><p>Tony sighed, sending one last look to his kid before jogging up the stairs and returning not two minutes later with a pile of blankets. He didn&rsquo;t hesitate to recline on the couch beside his kid and wrap him in the fluffiest one, knowing Peter wouldn&rsquo;t be opposed to the sudden contact.</p><p>But Tony wondered if he even noticed it at all.</p><p>His shoulders remained stiff, eyes focused on what was playing on the t.v., the news-</p><p>The news? But Peter <i>hated </i>the news. All the politics and arguments didn&rsquo;t sit right with him.</p><p>He was about to speak up when he heard an intake of breath beside him followed by a soft voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t hate me.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s breath caught in his throat.</p><p>Peter was shaking where he was huddled on the couch, his eyes not moving from where his knees were tucked to his chest, refusing to look up.</p><p>Tony watched his kid in disbelief, not understanding how Peter could say something so - so <i>stupid</i>. How the <i>heck</i> could Peter ever believe Tony would hate him? That was his <i>kid</i>. Peter could do anything and Tony would support him - even <i>murder</i>. Heck, Tony would help him hide the body.</p><p>With a cringe, Tony realized he had waited too long to answer as Peter&rsquo;s shuddering grew more violent.</p><p>Tony rested a hand on his shoulder. Peter lightly flinched, but Tony decided not to take it personally when the kid leaned into his touch shortly after.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter, look at me.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter shook his head.</p><p>Tony gripped his shoulder tighter and forced the kid around to look at him. Tony <i>hated </i>how harsh he was being, but he needed the kid to understand.</p><p>He gently placed two fingers under Peter&rsquo;s chin and lifted his face until Peter&rsquo;s large, watering brown eyes met Tony&rsquo;s own.</p><p>&ldquo;Listen to me.&rdquo; There was more passion in his voice than he had expected, but he wasn&rsquo;t surprised. Tony would <i>kill </i>for Peter.</p><p>&ldquo;I will never, <i>ever</i>, hate you, you hear me? No matter what happens, I know the real you. I know you would never do anything to warrant my-&rdquo; Tony had trouble even getting the word out. &ldquo;-my <i>hatred</i>!&rdquo;</p><p>Peter still looked unsure as he fidgeted him hands in his lap, shifting uncomfortably as his eyes searched the room, chin held tightly in Tony&rsquo;s grasp.</p><p>&ldquo;But you - you have to k-kick me out of the Av-Avengers now.&rdquo;</p><p>A look of confusion crossed Tony&rsquo;s features as he fought to not let his fingers clench in anger at how little Peter placed his self-worth.</p><p>He forced his voice to calm as his eyes softened.</p><p>&ldquo;And why would I do that?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter leaned back to remove his chin from Tony&rsquo;s grip. Tony complied, letting his hand fall to his lap as Peter looked down, ashamed, his voice deathly quiet.</p><p>&ldquo;I - I killed-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Tony cut him off with newfound ferocity in his voice, making Peter wince. Screw gentle. Peter needed to understand. Tony <i>desperately</i> needed Peter to understand. &ldquo;You did <i>not </i>kill them. Did you crash the car?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, no, but-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did you pour out the gasoline?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>No</i>-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did you set the fire?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There were <i>kids</i>, Tony!&rdquo;</p><p>Tony froze at the sudden outburst, Peter&rsquo;s eyes widening at the use of the name.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Peter rushed to gasp out, but Tony just held up a finger.</p><p>&ldquo;No apologizing, kid.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter paused a moment before letting out a light chuckle, catching the both of them off guard.</p><p>&ldquo;That word felt really weird coming out of my mouth.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony raised his eyebrows before falling into a small fit of laughter himself.</p><p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m gonna stick with Mr. Stark.&rdquo; Tony nodded, appreciating the opportunity for humour, the chance to laugh with his kid again.</p><p>But the dark, haunted look that returned to cloud Peter&rsquo;s sullen eyes reminded Tony of the underlying threat still at hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter.&rdquo; Tony called the kid&rsquo;s attention back to him. &ldquo;Just answer this for me. What more could you have done to save them?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter hesitated for a moment, looking lost; then-</p><p>&ldquo;If I hadn&rsquo;t taken so long to get my stuff out of my locker after school, maybe I would&rsquo;ve been on that corner before it happened. I could&rsquo;ve stopped it.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony watched his kid with pity. This was the worst part of any mission - the &ldquo;what-ifs&rdquo;. What if I had moved a bit faster? What if I had turned left rather than right?</p><p>But Tony had enough experience to know that there would always be &ldquo;what-ifs&rdquo;. Things would always go wrong. It was how you dealt with it that mattered.</p><p>&ldquo;I need you to listen to me, kid.&rdquo; Peter looked up at Tony with wide, watering eyes, giving him a look that made Tony want to lock the doors and separate them from the outside world. Just the two of them, safe and protected forever.</p><p>But he couldn&rsquo;t. He couldn&rsquo;t hide himself, and neither could Peter. They had to deal with this, to fight it. Tony would make sure Peter knew he was loved. He was <i>appreciated</i>. That never in a million years would he be <i>hated</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;This was not your fault. No interrupting.&rdquo; Tony held up a finger when Peter opened his mouth, and he closed it again dejectedly. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t save everyone, kid, no matter how hard you try.

Stop fighting.&rdquo; Peter looked down at his lap, ashamed, and Tony guessed he had hit the nail on the head.</p><p>&ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t. This happens to everyone, kid. Happened to me.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s eyes flashed up in shock, and Tony chuckled humorlessly at the response.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, kid, even Iron Man can&rsquo;t save everyone. Goodness knows I tried.&rdquo;</p><p>It was quiet for a minute, until Peter whispered a quiet, &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony focused straight ahead, thinking back to the one memory that would haunt him every time he put on the suit. It had been a while ago, but he still hadn&rsquo;t quite forgiven himself yet. Ironic, then, that he was teaching Peter to move on. Tony just hoped that Peter could be better than he himself ever was.</p><p>&ldquo;It was one of my first times wearing the suit,&rdquo; Tony started, staring somewhere into the distance. Peter waited quietly.</p><p>&ldquo;I was just flying over the city, testing out my thrusters, when I heard screaming. It was a man, with a gun, in the middle of an intersection. So I touched down and raised my thruster-&rdquo;</p><p>Peter clutched a hand to his mouth with a gasp. Tony looked up suddenly, realizing what it must&rsquo;ve sounded like.</p><p>&ldquo;No, kid, geez, no, I didn&rsquo;t shoot him.&rdquo; Peter seemed to relax, but Tony inwardly cursed himself. Tony was finally proving to be the terrible monster Peter had always been too innocent to notice.</p><p>&ldquo;But that was part of the problem. See, I waited too long, said some smart-ass comment-&rdquo; Tony sighed as he ran a hand down his face to pinch the bridge of his nose. The memory still haunted him, the look on the girl&rsquo;s face clear as day.</p><p>&ldquo;He aimed the gun and shot it and it - it hit-&rdquo;</p><p>Tony cut himself off, not being able to continue. The memories were just too strong.</p><p>Tony was started by Peter moving on the couch to sit closer to his mentor, his small frame providing an insurmountable amount of comfort to the mechanic as Tony wrapped his arm around his kid and held him close.</p><p>&ldquo;It was a young girl,&rdquo; Tony found the strength to continue, though he knew that when he finished, Peter would never look at him the same way. He guessed it was for the best, though - Tony needed to put as much distance between the two of them as possible. As much as he loved the kid, If he continued to hang around Tony, he would get hurt, or worse. The story just helped prove that.</p><p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t have been older than five. And you want to hear what she said to bring the gunman&rsquo;s attention to her?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony blinked the tears from his eyes as the words, the voice, replayed themselves in his mind, clear as day. They were the sounds that had haunted him for the longest time, and would continue to until - well, Tony didn&rsquo;t know how long it would be until he forgot. Maybe never. And honestly, he didn&rsquo;t even know if he <i>wanted </i>to forget. He was responsible for that girl&rsquo;s death. He had no right to a clear conscience.</p><p>&ldquo;She said, &lsquo;Look, mom, it&rsquo;s Iron Man. He&rsquo;ll save us.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>Tony felt Peter tense in his side but tried to cherish the feeling of his kid leaning against him, realizing it might be the last time Peter would ever want to be close to him.</p><p><i>Seems about right</i>, he thought as he hastily wiped away a tear he hadn&rsquo;t even realized had fallen. <i>Now Peter realizes what a monster I am. I&rsquo;m not a hero, I&rsquo;m-</i></p><p>Suddenly, Peter was wrapping his arms around his mentor, resting his chin on his shoulder as Tony looked down at him in surprise.</p><p>&ldquo;Kid, what-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not your fault.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony stared down at the matted curls of his kid incredulously. Why was Peter hugging him? He had killed a five-year-old-</p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t kill her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Geez</i>, kid, can you read minds or something?&rdquo; Tony gasped, but Peter just held him tighter. Tony rested a light hand on Peter&rsquo;s head, fingers threading through his soft curls.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you aim the gun at her?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony chuckled at the irony and couldn&rsquo;t held smiling at how <i>selfless </i>the kid was.</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did you pull the trigger?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, kid.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Did </i>you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter sat back up like that decided it.</p><p>&ldquo;Then you didn&rsquo;t kill her.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony sighed quietly as he leaned back into the couch cushions.</p><p>&ldquo;Still hurts.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter mirrored his position.</p><p>&ldquo;So this feeling will never go away, then?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony turned his gaze to the kid and saw his brown eyes looking back sadly. Tony shook his head slightly.</p><p>&ldquo;No, but you can try to move on.&rdquo; He spoke stronger, as if he really believed in what he was saying. For Peter&rsquo;s sake, at least. &ldquo;Try to continue saving people. Being a hero isn&rsquo;t the mistakes you didn&rsquo;t make; it&rsquo;s coming back from the ones you did.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter smiled then, but Tony could still see the brokenness behind it. He figured he would for a while. He would help him, though. He would save Peter, help him get back on his feet.</p><p>And he would never leave him. No, Peter was his kid.</p><p>Maybe that was selfish. Maybe Tony&rsquo;s self-destructive tendencies would rub off on the kid - maybe something worse would. Tony didn&rsquo;t care.</p><p>Peter was his kid, and Tony would never leave him.</p></p>",

That\u2019s fine,\u201d Tony replied, actually looking up at the boy this time and smiling, asking, \u201cYou headed to bed now, bud?\u201d </p><p>Peter nodded and hummed, smiling when Steve exclaimed, \u201cNot without telling me goodnight!\u201d</p><p>He walked over to the man and fell into his open arms, hugging him, before doing the same to Bucky and Natasha, who had equal soft spots for the kid.

The usual?\u201d</p><p><i>Click. Shift.</i></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll actually start today off with some coffee, if that\u2019s okay, Y/N,\u201d Matt said kindly, turning his head in the general direction where you stood.\u00a0</p><p>You were quick to scribble on the server pad before smiling, drawing a small symbol at the top of the ticket that you <i>insisted</i> on using whenever the Lawyers of Hell\u2019s Kitchen came in.</p><p>\u201cOf course! I\u2019ll be back with some mugs.\u201d</p><p>You were quick to get the three mugs and place them in front of Karen, Matt, and Foggy before filling them up three-quarters of the way before carefully sliding the creamer cups and sugar up a bit closer to their hands so Matt didn\u2019t have to feel around or get directed by Karen and Foggy too much.</p><p>\u201cCreamer\u2019s on your left, sugar\u2019s closer to the right. I\u2019ll check back in with you in a bit to see if you\u2019re wanting anything else, alright?\u201d You said kindly, your smile growing as they thank you as if you\u2019ve just given them water after walking through a desert.</p><p>You\u2019re in the middle of placing the coffee pot on the dock when the bell to the diner rang and someone sat at the breakfast bar, that was also sadly your turn to serve until your break.</p><p>\u201cHi, welcome to The Square Diner, what can I get you?\u201d You said as you turned around, only to almost freeze in your place.</p><p>It was <i>her</i>. The girl Peter was with <i>that</i> night.</p><p>Who said that this could happen? <i>In all the places of New York-</i></p><p>\u201cHello! Uh, I\u2019ll just take a coffee for right now, thank you.\u201d</p><p><i>Inhale. Force Smile. Turn.</i></p><p>You grabbed a mug from the small rack in the corner of the counter behind the bar, quick to place it in front of her as she read the menu and grab the coffee pot to fill it three-quarters of the way.</p><p>\u201cLet me know if I can get you anything, alright?\u201d You forced your smile to look more authentic.</p><p>The girl smiled and nodded as she looked at the menu.</p><p>You let your smile fall quickly after you placed the pot back on the dock and went back to Karen, Matt, and Foggy\u2019s booth.</p><p>\u201cHave we decided on what to order for your late breakfast?\u201d You questioned, letting a small smile come up as you held your serving pad and pen in hand again.</p><p><i>Click. Shift. Clear throat.</i></p><p>You were quick to write down their orders and relay them to the cooks before you were practically forced to turn your attention to her.</p><p>\u201cHave you decided on anything, ma\u2019am?\u201d You asked.</p><p>Wow, she <i>really</i> brings out the customer service voice out of you.</p><p>\u201cOh, um, yeah, I\u2019d like..\u201d She started, trailing off slightly as you quickly got your pad ready to write her order on a new page before she spoke up, looking at your face. \u201cYou look familiar..\u201d</p><p><i>Oh no. No, no no no.</i></p><p>\u201cI work here as often as I can between classes-\u201d You offered before she cut you off, her face lighting up.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the girl that Peter ran after in the store the other night!\u201d She exclaimed, seeming genuinely happy to actually meet you. You wish you felt the same, but something in you just wouldn\u2019t let that happen.</p><p>\u201cOh- Uh, yeah. <i>Hi.</i>\u201d</p><p><i>Shift. Click. Inhale. Force Wider Smile.</i></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re- you\u2019re Y/N right? Peter\u2019s friend?\u201d</p><p>A friend? <i>Friend?</i></p><p>\u201cYeah, I am,\u201d You gritted out with your best tone possible that wouldn\u2019t get you fired. You moved your pen to your hand that held the pad and held it out. \u201cAnd you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmily.\u201d Her hand was weirdly soft and not at all cold in your hand as you briefly shook hands.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, Emily. Glad to put a name to the face.\u201d</p><p>You wish it was your face that was kissed at the store that night.</p><p>\u201cSame here! I\u2019ll tell you my order super quick and I\u2019ll let you get your orders, I\u2019m <i>so</i> sorry for keeping you!\u201d</p><p>You didn\u2019t get what she meant until you glanced over your shoulder to see the food for the only booth you have. Oh.</p><p>Quickly you wrote her order and slid it to the cooks before piling the hot plates on your arms with ease, moving over gracefully to the booth the group sat at.</p><p>You really wish waitressing was an olympic sport, you\u2019d get the gold.</p><p>You laid the dishes in front of Foggy, Karen, and Matt respectively and asked if they needed anything else.</p><p>After that point, your day got a little easier.</p><p>The Lawyers of Hell\u2019s Kitchen left right as the diner picked up for the lunch rush, leaving you a nice tip between the three, and plans to swing by their office to get a look at some cases you could go and try to help them with.</p><p>Emily was seeming to be nice, which made you swallow your pride and try to push back that she\u2019s your ex\u2019s new girl.</p><p>She seemed sweet, kinda like the Snickers you devoured during your show\u2019s rerun that night.</p><p>But your mind wouldn\u2019t leave it at that. You kept replaying how she and Peter had kissed at the store and your sadness came back that you shook off over 48 hours ago.</p><p>It was <i>agitating</i>. </p><p>You didn\u2019t have any choice to run. No choice to hide from it.</p><p>It really made you want to swan dive into the oil of the deep fryer in the kitchen during your break.</p><p>However, that was avoided.</p><p><i>Barely</i>.</p><p>You were talking with one of the cooks, trying to get yourself into higher spirits when you were both on your breaks, Emily still at the breakfast bar as she ate her food.</p><p>It was all silent. </p><p>Until you heard what sounded like a gun cocking, and someone screaming as if they were in a horror film, about to get murdered.</p>",

I&rsquo;ll be back with some mugs.&rdquo;</p><p>You were quick to get the three mugs and place them in front of Karen, Matt, and Foggy before filling them up three-quarters of the way before carefully sliding the creamer cups and sugar up a bit closer to their hands so Matt didn&rsquo;t have to feel around or get directed by Karen and Foggy too much.</p><p>&ldquo;Creamer&rsquo;s on your left, sugar&rsquo;s closer to the right. I&rsquo;ll check back in with you in a bit to see if you&rsquo;re wanting anything else, alright?&rdquo; You said kindly, your smile growing as they thank you as if you&rsquo;ve just given them water after walking through a desert.</p><p>You&rsquo;re in the middle of placing the coffee pot on the dock when the bell to the diner rang and someone sat at the breakfast bar, that was also sadly your turn to serve until your break.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi, welcome to The Square Diner, what can I get you?&rdquo; You said as you turned around, only to almost freeze in your place.</p><p>It was <i>her</i>. The girl Peter was with <i>that</i> night.</p><p>Who said that this could happen? <i>In all the places of New York-</i></p><p>&ldquo;Hello! Uh, I&rsquo;ll just take a coffee for right now, thank you.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Inhale. Force Smile. Turn.</i></p><p>You grabbed a mug from the small rack in the corner of the counter behind the bar, quick to place it in front of her as she read the menu and grab the coffee pot to fill it three-quarters of the way.</p><p>&ldquo;Let me know if I can get you anything, alright?&rdquo; You forced your smile to look more authentic.</p><p>The girl smiled and nodded as she looked at the menu.</p><p>You let your smile fall quickly after you placed the pot back on the dock and went back to Karen, Matt, and Foggy&rsquo;s booth.</p><p>&ldquo;Have we decided on what to order for your late breakfast?&rdquo; You questioned, letting a small smile come up as you held your serving pad and pen in hand again.</p><p><i>Click. Shift. Clear throat.</i></p><p>You were quick to write down their orders and relay them to the cooks before you were practically forced to turn your attention to her.</p><p>&ldquo;Have you decided on anything, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; You asked.</p><p>Wow, she <i>really</i> brings out the customer service voice out of you.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, um, yeah, I&rsquo;d like..&rdquo; She started, trailing off slightly as you quickly got your pad ready to write her order on a new page before she spoke up, looking at your face. &ldquo;You look familiar..&rdquo;</p><p><i>Oh no. No, no no no.</i></p><p>&ldquo;I work here as often as I can between classes-&rdquo; You offered before she cut you off, her face lighting up.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the girl that Peter ran after in the store the other night!&rdquo; She exclaimed, seeming genuinely happy to actually meet you. You wish you felt the same, but something in you just wouldn&rsquo;t let that happen.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh- Uh, yeah. <i>Hi.</i>&rdquo;</p><p><i>Shift. Click. Inhale. Force Wider Smile.</i></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re- you&rsquo;re Y/N right? Peter&rsquo;s friend?&rdquo;</p><p>A friend? <i>Friend?</i></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I am,&rdquo; You gritted out with your best tone possible that wouldn&rsquo;t get you fired. You moved your pen to your hand that held the pad and held it out. &ldquo;And you are?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Emily.&rdquo; Her hand was weirdly soft and not at all cold in your hand as you briefly shook hands.</p><p>&ldquo;Nice to meet you, Emily. Glad to put a name to the face.&rdquo;</p><p>You wish it was your face that was kissed at the store that night.</p><p>&ldquo;Same here! I&rsquo;ll tell you my order super quick and I&rsquo;ll let you get your orders, I&rsquo;m <i>so</i> sorry for keeping you!&rdquo;</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t get what she meant until you glanced over your shoulder to see the food for the only booth you have. Oh.</p><p>Quickly you wrote her order and slid it to the cooks before piling the hot plates on your arms with ease, moving over gracefully to the booth the group sat at.</p><p>You really wish waitressing was an olympic sport, you&rsquo;d get the gold.</p><p>You laid the dishes in front of Foggy, Karen, and Matt respectively and asked if they needed anything else.</p><p>After that point, your day got a little easier.</p><p>The Lawyers of Hell&rsquo;s Kitchen left right as the diner picked up for the lunch rush, leaving you a nice tip between the three, and plans to swing by their office to get a look at some cases you could go and try to help them with.</p><p>Emily was seeming to be nice, which made you swallow your pride and try to push back that she&rsquo;s your ex&rsquo;s new girl.</p><p>She seemed sweet, kinda like the Snickers you devoured during your show&rsquo;s rerun that night.</p><p>But your mind wouldn&rsquo;t leave it at that. You kept replaying how she and Peter had kissed at the store and your sadness came back that you shook off over 48 hours ago.</p><p>It was <i>agitating</i>. </p><p>You didn&rsquo;t have any choice to run. No choice to hide from it.</p><p>It really made you want to swan dive into the oil of the deep fryer in the kitchen during your break.</p><p>However, that was avoided.</p><p><i>Barely</i>.</p><p>You were talking with one of the cooks, trying to get yourself into higher spirits when you were both on your breaks, Emily still at the breakfast bar as she ate her food.</p><p>It was all silent. </p><p>Until you heard what sounded like a gun cocking, and someone screaming as if they were in a horror film, about to get murdered.</p>",

Composed of not-quite blood relatives but family all the same; all of them alight with inexplicable joy on a day nearly everyone had been betting on since Peter&rsquo;s sophomore year at Midtown when he bumped into the best thing to ever happen to him-and spilled her physics homework all over the hall.</p><p>He was nervous, to say the least. His clammy palms and bouncing heels were proof enough. Even Ned was beginning to get a bit exasperated at how frequently Peter would ask the time or try to run a hand through his carefully done hair,promptly ruining all the hard work May had done that morning to try and tame his wild curls.</p><p>Peter knew in his deepest sense that things would be alright. Even if he stuttered the entire way through his vows, and dropped the ring and fumbled over the steps down the stairs. At the end of it all they would still be lovesick messes and exchange breathless laughter between curved-lip kisses.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n<p>That didn&rsquo;t stop him from nearly jumping out of his tux when the massive chapel doors heave open with a labored groan. The sound seems to reverberate through the hollows of his lungs, filling them to the brim with a familiar too-full ache. That&rsquo;s how he always feels when she&rsquo;s around. Too full. As if there&rsquo;s only so much space in his body available to contain the amount of love and adoration he holds for her. Something so immeasurable and indescribable couldn&rsquo;t so easily be held in the confines of Peter&rsquo;s heart.</p><p>So it presses against the walls of his lungs and curves of his ribs, making his jaw go slack and eyes water when they land on her figure at the foot of the walkway. He can barely get enough oxygen in his lungs to laugh at himself, feeling a bit unsteady on his own two feet as he drinks in the image of her donned in white and glowing with the radiance of-</p><p><i><b>to have and to hold</b></i></p><p>&ldquo;Sirius,&rdquo; she states quietly, Peter&rsquo;s gaze following the tip of her finger to the pinprick of light only fully visible through the massive telescope they&rsquo;d both been stealing glances from (along with a few directed towards each other) throughout the night.</p><p>&ldquo;Like, from Harry Potter?&rdquo; She let out a soft laugh at his inquiry, the sound making Peter&rsquo;s heart thump a bit faster and his lips press together in a sheepish smile. It was a nice sound to hear. Mellow, sincere, and just bubbly enough to coax a small, breathless snicker from himself as well. </p><p>He noticed just before she ducked her head down in a bashful smile that her eyes seemed to glint with a different kind of light than they did during the hustle and bustle of the school days. A bit more real,a bit more raw. He supposed something about having the whole of the galaxy mapped out before you did that to a person. But maybe he just saw the reflection of Canopus in the sea of her irises.</p><p>Sure, her heart would skip a beat nearly every time she caught Peter staring at her after she&rsquo;d come back from peering through the telescope. And she felt the world wobble beneath her feet a bit when his hand brushed against hers while adjusting the focus. But at the moment they were simply a pair of over-enthusiastic teens gawking at the intricately woven constellations hung up well above the light pollution of a never-sleeping city.</p><p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; She lifts her head back up, a faint ghost of a smile still visible in the curve of her cheeks. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the brightest one we&rsquo;ve found yet. Just along Orion&rsquo;s belt,&rdquo; she traces out the contours of the asterism, fixating once again on the star in question.</p><p>Peter nods, unable to keep the smile from his face as she continues to muse about the various shapes, sizes, and stories drawn across the night sky. She looked nothing short of breathtaking like this. Peter couldn&rsquo;t get enough of the wonderstruck brilliance that she radiated while explaining every small detail and facet of the celestial wonders beheld to him. He never dreamt he&rsquo;d be close enough to a star to feel the nuclear fusion tingling at his fingertips.</p><p><i><b>from this day forward</b></i></p><p>She had promised herself she wouldn&rsquo;t. She knew it was ridiculous and completely naive of her to be indulging in ideas like that. She knew better and she&rsquo;d be lying if she said it wasn&rsquo;t getting rather irritating trying to run from what she felt for Peter.</p><p>She hadn&rsquo;t seen it coming. It was supposed to be just another normal day. Normal being a relative term considering her life had been turned upside down since that first night with Peter at the observatory almost seven months ago. </p><p>It was impossibly wonderful and painfully new for her. Having somebody as thoughtful, understanding, and genuine as Peter wasn&rsquo;t something she was used to. And while he was nothing short of amazing to her, and she adored every minute she got to spend with him-there was a sense of unshakable vulnerability that she still had yet to fully accept.</p><p>So when he texted her amidst the hectic buzz of her Monday morning with a new picture of that dawn\u2019s sunrise-she found herself typing out a response without a second thought. The grin was still on her face as she pressed send, not even realizing that she&rsquo;d just taken a massive leap and would soon be feeling the effects of a nosedive into the deep end.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god,&rdquo; she breathed,heart skipping a beat as she read the text a second, third, and fourth time.</p><p><i>&lsquo;God,I love you,Parker,&rsquo; </i></p><p>&ldquo;Shit, Shit, Shit,&rdquo; she muttered under her breath, tugging a hand through her barely brushed mass of bedhead and shoving the phone across the kitchen counter before beginning to pace wildly about the room. Her stomach was churning and head was spinning with all the possibilities of how this could end- none of them being positive of course.</p><p>After what feels like ages of stumbling about the chilled tile, she braved a glance back at her phone.Her heart dropped straight to her socks.</p><p><i>'Read: 6:15&rsquo;</i></p><p>She felt her throat begin to close up and top row of teeth come down harshly on her bottom lip, gnawing vainly to try and diffuse the terror spreading through her veins like ice water. Just when she thought she might be sick from the wait, a loud crash from her front balcony sends the young girl straight into a whole other panic.</p><p>Her breath hitched and eyes went wide,fixating on the figure strewn across the concrete floor, leg entangled in a lawn chair and kicking helplessly to try and escape it.</p><p>&ldquo;What the fu-&rdquo; she can&rsquo;t finish her sentence before she&rsquo;s at the pair of glass doors and Peter&rsquo;s flushed face lifted to meet her gaze, still lowered onto the floor where he&rsquo;s splayed out and ensnared by her mother&rsquo;s favorite lounging seat. Finally,he managed to struggle free from the confines and onto his feet, chest heaving and hair still fluffed about in a clearly slept on fashion.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; She exclaimed, absolutely awestruck as she pulled back the door to stare at him with parted lips and furrowed brows. &ldquo;How did you even get here I live two blocks away-&rdquo; Peter didn&rsquo;t even let her finish the sentence before letting his backpack slip off his shoulders and feet carry him straight to her incredulous person.</p><p>She didn&rsquo;t have the time to register him lifting his hands to cup her face before their lips had already met, his own gentle yet insistent as he held her as close as possible. He could hear both of their hearts hammering against the cage of their ribs and feel her feather light touches shock his skin like lightning bolts. He was so caught up in the moment that he almost forgot to breathe until his lungs began to burn.</p><p>Nothing but the heavy gasps of the pair filled the space between them for a moment, eyes wide and searching eachother&rsquo;s for any sign of just what the hell might be going on. &ldquo;I wanted to tell you in person,&rdquo; he murmured, cheeks burning and hands lowering back to her own. They were shaking furiously as he took hold of her palms, which began to tremble as well as soon as they connected.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; She asked, completely dumbfounded and having forgotten just what she was so distraught about as soon as Peter had kissed her. He pressed his lips together like he always did when he&rsquo;s anxious,working the bottom one between his teeth as Peter attempted to pluck up the courage to get the words past the hollow of his throat.</p><p>&ldquo;I,&rdquo; He inhaled, running his thumbs over the backs of her knuckles in a desperate effort to ground himself. &ldquo;I love you too,&rdquo; his eyes only dare lift up to hers for a moment, flickering around her face to try and gather any sign of recognition that he could. When her eyes start to gloss over, he thinks the worst.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh god I didn&rsquo;t mean to-&rdquo; She practically throws herself onto him, arms wrapping around his neck as she pulls his frame flush against her own. Peter can feel her shoulders shake with a small, watered down laugh, hands gripping the fabric of his hoodie like a lifeline. He quickly wraps his arms around her middle to return the gesture. Peter\u2019s heart began to even out its pace, and they both just stood there for a moment, trying to figure out how they got so lucky. </p><p>She hadn&rsquo;t been sure before. Whether things with Peter would work or not. Whether she could keep counting the days until things inevitably crashed and burned for the pair of them. But at the moment, all she needed was his arms round her waist and nose against her temple, soft utterances of the phrase passing freely between the both of them.</p><p>When she lifted her head from his shoulder, her eyes catch on the deep red and blue fabric spilling from the top of Peter&rsquo;s backpack, which still laid carelessly dropped on her balcony.  She pulled back a moment,brows furrowed and lips curled just the slightest. &ldquo;Peter?&rdquo; She fought down a light laugh, her boyfriend stirring from his moonstruck daze only to appreciate her smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why do you have a morphsuit in your backpack?&rdquo;</p><p><i><b>for better or for worse</b></i></p><p>&ldquo;Do you even <b>care</b>?&rdquo; the words clawed past the minuscule passage of her throat and tore through her teeth like bullets from the barrel of a gun. They hit Peter head on. Straight in the hollow of his chest where he presumed his heart was intended to reside. But at the moment it had just felt like somebody replaced it with a bundle of barbed wire; prodding  and poking at all the bruises littered across his chest and scraping the sides of his lungs so air could only leak out like that from a punctured balloon.</p><p>The wounds hidden beneath this sweatshirt felt measly in comparison to seeing her like that. All pursed lips and red rimmed eyes. Her whitened knuckles were curled around the massive binder clutched close to her chest, where he was meant to be. Instead it felt like they were universes apart, Peter just now coming to the realization that there was no oxygen in the vast emptiness of space.</p><p>He sputtered, absolutely perturbed that she would even ask a question like that. <i>Of course</i> he cared. He cared so much that he felt he might burst at the seams some days. But maybe today it was more than a feeling. He could sense himself crumbling as he struggled to get the words out, falling short when her eyes began to water. &ldquo;What do you mean?!Of course I care about you-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not me-this isn&rsquo;t about me,Peter,&rdquo; she said sharply, words having an effect all too similar to the shrapnel that had gotten lodged in his stomach the night before. &ldquo;This is about <i><b>you</b></i>- you throwing yourself into danger at the smallest sign of it and not even <i><b>thinking</b></i> about what could happen. You could have-&rdquo; her voice was the one to fail her that time, splintering beneath the pressure in her lungs and dropping to the scuffed tile floor in shards. </p><p>For the first time since he&rsquo;d met her, the thought crosses Peter&rsquo;s mind that maybe it would have been better if he hadn&rsquo;t.</p><p><i><b>for richer or for poorer</b></i></p><p>&ldquo;Peter, oh my god I was just kidding you really don&rsquo;t have to,&rdquo; she could barely contain her giggles as she braced one hand on his hunched shoulder and the other on the smudged glass of the arcade game window. Peter found this all the more distracting, and only slightly irritating since her laugh and gentle touch threw off his skill completely. So of course, whenever he tilted his head to share a lopsided smile with her, the machine instantly whirred with a sickenly familiar sound to remind him he&rsquo;d run out of time. </p><p>His face fell into a defeated frown, her own still aglow in the neon lights as she tried to coax him to try out another game with her. But Peter Parker was a stubborn little shit when it came to making his girlfriend happy. So if he had to take out a loan to get that damn Spider-Man plushie, you&rsquo;d best believe he would.</p><p>Without a single moment&rsquo;s hesitation, Peter took her hand in his and dragged the pair of them back to the token machine with a twenty curled in his other palm. &ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; she tried to suppress her laughter long enough to get him to reconsider spending his life savings on a rigged claw machine. Needless to say-it did not work. </p><p>Within thirty seconds they were practically sprinting back across the funky printed carpet to the games, since Peter was completely sure that if they waited a moment longer that somebody would come steal that toy along with his girlfriend as well.</p><p>Eleven tries and eleven defeats later, she finally managed to get Peter to step away from his newfound nemesis and quite possibly the toughest criminal he&rsquo;d faced in all of Queens. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you let me give it a try?&rdquo; She wrapped her arms around his waist, peering over his shoulder into the pile of stuffed animals with an amused smirk still digging into her cheeks. With a sheepish smile, Peter plucked his last pair of tokens from his pocket. He slipped them into the coin slot before swapping positions with her and settling one of his hands atop hers that had gripped the toggle and button. </p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t get to take the credit for my win just because you held my hand,Parker,&rdquo; She taunted lightly, trying not to let the feeling on his chin rested atop her head and warm chest pressed against her back get the best of her. She almost dropped the claw accidentally when it rumbled with a soft chuckle, Peter watching on eagerly as she guided it to the perfect spot.</p><p>&ldquo;yes! oh my god!&rdquo; She fell back into his grip with a grin on her face and laughter bubbling from her lungs. Peter stared in complete shock as the claw dropped the small plush down the hatch with supernatural ease. He reluctantly released her from his arms to let her crouch down and collect the prize, lips parted and eyes the size of saucers.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe that,&rdquo; Peter shook his head lightly, still smiling enough to let her know she hadn&rsquo;t completely demolished his pride with her immaculate claw machine prowess. She just continued to laugh, using one hand to hold her newest treasure and the other to link with Peter&rsquo;s. </p><p>&ldquo;You ready for lunch?Unless you went broke trying to free Spider-Man Junior here, that is,&rdquo; her eyes twinkled and Peter flushed lightly, the shade deepening when he fished through his pockets and came up empty. &ldquo;Oh my god you actually did,&rdquo; she declared, snickering helplessly as she fell into Peter and kissed his heated cheek affectionately while he fumbled for an explanation.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry I-&rdquo; the look on her face was enough to quiet Peter and still his racing heart. It wasn\u2019t irritable or embarrassed or awkward. It was perfectly content and maybe a little bit entertained. She would have expected nothing less from Peter and found he rose to the title of dorkiest, sweetest boyfriend ever quite well in that particular moment. </p><p>So that time she was the one to pull out her wallet, brushing off Peter&rsquo;s objections with a light squeeze of his hand and easygoing mention of the new cafe opened down the street. With a rueful chuckle Peter followed her to the door, giving one last nod to the brightly colored kids menu displayed overhead. </p><p>&ldquo;You mean you&rsquo;re <i>sure</i> you don&rsquo;t want the five dollar family pizza?&rdquo; </p><p><i><b>In sickness and in health</b></i></p><p>&ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; she croaked whiningly, burying further under the quilts piled atop her bed while the brunett beside it desperately tried to get her to wake without drop kicking him with a Thor slipper still on her foot.</p><p>&ldquo;C'mon babe, you gotta take your antibiotic,&rdquo; he gingerly tried to peel back the duvet, being greeted with her mess of a self glaring at him through half lidded eyes and a curtain of her hair she couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to push back. Huffing irritably, she heaved herself into a sitting position and leant against the headboard for support, combing through her bird&rsquo;s nest of an updo that had been tossed about in her sleep.</p><p>Peter patiently reached over to the nightstand and held out a small glass along with her medications in each hand, helping to hold up the cup when necessary since her grip was even shakier than usual. She wiped the corner of her lip groggily, staring at Peter with that same look she always had when he was being far too sweet with her and she wanted to be mad but couldn&rsquo;t bring herself to put the energy into it.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not supposed to be here,&rdquo; She grumbled, leaning forward to rest her head on his shoulder nonetheless. She felt it shake slightly with a short laugh,his fingertips running through her hair to carefully thread through the knots she had missed.</p><p>Last time she&rsquo;d been awake, it was right after school and Peter had come bustling in with her favorite movies and tea bags in tow. Even after several minutes of trying to convince him to go home and preserve his health while he could, Peter obviously wasn&rsquo;t going to budge. So she had grudgingly flopped back onto her mattress and made small talk with him until her pills kicked in and made her a drowsy, incoherent mess. And of course Peter couldn&rsquo;t take her seriously when she had demanded he not be here when she wake up; wagging her finger in the air with a cheek squished against her pillow and a well loved Spider-Man plushie in the crook of her arm.</p><p>&ldquo;You mean you aren&rsquo;t glad to see me?&rdquo; He teased lightly, smoothing his hand down from the back of her neck to the base of her spine and rubbing soothing patterns into it. Her indignant huff was enough of an answer to have Peter grinning. </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be stupid,&rdquo; she began to play with his fingers like a small child, eventually lacing them with her own. &ldquo;'Course I&rsquo;m happy to see you.&rdquo; Her words were still a bit slurred from sleep, and halfway muffled by the fabric of Peter&rsquo;s hoodie. So he had a difficult time continuing to contain his laughter when she pressed a small, clumsy kiss to the neckline of his t-shirt and carelessly dropped back onto the bed with a pitiful sigh.</p><p>&ldquo;S'there anything I can do for you, beautiful?&rdquo; He hummed, trying to brush away the strands of her hair that had strewn back across her face when she flopped into the comfort of her pillows. She let out a dry snicker at his choice of words. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,I&rsquo;m sure i&rsquo;m looking stunning at the moment,&rdquo; her words were dripping in sarcasm but the way she leans into Peter&rsquo;s touch was all too genuine for him to even think of rolling his eyes. Instead he nodded as if the irony wasn&rsquo;t even present in her tone, eyes full of adoration as he ran a thumb over her cheek. She laughed again at this, but the sound is a bit gentler, a bit more true. &ldquo;Thank you Peter,&rdquo; she sighed, drawing his hand down from her face and to clasp with her own.</p><p>Only moments later, an older woman with worry and smile lines alike came scurrying into the room, face warming into a smile at the sight laid out in her daughter&rsquo;s bedroom while she sets down her bags. &ldquo;Thank you so much, Peter. I don&rsquo;t know how you get her to be so sweet with you. Usually by now I would have been kicked out to the living room,&rdquo; the woman teased, coming to kiss her daughter&rsquo;s forehead and beam at the boy that had managed to tame her obstinate spirit.</p><p>&ldquo;Not a problem at all,&rdquo; Peter exchanged a genuine smile with the both of them before her mother began rambling about how late it had gotten and if Peter needed a ride home. &ldquo;No,no,it&rsquo;s alright. My car&rsquo;s out front. But are you sure I don&rsquo;t need to stay?if you&rsquo;ve still got work I can keep this one company,&rdquo; He nudged her thigh with a playful grin, only getting a roll of her tired eyes in response as she tugged the blankets back up to her chin.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh don&rsquo;t worry about it,sweetie.I think I can handle it from here,&rdquo; The older woman assured Peter, ushering him up and to the door so he wouldn&rsquo;t be getting home at too ungodly of an hour. But just as the pair of them got to the door and Peter blew a dramatic kiss goodbye, Her voice rose from the blankets in a final solemn request.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; the boy whipped around so fast he would probably have whiplash for the next week, brows raised and feet ready to head wherever she required. But she only reached out her hands from beneath the duvet, making a childish grabbing motion that spread a grin onto Peter&rsquo;s lips immediately.</p><p>&ldquo;Leave the hoodie,&rdquo;</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Till death do us part</b></i>&rdquo;</p><p>Peter didn&rsquo;t even have the thought to wait until he was permitted to kiss his wife. They were already in each other&rsquo;s arms, glossy eyed and smiling a bit too hard for their lips to meet properly. There was laughter and cheering and quite possibly a clap of thunder a few miles away, even though the sky was crystal clear and void of a single rain cloud. </p><p>They share a small snicker as they part, eyes wide with wonder and surprise that even the godly branch of Peter&rsquo;s family had made the effort to celebrate on such an important day. But it seemed that the lord of thunder wasn&rsquo;t the only one present, but his brother as well. At least, that&rsquo;s who Peter blames when he sent the pair of them tripping down the stair steps on the way out, headed towards their new life together with hearty laughter and curved lipped kisses, just as predicted.</p>",

With the pristine light of early morning rays filtering through ornately designed windows, arcing above their heads and set in aged but intricately carved stone. A sea of familiar, beaming faces sitting in the pews. Composed of not-quite blood relatives but family all the same; all of them alight with inexplicable joy on a day nearly everyone had been betting on since Peter\u2019s sophomore year at Midtown when he bumped into the best thing to ever happen to him-and spilled her physics homework all over the hall.</p><p>He was nervous, to say the least. His clammy palms and bouncing heels were proof enough. Even Ned was beginning to get a bit exasperated at how frequently Peter would ask the time or try to run a hand through his carefully done hair,promptly ruining all the hard work May had done that morning to try and tame his wild curls.</p><p>Peter knew in his deepest sense that things would be alright.

The sound seems to reverberate through the hollows of his lungs, filling them to the brim with a familiar too-full ache. That\u2019s how he always feels when she\u2019s around. Too full. As if there\u2019s only so much space in his body available to contain the amount of love and adoration he holds for her. Something so immeasurable and indescribable couldn\u2019t so easily be held in the confines of Peter\u2019s heart.</p><p>So it presses against the walls of his lungs and curves of his ribs, making his jaw go slack and eyes water when they land on her figure at the foot of the walkway. He can barely get enough oxygen in his lungs to laugh at himself, feeling a bit unsteady on his own two feet as he drinks in the image of her donned in white and glowing with the radiance of-</p><p><i><b>to have and to hold</b></i></p><p>\u201cSirius,\u201d she states quietly, Peter\u2019s gaze following the tip of her finger to the pinprick of light only fully visible through the massive telescope they\u2019d both been stealing glances from (along with a few directed towards each other) throughout the night.</p><p>\u201cLike, from Harry Potter?\u201d She let out a soft laugh at his inquiry, the sound making Peter\u2019s heart thump a bit faster and his lips press together in a sheepish smile. It was a nice sound to hear. Mellow, sincere, and just bubbly enough to coax a small, breathless snicker from himself as well. </p><p>He noticed just before she ducked her head down in a bashful smile that her eyes seemed to glint with a different kind of light than they did during the hustle and bustle of the school days. A bit more real,a bit more raw. He supposed something about having the whole of the galaxy mapped out before you did that to a person. But maybe he just saw the reflection of Canopus in the sea of her irises.</p><p>Sure, her heart would skip a beat nearly every time she caught Peter staring at her after she\u2019d come back from peering through the telescope. And she felt the world wobble beneath her feet a bit when his hand brushed against hers while adjusting the focus. But at the moment they were simply a pair of over-enthusiastic teens gawking at the intricately woven constellations hung up well above the light pollution of a never-sleeping city.</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d She lifts her head back up, a faint ghost of a smile still visible in the curve of her cheeks. \u201cIt\u2019s the brightest one we\u2019ve found yet. Just along Orion\u2019s belt,\u201d she traces out the contours of the asterism, fixating once again on the star in question.</p><p>Peter nods, unable to keep the smile from his face as she continues to muse about the various shapes, sizes, and stories drawn across the night sky. She looked nothing short of breathtaking like this. Peter couldn\u2019t get enough of the wonderstruck brilliance that she radiated while explaining every small detail and facet of the celestial wonders beheld to him. He never dreamt he\u2019d be close enough to a star to feel the nuclear fusion tingling at his fingertips.</p><p><i><b>from this day forward</b></i></p><p>She had promised herself she wouldn\u2019t. She knew it was ridiculous and completely naive of her to be indulging in ideas like that. She knew better and she\u2019d be lying if she said it wasn\u2019t getting rather irritating trying to run from what she felt for Peter.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t seen it coming. It was supposed to be just another normal day. Normal being a relative term considering her life had been turned upside down since that first night with Peter at the observatory almost seven months ago. </p><p>It was impossibly wonderful and painfully new for her. Having somebody as thoughtful, understanding, and genuine as Peter wasn\u2019t something she was used to. And while he was nothing short of amazing to her, and she adored every minute she got to spend with him-there was a sense of unshakable vulnerability that she still had yet to fully accept.</p><p>So when he texted her amidst the hectic buzz of her Monday morning with a new picture of that dawn\u2019s sunrise-she found herself typing out a response without a second thought. The grin was still on her face as she pressed send, not even realizing that she\u2019d just taken a massive leap and would soon be feeling the effects of a nosedive into the deep end.</p><p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d she breathed,heart skipping a beat as she read the text a second, third, and fourth time.</p><p><i>\u2018God,I love you,Parker,\u2019 </i></p><p>\u201cShit, Shit, Shit,\u201d she muttered under her breath, tugging a hand through her barely brushed mass of bedhead and shoving the phone across the kitchen counter before beginning to pace wildly about the room. Her stomach was churning and head was spinning with all the possibilities of how this could end- none of them being positive of course.</p><p>After what feels like ages of stumbling about the chilled tile, she braved a glance back at her phone.Her heart dropped straight to her socks.</p><p><i>'Read: 6:15\u2019</i></p><p>She felt her throat begin to close up and top row of teeth come down harshly on her bottom lip, gnawing vainly to try and diffuse the terror spreading through her veins like ice water. Just when she thought she might be sick from the wait, a loud crash from her front balcony sends the young girl straight into a whole other panic.</p><p>Her breath hitched and eyes went wide,fixating on the figure strewn across the concrete floor, leg entangled in a lawn chair and kicking helplessly to try and escape it.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fu-\u201d she can\u2019t finish her sentence before she\u2019s at the pair of glass doors and Peter\u2019s flushed face lifted to meet her gaze, still lowered onto the floor where he\u2019s splayed out and ensnared by her mother\u2019s favorite lounging seat. Finally,he managed to struggle free from the confines and onto his feet, chest heaving and hair still fluffed about in a clearly slept on fashion.</p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d She exclaimed, absolutely awestruck as she pulled back the door to stare at him with parted lips and furrowed brows. \u201cHow did you even get here I live two blocks away-\u201d Peter didn\u2019t even let her finish the sentence before letting his backpack slip off his shoulders and feet carry him straight to her incredulous person.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have the time to register him lifting his hands to cup her face before their lips had already met, his own gentle yet insistent as he held her as close as possible. He could hear both of their hearts hammering against the cage of their ribs and feel her feather light touches shock his skin like lightning bolts. He was so caught up in the moment that he almost forgot to breathe until his lungs began to burn.</p><p>Nothing but the heavy gasps of the pair filled the space between them for a moment, eyes wide and searching eachother\u2019s for any sign of just what the hell might be going on. \u201cI wanted to tell you in person,\u201d he murmured, cheeks burning and hands lowering back to her own. They were shaking furiously as he took hold of her palms, which began to tremble as well as soon as they connected.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She asked, completely dumbfounded and having forgotten just what she was so distraught about as soon as Peter had kissed her. He pressed his lips together like he always did when he\u2019s anxious,working the bottom one between his teeth as Peter attempted to pluck up the courage to get the words past the hollow of his throat.</p><p>\u201cI,\u201d He inhaled, running his thumbs over the backs of her knuckles in a desperate effort to ground himself. \u201cI love you too,\u201d his eyes only dare lift up to hers for a moment, flickering around her face to try and gather any sign of recognition that he could. When her eyes start to gloss over, he thinks the worst.</p><p>\u201cOh god I didn\u2019t mean to-\u201d She practically throws herself onto him, arms wrapping around his neck as she pulls his frame flush against her own. Peter can feel her shoulders shake with a small, watered down laugh, hands gripping the fabric of his hoodie like a lifeline. He quickly wraps his arms around her middle to return the gesture. Peter\u2019s heart began to even out its pace, and they both just stood there for a moment, trying to figure out how they got so lucky. </p><p>She hadn\u2019t been sure before. Whether things with Peter would work or not. Whether she could keep counting the days until things inevitably crashed and burned for the pair of them. But at the moment, all she needed was his arms round her waist and nose against her temple, soft utterances of the phrase passing freely between the both of them.</p><p>When she lifted her head from his shoulder, her eyes catch on the deep red and blue fabric spilling from the top of Peter\u2019s backpack, which still laid carelessly dropped on her balcony.  She pulled back a moment,brows furrowed and lips curled just the slightest. \u201cPeter?\u201d She fought down a light laugh, her boyfriend stirring from his moonstruck daze only to appreciate her smile.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you have a morphsuit in your backpack?\u201d</p><p><i><b>for better or for worse</b></i></p><p>\u201cDo you even <b>care</b>?\u201d the words clawed past the minuscule passage of her throat and tore through her teeth like bullets from the barrel of a gun. They hit Peter head on. Straight in the hollow of his chest where he presumed his heart was intended to reside. But at the moment it had just felt like somebody replaced it with a bundle of barbed wire; prodding  and poking at all the bruises littered across his chest and scraping the sides of his lungs so air could only leak out like that from a punctured balloon.</p><p>The wounds hidden beneath this sweatshirt felt measly in comparison to seeing her like that. All pursed lips and red rimmed eyes. Her whitened knuckles were curled around the massive binder clutched close to her chest, where he was meant to be. Instead it felt like they were universes apart, Peter just now coming to the realization that there was no oxygen in the vast emptiness of space.</p><p>He sputtered, absolutely perturbed that she would even ask a question like that. <i>Of course</i> he cared. He cared so much that he felt he might burst at the seams some days. But maybe today it was more than a feeling. He could sense himself crumbling as he struggled to get the words out, falling short when her eyes began to water. \u201cWhat do you mean?!Of course I care about you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me-this isn\u2019t about me,Peter,\u201d she said sharply, words having an effect all too similar to the shrapnel that had gotten lodged in his stomach the night before. \u201cThis is about <i><b>you</b></i>- you throwing yourself into danger at the smallest sign of it and not even <i><b>thinking</b></i> about what could happen. You could have-\u201d her voice was the one to fail her that time, splintering beneath the pressure in her lungs and dropping to the scuffed tile floor in shards. </p><p>For the first time since he\u2019d met her, the thought crosses Peter\u2019s mind that maybe it would have been better if he hadn\u2019t.</p><p><i><b>for richer or for poorer</b></i></p><p>\u201cPeter, oh my god I was just kidding you really don\u2019t have to,\u201d she could barely contain her giggles as she braced one hand on his hunched shoulder and the other on the smudged glass of the arcade game window. Peter found this all the more distracting, and only slightly irritating since her laugh and gentle touch threw off his skill completely. So of course, whenever he tilted his head to share a lopsided smile with her, the machine instantly whirred with a sickenly familiar sound to remind him he\u2019d run out of time. </p><p>His face fell into a defeated frown, her own still aglow in the neon lights as she tried to coax him to try out another game with her. But Peter Parker was a stubborn little shit when it came to making his girlfriend happy. So if he had to take out a loan to get that damn Spider-Man plushie, you\u2019d best believe he would.</p><p>Without a single moment\u2019s hesitation, Peter took her hand in his and dragged the pair of them back to the token machine with a twenty curled in his other palm. \u201cPeter,\u201d she tried to suppress her laughter long enough to get him to reconsider spending his life savings on a rigged claw machine. Needless to say-it did not work. </p><p>Within thirty seconds they were practically sprinting back across the funky printed carpet to the games, since Peter was completely sure that if they waited a moment longer that somebody would come steal that toy along with his girlfriend as well.</p><p>Eleven tries and eleven defeats later, she finally managed to get Peter to step away from his newfound nemesis and quite possibly the toughest criminal he\u2019d faced in all of Queens. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you let me give it a try?\u201d She wrapped her arms around his waist, peering over his shoulder into the pile of stuffed animals with an amused smirk still digging into her cheeks. With a sheepish smile, Peter plucked his last pair of tokens from his pocket. He slipped them into the coin slot before swapping positions with her and settling one of his hands atop hers that had gripped the toggle and button. </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get to take the credit for my win just because you held my hand,Parker,\u201d She taunted lightly, trying not to let the feeling on his chin rested atop her head and warm chest pressed against her back get the best of her. She almost dropped the claw accidentally when it rumbled with a soft chuckle, Peter watching on eagerly as she guided it to the perfect spot.</p><p>\u201cyes! oh my god!\u201d She fell back into his grip with a grin on her face and laughter bubbling from her lungs. Peter stared in complete shock as the claw dropped the small plush down the hatch with supernatural ease. He reluctantly released her from his arms to let her crouch down and collect the prize, lips parted and eyes the size of saucers.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe that,\u201d Peter shook his head lightly, still smiling enough to let her know she hadn\u2019t completely demolished his pride with her immaculate claw machine prowess. She just continued to laugh, using one hand to hold her newest treasure and the other to link with Peter\u2019s. </p><p>\u201cYou ready for lunch?Unless you went broke trying to free Spider-Man Junior here, that is,\u201d her eyes twinkled and Peter flushed lightly, the shade deepening when he fished through his pockets and came up empty. \u201cOh my god you actually did,\u201d she declared, snickering helplessly as she fell into Peter and kissed his heated cheek affectionately while he fumbled for an explanation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry I-\u201d the look on her face was enough to quiet Peter and still his racing heart. It wasn\u2019t irritable or embarrassed or awkward. It was perfectly content and maybe a little bit entertained. She would have expected nothing less from Peter and found he rose to the title of dorkiest, sweetest boyfriend ever quite well in that particular moment. </p><p>So that time she was the one to pull out her wallet, brushing off Peter\u2019s objections with a light squeeze of his hand and easygoing mention of the new cafe opened down the street. With a rueful chuckle Peter followed her to the door, giving one last nod to the brightly colored kids menu displayed overhead. </p><p>\u201cYou mean you\u2019re <i>sure</i> you don\u2019t want the five dollar family pizza?\u201d </p><p><i><b>In sickness and in health</b></i></p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d she croaked whiningly, burying further under the quilts piled atop her bed while the brunett beside it desperately tried to get her to wake without drop kicking him with a Thor slipper still on her foot.</p><p>\u201cC'mon babe, you gotta take your antibiotic,\u201d he gingerly tried to peel back the duvet, being greeted with her mess of a self glaring at him through half lidded eyes and a curtain of her hair she couldn\u2019t be bothered to push back. Huffing irritably, she heaved herself into a sitting position and leant against the headboard for support, combing through her bird\u2019s nest of an updo that had been tossed about in her sleep.</p><p>Peter patiently reached over to the nightstand and held out a small glass along with her medications in each hand, helping to hold up the cup when necessary since her grip was even shakier than usual. She wiped the corner of her lip groggily, staring at Peter with that same look she always had when he was being far too sweet with her and she wanted to be mad but couldn\u2019t bring herself to put the energy into it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to be here,\u201d She grumbled, leaning forward to rest her head on his shoulder nonetheless. She felt it shake slightly with a short laugh,his fingertips running through her hair to carefully thread through the knots she had missed.</p><p>Last time she\u2019d been awake, it was right after school and Peter had come bustling in with her favorite movies and tea bags in tow. Even after several minutes of trying to convince him to go home and preserve his health while he could, Peter obviously wasn\u2019t going to budge. So she had grudgingly flopped back onto her mattress and made small talk with him until her pills kicked in and made her a drowsy, incoherent mess. And of course Peter couldn\u2019t take her seriously when she had demanded he not be here when she wake up; wagging her finger in the air with a cheek squished against her pillow and a well loved Spider-Man plushie in the crook of her arm.</p><p>\u201cYou mean you aren\u2019t glad to see me?\u201d He teased lightly, smoothing his hand down from the back of her neck to the base of her spine and rubbing soothing patterns into it. Her indignant huff was enough of an answer to have Peter grinning. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid,\u201d she began to play with his fingers like a small child, eventually lacing them with her own. \u201c'Course I\u2019m happy to see you.\u201d Her words were still a bit slurred from sleep, and halfway muffled by the fabric of Peter\u2019s hoodie. So he had a difficult time continuing to contain his laughter when she pressed a small, clumsy kiss to the neckline of his t-shirt and carelessly dropped back onto the bed with a pitiful sigh.</p><p>\u201cS'there anything I can do for you, beautiful?\u201d He hummed, trying to brush away the strands of her hair that had strewn back across her face when she flopped into the comfort of her pillows. She let out a dry snicker at his choice of words. </p><p>\u201cYeah,I\u2019m sure i\u2019m looking stunning at the moment,\u201d her words were dripping in sarcasm but the way she leans into Peter\u2019s touch was all too genuine for him to even think of rolling his eyes. Instead he nodded as if the irony wasn\u2019t even present in her tone, eyes full of adoration as he ran a thumb over her cheek. She laughed again at this, but the sound is a bit gentler, a bit more true. \u201cThank you Peter,\u201d she sighed, drawing his hand down from her face and to clasp with her own.</p><p>Only moments later, an older woman with worry and smile lines alike came scurrying into the room, face warming into a smile at the sight laid out in her daughter\u2019s bedroom while she sets down her bags. \u201cThank you so much, Peter. I don\u2019t know how you get her to be so sweet with you. Usually by now I would have been kicked out to the living room,\u201d the woman teased, coming to kiss her daughter\u2019s forehead and beam at the boy that had managed to tame her obstinate spirit.</p><p>\u201cNot a problem at all,\u201d Peter exchanged a genuine smile with the both of them before her mother began rambling about how late it had gotten and if Peter needed a ride home. \u201cNo,no,it\u2019s alright. My car\u2019s out front. But are you sure I don\u2019t need to stay?if you\u2019ve still got work I can keep this one company,\u201d He nudged her thigh with a playful grin, only getting a roll of her tired eyes in response as she tugged the blankets back up to her chin.</p><p>\u201cOh don\u2019t worry about it,sweetie.I think I can handle it from here,\u201d The older woman assured Peter, ushering him up and to the door so he wouldn\u2019t be getting home at too ungodly of an hour. But just as the pair of them got to the door and Peter blew a dramatic kiss goodbye, Her voice rose from the blankets in a final solemn request.</p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d the boy whipped around so fast he would probably have whiplash for the next week, brows raised and feet ready to head wherever she required. But she only reached out her hands from beneath the duvet, making a childish grabbing motion that spread a grin onto Peter\u2019s lips immediately.</p><p>\u201cLeave the hoodie,\u201d</p><p><i><b>\u201cTill death do us part</b></i>\u201d</p><p>Peter didn\u2019t even have the thought to wait until he was permitted to kiss his wife. They were already in each other\u2019s arms, glossy eyed and smiling a bit too hard for their lips to meet properly. There was laughter and cheering and quite possibly a clap of thunder a few miles away, even though the sky was crystal clear and void of a single rain cloud. </p><p>They share a small snicker as they part, eyes wide with wonder and surprise that even the godly branch of Peter\u2019s family had made the effort to celebrate on such an important day. But it seemed that the lord of thunder wasn\u2019t the only one present, but his brother as well. At least, that\u2019s who Peter blames when he sent the pair of them tripping down the stair steps on the way out, headed towards their new life together with hearty laughter and curved lipped kisses, just as predicted.</p>",

With the pristine light of early morning rays filtering through ornately designed windows, arcing above their heads and set in aged but intricately carved stone. A sea of familiar, beaming faces sitting in the pews. Composed of not-quite blood relatives but family all the same; all of them alight with inexplicable joy on a day nearly everyone had been betting on since Peter\u2019s sophomore year at Midtown when he bumped into the best thing to ever happen to him-and spilled her physics homework all over the hall.</p><p>He was nervous, to say the least.

The sound seems to reverberate through the hollows of his lungs, filling them to the brim with a familiar too-full ache. That\u2019s how he always feels when she\u2019s around. Too full. As if there\u2019s only so much space in his body available to contain the amount of love and adoration he holds for her. Something so immeasurable and indescribable couldn\u2019t so easily be held in the confines of Peter\u2019s heart.</p><p>So it presses against the walls of his lungs and curves of his ribs, making his jaw go slack and eyes water when they land on her figure at the foot of the walkway. He can barely get enough oxygen in his lungs to laugh at himself, feeling a bit unsteady on his own two feet as he drinks in the image of her donned in white and glowing with the radiance of-</p><p><i><b>to have and to hold</b></i></p><p>\u201cSirius,\u201d she states quietly, Peter\u2019s gaze following the tip of her finger to the pinprick of light only fully visible through the massive telescope they\u2019d both been stealing glances from (along with a few directed towards each other) throughout the night.</p><p>\u201cLike, from Harry Potter?\u201d She let out a soft laugh at his inquiry, the sound making Peter\u2019s heart thump a bit faster and his lips press together in a sheepish smile. It was a nice sound to hear. Mellow, sincere, and just bubbly enough to coax a small, breathless snicker from himself as well. </p><p>He noticed just before she ducked her head down in a bashful smile that her eyes seemed to glint with a different kind of light than they did during the hustle and bustle of the school days. A bit more real,a bit more raw. He supposed something about having the whole of the galaxy mapped out before you did that to a person. But maybe he just saw the reflection of Canopus in the sea of her irises.</p><p>Sure, her heart would skip a beat nearly every time she caught Peter staring at her after she\u2019d come back from peering through the telescope. And she felt the world wobble beneath her feet a bit when his hand brushed against hers while adjusting the focus. But at the moment they were simply a pair of over-enthusiastic teens gawking at the intricately woven constellations hung up well above the light pollution of a never-sleeping city.</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d She lifts her head back up, a faint ghost of a smile still visible in the curve of her cheeks. \u201cIt\u2019s the brightest one we\u2019ve found yet. Just along Orion\u2019s belt,\u201d she traces out the contours of the asterism, fixating once again on the star in question.</p><p>Peter nods, unable to keep the smile from his face as she continues to muse about the various shapes, sizes, and stories drawn across the night sky. She looked nothing short of breathtaking like this. Peter couldn\u2019t get enough of the wonderstruck brilliance that she radiated while explaining every small detail and facet of the celestial wonders beheld to him. He never dreamt he\u2019d be close enough to a star to feel the nuclear fusion tingling at his fingertips.</p><p><i><b>from this day forward</b></i></p><p>She had promised herself she wouldn\u2019t. She knew it was ridiculous and completely naive of her to be indulging in ideas like that. She knew better and she\u2019d be lying if she said it wasn\u2019t getting rather irritating trying to run from what she felt for Peter.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t seen it coming. It was supposed to be just another normal day. Normal being a relative term considering her life had been turned upside down since that first night with Peter at the observatory almost seven months ago. </p><p>It was impossibly wonderful and painfully new for her. Having somebody as thoughtful, understanding, and genuine as Peter wasn\u2019t something she was used to. And while he was nothing short of amazing to her, and she adored every minute she got to spend with him-there was a sense of unshakable vulnerability that she still had yet to fully accept.</p><p>So when he texted her amidst the hectic buzz of her Monday morning with a new picture of that dawn\u2019s sunrise-she found herself typing out a response without a second thought. The grin was still on her face as she pressed send, not even realizing that she\u2019d just taken a massive leap and would soon be feeling the effects of a nosedive into the deep end.</p><p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d she breathed,heart skipping a beat as she read the text a second, third, and fourth time.</p><p><i>\u2018God,I love you,Parker,\u2019 </i></p><p>\u201cShit, Shit, Shit,\u201d she muttered under her breath, tugging a hand through her barely brushed mass of bedhead and shoving the phone across the kitchen counter before beginning to pace wildly about the room. Her stomach was churning and head was spinning with all the possibilities of how this could end- none of them being positive of course.</p><p>After what feels like ages of stumbling about the chilled tile, she braved a glance back at her phone.Her heart dropped straight to her socks.</p><p><i>'Read: 6:15\u2019</i></p><p>She felt her throat begin to close up and top row of teeth come down harshly on her bottom lip, gnawing vainly to try and diffuse the terror spreading through her veins like ice water. Just when she thought she might be sick from the wait, a loud crash from her front balcony sends the young girl straight into a whole other panic.</p><p>Her breath hitched and eyes went wide,fixating on the figure strewn across the concrete floor, leg entangled in a lawn chair and kicking helplessly to try and escape it.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fu-\u201d she can\u2019t finish her sentence before she\u2019s at the pair of glass doors and Peter\u2019s flushed face lifted to meet her gaze, still lowered onto the floor where he\u2019s splayed out and ensnared by her mother\u2019s favorite lounging seat. Finally,he managed to struggle free from the confines and onto his feet, chest heaving and hair still fluffed about in a clearly slept on fashion.</p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d She exclaimed, absolutely awestruck as she pulled back the door to stare at him with parted lips and furrowed brows. \u201cHow did you even get here I live two blocks away-\u201d Peter didn\u2019t even let her finish the sentence before letting his backpack slip off his shoulders and feet carry him straight to her incredulous person.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have the time to register him lifting his hands to cup her face before their lips had already met, his own gentle yet insistent as he held her as close as possible. He could hear both of their hearts hammering against the cage of their ribs and feel her feather light touches shock his skin like lightning bolts. He was so caught up in the moment that he almost forgot to breathe until his lungs began to burn.</p><p>Nothing but the heavy gasps of the pair filled the space between them for a moment, eyes wide and searching eachother\u2019s for any sign of just what the hell might be going on. \u201cI wanted to tell you in person,\u201d he murmured, cheeks burning and hands lowering back to her own. They were shaking furiously as he took hold of her palms, which began to tremble as well as soon as they connected.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She asked, completely dumbfounded and having forgotten just what she was so distraught about as soon as Peter had kissed her. He pressed his lips together like he always did when he\u2019s anxious,working the bottom one between his teeth as Peter attempted to pluck up the courage to get the words past the hollow of his throat.</p><p>\u201cI,\u201d He inhaled, running his thumbs over the backs of her knuckles in a desperate effort to ground himself. \u201cI love you too,\u201d his eyes only dare lift up to hers for a moment, flickering around her face to try and gather any sign of recognition that he could. When her eyes start to gloss over, he thinks the worst.</p><p>\u201cOh god I didn\u2019t mean to-\u201d She practically throws herself onto him, arms wrapping around his neck as she pulls his frame flush against her own. Peter can feel her shoulders shake with a small, watered down laugh, hands gripping the fabric of his hoodie like a lifeline. He quickly wraps his arms around her middle to return the gesture. Peter\u2019s heart began to even out its pace, and they both just stood there for a moment, trying to figure out how they got so lucky. </p><p>She hadn\u2019t been sure before. Whether things with Peter would work or not. Whether she could keep counting the days until things inevitably crashed and burned for the pair of them. But at the moment, all she needed was his arms round her waist and nose against her temple, soft utterances of the phrase passing freely between the both of them.</p><p>When she lifted her head from his shoulder, her eyes catch on the deep red and blue fabric spilling from the top of Peter\u2019s backpack, which still laid carelessly dropped on her balcony.  She pulled back a moment,brows furrowed and lips curled just the slightest. \u201cPeter?\u201d She fought down a light laugh, her boyfriend stirring from his moonstruck daze only to appreciate her smile.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you have a morphsuit in your backpack?\u201d</p><p><i><b>for better or for worse</b></i></p><p>\u201cDo you even <b>care</b>?\u201d the words clawed past the minuscule passage of her throat and tore through her teeth like bullets from the barrel of a gun. They hit Peter head on. Straight in the hollow of his chest where he presumed his heart was intended to reside. But at the moment it had just felt like somebody replaced it with a bundle of barbed wire; prodding  and poking at all the bruises littered across his chest and scraping the sides of his lungs so air could only leak out like that from a punctured balloon.</p><p>The wounds hidden beneath this sweatshirt felt measly in comparison to seeing her like that. All pursed lips and red rimmed eyes. Her whitened knuckles were curled around the massive binder clutched close to her chest, where he was meant to be. Instead it felt like they were universes apart, Peter just now coming to the realization that there was no oxygen in the vast emptiness of space.</p><p>He sputtered, absolutely perturbed that she would even ask a question like that. <i>Of course</i> he cared. He cared so much that he felt he might burst at the seams some days. But maybe today it was more than a feeling. He could sense himself crumbling as he struggled to get the words out, falling short when her eyes began to water. \u201cWhat do you mean?!Of course I care about you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me-this isn\u2019t about me,Peter,\u201d she said sharply, words having an effect all too similar to the shrapnel that had gotten lodged in his stomach the night before. \u201cThis is about <i><b>you</b></i>- you throwing yourself into danger at the smallest sign of it and not even <i><b>thinking</b></i> about what could happen. You could have-\u201d her voice was the one to fail her that time, splintering beneath the pressure in her lungs and dropping to the scuffed tile floor in shards. </p><p>For the first time since he\u2019d met her, the thought crosses Peter\u2019s mind that maybe it would have been better if he hadn\u2019t.</p><p><i><b>for richer or for poorer</b></i></p><p>\u201cPeter, oh my god I was just kidding you really don\u2019t have to,\u201d she could barely contain her giggles as she braced one hand on his hunched shoulder and the other on the smudged glass of the arcade game window. Peter found this all the more distracting, and only slightly irritating since her laugh and gentle touch threw off his skill completely. So of course, whenever he tilted his head to share a lopsided smile with her, the machine instantly whirred with a sickenly familiar sound to remind him he\u2019d run out of time. </p><p>His face fell into a defeated frown, her own still aglow in the neon lights as she tried to coax him to try out another game with her. But Peter Parker was a stubborn little shit when it came to making his girlfriend happy. So if he had to take out a loan to get that damn Spider-Man plushie, you\u2019d best believe he would.</p><p>Without a single moment\u2019s hesitation, Peter took her hand in his and dragged the pair of them back to the token machine with a twenty curled in his other palm. \u201cPeter,\u201d she tried to suppress her laughter long enough to get him to reconsider spending his life savings on a rigged claw machine. Needless to say-it did not work. </p><p>Within thirty seconds they were practically sprinting back across the funky printed carpet to the games, since Peter was completely sure that if they waited a moment longer that somebody would come steal that toy along with his girlfriend as well.</p><p>Eleven tries and eleven defeats later, she finally managed to get Peter to step away from his newfound nemesis and quite possibly the toughest criminal he\u2019d faced in all of Queens. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you let me give it a try?\u201d She wrapped her arms around his waist, peering over his shoulder into the pile of stuffed animals with an amused smirk still digging into her cheeks. With a sheepish smile, Peter plucked his last pair of tokens from his pocket. He slipped them into the coin slot before swapping positions with her and settling one of his hands atop hers that had gripped the toggle and button. </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get to take the credit for my win just because you held my hand,Parker,\u201d She taunted lightly, trying not to let the feeling on his chin rested atop her head and warm chest pressed against her back get the best of her. She almost dropped the claw accidentally when it rumbled with a soft chuckle, Peter watching on eagerly as she guided it to the perfect spot.</p><p>\u201cyes! oh my god!\u201d She fell back into his grip with a grin on her face and laughter bubbling from her lungs. Peter stared in complete shock as the claw dropped the small plush down the hatch with supernatural ease. He reluctantly released her from his arms to let her crouch down and collect the prize, lips parted and eyes the size of saucers.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe that,\u201d Peter shook his head lightly, still smiling enough to let her know she hadn\u2019t completely demolished his pride with her immaculate claw machine prowess. She just continued to laugh, using one hand to hold her newest treasure and the other to link with Peter\u2019s. </p><p>\u201cYou ready for lunch?Unless you went broke trying to free Spider-Man Junior here, that is,\u201d her eyes twinkled and Peter flushed lightly, the shade deepening when he fished through his pockets and came up empty. \u201cOh my god you actually did,\u201d she declared, snickering helplessly as she fell into Peter and kissed his heated cheek affectionately while he fumbled for an explanation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry I-\u201d the look on her face was enough to quiet Peter and still his racing heart. It wasn\u2019t irritable or embarrassed or awkward. It was perfectly content and maybe a little bit entertained. She would have expected nothing less from Peter and found he rose to the title of dorkiest, sweetest boyfriend ever quite well in that particular moment. </p><p>So that time she was the one to pull out her wallet, brushing off Peter\u2019s objections with a light squeeze of his hand and easygoing mention of the new cafe opened down the street. With a rueful chuckle Peter followed her to the door, giving one last nod to the brightly colored kids menu displayed overhead. </p><p>\u201cYou mean you\u2019re <i>sure</i> you don\u2019t want the five dollar family pizza?\u201d </p><p><i><b>In sickness and in health</b></i></p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d she croaked whiningly, burying further under the quilts piled atop her bed while the brunett beside it desperately tried to get her to wake without drop kicking him with a Thor slipper still on her foot.</p><p>\u201cC'mon babe, you gotta take your antibiotic,\u201d he gingerly tried to peel back the duvet, being greeted with her mess of a self glaring at him through half lidded eyes and a curtain of her hair she couldn\u2019t be bothered to push back. Huffing irritably, she heaved herself into a sitting position and leant against the headboard for support, combing through her bird\u2019s nest of an updo that had been tossed about in her sleep.</p><p>Peter patiently reached over to the nightstand and held out a small glass along with her medications in each hand, helping to hold up the cup when necessary since her grip was even shakier than usual. She wiped the corner of her lip groggily, staring at Peter with that same look she always had when he was being far too sweet with her and she wanted to be mad but couldn\u2019t bring herself to put the energy into it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to be here,\u201d She grumbled, leaning forward to rest her head on his shoulder nonetheless. She felt it shake slightly with a short laugh,his fingertips running through her hair to carefully thread through the knots she had missed.</p><p>Last time she\u2019d been awake, it was right after school and Peter had come bustling in with her favorite movies and tea bags in tow. Even after several minutes of trying to convince him to go home and preserve his health while he could, Peter obviously wasn\u2019t going to budge. So she had grudgingly flopped back onto her mattress and made small talk with him until her pills kicked in and made her a drowsy, incoherent mess. And of course Peter couldn\u2019t take her seriously when she had demanded he not be here when she wake up; wagging her finger in the air with a cheek squished against her pillow and a well loved Spider-Man plushie in the crook of her arm.</p><p>\u201cYou mean you aren\u2019t glad to see me?\u201d He teased lightly, smoothing his hand down from the back of her neck to the base of her spine and rubbing soothing patterns into it. Her indignant huff was enough of an answer to have Peter grinning. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid,\u201d she began to play with his fingers like a small child, eventually lacing them with her own. \u201c'Course I\u2019m happy to see you.\u201d Her words were still a bit slurred from sleep, and halfway muffled by the fabric of Peter\u2019s hoodie. So he had a difficult time continuing to contain his laughter when she pressed a small, clumsy kiss to the neckline of his t-shirt and carelessly dropped back onto the bed with a pitiful sigh.</p><p>\u201cS'there anything I can do for you, beautiful?\u201d He hummed, trying to brush away the strands of her hair that had strewn back across her face when she flopped into the comfort of her pillows. She let out a dry snicker at his choice of words. </p><p>\u201cYeah,I\u2019m sure i\u2019m looking stunning at the moment,\u201d her words were dripping in sarcasm but the way she leans into Peter\u2019s touch was all too genuine for him to even think of rolling his eyes. Instead he nodded as if the irony wasn\u2019t even present in her tone, eyes full of adoration as he ran a thumb over her cheek. She laughed again at this, but the sound is a bit gentler, a bit more true. \u201cThank you Peter,\u201d she sighed, drawing his hand down from her face and to clasp with her own.</p><p>Only moments later, an older woman with worry and smile lines alike came scurrying into the room, face warming into a smile at the sight laid out in her daughter\u2019s bedroom while she sets down her bags. \u201cThank you so much, Peter. I don\u2019t know how you get her to be so sweet with you. Usually by now I would have been kicked out to the living room,\u201d the woman teased, coming to kiss her daughter\u2019s forehead and beam at the boy that had managed to tame her obstinate spirit.</p><p>\u201cNot a problem at all,\u201d Peter exchanged a genuine smile with the both of them before her mother began rambling about how late it had gotten and if Peter needed a ride home. \u201cNo,no,it\u2019s alright. My car\u2019s out front. But are you sure I don\u2019t need to stay?if you\u2019ve still got work I can keep this one company,\u201d He nudged her thigh with a playful grin, only getting a roll of her tired eyes in response as she tugged the blankets back up to her chin.</p><p>\u201cOh don\u2019t worry about it,sweetie.I think I can handle it from here,\u201d The older woman assured Peter, ushering him up and to the door so he wouldn\u2019t be getting home at too ungodly of an hour. But just as the pair of them got to the door and Peter blew a dramatic kiss goodbye, Her voice rose from the blankets in a final solemn request.</p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d the boy whipped around so fast he would probably have whiplash for the next week, brows raised and feet ready to head wherever she required. But she only reached out her hands from beneath the duvet, making a childish grabbing motion that spread a grin onto Peter\u2019s lips immediately.</p><p>\u201cLeave the hoodie,\u201d</p><p><i><b>\u201cTill death do us part</b></i>\u201d</p><p>Peter didn\u2019t even have the thought to wait until he was permitted to kiss his wife. They were already in each other\u2019s arms, glossy eyed and smiling a bit too hard for their lips to meet properly. There was laughter and cheering and quite possibly a clap of thunder a few miles away, even though the sky was crystal clear and void of a single rain cloud. </p><p>They share a small snicker as they part, eyes wide with wonder and surprise that even the godly branch of Peter\u2019s family had made the effort to celebrate on such an important day.

At the end of it all they would still be lovesick messes and exchange breathless laughter between curved-lip kisses.</p>\n\n<p>That didn&rsquo;t stop him from nearly jumping out of his tux when the massive chapel doors heave open with a labored groan. The sound seems to reverberate through the hollows of his lungs, filling them to the brim with a familiar too-full ache. That&rsquo;s how he always feels when she&rsquo;s around. Too full. As if there&rsquo;s only so much space in his body available to contain the amount of love and adoration he holds for her. Something so immeasurable and indescribable couldn&rsquo;t so easily be held in the confines of Peter&rsquo;s heart.</p><p>So it presses against the walls of his lungs and curves of his ribs, making his jaw go slack and eyes water when they land on her figure at the foot of the walkway. He can barely get enough oxygen in his lungs to laugh at himself, feeling a bit unsteady on his own two feet as he drinks in the image of her donned in white and glowing with the radiance of-</p><p><i><b>to have and to hold</b></i></p><p>&ldquo;Sirius,&rdquo; she states quietly, Peter&rsquo;s gaze following the tip of her finger to the pinprick of light only fully visible through the massive telescope they&rsquo;d both been stealing glances from (along with a few directed towards each other) throughout the night.</p><p>&ldquo;Like, from Harry Potter?&rdquo; She let out a soft laugh at his inquiry, the sound making Peter&rsquo;s heart thump a bit faster and his lips press together in a sheepish smile. It was a nice sound to hear. Mellow, sincere, and just bubbly enough to coax a small, breathless snicker from himself as well. </p><p>He noticed just before she ducked her head down in a bashful smile that her eyes seemed to glint with a different kind of light than they did during the hustle and bustle of the school days. A bit more real,a bit more raw. He supposed something about having the whole of the galaxy mapped out before you did that to a person. But maybe he just saw the reflection of Canopus in the sea of her irises.</p><p>Sure, her heart would skip a beat nearly every time she caught Peter staring at her after she&rsquo;d come back from peering through the telescope. And she felt the world wobble beneath her feet a bit when his hand brushed against hers while adjusting the focus. But at the moment they were simply a pair of over-enthusiastic teens gawking at the intricately woven constellations hung up well above the light pollution of a never-sleeping city.</p><p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; She lifts her head back up, a faint ghost of a smile still visible in the curve of her cheeks. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the brightest one we&rsquo;ve found yet. Just along Orion&rsquo;s belt,&rdquo; she traces out the contours of the asterism, fixating once again on the star in question.</p><p>Peter nods, unable to keep the smile from his face as she continues to muse about the various shapes, sizes, and stories drawn across the night sky. She looked nothing short of breathtaking like this. Peter couldn&rsquo;t get enough of the wonderstruck brilliance that she radiated while explaining every small detail and facet of the celestial wonders beheld to him. He never dreamt he&rsquo;d be close enough to a star to feel the nuclear fusion tingling at his fingertips.</p><p><i><b>from this day forward</b></i></p><p>She had promised herself she wouldn&rsquo;t. She knew it was ridiculous and completely naive of her to be indulging in ideas like that. She knew better and she&rsquo;d be lying if she said it wasn&rsquo;t getting rather irritating trying to run from what she felt for Peter.</p><p>She hadn&rsquo;t seen it coming. It was supposed to be just another normal day. Normal being a relative term considering her life had been turned upside down since that first night with Peter at the observatory almost seven months ago. </p><p>It was impossibly wonderful and painfully new for her. Having somebody as thoughtful, understanding, and genuine as Peter wasn&rsquo;t something she was used to. And while he was nothing short of amazing to her, and she adored every minute she got to spend with him-there was a sense of unshakable vulnerability that she still had yet to fully accept.</p><p>So when he texted her amidst the hectic buzz of her Monday morning with a new picture of that dawn&rsquo;s sunrise-she found herself typing out a response without a second thought. The grin was still on her face as she pressed send, not even realizing that she&rsquo;d just taken a massive leap and would soon be feeling the effects of a nosedive into the deep end.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god,&rdquo; she breathed,heart skipping a beat as she read the text a second, third, and fourth time.</p><p><i>&lsquo;God,I love you,Parker,&rsquo; </i></p><p>&ldquo;Shit, Shit, Shit,&rdquo; she muttered under her breath, tugging a hand through her barely brushed mass of bedhead and shoving the phone across the kitchen counter before beginning to pace wildly about the room. Her stomach was churning and head was spinning with all the possibilities of how this could end- none of them being positive of course.</p><p>After what feels like ages of stumbling about the chilled tile, she braved a glance back at her phone.Her heart dropped straight to her socks.</p><p><i>'Read: 6:15&rsquo;</i></p><p>She felt her throat begin to close up and top row of teeth come down harshly on her bottom lip, gnawing vainly to try and diffuse the terror spreading through her veins like ice water. Just when she thought she might be sick from the wait, a loud crash from her front balcony sends the young girl straight into a whole other panic.</p><p>Her breath hitched and eyes went wide,fixating on the figure strewn across the concrete floor, leg entangled in a lawn chair and kicking helplessly to try and escape it.</p><p>&ldquo;What the fu-&rdquo; she can&rsquo;t finish her sentence before she&rsquo;s at the pair of glass doors and Peter&rsquo;s flushed face lifted to meet her gaze, still lowered onto the floor where he&rsquo;s splayed out and ensnared by her mother&rsquo;s favorite lounging seat. Finally,he managed to struggle free from the confines and onto his feet, chest heaving and hair still fluffed about in a clearly slept on fashion.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; She exclaimed, absolutely awestruck as she pulled back the door to stare at him with parted lips and furrowed brows. &ldquo;How did you even get here I live two blocks away-&rdquo; Peter didn&rsquo;t even let her finish the sentence before letting his backpack slip off his shoulders and feet carry him straight to her incredulous person.</p><p>She didn&rsquo;t have the time to register him lifting his hands to cup her face before their lips had already met, his own gentle yet insistent as he held her as close as possible. He could hear both of their hearts hammering against the cage of their ribs and feel her feather light touches shock his skin like lightning bolts. He was so caught up in the moment that he almost forgot to breathe until his lungs began to burn.</p><p>Nothing but the heavy gasps of the pair filled the space between them for a moment, eyes wide and searching eachother&rsquo;s for any sign of just what the hell might be going on. &ldquo;I wanted to tell you in person,&rdquo; he murmured, cheeks burning and hands lowering back to her own. They were shaking furiously as he took hold of her palms, which began to tremble as well as soon as they connected.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; She asked, completely dumbfounded and having forgotten just what she was so distraught about as soon as Peter had kissed her. He pressed his lips together like he always did when he&rsquo;s anxious,working the bottom one between his teeth as Peter attempted to pluck up the courage to get the words past the hollow of his throat.</p><p>&ldquo;I,&rdquo; He inhaled, running his thumbs over the backs of her knuckles in a desperate effort to ground himself. &ldquo;I love you too,&rdquo; his eyes only dare lift up to hers for a moment, flickering around her face to try and gather any sign of recognition that he could. When her eyes start to gloss over, he thinks the worst.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh god I didn&rsquo;t mean to-&rdquo; She practically throws herself onto him, arms wrapping around his neck as she pulls his frame flush against her own. Peter can feel her shoulders shake with a small, watered down laugh, hands gripping the fabric of his hoodie like a lifeline. He quickly wraps his arms around her middle to return the gesture. Peter&rsquo;s heart began to even out its pace, and they both just stood there for a moment, trying to figure out how they got so lucky. </p><p>She hadn&rsquo;t been sure before. Whether things with Peter would work or not. Whether she could keep counting the days until things inevitably crashed and burned for the pair of them. But at the moment, all she needed was his arms round her waist and nose against her temple, soft utterances of the phrase passing freely between the both of them.</p><p>When she lifted her head from his shoulder, her eyes catch on the deep red and blue fabric spilling from the top of Peter&rsquo;s backpack, which still laid carelessly dropped on her balcony.  She pulled back a moment,brows furrowed and lips curled just the slightest. &ldquo;Peter?&rdquo; She fought down a light laugh, her boyfriend stirring from his moonstruck daze only to appreciate her smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why do you have a morphsuit in your backpack?&rdquo;</p><p><i><b>for better or for worse</b></i></p><p>&ldquo;Do you even <b>care</b>?&rdquo; the words clawed past the minuscule passage of her throat and tore through her teeth like bullets from the barrel of a gun. They hit Peter head on. Straight in the hollow of his chest where he presumed his heart was intended to reside. But at the moment it had just felt like somebody replaced it with a bundle of barbed wire; prodding  and poking at all the bruises littered across his chest and scraping the sides of his lungs so air could only leak out like that from a punctured balloon.</p><p>The wounds hidden beneath this sweatshirt felt measly in comparison to seeing her like that. All pursed lips and red rimmed eyes. Her whitened knuckles were curled around the massive binder clutched close to her chest, where he was meant to be. Instead it felt like they were universes apart, Peter just now coming to the realization that there was no oxygen in the vast emptiness of space.</p><p>He sputtered, absolutely perturbed that she would even ask a question like that. <i>Of course</i> he cared. He cared so much that he felt he might burst at the seams some days. But maybe today it was more than a feeling. He could sense himself crumbling as he struggled to get the words out, falling short when her eyes began to water. &ldquo;What do you mean?!Of course I care about you-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not me-this isn&rsquo;t about me,Peter,&rdquo; she said sharply, words having an effect all too similar to the shrapnel that had gotten lodged in his stomach the night before. &ldquo;This is about <i><b>you</b></i>- you throwing yourself into danger at the smallest sign of it and not even <i><b>thinking</b></i> about what could happen. You could have-&rdquo; her voice was the one to fail her that time, splintering beneath the pressure in her lungs and dropping to the scuffed tile floor in shards. </p><p>For the first time since he&rsquo;d met her, the thought crosses Peter&rsquo;s mind that maybe it would have been better if he hadn&rsquo;t.</p><p><i><b>for richer or for poorer</b></i></p><p>&ldquo;Peter, oh my god I was just kidding you really don&rsquo;t have to,&rdquo; she could barely contain her giggles as she braced one hand on his hunched shoulder and the other on the smudged glass of the arcade game window. Peter found this all the more distracting, and only slightly irritating since her laugh and gentle touch threw off his skill completely. So of course, whenever he tilted his head to share a lopsided smile with her, the machine instantly whirred with a sickenly familiar sound to remind him he&rsquo;d run out of time. </p><p>His face fell into a defeated frown, her own still aglow in the neon lights as she tried to coax him to try out another game with her. But Peter Parker was a stubborn little shit when it came to making his girlfriend happy. So if he had to take out a loan to get that damn Spider-Man plushie, you&rsquo;d best believe he would.</p><p>Without a single moment&rsquo;s hesitation, Peter took her hand in his and dragged the pair of them back to the token machine with a twenty curled in his other palm. &ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; she tried to suppress her laughter long enough to get him to reconsider spending his life savings on a rigged claw machine. Needless to say-it did not work. </p><p>Within thirty seconds they were practically sprinting back across the funky printed carpet to the games, since Peter was completely sure that if they waited a moment longer that somebody would come steal that toy along with his girlfriend as well.</p><p>Eleven tries and eleven defeats later, she finally managed to get Peter to step away from his newfound nemesis and quite possibly the toughest criminal he&rsquo;d faced in all of Queens. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you let me give it a try?&rdquo; She wrapped her arms around his waist, peering over his shoulder into the pile of stuffed animals with an amused smirk still digging into her cheeks. With a sheepish smile, Peter plucked his last pair of tokens from his pocket. He slipped them into the coin slot before swapping positions with her and settling one of his hands atop hers that had gripped the toggle and button. </p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t get to take the credit for my win just because you held my hand,Parker,&rdquo; She taunted lightly, trying not to let the feeling on his chin rested atop her head and warm chest pressed against her back get the best of her. She almost dropped the claw accidentally when it rumbled with a soft chuckle, Peter watching on eagerly as she guided it to the perfect spot.</p><p>&ldquo;yes! oh my god!&rdquo; She fell back into his grip with a grin on her face and laughter bubbling from her lungs. Peter stared in complete shock as the claw dropped the small plush down the hatch with supernatural ease. He reluctantly released her from his arms to let her crouch down and collect the prize, lips parted and eyes the size of saucers.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe that,&rdquo; Peter shook his head lightly, still smiling enough to let her know she hadn&rsquo;t completely demolished his pride with her immaculate claw machine prowess. She just continued to laugh, using one hand to hold her newest treasure and the other to link with Peter&rsquo;s. </p><p>&ldquo;You ready for lunch?Unless you went broke trying to free Spider-Man Junior here, that is,&rdquo; her eyes twinkled and Peter flushed lightly, the shade deepening when he fished through his pockets and came up empty. &ldquo;Oh my god you actually did,&rdquo; she declared, snickering helplessly as she fell into Peter and kissed his heated cheek affectionately while he fumbled for an explanation.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry I-&rdquo; the look on her face was enough to quiet Peter and still his racing heart. It wasn&rsquo;t irritable or embarrassed or awkward. It was perfectly content and maybe a little bit entertained. She would have expected nothing less from Peter and found he rose to the title of dorkiest, sweetest boyfriend ever quite well in that particular moment. </p><p>So that time she was the one to pull out her wallet, brushing off Peter&rsquo;s objections with a light squeeze of his hand and easygoing mention of the new cafe opened down the street. With a rueful chuckle Peter followed her to the door, giving one last nod to the brightly colored kids menu displayed overhead. </p><p>&ldquo;You mean you&rsquo;re <i>sure</i> you don&rsquo;t want the five dollar family pizza?&rdquo; </p><p><i><b>In sickness and in health</b></i></p><p>&ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; she croaked whiningly, burying further under the quilts piled atop her bed while the brunett beside it desperately tried to get her to wake without drop kicking him with a Thor slipper still on her foot.</p><p>&ldquo;C'mon babe, you gotta take your antibiotic,&rdquo; he gingerly tried to peel back the duvet, being greeted with her mess of a self glaring at him through half lidded eyes and a curtain of her hair she couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to push back. Huffing irritably, she heaved herself into a sitting position and leant against the headboard for support, combing through her bird&rsquo;s nest of an updo that had been tossed about in her sleep.</p><p>Peter patiently reached over to the nightstand and held out a small glass along with her medications in each hand, helping to hold up the cup when necessary since her grip was even shakier than usual. She wiped the corner of her lip groggily, staring at Peter with that same look she always had when he was being far too sweet with her and she wanted to be mad but couldn&rsquo;t bring herself to put the energy into it.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not supposed to be here,&rdquo; She grumbled, leaning forward to rest her head on his shoulder nonetheless. She felt it shake slightly with a short laugh,his fingertips running through her hair to carefully thread through the knots she had missed.</p><p>Last time she&rsquo;d been awake, it was right after school and Peter had come bustling in with her favorite movies and tea bags in tow. Even after several minutes of trying to convince him to go home and preserve his health while he could, Peter obviously wasn&rsquo;t going to budge. So she had grudgingly flopped back onto her mattress and made small talk with him until her pills kicked in and made her a drowsy, incoherent mess. And of course Peter couldn&rsquo;t take her seriously when she had demanded he not be here when she wake up; wagging her finger in the air with a cheek squished against her pillow and a well loved Spider-Man plushie in the crook of her arm.</p><p>&ldquo;You mean you aren&rsquo;t glad to see me?&rdquo; He teased lightly, smoothing his hand down from the back of her neck to the base of her spine and rubbing soothing patterns into it. Her indignant huff was enough of an answer to have Peter grinning. </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be stupid,&rdquo; she began to play with his fingers like a small child, eventually lacing them with her own. &ldquo;'Course I&rsquo;m happy to see you.&rdquo; Her words were still a bit slurred from sleep, and halfway muffled by the fabric of Peter&rsquo;s hoodie. So he had a difficult time continuing to contain his laughter when she pressed a small, clumsy kiss to the neckline of his t-shirt and carelessly dropped back onto the bed with a pitiful sigh.</p><p>&ldquo;S'there anything I can do for you, beautiful?&rdquo; He hummed, trying to brush away the strands of her hair that had strewn back across her face when she flopped into the comfort of her pillows. She let out a dry snicker at his choice of words. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,I&rsquo;m sure i&rsquo;m looking stunning at the moment,&rdquo; her words were dripping in sarcasm but the way she leans into Peter&rsquo;s touch was all too genuine for him to even think of rolling his eyes. Instead he nodded as if the irony wasn&rsquo;t even present in her tone, eyes full of adoration as he ran a thumb over her cheek. She laughed again at this, but the sound is a bit gentler, a bit more true. &ldquo;Thank you Peter,&rdquo; she sighed, drawing his hand down from her face and to clasp with her own.</p><p>Only moments later, an older woman with worry and smile lines alike came scurrying into the room, face warming into a smile at the sight laid out in her daughter&rsquo;s bedroom while she sets down her bags. &ldquo;Thank you so much, Peter. I don&rsquo;t know how you get her to be so sweet with you. Usually by now I would have been kicked out to the living room,&rdquo; the woman teased, coming to kiss her daughter&rsquo;s forehead and beam at the boy that had managed to tame her obstinate spirit.</p><p>&ldquo;Not a problem at all,&rdquo; Peter exchanged a genuine smile with the both of them before her mother began rambling about how late it had gotten and if Peter needed a ride home. &ldquo;No,no,it&rsquo;s alright. My car&rsquo;s out front. But are you sure I don&rsquo;t need to stay?if you&rsquo;ve still got work I can keep this one company,&rdquo; He nudged her thigh with a playful grin, only getting a roll of her tired eyes in response as she tugged the blankets back up to her chin.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh don&rsquo;t worry about it,sweetie.I think I can handle it from here,&rdquo; The older woman assured Peter, ushering him up and to the door so he wouldn&rsquo;t be getting home at too ungodly of an hour. But just as the pair of them got to the door and Peter blew a dramatic kiss goodbye, Her voice rose from the blankets in a final solemn request.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; the boy whipped around so fast he would probably have whiplash for the next week, brows raised and feet ready to head wherever she required. But she only reached out her hands from beneath the duvet, making a childish grabbing motion that spread a grin onto Peter&rsquo;s lips immediately.</p><p>&ldquo;Leave the hoodie,&rdquo;</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Till death do us part</b></i>&rdquo;</p><p>Peter didn&rsquo;t even have the thought to wait until he was permitted to kiss his wife. They were already in each other&rsquo;s arms, glossy eyed and smiling a bit too hard for their lips to meet properly. There was laughter and cheering and quite possibly a clap of thunder a few miles away, even though the sky was crystal clear and void of a single rain cloud. </p><p>They share a small snicker as they part, eyes wide with wonder and surprise that even the godly branch of Peter&rsquo;s family had made the effort to celebrate on such an important day. But it seemed that the lord of thunder wasn&rsquo;t the only one present, but his brother as well. At least, that&rsquo;s who Peter blames when he sent the pair of them tripping down the stair steps on the way out, headed towards their new life together with hearty laughter and curved lipped kisses, just as predicted.</p>",
