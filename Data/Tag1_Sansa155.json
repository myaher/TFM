        "answer": "<p>I liked her, then I was indifferent about her, then I loved her. That all happened in the first season.\u00a0The first episode of this series was a lot to take in when I first was watching it. There was like hundreds of characters, a lot more nudity than everything else that I watched combined, and most importantly, it was really dark. Children were being flung off towers, teenage girls were being sold to grown men, siblings were getting on with each other, and the list kinda goes on and on. So, after I finished the episode, what was most memorable to me wasn\u2019t any of that, but rather this young girl who had this childish crush on this boy she just met. The normalcy of that instantly made me interested in what was going to her character, and the relationship she was going to have with this prince. I thought they were going to have this major romance that was going to last the whole show\u00a0at the time. As it turned out, things turned out to be much more gruesome than I expected, and the prince ended up being this sadist who would later become her abuser.\u00a0Anyways, after my initial impression of her character, nothing in the first season made me dislike Sansa, though I just didn\u2019t understand why she was still into Joffrey after what went down at the Trident. That lack of understanding just caused me to just be indifferent about her character. She didn\u2019t become my favorite character until the last episode of the first season when Joffrey showed Sansa her father\u2019s head. I was surprised when she stood there and told Joffrey that perhaps her brother would give her Joffrey\u2019s head. I was even more surprised when she stayed firmly in place and made no sound despite the fact that an older man was harshly hitting her. I was completely taken aback when she walked towards Joffrey in order to push him off the bridge.\u00a0I didn\u2019t have any problems with her, but that completely changed my opinion of her character, and made me realize just how strong she actually is. For some reason, after that scene, she always ended up being the character I was the most excited to see again whenever I would watch another episode of the show.\u00a0</p>",

I would like to hear it was some more sense, \u201cthey respect you they really do but you need to discuss things before you announce them out loud\u201d?!

She\u2019s not delivering some odd, controversial solution no one\u2019s ever heard of but instead bringing some sense to the table after Royce\u2019s emotional, \u201cTheir castles should be torn down with not a stone left standing!\u201d</p><p>Jon\u2019s suggestion, however, <i>is</i> controversial. This is not how things usually are done. Even as Jon and Sansa each argue their point, people still agree with her. The castles should go to new families, families of the men who died fighting for Jon. When Jon states that he\u2019s made his decision and his decision is final, no one murmurs or bangs their cups in the table in agreement. At least not until Ned Umber and Alys Karstark swear fealty.</p><p>To my modern ears, Jon\u2019s suggestion is better and kinder, but I still understand Sansa\u2019s worry here.
