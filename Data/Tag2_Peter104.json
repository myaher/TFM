Every single second you\u2019re resisting the urge to look towards the door. Every single second your vision become more and more blurry, tears threatening to cause a scene. Every single second you want to melt into the ground and pretend that you didn\u2019t do this. That you didn\u2019t spend hours over agonizing over the perfect outfit and talking about this day to anyone who would listen. Every single second, hope seems lost.</p><p>He should be here. He said he would be here. He would meet you at this small cafe that would mark your first date with him. He told you that he was looking for an actual relationship and how serious he was about it. And you believed it all. You believed that your eyes would meet his and everything would fall into place. You believed that you would somehow fall in love to the scent of coffee and the acoustic music that surrounds you. But he isn\u2019t here and love feels fake.</p><p><!-- more --></p><p>Your attention goes back to your phone that lays face up, illuminating with another text from MJ and Ned. There wasn\u2019t any energy in your body to respond to them, the only text you wanted to read was the one that read Jonah. Of course, it wasn\u2019t there. He was just another guy you met at a random event, who seemed decent enough for you to pursue. </p><p>Your phone buzzes again, your friends empty threats at Jonah weren\u2019t comforting at this point. You just feel so stupid, you should have known that he was some asshole who wanted to mess with your head. Yet, you fell for his simple text messages that made you blush through the screen. You ran your mouth about him to your friends, the excitement in your eyes visible to everyone. MJ would roll her eyes, Ned would excitedly support you, and Peter would just smile. The tables have turned and all they can do is comfort you and drag Jonah through the phone that illuminated the time 12:37, making him an hour and thirty-seven minutes late from what should have been a magical day.</p><p>Something kept you tied down to your chair even if you know you should leave. It was like your pride was holding you down, your mind in refusal that this wasn\u2019t happening. You were delusional, half-expecting him to stroll in with a perfect excuse. He wasn\u2019t even answering his texts. But you held your ground. The poor waiter you had was too kind to kick you out yet and would occasionally ask if you wanted to order, but each time you denied.</p><p>Your eyes were trained onto the fake flowers that divides the table in half. They were screaming color, way too obnoxious for the atmosphere that surrounds you. Noises subdue to the point where you feel out of your body and all you can do was stare down the flowers. You\u2019ve grown so dead to your surroundings that you didn\u2019t even notice the chimes by the door jingle or the footsteps approach you. What you noticed was a voice that cut through your thoughts. The voice that said \u201c(y/n)?\u201d.</p><p>Your hands fly to your face, hastily wiping away the stray tears. Your posture instantly straightens out at the sound of your name, relief washing over. Then it hits you, that voice was too familiar. It wasn\u2019t an unknown voice, it was a voice you know time and time again. \u201cPeter?\u201d.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he says. His focus was on the ground, allowing his unkept hair to flop forward. His hands are behind his back and he\u2019s rocking back and forth on his heels, a slight pink undertone dancing on his skin if you aren\u2019t mistaken.</p><p>\u201cUh, hi. Um, what are you doing here?\u201d you ask. As much as you love Peter, you weren\u2019t fond of the idea of him seeing you in this condition. Though there was this sense of comfort knowing he was right there. </p><p>Peter still doesn\u2019t pry his eyes off the ground, but he grows a shade brighter. \u201cI, um, well you know how you, you sent out the texts. I didn\u2019t want you to be, to be lonely.\u201d</p><p>Your heart melts, he was here for you. \u201cPeter-\u201c</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Peter says thrusting his hands forward. He was holding a beautiful bouquet of flowers that were filled with life. </p><p>\u201cAw, you got me flowers?\u201d you exclaim. You reach over to take them from him, your hands brushing past each other as he hands them off with the lightest touch. The bouquet was abundant with fragrant, whimsical flowers that brightened up the room. </p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d he asks with the softest voice.</p><p>You close your eyes, breathing in the aroma of spring. Your cheeks were straining from the smile that manages to grow. The flowers made your heart blossom that it forgets about the heartache. He brought flowers. \u201cOf course I love it, no ones ever brought me flowers before.\u201d</p><p>Peter wishes he could capture this moment forever. His heart was swelling in size as he realizes he did that. He made that priceless smile appear on your face that he could see despite the orchids and carnations that block the bottom half of your face. Your eyes give it away, they are crinkling in the corners and sparks of joy were dancing in them as you clutch the flowers close to your heart. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat no one has, um, brought you flowers?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMhm, no. I always thought getting flowers was the sweetest thing someone could do. It\u2019s just so classic and romantic, you know? I guess it isn\u2019t that common.\u201d You peer up at Peter who was glowing. He was a god-given gift. \u201cYou should sit,\u201d you say nodding to the empty chair across from you.</p><p>If that\u2019s the way you felt about a simple bouquet, Peter wants to shower you with flowers every day so you can feel that same warmness that made you smile uncontrollably. The love you have for the flowers made Peter want to shield you from the world. You were laying them so cautiously to make sure none of the buds get crushed, it was so pure he can\u2019t handle it.</p><p>\u201cSo, um, how are you?\u201d he says as he slides in to the seat.</p><p>You bite your lip considering the question. You should be disappointed and hurt, which you understandably were. It was like a punch to the gut knowing that Jonah wasn\u2019t going to show up and how the world you built in your head crashed and burned. But then Peter shows up here. He didn\u2019t erase the scarring of the date, but everything seemed to relax back into place like this was always meant to happen. He made the tears dry up and the pain to go away instantly. His presence lifted up your entire mood that you would have forgot about Jonah. \u201cNot sure actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I was on the verge of a breakdown like ten minutes ago, but then you show up here. Then I\u2019m just so happy and content.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cOh? I make you happy?,\u201d Peter says wiggling his eyebrows.</p><p><br/></p><p>You pick up the menu you\u2019ve been staring out for the past hour to hide the growing blush. You laugh as you kick him underneath the table. \u201cI guess? I don\u2019t know, leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>Peter can\u2019t leave you alone though. That\u2019s the whole reason why he stopped patrolling to buy some flowers and went to find you at this cafe. There was no way he could go about his life when you were hurting. You deserve so much more than disappointment and heartache. You deserve the entire world for all he cares. He needs to let you know that there are some amazing, wonderful people out in the world. The world wasn\u2019t just filled with assholes who would leave you hanging. Part of him wishes that he was originally the one going on the date with you, but that\u2019s besides the point. Even if he wasn\u2019t the guy on the other side of the table, he just has to know that you\u2019re smiling.</p><p>Peter was all butterflies and blooming flowers. He always was around you. He swears that your words sound like the greatest poems ever written and that you were sunshine that could make his days better. He can see the stars in your eyes and he wants to promise you that he\u2019ll always be there for you. He could never get tired of you. There was something about you that made him act like a confident fool. Peter finds himself not caring that he\u2019s embarrassing himself around you, he just wants to see you smile.</p><p>And you were. The aching in your heart disappears with each laugh leaving your lips. Peter just knew what to do to make everything smooth over. It was his stupid puns to making up ridiculous stories for every stranger that walks by to buying you the most luscious flowers. Part of you knew he was putting up his best front to put you at ease, but that didn\u2019t matter. All that matters is what was unfolding.</p><p>What was unfolding was something Peter would love to do over and over again. Time was only marked by the food growing cold and the stream of customers leaving and entering. He was able to make joke about Star Wars and ramble about his theory of Mj\u00f6lnir. Maybe he was overthinking it, but he couldn\u2019t get enough of the dynamic between the two of you. The conversation flows easily, no awkward pauses and there was endless topics to discuss. He just knows that the two of you would work out. Peter wishes that you could stay here forever but lunch has to end eventually. </p><p>You weren\u2019t oblivious to the sparks flying between one another, but you convince yourself that it\u2019s all in your head. This was just Peter, he was the Peter whose been your friend for years. Whatever was happening, you drown out the thoughts and bask in the moment. </p><p>The flowers are back in your hand as you and Peter navigate your way through the crowded streets. He insisted that he would walk you home for a proper ending to this day and you can\u2019t help but smile at his offer. It was a beautiful ending to a tragic start. </p><p>The wind whips around your hair as you ask him, \u201cHey, why\u2019d you buy me flowers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoing full circle huh? Starting the day and ending the day with flowers,\u201d Peter says with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cI was just wondering.\u201d</p><p>Peter looks over to see you using your arm as a shield against the wind to protect your precious flowers from flying away. All he can think about is how adorable you are and he wishes he could do more. \u201cUm, I thought they would make you happy. That\u2019s what they do in the movies too, buy flowers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the sweetest.\u201d A warm buzz fills you up, but that\u2019s what Peter does. He just makes you unexplainably happy. \u201cHey, turn here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard everyone deserves flowers one in their life,\u201d Peter says with a shrug. When he turns the corner and the apartment comes into view, a part of him deflates.</p><p>When you look over to Peter to see him with his hands in his pocket and his face flushing with color. He was precious, he could melt the coldest hearts with those words. He deserves something, he deserves the world. Maybe flowers could be a start before conquering the world for him. \u201cHas anyone ever give you flowers?\u201d</p><p>Peter squints his eyes, partly because of the wind, partly in remembrance. The technical answer would be yes. He\u2019s received dozens of roses and lilies that May would proudly display in the middle of the kitchen. But that wasn\u2019t him. It was Spider-man who got all the praise for saving the city and the reward tended to be a shower of flowers. No one has gotten him flowers for being Peter Parker. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s decided, I\u2019m going to buy you the prettiest flowers ever,\u201d you tell him beaming.</p><p>Peter could feel his body start to burn up at your plan. \u201cYou, you don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhm yeah, but I want to.\u201d The warm air engulfs you as you walk through the doors of your complex, but not before you bump Peters shoulder while he opens the door for you.</p><p>Peters heart lurches. \u201cWell, um, I\u2019m just saying you don\u2019t have to get me flowers just because I got you some. I\u2019m not, I\u2019m not expecting anything in return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but I really love the feeling that it gave me. It made so happy and mushy and stuff. I just want you to experience the same feeling because it makes you so warm and fuzzy and everything in the world seems right.\u201d</p><p>If Peter wasn\u2019t enchanted already, those words would have made him fall for you and you weren\u2019t even aware. \u201cJust from a bouquet of flowers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s kind of specific and weird, but it just does. It makes you feel so appreciated and loved. You\u2019ll understand once I buy you some.\u201d </p><p>When the elevator opens, Peter wishes he wasn\u2019t standing there. All the sides reflect him becoming red from your innocent compliments that made him was to burst. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to-\u201c</p><p>\u201cSomebody once told me that everyone deserves flowers once in their lives.\u201d You rub your shoulder against him, completely unaware of the spell you cast on him. However, you were aware of your heart picking up the pace every time you touched. </p><p>\u201cI guess it\u2019s too late to take it back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup. I\u2019m going to buy you the most amazing flowers and you\u2019re gonna love it.\u201d</p><p>Peter can\u2019t help but face you, even if his face was the same shade of a tomato. \u201cWhy would you buy me flowers?\u201d</p><p>Peter was too humble at times, he could save the world and just shrug at it. He never realizes the magnitude of his actions. But you did. You know there was nothing forcing him to show up to the cafe, but he did. When he did, everything fell into place. He just has this aura about him that made you forget about all the bad things and appreciate life for what it is. \u201cFor being an amazing person who deserves the entire world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty, um, sure that\u2019s you.\u201d He closes his eyes grimacing at the hesitation. If words flowed beautifully out of his mouth, he would never shut up about the beauty in everything and everyone.</p><p>\u201cI thought these flowers were to make me happy.\u201d Involuntarily, your heart starts to race again. </p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m going to, going to buy you more flowers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore flowers?\u201d Maybe it was the enclosed space, but the air disappears.</p><p>Peter shrugs, not noticing the way though start to blush. \u201cEnough to fill your entire apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of flowers Parker.\u201d Whatever was happening to you, you didn\u2019t like it. You didn\u2019t like being showered in endless compliments and how Peter was being sickeningly sweet. It felt like your heart was going to explode and every time you looked at him, it made you feel fuzzy. You want to punch him in the face for it. There was no way you can see him in a different light, he\u2019s your friend. A friend that saved your day with flowers, but he\u2019s a friend and all he should be. </p><p>\u201cYou deserve more really, you deserve every flower that\u2019s ever existed.\u201d</p><p>Can he just shut up with the compliments? There is no way you can fall for him, but if he keeps talking you just might. You can\u2019t afford falling for Peter, but you know you\u2019re close to it. He\u2019s always been so caring and kind since you\u2019ve met him and you would be lying if you didn\u2019t think about kissing him one or twice or twelve times, but this time you were dangerously close to falling into him forever. It was different before, they were just random thoughts brought up through teases by friends, but you see it now. You see how you could end up dating him and what the relationship would hold. It would hold sunshine and happy days and endless support. There might be faults, but you didn\u2019t care because you can see it clearly. You can see the good and bad and every time it becomes clearer, the closer you get to the edge. </p><p>The only way to escape this trap, was to stop giving him an opportunity to praise you. So you suck in a breath and switch the conversation around to him with \u201cWell, you deserve those flowers and every single flower that\u2019s going to grow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s way too much flowers.\u201d The elevator doors part and he doesn\u2019t want this day to end.</p><p>\u201cWell, I can start out by buying you a single bouquet before conquering that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you want to buy me flowers though, like um, why me out of everyone?\u201d Peter asks as you fumble for keys. You lead him to your door, but he would know your apartment without your help.</p><p>You look over your shoulder as you turn your keys to see him cocking his head and his eyebrows scrunched like he had no genuine idea why someone would do that. Your heart goes out to him. \u201cFor being you. You don\u2019t see it but you\u2019re the most considerate, caring person I\u2019ve ever met. You\u2019re the embodiment of everything good and right in the world and you have no clue. Who would even show up to my failure of a date with flowers?\u201d As the words leave your lips, you\u2019re both equally shade of red.</p><p>\u201cI, um don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d When your door swings open, you don\u2019t want this day to end you realize. That\u2019s the only thought ringing through your head. Then, you know.</p><p>You\u2019re hopelessly falling for him against every aching bone in your body. He pushed you over the edge and now you\u2019re going be free falling right into him. Maybe it was unconscious before, but now it isn\u2019t. It was brought to the surface against your will, that Peter had your heart. Something was telling you to run away from your feelings, but you can\u2019t. It\u2019s refreshing, like breathing in the scent of spring after a long, cold winter. In retrospect, you should have seen it coming, you simply can\u2019t think about kissing someone and get over it, but you didn\u2019t see it. It hit you out of nowhere. Now the truth runs wild in your head and everything turns in butterflies and summer days. Everything was so good and real. All you wanted to do is hold him and never let go.</p><p>\u201c(y/n)?\u201d Peter says cutting through your thoughts.</p><p>You shake your head, snapping yourself out of your daze, but the epiphany lingers.  Something holds you back from entering and it was undoubtedly Peter. Peter who has your heart. \u201cThank you for the flowers and- everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was nothing,\u201d Peter says with a shrug. </p><p>You turn around, for one more look, one more glance. \u201cIt really meant a lot.\u201d</p><p>Peter wants to do something more for you because that\u2019s what you deserve. All he did was buy some flowers. \u201cI did nothing.\u201d</p><p>You can blame this on the adrenaline later you tell yourself as you lean over to kiss his cheek. He needs to know that this wasn\u2019t nothing. This was everything. \u201cYou mean a lot to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-, you-, um,\u201d Peter stutters out but with a goofy smile placed on his face. His heart was through the roof because you were there and you kissed him. Maybe it was on the cheek, but god help him. You would think he just got married with all of the excitement running through him.</p><p>You laugh as Peter tries to organize his thoughts, but nothing comes out of him. Part of you is wondering if that was the right move, but you know it is. His smile was contagious. It was a smell step, but it was something. \u201cI\u2019ll see you soon Peter. I\u2019ll have flowers when I do.\u201d</p><p>The next time you saw him, you had flowers in hand and a blooming heart.</p><p><i>tagging some mutuals who may like this:</i></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m57JD5arDGPQkxn9DyRK14Q\">@tomshufflepuff</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYFEnb_SCeZM747t7uJ-rMQ\">@hollandsosterfield</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHroWymxnoTn-S5YHqCtLNg\">@theamazingspiderlingg</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mA_6FniXy7X-mooNbpp8r2w\">@honeyccoated</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVnX4d4dUBM-pCa6Wrzic0g\">@marvelousmorales</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzesX_KNlGsq1_o4aOiE2Cw\">@poetrypeter</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mT-x-MTiMyRqYIFlH3Tqb4g\">@princeofsassgard</a> </p>",

But he isn\u2019t here and love feels fake.</p><p>[[MORE]]</p><p>Your attention goes back to your phone that lays face up, illuminating with another text from MJ and Ned. There wasn\u2019t any energy in your body to respond to them, the only text you wanted to read was the one that read Jonah. Of course, it wasn\u2019t there. He was just another guy you met at a random event, who seemed decent enough for you to pursue. </p><p>Your phone buzzes again, your friends empty threats at Jonah weren\u2019t comforting at this point. You just feel so stupid, you should have known that he was some asshole who wanted to mess with your head. Yet, you fell for his simple text messages that made you blush through the screen. You ran your mouth about him to your friends, the excitement in your eyes visible to everyone. MJ would roll her eyes, Ned would excitedly support you, and Peter would just smile. The tables have turned and all they can do is comfort you and drag Jonah through the phone that illuminated the time 12:37, making him an hour and thirty-seven minutes late from what should have been a magical day.</p><p>Something kept you tied down to your chair even if you know you should leave. It was like your pride was holding you down, your mind in refusal that this wasn\u2019t happening. You were delusional, half-expecting him to stroll in with a perfect excuse. He wasn\u2019t even answering his texts. But you held your ground. The poor waiter you had was too kind to kick you out yet and would occasionally ask if you wanted to order, but each time you denied.</p><p>Your eyes were trained onto the fake flowers that divides the table in half. They were screaming color, way too obnoxious for the atmosphere that surrounds you. Noises subdue to the point where you feel out of your body and all you can do was stare down the flowers. You\u2019ve grown so dead to your surroundings that you didn\u2019t even notice the chimes by the door jingle or the footsteps approach you. What you noticed was a voice that cut through your thoughts. The voice that said \u201c(y/n)?\u201d.</p><p>Your hands fly to your face, hastily wiping away the stray tears. Your posture instantly straightens out at the sound of your name, relief washing over. Then it hits you, that voice was too familiar. It wasn\u2019t an unknown voice, it was a voice you know time and time again. \u201cPeter?\u201d.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he says. His focus was on the ground, allowing his unkept hair to flop forward. His hands are behind his back and he\u2019s rocking back and forth on his heels, a slight pink undertone dancing on his skin if you aren\u2019t mistaken.</p><p>\u201cUh, hi. Um, what are you doing here?\u201d you ask. As much as you love Peter, you weren\u2019t fond of the idea of him seeing you in this condition. Though there was this sense of comfort knowing he was right there. </p><p>Peter still doesn\u2019t pry his eyes off the ground, but he grows a shade brighter. \u201cI, um, well you know how you, you sent out the texts. I didn\u2019t want you to be, to be lonely.\u201d</p><p>Your heart melts, he was here for you. \u201cPeter-\u201c</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Peter says thrusting his hands forward. He was holding a beautiful bouquet of flowers that were filled with life. </p><p>\u201cAw, you got me flowers?\u201d you exclaim. You reach over to take them from him, your hands brushing past each other as he hands them off with the lightest touch. The bouquet was abundant with fragrant, whimsical flowers that brightened up the room. </p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d he asks with the softest voice.</p><p>You close your eyes, breathing in the aroma of spring. Your cheeks were straining from the smile that manages to grow. The flowers made your heart blossom that it forgets about the heartache. He brought flowers. \u201cOf course I love it, no ones ever brought me flowers before.\u201d</p><p>Peter wishes he could capture this moment forever. His heart was swelling in size as he realizes he did that. He made that priceless smile appear on your face that he could see despite the orchids and carnations that block the bottom half of your face. Your eyes give it away, they are crinkling in the corners and sparks of joy were dancing in them as you clutch the flowers close to your heart. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat no one has, um, brought you flowers?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMhm, no. I always thought getting flowers was the sweetest thing someone could do. It\u2019s just so classic and romantic, you know? I guess it isn\u2019t that common.\u201d You peer up at Peter who was glowing. He was a god-given gift. \u201cYou should sit,\u201d you say nodding to the empty chair across from you.</p><p>If that\u2019s the way you felt about a simple bouquet, Peter wants to shower you with flowers every day so you can feel that same warmness that made you smile uncontrollably. The love you have for the flowers made Peter want to shield you from the world. You were laying them so cautiously to make sure none of the buds get crushed, it was so pure he can\u2019t handle it.</p><p>\u201cSo, um, how are you?\u201d he says as he slides in to the seat.</p><p>You bite your lip considering the question. You should be disappointed and hurt, which you understandably were. It was like a punch to the gut knowing that Jonah wasn\u2019t going to show up and how the world you built in your head crashed and burned. But then Peter shows up here. He didn\u2019t erase the scarring of the date, but everything seemed to relax back into place like this was always meant to happen. He made the tears dry up and the pain to go away instantly. His presence lifted up your entire mood that you would have forgot about Jonah. \u201cNot sure actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I was on the verge of a breakdown like ten minutes ago, but then you show up here. Then I\u2019m just so happy and content.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOh? I make you happy?,\u201d Peter says wiggling his eyebrows.</p><p><br></p><p>You pick up the menu you\u2019ve been staring out for the past hour to hide the growing blush. You laugh as you kick him underneath the table. \u201cI guess? I don\u2019t know, leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>Peter can\u2019t leave you alone though. That\u2019s the whole reason why he stopped patrolling to buy some flowers and went to find you at this cafe. There was no way he could go about his life when you were hurting. You deserve so much more than disappointment and heartache. You deserve the entire world for all he cares. He needs to let you know that there are some amazing, wonderful people out in the world. The world wasn\u2019t just filled with assholes who would leave you hanging. Part of him wishes that he was originally the one going on the date with you, but that\u2019s besides the point. Even if he wasn\u2019t the guy on the other side of the table, he just has to know that you\u2019re smiling.</p><p>Peter was all butterflies and blooming flowers. He always was around you. He swears that your words sound like the greatest poems ever written and that you were sunshine that could make his days better. He can see the stars in your eyes and he wants to promise you that he\u2019ll always be there for you. He could never get tired of you. There was something about you that made him act like a confident fool. Peter finds himself not caring that he\u2019s embarrassing himself around you, he just wants to see you smile.</p><p>And you were. The aching in your heart disappears with each laugh leaving your lips. Peter just knew what to do to make everything smooth over. It was his stupid puns to making up ridiculous stories for every stranger that walks by to buying you the most luscious flowers. Part of you knew he was putting up his best front to put you at ease, but that didn\u2019t matter. All that matters is what was unfolding.</p><p>What was unfolding was something Peter would love to do over and over again. Time was only marked by the food growing cold and the stream of customers leaving and entering. He was able to make joke about Star Wars and ramble about his theory of Mj\u00f6lnir. Maybe he was overthinking it, but he couldn\u2019t get enough of the dynamic between the two of you. The conversation flows easily, no awkward pauses and there was endless topics to discuss. He just knows that the two of you would work out. Peter wishes that you could stay here forever but lunch has to end eventually. </p><p>You weren\u2019t oblivious to the sparks flying between one another, but you convince yourself that it\u2019s all in your head. This was just Peter, he was the Peter whose been your friend for years. Whatever was happening, you drown out the thoughts and bask in the moment. </p><p>The flowers are back in your hand as you and Peter navigate your way through the crowded streets. He insisted that he would walk you home for a proper ending to this day and you can\u2019t help but smile at his offer. It was a beautiful ending to a tragic start. </p><p>The wind whips around your hair as you ask him, \u201cHey, why\u2019d you buy me flowers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoing full circle huh? Starting the day and ending the day with flowers,\u201d Peter says with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cI was just wondering.\u201d</p><p>Peter looks over to see you using your arm as a shield against the wind to protect your precious flowers from flying away. All he can think about is how adorable you are and he wishes he could do more. \u201cUm, I thought they would make you happy. That\u2019s what they do in the movies too, buy flowers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the sweetest.\u201d A warm buzz fills you up, but that\u2019s what Peter does. He just makes you unexplainably happy. \u201cHey, turn here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard everyone deserves flowers one in their life,\u201d Peter says with a shrug. When he turns the corner and the apartment comes into view, a part of him deflates.</p><p>When you look over to Peter to see him with his hands in his pocket and his face flushing with color. He was precious, he could melt the coldest hearts with those words. He deserves something, he deserves the world. Maybe flowers could be a start before conquering the world for him. \u201cHas anyone ever give you flowers?\u201d</p><p>Peter squints his eyes, partly because of the wind, partly in remembrance. The technical answer would be yes. He\u2019s received dozens of roses and lilies that May would proudly display in the middle of the kitchen. But that wasn\u2019t him. It was Spider-man who got all the praise for saving the city and the reward tended to be a shower of flowers. No one has gotten him flowers for being Peter Parker. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s decided, I\u2019m going to buy you the prettiest flowers ever,\u201d you tell him beaming.</p><p>Peter could feel his body start to burn up at your plan. \u201cYou, you don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhm yeah, but I want to.\u201d The warm air engulfs you as you walk through the doors of your complex, but not before you bump Peters shoulder while he opens the door for you.</p><p>Peters heart lurches. \u201cWell, um, I\u2019m just saying you don\u2019t have to get me flowers just because I got you some. I\u2019m not, I\u2019m not expecting anything in return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but I really love the feeling that it gave me. It made so happy and mushy and stuff. I just want you to experience the same feeling because it makes you so warm and fuzzy and everything in the world seems right.\u201d</p><p>If Peter wasn\u2019t enchanted already, those words would have made him fall for you and you weren\u2019t even aware. \u201cJust from a bouquet of flowers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s kind of specific and weird, but it just does. It makes you feel so appreciated and loved. You\u2019ll understand once I buy you some.\u201d </p><p>When the elevator opens, Peter wishes he wasn\u2019t standing there. All the sides reflect him becoming red from your innocent compliments that made him was to burst. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to-\u201c</p><p>\u201cSomebody once told me that everyone deserves flowers once in their lives.\u201d You rub your shoulder against him, completely unaware of the spell you cast on him. However, you were aware of your heart picking up the pace every time you touched. </p><p>\u201cI guess it\u2019s too late to take it back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup. I\u2019m going to buy you the most amazing flowers and you\u2019re gonna love it.\u201d</p><p>Peter can\u2019t help but face you, even if his face was the same shade of a tomato. \u201cWhy would you buy me flowers?\u201d</p><p>Peter was too humble at times, he could save the world and just shrug at it. He never realizes the magnitude of his actions. But you did. You know there was nothing forcing him to show up to the cafe, but he did. When he did, everything fell into place. He just has this aura about him that made you forget about all the bad things and appreciate life for what it is. \u201cFor being an amazing person who deserves the entire world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty, um, sure that\u2019s you.\u201d He closes his eyes grimacing at the hesitation. If words flowed beautifully out of his mouth, he would never shut up about the beauty in everything and everyone.</p><p>\u201cI thought these flowers were to make me happy.\u201d Involuntarily, your heart starts to race again. </p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m going to, going to buy you more flowers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore flowers?\u201d Maybe it was the enclosed space, but the air disappears.</p><p>Peter shrugs, not noticing the way though start to blush. \u201cEnough to fill your entire apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of flowers Parker.\u201d Whatever was happening to you, you didn\u2019t like it. You didn\u2019t like being showered in endless compliments and how Peter was being sickeningly sweet. It felt like your heart was going to explode and every time you looked at him, it made you feel fuzzy. You want to punch him in the face for it. There was no way you can see him in a different light, he\u2019s your friend. A friend that saved your day with flowers, but he\u2019s a friend and all he should be. </p><p>\u201cYou deserve more really, you deserve every flower that\u2019s ever existed.\u201d</p><p>Can he just shut up with the compliments? There is no way you can fall for him, but if he keeps talking you just might. You can\u2019t afford falling for Peter, but you know you\u2019re close to it. He\u2019s always been so caring and kind since you\u2019ve met him and you would be lying if you didn\u2019t think about kissing him one or twice or twelve times, but this time you were dangerously close to falling into him forever. It was different before, they were just random thoughts brought up through teases by friends, but you see it now. You see how you could end up dating him and what the relationship would hold. It would hold sunshine and happy days and endless support. There might be faults, but you didn\u2019t care because you can see it clearly. You can see the good and bad and every time it becomes clearer, the closer you get to the edge. </p><p>The only way to escape this trap, was to stop giving him an opportunity to praise you. So you suck in a breath and switch the conversation around to him with \u201cWell, you deserve those flowers and every single flower that\u2019s going to grow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s way too much flowers.\u201d The elevator doors part and he doesn\u2019t want this day to end.</p><p>\u201cWell, I can start out by buying you a single bouquet before conquering that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you want to buy me flowers though, like um, why me out of everyone?\u201d Peter asks as you fumble for keys. You lead him to your door, but he would know your apartment without your help.</p><p>You look over your shoulder as you turn your keys to see him cocking his head and his eyebrows scrunched like he had no genuine idea why someone would do that. Your heart goes out to him. \u201cFor being you. You don\u2019t see it but you\u2019re the most considerate, caring person I\u2019ve ever met. You\u2019re the embodiment of everything good and right in the world and you have no clue. Who would even show up to my failure of a date with flowers?\u201d As the words leave your lips, you\u2019re both equally shade of red.</p><p>\u201cI, um don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d When your door swings open, you don\u2019t want this day to end you realize. That\u2019s the only thought ringing through your head. Then, you know.</p><p>You\u2019re hopelessly falling for him against every aching bone in your body. He pushed you over the edge and now you\u2019re going be free falling right into him. Maybe it was unconscious before, but now it isn\u2019t. It was brought to the surface against your will, that Peter had your heart. Something was telling you to run away from your feelings, but you can\u2019t. It\u2019s refreshing, like breathing in the scent of spring after a long, cold winter. In retrospect, you should have seen it coming, you simply can\u2019t think about kissing someone and get over it, but you didn\u2019t see it. It hit you out of nowhere. Now the truth runs wild in your head and everything turns in butterflies and summer days. Everything was so good and real. All you wanted to do is hold him and never let go.</p><p>\u201c(y/n)?\u201d Peter says cutting through your thoughts.</p><p>You shake your head, snapping yourself out of your daze, but the epiphany lingers.  Something holds you back from entering and it was undoubtedly Peter. Peter who has your heart. \u201cThank you for the flowers and- everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was nothing,\u201d Peter says with a shrug. </p><p>You turn around, for one more look, one more glance. \u201cIt really meant a lot.\u201d</p><p>Peter wants to do something more for you because that\u2019s what you deserve. All he did was buy some flowers. \u201cI did nothing.\u201d</p><p>You can blame this on the adrenaline later you tell yourself as you lean over to kiss his cheek. He needs to know that this wasn\u2019t nothing. This was everything. \u201cYou mean a lot to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-, you-, um,\u201d Peter stutters out but with a goofy smile placed on his face. His heart was through the roof because you were there and you kissed him. Maybe it was on the cheek, but god help him. You would think he just got married with all of the excitement running through him.</p><p>You laugh as Peter tries to organize his thoughts, but nothing comes out of him. Part of you is wondering if that was the right move, but you know it is. His smile was contagious. It was a smell step, but it was something. \u201cI\u2019ll see you soon Peter. I\u2019ll have flowers when I do.\u201d</p><p>The next time you saw him, you had flowers in hand and a blooming heart.</p><p><i>tagging some mutuals who may like this:</i></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m57JD5arDGPQkxn9DyRK14Q\">@tomshufflepuff</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYFEnb_SCeZM747t7uJ-rMQ\">@hollandsosterfield</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHroWymxnoTn-S5YHqCtLNg\">@theamazingspiderlingg</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mA_6FniXy7X-mooNbpp8r2w\">@honeyccoated</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVnX4d4dUBM-pCa6Wrzic0g\">@marvelousmorales</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzesX_KNlGsq1_o4aOiE2Cw\">@poetrypeter</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mT-x-MTiMyRqYIFlH3Tqb4g\">@princeofsassgard</a> </p></p>",

Every single second you\u2019re resisting the urge to look towards the door. Every single second your vision become more and more blurry, tears threatening to cause a scene. Every single second you want to melt into the ground and pretend that you didn\u2019t do this. That you didn\u2019t spend hours over agonizing over the perfect outfit and talking about this day to anyone who would listen. Every single second, hope seems lost.</p><p>He should be here. He said he would be here. He would meet you at this small cafe that would mark your first date with him. He told you that he was looking for an actual relationship and how serious he was about it. And you believed it all. You believed that your eyes would meet his and everything would fall into place. You believed that you would somehow fall in love to the scent of coffee and the acoustic music that surrounds you. But he isn\u2019t here and love feels fake.</p><p>[[MORE]]</p><p>Your attention goes back to your phone that lays face up, illuminating with another text from MJ and Ned. There wasn\u2019t any energy in your body to respond to them, the only text you wanted to read was the one that read Jonah. Of course, it wasn\u2019t there. He was just another guy you met at a random event, who seemed decent enough for you to pursue. </p><p>Your phone buzzes again, your friends empty threats at Jonah weren\u2019t comforting at this point. You just feel so stupid, you should have known that he was some asshole who wanted to mess with your head. Yet, you fell for his simple text messages that made you blush through the screen. You ran your mouth about him to your friends, the excitement in your eyes visible to everyone. MJ would roll her eyes, Ned would excitedly support you, and Peter would just smile. The tables have turned and all they can do is comfort you and drag Jonah through the phone that illuminated the time 12:37, making him an hour and thirty-seven minutes late from what should have been a magical day.</p><p>Something kept you tied down to your chair even if you know you should leave. It was like your pride was holding you down, your mind in refusal that this wasn\u2019t happening. You were delusional, half-expecting him to stroll in with a perfect excuse. He wasn\u2019t even answering his texts. But you held your ground. The poor waiter you had was too kind to kick you out yet and would occasionally ask if you wanted to order, but each time you denied.</p><p>Your eyes were trained onto the fake flowers that divides the table in half. They were screaming color, way too obnoxious for the atmosphere that surrounds you. Noises subdue to the point where you feel out of your body and all you can do was stare down the flowers. You\u2019ve grown so dead to your surroundings that you didn\u2019t even notice the chimes by the door jingle or the footsteps approach you. What you noticed was a voice that cut through your thoughts. The voice that said \u201c(y/n)?\u201d.</p><p>Your hands fly to your face, hastily wiping away the stray tears. Your posture instantly straightens out at the sound of your name, relief washing over. Then it hits you, that voice was too familiar. It wasn\u2019t an unknown voice, it was a voice you know time and time again. \u201cPeter?\u201d.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he says. His focus was on the ground, allowing his unkept hair to flop forward. His hands are behind his back and he\u2019s rocking back and forth on his heels, a slight pink undertone dancing on his skin if you aren\u2019t mistaken.</p><p>\u201cUh, hi. Um, what are you doing here?\u201d you ask. As much as you love Peter, you weren\u2019t fond of the idea of him seeing you in this condition. Though there was this sense of comfort knowing he was right there. </p><p>Peter still doesn\u2019t pry his eyes off the ground, but he grows a shade brighter. \u201cI, um, well you know how you, you sent out the texts. I didn\u2019t want you to be, to be lonely.\u201d</p><p>Your heart melts, he was here for you. \u201cPeter-\u201c</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Peter says thrusting his hands forward. He was holding a beautiful bouquet of flowers that were filled with life. </p><p>\u201cAw, you got me flowers?\u201d you exclaim. You reach over to take them from him, your hands brushing past each other as he hands them off with the lightest touch. The bouquet was abundant with fragrant, whimsical flowers that brightened up the room. </p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d he asks with the softest voice.</p><p>You close your eyes, breathing in the aroma of spring. Your cheeks were straining from the smile that manages to grow. The flowers made your heart blossom that it forgets about the heartache. He brought flowers. \u201cOf course I love it, no ones ever brought me flowers before.\u201d</p><p>Peter wishes he could capture this moment forever. His heart was swelling in size as he realizes he did that. He made that priceless smile appear on your face that he could see despite the orchids and carnations that block the bottom half of your face. Your eyes give it away, they are crinkling in the corners and sparks of joy were dancing in them as you clutch the flowers close to your heart. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat no one has, um, brought you flowers?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMhm, no. I always thought getting flowers was the sweetest thing someone could do. It\u2019s just so classic and romantic, you know? I guess it isn\u2019t that common.\u201d You peer up at Peter who was glowing. He was a god-given gift. \u201cYou should sit,\u201d you say nodding to the empty chair across from you.</p><p>If that\u2019s the way you felt about a simple bouquet, Peter wants to shower you with flowers every day so you can feel that same warmness that made you smile uncontrollably. The love you have for the flowers made Peter want to shield you from the world. You were laying them so cautiously to make sure none of the buds get crushed, it was so pure he can\u2019t handle it.</p><p>\u201cSo, um, how are you?\u201d he says as he slides in to the seat.</p><p>You bite your lip considering the question. You should be disappointed and hurt, which you understandably were. It was like a punch to the gut knowing that Jonah wasn\u2019t going to show up and how the world you built in your head crashed and burned. But then Peter shows up here. He didn\u2019t erase the scarring of the date, but everything seemed to relax back into place like this was always meant to happen. He made the tears dry up and the pain to go away instantly. His presence lifted up your entire mood that you would have forgot about Jonah. \u201cNot sure actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I was on the verge of a breakdown like ten minutes ago, but then you show up here. Then I\u2019m just so happy and content.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOh? I make you happy?,\u201d Peter says wiggling his eyebrows.</p><p><br></p><p>You pick up the menu you\u2019ve been staring out for the past hour to hide the growing blush. You laugh as you kick him underneath the table. \u201cI guess? I don\u2019t know, leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>Peter can\u2019t leave you alone though. That\u2019s the whole reason why he stopped patrolling to buy some flowers and went to find you at this cafe. There was no way he could go about his life when you were hurting. You deserve so much more than disappointment and heartache. You deserve the entire world for all he cares. He needs to let you know that there are some amazing, wonderful people out in the world. The world wasn\u2019t just filled with assholes who would leave you hanging. Part of him wishes that he was originally the one going on the date with you, but that\u2019s besides the point. Even if he wasn\u2019t the guy on the other side of the table, he just has to know that you\u2019re smiling.</p><p>Peter was all butterflies and blooming flowers. He always was around you. He swears that your words sound like the greatest poems ever written and that you were sunshine that could make his days better. He can see the stars in your eyes and he wants to promise you that he\u2019ll always be there for you. He could never get tired of you. There was something about you that made him act like a confident fool. Peter finds himself not caring that he\u2019s embarrassing himself around you, he just wants to see you smile.</p><p>And you were. The aching in your heart disappears with each laugh leaving your lips. Peter just knew what to do to make everything smooth over. It was his stupid puns to making up ridiculous stories for every stranger that walks by to buying you the most luscious flowers. Part of you knew he was putting up his best front to put you at ease, but that didn\u2019t matter. All that matters is what was unfolding.</p><p>What was unfolding was something Peter would love to do over and over again. Time was only marked by the food growing cold and the stream of customers leaving and entering. He was able to make joke about Star Wars and ramble about his theory of Mj\u00f6lnir. Maybe he was overthinking it, but he couldn\u2019t get enough of the dynamic between the two of you. The conversation flows easily, no awkward pauses and there was endless topics to discuss. He just knows that the two of you would work out. Peter wishes that you could stay here forever but lunch has to end eventually. </p><p>You weren\u2019t oblivious to the sparks flying between one another, but you convince yourself that it\u2019s all in your head. This was just Peter, he was the Peter whose been your friend for years. Whatever was happening, you drown out the thoughts and bask in the moment. </p><p>The flowers are back in your hand as you and Peter navigate your way through the crowded streets. He insisted that he would walk you home for a proper ending to this day and you can\u2019t help but smile at his offer. It was a beautiful ending to a tragic start. </p><p>The wind whips around your hair as you ask him, \u201cHey, why\u2019d you buy me flowers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoing full circle huh? Starting the day and ending the day with flowers,\u201d Peter says with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cI was just wondering.\u201d</p><p>Peter looks over to see you using your arm as a shield against the wind to protect your precious flowers from flying away. All he can think about is how adorable you are and he wishes he could do more. \u201cUm, I thought they would make you happy. That\u2019s what they do in the movies too, buy flowers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the sweetest.\u201d A warm buzz fills you up, but that\u2019s what Peter does. He just makes you unexplainably happy. \u201cHey, turn here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard everyone deserves flowers one in their life,\u201d Peter says with a shrug. When he turns the corner and the apartment comes into view, a part of him deflates.</p><p>When you look over to Peter to see him with his hands in his pocket and his face flushing with color. He was precious, he could melt the coldest hearts with those words. He deserves something, he deserves the world. Maybe flowers could be a start before conquering the world for him. \u201cHas anyone ever give you flowers?\u201d</p><p>Peter squints his eyes, partly because of the wind, partly in remembrance. The technical answer would be yes. He\u2019s received dozens of roses and lilies that May would proudly display in the middle of the kitchen. But that wasn\u2019t him. It was Spider-man who got all the praise for saving the city and the reward tended to be a shower of flowers. No one has gotten him flowers for being Peter Parker. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s decided, I\u2019m going to buy you the prettiest flowers ever,\u201d you tell him beaming.</p><p>Peter could feel his body start to burn up at your plan. \u201cYou, you don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhm yeah, but I want to.\u201d The warm air engulfs you as you walk through the doors of your complex, but not before you bump Peters shoulder while he opens the door for you.</p><p>Peters heart lurches. \u201cWell, um, I\u2019m just saying you don\u2019t have to get me flowers just because I got you some. I\u2019m not, I\u2019m not expecting anything in return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but I really love the feeling that it gave me. It made so happy and mushy and stuff. I just want you to experience the same feeling because it makes you so warm and fuzzy and everything in the world seems right.\u201d</p><p>If Peter wasn\u2019t enchanted already, those words would have made him fall for you and you weren\u2019t even aware. \u201cJust from a bouquet of flowers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s kind of specific and weird, but it just does. It makes you feel so appreciated and loved. You\u2019ll understand once I buy you some.\u201d </p><p>When the elevator opens, Peter wishes he wasn\u2019t standing there. All the sides reflect him becoming red from your innocent compliments that made him was to burst. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to-\u201c</p><p>\u201cSomebody once told me that everyone deserves flowers once in their lives.\u201d You rub your shoulder against him, completely unaware of the spell you cast on him. However, you were aware of your heart picking up the pace every time you touched. </p><p>\u201cI guess it\u2019s too late to take it back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup. I\u2019m going to buy you the most amazing flowers and you\u2019re gonna love it.\u201d</p><p>Peter can\u2019t help but face you, even if his face was the same shade of a tomato. \u201cWhy would you buy me flowers?\u201d</p><p>Peter was too humble at times, he could save the world and just shrug at it. He never realizes the magnitude of his actions. But you did. You know there was nothing forcing him to show up to the cafe, but he did. When he did, everything fell into place. He just has this aura about him that made you forget about all the bad things and appreciate life for what it is. \u201cFor being an amazing person who deserves the entire world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty, um, sure that\u2019s you.\u201d He closes his eyes grimacing at the hesitation. If words flowed beautifully out of his mouth, he would never shut up about the beauty in everything and everyone.</p><p>\u201cI thought these flowers were to make me happy.\u201d Involuntarily, your heart starts to race again. </p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m going to, going to buy you more flowers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore flowers?\u201d Maybe it was the enclosed space, but the air disappears.</p><p>Peter shrugs, not noticing the way though start to blush. \u201cEnough to fill your entire apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of flowers Parker.\u201d Whatever was happening to you, you didn\u2019t like it. You didn\u2019t like being showered in endless compliments and how Peter was being sickeningly sweet. It felt like your heart was going to explode and every time you looked at him, it made you feel fuzzy. You want to punch him in the face for it. There was no way you can see him in a different light, he\u2019s your friend. A friend that saved your day with flowers, but he\u2019s a friend and all he should be. </p><p>\u201cYou deserve more really, you deserve every flower that\u2019s ever existed.\u201d</p><p>Can he just shut up with the compliments? There is no way you can fall for him, but if he keeps talking you just might. You can\u2019t afford falling for Peter, but you know you\u2019re close to it. He\u2019s always been so caring and kind since you\u2019ve met him and you would be lying if you didn\u2019t think about kissing him one or twice or twelve times, but this time you were dangerously close to falling into him forever. It was different before, they were just random thoughts brought up through teases by friends, but you see it now. You see how you could end up dating him and what the relationship would hold. It would hold sunshine and happy days and endless support. There might be faults, but you didn\u2019t care because you can see it clearly. You can see the good and bad and every time it becomes clearer, the closer you get to the edge. </p><p>The only way to escape this trap, was to stop giving him an opportunity to praise you. So you suck in a breath and switch the conversation around to him with \u201cWell, you deserve those flowers and every single flower that\u2019s going to grow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s way too much flowers.\u201d The elevator doors part and he doesn\u2019t want this day to end.</p><p>\u201cWell, I can start out by buying you a single bouquet before conquering that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you want to buy me flowers though, like um, why me out of everyone?\u201d Peter asks as you fumble for keys. You lead him to your door, but he would know your apartment without your help.</p><p>You look over your shoulder as you turn your keys to see him cocking his head and his eyebrows scrunched like he had no genuine idea why someone would do that. Your heart goes out to him. \u201cFor being you. You don\u2019t see it but you\u2019re the most considerate, caring person I\u2019ve ever met. You\u2019re the embodiment of everything good and right in the world and you have no clue. Who would even show up to my failure of a date with flowers?\u201d As the words leave your lips, you\u2019re both equally shade of red.</p><p>\u201cI, um don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d When your door swings open, you don\u2019t want this day to end you realize. That\u2019s the only thought ringing through your head. Then, you know.</p><p>You\u2019re hopelessly falling for him against every aching bone in your body. He pushed you over the edge and now you\u2019re going be free falling right into him. Maybe it was unconscious before, but now it isn\u2019t. It was brought to the surface against your will, that Peter had your heart. Something was telling you to run away from your feelings, but you can\u2019t. It\u2019s refreshing, like breathing in the scent of spring after a long, cold winter. In retrospect, you should have seen it coming, you simply can\u2019t think about kissing someone and get over it, but you didn\u2019t see it. It hit you out of nowhere. Now the truth runs wild in your head and everything turns in butterflies and summer days. Everything was so good and real. All you wanted to do is hold him and never let go.</p><p>\u201c(y/n)?\u201d Peter says cutting through your thoughts.</p><p>You shake your head, snapping yourself out of your daze, but the epiphany lingers.  Something holds you back from entering and it was undoubtedly Peter. Peter who has your heart. \u201cThank you for the flowers and- everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was nothing,\u201d Peter says with a shrug. </p><p>You turn around, for one more look, one more glance. \u201cIt really meant a lot.\u201d</p><p>Peter wants to do something more for you because that\u2019s what you deserve. All he did was buy some flowers. \u201cI did nothing.\u201d</p><p>You can blame this on the adrenaline later you tell yourself as you lean over to kiss his cheek. He needs to know that this wasn\u2019t nothing. This was everything. \u201cYou mean a lot to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-, you-, um,\u201d Peter stutters out but with a goofy smile placed on his face. His heart was through the roof because you were there and you kissed him. Maybe it was on the cheek, but god help him. You would think he just got married with all of the excitement running through him.</p><p>You laugh as Peter tries to organize his thoughts, but nothing comes out of him. Part of you is wondering if that was the right move, but you know it is. His smile was contagious. It was a smell step, but it was something. \u201cI\u2019ll see you soon Peter. I\u2019ll have flowers when I do.\u201d</p><p>The next time you saw him, you had flowers in hand and a blooming heart.</p><p><i>tagging some mutuals who may like this:</i></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m57JD5arDGPQkxn9DyRK14Q\">@tomshufflepuff</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYFEnb_SCeZM747t7uJ-rMQ\">@hollandsosterfield</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHroWymxnoTn-S5YHqCtLNg\">@theamazingspiderlingg</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mA_6FniXy7X-mooNbpp8r2w\">@honeyccoated</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVnX4d4dUBM-pCa6Wrzic0g\">@marvelousmorales</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzesX_KNlGsq1_o4aOiE2Cw\">@poetrypeter</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mT-x-MTiMyRqYIFlH3Tqb4g\">@princeofsassgard</a> </p></p>",

Every single second you&rsquo;re resisting the urge to look towards the door. Every single second your vision become more and more blurry, tears threatening to cause a scene. Every single second you want to melt into the ground and pretend that you didn&rsquo;t do this. That you didn&rsquo;t spend hours over agonizing over the perfect outfit and talking about this day to anyone who would listen. Every single second, hope seems lost.</p><p>He should be here. He said he would be here. He would meet you at this small cafe that would mark your first date with him. He told you that he was looking for an actual relationship and how serious he was about it. And you believed it all. You believed that your eyes would meet his and everything would fall into place. You believed that you would somehow fall in love to the scent of coffee and the acoustic music that surrounds you. But he isn&rsquo;t here and love feels fake.</p><p>Your attention goes back to your phone that lays face up, illuminating with another text from MJ and Ned. There wasn&rsquo;t any energy in your body to respond to them, the only text you wanted to read was the one that read Jonah. Of course, it wasn&rsquo;t there. He was just another guy you met at a random event, who seemed decent enough for you to pursue. </p><p>Your phone buzzes again, your friends empty threats at Jonah weren&rsquo;t comforting at this point. You just feel so stupid, you should have known that he was some asshole who wanted to mess with your head. Yet, you fell for his simple text messages that made you blush through the screen. You ran your mouth about him to your friends, the excitement in your eyes visible to everyone. MJ would roll her eyes, Ned would excitedly support you, and Peter would just smile. The tables have turned and all they can do is comfort you and drag Jonah through the phone that illuminated the time 12:37, making him an hour and thirty-seven minutes late from what should have been a magical day.</p><p>Something kept you tied down to your chair even if you know you should leave. It was like your pride was holding you down, your mind in refusal that this wasn&rsquo;t happening. You were delusional, half-expecting him to stroll in with a perfect excuse. He wasn&rsquo;t even answering his texts. But you held your ground. The poor waiter you had was too kind to kick you out yet and would occasionally ask if you wanted to order, but each time you denied.</p><p>Your eyes were trained onto the fake flowers that divides the table in half. They were screaming color, way too obnoxious for the atmosphere that surrounds you. Noises subdue to the point where you feel out of your body and all you can do was stare down the flowers. You&rsquo;ve grown so dead to your surroundings that you didn&rsquo;t even notice the chimes by the door jingle or the footsteps approach you. What you noticed was a voice that cut through your thoughts. The voice that said &ldquo;(y/n)?&rdquo;.</p><p>Your hands fly to your face, hastily wiping away the stray tears. Your posture instantly straightens out at the sound of your name, relief washing over. Then it hits you, that voice was too familiar. It wasn&rsquo;t an unknown voice, it was a voice you know time and time again. &ldquo;Peter?&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; he says. His focus was on the ground, allowing his unkept hair to flop forward. His hands are behind his back and he&rsquo;s rocking back and forth on his heels, a slight pink undertone dancing on his skin if you aren&rsquo;t mistaken.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, hi. Um, what are you doing here?&rdquo; you ask. As much as you love Peter, you weren&rsquo;t fond of the idea of him seeing you in this condition. Though there was this sense of comfort knowing he was right there. </p><p>Peter still doesn&rsquo;t pry his eyes off the ground, but he grows a shade brighter. &ldquo;I, um, well you know how you, you sent out the texts. I didn&rsquo;t want you to be, to be lonely.&rdquo;</p><p>Your heart melts, he was here for you. &ldquo;Peter-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; Peter says thrusting his hands forward. He was holding a beautiful bouquet of flowers that were filled with life. </p><p>&ldquo;Aw, you got me flowers?&rdquo; you exclaim. You reach over to take them from him, your hands brushing past each other as he hands them off with the lightest touch. The bouquet was abundant with fragrant, whimsical flowers that brightened up the room. </p><p>&ldquo;Do you like it?&rdquo; he asks with the softest voice.</p><p>You close your eyes, breathing in the aroma of spring. Your cheeks were straining from the smile that manages to grow. The flowers made your heart blossom that it forgets about the heartache. He brought flowers. &ldquo;Of course I love it, no ones ever brought me flowers before.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter wishes he could capture this moment forever. His heart was swelling in size as he realizes he did that. He made that priceless smile appear on your face that he could see despite the orchids and carnations that block the bottom half of your face. Your eyes give it away, they are crinkling in the corners and sparks of joy were dancing in them as you clutch the flowers close to your heart. &ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That no one has, um, brought you flowers?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Mhm, no. I always thought getting flowers was the sweetest thing someone could do. It&rsquo;s just so classic and romantic, you know? I guess it isn&rsquo;t that common.&rdquo; You peer up at Peter who was glowing. He was a god-given gift. &ldquo;You should sit,&rdquo; you say nodding to the empty chair across from you.</p><p>If that&rsquo;s the way you felt about a simple bouquet, Peter wants to shower you with flowers every day so you can feel that same warmness that made you smile uncontrollably. The love you have for the flowers made Peter want to shield you from the world. You were laying them so cautiously to make sure none of the buds get crushed, it was so pure he can&rsquo;t handle it.</p><p>&ldquo;So, um, how are you?&rdquo; he says as he slides in to the seat.</p><p>You bite your lip considering the question. You should be disappointed and hurt, which you understandably were. It was like a punch to the gut knowing that Jonah wasn&rsquo;t going to show up and how the world you built in your head crashed and burned. But then Peter shows up here. He didn&rsquo;t erase the scarring of the date, but everything seemed to relax back into place like this was always meant to happen. He made the tears dry up and the pain to go away instantly. His presence lifted up your entire mood that you would have forgot about Jonah. &ldquo;Not sure actually.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I was on the verge of a breakdown like ten minutes ago, but then you show up here. Then I&rsquo;m just so happy and content.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh? I make you happy?,&rdquo; Peter says wiggling his eyebrows.</p><p><br /></p><p>You pick up the menu you&rsquo;ve been staring out for the past hour to hide the growing blush. You laugh as you kick him underneath the table. &ldquo;I guess? I don&rsquo;t know, leave me alone.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter can&rsquo;t leave you alone though. That&rsquo;s the whole reason why he stopped patrolling to buy some flowers and went to find you at this cafe. There was no way he could go about his life when you were hurting. You deserve so much more than disappointment and heartache. You deserve the entire world for all he cares. He needs to let you know that there are some amazing, wonderful people out in the world. The world wasn&rsquo;t just filled with assholes who would leave you hanging. Part of him wishes that he was originally the one going on the date with you, but that&rsquo;s besides the point. Even if he wasn&rsquo;t the guy on the other side of the table, he just has to know that you&rsquo;re smiling.</p><p>Peter was all butterflies and blooming flowers. He always was around you. He swears that your words sound like the greatest poems ever written and that you were sunshine that could make his days better. He can see the stars in your eyes and he wants to promise you that he&rsquo;ll always be there for you. He could never get tired of you. There was something about you that made him act like a confident fool. Peter finds himself not caring that he&rsquo;s embarrassing himself around you, he just wants to see you smile.</p><p>And you were. The aching in your heart disappears with each laugh leaving your lips. Peter just knew what to do to make everything smooth over. It was his stupid puns to making up ridiculous stories for every stranger that walks by to buying you the most luscious flowers. Part of you knew he was putting up his best front to put you at ease, but that didn&rsquo;t matter. All that matters is what was unfolding.</p><p>What was unfolding was something Peter would love to do over and over again. Time was only marked by the food growing cold and the stream of customers leaving and entering. He was able to make joke about Star Wars and ramble about his theory of Mj&ouml;lnir. Maybe he was overthinking it, but he couldn&rsquo;t get enough of the dynamic between the two of you. The conversation flows easily, no awkward pauses and there was endless topics to discuss. He just knows that the two of you would work out. Peter wishes that you could stay here forever but lunch has to end eventually. </p><p>You weren&rsquo;t oblivious to the sparks flying between one another, but you convince yourself that it&rsquo;s all in your head. This was just Peter, he was the Peter whose been your friend for years. Whatever was happening, you drown out the thoughts and bask in the moment. </p><p>The flowers are back in your hand as you and Peter navigate your way through the crowded streets. He insisted that he would walk you home for a proper ending to this day and you can&rsquo;t help but smile at his offer. It was a beautiful ending to a tragic start. </p><p>The wind whips around your hair as you ask him, &ldquo;Hey, why&rsquo;d you buy me flowers?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Going full circle huh? Starting the day and ending the day with flowers,&rdquo; Peter says with a laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;I was just wondering.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter looks over to see you using your arm as a shield against the wind to protect your precious flowers from flying away. All he can think about is how adorable you are and he wishes he could do more. &ldquo;Um, I thought they would make you happy. That&rsquo;s what they do in the movies too, buy flowers.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the sweetest.&rdquo; A warm buzz fills you up, but that&rsquo;s what Peter does. He just makes you unexplainably happy. &ldquo;Hey, turn here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I heard everyone deserves flowers one in their life,&rdquo; Peter says with a shrug. When he turns the corner and the apartment comes into view, a part of him deflates.</p><p>When you look over to Peter to see him with his hands in his pocket and his face flushing with color. He was precious, he could melt the coldest hearts with those words. He deserves something, he deserves the world. Maybe flowers could be a start before conquering the world for him. &ldquo;Has anyone ever give you flowers?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter squints his eyes, partly because of the wind, partly in remembrance. The technical answer would be yes. He&rsquo;s received dozens of roses and lilies that May would proudly display in the middle of the kitchen. But that wasn&rsquo;t him. It was Spider-man who got all the praise for saving the city and the reward tended to be a shower of flowers. No one has gotten him flowers for being Peter Parker. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s decided, I&rsquo;m going to buy you the prettiest flowers ever,&rdquo; you tell him beaming.</p><p>Peter could feel his body start to burn up at your plan. &ldquo;You, you don&rsquo;t have to.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mhm yeah, but I want to.&rdquo; The warm air engulfs you as you walk through the doors of your complex, but not before you bump Peters shoulder while he opens the door for you.</p><p>Peters heart lurches. &ldquo;Well, um, I&rsquo;m just saying you don&rsquo;t have to get me flowers just because I got you some.

He just has this aura about him that made you forget about all the bad things and appreciate life for what it is. &ldquo;For being an amazing person who deserves the entire world.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty, um, sure that&rsquo;s you.&rdquo; He closes his eyes grimacing at the hesitation. If words flowed beautifully out of his mouth, he would never shut up about the beauty in everything and everyone.</p><p>&ldquo;I thought these flowers were to make me happy.&rdquo; Involuntarily, your heart starts to race again. </p><p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m going to, going to buy you more flowers.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;More flowers?&rdquo; Maybe it was the enclosed space, but the air disappears.</p><p>Peter shrugs, not noticing the way though start to blush. &ldquo;Enough to fill your entire apartment.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lot of flowers Parker.&rdquo; Whatever was happening to you, you didn&rsquo;t like it. You didn&rsquo;t like being showered in endless compliments and how Peter was being sickeningly sweet. It felt like your heart was going to explode and every time you looked at him, it made you feel fuzzy. You want to punch him in the face for it. There was no way you can see him in a different light, he&rsquo;s your friend. A friend that saved your day with flowers, but he&rsquo;s a friend and all he should be. </p><p>&ldquo;You deserve more really, you deserve every flower that&rsquo;s ever existed.&rdquo;</p><p>Can he just shut up with the compliments? There is no way you can fall for him, but if he keeps talking you just might. You can&rsquo;t afford falling for Peter, but you know you&rsquo;re close to it. He&rsquo;s always been so caring and kind since you&rsquo;ve met him and you would be lying if you didn&rsquo;t think about kissing him one or twice or twelve times, but this time you were dangerously close to falling into him forever. It was different before, they were just random thoughts brought up through teases by friends, but you see it now. You see how you could end up dating him and what the relationship would hold. It would hold sunshine and happy days and endless support. There might be faults, but you didn&rsquo;t care because you can see it clearly. You can see the good and bad and every time it becomes clearer, the closer you get to the edge. </p><p>The only way to escape this trap, was to stop giving him an opportunity to praise you. So you suck in a breath and switch the conversation around to him with &ldquo;Well, you deserve those flowers and every single flower that&rsquo;s going to grow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s way too much flowers.&rdquo; The elevator doors part and he doesn&rsquo;t want this day to end.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I can start out by buying you a single bouquet before conquering that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why would you want to buy me flowers though, like um, why me out of everyone?&rdquo; Peter asks as you fumble for keys. You lead him to your door, but he would know your apartment without your help.</p><p>You look over your shoulder as you turn your keys to see him cocking his head and his eyebrows scrunched like he had no genuine idea why someone would do that. Your heart goes out to him. &ldquo;For being you. You don&rsquo;t see it but you&rsquo;re the most considerate, caring person I&rsquo;ve ever met. You&rsquo;re the embodiment of everything good and right in the world and you have no clue. Who would even show up to my failure of a date with flowers?&rdquo; As the words leave your lips, you&rsquo;re both equally shade of red.</p><p>&ldquo;I, um don&rsquo;t know?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo; When your door swings open, you don&rsquo;t want this day to end you realize. That&rsquo;s the only thought ringing through your head. Then, you know.</p><p>You&rsquo;re hopelessly falling for him against every aching bone in your body. He pushed you over the edge and now you&rsquo;re going be free falling right into him. Maybe it was unconscious before, but now it isn&rsquo;t. It was brought to the surface against your will, that Peter had your heart. Something was telling you to run away from your feelings, but you can&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s refreshing, like breathing in the scent of spring after a long, cold winter. In retrospect, you should have seen it coming, you simply can&rsquo;t think about kissing someone and get over it, but you didn&rsquo;t see it. It hit you out of nowhere. Now the truth runs wild in your head and everything turns in butterflies and summer days. Everything was so good and real. All you wanted to do is hold him and never let go.</p><p>&ldquo;(y/n)?&rdquo; Peter says cutting through your thoughts.</p><p>You shake your head, snapping yourself out of your daze, but the epiphany lingers.  Something holds you back from entering and it was undoubtedly Peter. Peter who has your heart. &ldquo;Thank you for the flowers and- everything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was nothing,&rdquo; Peter says with a shrug. </p><p>You turn around, for one more look, one more glance. &ldquo;It really meant a lot.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter wants to do something more for you because that&rsquo;s what you deserve. All he did was buy some flowers. &ldquo;I did nothing.&rdquo;</p><p>You can blame this on the adrenaline later you tell yourself as you lean over to kiss his cheek. He needs to know that this wasn&rsquo;t nothing. This was everything. &ldquo;You mean a lot to me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I-, you-, um,&rdquo; Peter stutters out but with a goofy smile placed on his face. His heart was through the roof because you were there and you kissed him. Maybe it was on the cheek, but god help him. You would think he just got married with all of the excitement running through him.</p><p>You laugh as Peter tries to organize his thoughts, but nothing comes out of him. Part of you is wondering if that was the right move, but you know it is. His smile was contagious. It was a smell step, but it was something. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you soon Peter. I&rsquo;ll have flowers when I do.&rdquo;</p><p>The next time you saw him, you had flowers in hand and a blooming heart.</p><p><i>tagging some mutuals who may like this:</i></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m57JD5arDGPQkxn9DyRK14Q\">@tomshufflepuff</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYFEnb_SCeZM747t7uJ-rMQ\">@hollandsosterfield</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHroWymxnoTn-S5YHqCtLNg\">@theamazingspiderlingg</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mA_6FniXy7X-mooNbpp8r2w\">@honeyccoated</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVnX4d4dUBM-pCa6Wrzic0g\">@marvelousmorales</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzesX_KNlGsq1_o4aOiE2Cw\">@poetrypeter</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mT-x-MTiMyRqYIFlH3Tqb4g\">@princeofsassgard</a> </p></p>",

You believed that you would somehow fall in love to the scent of coffee and the acoustic music that surrounds you. But he isn&rsquo;t here and love feels fake.</p>\n\n</p>",

Peter swung you up to a roof on a building where you could see the view up there. It was surely amazing from there.\u00a0<br/></p><p>You turned your head around when you saw him taking away his mask and smiling at you awkwardly. God, he was such a dork sometimes. Still, you loved him even.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018\u2018What are you doing up so late?\u2019\u2018 he asked and broke the silence as the two of you sat on the edge of the roof watching the amazing view.\u00a0<br/></p><p>You sighed and looked at him with sad eyes.\u00a0\u2018\u2019 Had a fight with my father,\u2019\u2019 you simply him.

But then, when everything has started to calm down, he goes online and tries to find out about all the things he has missed while he was, well, dead. And one of the things leaves him speechless for good five seconds, before he calls Ned.</p><p>\u201cHow dare you not to tell me that the Jonas Brothers got back together!\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think that it was more important than telling you that I\u2019m glad to have you back, you moron.\u201d Ned answered. To be honest, he was already expecting this call sooner or later.<br/></p><p>Peter on the other end of the phone let out a long and dramatic sigh.\u00a0\u201cI missed you too, but Ned, it\u2019s the <i>Jonas Brothers</i>. Who cares about my death when they got back together?!\u201d</p><p>Peter could not see Ned, but he did not need to in order to know that Ned put his face in hand.</p><p>\u201cPeter, I love you and everything our friendship stands for, and i always knew that <i>any road you take, you know that you&rsquo;ll find me.\u201d</i><br/></p>",

They would have all the food around them and eating so much until their stomaches start to hurt.</p><p>I can also totally see them making a bed out of all pillows they can get their hands on, including every blanket in the whole appartment.</p><p>They would talk about everything Star Wars they could think of, including Ned&rsquo;s weird real life connections to Peter&rsquo;s life as Spider-Man.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;If Tony Stark is your mentor, does that make him Han Solo and you&rsquo;re Luke?&rdquo;&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not how it works, Ned.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Also very important: Both of them are not shy at all when it comes to late night cuddling !! Peter would just rest his head on Ned&rsquo;s shoulder and talk about whatever was on his mind that night and Ned would just hug him from the side, trying to cheer his best friend up and giving him the advice he needs. Peter would always return the favour in the same way.</p><p>They are best friends, after all.</p>",
