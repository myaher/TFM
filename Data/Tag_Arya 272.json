She had Queensgate named in her honor.&nbsp;Arya wants to build Castles</p><p>Alysanne was a fierce believer in woman&rsquo;s rights and actively changed societies standards. &ldquo;Alysanne saw no reason why a man should be favored over a woman&rdquo;. Which is something Arya strongly believes in and has even told Jon directly when Arya said a woman is equal to a man.</p>",

I&rsquo;m adding to this growing list with the newly released info on Queen Alysanne.</p>\n\n<p>Arya says she want to build castles. Queen Alysanne did that too. She was also an unconventional Lady, broke the mold and was a free-spirit with a fondness for the North. </p>\n<p>\nThanks to G-Girl95 for pointing this out from George&rsquo;s new book Fire and Blood, we get this cute quote that mirrors Alysanne and Arya so sweetly:</p>\n\n</p>",

However, after he got the wound he told Arya they will take a ship to The Vale instead of going through the Mountains, and during the journey to Saltpans he collapsed because of the wounds.",

If there&rsquo;s ships at Saltpans, we can reach the Vale by sea.&rdquo; <b>His mouth twitched at her</b>, <b>as more blood ran down from where his ear had been.</b> &ldquo;Maybe Lady Lysa will marry you to her little Robert. There&rsquo;s a match I&rsquo;d like to see.&rdquo; He started to laugh, then groaned instead. \u00a0</i>\u00a0</p><p>That mouth\u00a0twitch means he\u2019s thinking more than he is saying, but I don\u2019t think this is about Sansa directly.\u00a0 Obviously, she\u2019s always on his mind, but he has no idea where she would have gone into hiding or how she got out of KL.\u00a0 He makes a joke of Lysa marrying Arya to Robert.\u00a0 If he thought Sansa might be there, I don\u2019t think this joke would occur to him as the older sister has the inheritance claim for Lysa to want such a marriage.\u00a0 There\u2019s the more pressing matter of Arya at hand.\u00a0 He has come to legitimately care about Arya (relating to her trauma and anger), which is why he hasn\u2019t cut is losses and abandoned her.\u00a0 I think the twitch means he knows he is bleeding out pretty badly and there is a possibility he may not recover.\u00a0 He\u2019s seen enough wounds like this in his life, even recently with the dying archer.\u00a0 So he\u2019s probably telling Arya the plan so that she\u2019ll know how to go on without him just in case.\u00a0 To him Lysa is still her safest bet if Arya can get to her.\u00a0 He\u2019s still going to try to make it for both their sakes, but then it becomes apparent when they reach the Trident he\u2019s getting weaker.</p><p><i>When he got the fire going, Sandor propped up his helm in the flames, emptied half the wineskin into it, and <b>collapsed back against a jut of moss-covered stone as if he never meant to rise again</b>. He made Arya wash out the squire&rsquo;s cloak and cut it into strips. Those went into his helm as well. </i><i><b>&ldquo;If I had more wine, I&rsquo;d drink till I was dead to the world. </b>Maybe I ought to send you back to that bloody inn for another skin or three.<b>&quot;\u00a0</b></i></p><p><i> &quot;No,&rdquo; Arya said. He wouldn&rsquo;t, would he? If he does, I&rsquo;ll just leave him and ride off.</i></p><p><i>Sandor laughed at <b>the fear on her face. </b>&ldquo;A jest, wolf girl. A bloody jest.&rdquo; <br/></i></p><p>Yeah, he\u2019s starting to come to terms with the fact that these wounds are serious and this isn\u2019t looking good.\u00a0 He claims this is a jest, but there\u2019s truth there.\u00a0 With his guilt for botching up the first rescue attempt, his learning that he left her to a fate worse than death (in his opinion), I think he feels nothing but despair over Sansa.\u00a0 He blames himself for everything that befell her, even if she got away.\u00a0 So he probably thinks she blames him too for his screw-ups and would never want to see him again.\u00a0 The least he can do for her now is to\u00a0try to save her sister.\u00a0 Without Arya to look out for, I think he would just give up, find some wine, and just drink himself to death.\u00a0 But he decides to use the last of their wine to treat his wounds.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think it can be overstated that Sandor is facing his deepest fear of being burned by having Arya pour the boiling wine into his wounds.\u00a0 He saw Arya\u2019s fear of being alone on her face (no matter that she thinks she would abandon him) and decided to keep going for as long as he can.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</p>",
