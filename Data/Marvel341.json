Until Sam spoke up. </p><p>\u201cSo she was like your training buddy?\u201d Sam asks making Bucky roll his eyes. </p><p>\u201cWell that\u2019s how it all started. That\u2019s how we started to actually get to know each other.\u201d \u00a0he explains\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>The next day you were brought back to the arena. Viper, Metalic, and the Soldier were already in their own cages. You went into yours. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cToday we are seeing how well they can actually fight.\u201d you looked around, seeing full geared agents on the other side of the gate.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re sending in 8 agents to fight with each asset. They will be fully geared and armed. OUt assassins know not to kill. But if they do cross the line. We have tranks pointed towards them to secure our agents safety. How we tell if the agents are out is if the asset hits with a fatal blow, we our looking for percisioun and time for this event.\u201d </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You rolled your eyes. Like any of us would step out of line. We\u2019ve all had our own types of torture that we would be put through if we ever crossed the line. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The first gate to open was Viper\u2019s, she got up making her way out of the cage slowly. You watched her before rolling your eyes she tended to make things a lot more dramatic than they really were. That\u2019s why she was probably the easiest person to win.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Once the 8 agents walked out they started to circle her trapping her in the middle of them. She seemed to study each agent but not making any move of defense. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cFight!\u201d they yelled and Viper sprung into action. She used her small throwing daggers to throw at one of the agents. They were out. One of the agents charged at her which you scoffed at he had all these weapons and he wanted to do hand to hand combat with an assassin? He had to be a rookie. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Once she quickly got him out she moved on to another, using one of the agents who was out and grabbing one of his weapons. He had a longer dagger than her normal throwing ones. She used this to quickly move towards two of the agents. Using another one of her throwing knives on them while she pretended to stab another. She had four more agents left. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That\u2019s when one pulled out a gun and shot. She dodged the bullet and her eyes went wide. That\u2019s when it hit you. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They were using real ammunition. Meaning if you were hit. You could die. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You looked up at the balcony. Only seeing them sitting back and watching. As if the life infront of them didn\u2019t matter. Like your life didn\u2019t matter. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You turned back as Viper looked between all four guys. She pulled out 3 throwing knives her eyes looked up at the balcony. Before she looked back at the agents. She threw the daggers hitting 3 agents. Easily. But now she was one on one with a loaded gun. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You sighed. It wasn\u2019t that an assassin couldn\u2019t win against a gun. Because we easily could. But one wrong move. One mistake. Even the slightest flaw. That could lead to your death. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Viper stared at the agent in front of her. Before she charged. The agent shot and it missed. Another shot, missed. A third shot, hit. It had grazed her shoulder. But by now she was close enough to take him out. You released the breathe that you didn\u2019t realize you were holding. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Viper walked back over to her cage holding her shoulder. You saw the crimson red coming out of her. You looked away. Waiting for your own gate to open. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Luckily you weren\u2019t next. Metallic went next. You didn\u2019t want to admit it but you were getting nervous. Although you wouldn\u2019t let it show. IF you did you would be punished for it. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cFight!\u201d Metallic charged at the man closest to him. He grabbed his arm in a way of breaking it. In fact you could have sworn you saw the man struggle, before Metalic loosened his grip. He grabbed the mans gun and raised it. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDrop the weapon Metallic.\u201d One of the men in the balcony yelled. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Metallic looked around at the other 7 agents before he dropped the gun. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That\u2019s when Whitehall stood up, \u201cMy assassin could have killed those men with their own weapons. I think that should count as taking them all out.\u201d </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHow many bullets did the gun have though?\u201d Faustus asks his voice made you cringe. You hated Strucker but for some reason Faustus seemed to get under your skin. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAgent how many bullets did you have?\u201d Strucker asks. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI had 5 bullets in my gun.\u201d he replied although you could easily tell he was lying, and so could Metalic as he quickly picked the gun up again. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPut the gun down Metallic.\u201d he stared at the gun than at the agent. You heard the sound of a gun being loaded, that when he dropped the gun. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMetallic you need to return to your area immediately you don\u2019t get a score for this event.\u201d with that he walked to his gate walking in as it closed. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLet\u2019s move on shall we.\u201d that\u2019s when your own gate opened. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You watched as the 8 new agents walked in, you stared at each one of them. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cFire Scout get out of your area.\u201d you looked up at Strucker, you hadn\u2019t realized you hadn\u2019t moved yet. You stood up walking out. You lifted your mask over your face. Pulling out your Sai daggers and twirling them around your fingers. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You got to the center of the arena and started going in circles. 3 of them. 3 of them had guns. 2 of them had long knives. 2 of them had no weapons, and one of them you couldn\u2019t tell. Your eyes never seemed to want to leave him. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cFight!\u201d they yelled. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You were about to attack the unknown man but that\u2019s when one with a knife stepped in front of you. It only caught you off guard for a moment, before you were prepared to attack him. Once you were ready you easily got him out. Next you turned back to the unknown man but he wasn\u2019t standing where he normally was. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That\u2019s when a gunshot went off. It missed you but you looked up at who it had come from. Before you charged. Throwing one of your knives at him. It went through his sleeve nicking his arm. That\u2019s 2. You turned to be attacked by the second man with a knife. You used your own dagger to block his. Before you grabbed his arm twisting it so he would let go of his knife. You picked it up quickly pretending to stab him in the heart. Three. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The two with no weapons decided to attack at the same time. You prepared for an attack on each side and you quickly turned dodging ones punch and stabbing the other, before you rolled grabbing your other sai knife. You used that to pretend to stab the other guys back. Five. Two more guns and an unknown. You looked over seeing the two with the gun. But not the unknown. Before you knew it a shock went through all of your body. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You scrame although it was slightly muffled by your mask it was still loud and clear. You fell to the ground, before you forced yourself to turn to face him. He was holding two poles that were used like tasers. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You looked up to see the two guns pointed at you. Your mind scrambled for a solution. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You quickly kicked the man in front of yous legs out from under him grabbing his weapon and standing up. You touched the man but you had to refrain yourself from using the electricity. You scowled down at him. Before turning your attention back to the two men with the guns. You started charging towards them. While they started shooting. You knew you were going to get shot. It was just a matter of where they shot you. If they shot your leg you would fall to the ground, if they shot your arm though you might still have a fighting chance that is if you can push through the pain. So you used the pole to block and shield as many bullets as you could before you were to close to block anything. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The bullet went right into your upper shoulder. You held back the scream this time but you did start to slow down. They both seemed to lower their guns in success, that is until you came back to life charging towards them and using your sai daggers to fake stab each of them. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When you got back to your area your held onto your shoulder tightly. YOur gate closed, you watched as the Winter Soldier walked out, but soon dark spots started to fill your vision, and everything started to fade away. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When you woke up you felt your shoulder throbbing. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAhh.\u201d you stated the sting of the bullet still in there. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThey didn\u2019t take the bullet out.\u201d you looked over to see the Soldier leaning his head back against the wall watching you. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYeah I can tell.\u201d you state shaking your head. Soon your heard him walking closer to the bars seperating you two. He reached his hands through the bars. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d you ask. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cJust come closer.\u201d he states</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo way!\u201d you say trying to backup but the pain in your shoulder made you take a sharp breathe in. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m going to get the stupid bullet out. Now get over here.\u201d once you heard the command, it seemed like an instinct to listen. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Once you got up to the bars, you felt his hand start to lower your sleeve. Until you felt a cool feeling come over the bullet wound. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m assuming your fight went well.\u201d you state, taking in another sharp breath from the pain. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s going to hurt.\u201d his voice seemed unchanged by your statement. That\u2019s when his fingers dug into the wound. You gripped your jeans attempting to hold in your cry. But you failed. Once the sound of pain left your lips he started to pull away from the wound. \u201cNo you need to get the bullet out.\u201d You could feel his hesitation, before he continued. Digging in and grabbing out the bullet as fast as he could. You hissed in pain. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou need something to close up the wound.\u201d he says his rough voice seemed distant. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHey I\u2019m lucky enough to even get the bullet out.\u201d you say slowly making your way over to your bed. You laid down hissing once your shoulder hit the bed. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m going to get something for you.\u201d before you could protest he walked up to his cell door banging on the bars with his metal arm. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A guard showed up obviously annoyed. But once the Soldier seemed to make the request he looked over at you rolling his eyes before walking away. \u201cThe Agents around here could care less about us. They see us as someone that stole their job.\u201d After stating that the Agent walked back in with a bottle of alcohol, and a string and a needle. Once the Agent walked away you sat up quicker than you should have \u201cWhat the heck? I can\u2019t even ask for a glass of water without having half of it be spilt on me somewhere.\u201d </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cCome over here and turn around.\u201d his rough voice commanded. You went back over to the bars, before you felt him lowering your sleeve again. You felt a cold liquid start to go down your back. The sting made you tense and take in a sharp breathe \u201cSorry.\u201d he whispered. You shook your head. Than you felt the needle enter. He worked quickly and this wasn&rsquo;t even that bad of pain. Soon you felt his tie it off. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m done.\u201d he stated walking away. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThank you.\u201d you state getting up, but soon you felt a cloth being wrapped around your injury. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYOu need to keep pressure on it.\u201d he stated, this time you turned and watched him walk back towards his bed. He laid down and closed his eyes. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThank you.\u201d you whispered. Making your way over to your own bed. You laid down closing your eyes. Although for whatever reason you couldn\u2019t seem to fall asleep.\u00a0</p><p>Covert:\u00a0<br/><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mR7vawQ6YMOsodFXfGIscZA\">@imboredsueme</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mV0vZa360zgEyDjGQb1BDAw\">@writingsleepless</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIyjAN_NMZO-f4WJWkbcaXQ\">@writing-in-winter</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw6xrGnJAn4U0AtW2CPrwKw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw6xrGnJAn4U0AtW2CPrwKw\">@slender\u2013spirit</a><br/></p>",

Until Sam spoke up. </p><p>\u201cSo she was like your training buddy?\u201d Sam asks making Bucky roll his eyes. </p><p>\u201cWell that\u2019s how it all started. That\u2019s how we started to actually get to know each other.\u201d \u00a0he explains\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>The next day you were brought back to the arena. Viper, Metalic, and the Soldier were already in their own cages. You went into yours. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cToday we are seeing how well they can actually fight.\u201d you looked around, seeing full geared agents on the other side of the gate.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re sending in 8 agents to fight with each asset. They will be fully geared and armed. OUt assassins know not to kill. But if they do cross the line. We have tranks pointed towards them to secure our agents safety. How we tell if the agents are out is if the asset hits with a fatal blow, we our looking for percisioun and time for this event.\u201d </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You rolled your eyes. Like any of us would step out of line. We\u2019ve all had our own types of torture that we would be put through if we ever crossed the line. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The first gate to open was Viper\u2019s, she got up making her way out of the cage slowly. You watched her before rolling your eyes she tended to make things a lot more dramatic than they really were. That\u2019s why she was probably the easiest person to win.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Once the 8 agents walked out they started to circle her trapping her in the middle of them. She seemed to study each agent but not making any move of defense. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cFight!\u201d they yelled and Viper sprung into action. She used her small throwing daggers to throw at one of the agents. They were out. One of the agents charged at her which you scoffed at he had all these weapons and he wanted to do hand to hand combat with an assassin? He had to be a rookie. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Once she quickly got him out she moved on to another, using one of the agents who was out and grabbing one of his weapons. He had a longer dagger than her normal throwing ones. She used this to quickly move towards two of the agents. Using another one of her throwing knives on them while she pretended to stab another. She had four more agents left. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That\u2019s when one pulled out a gun and shot. She dodged the bullet and her eyes went wide. That\u2019s when it hit you. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They were using real ammunition. Meaning if you were hit. You could die. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You looked up at the balcony. Only seeing them sitting back and watching. As if the life infront of them didn\u2019t matter. Like your life didn\u2019t matter. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You turned back as Viper looked between all four guys. She pulled out 3 throwing knives her eyes looked up at the balcony. Before she looked back at the agents. She threw the daggers hitting 3 agents. Easily. But now she was one on one with a loaded gun. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You sighed. It wasn\u2019t that an assassin couldn\u2019t win against a gun. Because we easily could. But one wrong move. One mistake. Even the slightest flaw. That could lead to your death. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Viper stared at the agent in front of her. Before she charged. The agent shot and it missed. Another shot, missed. A third shot, hit. It had grazed her shoulder. But by now she was close enough to take him out. You released the breathe that you didn\u2019t realize you were holding. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Viper walked back over to her cage holding her shoulder. You saw the crimson red coming out of her. You looked away. Waiting for your own gate to open. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Luckily you weren\u2019t next. Metallic went next. You didn\u2019t want to admit it but you were getting nervous. Although you wouldn\u2019t let it show. IF you did you would be punished for it. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cFight!\u201d Metallic charged at the man closest to him. He grabbed his arm in a way of breaking it. In fact you could have sworn you saw the man struggle, before Metalic loosened his grip. He grabbed the mans gun and raised it. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDrop the weapon Metallic.\u201d One of the men in the balcony yelled. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Metallic looked around at the other 7 agents before he dropped the gun. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That\u2019s when Whitehall stood up, \u201cMy assassin could have killed those men with their own weapons. I think that should count as taking them all out.\u201d </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHow many bullets did the gun have though?\u201d Faustus asks his voice made you cringe. You hated Strucker but for some reason Faustus seemed to get under your skin. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAgent how many bullets did you have?\u201d Strucker asks. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI had 5 bullets in my gun.\u201d he replied although you could easily tell he was lying, and so could Metalic as he quickly picked the gun up again. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPut the gun down Metallic.\u201d he stared at the gun than at the agent. You heard the sound of a gun being loaded, that when he dropped the gun. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMetallic you need to return to your area immediately you don\u2019t get a score for this event.\u201d with that he walked to his gate walking in as it closed. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLet\u2019s move on shall we.\u201d that\u2019s when your own gate opened. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You watched as the 8 new agents walked in, you stared at each one of them. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cFire Scout get out of your area.\u201d you looked up at Strucker, you hadn\u2019t realized you hadn\u2019t moved yet. You stood up walking out. You lifted your mask over your face. Pulling out your Sai daggers and twirling them around your fingers. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You got to the center of the arena and started going in circles. 3 of them. 3 of them had guns. 2 of them had long knives. 2 of them had no weapons, and one of them you couldn\u2019t tell.

They see us as someone that stole their job.\u201d After stating that the Agent walked back in with a bottle of alcohol, and a string and a needle. Once the Agent walked away you sat up quicker than you should have \u201cWhat the heck? I can\u2019t even ask for a glass of water without having half of it be spilt on me somewhere.\u201d </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cCome over here and turn around.\u201d his rough voice commanded. You went back over to the bars, before you felt him lowering your sleeve again. You felt a cold liquid start to go down your back. The sting made you tense and take in a sharp breathe \u201cSorry.\u201d he whispered. You shook your head. Than you felt the needle enter. He worked quickly and this wasn\u2019t even that bad of pain. Soon you felt his tie it off. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m done.\u201d he stated walking away. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThank you.\u201d you state getting up, but soon you felt a cloth being wrapped around your injury. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYOu need to keep pressure on it.\u201d he stated, this time you turned and watched him walk back towards his bed. He laid down and closed his eyes. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThank you.\u201d you whispered. Making your way over to your own bed. You laid down closing your eyes. Although for whatever reason you couldn\u2019t seem to fall asleep.\u00a0</p><p>Covert:\u00a0<br><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mR7vawQ6YMOsodFXfGIscZA\">@imboredsueme</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mV0vZa360zgEyDjGQb1BDAw\">@writingsleepless</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIyjAN_NMZO-f4WJWkbcaXQ\">@writing-in-winter</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw6xrGnJAn4U0AtW2CPrwKw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw6xrGnJAn4U0AtW2CPrwKw\">@slender\u2013spirit</a><br></p></p>",

Until Sam spoke up. </p><p>\u201cSo she was like your training buddy?\u201d Sam asks making Bucky roll his eyes. </p><p>\u201cWell that\u2019s how it all started. That\u2019s how we started to actually get to know each other.\u201d \u00a0he explains\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>The next day you were brought back to the arena. Viper, Metalic, and the Soldier were already in their own cages. You went into yours. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cToday we are seeing how well they can actually fight.\u201d you looked around, seeing full geared agents on the other side of the gate.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re sending in 8 agents to fight with each asset. They will be fully geared and armed. OUt assassins know not to kill. But if they do cross the line. We have tranks pointed towards them to secure our agents safety. How we tell if the agents are out is if the asset hits with a fatal blow, we our looking for percisioun and time for this event.\u201d </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You rolled your eyes. Like any of us would step out of line. We\u2019ve all had our own types of torture that we would be put through if we ever crossed the line. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The first gate to open was Viper\u2019s, she got up making her way out of the cage slowly. You watched her before rolling your eyes she tended to make things a lot more dramatic than they really were. That\u2019s why she was probably the easiest person to win.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Once the 8 agents walked out they started to circle her trapping her in the middle of them. She seemed to study each agent but not making any move of defense. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cFight!\u201d they yelled and Viper sprung into action. She used her small throwing daggers to throw at one of the agents. They were out. One of the agents charged at her which you scoffed at he had all these weapons and he wanted to do hand to hand combat with an assassin? He had to be a rookie. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Once she quickly got him out she moved on to another, using one of the agents who was out and grabbing one of his weapons. He had a longer dagger than her normal throwing ones. She used this to quickly move towards two of the agents. Using another one of her throwing knives on them while she pretended to stab another. She had four more agents left. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That\u2019s when one pulled out a gun and shot. She dodged the bullet and her eyes went wide. That\u2019s when it hit you. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They were using real ammunition. Meaning if you were hit. You could die. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You looked up at the balcony. Only seeing them sitting back and watching. As if the life infront of them didn\u2019t matter. Like your life didn\u2019t matter. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You turned back as Viper looked between all four guys. She pulled out 3 throwing knives her eyes looked up at the balcony. Before she looked back at the agents. She threw the daggers hitting 3 agents. Easily. But now she was one on one with a loaded gun. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You sighed. It wasn\u2019t that an assassin couldn\u2019t win against a gun. Because we easily could. But one wrong move. One mistake. Even the slightest flaw. That could lead to your death. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Viper stared at the agent in front of her. Before she charged. The agent shot and it missed. Another shot, missed. A third shot, hit. It had grazed her shoulder. But by now she was close enough to take him out. You released the breathe that you didn\u2019t realize you were holding. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Viper walked back over to her cage holding her shoulder. You saw the crimson red coming out of her. You looked away. Waiting for your own gate to open. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Luckily you weren\u2019t next. Metallic went next. You didn\u2019t want to admit it but you were getting nervous. Although you wouldn\u2019t let it show. IF you did you would be punished for it. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cFight!\u201d Metallic charged at the man closest to him. He grabbed his arm in a way of breaking it. In fact you could have sworn you saw the man struggle, before Metalic loosened his grip. He grabbed the mans gun and raised it. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDrop the weapon Metallic.\u201d One of the men in the balcony yelled. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Metallic looked around at the other 7 agents before he dropped the gun. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That\u2019s when Whitehall stood up, \u201cMy assassin could have killed those men with their own weapons. I think that should count as taking them all out.\u201d </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHow many bullets did the gun have though?\u201d Faustus asks his voice made you cringe. You hated Strucker but for some reason Faustus seemed to get under your skin. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAgent how many bullets did you have?\u201d Strucker asks. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI had 5 bullets in my gun.\u201d he replied although you could easily tell he was lying, and so could Metalic as he quickly picked the gun up again. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPut the gun down Metallic.\u201d he stared at the gun than at the agent. You heard the sound of a gun being loaded, that when he dropped the gun. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMetallic you need to return to your area immediately you don\u2019t get a score for this event.\u201d with that he walked to his gate walking in as it closed. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLet\u2019s move on shall we.\u201d that\u2019s when your own gate opened. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You watched as the 8 new agents walked in, you stared at each one of them. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cFire Scout get out of your area.\u201d you looked up at Strucker, you hadn\u2019t realized you hadn\u2019t moved yet. You stood up walking out. You lifted your mask over your face. Pulling out your Sai daggers and twirling them around your fingers. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You got to the center of the arena and started going in circles. 3 of them. 3 of them had guns. 2 of them had long knives. 2 of them had no weapons, and one of them you couldn\u2019t tell. Your eyes never seemed to want to leave him. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cFight!\u201d they yelled. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You were about to attack the unknown man but that\u2019s when one with a knife stepped in front of you. It only caught you off guard for a moment, before you were prepared to attack him. Once you were ready you easily got him out. Next you turned back to the unknown man but he wasn\u2019t standing where he normally was. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That\u2019s when a gunshot went off. It missed you but you looked up at who it had come from. Before you charged. Throwing one of your knives at him. It went through his sleeve nicking his arm. That\u2019s 2. You turned to be attacked by the second man with a knife. You used your own dagger to block his. Before you grabbed his arm twisting it so he would let go of his knife. You picked it up quickly pretending to stab him in the heart. Three. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The two with no weapons decided to attack at the same time. You prepared for an attack on each side and you quickly turned dodging ones punch and stabbing the other, before you rolled grabbing your other sai knife. You used that to pretend to stab the other guys back. Five. Two more guns and an unknown. You looked over seeing the two with the gun. But not the unknown. Before you knew it a shock went through all of your body. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You scrame although it was slightly muffled by your mask it was still loud and clear. You fell to the ground, before you forced yourself to turn to face him. He was holding two poles that were used like tasers. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You looked up to see the two guns pointed at you. Your mind scrambled for a solution. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You quickly kicked the man in front of yous legs out from under him grabbing his weapon and standing up. You touched the man but you had to refrain yourself from using the electricity. You scowled down at him. Before turning your attention back to the two men with the guns. You started charging towards them. While they started shooting. You knew you were going to get shot. It was just a matter of where they shot you. If they shot your leg you would fall to the ground, if they shot your arm though you might still have a fighting chance that is if you can push through the pain. So you used the pole to block and shield as many bullets as you could before you were to close to block anything. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The bullet went right into your upper shoulder. You held back the scream this time but you did start to slow down. They both seemed to lower their guns in success, that is until you came back to life charging towards them and using your sai daggers to fake stab each of them. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When you got back to your area your held onto your shoulder tightly. YOur gate closed, you watched as the Winter Soldier walked out, but soon dark spots started to fill your vision, and everything started to fade away. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When you woke up you felt your shoulder throbbing. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAhh.\u201d you stated the sting of the bullet still in there. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThey didn\u2019t take the bullet out.\u201d you looked over to see the Soldier leaning his head back against the wall watching you. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYeah I can tell.\u201d you state shaking your head. Soon your heard him walking closer to the bars seperating you two. He reached his hands through the bars. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d you ask. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cJust come closer.\u201d he states</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo way!\u201d you say trying to backup but the pain in your shoulder made you take a sharp breathe in. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m going to get the stupid bullet out. Now get over here.\u201d once you heard the command, it seemed like an instinct to listen. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Once you got up to the bars, you felt his hand start to lower your sleeve. Until you felt a cool feeling come over the bullet wound. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m assuming your fight went well.\u201d you state, taking in another sharp breath from the pain. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s going to hurt.\u201d his voice seemed unchanged by your statement. That\u2019s when his fingers dug into the wound. You gripped your jeans attempting to hold in your cry. But you failed. Once the sound of pain left your lips he started to pull away from the wound. \u201cNo you need to get the bullet out.\u201d You could feel his hesitation, before he continued. Digging in and grabbing out the bullet as fast as he could. You hissed in pain. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou need something to close up the wound.\u201d he says his rough voice seemed distant. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHey I\u2019m lucky enough to even get the bullet out.\u201d you say slowly making your way over to your bed. You laid down hissing once your shoulder hit the bed. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m going to get something for you.\u201d before you could protest he walked up to his cell door banging on the bars with his metal arm. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A guard showed up obviously annoyed. But once the Soldier seemed to make the request he looked over at you rolling his eyes before walking away. \u201cThe Agents around here could care less about us. They see us as someone that stole their job.\u201d After stating that the Agent walked back in with a bottle of alcohol, and a string and a needle. Once the Agent walked away you sat up quicker than you should have \u201cWhat the heck? I can\u2019t even ask for a glass of water without having half of it be spilt on me somewhere.\u201d </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cCome over here and turn around.\u201d his rough voice commanded. You went back over to the bars, before you felt him lowering your sleeve again. You felt a cold liquid start to go down your back. The sting made you tense and take in a sharp breathe \u201cSorry.\u201d he whispered. You shook your head. Than you felt the needle enter. He worked quickly and this wasn\u2019t even that bad of pain. Soon you felt his tie it off. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m done.\u201d he stated walking away. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThank you.\u201d you state getting up, but soon you felt a cloth being wrapped around your injury. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYOu need to keep pressure on it.\u201d he stated, this time you turned and watched him walk back towards his bed. He laid down and closed his eyes. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThank you.\u201d you whispered. Making your way over to your own bed. You laid down closing your eyes. Although for whatever reason you couldn\u2019t seem to fall asleep.\u00a0</p><p>Covert:\u00a0<br><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mR7vawQ6YMOsodFXfGIscZA\">@imboredsueme</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mV0vZa360zgEyDjGQb1BDAw\">@writingsleepless</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIyjAN_NMZO-f4WJWkbcaXQ\">@writing-in-winter</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw6xrGnJAn4U0AtW2CPrwKw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw6xrGnJAn4U0AtW2CPrwKw\">@slender\u2013spirit</a><br></p></p>",

And all Bucky can dream about is you.</i></p><p><i>Pairing: Bucky Barnes X Reader</i></p><p><i>Warnings: Lil Violence but nothing too bad and some swearing</i></p><p><i>A/n: Sorry it&rsquo;s been so long hope you enjoy!</i></p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://soldat-hail-hydra.tumblr.com/post/173406853928/summary-your-father-was-an-agent-of-hydra-when\">Covert Masterlist</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://soldat-hail-hydra.tumblr.com/post/173408699663/covert-part-1\"></a> <b> &raquo;</b>&nbsp; <a href=\"https://soldat-hail-hydra.tumblr.com/post/173408699663/covert-part-1\">Part 1</a><a href=\"https://soldat-hail-hydra.tumblr.com/post/173408699663/covert-part-1\"></a> <b> &raquo;</b>&nbsp; <a href=\"https://soldat-hail-hydra.tumblr.com/post/173726456418/covert-part-2\">Part 2</a><a href=\"https://soldat-hail-hydra.tumblr.com/post/173408699663/covert-part-1\"></a> <b> &raquo;</b>&nbsp; <a href=\"https://soldat-hail-hydra.tumblr.com/post/173967487908/covert-part-3\">Part 3</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://soldat-hail-hydra.tumblr.com/post/173408699663/covert-part-1\"></a> <b> &raquo;</b> Part 4<a href=\"https://soldat-hail-hydra.tumblr.com/post/173408699663/covert-part-1\"></a> <b> &raquo;</b>&nbsp; <a href=\"https://soldat-hail-hydra.tumblr.com/post/176199593793/covert-part-5\">Part 5</a> <b>&raquo; </b><strike>Part 6</strike></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1ebd2aec7cb7b6fd9327ef7d0e99252a/tumblr_inline_paoog6eIsH1uabb4g_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><br /></p><p>Everybody sat there silently. Until Sam spoke up. </p><p>&ldquo;So she was like your training buddy?&rdquo; Sam asks making Bucky roll his eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;Well that&rsquo;s how it all started. That&rsquo;s how we started to actually get to know each other.&rdquo; &nbsp;he explains&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>The next day you were brought back to the arena. Viper, Metalic, and the Soldier were already in their own cages. You went into yours. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Today we are seeing how well they can actually fight.&rdquo; you looked around, seeing full geared agents on the other side of the gate.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;re sending in 8 agents to fight with each asset. They will be fully geared and armed. OUt assassins know not to kill. But if they do cross the line. We have tranks pointed towards them to secure our agents safety. How we tell if the agents are out is if the asset hits with a fatal blow, we our looking for percisioun and time for this event.&rdquo; </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You rolled your eyes. Like any of us would step out of line. We&rsquo;ve all had our own types of torture that we would be put through if we ever crossed the line. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first gate to open was Viper&rsquo;s, she got up making her way out of the cage slowly. You watched her before rolling your eyes she tended to make things a lot more dramatic than they really were. That&rsquo;s why she was probably the easiest person to win.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the 8 agents walked out they started to circle her trapping her in the middle of them. She seemed to study each agent but not making any move of defense. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Fight!&rdquo; they yelled and Viper sprung into action. She used her small throwing daggers to throw at one of the agents. They were out. One of the agents charged at her which you scoffed at he had all these weapons and he wanted to do hand to hand combat with an assassin? He had to be a rookie. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once she quickly got him out she moved on to another, using one of the agents who was out and grabbing one of his weapons. He had a longer dagger than her normal throwing ones. She used this to quickly move towards two of the agents. Using another one of her throwing knives on them while she pretended to stab another. She had four more agents left. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That&rsquo;s when one pulled out a gun and shot. She dodged the bullet and her eyes went wide. That&rsquo;s when it hit you. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were using real ammunition. Meaning if you were hit. You could die. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You looked up at the balcony. Only seeing them sitting back and watching. As if the life infront of them didn&rsquo;t matter. Like your life didn&rsquo;t matter. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You turned back as Viper looked between all four guys. She pulled out 3 throwing knives her eyes looked up at the balcony. Before she looked back at the agents. She threw the daggers hitting 3 agents. Easily. But now she was one on one with a loaded gun. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You sighed. It wasn&rsquo;t that an assassin couldn&rsquo;t win against a gun. Because we easily could. But one wrong move. One mistake. Even the slightest flaw. That could lead to your death. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Viper stared at the agent in front of her. Before she charged. The agent shot and it missed. Another shot, missed. A third shot, hit. It had grazed her shoulder. But by now she was close enough to take him out. You released the breathe that you didn&rsquo;t realize you were holding. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Viper walked back over to her cage holding her shoulder. You saw the crimson red coming out of her. You looked away. Waiting for your own gate to open. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luckily you weren&rsquo;t next. Metallic went next. You didn&rsquo;t want to admit it but you were getting nervous. Although you wouldn&rsquo;t let it show. IF you did you would be punished for it. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Fight!&rdquo; Metallic charged at the man closest to him. He grabbed his arm in a way of breaking it. In fact you could have sworn you saw the man struggle, before Metalic loosened his grip. He grabbed the mans gun and raised it. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Drop the weapon Metallic.&rdquo; One of the men in the balcony yelled. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Metallic looked around at the other 7 agents before he dropped the gun. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That&rsquo;s when Whitehall stood up, &ldquo;My assassin could have killed those men with their own weapons. I think that should count as taking them all out.&rdquo; </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;How many bullets did the gun have though?&rdquo; Faustus asks his voice made you cringe. You hated Strucker but for some reason Faustus seemed to get under your skin. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Agent how many bullets did you have?&rdquo; Strucker asks. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I had 5 bullets in my gun.&rdquo; he replied although you could easily tell he was lying, and so could Metalic as he quickly picked the gun up again. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Put the gun down Metallic.&rdquo; he stared at the gun than at the agent. You heard the sound of a gun being loaded, that when he dropped the gun. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Metallic you need to return to your area immediately you don&rsquo;t get a score for this event.&rdquo; with that he walked to his gate walking in as it closed. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s move on shall we.&rdquo; that&rsquo;s when your own gate opened. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You watched as the 8 new agents walked in, you stared at each one of them. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Fire Scout get out of your area.&rdquo; you looked up at Strucker, you hadn&rsquo;t realized you hadn&rsquo;t moved yet. You stood up walking out. You lifted your mask over your face. Pulling out your Sai daggers and twirling them around your fingers. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You got to the center of the arena and started going in circles. 3 of them. 3 of them had guns. 2 of them had long knives. 2 of them had no weapons, and one of them you couldn&rsquo;t tell. Your eyes never seemed to want to leave him. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Fight!&rdquo; they yelled. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You were about to attack the unknown man but that&rsquo;s when one with a knife stepped in front of you. It only caught you off guard for a moment, before you were prepared to attack him. Once you were ready you easily got him out. Next you turned back to the unknown man but he wasn&rsquo;t standing where he normally was. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That&rsquo;s when a gunshot went off. It missed you but you looked up at who it had come from. Before you charged. Throwing one of your knives at him. It went through his sleeve nicking his arm. That&rsquo;s 2. You turned to be attacked by the second man with a knife. You used your own dagger to block his. Before you grabbed his arm twisting it so he would let go of his knife. You picked it up quickly pretending to stab him in the heart. Three. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two with no weapons decided to attack at the same time. You prepared for an attack on each side and you quickly turned dodging ones punch and stabbing the other, before you rolled grabbing your other sai knife. You used that to pretend to stab the other guys back. Five. Two more guns and an unknown. You looked over seeing the two with the gun. But not the unknown. Before you knew it a shock went through all of your body. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You scrame although it was slightly muffled by your mask it was still loud and clear. You fell to the ground, before you forced yourself to turn to face him. He was holding two poles that were used like tasers. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You looked up to see the two guns pointed at you. Your mind scrambled for a solution. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You quickly kicked the man in front of yous legs out from under him grabbing his weapon and standing up. You touched the man but you had to refrain yourself from using the electricity. You scowled down at him. Before turning your attention back to the two men with the guns. You started charging towards them. While they started shooting. You knew you were going to get shot. It was just a matter of where they shot you. If they shot your leg you would fall to the ground, if they shot your arm though you might still have a fighting chance that is if you can push through the pain. So you used the pole to block and shield as many bullets as you could before you were to close to block anything. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bullet went right into your upper shoulder. You held back the scream this time but you did start to slow down. They both seemed to lower their guns in success, that is until you came back to life charging towards them and using your sai daggers to fake stab each of them. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you got back to your area your held onto your shoulder tightly. YOur gate closed, you watched as the Winter Soldier walked out, but soon dark spots started to fill your vision, and everything started to fade away. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you woke up you felt your shoulder throbbing. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ahh.&rdquo; you stated the sting of the bullet still in there. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t take the bullet out.&rdquo; you looked over to see the Soldier leaning his head back against the wall watching you. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yeah I can tell.&rdquo; you state shaking your head. Soon your heard him walking closer to the bars seperating you two. He reached his hands through the bars. &ldquo;What the hell are you doing?&rdquo; you ask. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Just come closer.&rdquo; he states</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;No way!&rdquo; you say trying to backup but the pain in your shoulder made you take a sharp breathe in. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get the stupid bullet out. Now get over here.&rdquo; once you heard the command, it seemed like an instinct to listen. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you got up to the bars, you felt his hand start to lower your sleeve. Until you felt a cool feeling come over the bullet wound. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m assuming your fight went well.&rdquo; you state, taking in another sharp breath from the pain. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to hurt.&rdquo; his voice seemed unchanged by your statement. That&rsquo;s when his fingers dug into the wound. You gripped your jeans attempting to hold in your cry. But you failed. Once the sound of pain left your lips he started to pull away from the wound. &ldquo;No you need to get the bullet out.&rdquo; You could feel his hesitation, before he continued. Digging in and grabbing out the bullet as fast as he could. You hissed in pain. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;You need something to close up the wound.&rdquo; he says his rough voice seemed distant. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hey I&rsquo;m lucky enough to even get the bullet out.&rdquo; you say slowly making your way over to your bed. You laid down hissing once your shoulder hit the bed. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get something for you.&rdquo; before you could protest he walked up to his cell door banging on the bars with his metal arm. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A guard showed up obviously annoyed. But once the Soldier seemed to make the request he looked over at you rolling his eyes before walking away. &ldquo;The Agents around here could care less about us. They see us as someone that stole their job.&rdquo; After stating that the Agent walked back in with a bottle of alcohol, and a string and a needle. Once the Agent walked away you sat up quicker than you should have &ldquo;What the heck? I can&rsquo;t even ask for a glass of water without having half of it be spilt on me somewhere.&rdquo; </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Come over here and turn around.&rdquo; his rough voice commanded. You went back over to the bars, before you felt him lowering your sleeve again. You felt a cold liquid start to go down your back. The sting made you tense and take in a sharp breathe &ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo; he whispered. You shook your head. Than you felt the needle enter. He worked quickly and this wasn&rsquo;t even that bad of pain. Soon you felt his tie it off. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m done.&rdquo; he stated walking away. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; you state getting up, but soon you felt a cloth being wrapped around your injury. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;YOu need to keep pressure on it.&rdquo; he stated, this time you turned and watched him walk back towards his bed. He laid down and closed his eyes. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; you whispered. Making your way over to your own bed. You laid down closing your eyes. Although for whatever reason you couldn&rsquo;t seem to fall asleep.&nbsp;</p><p>Covert:&nbsp;<br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mR7vawQ6YMOsodFXfGIscZA\">@imboredsueme</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mV0vZa360zgEyDjGQb1BDAw\">@writingsleepless</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIyjAN_NMZO-f4WJWkbcaXQ\">@writing-in-winter</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw6xrGnJAn4U0AtW2CPrwKw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw6xrGnJAn4U0AtW2CPrwKw\">@slender&ndash;spirit</a><br /></p></p>",
