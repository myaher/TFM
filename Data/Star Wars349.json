&nbsp;Do I know you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;\nyou shook your head, and jerked your thumb backwards, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a droid\nmechanic.&rdquo; &nbsp;She nodded in response. &nbsp;&ldquo;Ah.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Chewie\ntold me what happened. &nbsp;He also told me\nthat you might know what happened to Finn.&rdquo; \nRey frowned. &nbsp;&ldquo;Kylo Ren and Finn\ngot in a fight. &nbsp;He sliced up Finn&rsquo;s back\nwith his lightsaber.&rdquo; &nbsp;You covered your\nmouth with your hand, eyes wide, then moved your hand up to your forehead. &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, no.&rdquo; \nYou said. &nbsp;Rey nodded. &nbsp;You turned your head away. &nbsp;&ldquo;Look, Rey, it was nice meeting you, but I\ngotta go see what&rsquo;s up about this map business.&rdquo; &nbsp;Rey nodded again, and you were on your way.</p><p>When\nyou walked into the control room, you saw BB-8 in the corner of your eye. &nbsp;You walked up to him, and looked at what he\nwas looking at. &nbsp;You looked back down at\nthe droid. &nbsp;&ldquo;BB,&rdquo; you started, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t\nknow when R2&rsquo;s gonna wake up.&rdquo; &nbsp;C3-PO\nthen walked over, and told you that R2 has been in &lsquo;low power mode&rsquo; since Luke\nleft. &nbsp;You nodded, then looked back down\nand the blue and white droid, coming to the conclusion that he was moping. &nbsp;All of the sudden, R2 made a noise, and his\nlights came on. &nbsp;&ldquo;R2!&rdquo; &nbsp;You exclaimed. &nbsp;BB-8 made a chipper beep. &nbsp;R2 then made more beeps, causing 3-PO to hit\nhim. &nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call me that!&rdquo; &nbsp;He said. \nYou chuckled. &nbsp;R2 then rolled out\ninto the main room, and showed part of the map to Luke. &nbsp;You were staring at it, when BB-8 knocked\ninto your legs, rolling past you to get to Poe. \nPoe leaned down, and BB made a series of noises. &nbsp;Poe nodded at him. &nbsp;&ldquo;Alright, bud. &nbsp;Here ya go.&rdquo; \nHe said as he put the other piece of the map into BB-8&rsquo;s compartment. &nbsp;BB-8 then rolled\nover to the map, then inserted his piece, revealing a full map. &nbsp;You stood there, mouth open in awe. &nbsp;&ldquo;Wow.&rdquo; \nYou breathed. &nbsp;There it was. &nbsp;The entire map to Luke Skywalker. &nbsp;Right in front of you.</p><p>You\nall went out to see Rey and Chewie off. \nThey were the ones sent to go find Luke Skywalker. &nbsp;You weren&rsquo;t sure why. &nbsp;You didn&rsquo;t see anything that special about\nRey, but you minded your manners, and kept that information to yourself. &nbsp;You walked up to Rey, and reached out your\nhand to shake. &nbsp;She ignored it, and\nhugged you, which surprised you. &nbsp;You\nhugged her back, and wished her luck. &nbsp;You then made your\nway over to Chewie, who hugged you as well. \nYou grinned up at him and wished him luck also. &nbsp;You all waved at the duo, as they took off in\nthe Falcon. &nbsp;As soon as they were out of\nsight, you made a face of disgust, opened your mouth, and began pulling fur\nout. &nbsp;Poe, who was next to you, bursted\ninto laughter, causing you to hit him. &nbsp;&ldquo;Shut\nup, Dameron.&rdquo; &nbsp;You mumbled. &nbsp;He stopped laughing, but a grin remained on\nhis face. &nbsp;You rolled your eyes, and\nstrolled away. &nbsp;You made your way over to\nBB-8 again, seeing as he was your best friend. \nYou sat down on the ground, legs on either side of the droid. &nbsp;&ldquo;Hey, buddy.&rdquo; \nYou greeted. &nbsp;BB-8 whirred,\ncausing you to smile. &nbsp;&ldquo;So, what happened\nover there?&rdquo; &nbsp;BB-8 then began telling you\nthis dramatic reenactment, including sound effects. &nbsp;As you nodded along to the story, Poe watched\nfrom afar, arms crossed comfortably over his chest, admiring the scene in front\nof him. &nbsp;Leia walked up next to him,\ncausing him to look down at her. \n&ldquo;General.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Commander.&rdquo; \nLeia greeting back, before looking up at him, to you and BB-8, and back\nat Poe. &nbsp;She raised an amused eyebrow,\ncausing a light dusting of pink to come onto Poe&rsquo;s face. &nbsp;&ldquo;What?&rdquo; \nHe questioned. &nbsp;Leia smirked. &nbsp;&ldquo;I think you know.&rdquo; &nbsp;She replied. \nShe then patted his shoulder, and went on her way. &nbsp;Poe let out a breathe he didn&rsquo;t know he was\nholding and looked back at you and his BB unit. \nHe shook his head with a smile on his face, turned and walked away.</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p><b>A/n: </b>&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve been planning something like this for a\nwhile, and just now got around to it because my computer decided it didn&rsquo;t want\nto work.</p><p><b>Tag\nList:</b></p><p>(If\nyou want to be added to my tag list, send me an ask!)</p></p>",

Not coming back when you\u2019re supposed to. I was sent out to Hoth by the General herself to see if there was any remaining supplies from the original Rebel Base. It was one of the most dangerous planets so she sent me, the second in command for the pilots, to check it out. </p><p>Unfortunately, I got caught up with a pack of wampas, who decided that I needed a hard time. I was supposed to be back three days ago, but the ship was a little damaged, thanks to the horrible beasts. So now, I was stuck fixing my X-Wing while my droid mouthed off.</p><p>\u201cYou know, m four? My babes are probably losing their minds right about now.\u201d I suggested to M4-S9. It chirped in agreement then I  slid underneath my ship and stretched my hand out to grab a wrench then snatched it before tightened a bolt that attached to the engine. My droid  beeped its opinion about my over-obsessive worrying about my ship, to which I responded with,\u201dActually m four, you\u2019re right. Maybe I can be a bit paranoid. But do you really want to fall from the sky after one mission when some douche decides that I was in the wrong?\u201d</p><p>It chirped and I rolled my eyes, but didn\u2019t bother responding to its sassy remark.I slid out from underneath my X-Wing and stared up at the droid then asked,\u201dDo you think you can get a hold of General Organa for me real quick?\u201d </p><p>Without another sound, it broadcasted a hologram of General Leia Organa, the queen of the Resistance. She nodded in acknowledgement towards me then said,\u201dLieutenant. Glad to see you\u2019re still alive.\u201d </p><p>Ah yes, not to mention that she was one of the most blunt people that I knew. </p><p>\u201cGeneral, I\u2019m so sorry that I wasn\u2019t able to contact you when I was scheduled to. I ran into some problems.\u201d I apologized, ducking my head briefly in respect. She waved her hand, dismissing my excuse, and said,\u201dI figured. You\u2019re very good at your job, Fox.\u201d </p><p>Fox. My code name, something that everyone knew me by. I was cunning and quick, but still dangerous all the same. </p><p>\u201cThank you, General. I\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d I informed her. She nodded and thanked me for my mission\u2019s success before ending the connection. I was Force sensitive, which was more than likely one of the main reasons why the General sent me out on some many missions. I could scope out the Force users and see if they spoke for a certain side of the war.</p><p>I turned to M4-S9 then asked,\u201dYou ready to go home,m four?\u201d It beeped in agreement and we entered the X-Wing before heading back to the Resistance fleet. Just forty rough minutes later, I was pulling into the base. M4-S9 and I piled out of our ship then it rolled away from me. I pulled off my helmet and set it inside the cockpit before someone said something. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ridiculous.We\u2019ve been looking for you for the last forty minutes! You\u2019re late, a lot later now that you\u2019ve been gone for three days longer than expected.\u201d</p><p>Rey. My best friend and one of my significant others. Rey and I shared a relationship with Finn and Poe. It wasn\u2019t the easiest thing to defend, but when you\u2019re fighting a war against the biggest enemy of the galaxy, it wasn\u2019t the hardest thing to defend either. </p><p>I flashed her a sheepish smile then came to a stand, wiping my hands off on the rag I always kept in my back pocket, a habit that I had started back when I was younger, fighting for my life on Eadu. She crossed her arms and shook her head at me before she stated,\u201dPoe and Finn are waiting for us.\u201d </p><p>I grinned at the information then grabbed her hand before I asked,\u201dWell, why are we still standing here then? Let\u2019s not keep our boys waiting any longer.\u201d She nodded and when I began walking towards our shared room, she tugged on the hold we shared then I stopped, staring at her with questioning eyes.</p><p>\u201cRey? Hey, what\u2019s wrong, lovey?\u201d I asked, only for her to duck her head in an emotion that I was quite familiar with. Shame. </p><p>\u201cI was so scared.. I didn\u2019t think,\u201d she cleared her throat before explaining,\u201dWhen you didn\u2019t come back when you was supposed to, I got worried and kind of panicked.\u201d I smiled and tilted her chin up to make her look at me then I said,\u201dRey, there\u2019s nothing wrong with being scared when I don\u2019t come home when I\u2019m supposed to.  It\u2019s a natural thing to do when you care for someone. Okay?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and I hugged her tightly before murmuring,\u201dLet&rsquo;s go see our boys. You know how impatient Poe can get.\u201d Rey nodded with a small smile and we walked towards our room. </p><p>The door was slightly cracked and I pushed open the door, where Poe had Finn pushed into the mattress, his hand pressed tightly over the dark skinned man\u2019s mouth. </p><p>Finn laced his fingers through his lover\u2019s hair as Poe kissed down his boyfriend\u2019s thick body and I grinned at my girlfriend, who&rsquo;s beautiful eyes was glued to the two men on the bed. </p><p>\u201cYou impatient little fucks.\u201d They snapped apart and Poe grinned at me before he stated,\u201dOur Fox has returned to us.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou started without Rey and I. How dare you? I&rsquo;ve been alone, for the last six days, on a frozen wasteland, and you two are making out.\u201d I said, dropping my hand from Rey\u2019s grasp. Poe came to his knees and started to stand, only for me to force him onto his back. </p><p>His dark eyes widened and I could hear Finn beginning to make up an excuse with a sweet,\u201dI&rsquo;m sorry, Fox, he started it,\u201dbut I cut him off with a quick glare. </p><p>I tangled my hand into Poe\u2019s hair and jerked his head up to force him to look me in the eyes before I leaned down and hissed,\u201dYou just don&rsquo;t know when to stop, do you, Commander?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, Lieutenant, I don&rsquo;t. You know why? Because I&rsquo;m your superior and I don&rsquo;t take orders from you.\u201d he barked, getting in my face. A smirk worked its way onto my lips and I turned to Rey then called,\u201dLovey, would you mind doing something for me real quick?\u201d </p><p>I watched as her head bobbed up and down eagerly in response then I asked,\u201dHand me my cuffs. I think Commander Dameron needs to be reminded of who runs this show in the bedroom.\u201d </p><p>Her eyes lit up at the thought of punishing the ever mouthy Poe. She rushed to grab what I asked her to get then Finn molded himself to me and murmured,\u201dPlease don&rsquo;t be too rough on him.He&rsquo;s been punishing himself all week since you had to go alone.\u201d </p><p>I turned to Poe, who looked defiant, yet ready to surrender to my every whim, then asked,\u201dIs this true, baby boy? Do you feel bad about me going in alone?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou know I fucking hate when they pull that shit over you, Fox. It&rsquo;s dangerous.\u201d he hissed, eyes dilating in anger and lust. </p><p>I gripped his jaw at the use of his curse words and snapped,\u201dI thought I told you not to use those fucking words,Dameron.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd I thought I told you to fuck off when you said that.\u201d</p><p>I pulled away then turned to Finn, who was watching anxiously between the two of us. It was constantly a power struggle between Poe and I, only because my boyfriend had a giant ego that he didn&rsquo;t know how to rein in at times. </p><p>The truth was that Poe knew that I owned his ass in the bedroom. Only on rare occasions would I give up the power to one of my lovers. </p><p>\u201cFox. I have the cuffs.\u201d Rey announced, climbing on the bed. A grin marked my lips and I turned to my girlfriend before pulling her to me. She squeaked softly and I caught the sound with my mouth, kissing her roughly. </p><p>She moaned as I nipped at her bottom lip then I twisted my fingers through her hair, pulling her harder against me. I slipped my free hand up her shirt and she gasped as my cold fingers found her nipple. </p><p>Finn whimpered softly and I pulled away from the kiss, turning to my boyfriend. I smiled gently at me then handed him the cuffs before I stated,\u201dGo bind that sassy fuck.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThis sassy fuck can hear you.\u201d Poe snapped, earning my attention. I turned and grinned at him before I traced his scruffy jawline with a single fingernail. He leaned into the scratch then I gripped his jawline tightly, leaning into him, before I kissed him. </p><p>He followed my lead, licking and nipping at my lips to try and gain access, only for me to bite down harshly. I drug my canines across the inside of his lip and he jerked back, blood dribbling down the corner of his mouth.</p><p>He swore out and his dark eyes narrowed at me then I said,\u201dDon&rsquo;t have anything sassy to say now, do you?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou bite like a fucking girl.\u201d he spat, eyes flashing wildly. I grinned and leaned closer to him as I chirped,\u201dWhy, thank you!\u201d </p><p>Rey grabbed my arm then pulled me closer and murmured,\u201dMaybe you should\u2026\u201d She trailed off and turned her eyes towards Finn who just finished binding Poe&rsquo;s hands to the headboard. </p><p>I tilted her head up to meet her eyes then murmured,\u201dI can&rsquo;t do what you want unless you tell me, lovey.\u201d She smiled gently at me then suggested,\u201dWhy don&rsquo;t you sit on his face and let him eat you out?\u201d </p><p>A rough groan was shared between our boyfriends and I grinned with my girlfriend then stated,\u201dI think they like that plan.\u201d </p><p>\u201cLook at you, Fox. Of course I like that plan. I mean, Poe\u2019s mouth is heaven.\u201d Finn informed me. I smiled and pulled my darker skinned lover into a kiss, one that was hard and slow, and his finger sought out the zipper on my flight suit then drug it down. </p><p>Rey&rsquo;s nimble fingers twisted at the shoulders of my suit then pulled it down my arms and I locked eyes with Poe as my bare breasts was revealed. </p><p>A quiet growl left his clever mouth and my head fell backwards as Finn fastened his lips to my nipple, flicking his tongue across the bud. I moaned and wrapped an arm around the back of my boyfriend\u2019s neck, his fingers fidgeting with my other nipple. </p><p>Rey bit gently into the skin of my shoulder then her fingers roamed towards my cunt hidden by the rest of my flight suit. My eyes locked with Poe\u2019s as our girlfriend sought out my clit then I gasped out,\u201dShe&rsquo;s so good at this, Commander. All small and talented fingers. She&rsquo;s learned well. My cunt is so wet and tight and ready for her.\u201d </p><p>Rey laughed softly then licked my earlobe, drawing into her devilous mouth and whispered as she admitted,\u201dThe boys have tried hard to teach me what to do.\u201d I tilted Finn\u2019s head up to meet his eyes and he stated,\u201dShe&rsquo;s an eager learner, Lieutenant. And she&rsquo;s very fun to teach.\u201d </p><p>I went to reply, only to cry out as he nipped at my breasts, sucking in the skin tightly. He held it there for a moment or two, running his tongue over the bruise he was leaving, then let go. </p><p>Rey leaned closer and her fingers ran through my slick before sliding a finger inside. We moaned in sync as she babbled,\u201dYou&rsquo;re so wet and you feel so good. Can I taste please, please,let me taste?\u201d </p><p>\u201cGo ahead, taste what belongs to you.\u201d She whimpered and Finn pulled away, dragging the rest of my flight suit down my body, freeing my heated skin from the outfit. He laid me back and I sought out the button on his pants, tugging them down his legs. </p><p>His cock jumped then nearly slapped his stomach with how quickly I pulled down his jeans and I nearly purred at the sight. He was perfectly thick and long, not too much of either. He had a beautiful cock. </p><p>I leaned forward and kitten licked the head as Rey bent her head, licking timidly at my entrance. I mewled and tangled my hand through her hair as I murmured,\u201dThat&rsquo;s so good, love. Go on, tell the Commander how good I taste.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTastes so good,Commander, oh my stars!\u201d she moaned, eyes blinking widely up at me. I tugged at her hair then ordered,\u201dDon\u2019t you dare think about teasing me. She shook her head, tongue lingering at my entrance, then murmured,\u201dI&rsquo;d never tease,Fox, never.\u201d </p><p>Finn let out a breathy chuckle then asked,\u201dWhat about this morning?\u201d I glanced down at my girlfriend and cupped her cheek, asking,\u201dDid you tease Finn?\u201d </p><p>She gave me a shameless grin and replied,\u201dIt was just so tempting and he responds so well.\u201d I tangled my fingers in her hair as she gave another timid lick to my clit and sucked the bud into her mouth, biting down softly. My hips jerked into her then she moaned, flicking her tongue faster. </p><p>\u201cI thought you was going to sit on my face, Princess? What\u2019s the matter, you gonna pussy out on me?\u201d Poe mocked, raising an eyebrow at me. My eyes flew open and over to him where he smirked in return, happy to see that he had caught my attention. </p><p>\u201cYou smug little fuck.\u201d I bit out as Rey moved away from me. He full out grinned then said,\u201dCome on, Fox, come let me eat that sweet little pussy like a good girl would.\u201d </p><p>I shivered at his words and straddled his face, fingers gripping the bars of the headboard as I slowly lowered myself down. Poe quickly pressed his mouth into my pussy, his tongue working over my clit quickly, humming with delight while he worked me over. </p><p>My eyes fluttered open and I turned my head to find Finn and Rey entertaining one another. Her nimble fingers wrapped around his cock and began stroking him towards his orgasm. </p><p>\u201cGo on, lovely, sink down on that gorgeous dick. Wear him out because when I\u2019m done with the Commander, I think we\u2019re going to take a nap.\u201d I encouraged, my head tilting back as my lover worked me closer to the edge. </p><p>\u201cCmon, Fox, come on my face then you can fuck me.\u201d Poe murmured, the vibrations making me jerk against his clever mouth. </p><p>\u201cOh my Stars!\u201d I cried out, rocking faster as I started to come. I slowly rolled off of his face and he nodded his head towards his straining cock as he mutter,\u201dGo on, doll face, show me who\u2019s boss.\u201d </p><p>I shuffled down on my knees then gave the tip of his dick a couple quick licks, making him jolt at the timid touches. </p><p>But to bring myself and my lover to our orgasms, I finally straddled his hips, gripping the base of his member to lead him to my entrance. Slowly I sunk down on him, my head leaning forward onto his bare chest where I licked and nibbled my way up to his neck, slowly beginning to ride him faster and faster. </p><p>\u201cYeah, get that dick, baby. C\u2019mon, you wanna be boss, you gotta work better than that.\u201d Poe taunted, though his breath getting more and more ragged told me the truth. I was doing exactly what I wanted to. </p><p>\u201cMy Stars, you feel so good.\u201d I moaned, eyes locking with Rey, who was attempting to keep her gaze on me while Finn fucked her senselessly. </p><p>\u201cGood boy, Finny. Go on, make our lovely come so hard she won\u2019t forget your name.\u201d I ordered, starting to roll my hips faster against Poe\u2019s. I watched with intense eyes as my other lovers started to come, moans and grunts mixing together. </p><p>Finally, Poe began bucking into me, the base of his cock brushing my clit just enough to bring me towards the edge. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good girl, Fox, come on, come with me.\u201dhe insisted, panting. My body fell forward as we finished coming together then I reached my hand over sleepily, grabbing the key for his cuffs from the bedside drawer. I unlocked him and his arms curled around me as Finn handed me a clean, damp cloth to clean us up with. </p><p>\u201cSo, everything went okay then?\u201d Poe asked as our significant others curled into us. I sighed then cuddled against him as I replied,\u201dYeah, as okay as it\u2019ll go on Hoth, I guess.\u201d </p><p>He nodded and Finn said,\u201dWell, the important part is that you came him to us safe and without any missing body parts. Now, I believe that I was promised a nap once you were done with our Commander.\u201d Rey nodded tiredly, her head dipping onto Poe\u2019s chest, as she murmured,\u201dA nap sounds so good.\u201d </p><p>A knock is what woke me up the next morning. Poe was sprawled across my legs, curled into me, while Rey rested her head in Finn\u2019s lap, and Finn curled his left arm underneath my head. I unfortunately had to wake them all up in order for me to greet the person on the other side of the door. </p><p>I scooped up Poe\u2019s shirt and pulled it over my head before I approached the door.When I opened it, I felt a sense of dread slam into me. There stood General Organa and her face told me all. I was leaving again. </p><p>\u201cGeneral,please-\u201d Finn started, sitting up. He was the first to realize what was going on. She smiled sadly, her eyes reading what I knew she felt. She felt horrible for sending me out. </p><p>\u201cFinn, if I had a choice, I wouldn&rsquo;t send her away so soon,but the First Order has been sighted near our ship and we need someone to scope it out. We would send Poe, but he&rsquo;s a hot head. Fox is our only option.\u201dshe insisted, turning towards me. I nodded slightly in understanding before Poe snapped,\u201dNo. Why the hell does Fox have to be the one to do it? There\u2019s plenty of pilots qualified enough to do what you want her to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCommander, don&rsquo;t start with me. I&rsquo;m not happy about it either. Fox, please be ready in the next half hour.\u201d she said, turning towards me. I nodded and she walked away, leaving me alone with my partners. </p><p>Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Rey bury her head in her hands and she sobbed quietly. I turned to Poe and Finn who exchanged unsettled looks before I walked to my girlfriend. </p><p>I pulled her hands away from her face then forced her to look up at me before I kissed her gently. As I pulled away, she crushed me into a hug, sniffling quietly. </p><p>Poe met my eyes with a hard look and I glanced away. Poe always had the hardest time when I left. He hated that I usually went out alone and he knew that he belonged with me on the mission, watching my back. </p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m so sorry.\u201d I murmured, turning towards my lovers. I pulled Poe\u2019s shirt off and headed towards the bathroom. With a quick five minute shower, the smell of sex was cleared from my body and I was dressed for my latest mission. </p><p>I exited the restroom and there stood my significant others, dressed for the day. Rey&rsquo;s hair was done in the usual style and I smiled gently at the sight of them.</p><p>I hugged her tightly then murmured,\u201dI&rsquo;ll be back before you know I&rsquo;m gone.\u201d She nodded gently but the moment of her hesitation told me exactly what was going on. She wasn&rsquo;t sure that I&rsquo;d be back as soon as I want to be. I kissed Finn softly then he pulled away, brushing my hair out of my face as he stated,\u201dBe safe, please.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf course I will.\u201d And finally, I turned to Poe, who was burning a hole into the wall. I laughed and asked,\u201dWhat&rsquo;d that wall do to you? It&rsquo;s not the one sending me away.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, but I can&rsquo;t exactly glare at the General now can I?\u201d he spat, turning his attention to me. I blinked slowly then raised an eyebrow at him before I said,\u201dWithout me, you&rsquo;d be the one getting sent out constantly to watch the Rebellion\u2019s ass. I will be back, Poe. You know I will.\u201d </p><p>He nodded slowly then tangled his hand through my hair, bringing me into a kiss. I pulled away after a few moments then gave a last nod to my lovers before joining the General by my X-Wing. </p><p>\u201cGeneral, I&rsquo;m ready to go.\u201d I informed her, tightening my hands into fists behind my back. She smiled at me and I could tell that she wanted to say something to me, an apology perhaps, but she never said a word. In fact, she just handed me a small map and walked away. </p><p>I unrolled it and realized that it was no ordinary map. It was a map of the First Order&rsquo;s ship. At the corner of the paper,the General had written something for me in fine print. </p><p><i>\u201cFox, I understand that you just returned but we need you to do this. If you are captured, and I fear that you will be, this is a map of the Supremacy. The rooms are labeled and it will guide you to the ships that they have. You are to do a simple perimeter check if you will, around our ship. Please be safe. -General Leia Organa.\u201d </i></p><p>I looked up and realized that M4-S9 wasn&rsquo;t in my X-Wing then it hit me. I was really going in alone. There was something that the General wasn&rsquo;t telling me, but if it&rsquo;s too dangerous to take my droid with me, then it was definitely too dangerous to take my hot headed boyfriend along for the ride. </p><p>I took a deep breath then entered my X-Wing, securing everything in its proper place, and stuffed the map inside of my boot, since no one checks shoes, before starting up my ship. </p><p>I did a perimeter check around our ship, just as the General ordered, but when I started heading towards the hanger doors, that\u2019s when I saw it. The Supremacy, right in front of my face. I took a deep breath then muttered to myself,\u201dI can\u2019t believe that I\u2019m going to do this.\u201d</p><p>Their hanger doors were wide open and it was so easy to get in. I could get in and out without anyone noticing. I could get more information than anyone else had ever gotten from the First Order. I could change the course of the war. I stepped out of my X-Wing and glanced around, being as careful as possible, then I hurried towards the door that I thought led out of the hanger. </p><p>But that didn\u2019t exactly work out. Someone slammed something into the back of my head and I fell face forward on to the floor. </p><p>When I woke, that\u2019s when I realized that I had really fucked up. My wrists were restrained by chains and I could feel the Force in the room. It was thick and heady. I turned to look around and groaned as pain jolted through my head then someone stated,\u201dDo not even think about escaping. There\u2019s no point. Even if you do get out of the chains, you have no idea how to get around this ship.\u201d </p><p>I glanced up slowly when the person emerged from the dark and I lowered my head as it hit me. I was Kylo Ren\u2019s prisoner. And no one knew about it either. </p>",

Not coming back when you\u2019re supposed to. I was sent out to Hoth by the General herself to see if there was any remaining supplies from the original Rebel Base. It was one of the most dangerous planets so she sent me, the second in command for the pilots, to check it out. </p><p>Unfortunately, I got caught up with a pack of wampas, who decided that I needed a hard time. I was supposed to be back three days ago, but the ship was a little damaged, thanks to the horrible beasts. So now, I was stuck fixing my X-Wing while my droid mouthed off.</p><p>\u201cYou know, m four? My babes are probably losing their minds right about now.\u201d I suggested to M4-S9. It chirped in agreement then I  slid underneath my ship and stretched my hand out to grab a wrench then snatched it before tightened a bolt that attached to the engine. My droid  beeped its opinion about my over-obsessive worrying about my ship, to which I responded with,\u201dActually m four, you\u2019re right. Maybe I can be a bit paranoid. But do you really want to fall from the sky after one mission when some douche decides that I was in the wrong?\u201d</p><p>It chirped and I rolled my eyes, but didn\u2019t bother responding to its sassy remark.I slid out from underneath my X-Wing and stared up at the droid then asked,\u201dDo you think you can get a hold of General Organa for me real quick?\u201d </p><p>Without another sound, it broadcasted a hologram of General Leia Organa, the queen of the Resistance. She nodded in acknowledgement towards me then said,\u201dLieutenant. Glad to see you\u2019re still alive.\u201d </p><p>Ah yes, not to mention that she was one of the most blunt people that I knew. </p><p>\u201cGeneral, I\u2019m so sorry that I wasn\u2019t able to contact you when I was scheduled to. I ran into some problems.\u201d I apologized, ducking my head briefly in respect. She waved her hand, dismissing my excuse, and said,\u201dI figured. You\u2019re very good at your job, Fox.\u201d </p><p>Fox. My code name, something that everyone knew me by. I was cunning and quick, but still dangerous all the same. </p><p>\u201cThank you, General. I\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d I informed her. She nodded and thanked me for my mission\u2019s success before ending the connection. I was Force sensitive, which was more than likely one of the main reasons why the General sent me out on some many missions. I could scope out the Force users and see if they spoke for a certain side of the war.</p><p>I turned to M4-S9 then asked,\u201dYou ready to go home,m four?\u201d It beeped in agreement and we entered the X-Wing before heading back to the Resistance fleet. Just forty rough minutes later, I was pulling into the base. M4-S9 and I piled out of our ship then it rolled away from me. I pulled off my helmet and set it inside the cockpit before someone said something. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ridiculous.We\u2019ve been looking for you for the last forty minutes! You\u2019re late, a lot later now that you\u2019ve been gone for three days longer than expected.\u201d</p><p>Rey. My best friend and one of my significant others. Rey and I shared a relationship with Finn and Poe. It wasn\u2019t the easiest thing to defend, but when you\u2019re fighting a war against the biggest enemy of the galaxy, it wasn\u2019t the hardest thing to defend either. </p><p>I flashed her a sheepish smile then came to a stand, wiping my hands off on the rag I always kept in my back pocket, a habit that I had started back when I was younger, fighting for my life on Eadu. She crossed her arms and shook her head at me before she stated,\u201dPoe and Finn are waiting for us.\u201d </p><p>I grinned at the information then grabbed her hand before I asked,\u201dWell, why are we still standing here then? Let\u2019s not keep our boys waiting any longer.\u201d She nodded and when I began walking towards our shared room, she tugged on the hold we shared then I stopped, staring at her with questioning eyes.</p><p>\u201cRey? Hey, what\u2019s wrong, lovey?\u201d I asked, only for her to duck her head in an emotion that I was quite familiar with. Shame. </p><p>\u201cI was so scared.. I didn\u2019t think,\u201d she cleared her throat before explaining,\u201dWhen you didn\u2019t come back when you was supposed to, I got worried and kind of panicked.\u201d I smiled and tilted her chin up to make her look at me then I said,\u201dRey, there\u2019s nothing wrong with being scared when I don\u2019t come home when I\u2019m supposed to.  It\u2019s a natural thing to do when you care for someone. Okay?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and I hugged her tightly before murmuring,\u201dLet\u2019s go see our boys. You know how impatient Poe can get.\u201d Rey nodded with a small smile and we walked towards our room. </p><p>The door was slightly cracked and I pushed open the door, where Poe had Finn pushed into the mattress, his hand pressed tightly over the dark skinned man\u2019s mouth. </p><p>Finn laced his fingers through his lover\u2019s hair as Poe kissed down his boyfriend\u2019s thick body and I grinned at my girlfriend, who\u2019s beautiful eyes was glued to the two men on the bed. </p><p>\u201cYou impatient little fucks.\u201d They snapped apart and Poe grinned at me before he stated,\u201dOur Fox has returned to us.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou started without Rey and I. How dare you? I\u2019ve been alone, for the last six days, on a frozen wasteland, and you two are making out.\u201d I said, dropping my hand from Rey\u2019s grasp. Poe came to his knees and started to stand, only for me to force him onto his back. </p><p>His dark eyes widened and I could hear Finn beginning to make up an excuse with a sweet,\u201dI\u2019m sorry, Fox, he started it,\u201dbut I cut him off with a quick glare. </p><p>I tangled my hand into Poe\u2019s hair and jerked his head up to force him to look me in the eyes before I leaned down and hissed,\u201dYou just don\u2019t know when to stop, do you, Commander?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, Lieutenant, I don\u2019t. You know why? Because I\u2019m your superior and I don\u2019t take orders from you.\u201d he barked, getting in my face. A smirk worked its way onto my lips and I turned to Rey then called,\u201dLovey, would you mind doing something for me real quick?\u201d </p><p>I watched as her head bobbed up and down eagerly in response then I asked,\u201dHand me my cuffs. I think Commander Dameron needs to be reminded of who runs this show in the bedroom.\u201d </p><p>Her eyes lit up at the thought of punishing the ever mouthy Poe. She rushed to grab what I asked her to get then Finn molded himself to me and murmured,\u201dPlease don\u2019t be too rough on him.He\u2019s been punishing himself all week since you had to go alone.\u201d </p><p>I turned to Poe, who looked defiant, yet ready to surrender to my every whim, then asked,\u201dIs this true, baby boy? Do you feel bad about me going in alone?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou know I fucking hate when they pull that shit over you, Fox. It\u2019s dangerous.\u201d he hissed, eyes dilating in anger and lust. </p><p>I gripped his jaw at the use of his curse words and snapped,\u201dI thought I told you not to use those fucking words,Dameron.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd I thought I told you to fuck off when you said that.\u201d</p><p>I pulled away then turned to Finn, who was watching anxiously between the two of us. It was constantly a power struggle between Poe and I, only because my boyfriend had a giant ego that he didn\u2019t know how to rein in at times. </p><p>The truth was that Poe knew that I owned his ass in the bedroom. Only on rare occasions would I give up the power to one of my lovers. </p><p>\u201cFox. I have the cuffs.\u201d Rey announced, climbing on the bed. A grin marked my lips and I turned to my girlfriend before pulling her to me. She squeaked softly and I caught the sound with my mouth, kissing her roughly. </p><p>She moaned as I nipped at her bottom lip then I twisted my fingers through her hair, pulling her harder against me. I slipped my free hand up her shirt and she gasped as my cold fingers found her nipple. </p><p>Finn whimpered softly and I pulled away from the kiss, turning to my boyfriend. I smiled gently at me then handed him the cuffs before I stated,\u201dGo bind that sassy fuck.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThis sassy fuck can hear you.\u201d Poe snapped, earning my attention. I turned and grinned at him before I traced his scruffy jawline with a single fingernail. He leaned into the scratch then I gripped his jawline tightly, leaning into him, before I kissed him. </p><p>He followed my lead, licking and nipping at my lips to try and gain access, only for me to bite down harshly. I drug my canines across the inside of his lip and he jerked back, blood dribbling down the corner of his mouth.</p><p>He swore out and his dark eyes narrowed at me then I said,\u201dDon\u2019t have anything sassy to say now, do you?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou bite like a fucking girl.\u201d he spat, eyes flashing wildly. I grinned and leaned closer to him as I chirped,\u201dWhy, thank you!\u201d </p><p>Rey grabbed my arm then pulled me closer and murmured,\u201dMaybe you should\u2026\u201d She trailed off and turned her eyes towards Finn who just finished binding Poe\u2019s hands to the headboard. </p><p>I tilted her head up to meet her eyes then murmured,\u201dI can\u2019t do what you want unless you tell me, lovey.\u201d She smiled gently at me then suggested,\u201dWhy don\u2019t you sit on his face and let him eat you out?\u201d </p><p>A rough groan was shared between our boyfriends and I grinned with my girlfriend then stated,\u201dI think they like that plan.\u201d </p><p>\u201cLook at you, Fox. Of course I like that plan. I mean, Poe\u2019s mouth is heaven.\u201d Finn informed me. I smiled and pulled my darker skinned lover into a kiss, one that was hard and slow, and his finger sought out the zipper on my flight suit then drug it down. </p><p>Rey\u2019s nimble fingers twisted at the shoulders of my suit then pulled it down my arms and I locked eyes with Poe as my bare breasts was revealed. </p><p>A quiet growl left his clever mouth and my head fell backwards as Finn fastened his lips to my nipple, flicking his tongue across the bud. I moaned and wrapped an arm around the back of my boyfriend\u2019s neck, his fingers fidgeting with my other nipple. </p><p>Rey bit gently into the skin of my shoulder then her fingers roamed towards my cunt hidden by the rest of my flight suit. My eyes locked with Poe\u2019s as our girlfriend sought out my clit then I gasped out,\u201dShe\u2019s so good at this, Commander. All small and talented fingers. She\u2019s learned well. My cunt is so wet and tight and ready for her.\u201d </p><p>Rey laughed softly then licked my earlobe, drawing into her devilous mouth and whispered as she admitted,\u201dThe boys have tried hard to teach me what to do.\u201d I tilted Finn\u2019s head up to meet his eyes and he stated,\u201dShe\u2019s an eager learner, Lieutenant. And she\u2019s very fun to teach.\u201d </p><p>I went to reply, only to cry out as he nipped at my breasts, sucking in the skin tightly. He held it there for a moment or two, running his tongue over the bruise he was leaving, then let go. </p><p>Rey leaned closer and her fingers ran through my slick before sliding a finger inside. We moaned in sync as she babbled,\u201dYou\u2019re so wet and you feel so good. Can I taste please, please,let me taste?\u201d </p><p>\u201cGo ahead, taste what belongs to you.\u201d She whimpered and Finn pulled away, dragging the rest of my flight suit down my body, freeing my heated skin from the outfit. He laid me back and I sought out the button on his pants, tugging them down his legs. </p><p>His cock jumped then nearly slapped his stomach with how quickly I pulled down his jeans and I nearly purred at the sight. He was perfectly thick and long, not too much of either. He had a beautiful cock. </p><p>I leaned forward and kitten licked the head as Rey bent her head, licking timidly at my entrance. I mewled and tangled my hand through her hair as I murmured,\u201dThat\u2019s so good, love. Go on, tell the Commander how good I taste.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTastes so good,Commander, oh my stars!\u201d she moaned, eyes blinking widely up at me. I tugged at her hair then ordered,\u201dDon\u2019t you dare think about teasing me. She shook her head, tongue lingering at my entrance, then murmured,\u201dI\u2019d never tease,Fox, never.\u201d </p><p>Finn let out a breathy chuckle then asked,\u201dWhat about this morning?\u201d I glanced down at my girlfriend and cupped her cheek, asking,\u201dDid you tease Finn?\u201d </p><p>She gave me a shameless grin and replied,\u201dIt was just so tempting and he responds so well.\u201d I tangled my fingers in her hair as she gave another timid lick to my clit and sucked the bud into her mouth, biting down softly. My hips jerked into her then she moaned, flicking her tongue faster. </p><p>\u201cI thought you was going to sit on my face, Princess? What\u2019s the matter, you gonna pussy out on me?\u201d Poe mocked, raising an eyebrow at me. My eyes flew open and over to him where he smirked in return, happy to see that he had caught my attention. </p><p>\u201cYou smug little fuck.\u201d I bit out as Rey moved away from me. He full out grinned then said,\u201dCome on, Fox, come let me eat that sweet little pussy like a good girl would.\u201d </p><p>I shivered at his words and straddled his face, fingers gripping the bars of the headboard as I slowly lowered myself down. Poe quickly pressed his mouth into my pussy, his tongue working over my clit quickly, humming with delight while he worked me over. </p><p>My eyes fluttered open and I turned my head to find Finn and Rey entertaining one another. Her nimble fingers wrapped around his cock and began stroking him towards his orgasm. </p><p>\u201cGo on, lovely, sink down on that gorgeous dick. Wear him out because when I\u2019m done with the Commander, I think we\u2019re going to take a nap.\u201d I encouraged, my head tilting back as my lover worked me closer to the edge. </p><p>\u201cCmon, Fox, come on my face then you can fuck me.\u201d Poe murmured, the vibrations making me jerk against his clever mouth. </p><p>\u201cOh my Stars!\u201d I cried out, rocking faster as I started to come. I slowly rolled off of his face and he nodded his head towards his straining cock as he mutter,\u201dGo on, doll face, show me who\u2019s boss.\u201d </p><p>I shuffled down on my knees then gave the tip of his dick a couple quick licks, making him jolt at the timid touches. </p><p>But to bring myself and my lover to our orgasms, I finally straddled his hips, gripping the base of his member to lead him to my entrance. Slowly I sunk down on him, my head leaning forward onto his bare chest where I licked and nibbled my way up to his neck, slowly beginning to ride him faster and faster. </p><p>\u201cYeah, get that dick, baby. C\u2019mon, you wanna be boss, you gotta work better than that.\u201d Poe taunted, though his breath getting more and more ragged told me the truth. I was doing exactly what I wanted to. </p><p>\u201cMy Stars, you feel so good.\u201d I moaned, eyes locking with Rey, who was attempting to keep her gaze on me while Finn fucked her senselessly. </p><p>\u201cGood boy, Finny. Go on, make our lovely come so hard she won\u2019t forget your name.\u201d I ordered, starting to roll my hips faster against Poe\u2019s. I watched with intense eyes as my other lovers started to come, moans and grunts mixing together. </p><p>Finally, Poe began bucking into me, the base of his cock brushing my clit just enough to bring me towards the edge. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good girl, Fox, come on, come with me.\u201dhe insisted, panting. My body fell forward as we finished coming together then I reached my hand over sleepily, grabbing the key for his cuffs from the bedside drawer. I unlocked him and his arms curled around me as Finn handed me a clean, damp cloth to clean us up with. </p><p>\u201cSo, everything went okay then?\u201d Poe asked as our significant others curled into us. I sighed then cuddled against him as I replied,\u201dYeah, as okay as it\u2019ll go on Hoth, I guess.\u201d </p><p>He nodded and Finn said,\u201dWell, the important part is that you came him to us safe and without any missing body parts. Now, I believe that I was promised a nap once you were done with our Commander.\u201d Rey nodded tiredly, her head dipping onto Poe\u2019s chest, as she murmured,\u201dA nap sounds so good.\u201d </p><p>A knock is what woke me up the next morning. Poe was sprawled across my legs, curled into me, while Rey rested her head in Finn\u2019s lap, and Finn curled his left arm underneath my head. I unfortunately had to wake them all up in order for me to greet the person on the other side of the door. </p><p>I scooped up Poe\u2019s shirt and pulled it over my head before I approached the door.When I opened it, I felt a sense of dread slam into me. There stood General Organa and her face told me all. I was leaving again. </p><p>\u201cGeneral,please-\u201d Finn started, sitting up. He was the first to realize what was going on. She smiled sadly, her eyes reading what I knew she felt. She felt horrible for sending me out. </p><p>\u201cFinn, if I had a choice, I wouldn\u2019t send her away so soon,but the First Order has been sighted near our ship and we need someone to scope it out. We would send Poe, but he\u2019s a hot head. Fox is our only option.\u201dshe insisted, turning towards me. I nodded slightly in understanding before Poe snapped,\u201dNo. Why the hell does Fox have to be the one to do it? There\u2019s plenty of pilots qualified enough to do what you want her to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCommander, don\u2019t start with me. I\u2019m not happy about it either. Fox, please be ready in the next half hour.\u201d she said, turning towards me. I nodded and she walked away, leaving me alone with my partners. </p><p>Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Rey bury her head in her hands and she sobbed quietly. I turned to Poe and Finn who exchanged unsettled looks before I walked to my girlfriend. </p><p>I pulled her hands away from her face then forced her to look up at me before I kissed her gently. As I pulled away, she crushed me into a hug, sniffling quietly. </p><p>Poe met my eyes with a hard look and I glanced away. Poe always had the hardest time when I left. He hated that I usually went out alone and he knew that he belonged with me on the mission, watching my back. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d I murmured, turning towards my lovers. I pulled Poe\u2019s shirt off and headed towards the bathroom. With a quick five minute shower, the smell of sex was cleared from my body and I was dressed for my latest mission. </p><p>I exited the restroom and there stood my significant others, dressed for the day. Rey\u2019s hair was done in the usual style and I smiled gently at the sight of them.</p><p>I hugged her tightly then murmured,\u201dI\u2019ll be back before you know I\u2019m gone.\u201d She nodded gently but the moment of her hesitation told me exactly what was going on. She wasn\u2019t sure that I\u2019d be back as soon as I want to be. I kissed Finn softly then he pulled away, brushing my hair out of my face as he stated,\u201dBe safe, please.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf course I will.\u201d And finally, I turned to Poe, who was burning a hole into the wall. I laughed and asked,\u201dWhat\u2019d that wall do to you? It\u2019s not the one sending me away.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, but I can\u2019t exactly glare at the General now can I?\u201d he spat, turning his attention to me. I blinked slowly then raised an eyebrow at him before I said,\u201dWithout me, you\u2019d be the one getting sent out constantly to watch the Rebellion\u2019s ass. I will be back, Poe. You know I will.\u201d </p><p>He nodded slowly then tangled his hand through my hair, bringing me into a kiss. I pulled away after a few moments then gave a last nod to my lovers before joining the General by my X-Wing. </p><p>\u201cGeneral, I\u2019m ready to go.\u201d I informed her, tightening my hands into fists behind my back. She smiled at me and I could tell that she wanted to say something to me, an apology perhaps, but she never said a word. In fact, she just handed me a small map and walked away. </p><p>I unrolled it and realized that it was no ordinary map. It was a map of the First Order\u2019s ship. At the corner of the paper,the General had written something for me in fine print. </p><p><i>\u201cFox, I understand that you just returned but we need you to do this. If you are captured, and I fear that you will be, this is a map of the Supremacy. The rooms are labeled and it will guide you to the ships that they have. You are to do a simple perimeter check if you will, around our ship. Please be safe. -General Leia Organa.\u201d </i></p><p>I looked up and realized that M4-S9 wasn\u2019t in my X-Wing then it hit me. I was really going in alone. There was something that the General wasn\u2019t telling me, but if it\u2019s too dangerous to take my droid with me, then it was definitely too dangerous to take my hot headed boyfriend along for the ride. </p><p>I took a deep breath then entered my X-Wing, securing everything in its proper place, and stuffed the map inside of my boot, since no one checks shoes, before starting up my ship. </p><p>I did a perimeter check around our ship, just as the General ordered, but when I started heading towards the hanger doors, that\u2019s when I saw it. The Supremacy, right in front of my face. I took a deep breath then muttered to myself,\u201dI can\u2019t believe that I\u2019m going to do this.\u201d</p><p>Their hanger doors were wide open and it was so easy to get in. I could get in and out without anyone noticing. I could get more information than anyone else had ever gotten from the First Order. I could change the course of the war. I stepped out of my X-Wing and glanced around, being as careful as possible, then I hurried towards the door that I thought led out of the hanger. </p><p>But that didn\u2019t exactly work out. Someone slammed something into the back of my head and I fell face forward on to the floor. </p><p>When I woke, that\u2019s when I realized that I had really fucked up. My wrists were restrained by chains and I could feel the Force in the room. It was thick and heady. I turned to look around and groaned as pain jolted through my head then someone stated,\u201dDo not even think about escaping. There\u2019s no point. Even if you do get out of the chains, you have no idea how to get around this ship.\u201d </p><p>I glanced up slowly when the person emerged from the dark and I lowered my head as it hit me. I was Kylo Ren\u2019s prisoner. And no one knew about it either. </p></p>",

Not coming back when you\u2019re supposed to. I was sent out to Hoth by the General herself to see if there was any remaining supplies from the original Rebel Base. It was one of the most dangerous planets so she sent me, the second in command for the pilots, to check it out. </p><p>Unfortunately, I got caught up with a pack of wampas, who decided that I needed a hard time. I was supposed to be back three days ago, but the ship was a little damaged, thanks to the horrible beasts. So now, I was stuck fixing my X-Wing while my droid mouthed off.</p><p>\u201cYou know, m four? My babes are probably losing their minds right about now.\u201d I suggested to M4-S9. It chirped in agreement then I  slid underneath my ship and stretched my hand out to grab a wrench then snatched it before tightened a bolt that attached to the engine. My droid  beeped its opinion about my over-obsessive worrying about my ship, to which I responded with,\u201dActually m four, you\u2019re right. Maybe I can be a bit paranoid. But do you really want to fall from the sky after one mission when some douche decides that I was in the wrong?\u201d</p><p>It chirped and I rolled my eyes, but didn\u2019t bother responding to its sassy remark.I slid out from underneath my X-Wing and stared up at the droid then asked,\u201dDo you think you can get a hold of General Organa for me real quick?\u201d </p><p>Without another sound, it broadcasted a hologram of General Leia Organa, the queen of the Resistance. She nodded in acknowledgement towards me then said,\u201dLieutenant. Glad to see you\u2019re still alive.\u201d </p><p>Ah yes, not to mention that she was one of the most blunt people that I knew. </p><p>\u201cGeneral, I\u2019m so sorry that I wasn\u2019t able to contact you when I was scheduled to. I ran into some problems.\u201d I apologized, ducking my head briefly in respect. She waved her hand, dismissing my excuse, and said,\u201dI figured. You\u2019re very good at your job, Fox.\u201d </p><p>Fox. My code name, something that everyone knew me by. I was cunning and quick, but still dangerous all the same. </p><p>\u201cThank you, General. I\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d I informed her. She nodded and thanked me for my mission\u2019s success before ending the connection. I was Force sensitive, which was more than likely one of the main reasons why the General sent me out on some many missions. I could scope out the Force users and see if they spoke for a certain side of the war.</p><p>I turned to M4-S9 then asked,\u201dYou ready to go home,m four?\u201d It beeped in agreement and we entered the X-Wing before heading back to the Resistance fleet. Just forty rough minutes later, I was pulling into the base. M4-S9 and I piled out of our ship then it rolled away from me. I pulled off my helmet and set it inside the cockpit before someone said something. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ridiculous.We\u2019ve been looking for you for the last forty minutes! You\u2019re late, a lot later now that you\u2019ve been gone for three days longer than expected.\u201d</p><p>Rey. My best friend and one of my significant others. Rey and I shared a relationship with Finn and Poe. It wasn\u2019t the easiest thing to defend, but when you\u2019re fighting a war against the biggest enemy of the galaxy, it wasn\u2019t the hardest thing to defend either. </p><p>I flashed her a sheepish smile then came to a stand, wiping my hands off on the rag I always kept in my back pocket, a habit that I had started back when I was younger, fighting for my life on Eadu. She crossed her arms and shook her head at me before she stated,\u201dPoe and Finn are waiting for us.\u201d </p><p>I grinned at the information then grabbed her hand before I asked,\u201dWell, why are we still standing here then? Let\u2019s not keep our boys waiting any longer.\u201d She nodded and when I began walking towards our shared room, she tugged on the hold we shared then I stopped, staring at her with questioning eyes.</p><p>\u201cRey? Hey, what\u2019s wrong, lovey?\u201d I asked, only for her to duck her head in an emotion that I was quite familiar with. Shame. </p><p>\u201cI was so scared.. I didn\u2019t think,\u201d she cleared her throat before explaining,\u201dWhen you didn\u2019t come back when you was supposed to, I got worried and kind of panicked.\u201d I smiled and tilted her chin up to make her look at me then I said,\u201dRey, there\u2019s nothing wrong with being scared when I don\u2019t come home when I\u2019m supposed to.  It\u2019s a natural thing to do when you care for someone. Okay?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and I hugged her tightly before murmuring,\u201dLet\u2019s go see our boys. You know how impatient Poe can get.\u201d Rey nodded with a small smile and we walked towards our room. </p><p>The door was slightly cracked and I pushed open the door, where Poe had Finn pushed into the mattress, his hand pressed tightly over the dark skinned man\u2019s mouth. </p><p>Finn laced his fingers through his lover\u2019s hair as Poe kissed down his boyfriend\u2019s thick body and I grinned at my girlfriend, who\u2019s beautiful eyes was glued to the two men on the bed. </p><p>\u201cYou impatient little fucks.\u201d They snapped apart and Poe grinned at me before he stated,\u201dOur Fox has returned to us.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou started without Rey and I. How dare you? I\u2019ve been alone, for the last six days, on a frozen wasteland, and you two are making out.\u201d I said, dropping my hand from Rey\u2019s grasp. Poe came to his knees and started to stand, only for me to force him onto his back. </p><p>His dark eyes widened and I could hear Finn beginning to make up an excuse with a sweet,\u201dI\u2019m sorry, Fox, he started it,\u201dbut I cut him off with a quick glare. </p><p>I tangled my hand into Poe\u2019s hair and jerked his head up to force him to look me in the eyes before I leaned down and hissed,\u201dYou just don\u2019t know when to stop, do you, Commander?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, Lieutenant, I don\u2019t. You know why? Because I\u2019m your superior and I don\u2019t take orders from you.\u201d he barked, getting in my face. A smirk worked its way onto my lips and I turned to Rey then called,\u201dLovey, would you mind doing something for me real quick?\u201d </p><p>I watched as her head bobbed up and down eagerly in response then I asked,\u201dHand me my cuffs. I think Commander Dameron needs to be reminded of who runs this show in the bedroom.\u201d </p><p>Her eyes lit up at the thought of punishing the ever mouthy Poe. She rushed to grab what I asked her to get then Finn molded himself to me and murmured,\u201dPlease don\u2019t be too rough on him.He\u2019s been punishing himself all week since you had to go alone.\u201d </p><p>I turned to Poe, who looked defiant, yet ready to surrender to my every whim, then asked,\u201dIs this true, baby boy? Do you feel bad about me going in alone?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou know I fucking hate when they pull that shit over you, Fox. It\u2019s dangerous.\u201d he hissed, eyes dilating in anger and lust. </p><p>I gripped his jaw at the use of his curse words and snapped,\u201dI thought I told you not to use those fucking words,Dameron.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd I thought I told you to fuck off when you said that.\u201d</p><p>I pulled away then turned to Finn, who was watching anxiously between the two of us. It was constantly a power struggle between Poe and I, only because my boyfriend had a giant ego that he didn\u2019t know how to rein in at times. </p><p>The truth was that Poe knew that I owned his ass in the bedroom. Only on rare occasions would I give up the power to one of my lovers. </p><p>\u201cFox. I have the cuffs.\u201d Rey announced, climbing on the bed. A grin marked my lips and I turned to my girlfriend before pulling her to me. She squeaked softly and I caught the sound with my mouth, kissing her roughly. </p><p>She moaned as I nipped at her bottom lip then I twisted my fingers through her hair, pulling her harder against me. I slipped my free hand up her shirt and she gasped as my cold fingers found her nipple. </p><p>Finn whimpered softly and I pulled away from the kiss, turning to my boyfriend. I smiled gently at me then handed him the cuffs before I stated,\u201dGo bind that sassy fuck.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThis sassy fuck can hear you.\u201d Poe snapped, earning my attention. I turned and grinned at him before I traced his scruffy jawline with a single fingernail. He leaned into the scratch then I gripped his jawline tightly, leaning into him, before I kissed him. </p><p>He followed my lead, licking and nipping at my lips to try and gain access, only for me to bite down harshly. I drug my canines across the inside of his lip and he jerked back, blood dribbling down the corner of his mouth.</p><p>He swore out and his dark eyes narrowed at me then I said,\u201dDon\u2019t have anything sassy to say now, do you?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou bite like a fucking girl.\u201d he spat, eyes flashing wildly. I grinned and leaned closer to him as I chirped,\u201dWhy, thank you!\u201d </p><p>Rey grabbed my arm then pulled me closer and murmured,\u201dMaybe you should\u2026\u201d She trailed off and turned her eyes towards Finn who just finished binding Poe\u2019s hands to the headboard. </p><p>I tilted her head up to meet her eyes then murmured,\u201dI can\u2019t do what you want unless you tell me, lovey.\u201d She smiled gently at me then suggested,\u201dWhy don\u2019t you sit on his face and let him eat you out?\u201d </p><p>A rough groan was shared between our boyfriends and I grinned with my girlfriend then stated,\u201dI think they like that plan.\u201d </p><p>\u201cLook at you, Fox. Of course I like that plan. I mean, Poe\u2019s mouth is heaven.\u201d Finn informed me. I smiled and pulled my darker skinned lover into a kiss, one that was hard and slow, and his finger sought out the zipper on my flight suit then drug it down. </p><p>Rey\u2019s nimble fingers twisted at the shoulders of my suit then pulled it down my arms and I locked eyes with Poe as my bare breasts was revealed. </p><p>A quiet growl left his clever mouth and my head fell backwards as Finn fastened his lips to my nipple, flicking his tongue across the bud. I moaned and wrapped an arm around the back of my boyfriend\u2019s neck, his fingers fidgeting with my other nipple. </p><p>Rey bit gently into the skin of my shoulder then her fingers roamed towards my cunt hidden by the rest of my flight suit. My eyes locked with Poe\u2019s as our girlfriend sought out my clit then I gasped out,\u201dShe\u2019s so good at this, Commander. All small and talented fingers. She\u2019s learned well. My cunt is so wet and tight and ready for her.\u201d </p><p>Rey laughed softly then licked my earlobe, drawing into her devilous mouth and whispered as she admitted,\u201dThe boys have tried hard to teach me what to do.\u201d I tilted Finn\u2019s head up to meet his eyes and he stated,\u201dShe\u2019s an eager learner, Lieutenant. And she\u2019s very fun to teach.\u201d </p><p>I went to reply, only to cry out as he nipped at my breasts, sucking in the skin tightly. He held it there for a moment or two, running his tongue over the bruise he was leaving, then let go. </p><p>Rey leaned closer and her fingers ran through my slick before sliding a finger inside. We moaned in sync as she babbled,\u201dYou\u2019re so wet and you feel so good. Can I taste please, please,let me taste?\u201d </p><p>\u201cGo ahead, taste what belongs to you.\u201d She whimpered and Finn pulled away, dragging the rest of my flight suit down my body, freeing my heated skin from the outfit. He laid me back and I sought out the button on his pants, tugging them down his legs. </p><p>His cock jumped then nearly slapped his stomach with how quickly I pulled down his jeans and I nearly purred at the sight. He was perfectly thick and long, not too much of either. He had a beautiful cock. </p><p>I leaned forward and kitten licked the head as Rey bent her head, licking timidly at my entrance. I mewled and tangled my hand through her hair as I murmured,\u201dThat\u2019s so good, love. Go on, tell the Commander how good I taste.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTastes so good,Commander, oh my stars!\u201d she moaned, eyes blinking widely up at me. I tugged at her hair then ordered,\u201dDon\u2019t you dare think about teasing me. She shook her head, tongue lingering at my entrance, then murmured,\u201dI\u2019d never tease,Fox, never.\u201d </p><p>Finn let out a breathy chuckle then asked,\u201dWhat about this morning?\u201d I glanced down at my girlfriend and cupped her cheek, asking,\u201dDid you tease Finn?\u201d </p><p>She gave me a shameless grin and replied,\u201dIt was just so tempting and he responds so well.\u201d I tangled my fingers in her hair as she gave another timid lick to my clit and sucked the bud into her mouth, biting down softly. My hips jerked into her then she moaned, flicking her tongue faster. </p><p>\u201cI thought you was going to sit on my face, Princess? What\u2019s the matter, you gonna pussy out on me?\u201d Poe mocked, raising an eyebrow at me. My eyes flew open and over to him where he smirked in return, happy to see that he had caught my attention. </p><p>\u201cYou smug little fuck.\u201d I bit out as Rey moved away from me. He full out grinned then said,\u201dCome on, Fox, come let me eat that sweet little pussy like a good girl would.\u201d </p><p>I shivered at his words and straddled his face, fingers gripping the bars of the headboard as I slowly lowered myself down. Poe quickly pressed his mouth into my pussy, his tongue working over my clit quickly, humming with delight while he worked me over. </p><p>My eyes fluttered open and I turned my head to find Finn and Rey entertaining one another. Her nimble fingers wrapped around his cock and began stroking him towards his orgasm. </p><p>\u201cGo on, lovely, sink down on that gorgeous dick. Wear him out because when I\u2019m done with the Commander, I think we\u2019re going to take a nap.\u201d I encouraged, my head tilting back as my lover worked me closer to the edge. </p><p>\u201cCmon, Fox, come on my face then you can fuck me.\u201d Poe murmured, the vibrations making me jerk against his clever mouth. </p><p>\u201cOh my Stars!\u201d I cried out, rocking faster as I started to come. I slowly rolled off of his face and he nodded his head towards his straining cock as he mutter,\u201dGo on, doll face, show me who\u2019s boss.\u201d </p><p>I shuffled down on my knees then gave the tip of his dick a couple quick licks, making him jolt at the timid touches. </p><p>But to bring myself and my lover to our orgasms, I finally straddled his hips, gripping the base of his member to lead him to my entrance. Slowly I sunk down on him, my head leaning forward onto his bare chest where I licked and nibbled my way up to his neck, slowly beginning to ride him faster and faster. </p><p>\u201cYeah, get that dick, baby. C\u2019mon, you wanna be boss, you gotta work better than that.\u201d Poe taunted, though his breath getting more and more ragged told me the truth. I was doing exactly what I wanted to. </p><p>\u201cMy Stars, you feel so good.\u201d I moaned, eyes locking with Rey, who was attempting to keep her gaze on me while Finn fucked her senselessly. </p><p>\u201cGood boy, Finny. Go on, make our lovely come so hard she won\u2019t forget your name.\u201d I ordered, starting to roll my hips faster against Poe\u2019s. I watched with intense eyes as my other lovers started to come, moans and grunts mixing together. </p><p>Finally, Poe began bucking into me, the base of his cock brushing my clit just enough to bring me towards the edge. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good girl, Fox, come on, come with me.\u201dhe insisted, panting. My body fell forward as we finished coming together then I reached my hand over sleepily, grabbing the key for his cuffs from the bedside drawer. I unlocked him and his arms curled around me as Finn handed me a clean, damp cloth to clean us up with. </p><p>\u201cSo, everything went okay then?\u201d Poe asked as our significant others curled into us. I sighed then cuddled against him as I replied,\u201dYeah, as okay as it\u2019ll go on Hoth, I guess.\u201d </p><p>He nodded and Finn said,\u201dWell, the important part is that you came him to us safe and without any missing body parts. Now, I believe that I was promised a nap once you were done with our Commander.\u201d Rey nodded tiredly, her head dipping onto Poe\u2019s chest, as she murmured,\u201dA nap sounds so good.\u201d </p><p>A knock is what woke me up the next morning. Poe was sprawled across my legs, curled into me, while Rey rested her head in Finn\u2019s lap, and Finn curled his left arm underneath my head. I unfortunately had to wake them all up in order for me to greet the person on the other side of the door. </p><p>I scooped up Poe\u2019s shirt and pulled it over my head before I approached the door.When I opened it, I felt a sense of dread slam into me. There stood General Organa and her face told me all. I was leaving again. </p><p>\u201cGeneral,please-\u201d Finn started, sitting up. He was the first to realize what was going on. She smiled sadly, her eyes reading what I knew she felt. She felt horrible for sending me out. </p><p>\u201cFinn, if I had a choice, I wouldn\u2019t send her away so soon,but the First Order has been sighted near our ship and we need someone to scope it out. We would send Poe, but he\u2019s a hot head. Fox is our only option.\u201dshe insisted, turning towards me. I nodded slightly in understanding before Poe snapped,\u201dNo. Why the hell does Fox have to be the one to do it? There\u2019s plenty of pilots qualified enough to do what you want her to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCommander, don\u2019t start with me. I\u2019m not happy about it either. Fox, please be ready in the next half hour.\u201d she said, turning towards me. I nodded and she walked away, leaving me alone with my partners. </p><p>Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Rey bury her head in her hands and she sobbed quietly. I turned to Poe and Finn who exchanged unsettled looks before I walked to my girlfriend. </p><p>I pulled her hands away from her face then forced her to look up at me before I kissed her gently. As I pulled away, she crushed me into a hug, sniffling quietly. </p><p>Poe met my eyes with a hard look and I glanced away. Poe always had the hardest time when I left. He hated that I usually went out alone and he knew that he belonged with me on the mission, watching my back. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d I murmured, turning towards my lovers. I pulled Poe\u2019s shirt off and headed towards the bathroom. With a quick five minute shower, the smell of sex was cleared from my body and I was dressed for my latest mission. </p><p>I exited the restroom and there stood my significant others, dressed for the day. Rey\u2019s hair was done in the usual style and I smiled gently at the sight of them.</p><p>I hugged her tightly then murmured,\u201dI\u2019ll be back before you know I\u2019m gone.\u201d She nodded gently but the moment of her hesitation told me exactly what was going on. She wasn\u2019t sure that I\u2019d be back as soon as I want to be. I kissed Finn softly then he pulled away, brushing my hair out of my face as he stated,\u201dBe safe, please.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf course I will.\u201d And finally, I turned to Poe, who was burning a hole into the wall. I laughed and asked,\u201dWhat\u2019d that wall do to you? It\u2019s not the one sending me away.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, but I can\u2019t exactly glare at the General now can I?\u201d he spat, turning his attention to me. I blinked slowly then raised an eyebrow at him before I said,\u201dWithout me, you\u2019d be the one getting sent out constantly to watch the Rebellion\u2019s ass. I will be back, Poe. You know I will.\u201d </p><p>He nodded slowly then tangled his hand through my hair, bringing me into a kiss. I pulled away after a few moments then gave a last nod to my lovers before joining the General by my X-Wing. </p><p>\u201cGeneral, I\u2019m ready to go.\u201d I informed her, tightening my hands into fists behind my back. She smiled at me and I could tell that she wanted to say something to me, an apology perhaps, but she never said a word. In fact, she just handed me a small map and walked away. </p><p>I unrolled it and realized that it was no ordinary map. It was a map of the First Order\u2019s ship. At the corner of the paper,the General had written something for me in fine print. </p><p><i>\u201cFox, I understand that you just returned but we need you to do this. If you are captured, and I fear that you will be, this is a map of the Supremacy. The rooms are labeled and it will guide you to the ships that they have. You are to do a simple perimeter check if you will, around our ship. Please be safe. -General Leia Organa.\u201d </i></p><p>I looked up and realized that M4-S9 wasn\u2019t in my X-Wing then it hit me. I was really going in alone. There was something that the General wasn\u2019t telling me, but if it\u2019s too dangerous to take my droid with me, then it was definitely too dangerous to take my hot headed boyfriend along for the ride. </p><p>I took a deep breath then entered my X-Wing, securing everything in its proper place, and stuffed the map inside of my boot, since no one checks shoes, before starting up my ship. </p><p>I did a perimeter check around our ship, just as the General ordered, but when I started heading towards the hanger doors, that\u2019s when I saw it. The Supremacy, right in front of my face. I took a deep breath then muttered to myself,\u201dI can\u2019t believe that I\u2019m going to do this.\u201d</p><p>Their hanger doors were wide open and it was so easy to get in. I could get in and out without anyone noticing. I could get more information than anyone else had ever gotten from the First Order. I could change the course of the war. I stepped out of my X-Wing and glanced around, being as careful as possible, then I hurried towards the door that I thought led out of the hanger. </p><p>But that didn\u2019t exactly work out. Someone slammed something into the back of my head and I fell face forward on to the floor. </p><p>When I woke, that\u2019s when I realized that I had really fucked up. My wrists were restrained by chains and I could feel the Force in the room. It was thick and heady. I turned to look around and groaned as pain jolted through my head then someone stated,\u201dDo not even think about escaping. There\u2019s no point. Even if you do get out of the chains, you have no idea how to get around this ship.\u201d </p><p>I glanced up slowly when the person emerged from the dark and I lowered my head as it hit me. I was Kylo Ren\u2019s prisoner. And no one knew about it either. </p></p>",

Not coming back when you&rsquo;re supposed to. I was sent out to Hoth by the General herself to see if there was any remaining supplies from the original Rebel Base. It was one of the most dangerous planets so she sent me, the second in command for the pilots, to check it out. </p><p>Unfortunately, I got caught up with a pack of wampas, who decided that I needed a hard time. I was supposed to be back three days ago, but the ship was a little damaged, thanks to the horrible beasts. So now, I was stuck fixing my X-Wing while my droid mouthed off.</p><p>&ldquo;You know, m four? My babes are probably losing their minds right about now.&rdquo; I suggested to M4-S9. It chirped in agreement then I  slid underneath my ship and stretched my hand out to grab a wrench then snatched it before tightened a bolt that attached to the engine. My droid  beeped its opinion about my over-obsessive worrying about my ship, to which I responded with,&rdquo;Actually m four, you&rsquo;re right. Maybe I can be a bit paranoid. But do you really want to fall from the sky after one mission when some douche decides that I was in the wrong?&rdquo;</p><p>It chirped and I rolled my eyes, but didn&rsquo;t bother responding to its sassy remark.I slid out from underneath my X-Wing and stared up at the droid then asked,&rdquo;Do you think you can get a hold of General Organa for me real quick?&rdquo; </p><p>Without another sound, it broadcasted a hologram of General Leia Organa, the queen of the Resistance. She nodded in acknowledgement towards me then said,&rdquo;Lieutenant. Glad to see you&rsquo;re still alive.&rdquo; </p><p>Ah yes, not to mention that she was one of the most blunt people that I knew. </p><p>&ldquo;General, I&rsquo;m so sorry that I wasn&rsquo;t able to contact you when I was scheduled to. I ran into some problems.&rdquo; I apologized, ducking my head briefly in respect. She waved her hand, dismissing my excuse, and said,&rdquo;I figured. You&rsquo;re very good at your job, Fox.&rdquo; </p><p>Fox. My code name, something that everyone knew me by. I was cunning and quick, but still dangerous all the same. </p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, General. I&rsquo;ll be back soon.&rdquo; I informed her. She nodded and thanked me for my mission&rsquo;s success before ending the connection. I was Force sensitive, which was more than likely one of the main reasons why the General sent me out on some many missions. I could scope out the Force users and see if they spoke for a certain side of the war.</p><p>I turned to M4-S9 then asked,&rdquo;You ready to go home,m four?&rdquo; It beeped in agreement and we entered the X-Wing before heading back to the Resistance fleet. Just forty rough minutes later, I was pulling into the base. M4-S9 and I piled out of our ship then it rolled away from me. I pulled off my helmet and set it inside the cockpit before someone said something. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re ridiculous.We&rsquo;ve been looking for you for the last forty minutes! You&rsquo;re late, a lot later now that you&rsquo;ve been gone for three days longer than expected.&rdquo;</p><p>Rey. My best friend and one of my significant others. Rey and I shared a relationship with Finn and Poe. It wasn&rsquo;t the easiest thing to defend, but when you&rsquo;re fighting a war against the biggest enemy of the galaxy, it wasn&rsquo;t the hardest thing to defend either. </p><p>I flashed her a sheepish smile then came to a stand, wiping my hands off on the rag I always kept in my back pocket, a habit that I had started back when I was younger, fighting for my life on Eadu. She crossed her arms and shook her head at me before she stated,&rdquo;Poe and Finn are waiting for us.&rdquo; </p><p>I grinned at the information then grabbed her hand before I asked,&rdquo;Well, why are we still standing here then? Let&rsquo;s not keep our boys waiting any longer.&rdquo; She nodded and when I began walking towards our shared room, she tugged on the hold we shared then I stopped, staring at her with questioning eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Rey? Hey, what&rsquo;s wrong, lovey?&rdquo; I asked, only for her to duck her head in an emotion that I was quite familiar with. Shame. </p><p>&ldquo;I was so scared.. I didn&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; she cleared her throat before explaining,&rdquo;When you didn&rsquo;t come back when you was supposed to, I got worried and kind of panicked.&rdquo; I smiled and tilted her chin up to make her look at me then I said,&rdquo;Rey, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with being scared when I don&rsquo;t come home when I&rsquo;m supposed to.  It&rsquo;s a natural thing to do when you care for someone. Okay?&rdquo;</p><p>She nodded and I hugged her tightly before murmuring,&rdquo;Let&rsquo;s go see our boys. You know how impatient Poe can get.&rdquo; Rey nodded with a small smile and we walked towards our room. </p><p>The door was slightly cracked and I pushed open the door, where Poe had Finn pushed into the mattress, his hand pressed tightly over the dark skinned man&rsquo;s mouth. </p><p>Finn laced his fingers through his lover&rsquo;s hair as Poe kissed down his boyfriend&rsquo;s thick body and I grinned at my girlfriend, who&rsquo;s beautiful eyes was glued to the two men on the bed. </p><p>&ldquo;You impatient little fucks.&rdquo; They snapped apart and Poe grinned at me before he stated,&rdquo;Our Fox has returned to us.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You started without Rey and I. How dare you? I&rsquo;ve been alone, for the last six days, on a frozen wasteland, and you two are making out.&rdquo; I said, dropping my hand from Rey&rsquo;s grasp. Poe came to his knees and started to stand, only for me to force him onto his back. </p><p>His dark eyes widened and I could hear Finn beginning to make up an excuse with a sweet,&rdquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Fox, he started it,&rdquo;but I cut him off with a quick glare. </p><p>I tangled my hand into Poe&rsquo;s hair and jerked his head up to force him to look me in the eyes before I leaned down and hissed,&rdquo;You just don&rsquo;t know when to stop, do you, Commander?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No, Lieutenant, I don&rsquo;t. You know why? Because I&rsquo;m your superior and I don&rsquo;t take orders from you.&rdquo; he barked, getting in my face. A smirk worked its way onto my lips and I turned to Rey then called,&rdquo;Lovey, would you mind doing something for me real quick?&rdquo; </p><p>I watched as her head bobbed up and down eagerly in response then I asked,&rdquo;Hand me my cuffs. I think Commander Dameron needs to be reminded of who runs this show in the bedroom.&rdquo; </p><p>Her eyes lit up at the thought of punishing the ever mouthy Poe. She rushed to grab what I asked her to get then Finn molded himself to me and murmured,&rdquo;Please don&rsquo;t be too rough on him.He&rsquo;s been punishing himself all week since you had to go alone.&rdquo; </p><p>I turned to Poe, who looked defiant, yet ready to surrender to my every whim, then asked,&rdquo;Is this true, baby boy? Do you feel bad about me going in alone?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You know I fucking hate when they pull that shit over you, Fox. It&rsquo;s dangerous.&rdquo; he hissed, eyes dilating in anger and lust. </p><p>I gripped his jaw at the use of his curse words and snapped,&rdquo;I thought I told you not to use those fucking words,Dameron.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;And I thought I told you to fuck off when you said that.&rdquo;</p><p>I pulled away then turned to Finn, who was watching anxiously between the two of us. It was constantly a power struggle between Poe and I, only because my boyfriend had a giant ego that he didn&rsquo;t know how to rein in at times. </p><p>The truth was that Poe knew that I owned his ass in the bedroom. Only on rare occasions would I give up the power to one of my lovers. </p><p>&ldquo;Fox. I have the cuffs.&rdquo; Rey announced, climbing on the bed. A grin marked my lips and I turned to my girlfriend before pulling her to me. She squeaked softly and I caught the sound with my mouth, kissing her roughly. </p><p>She moaned as I nipped at her bottom lip then I twisted my fingers through her hair, pulling her harder against me. I slipped my free hand up her shirt and she gasped as my cold fingers found her nipple. </p><p>Finn whimpered softly and I pulled away from the kiss, turning to my boyfriend. I smiled gently at me then handed him the cuffs before I stated,&rdquo;Go bind that sassy fuck.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;This sassy fuck can hear you.&rdquo; Poe snapped, earning my attention. I turned and grinned at him before I traced his scruffy jawline with a single fingernail. He leaned into the scratch then I gripped his jawline tightly, leaning into him, before I kissed him. </p><p>He followed my lead, licking and nipping at my lips to try and gain access, only for me to bite down harshly. I drug my canines across the inside of his lip and he jerked back, blood dribbling down the corner of his mouth.</p><p>He swore out and his dark eyes narrowed at me then I said,&rdquo;Don&rsquo;t have anything sassy to say now, do you?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You bite like a fucking girl.&rdquo; he spat, eyes flashing wildly. I grinned and leaned closer to him as I chirped,&rdquo;Why, thank you!&rdquo; </p><p>Rey grabbed my arm then pulled me closer and murmured,&rdquo;Maybe you should&hellip;&rdquo; She trailed off and turned her eyes towards Finn who just finished binding Poe&rsquo;s hands to the headboard. </p><p>I tilted her head up to meet her eyes then murmured,&rdquo;I can&rsquo;t do what you want unless you tell me, lovey.&rdquo; She smiled gently at me then suggested,&rdquo;Why don&rsquo;t you sit on his face and let him eat you out?&rdquo; </p><p>A rough groan was shared between our boyfriends and I grinned with my girlfriend then stated,&rdquo;I think they like that plan.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Look at you, Fox. Of course I like that plan. I mean, Poe&rsquo;s mouth is heaven.&rdquo; Finn informed me. I smiled and pulled my darker skinned lover into a kiss, one that was hard and slow, and his finger sought out the zipper on my flight suit then drug it down. </p><p>Rey&rsquo;s nimble fingers twisted at the shoulders of my suit then pulled it down my arms and I locked eyes with Poe as my bare breasts was revealed. </p><p>A quiet growl left his clever mouth and my head fell backwards as Finn fastened his lips to my nipple, flicking his tongue across the bud. I moaned and wrapped an arm around the back of my boyfriend&rsquo;s neck, his fingers fidgeting with my other nipple. </p><p>Rey bit gently into the skin of my shoulder then her fingers roamed towards my cunt hidden by the rest of my flight suit. My eyes locked with Poe&rsquo;s as our girlfriend sought out my clit then I gasped out,&rdquo;She&rsquo;s so good at this, Commander. All small and talented fingers. She&rsquo;s learned well. My cunt is so wet and tight and ready for her.&rdquo; </p><p>Rey laughed softly then licked my earlobe, drawing into her devilous mouth and whispered as she admitted,&rdquo;The boys have tried hard to teach me what to do.&rdquo; I tilted Finn&rsquo;s head up to meet his eyes and he stated,&rdquo;She&rsquo;s an eager learner, Lieutenant. And she&rsquo;s very fun to teach.&rdquo; </p><p>I went to reply, only to cry out as he nipped at my breasts, sucking in the skin tightly. He held it there for a moment or two, running his tongue over the bruise he was leaving, then let go. </p><p>Rey leaned closer and her fingers ran through my slick before sliding a finger inside. We moaned in sync as she babbled,&rdquo;You&rsquo;re so wet and you feel so good. Can I taste please, please,let me taste?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Go ahead, taste what belongs to you.&rdquo; She whimpered and Finn pulled away, dragging the rest of my flight suit down my body, freeing my heated skin from the outfit. He laid me back and I sought out the button on his pants, tugging them down his legs. </p><p>His cock jumped then nearly slapped his stomach with how quickly I pulled down his jeans and I nearly purred at the sight. He was perfectly thick and long, not too much of either. He had a beautiful cock. </p><p>I leaned forward and kitten licked the head as Rey bent her head, licking timidly at my entrance. I mewled and tangled my hand through her hair as I murmured,&rdquo;That&rsquo;s so good, love. Go on, tell the Commander how good I taste.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Tastes so good,Commander, oh my stars!&rdquo; she moaned, eyes blinking widely up at me. I tugged at her hair then ordered,&rdquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare think about teasing me. She shook her head, tongue lingering at my entrance, then murmured,&rdquo;I&rsquo;d never tease,Fox, never.&rdquo; </p><p>Finn let out a breathy chuckle then asked,&rdquo;What about this morning?&rdquo; I glanced down at my girlfriend and cupped her cheek, asking,&rdquo;Did you tease Finn?&rdquo; </p><p>She gave me a shameless grin and replied,&rdquo;It was just so tempting and he responds so well.&rdquo; I tangled my fingers in her hair as she gave another timid lick to my clit and sucked the bud into her mouth, biting down softly. My hips jerked into her then she moaned, flicking her tongue faster. </p><p>&ldquo;I thought you was going to sit on my face, Princess? What&rsquo;s the matter, you gonna pussy out on me?&rdquo; Poe mocked, raising an eyebrow at me. My eyes flew open and over to him where he smirked in return, happy to see that he had caught my attention. </p><p>&ldquo;You smug little fuck.&rdquo; I bit out as Rey moved away from me. He full out grinned then said,&rdquo;Come on, Fox, come let me eat that sweet little pussy like a good girl would.&rdquo; </p><p>I shivered at his words and straddled his face, fingers gripping the bars of the headboard as I slowly lowered myself down. Poe quickly pressed his mouth into my pussy, his tongue working over my clit quickly, humming with delight while he worked me over. </p><p>My eyes fluttered open and I turned my head to find Finn and Rey entertaining one another. Her nimble fingers wrapped around his cock and began stroking him towards his orgasm. </p><p>&ldquo;Go on, lovely, sink down on that gorgeous dick. Wear him out because when I&rsquo;m done with the Commander, I think we&rsquo;re going to take a nap.&rdquo; I encouraged, my head tilting back as my lover worked me closer to the edge. </p><p>&ldquo;Cmon, Fox, come on my face then you can fuck me.&rdquo; Poe murmured, the vibrations making me jerk against his clever mouth. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh my Stars!&rdquo; I cried out, rocking faster as I started to come. I slowly rolled off of his face and he nodded his head towards his straining cock as he mutter,&rdquo;Go on, doll face, show me who&rsquo;s boss.&rdquo; </p><p>I shuffled down on my knees then gave the tip of his dick a couple quick licks, making him jolt at the timid touches. </p><p>But to bring myself and my lover to our orgasms, I finally straddled his hips, gripping the base of his member to lead him to my entrance. Slowly I sunk down on him, my head leaning forward onto his bare chest where I licked and nibbled my way up to his neck, slowly beginning to ride him faster and faster. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, get that dick, baby. C&rsquo;mon, you wanna be boss, you gotta work better than that.&rdquo; Poe taunted, though his breath getting more and more ragged told me the truth. I was doing exactly what I wanted to. </p><p>&ldquo;My Stars, you feel so good.&rdquo; I moaned, eyes locking with Rey, who was attempting to keep her gaze on me while Finn fucked her senselessly. </p><p>&ldquo;Good boy, Finny. Go on, make our lovely come so hard she won&rsquo;t forget your name.&rdquo; I ordered, starting to roll my hips faster against Poe&rsquo;s. I watched with intense eyes as my other lovers started to come, moans and grunts mixing together. </p><p>Finally, Poe began bucking into me, the base of his cock brushing my clit just enough to bring me towards the edge. </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good girl, Fox, come on, come with me.&rdquo;he insisted, panting. My body fell forward as we finished coming together then I reached my hand over sleepily, grabbing the key for his cuffs from the bedside drawer. I unlocked him and his arms curled around me as Finn handed me a clean, damp cloth to clean us up with. </p><p>&ldquo;So, everything went okay then?&rdquo; Poe asked as our significant others curled into us. I sighed then cuddled against him as I replied,&rdquo;Yeah, as okay as it&rsquo;ll go on Hoth, I guess.&rdquo; </p><p>He nodded and Finn said,&rdquo;Well, the important part is that you came him to us safe and without any missing body parts. Now, I believe that I was promised a nap once you were done with our Commander.&rdquo; Rey nodded tiredly, her head dipping onto Poe&rsquo;s chest, as she murmured,&rdquo;A nap sounds so good.&rdquo; </p><p>A knock is what woke me up the next morning. Poe was sprawled across my legs, curled into me, while Rey rested her head in Finn&rsquo;s lap, and Finn curled his left arm underneath my head. I unfortunately had to wake them all up in order for me to greet the person on the other side of the door. </p><p>I scooped up Poe&rsquo;s shirt and pulled it over my head before I approached the door.When I opened it, I felt a sense of dread slam into me. There stood General Organa and her face told me all. I was leaving again. </p><p>&ldquo;General,please-&rdquo; Finn started, sitting up. He was the first to realize what was going on. She smiled sadly, her eyes reading what I knew she felt. She felt horrible for sending me out. </p><p>&ldquo;Finn, if I had a choice, I wouldn&rsquo;t send her away so soon,but the First Order has been sighted near our ship and we need someone to scope it out. We would send Poe, but he&rsquo;s a hot head. Fox is our only option.&rdquo;she insisted, turning towards me. I nodded slightly in understanding before Poe snapped,&rdquo;No. Why the hell does Fox have to be the one to do it? There&rsquo;s plenty of pilots qualified enough to do what you want her to do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Commander, don&rsquo;t start with me. I&rsquo;m not happy about it either. Fox, please be ready in the next half hour.&rdquo; she said, turning towards me. I nodded and she walked away, leaving me alone with my partners. </p><p>Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Rey bury her head in her hands and she sobbed quietly. I turned to Poe and Finn who exchanged unsettled looks before I walked to my girlfriend. </p><p>I pulled her hands away from her face then forced her to look up at me before I kissed her gently. As I pulled away, she crushed me into a hug, sniffling quietly. </p><p>Poe met my eyes with a hard look and I glanced away. Poe always had the hardest time when I left. He hated that I usually went out alone and he knew that he belonged with me on the mission, watching my back. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry.&rdquo; I murmured, turning towards my lovers. I pulled Poe&rsquo;s shirt off and headed towards the bathroom. With a quick five minute shower, the smell of sex was cleared from my body and I was dressed for my latest mission. </p><p>I exited the restroom and there stood my significant others, dressed for the day. Rey&rsquo;s hair was done in the usual style and I smiled gently at the sight of them.</p><p>I hugged her tightly then murmured,&rdquo;I&rsquo;ll be back before you know I&rsquo;m gone.&rdquo; She nodded gently but the moment of her hesitation told me exactly what was going on. She wasn&rsquo;t sure that I&rsquo;d be back as soon as I want to be. I kissed Finn softly then he pulled away, brushing my hair out of my face as he stated,&rdquo;Be safe, please.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Of course I will.&rdquo; And finally, I turned to Poe, who was burning a hole into the wall. I laughed and asked,&rdquo;What&rsquo;d that wall do to you? It&rsquo;s not the one sending me away.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, but I can&rsquo;t exactly glare at the General now can I?&rdquo; he spat, turning his attention to me. I blinked slowly then raised an eyebrow at him before I said,&rdquo;Without me, you&rsquo;d be the one getting sent out constantly to watch the Rebellion&rsquo;s ass. I will be back, Poe. You know I will.&rdquo; </p><p>He nodded slowly then tangled his hand through my hair, bringing me into a kiss. I pulled away after a few moments then gave a last nod to my lovers before joining the General by my X-Wing. </p><p>&ldquo;General, I&rsquo;m ready to go.&rdquo; I informed her, tightening my hands into fists behind my back. She smiled at me and I could tell that she wanted to say something to me, an apology perhaps, but she never said a word. In fact, she just handed me a small map and walked away. </p><p>I unrolled it and realized that it was no ordinary map. It was a map of the First Order&rsquo;s ship. At the corner of the paper,the General had written something for me in fine print. </p><p><i>&ldquo;Fox, I understand that you just returned but we need you to do this. If you are captured, and I fear that you will be, this is a map of the Supremacy. The rooms are labeled and it will guide you to the ships that they have. You are to do a simple perimeter check if you will, around our ship. Please be safe. -General Leia Organa.&rdquo; </i></p><p>I looked up and realized that M4-S9 wasn&rsquo;t in my X-Wing then it hit me. I was really going in alone. There was something that the General wasn&rsquo;t telling me, but if it&rsquo;s too dangerous to take my droid with me, then it was definitely too dangerous to take my hot headed boyfriend along for the ride. </p><p>I took a deep breath then entered my X-Wing, securing everything in its proper place, and stuffed the map inside of my boot, since no one checks shoes, before starting up my ship. </p><p>I did a perimeter check around our ship, just as the General ordered, but when I started heading towards the hanger doors, that&rsquo;s when I saw it. The Supremacy, right in front of my face. I took a deep breath then muttered to myself,&rdquo;I can&rsquo;t believe that I&rsquo;m going to do this.&rdquo;</p><p>Their hanger doors were wide open and it was so easy to get in. I could get in and out without anyone noticing. I could get more information than anyone else had ever gotten from the First Order. I could change the course of the war. I stepped out of my X-Wing and glanced around, being as careful as possible, then I hurried towards the door that I thought led out of the hanger. </p><p>But that didn&rsquo;t exactly work out. Someone slammed something into the back of my head and I fell face forward on to the floor. </p><p>When I woke, that&rsquo;s when I realized that I had really fucked up. My wrists were restrained by chains and I could feel the Force in the room. It was thick and heady. I turned to look around and groaned as pain jolted through my head then someone stated,&rdquo;Do not even think about escaping. There&rsquo;s no point. Even if you do get out of the chains, you have no idea how to get around this ship.&rdquo; </p><p>I glanced up slowly when the person emerged from the dark and I lowered my head as it hit me. I was Kylo Ren&rsquo;s prisoner. And no one knew about it either. </p></p>",

Jyn is sitting propped against the trunk, Bodhi\u2019s head in her lap. He\u2019s reading what sounds like Peter Pan to her while she does her best to distract him, running her fingers over his face, down his nose, circling his mouth, flicking under his chin. Cassian watches quietly, not wanting to break the moment. He wonders, not for the first time, why they keep inviting him to hang out when they could be alone together. </p><p>He\u2019d spent the first week at Jedha High eating with different people each day, with whoever shared his pre-lunch class. Then on Friday he\u2019d been paired with Jyn in Spanish, and Bodhi in Art, and it had been easy to fall in with them. He\u2019d eaten lunch with them every day since. They were bizarre. On paper he never would have picked them as friends - Jyn was angry, all sharp edges, and easily mistaken as a loner type except she was never seen without Bodhi, who always seemed to be fidgeting with something, could vague out for half a conversation, and stumbled over the words he did say. But Jyn was less detached than she led people to believe. She was like his cat, Kay, standoffish until she trusted you and then it was nothing but flopping against you, demanding attention, and bringing you dead mice. And Bodhi was even sharper than Jyn sometimes, he startled laughs out of Cassian and then ducked his head, hair falling in his face. Cassian almost had to sit on his hands to stop himself reaching out and brushing it back. </p><p>And now they were waiting for him under a tree, and he felt way out of his depth. So far out he couldn\u2019t see land anymore. He shakes himself. They are just his friends. Besides, it looks like they have carrot sticks on their platter, and he loves carrot sticks. He walks over and drops casually onto the rug, as though he hasn\u2019t been staring like a huge weirdo. </p><p>\u2018You made it,\u2019 Bodhi says, smiling and pulling himself upright. </p><p>Jyn offers a fist to bump. \u2018Thought you were never going to make those last 100 metres.\u2019 </p><p>Cassian feels himself blush, but he doesn\u2019t break eye contact. Bodhi just shakes his head at the two of them. Fond. It\u2019s easy to fall into a rhythm after that. They rile each other up, try to make each other laugh, and end up unable to look each other in the eyes without giggling for about fifteen minutes. They eat, and keep talking shit, and then school comes up, as it always does. When Jyn asks how Mr Malbus and Mr Imwe are, Cassian learns that their Gym and Philosophy teachers are Bodhi\u2019s foster fathers. They ask Cassian how he\u2019s liking Jedha, and he tells them about moving out of the city after his mum died because everything there reminded Dad of her.

Wait til you meet Saw.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Yeah,\u2019 Bodhi nods. His hand was already resting on Cassian\u2019s ankle, and he gives it a squeeze. \u2018Let\u2019s maybe avoid that particular parental meeting for the time being.\u2019 Jyn snorts laughter and cracker dust everywhere. </p><p>\u2018Yeah, no. No one is meeting Saw. Not unless it is in a very public place with many, many exit strategies.\u2019</p><p>\u2018He can\u2019t be that bad,\u2019 Bodhi says, but even Cassian knows that this is a well worn topic of conversation. </p><p>\u2018Oh he is.

Cassian is so grateful to have found people who don\u2019t push, who have learned where his boundaries are and don\u2019t step over them. He is fucked.

When he inevitably doesn\u2019t understand that you are wooing him (a reasonable response because there are two of you and he might not believe he deserves you both, something you will need to debunk often if the aforementioned Plan B works out) take him on a date. Explain that it is a date.\u2019 He flips the notebook closed and looks at Jyn with exaggerated seriousness. \u2018Sounds like it worked to me too.\u2019</p><p>\u2018What about you Andor? You get a say in this craziness. Did it work?\u2019 As cool as she sounds, Cassian can see her face, can see the way she\u2019s biting the inside of her lip. They mean this, he realises all of a sudden. They mean it. This was a date. They were wooing him. </p><p>He closes his eyes and takes a deep breath. \u2018Yeah. I\u2019d say it did.\u2019</p><p>When he opens his eyes to twin beams.

                "content": "<p><blockquote><p>for those of you who are wondering, this follows on from this <a href=\"http://manycoloureddays.tumblr.com/post/155941490590/18-this-is-without-a-doubt-the-stupidest-plan\">rogue ot3 hs au</a></p><p><b>in which Cassian really doesn&rsquo;t know he&rsquo;s going on a date at all</b></p></blockquote><p>Cassian finds them on a picnic rug underneath a tree, at the far end of the park, out where it backs onto the creek. Jyn is sitting propped against the trunk, Bodhi&rsquo;s head in her lap. He&rsquo;s reading what sounds like Peter Pan to her while she does her best to distract him, running her fingers over his face, down his nose, circling his mouth, flicking under his chin. Cassian watches quietly, not wanting to break the moment. He wonders, not for the first time, why they keep inviting him to hang out when they could be alone together. </p><p>He&rsquo;d spent the first week at Jedha High eating with different people each day, with whoever shared his pre-lunch class. Then on Friday he&rsquo;d been paired with Jyn in Spanish, and Bodhi in Art, and it had been easy to fall in with them. He&rsquo;d eaten lunch with them every day since. They were bizarre. On paper he never would have picked them as friends - Jyn was angry, all sharp edges, and easily mistaken as a loner type except she was never seen without Bodhi, who always seemed to be fidgeting with something, could vague out for half a conversation, and stumbled over the words he did say. But Jyn was less detached than she led people to believe. She was like his cat, Kay, standoffish until she trusted you and then it was nothing but flopping against you, demanding attention, and bringing you dead mice. And Bodhi was even sharper than Jyn sometimes, he startled laughs out of Cassian and then ducked his head, hair falling in his face. Cassian almost had to sit on his hands to stop himself reaching out and brushing it back. </p><p>And now they were waiting for him under a tree, and he felt way out of his depth. So far out he couldn&rsquo;t see land anymore. He shakes himself. They are just his friends. Besides, it looks like they have carrot sticks on their platter, and he loves carrot sticks. He walks over and drops casually onto the rug, as though he hasn&rsquo;t been staring like a huge weirdo. </p><p>&lsquo;You made it,&rsquo; Bodhi says, smiling and pulling himself upright. </p><p>Jyn offers a fist to bump. &lsquo;Thought you were never going to make those last 100 metres.&rsquo; </p><p>Cassian feels himself blush, but he doesn&rsquo;t break eye contact. Bodhi just shakes his head at the two of them. Fond. It&rsquo;s easy to fall into a rhythm after that. They rile each other up, try to make each other laugh, and end up unable to look each other in the eyes without giggling for about fifteen minutes. They eat, and keep talking shit, and then school comes up, as it always does. When Jyn asks how Mr Malbus and Mr Imwe are, Cassian learns that their Gym and Philosophy teachers are Bodhi&rsquo;s foster fathers. They ask Cassian how he&rsquo;s liking Jedha, and he tells them about moving out of the city after his mum died because everything there reminded Dad of her. Jyn reaches for his hand when he starts talking about how paranoid his dad is getting, how he keeps talking about how Mum was killed instead of saying she died in an accident. </p><p>&lsquo;I know all about paranoid guardians. Wait til you meet Saw.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Yeah,&rsquo; Bodhi nods. His hand was already resting on Cassian&rsquo;s ankle, and he gives it a squeeze. &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s maybe avoid that particular parental meeting for the time being.&rsquo; Jyn snorts laughter and cracker dust everywhere. </p><p>&lsquo;Yeah, no. No one is meeting Saw. Not unless it is in a very public place with many, many exit strategies.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;He can&rsquo;t be that bad,&rsquo; Bodhi says, but even Cassian knows that this is a well worn topic of conversation. </p><p>&lsquo;Oh he is. I think I&rsquo;d die of embarrassment. He is the living embodiment of the shovel talk.&rsquo;</p><p>And just like that they aren&rsquo;t talking about Cassian&rsquo;s parents anymore. It was such a subtle subject change he almost believes it&rsquo;s natural. Except he knows it wasn&rsquo;t, because they&rsquo;re still holding onto him. Cassian is so grateful to have found people who don&rsquo;t push, who have learned where his boundaries are and don&rsquo;t step over them. He is fucked. So very fucked. </p><p>He pulls back from them, and kneels. &lsquo;Well, &nbsp;I should head home.&rsquo; He really doesn&rsquo;t want to go. &lsquo;Finish up the homework I&rsquo;ve left to the last minute.&rsquo; </p><p>Jyn says nothing, but Bodhi bursts out, &lsquo;No, don&rsquo;t leave. We had a plan. See.&rsquo; Cassian takes the notebook from his hand. It says &ldquo;English&rdquo; in tiny handwriting at the top of front page, which is then covered in technical drawings and calculations. He flicks through a couple of pages, sees game after game of Hangman, and the stick figure comics he knows Jyn drew because his Spanish notebook is littered with them, and then in big, bold letters at the top of a relatively clean page, The Cassian Situation: Plan A. He scans it, words like &ldquo;crush&rdquo; and &ldquo;negotiation&rdquo; and &ldquo;seduction&rdquo; jumping off the page. It is incredibly detailed - there are subsections and indices and -</p><p>&lsquo;This is the most ridiculous plan I&rsquo;ve ever seen,&rsquo; he blurts out before he can stop himself. He looks up at them and sees that, for some inexplicable reason, they&rsquo;re grinning. </p><p>&lsquo;It worked didn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; Jyn counters. He shakes his head, not because she&rsquo;s wrong but because he is still so confused. None of it makes any sense. </p><p>Bodhi takes the notebook back and reads, &lsquo;Plan B. When he inevitably doesn&rsquo;t understand that you are wooing him (a reasonable response because there are two of you and he might not believe he deserves you both, something you will need to debunk often if the aforementioned Plan B works out) take him on a date.
