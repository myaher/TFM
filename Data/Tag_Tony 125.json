Rolling your eyes you huff out in frustration. You wanted to have the living room to yourself and boyfriend to watch F.R.I.E.N.D.S. which is what you\u2019ve always done after having a rough day.</p><p>\u201cHey why are you standing in the hall?\u201d Steve\u2019s voice appears behind you. \u201cI thought we were going to watch that show of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we are. I\u2019m just debating on if I should put chocolate in the popcorn.\u201d You lie.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Giving you a weird look for your taste in junk food he places a kiss on your forehead and proceeds to the living room. You assume your original position and try to hear what Tony says to Steve, that will help you determine what sort of mood he is in. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Unfortunately the voices remain muffled, not allowing you a clear cut image of his mood. Taking the chance, you take a deep breath and head toward the living room.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going, Tony?\u201d Steve\u2019s voice suddenly appears clearer.</p><p>\u201cI have this headache that comes and goes.\u201d You see Tony run his hand through his hair as you enter the room.</p><p>\u201cThere it is again.\u201d He says glancing your way.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You see Steve\u2019s jaw tighten as he shoots you a sideways glance. Shaking your head you tell him not to start anything. Expelling a silent aggravated huff you plaster a smile to your face and try to be the bigger person.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A few hours later you are curled up with Steve in his bed. Drawing patterns on your thighs you can practically feel Steve\u2019s thoughts running around you.</p><p>\u201cJust say what is on your mind, Steve.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The patterns stop and you feel him sit up behind you. Following suit, you turn to face him. Waiting for him to start you watch his mind search for a way to begin, sometimes he\u2019s not always good with words.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t understand why you\u2019ve been taking his crap lately.\u201d His hands fly up and one lands on your knee. \u201cWhy did you shake your head at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I want to stop driving a wedge between the team.\u201d I take his hand in mine. \u201cSteve we have had so many close call missions because you, or others, are distracted because of me and Tony. He just hates me and that\u2019s that.\u201d</p><p>******</p><p>Present Time</p><p>You slowly enter the living room with a bowl of popcorn. Noticing that no one else is around, you sit on the couch and curl up under a blanket. Turning on the tv you switch it over to Netflix and scroll through your list. Nothing you see sounds good so you end up clicking on F.R.I.E.N.D.S., start it from the beginning, and hope it is enough to distract you from today.</p><p>\u201cHey, (Y/N).\u201d Tony\u2019s voice makes you jump. \u201cI thought you usually watched this when you are feeling down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d You catch your jaw in astonishment. The only other person that you thought knew was Steve.</p><p>\u201cAside from the fact that we have technically lived together for five years?\u201d He moves a bit closer. \u201cI actually pay attention.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Not knowing how to feel about it, you invite Tony to watch a few episodes with you. After some convincing he takes a seat on the other side of the couch. Pressing the play button you try to focus on the show, but strangely you find yourself distracted.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shooting a side glance in Tony\u2019s direction you see his eyes trained on the tv. You wonder why everything feels so weird. Before you wouldn\u2019t have cared that he was around. Now something is different, you are very aware of the distance between you two and a part of you wants him to be the one looking at you.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As if reading your mind his eyes flicker to yours and you instantly redirect your attention to the screen. Feeling slight eye whiplash, you curse yourself for staring. Waiting for him to say something you feel your stomach start to twist.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N)?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tony reaches for the remote to turn down the volume. His eyes find yours and do not waiver as he props his body to face yours. Putting his feet up on the couch, you notice he places them next to yours and you feel your lungs freeze.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Your confused expression attempts to counteract his question. \u201c(Y/N) you\u2019re watching F.R.I.E.N.D.S.\u201d He has progressively leaned in. \u201cSo I will repeat my question. What is wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026\u201d you trail off. This wasn\u2019t something you felt like you could tell Tony, even though you feel like something\u2019s changed. \u201cToday was supposed to be my wedding day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d the answer catches him off guard. Lately you two have been living in your own bubble outside of time. Vision and Rhodey still live here but they haven\u2019t been around.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d you say trying to not get upset. \u201cI know you probably don\u2019t like me talking about him.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The plan today was to watch tv, or really do anything that wasn\u2019t going to let you think about the wedding. But you know that idea flew out the window by the tears that are now streaming down your cheeks. Covering up part of your face with the blanket you pray you magically had the sudden power to become invisible.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Not saying a word Tony comes and lays next to you. His body on the outside of couch, you\u2019re sandwiched in between his body and the back cushions. Feeling a shield protect you from the outside world you allow yourself to silently cry as Tony holds you once again.</p><p>&lt; <a href=\"http://abrunettefangirlnerd.tumblr.com/post/182827872626/unbroken\">Previous</a> \u00a0\u00a0 <a href=\"http://abrunettefangirlnerd.tumblr.com/post/183312699686/unbroken-pairing-tony-x-reader-steve-rogers-x\">Next</a> &gt;</p><p><b>Taglist</b>: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCbV1cF2DMP4gAqwGA6V2YA\">@vesta-ro</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mN14XQgBmuBzjHMgBitAqpQ\">@drabby-abby</a> @sweatyfurystudent <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrJYCPIxFCybo6-CKfVfAzg\">@lilulo-12</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWdEGc0GigICCu4EHGOAn2w\">@ktcat88mph</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2xq6YiNiXgDt-siMWqNUqA\">@mustbeaweasleyginger</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mf9g4aYXQKrDOB3v2yYOXxA\">@animegirlgeeky</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAKZdasNaRHe_ymqB1vWRyw\">@riverdalehoeeeeeee</a> </p>",

Rolling your eyes you huff out in frustration. You wanted to have the living room to yourself and boyfriend to watch F.R.I.E.N.D.S. which is what you\u2019ve always done after having a rough day.</p><p>\u201cHey why are you standing in the hall?\u201d Steve\u2019s voice appears behind you. \u201cI thought we were going to watch that show of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we are. I\u2019m just debating on if I should put chocolate in the popcorn.\u201d You lie.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Giving you a weird look for your taste in junk food he places a kiss on your forehead and proceeds to the living room. You assume your original position and try to hear what Tony says to Steve, that will help you determine what sort of mood he is in. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Unfortunately the voices remain muffled, not allowing you a clear cut image of his mood. Taking the chance, you take a deep breath and head toward the living room.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going, Tony?\u201d Steve\u2019s voice suddenly appears clearer.</p><p>\u201cI have this headache that comes and goes.\u201d You see Tony run his hand through his hair as you enter the room.</p><p>\u201cThere it is again.\u201d He says glancing your way.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You see Steve\u2019s jaw tighten as he shoots you a sideways glance. Shaking your head you tell him not to start anything. Expelling a silent aggravated huff you plaster a smile to your face and try to be the bigger person.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A few hours later you are curled up with Steve in his bed. Drawing patterns on your thighs you can practically feel Steve\u2019s thoughts running around you.</p><p>\u201cJust say what is on your mind, Steve.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The patterns stop and you feel him sit up behind you. Following suit, you turn to face him. Waiting for him to start you watch his mind search for a way to begin, sometimes he\u2019s not always good with words.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t understand why you\u2019ve been taking his crap lately.\u201d His hands fly up and one lands on your knee. \u201cWhy did you shake your head at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I want to stop driving a wedge between the team.\u201d I take his hand in mine. \u201cSteve we have had so many close call missions because you, or others, are distracted because of me and Tony. He just hates me and that\u2019s that.\u201d</p><p>******</p><p>Present Time</p><p>You slowly enter the living room with a bowl of popcorn. Noticing that no one else is around, you sit on the couch and curl up under a blanket. Turning on the tv you switch it over to Netflix and scroll through your list. Nothing you see sounds good so you end up clicking on F.R.I.E.N.D.S., start it from the beginning, and hope it is enough to distract you from today.</p><p>\u201cHey, (Y/N).\u201d Tony\u2019s voice makes you jump. \u201cI thought you usually watched this when you are feeling down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d You catch your jaw in astonishment. The only other person that you thought knew was Steve.</p><p>\u201cAside from the fact that we have technically lived together for five years?\u201d He moves a bit closer. \u201cI actually pay attention.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Not knowing how to feel about it, you invite Tony to watch a few episodes with you. After some convincing he takes a seat on the other side of the couch. Pressing the play button you try to focus on the show, but strangely you find yourself distracted.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shooting a side glance in Tony\u2019s direction you see his eyes trained on the tv. You wonder why everything feels so weird. Before you wouldn\u2019t have cared that he was around. Now something is different, you are very aware of the distance between you two and a part of you wants him to be the one looking at you.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As if reading your mind his eyes flicker to yours and you instantly redirect your attention to the screen. Feeling slight eye whiplash, you curse yourself for staring. Waiting for him to say something you feel your stomach start to twist.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N)?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tony reaches for the remote to turn down the volume. His eyes find yours and do not waiver as he props his body to face yours. Putting his feet up on the couch, you notice he places them next to yours and you feel your lungs freeze.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Your confused expression attempts to counteract his question. \u201c(Y/N) you\u2019re watching F.R.I.E.N.D.S.\u201d He has progressively leaned in. \u201cSo I will repeat my question. What is wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026\u201d you trail off. This wasn\u2019t something you felt like you could tell Tony, even though you feel like something\u2019s changed. \u201cToday was supposed to be my wedding day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d the answer catches him off guard. Lately you two have been living in your own bubble outside of time. Vision and Rhodey still live here but they haven\u2019t been around.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d you say trying to not get upset. \u201cI know you probably don\u2019t like me talking about him.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The plan today was to watch tv, or really do anything that wasn\u2019t going to let you think about the wedding. But you know that idea flew out the window by the tears that are now streaming down your cheeks. Covering up part of your face with the blanket you pray you magically had the sudden power to become invisible.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Not saying a word Tony comes and lays next to you. His body on the outside of couch, you\u2019re sandwiched in between his body and the back cushions. Feeling a shield protect you from the outside world you allow yourself to silently cry as Tony holds you once again.</p><p>&lt; <a href=\"http://abrunettefangirlnerd.tumblr.com/post/182827872626/unbroken\">Previous</a> \u00a0\u00a0 <a href=\"http://abrunettefangirlnerd.tumblr.com/post/183312699686/unbroken-pairing-tony-x-reader-steve-rogers-x\">Next</a> &gt;</p><p><b>Taglist</b>: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCbV1cF2DMP4gAqwGA6V2YA\">@vesta-ro</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mN14XQgBmuBzjHMgBitAqpQ\">@drabby-abby</a> @sweatyfurystudent <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrJYCPIxFCybo6-CKfVfAzg\">@lilulo-12</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWdEGc0GigICCu4EHGOAn2w\">@ktcat88mph</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2xq6YiNiXgDt-siMWqNUqA\">@mustbeaweasleyginger</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mf9g4aYXQKrDOB3v2yYOXxA\">@animegirlgeeky</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAKZdasNaRHe_ymqB1vWRyw\">@riverdalehoeeeeeee</a> </p></p>",
