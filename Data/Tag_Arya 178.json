Then he remembered the real reason he never drank: his father. As his eyes opened, Gendry gave out a low groan. He didn\u2019t even remember going home last night. As he looked around he realised he never did go home. He recognized the room quickly and his blood went cold. He saw the family pictures and the champagne colored romper on the floor as well as a set of lace panties. Then he felt it, the warm body draped over his own. The press of her breasts against his chest. Gendry gulped and tried to lift the covers off of himself and he wanted to scream at what he saw. He was hoping for his underwear but instead all he saw was skin on skin and his manhood pressed against the skin of Arya\u2019s leg. He groaned then, regretting it instantly when Arya\u2019s own eyes fluttered open. The horror he saw flash in her eyes was something he never wanted to experience. It was just as bad as the look she gave him when he abandoned her for Melisandre. She shot up out of the bed in an instant and looked panicked. She had not planned on her body being uncovered, she had not taken the time to assess if she was clothed or not.

Her bare arse on display. Gendry tried with all his might not to look at her, but he couldn\u2019t help it. He knew after this day he would never get to look at her again. It felt like an eternity before she spoke again. She had moved to sit cross legged on the bed. \u201cBy our state of undress, I believe we can both imagine what happened last night.

Gendry covered his eyes with his hands in an attempt to give her privacy. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Gods Gendry don&rsquo;t bother you already saw everything.&rdquo; He removed his hands then and watched as she rifled through her dresser for some clothes. Her bare arse on display. Gendry tried with all his might not to look at her, but he couldn&rsquo;t help it. He knew after this day he would never get to look at her again. It felt like an eternity before she spoke again. She had moved to sit cross legged on the bed. &ldquo;By our state of undress, I believe we can both imagine what happened last night. Other than that I do not remember much else. What about you?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Nothing. I woke up this morning just as confused as you.&rdquo; Gendry answered, &ldquo;to be honest I was worried you&rsquo;d try to kill me when you found out.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t count your blessings yet, there&rsquo;s still time.&rdquo; He had to chuckle at that, he got up warrily and tried to ignore Arya&rsquo;s obvious glance at his manhood. She did an approving motion with her eyebrows and he flushed instantly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine that it happened, I just wish I could remember it.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gendry&rsquo;s head snapped around then, his eyes meeting her own with a piercing look. She stood up and took a threatening step toward him. He was frozen in place and his heart felt like it might beat out of his chest. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve both known the extent of our feelings for one another for some time now. I guess it took os getting blackout drunk to act on them. It&rsquo;s definitely not the most orthodox way of going about things, but maybe it was for the best. We don&rsquo;t have to waste time pretending and lying to ourselves anymore.&rdquo; She stood right in front of him and tilted her head up at him.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;re right.&rdquo; Gendry grabbed her face with his hands and connected their lips slowly. He was deliberate in every move he made snaking an arm around her waist while the other wove itself in her hair. There was no maybe about it. Arya was right and it would be stupid of them to ignore what happened last night, to ignore their feelings once more. There would be no more wasting time.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gendry walked them back to the bed slowly, giving her time to back out if she wanted, but she all but pulled him onto the mattress herself. For the second time in just as many days Gendry blacked out, but not from alcohol. The bliss that overwhelmed him ate at him and sent him over the edge. Neither of them would be leaving this bed today.</p></p>",

While they aren\u2019t exact copies of each other, there are quite a few similarities. Here\u2019s a quick overview of the commonalities between them:</p><ul><li>Wild and Unconventional</li><li>Friendly with the Common People</li><li>Fond of Bastards</li><li>A Time of War</li><li>Sun and the Moon\u00a0</li><li>Protective and Seek Justice</li><li>Little Brother is a King</li></ul><p>More under the cut:</p><h2>Wild and Unconventional</h2><p>This is how GRRM describes Baela in Fire and Blood:</p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"quote\"}'>At ten-and-four, Baela was a wild and willful young maiden, more boyish than ladylike, and very much her father\u2019s daughter. Though slim and short of stature, she knew naught of fear, and lived to dance and hawk and ride. As a younger girl she had oft been chastised for wrestling with squires in the yard, but of late she had taken to playing kissing games with them instead.</p><p>To say Baela was similar to Arya in temperament is clearly an understatement. Considered wild, willful, and\u201cboyish\u201d? Is her father\u2019s daughter, slim and short, and physically active? The wrestling detail could easily be seen as a nod to Arya and Gendry wrestling in ASOS. While we don\u2019t know Arya\u2019s feelings on conventional dancing, we know that she is graceful and is training to be a water dancer.</p><p>Their passionate temperaments are also described in a way that connects them to their House sigil and bond animal:</p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"quote\"}'>&ldquo;Ah, Arya. You have a wildness in you, child. &rsquo;<b>The wolf blood,</b>&rsquo; my father used to call it.\u201d &ndash; Ned, AGOT</p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"quote\"}'>It is said that he and his wife quarreled before the voyage, for Lady Baela was of the<b> blood of the dragon </b>and quick to anger, and had heard too much talk of her lord husband about Princess Aliandra of Dorne.</p><h2>Fond of Bastards</h2><p>Baela grows up engaged to Jacaerys Targaryen, who is believed to be illegitimate, along with two of his other brothers. It\u2019s uncertain whether Baela gave credence to those rumors, but whether she does or not, she is clearly attached to Jace. During the war, she refuses to leave him for the safety of the Vale and wants to got into battle beside him. Baela also announces that she wants to marry him immediately, though he dies before they can. Despite this, she still ends up marrying another bastard, Alyn Velaryon, who she has a stormy yet loving relationship with.</p><p>Similarly, Arya has two significant bastards in her life, Jon Snow and Gendry. GRRM initially intended to pair Arya and Jon romantically. Though he may have moved away from that plan, the two still have the most loving relationship in the series. Arya also becomes close to Gendry. Like Alyn, he is secretly the bastard of a dead royal whose children were sired by another man and who he strongly resembles. Arya could also be said to have something of a stormy yet companionable relationship with Gendry. They argue at times and disagree on the right course of action, yet they respect and trust each other.</p><h2>A Time of War</h2><p>Both Arya and Baela live through a continent-wide war that brings about the deaths of many people they love. Arya loses both of her parents, many friends, and at least one of her older brothers. She also believes she has lost her younger brothers. Baela loses her father, stepmother, fiancee, stepbrothers, grandmother, and believes she lost her youngest brother. Her home is also attacked and captured by enemy forces.</p><p>The war is where the biggest difference between Arya and Baela can be found. They both suffer loses during the wars they endure, but Baela doesn\u2019t survive on the run or have the child soldier arc that Arya does. At least not one that\u2019s any more significant than what all children growing up in this naturally violent society go through. But she does go into combat once and deals the mortal blow to the usurper\u2019s dragon and is wounded. She is also held prisoner and is threatened with murder and maiming until freed.</p><h2>Sun and the Moon</h2><p>During AGOT, Ned describes his daughters as being as different as the sun and the moon. As the Night Wolf with a heavy amount of moon imagery in her POV, Arya is clearly the\u00a0\u201cmoon\u201d in the analogy. She connects to her bond animal, Nymeria, at night with the moon overhead. While training with the Faceless Men, she marks the progress in her training by the moon\u2019s turns. It could even be suggested that the false identities she assumes are connected to the shifts in the ever shifting appearance of the moon. Just as the moon\u2019s shape never truly changes, but simply appears to be waxing and waning, Arya\u2019s core identity is always there even as she puts on different appearances and mannerisms.</p><p>Baela also has a sister who is the sun to her moon. While Baela is unconventional and wild with a dragon she raised from a hatchling and named Moondancer, Rhaena is ladylike and has a dragon named Morning. The first and only time Baela rides Moondancer into battle is during the night just before morning broke.</p><p>It\u2019s also worth noting the similarity between the name of Baela\u2019s dragon, Moondancer, and water dancer, something Arya wants to become.\u00a0</p><h2>Protective and Seeks Justice</h2><p>Instances of Arya being protective of those around her and seeking justice are too numerous to list, from trying to protect Mycah and Weasel to taking additional risk to guard Gendry and Hot Pie and of course the list of criminals she wants brought to justice.</p><p>Baela is also protective of those around her. As mentioned before, she wouldn\u2019t leave Jacaerys for the safety of the Vale and intended on going into battle with him once her dragon was big enough to carry her. Later, she protects a kitchen scullion from getting his hand cut off for fooling around with her and takes up a sword to defend the men who freed her from captivity. It could also be said that she got vengeance for her grandmother Rhaenys when she faced Aegon the Usurper and killed Sunfyre.</p><h2>Friendly with the Common People</h2><p>Arya and Baela are described as making friends with anyone regardless of station:</p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"quote\"}'>Even more gravely, Baela had a taste for unsuitable companions. Like stray dogs, she brought them home with her to the Red Keep, insisting that they be given positions in the castle, or be made part of her own retinue. These pets of hers included a comely juggler, a blacksmith\u2019s apprentice whose muscles she admired, a legless beggar she took pity on, a conjurer of cheap tricks she took for an actual sorcerer, a hedge knight\u2019s homely squire, even a pair of young girls from a brothel, twins,\u00a0\u201c-like us, Rhae.\u201d Once she turned up with an entire troupe of mummers. &ndash; Fire and Blood</p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"quote\"}'>[She] knew all about the sorts of people Arya liked to talk to: squires and grooms and serving girls, old men and naked children, rough-spoken freeriders of uncertain birth. Arya would make friends with anybody. This Mycah was the worst; a butcher&rsquo;s boy, thirteen and wild, he slept in the meat wagon and smelled of the slaughtering block. &ndash; AGOT</p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"quote\"}'>Arya had loved nothing better than to sit at her father&rsquo;s table and listen to them talk. She had loved listening to the men on the benches too; to freeriders tough as leather, courtly knights and bold young squires, grizzled old men-at-arms. She used to throw snowballs at them and help them steal pies from the kitchen. Their wives gave her scones and she invented names for their babies and played monsters-and-maidens and hide-the-treasure and come-into-my-castle with their children. Fat Tom used to call her &quot;Arya Underfoot,&rdquo; because he said that was where she always was. &ndash; AGOT</p><h2>Little Brother is a King</h2><p>Both of Baela\u2019s younger brothers, Aegon and Viserys, became kings. The boys were separated during the war and Viserys is believed dead until he was revealed to be alive after the conflict was won. During Aegon\u2019s reign, Baela was very visible among the people and beloved. When the regents attempt to arrange a marriage for her, she runs away and elopes with a legitimized bastard. She also finds a wife for her brother when his Hand tries to pressure him into marrying his daughter.</p><p>Similarly , Arya\u2019s brothers, Bran and Rickon, were separated after a battle. But they were both believed to have died until Manderly discovered Rickon\u2019s whereabouts and is sending Davos to retrieve him. As of the latest novel, Bran hasn\u2019t returned to Winterfell yet.\u00a0</p><p>Moving in to speculation territory, the sheer fact that we the audience and Bran have been told that he will spend the rest of his existence in the cave he currently lives in can be taken as assurance that the exact opposite will happen and he could return to Winterfell and become king. It\u2019s also possible that Rickon could become king either after Bran or after Bran\u2019s children, should he have any.</p><p>But regardless of whether one or both of her younger brothers become king or a lord, its likely that Arya would be a very visible and beloved presence among the people of the North. It also isn\u2019t unlikely that she would be involved in attempts at marriage alliances arranged by her brother\u2019s regent that she would be resistant to.</p>",

While they aren\u2019t exact copies of each other, there are quite a few similarities. Here\u2019s a quick overview of the commonalities between them:</p><ul><li>Wild and Unconventional</li><li>Friendly with the Common People</li><li>Fond of Bastards</li><li>A Time of War</li><li>Sun and the Moon\u00a0</li><li>Protective and Seek Justice</li><li>Little Brother is a King</li></ul><p>More under the cut:</p><h2>Wild and Unconventional</h2><p>This is how GRRM describes Baela in Fire and Blood:</p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"quote\"}'>At ten-and-four, Baela was a wild and willful young maiden, more boyish than ladylike, and very much her father\u2019s daughter. Though slim and short of stature, she knew naught of fear, and lived to dance and hawk and ride. As a younger girl she had oft been chastised for wrestling with squires in the yard, but of late she had taken to playing kissing games with them instead.</p><p>To say Baela was similar to Arya in temperament is clearly an understatement. Considered wild, willful, and\u201cboyish\u201d? Is her father\u2019s daughter, slim and short, and physically active? The wrestling detail could easily be seen as a nod to Arya and Gendry wrestling in ASOS. While we don\u2019t know Arya\u2019s feelings on conventional dancing, we know that she is graceful and is training to be a water dancer.</p><p>Their passionate temperaments are also described in a way that connects them to their House sigil and bond animal:</p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"quote\"}'>\u201cAh, Arya. You have a wildness in you, child. \u2019<b>The wolf blood,</b>\u2019 my father used to call it.\u201d \u2013 Ned, AGOT</p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"quote\"}'>It is said that he and his wife quarreled before the voyage, for Lady Baela was of the<b> blood of the dragon </b>and quick to anger, and had heard too much talk of her lord husband about Princess Aliandra of Dorne.</p><h2>Fond of Bastards</h2><p>Baela grows up engaged to Jacaerys Targaryen, who is believed to be illegitimate, along with two of his other brothers. It\u2019s uncertain whether Baela gave credence to those rumors, but whether she does or not, she is clearly attached to Jace. During the war, she refuses to leave him for the safety of the Vale and wants to got into battle beside him. Baela also announces that she wants to marry him immediately, though he dies before they can. Despite this, she still ends up marrying another bastard, Alyn Velaryon, who she has a stormy yet loving relationship with.</p><p>Similarly, Arya has two significant bastards in her life, Jon Snow and Gendry. GRRM initially intended to pair Arya and Jon romantically. Though he may have moved away from that plan, the two still have the most loving relationship in the series. Arya also becomes close to Gendry. Like Alyn, he is secretly the bastard of a dead royal whose children were sired by another man and who he strongly resembles. Arya could also be said to have something of a stormy yet companionable relationship with Gendry. They argue at times and disagree on the right course of action, yet they respect and trust each other.</p><h2>A Time of War</h2><p>Both Arya and Baela live through a continent-wide war that brings about the deaths of many people they love. Arya loses both of her parents, many friends, and at least one of her older brothers. She also believes she has lost her younger brothers. Baela loses her father, stepmother, fiancee, stepbrothers, grandmother, and believes she lost her youngest brother. Her home is also attacked and captured by enemy forces.</p><p>The war is where the biggest difference between Arya and Baela can be found. They both suffer loses during the wars they endure, but Baela doesn\u2019t survive on the run or have the child soldier arc that Arya does. At least not one that\u2019s any more significant than what all children growing up in this naturally violent society go through. But she does go into combat once and deals the mortal blow to the usurper\u2019s dragon and is wounded. She is also held prisoner and is threatened with murder and maiming until freed.</p><h2>Sun and the Moon</h2><p>During AGOT, Ned describes his daughters as being as different as the sun and the moon. As the Night Wolf with a heavy amount of moon imagery in her POV, Arya is clearly the\u00a0\u201cmoon\u201d in the analogy. She connects to her bond animal, Nymeria, at night with the moon overhead. While training with the Faceless Men, she marks the progress in her training by the moon\u2019s turns. It could even be suggested that the false identities she assumes are connected to the shifts in the ever shifting appearance of the moon. Just as the moon\u2019s shape never truly changes, but simply appears to be waxing and waning, Arya\u2019s core identity is always there even as she puts on different appearances and mannerisms.</p><p>Baela also has a sister who is the sun to her moon. While Baela is unconventional and wild with a dragon she raised from a hatchling and named Moondancer, Rhaena is ladylike and has a dragon named Morning.

        "caption": "<h2>Day Seven</h2><p><b>Arya and Gendry attend Sansa\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve party.</b></p><!-- more --><p>To say Arya lacked excitement was an understatement. The time had come for her sister\u2019s annual New Year\u2019s Eve celebration. The party was grand and elegant and everything Arya hated. She would rather go to someone\u2019s backyard bonfire that go stand around in some pretentious evening gown while every person sipped champagne. She had to go though. Over the years her and Sansa have put aside their childlike bickering and replaced it with mutual respect. Their family had gone through too much in the past six years since their parents got into a car crash. All that was left of their family were the Stark children. Robb was seventeen and so was their cousin Jon. Since Robb was old enough to become their care dependant they were able to stick together. They never had to worry about money since their family came from old money. They were part of a group of families that descended from nobility. The other families in town called them all the noble families. A group of several families: the Starks, Targaryens, Tyrells, Tarlys, and the Baratheons. Arya loathed most of the children from the so called noble families. She fit in much better with the other people in town rather than the noble houses. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There were a few exceptions to the rule though. She enjoyed the company of Gendry Baratheon. Gendry was the half son of Robert Baratheon and acted nothing like his other siblings. Arya couldn\u2019t say they were all bad. Marcella was nice enough and Tommen was so young, but Joffrey was a royal pain in the ass. He strutted around like he was above everyone else and like they needed to cater to every single one of his evil whims. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Gendry on the other hand always fought for what he wanted; he never left anything up to other people if he had the chance. He understood Arya and appreciated how she never fit the mold either. Together they were able to make it through it all. Well, that was until everyone started to gossip about them. The people in town were spreading nasty rumors about their relationship. They were only ever friends since they were four years apart, but that only added to the drama that the other families tried to create. Those vicious rumors were what lead to the downfall of their friendship. It fell apart slowly. It started with ignoring each other\u2019s text messages and phone calls. Then, they were hanging out less and less. It fell apart completely when Gendry met his ex girlfriend Melisandre. Arya hated her. She was older than Gendry and Arya thought she just wanted to take advantage of him, and that is just what that red-haired witch did. She used him and threw him away like he was nothing. Arya wanted nothing more to be there for him in those moments, but he had thrown her away when Melisandre told him of her dislike for Arya. Gendry apologized to Arya before he broke the news, but how did that make up for him destroying what little friendship they had left. They went for years without speaking to one another. That was until Arya attended the same university as he chose to go to. He was just starting Graduate school when Arya began her freshman year of college. They ran into one another and patched up their friendship as best they could with their past looming over their heads. It would never be the same though not when Arya felt what she did for him. There was constantly this voice in the back of her head questioning what would happen if she finally took that last leap of faith and pressed her lips to his. She wondered if he ever felt the same thing she did. Little did she know Gendry had felt that way for quite a long time. Still, every day it was walking on eggshells from both parties, both worried that one of them would spill their secret. Regardless of their situation they went on with their friendship and made plans to meet at Sansa\u2019s party. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Arya had to compromise with her sister on her outfit for the party. Arya told her she wasn\u2019t going to wear a dress, and Sansa told her she couldn\u2019t wear her \u201cratty clothes\u201d. So compromise they did. Arya would not be showing up in a long flowing gown, she would be showing up in a romper that Sansa picked out herself.

Her cleavage was on full display and she felt so good about how she looked that the thought of being uncomfortable never crossed her mind, not until she walked down the stairs of their estate and into the party.

The time had come for her sister\u2019s annual New Year\u2019s Eve celebration. The party was grand and elegant and everything Arya hated. She would rather go to someone\u2019s backyard bonfire that go stand around in some pretentious evening gown while every person sipped champagne. She had to go though. Over the years her and Sansa have put aside their childlike bickering and replaced it with mutual respect. Their family had gone through too much in the past six years since their parents got into a car crash. All that was left of their family were the Stark children. Robb was seventeen and so was their cousin Jon. Since Robb was old enough to become their care dependant they were able to stick together. They never had to worry about money since their family came from old money. They were part of a group of families that descended from nobility. The other families in town called them all the noble families. A group of several families: the Starks, Targaryens, Tyrells, Tarlys, and the Baratheons. Arya loathed most of the children from the so called noble families. She fit in much better with the other people in town rather than the noble houses. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There were a few exceptions to the rule though. She enjoyed the company of Gendry Baratheon. Gendry was the half son of Robert Baratheon and acted nothing like his other siblings. Arya couldn\u2019t say they were all bad. Marcella was nice enough and Tommen was so young, but Joffrey was a royal pain in the ass. He strutted around like he was above everyone else and like they needed to cater to every single one of his evil whims. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Gendry on the other hand always fought for what he wanted; he never left anything up to other people if he had the chance. He understood Arya and appreciated how she never fit the mold either. Together they were able to make it through it all. Well, that was until everyone started to gossip about them. The people in town were spreading nasty rumors about their relationship. They were only ever friends since they were four years apart, but that only added to the drama that the other families tried to create. Those vicious rumors were what lead to the downfall of their friendship. It fell apart slowly. It started with ignoring each other\u2019s text messages and phone calls. Then, they were hanging out less and less. It fell apart completely when Gendry met his ex girlfriend Melisandre. Arya hated her. She was older than Gendry and Arya thought she just wanted to take advantage of him, and that is just what that red-haired witch did. She used him and threw him away like he was nothing. Arya wanted nothing more to be there for him in those moments, but he had thrown her away when Melisandre told him of her dislike for Arya. Gendry apologized to Arya before he broke the news, but how did that make up for him destroying what little friendship they had left. They went for years without speaking to one another. That was until Arya attended the same university as he chose to go to. He was just starting Graduate school when Arya began her freshman year of college. They ran into one another and patched up their friendship as best they could with their past looming over their heads. It would never be the same though not when Arya felt what she did for him. There was constantly this voice in the back of her head questioning what would happen if she finally took that last leap of faith and pressed her lips to his. She wondered if he ever felt the same thing she did. Little did she know Gendry had felt that way for quite a long time. Still, every day it was walking on eggshells from both parties, both worried that one of them would spill their secret. Regardless of their situation they went on with their friendship and made plans to meet at Sansa\u2019s party. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Arya had to compromise with her sister on her outfit for the party. Arya told her she wasn\u2019t going to wear a dress, and Sansa told her she couldn\u2019t wear her \u201cratty clothes\u201d. So compromise they did. Arya would not be showing up in a long flowing gown, she would be showing up in a romper that Sansa picked out herself.
