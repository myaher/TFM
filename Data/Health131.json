        "body": "Hello, hello! Happy Friday to all of you!\n<p>How was your week? I know last week was the first official week of 2019 but this week felt like the real return to normalcy after the holiday season. Chase clearly caught wind of the fact that Christmas is over because he said \u2014 ahem, whined \u2014 \u201cI want it to be Christmas again. I don\u2019t like all of the other days.\u201d Granted Chase said this when he was in a serious mood (both hungry and tired) and caught sight of someone taking down their Christmas lights as we were driving, but still\u2026 I get it. Apparently the post-holiday blues are genetic.</p>\n<p>Despite the fact that the holiday season is over, we had a pretty good week over here! I was personally very ready to get back into the swing of things and, since Chase was back in preschool and Ryder napped pretty well, I had a little more time to blog (see my bazillon-word post about <a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/sleep-training-after-the-4-month-sleep-regression/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sleep training after the 4 month sleep regression</a>) and our house no longer looks like a complete disaster. All wins!</p>\n<p>Do you guys have any plans for the weekend? We don\u2019t have too much on the agenda and the weather looks like it will be a bit cloudy and rainy, so I\u2019m hoping to figure something out to get out of the house at some point. We\u2019re also planning another family movie night after having so much fun watching The Lion King together last weekend. I\u2019m kind of hoping movie nights become more and more of a thing around here now that Chase is a bit older and more into movies the whole family enjoys (Disney!) rather than just little kid stuff. I was worried cuddles would stop once Chase became a bit older but thankfully he\u2019s all about getting \u201ccozy, cozy\u201d under big blankets and cuddling up with me, Dad, Baby Ryder and Sadie for movie night!</p>\n<p>Aaand now that I rambled on a little too long in the intro of today\u2019s post, let\u2019s hop right into the real reason you\u2019re probably here: Things I\u2019m Loving Friday fun!!</p>\n<h4>Things I\u2019m Loving Friday</h4>\n<ul><li>\n<h4><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2AEwSrr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nine Perfect Strangers</a> by Liane Moriarty</h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/nine-perfect-strangers-book.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-84730\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/nine-perfect-strangers-book-674x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"265\" height=\"404\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/nine-perfect-strangers-book-674x1024.jpg 674w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/nine-perfect-strangers-book-197x300.jpg 197w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/nine-perfect-strangers-book-768x1168.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 265px) 100vw, 265px\"/></a></p>\n<p>I am a big-time fan of Liane Moriarty\u2019s books and, with the exception of one, I\u2019ve enjoyed all of them. (If you\u2019ve never read any of her books, my favorites are <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2ABLcko\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Husband\u2019s Secret</a>, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2SMVpkP\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Big Little Lies</a> and <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2CYLenP\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">What Alice Forgot</a> \u2014 and I\u2019d recommend all of them over Nine Perfect Strangers as well.) I pre-ordered <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2AEwSrr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nine Perfect Strangers</a> when I saw she had a new novel coming out and couldn\u2019t wait to read it! In true Liane Moriarty fashion, her latest novel had me laughing out loud and flying through the pages as the story unfolded.</p>\n<p>The book takes place at Tranquillum House, a remote luxury health resort, and follows the nine guests attending the resort for a 10-day retreat. Right off the bat, the guests can tell the Tranquillum House is different. Between the \u201cnoble silence\u201d \u2014 a period of time where talking and even eye contact is forbidden \u2014 to the middle-of-the-night meditations, Frances Welty, a former best-selling romance novelist, is unsure whether she should stay or leave, a conundrum that seems to perplex nearly every guest, despite the fact that they\u2019re all intrigued, if not captivated, by the owner of the resort from her stunning physique to her unconventional (and illegal) approaches to healing.</p>\n<p>I enjoyed the book enough to recommend it but it\u2019s actually one of Liane Moriarty\u2019s novels that I would say gets progressively worse as you continue reading rather than more intense, exciting and intriguing. The story is entertaining and her characters are well-developed and interesting but as the plot unfolds it becomes less and less believable and a little too out-there for my personal preferences. While I can say I liked the book, it wasn\u2019t my favorite and I\u2019d point you to some of Liane Moriarty\u2019s previous novels instead if you haven\u2019t read them yet.</p>\n<p>Also, while we\u2019re chatting about books, right before Christmas, I also read Michelle Obama\u2019s memoir, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Cgde4K\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Becoming</a>, which I enjoyed and it made me want to dive into more memoirs/autobiographies, so if you\u2019ve read any you recommend, please let me know! And if you\u2019re looking for a good one, Andre Agassi\u2019s <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2VGJebh\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Open</a> is still my all-time favorite and I promise you don\u2019t have to be a tennis super-fan to love it.</p>\n<ul><li>\n<h4><a href=\"https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1151408&amp;u=826760&amp;m=17025&amp;urllink=&amp;afftrack=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Letterpress Wedding Poem</a></h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3441.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84724\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3441-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"639\" height=\"426\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3441-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3441-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3441-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3441-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3441.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 639px) 100vw, 639px\"/></a></p>\n<p>One of the Christmas presents I was most excited to give to Ryan this year was a <a href=\"https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1151408&amp;u=826760&amp;m=17025&amp;urllink=&amp;afftrack=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">letterpress version</a> of the poem we read to each other at our wedding. Since we were finishing up our <a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/gifting-the-household-project-to-do-list-that-never-gets-donecm_mmcim_-_-blogger-_-pbfingers-_-holiday112918/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">living room update</a>, we both wanted to give each other gifts we could use in that room since the color palate changed from beige/brown to blue/gray/white. We wanted to fill the built-in bookshelves with items that matched the updated room and I turned to <a href=\"https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1151408&amp;u=826760&amp;m=17025&amp;urllink=&amp;afftrack=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Minted</a> to create a personalized gift I thought would look nice on one of the shelves.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3448.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84725\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3448-703x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"391\" height=\"570\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3448-703x1024.jpg 703w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3448-206x300.jpg 206w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3448-768x1119.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3448.jpg 1098w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 391px) 100vw, 391px\"/></a></p>\n<p>I opted for a framed letterpress version of our favorite poem and love the way it turned out! I was able to customize everything from the words and text to the color of the ink (frost) and the frame (brushed silver). I wanted to share this gift idea here just in case you happen to be thinking ahead to Valentine\u2019s Day and might want to surprise a loved one with a quote or poem or something of the sort in a way that would let you view words that mean something to you every day.</p>\n<ul><li>\n<h4><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2RBJmtx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instax Mini Camera</a> from Kim and Carol</h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3453-001.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-84727\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3453-001-1024x764.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"556\" height=\"415\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3453-001-1024x764.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3453-001-300x224.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3453-001-768x573.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3453-001.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 556px) 100vw, 556px\"/></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3472.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-84728\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3472-1024x784.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"556\" height=\"426\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3472-1024x784.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3472-300x230.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3472-768x588.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3472.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 556px) 100vw, 556px\"/></a></p>\n<p>Early in December, I had an incredibly kind blog reader, Kim, reach out to me offering to send Chase a bright red\u00a0Instax Mini camera after she read about his love for taking pictures on the blog. Her email was so sweet not only because of her generous offer but also because she wanted to send me her mother\u2019s camera, an Instax Mini camera she held onto after her mother\u2019s passing last summer.</p>\n<p>She knew her mom, Carol, would love for a little boy to enjoy her camera and kindly offered to send it to Chase. The way she talked about her mother moved me and filled my heart up because I could feel the love Kim and Carol shared through the way Kim wrote about her mother and the pictures she sent my way of her mom with her family. Kim\u2019s thoughtful gesture truly touched me and every time Chase takes a picture with Carol\u2019s camera, I hope that somehow it makes both Kim and Carol smile.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3489.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-84729\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3489-1024x721.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"541\" height=\"382\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3489-1024x721.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3489-300x211.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3489-768x541.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3489.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 541px) 100vw, 541px\"/></a></p>\n<p>I actually just ordered Chase a little <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2CiJG6y\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$8 album</a>\u00a0(blue, of course) for his <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2RBJmtx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instax Mini</a> photos because he\u2019s been keeping them in a \u201cspecial place\u201d and I thought he might enjoy having an album of the pictures he\u2019s taken since he has a bunch from over Christmas, a friend\u2019s birthday pajama party and random around-the-house photos.</p>\n<ul><li>\n<h4><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2M2oiak\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Makeup Brush Cleaning Pad</a></h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3497.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-84733\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3497-1024x731.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"342\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3497-1024x731.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3497-300x214.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3497-768x548.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3497.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\"/></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3493.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-84732\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3493-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"483\" height=\"323\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3493-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3493-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3493-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3493-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3493.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 483px) 100vw, 483px\"/></a></p>\n<p>My mom is the queen of quality stocking stuffers! This <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2M2oiak\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">makeup brush cleaning pad</a> was in my Christmas stocking this year and clearly my mom knew I desperately needed to clean all of my makeup brushes.

            "comment": "<p>Hello, hello! Happy Friday to all of you!\n<p>How was your week? I know last week was the first official week of 2019 but this week felt like the real return to normalcy after the holiday season. Chase clearly caught wind of the fact that Christmas is over because he said \u2014 ahem, whined \u2014 \u201cI want it to be Christmas again. I don\u2019t like all of the other days.\u201d Granted Chase said this when he was in a serious mood (both hungry and tired) and caught sight of someone taking down their Christmas lights as we were driving, but still\u2026 I get it. Apparently the post-holiday blues are genetic.</p>\n<p>Despite the fact that the holiday season is over, we had a pretty good week over here! I was personally very ready to get back into the swing of things and, since Chase was back in preschool and Ryder napped pretty well, I had a little more time to blog (see my bazillon-word post about <a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/sleep-training-after-the-4-month-sleep-regression/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sleep training after the 4 month sleep regression</a>) and our house no longer looks like a complete disaster. All wins!</p>\n<p>Do you guys have any plans for the weekend? We don\u2019t have too much on the agenda and the weather looks like it will be a bit cloudy and rainy, so I\u2019m hoping to figure something out to get out of the house at some point. We\u2019re also planning another family movie night after having so much fun watching The Lion King together last weekend. I\u2019m kind of hoping movie nights become more and more of a thing around here now that Chase is a bit older and more into movies the whole family enjoys (Disney!) rather than just little kid stuff. I was worried cuddles would stop once Chase became a bit older but thankfully he\u2019s all about getting \u201ccozy, cozy\u201d under big blankets and cuddling up with me, Dad, Baby Ryder and Sadie for movie night!</p>\n<p>Aaand now that I rambled on a little too long in the intro of today\u2019s post, let\u2019s hop right into the real reason you\u2019re probably here: Things I\u2019m Loving Friday fun!!</p>\n<h4>Things I\u2019m Loving Friday</h4>\n<ul><li>\n<h4><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2AEwSrr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nine Perfect Strangers</a> by Liane Moriarty</h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/nine-perfect-strangers-book.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-84730\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/nine-perfect-strangers-book-674x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"265\" height=\"404\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/nine-perfect-strangers-book-674x1024.jpg 674w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/nine-perfect-strangers-book-197x300.jpg 197w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/nine-perfect-strangers-book-768x1168.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 265px) 100vw, 265px\"></a></p>\n<p>I am a big-time fan of Liane Moriarty\u2019s books and, with the exception of one, I\u2019ve enjoyed all of them. (If you\u2019ve never read any of her books, my favorites are <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2ABLcko\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Husband\u2019s Secret</a>, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2SMVpkP\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Big Little Lies</a> and <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2CYLenP\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">What Alice Forgot</a> \u2014 and I\u2019d recommend all of them over Nine Perfect Strangers as well.) I pre-ordered <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2AEwSrr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nine Perfect Strangers</a> when I saw she had a new novel coming out and couldn\u2019t wait to read it! In true Liane Moriarty fashion, her latest novel had me laughing out loud and flying through the pages as the story unfolded.</p>\n<p>The book takes place at Tranquillum House, a remote luxury health resort, and follows the nine guests attending the resort for a 10-day retreat. Right off the bat, the guests can tell the Tranquillum House is different. Between the \u201cnoble silence\u201d \u2014 a period of time where talking and even eye contact is forbidden \u2014 to the middle-of-the-night meditations, Frances Welty, a former best-selling romance novelist, is unsure whether she should stay or leave, a conundrum that seems to perplex nearly every guest, despite the fact that they\u2019re all intrigued, if not captivated, by the owner of the resort from her stunning physique to her unconventional (and illegal) approaches to healing.</p>\n<p>I enjoyed the book enough to recommend it but it\u2019s actually one of Liane Moriarty\u2019s novels that I would say gets progressively worse as you continue reading rather than more intense, exciting and intriguing. The story is entertaining and her characters are well-developed and interesting but as the plot unfolds it becomes less and less believable and a little too out-there for my personal preferences. While I can say I liked the book, it wasn\u2019t my favorite and I\u2019d point you to some of Liane Moriarty\u2019s previous novels instead if you haven\u2019t read them yet.</p>\n<p>Also, while we\u2019re chatting about books, right before Christmas, I also read Michelle Obama\u2019s memoir, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Cgde4K\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Becoming</a>, which I enjoyed and it made me want to dive into more memoirs/autobiographies, so if you\u2019ve read any you recommend, please let me know! And if you\u2019re looking for a good one, Andre Agassi\u2019s <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2VGJebh\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Open</a> is still my all-time favorite and I promise you don\u2019t have to be a tennis super-fan to love it.</p>\n<ul><li>\n<h4><a href=\"https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1151408&amp;u=826760&amp;m=17025&amp;urllink=&amp;afftrack=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Letterpress Wedding Poem</a></h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3441.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84724\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3441-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"639\" height=\"426\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3441-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3441-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3441-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3441-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3441.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 639px) 100vw, 639px\"></a></p>\n<p>One of the Christmas presents I was most excited to give to Ryan this year was a <a href=\"https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1151408&amp;u=826760&amp;m=17025&amp;urllink=&amp;afftrack=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">letterpress version</a> of the poem we read to each other at our wedding. Since we were finishing up our <a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/gifting-the-household-project-to-do-list-that-never-gets-donecm_mmcim_-_-blogger-_-pbfingers-_-holiday112918/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">living room update</a>, we both wanted to give each other gifts we could use in that room since the color palate changed from beige/brown to blue/gray/white. We wanted to fill the built-in bookshelves with items that matched the updated room and I turned to <a href=\"https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1151408&amp;u=826760&amp;m=17025&amp;urllink=&amp;afftrack=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Minted</a> to create a personalized gift I thought would look nice on one of the shelves.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3448.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84725\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3448-703x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"391\" height=\"570\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3448-703x1024.jpg 703w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3448-206x300.jpg 206w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3448-768x1119.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3448.jpg 1098w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 391px) 100vw, 391px\"></a></p>\n<p>I opted for a framed letterpress version of our favorite poem and love the way it turned out! I was able to customize everything from the words and text to the color of the ink (frost) and the frame (brushed silver). I wanted to share this gift idea here just in case you happen to be thinking ahead to Valentine\u2019s Day and might want to surprise a loved one with a quote or poem or something of the sort in a way that would let you view words that mean something to you every day.</p>\n<ul><li>\n<h4><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2RBJmtx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instax Mini Camera</a> from Kim and Carol</h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3453-001.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-84727\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3453-001-1024x764.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"556\" height=\"415\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3453-001-1024x764.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3453-001-300x224.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3453-001-768x573.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3453-001.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 556px) 100vw, 556px\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3472.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-84728\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3472-1024x784.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"556\" height=\"426\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3472-1024x784.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3472-300x230.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3472-768x588.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3472.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 556px) 100vw, 556px\"></a></p>\n<p>Early in December, I had an incredibly kind blog reader, Kim, reach out to me offering to send Chase a bright red\u00a0Instax Mini camera after she read about his love for taking pictures on the blog. Her email was so sweet not only because of her generous offer but also because she wanted to send me her mother\u2019s camera, an Instax Mini camera she held onto after her mother\u2019s passing last summer.</p>\n<p>She knew her mom, Carol, would love for a little boy to enjoy her camera and kindly offered to send it to Chase. The way she talked about her mother moved me and filled my heart up because I could feel the love Kim and Carol shared through the way Kim wrote about her mother and the pictures she sent my way of her mom with her family. Kim\u2019s thoughtful gesture truly touched me and every time Chase takes a picture with Carol\u2019s camera, I hope that somehow it makes both Kim and Carol smile.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3489.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-84729\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3489-1024x721.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"541\" height=\"382\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3489-1024x721.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3489-300x211.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3489-768x541.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3489.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 541px) 100vw, 541px\"></a></p>\n<p>I actually just ordered Chase a little <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2CiJG6y\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$8 album</a>\u00a0(blue, of course) for his <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2RBJmtx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instax Mini</a> photos because he\u2019s been keeping them in a \u201cspecial place\u201d and I thought he might enjoy having an album of the pictures he\u2019s taken since he has a bunch from over Christmas, a friend\u2019s birthday pajama party and random around-the-house photos.</p>\n<ul><li>\n<h4><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2M2oiak\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Makeup Brush Cleaning Pad</a></h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3497.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-84733\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3497-1024x731.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"342\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3497-1024x731.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3497-300x214.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3497-768x548.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3497.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3493.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-84732\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3493-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"483\" height=\"323\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3493-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3493-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3493-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3493-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3493.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 483px) 100vw, 483px\"></a></p>\n<p>My mom is the queen of quality stocking stuffers!

(If you\u2019ve never read any of her books, my favorites are <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2ABLcko\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Husband\u2019s Secret</a>, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2SMVpkP\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Big Little Lies</a> and <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2CYLenP\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">What Alice Forgot</a> \u2014 and I\u2019d recommend all of them over Nine Perfect Strangers as well.) I pre-ordered <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2AEwSrr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nine Perfect Strangers</a> when I saw she had a new novel coming out and couldn\u2019t wait to read it! In true Liane Moriarty fashion, her latest novel had me laughing out loud and flying through the pages as the story unfolded.</p>\n<p>The book takes place at Tranquillum House, a remote luxury health resort, and follows the nine guests attending the resort for a 10-day retreat. Right off the bat, the guests can tell the Tranquillum House is different. Between the \u201cnoble silence\u201d \u2014 a period of time where talking and even eye contact is forbidden \u2014 to the middle-of-the-night meditations, Frances Welty, a former best-selling romance novelist, is unsure whether she should stay or leave, a conundrum that seems to perplex nearly every guest, despite the fact that they\u2019re all intrigued, if not captivated, by the owner of the resort from her stunning physique to her unconventional (and illegal) approaches to healing.</p>\n<p>I enjoyed the book enough to recommend it but it\u2019s actually one of Liane Moriarty\u2019s novels that I would say gets progressively worse as you continue reading rather than more intense, exciting and intriguing. The story is entertaining and her characters are well-developed and interesting but as the plot unfolds it becomes less and less believable and a little too out-there for my personal preferences. While I can say I liked the book, it wasn\u2019t my favorite and I\u2019d point you to some of Liane Moriarty\u2019s previous novels instead if you haven\u2019t read them yet.</p>\n<p>Also, while we\u2019re chatting about books, right before Christmas, I also read Michelle Obama\u2019s memoir, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Cgde4K\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Becoming</a>, which I enjoyed and it made me want to dive into more memoirs/autobiographies, so if you\u2019ve read any you recommend, please let me know! And if you\u2019re looking for a good one, Andre Agassi\u2019s <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2VGJebh\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Open</a> is still my all-time favorite and I promise you don\u2019t have to be a tennis super-fan to love it.</p>\n<ul><li>\n<h4><a href=\"https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1151408&amp;u=826760&amp;m=17025&amp;urllink=&amp;afftrack=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Letterpress Wedding Poem</a></h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3441.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-84724\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3441-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"639\" height=\"426\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3441-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3441-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3441-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3441-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3441.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 639px) 100vw, 639px\"></a></p>\n<p>One of the Christmas presents I was most excited to give to Ryan this year was a <a href=\"https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1151408&amp;u=826760&amp;m=17025&amp;urllink=&amp;afftrack=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">letterpress version</a> of the poem we read to each other at our wedding.

The way she talked about her mother moved me and filled my heart up because I could feel the love Kim and Carol shared through the way Kim wrote about her mother and the pictures she sent my way of her mom with her family. Kim\u2019s thoughtful gesture truly touched me and every time Chase takes a picture with Carol\u2019s camera, I hope that somehow it makes both Kim and Carol smile.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3489.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-84729\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3489-1024x721.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"541\" height=\"382\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3489-1024x721.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3489-300x211.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3489-768x541.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3489.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 541px) 100vw, 541px\"></a></p>\n<p>I actually just ordered Chase a little <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2CiJG6y\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$8 album</a>\u00a0(blue, of course) for his <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2RBJmtx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instax Mini</a> photos because he\u2019s been keeping them in a \u201cspecial place\u201d and I thought he might enjoy having an album of the pictures he\u2019s taken since he has a bunch from over Christmas, a friend\u2019s birthday pajama party and random around-the-house photos.</p>\n<ul><li>\n<h4><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2M2oiak\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Makeup Brush Cleaning Pad</a></h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3497.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-84733\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3497-1024x731.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"342\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3497-1024x731.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3497-300x214.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3497-768x548.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3497.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3493.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-84732\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3493-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"483\" height=\"323\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3493-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3493-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3493-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3493-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3493.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 483px) 100vw, 483px\"></a></p>\n<p>My mom is the queen of quality stocking stuffers!

And if you&rsquo;re looking for a good one, Andre Agassi&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2VGJebh\" target=\"_blank\">Open</a> is still my all-time favorite and I promise you don&rsquo;t have to be a tennis super-fan to love it.</p>\n<ul><li>\n<h4><a href=\"https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1151408&amp;u=826760&amp;m=17025&amp;urllink=&amp;afftrack=\" target=\"_blank\">Letterpress Wedding Poem</a></h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3441-1024x682.jpg\">External image</div></p>\n<p>One of the Christmas presents I was most excited to give to Ryan this year was a <a href=\"https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1151408&amp;u=826760&amp;m=17025&amp;urllink=&amp;afftrack=\" target=\"_blank\">letterpress version</a> of the poem we read to each other at our wedding. Since we were finishing up our <a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/gifting-the-household-project-to-do-list-that-never-gets-donecm_mmcim_-_-blogger-_-pbfingers-_-holiday112918/\" target=\"_blank\">living room update</a>, we both wanted to give each other gifts we could use in that room since the color palate changed from beige/brown to blue/gray/white. We wanted to fill the built-in bookshelves with items that matched the updated room and I turned to <a href=\"https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1151408&amp;u=826760&amp;m=17025&amp;urllink=&amp;afftrack=\" target=\"_blank\">Minted</a> to create a personalized gift I thought would look nice on one of the shelves.</p>\n<p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3448-703x1024.jpg\">External image</div></p>\n<p>I opted for a framed letterpress version of our favorite poem and love the way it turned out! I was able to customize everything from the words and text to the color of the ink (frost) and the frame (brushed silver). I wanted to share this gift idea here just in case you happen to be thinking ahead to Valentine&rsquo;s Day and might want to surprise a loved one with a quote or poem or something of the sort in a way that would let you view words that mean something to you every day.</p>\n<ul><li>\n<h4><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2RBJmtx\" target=\"_blank\">Instax Mini Camera</a> from Kim and Carol</h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3453-001-1024x764.jpg\">External image</div></p>\n<p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3472-1024x784.jpg\">External image</div></p>\n<p>Early in December, I had an incredibly kind blog reader, Kim, reach out to me offering to send Chase a bright red&nbsp;Instax Mini camera after she read about his love for taking pictures on the blog. Her email was so sweet not only because of her generous offer but also because she wanted to send me her mother&rsquo;s camera, an Instax Mini camera she held onto after her mother&rsquo;s passing last summer.</p>\n<p>She knew her mom, Carol, would love for a little boy to enjoy her camera and kindly offered to send it to Chase. The way she talked about her mother moved me and filled my heart up because I could feel the love Kim and Carol shared through the way Kim wrote about her mother and the pictures she sent my way of her mom with her family. Kim&rsquo;s thoughtful gesture truly touched me and every time Chase takes a picture with Carol&rsquo;s camera, I hope that somehow it makes both Kim and Carol smile.</p>\n<p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3489-1024x721.jpg\">External image</div></p>\n<p>I actually just ordered Chase a little <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2CiJG6y\" target=\"_blank\">$8 album</a>&nbsp;(blue, of course) for his <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2RBJmtx\" target=\"_blank\">Instax Mini</a> photos because he&rsquo;s been keeping them in a &ldquo;special place&rdquo; and I thought he might enjoy having an album of the pictures he&rsquo;s taken since he has a bunch from over Christmas, a friend&rsquo;s birthday pajama party and random around-the-house photos.</p>\n<ul><li>\n<h4><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2M2oiak\" target=\"_blank\">Makeup Brush Cleaning Pad</a></h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3497-1024x731.jpg\">External image</div></p>\n<p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_3493-1024x683.jpg\">External image</div></p>\n<p>My mom is the queen of quality stocking stuffers! This <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2M2oiak\" target=\"_blank\">makeup brush cleaning pad</a> was in my Christmas stocking this year and clearly my mom knew I desperately needed to clean all of my makeup brushes. Confession: I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ve ever cleaned them and if I can it&rsquo;s been so long I can&rsquo;t remember the last time I did it. Is that horrifying or what!?</p>\n<p>Anyway, I made it a point to clean all of my makeup brushes with castile soap and this cleaning pad this week and feel like my face should glow like a newborn baby&rsquo;s now that my brushes are all clean of dirt and pore-clogging grossness. Even if that doesn&rsquo;t happen, I <em>do</em> feel a lot better knowing I&rsquo;m using brushes that are actually clean for the first time in years.</p>\n<ul><li>\n<h4>Friday Flashbacks</h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/high-protein-frozen-hot-chocolate-collagen/\" target=\"_blank\">High Protein Frozen Mint Hot Chocolate</a></strong> (This one has a 4.7-star average rating from 20+ reviews and is such a great way to satisfy a raging sweet tooth in a healthy way!)</p>\n<p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/High-Protein-Frozen-Hot-Chocolate.jpg\">External image</div></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/butternut-squash-grain-bowl/\" target=\"_blank\">Butternut Squash Grain Bowl</a></strong> (One of my all-time favorite meatless meals and it makes fantastic leftovers for lunch!)</p>\n<p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Butternut-Squash-Grain-Bowl.jpg\">External image</div></p>\n<h4><strong>Question of the Day&nbsp;</strong></h4>\n<p><strong>What is one thing making you smile this week?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/things-im-loving-friday-263/\">Things I&rsquo;m Loving Friday #263</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com\">Peanut Butter Fingers</a>.</p><br /><br />\nfrom Health &amp; Wellness <a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/things-im-loving-friday-263/\">https://www.pbfingers.com/things-im-loving-friday-263/</a><br />\nvia <a href=\"http://www.rssmix.com/\">http://www.rssmix.com/</a></p>",

I am determined, and I know I&rsquo;ll break through!</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\"><br /></p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">Now that we have been through one week of our new schedule, I think I have officially decided to restart intermittent fasting this Sunday into Monday. I think that will help the excessive appetite I have seemed to have lately. I have been trying to fill myself with healthy snacks, but sometimes it has been late at night - and the snack not AS HEALTHY as it could be. Not for a late night snack, anyway.</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\"><br /></p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">Also, my ankle seems to be getting better (thank goodness) so I&rsquo;ll try to start incorporating light workouts as soon as I can. If not this coming week, definitely the next I&rsquo;d say. </p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\"><br /></p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">That&rsquo;s the jist of what I wrote the first time. I&rsquo;m gonna go start my Friday. Hope you all have a good one! </p></p>",
