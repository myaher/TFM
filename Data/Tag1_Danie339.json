Luckily, we were able to patch that up in surgery, but he will still need surgery on his right leg as it is severely fractured, but we need to wait until his pneumonia clears up a bit more for a safe procedure. But what I am really concerned with, Phil, is that Dan seems to have permanently regressed to a child-like state. It appears the trauma he endured was too much for his brain to process properly and he regressed and never fully came out of it.&rdquo; </i>He quickly moved forward after he saw the fear flash in Phil&rsquo;s eyes<i>. &ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;m not saying this is a permeate state, he could regress back at any time, but we have no way of know how long he will be regressed or when he will feel comfortable enough coming back. That will be up to him.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Phil swallowed. \u00a0</p><p><i>&ldquo;How long until he can come home?&rdquo; \u00a0</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Well, we will keep him for a few more days so he can have the surgery on his leg, and then we would like to transfer him a psychiatric hospital where they will be better equipped to deal with his condition.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Phil&rsquo;s heart started to race.</p><p><i>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t need to go to another hospital. What he needs is to come home with me.&rdquo; </i>He said, starting to get angry.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Phil, we need to look at what is best for Dan here.&rdquo; \u00a0</i></p><p>Phil&rsquo;s blood boiled with rage. Was the doctor really implying he didn&rsquo;t want the best for his boyfriend?</p><p><i>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s best for Dan is to come home with me and be surrounded by his friends and family, where he can feel safe, not shipped off to another hospital.&rdquo; </i>He said, not backing down.</p><p>Doctor Shepherd sighed, &ldquo;<i>Well, I can&rsquo;t make him stay, but I highly advise it. If he doesn&rsquo;t we will need to set up an intense therapy seclude right way. The sooner we get started the better the outcome.&rdquo; \u00a0</i></p><p>Phil just nodded his head. \u00a0</p><p><i>&ldquo;Based on your reaction, I guess Daniel will not be staying after we clear him, so I will get started on making some phone calls to therapists.&rdquo;</i></p><p>He thanked the doctor and left.</p><p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p><p>The next few days Dan and Phil barely had any time to themselves. Between both their families, friends, and the police, almost every moment was taken up. But that didn&rsquo;t stop Dan from clinging to Phil every moment he was awake. It had gotten so bad, that when Phil had left the room to use the restroom while Dan slept, they had been forced to give Dan a sedative because he had woken up screaming and crying for him. \u00a0</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t until the second day that Phil had learned that there had been two kidnappers. The police couldn&rsquo;t get much out of Dan, just sobs and vague details that they hurt him really bad, and they were angry that Dan wouldn&rsquo;t give them any more information. They were under the impression that he was faking it and just didn&rsquo;t want to talk to them. They also couldn&rsquo;t get anything out of Seth about his partner\u2014he refused to say anything to the police whatsoever. \u00a0</p><p>Phil was frustrated because they still hadn&rsquo;t caught the other kidnapper, but he couldn&rsquo;t be angry as he knew they really had no information to go on except what little info Dan had given them.</p><p>It was three days after Dan had been rescued that his pneumonia finally cleared up enough that he could have surgery on his leg. They had to insert a small metal bar into the bone for it to heal properly, and his leg was now wrapped in a cast.</p><p>By the fifth day, both his and Dan&rsquo;s families had gone as they couldn&rsquo;t stay away from their lives any longer. After a tearful goodbye, Dan and Phil were finally left by themselves.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Daddy, come cuddle me.&rdquo; </i>Dan whined. Chuckling, Phil made his way over to the bed.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Move over, love.&rdquo;</i> Dan moved to give Phil some room. He crawled into bed, being careful to not touch Dan&rsquo;s leg or wrap his arm around him too tight.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Daddy, when can we go home? I miss my stuffies.&rdquo; </i>He whined again.</p><p>Phil sighed<i> &ldquo;Soon, love. Soon, I promise.&rdquo;</i></p><p>As much as he loved little Dan, he really wished his Dan was back. He missed his boyfriend. He just wished that everything would go back to normal.</p><p>&hellip;.</p><p>A week after Dan was rescued, he was cleared to go home. \u00a0</p><p><i>&ldquo;Are you ready to go home, love?&rdquo; </i>Phil asked Dan as he started collecting the endless papers Dan had colored in at the hospital over the week. \u00a0</p><p><i>&ldquo;Yes, daddy!&rdquo;</i> He called from his bed.</p><p>Phil thought that Dan would take this all pretty hard, but other than his clinginess he was perfectly fine. Whenever anyone asked about anything to do with the week he was gone, he claimed he didn&rsquo;t remember anything. This has started after the first initial interview with the detectives. Doctor Shepherd had said that they shouldn&rsquo;t push him into talking or remembering before he was ready, so despite how hard it was, Phil had to try and act like everything was normal. \u00a0</p><p><i>&ldquo;Ready, bear? I don&rsquo;t want to hurt you.&rdquo;</i> Phil stood by the edge of the bed.</p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready daddy.&rdquo;</i> Dan beamed at him.</p><p>Even after a week, Dan&rsquo;s face still was bruised and battered looking. But it warmed Phil&rsquo;s heart to see a smile on it nevertheless. He leaned over and carefully scooped Dan up, being quick and careful to transfer him to the wheelchair.</p><p>He just got Dan situated as the Doctor walked into the room and handed Phil Dan&rsquo;s discharge papers. He explained to Phil that Dan was not in the state of mind to sign himself out of the hospital, and that he was Phil&rsquo;s responsibility. He signed the papers and thanked the doctor again.</p><p><i>&ldquo;I just hope you know what your doing. Dan is going to be very traumatized when he regresses back. Make sure he gets to his therapy appointments.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry I will.&rdquo; </i>Phil said with a pressed smile.</p><p>Without another word, the doctor waved goodbye to Dan and turned around and walked out.</p><p>Phil sighed as he looked at his phone. PJ should be here soon to help him get Dan into the cab.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Ok, we&rsquo;re leaving now, bear.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Phil pushed Dan&rsquo;s wheelchair down the hall and to the elevator.</p><p>Once they got outside Phil smiled as he saw PJ sitting there with the cab waiting for him.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Hi Dan, how are you doing, buddy?&rdquo;</i></p><p>Dan pulled Phil&rsquo;s shirt sleeve and hid behind it.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Sorry, PJ, he doesn&rsquo;t really talk to anyone, but me these days.</i>&rdquo; Phil sighed.</p><p><i>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s alright, Phil, from what you have told me he&rsquo;s been through a lot.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Phil hadn&rsquo;t gone into details when he told their family and friends what had happened to Dan. He hadn&rsquo;t been able to bring himself to tell them that he had been raped and violated.</p><p>PJ bent down to look at Dan. \u00a0</p><p><i>&ldquo;Get better, ok, buddy?&rdquo;</i></p><p>Dan clung to Phil as he transferred him to the cab. Once he had him situated in the backseat he helped PJ put the wheelchair in the trunk. They didn&rsquo;t have one of their own, so they were lucky the hospital lent them one of theirs.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Thanks, Peej,&rdquo;</i> Phil said.</p><p><i>&ldquo;No problem, mate, I love you both so much.&rdquo; </i>He said pulling Phil into a hug. \u00a0</p><p>Phil knew Dan was getting impatient, so he said bye to PJ again and hopped in the back seat with Dan. They were going home finally.</p>",

Luckily, we were able to patch that up in surgery, but he will still need surgery on his right leg as it is severely fractured, but we need to wait until his pneumonia clears up a bit more for a safe procedure. But what I am really concerned with, Phil, is that Dan seems to have permanently regressed to a child-like state. It appears the trauma he endured was too much for his brain to process properly and he regressed and never fully came out of it.\u201d </i>He quickly moved forward after he saw the fear flash in Phil\u2019s eyes<i>. \u201cNow, I\u2019m not saying this is a permeate state, he could regress back at any time, but we have no way of know how long he will be regressed or when he will feel comfortable enough coming back. That will be up to him.\u201d</i></p><p>Phil swallowed. \u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cHow long until he can come home?\u201d \u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cWell, we will keep him for a few more days so he can have the surgery on his leg, and then we would like to transfer him a psychiatric hospital where they will be better equipped to deal with his condition.\u201d</i></p><p>Phil\u2019s heart started to race.</p><p><i>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t need to go to another hospital. What he needs is to come home with me.\u201d </i>He said, starting to get angry.</p><p><i>\u201cPhil, we need to look at what is best for Dan here.\u201d \u00a0</i></p><p>Phil\u2019s blood boiled with rage. Was the doctor really implying he didn\u2019t want the best for his boyfriend?</p><p><i>\u201cWhat\u2019s best for Dan is to come home with me and be surrounded by his friends and family, where he can feel safe, not shipped off to another hospital.\u201d </i>He said, not backing down.</p><p>Doctor Shepherd sighed, \u201c<i>Well, I can\u2019t make him stay, but I highly advise it. If he doesn\u2019t we will need to set up an intense therapy seclude right way. The sooner we get started the better the outcome.\u201d \u00a0</i></p><p>Phil just nodded his head. \u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cBased on your reaction, I guess Daniel will not be staying after we clear him, so I will get started on making some phone calls to therapists.\u201d</i></p><p>He thanked the doctor and left.</p><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><p>The next few days Dan and Phil barely had any time to themselves. Between both their families, friends, and the police, almost every moment was taken up. But that didn\u2019t stop Dan from clinging to Phil every moment he was awake. It had gotten so bad, that when Phil had left the room to use the restroom while Dan slept, they had been forced to give Dan a sedative because he had woken up screaming and crying for him. \u00a0</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until the second day that Phil had learned that there had been two kidnappers. The police couldn\u2019t get much out of Dan, just sobs and vague details that they hurt him really bad, and they were angry that Dan wouldn\u2019t give them any more information. They were under the impression that he was faking it and just didn\u2019t want to talk to them. They also couldn\u2019t get anything out of Seth about his partner\u2014he refused to say anything to the police whatsoever. \u00a0</p><p>Phil was frustrated because they still hadn\u2019t caught the other kidnapper, but he couldn\u2019t be angry as he knew they really had no information to go on except what little info Dan had given them.</p><p>It was three days after Dan had been rescued that his pneumonia finally cleared up enough that he could have surgery on his leg. They had to insert a small metal bar into the bone for it to heal properly, and his leg was now wrapped in a cast.</p><p>By the fifth day, both his and Dan\u2019s families had gone as they couldn\u2019t stay away from their lives any longer. After a tearful goodbye, Dan and Phil were finally left by themselves.</p><p><i>\u201cDaddy, come cuddle me.\u201d </i>Dan whined. Chuckling, Phil made his way over to the bed.</p><p><i>\u201cMove over, love.\u201d</i> Dan moved to give Phil some room. He crawled into bed, being careful to not touch Dan\u2019s leg or wrap his arm around him too tight.</p><p><i>\u201cDaddy, when can we go home? I miss my stuffies.\u201d </i>He whined again.</p><p>Phil sighed<i> \u201cSoon, love. Soon, I promise.\u201d</i></p><p>As much as he loved little Dan, he really wished his Dan was back. He missed his boyfriend. He just wished that everything would go back to normal.</p><p>\u2026.</p><p>A week after Dan was rescued, he was cleared to go home. \u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cAre you ready to go home, love?\u201d </i>Phil asked Dan as he started collecting the endless papers Dan had colored in at the hospital over the week. \u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cYes, daddy!\u201d</i> He called from his bed.</p><p>Phil thought that Dan would take this all pretty hard, but other than his clinginess he was perfectly fine. Whenever anyone asked about anything to do with the week he was gone, he claimed he didn\u2019t remember anything. This has started after the first initial interview with the detectives. Doctor Shepherd had said that they shouldn\u2019t push him into talking or remembering before he was ready, so despite how hard it was, Phil had to try and act like everything was normal. \u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cReady, bear? I don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d</i> Phil stood by the edge of the bed.</p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m ready daddy.\u201d</i> Dan beamed at him.</p><p>Even after a week, Dan\u2019s face still was bruised and battered looking. But it warmed Phil\u2019s heart to see a smile on it nevertheless. He leaned over and carefully scooped Dan up, being quick and careful to transfer him to the wheelchair.</p><p>He just got Dan situated as the Doctor walked into the room and handed Phil Dan\u2019s discharge papers. He explained to Phil that Dan was not in the state of mind to sign himself out of the hospital, and that he was Phil\u2019s responsibility. He signed the papers and thanked the doctor again.</p><p><i>\u201cI just hope you know what your doing. Dan is going to be very traumatized when he regresses back. Make sure he gets to his therapy appointments.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cDon\u2019t worry I will.\u201d </i>Phil said with a pressed smile.</p><p>Without another word, the doctor waved goodbye to Dan and turned around and walked out.</p><p>Phil sighed as he looked at his phone. PJ should be here soon to help him get Dan into the cab.</p><p><i>\u201cOk, we\u2019re leaving now, bear.\u201d</i></p><p>Phil pushed Dan\u2019s wheelchair down the hall and to the elevator.</p><p>Once they got outside Phil smiled as he saw PJ sitting there with the cab waiting for him.</p><p><i>\u201cHi Dan, how are you doing, buddy?\u201d</i></p><p>Dan pulled Phil\u2019s shirt sleeve and hid behind it.</p><p><i>\u201cSorry, PJ, he doesn\u2019t really talk to anyone, but me these days.</i>\u201d Phil sighed.</p><p><i>\u201cThat\u2019s alright, Phil, from what you have told me he\u2019s been through a lot.\u201d</i></p><p>Phil hadn\u2019t gone into details when he told their family and friends what had happened to Dan. He hadn\u2019t been able to bring himself to tell them that he had been raped and violated.</p><p>PJ bent down to look at Dan. \u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cGet better, ok, buddy?\u201d</i></p><p>Dan clung to Phil as he transferred him to the cab. Once he had him situated in the backseat he helped PJ put the wheelchair in the trunk. They didn\u2019t have one of their own, so they were lucky the hospital lent them one of theirs.</p><p><i>\u201cThanks, Peej,\u201d</i> Phil said.</p><p><i>\u201cNo problem, mate, I love you both so much.\u201d </i>He said pulling Phil into a hug. \u00a0</p><p>Phil knew Dan was getting impatient, so he said bye to PJ again and hopped in the back seat with Dan. They were going home finally.</p></p>",

Luckily, we were able to patch that up in surgery, but he will still need surgery on his right leg as it is severely fractured, but we need to wait until his pneumonia clears up a bit more for a safe procedure. But what I am really concerned with, Phil, is that Dan seems to have permanently regressed to a child-like state. It appears the trauma he endured was too much for his brain to process properly and he regressed and never fully came out of it.&rdquo; </i>He quickly moved forward after he saw the fear flash in Phil&rsquo;s eyes<i>. &ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;m not saying this is a permeate state, he could regress back at any time, but we have no way of know how long he will be regressed or when he will feel comfortable enough coming back. That will be up to him.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Phil swallowed. &nbsp;</p><p><i>&ldquo;How long until he can come home?&rdquo; &nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Well, we will keep him for a few more days so he can have the surgery on his leg, and then we would like to transfer him a psychiatric hospital where they will be better equipped to deal with his condition.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Phil&rsquo;s heart started to race.</p><p><i>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t need to go to another hospital. What he needs is to come home with me.&rdquo; </i>He said, starting to get angry.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Phil, we need to look at what is best for Dan here.&rdquo; &nbsp;</i></p><p>Phil&rsquo;s blood boiled with rage. Was the doctor really implying he didn&rsquo;t want the best for his boyfriend?</p><p><i>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s best for Dan is to come home with me and be surrounded by his friends and family, where he can feel safe, not shipped off to another hospital.&rdquo; </i>He said, not backing down.</p><p>Doctor Shepherd sighed, &ldquo;<i>Well, I can&rsquo;t make him stay, but I highly advise it. If he doesn&rsquo;t we will need to set up an intense therapy seclude right way. The sooner we get started the better the outcome.&rdquo; &nbsp;</i></p><p>Phil just nodded his head. &nbsp;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Based on your reaction, I guess Daniel will not be staying after we clear him, so I will get started on making some phone calls to therapists.&rdquo;</i></p><p>He thanked the doctor and left.</p><p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p><p>The next few days Dan and Phil barely had any time to themselves. Between both their families, friends, and the police, almost every moment was taken up. But that didn&rsquo;t stop Dan from clinging to Phil every moment he was awake. It had gotten so bad, that when Phil had left the room to use the restroom while Dan slept, they had been forced to give Dan a sedative because he had woken up screaming and crying for him. &nbsp;</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t until the second day that Phil had learned that there had been two kidnappers. The police couldn&rsquo;t get much out of Dan, just sobs and vague details that they hurt him really bad, and they were angry that Dan wouldn&rsquo;t give them any more information. They were under the impression that he was faking it and just didn&rsquo;t want to talk to them. They also couldn&rsquo;t get anything out of Seth about his partner&mdash;he refused to say anything to the police whatsoever. &nbsp;</p><p>Phil was frustrated because they still hadn&rsquo;t caught the other kidnapper, but he couldn&rsquo;t be angry as he knew they really had no information to go on except what little info Dan had given them.</p><p>It was three days after Dan had been rescued that his pneumonia finally cleared up enough that he could have surgery on his leg. They had to insert a small metal bar into the bone for it to heal properly, and his leg was now wrapped in a cast.</p><p>By the fifth day, both his and Dan&rsquo;s families had gone as they couldn&rsquo;t stay away from their lives any longer. After a tearful goodbye, Dan and Phil were finally left by themselves.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Daddy, come cuddle me.&rdquo; </i>Dan whined. Chuckling, Phil made his way over to the bed.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Move over, love.&rdquo;</i> Dan moved to give Phil some room. He crawled into bed, being careful to not touch Dan&rsquo;s leg or wrap his arm around him too tight.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Daddy, when can we go home? I miss my stuffies.&rdquo; </i>He whined again.</p><p>Phil sighed<i> &ldquo;Soon, love. Soon, I promise.&rdquo;</i></p><p>As much as he loved little Dan, he really wished his Dan was back. He missed his boyfriend. He just wished that everything would go back to normal.</p><p>&hellip;.</p><p>A week after Dan was rescued, he was cleared to go home. &nbsp;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Are you ready to go home, love?&rdquo; </i>Phil asked Dan as he started collecting the endless papers Dan had colored in at the hospital over the week. &nbsp;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Yes, daddy!&rdquo;</i> He called from his bed.</p><p>Phil thought that Dan would take this all pretty hard, but other than his clinginess he was perfectly fine. Whenever anyone asked about anything to do with the week he was gone, he claimed he didn&rsquo;t remember anything. This has started after the first initial interview with the detectives. Doctor Shepherd had said that they shouldn&rsquo;t push him into talking or remembering before he was ready, so despite how hard it was, Phil had to try and act like everything was normal. &nbsp;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Ready, bear? I don&rsquo;t want to hurt you.&rdquo;</i> Phil stood by the edge of the bed.</p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready daddy.&rdquo;</i> Dan beamed at him.</p><p>Even after a week, Dan&rsquo;s face still was bruised and battered looking. But it warmed Phil&rsquo;s heart to see a smile on it nevertheless. He leaned over and carefully scooped Dan up, being quick and careful to transfer him to the wheelchair.</p><p>He just got Dan situated as the Doctor walked into the room and handed Phil Dan&rsquo;s discharge papers. He explained to Phil that Dan was not in the state of mind to sign himself out of the hospital, and that he was Phil&rsquo;s responsibility. He signed the papers and thanked the doctor again.</p><p><i>&ldquo;I just hope you know what your doing. Dan is going to be very traumatized when he regresses back. Make sure he gets to his therapy appointments.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry I will.&rdquo; </i>Phil said with a pressed smile.</p><p>Without another word, the doctor waved goodbye to Dan and turned around and walked out.</p><p>Phil sighed as he looked at his phone. PJ should be here soon to help him get Dan into the cab.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Ok, we&rsquo;re leaving now, bear.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Phil pushed Dan&rsquo;s wheelchair down the hall and to the elevator.</p><p>Once they got outside Phil smiled as he saw PJ sitting there with the cab waiting for him.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Hi Dan, how are you doing, buddy?&rdquo;</i></p><p>Dan pulled Phil&rsquo;s shirt sleeve and hid behind it.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Sorry, PJ, he doesn&rsquo;t really talk to anyone, but me these days.</i>&rdquo; Phil sighed.</p><p><i>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s alright, Phil, from what you have told me he&rsquo;s been through a lot.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Phil hadn&rsquo;t gone into details when he told their family and friends what had happened to Dan. He hadn&rsquo;t been able to bring himself to tell them that he had been raped and violated.</p><p>PJ bent down to look at Dan. &nbsp;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Get better, ok, buddy?&rdquo;</i></p><p>Dan clung to Phil as he transferred him to the cab. Once he had him situated in the backseat he helped PJ put the wheelchair in the trunk. They didn&rsquo;t have one of their own, so they were lucky the hospital lent them one of theirs.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Thanks, Peej,&rdquo;</i> Phil said.</p><p><i>&ldquo;No problem, mate, I love you both so much.&rdquo; </i>He said pulling Phil into a hug. &nbsp;</p><p>Phil knew Dan was getting impatient, so he said bye to PJ again and hopped in the back seat with Dan.

Phil couldn&rsquo;t tear his eyes away from Dan. On one hand, he couldn&rsquo;t believe that they had found him, and he was ecstatic about it, but it had absolutely broke his heart at how they had found him. The paramedics had refused to tell him anything about Dan&rsquo;s condition, telling him that it wasn&rsquo;t his place and he should wait until they reached the hospital where he could talk to a doctor. Phil sighed as he took a hold of Dan&rsquo;s hand and softly caressed it. He leaned his head back against the wall and closed his eyes, waiting to arrive at the hospital.</p><p>Once they arrived, \u00a0they rushed Dan out of the ambulance. Phil attempted to follow them, but was stopped by a nurse as they rolled Dan behind a door titled\u00a0Emergency Surgery.\u00a0\u00a0He huffed as the nurse led him to the waiting room area. How did they expect him to just sit here? Desperately needing to know what was going on, he walked up to the nurse&rsquo;s desk</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Hi, do you have any news on Dan Howell?&rdquo;</i></b> He asked the same nurse who had led him to the waiting room.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;And who are you?&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m is boyfriend and flatmate, Phil Lester.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>She ruffled through her pages for a minute before she turned her attention back to him.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry we have no information.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>He felt like crying as he walked back to his seat. As he sat there, trying to hold in his tears, his phone in his pocket beeped. Nearly scaring him to death, he pulled it out and saw Louise on the caller ID. He had forgotten in all this chaos to call and let everyone know Dan had been found. He quickly sent a text to both of their families as well as Louise, trusting that she would let everyone know what was going on.</p><p>He had no more than closed his eyes when a voice startled him.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Sir, do you need some help?&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>Phil gave the nurse a confused look. She motioned to his hand which he had forgotten was still wrapped in a towel from when he had cut himself earlier.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Oh..a&hellip;a.. no, I&rsquo;m just here waiting for news on my boyfriend.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Honey, no offense but you&rsquo;re no help to anyone when you&rsquo;re hurt yourself. I promise we&rsquo;ll be back before anyone even notices you&rsquo;re gone.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>Phil wanted to argue with her, but he knew she was right. It could be hours before anyone came out to talk to him. He stood up and nodded his head, and the nurse gave him a sweet smile before leading him away.</p><p>********</p><p>&ldquo;<b><i>Phil, come on!&rdquo;</i></b> Dan whined at his boyfriend, pulling him closer.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Dan, you&rsquo;re drunk.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Sooooo?&rdquo;</i></b> He giggled back to Phil.</p><p>Sighing, he threw his hands up in defeat and let Dan drag him to a nearby bedroom. Phil just hoped none of their friends noticed they were missing.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;PJ&rsquo;s going to kill us if he finds out we fucked in his room,&rdquo;</i></b> Phil said trying to sound annoyed but failing miserably.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Mmm, he won&rsquo;t find out.&rdquo; </i></b>Dan breathed, pulling Phil in for a sloppy kiss.</p><p>Phil returned the kiss, and they made out for a while before Dan changed tactics and started to desperately tug at Phil&rsquo;s shirt.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Want it off.&rdquo; </b></i>He breathed into Phil&rsquo;s neck.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Hold on one minute and lay down I have to use the bathroom.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Phiiillll&rdquo;!</i></b> Dan whined.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Sit down and I will be right back.&rdquo; </i></b>He said using his daddy voice.</p><p>Even drunk, Dan knew not to disobey Phil when he used his daddy voice. So he sat on the bed and nodded his head, &ldquo;<i><b>Yes daddy.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>Giving a smirk of satisfaction, Phil turned around to head to the bathroom.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t even a minute later he returned to the room to find Dan fast asleep on PJ&rsquo;s bed. He chuckled as he got into bed next to him. Wrapping his arm around his waist and pulling him closer, he buried his head in Dan&rsquo;s neck. Dan snored slightly which made him chuckle again. Ignoring the urge telling him they should not be sleeping in their friend&rsquo;s bed, Phil closed his eyes and followed Dan to dreamland.</p><p>********</p><p>Why did he hurt all over? What was going on? What was that beeping? Where was his daddy and his stuffies? All those thoughts ran through his head as he slowly opened his eyes, wincing in pain as he tried to lift his hands. Once the sleep left his eyes he looked around the room he was in\u2014he most definitely was not in his room at home, so where was he? Before he even got the chance to properly think, a woman stuck her head in the door.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Oh you&rsquo;re finally awake.&rdquo;</b></i> She said cheerfully. <i><b>&ldquo;I will be right back let me go get the doctor.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>She came back a moment later, a man trailing behind her.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Hello, Dan, my name is Doctor Shepherd, and I will be your doctor during your time here.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my daddy?&rdquo;</i></b> He questioned, tears springing to his eyes.</p><p>The doctor gave him a confused look.<b><i> &ldquo;Umm I&rsquo;m not sure what you mean, Dan? Is there something I can do for you?&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;I want my daddy! Where are you hiding him!&rdquo;</i></b> he screamed. He was confused and in pain and just wanted to be comforted. The doctor took a step back, frowning, and left the room. He returned just moments later.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Dan, there is someone here who wants to see you.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>Through stifled sobs, Dan looked up and whispered <b><i>&ldquo;Daddy?&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Hey, baby.&rdquo;</b></i> Phil whispered. He took a hesitant step towards Dan, not sure after the freak out he had earlier. All those fears were thrown to the wind as Dan lifted his hands, reaching out for Phil. There were tears still streaming down his face as Dan buried his head into Phil&rsquo;s shoulder.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;D-D-addy I thought you didn&rsquo;t love me anymore!&rdquo; </i></b>He sobbed.</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s heart broke and a sob ripped through his chest as he pulled Dan in closer to him.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Danny, your daddy will always love you, right?&rdquo;</i></b> He pulled Dan away to look into his eyes.</p><p>It took a minute, but Dan nodded his head and started crying again.</p><p>They just sat there, crying together, traumatized by everything that had happened, but happy they were both safe and with each other again.</p>",

Before he even got the chance to properly think, a woman stuck her head in the door.</p><p><i><b>\u201cOh you\u2019re finally awake.\u201d</b></i> She said cheerfully. <i><b>\u201cI will be right back let me go get the doctor.\u201d</b></i></p><p>She came back a moment later, a man trailing behind her.</p><p><b><i>\u201cHello, Dan, my name is Doctor Shepherd, and I will be your doctor during your time here.\u201d</i></b></p><p><b><i>\u201cWhere\u2019s my daddy?\u201d</i></b> He questioned, tears springing to his eyes.</p><p>The doctor gave him a confused look.<b><i> \u201cUmm I\u2019m not sure what you mean, Dan?

Phil couldn\u2019t tear his eyes away from Dan. On one hand, he couldn\u2019t believe that they had found him, and he was ecstatic about it, but it had absolutely broke his heart at how they had found him. The paramedics had refused to tell him anything about Dan\u2019s condition, telling him that it wasn\u2019t his place and he should wait until they reached the hospital where he could talk to a doctor. Phil sighed as he took a hold of Dan\u2019s hand and softly caressed it. He leaned his head back against the wall and closed his eyes, waiting to arrive at the hospital.</p><p>Once they arrived, \u00a0they rushed Dan out of the ambulance. Phil attempted to follow them, but was stopped by a nurse as they rolled Dan behind a door titled\u00a0Emergency Surgery.\u00a0\u00a0He huffed as the nurse led him to the waiting room area. How did they expect him to just sit here? Desperately needing to know what was going on, he walked up to the nurse\u2019s desk</p><p><b><i>\u201cHi, do you have any news on Dan Howell?\u201d</i></b> He asked the same nurse who had led him to the waiting room.</p><p><b><i>\u201cAnd who are you?\u201d</i></b></p><p><b><i>\u201cI\u2019m is boyfriend and flatmate, Phil Lester.\u201d</i></b></p><p>She ruffled through her pages for a minute before she turned her attention back to him.</p><p><b><i>\u201cI\u2019m sorry we have no information.\u201d</i></b></p><p>He felt like crying as he walked back to his seat. As he sat there, trying to hold in his tears, his phone in his pocket beeped. Nearly scaring him to death, he pulled it out and saw Louise on the caller ID. He had forgotten in all this chaos to call and let everyone know Dan had been found. He quickly sent a text to both of their families as well as Louise, trusting that she would let everyone know what was going on.</p><p>He had no more than closed his eyes when a voice startled him.</p><p><b><i>\u201cSir, do you need some help?\u201d</i></b></p><p>Phil gave the nurse a confused look. She motioned to his hand which he had forgotten was still wrapped in a towel from when he had cut himself earlier.</p><p><b><i>\u201cOh..a\u2026a.. no, I\u2019m just here waiting for news on my boyfriend.\u201d</i></b></p><p><b><i>\u201cHoney, no offense but you\u2019re no help to anyone when you\u2019re hurt yourself. I promise we\u2019ll be back before anyone even notices you\u2019re gone.\u201d</i></b></p><p>Phil wanted to argue with her, but he knew she was right. It could be hours before anyone came out to talk to him. He stood up and nodded his head, and the nurse gave him a sweet smile before leading him away.</p><p>********</p><p>\u201c<b><i>Phil, come on!\u201d</i></b> Dan whined at his boyfriend, pulling him closer.</p><p><b><i>\u201cDan, you\u2019re drunk.\u201d</i></b></p><p><b><i>\u201cSooooo?\u201d</i></b> He giggled back to Phil.</p><p>Sighing, he threw his hands up in defeat and let Dan drag him to a nearby bedroom. Phil just hoped none of their friends noticed they were missing.</p><p><b><i>\u201cPJ\u2019s going to kill us if he finds out we fucked in his room,\u201d</i></b> Phil said trying to sound annoyed but failing miserably.</p><p><b><i>\u201cMmm, he won\u2019t find out.\u201d </i></b>Dan breathed, pulling Phil in for a sloppy kiss.</p><p>Phil returned the kiss, and they made out for a while before Dan changed tactics and started to desperately tug at Phil\u2019s shirt.</p><p><i><b>\u201cWant it off.\u201d </b></i>He breathed into Phil\u2019s neck.</p><p><b><i>\u201cHold on one minute and lay down I have to use the bathroom.\u201d</i></b></p><p><b><i>\u201cPhiiillll\u201d!</i></b> Dan whined.</p><p><b><i>\u201cSit down and I will be right back.\u201d </i></b>He said using his daddy voice.</p><p>Even drunk, Dan knew not to disobey Phil when he used his daddy voice. So he sat on the bed and nodded his head, \u201c<i><b>Yes daddy.\u201d</b></i></p><p>Giving a smirk of satisfaction, Phil turned around to head to the bathroom.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t even a minute later he returned to the room to find Dan fast asleep on PJ\u2019s bed. He chuckled as he got into bed next to him. Wrapping his arm around his waist and pulling him closer, he buried his head in Dan\u2019s neck. Dan snored slightly which made him chuckle again. Ignoring the urge telling him they should not be sleeping in their friend\u2019s bed, Phil closed his eyes and followed Dan to dreamland.</p><p>********</p><p>Why did he hurt all over? What was going on? What was that beeping? Where was his daddy and his stuffies? All those thoughts ran through his head as he slowly opened his eyes, wincing in pain as he tried to lift his hands.
