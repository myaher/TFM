Back to when he didn\u2019t have to cross half the city to see his best friend, back to when they could be out in the open without Peter constantly on alert, without people harassing him.

This boy is Howard Stark\u2019s\nson! Isn\u2019t that great?\u201d</p><p>The new information about the boy in his kitchen only seemed\nto cause a frown to reappear on his face again. Your father\ncouldn\u2019t care less who he was, all he was was a distraction in his daughter\u2019s\nlife. \u201cA big shot then?\u201d He asked curtly.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a real charmer love, go easy on him\u201d she smiled\npolitely at Tony, only for him to return the smile.</p><p>\u201cTony can I\u2019ve a word?\u201d You asked clearly unhappy with the\nsituation just as much as your father.</p><p>Besides, what on earth has he said to your mother to\nstop her from over-reacting over his presence?</p><p>\u201cWhy now, he\u2019s good where he is. We need to get to know this\nfriend of yours better right?\u201d Your dad stepped in yet again.</p><p>This was a nightmare, your parents were about to question\nevery little detail of Tony\u2019s existence. One thing was for sure, you definitely weren\u2019t going to get to go anywhere after all of this.</p><p>Reaching for your mother\u2019s hand, Tony decided to take hold of\nit in both of his giving it a light pat in a friendly manner. \u201cMrs. Y/L/N, I apologise, I didn\u2019t mean to offend any of you. I just thought that it\u2019d\nbe good manners for me to come in here in person and ask for your permission to\nbring your lovely daughter to the funfair.\u201d</p><p>Your mother seemed to soak up his act like a sponge. Your\ndad on the other hand not so much.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not!\u201d Your dad huffed.</p><p>\u201cHoney, he\u2019s a good boy! Is anyone else going with the two\nof you Tony?\u201d Your mother continued, completely ignoring the look your father\nwas giving her.</p><p>\u201cOh absolutely ma'am\u201d he said sending her another one of his\nhandsome smiles.</p><p><i>What was he playing at?</i></p><p>\u201cOkay then, just make sure to have her back here no later\nthan 10:00\u201d</p><p>Your dad decided to let out another huff in disbelief but to\nno effect.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure she\u2019s in through the door before the clock\neven strikes ten\u201d he winked as he began to get up. Walking over to you he made sure to stop shortly to turn and\nlook at your parents one final time. \u201cThank you, it\u2019s been a pleasure to meet\nyou both\u201d</p><p>With your mouth slightly agape you couldn\u2019t believe that he\nmanaged to convince your parents, well your mother, to allow you to leave with\nhim just like that.</p><p>\u201cWell you\u2019re always welcome to come around\u201d your mother\nsmiled.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not!\u201d Your father interjected, but your\nmother was quick to silence him with a displeased look.</p><p>\u201cGo on Y/N, have fun\u201d she encouraged.</p><p>Giving you one of his proud smirks, Tony nudged you to\nwalk with him towards the door.</p><p>Grabbing your jacket and a handbag you followed him out to\nhis car.</p><p><i>Oh you were definitely in for a lecture when you got back.</i></p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was all that about!?\u201d You shouted as you\nslammed the car door.</p><p>Tony simply started the car and began to move off before\nreplying. \u201cOh c'mon, I did you a favour. Now you can have guys over.\u201d</p><p>Fiddling with the strap from your bag you let out a long sigh. \u201cTony you made it worse, I\u2019m gonna be in so much trouble when I get back.\u201d</p><p>Looking over at you briefly he raised an eyebrow \u201cOh really?\nSeemed like your mother quite liked me\u201d</p><p>Ugh if it weren\u2019t for the fact that he was driving you\nwould\u2019ve punched him in the arm. Without a perfect comeback ready to snap back\nat him you decided to relax in your seat and stare out the window.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe that out of all the guys in the area, my\nparents had to meet you first\u201d you mumbled.</p><p>Snorting at your comment, he decided to ignore your dig at\nhim. Only he couldn\u2019t, within seconds it began to bug him.</p><p>\u201cSo what if I was the first? Unlike any of the other guys\nout there at least I wasn\u2019t afraid to try\u201d he retorted.</p><p>From his tone of voice, it seemed as if your words hurt him\nin a way. With a silence following after his comment, neither of you spoke\nagain for the rest of the journey until you finally reached the funfair.</p><p>Mumbling a quiet \u2018thanks\u2019 you got out of the car and began\nlooking out for your friends.\u00a0</p><p>Tony didn\u2019t get out of the car for a while, he\nseemed to be deeply in thought with his elbow resting against the door. He\nremained still in his seat, rubbing his face with his hand.</p><p>Within minutes you managed to find your friends, laughing\ntogether over something as they headed towards where you stood.</p><p>Seeing them close by in his mirrors, the young adult finally decided\nto get out of the car.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s everyone waiting for?\u201d Amber beamed. \u201cThe funfairs\nthat way\u201d she beckoned towards the entrance.</p><p>Not having to hear much else, Alex was quick to walk over to you and Amber linking your\narms in his own and leading you both towards the entrance. </p><p>You were ready to try and wriggle out of his link but decided to go with the flow\ninstead. As you were pulled along you gave a quick glance back over your\nshoulder to look at Tony, who walked silently beside Josh and Kyle. </p><p><i>You really must\u2019ve struck a nerve with him.</i></p><p>Grabbing your tickets, you stopped shortly after the main\nentrance, allowing everyone to catch up with you. \u00a0Taking in all the attractions you weren\u2019t even\nsure where to start. </p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019d you wanna try first?\u201d Josh asked nudging you out\nof your daydream state. </p><p>However, before you even had the chance to respond, you were\nalready being dragged away yet again, this time by Jay.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNah ah we get her\nfirst. C\u2019mon Y/N\u201d Amber remarked.</p><p>The three of you headed towards the bumper cars first for a\nsimple beginning to an entire evening of fun. Handing in your ticket you went in to\nsit in the first car closest to you. The other two girls got into theirs, competitive\nfaces already surfacing. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going down Y/L/N!\u201d Amber laughed. </p><p>You squinted your eyes at her, only to send her a slight\nsmile afterwards. \u201cTry me!\u201d </p><p>Within seconds you were ready to go. At first you began by\ngathering speed and making sharp turns only to crash with all the force you\u2019ve managed\nto gather into either one of your friends. The atmosphere was quick to fill\nwith random shrieks and fits of laughter as the three of you continued in your\ntask of clashing against the other. At some stages when you were ready to put\nyour tactic in place they\u2019ve managed to throw you completely off-guard sending\nyou out to crash against other bumper cars. </p><p>Laughing away, you continued your mini-fight until the cars\nbegan slowing down indicating that the time was up. Standing up from the car,\nyour leg got slightly caught up as you tried to get out causing you to trip up,\nearning yet another fit of giggles from your friends. </p><p>\u201cThat was planned\u201d you reassured them, giggling along. </p><p>Walking beside the girls, your next stop was a mirror maze.\nThe building in which it was held was rather small and you questioned whether\nit was worth using up your ticket on. Of course, they were quick to convince you\nyet again.</p><p>Heading in, the room seemed a little dark at first but the\npath was lit up well enough for you to see where you were going. The first ten\nminutes were all fun and games as you were sure you were headed the right way\nonly to walk into a mirror end each time.

This boy is Howard Stark\u2019s\nson! Isn\u2019t that great?\u201d</p><p>The new information about the boy in his kitchen only seemed\nto cause a frown to reappear on his face again. Your father\ncouldn\u2019t care less who he was, all he was was a distraction in his daughter\u2019s\nlife. \u201cA big shot then?\u201d He asked curtly.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a real charmer love, go easy on him\u201d she smiled\npolitely at Tony, only for him to return the smile.</p><p>\u201cTony can I\u2019ve a word?\u201d You asked clearly unhappy with the\nsituation just as much as your father.</p><p>Besides, what on earth has he said to your mother to\nstop her from over-reacting over his presence?</p><p>\u201cWhy now, he\u2019s good where he is. We need to get to know this\nfriend of yours better right?\u201d Your dad stepped in yet again.</p><p>This was a nightmare, your parents were about to question\nevery little detail of Tony\u2019s existence. One thing was for sure, you definitely weren\u2019t going to get to go anywhere after all of this.</p><p>Reaching for your mother\u2019s hand, Tony decided to take hold of\nit in both of his giving it a light pat in a friendly manner. \u201cMrs. Y/L/N, I apologise, I didn\u2019t mean to offend any of you. I just thought that it\u2019d\nbe good manners for me to come in here in person and ask for your permission to\nbring your lovely daughter to the funfair.\u201d</p><p>Your mother seemed to soak up his act like a sponge. Your\ndad on the other hand not so much.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not!\u201d Your dad huffed.</p><p>\u201cHoney, he\u2019s a good boy! Is anyone else going with the two\nof you Tony?\u201d Your mother continued, completely ignoring the look your father\nwas giving her.</p><p>\u201cOh absolutely ma'am\u201d he said sending her another one of his\nhandsome smiles.</p><p><i>What was he playing at?</i></p><p>\u201cOkay then, just make sure to have her back here no later\nthan 10:00\u201d</p><p>Your dad decided to let out another huff in disbelief but to\nno effect.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure she\u2019s in through the door before the clock\neven strikes ten\u201d he winked as he began to get up. Walking over to you he made sure to stop shortly to turn and\nlook at your parents one final time. \u201cThank you, it\u2019s been a pleasure to meet\nyou both\u201d</p><p>With your mouth slightly agape you couldn\u2019t believe that he\nmanaged to convince your parents, well your mother, to allow you to leave with\nhim just like that.</p><p>\u201cWell you\u2019re always welcome to come around\u201d your mother\nsmiled.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not!\u201d Your father interjected, but your\nmother was quick to silence him with a displeased look.</p><p>\u201cGo on Y/N, have fun\u201d she encouraged.</p><p>Giving you one of his proud smirks, Tony nudged you to\nwalk with him towards the door.</p><p>Grabbing your jacket and a handbag you followed him out to\nhis car.</p><p><i>Oh you were definitely in for a lecture when you got back.</i></p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was all that about!?\u201d You shouted as you\nslammed the car door.</p><p>Tony simply started the car and began to move off before\nreplying. \u201cOh c'mon, I did you a favour. Now you can have guys over.\u201d</p><p>Fiddling with the strap from your bag you let out a long sigh. \u201cTony you made it worse, I\u2019m gonna be in so much trouble when I get back.\u201d</p><p>Looking over at you briefly he raised an eyebrow \u201cOh really?\nSeemed like your mother quite liked me\u201d</p><p>Ugh if it weren\u2019t for the fact that he was driving you\nwould\u2019ve punched him in the arm. Without a perfect comeback ready to snap back\nat him you decided to relax in your seat and stare out the window.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe that out of all the guys in the area, my\nparents had to meet you first\u201d you mumbled.</p><p>Snorting at your comment, he decided to ignore your dig at\nhim. Only he couldn\u2019t, within seconds it began to bug him.</p><p>\u201cSo what if I was the first? Unlike any of the other guys\nout there at least I wasn\u2019t afraid to try\u201d he retorted.</p><p>From his tone of voice, it seemed as if your words hurt him\nin a way. With a silence following after his comment, neither of you spoke\nagain for the rest of the journey until you finally reached the funfair.</p><p>Mumbling a quiet \u2018thanks\u2019 you got out of the car and began\nlooking out for your friends.\u00a0</p><p>Tony didn\u2019t get out of the car for a while, he\nseemed to be deeply in thought with his elbow resting against the door. He\nremained still in his seat, rubbing his face with his hand.</p><p>Within minutes you managed to find your friends, laughing\ntogether over something as they headed towards where you stood.</p><p>Seeing them close by in his mirrors, the young adult finally decided\nto get out of the car.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s everyone waiting for?\u201d Amber beamed. \u201cThe funfairs\nthat way\u201d she beckoned towards the entrance.</p><p>Not having to hear much else, Alex was quick to walk over to you and Amber linking your\narms in his own and leading you both towards the entrance. </p><p>You were ready to try and wriggle out of his link but decided to go with the flow\ninstead. As you were pulled along you gave a quick glance back over your\nshoulder to look at Tony, who walked silently beside Josh and Kyle. </p><p><i>You really must\u2019ve struck a nerve with him.</i></p><p>Grabbing your tickets, you stopped shortly after the main\nentrance, allowing everyone to catch up with you. \u00a0Taking in all the attractions you weren\u2019t even\nsure where to start. </p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019d you wanna try first?\u201d Josh asked nudging you out\nof your daydream state. </p><p>However, before you even had the chance to respond, you were\nalready being dragged away yet again, this time by Jay.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNah ah we get her\nfirst. C\u2019mon Y/N\u201d Amber remarked.</p><p>The three of you headed towards the bumper cars first for a\nsimple beginning to an entire evening of fun. Handing in your ticket you went in to\nsit in the first car closest to you. The other two girls got into theirs, competitive\nfaces already surfacing. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going down Y/L/N!\u201d Amber laughed. </p><p>You squinted your eyes at her, only to send her a slight\nsmile afterwards. \u201cTry me!\u201d </p><p>Within seconds you were ready to go. At first you began by\ngathering speed and making sharp turns only to crash with all the force you\u2019ve managed\nto gather into either one of your friends. The atmosphere was quick to fill\nwith random shrieks and fits of laughter as the three of you continued in your\ntask of clashing against the other. At some stages when you were ready to put\nyour tactic in place they\u2019ve managed to throw you completely off-guard sending\nyou out to crash against other bumper cars. </p><p>Laughing away, you continued your mini-fight until the cars\nbegan slowing down indicating that the time was up. Standing up from the car,\nyour leg got slightly caught up as you tried to get out causing you to trip up,\nearning yet another fit of giggles from your friends. </p><p>\u201cThat was planned\u201d you reassured them, giggling along. </p><p>Walking beside the girls, your next stop was a mirror maze.\nThe building in which it was held was rather small and you questioned whether\nit was worth using up your ticket on. Of course, they were quick to convince you\nyet again.</p><p>Heading in, the room seemed a little dark at first but the\npath was lit up well enough for you to see where you were going. The first ten\nminutes were all fun and games as you were sure you were headed the right way\nonly to walk into a mirror end each time. After that, things were beginning to\nget a little claustrophobic. </p><p>\u201cEh girls, I got another dead end\u201d you spoke up, unsure of\nwhere you were seeing your friends. </p><p>\u201cTry walking towards me, we can try to figure it out\ntogether\u201d Jay replied. </p><p>Walking around you kept trying to reach your hand out to\nwherever you thought you saw Jordyn only to hit your hand against a mirror each\ntime. Deeply concentrated on finding your friend you almost screamed when you felt\nsomething grab hold of your shoulder.</p><p>\u201cChill, it\u2019s only me\u201d Jay laughed. </p><p>Taking a deep breath in and out you were ready to keep\ngoing. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019re walking around in circles.\u201d You eventually\nuttered with worry evident in your voice.</p><p>\u201cSay, Amber\u2019s been quiet\u201d </p><p>A short moment of silence followed until the voice of your\nthird friend filled the small room. </p><p>\u201cI found the exit!!!\u201d she squeaked excitedly. </p><p>Jay and you were quick to snap into focus, trying to identify where your friend could possibly be standing. \u201cAmber where are you?!\u201d you\ncalled, continuing to feel mirrors as you walked on. </p><p>\u201cOver here!\u201d she shouted back. </p><p>Jay soon grabbed onto your sleeve and led you behind her.\nShe seemed to be onto something.</p><p>\u201cKeep talking Amber! I think we\u2019re close\u201d Jay called out as\nshe kept moving.</p><p>It took you another ten minutes until you finally managed to\nreach Amber, but with the fresh air of the outside hitting your face you couldn\u2019t\nbe more thankful to be finally out of that small building. </p><p>Taking deep breaths of the fresh air, the three of you\ncontinued to make your way around the funfair, only to be met with the guys\nagain.</p><p>\u201cWould you look who it is\u201d Kyle laughed as they reached you.\n</p><p>\u201cLemme guess, obstacle course?\u201d Alex grinned.</p><p>You shook your head in response. \u201cA mirror maze, don\u2019t be\nmisled by the building.\u201d</p><p>The two guys just looked at each other with Alex slightly\nraising his eyebrow in a questioning manor, only for Kyle to shrug in response.</p><p>\u201cWe were just heading to the roller-coaster at the back,\nwanna join?\u201d Josh asked stepping closer.</p><p>Agreeing to join, you all made your way down towards the\nroller-coaster. Standing in front of the structure you had to admit that you\nfelt somewhat nervous at the sight of how tall it actually was up close. </p><p>With the nerves in place, you were the last one out of your\nfriends to take a seat in one of the carts, only to realise that the only\nperson left without anyone sitting beside him was Tony. If it weren\u2019t for the\nfact that you were uncomfortable to sit on your own, you would\u2019ve sat elsewhere since your little disagreement.</p><p>Sitting in awkwardly beside him, you tried to keep a little room\nbetween the two of you. </p><p>With your safety belts fastened, and a safety bar clicked in\nplace the carts began to move slowly. As it moved slowly upwards, Tony could\ntell that you were beginning to feel anxious. Without saying anything to you he\ngrabbed your hand in his to ease your worries. </p><p>You glanced at your hand in his a little surprised. It was\nsuch a simple yet caring gesture. </p><p>Feeling your cheeks heat up you decided to sneak a look at\nhim, only to see him send you a reassuring smile, giving your hand a gentle squeeze\nbefore the carts reached the tipping point. </p><p>It was a strange feeling but you went along with it, only tightening your grip with the fear that followed on the way down the tracks. </p><p>During that entire ride, he didn\u2019t let go of your hand once.\nIf anything, your fear seemed to keep him quite entertained as you finally loosened\nup your muscles allowing your side to comfortably touch against his. </p><p>With the ride coming to an end, everyone was quick to hop\nout except for you. You remained sitting still trying to process everything\nthat just happened. </p><p>Tony just grinned leaning into your side. \u201cYou can let go of\nmy hand now sunshine\u201d </p><p>Upon realising that you were still holding onto it, you were\nquick to release his hand from your grip.

It didn\u2019t\ntake much convincing for some of your friends to tag along with you. Kyle and\nAlex on the other hand told you they\u2019d re-join all of you later after another\nadrenaline filled attraction.</p><p>You were more than happy to allow them to go on their own. </p><p>Walking behind everyone else towards the treats booth, you\nnoticed Tony looking back at you every now and then. It almost seemed as if he\nwere debating whether to go back over to you and talk. </p><p>Josh was quick to beat him to it though. </p><p>\u201cHeyy you\u201d </p><p>Raising an eyebrow you responded with a soft giggle \u201cuh hey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlow down a lil, I gotta talk to you\u201d </p><p>Slowing down your pace, you allowed distance to build up\nbetween you and the rest of the group.

This boy is Howard Stark\u2019s\nson! Isn\u2019t that great?\u201d</p><p>The new information about the boy in his kitchen only seemed\nto cause a frown to reappear on his face again. Your father\ncouldn\u2019t care less who he was, all he was was a distraction in his daughter\u2019s\nlife. \u201cA big shot then?\u201d He asked curtly.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a real charmer love, go easy on him\u201d she smiled\npolitely at Tony, only for him to return the smile.</p><p>\u201cTony can I\u2019ve a word?\u201d You asked clearly unhappy with the\nsituation just as much as your father.</p><p>Besides, what on earth has he said to your mother to\nstop her from over-reacting over his presence?</p><p>\u201cWhy now, he\u2019s good where he is. We need to get to know this\nfriend of yours better right?\u201d Your dad stepped in yet again.</p><p>This was a nightmare, your parents were about to question\nevery little detail of Tony\u2019s existence. One thing was for sure, you definitely weren\u2019t going to get to go anywhere after all of this.</p><p>Reaching for your mother\u2019s hand, Tony decided to take hold of\nit in both of his giving it a light pat in a friendly manner. \u201cMrs. Y/L/N, I apologise, I didn\u2019t mean to offend any of you. I just thought that it\u2019d\nbe good manners for me to come in here in person and ask for your permission to\nbring your lovely daughter to the funfair.\u201d</p><p>Your mother seemed to soak up his act like a sponge. Your\ndad on the other hand not so much.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not!\u201d Your dad huffed.</p><p>\u201cHoney, he\u2019s a good boy! Is anyone else going with the two\nof you Tony?\u201d Your mother continued, completely ignoring the look your father\nwas giving her.</p><p>\u201cOh absolutely ma'am\u201d he said sending her another one of his\nhandsome smiles.</p><p><i>What was he playing at?</i></p><p>\u201cOkay then, just make sure to have her back here no later\nthan 10:00\u201d</p><p>Your dad decided to let out another huff in disbelief but to\nno effect.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure she\u2019s in through the door before the clock\neven strikes ten\u201d he winked as he began to get up. Walking over to you he made sure to stop shortly to turn and\nlook at your parents one final time. \u201cThank you, it\u2019s been a pleasure to meet\nyou both\u201d</p><p>With your mouth slightly agape you couldn\u2019t believe that he\nmanaged to convince your parents, well your mother, to allow you to leave with\nhim just like that.</p><p>\u201cWell you\u2019re always welcome to come around\u201d your mother\nsmiled.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not!\u201d Your father interjected, but your\nmother was quick to silence him with a displeased look.</p><p>\u201cGo on Y/N, have fun\u201d she encouraged.</p><p>Giving you one of his proud smirks, Tony nudged you to\nwalk with him towards the door.</p><p>Grabbing your jacket and a handbag you followed him out to\nhis car.</p><p><i>Oh you were definitely in for a lecture when you got back.</i></p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was all that about!?\u201d You shouted as you\nslammed the car door.</p><p>Tony simply started the car and began to move off before\nreplying. \u201cOh c'mon, I did you a favour. Now you can have guys over.\u201d</p><p>Fiddling with the strap from your bag you let out a long sigh. \u201cTony you made it worse, I\u2019m gonna be in so much trouble when I get back.\u201d</p><p>Looking over at you briefly he raised an eyebrow \u201cOh really?\nSeemed like your mother quite liked me\u201d</p><p>Ugh if it weren\u2019t for the fact that he was driving you\nwould\u2019ve punched him in the arm. Without a perfect comeback ready to snap back\nat him you decided to relax in your seat and stare out the window.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe that out of all the guys in the area, my\nparents had to meet you first\u201d you mumbled.</p><p>Snorting at your comment, he decided to ignore your dig at\nhim. Only he couldn\u2019t, within seconds it began to bug him.</p><p>\u201cSo what if I was the first? Unlike any of the other guys\nout there at least I wasn\u2019t afraid to try\u201d he retorted.</p><p>From his tone of voice, it seemed as if your words hurt him\nin a way. With a silence following after his comment, neither of you spoke\nagain for the rest of the journey until you finally reached the funfair.</p><p>Mumbling a quiet \u2018thanks\u2019 you got out of the car and began\nlooking out for your friends.\u00a0</p><p>Tony didn\u2019t get out of the car for a while, he\nseemed to be deeply in thought with his elbow resting against the door. He\nremained still in his seat, rubbing his face with his hand.</p><p>Within minutes you managed to find your friends, laughing\ntogether over something as they headed towards where you stood.</p><p>Seeing them close by in his mirrors, the young adult finally decided\nto get out of the car.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s everyone waiting for?\u201d Amber beamed. \u201cThe funfairs\nthat way\u201d she beckoned towards the entrance.</p><p>Not having to hear much else, Alex was quick to walk over to you and Amber linking your\narms in his own and leading you both towards the entrance. </p><p>You were ready to try and wriggle out of his link but decided to go with the flow\ninstead. As you were pulled along you gave a quick glance back over your\nshoulder to look at Tony, who walked silently beside Josh and Kyle. </p><p><i>You really must\u2019ve struck a nerve with him.</i></p><p>Grabbing your tickets, you stopped shortly after the main\nentrance, allowing everyone to catch up with you. \u00a0Taking in all the attractions you weren\u2019t even\nsure where to start. </p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019d you wanna try first?\u201d Josh asked nudging you out\nof your daydream state. </p><p>However, before you even had the chance to respond, you were\nalready being dragged away yet again, this time by Jay.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNah ah we get her\nfirst. C\u2019mon Y/N\u201d Amber remarked.</p><p>The three of you headed towards the bumper cars first for a\nsimple beginning to an entire evening of fun. Handing in your ticket you went in to\nsit in the first car closest to you. The other two girls got into theirs, competitive\nfaces already surfacing. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going down Y/L/N!\u201d Amber laughed. </p><p>You squinted your eyes at her, only to send her a slight\nsmile afterwards. \u201cTry me!\u201d </p><p>Within seconds you were ready to go. At first you began by\ngathering speed and making sharp turns only to crash with all the force you\u2019ve managed\nto gather into either one of your friends. The atmosphere was quick to fill\nwith random shrieks and fits of laughter as the three of you continued in your\ntask of clashing against the other. At some stages when you were ready to put\nyour tactic in place they\u2019ve managed to throw you completely off-guard sending\nyou out to crash against other bumper cars. </p><p>Laughing away, you continued your mini-fight until the cars\nbegan slowing down indicating that the time was up. Standing up from the car,\nyour leg got slightly caught up as you tried to get out causing you to trip up,\nearning yet another fit of giggles from your friends. </p><p>\u201cThat was planned\u201d you reassured them, giggling along. </p><p>Walking beside the girls, your next stop was a mirror maze.\nThe building in which it was held was rather small and you questioned whether\nit was worth using up your ticket on. Of course, they were quick to convince you\nyet again.</p><p>Heading in, the room seemed a little dark at first but the\npath was lit up well enough for you to see where you were going. The first ten\nminutes were all fun and games as you were sure you were headed the right way\nonly to walk into a mirror end each time. After that, things were beginning to\nget a little claustrophobic. </p><p>\u201cEh girls, I got another dead end\u201d you spoke up, unsure of\nwhere you were seeing your friends. </p><p>\u201cTry walking towards me, we can try to figure it out\ntogether\u201d Jay replied. </p><p>Walking around you kept trying to reach your hand out to\nwherever you thought you saw Jordyn only to hit your hand against a mirror each\ntime. Deeply concentrated on finding your friend you almost screamed when you felt\nsomething grab hold of your shoulder.</p><p>\u201cChill, it\u2019s only me\u201d Jay laughed. </p><p>Taking a deep breath in and out you were ready to keep\ngoing. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019re walking around in circles.\u201d You eventually\nuttered with worry evident in your voice.</p><p>\u201cSay, Amber\u2019s been quiet\u201d </p><p>A short moment of silence followed until the voice of your\nthird friend filled the small room. </p><p>\u201cI found the exit!!!\u201d she squeaked excitedly. </p><p>Jay and you were quick to snap into focus, trying to identify where your friend could possibly be standing. \u201cAmber where are you?!\u201d you\ncalled, continuing to feel mirrors as you walked on. </p><p>\u201cOver here!\u201d she shouted back. </p><p>Jay soon grabbed onto your sleeve and led you behind her.\nShe seemed to be onto something.</p><p>\u201cKeep talking Amber! I think we\u2019re close\u201d Jay called out as\nshe kept moving.</p><p>It took you another ten minutes until you finally managed to\nreach Amber, but with the fresh air of the outside hitting your face you couldn\u2019t\nbe more thankful to be finally out of that small building. </p><p>Taking deep breaths of the fresh air, the three of you\ncontinued to make your way around the funfair, only to be met with the guys\nagain.</p><p>\u201cWould you look who it is\u201d Kyle laughed as they reached you.\n</p><p>\u201cLemme guess, obstacle course?\u201d Alex grinned.</p><p>You shook your head in response. \u201cA mirror maze, don\u2019t be\nmisled by the building.\u201d</p><p>The two guys just looked at each other with Alex slightly\nraising his eyebrow in a questioning manor, only for Kyle to shrug in response.</p><p>\u201cWe were just heading to the roller-coaster at the back,\nwanna join?\u201d Josh asked stepping closer.</p><p>Agreeing to join, you all made your way down towards the\nroller-coaster. Standing in front of the structure you had to admit that you\nfelt somewhat nervous at the sight of how tall it actually was up close. </p><p>With the nerves in place, you were the last one out of your\nfriends to take a seat in one of the carts, only to realise that the only\nperson left without anyone sitting beside him was Tony. If it weren\u2019t for the\nfact that you were uncomfortable to sit on your own, you would\u2019ve sat elsewhere since your little disagreement.</p><p>Sitting in awkwardly beside him, you tried to keep a little room\nbetween the two of you. </p><p>With your safety belts fastened, and a safety bar clicked in\nplace the carts began to move slowly. As it moved slowly upwards, Tony could\ntell that you were beginning to feel anxious. Without saying anything to you he\ngrabbed your hand in his to ease your worries. </p><p>You glanced at your hand in his a little surprised. It was\nsuch a simple yet caring gesture. </p><p>Feeling your cheeks heat up you decided to sneak a look at\nhim, only to see him send you a reassuring smile, giving your hand a gentle squeeze\nbefore the carts reached the tipping point. </p><p>It was a strange feeling but you went along with it, only tightening your grip with the fear that followed on the way down the tracks. </p><p>During that entire ride, he didn\u2019t let go of your hand once.\nIf anything, your fear seemed to keep him quite entertained as you finally loosened\nup your muscles allowing your side to comfortably touch against his. </p><p>With the ride coming to an end, everyone was quick to hop\nout except for you. You remained sitting still trying to process everything\nthat just happened. </p><p>Tony just grinned leaning into your side. \u201cYou can let go of\nmy hand now sunshine\u201d </p><p>Upon realising that you were still holding onto it, you were\nquick to release his hand from your grip. Feeling yet another blush coming\nalong, you hurried after your friends. </p><p>Ignoring Amber\u2019s teasing look, you decided to stand beside\nJosh instead.</p><p>\u201cMan, you should\u2019ve seen Jordy\u201d Alex laughed, nudging the\ndark-haired girl earning an eye-roll in return. </p><p>A little embarrassed by your own fear earlier on you decided\nto quickly suggest toning it down a little with some ice-cream or so. It didn\u2019t\ntake much convincing for some of your friends to tag along with you. Kyle and\nAlex on the other hand told you they\u2019d re-join all of you later after another\nadrenaline filled attraction.</p><p>You were more than happy to allow them to go on their own. </p><p>Walking behind everyone else towards the treats booth, you\nnoticed Tony looking back at you every now and then. It almost seemed as if he\nwere debating whether to go back over to you and talk. </p><p>Josh was quick to beat him to it though. </p><p>\u201cHeyy you\u201d </p><p>Raising an eyebrow you responded with a soft giggle \u201cuh hey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlow down a lil, I gotta talk to you\u201d </p><p>Slowing down your pace, you allowed distance to build up\nbetween you and the rest of the group. Hundreds of questions began to fill your\nmind in the process. What did he want to talk to you about? Was he going to make a move on you? Was it actually Josh\nwho had the crush on you all along? </p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>Looking over at the group in the distance he decided to stop\nin his tracks, only to turn his attention back to you. Taking a step closer to you he decided\nto lean in to whisper just slightly above you ear.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u2026\u201d you asked remaining still, trying to keep your\nbreath even at how close he was.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve always been really close Y/N ever since I met you,\nand we certainly make a great team..\u201d he continued. \u201c\u2026 and I know that you know about\nthe bet\u2026\u201d </p><p><i>What a snake!</i></p><p>Waking from your daydream you were quick to push him back slightly.

Need I say more?</b></p><p><b><b>Warnings: My inexperienced writing, bad language, goes from 0-100 real quick</b></b></p><p><b><b>\n\n<b>Word count: 2639 words</b><br /></b></b></p><hr /><p>Making your way down the rest of the stairs over to the door\nwhere your parents and Tony now stood, you thought you were going to experience a\nproper panic attack. &ldquo;I-I- He&rsquo;s-I mean-&rdquo; you stuttered nearing to everyone.</p><p>Luckily enough your mother decided to take hold of the\nsituation and invited him into the kitchen for some tea, leaving you and your\nstrict father behind.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N you know the rules, no boys until-&rdquo; your father began\nscolding until you interrupted him.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah yeah, until I&rsquo;m done with my studies and have started\nmy career but daaad, he&rsquo;s just a friend from college, he helps me with work&rdquo;\nyou groaned.</p><p>Hearing your mother&rsquo;s laughter the two of you turned to look\nin the kitchen&rsquo;s direction.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk about this later young lady&rdquo; your father said in\na firm tone before walking over to the kitchen to see what all the laughter was\nabout.</p><p>Clearly embarrassed by the situation you decided to follow\nsuit only to send daggers in Tony&rsquo;s direction when he looked up at you away\nfrom your mother.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on here?&rdquo; Your father asked sans interest while making\nhimself a cup of coffee.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh honey, you&rsquo;ll never guess. This boy is Howard Stark&rsquo;s\nson! Isn&rsquo;t that great?&rdquo;</p><p>The new information about the boy in his kitchen only seemed\nto cause a frown to reappear on his face again. Your father\ncouldn&rsquo;t care less who he was, all he was was a distraction in his daughter&rsquo;s\nlife. &ldquo;A big shot then?&rdquo; He asked curtly.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a real charmer love, go easy on him&rdquo; she smiled\npolitely at Tony, only for him to return the smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Tony can I&rsquo;ve a word?&rdquo; You asked clearly unhappy with the\nsituation just as much as your father.</p><p>Besides, what on earth has he said to your mother to\nstop her from over-reacting over his presence?</p><p>&ldquo;Why now, he&rsquo;s good where he is. We need to get to know this\nfriend of yours better right?&rdquo; Your dad stepped in yet again.</p><p>This was a nightmare, your parents were about to question\nevery little detail of Tony&rsquo;s existence. One thing was for sure, you definitely weren&rsquo;t going to get to go anywhere after all of this.</p><p>Reaching for your mother&rsquo;s hand, Tony decided to take hold of\nit in both of his giving it a light pat in a friendly manner. &ldquo;Mrs. Y/L/N, I apologise, I didn&rsquo;t mean to offend any of you. I just thought that it&rsquo;d\nbe good manners for me to come in here in person and ask for your permission to\nbring your lovely daughter to the funfair.&rdquo;</p><p>Your mother seemed to soak up his act like a sponge. Your\ndad on the other hand not so much.</p><p>&ldquo;Absolutely not!&rdquo; Your dad huffed.</p><p>&ldquo;Honey, he&rsquo;s a good boy! Is anyone else going with the two\nof you Tony?&rdquo; Your mother continued, completely ignoring the look your father\nwas giving her.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh absolutely ma'am&rdquo; he said sending her another one of his\nhandsome smiles.</p><p><i>What was he playing at?</i></p><p>&ldquo;Okay then, just make sure to have her back here no later\nthan 10:00&rdquo;</p><p>Your dad decided to let out another huff in disbelief but to\nno effect.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make sure she&rsquo;s in through the door before the clock\neven strikes ten&rdquo; he winked as he began to get up. Walking over to you he made sure to stop shortly to turn and\nlook at your parents one final time. &ldquo;Thank you, it&rsquo;s been a pleasure to meet\nyou both&rdquo;</p><p>With your mouth slightly agape you couldn&rsquo;t believe that he\nmanaged to convince your parents, well your mother, to allow you to leave with\nhim just like that.</p><p>&ldquo;Well you&rsquo;re always welcome to come around&rdquo; your mother\nsmiled.</p><p>&ldquo;Absolutely not!&rdquo; Your father interjected, but your\nmother was quick to silence him with a displeased look.</p><p>&ldquo;Go on Y/N, have fun&rdquo; she encouraged.</p><p>Giving you one of his proud smirks, Tony nudged you to\nwalk with him towards the door.</p><p>Grabbing your jacket and a handbag you followed him out to\nhis car.</p><p><i>Oh you were definitely in for a lecture when you got back.</i></p><p>&ldquo;What the hell was all that about!?&rdquo; You shouted as you\nslammed the car door.</p><p>Tony simply started the car and began to move off before\nreplying. &ldquo;Oh c'mon, I did you a favour. Now you can have guys over.&rdquo;</p><p>Fiddling with the strap from your bag you let out a long sigh. &ldquo;Tony you made it worse, I&rsquo;m gonna be in so much trouble when I get back.&rdquo;</p><p>Looking over at you briefly he raised an eyebrow &ldquo;Oh really?\nSeemed like your mother quite liked me&rdquo;</p><p>Ugh if it weren&rsquo;t for the fact that he was driving you\nwould&rsquo;ve punched him in the arm. Without a perfect comeback ready to snap back\nat him you decided to relax in your seat and stare out the window.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe that out of all the guys in the area, my\nparents had to meet you first&rdquo; you mumbled.</p><p>Snorting at your comment, he decided to ignore your dig at\nhim. Only he couldn&rsquo;t, within seconds it began to bug him.</p><p>&ldquo;So what if I was the first? Unlike any of the other guys\nout there at least I wasn&rsquo;t afraid to try&rdquo; he retorted.</p><p>From his tone of voice, it seemed as if your words hurt him\nin a way. With a silence following after his comment, neither of you spoke\nagain for the rest of the journey until you finally reached the funfair.</p><p>Mumbling a quiet &lsquo;thanks&rsquo; you got out of the car and began\nlooking out for your friends.&nbsp;</p><p>Tony didn&rsquo;t get out of the car for a while, he\nseemed to be deeply in thought with his elbow resting against the door. He\nremained still in his seat, rubbing his face with his hand.</p><p>Within minutes you managed to find your friends, laughing\ntogether over something as they headed towards where you stood.</p><p>Seeing them close by in his mirrors, the young adult finally decided\nto get out of the car.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s everyone waiting for?&rdquo; Amber beamed. &ldquo;The funfairs\nthat way&rdquo; she beckoned towards the entrance.</p><p>Not having to hear much else, Alex was quick to walk over to you and Amber linking your\narms in his own and leading you both towards the entrance. </p><p>You were ready to try and wriggle out of his link but decided to go with the flow\ninstead. As you were pulled along you gave a quick glance back over your\nshoulder to look at Tony, who walked silently beside Josh and Kyle. </p><p><i>You really must&rsquo;ve struck a nerve with him.</i></p><p>Grabbing your tickets, you stopped shortly after the main\nentrance, allowing everyone to catch up with you. &nbsp;Taking in all the attractions you weren&rsquo;t even\nsure where to start. </p><p>&ldquo;So what&rsquo;d you wanna try first?&rdquo; Josh asked nudging you out\nof your daydream state. </p><p>However, before you even had the chance to respond, you were\nalready being dragged away yet again, this time by Jay.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Nah ah we get her\nfirst. C&rsquo;mon Y/N&rdquo; Amber remarked.</p><p>The three of you headed towards the bumper cars first for a\nsimple beginning to an entire evening of fun. Handing in your ticket you went in to\nsit in the first car closest to you. The other two girls got into theirs, competitive\nfaces already surfacing. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going down Y/L/N!&rdquo; Amber laughed. </p><p>You squinted your eyes at her, only to send her a slight\nsmile afterwards. &ldquo;Try me!&rdquo; </p><p>Within seconds you were ready to go. At first you began by\ngathering speed and making sharp turns only to crash with all the force you&rsquo;ve managed\nto gather into either one of your friends. The atmosphere was quick to fill\nwith random shrieks and fits of laughter as the three of you continued in your\ntask of clashing against the other. At some stages when you were ready to put\nyour tactic in place they&rsquo;ve managed to throw you completely off-guard sending\nyou out to crash against other bumper cars. </p><p>Laughing away, you continued your mini-fight until the cars\nbegan slowing down indicating that the time was up. Standing up from the car,\nyour leg got slightly caught up as you tried to get out causing you to trip up,\nearning yet another fit of giggles from your friends. </p><p>&ldquo;That was planned&rdquo; you reassured them, giggling along. </p><p>Walking beside the girls, your next stop was a mirror maze.\nThe building in which it was held was rather small and you questioned whether\nit was worth using up your ticket on. Of course, they were quick to convince you\nyet again.</p><p>Heading in, the room seemed a little dark at first but the\npath was lit up well enough for you to see where you were going. The first ten\nminutes were all fun and games as you were sure you were headed the right way\nonly to walk into a mirror end each time. After that, things were beginning to\nget a little claustrophobic. </p><p>&ldquo;Eh girls, I got another dead end&rdquo; you spoke up, unsure of\nwhere you were seeing your friends. </p><p>&ldquo;Try walking towards me, we can try to figure it out\ntogether&rdquo; Jay replied. </p><p>Walking around you kept trying to reach your hand out to\nwherever you thought you saw Jordyn only to hit your hand against a mirror each\ntime. Deeply concentrated on finding your friend you almost screamed when you felt\nsomething grab hold of your shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;Chill, it&rsquo;s only me&rdquo; Jay laughed. </p><p>Taking a deep breath in and out you were ready to keep\ngoing. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty sure we&rsquo;re walking around in circles.&rdquo; You eventually\nuttered with worry evident in your voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Say, Amber&rsquo;s been quiet&rdquo; </p><p>A short moment of silence followed until the voice of your\nthird friend filled the small room. </p><p>&ldquo;I found the exit!!!&rdquo; she squeaked excitedly. </p><p>Jay and you were quick to snap into focus, trying to identify where your friend could possibly be standing. &ldquo;Amber where are you?!&rdquo; you\ncalled, continuing to feel mirrors as you walked on. </p><p>&ldquo;Over here!&rdquo; she shouted back. </p><p>Jay soon grabbed onto your sleeve and led you behind her.\nShe seemed to be onto something.</p><p>&ldquo;Keep talking Amber! I think we&rsquo;re close&rdquo; Jay called out as\nshe kept moving.</p><p>It took you another ten minutes until you finally managed to\nreach Amber, but with the fresh air of the outside hitting your face you couldn&rsquo;t\nbe more thankful to be finally out of that small building. </p><p>Taking deep breaths of the fresh air, the three of you\ncontinued to make your way around the funfair, only to be met with the guys\nagain.</p><p>&ldquo;Would you look who it is&rdquo; Kyle laughed as they reached you.\n</p><p>&ldquo;Lemme guess, obstacle course?&rdquo; Alex grinned.</p><p>You shook your head in response. &ldquo;A mirror maze, don&rsquo;t be\nmisled by the building.&rdquo;</p><p>The two guys just looked at each other with Alex slightly\nraising his eyebrow in a questioning manor, only for Kyle to shrug in response.</p><p>&ldquo;We were just heading to the roller-coaster at the back,\nwanna join?&rdquo; Josh asked stepping closer.</p><p>Agreeing to join, you all made your way down towards the\nroller-coaster. Standing in front of the structure you had to admit that you\nfelt somewhat nervous at the sight of how tall it actually was up close. </p><p>With the nerves in place, you were the last one out of your\nfriends to take a seat in one of the carts, only to realise that the only\nperson left without anyone sitting beside him was Tony. If it weren&rsquo;t for the\nfact that you were uncomfortable to sit on your own, you would&rsquo;ve sat elsewhere since your little disagreement.</p><p>Sitting in awkwardly beside him, you tried to keep a little room\nbetween the two of you. </p><p>With your safety belts fastened, and a safety bar clicked in\nplace the carts began to move slowly. As it moved slowly upwards, Tony could\ntell that you were beginning to feel anxious. Without saying anything to you he\ngrabbed your hand in his to ease your worries. </p><p>You glanced at your hand in his a little surprised. It was\nsuch a simple yet caring gesture. </p><p>Feeling your cheeks heat up you decided to sneak a look at\nhim, only to see him send you a reassuring smile, giving your hand a gentle squeeze\nbefore the carts reached the tipping point. </p><p>It was a strange feeling but you went along with it, only tightening your grip with the fear that followed on the way down the tracks. </p><p>During that entire ride, he didn&rsquo;t let go of your hand once.\nIf anything, your fear seemed to keep him quite entertained as you finally loosened\nup your muscles allowing your side to comfortably touch against his. </p><p>With the ride coming to an end, everyone was quick to hop\nout except for you. You remained sitting still trying to process everything\nthat just happened. </p><p>Tony just grinned leaning into your side. &ldquo;You can let go of\nmy hand now sunshine&rdquo; </p><p>Upon realising that you were still holding onto it, you were\nquick to release his hand from your grip. Feeling yet another blush coming\nalong, you hurried after your friends. </p><p>Ignoring Amber&rsquo;s teasing look, you decided to stand beside\nJosh instead.</p><p>&ldquo;Man, you should&rsquo;ve seen Jordy&rdquo; Alex laughed, nudging the\ndark-haired girl earning an eye-roll in return. </p><p>A little embarrassed by your own fear earlier on you decided\nto quickly suggest toning it down a little with some ice-cream or so. It didn&rsquo;t\ntake much convincing for some of your friends to tag along with you. Kyle and\nAlex on the other hand told you they&rsquo;d re-join all of you later after another\nadrenaline filled attraction.</p><p>You were more than happy to allow them to go on their own. </p><p>Walking behind everyone else towards the treats booth, you\nnoticed Tony looking back at you every now and then. It almost seemed as if he\nwere debating whether to go back over to you and talk. </p><p>Josh was quick to beat him to it though. </p><p>&ldquo;Heyy you&rdquo; </p><p>Raising an eyebrow you responded with a soft giggle &ldquo;uh hey?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Slow down a lil, I gotta talk to you&rdquo; </p><p>Slowing down your pace, you allowed distance to build up\nbetween you and the rest of the group. Hundreds of questions began to fill your\nmind in the process. What did he want to talk to you about? Was he going to make a move on you? Was it actually Josh\nwho had the crush on you all along? </p><p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p><p>Looking over at the group in the distance he decided to stop\nin his tracks, only to turn his attention back to you. Taking a step closer to you he decided\nto lean in to whisper just slightly above you ear.</p><p>&ldquo;I was thinking&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&hellip;&rdquo; you asked remaining still, trying to keep your\nbreath even at how close he was.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve always been really close Y/N ever since I met you,\nand we certainly make a great team..&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;&hellip; and I know that you know about\nthe bet&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p><i>What a snake!</i></p><p>Waking from your daydream you were quick to push him back slightly. Looking up at him, you proceeded to squint your eyes suspiciously. &ldquo;Who told you?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, easy. And you did, just now&rdquo; he smirked. </p><p>&ldquo;Ugh, you&rsquo;re a jerk y&rsquo;know that?&rdquo; you groaned. &ldquo;What do you\nwant?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh nothing, just help me win the bet&rdquo;</p><p>Taken aback by his request, you decided to take a short step away\nfrom him. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you for real? There&rsquo;s no way-&ldquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Consider this, I can always tell them that you know. Besides,\nI also know who has a crush on you..&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t dare&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Or would I?&rdquo; he smiled, winking at you.</p><hr /><p><b>A/N: </b><i>OooOOOoooh dramaaaa.
