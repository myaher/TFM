I imagine with the hiatus that some of the things they already have in stock aren\u2019t selling as well as they would like, so they are having a sale to try to move them. I think it\u2019s a reach to assume anything about Dan\u2019s future on YouTube or that he is making new merch from what was said and that people are just so desperate for information that they are looking for clues anywhere. I\u2019ll believe Dan is making new content or new merch when he gives me specifics. Until then, my expectations are nonexistent. I will say that I would personally be very disappointed if he came out with new merch without releasing at least two videos first or officially announcing that he is quitting YouTube to be a full-time merch designer. </p>",

Dog barks. Something that is very likely his neighbor moaning in pleasure, followed by a loud banging noise that makes Phil cover his ears with his pillow, groaning in frustration.</p><p>At this time, usually, Phil\u2019s ears are filled with different sounds. Nice sounds. Sometimes murmured in the dark before a good night kiss, covering him like a thick warm blanket. Sometimes loud and full of life and teasing and banter on nights when energy runs high and responsibilities run low and he momentarily allows himself to forget his promise of being a proper adult who goes to sleep at a proper time.</p><p>Either way, these sounds are always comforting, familiar- and very painfully absent at the moment.</p><p>The apartment wasn\u2019t this quiet before, he reminds himself, grimacing into his pillow. Only a few hours ago it was filled with loud, angry words Phil usually knows how to hold back, directed like poisoned arrows towards the person Phil never wants to actually hurt.</p><p>They both said some things, he and Dan. Tension had run high for a couple of weeks now, and Phil knows that his tendency to keep to himself and hold back his hurt, quietly trying to work through things until he can\u2019t possibly keep quiet anymore, is pretty high on the list of reasons why tonight has played out the way it did.</p><p>He isn\u2019t blind to Dan\u2019s struggles. Isn\u2019t blind to the way Dan is working his hardest to overcome things Phil can probably never really understand to their core, trying to make up the missing puzzle pieces with long hours spent on mental health blogs and calls to his mum, who somehow always understands a little better than him.</p><p>And it hurts, sometimes, when it feels like maybe Dan is blind to the way Phil struggles as well, right next to him.</p><p>And maybe he\u2019s been spoiled by Dan. Been spoiled by the way Dan can usually pick up on every little facial expression, every little eyebrow crease, every little sign Phil is trying to hide to avoid adding unnecessary stress, to avoid opening up topics he is sure he can avoid by shoving them deep in a drawer in the back of his mind, locking it until they collect dust and lose their importance. Maybe that\u2019s what makes it hurt so much more, when Dan just lets it happen.</p><p>Maybe, sometimes, he wants Dan to notice everything Phil is trying to hide. Maybe he wants Dan to confront him before it all piles up inside his head and spills out of his eyes and ears and mouth, lips forming angry words he never wants to say, eyes leaking angry tears he never intends to cry.</p><p>He knows that mostly, usually, they are good at stopping before they go too far. Good at taking a time out when things get too heated, too close to spiteful. Phil is good at catching himself, good at remembering that he\u2019s mad now but he\u2019ll regret saying what he feels like spitting out later. He\u2019s good at not crossing the line, mostly, usually. Which makes it that much worse when sometimes, he\u2019s not.</p><p>The image of the hurt in Dan\u2019s eyes is still very much burnt into his eyelids, not letting him close his eyes and attempt sleep. Phil\u2019s weak \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean it,\u201d said while watching Dan put on his shoes and coat by the front door, not lifting his eyes to meet Phil\u2019s desperate ones. His retort of \u201cyes, Phil, you did,\u201d before walking out the door, closing it behind him in an alarmingly quiet way, has been playing on repeat in Phil\u2019s mind for the last few hours, making him curl smaller under the covers, shoving his head deeper under his pillow.</p><p>He\u2019s not really worried about where Dan is. Dan answered his anxious text of \u201cWhere are you? Please come home,\u201d about an hour ago, telling Phil he\u2019s just walking around not far from their building. Telling him he just needs to clear his head. Telling him to go to sleep. Dan learned, long ago, to not leave Phil hanging with things like that. So Phil is not really worried, not about that at least. He knows, that right now, all he can do is wait.</p><p>***************</p><p>It\u2019s not before 3 AM that Phil finally hears the front door opening and closing quietly, footsteps going to the kitchen, and then the bathroom. Phil doesn\u2019t know if Dan will come sleep next to him. Doesn\u2019t know if Dan\u2019s expression still shows the hurt it showed before, doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019s covering it with a mask of indifference.</p><p>A part of him wants to get out of bed to check. To confront. To say that he\u2019s sorry again (but also, he thinks bitterly, to remind Dan that they\u2019re both guilty of stepping out of line. That he\u2019s not the only one who said things that shouldn\u2019t be said. That he is not the only one to blame).</p><p>But another part, small but paralyzing, is telling him to stay put. This part is making his legs shake and his breath hitch and his anxiety crawl under his skin because he doesn\u2019t know, and right now he\u2019s afraid to find out.</p><p>His heart is beating loudly in his chest until he finally hears the door to the bedroom creak open, feels a big, warm body settle next to him, his back turned to his.</p><p>He\u2019s a little afraid to breathe, afraid to move or turn around because he knows Dan knows he\u2019s awake, but he\u2019s still keeping quiet.</p><p>It takes him a minute to compose himself enough to squeak out a small unsure \u201cDan?\u201d and it takes another 20 seconds for Dan to sigh out a quiet \u201cyeah.\u201d</p><p>They both turn around then, Phil facing Dan and Dan facing the ceiling, not quite engaging in Phil\u2019s attempt at eye contact, but definitely showing willingness to talk.</p><p>Phil doesn\u2019t know what to say. Doesn\u2019t know how to convey his relief and guilt and hurt in words, doesn\u2019t know if he should. He lets his hand wander, instead, hesitantly, testing the water, reaching it towards Dan\u2019s and wrapping his big long fingers in his own, squeezing.</p><p>\u201cYour hand is cold,\u201d Phil says, and when Dan hums in response he\u2019s pulling it toward his face, pressing his hand to his warm lips and cheek.</p><p>Dan\u2019s gaze turns to him then, just in time to see his eyes overflow with emotion, spilling new hot tears without his consent, making his cheeks and nose and Dan\u2019s hand wet with them. Dan looks at him for a moment, and Phil is having trouble reading his face without his glasses and with wetness clouding his eyes, but he feels it when Dan\u2019s thumb is wiggling out of his grasp, rubbing the pink skin under his eye relentlessly, making Phil squint.</p><p>\u201cStop that,\u201d Dan says. His voice is commanding but also soft and it only makes Phil cry harder.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it,\u201d he says. It\u2019s true, he can\u2019t. He isn\u2019t lying when he says he is starting to cry more frequently with age, starting to get more emotionally affected by things. (\u201cIt\u2019s probably all the hormonal changes,\u201d Dan always says with a smirk, \u201cif you don\u2019t hurry, all your mpreg fantasies will be dead.\u201d It always earns him a pillow to the face and a pouty boyfriend, but it\u2019s nothing a kiss on the forehead and a squeeze around the shoulders can\u2019t usually fix.)</p><p>Dan doesn\u2019t say anything more, but he\u2019s turning his entire body towards Phil now, gripping his face more firmly under Phil\u2019s warm hand.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it,\u201d Phil says, echoing his words from hours ago. \u201cI was mad, but I didn\u2019t, not really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhil-\u201d Dan starts, but Phil stops him by shaking his head against his hold, almost violently.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t, I didn\u2019t,\u201d he repeats, pulling Dan\u2019s hand from his cheek and pressing it to his lips, voice choked against Dan\u2019s fingers.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Dan says, and Phil knows he isn\u2019t convinced, but it\u2019s okay, it\u2019s better. it\u2019s good enough for now.</p><p>\u201cDid you?\u201d he asks, because suddenly it all aches and burns and he\u2019s not the only one who said things, not the only one who needs to apologize and reassure-</p><p>\u201cMaybe I did. A little,\u201d Dan says, and it makes Phil\u2019s hold on Dan\u2019s hand loosen right away, makes him let out a shuddered breath, makes him close his eyes so he doesn\u2019t have to try and see the expression on Dan\u2019s face.</p><p>There\u2019s two hands on his cheeks, almost immediately, holding tight and pulling him closer until their foreheads touch and Dan\u2019s breath is against Phil\u2019s nose. \u201cPhil,\u201d he says, and he can almost feel the word forming against his skin. \u201cPhil,\u201d he says again, waiting for him to open his eyes.</p><p>Phil does, because even though his stomach hurts and his chest is tight he doesn\u2019t want to keep Dan waiting. Not for too long, not at all.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Dan says, and this time his lips do touch the skin on the side of Phil\u2019s nose, making his eyes feel heavy again with the weight of salty water threatening to overflow.</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d Phil asks, and he brings his hands up too, to cover Dan\u2019s, to keep them in place.</p><p>Dan kisses him again then, this time on the lips. It\u2019s short and salty and dry but Phil understands.</p><p>Dan doesn\u2019t answer him, even if the answer is already there, lingering between them. \u201cI love you,\u201d Dan says instead, when he pulls away. \u201cI love you I love you,\u201d he says again and again, until Phil lets go of his hands, until Phil is pushing himself closer, closer, impossibly close, and wraps his arms around Dan\u2019s body, chest and legs and cheeks pressing together.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Phil says. \u201cSo much,\u201d he adds, because it\u2019s true and it makes his heart ache a little less when he lets it out.</p><p>Phil understands, he knows, without a doubt. There\u2019s still much to talk about tomorrow, probably more feelings to be hurt and more wounds to bandage. Phil understands, he knows, it might not be entirely okay right now, but it will be. They\u2019ll make sure of it.</p>",

Dog barks. Something that is very likely his neighbor moaning in pleasure, followed by a loud banging noise that makes Phil cover his ears with his pillow, groaning in frustration.</p><p>At this time, usually, Phil\u2019s ears are filled with different sounds. Nice sounds. Sometimes murmured in the dark before a good night kiss, covering him like a thick warm blanket. Sometimes loud and full of life and teasing and banter on nights when energy runs high and responsibilities run low and he momentarily allows himself to forget his promise of being a proper adult who goes to sleep at a proper time.</p><p>Either way, these sounds are always comforting, familiar- and very painfully absent at the moment.</p><p>The apartment wasn\u2019t this quiet before, he reminds himself, grimacing into his pillow. Only a few hours ago it was filled with loud, angry words Phil usually knows how to hold back, directed like poisoned arrows towards the person Phil never wants to actually hurt.</p><p>They both said some things, he and Dan. Tension had run high for a couple of weeks now, and Phil knows that his tendency to keep to himself and hold back his hurt, quietly trying to work through things until he can\u2019t possibly keep quiet anymore, is pretty high on the list of reasons why tonight has played out the way it did.</p><p>He isn\u2019t blind to Dan\u2019s struggles. Isn\u2019t blind to the way Dan is working his hardest to overcome things Phil can probably never really understand to their core, trying to make up the missing puzzle pieces with long hours spent on mental health blogs and calls to his mum, who somehow always understands a little better than him.</p><p>And it hurts, sometimes, when it feels like maybe Dan is blind to the way Phil struggles as well, right next to him.</p><p>And maybe he\u2019s been spoiled by Dan. Been spoiled by the way Dan can usually pick up on every little facial expression, every little eyebrow crease, every little sign Phil is trying to hide to avoid adding unnecessary stress, to avoid opening up topics he is sure he can avoid by shoving them deep in a drawer in the back of his mind, locking it until they collect dust and lose their importance. Maybe that\u2019s what makes it hurt so much more, when Dan just lets it happen.</p><p>Maybe, sometimes, he wants Dan to notice everything Phil is trying to hide. Maybe he wants Dan to confront him before it all piles up inside his head and spills out of his eyes and ears and mouth, lips forming angry words he never wants to say, eyes leaking angry tears he never intends to cry.</p><p>He knows that mostly, usually, they are good at stopping before they go too far. Good at taking a time out when things get too heated, too close to spiteful. Phil is good at catching himself, good at remembering that he\u2019s mad now but he\u2019ll regret saying what he feels like spitting out later. He\u2019s good at not crossing the line, mostly, usually. Which makes it that much worse when sometimes, he\u2019s not.</p><p>The image of the hurt in Dan\u2019s eyes is still very much burnt into his eyelids, not letting him close his eyes and attempt sleep. Phil\u2019s weak \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean it,\u201d said while watching Dan put on his shoes and coat by the front door, not lifting his eyes to meet Phil\u2019s desperate ones. His retort of \u201cyes, Phil, you did,\u201d before walking out the door, closing it behind him in an alarmingly quiet way, has been playing on repeat in Phil\u2019s mind for the last few hours, making him curl smaller under the covers, shoving his head deeper under his pillow.</p><p>He\u2019s not really worried about where Dan is. Dan answered his anxious text of \u201cWhere are you? Please come home,\u201d about an hour ago, telling Phil he\u2019s just walking around not far from their building. Telling him he just needs to clear his head. Telling him to go to sleep. Dan learned, long ago, to not leave Phil hanging with things like that. So Phil is not really worried, not about that at least. He knows, that right now, all he can do is wait.</p><p>***************</p><p>It\u2019s not before 3 AM that Phil finally hears the front door opening and closing quietly, footsteps going to the kitchen, and then the bathroom. Phil doesn\u2019t know if Dan will come sleep next to him. Doesn\u2019t know if Dan\u2019s expression still shows the hurt it showed before, doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019s covering it with a mask of indifference.</p><p>A part of him wants to get out of bed to check. To confront. To say that he\u2019s sorry again (but also, he thinks bitterly, to remind Dan that they\u2019re both guilty of stepping out of line. That he\u2019s not the only one who said things that shouldn\u2019t be said. That he is not the only one to blame).</p><p>But another part, small but paralyzing, is telling him to stay put. This part is making his legs shake and his breath hitch and his anxiety crawl under his skin because he doesn\u2019t know, and right now he\u2019s afraid to find out.</p><p>His heart is beating loudly in his chest until he finally hears the door to the bedroom creak open, feels a big, warm body settle next to him, his back turned to his.</p><p>He\u2019s a little afraid to breathe, afraid to move or turn around because he knows Dan knows he\u2019s awake, but he\u2019s still keeping quiet.</p><p>It takes him a minute to compose himself enough to squeak out a small unsure \u201cDan?\u201d and it takes another 20 seconds for Dan to sigh out a quiet \u201cyeah.\u201d</p><p>They both turn around then, Phil facing Dan and Dan facing the ceiling, not quite engaging in Phil\u2019s attempt at eye contact, but definitely showing willingness to talk.</p><p>Phil doesn\u2019t know what to say. Doesn\u2019t know how to convey his relief and guilt and hurt in words, doesn\u2019t know if he should. He lets his hand wander, instead, hesitantly, testing the water, reaching it towards Dan\u2019s and wrapping his big long fingers in his own, squeezing.</p><p>\u201cYour hand is cold,\u201d Phil says, and when Dan hums in response he\u2019s pulling it toward his face, pressing his hand to his warm lips and cheek.</p><p>Dan\u2019s gaze turns to him then, just in time to see his eyes overflow with emotion, spilling new hot tears without his consent, making his cheeks and nose and Dan\u2019s hand wet with them. Dan looks at him for a moment, and Phil is having trouble reading his face without his glasses and with wetness clouding his eyes, but he feels it when Dan\u2019s thumb is wiggling out of his grasp, rubbing the pink skin under his eye relentlessly, making Phil squint.</p><p>\u201cStop that,\u201d Dan says. His voice is commanding but also soft and it only makes Phil cry harder.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it,\u201d he says. It\u2019s true, he can\u2019t. He isn\u2019t lying when he says he is starting to cry more frequently with age, starting to get more emotionally affected by things. (\u201cIt\u2019s probably all the hormonal changes,\u201d Dan always says with a smirk, \u201cif you don\u2019t hurry, all your mpreg fantasies will be dead.\u201d It always earns him a pillow to the face and a pouty boyfriend, but it\u2019s nothing a kiss on the forehead and a squeeze around the shoulders can\u2019t usually fix.)</p><p>Dan doesn\u2019t say anything more, but he\u2019s turning his entire body towards Phil now, gripping his face more firmly under Phil\u2019s warm hand.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it,\u201d Phil says, echoing his words from hours ago. \u201cI was mad, but I didn\u2019t, not really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhil-\u201d Dan starts, but Phil stops him by shaking his head against his hold, almost violently.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t, I didn\u2019t,\u201d he repeats, pulling Dan\u2019s hand from his cheek and pressing it to his lips, voice choked against Dan\u2019s fingers.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Dan says, and Phil knows he isn\u2019t convinced, but it\u2019s okay, it\u2019s better. it\u2019s good enough for now.</p><p>\u201cDid you?\u201d he asks, because suddenly it all aches and burns and he\u2019s not the only one who said things, not the only one who needs to apologize and reassure-</p><p>\u201cMaybe I did. A little,\u201d Dan says, and it makes Phil\u2019s hold on Dan\u2019s hand loosen right away, makes him let out a shuddered breath, makes him close his eyes so he doesn\u2019t have to try and see the expression on Dan\u2019s face.</p><p>There\u2019s two hands on his cheeks, almost immediately, holding tight and pulling him closer until their foreheads touch and Dan\u2019s breath is against Phil\u2019s nose. \u201cPhil,\u201d he says, and he can almost feel the word forming against his skin. \u201cPhil,\u201d he says again, waiting for him to open his eyes.</p><p>Phil does, because even though his stomach hurts and his chest is tight he doesn\u2019t want to keep Dan waiting. Not for too long, not at all.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Dan says, and this time his lips do touch the skin on the side of Phil\u2019s nose, making his eyes feel heavy again with the weight of salty water threatening to overflow.</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d Phil asks, and he brings his hands up too, to cover Dan\u2019s, to keep them in place.</p><p>Dan kisses him again then, this time on the lips. It\u2019s short and salty and dry but Phil understands.</p><p>Dan doesn\u2019t answer him, even if the answer is already there, lingering between them. \u201cI love you,\u201d Dan says instead, when he pulls away. \u201cI love you I love you,\u201d he says again and again, until Phil lets go of his hands, until Phil is pushing himself closer, closer, impossibly close, and wraps his arms around Dan\u2019s body, chest and legs and cheeks pressing together.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Phil says. \u201cSo much,\u201d he adds, because it\u2019s true and it makes his heart ache a little less when he lets it out.</p><p>Phil understands, he knows, without a doubt. There\u2019s still much to talk about tomorrow, probably more feelings to be hurt and more wounds to bandage. Phil understands, he knows, it might not be entirely okay right now, but it will be. They\u2019ll make sure of it.</p>",

Dog barks. Something that is very likely his neighbor moaning in pleasure, followed by a loud banging noise that makes Phil cover his ears with his pillow, groaning in frustration.</p><p>At this time, usually, Phil&rsquo;s ears are filled with different sounds. Nice sounds. Sometimes murmured in the dark before a good night kiss, covering him like a thick warm blanket. Sometimes loud and full of life and teasing and banter on nights when energy runs high and responsibilities run low and he momentarily allows himself to forget his promise of being a proper adult who goes to sleep at a proper time.</p><p>Either way, these sounds are always comforting, familiar- and very painfully absent at the moment.</p><p>The apartment wasn&rsquo;t this quiet before, he reminds himself, grimacing into his pillow. Only a few hours ago it was filled with loud, angry words Phil usually knows how to hold back, directed like poisoned arrows towards the person Phil never wants to actually hurt.</p><p>They both said some things, he and Dan. Tension had run high for a couple of weeks now, and Phil knows that his tendency to keep to himself and hold back his hurt, quietly trying to work through things until he can&rsquo;t possibly keep quiet anymore, is pretty high on the list of reasons why tonight has played out the way it did.</p><p>He isn&rsquo;t blind to Dan&rsquo;s struggles. Isn&rsquo;t blind to the way Dan is working his hardest to overcome things Phil can probably never really understand to their core, trying to make up the missing puzzle pieces with long hours spent on mental health blogs and calls to his mum, who somehow always understands a little better than him.</p><p>And it hurts, sometimes, when it feels like maybe Dan is blind to the way Phil struggles as well, right next to him.</p><p>And maybe he&rsquo;s been spoiled by Dan. Been spoiled by the way Dan can usually pick up on every little facial expression, every little eyebrow crease, every little sign Phil is trying to hide to avoid adding unnecessary stress, to avoid opening up topics he is sure he can avoid by shoving them deep in a drawer in the back of his mind, locking it until they collect dust and lose their importance. Maybe that&rsquo;s what makes it hurt so much more, when Dan just lets it happen.</p><p>Maybe, sometimes, he wants Dan to notice everything Phil is trying to hide. Maybe he wants Dan to confront him before it all piles up inside his head and spills out of his eyes and ears and mouth, lips forming angry words he never wants to say, eyes leaking angry tears he never intends to cry.</p><p>He knows that mostly, usually, they are good at stopping before they go too far. Good at taking a time out when things get too heated, too close to spiteful. Phil is good at catching himself, good at remembering that he&rsquo;s mad now but he&rsquo;ll regret saying what he feels like spitting out later. He&rsquo;s good at not crossing the line, mostly, usually. Which makes it that much worse when sometimes, he&rsquo;s not.</p><p>The image of the hurt in Dan&rsquo;s eyes is still very much burnt into his eyelids, not letting him close his eyes and attempt sleep. Phil&rsquo;s weak &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I didn&rsquo;t mean it,&rdquo; said while watching Dan put on his shoes and coat by the front door, not lifting his eyes to meet Phil&rsquo;s desperate ones. His retort of &ldquo;yes, Phil, you did,&rdquo; before walking out the door, closing it behind him in an alarmingly quiet way, has been playing on repeat in Phil&rsquo;s mind for the last few hours, making him curl smaller under the covers, shoving his head deeper under his pillow.</p><p>He&rsquo;s not really worried about where Dan is. Dan answered his anxious text of &ldquo;Where are you? Please come home,&rdquo; about an hour ago, telling Phil he&rsquo;s just walking around not far from their building. Telling him he just needs to clear his head. Telling him to go to sleep. Dan learned, long ago, to not leave Phil hanging with things like that. So Phil is not really worried, not about that at least. He knows, that right now, all he can do is wait.</p><p>***************</p><p>It&rsquo;s not before 3 AM that Phil finally hears the front door opening and closing quietly, footsteps going to the kitchen, and then the bathroom. Phil doesn&rsquo;t know if Dan will come sleep next to him. Doesn&rsquo;t know if Dan&rsquo;s expression still shows the hurt it showed before, doesn&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;s covering it with a mask of indifference.</p><p>A part of him wants to get out of bed to check. To confront. To say that he&rsquo;s sorry again (but also, he thinks bitterly, to remind Dan that they&rsquo;re both guilty of stepping out of line. That he&rsquo;s not the only one who said things that shouldn&rsquo;t be said. That he is not the only one to blame).</p><p>But another part, small but paralyzing, is telling him to stay put. This part is making his legs shake and his breath hitch and his anxiety crawl under his skin because he doesn&rsquo;t know, and right now he&rsquo;s afraid to find out.</p><p>His heart is beating loudly in his chest until he finally hears the door to the bedroom creak open, feels a big, warm body settle next to him, his back turned to his.</p><p>He&rsquo;s a little afraid to breathe, afraid to move or turn around because he knows Dan knows he&rsquo;s awake, but he&rsquo;s still keeping quiet.</p><p>It takes him a minute to compose himself enough to squeak out a small unsure &ldquo;Dan?&rdquo; and it takes another 20 seconds for Dan to sigh out a quiet &ldquo;yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>They both turn around then, Phil facing Dan and Dan facing the ceiling, not quite engaging in Phil&rsquo;s attempt at eye contact, but definitely showing willingness to talk.</p><p>Phil doesn&rsquo;t know what to say. Doesn&rsquo;t know how to convey his relief and guilt and hurt in words, doesn&rsquo;t know if he should. He lets his hand wander, instead, hesitantly, testing the water, reaching it towards Dan&rsquo;s and wrapping his big long fingers in his own, squeezing.</p><p>&ldquo;Your hand is cold,&rdquo; Phil says, and when Dan hums in response he&rsquo;s pulling it toward his face, pressing his hand to his warm lips and cheek.</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s gaze turns to him then, just in time to see his eyes overflow with emotion, spilling new hot tears without his consent, making his cheeks and nose and Dan&rsquo;s hand wet with them. Dan looks at him for a moment, and Phil is having trouble reading his face without his glasses and with wetness clouding his eyes, but he feels it when Dan&rsquo;s thumb is wiggling out of his grasp, rubbing the pink skin under his eye relentlessly, making Phil squint.</p><p>&ldquo;Stop that,&rdquo; Dan says. His voice is commanding but also soft and it only makes Phil cry harder.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; he says. It&rsquo;s true, he can&rsquo;t. He isn&rsquo;t lying when he says he is starting to cry more frequently with age, starting to get more emotionally affected by things. (&ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably all the hormonal changes,&rdquo; Dan always says with a smirk, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t hurry, all your mpreg fantasies will be dead.&rdquo; It always earns him a pillow to the face and a pouty boyfriend, but it&rsquo;s nothing a kiss on the forehead and a squeeze around the shoulders can&rsquo;t usually fix.)</p><p>Dan doesn&rsquo;t say anything more, but he&rsquo;s turning his entire body towards Phil now, gripping his face more firmly under Phil&rsquo;s warm hand.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean it,&rdquo; Phil says, echoing his words from hours ago. &ldquo;I was mad, but I didn&rsquo;t, not really.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Phil-&rdquo; Dan starts, but Phil stops him by shaking his head against his hold, almost violently.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t, I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he repeats, pulling Dan&rsquo;s hand from his cheek and pressing it to his lips, voice choked against Dan&rsquo;s fingers.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Dan says, and Phil knows he isn&rsquo;t convinced, but it&rsquo;s okay, it&rsquo;s better. it&rsquo;s good enough for now.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you?&rdquo; he asks, because suddenly it all aches and burns and he&rsquo;s not the only one who said things, not the only one who needs to apologize and reassure-</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe I did. A little,&rdquo; Dan says, and it makes Phil&rsquo;s hold on Dan&rsquo;s hand loosen right away, makes him let out a shuddered breath, makes him close his eyes so he doesn&rsquo;t have to try and see the expression on Dan&rsquo;s face.</p><p>There&rsquo;s two hands on his cheeks, almost immediately, holding tight and pulling him closer until their foreheads touch and Dan&rsquo;s breath is against Phil&rsquo;s nose. &ldquo;Phil,&rdquo; he says, and he can almost feel the word forming against his skin. &ldquo;Phil,&rdquo; he says again, waiting for him to open his eyes.</p><p>Phil does, because even though his stomach hurts and his chest is tight he doesn&rsquo;t want to keep Dan waiting. Not for too long, not at all.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; Dan says, and this time his lips do touch the skin on the side of Phil&rsquo;s nose, making his eyes feel heavy again with the weight of salty water threatening to overflow.</p><p>&ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; Phil asks, and he brings his hands up too, to cover Dan&rsquo;s, to keep them in place.</p><p>Dan kisses him again then, this time on the lips. It&rsquo;s short and salty and dry but Phil understands.</p><p>Dan doesn&rsquo;t answer him, even if the answer is already there, lingering between them. &ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; Dan says instead, when he pulls away. &ldquo;I love you I love you,&rdquo; he says again and again, until Phil lets go of his hands, until Phil is pushing himself closer, closer, impossibly close, and wraps his arms around Dan&rsquo;s body, chest and legs and cheeks pressing together.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; Phil says. &ldquo;So much,&rdquo; he adds, because it&rsquo;s true and it makes his heart ache a little less when he lets it out.</p><p>Phil understands, he knows, without a doubt. There&rsquo;s still much to talk about tomorrow, probably more feelings to be hurt and more wounds to bandage. Phil understands, he knows, it might not be entirely okay right now, but it will be. They&rsquo;ll make sure of it.</p>",

better yet, why isn&rsquo;t she there with her in reading? sure, she&rsquo;d freak out a little seeing the critter but she&rsquo;d probably be able to take things into her own hands, and, maybe get a little thank-you gift (the soft rosypink kind) from dani in return.</p><p>&ldquo;fuck, where&rsquo;s it gone now?&rdquo; frustration seeps into dani&rsquo;s tone. there&rsquo;s the sound of shuffling, followed by the brief whooshing noise of the mosquito repellent spraying out of the nozzle. \u00a0</p><p>dani yelps all of a sudden. &ldquo;shit, shit, it&rsquo;s here, fuck!&rdquo; the aerosol can rattles and the spraying becomes more intense. dani&rsquo;s stringing colourful sentences of spite and directing it towards the assaulting insect. </p><p>&ldquo;to hell with you, fiend!&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;die, die, die!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;bloody motherf-AH FUCK!&rdquo;</p><p>honestly, despite the earlier bout of unease, it all seems a little too funny for fi to control the giggles bubbling from within. </p><p>&ldquo;ha! take tha-are you <i>laughing</i> at me, fiona?&rdquo; </p><p>fi can&rsquo;t stop giggling. </p><p>&ldquo;this fucker was crawling on my legs just as i was about to properly nurse my lady boner, killing off the entire mood - so i killed it instead - and you&rsquo;re laughing at my victory?&rsquo; dani whisper-screeches indignantly. fi&rsquo;s attuned enough to recognize the mirth in her tone (it&rsquo;s something dani would never admit), and the giggles escalate to full-blown pillowmuffled laughter. it doesn&rsquo;t take much longer for dani to start laughing along.</p><p>when they&rsquo;ve both calmed down somewhat fi remembers a little detail she&rsquo;d picked up from dani&rsquo;s dramatic little speech. &quot;so, how did that lady boner nursing go, hmm?&rdquo; fi waggles her eyebrows and then remembers that she doesn&rsquo;t have a screen (well, she does, but she can&rsquo;t quite see grainy danielle on the other side with her hard lines softened by fuzzy slow internet) and that dani can&rsquo;t exactly see her, but then dani says &ldquo;ugh. shut up. i can hear you waggling your fucking eyebrows right now, you perv.&rdquo;</p><p>maybe dani can see her after all. maybe she&rsquo;s secretly a psychic and can see the nights when she reaches out to the wetpinkred rawness within and soars heights with dani&rsquo;s name on her lips. </p><p>&ldquo;-fi, fi?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;huh? oh-yeah, sorry, yeah, i&rsquo;m here, i was just thinking about something,&rdquo; she splutters. it&rsquo;s not a lie. but it&rsquo;s not the entire truth either. </p><p>&ldquo;about what, hmm?&rdquo; dani teases. </p><p>&ldquo;you.&rdquo; fi says in an exaggerated sultry voice and laughs it off, hoping it doesn&rsquo;t come off as too put-on. dani shrieks in mock horror and joins in, because of course she does. they share pillowmuffled laughter for the second time within five minutes, and when it wears off a comfortable silence settles between them for a bit. \u00a0</p><p>dani&rsquo;s the one to break it now. &ldquo;hey fi?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;hmm?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;you reckon we&rsquo;d get a place together someday?&rdquo;</p><p>the thought shouldn&rsquo;t feel so much like a promise, but it does. it feels like a window of hope. a kind of assurance that this pretty person would still be a big part of her life a few years into the future, that she&rsquo;d still stay, that she&rsquo;d get to do and say the things she wants to with her. it feels like a roundabout way of saying &ldquo;let&rsquo;s build a life together, a life void of whatever it is that&rsquo;s keeping us apart.&rdquo; fi wants nothing more than to subscribe to it. aches and burns from the past tend to resurface, as they always do, but she knows deep down with an ancient kind of knowing that dani&rsquo;s here to stay. </p><p>so she says with a fierce sort of assurance that comes from a place transcending time, &ldquo;yeah. we will. and we&rsquo;ll be a little more compassionate to these critters the next time.&rdquo;</p>",

oh-yeah, sorry, yeah, i&rsquo;m here, i was just thinking about something,&rdquo; she splutters. it&rsquo;s not a lie. but it&rsquo;s not the entire truth either. </p><p>&ldquo;about what, hmm?&rdquo; dani teases. </p><p>&ldquo;you.&rdquo; fi says in an exaggerated sultry voice and laughs it off, hoping it doesn&rsquo;t come off as too put-on. dani shrieks in mock horror and joins in, because of course she does. they share pillowmuffled laughter for the second time within five minutes, and when it wears off a comfortable silence settles between them for a bit. &nbsp;</p><p>dani&rsquo;s the one to break it now. &ldquo;hey fi?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;hmm?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;you reckon we&rsquo;d get a place together someday?&rdquo;</p><p>the thought shouldn&rsquo;t feel so much like a promise, but it does. it feels like a window of hope. a kind of assurance that this pretty person would still be a big part of her life a few years into the future, that she&rsquo;d still stay, that she&rsquo;d get to do and say the things she wants to with her. it feels like a roundabout way of saying &ldquo;let&rsquo;s build a life together, a life void of whatever it is that&rsquo;s keeping us apart.&rdquo; fi wants nothing more than to subscribe to it. aches and burns from the past tend to resurface, as they always do, but she knows deep down with an ancient kind of knowing that dani&rsquo;s here to stay. </p><p>so she says with a fierce sort of assurance that comes from a place transcending time, &ldquo;yeah. we will. and we&rsquo;ll be a little more compassionate to these critters the next time.&rdquo;</p>",
