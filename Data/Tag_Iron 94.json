In three minutes, in Bucky\u2019s time zone at least, it will be Tony\u2019s birthday. Even though it\u2019s another three hours until it\u2019s time for Tony\u2019s birthday in California, Bucky doesn\u2019t give a fuck. Celebrating International Tony Reallyveryintelligent\u2019s Day is an all day activity, and the day starts at midnight. It started a couple of weeks ago, really, but that doesn\u2019t matter. </p><p>\tHe doesn\u2019t know Tony\u2019s last name, but he\u2019s still one of the best friends that Bucky has ever had. Tony likely won\u2019t see whatever Bucky posts about him until well into tomorrow - his dad is hosting some big party for the \u2018event\u2019 that Tony had scoffed at through numerous text messages, dreading his own birthday like most kids did the dentist. Bucky had coaxed him into being at least excited to talk to Bucky the night of; Tony\u2019s parents (bastards) leave for a cruise tomorrow at three PST, which means that Tony will want to be in voice chat at about 3:15. Bucky has already begged off of family dinner for tomorrow, and he\u2019s real lucky that his mom understands the importance of friends, even the ones online. </p><p>\tSo, with all of this planned out, one could imagine Bucky\u2019s surprise when his Discord starts ringing in a call at 12:01am, Eastern Standard, right after he\u2019s posted his birthday post for Tony, and it\u2019s not even a voice call but a <i>video</i> call, from Tony himself. Tony who never video calls. Tony who never sends selfies. Tony who is so shy about his appearance that Bucky has only ever seen pictures of his hands, or of his designs, never of Tony\u2019s face. Bucky confirms the call and pauses his Spotify, placing his full attention with his Discord and the fuzzy video picture that\u2019s getting less fuzzy by the second. When he can see clearly, Bucky nearly chokes on his own spit. </p><p>\tTony looks a little younger than seventeen. He has bright eyes with bags beneath them, but his face is so baby soft that he looks about fourteen, tops. He\u2019s got a sweet curve to his mouth that says that he smiles a lot, but a sadness in his eyes that says it\u2019s not always real. His nose is rounded at the tip, not big and not small, but perfect for his face. The arch of his eyebrows is expressive, and, all together, his Tony is a very pretty young man. However, there are two things that are most important. The first, less important thing is that Bucky\u2019s Tony is <i>Tony Stark,</i> heir to Stark Industries and son of Howard Stark, one of the richest men in America. More importantly, secondly, his Tony is<i> crying.</i> At least, he has been crying, even if he\u2019s trying to cover it up, Bucky can see the redness around his eyes, the tear tracks he hasn\u2019t properly wiped away. </p><p>\t\u201cTony, sweetheart, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Bucky says, dropping<i> sweetheart</i> immediately even if he\u2019s never been brave enough to call his friend that before, even in voice call. Tony is smiling through his tears in a way that looks like he\u2019s happily swallowing knives, or something to that effect. Bucky wants to crawl through the screen just to hold him, a desire that he has had before, even in the beginning when they were only talking through tumblr DMs. Tony hiccups, and then he speaks, and he\u2019s so goddamn pretty, even when he\u2019s crying. </p><p>\t\u201cHey Buckaroo. What\u2019s up?\u201d Tony asks, changing the subject like he always does when he\u2019s upset (Bucky had to wrangle exactly how bad Tony\u2019s dad is through several days of what felt like careful espionage, and he\u2019s still not sure he knows the worst of it). He wants to hold Tony, card metal fingers through his hair, whisper to him and tell him that he\u2019s alright, that he\u2019s good, and that he\u2019s worth everything Bucky wants to give him. </p><p>\t\u201cBack track, honey, I need you to tell me what\u2019s up. I thought you were at a party tonight, Tones. What happened? Can you tell me? For me?\u201d Bucky coaxes softly, and it\u2019s a low blow, but whatever it takes, after all. Tony doesn\u2019t like to put things on other people, so it\u2019s better if it\u2019s for Bucky\u2019s sake; Tony knows that his friend will worry, will internalize it and blow it up, will think about it for days. Instead, Tony sighs. </p><p>\t\u201cHoward,\u201d Tony says, which is what he always calls his father when the man isn\u2019t in the room (other than <i>dear old dad,</i> which gives Bucky just as much of a bad feeling), and sighs again, \u201cdecided I was a disappointment again tonight. He said a lot of shit to me, in front of a lot of people, and managed to make it seem completely kosher. So, once again, I\u2019m the rebellious shit kicker, and Howard comes out smelling like roses. It\u2019s\u2026 god, it\u2019s fucking bullshit.\u201d Tony finishes with something that sounds like it starts as a laugh and ends as a sob, and Bucky winces. He doesn\u2019t know how to comfort this, how to make it better, how to help at all, and he feels like such a piece of shit. </p><p>\t\u201cCheck your @ mentions on tumblr,\u201d he blurts, and Tony tilts his head and he looks so cute and Bucky wants to die. \u201cJust\u2026 check your @ mentions. Please,\u201d Bucky repeats, more confident this time, and Tony takes the distraction. He clicks out of the window he has Discord in, and Bucky can see him dragging the little box that has the video feed of Bucky in it, which just makes him smile. Tony is real cute, after all. He watches as Tony scrolls through things, and sees him see what Bucky posted. </p><p>\t\u201cSnowflake, what is this?\u201d Tony asks, and the use of the nickname makes Bucky\u2019s stomach drop out with butterflies like it does every time. It\u2019s another story for another time, how Bucky got that nickname, but he thinks he would hate it if it came from anyone else. Bucky scrubs his metal hand on the back of his neck, giving Tony a shy smile. </p><p>\t\u201cA moodboard for you\u2026 and a fic for McKirk, maybe dedicated to you?\u201d Bucky replies, biting his lip. He knows it\u2019s a lot, but\u2026 it\u2019s what Tony deserves. Star Trek is the fandom that made the two of them friends after all, a shared love of McKirk and a quiet respect for Spock that sometimes extended to shipping McSpirk or just Spirk but. Well. McKirk is special, because they\u2019ve agreed that Tony is the Kirk type, suave and sunshine, while Bucky is more of a McCoy, gruff and reining Tony in, and. There\u2019s something he wrote into Kirk\u2019s character that will make it special for Tony, and there\u2019s a reference in McCoy\u2019s character that makes it specific and well\u2026 Bucky projected them onto McKirk, okay? He can admit that. </p><p><i>\t\u201cYou,\u201d </i>Tony says, cracking his first genuine smile of the call, \u201care a menace.\u201d He only says that when Bucky does things that he thinks are too nice, and Bucky wants to do a hundred nice things. He watches as Tony reads over the fic (Tony once tried to explain how fast he reads to Bucky, saying things like twelve hundred words a minute and choking on a blush that Bucky could hear through the mic, and Bucky had just put him out of his misery by saying <i>\u201cso, fast, right?\u201d </i>which Tony had laughed at), and knows when he reaches the part that reads as too much. Kirk is trans and McCoy has a metal prosthetic and Tony looks at him like he hung the moon and Bucky is halfway in love with a boy three thousand miles away. </p><p>\t\u201cSo\u2026 what did you think?\u201d he asks after a few moments of silence, biting down hard on his lip. Tony stares at the box version of him hard, which Bucky almost feels as if it\u2019s burning through his skin. </p><p>\t\u201cI just\u2026 Why? This must have been so much work, Bucky. And\u2026 exactly at 9? So\u2026 midnight for you? Exactly? Bucky,\u201d Tony says, choking on his words, and Bucky wants to<i> hold him. </i></p><p><b><i>\t\u201cI never want you to think you\u2019re anything less than my top priority,\u201d</i></b> he says honestly, deep and almost growling in the way that he knows Tony likes based off of the way that it has inspired silence before, and Tony\u2019s <i>looking at him.</i> Bucky wants him to look for the rest of forever and maybe keep looking. </p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019re perfect. Did you know that? You\u2019re the most perfect person I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d Tony tells him, and then Bucky is choking on a blush and Tony is looking like that cat that caught the canary. Bucky recollects himself. </p><p>\t\u201cI think that\u2019s you, sugar. No matter what Howard says, no matter what anyone ever fuckin\u2019 says, you are the most perfect person in the world, I promise you that. You are<i> perfect,\u201d</i> Bucky emphasizes, going from teasing to imploring, and Tony freezes. </p><p>\t\u201cI think I like you more than I planned,\u201d the Californian admits, word vomiting, and Bucky sighs in relief. </p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m damn glad. I\u2019ve been likin\u2019 you more than I planned for months. I know we\u2019re far away, but\u2026 would you maybe like to\u2026 go together? Be mine?\u201d Bucky asks stiltedly, feeling panic in his lungs even when Tony admitted himself first, because the idea that Tony wants him back is<i> otherworldly.</i> Tony nods. </p><p>\t\u201cBe mine, Valentine. I\u2019m Tony Stark, I\u2019m seventeen, I live in Malibu, and I\u2019m about to graduate with my second doctorate, looking for a college to get my third. I really like this really great guy who has these really pretty blue eyes that I\u2019ve just been staring at in his selfies for the longest time,\u201d Tony says, giving him that \u2018suave\u2019 smirk that\u2019s been so rumored, and Bucky loves it. He smiles back. </p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m Bucky Barnes. I\u2019m eighteen, I\u2019m going to college at NYU this June for engineering, I live in a shit neighborhood in Brooklyn with my best friend Steve. I like this real great fella named Tony with these big brown eyes that I\u2019m just seein\u2019 for the first time today, but I\u2019d sure love to see them a lot from now on,\u201d Bucky flirts back, and Tony flushes, dark red taking over his olive toned skin. Then, Tony seems to be thinking for a moment, biting his lip. </p><p>\t\u201cSpeaking of New York\u2026 I\u2019m coming to tour Columbia next month, and I haven\u2019t booked a hotel yet\u2026 Think you could help me find somewhere to crash?\u201d Tony asks, wording it vaguely, but Bucky can read between the lines. His heart nearly jumps out of his chest. </p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s a date,\u201d he says. </p></blockquote>",

It\u2019s\u2026 god, it\u2019s fucking bullshit.\u201d Tony finishes with something that sounds like it starts as a laugh and ends as a sob, and Bucky winces. He doesn\u2019t know how to comfort this, how to make it better, how to help at all, and he feels like such a piece of shit. </p><p>\t\u201cCheck your @ mentions on tumblr,\u201d he blurts, and Tony tilts his head and he looks so cute and Bucky wants to die. \u201cJust\u2026 check your @ mentions. Please,\u201d Bucky repeats, more confident this time, and Tony takes the distraction. He clicks out of the window he has Discord in, and Bucky can see him dragging the little box that has the video feed of Bucky in it, which just makes him smile. Tony is real cute, after all. He watches as Tony scrolls through things, and sees him see what Bucky posted. </p><p>\t\u201cSnowflake, what is this?\u201d Tony asks, and the use of the nickname makes Bucky\u2019s stomach drop out with butterflies like it does every time. It\u2019s another story for another time, how Bucky got that nickname, but he thinks he would hate it if it came from anyone else. Bucky scrubs his metal hand on the back of his neck, giving Tony a shy smile. </p><p>\t\u201cA moodboard for you\u2026 and a fic for McKirk, maybe dedicated to you?\u201d Bucky replies, biting his lip. He knows it\u2019s a lot, but\u2026 it\u2019s what Tony deserves. Star Trek is the fandom that made the two of them friends after all, a shared love of McKirk and a quiet respect for Spock that sometimes extended to shipping McSpirk or just Spirk but. Well. McKirk is special, because they\u2019ve agreed that Tony is the Kirk type, suave and sunshine, while Bucky is more of a McCoy, gruff and reining Tony in, and. There\u2019s something he wrote into Kirk\u2019s character that will make it special for Tony, and there\u2019s a reference in McCoy\u2019s character that makes it specific and well\u2026 Bucky projected them onto McKirk, okay? He can admit that. </p><p><i>\t\u201cYou,\u201d </i>Tony says, cracking his first genuine smile of the call, \u201care a menace.\u201d He only says that when Bucky does things that he thinks are too nice, and Bucky wants to do a hundred nice things. He watches as Tony reads over the fic (Tony once tried to explain how fast he reads to Bucky, saying things like twelve hundred words a minute and choking on a blush that Bucky could hear through the mic, and Bucky had just put him out of his misery by saying <i>\u201cso, fast, right?\u201d </i>which Tony had laughed at), and knows when he reaches the part that reads as too much. Kirk is trans and McCoy has a metal prosthetic and Tony looks at him like he hung the moon and Bucky is halfway in love with a boy three thousand miles away. </p><p>\t\u201cSo\u2026 what did you think?\u201d he asks after a few moments of silence, biting down hard on his lip. Tony stares at the box version of him hard, which Bucky almost feels as if it\u2019s burning through his skin. </p><p>\t\u201cI just\u2026 Why? This must have been so much work, Bucky. And\u2026 exactly at 9? So\u2026 midnight for you? Exactly? Bucky,\u201d Tony says, choking on his words, and Bucky wants to<i> hold him. </i></p><p><b><i>\t\u201cI never want you to think you\u2019re anything less than my top priority,\u201d</i></b> he says honestly, deep and almost growling in the way that he knows Tony likes based off of the way that it has inspired silence before, and Tony\u2019s <i>looking at him.</i> Bucky wants him to look for the rest of forever and maybe keep looking. </p><p>\t\u201cYou\u2019re perfect. Did you know that? You\u2019re the most perfect person I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d Tony tells him, and then Bucky is choking on a blush and Tony is looking like that cat that caught the canary. Bucky recollects himself. </p><p>\t\u201cI think that\u2019s you, sugar. No matter what Howard says, no matter what anyone ever fuckin\u2019 says, you are the most perfect person in the world, I promise you that. You are<i> perfect,\u201d</i> Bucky emphasizes, going from teasing to imploring, and Tony freezes. </p><p>\t\u201cI think I like you more than I planned,\u201d the Californian admits, word vomiting, and Bucky sighs in relief. </p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m damn glad. I\u2019ve been likin\u2019 you more than I planned for months. I know we\u2019re far away, but\u2026 would you maybe like to\u2026 go together? Be mine?\u201d Bucky asks stiltedly, feeling panic in his lungs even when Tony admitted himself first, because the idea that Tony wants him back is<i> otherworldly.</i> Tony nods. </p><p>\t\u201cBe mine, Valentine. I\u2019m Tony Stark, I\u2019m seventeen, I live in Malibu, and I\u2019m about to graduate with my second doctorate, looking for a college to get my third. I really like this really great guy who has these really pretty blue eyes that I\u2019ve just been staring at in his selfies for the longest time,\u201d Tony says, giving him that \u2018suave\u2019 smirk that\u2019s been so rumored, and Bucky loves it. He smiles back. </p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m Bucky Barnes. I\u2019m eighteen, I\u2019m going to college at NYU this June for engineering, I live in a shit neighborhood in Brooklyn with my best friend Steve. I like this real great fella named Tony with these big brown eyes that I\u2019m just seein\u2019 for the first time today, but I\u2019d sure love to see them a lot from now on,\u201d Bucky flirts back, and Tony flushes, dark red taking over his olive toned skin. Then, Tony seems to be thinking for a moment, biting his lip. </p><p>\t\u201cSpeaking of New York\u2026 I\u2019m coming to tour Columbia next month, and I haven\u2019t booked a hotel yet\u2026 Think you could help me find somewhere to crash?\u201d Tony asks, wording it vaguely, but Bucky can read between the lines. His heart nearly jumps out of his chest. </p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s a date,\u201d he says. </p></blockquote></p>",

Well, he\u2019s a dumb, bi bitch, but the integral parts are that he is really fucking stupid and loves boys. Well, one boy in particular, right now. He knows that he\u2019s stupid as he writes what he\u2019s writing, as he makes what he\u2019s making, but he doesn\u2019t care. </p></blockquote>[[MORE]]<blockquote><p>\tIt\u2019s 11:57pm, May 28th, Eastern Standard time. In three minutes, in Bucky\u2019s time zone at least, it will be Tony\u2019s birthday. Even though it\u2019s another three hours until it\u2019s time for Tony\u2019s birthday in California, Bucky doesn\u2019t give a fuck. Celebrating International Tony Reallyveryintelligent\u2019s Day is an all day activity, and the day starts at midnight. It started a couple of weeks ago, really, but that doesn\u2019t matter. </p><p>\tHe doesn\u2019t know Tony\u2019s last name, but he\u2019s still one of the best friends that Bucky has ever had. Tony likely won\u2019t see whatever Bucky posts about him until well into tomorrow - his dad is hosting some big party for the \u2018event\u2019 that Tony had scoffed at through numerous text messages, dreading his own birthday like most kids did the dentist. Bucky had coaxed him into being at least excited to talk to Bucky the night of; Tony\u2019s parents (bastards) leave for a cruise tomorrow at three PST, which means that Tony will want to be in voice chat at about 3:15. Bucky has already begged off of family dinner for tomorrow, and he\u2019s real lucky that his mom understands the importance of friends, even the ones online. </p><p>\tSo, with all of this planned out, one could imagine Bucky\u2019s surprise when his Discord starts ringing in a call at 12:01am, Eastern Standard, right after he\u2019s posted his birthday post for Tony, and it\u2019s not even a voice call but a <i>video</i> call, from Tony himself. Tony who never video calls. Tony who never sends selfies. Tony who is so shy about his appearance that Bucky has only ever seen pictures of his hands, or of his designs, never of Tony\u2019s face. Bucky confirms the call and pauses his Spotify, placing his full attention with his Discord and the fuzzy video picture that\u2019s getting less fuzzy by the second. When he can see clearly, Bucky nearly chokes on his own spit. </p><p>\tTony looks a little younger than seventeen. He has bright eyes with bags beneath them, but his face is so baby soft that he looks about fourteen, tops. He\u2019s got a sweet curve to his mouth that says that he smiles a lot, but a sadness in his eyes that says it\u2019s not always real. His nose is rounded at the tip, not big and not small, but perfect for his face. The arch of his eyebrows is expressive, and, all together, his Tony is a very pretty young man. However, there are two things that are most important. The first, less important thing is that Bucky\u2019s Tony is <i>Tony Stark,</i> heir to Stark Industries and son of Howard Stark, one of the richest men in America. More importantly, secondly, his Tony is<i> crying.</i> At least, he has been crying, even if he\u2019s trying to cover it up, Bucky can see the redness around his eyes, the tear tracks he hasn\u2019t properly wiped away. </p><p>\t\u201cTony, sweetheart, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Bucky says, dropping<i> sweetheart</i> immediately even if he\u2019s never been brave enough to call his friend that before, even in voice call. Tony is smiling through his tears in a way that looks like he\u2019s happily swallowing knives, or something to that effect. Bucky wants to crawl through the screen just to hold him, a desire that he has had before, even in the beginning when they were only talking through tumblr DMs. Tony hiccups, and then he speaks, and he\u2019s so goddamn pretty, even when he\u2019s crying. </p><p>\t\u201cHey Buckaroo. What\u2019s up?\u201d Tony asks, changing the subject like he always does when he\u2019s upset (Bucky had to wrangle exactly how bad Tony\u2019s dad is through several days of what felt like careful espionage, and he\u2019s still not sure he knows the worst of it). He wants to hold Tony, card metal fingers through his hair, whisper to him and tell him that he\u2019s alright, that he\u2019s good, and that he\u2019s worth everything Bucky wants to give him. </p><p>\t\u201cBack track, honey, I need you to tell me what\u2019s up. I thought you were at a party tonight, Tones. What happened? Can you tell me? For me?\u201d Bucky coaxes softly, and it\u2019s a low blow, but whatever it takes, after all. Tony doesn\u2019t like to put things on other people, so it\u2019s better if it\u2019s for Bucky\u2019s sake; Tony knows that his friend will worry, will internalize it and blow it up, will think about it for days. Instead, Tony sighs. </p><p>\t\u201cHoward,\u201d Tony says, which is what he always calls his father when the man isn\u2019t in the room (other than <i>dear old dad,</i> which gives Bucky just as much of a bad feeling), and sighs again, \u201cdecided I was a disappointment again tonight.

Tony doesn&rsquo;t like to put things on other people, so it&rsquo;s better if it&rsquo;s for Bucky&rsquo;s sake; Tony knows that his friend will worry, will internalize it and blow it up, will think about it for days. Instead, Tony sighs. </p><p>\t&ldquo;Howard,&rdquo; Tony says, which is what he always calls his father when the man isn&rsquo;t in the room (other than <i>dear old dad,</i> which gives Bucky just as much of a bad feeling), and sighs again, &ldquo;decided I was a disappointment again tonight. He said a lot of shit to me, in front of a lot of people, and managed to make it seem completely kosher. So, once again, I&rsquo;m the rebellious shit kicker, and Howard comes out smelling like roses. It&rsquo;s&hellip; god, it&rsquo;s fucking bullshit.&rdquo; Tony finishes with something that sounds like it starts as a laugh and ends as a sob, and Bucky winces. He doesn&rsquo;t know how to comfort this, how to make it better, how to help at all, and he feels like such a piece of shit. </p><p>\t&ldquo;Check your @ mentions on tumblr,&rdquo; he blurts, and Tony tilts his head and he looks so cute and Bucky wants to die. &ldquo;Just&hellip; check your @ mentions. Please,&rdquo; Bucky repeats, more confident this time, and Tony takes the distraction. He clicks out of the window he has Discord in, and Bucky can see him dragging the little box that has the video feed of Bucky in it, which just makes him smile. Tony is real cute, after all. He watches as Tony scrolls through things, and sees him see what Bucky posted. </p><p>\t&ldquo;Snowflake, what is this?&rdquo; Tony asks, and the use of the nickname makes Bucky&rsquo;s stomach drop out with butterflies like it does every time. It&rsquo;s another story for another time, how Bucky got that nickname, but he thinks he would hate it if it came from anyone else. Bucky scrubs his metal hand on the back of his neck, giving Tony a shy smile. </p><p>\t&ldquo;A moodboard for you&hellip; and a fic for McKirk, maybe dedicated to you?&rdquo; Bucky replies, biting his lip. He knows it&rsquo;s a lot, but&hellip; it&rsquo;s what Tony deserves. Star Trek is the fandom that made the two of them friends after all, a shared love of McKirk and a quiet respect for Spock that sometimes extended to shipping McSpirk or just Spirk but. Well. McKirk is special, because they&rsquo;ve agreed that Tony is the Kirk type, suave and sunshine, while Bucky is more of a McCoy, gruff and reining Tony in, and. There&rsquo;s something he wrote into Kirk&rsquo;s character that will make it special for Tony, and there&rsquo;s a reference in McCoy&rsquo;s character that makes it specific and well&hellip; Bucky projected them onto McKirk, okay? He can admit that. </p><p><i>\t&ldquo;You,&rdquo; </i>Tony says, cracking his first genuine smile of the call, &ldquo;are a menace.&rdquo; He only says that when Bucky does things that he thinks are too nice, and Bucky wants to do a hundred nice things. He watches as Tony reads over the fic (Tony once tried to explain how fast he reads to Bucky, saying things like twelve hundred words a minute and choking on a blush that Bucky could hear through the mic, and Bucky had just put him out of his misery by saying <i>&ldquo;so, fast, right?&rdquo; </i>which Tony had laughed at), and knows when he reaches the part that reads as too much. Kirk is trans and McCoy has a metal prosthetic and Tony looks at him like he hung the moon and Bucky is halfway in love with a boy three thousand miles away. </p><p>\t&ldquo;So&hellip; what did you think?&rdquo; he asks after a few moments of silence, biting down hard on his lip. Tony stares at the box version of him hard, which Bucky almost feels as if it&rsquo;s burning through his skin. </p><p>\t&ldquo;I just&hellip; Why? This must have been so much work, Bucky. And&hellip; exactly at 9? So&hellip; midnight for you? Exactly? Bucky,&rdquo; Tony says, choking on his words, and Bucky wants to<i> hold him. </i></p><p><b><i>\t&ldquo;I never want you to think you&rsquo;re anything less than my top priority,&rdquo;</i></b> he says honestly, deep and almost growling in the way that he knows Tony likes based off of the way that it has inspired silence before, and Tony&rsquo;s <i>looking at him.</i> Bucky wants him to look for the rest of forever and maybe keep looking. </p><p>\t&ldquo;You&rsquo;re perfect. Did you know that? You&rsquo;re the most perfect person I&rsquo;ve ever met,&rdquo; Tony tells him, and then Bucky is choking on a blush and Tony is looking like that cat that caught the canary. Bucky recollects himself. </p><p>\t&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s you, sugar. No matter what Howard says, no matter what anyone ever fuckin&rsquo; says, you are the most perfect person in the world, I promise you that. You are<i> perfect,&rdquo;</i> Bucky emphasizes, going from teasing to imploring, and Tony freezes. </p><p>\t&ldquo;I think I like you more than I planned,&rdquo; the Californian admits, word vomiting, and Bucky sighs in relief. </p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;m damn glad. I&rsquo;ve been likin&rsquo; you more than I planned for months. I know we&rsquo;re far away, but&hellip; would you maybe like to&hellip; go together? Be mine?&rdquo; Bucky asks stiltedly, feeling panic in his lungs even when Tony admitted himself first, because the idea that Tony wants him back is<i> otherworldly.</i> Tony nods. </p><p>\t&ldquo;Be mine, Valentine. I&rsquo;m Tony Stark, I&rsquo;m seventeen, I live in Malibu, and I&rsquo;m about to graduate with my second doctorate, looking for a college to get my third. I really like this really great guy who has these really pretty blue eyes that I&rsquo;ve just been staring at in his selfies for the longest time,&rdquo; Tony says, giving him that &lsquo;suave&rsquo; smirk that&rsquo;s been so rumored, and Bucky loves it. He smiles back. </p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Bucky Barnes. I&rsquo;m eighteen, I&rsquo;m going to college at NYU this June for engineering, I live in a shit neighborhood in Brooklyn with my best friend Steve. I like this real great fella named Tony with these big brown eyes that I&rsquo;m just seein&rsquo; for the first time today, but I&rsquo;d sure love to see them a lot from now on,&rdquo; Bucky flirts back, and Tony flushes, dark red taking over his olive toned skin. Then, Tony seems to be thinking for a moment, biting his lip. </p><p>\t&ldquo;Speaking of New York&hellip; I&rsquo;m coming to tour Columbia next month, and I haven&rsquo;t booked a hotel yet&hellip; Think you could help me find somewhere to crash?&rdquo; Tony asks, wording it vaguely, but Bucky can read between the lines. His heart nearly jumps out of his chest. </p><p>\t&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a date,&rdquo; he says. </p></blockquote></p>",
