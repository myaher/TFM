TJ lets\u00a0himself into his apartment knowing his mom wouldn&rsquo;t be home. TJ sets his backpack down on the kitchen counter and picks up the little post-it note left on the edge in a clearly visible spot so TJ would notice it once he arrived. The note reads;</p><p><i>\u2018Working late tonight but can\u2019t wait to hear about tryouts in the morning. There\u2019s a plate of dinner for you to heat up in the fridge,\u00a0</i><i>love mom\u2019</i>.\u00a0</p><p>TJ smiles to himself for a moment that she always signs her notes off with \u2018mom\u2019 even though it was just the two of them and therefore no one else to mistake as the sender of the note.\u00a0</p><p>With a hand on his stomach, TJ wanders over to the refrigerator to have a look at what was on the menu for the evening. TJ is disappointed to find a half eaten plate of meatloaf and mashed potatoes. The basketball captain lets out a heavy sigh and calls out loudly,\u00a0\u201cReed, are you here?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIn your room.\u201d His voice bellows from down the hall.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cDid you eat half of my dinner?\u201d TJ grumpily closes the fridge and sulks down the hall towards his room.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI was hungry.\u201d Reed chuckles.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cDude?\u201d TJ gives him an unimpressed look once he reaches his bedroom door. The younger blonde is sitting on TJ\u2019s floor, his gaze focused on the small TV set as he plays the xbox hooked up to it.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>Dude.</i>\u201d Reed mimics TJ\u2019s tone.\u00a0\u201cI left you half.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cGee thanks, Reed, that\u2019s so generous of you to leave me half of my own dinner.\u201d TJ says sarcastically.\u00a0<br/></p><!-- more --><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Reed jokes.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou know my mom gave you that key for emergencies?\u201d TJ scoffs as he still hovers in the doorway.<br/></p><p>\u201cI was bored,\u201d Reed says as he sits the game controller in his lap and finally meets TJ\u2019s gaze,\u00a0\u201cThat seemed like an emergency to me.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have anyone else you can annoy?\u201d TJ exaggerates an eye roll.\u00a0\u201cLike Lester?\u201d<br/></p><p>Reed smirks,\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s grounded.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d he do this time?\u201d TJ asks with no inkling of surprise about his friends punishment.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know.\u201d Reed offers up a shrug with a light laugh.\u00a0\u201cWant next round?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>TJ thinks about the math homework he had been avoiding for two days and is conflicted for a second before ultimately accepting the controller and taking a seat beside Reed on the floor. The two sit with their backs resting against TJ\u2019s bed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou seem extra stressy today.\u201d Reed readjusts his position to a comfier one now that he was viewing the game instead of playing.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI had tryouts today for the team.\u201d TJ shakes his head at his friend.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cOh crap, I completely forgot.\u201d Reed laughs.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t concerned at how long it took me to get home from school?\u201d TJ asks rhetorically.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d tryouts go, captain?\u201d Reed mockingly salutes TJ to which the taller boy elbows him in response, all the while keeping his eyes fixated on his small television screen as he plays his turn.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cEveryone is pretty hopeless,\u201d TJ grunts,\u00a0\u201cAnd get this right, a <i>girl </i>tried out for the team.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWhy would she try out for the boys basketball team?\u201d Reed scrunches his face in confusion.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cJefferson doesn\u2019t have a girls team.\u201d TJ explains.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWas she any good?\u201d Reed questions.<br/></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s besides the point.\u201d TJ lets out a frustrated breath once he loses his turn.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Reed reclaims the controller for another go.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a girl.\u201d TJ offers up weakly.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou scared she\u2019s going to be better than you?\u201d Reed teases.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cAs if.\u201d TJ rolls his eyes but there was some truth behind Reed\u2019s quip.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s just embarrassing having a girl on the team.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNot if she\u2019s good.\u201d Reed says.<br/></p><p>\u201cI don&rsquo;t know. I just don\u2019t want her on the team.\u201d TJ says huffily knowing he had no real basis for his argument.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cIs she cute?\u201d Reed asks.\u00a0\u201cSorry dumb question,\u201d He adds with a laugh.\u00a0\u201cI forgot you don\u2019t exactly care about that kind of thing.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou know that\u2019s not how it works right?\u201d TJ frowns.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Reed says a little nicer.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou haven&rsquo;t told anyone, have you?\u201d TJ asks quietly.\u00a0\u201cNot even Lester?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d Reed says firmly and he puts his controller down to look at TJ so he knew he was being genuine,\u00a0\u201cI told you, I got your back no matter what.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>TJ nods slightly and shakes off the heaviness of the moment. \u201cMy turn.\u201d TJ changes the subject as\u00a0the pair were very rarely in-depth feelings sharing kind of friends and their discussion about TJ maybe being gay a few weeks ago had filled their sappy talk quota for a while.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Reed gives up the controller.\u00a0\u201cHey, you got any savings from the gym?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cA little why?\u201d TJ questions.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cTo order pizza.\u201d Reed says with a cheesy grin.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat about half of my meatloaf you already ate?\u201d TJ asks.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cIt was not good, that\u2019s why I only ate half.\u201d Reed holds back his laugh.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to tell my mom you said that.\u201d TJ laughs.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cShe won&rsquo;t believe you.\u201d Reed says confidently,\u00a0\u201cTess loves me.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s only because she doesn\u2019t know half of the crap you get up to these days.\u201d TJ scoffs.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cHey, what our parents don\u2019t know won&rsquo;t kill them.\u201d Reed smirks devilishly.\u00a0<br/></p><p>TJ quickly comes to terms with the fact that he\u2019d have to use part of his latest paycheck for pizza as Reed was unlikely to let the idea go. TJ jokes that for a rich boy, Reed is often spending TJ\u2019s hard earned money to to which Reed rolls his eyes and assures TJ he\u2019s good for it.</p><p>Reed was TJ\u2019s oldest friend.The two met when TJ was nine and Reed was eight. TJ had just started to get into dirt biking and they met at a popular riding spot. Reed had been doing it since he was much younger and was a great help for the beginner. The two were fast friends and have only gotten closer since. In fact, there was one point in time where the two almost became stepbrothers. TJ\u2019s mom, Tess was engaged to Reed\u2019s dad, Michael but she called it off because Michael\u2019s all consuming work schedule was a really big issue within their relationship. Michael became quite bitter about the breakup and for sometime after he banned Reed from seeing TJ but thankfully he eventually dropped his anger towards TJ and let his son see him again. Although her relationship ended with his father, Tess is still quite motherly to Reed, hence the spare key and complete comfort Reed feels being in their apartment alone.</p><p>Shortly after they first connected, Reed introduced TJ to Lester whom he knew from school. Both Lester and Reed go to Lincoln Academy which is a private school across town, one that goes from kindergarten right through until high school. Upon introducing Lester to TJ, the three instantly clicked as a group. Lester tends to be the quietest of the three even though\u00a0he\u2019s the oldest, he\u2019s shy around new people but when it came to TJ and Reed he showed a lot more personality. The three earn a reputation as being mischievous at times, often causing Tess great grief and trouble for Reed with his dad.\u00a0Regardless of their reputation though, they were TJ\u2019s best friends. Sure he had his basketball friends at school but he misses having Reed and Lester around during his daily schedule and is at time envious they get to go to school together, even if they wore dorky uniforms, although he\u2019d never admit that out loud.\u00a0</p><p>-</p><p>A day after the Jefferson Middle School\u2019s first basketball game of the season,\u00a0TJ is out front of The Red Rooster flipping through a rack of records whilst Reed and Lester were inside looking at others when he\u2019s approached by Buffy. Buffy very maturally tries to reason with TJ but he blows her off completely resulting in some heated words from Buffy before she storms off.</p><p>It\u2019s only a second later that Reed and Lester exit The Red Rooster and both catch a glimpse of Buffy as she storms away.</p><p>\u201cWhat was all that about?\u201d Reed questions. </p><p>\u201cThat was Buffy.\u201d TJ rolls his eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh damn.\u201d Lester laughs, \u201cShe is not what I was expecting.\u201d By now Reed had caught Lester up on the issue whilst they were at school together.</p><p>\u201cWe could hear her yelling at you from inside,\u201d Reed appears amused.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell she\u2019s officially on the team and officially a pain in the neck.\u201d TJ huffs.<br/></p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got personality,\u00a0I like her.\u201d Reed smirks.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Well you\u2019re both annoying so it\u2019s like a match made in heaven.\u201d TJ replies snippily and Lester laughs halfheartedly. </p><p>Reed chuckles through a sarcastic, \u201cOoo,\u201d before TJ rolls his eyes and walks away. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be like that.\u201d Reed says as he and Lester chase after TJ.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not taking my Buffy problem seriously.\u201d TJ folds his arms.<br/></p><p>\u201cIf you really don\u2019t want her on the team you\u2019re going to have to\u00a0convince her not to be.\u201d Reed says.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cHow am I supposed to do that?\u201d TJ asks.\u00a0\u201cI already told her to quit.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, don\u2019t pass her the ball?\u201d Reed suggests,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019ll quit eventually.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>-</p><p>A few weeks later TJ is shooting hoops at the court by his apartment building to let off some steam. After another failed algebra test he\u2019s being forced to start tutoring sessions with Buffy of all people.\u00a0TJ grumpily makes a shot, the ball connects with the edge of the hoop and bounces backwards.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd I thought you were supposed to be good at this?\u201d Reed catches the rebound, Lester is a step behind him chuckling.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m too angry.\u201d TJ huffs as he catches the ball Reed bounced back towards him.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s rubbing you the wrong way?\u201d Lester questions.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cMy stupid math teacher is making me get a tutor because I failed a couple of dumb tests.\u201d TJ folds his arms,\u00a0\u201cMaybe if he wasn\u2019t so boring I wouldn\u2019t fall asleep in his class and I\u2019d actually pass.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the unlucky student that gets to tutor you?\u201d Reed questions.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cDriscoll.\u201d TJ says with a look of distaste.</p><p>Reed stifles a laugh, \u201cNow I get the whole broody basketballer mood.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBuffy?\u201d Lester questions,\u00a0\u201cThat poor girl you\u2019ve been tormenting on your team?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not tormenting her.\u201d TJ looks offended.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s met you, that\u2019s\u00a0torture enough.\u201d Reed jokes and Lester playfully smacks his chest in amusement.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cMy charming personality doesn\u2019t seem to be enough to repel you two losers.\u201d TJ rolls his eyes before lobbing the basketball towards his friends. It hits them both on a shoulder each as they failed at their attempted swerves to dodge it.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just get a different student to tutor you?\u201d Lester questions.\u00a0<br/></p><p>TJ remains quiet about all the other tutors he\u2019s already gone through. He had been silent about his tutoring history until today.\u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s no one else.\u201d TJ shrugs.\u00a0\u201cMy teacher says it has to be Buffy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTough break.\u201d Reed coaxes his head,\u00a0\u201cYou want to go for a ride, maybe take your mind off of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t.\u201d TJ sighs,\u00a0\u201cI have to think of a way to get Buffy to agree to the stupid tutoring sessions so I\u2019m not kicked off the team.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cGood luck with that.\u201d Lester says with a grimace.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cKeep me posted.\u201d Reed gives TJ\u2019s shoulder a pat as they part ways.\u00a0<br/></p><p>-</p><p>The following afternoon TJ\u00a0walks into Lester\u2019s house after Lester\u2019s younger sister Kylie let\u2019s him in.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re in the basement.\u201d Kylie says with little emotion before leaving TJ on his own.</p><p>\u201cOkay thanks..\u201d TJ says to himself before he turns towards the basement and trots down the stairs. Lester\u2019s basement was a nice setup, it wasn\u2019t quite as flash as Reed\u2019s mansion of a home but Lester\u2019s living situation was definitely a good few steps up from TJ\u2019s tiny apparent he shared with his mom.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Lester greets TJ, he and Reed both sit on a couch in the middle of the basement.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d TJ says as he takes a seat in the free armchair adjacent to them both.\u00a0\u201cSo Buffy agreed to tutor me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you manage that?\u201d Lester questions.</p><p>\u201cI agreed to pass her the ball.\u201d TJ releases a defeated sigh. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d Reed laughs, \u201cShe has to teach your dumb ass and all you have to do is pass her the ball?\u201d </p><p>\u201cDude?\u201d TJ gives his friend an unamused look. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just kidding.\u201d Reed dismisses TJ\u2019s sensitivity towards the joke. </p><p>\u201cPassing her the ball is a gateway into her wanting to stay on the team.\u201d TJ folds his arms. </p><p>\u201cYeah but it also means that <i>you</i> get to stay on the team.\u201d Lester highlights.</p><p>\u201cYou guys were the ones that encouraged me to try and make her quit.\u201d TJ says defensively.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah but now you need her help with something so you have to adapt.\u201d Lester shrugs.<br/></p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d TJ sinks into the chair with a sulky expression.\u00a0\u201cThere was one other condition she had..\u201d TJ was mumbly as he said this but there was a hint of a smile that crossed his face.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Reed points a raised brow at TJ out of confusion more than curiosity.</p><p>\u201cShe made me get her friend a muffin.\u201d TJ says.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cLike buy a muffin?\u201d Reed tries to make sense of it all.<br/></p><p>\u201cNo, we have these muffins in the cafeteria he just always misses out on one.\u201d TJ explains.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t get his own muffin?\u201d Reed laughs.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat was my reaction,\u201d TJ laughs too but then softens,\u00a0\u201cI think he\u2019s just too polite to cut in line.<br/></p><p>\u201cSo you cut in and got him the muffin?\u201d Lester questions stoically, clearly not enthralled by the muffin tale.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cKind of,\u201d TJ shrugs,\u00a0\u201cI guess it doesn&rsquo;t really matter.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWell he got a muffin and you got yourself a tutor.\u201d Reed slaps his knee,\u00a0\u201cThings are looking up.\u201d<br/></p><p>-</p><p>TJ begins tutoring with Buffy and much like his behaviour with the past tutors he\u2019s burnt through, TJ shows her little respect, all to deflect from his struggles to actually make sense of what she\u2019s\u00a0saying.</p><p>In a strange twist of fate TJ winds up on the swings with Cyrus where the pair swing away their \u2018stuff\u2019. A nice moment is interrupted when Buffy finds them together and then suggests TJ might have a learning disability. TJ already thinking so little of himself, receives this poorly and storms off again.\u00a0</p><p>On his walk home, TJ bumps into Reed who was riding his push bike. Reed hops off and pushes his bike as he walks alongside TJ.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d TJ mumbles his greeting.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cHey..\u201d Reed furrows his brows at TJ\u2019s off mood.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d TJ asks with little effort to fake being interested in an actual answer.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cJust hanging out.\u201d Reed answers,\u00a0\u201c&hellip;Is something up, man?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cTutoring sucks and Buffy is the worst.\u201d TJ huffs.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat else is new?\u201d Reed forces a soft laugh to make light of things but it falls flat with TJ.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d TJ shrugs.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d Reed nods and the two walk in silence for a moment.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Finally TJ speaks up,\u00a0\u201cHey you remember when we were kids and we used to hang out at the park and we\u2019d do the underdog trick on the swings?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Reed looks like he was searching his memory vault before an uncertain kind of realisation crosses his face,\u00a0\u201cIs that where you duck under whilst the other one swings high?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s it.\u201d TJ says with a nod.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah, I remember, all the kids would do it.\u201d Reed smiles,\u00a0\u201cWow, I had totally forgotten about that.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d TJ smiles to himself.\u00a0\u201cUntil today..\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAny reason you bring it up now?\u201d Reed questions.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cNah.. Just thinking about it.\u201d TJ brushes it off, the swing session with Cyrus had made him feel better and he didn\u2019t want Reed making fun of it.<br/></p><p>\u201cOkay&hellip;\u201d Reed nods.\u00a0\u201cSo I have an idea about your Buffy problem.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d TJ questions.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cIf she\u2019s not working as your tutor, why don\u2019t you just get her to do your homework instead?\u201d Reed proposes.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cLike she\u2019d ever agree to that.\u201d TJ scoffs. \u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cFind a way to convince her..\u201d\u00a0</p><p>-</p><p>After Reed\u2019s suggestion, TJ - with Cyrus unknowingly assisting -\u00a0managed to convince Buffy to do his homework. Although it was his intent to not pass her the ball during the game his teammates started to turn against him and he had no choice.\u00a0</p><p>After the teams win, TJ lazes around his bedroom with Lester and Reed, snacks polluting the floor in front of the xbox set up.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Cyrus?\u201d Reed - who\u2019s over by the desk - asks.\u00a0<br/></p><p>TJ\u2019s attention snaps from the game up towards Reed as Cyrus\u2019s name was surprising to hear coming from present company.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d TJ asks with a confused expression.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cCyrus, he\u2019s invited you to his bar mitzvah?\u201d Reed waves the invite he had picked up from TJ\u2019s desk around.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cOh, he\u2019s Buffy\u2019s friend.\u201d TJ says casually.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cMuffin boy?\u201d Reed asks with an amused grin and Lester chuckles.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not call him that&hellip;\u201d TJ frowns.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cSo you and Cyrus are friends now?\u201d Lester questions.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah are we missing something?\u201d Reed presses,\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re not on good terms with Buffy - his<i> friend </i>- but muffin boy is inviting you to his birthday?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d TJ shrugs casually,\u00a0\u201cCyrus was actually the one who helped me solve my homework issue with Buffy.. Although he doesn\u2019t really know what part he played in that&hellip;\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIs the party going to be fun?\u201d Lester asks.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cThink you can get a couple of plus ones?\u201d Reed seconds the idea after picking up on what Lester was suggesting.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even know Cyrus and it\u2019s invite only.\u201d TJ shuts down the idea quickly.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cLame.\u201d Both Reed and Lester say in unison causing them all to chuckle.</p><p>-\u00a0</p><p>After Cyrus\u2019s crazy bar mitzvah party, TJ notifies his mom that he\u2019ll be staying at Reed\u2019s house as it was only a couple minute walk from the party venue. Once there, TJ walks past Reed\u2019s father Michael taking a business call in the kitchen, the two exchange a silent wave and TJ continues towards the theatre room knowing that\u2019s where he\u2019d find the guys. It was pretty late but not uncommon for Michael to still be working, after all, that is why TJ\u2019s\u00a0mother called off their engagement but TJ still had a wave of sympathy for his friend, although Reed avoids all sorts of family talk, TJ knew he was lonely at home.\u00a0</p><p>Once in the theatre room, TJ finds Lester has already fallen asleep on one of the reclining chairs but Reed was awake and watching a movie with the volume turned down low.</p><p>TJ sets himself down on the seat beside Reed and the boys lower their voices to whispers as TJ starts to share how great the party was. He left out details like the fortuneteller confirming his learning disability or Buffy roasting him but he did share a tale of Cyrus and some fancy apple cider.</p><p>-</p><p>After TJ\u2019s suspension from the team and some encouraging words from Cyrus he tells Mr. Coleman about his dyscalculia and his suspension is lifted. TJ also couldn\u2019t help himself and rubbed his good fortune in Buffy\u2019s face all the while he let slip about his manipulation into getting her to do his homework and coming clean about it got Buffy suspended instead which TJ was unapologetic for.\u00a0</p><p>As TJ preps for his first game back, Lester and Reed keep him company. TJ explains what had gone down, he even opened up about his dyscalculia with them which Reed and Lester quickly deduced they shouldn\u2019t give TJ a hard time about. TJ goes on to\u00a0express that he kind of felt bad for getting Buffy suspended too, she was moving away soon and he really ruined that for her. TJ also stressed that he felt guilty for saying something that would probably cause a fight between Cyrus and Buffy.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy do you care if they\u2019re fighting?\u201d Reed questions.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cJust because I don\u2019t like Buffy doesn\u2019t mean I need to go ruining her friendships with everyone else right before she moves away&hellip;\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>School has wrapped up for the day and TJ was surprised to find Lester and Reed waiting out front. The two were still dressed in their school uniforms and they explained that they had ditched last period, that was hard to do at their private school so TJ suspects they\u2019d both get in trouble for it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey, TJ!\u201d A voice calls from some distance away. TJ peels his gaze from his friends and points it over in the direction his name was called. TJ spots Jonah approaching at a quick paced walk with a basketball gripped in his hands, which was odd to TJ because Jonah was a frisbee boy.<br/></p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d Lester questions as it wasn\u2019t any of TJ\u2019s basketball friends that he and Reed had met before.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cIs that Cyrus?\u201d Reed asks.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s Jonah.\u201d TJ scrunches his face up.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Jonah?\u201d Reed wonders.\u00a0<br/></p><p>TJ hushes his friends just as Jonah reaches them.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m glad I caught you before you left.\u201d Jonah lets out a heavy breath as he was lightly puffed, he sends a shy smile to the two strangers TJ was with.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAh, hey..\u201d TJ gives him a weak smile, the only interaction they had had prior to this was during Jonah\u2019s\u00a0panic attack.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI brought this for you to sign.\u201d Jonah holds the basketball out for TJ.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou starting a fan club for the basketball team or something?\u201d TJ pricks up a brow.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Jonah laughs softly and endearingly says,\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s more Cyrus\u2019s thing.\u201d TJ could feel Reed\u2019s side stare burning holes in him but he pretends he doesn\u2019t notice and Jonah continues,\u00a0\u201cThe ball is for Buffy. I\u2019m helping Cyrus and Andi put together a time capsule full of Buffy\u2019s memories so she has something to take with her when she leaves, I thought it would be nice if she had a memento from the team. See,\u201d Jonah says twirling the ball in his hands,\u00a0\u201cthe whole team has signed- Well, the whole team excluding you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for Buffy.\u201d Reed says with a knowing look and it earns another shy smile from Jonah.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cIgnore him, that\u2019s what I usually do.\u201d TJ says with an exaggerated grin.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cSo, do you want to sign it?\u201d Jonah pulls a sharpie from his pocket and holds it out.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cAre you sure that\u2019s even a good idea?\u201d TJ questions,\u00a0\u201cBuffy isn\u2019t exactly my biggest fan.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cUnderstatement of the year&hellip;\u201d Jonah laughs nervously.\u00a0\u201cSigning could be like a grape vine to Buffy before she leaves, so things between you aren\u2019t on the worst of terms?\u201d Jonah suggests.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo you mean olive branch?\u201d Lester sports a confused look.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah but I hate olives.\u201d Jonah chuckles and both Lester and Reed exchange a perplexed expression, almost wanting to laugh at Jonah but it was so random they were at a loss for words.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you say?\u201d Jonah grins widely at TJ.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d TJ nods sheepishly and signs his name to the ball.\u00a0<br/></p><p>After Jonah leaves, Reed and Lester lightly tease TJ about signing the ball. Joking that he\u2019s gone soft and mushy. TJ shrugs it off and insists he\u2019s happy Buffy is leaving for good.</p><p>-</p><p>After Buffy moves away TJ found it easier to be Cyrus\u2019s friend. They\u2019d often chat in the halls at school and they\u2019d text a little. So when Cyrus had a problem with P.E. TJ was happy to jump at the chance to help.\u00a0</p><p>After the somersault victory, TJ and Cyrus part ways. TJ meets Lester and Reed at the movie theatre and before the previews began TJ was retelling the events of the day.\u00a0</p><p>Lester expressed an interest in seeing Cyrus\u2019s list of easy things he couldn\u2019t do but TJ refused knowing he and Reed only wanted to make fun of it. As a\u00a0\u2018boo hoo\u2019 to TJ for being no fun his friends start throwing popcorn at him, with both Lester and Reed on either side of him TJ got quite annoyed by this and snaps at his friends.\u00a0<br/><br/>\u201dCalm down, Kippen.\u201d Reed\u2019s laughter halts abruptly, a hint of annoyance in his tone,\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re just having some fun.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201dAt the expense of me.\u201d TJ grumbles.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay, well, we\u2019re not making fun of you.\u201d Reed scoffs.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cRight, you\u2019re just making fun of my friend.\u201d TJ looks away with an irritated expression.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cLighten up, TJ.\u201d Lester pats his friend on the shoulder,\u00a0\u201cWe were just messing around.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d TJ shrugs and the lights in the theatre dim as the previews begin,\u00a0\u201cI just don\u2019t appreciate you making fun of, underdog\u2019s list.\u201d TJ adds with a whisper.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cUnderdog?\u201d Lester questions and another movie goer shushes him.\u00a0<br/></p><p>The nickname wasn\u2019t something TJ avoided using around other people but in his present company it felt like a slip up.\u00a0\u201cJust a nickname,\u201d TJ shrugs it off quietly.\u00a0</p><p>Reed points a raised brow in TJ\u2019s direction although the cinemas was too dark for TJ to notice. Reed thought about TJ brining up the underdog swing game a few months back and questions if TJ\u2019s friendship with Cyrus was something more than he originally thought.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCute.\u201d Lester chuckles. \u00a0</p><p>The same movie goer from before speaks up again, this time louder, \u201cWould you kids quite down please?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cChill old man, the movie hasn\u2019t even started yet.\u201d Reed calls back and TJ gives him a firm shove in the arm to cut it out.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Reed asks defensively.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cJust stop.\u201d TJ keeps his voice low.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cAlright, mom.\u201d Reed laughs obnoxiously and other people in the theatre were starting to get annoyed too.\u00a0<br/></p><p>TJ bites his tongue although he really wanted to snap at Reed for saying that but TJ remains quiet because he knew Reed was purposely trying to stir him up. Reed knew TJ hated it when he called him mom, like he was being bossy or controlling which at times TJ would\u00a0have to be because Reed often got carried away.<br/></p><p>Another woman leans forward and she looks annoyed but politely asks them to stop talking as she was trying to watch the trailers. TJ felt embarrassed by his friends misbehaving apologises to the lady and assures her they\u2019ll stop. Reed seems annoyed by TJ and sulks back in his seat. They watched the movie quietly, the mood definitely off between them all.\u00a0</p><p>Once the end credits rolls they exit the theatre but the mood doesn\u2019t lighten up. Things still seemed tense, specifically between Reed and TJ but Lester wasn\u2019t at all oblivious to it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo, who wants to grab a bite to eat before we head back to mine?\u201d Lester speaks up as they walk.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI think I might just go\u00a0home.\u201d TJ kicks a rock as he passes it.<br/></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be playing the new video games I got for my birthday?\u201d Lester points out.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI just remembered I told my mom I\u2019d be home for dinner.\u201d TJ dips his hands into the pockets of his hoodie.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to hang out with us, TJ, you don\u2019t have to lie.\u201d Reed says almost casually.\u00a0\u201cYour mom is working tonight.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat, are you stalking her now or something?\u201d TJ retorts defensively.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cNo, she said so yesterday when I was over for dinner.\u201d Reed glares,\u00a0\u201cWhat, are you lying now or something?\u201d Reed mimics TJ\u2019s defensive tone.<br/></p><p>\u201cGuys, chill.\u201d Lester looks uncomfortable by the blow up.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault, Kippen is such a stick in the mud today.\u201d Reed rolls his eyes.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cHonestly, what is your problem, Reed?\u201d TJ stops in his tracks, annoyed by his friends attitude,\u00a0\u201cIs this because I told you to shut up during the previews?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah, actually it is.\u201d Reed scoffs,\u00a0\u201cBut it\u2019s not just today, you\u2019ve been constantly riding Lester and me every time we hang out.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Lester shifts uncomfortably on his feet,\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s not wrong, last weekend when we went bowling you were a bit of a buzz kill.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou guys were messing around in a different lane.\u201d TJ states.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Reed shrugs,\u00a0\u201cWe were just having a bit of fun.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWe got kicked out, just like I said we would.\u201d TJ sighs.<br/></p><p>\u201cWho cares?\u201d Reed still looks like he\u2019s in disbelief almost that TJ was arguing the way he was.\u00a0\u201cMaybe we took it a little too far but you\u2019ve done the exact same thing with us in the past.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d TJ folds his arms, \u201cIn the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo now we can\u2019t have fun anymore?\u201d Reed asks.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to be public nuisances to have fun.\u201d TJ states.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSee, stick in the mud.\u201d Reed looks to Lester as he motions to TJ.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI apologise for being self-aware.\u201d TJ says sarcastically.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll be sure to act like more of a jerk when I\u2019m around you so you know I\u2019m having fun.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing a great job right now.\u201d Reed smirks patronisingly.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cGrow up, Reed.\u201d TJ rolls his eyes.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cSorry we can\u2019t all be as mature and\u00a0\u2018self-aware\u2019 as you,\u201d Reed says in a mocking tone.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve changed ever since you started hanging out with your little boyfriend, Cyrus.\u201d Reed states.</p><p>\u201cDude, that\u2019s not a cool joke.\u201d Lester hits Reed\u2019s chest lightly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWho said I was joking?\u201d Reed holds TJ\u2019s eye contact as he said it and confusion registers on Lesters face as he reads TJ\u2019s hurt expression.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p><p>TJ wanted to drop everything and run away. Reed\u2019s comment basically outed TJ to Lester and that kind of betrayal - from Reed of all people - hurt TJ in a way that levelled with how it felt when TJ\u2019s dad left him and his mom.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou sound jealous.\u201d TJ tries to hold his own although the hurt he felt was written all over his face.<br/></p><p>\u201cOf muffin boy?\u201d Reed scoffs.\u00a0<br/></p><p>TJ wanted to say something just as hurtful back, he wanted to call Reed a clingy friend and throw his distant workaholic father in his face but he doesn\u2019t, instead he weakly says,\u00a0\u201cForget it. I\u2019m going home,\u201d before quickly making an exit.<br/></p><p>-\u00a0</p><p>The Monday morning following TJ and Reed\u2019s\u00a0big blowup, TJ is driven to school by his mother. Once parked, TJ remains in the passenger seat not wanting to get out. Tess tries to ask her son what is wrong but he insists everything is alright although he makes no effort to leave the car.\u00a0Even though Tess has to get to work she doesn\u2019t rush her son.</p><p>Out the windshield, TJ spots Cyrus standing out front of the school with Andi and more surprisingly, Buffy. Confusion hits TJ as Buffy had been gone for two months now. Then it was as if Cyrus had sensed TJ staring in their direction because he turned his head around and makes eye contact, sending a cheerful wave over in response. TJ sheepishly returns the gesture.</p><p>\u201cHe looks familiar.\u201d Tess says although she didn\u2019t know why he looked familiar.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my friend Cyrus.\u201d TJ says with a small smile.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh of course! You went to his bar mitzvah party,\u201d\u00a0Tess recalls, \u201cI\u00a0remember his face from the sweatshirt.\u201d Tess coos and TJ was suddenly feeling embarrassed. </p><p>\u201cWell I better get going, mom&hellip;\u201d TJ says picking up his backpack and Tess wishes her son a good day at school.</p><p>Cyrus is already approaching the vehicle when TJ closes the car door behind himself. </p><p>\u201cHey, TJ.\u201d Cyrus greets him enthusiastically and sends a happy wave to TJ\u2018s mother as she pulled out of her parking space. TJ can\u2019t help but smile at this as Cyrus had never even met his mother before but there he was waving like they were on a first name basis. </p><p>\u201cHey, underdog.\u201d he smiles and for a moment TJ had forgotten about his fight with Reed and the awful feeling it had left him with. \u201cCall me crazy but did I just see you standing with Buffy before?\u201d </p><p>\u201cShe surprised me and Andi yesterday, isn\u2019t that great?\u201d Cyrus beams.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d TJ laughs,\u00a0\u201cHow long is she here for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the best part,\u201d Cyrus bounces on his toes, bursting with excitement,\u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s back for good!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo way..\u201d TJ says in a state of disbelief and\u00a0just like that TJ\u2019s bad mood returned. Not because he didn\u2019t want Buffy to be here, TJ was actually happy for her and for Cyrus to have his friend back, TJ\u2019s mood was triggered by the idea that his friendship with Cyrus would have to revert back to the way it was before Buffy moved away which was still nice but harder for them as Buffy didn\u2019t approve of them hanging out. The idea that he might have lost Reed, Lester and Cyrus all in a couple of days was too much for TJ.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d Cyrus questions after noticing TJ&rsquo;s expression drop, \u201cI know Buffy isn\u2019t your best friend or anything but I thought you were past the whole hating her thing&hellip;\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that.\u201d TJ shakes his head, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>&quot;Ah hello, have you met me?\u201d Cyrus laughs,\u00a0\u201cWorrying is my specialty.\u00a0Do you want to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d TJ says honestly. What was he supposed to say to Cyrus?\u00a0<i>\u201cI had a fight with my best friends because they\u2019re whining about me being a better person?\u201d </i>Or<i> \u201cI\u2019m super upset because my closest friend outed me to our best friend and he did it by making a joke about you and me being boyfriends?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cI\u00a0can\u2019t force you to talk,\u201d Cyrus holds TJ\u2019s eye contact,\u00a0\u201cBut if you do want to, I\u2019m here.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>&quot;Thanks.\u201d TJ breaks their eye contact and goes mumbly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo did you want to come say hi to Buffy before homeroom?\u201d Cyrus tries to change the subject to make TJ more comfortable.<br/></p><p>\u201cDid you forget the part where she hates my guts?\u201d TJ laughs nervously.<br/></p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t hate you.\u201d\u00a0Cyrus says unconvincingly.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got a right to.\u201d TJ states.\u00a0\u201cI got her kicked off the team right before she moved away, among other things&hellip;\u201d </p><p>\u201cYour apology to time capsule Buffy was sincere. I know you\u2019re sorry.\u201d Cyrus says firmly,\u00a0\u201cMaybe it\u2019s time you express that to the real Buffy? </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s\u00a0is going to listen to me.\u201d TJ chews on the inside of his cheek anxiously.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIf she won&rsquo;t listen then you might have to show her instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going be a <i>great</i> sport during her first game back.\u201d\u00a0TJ nods in agreement.\u00a0 \u201cAll her games actually.\u201d TJ adds the last sentiment quickly and Cyrus smiles. TJ mirrors the grin and was quietly optimistic about the Cyrus side of his worries and that was enough to distract him from Reed and Lester for now.<br/></p><p>-</p><p>Since Buffy\u2019s return, her and TJ have finally made up, TJ would even go as far as calling her a friend now. That whole chapter of his life being over made TJ feel lighter now that he wasn\u2019t hiding behind the image he was previously trying to portray. The only thing bothering TJ these days was his distance with Reed and Lester. TJ hadn\u2019t spoken to either of the boys since their blowup out front of the movie theatre.\u00a0</p><p>TJ sits on the worn down bench by the basketball court near his apartment building. He\u2019s extra mopey about his strained friendship today as he knew Reed\u2019s birthday was tomorrow and the two of them along with Lester always spent it together, even if it was just something small after school.\u00a0TJ was just about to head inside when he spots Reed approaching and it takes him by surprise.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Reed says sheepishly as he nears.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d TJ questions and not in a hotheaded manner but a surprised one.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYour mom invited me over for dinner for an early birthday celebration&hellip;\u00a0\u201d Reed stops a few steps in front of where TJ sits,\u00a0\u201cI guess you haven\u2019t told her I was a jerk the last time we hung out..\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou showed up so I guess you didn\u2019t tell her either.\u201d TJ looks away as he speaks.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cTJ, I\u2019m<i> so </i>sorry.\u201d Reed says sincerely although it looked like he was struggling to actually form the words to say.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cFor which part?\u201d TJ asks.\u00a0\u201cFor making fun of my friend? For calling me boring or for practically outing me to Lester?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cFor all of it.\u201d Reed frowns,\u00a0\u201cEspecially the Lester part. That\u2019s the shittiest thing I have ever done in my entire life.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cNo argument here.\u201d TJ folds his arms and still avoids eye contact.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t purposely trying to out you,\u201d Reed says honestly,\u00a0\u201cBut that\u2019s exactly what I did and I am so sorry. I was trying to go for the thing I knew would hurt you most.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWell it worked.\u201d TJ mumbles.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cTJ, I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d Reed\u2019s frown deepens.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI want to know why you wanted to hurt me so bad?\u201d\u00a0TJ finally snaps his head back to Reed,\u00a0\u201cWas it because I don\u2019t want to be a public nuisance? Because I\u2019m trying to be better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou&rsquo;ve been my best friend for the longest time,\u201d Reed says,\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve been in the same sort of routine forever and it just felt like you were growing out it, out of me and Lester.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I think you and Lester are bad people?\u201d TJ furrows his brows.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Reed nods,\u00a0\u201cMaybe seeing you be more responsible made me insecure about myself&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoing what you did,<i>\u00a0outing me,</i>\u201d TJ wore a look of such pain on his face,\u00a0\u201cDoing that\u00a0for any reason is a really horrible thing to do, but doing it because you\u2019re angry I\u2019m being nicer? That\u2019s just- I don\u2019t even know.\u201d TJ lets out a frustrated breath.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Reed says firmly as he holds TJ\u2019s upset stare.\u00a0\u201cI wanted to hurt you because I was hurt. It\u2019s stupid and no excuse.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ furrows his brows,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry if I made you feel like I was trying to act better than you or something-\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTJ, please do not apologise.\u201d Reed holds his palms out to stop TJ.\u00a0\u201cI was upset because I was jealous. You said it yourself,\u201d Reed grows sheepish,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m jealous of muffin boy,\u201d Reed watches TJ\u2019s unimpressed expression so he softens and corrects himself, \u201cI was jealous of Cyrus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d TJ seems lightly confused. <br/></p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re supposed to be <i>my</i> best friend.\u201d Reed says and feels dorky for it,\u00a0\u201cI mean I knew you were changing, I could see it, like how happy you were about passing your math test last month, just little things like that. I didn\u2019t really understand why but I knew Cyrus had something to do with it and at the movies I just snapped. It felt like I was being replaced or something..\u201d Reed lets out a nervous laugh.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cReed?\u201d TJ coaxes his head like he couldn\u2019t believe his friend felt that way.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing, I know.\u201d Reed shakes his head.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d TJ says nicely before admitting,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve always been jealous that you and Lester go to the same school. I\u2019v always felt left out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Reed seems surprised and TJ nods.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u00a0\u201cI like Cyrus. He\u2019s a good person and was great friend to me when I didn\u2019t deserve it but you\u2019re my best friend, Reed, you and Lester.\u201d TJ says firmly,\u00a0\u201cIt was you that came over my house everyday for three months after my dad left, it was you that took the blame when I broke my moms crystal vase playing basketball in the house. It\u2019s always been us, you me and Lester. We even went through chicken pox together, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLester wanted to call us the pox pals.\u201d Reed laughs quietly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt was lame.\u201d TJ shakes his head with a laugh.\u00a0\u201cYou, me and Lester have always been best friends but you and me? Reed we were quite literally almost brothers&hellip; How could you ever think I was replacing you?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Reed just shrugs,\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou were the first and only person I told about being gay.\u201d TJ grows vulnerable again.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cAnd I went and broke your trust.\u201d Reed hates himself.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m awful, I know.\u00a0I\u2019ve been beating myself up about it this whole time, I\u2019ve been too embarrassed to come over and apologise.\u201d Reed says,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m been scared you\u2019d not even speak to me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat made you come over now?\u201d TJ questions.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI was hungry.\u201d Reed shrugs jokingly and TJ lets a laugh slip.\u00a0\u201cDo you ever think you\u2019ll be able to forgive me?\u201d Reed softens when he questions.</p><p>\u201cYou really hurt me.\u201d TJ says,\u00a0\u201cBut not being friends this whole time hurt me just as much&hellip; So yeah, I think I can forgive you.\u201d<br/></p><p>Reed looks relieved and his mouth curls into a smile.\u00a0\u201cSo I can stay for dinner?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ rolls his head forward with a laugh,\u00a0\u201cYes you can stay for dinner.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>So the trust might take a little while to build back up but for the most part TJ was happy to mend things with Reed.\u00a0</p><p>A day after reconciling with Reed, TJ spoke to Lester whom was unsure how to approach things after the incident at the theatre. Reed had also been avoiding Lester in that time as he didn\u2019t want to discuss TJ\u2019s sexuality anymore than he already did when he made the backhanded comment that outed him. So understandably, Lester was confused about everything and unsure if he should say something to TJ or not.\u00a0</p><p>TJ officially comes out to Lester and the older boys is really supportive and it brings the two closer together. The fight between TJ and Reed might have been unwarranted and horrible but it did bring the three friends closer together whilst adding a new level of maturity to their friendship. The boys used to avoid the in-depth talks about their feelings and what not but now it was more of an open and safe space to share what\u2019s on each other their minds.</p><p>-</p><p>A few months later summer is a few days from ending and TJ is out biking with Reed and Lester. By now TJ and Reed\u2019s friendship was completely mended and their strained trust issues were in the past.\u00a0</p><p>The three of them are having a water break when Reed pulls out his phone and shows TJ and Lester a video his cousin had sent him of someone shooting a watermelon in slow motion. The two others express how \u2018cool\u2019 it look when it exploded but TJ\u2019s attention fades quickly after he notices he has a notification on his phone from Buffy. \u00a0Whilst Lester and Reed are watching the video again TJ opens a snapchat from Buffy where Cyrus is present in the background speaking in his ridiculous fake British accent,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m actually going to commit murder in a second.\u201d Buffy says and the snap ends with Cyrus\u2019s frowning. TJ chuckles to himself and Reed and Lester give him a look like they want an explanation.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCyrus got back from London last night and he\u2019s been using this terrible fake British accent and it\u2019s driving Buffy insane.\u201d TJ laughs.\u00a0\u201cWhich is strangely still satisfying for me even though we\u2019re all friends now.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cGive us a listen then?\u201d Reed motions with his hand.\u00a0<br/></p><p>TJ goes into his text thread with Cyrus and opens the video Cyrus had sent to all his friends last night informing them he had landed. TJ was the only person that expressed how funny he found the accent so Cyrus had sent more video messages since, thus meaning TJ\u00a0had a few to show to Reed and Lester who also seem to find it amusing.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s definitely funny but I&rsquo;m with Buffy, I\u2019d probably snap too if he was speaking like that constantly.\u201d Lester chuckles.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo Cyrus is a funny guy?\u201d Reed questions.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s hilarious.\u201d TJ says with a lot of enthusiasm.\u00a0\u201cBut he\u2019s like funny without trying to be funny kind of funny, you know?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>&quot;Totally.\u201d Reed says with a smirk resting on his face.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d TJ asks defensively.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not looking at you like anything.\u201d Reed says with a cute shrug and he and Lester exchange a knowing glance with one another.\u00a0<br/></p><p>TJ shyly puts his phone away and Reed nudges him with his elbow before saying,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry for being a jerk about you changing. I like this TJ, you\u2019re happier.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Even thought that was a really wonderful thing for TJ to hear and they had gotten better at the sappy talks, unexpected kind declarations were still a little hard to accept so TJ clears his throat and suggests they get back to biking.\u00a0</p><p>-</p><p>Final bell for the day had rung and TJ was hanging out front of school with Lester and Reed when their conversation is interrupted by TJ\u2019s phone ringing. TJ smiles at Cyrus\u2019s caller I.D. and steps to the side to answer it. </p><p>\u201cHey, underdog.\u201d TJ greets him happily, \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI was calling to ask if you wanted to maybe help me hang posters for Buffy\u2019s \u00a0tryouts?\u201d Cyrus asks, \u201cIf you\u2019ve left already that\u2019s-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help.\u201d TJ cuts in. \u201cWhere are you now?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m walking out of the library, I just finished copying a few of the smaller posters. Ow, ow..\u201d Cyrus winces. </p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d TJ lets out a nervous chuckle. </p><p>\u201cDance class has left me with immense muscle pain.\u201d Cyrus complains. </p><p>\u201cSince when are you in dance class?\u201d TJ questions. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story, I was failing P.E. and needed an alternative but I think I\u2019ve made a mistake.\u201d Cyrus frowns to himself. </p><p>\u201cYou could have come to me for help before dropping P.E.\u201d TJ states. </p><p>\u201cYou any good at dancing?\u201d Cyrus asks. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re on your own there.\u201d TJ laughs and Cyrus does too. </p><p>\u201cOuch, don\u2019t make me laugh, it hurts.\u201d Cyrus says. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll meet you by admin in a second.\u201d TJ says with a smile before hanging up. </p><p>\u201cSo, what was that about?\u201d Reed asks with a smirk and TJ hadn\u2019t realised his two friends were watching him the whole time. </p><p>\u201cSo I have to go help hang posters for Buffy\u2019s basketball tryouts.\u201d TJ awkwardly announces to Lester and Reed. </p><p>\u201cUm weren\u2019t we supposed to hang out?\u201d Reed questions. </p><p>\u201cWe would have only been doing nothing at my house.\u201d TJ shrugs his shoulder, \u201cI\u2019m still trying to make amends with Buffy.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSure&hellip; You\u2019re ditching us for, Buffy.\u201d Reed folds his arms knowingly. \u201cSo that was Buffy on the phone asking for help?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not mad at me for ditching are you?\u201d TJ asks seriously.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cAdmit you have a crush on Cyrus and I\u2019ll let it go.\u201d Reed lowers his voice and smirks.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d TJ laughs nervously,\u00a0\u201cI do not..\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cTJ, who are you kidding?\u201d Lester coaxes his head with a smile.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cIs it that obvious?\u201d TJ frowns.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah only for like the entire summer.\u201d Lester chuckles.\u00a0\u201cCyrus did this in London, Cyrus did that\u201d he playfully imitates.<br/></p><p>TJ pouts huffily.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou better go, I\u2019d hate for you to keep underdog waiting.\u201d Reed smirks.\u00a0</p><p>TJ frowns knowing this was a whole new thing for them to tease him about, even in a friendly way. TJ was just upset because it meant he finally had to address his feelings for Cyrus out loud.\u00a0</p><p>-\u00a0</p><p>A couple weeks later the three boys were lying around Lester\u2019s basement enjoying the air conditioning on this hot day. They were all being social, just not with each other. Each of the teens sat on their phones. TJ texts Cyrus back and forth about his canoeing escapades, laughing out loud with every new message.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou going to let us in on the joke?\u201d Reed grumbles.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d TJ peels his stare away from his phone for a moment.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cDude you\u2019ve been giggling for the last twenty minutes.\u201d Reed says.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI have not been- <i>giggling.</i>\u201d TJ says defensively but with a hint of embarrassment.\u00a0</p><p>&quot;Let me guess, it\u2019s Cyrus?\u201d Reed asks knowingly and Lester smiles knowing he was right.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHe&rsquo;s canoeing.\u201d TJ shrugs one shoulder.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cSo are we ever going to meet Cyrus?\u201d Reed questions.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou talk about him enough, I feel like we know him.\u201d Lester adds.\u00a0\u201cWe even helped eat the muffins he baked you last week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still not happy about that.\u201d TJ frowns.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI am, they were delicious.\u201d Reed laughs as he pats his stomach,\u00a0\u201cBlueberry macadamia, who would\u2019ve thought?\u201d<br/></p><p>TJ shakes his head with a smile.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBut seriously,\u201d Reed says,\u00a0\u201cWhen are we going to meet Cyrus?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d TJ folds his arms.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Reed looks offended.\u00a0\u201cAre you embarrassed by us or something?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d TJ pops the P.\u00a0\u201cI know one of you will say something teasingly to me and Cyrus will get suspicious about my feelings and then never talk to me again.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a little dramatic.\u201d Lester laughs.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIs it though?\u201d TJ asks seriously\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cCome on, TJ?\u201d Reed pouts his bottom lip.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d TJ lets out a defeated breath,\u00a0\u201cBut you guys have to promise you\u2019ll be on your best behaviour?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be a couple of saints.\u201d Reed exaggerates an innocent smile.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll ask him to hang out on Saturday..\u201d TJ nods still a little reluctantly,\u00a0\u201cAny ideas on what we should do?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cDoes Cyrus like dirt biking?\u201d Lester questions.\u00a0<br/></p><p>TJ tosses his head from side to side,\u00a0\u201cProbably not&hellip;\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do that anyway.\u201d Reed insists,\u00a0\u201cIt will totally make you look cool in front of him.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah cause I totally care about that.\u201d TJ says in a mocking way and folds his arms and\u00a0Lester and Reed wear amused expressions.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo dirt biking on Saturday?\u201d Reed smirks.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d TJ lets out a heavy sigh knowing they both see right through him.\u00a0<br/></p>",

TJ lets\u00a0himself into his apartment knowing his mom wouldn\u2019t be home. TJ sets his backpack down on the kitchen counter and picks up the little post-it note left on the edge in a clearly visible spot so TJ would notice it once he arrived. The note reads;</p><p><i>\u2018Working late tonight but can\u2019t wait to hear about tryouts in the morning. There\u2019s a plate of dinner for you to heat up in the fridge,\u00a0</i><i>love mom\u2019</i>.\u00a0</p><p>TJ smiles to himself for a moment that she always signs her notes off with \u2018mom\u2019 even though it was just the two of them and therefore no one else to mistake as the sender of the note.\u00a0</p><p>With a hand on his stomach, TJ wanders over to the refrigerator to have a look at what was on the menu for the evening. TJ is disappointed to find a half eaten plate of meatloaf and mashed potatoes. The basketball captain lets out a heavy sigh and calls out loudly,\u00a0\u201cReed, are you here?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIn your room.\u201d His voice bellows from down the hall.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cDid you eat half of my dinner?\u201d TJ grumpily closes the fridge and sulks down the hall towards his room.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI was hungry.\u201d Reed chuckles.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cDude?\u201d TJ gives him an unimpressed look once he reaches his bedroom door. The younger blonde is sitting on TJ\u2019s floor, his gaze focused on the small TV set as he plays the xbox hooked up to it.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201c<i>Dude.</i>\u201d Reed mimics TJ\u2019s tone.\u00a0\u201cI left you half.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cGee thanks, Reed, that\u2019s so generous of you to leave me half of my own dinner.\u201d TJ says sarcastically.\u00a0<br></p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Reed jokes.<br></p><p>\u201cYou know my mom gave you that key for emergencies?\u201d TJ scoffs as he still hovers in the doorway.<br></p><p>\u201cI was bored,\u201d Reed says as he sits the game controller in his lap and finally meets TJ\u2019s gaze,\u00a0\u201cThat seemed like an emergency to me.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have anyone else you can annoy?\u201d TJ exaggerates an eye roll.\u00a0\u201cLike Lester?\u201d<br></p><p>Reed smirks,\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s grounded.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d he do this time?\u201d TJ asks with no inkling of surprise about his friends punishment.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know.\u201d Reed offers up a shrug with a light laugh.\u00a0\u201cWant next round?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>TJ thinks about the math homework he had been avoiding for two days and is conflicted for a second before ultimately accepting the controller and taking a seat beside Reed on the floor. The two sit with their backs resting against TJ\u2019s bed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou seem extra stressy today.\u201d Reed readjusts his position to a comfier one now that he was viewing the game instead of playing.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI had tryouts today for the team.\u201d TJ shakes his head at his friend.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOh crap, I completely forgot.\u201d Reed laughs.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t concerned at how long it took me to get home from school?\u201d TJ asks rhetorically.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d tryouts go, captain?\u201d Reed mockingly salutes TJ to which the taller boy elbows him in response, all the while keeping his eyes fixated on his small television screen as he plays his turn.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cEveryone is pretty hopeless,\u201d TJ grunts,\u00a0\u201cAnd get this right, a <i>girl </i>tried out for the team.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhy would she try out for the boys basketball team?\u201d Reed scrunches his face in confusion.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cJefferson doesn\u2019t have a girls team.\u201d TJ explains.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWas she any good?\u201d Reed questions.<br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s besides the point.\u201d TJ lets out a frustrated breath once he loses his turn.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Reed reclaims the controller for another go.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a girl.\u201d TJ offers up weakly.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou scared she\u2019s going to be better than you?\u201d Reed teases.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAs if.\u201d TJ rolls his eyes but there was some truth behind Reed\u2019s quip.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s just embarrassing having a girl on the team.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNot if she\u2019s good.\u201d Reed says.<br></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I just don\u2019t want her on the team.\u201d TJ says huffily knowing he had no real basis for his argument.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIs she cute?\u201d Reed asks.\u00a0\u201cSorry dumb question,\u201d He adds with a laugh.\u00a0\u201cI forgot you don\u2019t exactly care about that kind of thing.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou know that\u2019s not how it works right?\u201d TJ frowns.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Reed says a little nicer.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t told anyone, have you?\u201d TJ asks quietly.\u00a0\u201cNot even Lester?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d Reed says firmly and he puts his controller down to look at TJ so he knew he was being genuine,\u00a0\u201cI told you, I got your back no matter what.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>TJ nods slightly and shakes off the heaviness of the moment. \u201cMy turn.\u201d TJ changes the subject as\u00a0the pair were very rarely in-depth feelings sharing kind of friends and their discussion about TJ maybe being gay a few weeks ago had filled their sappy talk quota for a while.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Reed gives up the controller.\u00a0\u201cHey, you got any savings from the gym?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cA little why?\u201d TJ questions.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cTo order pizza.\u201d Reed says with a cheesy grin.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhat about half of my meatloaf you already ate?\u201d TJ asks.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIt was not good, that\u2019s why I only ate half.\u201d Reed holds back his laugh.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to tell my mom you said that.\u201d TJ laughs.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t believe you.\u201d Reed says confidently,\u00a0\u201cTess loves me.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s only because she doesn\u2019t know half of the crap you get up to these days.\u201d TJ scoffs.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHey, what our parents don\u2019t know won\u2019t kill them.\u201d Reed smirks devilishly.\u00a0<br></p><p>TJ quickly comes to terms with the fact that he\u2019d have to use part of his latest paycheck for pizza as Reed was unlikely to let the idea go. TJ jokes that for a rich boy, Reed is often spending TJ\u2019s hard earned money to to which Reed rolls his eyes and assures TJ he\u2019s good for it.</p><p>Reed was TJ\u2019s oldest friend.The two met when TJ was nine and Reed was eight. TJ had just started to get into dirt biking and they met at a popular riding spot. Reed had been doing it since he was much younger and was a great help for the beginner. The two were fast friends and have only gotten closer since. In fact, there was one point in time where the two almost became stepbrothers. TJ\u2019s mom, Tess was engaged to Reed\u2019s dad, Michael but she called it off because Michael\u2019s all consuming work schedule was a really big issue within their relationship. Michael became quite bitter about the breakup and for sometime after he banned Reed from seeing TJ but thankfully he eventually dropped his anger towards TJ and let his son see him again. Although her relationship ended with his father, Tess is still quite motherly to Reed, hence the spare key and complete comfort Reed feels being in their apartment alone.</p><p>Shortly after they first connected, Reed introduced TJ to Lester whom he knew from school. Both Lester and Reed go to Lincoln Academy which is a private school across town, one that goes from kindergarten right through until high school. Upon introducing Lester to TJ, the three instantly clicked as a group. Lester tends to be the quietest of the three even though\u00a0he\u2019s the oldest, he\u2019s shy around new people but when it came to TJ and Reed he showed a lot more personality. The three earn a reputation as being mischievous at times, often causing Tess great grief and trouble for Reed with his dad.\u00a0Regardless of their reputation though, they were TJ\u2019s best friends. Sure he had his basketball friends at school but he misses having Reed and Lester around during his daily schedule and is at time envious they get to go to school together, even if they wore dorky uniforms, although he\u2019d never admit that out loud.\u00a0</p><p>-</p><p>A day after the Jefferson Middle School\u2019s first basketball game of the season,\u00a0TJ is out front of The Red Rooster flipping through a rack of records whilst Reed and Lester were inside looking at others when he\u2019s approached by Buffy. Buffy very maturally tries to reason with TJ but he blows her off completely resulting in some heated words from Buffy before she storms off.</p><p>It\u2019s only a second later that Reed and Lester exit The Red Rooster and both catch a glimpse of Buffy as she storms away.</p><p>\u201cWhat was all that about?\u201d Reed questions. </p><p>\u201cThat was Buffy.\u201d TJ rolls his eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh damn.\u201d Lester laughs, \u201cShe is not what I was expecting.\u201d By now Reed had caught Lester up on the issue whilst they were at school together.</p><p>\u201cWe could hear her yelling at you from inside,\u201d Reed appears amused.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell she\u2019s officially on the team and officially a pain in the neck.\u201d TJ huffs.<br></p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got personality,\u00a0I like her.\u201d Reed smirks.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell you\u2019re both annoying so it\u2019s like a match made in heaven.\u201d TJ replies snippily and Lester laughs halfheartedly. </p><p>Reed chuckles through a sarcastic, \u201cOoo,\u201d before TJ rolls his eyes and walks away. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be like that.\u201d Reed says as he and Lester chase after TJ.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not taking my Buffy problem seriously.\u201d TJ folds his arms.<br></p><p>\u201cIf you really don\u2019t want her on the team you\u2019re going to have to\u00a0convince her not to be.\u201d Reed says.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHow am I supposed to do that?\u201d TJ asks.\u00a0\u201cI already told her to quit.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, don\u2019t pass her the ball?\u201d Reed suggests,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019ll quit eventually.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>-</p><p>A few weeks later TJ is shooting hoops at the court by his apartment building to let off some steam. After another failed algebra test he\u2019s being forced to start tutoring sessions with Buffy of all people.\u00a0TJ grumpily makes a shot, the ball connects with the edge of the hoop and bounces backwards.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd I thought you were supposed to be good at this?\u201d Reed catches the rebound, Lester is a step behind him chuckling.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m too angry.\u201d TJ huffs as he catches the ball Reed bounced back towards him.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s rubbing you the wrong way?\u201d Lester questions.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cMy stupid math teacher is making me get a tutor because I failed a couple of dumb tests.\u201d TJ folds his arms,\u00a0\u201cMaybe if he wasn\u2019t so boring I wouldn\u2019t fall asleep in his class and I\u2019d actually pass.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the unlucky student that gets to tutor you?\u201d Reed questions.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cDriscoll.\u201d TJ says with a look of distaste.</p><p>Reed stifles a laugh, \u201cNow I get the whole broody basketballer mood.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBuffy?\u201d Lester questions,\u00a0\u201cThat poor girl you\u2019ve been tormenting on your team?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not tormenting her.\u201d TJ looks offended.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s met you, that\u2019s\u00a0torture enough.\u201d Reed jokes and Lester playfully smacks his chest in amusement.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cMy charming personality doesn\u2019t seem to be enough to repel you two losers.\u201d TJ rolls his eyes before lobbing the basketball towards his friends. It hits them both on a shoulder each as they failed at their attempted swerves to dodge it.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just get a different student to tutor you?\u201d Lester questions.\u00a0<br></p><p>TJ remains quiet about all the other tutors he\u2019s already gone through. He had been silent about his tutoring history until today.\u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s no one else.\u201d TJ shrugs.\u00a0\u201cMy teacher says it has to be Buffy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTough break.\u201d Reed coaxes his head,\u00a0\u201cYou want to go for a ride, maybe take your mind off of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t.\u201d TJ sighs,\u00a0\u201cI have to think of a way to get Buffy to agree to the stupid tutoring sessions so I\u2019m not kicked off the team.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cGood luck with that.\u201d Lester says with a grimace.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cKeep me posted.\u201d Reed gives TJ\u2019s shoulder a pat as they part ways.\u00a0<br></p><p>-</p><p>The following afternoon TJ\u00a0walks into Lester\u2019s house after Lester\u2019s younger sister Kylie let\u2019s him in.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re in the basement.\u201d Kylie says with little emotion before leaving TJ on his own.</p><p>\u201cOkay thanks..\u201d TJ says to himself before he turns towards the basement and trots down the stairs. Lester\u2019s basement was a nice setup, it wasn\u2019t quite as flash as Reed\u2019s mansion of a home but Lester\u2019s living situation was definitely a good few steps up from TJ\u2019s tiny apparent he shared with his mom.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Lester greets TJ, he and Reed both sit on a couch in the middle of the basement.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d TJ says as he takes a seat in the free armchair adjacent to them both.\u00a0\u201cSo Buffy agreed to tutor me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you manage that?\u201d Lester questions.</p><p>\u201cI agreed to pass her the ball.\u201d TJ releases a defeated sigh. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d Reed laughs, \u201cShe has to teach your dumb ass and all you have to do is pass her the ball?\u201d </p><p>\u201cDude?\u201d TJ gives his friend an unamused look. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just kidding.\u201d Reed dismisses TJ\u2019s sensitivity towards the joke. </p><p>\u201cPassing her the ball is a gateway into her wanting to stay on the team.\u201d TJ folds his arms. </p><p>\u201cYeah but it also means that <i>you</i> get to stay on the team.\u201d Lester highlights.</p><p>\u201cYou guys were the ones that encouraged me to try and make her quit.\u201d TJ says defensively.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah but now you need her help with something so you have to adapt.\u201d Lester shrugs.<br></p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d TJ sinks into the chair with a sulky expression.\u00a0\u201cThere was one other condition she had..\u201d TJ was mumbly as he said this but there was a hint of a smile that crossed his face.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Reed points a raised brow at TJ out of confusion more than curiosity.</p><p>\u201cShe made me get her friend a muffin.\u201d TJ says.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cLike buy a muffin?\u201d Reed tries to make sense of it all.<br></p><p>\u201cNo, we have these muffins in the cafeteria he just always misses out on one.\u201d TJ explains.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t get his own muffin?\u201d Reed laughs.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat was my reaction,\u201d TJ laughs too but then softens,\u00a0\u201cI think he\u2019s just too polite to cut in line.<br></p><p>\u201cSo you cut in and got him the muffin?\u201d Lester questions stoically, clearly not enthralled by the muffin tale.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cKind of,\u201d TJ shrugs,\u00a0\u201cI guess it doesn\u2019t really matter.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWell he got a muffin and you got yourself a tutor.\u201d Reed slaps his knee,\u00a0\u201cThings are looking up.\u201d<br></p><p>-</p><p>TJ begins tutoring with Buffy and much like his behaviour with the past tutors he\u2019s burnt through, TJ shows her little respect, all to deflect from his struggles to actually make sense of what she\u2019s\u00a0saying.</p><p>In a strange twist of fate TJ winds up on the swings with Cyrus where the pair swing away their \u2018stuff\u2019. A nice moment is interrupted when Buffy finds them together and then suggests TJ might have a learning disability. TJ already thinking so little of himself, receives this poorly and storms off again.\u00a0</p><p>On his walk home, TJ bumps into Reed who was riding his push bike. Reed hops off and pushes his bike as he walks alongside TJ.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d TJ mumbles his greeting.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHey..\u201d Reed furrows his brows at TJ\u2019s off mood.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d TJ asks with little effort to fake being interested in an actual answer.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cJust hanging out.\u201d Reed answers,\u00a0\u201c\u2026Is something up, man?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cTutoring sucks and Buffy is the worst.\u201d TJ huffs.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat else is new?\u201d Reed forces a soft laugh to make light of things but it falls flat with TJ.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d TJ shrugs.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d Reed nods and the two walk in silence for a moment.\u00a0<br></p><p>Finally TJ speaks up,\u00a0\u201cHey you remember when we were kids and we used to hang out at the park and we\u2019d do the underdog trick on the swings?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Reed looks like he was searching his memory vault before an uncertain kind of realisation crosses his face,\u00a0\u201cIs that where you duck under whilst the other one swings high?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s it.\u201d TJ says with a nod.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, I remember, all the kids would do it.\u201d Reed smiles,\u00a0\u201cWow, I had totally forgotten about that.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d TJ smiles to himself.\u00a0\u201cUntil today..\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAny reason you bring it up now?\u201d Reed questions.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNah.. Just thinking about it.\u201d TJ brushes it off, the swing session with Cyrus had made him feel better and he didn\u2019t want Reed making fun of it.<br></p><p>\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d Reed nods.\u00a0\u201cSo I have an idea about your Buffy problem.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d TJ questions.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIf she\u2019s not working as your tutor, why don\u2019t you just get her to do your homework instead?\u201d Reed proposes.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cLike she\u2019d ever agree to that.\u201d TJ scoffs. \u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cFind a way to convince her..\u201d\u00a0</p><p>-</p><p>After Reed\u2019s suggestion, TJ - with Cyrus unknowingly assisting -\u00a0managed to convince Buffy to do his homework. Although it was his intent to not pass her the ball during the game his teammates started to turn against him and he had no choice.\u00a0</p><p>After the teams win, TJ lazes around his bedroom with Lester and Reed, snacks polluting the floor in front of the xbox set up.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Cyrus?\u201d Reed - who\u2019s over by the desk - asks.\u00a0<br></p><p>TJ\u2019s attention snaps from the game up towards Reed as Cyrus\u2019s name was surprising to hear coming from present company.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d TJ asks with a confused expression.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cCyrus, he\u2019s invited you to his bar mitzvah?\u201d Reed waves the invite he had picked up from TJ\u2019s desk around.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOh, he\u2019s Buffy\u2019s friend.\u201d TJ says casually.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cMuffin boy?\u201d Reed asks with an amused grin and Lester chuckles.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not call him that\u2026\u201d TJ frowns.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cSo you and Cyrus are friends now?\u201d Lester questions.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah are we missing something?\u201d Reed presses,\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re not on good terms with Buffy - his<i> friend </i>- but muffin boy is inviting you to his birthday?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d TJ shrugs casually,\u00a0\u201cCyrus was actually the one who helped me solve my homework issue with Buffy.. Although he doesn\u2019t really know what part he played in that\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIs the party going to be fun?\u201d Lester asks.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThink you can get a couple of plus ones?\u201d Reed seconds the idea after picking up on what Lester was suggesting.<br></p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even know Cyrus and it\u2019s invite only.\u201d TJ shuts down the idea quickly.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cLame.\u201d Both Reed and Lester say in unison causing them all to chuckle.</p><p>-\u00a0</p><p>After Cyrus\u2019s crazy bar mitzvah party, TJ notifies his mom that he\u2019ll be staying at Reed\u2019s house as it was only a couple minute walk from the party venue. Once there, TJ walks past Reed\u2019s father Michael taking a business call in the kitchen, the two exchange a silent wave and TJ continues towards the theatre room knowing that\u2019s where he\u2019d find the guys. It was pretty late but not uncommon for Michael to still be working, after all, that is why TJ\u2019s\u00a0mother called off their engagement but TJ still had a wave of sympathy for his friend, although Reed avoids all sorts of family talk, TJ knew he was lonely at home.\u00a0</p><p>Once in the theatre room, TJ finds Lester has already fallen asleep on one of the reclining chairs but Reed was awake and watching a movie with the volume turned down low.</p><p>TJ sets himself down on the seat beside Reed and the boys lower their voices to whispers as TJ starts to share how great the party was. He left out details like the fortuneteller confirming his learning disability or Buffy roasting him but he did share a tale of Cyrus and some fancy apple cider.</p><p>-</p><p>After TJ\u2019s suspension from the team and some encouraging words from Cyrus he tells Mr. Coleman about his dyscalculia and his suspension is lifted. TJ also couldn\u2019t help himself and rubbed his good fortune in Buffy\u2019s face all the while he let slip about his manipulation into getting her to do his homework and coming clean about it got Buffy suspended instead which TJ was unapologetic for.\u00a0</p><p>As TJ preps for his first game back, Lester and Reed keep him company. TJ explains what had gone down, he even opened up about his dyscalculia with them which Reed and Lester quickly deduced they shouldn\u2019t give TJ a hard time about. TJ goes on to\u00a0express that he kind of felt bad for getting Buffy suspended too, she was moving away soon and he really ruined that for her. TJ also stressed that he felt guilty for saying something that would probably cause a fight between Cyrus and Buffy.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy do you care if they\u2019re fighting?\u201d Reed questions.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cJust because I don\u2019t like Buffy doesn\u2019t mean I need to go ruining her friendships with everyone else right before she moves away\u2026\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>School has wrapped up for the day and TJ was surprised to find Lester and Reed waiting out front. The two were still dressed in their school uniforms and they explained that they had ditched last period, that was hard to do at their private school so TJ suspects they\u2019d both get in trouble for it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey, TJ!\u201d A voice calls from some distance away. TJ peels his gaze from his friends and points it over in the direction his name was called. TJ spots Jonah approaching at a quick paced walk with a basketball gripped in his hands, which was odd to TJ because Jonah was a frisbee boy.<br></p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d Lester questions as it wasn\u2019t any of TJ\u2019s basketball friends that he and Reed had met before.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIs that Cyrus?\u201d Reed asks.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s Jonah.\u201d TJ scrunches his face up.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Jonah?\u201d Reed wonders.\u00a0<br></p><p>TJ hushes his friends just as Jonah reaches them.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m glad I caught you before you left.\u201d Jonah lets out a heavy breath as he was lightly puffed, he sends a shy smile to the two strangers TJ was with.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAh, hey..\u201d TJ gives him a weak smile, the only interaction they had had prior to this was during Jonah\u2019s\u00a0panic attack.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI brought this for you to sign.\u201d Jonah holds the basketball out for TJ.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou starting a fan club for the basketball team or something?\u201d TJ pricks up a brow.\u00a0<br></p><p>Jonah laughs softly and endearingly says,\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s more Cyrus\u2019s thing.\u201d TJ could feel Reed\u2019s side stare burning holes in him but he pretends he doesn\u2019t notice and Jonah continues,\u00a0\u201cThe ball is for Buffy. I\u2019m helping Cyrus and Andi put together a time capsule full of Buffy\u2019s memories so she has something to take with her when she leaves, I thought it would be nice if she had a memento from the team. See,\u201d Jonah says twirling the ball in his hands,\u00a0\u201cthe whole team has signed- Well, the whole team excluding you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for Buffy.\u201d Reed says with a knowing look and it earns another shy smile from Jonah.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIgnore him, that\u2019s what I usually do.\u201d TJ says with an exaggerated grin.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cSo, do you want to sign it?\u201d Jonah pulls a sharpie from his pocket and holds it out.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAre you sure that\u2019s even a good idea?\u201d TJ questions,\u00a0\u201cBuffy isn\u2019t exactly my biggest fan.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cUnderstatement of the year\u2026\u201d Jonah laughs nervously.\u00a0\u201cSigning could be like a grape vine to Buffy before she leaves, so things between you aren\u2019t on the worst of terms?\u201d Jonah suggests.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo you mean olive branch?\u201d Lester sports a confused look.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah but I hate olives.\u201d Jonah chuckles and both Lester and Reed exchange a perplexed expression, almost wanting to laugh at Jonah but it was so random they were at a loss for words.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you say?\u201d Jonah grins widely at TJ.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d TJ nods sheepishly and signs his name to the ball.\u00a0<br></p><p>After Jonah leaves, Reed and Lester lightly tease TJ about signing the ball. Joking that he\u2019s gone soft and mushy. TJ shrugs it off and insists he\u2019s happy Buffy is leaving for good.</p><p>-</p><p>After Buffy moves away TJ found it easier to be Cyrus\u2019s friend. They\u2019d often chat in the halls at school and they\u2019d text a little. So when Cyrus had a problem with P.E. TJ was happy to jump at the chance to help.\u00a0</p><p>After the somersault victory, TJ and Cyrus part ways. TJ meets Lester and Reed at the movie theatre and before the previews began TJ was retelling the events of the day.\u00a0</p><p>Lester expressed an interest in seeing Cyrus\u2019s list of easy things he couldn\u2019t do but TJ refused knowing he and Reed only wanted to make fun of it. As a\u00a0\u2018boo hoo\u2019 to TJ for being no fun his friends start throwing popcorn at him, with both Lester and Reed on either side of him TJ got quite annoyed by this and snaps at his friends.\u00a0<br><br>\u201dCalm down, Kippen.\u201d Reed\u2019s laughter halts abruptly, a hint of annoyance in his tone,\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re just having some fun.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201dAt the expense of me.\u201d TJ grumbles.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay, well, we\u2019re not making fun of you.\u201d Reed scoffs.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cRight, you\u2019re just making fun of my friend.\u201d TJ looks away with an irritated expression.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cLighten up, TJ.\u201d Lester pats his friend on the shoulder,\u00a0\u201cWe were just messing around.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d TJ shrugs and the lights in the theatre dim as the previews begin,\u00a0\u201cI just don\u2019t appreciate you making fun of, underdog\u2019s list.\u201d TJ adds with a whisper.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cUnderdog?\u201d Lester questions and another movie goer shushes him.\u00a0<br></p><p>The nickname wasn\u2019t something TJ avoided using around other people but in his present company it felt like a slip up.\u00a0\u201cJust a nickname,\u201d TJ shrugs it off quietly.\u00a0</p><p>Reed points a raised brow in TJ\u2019s direction although the cinemas was too dark for TJ to notice. Reed thought about TJ brining up the underdog swing game a few months back and questions if TJ\u2019s friendship with Cyrus was something more than he originally thought.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCute.\u201d Lester chuckles. \u00a0</p><p>The same movie goer from before speaks up again, this time louder, \u201cWould you kids quite down please?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cChill old man, the movie hasn\u2019t even started yet.\u201d Reed calls back and TJ gives him a firm shove in the arm to cut it out.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Reed asks defensively.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cJust stop.\u201d TJ keeps his voice low.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAlright, mom.\u201d Reed laughs obnoxiously and other people in the theatre were starting to get annoyed too.\u00a0<br></p><p>TJ bites his tongue although he really wanted to snap at Reed for saying that but TJ remains quiet because he knew Reed was purposely trying to stir him up. Reed knew TJ hated it when he called him mom, like he was being bossy or controlling which at times TJ would\u00a0have to be because Reed often got carried away.<br></p><p>Another woman leans forward and she looks annoyed but politely asks them to stop talking as she was trying to watch the trailers. TJ felt embarrassed by his friends misbehaving apologises to the lady and assures her they\u2019ll stop. Reed seems annoyed by TJ and sulks back in his seat. They watched the movie quietly, the mood definitely off between them all.\u00a0</p><p>Once the end credits rolls they exit the theatre but the mood doesn\u2019t lighten up. Things still seemed tense, specifically between Reed and TJ but Lester wasn\u2019t at all oblivious to it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo, who wants to grab a bite to eat before we head back to mine?\u201d Lester speaks up as they walk.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI think I might just go\u00a0home.\u201d TJ kicks a rock as he passes it.<br></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be playing the new video games I got for my birthday?\u201d Lester points out.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI just remembered I told my mom I\u2019d be home for dinner.\u201d TJ dips his hands into the pockets of his hoodie.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to hang out with us, TJ, you don\u2019t have to lie.\u201d Reed says almost casually.\u00a0\u201cYour mom is working tonight.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat, are you stalking her now or something?\u201d TJ retorts defensively.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNo, she said so yesterday when I was over for dinner.\u201d Reed glares,\u00a0\u201cWhat, are you lying now or something?\u201d Reed mimics TJ\u2019s defensive tone.<br></p><p>\u201cGuys, chill.\u201d Lester looks uncomfortable by the blow up.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault, Kippen is such a stick in the mud today.\u201d Reed rolls his eyes.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHonestly, what is your problem, Reed?\u201d TJ stops in his tracks, annoyed by his friends attitude,\u00a0\u201cIs this because I told you to shut up during the previews?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, actually it is.\u201d Reed scoffs,\u00a0\u201cBut it\u2019s not just today, you\u2019ve been constantly riding Lester and me every time we hang out.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Lester shifts uncomfortably on his feet,\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s not wrong, last weekend when we went bowling you were a bit of a buzz kill.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou guys were messing around in a different lane.\u201d TJ states.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Reed shrugs,\u00a0\u201cWe were just having a bit of fun.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWe got kicked out, just like I said we would.\u201d TJ sighs.<br></p><p>\u201cWho cares?\u201d Reed still looks like he\u2019s in disbelief almost that TJ was arguing the way he was.\u00a0\u201cMaybe we took it a little too far but you\u2019ve done the exact same thing with us in the past.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d TJ folds his arms, \u201cIn the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo now we can\u2019t have fun anymore?\u201d Reed asks.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to be public nuisances to have fun.\u201d TJ states.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSee, stick in the mud.\u201d Reed looks to Lester as he motions to TJ.\u00a0\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI apologise for being self-aware.\u201d TJ says sarcastically.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll be sure to act like more of a jerk when I\u2019m around you so you know I\u2019m having fun.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing a great job right now.\u201d Reed smirks patronisingly.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cGrow up, Reed.\u201d TJ rolls his eyes.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cSorry we can\u2019t all be as mature and\u00a0\u2018self-aware\u2019 as you,\u201d Reed says in a mocking tone.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve changed ever since you started hanging out with your little boyfriend, Cyrus.\u201d Reed states.</p><p>\u201cDude, that\u2019s not a cool joke.\u201d Lester hits Reed\u2019s chest lightly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWho said I was joking?\u201d Reed holds TJ\u2019s eye contact as he said it and confusion registers on Lesters face as he reads TJ\u2019s hurt expression.\u00a0\u00a0<br></p><p>TJ wanted to drop everything and run away. Reed\u2019s comment basically outed TJ to Lester and that kind of betrayal - from Reed of all people - hurt TJ in a way that levelled with how it felt when TJ\u2019s dad left him and his mom.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou sound jealous.\u201d TJ tries to hold his own although the hurt he felt was written all over his face.<br></p><p>\u201cOf muffin boy?\u201d Reed scoffs.\u00a0<br></p><p>TJ wanted to say something just as hurtful back, he wanted to call Reed a clingy friend and throw his distant workaholic father in his face but he doesn\u2019t, instead he weakly says,\u00a0\u201cForget it. I\u2019m going home,\u201d before quickly making an exit.<br></p><p>-\u00a0</p><p>The Monday morning following TJ and Reed\u2019s\u00a0big blowup, TJ is driven to school by his mother. Once parked, TJ remains in the passenger seat not wanting to get out. Tess tries to ask her son what is wrong but he insists everything is alright although he makes no effort to leave the car.\u00a0Even though Tess has to get to work she doesn\u2019t rush her son.</p><p>Out the windshield, TJ spots Cyrus standing out front of the school with Andi and more surprisingly, Buffy. Confusion hits TJ as Buffy had been gone for two months now. Then it was as if Cyrus had sensed TJ staring in their direction because he turned his head around and makes eye contact, sending a cheerful wave over in response. TJ sheepishly returns the gesture.</p><p>\u201cHe looks familiar.\u201d Tess says although she didn\u2019t know why he looked familiar.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my friend Cyrus.\u201d TJ says with a small smile.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh of course! You went to his bar mitzvah party,\u201d\u00a0Tess recalls, \u201cI\u00a0remember his face from the sweatshirt.\u201d Tess coos and TJ was suddenly feeling embarrassed. </p><p>\u201cWell I better get going, mom\u2026\u201d TJ says picking up his backpack and Tess wishes her son a good day at school.</p><p>Cyrus is already approaching the vehicle when TJ closes the car door behind himself. </p><p>\u201cHey, TJ.\u201d Cyrus greets him enthusiastically and sends a happy wave to TJ\u2018s mother as she pulled out of her parking space. TJ can\u2019t help but smile at this as Cyrus had never even met his mother before but there he was waving like they were on a first name basis. </p><p>\u201cHey, underdog.\u201d he smiles and for a moment TJ had forgotten about his fight with Reed and the awful feeling it had left him with. \u201cCall me crazy but did I just see you standing with Buffy before?\u201d </p><p>\u201cShe surprised me and Andi yesterday, isn\u2019t that great?\u201d Cyrus beams.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d TJ laughs,\u00a0\u201cHow long is she here for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the best part,\u201d Cyrus bounces on his toes, bursting with excitement,\u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s back for good!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo way..\u201d TJ says in a state of disbelief and\u00a0just like that TJ\u2019s bad mood returned. Not because he didn\u2019t want Buffy to be here, TJ was actually happy for her and for Cyrus to have his friend back, TJ\u2019s mood was triggered by the idea that his friendship with Cyrus would have to revert back to the way it was before Buffy moved away which was still nice but harder for them as Buffy didn\u2019t approve of them hanging out. The idea that he might have lost Reed, Lester and Cyrus all in a couple of days was too much for TJ.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d Cyrus questions after noticing TJ\u2019s expression drop, \u201cI know Buffy isn\u2019t your best friend or anything but I thought you were past the whole hating her thing\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that.\u201d TJ shakes his head, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>\"Ah hello, have you met me?\u201d Cyrus laughs,\u00a0\u201cWorrying is my specialty.\u00a0Do you want to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d TJ says honestly. What was he supposed to say to Cyrus?\u00a0<i>\u201cI had a fight with my best friends because they\u2019re whining about me being a better person?\u201d </i>Or<i> \u201cI\u2019m super upset because my closest friend outed me to our best friend and he did it by making a joke about you and me being boyfriends?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cI\u00a0can\u2019t force you to talk,\u201d Cyrus holds TJ\u2019s eye contact,\u00a0\u201cBut if you do want to, I\u2019m here.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\"Thanks.\u201d TJ breaks their eye contact and goes mumbly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo did you want to come say hi to Buffy before homeroom?\u201d Cyrus tries to change the subject to make TJ more comfortable.<br></p><p>\u201cDid you forget the part where she hates my guts?\u201d TJ laughs nervously.<br></p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t hate you.\u201d\u00a0Cyrus says unconvincingly.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got a right to.\u201d TJ states.\u00a0\u201cI got her kicked off the team right before she moved away, among other things\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cYour apology to time capsule Buffy was sincere. I know you\u2019re sorry.\u201d Cyrus says firmly,\u00a0\u201cMaybe it\u2019s time you express that to the real Buffy? </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s\u00a0is going to listen to me.\u201d TJ chews on the inside of his cheek anxiously.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIf she won\u2019t listen then you might have to show her instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going be a <i>great</i> sport during her first game back.\u201d\u00a0TJ nods in agreement.\u00a0 \u201cAll her games actually.\u201d TJ adds the last sentiment quickly and Cyrus smiles. TJ mirrors the grin and was quietly optimistic about the Cyrus side of his worries and that was enough to distract him from Reed and Lester for now.<br></p><p>-</p><p>Since Buffy\u2019s return, her and TJ have finally made up, TJ would even go as far as calling her a friend now. That whole chapter of his life being over made TJ feel lighter now that he wasn\u2019t hiding behind the image he was previously trying to portray. The only thing bothering TJ these days was his distance with Reed and Lester. TJ hadn\u2019t spoken to either of the boys since their blowup out front of the movie theatre.\u00a0</p><p>TJ sits on the worn down bench by the basketball court near his apartment building. He\u2019s extra mopey about his strained friendship today as he knew Reed\u2019s birthday was tomorrow and the two of them along with Lester always spent it together, even if it was just something small after school.\u00a0TJ was just about to head inside when he spots Reed approaching and it takes him by surprise.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Reed says sheepishly as he nears.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d TJ questions and not in a hotheaded manner but a surprised one.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYour mom invited me over for dinner for an early birthday celebration\u2026\u00a0\u201d Reed stops a few steps in front of where TJ sits,\u00a0\u201cI guess you haven\u2019t told her I was a jerk the last time we hung out..\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou showed up so I guess you didn\u2019t tell her either.\u201d TJ looks away as he speaks.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cTJ, I\u2019m<i> so </i>sorry.\u201d Reed says sincerely although it looked like he was struggling to actually form the words to say.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cFor which part?\u201d TJ asks.\u00a0\u201cFor making fun of my friend? For calling me boring or for practically outing me to Lester?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cFor all of it.\u201d Reed frowns,\u00a0\u201cEspecially the Lester part. That\u2019s the shittiest thing I have ever done in my entire life.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNo argument here.\u201d TJ folds his arms and still avoids eye contact.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t purposely trying to out you,\u201d Reed says honestly,\u00a0\u201cBut that\u2019s exactly what I did and I am so sorry. I was trying to go for the thing I knew would hurt you most.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWell it worked.\u201d TJ mumbles.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cTJ, I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d Reed\u2019s frown deepens.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI want to know why you wanted to hurt me so bad?\u201d\u00a0TJ finally snaps his head back to Reed,\u00a0\u201cWas it because I don\u2019t want to be a public nuisance? Because I\u2019m trying to be better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been my best friend for the longest time,\u201d Reed says,\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve been in the same sort of routine forever and it just felt like you were growing out it, out of me and Lester.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I think you and Lester are bad people?\u201d TJ furrows his brows.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Reed nods,\u00a0\u201cMaybe seeing you be more responsible made me insecure about myself\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoing what you did,<i>\u00a0outing me,</i>\u201d TJ wore a look of such pain on his face,\u00a0\u201cDoing that\u00a0for any reason is a really horrible thing to do, but doing it because you\u2019re angry I\u2019m being nicer? That\u2019s just- I don\u2019t even know.\u201d TJ lets out a frustrated breath.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Reed says firmly as he holds TJ\u2019s upset stare.\u00a0\u201cI wanted to hurt you because I was hurt. It\u2019s stupid and no excuse.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ furrows his brows,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry if I made you feel like I was trying to act better than you or something-\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTJ, please do not apologise.\u201d Reed holds his palms out to stop TJ.\u00a0\u201cI was upset because I was jealous. You said it yourself,\u201d Reed grows sheepish,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m jealous of muffin boy,\u201d Reed watches TJ\u2019s unimpressed expression so he softens and corrects himself, \u201cI was jealous of Cyrus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d TJ seems lightly confused. <br></p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re supposed to be <i>my</i> best friend.\u201d Reed says and feels dorky for it,\u00a0\u201cI mean I knew you were changing, I could see it, like how happy you were about passing your math test last month, just little things like that. I didn\u2019t really understand why but I knew Cyrus had something to do with it and at the movies I just snapped. It felt like I was being replaced or something..\u201d Reed lets out a nervous laugh.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cReed?\u201d TJ coaxes his head like he couldn\u2019t believe his friend felt that way.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing, I know.\u201d Reed shakes his head.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d TJ says nicely before admitting,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve always been jealous that you and Lester go to the same school. I\u2019v always felt left out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Reed seems surprised and TJ nods.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u00a0\u201cI like Cyrus. He\u2019s a good person and was great friend to me when I didn\u2019t deserve it but you\u2019re my best friend, Reed, you and Lester.\u201d TJ says firmly,\u00a0\u201cIt was you that came over my house everyday for three months after my dad left, it was you that took the blame when I broke my moms crystal vase playing basketball in the house. It\u2019s always been us, you me and Lester. We even went through chicken pox together, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLester wanted to call us the pox pals.\u201d Reed laughs quietly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt was lame.\u201d TJ shakes his head with a laugh.\u00a0\u201cYou, me and Lester have always been best friends but you and me? Reed we were quite literally almost brothers\u2026 How could you ever think I was replacing you?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Reed just shrugs,\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou were the first and only person I told about being gay.\u201d TJ grows vulnerable again.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAnd I went and broke your trust.\u201d Reed hates himself.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m awful, I know.\u00a0I\u2019ve been beating myself up about it this whole time, I\u2019ve been too embarrassed to come over and apologise.\u201d Reed says,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m been scared you\u2019d not even speak to me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat made you come over now?\u201d TJ questions.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI was hungry.\u201d Reed shrugs jokingly and TJ lets a laugh slip.\u00a0\u201cDo you ever think you\u2019ll be able to forgive me?\u201d Reed softens when he questions.</p><p>\u201cYou really hurt me.\u201d TJ says,\u00a0\u201cBut not being friends this whole time hurt me just as much\u2026 So yeah, I think I can forgive you.\u201d<br></p><p>Reed looks relieved and his mouth curls into a smile.\u00a0\u201cSo I can stay for dinner?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ rolls his head forward with a laugh,\u00a0\u201cYes you can stay for dinner.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>So the trust might take a little while to build back up but for the most part TJ was happy to mend things with Reed.\u00a0</p><p>A day after reconciling with Reed, TJ spoke to Lester whom was unsure how to approach things after the incident at the theatre. Reed had also been avoiding Lester in that time as he didn\u2019t want to discuss TJ\u2019s sexuality anymore than he already did when he made the backhanded comment that outed him. So understandably, Lester was confused about everything and unsure if he should say something to TJ or not.\u00a0</p><p>TJ officially comes out to Lester and the older boys is really supportive and it brings the two closer together. The fight between TJ and Reed might have been unwarranted and horrible but it did bring the three friends closer together whilst adding a new level of maturity to their friendship. The boys used to avoid the in-depth talks about their feelings and what not but now it was more of an open and safe space to share what\u2019s on each other their minds.</p><p>-</p><p>A few months later summer is a few days from ending and TJ is out biking with Reed and Lester. By now TJ and Reed\u2019s friendship was completely mended and their strained trust issues were in the past.\u00a0</p><p>The three of them are having a water break when Reed pulls out his phone and shows TJ and Lester a video his cousin had sent him of someone shooting a watermelon in slow motion. The two others express how \u2018cool\u2019 it look when it exploded but TJ\u2019s attention fades quickly after he notices he has a notification on his phone from Buffy. \u00a0Whilst Lester and Reed are watching the video again TJ opens a snapchat from Buffy where Cyrus is present in the background speaking in his ridiculous fake British accent,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m actually going to commit murder in a second.\u201d Buffy says and the snap ends with Cyrus\u2019s frowning. TJ chuckles to himself and Reed and Lester give him a look like they want an explanation.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCyrus got back from London last night and he\u2019s been using this terrible fake British accent and it\u2019s driving Buffy insane.\u201d TJ laughs.\u00a0\u201cWhich is strangely still satisfying for me even though we\u2019re all friends now.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cGive us a listen then?\u201d Reed motions with his hand.\u00a0<br></p><p>TJ goes into his text thread with Cyrus and opens the video Cyrus had sent to all his friends last night informing them he had landed. TJ was the only person that expressed how funny he found the accent so Cyrus had sent more video messages since, thus meaning TJ\u00a0had a few to show to Reed and Lester who also seem to find it amusing.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s definitely funny but I\u2019m with Buffy, I\u2019d probably snap too if he was speaking like that constantly.\u201d Lester chuckles.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo Cyrus is a funny guy?\u201d Reed questions.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s hilarious.\u201d TJ says with a lot of enthusiasm.\u00a0\u201cBut he\u2019s like funny without trying to be funny kind of funny, you know?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\"Totally.\u201d Reed says with a smirk resting on his face.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d TJ asks defensively.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not looking at you like anything.\u201d Reed says with a cute shrug and he and Lester exchange a knowing glance with one another.\u00a0<br></p><p>TJ shyly puts his phone away and Reed nudges him with his elbow before saying,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry for being a jerk about you changing. I like this TJ, you\u2019re happier.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Even thought that was a really wonderful thing for TJ to hear and they had gotten better at the sappy talks, unexpected kind declarations were still a little hard to accept so TJ clears his throat and suggests they get back to biking.\u00a0</p><p>-</p><p>Final bell for the day had rung and TJ was hanging out front of school with Lester and Reed when their conversation is interrupted by TJ\u2019s phone ringing. TJ smiles at Cyrus\u2019s caller I.D. and steps to the side to answer it. </p><p>\u201cHey, underdog.\u201d TJ greets him happily, \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI was calling to ask if you wanted to maybe help me hang posters for Buffy\u2019s \u00a0tryouts?\u201d Cyrus asks, \u201cIf you\u2019ve left already that\u2019s-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help.\u201d TJ cuts in. \u201cWhere are you now?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m walking out of the library, I just finished copying a few of the smaller posters. Ow, ow..\u201d Cyrus winces. </p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d TJ lets out a nervous chuckle. </p><p>\u201cDance class has left me with immense muscle pain.\u201d Cyrus complains. </p><p>\u201cSince when are you in dance class?\u201d TJ questions. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story, I was failing P.E. and needed an alternative but I think I\u2019ve made a mistake.\u201d Cyrus frowns to himself. </p><p>\u201cYou could have come to me for help before dropping P.E.\u201d TJ states. </p><p>\u201cYou any good at dancing?\u201d Cyrus asks. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re on your own there.\u201d TJ laughs and Cyrus does too. </p><p>\u201cOuch, don\u2019t make me laugh, it hurts.\u201d Cyrus says. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll meet you by admin in a second.\u201d TJ says with a smile before hanging up. </p><p>\u201cSo, what was that about?\u201d Reed asks with a smirk and TJ hadn\u2019t realised his two friends were watching him the whole time. </p><p>\u201cSo I have to go help hang posters for Buffy\u2019s basketball tryouts.\u201d TJ awkwardly announces to Lester and Reed. </p><p>\u201cUm weren\u2019t we supposed to hang out?\u201d Reed questions. </p><p>\u201cWe would have only been doing nothing at my house.\u201d TJ shrugs his shoulder, \u201cI\u2019m still trying to make amends with Buffy.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSure\u2026 You\u2019re ditching us for, Buffy.\u201d Reed folds his arms knowingly. \u201cSo that was Buffy on the phone asking for help?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not mad at me for ditching are you?\u201d TJ asks seriously.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAdmit you have a crush on Cyrus and I\u2019ll let it go.\u201d Reed lowers his voice and smirks.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d TJ laughs nervously,\u00a0\u201cI do not..\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cTJ, who are you kidding?\u201d Lester coaxes his head with a smile.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIs it that obvious?\u201d TJ frowns.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah only for like the entire summer.\u201d Lester chuckles.\u00a0\u201cCyrus did this in London, Cyrus did that\u201d he playfully imitates.<br></p><p>TJ pouts huffily.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou better go, I\u2019d hate for you to keep underdog waiting.\u201d Reed smirks.\u00a0</p><p>TJ frowns knowing this was a whole new thing for them to tease him about, even in a friendly way. TJ was just upset because it meant he finally had to address his feelings for Cyrus out loud.\u00a0</p><p>-\u00a0</p><p>A couple weeks later the three boys were lying around Lester\u2019s basement enjoying the air conditioning on this hot day. They were all being social, just not with each other. Each of the teens sat on their phones. TJ texts Cyrus back and forth about his canoeing escapades, laughing out loud with every new message.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou going to let us in on the joke?\u201d Reed grumbles.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d TJ peels his stare away from his phone for a moment.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cDude you\u2019ve been giggling for the last twenty minutes.\u201d Reed says.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI have not been- <i>giggling.</i>\u201d TJ says defensively but with a hint of embarrassment.\u00a0</p><p>\"Let me guess, it\u2019s Cyrus?\u201d Reed asks knowingly and Lester smiles knowing he was right.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s canoeing.\u201d TJ shrugs one shoulder.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cSo are we ever going to meet Cyrus?\u201d Reed questions.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou talk about him enough, I feel like we know him.\u201d Lester adds.\u00a0\u201cWe even helped eat the muffins he baked you last week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still not happy about that.\u201d TJ frowns.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI am, they were delicious.\u201d Reed laughs as he pats his stomach,\u00a0\u201cBlueberry macadamia, who would\u2019ve thought?\u201d<br></p><p>TJ shakes his head with a smile.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBut seriously,\u201d Reed says,\u00a0\u201cWhen are we going to meet Cyrus?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d TJ folds his arms.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Reed looks offended.\u00a0\u201cAre you embarrassed by us or something?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d TJ pops the P.\u00a0\u201cI know one of you will say something teasingly to me and Cyrus will get suspicious about my feelings and then never talk to me again.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a little dramatic.\u201d Lester laughs.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIs it though?\u201d TJ asks seriously\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cCome on, TJ?\u201d Reed pouts his bottom lip.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d TJ lets out a defeated breath,\u00a0\u201cBut you guys have to promise you\u2019ll be on your best behaviour?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be a couple of saints.\u201d Reed exaggerates an innocent smile.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll ask him to hang out on Saturday..\u201d TJ nods still a little reluctantly,\u00a0\u201cAny ideas on what we should do?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cDoes Cyrus like dirt biking?\u201d Lester questions.\u00a0<br></p><p>TJ tosses his head from side to side,\u00a0\u201cProbably not\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do that anyway.\u201d Reed insists,\u00a0\u201cIt will totally make you look cool in front of him.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah cause I totally care about that.\u201d TJ says in a mocking way and folds his arms and\u00a0Lester and Reed wear amused expressions.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo dirt biking on Saturday?\u201d Reed smirks.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d TJ lets out a heavy sigh knowing they both see right through him.\u00a0<br></p></p>",

TJ lets\u00a0himself into his apartment knowing his mom wouldn\u2019t be home. TJ sets his backpack down on the kitchen counter and picks up the little post-it note left on the edge in a clearly visible spot so TJ would notice it once he arrived. The note reads;</p><p><i>\u2018Working late tonight but can\u2019t wait to hear about tryouts in the morning. There\u2019s a plate of dinner for you to heat up in the fridge,\u00a0</i><i>love mom\u2019</i>.\u00a0</p><p>TJ smiles to himself for a moment that she always signs her notes off with \u2018mom\u2019 even though it was just the two of them and therefore no one else to mistake as the sender of the note.\u00a0</p><p>With a hand on his stomach, TJ wanders over to the refrigerator to have a look at what was on the menu for the evening. TJ is disappointed to find a half eaten plate of meatloaf and mashed potatoes.

TJ jokes that for a rich boy, Reed is often spending TJ\u2019s hard earned money to to which Reed rolls his eyes and assures TJ he\u2019s good for it.</p><p>Reed was TJ\u2019s oldest friend.The two met when TJ was nine and Reed was eight. TJ had just started to get into dirt biking and they met at a popular riding spot. Reed had been doing it since he was much younger and was a great help for the beginner. The two were fast friends and have only gotten closer since. In fact, there was one point in time where the two almost became stepbrothers. TJ\u2019s mom, Tess was engaged to Reed\u2019s dad, Michael but she called it off because Michael\u2019s all consuming work schedule was a really big issue within their relationship. Michael became quite bitter about the breakup and for sometime after he banned Reed from seeing TJ but thankfully he eventually dropped his anger towards TJ and let his son see him again. Although her relationship ended with his father, Tess is still quite motherly to Reed, hence the spare key and complete comfort Reed feels being in their apartment alone.</p><p>Shortly after they first connected, Reed introduced TJ to Lester whom he knew from school. Both Lester and Reed go to Lincoln Academy which is a private school across town, one that goes from kindergarten right through until high school. Upon introducing Lester to TJ, the three instantly clicked as a group. Lester tends to be the quietest of the three even though\u00a0he\u2019s the oldest, he\u2019s shy around new people but when it came to TJ and Reed he showed a lot more personality. The three earn a reputation as being mischievous at times, often causing Tess great grief and trouble for Reed with his dad.\u00a0Regardless of their reputation though, they were TJ\u2019s best friends. Sure he had his basketball friends at school but he misses having Reed and Lester around during his daily schedule and is at time envious they get to go to school together, even if they wore dorky uniforms, although he\u2019d never admit that out loud.\u00a0</p><p>-</p><p>A day after the Jefferson Middle School\u2019s first basketball game of the season,\u00a0TJ is out front of The Red Rooster flipping through a rack of records whilst Reed and Lester were inside looking at others when he\u2019s approached by Buffy. Buffy very maturally tries to reason with TJ but he blows her off completely resulting in some heated words from Buffy before she storms off.</p><p>It\u2019s only a second later that Reed and Lester exit The Red Rooster and both catch a glimpse of Buffy as she storms away.</p><p>\u201cWhat was all that about?\u201d Reed questions. </p><p>\u201cThat was Buffy.\u201d TJ rolls his eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh damn.\u201d Lester laughs, \u201cShe is not what I was expecting.\u201d By now Reed had caught Lester up on the issue whilst they were at school together.</p><p>\u201cWe could hear her yelling at you from inside,\u201d Reed appears amused.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell she\u2019s officially on the team and officially a pain in the neck.\u201d TJ huffs.<br></p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got personality,\u00a0I like her.\u201d Reed smirks.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell you\u2019re both annoying so it\u2019s like a match made in heaven.\u201d TJ replies snippily and Lester laughs halfheartedly. </p><p>Reed chuckles through a sarcastic, \u201cOoo,\u201d before TJ rolls his eyes and walks away. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be like that.\u201d Reed says as he and Lester chase after TJ.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not taking my Buffy problem seriously.\u201d TJ folds his arms.<br></p><p>\u201cIf you really don\u2019t want her on the team you\u2019re going to have to\u00a0convince her not to be.\u201d Reed says.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHow am I supposed to do that?\u201d TJ asks.\u00a0\u201cI already told her to quit.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, don\u2019t pass her the ball?\u201d Reed suggests,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019ll quit eventually.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>-</p><p>A few weeks later TJ is shooting hoops at the court by his apartment building to let off some steam. After another failed algebra test he\u2019s being forced to start tutoring sessions with Buffy of all people.\u00a0TJ grumpily makes a shot, the ball connects with the edge of the hoop and bounces backwards.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd I thought you were supposed to be good at this?\u201d Reed catches the rebound, Lester is a step behind him chuckling.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m too angry.\u201d TJ huffs as he catches the ball Reed bounced back towards him.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s rubbing you the wrong way?\u201d Lester questions.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cMy stupid math teacher is making me get a tutor because I failed a couple of dumb tests.\u201d TJ folds his arms,\u00a0\u201cMaybe if he wasn\u2019t so boring I wouldn\u2019t fall asleep in his class and I\u2019d actually pass.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the unlucky student that gets to tutor you?\u201d Reed questions.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cDriscoll.\u201d TJ says with a look of distaste.</p><p>Reed stifles a laugh, \u201cNow I get the whole broody basketballer mood.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBuffy?\u201d Lester questions,\u00a0\u201cThat poor girl you\u2019ve been tormenting on your team?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not tormenting her.\u201d TJ looks offended.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s met you, that\u2019s\u00a0torture enough.\u201d Reed jokes and Lester playfully smacks his chest in amusement.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cMy charming personality doesn\u2019t seem to be enough to repel you two losers.\u201d TJ rolls his eyes before lobbing the basketball towards his friends.

Lester\u2019s basement was a nice setup, it wasn\u2019t quite as flash as Reed\u2019s mansion of a home but Lester\u2019s living situation was definitely a good few steps up from TJ\u2019s tiny apparent he shared with his mom.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Lester greets TJ, he and Reed both sit on a couch in the middle of the basement.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d TJ says as he takes a seat in the free armchair adjacent to them both.\u00a0\u201cSo Buffy agreed to tutor me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you manage that?\u201d Lester questions.</p><p>\u201cI agreed to pass her the ball.\u201d TJ releases a defeated sigh. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d Reed laughs, \u201cShe has to teach your dumb ass and all you have to do is pass her the ball?\u201d </p><p>\u201cDude?\u201d TJ gives his friend an unamused look. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just kidding.\u201d Reed dismisses TJ\u2019s sensitivity towards the joke. </p><p>\u201cPassing her the ball is a gateway into her wanting to stay on the team.\u201d TJ folds his arms. </p><p>\u201cYeah but it also means that <i>you</i> get to stay on the team.\u201d Lester highlights.</p><p>\u201cYou guys were the ones that encouraged me to try and make her quit.\u201d TJ says defensively.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah but now you need her help with something so you have to adapt.\u201d Lester shrugs.<br></p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d TJ sinks into the chair with a sulky expression.\u00a0\u201cThere was one other condition she had..\u201d TJ was mumbly as he said this but there was a hint of a smile that crossed his face.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Reed points a raised brow at TJ out of confusion more than curiosity.</p><p>\u201cShe made me get her friend a muffin.\u201d TJ says.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cLike buy a muffin?\u201d Reed tries to make sense of it all.<br></p><p>\u201cNo, we have these muffins in the cafeteria he just always misses out on one.\u201d TJ explains.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t get his own muffin?\u201d Reed laughs.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat was my reaction,\u201d TJ laughs too but then softens,\u00a0\u201cI think he\u2019s just too polite to cut in line.<br></p><p>\u201cSo you cut in and got him the muffin?\u201d Lester questions stoically, clearly not enthralled by the muffin tale.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cKind of,\u201d TJ shrugs,\u00a0\u201cI guess it doesn\u2019t really matter.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWell he got a muffin and you got yourself a tutor.\u201d Reed slaps his knee,\u00a0\u201cThings are looking up.\u201d<br></p><p>-</p><p>TJ begins tutoring with Buffy and much like his behaviour with the past tutors he\u2019s burnt through, TJ shows her little respect, all to deflect from his struggles to actually make sense of what she\u2019s\u00a0saying.</p><p>In a strange twist of fate TJ winds up on the swings with Cyrus where the pair swing away their \u2018stuff\u2019. A nice moment is interrupted when Buffy finds them together and then suggests TJ might have a learning disability. TJ already thinking so little of himself, receives this poorly and storms off again.\u00a0</p><p>On his walk home, TJ bumps into Reed who was riding his push bike.

Once there, TJ walks past Reed\u2019s father Michael taking a business call in the kitchen, the two exchange a silent wave and TJ continues towards the theatre room knowing that\u2019s where he\u2019d find the guys. It was pretty late but not uncommon for Michael to still be working, after all, that is why TJ\u2019s\u00a0mother called off their engagement but TJ still had a wave of sympathy for his friend, although Reed avoids all sorts of family talk, TJ knew he was lonely at home.\u00a0</p><p>Once in the theatre room, TJ finds Lester has already fallen asleep on one of the reclining chairs but Reed was awake and watching a movie with the volume turned down low.</p><p>TJ sets himself down on the seat beside Reed and the boys lower their voices to whispers as TJ starts to share how great the party was. He left out details like the fortuneteller confirming his learning disability or Buffy roasting him but he did share a tale of Cyrus and some fancy apple cider.</p><p>-</p><p>After TJ\u2019s suspension from the team and some encouraging words from Cyrus he tells Mr. Coleman about his dyscalculia and his suspension is lifted. TJ also couldn\u2019t help himself and rubbed his good fortune in Buffy\u2019s face all the while he let slip about his manipulation into getting her to do his homework and coming clean about it got Buffy suspended instead which TJ was unapologetic for.\u00a0</p><p>As TJ preps for his first game back, Lester and Reed keep him company. TJ explains what had gone down, he even opened up about his dyscalculia with them which Reed and Lester quickly deduced they shouldn\u2019t give TJ a hard time about. TJ goes on to\u00a0express that he kind of felt bad for getting Buffy suspended too, she was moving away soon and he really ruined that for her. TJ also stressed that he felt guilty for saying something that would probably cause a fight between Cyrus and Buffy.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy do you care if they\u2019re fighting?\u201d Reed questions.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cJust because I don\u2019t like Buffy doesn\u2019t mean I need to go ruining her friendships with everyone else right before she moves away\u2026\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>School has wrapped up for the day and TJ was surprised to find Lester and Reed waiting out front. The two were still dressed in their school uniforms and they explained that they had ditched last period, that was hard to do at their private school so TJ suspects they\u2019d both get in trouble for it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey, TJ!\u201d A voice calls from some distance away. TJ peels his gaze from his friends and points it over in the direction his name was called. TJ spots Jonah approaching at a quick paced walk with a basketball gripped in his hands, which was odd to TJ because Jonah was a frisbee boy.<br></p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d Lester questions as it wasn\u2019t any of TJ\u2019s basketball friends that he and Reed had met before.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIs that Cyrus?\u201d Reed asks.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s Jonah.\u201d TJ scrunches his face up.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Jonah?\u201d Reed wonders.\u00a0<br></p><p>TJ hushes his friends just as Jonah reaches them.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m glad I caught you before you left.\u201d Jonah lets out a heavy breath as he was lightly puffed, he sends a shy smile to the two strangers TJ was with.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAh, hey..\u201d TJ gives him a weak smile, the only interaction they had had prior to this was during Jonah\u2019s\u00a0panic attack.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI brought this for you to sign.\u201d Jonah holds the basketball out for TJ.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou starting a fan club for the basketball team or something?\u201d TJ pricks up a brow.\u00a0<br></p><p>Jonah laughs softly and endearingly says,\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s more Cyrus\u2019s thing.\u201d TJ could feel Reed\u2019s side stare burning holes in him but he pretends he doesn\u2019t notice and Jonah continues,\u00a0\u201cThe ball is for Buffy. I\u2019m helping Cyrus and Andi put together a time capsule full of Buffy\u2019s memories so she has something to take with her when she leaves, I thought it would be nice if she had a memento from the team. See,\u201d Jonah says twirling the ball in his hands,\u00a0\u201cthe whole team has signed- Well, the whole team excluding you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for Buffy.\u201d Reed says with a knowing look and it earns another shy smile from Jonah.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIgnore him, that\u2019s what I usually do.\u201d TJ says with an exaggerated grin.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cSo, do you want to sign it?\u201d Jonah pulls a sharpie from his pocket and holds it out.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAre you sure that\u2019s even a good idea?\u201d TJ questions,\u00a0\u201cBuffy isn\u2019t exactly my biggest fan.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cUnderstatement of the year\u2026\u201d Jonah laughs nervously.\u00a0\u201cSigning could be like a grape vine to Buffy before she leaves, so things between you aren\u2019t on the worst of terms?\u201d Jonah suggests.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo you mean olive branch?\u201d Lester sports a confused look.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah but I hate olives.\u201d Jonah chuckles and both Lester and Reed exchange a perplexed expression, almost wanting to laugh at Jonah but it was so random they were at a loss for words.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you say?\u201d Jonah grins widely at TJ.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d TJ nods sheepishly and signs his name to the ball.\u00a0<br></p><p>After Jonah leaves, Reed and Lester lightly tease TJ about signing the ball. Joking that he\u2019s gone soft and mushy. TJ shrugs it off and insists he\u2019s happy Buffy is leaving for good.</p><p>-</p><p>After Buffy moves away TJ found it easier to be Cyrus\u2019s friend. They\u2019d often chat in the halls at school and they\u2019d text a little. So when Cyrus had a problem with P.E. TJ was happy to jump at the chance to help.\u00a0</p><p>After the somersault victory, TJ and Cyrus part ways. TJ meets Lester and Reed at the movie theatre and before the previews began TJ was retelling the events of the day.\u00a0</p><p>Lester expressed an interest in seeing Cyrus\u2019s list of easy things he couldn\u2019t do but TJ refused knowing he and Reed only wanted to make fun of it. As a\u00a0\u2018boo hoo\u2019 to TJ for being no fun his friends start throwing popcorn at him, with both Lester and Reed on either side of him TJ got quite annoyed by this and snaps at his friends.\u00a0<br><br>\u201dCalm down, Kippen.\u201d Reed\u2019s laughter halts abruptly, a hint of annoyance in his tone,\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re just having some fun.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201dAt the expense of me.\u201d TJ grumbles.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay, well, we\u2019re not making fun of you.\u201d Reed scoffs.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cRight, you\u2019re just making fun of my friend.\u201d TJ looks away with an irritated expression.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cLighten up, TJ.\u201d Lester pats his friend on the shoulder,\u00a0\u201cWe were just messing around.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d TJ shrugs and the lights in the theatre dim as the previews begin,\u00a0\u201cI just don\u2019t appreciate you making fun of, underdog\u2019s list.\u201d TJ adds with a whisper.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cUnderdog?\u201d Lester questions and another movie goer shushes him.\u00a0<br></p><p>The nickname wasn\u2019t something TJ avoided using around other people but in his present company it felt like a slip up.\u00a0\u201cJust a nickname,\u201d TJ shrugs it off quietly.\u00a0</p><p>Reed points a raised brow in TJ\u2019s direction although the cinemas was too dark for TJ to notice. Reed thought about TJ brining up the underdog swing game a few months back and questions if TJ\u2019s friendship with Cyrus was something more than he originally thought.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCute.\u201d Lester chuckles. \u00a0</p><p>The same movie goer from before speaks up again, this time louder, \u201cWould you kids quite down please?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cChill old man, the movie hasn\u2019t even started yet.\u201d Reed calls back and TJ gives him a firm shove in the arm to cut it out.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Reed asks defensively.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cJust stop.\u201d TJ keeps his voice low.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAlright, mom.\u201d Reed laughs obnoxiously and other people in the theatre were starting to get annoyed too.\u00a0<br></p><p>TJ bites his tongue although he really wanted to snap at Reed for saying that but TJ remains quiet because he knew Reed was purposely trying to stir him up. Reed knew TJ hated it when he called him mom, like he was being bossy or controlling which at times TJ would\u00a0have to be because Reed often got carried away.<br></p><p>Another woman leans forward and she looks annoyed but politely asks them to stop talking as she was trying to watch the trailers. TJ felt embarrassed by his friends misbehaving apologises to the lady and assures her they\u2019ll stop. Reed seems annoyed by TJ and sulks back in his seat. They watched the movie quietly, the mood definitely off between them all.\u00a0</p><p>Once the end credits rolls they exit the theatre but the mood doesn\u2019t lighten up. Things still seemed tense, specifically between Reed and TJ but Lester wasn\u2019t at all oblivious to it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo, who wants to grab a bite to eat before we head back to mine?\u201d Lester speaks up as they walk.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI think I might just go\u00a0home.\u201d TJ kicks a rock as he passes it.<br></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be playing the new video games I got for my birthday?\u201d Lester points out.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI just remembered I told my mom I\u2019d be home for dinner.\u201d TJ dips his hands into the pockets of his hoodie.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to hang out with us, TJ, you don\u2019t have to lie.\u201d Reed says almost casually.\u00a0\u201cYour mom is working tonight.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat, are you stalking her now or something?\u201d TJ retorts defensively.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNo, she said so yesterday when I was over for dinner.\u201d Reed glares,\u00a0\u201cWhat, are you lying now or something?\u201d Reed mimics TJ\u2019s defensive tone.<br></p><p>\u201cGuys, chill.\u201d Lester looks uncomfortable by the blow up.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault, Kippen is such a stick in the mud today.\u201d Reed rolls his eyes.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHonestly, what is your problem, Reed?\u201d TJ stops in his tracks, annoyed by his friends attitude,\u00a0\u201cIs this because I told you to shut up during the previews?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, actually it is.\u201d Reed scoffs,\u00a0\u201cBut it\u2019s not just today, you\u2019ve been constantly riding Lester and me every time we hang out.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Lester shifts uncomfortably on his feet,\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s not wrong, last weekend when we went bowling you were a bit of a buzz kill.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou guys were messing around in a different lane.\u201d TJ states.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Reed shrugs,\u00a0\u201cWe were just having a bit of fun.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWe got kicked out, just like I said we would.\u201d TJ sighs.<br></p><p>\u201cWho cares?\u201d Reed still looks like he\u2019s in disbelief almost that TJ was arguing the way he was.\u00a0\u201cMaybe we took it a little too far but you\u2019ve done the exact same thing with us in the past.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d TJ folds his arms, \u201cIn the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo now we can\u2019t have fun anymore?\u201d Reed asks.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to be public nuisances to have fun.\u201d TJ states.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSee, stick in the mud.\u201d Reed looks to Lester as he motions to TJ.\u00a0\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI apologise for being self-aware.\u201d TJ says sarcastically.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll be sure to act like more of a jerk when I\u2019m around you so you know I\u2019m having fun.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing a great job right now.\u201d Reed smirks patronisingly.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cGrow up, Reed.\u201d TJ rolls his eyes.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cSorry we can\u2019t all be as mature and\u00a0\u2018self-aware\u2019 as you,\u201d Reed says in a mocking tone.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve changed ever since you started hanging out with your little boyfriend, Cyrus.\u201d Reed states.</p><p>\u201cDude, that\u2019s not a cool joke.\u201d Lester hits Reed\u2019s chest lightly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWho said I was joking?\u201d Reed holds TJ\u2019s eye contact as he said it and confusion registers on Lesters face as he reads TJ\u2019s hurt expression.\u00a0\u00a0<br></p><p>TJ wanted to drop everything and run away. Reed\u2019s comment basically outed TJ to Lester and that kind of betrayal - from Reed of all people - hurt TJ in a way that levelled with how it felt when TJ\u2019s dad left him and his mom.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou sound jealous.\u201d TJ tries to hold his own although the hurt he felt was written all over his face.<br></p><p>\u201cOf muffin boy?\u201d Reed scoffs.\u00a0<br></p><p>TJ wanted to say something just as hurtful back, he wanted to call Reed a clingy friend and throw his distant workaholic father in his face but he doesn\u2019t, instead he weakly says,\u00a0\u201cForget it. I\u2019m going home,\u201d before quickly making an exit.<br></p><p>-\u00a0</p><p>The Monday morning following TJ and Reed\u2019s\u00a0big blowup, TJ is driven to school by his mother. Once parked, TJ remains in the passenger seat not wanting to get out. Tess tries to ask her son what is wrong but he insists everything is alright although he makes no effort to leave the car.\u00a0Even though Tess has to get to work she doesn\u2019t rush her son.</p><p>Out the windshield, TJ spots Cyrus standing out front of the school with Andi and more surprisingly, Buffy. Confusion hits TJ as Buffy had been gone for two months now. Then it was as if Cyrus had sensed TJ staring in their direction because he turned his head around and makes eye contact, sending a cheerful wave over in response. TJ sheepishly returns the gesture.</p><p>\u201cHe looks familiar.\u201d Tess says although she didn\u2019t know why he looked familiar.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my friend Cyrus.\u201d TJ says with a small smile.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh of course! You went to his bar mitzvah party,\u201d\u00a0Tess recalls, \u201cI\u00a0remember his face from the sweatshirt.\u201d Tess coos and TJ was suddenly feeling embarrassed. </p><p>\u201cWell I better get going, mom\u2026\u201d TJ says picking up his backpack and Tess wishes her son a good day at school.</p><p>Cyrus is already approaching the vehicle when TJ closes the car door behind himself. </p><p>\u201cHey, TJ.\u201d Cyrus greets him enthusiastically and sends a happy wave to TJ\u2018s mother as she pulled out of her parking space. TJ can\u2019t help but smile at this as Cyrus had never even met his mother before but there he was waving like they were on a first name basis. </p><p>\u201cHey, underdog.\u201d he smiles and for a moment TJ had forgotten about his fight with Reed and the awful feeling it had left him with. \u201cCall me crazy but did I just see you standing with Buffy before?\u201d </p><p>\u201cShe surprised me and Andi yesterday, isn\u2019t that great?\u201d Cyrus beams.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d TJ laughs,\u00a0\u201cHow long is she here for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the best part,\u201d Cyrus bounces on his toes, bursting with excitement,\u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s back for good!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo way..\u201d TJ says in a state of disbelief and\u00a0just like that TJ\u2019s bad mood returned. Not because he didn\u2019t want Buffy to be here, TJ was actually happy for her and for Cyrus to have his friend back, TJ\u2019s mood was triggered by the idea that his friendship with Cyrus would have to revert back to the way it was before Buffy moved away which was still nice but harder for them as Buffy didn\u2019t approve of them hanging out. The idea that he might have lost Reed, Lester and Cyrus all in a couple of days was too much for TJ.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d Cyrus questions after noticing TJ\u2019s expression drop, \u201cI know Buffy isn\u2019t your best friend or anything but I thought you were past the whole hating her thing\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that.\u201d TJ shakes his head, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>\"Ah hello, have you met me?\u201d Cyrus laughs,\u00a0\u201cWorrying is my specialty.\u00a0Do you want to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d TJ says honestly. What was he supposed to say to Cyrus?\u00a0<i>\u201cI had a fight with my best friends because they\u2019re whining about me being a better person?\u201d </i>Or<i> \u201cI\u2019m super upset because my closest friend outed me to our best friend and he did it by making a joke about you and me being boyfriends?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cI\u00a0can\u2019t force you to talk,\u201d Cyrus holds TJ\u2019s eye contact,\u00a0\u201cBut if you do want to, I\u2019m here.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\"Thanks.\u201d TJ breaks their eye contact and goes mumbly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo did you want to come say hi to Buffy before homeroom?\u201d Cyrus tries to change the subject to make TJ more comfortable.<br></p><p>\u201cDid you forget the part where she hates my guts?\u201d TJ laughs nervously.<br></p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t hate you.\u201d\u00a0Cyrus says unconvincingly.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got a right to.\u201d TJ states.\u00a0\u201cI got her kicked off the team right before she moved away, among other things\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cYour apology to time capsule Buffy was sincere. I know you\u2019re sorry.\u201d Cyrus says firmly,\u00a0\u201cMaybe it\u2019s time you express that to the real Buffy? </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s\u00a0is going to listen to me.\u201d TJ chews on the inside of his cheek anxiously.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIf she won\u2019t listen then you might have to show her instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going be a <i>great</i> sport during her first game back.\u201d\u00a0TJ nods in agreement.\u00a0 \u201cAll her games actually.\u201d TJ adds the last sentiment quickly and Cyrus smiles. TJ mirrors the grin and was quietly optimistic about the Cyrus side of his worries and that was enough to distract him from Reed and Lester for now.<br></p><p>-</p><p>Since Buffy\u2019s return, her and TJ have finally made up, TJ would even go as far as calling her a friend now. That whole chapter of his life being over made TJ feel lighter now that he wasn\u2019t hiding behind the image he was previously trying to portray. The only thing bothering TJ these days was his distance with Reed and Lester. TJ hadn\u2019t spoken to either of the boys since their blowup out front of the movie theatre.\u00a0</p><p>TJ sits on the worn down bench by the basketball court near his apartment building. He\u2019s extra mopey about his strained friendship today as he knew Reed\u2019s birthday was tomorrow and the two of them along with Lester always spent it together, even if it was just something small after school.\u00a0TJ was just about to head inside when he spots Reed approaching and it takes him by surprise.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Reed says sheepishly as he nears.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d TJ questions and not in a hotheaded manner but a surprised one.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYour mom invited me over for dinner for an early birthday celebration\u2026\u00a0\u201d Reed stops a few steps in front of where TJ sits,\u00a0\u201cI guess you haven\u2019t told her I was a jerk the last time we hung out..\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou showed up so I guess you didn\u2019t tell her either.\u201d TJ looks away as he speaks.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cTJ, I\u2019m<i> so </i>sorry.\u201d Reed says sincerely although it looked like he was struggling to actually form the words to say.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cFor which part?\u201d TJ asks.\u00a0\u201cFor making fun of my friend? For calling me boring or for practically outing me to Lester?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cFor all of it.\u201d Reed frowns,\u00a0\u201cEspecially the Lester part. That\u2019s the shittiest thing I have ever done in my entire life.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNo argument here.\u201d TJ folds his arms and still avoids eye contact.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t purposely trying to out you,\u201d Reed says honestly,\u00a0\u201cBut that\u2019s exactly what I did and I am so sorry. I was trying to go for the thing I knew would hurt you most.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWell it worked.\u201d TJ mumbles.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cTJ, I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d Reed\u2019s frown deepens.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI want to know why you wanted to hurt me so bad?\u201d\u00a0TJ finally snaps his head back to Reed,\u00a0\u201cWas it because I don\u2019t want to be a public nuisance? Because I\u2019m trying to be better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been my best friend for the longest time,\u201d Reed says,\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve been in the same sort of routine forever and it just felt like you were growing out it, out of me and Lester.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I think you and Lester are bad people?\u201d TJ furrows his brows.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Reed nods,\u00a0\u201cMaybe seeing you be more responsible made me insecure about myself\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoing what you did,<i>\u00a0outing me,</i>\u201d TJ wore a look of such pain on his face,\u00a0\u201cDoing that\u00a0for any reason is a really horrible thing to do, but doing it because you\u2019re angry I\u2019m being nicer? That\u2019s just- I don\u2019t even know.\u201d TJ lets out a frustrated breath.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Reed says firmly as he holds TJ\u2019s upset stare.\u00a0\u201cI wanted to hurt you because I was hurt. It\u2019s stupid and no excuse.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ furrows his brows,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry if I made you feel like I was trying to act better than you or something-\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTJ, please do not apologise.\u201d Reed holds his palms out to stop TJ.\u00a0\u201cI was upset because I was jealous. You said it yourself,\u201d Reed grows sheepish,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m jealous of muffin boy,\u201d Reed watches TJ\u2019s unimpressed expression so he softens and corrects himself, \u201cI was jealous of Cyrus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d TJ seems lightly confused. <br></p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re supposed to be <i>my</i> best friend.\u201d Reed says and feels dorky for it,\u00a0\u201cI mean I knew you were changing, I could see it, like how happy you were about passing your math test last month, just little things like that. I didn\u2019t really understand why but I knew Cyrus had something to do with it and at the movies I just snapped. It felt like I was being replaced or something..\u201d Reed lets out a nervous laugh.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cReed?\u201d TJ coaxes his head like he couldn\u2019t believe his friend felt that way.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing, I know.\u201d Reed shakes his head.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d TJ says nicely before admitting,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve always been jealous that you and Lester go to the same school. I\u2019v always felt left out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Reed seems surprised and TJ nods.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u00a0\u201cI like Cyrus. He\u2019s a good person and was great friend to me when I didn\u2019t deserve it but you\u2019re my best friend, Reed, you and Lester.\u201d TJ says firmly,\u00a0\u201cIt was you that came over my house everyday for three months after my dad left, it was you that took the blame when I broke my moms crystal vase playing basketball in the house. It\u2019s always been us, you me and Lester. We even went through chicken pox together, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLester wanted to call us the pox pals.\u201d Reed laughs quietly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt was lame.\u201d TJ shakes his head with a laugh.\u00a0\u201cYou, me and Lester have always been best friends but you and me? Reed we were quite literally almost brothers\u2026 How could you ever think I was replacing you?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Reed just shrugs,\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou were the first and only person I told about being gay.\u201d TJ grows vulnerable again.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAnd I went and broke your trust.\u201d Reed hates himself.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m awful, I know.\u00a0I\u2019ve been beating myself up about it this whole time, I\u2019ve been too embarrassed to come over and apologise.\u201d Reed says,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m been scared you\u2019d not even speak to me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat made you come over now?\u201d TJ questions.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI was hungry.\u201d Reed shrugs jokingly and TJ lets a laugh slip.\u00a0\u201cDo you ever think you\u2019ll be able to forgive me?\u201d Reed softens when he questions.</p><p>\u201cYou really hurt me.\u201d TJ says,\u00a0\u201cBut not being friends this whole time hurt me just as much\u2026 So yeah, I think I can forgive you.\u201d<br></p><p>Reed looks relieved and his mouth curls into a smile.\u00a0\u201cSo I can stay for dinner?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ rolls his head forward with a laugh,\u00a0\u201cYes you can stay for dinner.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>So the trust might take a little while to build back up but for the most part TJ was happy to mend things with Reed.\u00a0</p><p>A day after reconciling with Reed, TJ spoke to Lester whom was unsure how to approach things after the incident at the theatre. Reed had also been avoiding Lester in that time as he didn\u2019t want to discuss TJ\u2019s sexuality anymore than he already did when he made the backhanded comment that outed him. So understandably, Lester was confused about everything and unsure if he should say something to TJ or not.\u00a0</p><p>TJ officially comes out to Lester and the older boys is really supportive and it brings the two closer together. The fight between TJ and Reed might have been unwarranted and horrible but it did bring the three friends closer together whilst adding a new level of maturity to their friendship. The boys used to avoid the in-depth talks about their feelings and what not but now it was more of an open and safe space to share what\u2019s on each other their minds.</p><p>-</p><p>A few months later summer is a few days from ending and TJ is out biking with Reed and Lester. By now TJ and Reed\u2019s friendship was completely mended and their strained trust issues were in the past.\u00a0</p><p>The three of them are having a water break when Reed pulls out his phone and shows TJ and Lester a video his cousin had sent him of someone shooting a watermelon in slow motion. The two others express how \u2018cool\u2019 it look when it exploded but TJ\u2019s attention fades quickly after he notices he has a notification on his phone from Buffy. \u00a0Whilst Lester and Reed are watching the video again TJ opens a snapchat from Buffy where Cyrus is present in the background speaking in his ridiculous fake British accent,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m actually going to commit murder in a second.\u201d Buffy says and the snap ends with Cyrus\u2019s frowning. TJ chuckles to himself and Reed and Lester give him a look like they want an explanation.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCyrus got back from London last night and he\u2019s been using this terrible fake British accent and it\u2019s driving Buffy insane.\u201d TJ laughs.\u00a0\u201cWhich is strangely still satisfying for me even though we\u2019re all friends now.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cGive us a listen then?\u201d Reed motions with his hand.\u00a0<br></p><p>TJ goes into his text thread with Cyrus and opens the video Cyrus had sent to all his friends last night informing them he had landed. TJ was the only person that expressed how funny he found the accent so Cyrus had sent more video messages since, thus meaning TJ\u00a0had a few to show to Reed and Lester who also seem to find it amusing.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s definitely funny but I\u2019m with Buffy, I\u2019d probably snap too if he was speaking like that constantly.\u201d Lester chuckles.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo Cyrus is a funny guy?\u201d Reed questions.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s hilarious.\u201d TJ says with a lot of enthusiasm.\u00a0\u201cBut he\u2019s like funny without trying to be funny kind of funny, you know?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\"Totally.\u201d Reed says with a smirk resting on his face.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d TJ asks defensively.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not looking at you like anything.\u201d Reed says with a cute shrug and he and Lester exchange a knowing glance with one another.\u00a0<br></p><p>TJ shyly puts his phone away and Reed nudges him with his elbow before saying,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry for being a jerk about you changing. I like this TJ, you\u2019re happier.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Even thought that was a really wonderful thing for TJ to hear and they had gotten better at the sappy talks, unexpected kind declarations were still a little hard to accept so TJ clears his throat and suggests they get back to biking.\u00a0</p><p>-</p><p>Final bell for the day had rung and TJ was hanging out front of school with Lester and Reed when their conversation is interrupted by TJ\u2019s phone ringing. TJ smiles at Cyrus\u2019s caller I.D. and steps to the side to answer it. </p><p>\u201cHey, underdog.\u201d TJ greets him happily, \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI was calling to ask if you wanted to maybe help me hang posters for Buffy\u2019s \u00a0tryouts?\u201d Cyrus asks, \u201cIf you\u2019ve left already that\u2019s-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help.\u201d TJ cuts in. \u201cWhere are you now?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m walking out of the library, I just finished copying a few of the smaller posters. Ow, ow..\u201d Cyrus winces. </p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d TJ lets out a nervous chuckle. </p><p>\u201cDance class has left me with immense muscle pain.\u201d Cyrus complains. </p><p>\u201cSince when are you in dance class?\u201d TJ questions. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story, I was failing P.E. and needed an alternative but I think I\u2019ve made a mistake.\u201d Cyrus frowns to himself. </p><p>\u201cYou could have come to me for help before dropping P.E.\u201d TJ states. </p><p>\u201cYou any good at dancing?\u201d Cyrus asks. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re on your own there.\u201d TJ laughs and Cyrus does too. </p><p>\u201cOuch, don\u2019t make me laugh, it hurts.\u201d Cyrus says. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll meet you by admin in a second.\u201d TJ says with a smile before hanging up. </p><p>\u201cSo, what was that about?\u201d Reed asks with a smirk and TJ hadn\u2019t realised his two friends were watching him the whole time. </p><p>\u201cSo I have to go help hang posters for Buffy\u2019s basketball tryouts.\u201d TJ awkwardly announces to Lester and Reed. </p><p>\u201cUm weren\u2019t we supposed to hang out?\u201d Reed questions. </p><p>\u201cWe would have only been doing nothing at my house.\u201d TJ shrugs his shoulder, \u201cI\u2019m still trying to make amends with Buffy.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSure\u2026 You\u2019re ditching us for, Buffy.\u201d Reed folds his arms knowingly. \u201cSo that was Buffy on the phone asking for help?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not mad at me for ditching are you?\u201d TJ asks seriously.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAdmit you have a crush on Cyrus and I\u2019ll let it go.\u201d Reed lowers his voice and smirks.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d TJ laughs nervously,\u00a0\u201cI do not..\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cTJ, who are you kidding?\u201d Lester coaxes his head with a smile.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIs it that obvious?\u201d TJ frowns.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah only for like the entire summer.\u201d Lester chuckles.\u00a0\u201cCyrus did this in London, Cyrus did that\u201d he playfully imitates.<br></p><p>TJ pouts huffily.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou better go, I\u2019d hate for you to keep underdog waiting.\u201d Reed smirks.\u00a0</p><p>TJ frowns knowing this was a whole new thing for them to tease him about, even in a friendly way. TJ was just upset because it meant he finally had to address his feelings for Cyrus out loud.\u00a0</p><p>-\u00a0</p><p>A couple weeks later the three boys were lying around Lester\u2019s basement enjoying the air conditioning on this hot day. They were all being social, just not with each other. Each of the teens sat on their phones. TJ texts Cyrus back and forth about his canoeing escapades, laughing out loud with every new message.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou going to let us in on the joke?\u201d Reed grumbles.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d TJ peels his stare away from his phone for a moment.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cDude you\u2019ve been giggling for the last twenty minutes.\u201d Reed says.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI have not been- <i>giggling.</i>\u201d TJ says defensively but with a hint of embarrassment.\u00a0</p><p>\"Let me guess, it\u2019s Cyrus?\u201d Reed asks knowingly and Lester smiles knowing he was right.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s canoeing.\u201d TJ shrugs one shoulder.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cSo are we ever going to meet Cyrus?\u201d Reed questions.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou talk about him enough, I feel like we know him.\u201d Lester adds.\u00a0\u201cWe even helped eat the muffins he baked you last week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still not happy about that.\u201d TJ frowns.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI am, they were delicious.\u201d Reed laughs as he pats his stomach,\u00a0\u201cBlueberry macadamia, who would\u2019ve thought?\u201d<br></p><p>TJ shakes his head with a smile.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBut seriously,\u201d Reed says,\u00a0\u201cWhen are we going to meet Cyrus?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d TJ folds his arms.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Reed looks offended.\u00a0\u201cAre you embarrassed by us or something?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d TJ pops the P.\u00a0\u201cI know one of you will say something teasingly to me and Cyrus will get suspicious about my feelings and then never talk to me again.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a little dramatic.\u201d Lester laughs.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIs it though?\u201d TJ asks seriously\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cCome on, TJ?\u201d Reed pouts his bottom lip.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d TJ lets out a defeated breath,\u00a0\u201cBut you guys have to promise you\u2019ll be on your best behaviour?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be a couple of saints.\u201d Reed exaggerates an innocent smile.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll ask him to hang out on Saturday..\u201d TJ nods still a little reluctantly,\u00a0\u201cAny ideas on what we should do?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cDoes Cyrus like dirt biking?\u201d Lester questions.\u00a0<br></p><p>TJ tosses his head from side to side,\u00a0\u201cProbably not\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do that anyway.\u201d Reed insists,\u00a0\u201cIt will totally make you look cool in front of him.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah cause I totally care about that.\u201d TJ says in a mocking way and folds his arms and\u00a0Lester and Reed wear amused expressions.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo dirt biking on Saturday?\u201d Reed smirks.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d TJ lets out a heavy sigh knowing they both see right through him.\u00a0<br></p></p>",

TJ lets&nbsp;himself into his apartment knowing his mom wouldn&rsquo;t be home. TJ sets his backpack down on the kitchen counter and picks up the little post-it note left on the edge in a clearly visible spot so TJ would notice it once he arrived. The note reads;</p><p><i>&lsquo;Working late tonight but can&rsquo;t wait to hear about tryouts in the morning. There&rsquo;s a plate of dinner for you to heat up in the fridge,&nbsp;</i><i>love mom&rsquo;</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>TJ smiles to himself for a moment that she always signs her notes off with &lsquo;mom&rsquo; even though it was just the two of them and therefore no one else to mistake as the sender of the note.&nbsp;</p><p>With a hand on his stomach, TJ wanders over to the refrigerator to have a look at what was on the menu for the evening. TJ is disappointed to find a half eaten plate of meatloaf and mashed potatoes. The basketball captain lets out a heavy sigh and calls out loudly,&nbsp;&ldquo;Reed, are you here?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;In your room.&rdquo; His voice bellows from down the hall.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Did you eat half of my dinner?&rdquo; TJ grumpily closes the fridge and sulks down the hall towards his room.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I was hungry.&rdquo; Reed chuckles.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Dude?&rdquo; TJ gives him an unimpressed look once he reaches his bedroom door. The younger blonde is sitting on TJ&rsquo;s floor, his gaze focused on the small TV set as he plays the xbox hooked up to it.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>Dude.</i>&rdquo; Reed mimics TJ&rsquo;s tone.&nbsp;&ldquo;I left you half.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Gee thanks, Reed, that&rsquo;s so generous of you to leave me half of my own dinner.&rdquo; TJ says sarcastically.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome.&rdquo; Reed jokes.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You know my mom gave you that key for emergencies?&rdquo; TJ scoffs as he still hovers in the doorway.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I was bored,&rdquo; Reed says as he sits the game controller in his lap and finally meets TJ&rsquo;s gaze,&nbsp;&ldquo;That seemed like an emergency to me.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you have anyone else you can annoy?&rdquo; TJ exaggerates an eye roll.&nbsp;&ldquo;Like Lester?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Reed smirks,&nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s grounded.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;d he do this time?&rdquo; TJ asks with no inkling of surprise about his friends punishment.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even know.&rdquo; Reed offers up a shrug with a light laugh.&nbsp;&ldquo;Want next round?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>TJ thinks about the math homework he had been avoiding for two days and is conflicted for a second before ultimately accepting the controller and taking a seat beside Reed on the floor. The two sit with their backs resting against TJ&rsquo;s bed.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You seem extra stressy today.&rdquo; Reed readjusts his position to a comfier one now that he was viewing the game instead of playing.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I had tryouts today for the team.&rdquo; TJ shakes his head at his friend.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh crap, I completely forgot.&rdquo; Reed laughs.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t concerned at how long it took me to get home from school?&rdquo; TJ asks rhetorically.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d tryouts go, captain?&rdquo; Reed mockingly salutes TJ to which the taller boy elbows him in response, all the while keeping his eyes fixated on his small television screen as he plays his turn.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Everyone is pretty hopeless,&rdquo; TJ grunts,&nbsp;&ldquo;And get this right, a <i>girl </i>tried out for the team.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Why would she try out for the boys basketball team?&rdquo; Reed scrunches his face in confusion.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Jefferson doesn&rsquo;t have a girls team.&rdquo; TJ explains.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Was she any good?&rdquo; Reed questions.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s besides the point.&rdquo; TJ lets out a frustrated breath once he loses his turn.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Reed reclaims the controller for another go.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a girl.&rdquo; TJ offers up weakly.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You scared she&rsquo;s going to be better than you?&rdquo; Reed teases.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;As if.&rdquo; TJ rolls his eyes but there was some truth behind Reed&rsquo;s quip.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just embarrassing having a girl on the team.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Not if she&rsquo;s good.&rdquo; Reed says.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I just don&rsquo;t want her on the team.&rdquo; TJ says huffily knowing he had no real basis for his argument.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Is she cute?&rdquo; Reed asks.&nbsp;&ldquo;Sorry dumb question,&rdquo; He adds with a laugh.&nbsp;&ldquo;I forgot you don&rsquo;t exactly care about that kind of thing.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You know that&rsquo;s not how it works right?&rdquo; TJ frowns.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; Reed says a little nicer.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t told anyone, have you?&rdquo; TJ asks quietly.&nbsp;&ldquo;Not even Lester?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No way.&rdquo; Reed says firmly and he puts his controller down to look at TJ so he knew he was being genuine,&nbsp;&ldquo;I told you, I got your back no matter what.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>TJ nods slightly and shakes off the heaviness of the moment. &ldquo;My turn.&rdquo; TJ changes the subject as&nbsp;the pair were very rarely in-depth feelings sharing kind of friends and their discussion about TJ maybe being gay a few weeks ago had filled their sappy talk quota for a while.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Fine.&rdquo; Reed gives up the controller.&nbsp;&ldquo;Hey, you got any savings from the gym?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;A little why?&rdquo; TJ questions.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;To order pizza.&rdquo; Reed says with a cheesy grin.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What about half of my meatloaf you already ate?&rdquo; TJ asks.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It was not good, that&rsquo;s why I only ate half.&rdquo; Reed holds back his laugh.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to tell my mom you said that.&rdquo; TJ laughs.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t believe you.&rdquo; Reed says confidently,&nbsp;&ldquo;Tess loves me.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s only because she doesn&rsquo;t know half of the crap you get up to these days.&rdquo; TJ scoffs.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hey, what our parents don&rsquo;t know won&rsquo;t kill them.&rdquo; Reed smirks devilishly.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>TJ quickly comes to terms with the fact that he&rsquo;d have to use part of his latest paycheck for pizza as Reed was unlikely to let the idea go. TJ jokes that for a rich boy, Reed is often spending TJ&rsquo;s hard earned money to to which Reed rolls his eyes and assures TJ he&rsquo;s good for it.</p><p>Reed was TJ&rsquo;s oldest friend.The two met when TJ was nine and Reed was eight. TJ had just started to get into dirt biking and they met at a popular riding spot. Reed had been doing it since he was much younger and was a great help for the beginner. The two were fast friends and have only gotten closer since. In fact, there was one point in time where the two almost became stepbrothers. TJ&rsquo;s mom, Tess was engaged to Reed&rsquo;s dad, Michael but she called it off because Michael&rsquo;s all consuming work schedule was a really big issue within their relationship. Michael became quite bitter about the breakup and for sometime after he banned Reed from seeing TJ but thankfully he eventually dropped his anger towards TJ and let his son see him again. Although her relationship ended with his father, Tess is still quite motherly to Reed, hence the spare key and complete comfort Reed feels being in their apartment alone.</p><p>Shortly after they first connected, Reed introduced TJ to Lester whom he knew from school. Both Lester and Reed go to Lincoln Academy which is a private school across town, one that goes from kindergarten right through until high school. Upon introducing Lester to TJ, the three instantly clicked as a group. Lester tends to be the quietest of the three even though&nbsp;he&rsquo;s the oldest, he&rsquo;s shy around new people but when it came to TJ and Reed he showed a lot more personality. The three earn a reputation as being mischievous at times, often causing Tess great grief and trouble for Reed with his dad.&nbsp;Regardless of their reputation though, they were TJ&rsquo;s best friends. Sure he had his basketball friends at school but he misses having Reed and Lester around during his daily schedule and is at time envious they get to go to school together, even if they wore dorky uniforms, although he&rsquo;d never admit that out loud.&nbsp;</p><p>-</p><p>A day after the Jefferson Middle School&rsquo;s first basketball game of the season,&nbsp;TJ is out front of The Red Rooster flipping through a rack of records whilst Reed and Lester were inside looking at others when he&rsquo;s approached by Buffy. Buffy very maturally tries to reason with TJ but he blows her off completely resulting in some heated words from Buffy before she storms off.</p><p>It&rsquo;s only a second later that Reed and Lester exit The Red Rooster and both catch a glimpse of Buffy as she storms away.</p><p>&ldquo;What was all that about?&rdquo; Reed questions. </p><p>&ldquo;That was Buffy.&rdquo; TJ rolls his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh damn.&rdquo; Lester laughs, &ldquo;She is not what I was expecting.&rdquo; By now Reed had caught Lester up on the issue whilst they were at school together.</p><p>&ldquo;We could hear her yelling at you from inside,&rdquo; Reed appears amused.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Well she&rsquo;s officially on the team and officially a pain in the neck.&rdquo; TJ huffs.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s got personality,&nbsp;I like her.&rdquo; Reed smirks.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Well you&rsquo;re both annoying so it&rsquo;s like a match made in heaven.&rdquo; TJ replies snippily and Lester laughs halfheartedly. </p><p>Reed chuckles through a sarcastic, &ldquo;Ooo,&rdquo; before TJ rolls his eyes and walks away. </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be like that.&rdquo; Reed says as he and Lester chase after TJ.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not taking my Buffy problem seriously.&rdquo; TJ folds his arms.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;If you really don&rsquo;t want her on the team you&rsquo;re going to have to&nbsp;convince her not to be.&rdquo; Reed says.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;How am I supposed to do that?&rdquo; TJ asks.&nbsp;&ldquo;I already told her to quit.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, don&rsquo;t pass her the ball?&rdquo; Reed suggests,&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;ll quit eventually.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>-</p><p>A few weeks later TJ is shooting hoops at the court by his apartment building to let off some steam. After another failed algebra test he&rsquo;s being forced to start tutoring sessions with Buffy of all people.&nbsp;TJ grumpily makes a shot, the ball connects with the edge of the hoop and bounces backwards.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;And I thought you were supposed to be good at this?&rdquo; Reed catches the rebound, Lester is a step behind him chuckling.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m too angry.&rdquo; TJ huffs as he catches the ball Reed bounced back towards him.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s rubbing you the wrong way?&rdquo; Lester questions.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;My stupid math teacher is making me get a tutor because I failed a couple of dumb tests.&rdquo; TJ folds his arms,&nbsp;&ldquo;Maybe if he wasn&rsquo;t so boring I wouldn&rsquo;t fall asleep in his class and I&rsquo;d actually pass.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the unlucky student that gets to tutor you?&rdquo; Reed questions.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Driscoll.&rdquo; TJ says with a look of distaste.</p><p>Reed stifles a laugh, &ldquo;Now I get the whole broody basketballer mood.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Buffy?&rdquo; Lester questions,&nbsp;&ldquo;That poor girl you&rsquo;ve been tormenting on your team?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not tormenting her.&rdquo; TJ looks offended.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s met you, that&rsquo;s&nbsp;torture enough.&rdquo; Reed jokes and Lester playfully smacks his chest in amusement.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;My charming personality doesn&rsquo;t seem to be enough to repel you two losers.&rdquo; TJ rolls his eyes before lobbing the basketball towards his friends. It hits them both on a shoulder each as they failed at their attempted swerves to dodge it.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you just get a different student to tutor you?&rdquo; Lester questions.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>TJ remains quiet about all the other tutors he&rsquo;s already gone through. He had been silent about his tutoring history until today.&nbsp;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one else.&rdquo; TJ shrugs.&nbsp;&ldquo;My teacher says it has to be Buffy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tough break.&rdquo; Reed coaxes his head,&nbsp;&ldquo;You want to go for a ride, maybe take your mind off of it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; TJ sighs,&nbsp;&ldquo;I have to think of a way to get Buffy to agree to the stupid tutoring sessions so I&rsquo;m not kicked off the team.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Good luck with that.&rdquo; Lester says with a grimace.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Keep me posted.&rdquo; Reed gives TJ&rsquo;s shoulder a pat as they part ways.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>-</p><p>The following afternoon TJ&nbsp;walks into Lester&rsquo;s house after Lester&rsquo;s younger sister Kylie let&rsquo;s him in.</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re in the basement.&rdquo; Kylie says with little emotion before leaving TJ on his own.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay thanks..&rdquo; TJ says to himself before he turns towards the basement and trots down the stairs. Lester&rsquo;s basement was a nice setup, it wasn&rsquo;t quite as flash as Reed&rsquo;s mansion of a home but Lester&rsquo;s living situation was definitely a good few steps up from TJ&rsquo;s tiny apparent he shared with his mom.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey.&rdquo; Lester greets TJ, he and Reed both sit on a couch in the middle of the basement.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey.&rdquo; TJ says as he takes a seat in the free armchair adjacent to them both.&nbsp;&ldquo;So Buffy agreed to tutor me.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you manage that?&rdquo; Lester questions.</p><p>&ldquo;I agreed to pass her the ball.&rdquo; TJ releases a defeated sigh. </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it?&rdquo; Reed laughs, &ldquo;She has to teach your dumb ass and all you have to do is pass her the ball?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Dude?&rdquo; TJ gives his friend an unamused look. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just kidding.&rdquo; Reed dismisses TJ&rsquo;s sensitivity towards the joke. </p><p>&ldquo;Passing her the ball is a gateway into her wanting to stay on the team.&rdquo; TJ folds his arms. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah but it also means that <i>you</i> get to stay on the team.&rdquo; Lester highlights.</p><p>&ldquo;You guys were the ones that encouraged me to try and make her quit.&rdquo; TJ says defensively.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah but now you need her help with something so you have to adapt.&rdquo; Lester shrugs.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I guess.&rdquo; TJ sinks into the chair with a sulky expression.&nbsp;&ldquo;There was one other condition she had..&rdquo; TJ was mumbly as he said this but there was a hint of a smile that crossed his face.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; Reed points a raised brow at TJ out of confusion more than curiosity.</p><p>&ldquo;She made me get her friend a muffin.&rdquo; TJ says.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Like buy a muffin?&rdquo; Reed tries to make sense of it all.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No, we have these muffins in the cafeteria he just always misses out on one.&rdquo; TJ explains.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t get his own muffin?&rdquo; Reed laughs.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;That was my reaction,&rdquo; TJ laughs too but then softens,&nbsp;&ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s just too polite to cut in line.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;So you cut in and got him the muffin?&rdquo; Lester questions stoically, clearly not enthralled by the muffin tale.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Kind of,&rdquo; TJ shrugs,&nbsp;&ldquo;I guess it doesn&rsquo;t really matter.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well he got a muffin and you got yourself a tutor.&rdquo; Reed slaps his knee,&nbsp;&ldquo;Things are looking up.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>-</p><p>TJ begins tutoring with Buffy and much like his behaviour with the past tutors he&rsquo;s burnt through, TJ shows her little respect, all to deflect from his struggles to actually make sense of what she&rsquo;s&nbsp;saying.</p><p>In a strange twist of fate TJ winds up on the swings with Cyrus where the pair swing away their &lsquo;stuff&rsquo;. A nice moment is interrupted when Buffy finds them together and then suggests TJ might have a learning disability. TJ already thinking so little of himself, receives this poorly and storms off again.&nbsp;</p><p>On his walk home, TJ bumps into Reed who was riding his push bike. Reed hops off and pushes his bike as he walks alongside TJ.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey.&rdquo; TJ mumbles his greeting.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hey..&rdquo; Reed furrows his brows at TJ&rsquo;s off mood.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; TJ asks with little effort to fake being interested in an actual answer.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Just hanging out.&rdquo; Reed answers,&nbsp;&ldquo;&hellip;Is something up, man?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Tutoring sucks and Buffy is the worst.&rdquo; TJ huffs.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What else is new?&rdquo; Reed forces a soft laugh to make light of things but it falls flat with TJ.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to talk about it.&rdquo; TJ shrugs.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Cool.&rdquo; Reed nods and the two walk in silence for a moment.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Finally TJ speaks up,&nbsp;&ldquo;Hey you remember when we were kids and we used to hang out at the park and we&rsquo;d do the underdog trick on the swings?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Reed looks like he was searching his memory vault before an uncertain kind of realisation crosses his face,&nbsp;&ldquo;Is that where you duck under whilst the other one swings high?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s it.&rdquo; TJ says with a nod.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I remember, all the kids would do it.&rdquo; Reed smiles,&nbsp;&ldquo;Wow, I had totally forgotten about that.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Me too.&rdquo; TJ smiles to himself.&nbsp;&ldquo;Until today..&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Any reason you bring it up now?&rdquo; Reed questions.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Nah.. Just thinking about it.&rdquo; TJ brushes it off, the swing session with Cyrus had made him feel better and he didn&rsquo;t want Reed making fun of it.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Okay&hellip;&rdquo; Reed nods.&nbsp;&ldquo;So I have an idea about your Buffy problem.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh yeah?&rdquo; TJ questions.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;If she&rsquo;s not working as your tutor, why don&rsquo;t you just get her to do your homework instead?&rdquo; Reed proposes.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Like she&rsquo;d ever agree to that.&rdquo; TJ scoffs. &nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Find a way to convince her..&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>-</p><p>After Reed&rsquo;s suggestion, TJ - with Cyrus unknowingly assisting -&nbsp;managed to convince Buffy to do his homework. Although it was his intent to not pass her the ball during the game his teammates started to turn against him and he had no choice.&nbsp;</p><p>After the teams win, TJ lazes around his bedroom with Lester and Reed, snacks polluting the floor in front of the xbox set up.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Cyrus?&rdquo; Reed - who&rsquo;s over by the desk - asks.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>TJ&rsquo;s attention snaps from the game up towards Reed as Cyrus&rsquo;s name was surprising to hear coming from present company.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; TJ asks with a confused expression.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Cyrus, he&rsquo;s invited you to his bar mitzvah?&rdquo; Reed waves the invite he had picked up from TJ&rsquo;s desk around.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s Buffy&rsquo;s friend.&rdquo; TJ says casually.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Muffin boy?&rdquo; Reed asks with an amused grin and Lester chuckles.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not call him that&hellip;&rdquo; TJ frowns.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;So you and Cyrus are friends now?&rdquo; Lester questions.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah are we missing something?&rdquo; Reed presses,&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not on good terms with Buffy - his<i> friend </i>- but muffin boy is inviting you to his birthday?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo; TJ shrugs casually,&nbsp;&ldquo;Cyrus was actually the one who helped me solve my homework issue with Buffy.. Although he doesn&rsquo;t really know what part he played in that&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Is the party going to be fun?&rdquo; Lester asks.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Think you can get a couple of plus ones?&rdquo; Reed seconds the idea after picking up on what Lester was suggesting.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t even know Cyrus and it&rsquo;s invite only.&rdquo; TJ shuts down the idea quickly.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Lame.&rdquo; Both Reed and Lester say in unison causing them all to chuckle.</p><p>-&nbsp;</p><p>After Cyrus&rsquo;s crazy bar mitzvah party, TJ notifies his mom that he&rsquo;ll be staying at Reed&rsquo;s house as it was only a couple minute walk from the party venue. Once there, TJ walks past Reed&rsquo;s father Michael taking a business call in the kitchen, the two exchange a silent wave and TJ continues towards the theatre room knowing that&rsquo;s where he&rsquo;d find the guys. It was pretty late but not uncommon for Michael to still be working, after all, that is why TJ&rsquo;s&nbsp;mother called off their engagement but TJ still had a wave of sympathy for his friend, although Reed avoids all sorts of family talk, TJ knew he was lonely at home.&nbsp;</p><p>Once in the theatre room, TJ finds Lester has already fallen asleep on one of the reclining chairs but Reed was awake and watching a movie with the volume turned down low.</p><p>TJ sets himself down on the seat beside Reed and the boys lower their voices to whispers as TJ starts to share how great the party was. He left out details like the fortuneteller confirming his learning disability or Buffy roasting him but he did share a tale of Cyrus and some fancy apple cider.</p><p>-</p><p>After TJ&rsquo;s suspension from the team and some encouraging words from Cyrus he tells Mr. Coleman about his dyscalculia and his suspension is lifted. TJ also couldn&rsquo;t help himself and rubbed his good fortune in Buffy&rsquo;s face all the while he let slip about his manipulation into getting her to do his homework and coming clean about it got Buffy suspended instead which TJ was unapologetic for.&nbsp;</p><p>As TJ preps for his first game back, Lester and Reed keep him company. TJ explains what had gone down, he even opened up about his dyscalculia with them which Reed and Lester quickly deduced they shouldn&rsquo;t give TJ a hard time about. TJ goes on to&nbsp;express that he kind of felt bad for getting Buffy suspended too, she was moving away soon and he really ruined that for her. TJ also stressed that he felt guilty for saying something that would probably cause a fight between Cyrus and Buffy.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Why do you care if they&rsquo;re fighting?&rdquo; Reed questions.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Just because I don&rsquo;t like Buffy doesn&rsquo;t mean I need to go ruining her friendships with everyone else right before she moves away&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>-</p><p>School has wrapped up for the day and TJ was surprised to find Lester and Reed waiting out front. The two were still dressed in their school uniforms and they explained that they had ditched last period, that was hard to do at their private school so TJ suspects they&rsquo;d both get in trouble for it.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, TJ!&rdquo; A voice calls from some distance away. TJ peels his gaze from his friends and points it over in the direction his name was called. TJ spots Jonah approaching at a quick paced walk with a basketball gripped in his hands, which was odd to TJ because Jonah was a frisbee boy.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Lester questions as it wasn&rsquo;t any of TJ&rsquo;s basketball friends that he and Reed had met before.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Is that Cyrus?&rdquo; Reed asks.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s Jonah.&rdquo; TJ scrunches his face up.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Jonah?&rdquo; Reed wonders.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>TJ hushes his friends just as Jonah reaches them.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;m glad I caught you before you left.&rdquo; Jonah lets out a heavy breath as he was lightly puffed, he sends a shy smile to the two strangers TJ was with.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, hey..&rdquo; TJ gives him a weak smile, the only interaction they had had prior to this was during Jonah&rsquo;s&nbsp;panic attack.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I brought this for you to sign.&rdquo; Jonah holds the basketball out for TJ.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You starting a fan club for the basketball team or something?&rdquo; TJ pricks up a brow.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Jonah laughs softly and endearingly says,&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s more Cyrus&rsquo;s thing.&rdquo; TJ could feel Reed&rsquo;s side stare burning holes in him but he pretends he doesn&rsquo;t notice and Jonah continues,&nbsp;&ldquo;The ball is for Buffy. I&rsquo;m helping Cyrus and Andi put together a time capsule full of Buffy&rsquo;s memories so she has something to take with her when she leaves, I thought it would be nice if she had a memento from the team. See,&rdquo; Jonah says twirling the ball in his hands,&nbsp;&ldquo;the whole team has signed- Well, the whole team excluding you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s for Buffy.&rdquo; Reed says with a knowing look and it earns another shy smile from Jonah.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Ignore him, that&rsquo;s what I usually do.&rdquo; TJ says with an exaggerated grin.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;So, do you want to sign it?&rdquo; Jonah pulls a sharpie from his pocket and holds it out.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure that&rsquo;s even a good idea?&rdquo; TJ questions,&nbsp;&ldquo;Buffy isn&rsquo;t exactly my biggest fan.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Understatement of the year&hellip;&rdquo; Jonah laughs nervously.&nbsp;&ldquo;Signing could be like a grape vine to Buffy before she leaves, so things between you aren&rsquo;t on the worst of terms?&rdquo; Jonah suggests.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you mean olive branch?&rdquo; Lester sports a confused look.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah but I hate olives.&rdquo; Jonah chuckles and both Lester and Reed exchange a perplexed expression, almost wanting to laugh at Jonah but it was so random they were at a loss for words.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo; Jonah grins widely at TJ.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; TJ nods sheepishly and signs his name to the ball.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>After Jonah leaves, Reed and Lester lightly tease TJ about signing the ball. Joking that he&rsquo;s gone soft and mushy. TJ shrugs it off and insists he&rsquo;s happy Buffy is leaving for good.</p><p>-</p><p>After Buffy moves away TJ found it easier to be Cyrus&rsquo;s friend. They&rsquo;d often chat in the halls at school and they&rsquo;d text a little. So when Cyrus had a problem with P.E. TJ was happy to jump at the chance to help.&nbsp;</p><p>After the somersault victory, TJ and Cyrus part ways. TJ meets Lester and Reed at the movie theatre and before the previews began TJ was retelling the events of the day.&nbsp;</p><p>Lester expressed an interest in seeing Cyrus&rsquo;s list of easy things he couldn&rsquo;t do but TJ refused knowing he and Reed only wanted to make fun of it. As a&nbsp;&lsquo;boo hoo&rsquo; to TJ for being no fun his friends start throwing popcorn at him, with both Lester and Reed on either side of him TJ got quite annoyed by this and snaps at his friends.&nbsp;<br /><br />&rdquo;Calm down, Kippen.&rdquo; Reed&rsquo;s laughter halts abruptly, a hint of annoyance in his tone,&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re just having some fun.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&rdquo;At the expense of me.&rdquo; TJ grumbles.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, well, we&rsquo;re not making fun of you.&rdquo; Reed scoffs.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Right, you&rsquo;re just making fun of my friend.&rdquo; TJ looks away with an irritated expression.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Lighten up, TJ.&rdquo; Lester pats his friend on the shoulder,&nbsp;&ldquo;We were just messing around.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Fine.&rdquo; TJ shrugs and the lights in the theatre dim as the previews begin,&nbsp;&ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t appreciate you making fun of, underdog&rsquo;s list.&rdquo; TJ adds with a whisper.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Underdog?&rdquo; Lester questions and another movie goer shushes him.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>The nickname wasn&rsquo;t something TJ avoided using around other people but in his present company it felt like a slip up.&nbsp;&ldquo;Just a nickname,&rdquo; TJ shrugs it off quietly.&nbsp;</p><p>Reed points a raised brow in TJ&rsquo;s direction although the cinemas was too dark for TJ to notice. Reed thought about TJ brining up the underdog swing game a few months back and questions if TJ&rsquo;s friendship with Cyrus was something more than he originally thought.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Cute.&rdquo; Lester chuckles. &nbsp;</p><p>The same movie goer from before speaks up again, this time louder, &ldquo;Would you kids quite down please?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Chill old man, the movie hasn&rsquo;t even started yet.&rdquo; Reed calls back and TJ gives him a firm shove in the arm to cut it out.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Reed asks defensively.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Just stop.&rdquo; TJ keeps his voice low.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Alright, mom.&rdquo; Reed laughs obnoxiously and other people in the theatre were starting to get annoyed too.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>TJ bites his tongue although he really wanted to snap at Reed for saying that but TJ remains quiet because he knew Reed was purposely trying to stir him up. Reed knew TJ hated it when he called him mom, like he was being bossy or controlling which at times TJ would&nbsp;have to be because Reed often got carried away.<br /></p><p>Another woman leans forward and she looks annoyed but politely asks them to stop talking as she was trying to watch the trailers. TJ felt embarrassed by his friends misbehaving apologises to the lady and assures her they&rsquo;ll stop. Reed seems annoyed by TJ and sulks back in his seat. They watched the movie quietly, the mood definitely off between them all.&nbsp;</p><p>Once the end credits rolls they exit the theatre but the mood doesn&rsquo;t lighten up. Things still seemed tense, specifically between Reed and TJ but Lester wasn&rsquo;t at all oblivious to it.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;So, who wants to grab a bite to eat before we head back to mine?&rdquo; Lester speaks up as they walk.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I think I might just go&nbsp;home.&rdquo; TJ kicks a rock as he passes it.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re supposed to be playing the new video games I got for my birthday?&rdquo; Lester points out.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I just remembered I told my mom I&rsquo;d be home for dinner.&rdquo; TJ dips his hands into the pockets of his hoodie.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t want to hang out with us, TJ, you don&rsquo;t have to lie.&rdquo; Reed says almost casually.&nbsp;&ldquo;Your mom is working tonight.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What, are you stalking her now or something?&rdquo; TJ retorts defensively.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No, she said so yesterday when I was over for dinner.&rdquo; Reed glares,&nbsp;&ldquo;What, are you lying now or something?&rdquo; Reed mimics TJ&rsquo;s defensive tone.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Guys, chill.&rdquo; Lester looks uncomfortable by the blow up.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my fault, Kippen is such a stick in the mud today.&rdquo; Reed rolls his eyes.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Honestly, what is your problem, Reed?&rdquo; TJ stops in his tracks, annoyed by his friends attitude,&nbsp;&ldquo;Is this because I told you to shut up during the previews?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, actually it is.&rdquo; Reed scoffs,&nbsp;&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s not just today, you&rsquo;ve been constantly riding Lester and me every time we hang out.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Lester shifts uncomfortably on his feet,&nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not wrong, last weekend when we went bowling you were a bit of a buzz kill.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You guys were messing around in a different lane.&rdquo; TJ states.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;So?&rdquo; Reed shrugs,&nbsp;&ldquo;We were just having a bit of fun.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;We got kicked out, just like I said we would.&rdquo; TJ sighs.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Who cares?&rdquo; Reed still looks like he&rsquo;s in disbelief almost that TJ was arguing the way he was.&nbsp;&ldquo;Maybe we took it a little too far but you&rsquo;ve done the exact same thing with us in the past.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo; TJ folds his arms, &ldquo;In the past.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So now we can&rsquo;t have fun anymore?&rdquo; Reed asks.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have to be public nuisances to have fun.&rdquo; TJ states.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;See, stick in the mud.&rdquo; Reed looks to Lester as he motions to TJ.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I apologise for being self-aware.&rdquo; TJ says sarcastically.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be sure to act like more of a jerk when I&rsquo;m around you so you know I&rsquo;m having fun.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing a great job right now.&rdquo; Reed smirks patronisingly.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Grow up, Reed.&rdquo; TJ rolls his eyes.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Sorry we can&rsquo;t all be as mature and&nbsp;&lsquo;self-aware&rsquo; as you,&rdquo; Reed says in a mocking tone.&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve changed ever since you started hanging out with your little boyfriend, Cyrus.&rdquo; Reed states.</p><p>&ldquo;Dude, that&rsquo;s not a cool joke.&rdquo; Lester hits Reed&rsquo;s chest lightly.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Who said I was joking?&rdquo; Reed holds TJ&rsquo;s eye contact as he said it and confusion registers on Lesters face as he reads TJ&rsquo;s hurt expression.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>TJ wanted to drop everything and run away. Reed&rsquo;s comment basically outed TJ to Lester and that kind of betrayal - from Reed of all people - hurt TJ in a way that levelled with how it felt when TJ&rsquo;s dad left him and his mom.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You sound jealous.&rdquo; TJ tries to hold his own although the hurt he felt was written all over his face.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Of muffin boy?&rdquo; Reed scoffs.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>TJ wanted to say something just as hurtful back, he wanted to call Reed a clingy friend and throw his distant workaholic father in his face but he doesn&rsquo;t, instead he weakly says,&nbsp;&ldquo;Forget it. I&rsquo;m going home,&rdquo; before quickly making an exit.<br /></p><p>-&nbsp;</p><p>The Monday morning following TJ and Reed&rsquo;s&nbsp;big blowup, TJ is driven to school by his mother. Once parked, TJ remains in the passenger seat not wanting to get out. Tess tries to ask her son what is wrong but he insists everything is alright although he makes no effort to leave the car.&nbsp;Even though Tess has to get to work she doesn&rsquo;t rush her son.</p><p>Out the windshield, TJ spots Cyrus standing out front of the school with Andi and more surprisingly, Buffy. Confusion hits TJ as Buffy had been gone for two months now. Then it was as if Cyrus had sensed TJ staring in their direction because he turned his head around and makes eye contact, sending a cheerful wave over in response. TJ sheepishly returns the gesture.</p><p>&ldquo;He looks familiar.&rdquo; Tess says although she didn&rsquo;t know why he looked familiar.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my friend Cyrus.&rdquo; TJ says with a small smile.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh of course! You went to his bar mitzvah party,&rdquo;&nbsp;Tess recalls, &ldquo;I&nbsp;remember his face from the sweatshirt.&rdquo; Tess coos and TJ was suddenly feeling embarrassed. </p><p>&ldquo;Well I better get going, mom&hellip;&rdquo; TJ says picking up his backpack and Tess wishes her son a good day at school.</p><p>Cyrus is already approaching the vehicle when TJ closes the car door behind himself. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, TJ.&rdquo; Cyrus greets him enthusiastically and sends a happy wave to TJ&lsquo;s mother as she pulled out of her parking space. TJ can&rsquo;t help but smile at this as Cyrus had never even met his mother before but there he was waving like they were on a first name basis. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, underdog.&rdquo; he smiles and for a moment TJ had forgotten about his fight with Reed and the awful feeling it had left him with. &ldquo;Call me crazy but did I just see you standing with Buffy before?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;She surprised me and Andi yesterday, isn&rsquo;t that great?&rdquo; Cyrus beams.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, sure,&rdquo; TJ laughs,&nbsp;&ldquo;How long is she here for?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the best part,&rdquo; Cyrus bounces on his toes, bursting with excitement,&nbsp;&ldquo;She&rsquo;s back for good!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;No way..&rdquo; TJ says in a state of disbelief and&nbsp;just like that TJ&rsquo;s bad mood returned. Not because he didn&rsquo;t want Buffy to be here, TJ was actually happy for her and for Cyrus to have his friend back, TJ&rsquo;s mood was triggered by the idea that his friendship with Cyrus would have to revert back to the way it was before Buffy moved away which was still nice but harder for them as Buffy didn&rsquo;t approve of them hanging out. The idea that he might have lost Reed, Lester and Cyrus all in a couple of days was too much for TJ.</p><p>&ldquo;Is something wrong?&rdquo; Cyrus questions after noticing TJ&rsquo;s expression drop, &ldquo;I know Buffy isn&rsquo;t your best friend or anything but I thought you were past the whole hating her thing&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that.&rdquo; TJ shakes his head, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it.&rdquo;</p><p>\"Ah hello, have you met me?&rdquo; Cyrus laughs,&nbsp;&ldquo;Worrying is my specialty.&nbsp;Do you want to talk about it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not really.&rdquo; TJ says honestly. What was he supposed to say to Cyrus?&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;I had a fight with my best friends because they&rsquo;re whining about me being a better person?&rdquo; </i>Or<i> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m super upset because my closest friend outed me to our best friend and he did it by making a joke about you and me being boyfriends?&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;I&nbsp;can&rsquo;t force you to talk,&rdquo; Cyrus holds TJ&rsquo;s eye contact,&nbsp;&ldquo;But if you do want to, I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\"Thanks.&rdquo; TJ breaks their eye contact and goes mumbly.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;So did you want to come say hi to Buffy before homeroom?&rdquo; Cyrus tries to change the subject to make TJ more comfortable.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Did you forget the part where she hates my guts?&rdquo; TJ laughs nervously.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t hate you.&rdquo;&nbsp;Cyrus says unconvincingly.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s got a right to.&rdquo; TJ states.&nbsp;&ldquo;I got her kicked off the team right before she moved away, among other things&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Your apology to time capsule Buffy was sincere. I know you&rsquo;re sorry.&rdquo; Cyrus says firmly,&nbsp;&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s time you express that to the real Buffy? </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s&nbsp;is going to listen to me.&rdquo; TJ chews on the inside of his cheek anxiously.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;If she won&rsquo;t listen then you might have to show her instead.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going be a <i>great</i> sport during her first game back.&rdquo;&nbsp;TJ nods in agreement.&nbsp; &ldquo;All her games actually.&rdquo; TJ adds the last sentiment quickly and Cyrus smiles. TJ mirrors the grin and was quietly optimistic about the Cyrus side of his worries and that was enough to distract him from Reed and Lester for now.<br /></p><p>-</p><p>Since Buffy&rsquo;s return, her and TJ have finally made up, TJ would even go as far as calling her a friend now. That whole chapter of his life being over made TJ feel lighter now that he wasn&rsquo;t hiding behind the image he was previously trying to portray. The only thing bothering TJ these days was his distance with Reed and Lester. TJ hadn&rsquo;t spoken to either of the boys since their blowup out front of the movie theatre.&nbsp;</p><p>TJ sits on the worn down bench by the basketball court near his apartment building. He&rsquo;s extra mopey about his strained friendship today as he knew Reed&rsquo;s birthday was tomorrow and the two of them along with Lester always spent it together, even if it was just something small after school.&nbsp;TJ was just about to head inside when he spots Reed approaching and it takes him by surprise.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey.&rdquo; Reed says sheepishly as he nears.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; TJ questions and not in a hotheaded manner but a surprised one.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Your mom invited me over for dinner for an early birthday celebration&hellip;&nbsp;&rdquo; Reed stops a few steps in front of where TJ sits,&nbsp;&ldquo;I guess you haven&rsquo;t told her I was a jerk the last time we hung out..&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You showed up so I guess you didn&rsquo;t tell her either.&rdquo; TJ looks away as he speaks.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;TJ, I&rsquo;m<i> so </i>sorry.&rdquo; Reed says sincerely although it looked like he was struggling to actually form the words to say.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;For which part?&rdquo; TJ asks.&nbsp;&ldquo;For making fun of my friend? For calling me boring or for practically outing me to Lester?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;For all of it.&rdquo; Reed frowns,&nbsp;&ldquo;Especially the Lester part. That&rsquo;s the shittiest thing I have ever done in my entire life.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No argument here.&rdquo; TJ folds his arms and still avoids eye contact.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t purposely trying to out you,&rdquo; Reed says honestly,&nbsp;&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s exactly what I did and I am so sorry. I was trying to go for the thing I knew would hurt you most.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well it worked.&rdquo; TJ mumbles.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;TJ, I&rsquo;m really sorry.&rdquo; Reed&rsquo;s frown deepens.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I want to know why you wanted to hurt me so bad?&rdquo;&nbsp;TJ finally snaps his head back to Reed,&nbsp;&ldquo;Was it because I don&rsquo;t want to be a public nuisance? Because I&rsquo;m trying to be better?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been my best friend for the longest time,&rdquo; Reed says,&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been in the same sort of routine forever and it just felt like you were growing out it, out of me and Lester.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like I think you and Lester are bad people?&rdquo; TJ furrows his brows.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; Reed nods,&nbsp;&ldquo;Maybe seeing you be more responsible made me insecure about myself&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Doing what you did,<i>&nbsp;outing me,</i>&rdquo; TJ wore a look of such pain on his face,&nbsp;&ldquo;Doing that&nbsp;for any reason is a really horrible thing to do, but doing it because you&rsquo;re angry I&rsquo;m being nicer? That&rsquo;s just- I don&rsquo;t even know.&rdquo; TJ lets out a frustrated breath.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; Reed says firmly as he holds TJ&rsquo;s upset stare.&nbsp;&ldquo;I wanted to hurt you because I was hurt. It&rsquo;s stupid and no excuse.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>TJ furrows his brows,&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry if I made you feel like I was trying to act better than you or something-&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;TJ, please do not apologise.&rdquo; Reed holds his palms out to stop TJ.&nbsp;&ldquo;I was upset because I was jealous. You said it yourself,&rdquo; Reed grows sheepish,&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m jealous of muffin boy,&rdquo; Reed watches TJ&rsquo;s unimpressed expression so he softens and corrects himself, &ldquo;I was jealous of Cyrus.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; TJ seems lightly confused. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re supposed to be <i>my</i> best friend.&rdquo; Reed says and feels dorky for it,&nbsp;&ldquo;I mean I knew you were changing, I could see it, like how happy you were about passing your math test last month, just little things like that. I didn&rsquo;t really understand why but I knew Cyrus had something to do with it and at the movies I just snapped. It felt like I was being replaced or something..&rdquo; Reed lets out a nervous laugh.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Reed?&rdquo; TJ coaxes his head like he couldn&rsquo;t believe his friend felt that way.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s embarrassing, I know.&rdquo; Reed shakes his head.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not.&rdquo; TJ says nicely before admitting,&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always been jealous that you and Lester go to the same school. I&rsquo;v always felt left out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Reed seems surprised and TJ nods.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I like Cyrus. He&rsquo;s a good person and was great friend to me when I didn&rsquo;t deserve it but you&rsquo;re my best friend, Reed, you and Lester.&rdquo; TJ says firmly,&nbsp;&ldquo;It was you that came over my house everyday for three months after my dad left, it was you that took the blame when I broke my moms crystal vase playing basketball in the house. It&rsquo;s always been us, you me and Lester. We even went through chicken pox together, remember?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Lester wanted to call us the pox pals.&rdquo; Reed laughs quietly.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It was lame.&rdquo; TJ shakes his head with a laugh.&nbsp;&ldquo;You, me and Lester have always been best friends but you and me? Reed we were quite literally almost brothers&hellip; How could you ever think I was replacing you?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Reed just shrugs,&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You were the first and only person I told about being gay.&rdquo; TJ grows vulnerable again.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;And I went and broke your trust.&rdquo; Reed hates himself.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awful, I know.&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve been beating myself up about it this whole time, I&rsquo;ve been too embarrassed to come over and apologise.&rdquo; Reed says,&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m been scared you&rsquo;d not even speak to me.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What made you come over now?&rdquo; TJ questions.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I was hungry.&rdquo; Reed shrugs jokingly and TJ lets a laugh slip.&nbsp;&ldquo;Do you ever think you&rsquo;ll be able to forgive me?&rdquo; Reed softens when he questions.</p><p>&ldquo;You really hurt me.&rdquo; TJ says,&nbsp;&ldquo;But not being friends this whole time hurt me just as much&hellip; So yeah, I think I can forgive you.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Reed looks relieved and his mouth curls into a smile.&nbsp;&ldquo;So I can stay for dinner?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>TJ rolls his head forward with a laugh,&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes you can stay for dinner.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>So the trust might take a little while to build back up but for the most part TJ was happy to mend things with Reed.&nbsp;</p><p>A day after reconciling with Reed, TJ spoke to Lester whom was unsure how to approach things after the incident at the theatre. Reed had also been avoiding Lester in that time as he didn&rsquo;t want to discuss TJ&rsquo;s sexuality anymore than he already did when he made the backhanded comment that outed him. So understandably, Lester was confused about everything and unsure if he should say something to TJ or not.&nbsp;</p><p>TJ officially comes out to Lester and the older boys is really supportive and it brings the two closer together. The fight between TJ and Reed might have been unwarranted and horrible but it did bring the three friends closer together whilst adding a new level of maturity to their friendship. The boys used to avoid the in-depth talks about their feelings and what not but now it was more of an open and safe space to share what&rsquo;s on each other their minds.</p><p>-</p><p>A few months later summer is a few days from ending and TJ is out biking with Reed and Lester. By now TJ and Reed&rsquo;s friendship was completely mended and their strained trust issues were in the past.&nbsp;</p><p>The three of them are having a water break when Reed pulls out his phone and shows TJ and Lester a video his cousin had sent him of someone shooting a watermelon in slow motion. The two others express how &lsquo;cool&rsquo; it look when it exploded but TJ&rsquo;s attention fades quickly after he notices he has a notification on his phone from Buffy. &nbsp;Whilst Lester and Reed are watching the video again TJ opens a snapchat from Buffy where Cyrus is present in the background speaking in his ridiculous fake British accent,&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m actually going to commit murder in a second.&rdquo; Buffy says and the snap ends with Cyrus&rsquo;s frowning. TJ chuckles to himself and Reed and Lester give him a look like they want an explanation.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Cyrus got back from London last night and he&rsquo;s been using this terrible fake British accent and it&rsquo;s driving Buffy insane.&rdquo; TJ laughs.&nbsp;&ldquo;Which is strangely still satisfying for me even though we&rsquo;re all friends now.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Give us a listen then?&rdquo; Reed motions with his hand.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>TJ goes into his text thread with Cyrus and opens the video Cyrus had sent to all his friends last night informing them he had landed. TJ was the only person that expressed how funny he found the accent so Cyrus had sent more video messages since, thus meaning TJ&nbsp;had a few to show to Reed and Lester who also seem to find it amusing.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s definitely funny but I&rsquo;m with Buffy, I&rsquo;d probably snap too if he was speaking like that constantly.&rdquo; Lester chuckles.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;So Cyrus is a funny guy?&rdquo; Reed questions.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s hilarious.&rdquo; TJ says with a lot of enthusiasm.&nbsp;&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s like funny without trying to be funny kind of funny, you know?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\"Totally.&rdquo; Reed says with a smirk resting on his face.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Why are you looking at me like that?&rdquo; TJ asks defensively.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not looking at you like anything.&rdquo; Reed says with a cute shrug and he and Lester exchange a knowing glance with one another.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>TJ shyly puts his phone away and Reed nudges him with his elbow before saying,&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for being a jerk about you changing. I like this TJ, you&rsquo;re happier.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Even thought that was a really wonderful thing for TJ to hear and they had gotten better at the sappy talks, unexpected kind declarations were still a little hard to accept so TJ clears his throat and suggests they get back to biking.&nbsp;</p><p>-</p><p>Final bell for the day had rung and TJ was hanging out front of school with Lester and Reed when their conversation is interrupted by TJ&rsquo;s phone ringing. TJ smiles at Cyrus&rsquo;s caller I.D. and steps to the side to answer it. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, underdog.&rdquo; TJ greets him happily, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I was calling to ask if you wanted to maybe help me hang posters for Buffy&rsquo;s &nbsp;tryouts?&rdquo; Cyrus asks, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve left already that&rsquo;s-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help.&rdquo; TJ cuts in. &ldquo;Where are you now?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m walking out of the library, I just finished copying a few of the smaller posters. Ow, ow..&rdquo; Cyrus winces. </p><p>&ldquo;Everything okay?&rdquo; TJ lets out a nervous chuckle. </p><p>&ldquo;Dance class has left me with immense muscle pain.&rdquo; Cyrus complains. </p><p>&ldquo;Since when are you in dance class?&rdquo; TJ questions. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long story, I was failing P.E. and needed an alternative but I think I&rsquo;ve made a mistake.&rdquo; Cyrus frowns to himself. </p><p>&ldquo;You could have come to me for help before dropping P.E.&rdquo; TJ states. </p><p>&ldquo;You any good at dancing?&rdquo; Cyrus asks. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re on your own there.&rdquo; TJ laughs and Cyrus does too. </p><p>&ldquo;Ouch, don&rsquo;t make me laugh, it hurts.&rdquo; Cyrus says. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll meet you by admin in a second.&rdquo; TJ says with a smile before hanging up. </p><p>&ldquo;So, what was that about?&rdquo; Reed asks with a smirk and TJ hadn&rsquo;t realised his two friends were watching him the whole time. </p><p>&ldquo;So I have to go help hang posters for Buffy&rsquo;s basketball tryouts.&rdquo; TJ awkwardly announces to Lester and Reed. </p><p>&ldquo;Um weren&rsquo;t we supposed to hang out?&rdquo; Reed questions. </p><p>&ldquo;We would have only been doing nothing at my house.&rdquo; TJ shrugs his shoulder, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still trying to make amends with Buffy.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Sure&hellip; You&rsquo;re ditching us for, Buffy.&rdquo; Reed folds his arms knowingly. &ldquo;So that was Buffy on the phone asking for help?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not mad at me for ditching are you?&rdquo; TJ asks seriously.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Admit you have a crush on Cyrus and I&rsquo;ll let it go.&rdquo; Reed lowers his voice and smirks.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; TJ laughs nervously,&nbsp;&ldquo;I do not..&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;TJ, who are you kidding?&rdquo; Lester coaxes his head with a smile.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Is it that obvious?&rdquo; TJ frowns.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah only for like the entire summer.&rdquo; Lester chuckles.&nbsp;&ldquo;Cyrus did this in London, Cyrus did that&rdquo; he playfully imitates.<br /></p><p>TJ pouts huffily.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You better go, I&rsquo;d hate for you to keep underdog waiting.&rdquo; Reed smirks.&nbsp;</p><p>TJ frowns knowing this was a whole new thing for them to tease him about, even in a friendly way. TJ was just upset because it meant he finally had to address his feelings for Cyrus out loud.&nbsp;</p><p>-&nbsp;</p><p>A couple weeks later the three boys were lying around Lester&rsquo;s basement enjoying the air conditioning on this hot day. They were all being social, just not with each other. Each of the teens sat on their phones. TJ texts Cyrus back and forth about his canoeing escapades, laughing out loud with every new message.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You going to let us in on the joke?&rdquo; Reed grumbles.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; TJ peels his stare away from his phone for a moment.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Dude you&rsquo;ve been giggling for the last twenty minutes.&rdquo; Reed says.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I have not been- <i>giggling.</i>&rdquo; TJ says defensively but with a hint of embarrassment.&nbsp;</p><p>\"Let me guess, it&rsquo;s Cyrus?&rdquo; Reed asks knowingly and Lester smiles knowing he was right.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s canoeing.&rdquo; TJ shrugs one shoulder.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;So are we ever going to meet Cyrus?&rdquo; Reed questions.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You talk about him enough, I feel like we know him.&rdquo; Lester adds.&nbsp;&ldquo;We even helped eat the muffins he baked you last week.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m still not happy about that.&rdquo; TJ frowns.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I am, they were delicious.&rdquo; Reed laughs as he pats his stomach,&nbsp;&ldquo;Blueberry macadamia, who would&rsquo;ve thought?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>TJ shakes his head with a smile.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;But seriously,&rdquo; Reed says,&nbsp;&ldquo;When are we going to meet Cyrus?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Never.&rdquo; TJ folds his arms.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Reed looks offended.&nbsp;&ldquo;Are you embarrassed by us or something?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo; TJ pops the P.&nbsp;&ldquo;I know one of you will say something teasingly to me and Cyrus will get suspicious about my feelings and then never talk to me again.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a little dramatic.&rdquo; Lester laughs.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Is it though?&rdquo; TJ asks seriously&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Come on, TJ?&rdquo; Reed pouts his bottom lip.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Fine.&rdquo; TJ lets out a defeated breath,&nbsp;&ldquo;But you guys have to promise you&rsquo;ll be on your best behaviour?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be a couple of saints.&rdquo; Reed exaggerates an innocent smile.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;ll ask him to hang out on Saturday..&rdquo; TJ nods still a little reluctantly,&nbsp;&ldquo;Any ideas on what we should do?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Does Cyrus like dirt biking?&rdquo; Lester questions.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>TJ tosses his head from side to side,&nbsp;&ldquo;Probably not&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do that anyway.&rdquo; Reed insists,&nbsp;&ldquo;It will totally make you look cool in front of him.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah cause I totally care about that.&rdquo; TJ says in a mocking way and folds his arms and&nbsp;Lester and Reed wear amused expressions.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;So dirt biking on Saturday?&rdquo; Reed smirks.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; TJ lets out a heavy sigh knowing they both see right through him.&nbsp;<br /></p></p>",

TJ lets&nbsp;himself into his apartment knowing his mom wouldn&rsquo;t be home. TJ sets his backpack down on the kitchen counter and picks up the little post-it note left on the edge in a clearly visible spot so TJ would notice it once he arrived. The note reads;</p>\n<p><i>&lsquo;Working late tonight but can&rsquo;t wait to hear about tryouts in the morning. There&rsquo;s a plate of dinner for you to heat up in the fridge,&nbsp;</i><i>love mom&rsquo;</i>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>TJ smiles to himself for a moment that she always signs her notes off with &lsquo;mom&rsquo; even though it was just the two of them and therefore no one else to mistake as the sender of the note.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With a hand on his stomach, TJ wanders over to the refrigerator to have a look at what was on the menu for the evening. TJ is disappointed to find a half eaten plate of meatloaf and mashed potatoes. The basketball captain lets out a heavy sigh and calls out loudly,&nbsp;&ldquo;Reed, are you here?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;In your room.&rdquo; His voice bellows from down the hall.&nbsp;<br /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;Did you eat half of my dinner?&rdquo; TJ grumpily closes the fridge and sulks down the hall towards his room.&nbsp;<br /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;I was hungry.&rdquo; Reed chuckles.&nbsp;<br /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;Dude?&rdquo; TJ gives him an unimpressed look once he reaches his bedroom door. The younger blonde is sitting on TJ&rsquo;s floor, his gaze focused on the small TV set as he plays the xbox hooked up to it.&nbsp;<br /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;<i>Dude.</i>&rdquo; Reed mimics TJ&rsquo;s tone.&nbsp;&ldquo;I left you half.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;Gee thanks, Reed, that&rsquo;s so generous of you to leave me half of my own dinner.&rdquo; TJ says sarcastically.&nbsp;<br /></p>\n</p>",

Went to film school at USC; used to work as a writer on <i>The Tonight Show</i> before his directorial debut.</p><p><b>Buffy</b>: Doctor, Sports Medicine; originally a math major, she went to college on an athletic scholarship and graduated pre-med, top of her class. Her practice is near Marty&rsquo;s office, they carpool to work most days. She makes everyone, except Cyrus and Andi, call her &ldquo;Dr. Driscoll.&rdquo; Whenever Marty comes to the hospital for a consultation the nurses tell Buffy&nbsp;&ldquo;your husband is here,&rdquo; she rolls her eyes but she secretly likes it. She never misses the premiere of a single Goodman feature film.</p><p><b>Jonah</b>: Social Worker; he knows what it feels like to be a kid trapped in their own emotions; really just wants to help. His old band had a one hit wonder awhile back, he still plays with them on the weekends. He tries to convince TJ to join them on keyboard every time they see each other.&nbsp;</p><p><b>TJ</b>: History Professor; will not join Jonah&rsquo;s band; calls it a&nbsp;&lsquo;boyband&rsquo; every time they see each other&ndash;but turns the volume way up every time the band&rsquo;s song comes on the radio. Has a secret twitter filled with all the stupid stuff his students say; raps for the class all the time; texts them to Cyrus beforehand to make sure they&rsquo;re good. Cyrus always sends back a keysmash and like ten crying-laughing emojis. TJ cries every time he watches any of Cyrus&rsquo;s movies, even if they&rsquo;re not sad. He&rsquo;s just so proud of him.<br /></p><p><b>Marty</b>: Physical Therapist; carpools to work with Buffy; everyone at his work calls him&nbsp;&ldquo;Mr. Driscoll,&rdquo; he rolls his eyes, but he secretly likes it.
