Nothing, especially not the deaths of others, will make her love him.</p><p>She has declined over eons, only for it to fall short every time. For a being that proclaims to love her, Thanos is quick to dismiss her wishes. He is relentless, destroying planet after planet in her name.

Death is inevitable, those who fell by Thanos\u2019 hands were destined to die regardless. She is a passive force. After all, everything comes to her in the end. </p><p>The sentiment makes her arrogant and she takes for granted all of Life\u2019s gifts. There are always more left, she thought. Thanos cannot touch them all. </p><p>She\u2019s wrong. </p><p>Thanos can and he will. She should have learned of his persistence when he took his own daughter\u2019s life. When he massacred Gamora\u2019s people. When he didn\u2019t stop after the first kill under her name. After the first million. </p><p>Her folly rears its ugly head when Thanos touches her dear Merchant, Tony Stark. She could only watch as a blade slips into his flank. The cry he releases comes in tandem with her own and something akin to anger wells up. </p><p>Thanos snaps his fingers, the Infinity Gems humming with power. Her realm fills with the souls of half the universe. It\u2019s instantaneous and unnatural. </p><p>Death doesn\u2019t have a soul, but if she did, it would be crying out alongside them. </p><p>Her lovely Merchant crumples to the ground, clutching at dust. It is all the remains of her Merchant\u2019s son. The Spiderling shares no blood, but Death knows that their bond runs deeper. There\u2019s love between them, not the poor excuse that Thanos holds for her. It\u2019s sweet and pure. Precious. </p><p>She decides to interfere this once. Thanos has gone too far, overreached past his boundaries. And, she\u2019s at fault. Death at such a scale is unnatural. The beatiful gift that Life has bestowed onto her is wasted, tarnished by Thanos. She\u2019s angered, half at the being who wished to be loved by her and half at herself for allowing such a farce to persist. </p><p>Death wills herself to a tangible form in front of her Merchant. He\u2019s still grieving, still holding on to what little is left of Spiderman.

You will be reunited with your child and I will end Thanos once and for all.\u201d </p><p>She presses a gentle kiss to his temple and brushes away a loose strand of hair. \u201cDon\u2019t fret, my dear Merchant. I will restore the Universe. You will have a chance to enjoy what Life has provided for you.\u201d </p><p>With a parting smile, she leaves and reappears in front of Thanos. </p><p>He is startled. \u201cMy Lady.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThanos.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou have finally come.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo I have,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd, you have gifted me half the universe.\u201d To use gift in such a manner destroys its meaning.

Not once has Thanos listened. \u201cI am not here to accept your love.\u201d </p><p>\u201cKilling me would be the same as accepting it.\u201d It\u2019s insidious, the way his croon almost stops her.

You stain his gifts by taking their life away.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo, you would have never loved me.\u201d </p><p>She almost takes pity on him. \u201cNo. Love is not something I have privilege of having, but if I did, it would not be for you.\u201d It\u2019s a mercy that she takes his life away with a single touch. She doesn\u2019t need to make it painless. The pain already exists. Thanos has dedicated his immortal life to an impossibility. He will never be loved and that is the ultimate price to pay. </p><p>She takes the Gauntlet from his hand and slips hers through. Power hums and plies and wills her to use it. She complies once with a snap of her fingers. There\u2019s a rush of souls leaving her realm; she hears the confusion, the happiness, and smiles. </p><p>She returns to her Merchant and lays the Gauntlet in his hands. </p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asks. </p><p>She just smiles. \u201cBecause you are good. You will know what to do with this.\u201d </p><p>Death leaves without another word, dematerializing her form.

Thanos cannot touch them all. </p><p>She\u2019s wrong. </p><p>Thanos can and he will. She should have learned of his persistence when he took his own daughter\u2019s life.

You stain his gifts by taking their life away.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo, you would have never loved me.\u201d </p><p>She almost takes pity on him. \u201cNo. Love is not something I have privilege of having, but if I did, it would not be for you.\u201d It\u2019s a mercy that she takes his life away with a single touch. She doesn\u2019t need to make it painless. The pain already exists. Thanos has dedicated his immortal life to an impossibility. He will never be loved and that is the ultimate price to pay. </p><p>She takes the Gauntlet from his hand and slips hers through. Power hums and plies and wills her to use it. She complies once with a snap of her fingers. There\u2019s a rush of souls leaving her realm; she hears the confusion, the happiness, and smiles. </p><p>She returns to her Merchant and lays the Gauntlet in his hands. </p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asks. </p><p>She just smiles. \u201cBecause you are good. You will know what to do with this.\u201d </p><p>Death leaves without another word, dematerializing her form.
