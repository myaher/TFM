Catelyn cannot die again unless she is burnt or decapitated and thus is not afraid to put herself in danger for her family. Since she is a descendant of powerful witches, she is the reason her children and herself have powers.</p><h2>Robb Stark \u2013 The War Spirit</h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/53a842e9a8bdaca047390383e096b576/tumblr_pr7klvL1Cv1udspki_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"/></figure><p>Robb Stark is the first son of Ned and Catelyn. After his father&rsquo;s murder, he becomes mad with grief and fury. He gets lost in the Northern Woods where he is found by War Spirits who make him one of their own to allow him to get his revenge. He is the most prone to violence in the family and can lash out easily. He is also over protective of his family. As a War Spirit, Robb can summon a full armour, a horse and a sword to slay his enemies.</p><h2>Sansa Stark \u2013 The Witch</h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/853c6a0327fd7f69ae8971809107d87f/tumblr_pr7kloc3qN1udspki_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"/></figure><p>Sansa Stark is the second child of Ned and Catelyn.

Sansa&rsquo;s powers includes the creation of charms, telekinesis and the creation of illusions. Blood and bones can make her magic stronger but she refuses to use them and she uses runes and crystals as vessels.</p><h2>Arya Stark \u2013 The Vampire</h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4a9adbc5832d5a10e3fd4549c36e5cf1/tumblr_pr7klxtRjj1udspki_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"/></figure><p>After her father&rsquo;s death, Arya Stark runs away from home and is found by Jaqen, a vampire who attacks her.

Theon resented Ned for a while throughout his childhood because he was the judge who condemned his father and he is hesitant in joining the war. However, Jon&rsquo;s betrayal makes him realize that he truly cares for the Starks and saves Rickon on his own. He is a water spirit, just like all the other member of his family and can manipulate water.</p><h2>Jon Snow \u2013 The Hunter</h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9f3e7c46ebed0114835f24d953c92741/tumblr_pr7kljOxZh1udspki_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"/></figure><p>Jon Snow is Ned Stark&rsquo;s nephew who has been adopted by Ned and Catelyn after his birth due to his mother&rsquo;s death. He distanced himself from his brothers&rsquo; and sisters&rsquo; after learning about his true parentage. After Ned&rsquo;s death and the Starks becoming supernatural beings due to Catelyn&rsquo;s heritage, he feels even more like an outcast. After one of Arya&rsquo;s violent mood swings, the sibling of whom he was the closest, he becomes terrified and joins the Order, an organisation hunting supernatural beings, hoping to \u201ccure\u201d his family.</p>",

She has been killed but is now an Undead. She looks like a living person thanks to a charm made by Sansa but her true appearance is the one of a corpse and she is mute due to her throat being slit. Catelyn cannot die again unless she is burnt or decapitated and thus is not afraid to put herself in danger for her family. Since she is a descendant of powerful witches, she is the reason her children and herself have powers.</p><h2>Robb Stark &ndash; The War Spirit</h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/53a842e9a8bdaca047390383e096b576/tumblr_pr7klvL1Cv1udspki_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Robb Stark is the first son of Ned and Catelyn. After his father&rsquo;s murder, he becomes mad with grief and fury. He gets lost in the Northern Woods where he is found by War Spirits who make him one of their own to allow him to get his revenge. He is the most prone to violence in the family and can lash out easily. He is also over protective of his family. As a War Spirit, Robb can summon a full armour, a horse and a sword to slay his enemies.</p><h2>Sansa Stark &ndash; The Witch</h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/853c6a0327fd7f69ae8971809107d87f/tumblr_pr7kloc3qN1udspki_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Sansa Stark is the second child of Ned and Catelyn.

Sansa&rsquo;s powers includes the creation of charms, telekinesis and the creation of illusions. Blood and bones can make her magic stronger but she refuses to use them and she uses runes and crystals as vessels.</p><h2>Arya Stark &ndash; The Vampire</h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4a9adbc5832d5a10e3fd4549c36e5cf1/tumblr_pr7klxtRjj1udspki_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>After her father&rsquo;s death, Arya Stark runs away from home and is found by Jaqen, a vampire who attacks her.

Stronger and faster than human, she is prone to mood swings for a while because of bloodlust but leans to control it. She wants to avenge her father and protect her family more than anything. Arya&rsquo;s closest sibling was Jon and she is heartbroken when he joins the Order.</p><h2>Bran Stark &ndash; The Druid</h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fca2fbb9fa4cf11b5b3ac422faa781f0/tumblr_pr7klt9MIZ1udspki_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Bran Stark is the fourth child of Catelyn and Ned.

Yes you heard it folks there are people claiming that a white family\u2019s distrust of another white person is racism and I am just as flabbergasted as all of you. Allow me to give my opinion on why their lack of trust is not only completely in character but understandable. <br/></p><p>People are harping on Arya\u2019s lone \u201cshe\u2019s not one of us.\u201d line and acting as if that\u2019s a ridiculous sentiment for her to have but think about it.The Starks stay getting betrayed by people. Betrayal is what almost wiped out their house. From Ned, to Robb, Catelyn, Rickon, all were killed due to multiple betrayals. Sansa witnessed and experienced how evil and manipulative people can be to one another. She suffered under Joffrey, Cersei, her aunt Lysa, Ramsey, and Littlefinger. Arya watched the brotherhood essentially sell out Gendry right after he decided to be one of them. Jaquen sent the waif to kill her. Littlefinger tried to turn her and her sister against eachother. The Starks have been subjected to betrayal and manipulations over and over, so of course their wary on anyone else, especially someone who calls herself their Queen and will essentially be their ruler. <br/></p><p>Yes Dany fought the NK with them, but by Dany\u2019s own words to Sansa, she only came because she fell for Jon. We can argue there is more to that but that\u2019s what she told Sansa so in Sansa\u2019s mind, the person claiming to be their ruler and wanting there complete allegiance only came to help out in a situation where all life could be wiped out only made a move because she was in love. That\u2019s not a good look. I, for one, would want a ruler that claims to want to make the world a better place to practice that by helping to remove a threat to all life because its the right thing to do, not because she fell for one man. Then there\u2019s the fact that Jon keeps saying he had to bend the knee to get her help (which I\u2019ve said before isn\u2019t even true but that\u2019s the story he\u2019s telling). That\u2019s not something that inspires loyalty or trust. The Starks see Jon and know he never demanded\u00a0 allegiance before helping, but still fought hard for the living. They know their father would\u2019ve done the same. Seeing someone only move because it benefits them is not the way to earn Stark trust it only puts them on guard more. <br/></p>",

Arya watched the brotherhood essentially sell out Gendry right after he decided to be one of them. Jaquen sent the waif to kill her. Littlefinger tried to turn her and her sister against eachother. The Starks have been subjected to betrayal and manipulations over and over, so of course their wary on anyone else, especially someone who calls herself their Queen and will essentially be their ruler. <br></p><p>Yes Dany fought the NK with them, but by Dany\u2019s own words to Sansa, she only came because she fell for Jon. We can argue there is more to that but that\u2019s what she told Sansa so in Sansa\u2019s mind, the person claiming to be their ruler and wanting there complete allegiance only came to help out in a situation where all life could be wiped out only made a move because she was in love. That\u2019s not a good look. I, for one, would want a ruler that claims to want to make the world a better place to practice that by helping to remove a threat to all life because its the right thing to do, not because she fell for one man. Then there\u2019s the fact that Jon keeps saying he had to bend the knee to get her help (which I\u2019ve said before isn\u2019t even true but that\u2019s the story he\u2019s telling). That\u2019s not something that inspires loyalty or trust. The Starks see Jon and know he never demanded\u00a0 allegiance before helping, but still fought hard for the living. They know their father would\u2019ve done the same. Seeing someone only move because it benefits them is not the way to earn Stark trust it only puts them on guard more. <br></p>",

victory in our future?\u201d \u00a0Jon asks it on a tremulous chuckle, a wild\nhope, a desperate distraction from the way his hands sweat inside his gloves\nand how the wind bites just a bit too harshly along his cheeks and the way his\nbrother (his <i>brother</i> \u2013 damn what\nblood says) is looking at him with hollow eyes.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And then Bran smiles, barely-there\nand quiet as snow.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jon stares down at him unblinkingly,\nhis stomach twisting. \u00a0Bran\u2019s never\nwarged with something dead before, but perhaps there is just enough magic left\nin this world to try. \u00a0The weirwood\ntowers above them, red leaves glinting like blood in the darkness.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0

<i>always</i> Sansa, and Jon\nthinks he might not be able to hold it back if he lets it overtake him. \u00a0So he grips at Longclaw\u2019s hilt, bites his\ntongue, doesn\u2019t acknowledge the wetness at the corners of his eyes.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bran\u2019s face is blank again, his eyes\ndrifting over to the heart tree \u2013 a face of mourning, if Jon lets himself think\ntoo long about it. \u00a0\u201cBut most times I\njust see nothing at all,\u201d Bran says softly, an imperceptible ring of sorrow to\nthe words.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The noise that catches in Jon\u2019s\nthroat is half-sob, half-growl. \u00a0He closes\nhis eyes, breathes deep, uncurls his fingers from around his sword hilt. \u00a0When he opens his eyes, Jon turns to Theon\nstanding just past Bran\u2019s chair. \u00a0\u201cProtect\nhim.\u201d \u00a0It\u2019s all he can say. \u00a0All he\u2019ll allow himself to say.</p><!-- more --><p> \u00a0 \u00a0

brother,\u201d he\naffirms.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jon clenches his jaw, remembers\nTheon\u2019s cocky laugh when he\u2019d bested him the first time at archery, and the way\nhe\u2019d teased him whenever Jon refused the brothel, and the way he snuck him a pitcher\nof ale that one night when they got pissed out their gourds and Lady Catelyn\nfound them the next morning passed out in the training yard.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He remembers Theon Greyjoy. \u00a0And he remembers Theon Stark.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cLike a brother,\u201d Jon says, his\nvoice low and catching. \u00a0And then he\u2019s\nleaning down and pressing a kiss to Bran\u2019s forehead, holding it there, eyes\nsqueezed shut, and the night could take him, right there, it could swallow him whole.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But it will not have his brothers.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jon stalks purposely from the godswood,\nthe last image in his mind a tiny girl with copper hair and wolf eyes \u2013 maybe they\u2019ll\nbe Tully blue, maybe Stark grey. \u00a0He\nknows her face regardless \u2013 he sees it in his dreams, after all.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jon swallows back the lump in his\nthroat, wet eyes stinging against the cold.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This night may swallow him whole.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But it will not have his pack.</p><p>* * *</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0

Unsullied marching up the stairs to the battlements, the fog of\nwinter settling in heavier all around them. \nThe dead approach, even now.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNo, you won\u2019t,\u201d Sansa says mildly,\nher eyes shifting back to her sister\u2019s, a quiet, barely-there upturn to her\nlips. \u00a0\u201cBut it\u2019s a lovely lie.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Arya reaches for her arm, her gloved\nfingers wrapping around Sansa\u2019s elbow as she steps into her, peering up with\ndark, Stark eyes \u2013 a shadow on her face Sansa does not recognize, nor thinks\nshe ever will. \u00a0\u201cSansa,\u201d and it is as\nmuch a plea as it is a denial.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She cups her little sister\u2019s

\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Arya swallows thickly, her eyes shifting\nback and forth between Sansa\u2019s, and then she\u2019s nodding, her face still in her\nsister\u2019s hold, and Sansa leans forward and wraps her arms around her, Arya\u2019s\nface pressing into her chest, the hand not holding her staff gripping at Sansa\u2019s\nback, and the kiss she places on the crown of her

\u00a0Brienne only holds her chin higher, her\ngaze never wavering from Jon\u2019s. \u00a0She nods\nmutely, her hand already fastened to Oathkeeper\u2019s hilt. \u00a0\u201cI will shield her back, and

\u00a0 \u00a0Outside their walls, the Dothraki\nwails are as piercing as Daenerys\u2019 ream of dragonfire from the storm-grey sky.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cGet to the

she nods mutely and curls a hand in the\nscruff along Ghost\u2019s neck, his fur a warmth and comfort she hadn\u2019t thought\npossible.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jon leaves her

\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sometime between Ghost\u2019s howl and the\nthunderous beat of dragon wings against the stone ramparts, Sansa realizes her\nhand has stayed fastened to the

archers\nriddling the dead with dragonglass arrows from atop the battlements. \u00a0Sansa watches alongside them, Ghost pawing at\nthe snow nervously. \u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She settles a hand at his nape, and he\nreleases a long whine, glancing up at her. \n\u201cI know,\u201d she murmurs, eyes never leaving the dead, never leaving the carnage. \u00a0\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Because she would be out there with\nhim, if she could.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She would be out there with

is where she\nmust be.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Still, she lets Ghost howl. \u00a0She lets him howl for them both.</p><p>* * *</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0

like rotted, frostbitten grapes. \u00a0Until he is panting and ragged and war-torn. \u00a0Until the men at his back are roaring their\nrage, their desperation, and he tastes it in the air.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0How he\u2019s just so tired. \u00a0So utterly, incomprehensibly tired.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The dead Viserion releases a\nchilling screech, barreling into Drogon in the sky above, their wings a beating\nshadow against Winterfell\u2019s stones, and without warning, Rhaegal crashes into the\nnortheastern wall, blowing rock and mortar and blood-tinged snow through the air,\nharrowing the men with a rain of debris.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But that unearthly wail, that dragon\nscream \u2013 </p><p>

\u00a0Up in the clouds above, the\ntwo remaining dragons tear at each other. \nShe glances over and sees the white walkers flooding in through the gaping\nhole that Rhaegal left.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBran,\u201d she chokes out, hands\nbundling in her skirts as she races down the length of the battlements. \u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0

shouts down in answer \u2013 never needing to hear the question.</p><p>Jon\nsucks in a sharp breath, breaking through the horde and dashing into a nearby\nhall. \u00a0A clutch of air in his lungs, his\nlegs already aching as he sprints, shadow and dragon fire glinting off the\nWinterfell stone in equal measure, his sword slicing through a dead man\u2019s open\nchest cavity, his foot kicking back a jawless, mindless corpse, his grunt of frustration\nechoing through the halls as he cuts another down, and then another, stumbling\nback, barreling into someone, his sword raised instantly, eyes locking on grey \u2013\n</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0On Stark grey.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And it takes only a moment for him\nto recognize Arya\u2019s piercing, wide gaze in the shadow of Winterfell\u2019s halls before\nhe\u2019s swinging down on the wight at her back, and she\u2019s plunging the blade end\nof her staff into the dead at his shoulder.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0They stand there, panting, blood\nseeping over Arya\u2019s right eye, and he reaches for her. \u00a0She shakes it off, licks her lips, glances\ndown the hallway where he came. \u00a0The dead\nare already echoing their presence.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBran?\u201d she asks him, chest rising\nand falling

to steal Sansa\u2019s\nlemon cakes. \u00a0He thinks of how she used\nto let him.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He thinks of many things, mostly winter-worn\nand flame-haired.</p><p>

\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sansa staggers toward Bran, just a few\nfeet away, still unmoving and white-gazed. \nJust a few feet, and then he\u2019s there. \nHe\u2019s <i>right there</i>. \u00a0Her hand reaches out, her other fist clenched\nover her dragonglass, and a sweep of snow-feathered wind overtakes her \u2013 she lurches\nback, blinks against the biting wind, her eyes meeting blue, and her breath\nstalls in her chest, the white walker suddenly there and immediate and <i>there</i> and she falls back just as he swings\nat her, her elbow jarring against the ground painfully, her hip hitting the snow\nhard, and then Ghost has his jaws around the walker\u2019s arm, his snarl sharp as he\ntears at it, and she watches with wide eyes as the walker drags his ice blade\nup and slices Ghost at the stomach, up and over his hind. \u00a0Ghost yelps and releases his grip, stumbling\nback, falling against the snow, pushing up with his failing legs, and when the walker\nbrings his arms up with his blade, ready to strike Ghost with that killing\nblow, Sansa\u2019s bellow of rage lights her lungs and roars out of her as she\nscrambles to her knees, thrusting her dragonglass blade up and into its sternum,\nher grunt of pain locking her elbows, before she heaves, pushing deeper, and\nthe walker stills, mouth open in a soundless cry and the dry cracking of ice\nfills her ears and it shatters before her, nicking her cheek with the cut of\nits cold and she falls back, panting, arms aching, clawing at the ground as she\npushes herself back amidst the snow, one hand reaching for Ghost.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He\u2019s pushing up from the snow, legs\ntrembling, blood coating his white fur from his chest to his hip and Sansa\u2019s tearful\ncry tumbles out of her chapped lips. \u00a0\u201cOh\nGhost, Ghost <i>please</i>,\u201d and then she\u2019s\ncrying, and she\u2019s fumbling in the snow for her dagger and the wind hasn\u2019t stopped\nand neither

slicing the corpse\u2019s head clean off, another wight crashing into him\nand he falls back against Bran\u2019s chair, the pair of them toppling into the snow\nat Sansa\u2019s feet. \u00a0</p><p>

leaves her.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cTheon.\u201d \u00a0Her chest tightens, her breath rushing from\nher in a single, swift exhale.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The glint of ice is sudden, barely-there.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When she looks back, she wonders how\nshe saw it at all.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But she sees it. \u00a0She sees the ice-blade come down on Theon\nfrom behind, splitting him from gullet to gut, his blood spraying out over her\nface, her eyes blinking back against the onslaught, mouth parted, cry muted.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He drops to his knees, the white\nwalker blue and ice-touched and unmoved behind him.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Theon splits at the cut, falling to\npieces at her feet.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her scream rends the air.</p><p>* * *</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When he was younger, Jon used to\nwatch her in the morning light. \u00a0From his\nwindow overlooking the courtyard, he could see Sansa walking to the sept at the\ncrack of dawn, her silk gowns fluttering in the wind, her hair like spilled\nwine.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Go\nto your prayers, summer child</i>, he used to think. \u00a0<i>They won\u2019t\nbe

even still\u2026 even still he clutches\nat his chest, gloves slick with blood along Longclaw\u2019s hilt, the acrid scent of\nburning flesh stinging his lungs as he runs.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Even still he lets it fill him, that\ndangerous want, that memory of waiting at the window for the chance that she\u2019d\nturn, morning light catching her face like a promise.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It\u2019s a useless wish, the <i>wrong</i> kind of wish \u2013 for that\nwine-spilled hair spread along his furs, that silk gown at the foot of his bed,\nher mouth \u2013 her wet and parted mouth (never before parted for him, not like\nthat, at least) \u2013 pressed against the hollow of his throat.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When he was younger, things used to\nbe simpler. \u00a0He never saw the dead\nrising, he never had to placate a dragon queen, he never panted his desperation\nthrough the bloodied halls of his home.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He never used to love his sister-cousin\n\u2013 not the way he does now.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0No, their prayers have

air, her hand\nclenched in Ghost\u2019s bloodied fur, her other bunched in Bran\u2019s cloak, and then Brienne\u2019s\nthunderous shout breaks against the night fog, Oathkeeper swinging into Sansa\u2019s\ncone of vision \u2013 whispering dangerously close to her cheek \u2013 as it shatters the\nice blade into dozens of pieces, a single shard whistling through the air to\nbury deep in Sansa\u2019s thigh.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her howl of pain is not unlike a wolf\u2019s. \u00a0She barely has the presence of mind to notice\nBrienne towering over her huddled form, fighting off the white walker. \u00a0The wights rush through the Ironborn line,\nand then Ghost bites down on her shoulder and she cries out again, wincing\nbeneath the clench of his teeth through her wool dress as he drags her back in\nthe snow, stumbling in his own blood. \nThe tears are instant and hot on her lids as she grips at her bleeding\nthigh, flurries of snow blinding her vision. \nShe sees the dark, still form of Bran still laid out several feet away.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cGhost, no, it\u2019s Bran. \u00a0<i>It\u2019s\nBran</i>, please,

trembling paws even as he keeps\ndragging her and she chokes on the cry of pain in her throat. \u00a0The dark shade of the weirwood overtakes them\nsuddenly and she looks up at the blood red leaves, a glint of moonlight shifting\nthrough the branches.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0All at once, it is simple.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The terror fills her, the

snow, pushing\nGhost away at her shoulder, a wet gasp breaking from her chapped and bloody lips\nwhen he releases her. \u00a0She scrambles to\nher feet, a hand held against the wound at her thigh, limping over to Bran.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bodies drop around her and distantly\nshe thinks she hears Brienne shouting her name.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0No, the dawn was never meant for\nher, but she\u2019s a Stark. \u00a0She\u2019ll <i>always</i> be a Stark.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And Starks have never shied away\nfrom

in the carnage. \nHis throat constricts when he catches sight of Theon bloodying the\nground, but he can\u2019t linger on it, swallows it back, tastes the bitterness, eyes\nsweeping the wood. \u00a0He catches sight of\nSansa\u2019s Northern guard clashing with the wights and walkers alongside the remaining\nIronborn, and then a vicious roar catches his ears and he sees Brienne stabbing\nOathkeeper through a white walker, the shards of ice breaking over her flagging\nform, and just past her, there, a bundle of bloodied furs and snow-caught,\ncopper hair \u2013 <i>there</i> \u2013 Sansa and

\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Yes, everything stops. \u00a0And then it crashes alive again, and he\u2019s\nbolting to her, lungs aching, head pounding.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0

\u00a0 \u00a0Outside their walls, the Dothraki\nwails are as piercing as Daenerys\u2019 ream of dragonfire from the storm-grey sky.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cGet to the

\u00a0 \u00a0Sansa glances out past the ramparts,\nthe battle waging below in fire and shadow, in heartbeats and carrion. \u00a0\u201cNo, you need him. \u00a0You need Ghost out there.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jon stills just a few feet from\nher. \u00a0\u201cI need him here. \u00a0With you.\u201d \nHe doesn\u2019t grant her his gaze when he glances over his

she nods mutely and curls a hand in the\nscruff along Ghost\u2019s neck, his fur a warmth and comfort she hadn\u2019t thought\npossible.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jon leaves her

\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sometime between Ghost\u2019s howl and the\nthunderous beat of dragon wings against the stone ramparts, Sansa realizes her\nhand has stayed fastened to the

\u00a0She settles a hand at his nape, and he\nreleases a long whine, glancing up at her. \n\u201cI know,\u201d she murmurs, eyes never leaving the dead, never leaving the carnage. \u00a0\u201cI

like rotted, frostbitten grapes. \u00a0Until he is panting and ragged and war-torn. \u00a0Until the men at his back are roaring their\nrage, their desperation, and he tastes it in the air.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0How he\u2019s just so tired. \u00a0So utterly, incomprehensibly tired.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The dead Viserion releases a\nchilling screech, barreling into Drogon in the sky above, their wings a beating\nshadow against Winterfell\u2019s stones, and without warning, Rhaegal crashes into the\nnortheastern wall, blowing rock and mortar and blood-tinged snow through the air,\nharrowing the men with a rain of debris.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But that unearthly wail, that dragon\nscream \u2013 </p><p>

\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The dead push past the first trench,\nthe Unsullied signaling the retreat, and she has lost sight of Jon long ago.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The second trench lights against the\ndarkness. \u00a0Rhaegal blows straight through\nthe wall, tumbling into the courtyard amidst flame and rubble. \u00a0The screech of ice and death and far worse\nfills the air. \u00a0Up in the clouds above, the\ntwo remaining dragons tear at each other. \nShe glances over and sees the white walkers flooding in through the gaping\nhole that Rhaegal left.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBran,\u201d she chokes out, hands\nbundling in her skirts as she races down the length of the battlements. \u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0

shouts down in answer \u2013 never needing to hear the question.</p><p>Jon\nsucks in a sharp breath, breaking through the horde and dashing into a nearby\nhall. \u00a0A clutch of air in his lungs, his\nlegs already aching as he sprints, shadow and dragon fire glinting off the\nWinterfell stone in equal measure, his sword slicing through a dead man\u2019s open\nchest cavity, his foot kicking back a jawless, mindless corpse, his grunt of frustration\nechoing through the halls as he cuts another down, and then another, stumbling\nback, barreling into someone, his sword raised instantly, eyes locking on grey \u2013\n</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0On Stark grey.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And it takes only a moment for him\nto recognize Arya\u2019s piercing, wide gaze in the shadow of Winterfell\u2019s halls before\nhe\u2019s swinging down on the wight at her back, and she\u2019s plunging the blade end\nof her staff into the dead at his shoulder.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0They stand there, panting, blood\nseeping over Arya\u2019s right eye, and he reaches for her. \u00a0She shakes it off, licks her lips, glances\ndown the hallway where he came. \u00a0The dead\nare already echoing their presence.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBran?\u201d she asks him, chest rising\nand falling with her labored breaths.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He clamps his jaw shut.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSansa?\u201d \u00a0And this time her voice quakes, her eyes\nblinking back the wetness.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He has no answer for her.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Arya swallows, twirling the staff in\nher hand into a low-ready position. \u00a0\u201cGo,\u201d\nshe tells him, and then she\u2019s dashing past him, back into the fray.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jon thinks of home, of snow-touched\nweirwoods and Arya\u2019s laugh. \u00a0He thinks of\nRobb\u2019s taunts in the training yard and Bran\u2019s daring climbs atop the rooftops. \u00a0He thinks of how Rickon used to steal Sansa\u2019s\nlemon cakes. \u00a0He thinks of how she used\nto let him.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He thinks of many things, mostly winter-worn\nand flame-haired.</p><p>

\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sansa staggers toward Bran, just a few\nfeet away, still unmoving and white-gazed. \nJust a few feet, and then he\u2019s there. \nHe\u2019s <i>right there</i>. \u00a0Her hand reaches out, her other fist clenched\nover her dragonglass, and a sweep of snow-feathered wind overtakes her \u2013 she lurches\nback, blinks against the biting wind, her eyes meeting blue, and her breath\nstalls in her chest, the white walker suddenly there and immediate and <i>there</i> and she falls back just as he swings\nat her, her elbow jarring against the ground painfully, her hip hitting the snow\nhard, and then Ghost has his jaws around the walker\u2019s arm, his snarl sharp as he\ntears at it, and she watches with wide eyes as the walker drags his ice blade\nup and slices Ghost at the stomach, up and over his hind. \u00a0Ghost yelps and releases his grip, stumbling\nback, falling against the snow, pushing up with his failing legs, and when the walker\nbrings his arms up with his blade, ready to strike Ghost with that killing\nblow, Sansa\u2019s bellow of rage lights her lungs and roars out of her as she\nscrambles to her knees, thrusting her dragonglass blade up and into its sternum,\nher grunt of pain locking her elbows, before she heaves, pushing deeper, and\nthe walker stills, mouth open in a soundless cry and the dry cracking of ice\nfills her ears and it shatters before her, nicking her cheek with the cut of\nits cold and she falls back, panting, arms aching, clawing at the ground as she\npushes herself back amidst the snow, one hand reaching for Ghost.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He\u2019s pushing up from the snow, legs\ntrembling, blood coating his white fur from his chest to his hip and Sansa\u2019s tearful\ncry tumbles out of her chapped lips. \u00a0\u201cOh\nGhost, Ghost <i>please</i>,\u201d and then she\u2019s\ncrying, and she\u2019s fumbling in the snow for her dagger and the wind hasn\u2019t stopped\nand neither have the screams and then her hand lights along her dagger,\nhobbling to a stand just as she hears the snarl of a wight bearing down on\nher. \u00a0And then it\u2019s Theon at her shoulder,\nhis blade slicing the corpse\u2019s head clean off, another wight crashing into him\nand he falls back against Bran\u2019s chair, the pair of them toppling into the snow\nat Sansa\u2019s feet. \u00a0</p><p>

\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSansa, get up,\u201d Theon urges,\npanting, reaching for her, his hair matted in blood, his left arm bent at an\nunnatural angle, and she can\u2019t control the sob that

his bed,\nher mouth \u2013 her wet and parted mouth (never before parted for him, not like\nthat, at least) \u2013 pressed against the hollow of his throat.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When he was younger, things used to\nbe simpler. \u00a0He never saw the dead\nrising, he never had to placate a dragon queen, he never panted his desperation\nthrough the bloodied halls of his

Sansa\u2019s\ncone of vision \u2013 whispering dangerously close to her cheek \u2013 as it shatters the\nice blade into dozens of pieces, a single shard whistling through the air to\nbury deep in

through her wool dress as he drags her back in\nthe snow, stumbling in his own blood. \nThe tears are instant and hot on her lids as she grips at her bleeding\nthigh, flurries of snow blinding her

in the carnage. \nHis throat constricts when he catches sight of Theon bloodying the\nground, but he can\u2019t linger on it, swallows it back, tastes the bitterness, eyes\nsweeping the wood. \u00a0He catches sight of\nSansa\u2019s Northern guard clashing with the wights and walkers alongside the remaining\nIronborn, and then a vicious roar catches his ears and he sees Brienne stabbing\nOathkeeper through a white walker, the shards of ice breaking over her flagging\nform, and just past her, there, a bundle of bloodied furs and snow-caught,\ncopper hair \u2013 <i>there</i> \u2013 Sansa and

falters. \u00a0She licks her lips, shakes her head, looks\nahead as her horse trots beside Sansa\u2019s dilapidated cart, Brienne and Podrick\ntugging her along.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bran lays beside her under the furs,\nhis breathing low and uneven. \u00a0She\nstrokes Ghost\u2019s head in her lap, eyes locked on the smoke-lined horizon where\nWinterfell used to stand, growing ever smaller in the distance. \u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s\na grey dawn, a dawn she hadn\u2019t meant to see.</p><p>No\ndragon wings beat overhead. \u00a0No banners\nfly amidst their meager

any kind of answer.</p><p>Arya\nkeeps her eyes fixed to the path \u2013 fixed to the South.</p><p>Ghost\nwhines lowly into her skirts, tongue flicking out to lick at the gash along her\nthigh, the ice shard since melted into her flesh, tainting her skin with a permanent\nfreeze, an everlasting cold. \u00a0</p><p>Sansa\nsoothes Ghost back to stillness, calmly, without trembling.</p><p>She\nlooks back across the horizon.</p><p>She\nlooks back at a lost Winterfell.</p><p>She\nlooks back at her last, her only, her greatest regret.</p><p>To\nlove is to breathe in, to inhale. \u00a0Sansa\ntakes a deep, stinging gulp, and then swiftly \u2013 </p><p>(to\nlose is to exhale) </p><p>\u2013\nshe breathes it out.</p>",

harshly along his cheeks and the way his\nbrother (his <i>brother</i> \u2013 damn what\nblood says) is looking at him with hollow eyes.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And then Bran

before, but perhaps there is just enough magic left\nin this world to try. \u00a0The weirwood\ntowers above them, red leaves glinting like blood in the darkness.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0

\u00a0The noise that catches in Jon\u2019s\nthroat is half-sob, half-growl. \u00a0He closes\nhis eyes, breathes deep, uncurls his fingers from around his sword hilt. \u00a0When he opens his eyes, Jon turns to Theon\nstanding just past Bran\u2019s chair. \u00a0\u201cProtect\nhim.\u201d \u00a0It\u2019s all he can say. \u00a0All he\u2019ll allow himself to say.</p>[[MORE]]<p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0

way\nhe\u2019d teased him whenever Jon refused the brothel, and the way he snuck him a pitcher\nof ale that one night when they got pissed out their gourds and Lady Catelyn\nfound them the next morning passed out in the training yard.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He remembers Theon Greyjoy. \u00a0And he remembers Theon Stark.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cLike a brother,\u201d Jon says, his\nvoice low and catching. \u00a0And then he\u2019s\nleaning down and pressing a kiss to Bran\u2019s forehead, holding it there, eyes\nsqueezed shut, and the night could take him, right there, it could swallow him whole.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But it will not have his brothers.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0

\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Arya reaches for her arm, her gloved\nfingers wrapping around Sansa\u2019s elbow as she steps into her, peering up with\ndark, Stark eyes \u2013 a shadow on her face Sansa does not recognize, nor thinks\nshe ever will. \u00a0\u201cSansa,\u201d and it is as\nmuch a plea as it is a denial.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She cups her little sister\u2019s

\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Arya swallows thickly, her eyes shifting\nback and forth between Sansa\u2019s, and then she\u2019s nodding, her face still in her\nsister\u2019s hold, and Sansa leans forward and wraps her arms around her, Arya\u2019s\nface pressing into her chest, the hand not holding her staff gripping at Sansa\u2019s\nback, and the kiss she places on the crown of her

she nods mutely and curls a hand in the\nscruff along Ghost\u2019s neck, his fur a warmth and comfort she hadn\u2019t thought\npossible.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jon leaves her

\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sometime between Ghost\u2019s howl and the\nthunderous beat of dragon wings against the stone ramparts, Sansa realizes her\nhand has stayed fastened to the

\u00a0She settles a hand at his nape, and he\nreleases a long whine, glancing up at her. \n\u201cI know,\u201d she murmurs, eyes never leaving the dead, never leaving the carnage. \u00a0\u201cI

like rotted, frostbitten grapes. \u00a0Until he is panting and ragged and war-torn. \u00a0Until the men at his back are roaring their\nrage, their desperation, and he tastes it in the air.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0How he\u2019s just so tired. \u00a0So utterly, incomprehensibly tired.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The dead Viserion releases a\nchilling screech, barreling into Drogon in the sky above, their wings a beating\nshadow against Winterfell\u2019s stones, and without warning, Rhaegal crashes into the\nnortheastern wall, blowing rock and mortar and blood-tinged snow through the air,\nharrowing the men with a rain of debris.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But that unearthly wail, that dragon\nscream \u2013 </p><p>

\u00a0Up in the clouds above, the\ntwo remaining dragons tear at each other. \nShe glances over and sees the white walkers flooding in through the gaping\nhole that Rhaegal left.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBran,\u201d she chokes out, hands\nbundling in her skirts as she races down the length of the battlements. \u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0

shouts down in answer \u2013 never needing to hear the question.</p><p>Jon\nsucks in a sharp breath, breaking through the horde and dashing into a nearby\nhall. \u00a0A clutch of air in his lungs, his\nlegs already aching as he sprints, shadow and dragon fire glinting off the\nWinterfell stone in equal measure, his sword slicing through a dead man\u2019s open\nchest cavity, his foot kicking back a jawless, mindless corpse, his grunt of frustration\nechoing through the halls as he cuts another down, and then another, stumbling\nback, barreling into someone, his sword raised instantly, eyes locking on grey \u2013\n</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0On Stark grey.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And it takes only a moment for him\nto recognize Arya\u2019s piercing, wide gaze in the shadow of Winterfell\u2019s halls before\nhe\u2019s swinging down on the wight at her back, and she\u2019s plunging the blade end\nof her staff into the dead at his shoulder.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0They stand there, panting, blood\nseeping over Arya\u2019s right eye, and he reaches for her. \u00a0She shakes it off, licks her lips, glances\ndown the hallway where he came. \u00a0The dead\nare already echoing their presence.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBran?\u201d she asks him, chest rising\nand falling with her labored breaths.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He clamps his jaw shut.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSansa?\u201d \u00a0And this time her voice

in\nher hand into a low-ready position. \u00a0\u201cGo,\u201d\nshe tells him, and then she\u2019s dashing past him, back into the fray.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jon thinks of home, of snow-touched\nweirwoods and Arya\u2019s laugh. \u00a0He thinks of\nRobb\u2019s taunts in the training yard and Bran\u2019s daring climbs atop the rooftops. \u00a0He thinks of how Rickon used to steal Sansa\u2019s\nlemon cakes. \u00a0He thinks of how she used\nto let him.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He thinks of many things, mostly winter-worn\nand flame-haired.</p><p>

lighting the air as blindingly as its blue\nfire, Drogon\u2019s accompanying roars a thunderous rush in their scream-filled wood. \u00a0Men die at her left. \u00a0They die at her right.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sansa staggers toward Bran, just a few\nfeet away, still unmoving and white-gazed. \nJust a few feet, and then he\u2019s there. \nHe\u2019s <i>right there</i>. \u00a0Her hand reaches out, her other fist clenched\nover her dragonglass, and a sweep of snow-feathered wind overtakes her \u2013 she lurches\nback, blinks against the biting wind, her eyes meeting blue, and her breath\nstalls in her chest, the white walker suddenly there and immediate and <i>there</i> and she falls back just as he swings\nat her, her elbow jarring against the ground painfully, her hip hitting the snow\nhard, and then Ghost has his jaws around the walker\u2019s arm, his snarl sharp as he\ntears at it, and she watches with wide eyes as the walker drags his ice blade\nup and slices Ghost at the stomach, up and over his hind. \u00a0Ghost yelps and releases his grip, stumbling\nback, falling against the snow, pushing up with his failing legs, and when the walker\nbrings his arms up with his blade, ready to strike Ghost with that killing\nblow, Sansa\u2019s bellow of rage lights her lungs and roars out of her as she\nscrambles to her knees, thrusting her dragonglass blade up and into its sternum,\nher grunt of pain locking her elbows, before she heaves, pushing deeper, and\nthe walker stills, mouth open in a soundless cry and the dry cracking of ice\nfills her ears and it shatters before her, nicking her cheek with the cut of\nits cold and she falls back, panting, arms aching, clawing at the ground as she\npushes herself back amidst the snow, one hand reaching for Ghost.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He\u2019s pushing up from the snow, legs\ntrembling, blood coating his white fur from his chest to his hip and Sansa\u2019s tearful\ncry tumbles out of her chapped lips. \u00a0\u201cOh\nGhost, Ghost <i>please</i>,\u201d and then she\u2019s\ncrying, and she\u2019s fumbling in the snow for her dagger and the wind hasn\u2019t stopped\nand neither have the screams and then her hand lights along her dagger,\nhobbling to a stand just as she hears the snarl of a wight bearing down on\nher. \u00a0And then it\u2019s Theon at her shoulder,\nhis blade slicing the corpse\u2019s head clean off, another wight crashing into him\nand he falls back against Bran\u2019s chair, the pair of them toppling into the snow\nat Sansa\u2019s feet. \u00a0</p><p>

her vision going white for a terrifyingly long\nsecond. \u00a0A pair of boots enter her vision\nand she snaps her gaze up, sharp blue eyes wide and terror-tinged. \u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSansa, get up,\u201d Theon urges,\npanting, reaching for her, his hair matted in blood, his left arm bent at an\nunnatural angle, and she can\u2019t control the sob that

onslaught, mouth parted, cry muted.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He drops to his knees, the white\nwalker blue and ice-touched and unmoved behind him.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0

\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Even still he lets it fill him, that\ndangerous want, that memory of waiting at the window for the chance that she\u2019d\nturn, morning light catching her face like a

Sansa\u2019s\ncone of vision \u2013 whispering dangerously close to her cheek \u2013 as it shatters the\nice blade into dozens of pieces, a single shard whistling through the air to\nbury deep in

through her wool dress as he drags her back in\nthe snow, stumbling in his own blood. \nThe tears are instant and hot on her lids as she grips at her bleeding\nthigh, flurries of snow blinding her

&nbsp;&ldquo;So, what do you say, Bran? &nbsp;Is there a victory in our future?&rdquo; &nbsp;Jon asks it on a tremulous chuckle, a wild\nhope, a desperate distraction from the way his hands sweat inside his gloves\nand how the wind bites just a bit too harshly along his cheeks and the way his\nbrother (his <i>brother</i> &ndash; damn what\nblood says) is looking at him with hollow eyes.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And then Bran smiles, barely-there\nand quiet as snow.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jon stares down at him unblinkingly,\nhis stomach twisting. &nbsp;Bran&rsquo;s never\nwarged with something dead before, but perhaps there is just enough magic left\nin this world to try. &nbsp;The weirwood\ntowers above them, red leaves glinting like blood in the darkness.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Sometimes I see a little girl with\nred hair.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jon sucks in a sharp breath, face\nfalling.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bran tilts his head, as though in\ncontemplation. &nbsp;&ldquo;She has your eyes.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And then it is Sansa, and only\nSansa, and <i>always</i> Sansa, and Jon\nthinks he might not be able to hold it back if he lets it overtake him. &nbsp;So he grips at Longclaw&rsquo;s hilt, bites his\ntongue, doesn&rsquo;t acknowledge the wetness at the corners of his eyes.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bran&rsquo;s face is blank again, his eyes\ndrifting over to the heart tree &ndash; a face of mourning, if Jon lets himself think\ntoo long about it. &nbsp;&ldquo;But most times I\njust see nothing at all,&rdquo; Bran says softly, an imperceptible ring of sorrow to\nthe words.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The noise that catches in Jon&rsquo;s\nthroat is half-sob, half-growl. &nbsp;He closes\nhis eyes, breathes deep, uncurls his fingers from around his sword hilt. &nbsp;When he opens his eyes, Jon turns to Theon\nstanding just past Bran&rsquo;s chair. &nbsp;&ldquo;Protect\nhim.&rdquo; &nbsp;It&rsquo;s all he can say. &nbsp;All he&rsquo;ll allow himself to say.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Not <i>for us</i> or <i>for Sansa</i> or <i>please</i>.)</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Theon nods, one hand already fitted\nto his bow. &nbsp;&ldquo;Like a brother,&rdquo; he\naffirms.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jon clenches his jaw, remembers\nTheon&rsquo;s cocky laugh when he&rsquo;d bested him the first time at archery, and the way\nhe&rsquo;d teased him whenever Jon refused the brothel, and the way he snuck him a pitcher\nof ale that one night when they got pissed out their gourds and Lady Catelyn\nfound them the next morning passed out in the training yard.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He remembers Theon Greyjoy. &nbsp;And he remembers Theon Stark.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Like a brother,&rdquo; Jon says, his\nvoice low and catching. &nbsp;And then he&rsquo;s\nleaning down and pressing a kiss to Bran&rsquo;s forehead, holding it there, eyes\nsqueezed shut, and the night could take him, right there, it could swallow him whole.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But it will not have his brothers.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jon stalks purposely from the godswood,\nthe last image in his mind a tiny girl with copper hair and wolf eyes &ndash; maybe they&rsquo;ll\nbe Tully blue, maybe Stark grey. &nbsp;He\nknows her face regardless &ndash; he sees it in his dreams, after all.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jon swallows back the lump in his\nthroat, wet eyes stinging against the cold.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This night may swallow him whole.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But it will not have his pack.</p><p>* * *</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come for you,&rdquo; Arya tells her,\nher glass-gilded staff tight in her grip.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sansa peers past her sister&rsquo;s\nshoulder to the Unsullied marching up the stairs to the battlements, the fog of\nwinter settling in heavier all around them. \nThe dead approach, even now.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;No, you won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Sansa says mildly,\nher eyes shifting back to her sister&rsquo;s, a quiet, barely-there upturn to her\nlips. &nbsp;&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a lovely lie.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Arya reaches for her arm, her gloved\nfingers wrapping around Sansa&rsquo;s elbow as she steps into her, peering up with\ndark, Stark eyes &ndash; a shadow on her face Sansa does not recognize, nor thinks\nshe ever will. &nbsp;&ldquo;Sansa,&rdquo; and it is as\nmuch a plea as it is a denial.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She cups her little sister&rsquo;s face in\nher hands, the tears sudden and bright and stinging against her lashes. &nbsp;&ldquo;Show them what it means to be a\nNortherner. &nbsp;Show them what it means to\nbe a Stark.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Arya swallows thickly, her eyes shifting\nback and forth between Sansa&rsquo;s, and then she&rsquo;s nodding, her face still in her\nsister&rsquo;s hold, and Sansa leans forward and wraps her arms around her, Arya&rsquo;s\nface pressing into her chest, the hand not holding her staff gripping at Sansa&rsquo;s\nback, and the kiss she places on the crown of her head is both trembling and\ntrue.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Winter is here,&rdquo; she breathes\nagainst her sister&rsquo;s hair, and Arya sighs into her embrace. &nbsp;&ldquo;But so are the wolves.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come for you,&rdquo; Arya repeats,\nher fingers digging into her cloak, her breath a rattle against her chest. &nbsp;&ldquo;No matter what you say, I&rsquo;ll come for you.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sansa holds a hand to the back of\nher head, breathes her in, and when the time comes to let her go &ndash; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She lets her go.</p><p>* * *</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Sansa gets out alive, do you understand?&rdquo;\nJon commands Brienne, his eyes fervent, the torchlight casting slants of shadow\nthat flicker threateningly over his features.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brienne only holds her chin higher, her\ngaze never wavering from Jon&rsquo;s. &nbsp;She nods\nmutely, her hand already fastened to Oathkeeper&rsquo;s hilt. &nbsp;&ldquo;I will shield her back, and keep her council,\nand give my life for hers, if need be.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jon heaves a heavy sigh, his face a\nfallen ruin when he recognizes the words. \n&ldquo;The need may be,&rdquo; he answers hollowly, his shoulders slumping\nslightly. &nbsp;&ldquo;Tonight,&rdquo; he finishes.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I keep my oaths,&rdquo; Brienne replies solemnly,\ntitling her head in a final, farewell nod, before she turns from him to join\nher regiment.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jon feels something sink inside him &ndash;\nheavy and worn like a drowned stone, falling straight through the current,\ndeep-sought.</p><p>* * *</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The screams are instant. &nbsp;The light is less so.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sansa takes in the shadowy collision\nof the first charge from her position along the battlements, her guard of Stark\nmen at her back. &nbsp;Her chest aches, her\nterror a tight knot in her belly, her thumb worrying a hole through the glove covering\nher other palm.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jon is beside her suddenly, Ghost at\nhis heels. &nbsp;&ldquo;Sansa.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She turns to him, and everything\nfalls away.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Outside their walls, the Dothraki\nwails are as piercing as Daenerys&rsquo; ream of dragonfire from the storm-grey sky.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Get to the crypts.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He huffs a single, impatient breath,\nhis brow angling sharply down. &nbsp;&ldquo;Sansa,\nthis isn&rsquo;t &ndash; &rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I <i>won&rsquo;t</i>,&rdquo; she says again, shoulders stiffening, her hand reaching for\nthe dragonglass at her belt, curling around the uneven hilt beneath the cover\nof her cloak.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jon eyes her steadily, and then he&rsquo;s\nshaking his head, his gaze looking out past the wall. &nbsp;He sighs, and it takes all of him. &nbsp;&ldquo;Ghost will stay,&rdquo; he says lowly as he begins\nto stalk away.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sansa glances out past the ramparts,\nthe battle waging below in fire and shadow, in heartbeats and carrion. &nbsp;&ldquo;No, you need him. &nbsp;You need Ghost out there.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jon stills just a few feet from\nher. &nbsp;&ldquo;I need him here. &nbsp;With you.&rdquo; \nHe doesn&rsquo;t grant her his gaze when he glances over his shoulder, his\neyes instead on the grey stone at her side, the Winterfell around her.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She will not argue, not now. &nbsp;Not here, at the end. &nbsp;So she nods mutely and curls a hand in the\nscruff along Ghost&rsquo;s neck, his fur a warmth and comfort she hadn&rsquo;t thought\npossible.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jon leaves her then.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She watches, words dying on her tongue.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Breathe in &ndash; hold it tight to your\nchest.)</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sometime between Ghost&rsquo;s howl and the\nthunderous beat of dragon wings against the stone ramparts, Sansa realizes her\nhand has stayed fastened to the dragonglass dagger at her hip.</p><p>* * *</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jon looks around the courtyard at\nthe open gates, ready to flood the field and reinforce the first wave of their\nforces already fighting the dead. &nbsp;He\nlooks at the Hornwoods and the Mormonts and the Cerwyns. &nbsp;The Flints and the Karstarks and the Manderlys. &nbsp;The Tallharts, the Dustins, the Dormunds. &nbsp;The Whitehills, the Glenmores, the\nForrestors. &nbsp;The staunch and the proud\nand the <i>Northern</i>. &nbsp;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jon glances down the line. &nbsp;First left, then right. &nbsp;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rhaegal screeches in the dark clouds\nabove.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But it&rsquo;s his brothers, his northmen &ndash;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(the heavy lull of their breathing, and\nthe curl of their gloved fists over dragonglass, and the shuffle of their\nanxious feet in the snow &ndash; blaring even over the hoarse screams and clash of\nbattle just past the gates)</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jon knows what it means to fight for\nhome.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Tully eyes and hair like flame and a\nmouth that cuts as fine and true as steel)</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;For the North!&rdquo; he yells, Longclaw\nraised, his chest heaving, eyes wide, the storm bearing down.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For more than the North, he promises\n&ndash; silent, steady, true.</p><p>* * *</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The first trench lights magnificently,\nthe Northern forces drawing back behind the flames, the Dothraki and wildling archers\nriddling the dead with dragonglass arrows from atop the battlements. &nbsp;Sansa watches alongside them, Ghost pawing at\nthe snow nervously. &nbsp;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She settles a hand at his nape, and he\nreleases a long whine, glancing up at her. \n&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she murmurs, eyes never leaving the dead, never leaving the carnage. &nbsp;&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Because she would be out there with\nhim, if she could.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She would be out there with him,\nblade in hand, heart at her throat, back to his, if only she could.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But she can&rsquo;t &ndash; and she&rsquo;s the first\nto acknowledge what a hindrance she&rsquo;d be.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She can only be this. &nbsp;She can only be the Lady of Winterfell.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And when she looks out across the\nline of soldiers manning the wall, her thunderous shouts of &ldquo;Nock&rdquo; and &ldquo;Draw&rdquo;\nand &ldquo;Loose&rdquo; echoing through the snow-strewn night, she knows this is where she\nmust be.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Still, she lets Ghost howl. &nbsp;She lets him howl for them both.</p><p>* * *</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jon cuts them down. &nbsp;One at a time. &nbsp;Sometimes two. &nbsp;Another and then another, until his blade is\nblack-slick and copper-lined. &nbsp;Until the dead\nsquelch beneath his boots like rotted, frostbitten grapes. &nbsp;Until he is panting and ragged and war-torn. &nbsp;Until the men at his back are roaring their\nrage, their desperation, and he tastes it in the air.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How he&rsquo;s just so tired. &nbsp;So utterly, incomprehensibly tired.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The dead Viserion releases a\nchilling screech, barreling into Drogon in the sky above, their wings a beating\nshadow against Winterfell&rsquo;s stones, and without warning, Rhaegal crashes into the\nnortheastern wall, blowing rock and mortar and blood-tinged snow through the air,\nharrowing the men with a rain of debris.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But that unearthly wail, that dragon\nscream &ndash; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His skin lights with the terror.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Bran,&rdquo; he breathes beneath the\nblood. &nbsp;And then he&rsquo;s sprinting for the fallen\nwall.</p><p>* * *</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Sansa whispers, the snow-blurred\nsky alight with dragon fire.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The dead push past the first trench,\nthe Unsullied signaling the retreat, and she has lost sight of Jon long ago.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The second trench lights against the\ndarkness. &nbsp;Rhaegal blows straight through\nthe wall, tumbling into the courtyard amidst flame and rubble. &nbsp;The screech of ice and death and far worse\nfills the air. &nbsp;Up in the clouds above, the\ntwo remaining dragons tear at each other. \nShe glances over and sees the white walkers flooding in through the gaping\nhole that Rhaegal left.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Bran,&rdquo; she chokes out, hands\nbundling in her skirts as she races down the length of the battlements. &nbsp;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;My lady!&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Hold the line, Ser Davos!&rdquo; she\ncalls back, never slowing her run, her Stark guard at her heels, Ghost already\nbounding ahead.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Beneath their walls, the dead are\nfalling, and they are rising.</p><p>* * *</p><p>He\nmakes it to the overrun training yard when Davos calls to him from above. &nbsp;Jon&rsquo;s eyes snap up, instantly searching for\ncopper hair amidst the chaos of the battlements, and finding none.</p><p>&ldquo;The\ngodswood!&rdquo; Davos shouts down in answer &ndash; never needing to hear the question.</p><p>Jon\nsucks in a sharp breath, breaking through the horde and dashing into a nearby\nhall. &nbsp;A clutch of air in his lungs, his\nlegs already aching as he sprints, shadow and dragon fire glinting off the\nWinterfell stone in equal measure, his sword slicing through a dead man&rsquo;s open\nchest cavity, his foot kicking back a jawless, mindless corpse, his grunt of frustration\nechoing through the halls as he cuts another down, and then another, stumbling\nback, barreling into someone, his sword raised instantly, eyes locking on grey &ndash;\n</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On Stark grey.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And it takes only a moment for him\nto recognize Arya&rsquo;s piercing, wide gaze in the shadow of Winterfell&rsquo;s halls before\nhe&rsquo;s swinging down on the wight at her back, and she&rsquo;s plunging the blade end\nof her staff into the dead at his shoulder.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They stand there, panting, blood\nseeping over Arya&rsquo;s right eye, and he reaches for her. &nbsp;She shakes it off, licks her lips, glances\ndown the hallway where he came. &nbsp;The dead\nare already echoing their presence.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Bran?&rdquo; she asks him, chest rising\nand falling with her labored breaths.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He clamps his jaw shut.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Sansa?&rdquo; &nbsp;And this time her voice quakes, her eyes\nblinking back the wetness.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He has no answer for her.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Arya swallows, twirling the staff in\nher hand into a low-ready position. &nbsp;&ldquo;Go,&rdquo;\nshe tells him, and then she&rsquo;s dashing past him, back into the fray.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jon thinks of home, of snow-touched\nweirwoods and Arya&rsquo;s laugh. &nbsp;He thinks of\nRobb&rsquo;s taunts in the training yard and Bran&rsquo;s daring climbs atop the rooftops. &nbsp;He thinks of how Rickon used to steal Sansa&rsquo;s\nlemon cakes. &nbsp;He thinks of how she used\nto let him.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He thinks of many things, mostly winter-worn\nand flame-haired.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He thinks of many things.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And then &ndash; when he grips Longclaw to\nhis chest and dashes through the blood splashed hall &ndash; he thinks of nothing at\nall.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<i>&lsquo;Go,&rsquo;</i>\nshe had told him.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And he does.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He goes until his lungs give out.</p><p>* * *</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She finds Bran in the godswood\nstill, eyes white, barely breathing, his mouth twitching in something less than\nwords but more than an exhale , the Ironborn fighting off wights and walkers\nand suddenly Sansa is&hellip; Sansa is &ndash; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh gods.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ghost bounds past her, hurtling into\nthe wight running at her, and she fumbles in her cloak, finds the dragonglass\ndagger, and everything falls to pieces around her.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Somewhere above, Bran is warging\ninto the dead Viserion, its screeches lighting the air as blindingly as its blue\nfire, Drogon&rsquo;s accompanying roars a thunderous rush in their scream-filled wood. &nbsp;Men die at her left. &nbsp;They die at her right.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sansa staggers toward Bran, just a few\nfeet away, still unmoving and white-gazed. \nJust a few feet, and then he&rsquo;s there. \nHe&rsquo;s <i>right there</i>. &nbsp;Her hand reaches out, her other fist clenched\nover her dragonglass, and a sweep of snow-feathered wind overtakes her &ndash; she lurches\nback, blinks against the biting wind, her eyes meeting blue, and her breath\nstalls in her chest, the white walker suddenly there and immediate and <i>there</i> and she falls back just as he swings\nat her, her elbow jarring against the ground painfully, her hip hitting the snow\nhard, and then Ghost has his jaws around the walker&rsquo;s arm, his snarl sharp as he\ntears at it, and she watches with wide eyes as the walker drags his ice blade\nup and slices Ghost at the stomach, up and over his hind. &nbsp;Ghost yelps and releases his grip, stumbling\nback, falling against the snow, pushing up with his failing legs, and when the walker\nbrings his arms up with his blade, ready to strike Ghost with that killing\nblow, Sansa&rsquo;s bellow of rage lights her lungs and roars out of her as she\nscrambles to her knees, thrusting her dragonglass blade up and into its sternum,\nher grunt of pain locking her elbows, before she heaves, pushing deeper, and\nthe walker stills, mouth open in a soundless cry and the dry cracking of ice\nfills her ears and it shatters before her, nicking her cheek with the cut of\nits cold and she falls back, panting, arms aching, clawing at the ground as she\npushes herself back amidst the snow, one hand reaching for Ghost.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He&rsquo;s pushing up from the snow, legs\ntrembling, blood coating his white fur from his chest to his hip and Sansa&rsquo;s tearful\ncry tumbles out of her chapped lips. &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh\nGhost, Ghost <i>please</i>,&rdquo; and then she&rsquo;s\ncrying, and she&rsquo;s fumbling in the snow for her dagger and the wind hasn&rsquo;t stopped\nand neither have the screams and then her hand lights along her dagger,\nhobbling to a stand just as she hears the snarl of a wight bearing down on\nher. &nbsp;And then it&rsquo;s Theon at her shoulder,\nhis blade slicing the corpse&rsquo;s head clean off, another wight crashing into him\nand he falls back against Bran&rsquo;s chair, the pair of them toppling into the snow\nat Sansa&rsquo;s feet. &nbsp;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Theon!&rdquo; &nbsp;Her gasp tears from her, the carnage of the\nwood loud in her ears. &nbsp;And then her eyes\nflick to Bran. &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh gods, he&rsquo;s &ndash; Bran, he&rsquo;s\n&ndash;&rdquo; &nbsp;Her words lay slaughtered in her\nthroat, her hands bunching in her unmoving brother&rsquo;s cloak, trying to drag him\nfrom the toppled chair.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Get him out of here!&rdquo; Theon yells,\nparrying a swing, pushing the wight off.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not waking up!&rdquo; &nbsp;She pulls again, heaves with all her weight\nthrough the sludge, tripping on her own snow-logged cloak, and she gasps when\nshe slams into the ground, her vision going white for a terrifyingly long\nsecond. &nbsp;A pair of boots enter her vision\nand she snaps her gaze up, sharp blue eyes wide and terror-tinged. &nbsp;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Sansa, get up,&rdquo; Theon urges,\npanting, reaching for her, his hair matted in blood, his left arm bent at an\nunnatural angle, and she can&rsquo;t control the sob that leaves her.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Theon.&rdquo; &nbsp;Her chest tightens, her breath rushing from\nher in a single, swift exhale.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The glint of ice is sudden, barely-there.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When she looks back, she wonders how\nshe saw it at all.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But she sees it. &nbsp;She sees the ice-blade come down on Theon\nfrom behind, splitting him from gullet to gut, his blood spraying out over her\nface, her eyes blinking back against the onslaught, mouth parted, cry muted.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He drops to his knees, the white\nwalker blue and ice-touched and unmoved behind him.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Theon splits at the cut, falling to\npieces at her feet.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her scream rends the air.</p><p>* * *</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When he was younger, Jon used to\nwatch her in the morning light. &nbsp;From his\nwindow overlooking the courtyard, he could see Sansa walking to the sept at the\ncrack of dawn, her silk gowns fluttering in the wind, her hair like spilled\nwine.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<i>Go\nto your prayers, summer child</i>, he used to think. &nbsp;<i>They won&rsquo;t\nbe answered</i>.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They never have. &nbsp;And Jon isn&rsquo;t simple enough to think they\nwill be now.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But even still&hellip; even still he clutches\nat his chest, gloves slick with blood along Longclaw&rsquo;s hilt, the acrid scent of\nburning flesh stinging his lungs as he runs.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Even still he lets it fill him, that\ndangerous want, that memory of waiting at the window for the chance that she&rsquo;d\nturn, morning light catching her face like a promise.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a useless wish, the <i>wrong</i> kind of wish &ndash; for that\nwine-spilled hair spread along his furs, that silk gown at the foot of his bed,\nher mouth &ndash; her wet and parted mouth (never before parted for him, not like\nthat, at least) &ndash; pressed against the hollow of his throat.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When he was younger, things used to\nbe simpler. &nbsp;He never saw the dead\nrising, he never had to placate a dragon queen, he never panted his desperation\nthrough the bloodied halls of his home.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He never used to love his sister-cousin\n&ndash; not the way he does now.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No, their prayers have never been\nanswered before.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He sees no reason that should change\nnow.</p><p>* * *</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A snap of frigid air, her hand\nclenched in Ghost&rsquo;s bloodied fur, her other bunched in Bran&rsquo;s cloak, and then Brienne&rsquo;s\nthunderous shout breaks against the night fog, Oathkeeper swinging into Sansa&rsquo;s\ncone of vision &ndash; whispering dangerously close to her cheek &ndash; as it shatters the\nice blade into dozens of pieces, a single shard whistling through the air to\nbury deep in Sansa&rsquo;s thigh.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her howl of pain is not unlike a wolf&rsquo;s. &nbsp;She barely has the presence of mind to notice\nBrienne towering over her huddled form, fighting off the white walker. &nbsp;The wights rush through the Ironborn line,\nand then Ghost bites down on her shoulder and she cries out again, wincing\nbeneath the clench of his teeth through her wool dress as he drags her back in\nthe snow, stumbling in his own blood. \nThe tears are instant and hot on her lids as she grips at her bleeding\nthigh, flurries of snow blinding her vision. \nShe sees the dark, still form of Bran still laid out several feet away.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Ghost, no, it&rsquo;s Bran. &nbsp;<i>It&rsquo;s\nBran</i>, please, I have to &ndash; I have to <i>help\nhim</i>, please &ndash; &rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ghost whines at her shoulder, faltering\nin the sludge of gore and snow beneath his trembling paws even as he keeps\ndragging her and she chokes on the cry of pain in her throat. &nbsp;The dark shade of the weirwood overtakes them\nsuddenly and she looks up at the blood red leaves, a glint of moonlight shifting\nthrough the branches.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All at once, it is simple.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The terror fills her, the biting\ncold warmed by the blood in the air.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The dawn was never meant for her.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sansa struggles in the snow, pushing\nGhost away at her shoulder, a wet gasp breaking from her chapped and bloody lips\nwhen he releases her. &nbsp;She scrambles to\nher feet, a hand held against the wound at her thigh, limping over to Bran.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bodies drop around her and distantly\nshe thinks she hears Brienne shouting her name.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No, the dawn was never meant for\nher, but she&rsquo;s a Stark. &nbsp;She&rsquo;ll <i>always</i> be a Stark.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And Starks have never shied away\nfrom Winter.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Not even their own.</p><p>* * *</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jon breaks into the clearing and\nstills, eyes wide as they take in the carnage. \nHis throat constricts when he catches sight of Theon bloodying the\nground, but he can&rsquo;t linger on it, swallows it back, tastes the bitterness, eyes\nsweeping the wood. &nbsp;He catches sight of\nSansa&rsquo;s Northern guard clashing with the wights and walkers alongside the remaining\nIronborn, and then a vicious roar catches his ears and he sees Brienne stabbing\nOathkeeper through a white walker, the shards of ice breaking over her flagging\nform, and just past her, there, a bundle of bloodied furs and snow-caught,\ncopper hair &ndash; <i>there</i> &ndash; Sansa and Ghost\nare dragging an unconscious, white-eyed Bran back along the snow, toward the\ncourtyard entrance.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Everything fails him at once. &nbsp;His heart, his senses, his instincts. &nbsp;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He liked her songs the best, though\nhe&rsquo;d never told her. &nbsp;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(He wants to tell her now &ndash; tell her\nhow her soft laugh fills his own chest, how her fine-boned fingers make him\ntremble, how he lies awake at night cursing this desire of his, this need &ndash; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He wants to tell her how she can stagger\nhim with but a look &ndash; especially the frantic, blood-flecked one she wears now.)</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, everything stops. &nbsp;And then it crashes alive again, and he&rsquo;s\nbolting to her, lungs aching, head pounding.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Jon!&rdquo; she cries, half-wailing, half-panting.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He drops down beside her, Longclaw falling\nto the snow, his hands gripping at her arms. \n&ldquo;What in seven hells are you doing here?&rdquo; &nbsp;He shakes her &ndash; he <i>shakes</i> her, he&rsquo;s so furious, so panicked. &nbsp;&ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t you in the crypts?&rdquo; &nbsp;He can&rsquo;t help the way he yells it. &nbsp;Won&rsquo;t help it.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Bran, he&rsquo;s &ndash; he&rsquo;s not waking up.&rdquo; &nbsp;Her eyes are wide and salt-sheened, her face\nsplashed with a fine arc of blood. &nbsp;&ldquo;Jon,\nhe&rsquo;s <i>not waking up</i>.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Viserion still wails above them &ndash;\nunearthly screeches ricocheting through the clouds. &nbsp;Around them, the battle still wages.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how long he can hold\nit,&rdquo; Sansa sobs.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ghost huffs beside them, and Jon\nlooks at the direwolf, chest clenching at the bloodied sight of him. &nbsp;But Ghost is looking up, red eyes trained on\nthe clouds through the heavy shade of the weirwood.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And suddenly, Jon understands.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The wind is fire-lit, copper-stained.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(To love is&hellip;)</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He takes a moment, just a beat &ndash;\nenough to breathe in, to inhale, to hold that pull against his ribs and let it\nflood his lungs.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Sansa, we have to go.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She blinks up at him, mouth parting,\nbut nothing comes.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Can you run?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She must see something in his eyes,\nbecause she nods mutely, instantly, her hand gripping at her bloodied thigh.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Brienne!&rsquo; he shouts, twisting round\nin the snow, pulling Sansa up by an elbow, bracing her weight against him when\nshe staggers at the sudden surge.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Another wight falls to the knight\nbefore she whips her head around, catching Jon&rsquo;s gaze amidst the falling snow.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Your lady has need of you.&rdquo;</p><p>* * *</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sansa limps through the grey halls\nwith Brienne&rsquo;s arm around her waist, her cloak long-forgotten in the godswood, wisps\nof hair plastered to her forehead with sweat, Theon&rsquo;s blood caking along her\ncheeks, her own bloody shoulder marring her knight&rsquo;s chest guard &ndash; what isn&rsquo;t\nalready black and filthy with rot.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jon&rsquo;s just behind her with Bran\nslung across his back as he runs after them, their brother still unconscious. &nbsp;Ghost pads unsteadily ahead of them, leading\nthe way with the two remaining members of Sansa&rsquo;s guard, a single torch\nlighting their path.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The stones around them echo with\nscreams in every direction.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A regiment of Vale knights crosses\nthe corridor in front of them, a shout of incomprehensible Dothraki following,\narchers running up the stairs behind them to the eastern ramparts, and then a\nblur of black cloaks rushes past.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Sam!&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They swirl to a stop, Sansa gripping\nat Brienne&rsquo;s belt to keep herself upright.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One of the blurs stumbles to a halt at\nJon&rsquo;s shout, and before Sansa&rsquo;s inking black vision, the outline of a familiar\nface takes shape.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Jon!&rdquo; &nbsp;And then a quick grasp of arms, Jon adjusting\nthe weight of Bran over his back.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sam&rsquo;s face crumbles instantly from\nrelief into dread, eyeing the unconscious Stark. &nbsp;&ldquo;What&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Davos?&rdquo; Jon asks\nimpatiently, huffing beneath his fatigue.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sam seems to gather himself,\nnodding, eyes back to Jon&rsquo;s. &nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s ordered\nthe retreat back behind the third trench.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jon swallows thickly, a minute nod\nof acknowledgement passing him, and Sansa swears he glances at her beneath his\ndark brow.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Here.&rdquo; &nbsp;He slides Bran from across his back,\nadjusting him in Sam&rsquo;s grip, who takes him without hesitation. &nbsp;&ldquo;I need you to get them out. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll signal Davos for the final retreat.&rdquo; &nbsp;He stops, swallows, doesn&rsquo;t look at her. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hold the gate until you make it out.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Jon,&rdquo; she admonishes, breathless,\npushing from Brienne.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He ignores her, looks up at their\nloyal knight. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m holding you to your\noath, Ser Brienne.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;<i>Jon</i>.&rdquo; &nbsp;Sansa&rsquo;s pleading now, grasping at his arms, fingers\ncurling in the leather of his sleeves. &nbsp;Her\nvoice breaks.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jon closes his eyes a moment, opens\nthem, doesn&rsquo;t look at her.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t fail you, my lord &ndash; my <i>king</i>.&rdquo; \nAnd then Brienne nods, eyes glistening, mouth a thin line.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sansa shakes him, wincing at the\nache in her shoulder. &nbsp;&ldquo;Jon, look at me!&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He swallows thickly, eyes locked to\nBrienne&rsquo;s, body rigid. &nbsp;&ldquo;She&rsquo;s yours to\nprotect now.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not!&rdquo; Sansa screams, a fist\nlanding on his chest. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not, Jon, I&rsquo;m\n<i>not</i>! \nI&rsquo;m not anyone&rsquo;s but <i>yours</i> &ndash; please. &nbsp;<i>Please</i>. &nbsp;Just look at me, just &ndash; &rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And then he&rsquo;s kissing her, and it\nisn&rsquo;t apologetic, it isn&rsquo;t even soft. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s\nrough and wet and with teeth clacking against each other, his hands gripping at\nher hair, his breath flooding her mouth and he tastes her sudden sob &ndash; her regret\nas stark as winter on his tongue.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As stark as his own &ndash; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(And maybe &lsquo;stark&rsquo; should mean\nsomething in this moment but it doesn&rsquo;t &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t mean anything.) </p><p>That\nregret.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That sudden, biting knowledge that\nsomewhere along the way they&rsquo;d lost their chance &ndash; well and truly <i>lost</i> it, beyond any hope.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Beyond a needful last kiss. &nbsp;Beyond her hands grappling for his tunic and his\nchest heaving against hers and the modest, knowing way the others turn their\ngazes for a moment.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For just this single, blinding\nmoment.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He breaks from her, mouth still\npanting against hers, and then she&rsquo;s laughing &ndash; tear-lined and delirious, her\nhands shaking as they wind up his chest and into his hair, tangling in the ash\nand snow lighting his curls.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She thinks this will kill her &ndash;\nmaybe not today, not this moment. &nbsp;But\nsometime in the future when she least expects it &ndash; she will linger on this\nmoment and fracture away, crack beneath the weight of irreparable grief, think\nof his kiss and his desperate pants and his hands framing her face like she&rsquo;s\nsome precious thing, and she will <i>break</i>.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You have to <i>go</i>,&rdquo; he breathes against her mouth, sliding his cheek against hers\nand nuzzling softly, the break in his voice lost in her hair.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; &nbsp;She hiccups through her cries, her fingertips\nlighting along his cheeks, feeling his tremulous sigh at her ear. &nbsp;&ldquo;Not without you.&rdquo; &nbsp;She&rsquo;s panting and desperate and shaken. &nbsp;So shaken.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His hands tighten in her hair, the\nbreath rattling from him.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Still wish we&rsquo;d gone someplace warm instead?&rdquo;\nshe asks on a dark exhale, her delirious, rueful laugh clattering painfully through\nher chest as she shakes against him.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She feels the barest hint of his\nsmile at her ear, and she thinks this might be peace. &nbsp;In some small, immeasurable way &ndash; some\nimpermanent way.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You <i>are</i> my someplace warm,&rdquo; he says, and she crumbles against him,\nchest heaving. &nbsp;The raw cry that leaves\nher reverberates through the hall &ndash; a hollow, tear-laced keen.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But then he&rsquo;s pushing from her,\nbracing her back against Brienne. &nbsp;His\nhands linger over her shoulders for one long distressful moment, and then he\npulls stiffly from her.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Jon,&rdquo; she pleads once more, unable\nto say anything else.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Because please, gods, no. &nbsp;<i>No</i>. &nbsp;Not him. \nNot after everything.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a>He looks at\nher one last time and &ndash; <i>and oh</i> &ndash; she would\nwalk with him in that godswood, she would cloak him night after night, she\nwould swear her affection into his skin and drink his moans.</a></p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She\nwould hold him to her beneath a wolf&rsquo;s moon and make him a Stark &ndash; make him <i>hers</i>.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Except\nhe already is &ndash; and this, perhaps, is the cruelest truth of all.)</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He walks away, back into the shadow-filled\ncorridor, back into the night, back into the screams.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Something anchors between them like\na drought &ndash; a winter-worn famine.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Jon, <i>no</i>!&rdquo; &nbsp;She tries to run after\nhim, but Brienne&rsquo;s arms lock around her form, and her knee buckles beneath the pain\nof her gashed thigh, caught in her knight&rsquo;s hold.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Jon!&rdquo; she screams, wails, belts\ninto the night, scratching at her captor&rsquo;s hold and it&rsquo;s so tight &ndash; this hand\nat her throat, this clutch at her heart &ndash; it&rsquo;s so blinding and so staggering and\nshe thinks she might collapse in on herself, right here, right here in the\nhalls where she&rsquo;s meant to feel safe, right here in her home, right here beside\nthe ruined pieces of her heart and she reaches out, struggles against Brienne&rsquo;s\ngrip, hand grasping, mouth opening, panting, screaming, <i>begging</i> &ndash; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Jon!&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Something strikes her at the base of\nher skull, thwarting the wail in her throat, breath catching, vision inking slowly\nblack as she stills her struggle. &nbsp;She\nblinks her suddenly groggy eyes at the shadow that flits before her, catches\nher sister&rsquo;s heavy grey gaze staring back from a blood-drenched face, one cheek\nswelling up with a brutal, purple bruise.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Arya,&rdquo; she whispers, slipping into\nthe darkness. &nbsp;Brienne&rsquo;s grip loosens as\nshe slumps forward into her sister&rsquo;s open arms.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sansa&rsquo;s eyes slip shut.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She&rsquo;d come for her.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She had. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>(Even\nwhen she wished she hadn&rsquo;t.)</p><p>* * *</p><p>Jon\nlikes to think it matters, in the end.</p><p>All\nof it. &nbsp;Or at least, some of it.</p><p>Another\nthunderous heave against the gate, his feet braced readily on the other side &ndash;\nwaiting.</p><p>He&rsquo;s\nbeen to the other side before. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s seen\nthe red dawn.</p><p>(A\nlittle girl with Sansa&rsquo;s hair and his eyes. \nA little girl. &nbsp;A <i>daughter</i>.)</p><p>Jon\nhas seen it in his dreams too long to not see it now &ndash;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bran lays beside her under the furs,\nhis breathing low and uneven. &nbsp;She\nstrokes Ghost&rsquo;s head in her lap, eyes locked on the smoke-lined horizon where\nWinterfell used to stand, growing ever smaller in the distance. &nbsp;</p><p>It&rsquo;s\na grey dawn, a dawn she hadn&rsquo;t meant to see.</p><p>No\ndragon wings beat overhead. &nbsp;No banners\nfly amidst their meager flood of fleeing civilians. &nbsp;No sun makes it through the dark, snow-laden\nclouds, even as dawn creeps over the North.</p><p>&ldquo;He\nisn&rsquo;t coming,&rdquo;
