Y/N doesn\u2019t move, but instead glances around the dimly lit room. She feels fine now, but she knows that in the following minutes she\u2019ll be desperate to open a window. Maybe she should have, they always make the same mistake and then he gets all huffy and pouty afterwards because she doesn\u2019t want to cuddle him when they\u2019re both sweaty and out of breath. </p><p>Y/N is brought out of her deep thoughts about the heat as soon as he guides her by her hips even further up, now resting right over his butterfly tattoo, the sight making her nervous. \u201cW-wait, wait.\u201d She whispers, placing both hands over his chest to balance herself and stop his\u00a0 movement. </p><p>\u201cC\u2019mere.\u201d He says calmly, his voice comforting the rapid beating of her heart. \u201cLet me have a taste of you, yeah?\u201d</p><p>Y/N nods slowly, placing both hands on either side of his shoulders and lowering her head down so she could press a lingering kiss over his lips. This is something she can do, kissing Harry is one of\nher favorite things after all. His lips are always plushy and wet and his breath feels minty and fresh. </p><p>Harry hums in content, pulling back and brushing some of her hair behind her ear. \u201cThat\u2019s nice pet,\u201d he purses his lips to suppress a grin, \u201cbut I meant a taste of a different part of you.\u201d </p><p>Y/N swallows dryly, her elbows beginning to quiver as she\u2019s still holding herself on top of him, squealing when he places both of his hands back on her bum, giving her a light pinch and inching her further up. She hooks her arms around his neck and stops him by digging her calves into his sides. \u201cHarry, wait.\u201d She presses her forehead on top of his, her breathing a lot more erratic compared to his. \u201cI-I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? We\u2019ve done this before, it\u2019s not all that different.\u201d He leans up to brush his lips over hers, giving her bottom one a subtle bite.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty big difference, Harry.\u201d She puffs out a nervous laugh, shaking her head from side to side.</p><p>\u201cI still get to have my head between your legs either way, so I don\u2019t really see the difference.\u201d </p><p>Y/N lets out a small noise of surprise at his blunt choice of words, pulling onto the hair at the nape of his neck, which only makes him hum in satisfaction at her way of \u201cscolding\u201d him. Looking down at him and tracing her eyes over his features, she seriously considers his offer. She trails her gaze over from his glowing cheekbones to the tip of his nose and the slight sweat that has already built above his cupid\u2019s bow, ending it over to his slightly parted lips. Looking over his face, she feels a heat creeping up onto her cheeks when she imagines getting to, as bluntly as he put it, sit on it.</p><p>\u201cM\u2019not gonna force you into anything you don\u2019t want,\u201d he assures her, resting his index and middle finger underneath her chin, his thumb stroking over her bottom lip, \u201cbut I would very much like to have you sit on my face.\u201d He chuckles a little when he sees her eyes widening at his words. \u201cCome\non, poppet,\u201d he rests back comfortably onto the pillows, looking up at her as he begins to guide her hips further up, now resting right on top of his chest, \u201cmake me happy, yeah?\u201d</p><p>Y/N breathes shakily, but nods quickly, the hands she has resting onto his shoulders moving in front of her to grab the wooden headboard, eyes not once leaving his face. She props her knees on each side of his head, his fingertips digging into her thighs and thumbs stroking gently over her skin, trying to ease her nerves. \u201cThat\u2019s a good girl.\u201d</p><p>Y/N shudders, closing her eyes for a few moments, trying to shake away the nervous feeling inside her body. She can already feel his hot breath resting right over where she aches for him and it makes her legs quiver. Realizing she has yet to take her underwear off, she swallows the lump in her throat before speaking quietly.</p><p>\u201cShould I take my-\u201c Her words get caught in her throat when his fingers slip her panties right to the side and his tongue darts up to teasingly lick a stripe over her slit. \u201cO-Oh!\u201d She gasps loudly.</p><p>Her fingers tighten their hold onto the headboard, eyes rolling in the back of her head and mouth parting. She leans forward and almost falls over when his lips latch onto her clit, sucking harshly and making her trash above him. He gets a good grip of her hips to keep her in place and she has to grip the headboard with both hands, feeling like her knuckles might crack from how tight she\u2019s holding on.</p><p>Harry lets out a curious hum, enjoying the tangy sweetness she leaves over his tongue and wanting more of it, pushing her down onto him and properly burying his face into her. He breathes harshly through his nose, tongue swirling over her and teasing her entrance. \u201cSweet little cunt, just for me, innit?\u201d</p><p>Y/N whimpers at his vulgar choice of words, leaning her forehead onto her arm, but yelping loudly when he delivers a loud smack to her bum. \u201cWant you to watch.\u201d She nods quickly, tugging her bottom lip between her teeth and watching as he closes his eyes in concentration and goes right back to using his mouth over her in ways that make her soar. \u00a0</p><p>Her lips curl around his name, whispering it over and over again, mixed with low moans and wet gasps, sounding like straight up music to Harry\u2019s ears. She feels so close quicker than she ever has before, tummy quivering and knees ready to give out at any moment, but she forces to keep herself propped up by gripping tightly onto the wooden frame in\u00a0 front of her. </p><p>The thing that makes her eyes tear up and her lungs hurt from the lack of air though is when he finally dips his tongue inside of her after teasing her entrance for a good minute, his thumb moving in circles over her clit, a broken moan escaping from the back of her throat. \u201c<i>Ba</i>-Harry!\u201d She gasps loudly, crying out when he pulls away to talk.</p><p>\u201cSay it.\u201d He demands, his eyes wild and full of lust, pleading with her to say the word resting on her tongue.</p><p>Y/N\u2019s never been big on pet names; she loves the ones Harry has for her, always thought they\u2019re really sweet and they make her feel cared for, but she\u2019s always found it a little more difficult to find something fitting for him. She sometimes calls him petal because he\u2019s as soft and beautiful as a petal, and that always gets Harry all mushy and blushy, his cheeks heating up quicker than an oven \u2013 that\u2019s why she uses it so rarely. </p><p>But the one pet name that drives Harry crazy and makes him want to just ravish her whole, is simple yet it makes his whole body tingle \u2013 <i>baby</i>. It\u2019s not necessarily the word, but it\u2019s the way she says it. The way her lips curve around it and the way she\u2019s said it in so many different instances; groaned in the morning when he wouldn\u2019t stop poking her sides playfully, casually in the middle of explaining a show playing on the telly, whispered at night before bed and after a goodnight kiss, and breathy and soft right into his ear when he\u2019s got her legs wrapped around his waist. </p><p>She\u2019s still wary about using it though, she\u2019s not like him; to him they come naturally, but she still has to get used to being the one using them. So he asks her, sometimes quite literally begs for her to say that one word that can make his knees weak and his heart swell. He needs\nfor her to say it; he could hear it for the rest of his life on a loop and would be eternally content. </p><p>Looking down into his pleading eyes, she breathes out shakily and forces herself to whisper the word he so desperately wants to hear, \u201cPlease, baby.\u201d Harry\u2019s eyes close and his brows furrow, Y/N\u2019s throat feeling dry and scratchy. </p><p>\u201c<i>Again</i>.\u201d He demands, his thumb picking up once again on what he was doing before, circling her clit with it and making her thighs tense around his head.</p><p>\u201cBaby, baby, baby\u2026\u201d She whispers the word over and over, at first lowly, then gradually becoming more high pitched.</p><p>Her complete breaking point though is when Harry lets out a sound she can only describe as a growl, replacing his finger with his lips, sucking harshly onto her clit and throwing her completely over the edge, her body shooting forward, arms barely holding her up anymore as she leans onto the headboard, eyes rolling in the back of her head and mouth curling around the same word, but no sound coming out.</p><p>Harry greedily laps up everything she has to give him, humming in content, making her flinch away, feeling too sensitive. He takes a hold of one of her thighs and helps her swing it over onto the other side, climbing off of him and laying on her back onto the mattress, chest rising and falling quickly, hair sticking to her cheeks and forehead. He smiles cheekily and presses a chaste kiss to her shoulder. </p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t all that different after all, see?\u201d She laughs breathily and elbows him lightly, making him lean away and clutch his chest\n\ndramatically.</p><p>\u201cIt was pretty damn different, Harry.\u201d He just grins and comes back to her side, cuddling into her tired body and biting playfully on her ear lobe.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say, <i>baby</i>.\u201d</p>",

She trails her gaze over from his glowing cheekbones to the tip of his nose and the slight sweat that has already built above his cupid\u2019s bow, ending it over to his slightly parted lips. Looking over his face, she feels a heat creeping up onto her cheeks when she imagines getting to, as bluntly as he put it, sit on it.</p><p>\u201cM\u2019not gonna force you into anything you don\u2019t want,\u201d he assures her, resting his index and middle finger underneath her chin, his thumb stroking over her bottom lip, \u201cbut I would very much like to have you sit on my face.\u201d He chuckles a little when he sees her eyes widening at his words. \u201cCome\non, poppet,\u201d he rests back comfortably onto the pillows, looking up at her as he begins to guide her hips further up, now resting right on top of his chest, \u201cmake me happy, yeah?\u201d</p><p>Y/N breathes shakily, but nods quickly, the hands she has resting onto his shoulders moving in front of her to grab the wooden headboard, eyes not once leaving his face. She props her knees on each side of his head, his fingertips digging into her thighs and thumbs stroking gently over her skin, trying to ease her nerves. \u201cThat\u2019s a good girl.\u201d</p><p>Y/N shudders, closing her eyes for a few moments, trying to shake away the nervous feeling inside her body. She can already feel his hot breath resting right over where she aches for him and it makes her legs quiver. Realizing she has yet to take her underwear off, she swallows the lump in her throat before speaking quietly.</p><p>\u201cShould I take my-\u201c Her words get caught in her throat when his fingers slip her panties right to the side and his tongue darts up to teasingly lick a stripe over her slit. \u201cO-Oh!\u201d She gasps loudly.</p><p>Her fingers tighten their hold onto the headboard, eyes rolling in the back of her head and mouth parting. She leans forward and almost falls over when his lips latch onto her clit, sucking harshly and making her trash above him. He gets a good grip of her hips to keep her in place and she has to grip the headboard with both hands, feeling like her knuckles might crack from how tight she\u2019s holding on.</p><p>Harry lets out a curious hum, enjoying the tangy sweetness she leaves over his tongue and wanting more of it, pushing her down onto him and properly burying his face into her. He breathes harshly through his nose, tongue swirling over her and teasing her entrance. \u201cSweet little cunt, just for me, innit?\u201d</p><p>Y/N whimpers at his vulgar choice of words, leaning her forehead onto her arm, but yelping loudly when he delivers a loud smack to her bum. \u201cWant you to watch.\u201d She nods quickly, tugging her bottom lip between her teeth and watching as he closes his eyes in concentration and goes right back to using his mouth over her in ways that make her soar. \u00a0</p><p>Her lips curl around his name, whispering it over and over again, mixed with low moans and wet gasps, sounding like straight up music to Harry\u2019s ears. She feels so close quicker than she ever has before, tummy quivering and knees ready to give out at any moment, but she forces to keep herself propped up by gripping tightly onto the wooden frame in\u00a0 front of her. </p><p>The thing that makes her eyes tear up and her lungs hurt from the lack of air though is when he finally dips his tongue inside of her after teasing her entrance for a good minute, his thumb moving in circles over her clit, a broken moan escaping from the back of her throat. \u201c<i>Ba</i>-Harry!\u201d She gasps loudly, crying out when he pulls away to talk.</p><p>\u201cSay it.\u201d He demands, his eyes wild and full of lust, pleading with her to say the word resting on her tongue.</p><p>Y/N\u2019s never been big on pet names; she loves the ones Harry has for her, always thought they\u2019re really sweet and they make her feel cared for, but she\u2019s always found it a little more difficult to find something fitting for him. She sometimes calls him petal because he\u2019s as soft and beautiful as a petal, and that always gets Harry all mushy and blushy, his cheeks heating up quicker than an oven \u2013 that\u2019s why she uses it so rarely. </p><p>But the one pet name that drives Harry crazy and makes him want to just ravish her whole, is simple yet it makes his whole body tingle \u2013 <i>baby</i>. It\u2019s not necessarily the word, but it\u2019s the way she says it. The way her lips curve around it and the way she\u2019s said it in so many different instances; groaned in the morning when he wouldn\u2019t stop poking her sides playfully, casually in the middle of explaining a show playing on the telly, whispered at night before bed and after a goodnight kiss, and breathy and soft right into his ear when he\u2019s got her legs wrapped around his waist. </p><p>She\u2019s still wary about using it though, she\u2019s not like him; to him they come naturally, but she still has to get used to being the one using them. So he asks her, sometimes quite literally begs for her to say that one word that can make his knees weak and his heart swell. He needs\nfor her to say it; he could hear it for the rest of his life on a loop and would be eternally content. </p><p>Looking down into his pleading eyes, she breathes out shakily and forces herself to whisper the word he so desperately wants to hear, \u201cPlease, baby.\u201d Harry\u2019s eyes close and his brows furrow, Y/N\u2019s throat feeling dry and scratchy. </p><p>\u201c<i>Again</i>.\u201d He demands, his thumb picking up once again on what he was doing before, circling her clit with it and making her thighs tense around his head.</p><p>\u201cBaby, baby, baby\u2026\u201d She whispers the word over and over, at first lowly, then gradually becoming more high pitched.</p><p>Her complete breaking point though is when Harry lets out a sound she can only describe as a growl, replacing his finger with his lips, sucking harshly onto her clit and throwing her completely over the edge, her body shooting forward, arms barely holding her up anymore as she leans onto the headboard, eyes rolling in the back of her head and mouth curling around the same word, but no sound coming out.</p><p>Harry greedily laps up everything she has to give him, humming in content, making her flinch away, feeling too sensitive. He takes a hold of one of her thighs and helps her swing it over onto the other side, climbing off of him and laying on her back onto the mattress, chest rising and falling quickly, hair sticking to her cheeks and forehead. He smiles cheekily and presses a chaste kiss to her shoulder. </p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t all that different after all, see?\u201d She laughs breathily and elbows him lightly, making him lean away and clutch his chest\n\ndramatically.</p><p>\u201cIt was pretty damn different, Harry.\u201d He just grins and comes back to her side, cuddling into her tired body and biting playfully on her ear lobe.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say, <i>baby</i>.\u201d</p>",

Y/N doesn\u2019t move, but instead glances around the dimly lit room. She feels fine now, but she knows that in the following minutes she\u2019ll be desperate to open a window. Maybe she should have, they always make the same mistake and then he gets all huffy and pouty afterwards because she doesn\u2019t want to cuddle him when they\u2019re both sweaty and out of breath. </p><p>Y/N is brought out of her deep thoughts about the heat as soon as he guides her by her hips even further up, now resting right over his butterfly tattoo, the sight making her nervous. \u201cW-wait, wait.\u201d She whispers, placing both hands over his chest to balance herself and stop his\u00a0 movement. </p><p>\u201cC\u2019mere.\u201d He says calmly, his voice comforting the rapid beating of her heart. \u201cLet me have a taste of you, yeah?\u201d</p><p>Y/N nods slowly, placing both hands on either side of his shoulders and lowering her head down so she could press a lingering kiss over his lips. This is something she can do, kissing Harry is one of\nher favorite things after all.

She feels so close quicker than she ever has before, tummy quivering and knees ready to give out at any moment, but she forces to keep herself propped up by gripping tightly onto the wooden frame in&nbsp; front of her. </p><p>The thing that makes her eyes tear up and her lungs hurt from the lack of air though is when he finally dips his tongue inside of her after teasing her entrance for a good minute, his thumb moving in circles over her clit, a broken moan escaping from the back of her throat. &ldquo;<i>Ba</i>-Harry!&rdquo; She gasps loudly, crying out when he pulls away to talk.</p><p>&ldquo;Say it.&rdquo; He demands, his eyes wild and full of lust, pleading with her to say the word resting on her tongue.</p><p>Y/N&rsquo;s never been big on pet names; she loves the ones Harry has for her, always thought they&rsquo;re really sweet and they make her feel cared for, but she&rsquo;s always found it a little more difficult to find something fitting for him. She sometimes calls him petal because he&rsquo;s as soft and beautiful as a petal, and that always gets Harry all mushy and blushy, his cheeks heating up quicker than an oven &ndash; that&rsquo;s why she uses it so rarely. </p><p>But the one pet name that drives Harry crazy and makes him want to just ravish her whole, is simple yet it makes his whole body tingle &ndash; <i>baby</i>. It&rsquo;s not necessarily the word, but it&rsquo;s the way she says it. The way her lips curve around it and the way she&rsquo;s said it in so many different instances; groaned in the morning when he wouldn&rsquo;t stop poking her sides playfully, casually in the middle of explaining a show playing on the telly, whispered at night before bed and after a goodnight kiss, and breathy and soft right into his ear when he&rsquo;s got her legs wrapped around his waist. </p><p>She&rsquo;s still wary about using it though, she&rsquo;s not like him; to him they come naturally, but she still has to get used to being the one using them. So he asks her, sometimes quite literally begs for her to say that one word that can make his knees weak and his heart swell. He needs\nfor her to say it; he could hear it for the rest of his life on a loop and would be eternally content. </p><p>Looking down into his pleading eyes, she breathes out shakily and forces herself to whisper the word he so desperately wants to hear, &ldquo;Please, baby.&rdquo; Harry&rsquo;s eyes close and his brows furrow, Y/N&rsquo;s throat feeling dry and scratchy. </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Again</i>.&rdquo; He demands, his thumb picking up once again on what he was doing before, circling her clit with it and making her thighs tense around his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Baby, baby, baby&hellip;&rdquo; She whispers the word over and over, at first lowly, then gradually becoming more high pitched.</p><p>Her complete breaking point though is when Harry lets out a sound she can only describe as a growl, replacing his finger with his lips, sucking harshly onto her clit and throwing her completely over the edge, her body shooting forward, arms barely holding her up anymore as she leans onto the headboard, eyes rolling in the back of her head and mouth curling around the same word, but no sound coming out.</p><p>Harry greedily laps up everything she has to give him, humming in content, making her flinch away, feeling too sensitive. He takes a hold of one of her thighs and helps her swing it over onto the other side, climbing off of him and laying on her back onto the mattress, chest rising and falling quickly, hair sticking to her cheeks and forehead. He smiles cheekily and presses a chaste kiss to her shoulder. </p><p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t all that different after all, see?&rdquo; She laughs breathily and elbows him lightly, making him lean away and clutch his chest\n\ndramatically.</p><p>&ldquo;It was pretty damn different, Harry.&rdquo; He just grins and comes back to her side, cuddling into her tired body and biting playfully on her ear lobe.</p><p>&ldquo;Whatever you say, <i>baby</i>.&rdquo;</p>",
