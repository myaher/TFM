I think they are not considering the education Arya is receiving in Braavos.  The Faceless Men with all their abilities DID NOT kill the slave masters in slaver's bay.  I think Arya is going away with the Black and White thinking even if I think Arya will assert her identity and leave the Faceless Men.",
        "answer": "<p>Dear nonny,</p><p>the idea that Arya and Dany will get along stems from three hints so to say: in the books Arya flees the Red keep via the deep cellars where the dragon skulls are kept:</p><blockquote><p>This time the monsters did not frighten her. They seemed almost old friends.\n Arya held the candle over her head. With each step she took, the \nshadows moved against the walls, as if they were turning to watch her \npass. &ldquo;Dragons,&rdquo; she whispered. She slid Needle out from under her \ncloak. The slender blade seemed very small and the dragons very big, yet\n somehow Arya felt better with steel in her hand.\n \u00a0 (AGOT, Arya IV)\u00a0 <br/></p></blockquote><p>To me it points towards RLJ, that there is one dragon who is friends with Arya (especially since the large skull is probably Balerion which points to Aegon and therefore Jon). In addition Arya keeps her sword Needle close all the time, her Stark identity you could say. So I don\u2019t think this is conclusive for a Da\u20acnerys/Arya friendship.</p><p>The other hint is a show-addition: It is revealed that Arya likes Visenya, Aegon the Conqueror\u2019s warlike sister, and this is seen as a sign that she would get along with Da\u20acnerys since she is a Targaryen princess who rides a dragon. But again, this can be understood in another way as well. It might be a hint, that Arya is Visenya, the warrior sister of Aegon who was that protective of her brother that she founded the King\u2019s Guard. <br/></p><p>Lastly, both Arya and Da\u20acnerys are seen as fighters against social injustice and as such they should naturally band together. I do think that Arya, who easily befriends people from the smallfolk who has seen the life of the people who suffer the most from war as a first hand experience and who is at the moment in Braavos, a city where the socials boundaries are less rigid than elsewhere, is indeed someone who cares for the smallfolk. This is not necessarily the stand of a social revolutionary, because for Arya it is always about her friends, the people she has empathy for, but there is also a keen sense of justice in Arya. Injustice really gets her riled up and she tries what is in her power to remedy that. <br/></p><p>Now I happen to think that Da\u20acnerys as a fighter against social injustice is a huge stretch. Yes, she frees the slaves, but she frees them, because she needs an army and in the books we see her continuing to have slaves of her own, we see her letting Mereen lapse back into slavery (and profiting from it), and in the show we also see her becoming a master, at least in the eyes of former followers (Mhysa is a master) and we see her leaving Essos to conquer Westeros. Leaving the country that does still have slavery to conquer a country that has none with an army that is formed of former slaves - why not continue the good fight against slavery and atone for the sins of her ancestors who were Valyrian slave masters? Again this is a question of interpretation, but I do think that the textual evidence for Da\u20acnerys as the \u2018accidental saviour\u2019 who frees slaves because it happens to help her getting troops is better than for her starting an anti-slavery campaign. Her anti-slavery discourse is usually propaganda that serves a goal. Catchy, but ultimately meaningless and inconsequential (\u2019I will break the wheel\u2019 etc.).<br/></p><p>So, I don\u2019t think that Arya will fall at Da\u20acnerys\u2019 feet, nor will she stand in awe, braid her hair or even be remotely friendly. She will be <b>suspicious</b>, because after all this is foremost what she has learned.

They seemed almost old friends.\n Arya held the candle over her head. With each step she took, the \nshadows moved against the walls, as if they were turning to watch her \npass. \u201cDragons,\u201d she whispered. She slid Needle out from under her \ncloak. The slender blade seemed very small and the dragons very big, yet\n somehow Arya felt better with steel in her hand.\n \u00a0 (AGOT, Arya IV)\u00a0 <br></p></blockquote><p>To me it points towards RLJ, that there is one dragon who is friends with Arya (especially since the large skull is probably Balerion which points to Aegon and therefore Jon). In addition Arya keeps her sword Needle close all the time, her Stark identity you could say. So I don\u2019t think this is conclusive for a Da\u20acnerys/Arya friendship.</p><p>The other hint is a show-addition: It is revealed that Arya likes Visenya, Aegon the Conqueror\u2019s warlike sister, and this is seen as a sign that she would get along with Da\u20acnerys since she is a Targaryen princess who rides a dragon. But again, this can be understood in another way as well. It might be a hint, that Arya is Visenya, the warrior sister of Aegon who was that protective of her brother that she founded the King\u2019s Guard. <br></p><p>Lastly, both Arya and Da\u20acnerys are seen as fighters against social injustice and as such they should naturally band together. I do think that Arya, who easily befriends people from the smallfolk who has seen the life of the people who suffer the most from war as a first hand experience and who is at the moment in Braavos, a city where the socials boundaries are less rigid than elsewhere, is indeed someone who cares for the smallfolk. This is not necessarily the stand of a social revolutionary, because for Arya it is always about her friends, the people she has empathy for, but there is also a keen sense of justice in Arya. Injustice really gets her riled up and she tries what is in her power to remedy that. <br></p><p>Now I happen to think that Da\u20acnerys as a fighter against social injustice is a huge stretch. Yes, she frees the slaves, but she frees them, because she needs an army and in the books we see her continuing to have slaves of her own, we see her letting Mereen lapse back into slavery (and profiting from it), and in the show we also see her becoming a master, at least in the eyes of former followers (Mhysa is a master) and we see her leaving Essos to conquer Westeros. Leaving the country that does still have slavery to conquer a country that has none with an army that is formed of former slaves - why not continue the good fight against slavery and atone for the sins of her ancestors who were Valyrian slave masters? Again this is a question of interpretation, but I do think that the textual evidence for Da\u20acnerys as the \u2018accidental saviour\u2019 who frees slaves because it happens to help her getting troops is better than for her starting an anti-slavery campaign. Her anti-slavery discourse is usually propaganda that serves a goal.

In silence, they sat and ate until one of them could think of something to talk about.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you remember when we would play King of the Rock?&rdquo; Jon asked her.</p><p>He felt triumphant when Sansa smiled at the flames she was staring longingly at,&nbsp;&ldquo;That was before Rickon was born&hellip; before I started playing less and started sewing inside.
