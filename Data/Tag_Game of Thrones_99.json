        "body": "<p>My predictions for Season 8 are purely based on the characters and events of the show. I read the books, all of them and twice, but I won\u00b4t refer to them here because I\u00b4m quite sure G.R.R. Martin\u00b4s \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire\u201d will take a different path, give the characters different choices and reasons, even if it will end similar to the show, seen on the whole.</p><p><b>Dreams shattered. The Stark children and Daenerys</b></p><p>The Starks are introduced as a devoted family yet not without conflicts among themselves. Their children love each other but have very different dreams and hopes. Sansa wants to become the loving wife of a handsome and honorable prince/knight. Arya wants to become a fighter. Robb wants to be like his father. Bran wants to be an adventurer. And bastard Jon wants to belong and to become a knight of the \u2013 as he believes \u2013 honorable Night\u00b4s Watch. Overseas we see Daenerys Targaryen sold to Khal Drogo by her brother Viserys who hopes to conquer Westeros and take back the Iron Throne. Daenerys in the beginning just wants to go \u201chome\u201d, but in fact can\u00b4t remember \u201chome\u201d.</p><p>Everyone achieves - as it seems - his or her dreams but they are changed into nightmares. Sansa\u00b4s beloved prince and fiance is a monster, Arya is turned into an assassin, Robb dies because he is as gullible as his father, Brans adventures turn him into a semi-human cripple, Jon becomes a commander of the Night\u00b4s Watch and gets killed by his own comrades. Daenerys finally arrives in Westeros but it doesn\u00b4t feel like home at all. </p><p><b> </b></p><p><b>Lady and the Ghost</b></p><p>All the Stark children are connected with ancient powers and magic. Those powers came to life in the very first episode, when they find their direwolfs. Sansa is the first of the Stark children to loose her wolf and therefor her connection with the magic world. Sansa\u00b4s arc is about dealing with a hostile and dangerous world without the help of magic and faith. She struggles \u2013 but she survives by observing, lying, manipulating and learning. She decides to stay a lady anyway: \u201cCourtesy is a lady\u00b4s armor.\u201d And she learns how to rule and how to make a difference: she wants to inspire loyalty by love not fear, she tries to find compromises instead of dictatorship. Season 07 shows how Sansa grows into a leader and that she does well (especially compared to Cersei and Daenerys: Cersei uses fear and is a dictator; Daenerys is loved by her followers but still is a dictator unable to compromise). </p><p>Sansa and Jon have reflecting story arcs. Both believed in songs and legends about knights, princes and ladies. Both were terribly disenchanted when they met with the realities of Kings Landing and Castle Black. Both decided to stand by their ideals, anyway. They learnt everything on their separate ways to become the power couple they are in season 6 \u00a0- to win back the North and to become the best rulers for the North. Sansa learnt to be modest which enables her to inspire love and admiration. Jon learnt to be more suspicious and to convince his subjects not only by acting but also by talking.</p><p>But it\u00b4s too late for them as a romantic couple, it always was: When Sansa Stark meets her \u2013 as both believe \u2013 halfbrother Jon again he literally is a Ghost himself (the forshadowing name he gave his white direwolf in the first episode). Resurrected by Melisandre Jon is a wight by fire as much as Beric is. And \u2013 as Beric puts it: \u201cWe defend those who can\u00b4t defend themselves\u201d \u2013 he\u00b4s resurrected to fight death, the Army of the Dead, the Night King. That\u00b4s his purpose. And his tragic, too: Lady and the Ghost are meant for each other (The show used so many romantic tropes even in season 7, that I can\u00b4t believe it\u00b4s just incompetence.) But Jon and Sansa are not on the same page anymore: Sansa is a human being while Jon is a wight. </p><p>Both of them are not totally aware of their feelings for each other at the end of season 7, they don\u00b4t know about Jons parentage and they don\u00b4t know about the consequences of a magic resurrection. For season 8 all these points promise an emotional roller coaster ride. They will realize they aren\u00b4t siblings (but just then Jon turns up with his dragon queen and they will have to hide their feelings once again), they will realize their mutual feelings (and just then they will have to hide them from everyone because they won\u00b4t want anyone to know about Jon\u00b4s inheritance rights) and when a Happy End will seem possible after all, they will have to face the truth about ressurrections and will have to renounce it, so that Jon will have to die again.</p><p>When all is said and done, when the Night King is gone and the realm is secure again, Jon will have fulfilled his destiny while Sansa\u00b4s will begin: \u00a0Sansa will be the elected queen of the Seven Kingdoms. \u00a0</p><p>The love of Lady and the Ghost will have to stay a dream, perhaps even a dream only the two of them will ever know about. Bittersweet ending.\u00a0</p><p><b> </b></p><p><b> </b></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>\u201cHis is the song of Ice and Fire.\u201d Songs and Politics</b></p><p>Jon himself is the Song of Ice and Fire. He\u00b4s half Dragon, half Wolf. Perhaps his father Rhaegar had a vision or read a prophecy that only a prince, half Stark, half Targaryen would be able to defeat the Night King. Perhaps therefore he eloped with Lyanna Stark and fathered Aegon/Jon. But Rhaegar got it wrong: To change the system, to bring stability to Westeros and to begin a new age not only the Night King (Ice) has to be defeated but also the Targaryen Threat/The Rule of the Dragons (Fire) has to be completely destroyed. The longlasting balance between Ice and Fire is gone with the Wall and can\u00b4t be reestablished. Magic has to leave Westeros and Jon is the last magic prince to defeat Ice and Fire by sacrificing himself.</p><p>He has to kill the Night King and Daenerys Targaryen. In the course he will be wounded and burned (the left part of his face). Maybe Daenerys Targaryen who will betray Jon and attack his family (could be she burns Alys Stark because she confuses her with Sansa) will see her mistakes at the very last \u00a0minute just before she dies and ask for forgiveness. Jon won\u00b4t die fast but he will succumb to his wounds in the end.

Sansa realizes that Jon did what he had to do and helps him to convince the Northerners. In private she curses him for his love affair and feels confused about her own feelings. Sam and Bran reveal Jon\u00b4s parentage to Jon and his cousins Sansa and Arya. The Starks decide to keep it secret. Jon confesses to Sansa that he doen\u00b4t trust Daenerys enough because of her obsession with the Iron Throne. Daenerys tries to be polite and humble but on different occasions her temper shows (perhaps with Sam when his father\u00b4s and brother\u00b4s fate is revealed, perhaps with Bran or with Arya). Tyrion observes the tension between Daenerys and the Stark family, tries to mediate, flatters Sansa. The Hound shows his admiration for Sansa as well. Jon realizes with confusion his jealousy when he observes Sansa with her admirer. Daenerys sometimes feels neglected. The Northerners are in awe and fear because of the Dragons. Sansa and Daenerys have a dispute about food and the clothing of Daenery\u00b4s armies. Everyone will become aware that the Dragon Queen didn\u00b4t care when she burnt the harvest of the Reach. The death of the Tarlys is revealed. Daenerys is seen by many for \u201cwhat she is\u201d, but the Starks try to keep the peace among their allies because they need the dragons to fight the Army of the Dead. Jon has to flatter Daenerys and to make love to her to calm her.</p><p>Theon attacks Euron\u00b4s ship who brings the Golden Company to Westeros and somehow frees his sisters.

                "content": "<p>My predictions for Season 8 are purely based on the characters and events of the show. I read the books, all of them and twice, but I won&acute;t refer to them here because I&acute;m quite sure G.R.R. Martin&acute;s &ldquo;A Song of Ice and Fire&rdquo; will take a different path, give the characters different choices and reasons, even if it will end similar to the show, seen on the whole.</p><p><b>Dreams shattered. The Stark children and Daenerys</b></p><p>The Starks are introduced as a devoted family yet not without conflicts among themselves. Their children love each other but have very different dreams and hopes. Sansa wants to become the loving wife of a handsome and honorable prince/knight. Arya wants to become a fighter. Robb wants to be like his father. Bran wants to be an adventurer. And bastard Jon wants to belong and to become a knight of the &ndash; as he believes &ndash; honorable Night&acute;s Watch. Overseas we see Daenerys Targaryen sold to Khal Drogo by her brother Viserys who hopes to conquer Westeros and take back the Iron Throne. Daenerys in the beginning just wants to go &ldquo;home&rdquo;, but in fact can&acute;t remember &ldquo;home&rdquo;.</p><p>Everyone achieves - as it seems - his or her dreams but they are changed into nightmares. Sansa&acute;s beloved prince and fiance is a monster, Arya is turned into an assassin, Robb dies because he is as gullible as his father, Brans adventures turn him into a semi-human cripple, Jon becomes a commander of the Night&acute;s Watch and gets killed by his own comrades. Daenerys finally arrives in Westeros but it doesn&acute;t feel like home at all. </p><p><b> </b></p><p><b>Lady and the Ghost</b></p><p>All the Stark children are connected with ancient powers and magic. Those powers came to life in the very first episode, when they find their direwolfs. Sansa is the first of the Stark children to loose her wolf and therefor her connection with the magic world. Sansa&acute;s arc is about dealing with a hostile and dangerous world without the help of magic and faith. She struggles &ndash; but she survives by observing, lying, manipulating and learning. She decides to stay a lady anyway: &ldquo;Courtesy is a lady&acute;s armor.&rdquo; And she learns how to rule and how to make a difference: she wants to inspire loyalty by love not fear, she tries to find compromises instead of dictatorship. Season 07 shows how Sansa grows into a leader and that she does well (especially compared to Cersei and Daenerys: Cersei uses fear and is a dictator; Daenerys is loved by her followers but still is a dictator unable to compromise). </p><p>Sansa and Jon have reflecting story arcs. Both believed in songs and legends about knights, princes and ladies. Both were terribly disenchanted when they met with the realities of Kings Landing and Castle Black. Both decided to stand by their ideals, anyway. They learnt everything on their separate ways to become the power couple they are in season 6 &nbsp;- to win back the North and to become the best rulers for the North. Sansa learnt to be modest which enables her to inspire love and admiration. Jon learnt to be more suspicious and to convince his subjects not only by acting but also by talking.</p><p>But it&acute;s too late for them as a romantic couple, it always was: When Sansa Stark meets her &ndash; as both believe &ndash; halfbrother Jon again he literally is a Ghost himself (the forshadowing name he gave his white direwolf in the first episode). Resurrected by Melisandre Jon is a wight by fire as much as Beric is. And &ndash; as Beric puts it: &ldquo;We defend those who can&acute;t defend themselves&rdquo; &ndash; he&acute;s resurrected to fight death, the Army of the Dead, the Night King. That&acute;s his purpose. And his tragic, too: Lady and the Ghost are meant for each other (The show used so many romantic tropes even in season 7, that I can&acute;t believe it&acute;s just incompetence.) But Jon and Sansa are not on the same page anymore: Sansa is a human being while Jon is a wight. </p><p>Both of them are not totally aware of their feelings for each other at the end of season 7, they don&acute;t know about Jons parentage and they don&acute;t know about the consequences of a magic resurrection. For season 8 all these points promise an emotional roller coaster ride. They will realize they aren&acute;t siblings (but just then Jon turns up with his dragon queen and they will have to hide their feelings once again), they will realize their mutual feelings (and just then they will have to hide them from everyone because they won&acute;t want anyone to know about Jon&acute;s inheritance rights) and when a Happy End will seem possible after all, they will have to face the truth about ressurrections and will have to renounce it, so that Jon will have to die again.</p><p>When all is said and done, when the Night King is gone and the realm is secure again, Jon will have fulfilled his destiny while Sansa&acute;s will begin: &nbsp;Sansa will be the elected queen of the Seven Kingdoms. &nbsp;</p><p>The love of Lady and the Ghost will have to stay a dream, perhaps even a dream only the two of them will ever know about. Bittersweet ending.&nbsp;</p><p><b> </b></p><p><b> </b></p><p><b><br /></b></p><p><b>&ldquo;His is the song of Ice and Fire.&rdquo; Songs and Politics</b></p><p>Jon himself is the Song of Ice and Fire. He&acute;s half Dragon, half Wolf. Perhaps his father Rhaegar had a vision or read a prophecy that only a prince, half Stark, half Targaryen would be able to defeat the Night King. Perhaps therefore he eloped with Lyanna Stark and fathered Aegon/Jon. But Rhaegar got it wrong: To change the system, to bring stability to Westeros and to begin a new age not only the Night King (Ice) has to be defeated but also the Targaryen Threat/The Rule of the Dragons (Fire) has to be completely destroyed. The longlasting balance between Ice and Fire is gone with the Wall and can&acute;t be reestablished. Magic has to leave Westeros and Jon is the last magic prince to defeat Ice and Fire by sacrificing himself.</p><p>He has to kill the Night King and Daenerys Targaryen. In the course he will be wounded and burned (the left part of his face). Maybe Daenerys Targaryen who will betray Jon and attack his family (could be she burns Alys Stark because she confuses her with Sansa) will see her mistakes at the very last &nbsp;minute just before she dies and ask for forgiveness. Jon won&acute;t die fast but he will succumb to his wounds in the end. Hopefully he will live long enough to see Sansa on the throne.</p><p><br /></p><p><b> </b></p><p><b>6 Episodes to run</b></p><p>Episode 1</p><p>Tension in Winterfell: The Starks and the Northern Lords won&acute;t be too happy about Jon bending the knee.
