        "body": "<p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">March was\u2026.a chaotic cluster-fuck of something that felt like two weeks tops. March went by <em>fast</em>. And also\u2014wasn\u2019t it <em>just</em> the beginning of the year? Wasn\u2019t it <em>just</em> Christmas? Where\u2019s all this time going?</p><p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Anyway, March was really weird. Full month of university, relatively full weekends I think, it just all felt weird and fast and I don\u2019t even know what exactly I did all month. Well, except watch TV shows. Well, I say TV shows\u2026I mean <em>Doctor Who</em>. And with that, I mean Matt\u2019s arc with Clara, and all of Peter\u2019s arc. Which you already know because I wrote a massive blog post about it, yelling incoherently about all sorts of things and not remotely making sense, I feel.</p><p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">March was definitely a month defined by <em>Doctor Who</em> and specifically Peter Capaldi\u2019s Twelfth Doctor, who I have come to love so much, I still don\u2019t know how to wrap my head around it. I think I\u2019m just gonna have to buy all the DVDs finally and just\u2014watch it again. Because I have emotions and thoughts and ideas and these little bits of <em>je ne sais quoi</em> about so many things in relation to Peter\u2019s wonderful wonderful performance. But I don\u2019t want to spend too much time rambling on about him (again) and waste your time with that.</p><p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">As I said, March was a full month of university. And honestly, it has sort of started to overwhelm me right now. With me being me and having extended one paper deadline to the end of February, and also fucking up one exam of the last term and having to retake that, I completely fell behind on all my actual work that I had to do for this term. There\u2019s one class that I can\u2019t attend but have to take, so I\u2019m working through a book by myself, there\u2019s another book for another course that I ordered way too late, and there\u2019s so much reading that I should be doing and am not actually doing. So I\u2019m totally behind on all things and I often find myself with books open and texts on my kitchen table, throwing highlighters around and post-it\u2019s, trying to get it together, and just ultimately making more of a mess.</p><p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I am very glad Easter holidays are coming up soon so I have time to catch up with that (of course only if I don\u2019t have to work during that week, which somehow might actually happen).</p><p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I also started a new minor this term\u2014theology\u2014(and finally finished art history\u2014never have to do art history ever again!!!!), so that is also a bit of a challenge, though I do feel a lot better about it than I did about art history. It\u2019s really interesting and I\u2019m learning a lot of cool stuff, and I\u2019m actually pretty good at being present in class and taking notes, so at least there\u2019s that. Funny thing is: my theology courses are incredibly affirming of my gender identity and my plans for the future, and a lot of the things I learn support my own views, which is really great.</p><p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Another thing that\u2019s really cool this term, is that I\u2019m trying to hang out in our English department\u2019s tea corner more often, eating lunch there (now that I actually have time to eat lunch on some days), and just trying to socialise more with people. And it\u2019s great! I\u2019m having a lot of lovely conversations with a lot of lovely people, and I think it\u2019s really good for me to do that and just to try and be more open.</p><p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">And honestly, I really like being at university currently? I have a cool group of friends, I\u2019m having a really great time and learning a lot of cool and interesting things (mostly. There\u2019s some rubbish introduction courses that I have to take now). But my problem is, that as soon as I sit in my tram home, as soon as I enter my apartment, I am just flat out exhausted. I am so done. Which is also why I rarely actually get any work done at home currently, because all I really do is maybe eat something small and then fall into bed to maybe watch an episode or two of something and then go to sleep.</p><p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">On that note: Daylight savings time was just last weekend here, and it completely fucked over my internal clock. Like, the day before that, I went to bed at like 1.30AM because I was reading fanfiction (later more on that), and got up very easily the next day even before 10AM. Daylight savings? I went to bed, I think, only a bit after 11PM and had to get up at 7.30AM, and I was absolutely <em>knackered</em>. I immediately dozed off again as soon as I turned off the alarm and it nearly cost me my entire day because I had to catch a train. And it\u2019s still not back to normal, I still have issues every morning getting up. I hope it gets better soon, once I have a day to just sleep in without an alarm and get up whenever I actually wake up. I have hope that this is gonna work.</p><p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">But now: fanfiction! I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ve talked about this on here before, but I was big on fanfiction a few years back, mostly in my <em>BBC Sherlock</em> time. And before that too, I think, way back when I first started really getting into <em>Naruto</em> in a more intellectual way than just watching it on TV. But that was when I was like\u2026.in sixth grade, or something like that. But I was huge on fanfiction for a long time, and I think together with falling off of the <em>Sherlock</em> train after that last season, I also stopped really engaging with that part of fandom. But now, thanks to my binging of <em>Doctor Who</em> I have absolutely fallen down that rabbit hole again. It\u2019s just such a great thing, isn\u2019t it? People creating massive, massive amounts of, essentially free work. Just to express this joy and this love for a thing and to share it with others. It\u2019s amazing.</p><p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">(Short side-note here: Did you know, <em>Archive of Our Own</em>, one of the biggest fanfiction sites, was nominated for a fucking Hugo Award? In its entirety? Making, effectively, over 4.5 MILLION pieces of <em>fanfiction</em> Hugo Award-nominated literature, and, with over 1.8 MILLION users, making many of those Hugo Award-nominated authors? It\u2019s fucking brilliant. What a time to be alive!)</p><p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">What else did I do in March? I\u2019m sort of blanking, because this month went by so fast. Lemme think\u2026.</p><p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I went to see <em>Captain Marvel</em> opening night (which was, officially, Men\u2019s Night, which we crashed, because we wouldn\u2019t usually support such sexist events, but it was <em>Captain Marvel</em>), and then again a bit later one more time, and it was great, just really fantastic. Carol is right up there as one of faves now. Also, Jude Law was hot.</p><p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">On that film note, I obviously watched some stuff this month again and tried to make notes of it. Six movies (well five, but one twice), 64 episodes of TV (50 of which being <em>Doctor Who</em>), and a bunch of shorts starring David Tennant. Aside from <em>Captain Marvel</em> I think the movies I liked best this month were <em>Bad Samaritan (2018)</em> and <em>Fright Night (2011)</em>, both also starring David Tennant, which is why I watched them. <em>Fright Night</em> was great fun, Colin Farrell was a fantastic, sexy vampire, and David\u2019s vampire hunter/Las Vegas magician act was just hilarious. I love how much of a coward he was, ultimately. What a fantastic vampire movie, really funny. Also, Anton Yelchin was in it, and I just realised how much I miss him and what a shame it is that he died so young. He was a great kid and a fantastic actor.</p><p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><em>Bad Samaritan</em> was also really cool. I had wanted to watch it for a while, since it came out actually, because David was in it, and because Dean Devlin directed and produced it, and I really adore his work (<em>Leverage</em> and <em>The Librarians</em>, anyone?) I was always a bit hesitant though, because I\u2019m not very big on films that are too horror-y and gory, so I always pushed it off. But I\u2019m very glad I finally saw it, because it was truly more of a thriller and not a horror movie. Fantastic story, the acting was brilliant (DT as a villain? Come on! So good.), the tension and suspense was absolutely incredible. Really a great movie, you should all watch it.</p><p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I\u2019m sure there\u2019s other things that I did in March that would be worthwhile to mention (was at my dad\u2019s, visited my mom, went shopping with a friend), but I\u2019m really sort of hazy about all the details and I honestly can\u2019t be bothered to write more right now.</p><p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Anyway, I\u2019m having a bit of a break soon\u2014going to Lugano for four days with a friend\u2014so I can hopefully relax a little and recharge my batteries for April.</p><p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Talk to you guys soon! Bye.</p><br/>",

There\u2019s one class that I can\u2019t attend but have to take, so I\u2019m working through a book by myself, there\u2019s another book for another course that I ordered way too late, and there\u2019s so much reading that I should be doing and am not actually doing. So I\u2019m totally behind on all things and I often find myself with books open and texts on my kitchen table, throwing highlighters around and post-it\u2019s, trying to get it together, and just ultimately making more of a mess.</p><p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I am very glad Easter holidays are coming up soon so I have time to catch up with that (of course only if I don\u2019t have to work during that week, which somehow might actually happen).</p><p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I also started a new minor this term\u2014theology\u2014(and finally finished art history\u2014never have to do art history ever again!!!!), so that is also a bit of a challenge, though I do feel a lot better about it than I did about art history. It\u2019s really interesting and I\u2019m learning a lot of cool stuff, and I\u2019m actually pretty good at being present in class and taking notes, so at least there\u2019s that. Funny thing is: my theology courses are incredibly affirming of my gender identity and my plans for the future, and a lot of the things I learn support my own views, which is really great.</p><p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Another thing that\u2019s really cool this term, is that I\u2019m trying to hang out in our English department\u2019s tea corner more often, eating lunch there (now that I actually have time to eat lunch on some days), and just trying to socialise more with people. And it\u2019s great! I\u2019m having a lot of lovely conversations with a lot of lovely people, and I think it\u2019s really good for me to do that and just to try and be more open.</p><p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">And honestly, I really like being at university currently? I have a cool group of friends, I\u2019m having a really great time and learning a lot of cool and interesting things (mostly. There\u2019s some rubbish introduction courses that I have to take now). But my problem is, that as soon as I sit in my tram home, as soon as I enter my apartment, I am just flat out exhausted. I am so done. Which is also why I rarely actually get any work done at home currently, because all I really do is maybe eat something small and then fall into bed to maybe watch an episode or two of something and then go to sleep.</p><p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">On that note: Daylight savings time was just last weekend here, and it completely fucked over my internal clock. Like, the day before that, I went to bed at like 1.30AM because I was reading fanfiction (later more on that), and got up very easily the next day even before 10AM. Daylight savings? I went to bed, I think, only a bit after 11PM and had to get up at 7.30AM, and I was absolutely <em>knackered</em>. I immediately dozed off again as soon as I turned off the alarm and it nearly cost me my entire day because I had to catch a train. And it\u2019s still not back to normal, I still have issues every morning getting up. I hope it gets better soon, once I have a day to just sleep in without an alarm and get up whenever I actually wake up. I have hope that this is gonna work.</p><p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">But now: fanfiction! I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ve talked about this on here before, but I was big on fanfiction a few years back, mostly in my <em>BBC Sherlock</em> time. And before that too, I think, way back when I first started really getting into <em>Naruto</em> in a more intellectual way than just watching it on TV. But that was when I was like\u2026.in sixth grade, or something like that. But I was huge on fanfiction for a long time, and I think together with falling off of the <em>Sherlock</em> train after that last season, I also stopped really engaging with that part of fandom. But now, thanks to my binging of <em>Doctor Who</em> I have absolutely fallen down that rabbit hole again. It\u2019s just such a great thing, isn\u2019t it? People creating massive, massive amounts of, essentially free work. Just to express this joy and this love for a thing and to share it with others. It\u2019s amazing.</p><p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">(Short side-note here: Did you know, <em>Archive of Our Own</em>, one of the biggest fanfiction sites, was nominated for a fucking Hugo Award? In its entirety? Making, effectively, over 4.5 MILLION pieces of <em>fanfiction</em> Hugo Award-nominated literature, and, with over 1.8 MILLION users, making many of those Hugo Award-nominated authors? It\u2019s fucking brilliant. What a time to be alive!)</p><p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">What else did I do in March? I\u2019m sort of blanking, because this month went by so fast. Lemme think\u2026.</p><p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I went to see <em>Captain Marvel</em> opening night (which was, officially, Men\u2019s Night, which we crashed, because we wouldn\u2019t usually support such sexist events, but it was <em>Captain Marvel</em>), and then again a bit later one more time, and it was great, just really fantastic. Carol is right up there as one of faves now. Also, Jude Law was hot.</p><p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">On that film note, I obviously watched some stuff this month again and tried to make notes of it. Six movies (well five, but one twice), 64 episodes of TV (50 of which being <em>Doctor Who</em>), and a bunch of shorts starring David Tennant. Aside from <em>Captain Marvel</em> I think the movies I liked best this month were <em>Bad Samaritan (2018)</em> and <em>Fright Night (2011)</em>, both also starring David Tennant, which is why I watched them. <em>Fright Night</em> was great fun, Colin Farrell was a fantastic, sexy vampire, and David\u2019s vampire hunter/Las Vegas magician act was just hilarious. I love how much of a coward he was, ultimately. What a fantastic vampire movie, really funny. Also, Anton Yelchin was in it, and I just realised how much I miss him and what a shame it is that he died so young. He was a great kid and a fantastic actor.</p><p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><em>Bad Samaritan</em> was also really cool. I had wanted to watch it for a while, since it came out actually, because David was in it, and because Dean Devlin directed and produced it, and I really adore his work (<em>Leverage</em> and <em>The Librarians</em>, anyone?) I was always a bit hesitant though, because I\u2019m not very big on films that are too horror-y and gory, so I always pushed it off. But I\u2019m very glad I finally saw it, because it was truly more of a thriller and not a horror movie. Fantastic story, the acting was brilliant (DT as a villain? Come on! So good.), the tension and suspense was absolutely incredible. Really a great movie, you should all watch it.</p><p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I\u2019m sure there\u2019s other things that I did in March that would be worthwhile to mention (was at my dad\u2019s, visited my mom, went shopping with a friend), but I\u2019m really sort of hazy about all the details and I honestly can\u2019t be bothered to write more right now.</p><p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Anyway, I\u2019m having a bit of a break soon\u2014going to Lugano for four days with a friend\u2014so I can hopefully relax a little and recharge my batteries for April.</p><p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Talk to you guys soon!

                "content": "<p><p>March was&hellip;.a chaotic cluster-fuck of something that felt like two weeks tops. March went by <em>fast</em>. And also&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t it <em>just</em> the beginning of the year? Wasn&rsquo;t it <em>just</em> Christmas? Where&rsquo;s all this time going?</p><p>Anyway, March was really weird. Full month of university, relatively full weekends I think, it just all felt weird and fast and I don&rsquo;t even know what exactly I did all month. Well, except watch TV shows. Well, I say TV shows&hellip;I mean <em>Doctor Who</em>. And with that, I mean Matt&rsquo;s arc with Clara, and all of Peter&rsquo;s arc. Which you already know because I wrote a massive blog post about it, yelling incoherently about all sorts of things and not remotely making sense, I feel.</p><p>March was definitely a month defined by <em>Doctor Who</em> and specifically Peter Capaldi&rsquo;s Twelfth Doctor, who I have come to love so much, I still don&rsquo;t know how to wrap my head around it. I think I&rsquo;m just gonna have to buy all the DVDs finally and just&mdash;watch it again. Because I have emotions and thoughts and ideas and these little bits of <em>je ne sais quoi</em> about so many things in relation to Peter&rsquo;s wonderful wonderful performance. But I don&rsquo;t want to spend too much time rambling on about him (again) and waste your time with that.</p><p>As I said, March was a full month of university.
