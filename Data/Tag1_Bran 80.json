He had buried his feelings so deep,\nthat he could not have said, if he smiled really. Theon\u2019s eyes were wide, but\nhe tried to have a grip on his nerves. His bow was ready.</p><p>\u201cShoot,\nwhen I tell you to, not before.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>He closed\nhis eyes again or his eyes were closed. He didn\u2019t know. He could feel the\nchildrens\u2019 excitement. <i>The dragons will\ndie, I promise.</i> Some of their excitement ebbed away.</p><p>Bran briefly\nchecked on Sansa. <b><i>She was on her way out of the crypts, Olyvar and Ghost by her side. She\nwould know what to do. She had survived Littlefinger</i></b>. Bran did not dare\nto check on Arya. Time was getting short.</p><p>The dragons\ncircled the sky. It was strange to watch them. They had an undeniable beauty.\nThe silver light of dawn was painting patterns on their scales, and Bran\nwondered if the would ever see a wondrous sight like that again. </p><p>Winterfell\u2019s\ntowers went up in huge explosions. Bran could see the green light even through\nhis closed lids. A huge curtain of light appeared in the sky or maybe he just felt\nit in his mind. He sensed the White Walkers being pulled behind that curtain.\nThe voices of the children shouted in triumph. Then Bran heard the shrieks of\nRhaegal, and so strong was his connection that it was as if he himself fell. He\ncould feel how the earth and water magic was set free, the scales swung. The\nchildren bore on his mind heavier than ever before. </p><p>He fled to\nthe dragon, merged with the dragon, relishing in his fire and fearing it. Through\nthe dragon\u2019s eyes he saw Jon. Jon had fallen on the dragon. Rhaegal had turned\nto protect his rider. Bran felt the dragon\u2019s trust and flared it highly. For\nthis it was crucial that Rhaegal trusted them. </p><p><i>Jon! </i>His cousin groaned and picked himself up with\ndifficulty. He had blood on his face and held his hand over his left eyebrow,\nwhere he had been cut deeply. <i>Jon!</i></p><p>Jon half\nwalked half crawled to the dragon\u2019s snout. \u201cBran is that you?\u201d</p><p><i>Yes, Jon, you have to set Rhaegal free, now!\nYou have to do it!</i></p><p>Jon was\nclearly dazed. \u201cSet him free?\u201d</p><p><i>Fire made flesh. Set him free, so that he can\nbe pure fire again.</i></p><p>Bran saw\ntears running down his cousin\u2019s eyes, they mixed with the blood on his face. \u201cYou\nmean I have to kill him? Why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p><i>No, send him home, set him free. He\u2019ll do it by\nchoice.</i></p><p>Bran could\nfeel that Jon joined him in Rhaegal\u2019s mind. The dragon was in pain, but he trusted.\nHe went all still, as if he knew it was important. </p><p>Bran could\nfeel the children hammering at his mind urging him to hurry, pleading with him\nto just kill the dragon and be done with it. The other dragon was flying fast\nto the weirwood.</p><p>Bran could\nhear his own heavy breathing echoing in his ear even though he was in Rhaegal\u2019s\nmind, but he did not relent. Jon had already begun to remove the earth around\nRhaegal\u2019s fire. The coals of the dragon\u2019s mind burned in a steady beat. Bran\nhelped along and he could feel the dragon\u2019s mind picking up heat. </p><p>\u201cWhat do I\ndo now?\u201d Jon asked loudly. Bran could feel the dragon slipping out of their\ncontrol, but he still trusted. </p><p><i>Show him the way to his light, to his fire, the\nfire behind the curtain of shadow.</i></p><p>Bran felt confusion\nfrom Jon, confusion and hurt. \u201cWhy do I have to do this? Why did you not tell\nme, that this would be necessary?\u201d</p><p><i>Please, just do it. You have been beyond the\nveil, I can\u2019t do this. If we bring just one dragon home beyond the veil, the\nother will follow, eventually. Fire magic has to die, as well as ice magic.</i></p><p>Jon\nunderstood. He embraced the fire in the dragon\u2019s mind, took it into himself and\nthen Bran could feel him no longer. His body had slumped at the head of the\ndragon and Bran was thrown into his own body again. </p><p>Theon shook\nhim and pointed. \u201cThe dragon, the dragon.\u201d The children in his mind were\nscreaming as well. The pressure in his mind was less. In their fear they\nfinally let lose their grip on his mind. The huge black dragon hovered over the\nweirwood. Bran could see Daenerys on his back, her silver hair flowing behind\nher, she was bathed in the eerie light of the wildfire that still burned.</p><p>Bran did\nnot allow himself to smile. It wouldn\u2019t serve to alert them to his real plan.</p><p>\u201cNow,\nTheon, now! Aim true.\u201d</p><p>Theon\u2019s\narrow flew at the same moment that Drogon opened his jaws and bathed the\nweirwood in flames. The children shrieked in horror. </p><p>Theon\u2019s\narrow found the eye of the dragon, made stronger by the destruction of the\nweirwood and the loosening of its magic.</p><p>The dragon\nfaltered. Bran became dizzy with the impact of the scales of the world dancing\nwildly. </p><p>Theon\nloosened another arrow. This one took Drogon in the other eye and he fell. </p><p>Time\nslowed, the world was on the edge of destruction, the voices of the children\nwere raging at him, screaming betrayal, but they became fainter, as the fire\nate up the weirwood. Drogon fell onto the burning tree, but as he touched the\nground, he was pulled. For a brief moment, there was a shadow curtain that\nstood black against the sky, and then the dragon was gone. </p><p>The scales\nstill swung, but their rhythm slowed down. It felt like an eternity. Theon was\nbreathing heavily at his side, as if he had run for miles. He probably felt how\nnarrowly they had evaded the end of the world.</p><p>The scales\ncame to an almost halt, but they were not all balanced. They were tipped just a\ntiny bit. Bran could feel a small spark of fire magic, a tiny spark, a life\nspark. He smiled. <i>Jon is alive!</i></p><p>The\nchildrens\u2019 voices had become very faint, but still they insisted. They wanted\nhim to tread on that tiny spark. But he wasn\u2019t theirs to control. Not any\nlonger. And there was another way.</p><p>\u201cTheon,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cYou still have one arrow?\u201d He stretched out his hand.</p><p>Theon gave\nit to him. </p><p><i>You attuned me to your magic.</i> He knew the children would hear\nhim. <i>You gave me a tool to bring balance.</i></p><p>He took the\narrow and picked up the magic, changing it to the ice magic that was the\nopposite of fire. It flowed into him, as if it had been meant to do that. The\narrow vanished. The scales came to a halt, balanced. </p><p>All of a\nsudden, Bran could feel, he looked at the dawn and sunrays touched his face and\nhe laughed, he laughed. He could feel everything. He could feel his own heart\nbeating, he could feel the breath in his lungs, he could feel the blood pumping\nthrough his veins, everywhere. He pushed himself up, he could feel his legs. <i>He could feel his legs</i>. But they were to\nweak to carry him and he wobbled and fell. His eyes met the blackened ground\nwhere the dragon had fallen on the weirwood, and where Daenerys lay, bundled\nlike a puppet. And then he wept.</p>",

Why did you not tell\nme, that this would be necessary?\u201d</p><p><i>Please, just do it. You have been beyond the\nveil, I can\u2019t do this.

Bran could see Daenerys on his back, her silver hair flowing behind\nher, she was bathed in the eerie light of the wildfire that still burned.</p><p>Bran did\nnot allow himself to smile.

The children shrieked in horror. </p><p>Theon\u2019s\narrow found the eye of the dragon, made stronger by the destruction of the\nweirwood and the loosening of its magic.</p><p>The dragon\nfaltered. Bran became dizzy with the impact of the scales of the world dancing\nwildly. </p><p>Theon\nloosened another arrow. This one took Drogon in the other eye and he fell. </p><p>Time\nslowed, the world was on the edge of destruction, the voices of the children\nwere raging at him, screaming betrayal, but they became fainter, as the fire\nate up the weirwood. Drogon fell onto the burning tree, but as he touched the\nground, he was pulled. For a brief moment, there was a shadow curtain that\nstood black against the sky, and then the dragon was gone. </p><p>The scales\nstill swung, but their rhythm slowed down. It felt like an eternity. Theon was\nbreathing heavily at his side, as if he had run for miles. He probably felt how\nnarrowly they had evaded the end of the world.</p><p>The scales\ncame to an almost halt, but they were not all balanced. They were tipped just a\ntiny bit. Bran could feel a small spark of fire magic, a tiny spark, a life\nspark. He smiled. <i>Jon is alive!</i></p><p>The\nchildrens\u2019 voices had become very faint, but still they insisted. They wanted\nhim to tread on that tiny spark. But he wasn\u2019t theirs to control. Not any\nlonger. And there was another way.</p><p>\u201cTheon,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cYou still have one arrow?\u201d He stretched out his hand.</p><p>Theon gave\nit to him. </p><p><i>You attuned me to your magic.</i> He knew the children would hear\nhim. <i>You gave me a tool to bring balance.</i></p><p>He took the\narrow and picked up the magic, changing it to the ice magic that was the\nopposite of fire.

He could feel his own heart\nbeating, he could feel the breath in his lungs, he could feel the blood pumping\nthrough his veins, everywhere. He pushed himself up, he could feel his legs. <i>He could feel his legs</i>. But they were to\nweak to carry him and he wobbled and fell. His eyes met the blackened ground\nwhere the dragon had fallen on the weirwood, and where Daenerys lay, bundled\nlike a puppet. And then he wept.</p>",

He could feel the\nchildrens\u2019 excitement. <i>The dragons will\ndie, I promise.</i> Some of their excitement ebbed away.</p><p>Bran briefly\nchecked on Sansa. <b><i>She was on her way out of the crypts, Olyvar and Ghost by her side.

They had an undeniable beauty.\nThe silver light of dawn was painting patterns on their scales, and Bran\nwondered if the would ever see a wondrous sight like that again. </p><p>Winterfell\u2019s\ntowers went up in huge explosions. Bran could see the green light even through\nhis closed lids. A huge curtain of light appeared in the sky or maybe he just felt\nit in his mind. He sensed the White Walkers being pulled behind that curtain.\nThe voices of the children shouted in triumph. Then Bran heard the shrieks of\nRhaegal, and so strong was his connection that it was as if he himself fell. He\ncould feel how the earth and water magic was set free, the scales swung. The\nchildren bore on his mind heavier than ever before. </p><p>He fled to\nthe dragon, merged with the dragon, relishing in his fire and fearing it. Through\nthe dragon\u2019s eyes he saw Jon. Jon had fallen on the dragon. Rhaegal had turned\nto protect his rider. Bran felt the dragon\u2019s trust and flared it highly. For\nthis it was crucial that Rhaegal trusted them. </p><p><i>Jon! </i>His cousin groaned and picked himself up with\ndifficulty. He had blood on his face and held his hand over his left eyebrow,\nwhere he had been cut deeply. <i>Jon!</i></p><p>Jon half\nwalked half crawled to the dragon\u2019s snout. \u201cBran is that you?\u201d</p><p><i>Yes, Jon, you have to set Rhaegal free, now!\nYou have to do it!</i></p><p>Jon was\nclearly dazed. \u201cSet him free?\u201d</p><p><i>Fire made flesh. Set him free, so that he can\nbe pure fire again.</i></p><p>Bran saw\ntears running down his cousin\u2019s eyes, they mixed with the blood on his face. \u201cYou\nmean I have to kill him? Why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p><i>No, send him home, set him free. He\u2019ll do it by\nchoice.</i></p><p>Bran could\nfeel that Jon joined him in Rhaegal\u2019s mind.

Dany giving in to her dragon side and Tyrion becoming even more nihilistic than he was in ADWD.  I also think that the Starks (including Jon Snow) will take darker paths in TWOW.  I believe the danger they face is that they will let the cold in and all the horrors that they have suffered will cause them to become more callous 1/2",

An expectation of monstrosity as an unchangeable trait of Tyrion\u2019s broke him down to a point that set him on the dark path he is currently on. But people don\u2019t <i>innately</i> have an inner monster that they need to defeat to be good or compassionate. <br/></p><p>That said, I do agree that we\u2019re going to see the Big Six taking darker paths in TWoW. They are all already on their way there to varying extents but the slide is perhaps clearer in some stories than others. Bran is one of the characters who is reasonably into that part of his arc with his repeated skinchanging into Hodor. Skinchanging a human has been established as an abomination and a pretty terrible thing to do that it\u2019s been described as akin to rape. Thistle brutalizes herself in her resistance to Varamyr\u2019s violation of her mind, and Hodor is always quietly terrified of Bran\u2019s intrusion that he retreats into his own mind. Yet Bran keeps skinchanging Hodor and using his body to do what he wants disregarding Hodor\u2019s agency, consent, bodily autonomy and abject fear and hatred of what Bran is forcing on him, which will come to head with the incident of \u201chold the door\u201d when Bran forces Hodor to sacrifice himself for Bran\u2019s and Meera\u2019s survival. That repeated violation of Hodor\u2019s personhood and autonomy is informed by a great deal of ableism on Bran\u2019s part since he stops treating Hodor as a person and instead turns him into a means to an end, a meat suit to ride and give back when he is done. But Hodor\u2019s body isn\u2019t Bran\u2019s to use and ultimately Bran has to recognize that he has monumentally violated a person, a loyal friend who has been instrumental in Bran\u2019s journey no less, to his grave largely because he dismissed Hodor\u2019s personhood due to his disability.</p><p>\nArya\u2019s darker path will probably have to do with the possibility of her giving into \nvengeance. Her story has had motifs of vengeance and justice for the \nlongest time, and the principles of the House of Black and White are one\n more stressor she has to contend with. While most of Arya\u2019s kills have \nfallen on the justice side, she has killed on the kindly man\u2019s orders, \nand she is set for a confrontation with the Faceless Men over her \nunlicensed kill of Raff the Sweetling that might push her to focus on \nher list as she fully reclaims the identity of Arya Stark. I think Arya \nreturns to Westeros with the express goal of finishing off those on her \nlist as the fine line between vengeance and justice gets really blurred.\n Meeting Lady Stoneheart and BwB will be the culmination of that arc in \nthat it demonstrates the possible perils of having vengeance as a goal, \nhow easy it is for justice and vengeance to get conflated, and how \nkilling the people on her list won\u2019t make her feel better. It is a \nreturn to \u201cJoffrey was dead, but if Robb was dead too, what did it \nmatter?\u201d that will shift Arya\u2019s path back to seeking out her siblings \nrather than trying to cross names off her list.\n\n<br/></p><p>Sansa\u2019s arc will probably revolve around a question of complicity. Littlefinger has put a lot of effort into making Sansa his accomplice. He made her a part of Joffrey\u2019s murder without her knowledge but then shifted to making her a conscious accomplice in his schemes by involving her in the coverup of Lysa\u2019s murder and framing Marillion. And despite the fact that Sansa hasn\u2019t put it together yet, Littlefinger is fairly open about a few of his more nefarious plans with her. But she does have the necessary information to eventually deduce that he is the one behind Jon Arryn\u2019s murder and that he is currently slowly poisoning Robert Arryn. I think Sansa reaches a point where she realizes the more egregious of Petyr\u2019s crimes and faces the choice of keeping her silence or exposing him. I suspect that learning about Petyr\u2019s betrayal of Ned and/or what he did to Jeyne Poole might be the tipping point in her arc.<br/></p>",

That repeated violation of Hodor\u2019s personhood and autonomy is informed by a great deal of ableism on Bran\u2019s part since he stops treating Hodor as a person and instead turns him into a means to an end, a meat suit to ride and give back when he is done. But Hodor\u2019s body isn\u2019t Bran\u2019s to use and ultimately Bran has to recognize that he has monumentally violated a person, a loyal friend who has been instrumental in Bran\u2019s journey no less, to his grave largely because he dismissed Hodor\u2019s personhood due to his disability.</p><p>\nArya\u2019s darker path will probably have to do with the possibility of her giving into \nvengeance. Her story has had motifs of vengeance and justice for the \nlongest time, and the principles of the House of Black and White are one\n more stressor she has to contend with. While most of Arya\u2019s kills have \nfallen on the justice side, she has killed on the kindly man\u2019s orders, \nand she is set for a confrontation with the Faceless Men over her \nunlicensed kill of Raff the Sweetling that might push her to focus on \nher list as she fully reclaims the identity of Arya Stark. I think Arya \nreturns to Westeros with the express goal of finishing off those on her \nlist as the fine line between vengeance and justice gets really blurred.\n Meeting Lady Stoneheart and BwB will be the culmination of that arc in \nthat it demonstrates the possible perils of having vengeance as a goal, \nhow easy it is for justice and vengeance to get conflated, and how \nkilling the people on her list won\u2019t make her feel better. It is a \nreturn to \u201cJoffrey was dead, but if Robb was dead too, what did it \nmatter?\u201d that will shift Arya\u2019s path back to seeking out her siblings \nrather than trying to cross names off her list.\n\n<br></p><p>Sansa\u2019s arc will probably revolve around a question of complicity. Littlefinger has put a lot of effort into making Sansa his accomplice. He made her a part of Joffrey\u2019s murder without her knowledge but then shifted to making her a conscious accomplice in his schemes by involving her in the coverup of Lysa\u2019s murder and framing Marillion. And despite the fact that Sansa hasn\u2019t put it together yet, Littlefinger is fairly open about a few of his more nefarious plans with her. But she does have the necessary information to eventually deduce that he is the one behind Jon Arryn\u2019s murder and that he is currently slowly poisoning Robert Arryn. I think Sansa reaches a point where she realizes the more egregious of Petyr\u2019s crimes and faces the choice of keeping her silence or exposing him. I suspect that learning about Petyr\u2019s betrayal of Ned and/or what he did to Jeyne Poole might be the tipping point in her arc.<br></p></p>",
