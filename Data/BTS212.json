Undeniably you did it again, the warm blood running down your throat, warming your ice cold body, crimson red rivers running between the valleys of yours breasts and oh were you the most delightful play for him to see.\u00a0</p><p>He always loved to see you toy around with your victims, especially on your first kills. He loved how you flinched around when your lips touched for the first time their necks, when you had the very first few drops of blood touch your tongue. He said it was the most erotic scene that would play in front of his eyes.</p><p>Never did he deny you of anything, victim after victim he would follow you to see you act it out; the character you had for them, that one of the helpless romantic and shy girl.</p><p>Men of that time fell in love with shy girls so that is what you offered them. This is how he became your begetter, your maker, your god. Through your eyes he saw the opportunity of having a chance to wreck the minds of men he despised, men who did not deserve to live among his world.</p><p>Without coercion you followed him, your steps fitting so well in his path, his thoughts and perspective matched perfectly with your twisted mind. You never knew how disturbed your mind was till you met him.</p><p>Dean.. Only by the sound of his name you got hooked.\u00a0Kwon Hyuk was his Korean name but now living in Japan he wanted to change it and stay unknown, something that was relatively hard because of his looks.</p><p>Whenever you stared into his eyes, his intoxicating dark eyes, it felt as if you were floating in a swimming pool and when you heard him talking, whispering to you stories from different eras of his life, it felt as if the ocean came to hug you, nature\u2019s beautiful wet kiss.</p><p>This is what he meant to you, a beautiful creature, a man who walked into your life with an offer of eternal life, a promise to turn you into an ethereal being that would never feel pain or loneliness. A beautiful lie.</p><p>The fever of hunger and maniac hunting was never ending, no mercy on your soul; you did not know if you had a soul anymore but the craving you had was ruthless. It consumed you whole, sometimes in pieces. Day by day you felt the need to stop this unending desire by murdering whole families in your path.\u00a0</p><p>Blood, more blood. Hunger, endless hunger.\u00a0</p><p>You did not know how to make it stop, no solution to be found for your riddle.</p><p>\u201cDean, I still feel it. I still feel empty\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You were in the verge of crying, you still somehow felt empty even though you have consumed much more blood than ever before. The cold floor under you knees felt comfortingly soothing for the feverishness on your hot skin.</p><p>Dean\u2019s eyes scanned you, he was too wondering how after all those months you could not still learn how to control your thirst. Deep down inside he knew you could face problems because you were his first creation, a newborn siren in need of blood.</p><p>No matter how unknown the problems could be, there was no chance you needed more blood. You had consumed a whole town those couple of months. How much more lustful could you be than that?</p><p>That thought was that made Dean\u2019s lips turn into a smirk. He knelt down to your level to look directly into your eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you feel empty, love?\u201d</p><p>Without hesitation you showed him right between your legs, Dean about to laugh but when he noticed your watery eyes he understood you were not joking. He forgot you two were hundreds of years apart, the slight chance of you knowing anything about anything perverted. And he was happy you were innocent in that part, a part of him that could never change would find salvation within you, inside the untouched part of your pure mind.</p><p>Dean dried away your tears, his thumb ever carefully swiping the teary corners of yours eyes, his soft, warm palm cupping your cheek and like a lost, lonely child you leaned on his hand and looked into the dark pool of his eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt will be gone in a few minutes. Do you want me to teach you how to ignore it and make it go away, love?\u201d</p><p>You nodded and listened as if your life depended on it. Dean asked to always take deep breaths and think about the deep blue sky. It never helped in the beginning, made you think you were not doing it properly and it could end up killing you. As the time went by you got used to the feeling, ignoring it for most of the time until you learned to live with it.</p><p>Decades went by, you and Dean learned so much about each other, he taught you how to lure even the strongest minded people, how to trick them, how to make them bend to your will, how to lure them into their death, ways to get into their minds and thoughts even when they built walls to protect things from you. You learned how to infiltrate into anyone\u2019s mind, Dean so proud that he trusted you with his life.</p><p>-</p><p>Dean had been away for a very long time and you awaited for him, desperate to have him back and learn about these other countries in Europe. You wore one of your prettiest dresses and sat down to the living room but the time went so slow that you eventually fell asleep.</p><p>A sudden noise woke you up, a voice in far distance alarmed you that somebody was inside the house; the only problem was that that somebody was not Dean. It was a woman\u2019s voice. When you were ready to storm inside Dean\u2019s chamber, you heard his voice whispering something and the woman moaning slightly.</p><p>Your first thought was that Dean must have brought home a gift for you, a woman to toy with. Your assumptions were wrong when you peaked through the half closed door.</p><p>The confusing image of Dean hovering over the woman, the woman looking wrecked but not in a bad way and him looking so different from any other time you had seen him. You could see him whispering to her, now Dean sitting on the edge of the bed and the woman on his lap, moving on top of him so furiously.\u00a0</p><p>In a weird way, you felt so enchanted, the emptiness you had been feeling for so long was about to burst. The longer you looked at his face, the more you wanted to be that woman. His face was what people would call love. Everything you dreamed of.</p><p>The noises the woman was making, low, soft moans, whimpers, how her body was so close to his, how it would feel to have Dean move under you. You could not see his face clearly now because of the darkness in the room but his low grunts sounded heavenly.</p><p>For a moment you thought of staying a little bit more there, to see what else would happen but your knees became weak and something felt strange. You quickly ran back to the living room, hopeful you were not caught by Dean. After a few minutes you fell asleep again on the sofa, the fireplace keeping you warm from the cold, the memory of Dean\u2019s face haunting your dreams.</p><p>-</p><p>The next couple of weeks went by but still your curious self would not let go of what was the thing that Dean was doing with that woman. You felt rebellious, your talents may come handy at last, a decision of sneaking into Dean\u2019s chambers after you poured up too much alcohol into his daily drink.</p><p>You carefully sat on top of him, your hands on each side of his head, eyes closed as you started wondering inside of his mind. The images you saw creeping inside his mind was not what you expected or wanted to see.\u00a0</p><p>You tried focusing on the moments you saw the girl on top of him, the feeling of that lustful sensation, how erotic and divine it felt. When you were about to focus all of your senses to that scene, the big tree came back right before your eyes and a small girl, only a few years younger than you, was about to get bitten by someone who looked like the demons Dean talked you about in one of his long stories.</p><p>Dean was screaming, the little girl now laying dead, soulless under the big tree, surrounded by other people, the demons now disappearing into thin air with a look of pure satisfaction. You could feel Dean\u2019s deep pain when he knelt over the girl\u2019s body.</p><p>He was heartbroken; his hand reached out to touch the little girl\u2019s body and all you felt was pure innocence. The words that Dean used to keep describing you as. A killer by instinct but a pure innocent heart. The same as lions. They only kill because they need to feed. They are not evil.</p><p>And with that last thought, Dean woke up. Nothing evil into his eyes, no anger regardless of your actions- the one thing you saw was wonder. Before he could speak, you answered to his question.</p><p>\u201cI only wanted to know what you did with that lady in your chambers. That night you came back from your trip in Europe, you came back with a lady and you did something. You seemed so excited and happy. And that lady too. I want to make you feel the same\u201d you said in a trembling voice, your eyes never leaving his.\u00a0\u201cPlease. You promised no secrets.\u201d</p><p>With one quick move you found yourself under him, one hand on the headboard while with the other he caressed your cheek with his fingertips. He had touched you so many times but it never felt like that. His touch was light like feather but it felt so warm, you felt so small under his touch.\u00a0</p><p>Once again you felt feverish, hungry, empty.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you want, love\u201d His voice covered in lace, eyes burning on my skin</p><p>\u201cI do not want to feel empty anymore. I need you to make me feel complete.\u201d you almost purred in soft voice</p><p>Dean leaned down with eyes half closed, his soft lips touching yours in an attempt to kiss you but you were shivering under him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cRelax, love.\u201d he whispered to you.</p><p>And that you did.</p><p>He started kissing you again, every kiss having you melt into his hands, every touch reaching closer to the emptiness you felt.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMy soul will always belong with you. You are my love. But if they find out about you, it will all be gone. Let me have you for tonight and I will let you go tomorrow..\u201d</p><p>Dean undressed you so carefully with his eyes piercing every part of you that was naked before him, fingers exploring all of you, both of you naked on his bed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLook at me. Look into my eyes\u201d he asked you</p><p>With no warning you felt him inside you but you had no regrets, this is what you asked for even if it hurt for a little while.\u00a0</p><p>And for the first time you felt so loved, so complete, so alive. And while he kept touching you, you were more and more sure he loved you. So much, so deep.</p><p>And that was the first time you heard him saying something you never heard him saying before.</p><p>\u201cEver thine, ever mine, ever ours\u201d\u00a0</p>",

Dean asked to always take deep breaths and think about the deep blue sky. It never helped in the beginning, made you think you were not doing it properly and it could end up killing you. As the time went by you got used to the feeling, ignoring it for most of the time until you learned to live with it.</p><p>Decades went by, you and Dean learned so much about each other, he taught you how to lure even the strongest minded people, how to trick them, how to make them bend to your will, how to lure them into their death, ways to get into their minds and thoughts even when they built walls to protect things from you. You learned how to infiltrate into anyone\u2019s mind, Dean so proud that he trusted you with his life.</p><p>-</p><p>Dean had been away for a very long time and you awaited for him, desperate to have him back and learn about these other countries in Europe. You wore one of your prettiest dresses and sat down to the living room but the time went so slow that you eventually fell asleep.</p><p>A sudden noise woke you up, a voice in far distance alarmed you that somebody was inside the house; the only problem was that that somebody was not Dean. It was a woman\u2019s voice. When you were ready to storm inside Dean\u2019s chamber, you heard his voice whispering something and the woman moaning slightly.</p><p>Your first thought was that Dean must have brought home a gift for you, a woman to toy with. Your assumptions were wrong when you peaked through the half closed door.</p><p>The confusing image of Dean hovering over the woman, the woman looking wrecked but not in a bad way and him looking so different from any other time you had seen him. You could see him whispering to her, now Dean sitting on the edge of the bed and the woman on his lap, moving on top of him so furiously.\u00a0</p><p>In a weird way, you felt so enchanted, the emptiness you had been feeling for so long was about to burst. The longer you looked at his face, the more you wanted to be that woman. His face was what people would call love. Everything you dreamed of.</p><p>The noises the woman was making, low, soft moans, whimpers, how her body was so close to his, how it would feel to have Dean move under you. You could not see his face clearly now because of the darkness in the room but his low grunts sounded heavenly.</p><p>For a moment you thought of staying a little bit more there, to see what else would happen but your knees became weak and something felt strange. You quickly ran back to the living room, hopeful you were not caught by Dean. After a few minutes you fell asleep again on the sofa, the fireplace keeping you warm from the cold, the memory of Dean\u2019s face haunting your dreams.</p><p>-</p><p>The next couple of weeks went by but still your curious self would not let go of what was the thing that Dean was doing with that woman. You felt rebellious, your talents may come handy at last, a decision of sneaking into Dean\u2019s chambers after you poured up too much alcohol into his daily drink.</p><p>You carefully sat on top of him, your hands on each side of his head, eyes closed as you started wondering inside of his mind. The images you saw creeping inside his mind was not what you expected or wanted to see.\u00a0</p><p>You tried focusing on the moments you saw the girl on top of him, the feeling of that lustful sensation, how erotic and divine it felt. When you were about to focus all of your senses to that scene, the big tree came back right before your eyes and a small girl, only a few years younger than you, was about to get bitten by someone who looked like the demons Dean talked you about in one of his long stories.</p><p>Dean was screaming, the little girl now laying dead, soulless under the big tree, surrounded by other people, the demons now disappearing into thin air with a look of pure satisfaction. You could feel Dean\u2019s deep pain when he knelt over the girl\u2019s body.</p><p>He was heartbroken; his hand reached out to touch the little girl\u2019s body and all you felt was pure innocence. The words that Dean used to keep describing you as. A killer by instinct but a pure innocent heart. The same as lions. They only kill because they need to feed. They are not evil.</p><p>And with that last thought, Dean woke up. Nothing evil into his eyes, no anger regardless of your actions- the one thing you saw was wonder. Before he could speak, you answered to his question.</p><p>\u201cI only wanted to know what you did with that lady in your chambers. That night you came back from your trip in Europe, you came back with a lady and you did something. You seemed so excited and happy. And that lady too. I want to make you feel the same\u201d you said in a trembling voice, your eyes never leaving his.\u00a0\u201cPlease. You promised no secrets.\u201d</p><p>With one quick move you found yourself under him, one hand on the headboard while with the other he caressed your cheek with his fingertips. He had touched you so many times but it never felt like that. His touch was light like feather but it felt so warm, you felt so small under his touch.\u00a0</p><p>Once again you felt feverish, hungry, empty.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you want, love\u201d His voice covered in lace, eyes burning on my skin</p><p>\u201cI do not want to feel empty anymore. I need you to make me feel complete.\u201d you almost purred in soft voice</p><p>Dean leaned down with eyes half closed, his soft lips touching yours in an attempt to kiss you but you were shivering under him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cRelax, love.\u201d he whispered to you.</p><p>And that you did.</p><p>He started kissing you again, every kiss having you melt into his hands, every touch reaching closer to the emptiness you felt.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMy soul will always belong with you. You are my love. But if they find out about you, it will all be gone. Let me have you for tonight and I will let you go tomorrow..\u201d</p><p>Dean undressed you so carefully with his eyes piercing every part of you that was naked before him, fingers exploring all of you, both of you naked on his bed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLook at me. Look into my eyes\u201d he asked you</p><p>With no warning you felt him inside you but you had no regrets, this is what you asked for even if it hurt for a little while.\u00a0</p><p>And for the first time you felt so loved, so complete, so alive. And while he kept touching you, you were more and more sure he loved you. So much, so deep.</p><p>And that was the first time you heard him saying something you never heard him saying before.</p><p>\u201cEver thine, ever mine, ever ours\u201d\u00a0</p></p>",

Undeniably you did it again, the warm blood running down your throat, warming your ice cold body, crimson red rivers running between the valleys of yours breasts and oh were you the most delightful play for him to see.\u00a0</p><p>He always loved to see you toy around with your victims, especially on your first kills. He loved how you flinched around when your lips touched for the first time their necks, when you had the very first few drops of blood touch your tongue. He said it was the most erotic scene that would play in front of his eyes.</p><p>Never did he deny you of anything, victim after victim he would follow you to see you act it out; the character you had for them, that one of the helpless romantic and shy girl.</p><p>Men of that time fell in love with shy girls so that is what you offered them. This is how he became your begetter, your maker, your god. Through your eyes he saw the opportunity of having a chance to wreck the minds of men he despised, men who did not deserve to live among his world.</p><p>Without coercion you followed him, your steps fitting so well in his path, his thoughts and perspective matched perfectly with your twisted mind. You never knew how disturbed your mind was till you met him.</p><p>Dean.. Only by the sound of his name you got hooked.\u00a0Kwon Hyuk was his Korean name but now living in Japan he wanted to change it and stay unknown, something that was relatively hard because of his looks.</p><p>Whenever you stared into his eyes, his intoxicating dark eyes, it felt as if you were floating in a swimming pool and when you heard him talking, whispering to you stories from different eras of his life, it felt as if the ocean came to hug you, nature\u2019s beautiful wet kiss.</p><p>This is what he meant to you, a beautiful creature, a man who walked into your life with an offer of eternal life, a promise to turn you into an ethereal being that would never feel pain or loneliness. A beautiful lie.</p><p>The fever of hunger and maniac hunting was never ending, no mercy on your soul; you did not know if you had a soul anymore but the craving you had was ruthless. It consumed you whole, sometimes in pieces. Day by day you felt the need to stop this unending desire by murdering whole families in your path.\u00a0</p><p>Blood, more blood. Hunger, endless hunger.\u00a0</p><p>You did not know how to make it stop, no solution to be found for your riddle.</p><p>\u201cDean, I still feel it. I still feel empty\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You were in the verge of crying, you still somehow felt empty even though you have consumed much more blood than ever before. The cold floor under you knees felt comfortingly soothing for the feverishness on your hot skin.</p><p>Dean\u2019s eyes scanned you, he was too wondering how after all those months you could not still learn how to control your thirst. Deep down inside he knew you could face problems because you were his first creation, a newborn siren in need of blood.</p><p>No matter how unknown the problems could be, there was no chance you needed more blood. You had consumed a whole town those couple of months. How much more lustful could you be than that?</p><p>That thought was that made Dean\u2019s lips turn into a smirk. He knelt down to your level to look directly into your eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you feel empty, love?\u201d</p><p>Without hesitation you showed him right between your legs, Dean about to laugh but when he noticed your watery eyes he understood you were not joking. He forgot you two were hundreds of years apart, the slight chance of you knowing anything about anything perverted. And he was happy you were innocent in that part, a part of him that could never change would find salvation within you, inside the untouched part of your pure mind.</p><p>Dean dried away your tears, his thumb ever carefully swiping the teary corners of yours eyes, his soft, warm palm cupping your cheek and like a lost, lonely child you leaned on his hand and looked into the dark pool of his eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt will be gone in a few minutes. Do you want me to teach you how to ignore it and make it go away, love?\u201d</p><p>You nodded and listened as if your life depended on it. Dean asked to always take deep breaths and think about the deep blue sky. It never helped in the beginning, made you think you were not doing it properly and it could end up killing you. As the time went by you got used to the feeling, ignoring it for most of the time until you learned to live with it.</p><p>Decades went by, you and Dean learned so much about each other, he taught you how to lure even the strongest minded people, how to trick them, how to make them bend to your will, how to lure them into their death, ways to get into their minds and thoughts even when they built walls to protect things from you. You learned how to infiltrate into anyone\u2019s mind, Dean so proud that he trusted you with his life.</p><p>-</p><p>Dean had been away for a very long time and you awaited for him, desperate to have him back and learn about these other countries in Europe.

It was a woman\u2019s voice. When you were ready to storm inside Dean\u2019s chamber, you heard his voice whispering something and the woman moaning slightly.</p><p>Your first thought was that Dean must have brought home a gift for you, a woman to toy with.

Everything you dreamed of.</p><p>The noises the woman was making, low, soft moans, whimpers, how her body was so close to his, how it would feel to have Dean move under you. You could not see his face clearly now because of the darkness in the room but his low grunts sounded heavenly.</p><p>For a moment you thought of staying a little bit more there, to see what else would happen but your knees became weak and something felt strange. You quickly ran back to the living room, hopeful you were not caught by Dean. After a few minutes you fell asleep again on the sofa, the fireplace keeping you warm from the cold, the memory of Dean\u2019s face haunting your dreams.</p><p>-</p><p>The next couple of weeks went by but still your curious self would not let go of what was the thing that Dean was doing with that woman. You felt rebellious, your talents may come handy at last, a decision of sneaking into Dean\u2019s chambers after you poured up too much alcohol into his daily drink.</p><p>You carefully sat on top of him, your hands on each side of his head, eyes closed as you started wondering inside of his mind. The images you saw creeping inside his mind was not what you expected or wanted to see.\u00a0</p><p>You tried focusing on the moments you saw the girl on top of him, the feeling of that lustful sensation, how erotic and divine it felt. When you were about to focus all of your senses to that scene, the big tree came back right before your eyes and a small girl, only a few years younger than you, was about to get bitten by someone who looked like the demons Dean talked you about in one of his long stories.</p><p>Dean was screaming, the little girl now laying dead, soulless under the big tree, surrounded by other people, the demons now disappearing into thin air with a look of pure satisfaction. You could feel Dean\u2019s deep pain when he knelt over the girl\u2019s body.</p><p>He was heartbroken; his hand reached out to touch the little girl\u2019s body and all you felt was pure innocence. The words that Dean used to keep describing you as. A killer by instinct but a pure innocent heart. The same as lions. They only kill because they need to feed. They are not evil.</p><p>And with that last thought, Dean woke up. Nothing evil into his eyes, no anger regardless of your actions- the one thing you saw was wonder. Before he could speak, you answered to his question.</p><p>\u201cI only wanted to know what you did with that lady in your chambers. That night you came back from your trip in Europe, you came back with a lady and you did something. You seemed so excited and happy. And that lady too. I want to make you feel the same\u201d you said in a trembling voice, your eyes never leaving his.\u00a0\u201cPlease. You promised no secrets.\u201d</p><p>With one quick move you found yourself under him, one hand on the headboard while with the other he caressed your cheek with his fingertips. He had touched you so many times but it never felt like that. His touch was light like feather but it felt so warm, you felt so small under his touch.\u00a0</p><p>Once again you felt feverish, hungry, empty.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you want, love\u201d His voice covered in lace, eyes burning on my skin</p><p>\u201cI do not want to feel empty anymore. I need you to make me feel complete.\u201d you almost purred in soft voice</p><p>Dean leaned down with eyes half closed, his soft lips touching yours in an attempt to kiss you but you were shivering under him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cRelax, love.\u201d he whispered to you.</p><p>And that you did.</p><p>He started kissing you again, every kiss having you melt into his hands, every touch reaching closer to the emptiness you felt.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMy soul will always belong with you. You are my love. But if they find out about you, it will all be gone. Let me have you for tonight and I will let you go tomorrow..\u201d</p><p>Dean undressed you so carefully with his eyes piercing every part of you that was naked before him, fingers exploring all of you, both of you naked on his bed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLook at me. Look into my eyes\u201d he asked you</p><p>With no warning you felt him inside you but you had no regrets, this is what you asked for even if it hurt for a little while.\u00a0</p><p>And for the first time you felt so loved, so complete, so alive. And while he kept touching you, you were more and more sure he loved you. So much, so deep.</p><p>And that was the first time you heard him saying something you never heard him saying before.</p><p>\u201cEver thine, ever mine, ever ours\u201d\u00a0</p></p>",

I still feel empty&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>You were in the verge of crying, you still somehow felt empty even though you have consumed much more blood than ever before. The cold floor under you knees felt comfortingly soothing for the feverishness on your hot skin.</p><p>Dean&rsquo;s eyes scanned you, he was too wondering how after all those months you could not still learn how to control your thirst. Deep down inside he knew you could face problems because you were his first creation, a newborn siren in need of blood.</p><p>No matter how unknown the problems could be, there was no chance you needed more blood. You had consumed a whole town those couple of months. How much more lustful could you be than that?</p><p>That thought was that made Dean&rsquo;s lips turn into a smirk. He knelt down to your level to look directly into your eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Where do you feel empty, love?&rdquo;</p><p>Without hesitation you showed him right between your legs, Dean about to laugh but when he noticed your watery eyes he understood you were not joking. He forgot you two were hundreds of years apart, the slight chance of you knowing anything about anything perverted. And he was happy you were innocent in that part, a part of him that could never change would find salvation within you, inside the untouched part of your pure mind.</p><p>Dean dried away your tears, his thumb ever carefully swiping the teary corners of yours eyes, his soft, warm palm cupping your cheek and like a lost, lonely child you leaned on his hand and looked into the dark pool of his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;It will be gone in a few minutes. Do you want me to teach you how to ignore it and make it go away, love?&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded and listened as if your life depended on it. Dean asked to always take deep breaths and think about the deep blue sky. It never helped in the beginning, made you think you were not doing it properly and it could end up killing you. As the time went by you got used to the feeling, ignoring it for most of the time until you learned to live with it.</p><p>Decades went by, you and Dean learned so much about each other, he taught you how to lure even the strongest minded people, how to trick them, how to make them bend to your will, how to lure them into their death, ways to get into their minds and thoughts even when they built walls to protect things from you. You learned how to infiltrate into anyone&rsquo;s mind, Dean so proud that he trusted you with his life.</p><p>-</p><p>Dean had been away for a very long time and you awaited for him, desperate to have him back and learn about these other countries in Europe. You wore one of your prettiest dresses and sat down to the living room but the time went so slow that you eventually fell asleep.</p><p>A sudden noise woke you up, a voice in far distance alarmed you that somebody was inside the house; the only problem was that that somebody was not Dean. It was a woman&rsquo;s voice. When you were ready to storm inside Dean&rsquo;s chamber, you heard his voice whispering something and the woman moaning slightly.</p><p>Your first thought was that Dean must have brought home a gift for you, a woman to toy with. Your assumptions were wrong when you peaked through the half closed door.</p><p>The confusing image of Dean hovering over the woman, the woman looking wrecked but not in a bad way and him looking so different from any other time you had seen him. You could see him whispering to her, now Dean sitting on the edge of the bed and the woman on his lap, moving on top of him so furiously.&nbsp;</p><p>In a weird way, you felt so enchanted, the emptiness you had been feeling for so long was about to burst. The longer you looked at his face, the more you wanted to be that woman. His face was what people would call love. Everything you dreamed of.</p><p>The noises the woman was making, low, soft moans, whimpers, how her body was so close to his, how it would feel to have Dean move under you. You could not see his face clearly now because of the darkness in the room but his low grunts sounded heavenly.</p><p>For a moment you thought of staying a little bit more there, to see what else would happen but your knees became weak and something felt strange. You quickly ran back to the living room, hopeful you were not caught by Dean. After a few minutes you fell asleep again on the sofa, the fireplace keeping you warm from the cold, the memory of Dean&rsquo;s face haunting your dreams.</p><p>-</p><p>The next couple of weeks went by but still your curious self would not let go of what was the thing that Dean was doing with that woman. You felt rebellious, your talents may come handy at last, a decision of sneaking into Dean&rsquo;s chambers after you poured up too much alcohol into his daily drink.</p><p>You carefully sat on top of him, your hands on each side of his head, eyes closed as you started wondering inside of his mind. The images you saw creeping inside his mind was not what you expected or wanted to see.&nbsp;</p><p>You tried focusing on the moments you saw the girl on top of him, the feeling of that lustful sensation, how erotic and divine it felt. When you were about to focus all of your senses to that scene, the big tree came back right before your eyes and a small girl, only a few years younger than you, was about to get bitten by someone who looked like the demons Dean talked you about in one of his long stories.</p><p>Dean was screaming, the little girl now laying dead, soulless under the big tree, surrounded by other people, the demons now disappearing into thin air with a look of pure satisfaction. You could feel Dean&rsquo;s deep pain when he knelt over the girl&rsquo;s body.</p><p>He was heartbroken; his hand reached out to touch the little girl&rsquo;s body and all you felt was pure innocence. The words that Dean used to keep describing you as. A killer by instinct but a pure innocent heart. The same as lions. They only kill because they need to feed. They are not evil.</p><p>And with that last thought, Dean woke up. Nothing evil into his eyes, no anger regardless of your actions- the one thing you saw was wonder. Before he could speak, you answered to his question.</p><p>&ldquo;I only wanted to know what you did with that lady in your chambers. That night you came back from your trip in Europe, you came back with a lady and you did something. You seemed so excited and happy. And that lady too. I want to make you feel the same&rdquo; you said in a trembling voice, your eyes never leaving his.&nbsp;&ldquo;Please. You promised no secrets.&rdquo;</p><p>With one quick move you found yourself under him, one hand on the headboard while with the other he caressed your cheek with his fingertips. He had touched you so many times but it never felt like that. His touch was light like feather but it felt so warm, you felt so small under his touch.&nbsp;</p><p>Once again you felt feverish, hungry, empty.</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me what you want, love&rdquo; His voice covered in lace, eyes burning on my skin</p><p>&ldquo;I do not want to feel empty anymore. I need you to make me feel complete.&rdquo; you almost purred in soft voice</p><p>Dean leaned down with eyes half closed, his soft lips touching yours in an attempt to kiss you but you were shivering under him.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Relax, love.&rdquo; he whispered to you.</p><p>And that you did.</p><p>He started kissing you again, every kiss having you melt into his hands, every touch reaching closer to the emptiness you felt.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;My soul will always belong with you. You are my love. But if they find out about you, it will all be gone. Let me have you for tonight and I will let you go tomorrow..&rdquo;</p><p>Dean undressed you so carefully with his eyes piercing every part of you that was naked before him, fingers exploring all of you, both of you naked on his bed.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Look at me. Look into my eyes&rdquo; he asked you</p><p>With no warning you felt him inside you but you had no regrets, this is what you asked for even if it hurt for a little while.&nbsp;</p><p>And for the first time you felt so loved, so complete, so alive. And while he kept touching you, you were more and more sure he loved you. So much, so deep.</p><p>And that was the first time you heard him saying something you never heard him saying before.</p><p>&ldquo;Ever thine, ever mine, ever ours&rdquo;&nbsp;</p></p>",

Your husband cried for weeks, only pulling himself up to care for your daughter. It was a very dark time, and he\u2019s still not totally sure that he\u2019s out of that place, but he pretends to be. It\u2019s just hard though, at times. Your daughter - she\u2019s 6, now!

Wash your hands and come down, please!\u201d He tells her as he plates up the food. There was a time where he loved to cook. He used to cook for you every Friday without fail, from the week you met until the day you died. No matter how busy he was, he always made it home on a Friday to see you. Even when he was on tour, he made it happen. You joked that he was magical. What would you say now? He just served up dinosaur-shaped chicken nuggets and beans. Maybe Jin will come round and make those \u2018care packs\u2019. He\u2019s helped Hoseok out a lot since your death,</p><p>\u201cAppa,\u201d His daughter sighs, looking up at him with her hands on her hips, \u201cYou know that for dinner I like to have my Disney Princess spoon. The animal spoon is for breakfast only,\u201d She tells him, fixing him with the sternest gaze she can. In that moment, she looks more like you than ever. Hoseok\u2019s breath catches in his throat as he looks on, eyes glazing over with tears as he tries to hold himself together. It\u2019s not working, \u201cAppa! Don\u2019t cry!\u201d The little girl suddenly exclaims, stepping on Hoseok\u2019s feet and staring up at him with a saddened expression, \u201cI\u2019m not mad, I promise. I can get my spoon, it\u2019s okay,\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, baby, it\u2019s okay,\u201d Hoseok sighs, kneeling down in front of his daughter, who\u2019s panicking just a little bit. She got Hoseok\u2019s hatred of arguments, \u201cI was just thinking about eomma. You look so much like her. So beautiful, and so wonderful. You\u2019re always going to be my princess, no matter how old you get. You\u2019re always going to be eomma\u2019s princess, too, even if she\u2019s not here anymore,\u201d He chokes out, gathering his little girl up into a bear hug. Her little arms wrap around his neck in turn, squeezing him tight. She only likes to see happiness.</p><p><b>Jimin</b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"389\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"babejm:qZ8_dCX_32DQ3osVLGW2zg:ZdaI7d2TUGqoR\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/79506f7b0044ee0650ac5c09023f9a44/tumblr_p1qkk6iBaB1wxb36qo1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"389\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure><p>Jimin was very fragile after you passed away. Taehyung actually moved in with him for a few months, just to see him through the worst of it. Jimin knows that he\u2019s very lucky to have such good friends that care for him and his daughter so well. He really couldn\u2019t have gotten through the whole ordeal without them, and now he can\u2019t thank them enough. Of course, after spending so much time together, his daughter grew very close with the rest of his group. Surprisingly enough, it seems that Namjoon is her favourite! This shocked everyone, since he isn\u2019t much of a master at childcare. But it happened, and that hurt Jimin a little. You were best friends with Namjoon, too,</p><p>\u201cAppa, I\u2019d like to go and see Uncle Joonie today,\u201d She tells Jimin early one Sunday morning, sitting on his legs with a smile on her face. She dressed herself (Jimin can tell this because everything is very mismatched, but she still looks cute) and Jimin can just about see a small backpack in the corner of the room. She\u2019s a bright girl, and she\u2019s ready for the day, \u201cIf you don\u2019t take me, I\u2019ll just go myself,\u201d She huffs when Jimin remains silent. With those few words, Jimin is thrown backwards about 4 years, to the day you\u2019d died. It was raining. You wanted to go and catch up with Namjoon, but you weren\u2019t a confident driver. Definitely not in the rain. Jimin had refused to take you. You\u2019d driven yourself. You\u2019d died in a car accident,</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Jimin whispers, tapping his daughter\u2019s legs so that she gets up. She shrieks in happiness as she hurries off to the bathroom to clean her teeth and face. Jimin\u2019s glad she\u2019s gone. Every time he thinks of that night, he breaks down. He blames himself so deeply, and he hates himself for it. Why couldn\u2019t he have just driven you?</p><p><b>Taehyung</b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"574\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"syuga:sdn2Q7xFAFOaaz4f-1b2BA:ZAP5ah2XjsuHV\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/60c6b3a22868418bd7e6a9d17c0131a3/tumblr_p8bgd9Cp3B1vp7ks6o1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"574\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure><p>Yoongi is getting married next weekend - it\u2019s about time, in Taehyung\u2019s opinion! Him and his girlfriend have been dancing around the marriage topic for too long, and now they\u2019re finally doing it. Taehyung wasn\u2019t allowed to help plan it (well, not after he suggested covering everything with glitter for aesthetic purposes) but his daughter will be the flower girl. He\u2019s allowed to buy her dress for her, but Yoongi\u2019s fianc\u00e9e asked that it be white, in keeping with the theme of the wedding. White and gold. It\u2019s going to be beautiful,</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like this. It\u2019s all itchy. I don\u2019t want to be a flower girl anymore,\u201d His daughter cries out from the changing room in frustration. Taehyung smiles sadly as he remembers what you said to him at the altar on your wedding day. He\u2019d told you how amazing you looked. You\u2019d said your dress was uncomfortable and that you couldn\u2019t wait to take it off, \u201cAppa, help,\u201d She complains again, stumbling out to find Taehyung. She thought she could do it all by herself, but she definitely needs her appa\u2019s help now. When Taehyung sees her, he chokes on his own tears,</p><p>\u201cCome here, precious baby. Appa will help you,\u201d He says, kneeling down as he bites his lip, trying his very best not to let her see his tears. She\u2019s very perceptive, like him. The thing is, she looks like you anyway. She\u2019s got your nose, your lips, your eyes and his smile. It\u2019s a miraculous feat to look so cute, but she does it every day. The only problem is how much she reminds Taehyung of you. Especially now, wearing almost an exact replica of your wedding dress. She looks so sweet in it, and Taehyung knows this is the right dress. It might just take a while to get over how similar the two of you look, even when she\u2019s so young. Taehyung won\u2019t make it through his daughter\u2019s wedding without breaking down, but that\u2019s not for a long while yet. No boys until she\u2019s 30. That\u2019s the rule.</p><p><a href=\"https://taehyungiejiminie95.tumblr.com/post/164938184180/the-masterlist\">Masterlist</a></p>",

Especially now, wearing almost an exact replica of your wedding dress. She looks so sweet in it, and Taehyung knows this is the right dress. It might just take a while to get over how similar the two of you look, even when she\u2019s so young. Taehyung won\u2019t make it through his daughter\u2019s wedding without breaking down, but that\u2019s not for a long while yet. No boys until she\u2019s 30.

Your husband cried for weeks, only pulling himself up to care for your daughter. It was a very dark time, and he\u2019s still not totally sure that he\u2019s out of that place, but he pretends to be. It\u2019s just hard though, at times. Your daughter - she\u2019s 6, now! You wouldn\u2019t believe how much she\u2019s grown from the toddler you last saw her as - is the spitting image of you, and sometimes it stabs your husband right where it hurts.</p><p><b>Hoseok</b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"324\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"aesthetic-kpop-memes:ZJwbB8we0kUuARFazVgHPg:Z1Ffie2RMFejW\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f75c1ea0c728d6d6869deae589f3b9b2/tumblr_oyewxh2Uow1w4hz4oo1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"324\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><p>\u201cPrincess!\u201d Hoseok calls up the stairs, \u201cTime for dinner! Wash your hands and come down, please!\u201d He tells her as he plates up the food. There was a time where he loved to cook. He used to cook for you every Friday without fail, from the week you met until the day you died. No matter how busy he was, he always made it home on a Friday to see you. Even when he was on tour, he made it happen. You joked that he was magical. What would you say now? He just served up dinosaur-shaped chicken nuggets and beans. Maybe Jin will come round and make those \u2018care packs\u2019. He\u2019s helped Hoseok out a lot since your death,</p><p>\u201cAppa,\u201d His daughter sighs, looking up at him with her hands on her hips, \u201cYou know that for dinner I like to have my Disney Princess spoon. The animal spoon is for breakfast only,\u201d She tells him, fixing him with the sternest gaze she can. In that moment, she looks more like you than ever. Hoseok\u2019s breath catches in his throat as he looks on, eyes glazing over with tears as he tries to hold himself together. It\u2019s not working, \u201cAppa! Don\u2019t cry!\u201d The little girl suddenly exclaims, stepping on Hoseok\u2019s feet and staring up at him with a saddened expression, \u201cI\u2019m not mad, I promise. I can get my spoon, it\u2019s okay,\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, baby, it\u2019s okay,\u201d Hoseok sighs, kneeling down in front of his daughter, who\u2019s panicking just a little bit. She got Hoseok\u2019s hatred of arguments, \u201cI was just thinking about eomma. You look so much like her. So beautiful, and so wonderful. You\u2019re always going to be my princess, no matter how old you get. You\u2019re always going to be eomma\u2019s princess, too, even if she\u2019s not here anymore,\u201d He chokes out, gathering his little girl up into a bear hug. Her little arms wrap around his neck in turn, squeezing him tight. She only likes to see happiness.</p><p><b>Jimin</b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"389\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"babejm:qZ8_dCX_32DQ3osVLGW2zg:ZdaI7d2TUGqoR\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/79506f7b0044ee0650ac5c09023f9a44/tumblr_p1qkk6iBaB1wxb36qo1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"389\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><p>Jimin was very fragile after you passed away.

He really couldn\u2019t have gotten through the whole ordeal without them, and now he can\u2019t thank them enough. Of course, after spending so much time together, his daughter grew very close with the rest of his group. Surprisingly enough, it seems that Namjoon is her favourite! This shocked everyone, since he isn\u2019t much of a master at childcare. But it happened, and that hurt Jimin a little. You were best friends with Namjoon, too,</p><p>\u201cAppa, I\u2019d like to go and see Uncle Joonie today,\u201d She tells Jimin early one Sunday morning, sitting on his legs with a smile on her face. She dressed herself (Jimin can tell this because everything is very mismatched, but she still looks cute) and Jimin can just about see a small backpack in the corner of the room. She\u2019s a bright girl, and she\u2019s ready for the day, \u201cIf you don\u2019t take me, I\u2019ll just go myself,\u201d She huffs when Jimin remains silent. With those few words, Jimin is thrown backwards about 4 years, to the day you\u2019d died. It was raining. You wanted to go and catch up with Namjoon, but you weren\u2019t a confident driver. Definitely not in the rain. Jimin had refused to take you. You\u2019d driven yourself.
