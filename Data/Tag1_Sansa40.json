You hadn\u2019t met her in the lineup when your sister and Jon came riding in, but she had seen you from the battlements. Watching in awe to see three magnificent dragons flying in Westeros. She heard tales about them and they hadn\u2019t seen them for forever.</p><p>She could see you grinning as the air hits you, you could fly for forever, you felt free. She saw you riding the white and gold one, and even a mere second she could hear the wild scream of a man who truly enjoyed life.\u00a0</p><!-- more --><p>Then a bitter thought came to her mind, you were happy, a happy man and she was not. She did not know what to expect when she saw you stride into her home, you had Daenerys by your side, and you had taken her breath away. Sansa tries to ignore how the icy breath appeared upon your appearance.</p><p>She could believe that Rheagar was the most looked upon man of Westeros when he was alive, Daenerys\u2019 beauty was unspeakable but you were, in all of your glory, positively something else. Breathtaking, glorifying, majestic. You and your silver crown, braided flawlessly, and your penetrating purple eyes.</p><p>You were a foreigner to the North, to Westeros. Born a few minutes later after your twin sister and shipped off on a boat to Esso, you had never got to know what home was to you. But, the Winter was beautiful and it was the first time you\u2019ve seen snow. Winterfell was something you weren\u2019t used to.\u00a0</p><p>The people of the North were cold and abrasive but you figured that they move with the season. But, what had grasped your attention was the wild red hair, her hair was a fire within the coldest parts of the realm. You slowly blink as you take in her beauty, no man nor woman of Essos has captured you in a way like she has.\u00a0</p><p>She had a mind like fire.</p><p>You could tell, the way she had ignored the pressing looks of the Unsullied and the Dothraki. You could tell her mind was raged with the blazing heat in the way she had stared, full of concern, it draws you closer than ever before.</p><p>\u201cSansa Stark, Lady of Winterfell,\u201d Daenerys spoke, noticing your stare,\u00a0\u201cJon\u2019s sister, she is beautiful, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly,\u201d You breathed out,\u00a0\u201cDo you think striking a conversation is too much? Too cutting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think too much into this, dearest valonqar,\u201d Daenerys had wrapped her arms around your right arm, leaning her head against your shoulder,\u00a0\u201cYou are sweet, just and magnanimous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose won\u2019t mean anything to her, mandia,\u201d You hummed, sighing,\u00a0\u201cIf only I had Vis\u2019 narcissism.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already ride his namesake dragon, god forbid you\u2019d be anything like him,\u201d Dany scowls at you as you lowly chuckles, gazing upon her,\u00a0\u201cOur brother is not a joking matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive me in my bad taste of humour, Dany,\u201d You say, as you look at her,\u00a0\u201cBut, I am not a suitor for her.\u201d</p><p>But, you were.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-width=\"2210\" data-orig-height=\"143\"><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7103edb8f4de200f5db9303cec4e6d12/tumblr_inline_prpxllk8JQ1sngn50_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"2210\" data-orig-height=\"143\"/></figure><p>You had run into her when you were looking for your sister, you had literally crashed into her. As you were standing up, you were red with embarrassment as you offer your hand to her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m terribly sorry,\u201d You apologised as you gently pulled her up, not noticing her face slowly matching her hair,\u00a0\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t know where my sister could be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t, sorry,\u201d Sansa couldn\u2019t help but feel hot under your attention.</p><p>She noticed when you stare at her they were gentle, not glaring and no lust within your stare, a stare she was belittled to get used to by Joffery and Ramsey. And yet, a lord of the most feared house stares at her as if she was a baby.</p><p>She wants to believe those terrible rumours, you were horrible. You would kill and rape any who stands in your way to the Iron Throne, the rumours that you were just as mad as the rest of your family. The rumours that say you were even worst than Joffery and Ramsey combined.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Lady Sansa Stark of Winterfell,\u201d You commented, an inviting smile had captivated her.</p><p>Sansa tries to keep a stoic look however that stupid boyish smile had got her huffing an amused smile,\u00a0\u201cYes, I am, and you\u2019re Lord (Y/n) Targaryen of Dragonstone.\u201d</p><p>You shrugged,\u00a0\u201cNot officially yet, my sister hasn\u2019t got the Iron Throne, nor yet a Lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sansa falls for your purple eyes, you frowned when she turns away,\u00a0\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-width=\"2210\" data-orig-height=\"143\"><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7103edb8f4de200f5db9303cec4e6d12/tumblr_inline_prpybe6U7l1sngn50_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"2210\" data-orig-height=\"143\"/></figure><p>She watches how you charged into the Battle with Viserion, you looked as magnificent as your sister would claim. Before she had gone to the crypts she had witnessed you slide of Viserion and whip out your sword, shouting in Valyerian to the Unsullied.\u00a0</p><p>When the dawn began, coming out of the crypts she was mortified to see the pile of the dead. However, she had noticed you stroking Viserion and Rhaegal. You were trying to calm them down, especially Rhaegal, who was injured in the battle.</p><p>Your silver crown ruined, stained with blood and dirt.\u00a0</p><p>Your ice hair matted compared to her flawless fire hair.</p><p>You managed to look over your shoulder and meet her eyes. You sighed, but there was still a sparkle in your eyes. You smile at her and she returns it back. She watches in amusement when she sees Viserion nudged his head into you, causing you to stumble back and fall into your back. She laughs even more when she witnessed the two dragons huff smoke out of their nose - almost as if they were laughing at you.</p><p>Throughout the day she and you had been exchanging looks across the way that even the most oblivious, Jon Snow, had noticed. He and Dany were standing in the middle of Winterfell discussing important matters.</p><p>\u201cWe could rule together,\u201d Daenerys hums, stroking his hair,\u00a0\u201cKing and Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys knitted her eyebrows together as she noticed her love not responding, following his eyes she had noticed that he was staring at her brother, who was tending to the injuries of your Unsullied men but soon got distracted with a smitten smile as you stare at Sansa.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been like this for a few days,\u201d Daenerys mentions as Jon hardens his eyes.</p><p>Watching you leave your men but not taking your eyes off Sansa, running into a wooden pole before Sansa burst out into laughter - though if no one had witnessed what had happened they would think that Sansa was going mad.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot.\u201d Sansa had mouthed to you when you grin up at her.</p><p>She grabs a handful of the snow from the railing and threw it towards you, hitting you in the face. You let out a chuckle before hoping to get her with snow.</p><p>\u201cThey work well together,\u201d Dany commented,\u00a0\u201cSansa has even warmed up with me, I think it\u2019s in hopes to grab (Y/n) attention, it is certainly working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey make a handsome couple.\u201d</p><p>So, when the two were caught out upstairs before a meeting in order to take over the Iron Throne. You had stumbled in and Sansa quickly followed, in hopes to catch you and speak. To get to know you more.</p><p>\u201cSansa, (Y/n) just the two we\u2019ve meaning to talk to,\u201d Jon announced, as you shifted uncomfortably as Sansa stands up straight.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cJon wants to talk to you, I have no idea what he\u2019s thinking,\u201d Dany amends as you and she looked at each other.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting married?\u201d You suggested as you smile encouragingly.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jon shakes his head, as Dany\u2019s smile dropped,\u00a0\u201cMarriage is involved but not ours.\u201d</p><p>The message sinks in and Sansa\u2019s eyes widen. She will not be given away like a rag doll. She\u2019s been in unhappy marriages before, god forbid if she\u2019s tied to another, but she had witnessed how you looked down to your feet, you became small. Not the man she had been overly fond of. What she observes is a man who is tied to his feelings, a man who would not disagree unless someone does.</p><p>\u201cCersei\u2019s two biggest enemies are our two houses. Having us two reconcile together means a bigger threat to her and The North will support Dany.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you two marry?\u201d You asked whilst Sansa was taken back to the resentment in your voice,\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re of blood Stark, Snow.\u201d</p><p>It was the first time Jon had you call him by his bastard name, but Dany had known you. You were twins, after all, she had listened to you wanting a quiet life back at home. You want to be loved and have a family you found on your own. A forced marriage is nothing in your plans of love.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a Stark,\u201d Jon responded as you looked at him, watching him turn to look at Dany who hesitantly nods,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m the son of Rhaegar and Lyanna Targaryen, they had secretly married each other and had a child. I was never a bastard, I am Aegon Targaryen.\u201d</p><p>Your eyes widen at the news, in front of you was your nephew, in front of you was your sister\u2019s lover - who loved her as much as she did. You blinked a few times before leaning against the table and sitting down to process the information, staring at your fingers as Sansa blinks.\u00a0</p><p>Sansa understood that Jon had a better claim to the Iron Throne.</p><p>\u201cNorthern men support you, Jon,\u201d You explains softly, almost defeat within your tone,\u00a0\u201cAnd you\u2019re still a Stark, by Lyanna\u2019s blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll see more dragon than a wolf, a better unifying would be between you and Sansa, this-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sansa draws her eyes towards you, noticing how your hand was clenched into a fist, you narrow your eyes and abruptly standing up,\u00a0\u201cI won\u2019t marry Sansa unless she agrees. If not, find yourself another to bring the houses together because I will not live in a loveless forced marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be loveless,\u201d Dany drawls out,\u00a0\u201cIf anything, valonqar, you stare at Sansa almost the same way I stare at Jon.\u201d</p><p>You looked over to Sansa, her vibrant fire hair burns out your snow-like hair. Together by house personality, by house location. You were of fire, you were a force to be reckoned with, you knew only heat. You knew how to be harsh and terrifying. You had the nature of a dragon.</p><p>But, Sansa was of ice. Cold and calculating much like a wolf hunting for their prey. Sansa takes harsh temperatures to harden, takes harsh reality by its neck to control what goes with her. But, like ice, it can be so easy to break and get in. Fire melts Ice, you had melted your way to her heart.</p><p>Anyone with half a brain could tell that there was something between you two.</p><p>However, she was fire. She will not be burnt again by men, she will not be burnt by women again. She will be the one to make people tremble her wrath. She was of fire, as her hair marked vibrant as the orange hue flames. You were ice, smart and calculating, god forbid if you were to put in battle as you will never back down until a victory was brought on a spike. And let the gods punish those who think they can trick your smart mind. You were of ice, how your hair was silver like and matched the wintery scene, inviting and friendly.</p><p>\u201cI accept,\u201d Sansa whispers as you looked at her with shock,\u00a0\u201cI want to settle down, if it were to be with (Y/n), then I wouldn\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>Your harden stare softens immensely as one side of your lip curved upwards.</p><p>\u201cOkay&hellip;\u201d You murmured, your shoulders relaxing,\u00a0\u201cI hope you learn to love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not much to learn when I\u2019m already in love.\u201d</p><p>They say ice and fire were terrible together, but maybe, just maybe, it wasn\u2019t too bad.</p>",

She did not know what to expect when she saw you stride into her home, you had Daenerys by your side, and you had taken her breath away. Sansa tries to ignore how the icy breath appeared upon your appearance.</p><p>She could believe that Rheagar was the most looked upon man of Westeros when he was alive, Daenerys\u2019 beauty was unspeakable but you were, in all of your glory, positively something else. Breathtaking, glorifying, majestic. You and your silver crown, braided flawlessly, and your penetrating purple eyes.</p><p>You were a foreigner to the North, to Westeros. Born a few minutes later after your twin sister and shipped off on a boat to Esso, you had never got to know what home was to you. But, the Winter was beautiful and it was the first time you\u2019ve seen snow. Winterfell was something you weren\u2019t used to.\u00a0</p><p>The people of the North were cold and abrasive but you figured that they move with the season. But, what had grasped your attention was the wild red hair, her hair was a fire within the coldest parts of the realm. You slowly blink as you take in her beauty, no man nor woman of Essos has captured you in a way like she has.\u00a0</p><p>She had a mind like fire.</p><p>You could tell, the way she had ignored the pressing looks of the Unsullied and the Dothraki. You could tell her mind was raged with the blazing heat in the way she had stared, full of concern, it draws you closer than ever before.</p><p>\u201cSansa Stark, Lady of Winterfell,\u201d Daenerys spoke, noticing your stare,\u00a0\u201cJon\u2019s sister, she is beautiful, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly,\u201d You breathed out,\u00a0\u201cDo you think striking a conversation is too much? Too cutting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think too much into this, dearest valonqar,\u201d Daenerys had wrapped her arms around your right arm, leaning her head against your shoulder,\u00a0\u201cYou are sweet, just and magnanimous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose won\u2019t mean anything to her, mandia,\u201d You hummed, sighing,\u00a0\u201cIf only I had Vis\u2019 narcissism.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already ride his namesake dragon, god forbid you\u2019d be anything like him,\u201d Dany scowls at you as you lowly chuckles, gazing upon her,\u00a0\u201cOur brother is not a joking matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive me in my bad taste of humour, Dany,\u201d You say, as you look at her,\u00a0\u201cBut, I am not a suitor for her.\u201d</p><p>But, you were.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-width=\"2210\" data-orig-height=\"143\"><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7103edb8f4de200f5db9303cec4e6d12/tumblr_inline_prpxllk8JQ1sngn50_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"2210\" data-orig-height=\"143\"></figure><p>You had run into her when you were looking for your sister, you had literally crashed into her. As you were standing up, you were red with embarrassment as you offer your hand to her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m terribly sorry,\u201d You apologised as you gently pulled her up, not noticing her face slowly matching her hair,\u00a0\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t know where my sister could be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t, sorry,\u201d Sansa couldn\u2019t help but feel hot under your attention.</p><p>She noticed when you stare at her they were gentle, not glaring and no lust within your stare, a stare she was belittled to get used to by Joffery and Ramsey. And yet, a lord of the most feared house stares at her as if she was a baby.</p><p>She wants to believe those terrible rumours, you were horrible. You would kill and rape any who stands in your way to the Iron Throne, the rumours that you were just as mad as the rest of your family. The rumours that say you were even worst than Joffery and Ramsey combined.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Lady Sansa Stark of Winterfell,\u201d You commented, an inviting smile had captivated her.</p><p>Sansa tries to keep a stoic look however that stupid boyish smile had got her huffing an amused smile,\u00a0\u201cYes, I am, and you\u2019re Lord (Y/n) Targaryen of Dragonstone.\u201d</p><p>You shrugged,\u00a0\u201cNot officially yet, my sister hasn\u2019t got the Iron Throne, nor yet a Lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sansa falls for your purple eyes, you frowned when she turns away,\u00a0\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-width=\"2210\" data-orig-height=\"143\"><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7103edb8f4de200f5db9303cec4e6d12/tumblr_inline_prpybe6U7l1sngn50_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"2210\" data-orig-height=\"143\"></figure><p>She watches how you charged into the Battle with Viserion, you looked as magnificent as your sister would claim. Before she had gone to the crypts she had witnessed you slide of Viserion and whip out your sword, shouting in Valyerian to the Unsullied.\u00a0</p><p>When the dawn began, coming out of the crypts she was mortified to see the pile of the dead. However, she had noticed you stroking Viserion and Rhaegal. You were trying to calm them down, especially Rhaegal, who was injured in the battle.</p><p>Your silver crown ruined, stained with blood and dirt.\u00a0</p><p>Your ice hair matted compared to her flawless fire hair.</p><p>You managed to look over your shoulder and meet her eyes. You sighed, but there was still a sparkle in your eyes. You smile at her and she returns it back. She watches in amusement when she sees Viserion nudged his head into you, causing you to stumble back and fall into your back. She laughs even more when she witnessed the two dragons huff smoke out of their nose - almost as if they were laughing at you.</p><p>Throughout the day she and you had been exchanging looks across the way that even the most oblivious, Jon Snow, had noticed. He and Dany were standing in the middle of Winterfell discussing important matters.</p><p>\u201cWe could rule together,\u201d Daenerys hums, stroking his hair,\u00a0\u201cKing and Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys knitted her eyebrows together as she noticed her love not responding, following his eyes she had noticed that he was staring at her brother, who was tending to the injuries of your Unsullied men but soon got distracted with a smitten smile as you stare at Sansa.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been like this for a few days,\u201d Daenerys mentions as Jon hardens his eyes.</p><p>Watching you leave your men but not taking your eyes off Sansa, running into a wooden pole before Sansa burst out into laughter - though if no one had witnessed what had happened they would think that Sansa was going mad.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot.\u201d Sansa had mouthed to you when you grin up at her.</p><p>She grabs a handful of the snow from the railing and threw it towards you, hitting you in the face. You let out a chuckle before hoping to get her with snow.</p><p>\u201cThey work well together,\u201d Dany commented,\u00a0\u201cSansa has even warmed up with me, I think it\u2019s in hopes to grab (Y/n) attention, it is certainly working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey make a handsome couple.\u201d</p><p>So, when the two were caught out upstairs before a meeting in order to take over the Iron Throne. You had stumbled in and Sansa quickly followed, in hopes to catch you and speak. To get to know you more.</p><p>\u201cSansa, (Y/n) just the two we\u2019ve meaning to talk to,\u201d Jon announced, as you shifted uncomfortably as Sansa stands up straight.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cJon wants to talk to you, I have no idea what he\u2019s thinking,\u201d Dany amends as you and she looked at each other.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting married?\u201d You suggested as you smile encouragingly.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jon shakes his head, as Dany\u2019s smile dropped,\u00a0\u201cMarriage is involved but not ours.\u201d</p><p>The message sinks in and Sansa\u2019s eyes widen. She will not be given away like a rag doll. She\u2019s been in unhappy marriages before, god forbid if she\u2019s tied to another, but she had witnessed how you looked down to your feet, you became small. Not the man she had been overly fond of. What she observes is a man who is tied to his feelings, a man who would not disagree unless someone does.</p><p>\u201cCersei\u2019s two biggest enemies are our two houses. Having us two reconcile together means a bigger threat to her and The North will support Dany.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you two marry?\u201d You asked whilst Sansa was taken back to the resentment in your voice,\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re of blood Stark, Snow.\u201d</p><p>It was the first time Jon had you call him by his bastard name, but Dany had known you. You were twins, after all, she had listened to you wanting a quiet life back at home. You want to be loved and have a family you found on your own. A forced marriage is nothing in your plans of love.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a Stark,\u201d Jon responded as you looked at him, watching him turn to look at Dany who hesitantly nods,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m the son of Rhaegar and Lyanna Targaryen, they had secretly married each other and had a child. I was never a bastard, I am Aegon Targaryen.\u201d</p><p>Your eyes widen at the news, in front of you was your nephew, in front of you was your sister\u2019s lover - who loved her as much as she did. You blinked a few times before leaning against the table and sitting down to process the information, staring at your fingers as Sansa blinks.\u00a0</p><p>Sansa understood that Jon had a better claim to the Iron Throne.</p><p>\u201cNorthern men support you, Jon,\u201d You explains softly, almost defeat within your tone,\u00a0\u201cAnd you\u2019re still a Stark, by Lyanna\u2019s blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll see more dragon than a wolf, a better unifying would be between you and Sansa, this-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sansa draws her eyes towards you, noticing how your hand was clenched into a fist, you narrow your eyes and abruptly standing up,\u00a0\u201cI won\u2019t marry Sansa unless she agrees. If not, find yourself another to bring the houses together because I will not live in a loveless forced marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be loveless,\u201d Dany drawls out,\u00a0\u201cIf anything, valonqar, you stare at Sansa almost the same way I stare at Jon.\u201d</p><p>You looked over to Sansa, her vibrant fire hair burns out your snow-like hair. Together by house personality, by house location. You were of fire, you were a force to be reckoned with, you knew only heat. You knew how to be harsh and terrifying. You had the nature of a dragon.</p><p>But, Sansa was of ice. Cold and calculating much like a wolf hunting for their prey. Sansa takes harsh temperatures to harden, takes harsh reality by its neck to control what goes with her. But, like ice, it can be so easy to break and get in. Fire melts Ice, you had melted your way to her heart.</p><p>Anyone with half a brain could tell that there was something between you two.</p><p>However, she was fire. She will not be burnt again by men, she will not be burnt by women again. She will be the one to make people tremble her wrath. She was of fire, as her hair marked vibrant as the orange hue flames. You were ice, smart and calculating, god forbid if you were to put in battle as you will never back down until a victory was brought on a spike. And let the gods punish those who think they can trick your smart mind. You were of ice, how your hair was silver like and matched the wintery scene, inviting and friendly.</p><p>\u201cI accept,\u201d Sansa whispers as you looked at her with shock,\u00a0\u201cI want to settle down, if it were to be with (Y/n), then I wouldn\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>Your harden stare softens immensely as one side of your lip curved upwards.</p><p>\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d You murmured, your shoulders relaxing,\u00a0\u201cI hope you learn to love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not much to learn when I\u2019m already in love.\u201d</p><p>They say ice and fire were terrible together, but maybe, just maybe, it wasn\u2019t too bad.</p>",

The rumours that say you were even worst than Joffery and Ramsey combined.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Lady Sansa Stark of Winterfell,\u201d You commented, an inviting smile had captivated her.</p><p>Sansa tries to keep a stoic look however that stupid boyish smile had got her huffing an amused smile,\u00a0\u201cYes, I am, and you\u2019re Lord (Y/n) Targaryen of Dragonstone.\u201d</p><p>You shrugged,\u00a0\u201cNot officially yet, my sister hasn\u2019t got the Iron Throne, nor yet a Lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sansa falls for your purple eyes, you frowned when she turns away,\u00a0\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-width=\"2210\" data-orig-height=\"143\"><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7103edb8f4de200f5db9303cec4e6d12/tumblr_inline_prpybe6U7l1sngn50_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"2210\" data-orig-height=\"143\"></figure><p>She watches how you charged into the Battle with Viserion, you looked as magnificent as your sister would claim. Before she had gone to the crypts she had witnessed you slide of Viserion and whip out your sword, shouting in Valyerian to the Unsullied.\u00a0</p><p>When the dawn began, coming out of the crypts she was mortified to see the pile of the dead. However, she had noticed you stroking Viserion and Rhaegal. You were trying to calm them down, especially Rhaegal, who was injured in the battle.</p><p>Your silver crown ruined, stained with blood and dirt.\u00a0</p><p>Your ice hair matted compared to her flawless fire hair.</p><p>You managed to look over your shoulder and meet her eyes. You sighed, but there was still a sparkle in your eyes. You smile at her and she returns it back. She watches in amusement when she sees Viserion nudged his head into you, causing you to stumble back and fall into your back. She laughs even more when she witnessed the two dragons huff smoke out of their nose - almost as if they were laughing at you.</p><p>Throughout the day she and you had been exchanging looks across the way that even the most oblivious, Jon Snow, had noticed. He and Dany were standing in the middle of Winterfell discussing important matters.</p><p>\u201cWe could rule together,\u201d Daenerys hums, stroking his hair,\u00a0\u201cKing and Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.\u201d</p><p>Daenerys knitted her eyebrows together as she noticed her love not responding, following his eyes she had noticed that he was staring at her brother, who was tending to the injuries of your Unsullied men but soon got distracted with a smitten smile as you stare at Sansa.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been like this for a few days,\u201d Daenerys mentions as Jon hardens his eyes.</p><p>Watching you leave your men but not taking your eyes off Sansa, running into a wooden pole before Sansa burst out into laughter - though if no one had witnessed what had happened they would think that Sansa was going mad.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot.\u201d Sansa had mouthed to you when you grin up at her.</p><p>She grabs a handful of the snow from the railing and threw it towards you, hitting you in the face. You let out a chuckle before hoping to get her with snow.</p><p>\u201cThey work well together,\u201d Dany commented,\u00a0\u201cSansa has even warmed up with me, I think it\u2019s in hopes to grab (Y/n) attention, it is certainly working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey make a handsome couple.\u201d</p><p>So, when the two were caught out upstairs before a meeting in order to take over the Iron Throne. You had stumbled in and Sansa quickly followed, in hopes to catch you and speak. To get to know you more.</p><p>\u201cSansa, (Y/n) just the two we\u2019ve meaning to talk to,\u201d Jon announced, as you shifted uncomfortably as Sansa stands up straight.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cJon wants to talk to you, I have no idea what he\u2019s thinking,\u201d Dany amends as you and she looked at each other.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting married?\u201d You suggested as you smile encouragingly.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jon shakes his head, as Dany\u2019s smile dropped,\u00a0\u201cMarriage is involved but not ours.\u201d</p><p>The message sinks in and Sansa\u2019s eyes widen. She will not be given away like a rag doll. She\u2019s been in unhappy marriages before, god forbid if she\u2019s tied to another, but she had witnessed how you looked down to your feet, you became small. Not the man she had been overly fond of. What she observes is a man who is tied to his feelings, a man who would not disagree unless someone does.</p><p>\u201cCersei\u2019s two biggest enemies are our two houses. Having us two reconcile together means a bigger threat to her and The North will support Dany.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you two marry?\u201d You asked whilst Sansa was taken back to the resentment in your voice,\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re of blood Stark, Snow.\u201d</p><p>It was the first time Jon had you call him by his bastard name, but Dany had known you. You were twins, after all, she had listened to you wanting a quiet life back at home. You want to be loved and have a family you found on your own. A forced marriage is nothing in your plans of love.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a Stark,\u201d Jon responded as you looked at him, watching him turn to look at Dany who hesitantly nods,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m the son of Rhaegar and Lyanna Targaryen, they had secretly married each other and had a child. I was never a bastard, I am Aegon Targaryen.\u201d</p><p>Your eyes widen at the news, in front of you was your nephew, in front of you was your sister\u2019s lover - who loved her as much as she did. You blinked a few times before leaning against the table and sitting down to process the information, staring at your fingers as Sansa blinks.\u00a0</p><p>Sansa understood that Jon had a better claim to the Iron Throne.</p><p>\u201cNorthern men support you, Jon,\u201d You explains softly, almost defeat within your tone,\u00a0\u201cAnd you\u2019re still a Stark, by Lyanna\u2019s blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll see more dragon than a wolf, a better unifying would be between you and Sansa, this-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sansa draws her eyes towards you, noticing how your hand was clenched into a fist, you narrow your eyes and abruptly standing up,\u00a0\u201cI won\u2019t marry Sansa unless she agrees. If not, find yourself another to bring the houses together because I will not live in a loveless forced marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be loveless,\u201d Dany drawls out,\u00a0\u201cIf anything, valonqar, you stare at Sansa almost the same way I stare at Jon.\u201d</p><p>You looked over to Sansa, her vibrant fire hair burns out your snow-like hair. Together by house personality, by house location. You were of fire, you were a force to be reckoned with, you knew only heat. You knew how to be harsh and terrifying. You had the nature of a dragon.</p><p>But, Sansa was of ice. Cold and calculating much like a wolf hunting for their prey. Sansa takes harsh temperatures to harden, takes harsh reality by its neck to control what goes with her. But, like ice, it can be so easy to break and get in. Fire melts Ice, you had melted your way to her heart.</p><p>Anyone with half a brain could tell that there was something between you two.</p><p>However, she was fire. She will not be burnt again by men, she will not be burnt by women again. She will be the one to make people tremble her wrath. She was of fire, as her hair marked vibrant as the orange hue flames. You were ice, smart and calculating, god forbid if you were to put in battle as you will never back down until a victory was brought on a spike. And let the gods punish those who think they can trick your smart mind. You were of ice, how your hair was silver like and matched the wintery scene, inviting and friendly.</p><p>\u201cI accept,\u201d Sansa whispers as you looked at her with shock,\u00a0\u201cI want to settle down, if it were to be with (Y/n), then I wouldn\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>Your harden stare softens immensely as one side of your lip curved upwards.</p><p>\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d You murmured, your shoulders relaxing,\u00a0\u201cI hope you learn to love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not much to learn when I\u2019m already in love.\u201d</p><p>They say ice and fire were terrible together, but maybe, just maybe, it wasn\u2019t too bad.</p>",

You hadn&rsquo;t met her in the lineup when your sister and Jon came riding in, but she had seen you from the battlements. Watching in awe to see three magnificent dragons flying in Westeros. She heard tales about them and they hadn&rsquo;t seen them for forever.</p><p>She could see you grinning as the air hits you, you could fly for forever, you felt free. She saw you riding the white and gold one, and even a mere second she could hear the wild scream of a man who truly enjoyed life.&nbsp;</p><p>Then a bitter thought came to her mind, you were happy, a happy man and she was not. She did not know what to expect when she saw you stride into her home, you had Daenerys by your side, and you had taken her breath away. Sansa tries to ignore how the icy breath appeared upon your appearance.</p><p>She could believe that Rheagar was the most looked upon man of Westeros when he was alive, Daenerys&rsquo; beauty was unspeakable but you were, in all of your glory, positively something else. Breathtaking, glorifying, majestic. You and your silver crown, braided flawlessly, and your penetrating purple eyes.</p><p>You were a foreigner to the North, to Westeros. Born a few minutes later after your twin sister and shipped off on a boat to Esso, you had never got to know what home was to you. But, the Winter was beautiful and it was the first time you&rsquo;ve seen snow. Winterfell was something you weren&rsquo;t used to.&nbsp;</p><p>The people of the North were cold and abrasive but you figured that they move with the season. But, what had grasped your attention was the wild red hair, her hair was a fire within the coldest parts of the realm. You slowly blink as you take in her beauty, no man nor woman of Essos has captured you in a way like she has.&nbsp;</p><p>She had a mind like fire.</p><p>You could tell, the way she had ignored the pressing looks of the Unsullied and the Dothraki. You could tell her mind was raged with the blazing heat in the way she had stared, full of concern, it draws you closer than ever before.</p><p>&ldquo;Sansa Stark, Lady of Winterfell,&rdquo; Daenerys spoke, noticing your stare,&nbsp;&ldquo;Jon&rsquo;s sister, she is beautiful, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; You breathed out,&nbsp;&ldquo;Do you think striking a conversation is too much? Too cutting?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You think too much into this, dearest valonqar,&rdquo; Daenerys had wrapped her arms around your right arm, leaning her head against your shoulder,&nbsp;&ldquo;You are sweet, just and magnanimous.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Those won&rsquo;t mean anything to her, mandia,&rdquo; You hummed, sighing,&nbsp;&ldquo;If only I had Vis&rsquo; narcissism.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You already ride his namesake dragon, god forbid you&rsquo;d be anything like him,&rdquo; Dany scowls at you as you lowly chuckles, gazing upon her,&nbsp;&ldquo;Our brother is not a joking matter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Forgive me in my bad taste of humour, Dany,&rdquo; You say, as you look at her,&nbsp;&ldquo;But, I am not a suitor for her.&rdquo;</p><p>But, you were.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7103edb8f4de200f5db9303cec4e6d12/tumblr_inline_prpxllk8JQ1sngn50_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>You had run into her when you were looking for your sister, you had literally crashed into her.
