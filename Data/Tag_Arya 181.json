He nodded. They called Hot Pie down\nfrom the wall and found Lommy Greenhands where he lay bleeding from a spear\nthrust through his calf. They found Gerren too, but he was hurt too bad to\nmove. As <b>they were running toward the\nbarn, Arya spied the crying girl sitting in the middle of the chaos, surrounded\nby smoke and slaughter.

Flames were\nlicking up its sides from where a torch had fallen on straw, and she could hear\nthe screaming of the animals trapped within. Hot Pie stepped out of the barn.\n&ldquo;Arry, come on!

In some places wisps of pale\nsmoke still rose from the ashes. Hot Pie had pleaded with them not to go back,\nand Lommy called them fools and swore that Ser Amory would catch them and kill\nthem too, but Lorch and his men had long gone by the time they reached the\nholdfast. They found the gates broken down, the walls partly demolished, and\nthe inside strewn with the unburied dead. One look was enough for Gendry.\n&ldquo;They&rsquo;re killed, every one,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And dogs have been at\nthem too, look.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dogs, wolves, it makes no\nmatter.

I believe this part of her storyline was necessary because it will be in Braavos that Arya will learn how to be a warrior and in the end of the day, Westerosis armies will only follow warriors, so it was very important for Arya to experience this part of her journey.</p><p><br/></p><p>Her journey in the House of Black and White is also a big foreshadowing as her role as a leader in the end.\u00a0First as Cat of the Canals, she is forced to serve (which is a constant theme in George RRMartin story, he always makes sure, his future leaders spend part of their storyline serving, we will find the same theme on Jon, Sansa and Theon storyline.</p><p><br/></p><blockquote><p>\n\n&ldquo;You lie. You are Cat of the canals, I know you well. Go and sleep, child. On the morrow you must serve.&rdquo;&ldquo;<b>All men must serve.</b>&rdquo; And so she did, three days of every thirty. When the moon was black she was no one, a servant of the Many-Faced God in a robe of black and white. She walked beside the kindly man through the fragrant darkness, carrying her iron lantern. <b>She washed the dead, went through their clothes, and counted out their coins. Some days she still helped Umma cook, chopping big white mushrooms and boning fish. But only when the moon was black. </b>The rest of the time she was an orphan girl in a pair of battered boots too big for her feet and a brown cloak with a ragged hem, crying &ldquo;Mussels and cockles and clams&rdquo; as she wheeled her barrow through the Ragman&rsquo;s Harbor.<br/><br/></p><p>A Feast for Crows - Cat Of The Canals</p><p><br/></p></blockquote><p>\u00a0As part of her training, she is being educated in the lessosn of poisons and how to play the game of lies, which its going to be very useful once she returns to Westeros and starts her revenge game.</p><p><br/></p><blockquote><p><b>\n\n\n\nThat was her first lesson. There had been many more.<br/><br/></b></p><p><b>Poisons and potions were for the afternoons.</b> She had smell and touch and taste to help her, but touch and taste could be perilous when grinding poisons, and with some of the waif&rsquo;s more toxic concoctions even smell was less than safe. Burned pinky tips and blistered lips became familiar to her, and once she made herself so sick she could not keep down any food for days.\u00a0</p><p><b>Supper was for language lessons.\u00a0</b>The blind girl understood Braavosi and could speak it passably, she had even lost most of her barbaric accent, but the kindly man was not content.<b> He was insisting that she improve her High Valyrian and learn the tongues of Lys and Pentos too.\u00a0</b></p><p><b>In the evening she played the lying game with the waif, but without eyes to see the game was very different.</b> Sometimes all she had to go on was tone and choice of words; other times the waif allowed her to lay hands upon her face. At first the game was much, much harder, the next thing to impossible \u2026 but just when she was near the point of screaming with frustration, it all became much easier. She learned to hear the lies, to feel them in the play of the muscles around the mouth and eyes.</p><p><br/></p><p>A Dance with Dragons - The Blind Girl</p><p><br/></p></blockquote><p>She is learning on how to use her others senses and not depend only on her eyes, which is very important as a fighter.</p><blockquote><p>\n\nMany of her other duties had remained the same, but as she went about them she stumbled over furnishings, walked into walls, dropped trays, got hopelessly helplessly lost inside the temple. <b>Once she almost fell headlong down the steps, but Syrio Forel had taught her balance in another lifetime, when she was the girl called Arya, and somehow she recovered and caught herself in time.</b><br/><br/></p><p>\n\nSome nights she might have cried herself to sleep if she had still been Arry or Weasel or Cat, or even Arya of House Stark \u2026 but no one had no tears. <b>Withouteyes, even the simplest task was perilous.</b> She burned herself a dozen times as she worked with Umma in the kitchens. Once, chopping onions, she cut herfinger down to the bone. Twice she could not even find her own room in the cellar and had to sleep on the floor at the base of the steps.\u00a0</p><p><b>All the nooks and alcoves made the temple treacherous, even after the blind girl had learned to use her ears;</b> the way her footsteps bounced off the ceiling and echoed roundthe legs of the thirty tall stone gods made the walls themselves seem to move, and the pool of still black water did strange things to sound as well.</p><p><br/></p><p>A Dance with Dragons - The Blind Girl</p></blockquote><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>So,\nyes. I believe Arya storyline in the books is a hint that she end this story as\na queen. \u00a0Its no secret to anyone that I believe\nSansa will marry her cousin Jon Snow and both of them will rule the 7 kingdoms\nas King and Queen, so how does Queen Arya works then?<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>I believe The North will accept to a\nunion to the rest of the Kingdom via marriage, mirroring what happened to Dorne\nin the past. There is foreshadowing of the North refusing to bend the knee in\nthe end and joining the Union using a marriage alliance in the books:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;MY LORDS!&rdquo; he shouted,\nhis voice booming off the rafters. &ldquo;Here is what I say to these two\nkings!&rdquo; He spat. &ldquo;Renly Baratheon is nothing to me, nor Stannis\nneither. Why should they rule over me and mine, from some flowery seat in\nHighgarden or Dorne? <b>What do they know\nof the Wall or the wolfswood or the barrows of the First Men? Even their gods\nare wrong.</b> The Others take the Lannisters too, I&rsquo;ve had a bellyful of\nthem.&rdquo; He reached back over his shoulder and drew his immense two-handed\ngreatsword. &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t we rule ourselves again? It was the dragons we\nmarried, and the dragons are all dead!&rdquo; He pointed at Robb with the blade.\n&ldquo;There sits the only king I mean to bow my knee to, m'lords,&rdquo; he\nthundered. &ldquo;The King in the North!&rdquo; </p><p>A GAME OF THRONES Catelyn XI </p></blockquote><p>Funny how Jon Snow fits\nLord Greatjon\u00a0 Umber description of a good King for the North. Jon was Lord\nCommander of the Nights Watch, he knows about the Wolfswood and follows the Old\nGods. So, I predict the North would accept a union as long as Jon married a\nStark, which would be Sansa. And just like Dorne was able to keep some\nindependence, the North would also keep the right to call their heirs as Kings\nand Queens in the North.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This would parallel what\nhappened when Scotland decided that they no longer wanted to be part of the\nEnglish Kingdom and rebelled against the crown, starting The Wars of Scottish\nIndependence, were a series of military campaigns were fought between the\nKingdom of Scotland and the Kingdom of England in the late 13th and early 14th\ncenturies.</p><p>The conflicts came to and end with the The Treaty of\nEdinburgh\u2013Northampton and a few years later, the Treaty of Berwick (1357).\nScotland became an independent country, with its own King and ruler, yet still\npart of the Great Britain Kingdom.\u00a0<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>And I want to point out this cute foreshadowing that <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUdltV7CT5rkYP_xKh3KxyA\">@sherlokiness</a> posted on my last meta about this theory.</p><p><br/></p><blockquote><p>Her sister was a queen, <b>why not her?</b></p><p>A Dance with Dragons - Jon XIII</p></blockquote><p><br/></p><p>YES, why not Arya too???</p>",

I believe this part of her storyline was necessary because it will be in Braavos that Arya will learn how to be a warrior and in the end of the day, Westerosis armies will only follow warriors, so it was very important for Arya to experience this part of her journey.</p><p><br></p><p>Her journey in the House of Black and White is also a big foreshadowing as her role as a leader in the end.\u00a0First as Cat of the Canals, she is forced to serve (which is a constant theme in George RRMartin story, he always makes sure, his future leaders spend part of their storyline serving, we will find the same theme on Jon, Sansa and Theon storyline.</p><p><br></p><blockquote><p>\n\n\u201cYou lie.

When the moon was black she was no one, a servant of the Many-Faced God in a robe of black and white.

Some days she still helped Umma cook, chopping big white mushrooms and boning fish. But only when the moon was black. </b>The rest of the time she was an orphan girl in a pair of battered boots too big for her feet and a brown cloak with a ragged hem, crying \u201cMussels and cockles and clams\u201d as she wheeled her barrow through the Ragman\u2019s Harbor.<br><br></p><p>A Feast for Crows - Cat Of The Canals</p><p><br></p></blockquote><p>\u00a0As part of her training, she is being educated in the lessosn of poisons and how to play the game of lies, which its going to be very useful once she returns to Westeros and starts her revenge game.</p><p><br></p><blockquote><p><b>\n\n\n\nThat was her first lesson. There had been many more.<br><br></b></p><p><b>Poisons and potions were for the afternoons.</b> She had smell and touch and taste to help her, but touch and taste could be perilous when grinding poisons, and with some of the waif\u2019s more toxic concoctions even smell was less than safe. Burned pinky tips and blistered lips became familiar to her, and once she made herself so sick she could not keep down any food for days.\u00a0</p><p><b>Supper was for language lessons.\u00a0</b>The blind girl understood Braavosi and could speak it passably, she had even lost most of her barbaric accent, but the kindly man was not content.<b> He was insisting that she improve her High Valyrian and learn the tongues of Lys and Pentos too.\u00a0</b></p><p><b>In the evening she played the lying game with the waif, but without eyes to see the game was very different.</b> Sometimes all she had to go on was tone and choice of words; other times the waif allowed her to lay hands upon her face. At first the game was much, much harder, the next thing to impossible \u2026 but just when she was near the point of screaming with frustration, it all became much easier. She learned to hear the lies, to feel them in the play of the muscles around the mouth and eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>A Dance with Dragons - The Blind Girl</p><p><br></p></blockquote><p>She is learning on how to use her others senses and not depend only on her eyes, which is very important as a fighter.</p><blockquote><p>\n\nMany of her other duties had remained the same, but as she went about them she stumbled over furnishings, walked into walls, dropped trays, got hopelessly helplessly lost inside the temple. <b>Once she almost fell headlong down the steps, but Syrio Forel had taught her balance in another lifetime, when she was the girl called Arya, and somehow she recovered and caught herself in time.</b><br><br></p><p>\n\nSome nights she might have cried herself to sleep if she had still been Arry or Weasel or Cat, or even Arya of House Stark \u2026 but no one had no tears. <b>Withouteyes, even the simplest task was perilous.</b> She burned herself a dozen times as she worked with Umma in the kitchens. Once, chopping onions, she cut herfinger down to the bone. Twice she could not even find her own room in the cellar and had to sleep on the floor at the base of the steps.\u00a0</p><p><b>All the nooks and alcoves made the temple treacherous, even after the blind girl had learned to use her ears;</b> the way her footsteps bounced off the ceiling and echoed roundthe legs of the thirty tall stone gods made the walls themselves seem to move, and the pool of still black water did strange things to sound as well.</p><p><br></p><p>A Dance with Dragons - The Blind Girl</p></blockquote><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>So,\nyes. I believe Arya storyline in the books is a hint that she end this story as\na queen. \u00a0Its no secret to anyone that I believe\nSansa will marry her cousin Jon Snow and both of them will rule the 7 kingdoms\nas King and Queen, so how does Queen Arya works then?<br></p><p><br></p><p>I believe The North will accept to a\nunion to the rest of the Kingdom via marriage, mirroring what happened to Dorne\nin the past. There is foreshadowing of the North refusing to bend the knee in\nthe end and joining the Union using a marriage alliance in the books:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cMY LORDS!\u201d he shouted,\nhis voice booming off the rafters. \u201cHere is what I say to these two\nkings!\u201d He spat. \u201cRenly Baratheon is nothing to me, nor Stannis\nneither. Why should they rule over me and mine, from some flowery seat in\nHighgarden or Dorne? <b>What do they know\nof the Wall or the wolfswood or the barrows of the First Men? Even their gods\nare wrong.</b> The Others take the Lannisters too, I\u2019ve had a bellyful of\nthem.\u201d He reached back over his shoulder and drew his immense two-handed\ngreatsword. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t we rule ourselves again? It was the dragons we\nmarried, and the dragons are all dead!\u201d He pointed at Robb with the blade.\n\u201cThere sits the only king I mean to bow my knee to, m'lords,\u201d he\nthundered. \u201cThe King in the North!\u201d </p><p>A GAME OF THRONES Catelyn XI </p></blockquote><p>Funny how Jon Snow fits\nLord Greatjon\u00a0 Umber description of a good King for the North. Jon was Lord\nCommander of the Nights Watch, he knows about the Wolfswood and follows the Old\nGods. So, I predict the North would accept a union as long as Jon married a\nStark, which would be Sansa. And just like Dorne was able to keep some\nindependence, the North would also keep the right to call their heirs as Kings\nand Queens in the North.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This would parallel what\nhappened when Scotland decided that they no longer wanted to be part of the\nEnglish Kingdom and rebelled against the crown, starting The Wars of Scottish\nIndependence, were a series of military campaigns were fought between the\nKingdom of Scotland and the Kingdom of England in the late 13th and early 14th\ncenturies.</p><p>The conflicts came to and end with the The Treaty of\nEdinburgh\u2013Northampton and a few years later, the Treaty of Berwick (1357).\nScotland became an independent country, with its own King and ruler, yet still\npart of the Great Britain Kingdom.\u00a0<br></p><p><br></p><p>And I want to point out this cute foreshadowing that <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUdltV7CT5rkYP_xKh3KxyA\">@sherlokiness</a> posted on my last meta about this theory.</p><p><br></p><blockquote><p>Her sister was a queen, <b>why not her?</b></p><p>A Dance with Dragons - Jon XIII</p></blockquote><p><br></p><p>YES, why not Arya too???</p></p>",

At first the game was much, much harder, the next thing to impossible \u2026 but just when she was near the point of screaming with frustration, it all became much easier. She learned to hear the lies, to feel them in the play of the muscles around the mouth and eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>A Dance with Dragons - The Blind Girl</p><p><br></p></blockquote><p>She is learning on how to use her others senses and not depend only on her eyes, which is very important as a fighter.</p><blockquote><p>\n\nMany of her other duties had remained the same, but as she went about them she stumbled over furnishings, walked into walls, dropped trays, got hopelessly helplessly lost inside the temple. <b>Once she almost fell headlong down the steps, but Syrio Forel had taught her balance in another lifetime, when she was the girl called Arya, and somehow she recovered and caught herself in time.</b><br><br></p><p>\n\nSome nights she might have cried herself to sleep if she had still been Arry or Weasel or Cat, or even Arya of House Stark \u2026 but no one had no tears. <b>Withouteyes, even the simplest task was perilous.</b> She burned herself a dozen times as she worked with Umma in the kitchens. Once, chopping onions, she cut herfinger down to the bone.

I believe Arya storyline in the books is a hint that she end this story as\na queen. \u00a0Its no secret to anyone that I believe\nSansa will marry her cousin Jon Snow and both of them will rule the 7 kingdoms\nas King and Queen, so how does Queen Arya works then?<br></p><p><br></p><p>I believe The North will accept to a\nunion to the rest of the Kingdom via marriage, mirroring what happened to Dorne\nin the past. There is foreshadowing of the North refusing to bend the knee in\nthe end and joining the Union using a marriage alliance in the books:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cMY LORDS!\u201d he shouted,\nhis voice booming off the rafters. \u201cHere is what I say to these two\nkings!\u201d He spat. \u201cRenly Baratheon is nothing to me, nor Stannis\nneither. Why should they rule over me and mine, from some flowery seat in\nHighgarden or Dorne? <b>What do they know\nof the Wall or the wolfswood or the barrows of the First Men? Even their gods\nare wrong.</b> The Others take the Lannisters too, I\u2019ve had a bellyful of\nthem.\u201d He reached back over his shoulder and drew his immense two-handed\ngreatsword. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t we rule ourselves again? It was the dragons we\nmarried, and the dragons are all dead!\u201d He pointed at Robb with the blade.\n\u201cThere sits the only king I mean to bow my knee to, m'lords,\u201d he\nthundered. \u201cThe King in the North!\u201d </p><p>A GAME OF THRONES Catelyn XI </p></blockquote><p>Funny how Jon Snow fits\nLord Greatjon\u00a0 Umber description of a good King for the North. Jon was Lord\nCommander of the Nights Watch, he knows about the Wolfswood and follows the Old\nGods. So, I predict the North would accept a union as long as Jon married a\nStark, which would be Sansa. And just like Dorne was able to keep some\nindependence, the North would also keep the right to call their heirs as Kings\nand Queens in the North.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This would parallel what\nhappened when Scotland decided that they no longer wanted to be part of the\nEnglish Kingdom and rebelled against the crown, starting The Wars of Scottish\nIndependence, were a series of military campaigns were fought between the\nKingdom of Scotland and the Kingdom of England in the late 13th and early 14th\ncenturies.</p><p>The conflicts came to and end with the The Treaty of\nEdinburgh\u2013Northampton and a few years later, the Treaty of Berwick (1357).\nScotland became an independent country, with its own King and ruler, yet still\npart of the Great Britain Kingdom.\u00a0<br></p><p><br></p><p>And I want to point out this cute foreshadowing that <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUdltV7CT5rkYP_xKh3KxyA\">@sherlokiness</a> posted on my last meta about this theory.</p><p><br></p><blockquote><p>Her sister was a queen, <b>why not her?</b></p><p>A Dance with Dragons - Jon XIII</p></blockquote><p><br></p><p>YES, why not Arya too???</p></p>",

I believe this part of her storyline was necessary because it will be in Braavos that Arya will learn how to be a warrior and in the end of the day, Westerosis armies will only follow warriors, so it was very important for Arya to experience this part of her journey.</p><p><br /></p><p>Her journey in the House of Black and White is also a big foreshadowing as her role as a leader in the end.&nbsp;First as Cat of the Canals, she is forced to serve (which is a constant theme in George RRMartin story, he always makes sure, his future leaders spend part of their storyline serving, we will find the same theme on Jon, Sansa and Theon storyline.</p><p><br /></p><blockquote><p>\n\n&ldquo;You lie. You are Cat of the canals, I know you well. Go and sleep, child. On the morrow you must serve.&rdquo;&ldquo;<b>All men must serve.</b>&rdquo; And so she did, three days of every thirty. When the moon was black she was no one, a servant of the Many-Faced God in a robe of black and white. She walked beside the kindly man through the fragrant darkness, carrying her iron lantern. <b>She washed the dead, went through their clothes, and counted out their coins. Some days she still helped Umma cook, chopping big white mushrooms and boning fish. But only when the moon was black. </b>The rest of the time she was an orphan girl in a pair of battered boots too big for her feet and a brown cloak with a ragged hem, crying &ldquo;Mussels and cockles and clams&rdquo; as she wheeled her barrow through the Ragman&rsquo;s Harbor.<br /><br /></p><p>A Feast for Crows - Cat Of The Canals</p><p><br /></p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;As part of her training, she is being educated in the lessosn of poisons and how to play the game of lies, which its going to be very useful once she returns to Westeros and starts her revenge game.</p><p><br /></p><blockquote><p><b>\n\n\n\nThat was her first lesson. There had been many more.<br /><br /></b></p><p><b>Poisons and potions were for the afternoons.</b> She had smell and touch and taste to help her, but touch and taste could be perilous when grinding poisons, and with some of the waif&rsquo;s more toxic concoctions even smell was less than safe. Burned pinky tips and blistered lips became familiar to her, and once she made herself so sick she could not keep down any food for days.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Supper was for language lessons.&nbsp;</b>The blind girl understood Braavosi and could speak it passably, she had even lost most of her barbaric accent, but the kindly man was not content.<b> He was insisting that she improve her High Valyrian and learn the tongues of Lys and Pentos too.&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>In the evening she played the lying game with the waif, but without eyes to see the game was very different.</b> Sometimes all she had to go on was tone and choice of words; other times the waif allowed her to lay hands upon her face. At first the game was much, much harder, the next thing to impossible &hellip; but just when she was near the point of screaming with frustration, it all became much easier. She learned to hear the lies, to feel them in the play of the muscles around the mouth and eyes.</p><p><br /></p><p>A Dance with Dragons - The Blind Girl</p><p><br /></p></blockquote><p>She is learning on how to use her others senses and not depend only on her eyes, which is very important as a fighter.</p><blockquote><p>\n\nMany of her other duties had remained the same, but as she went about them she stumbled over furnishings, walked into walls, dropped trays, got hopelessly helplessly lost inside the temple. <b>Once she almost fell headlong down the steps, but Syrio Forel had taught her balance in another lifetime, when she was the girl called Arya, and somehow she recovered and caught herself in time.</b><br /><br /></p><p>\n\nSome nights she might have cried herself to sleep if she had still been Arry or Weasel or Cat, or even Arya of House Stark &hellip; but no one had no tears. <b>Withouteyes, even the simplest task was perilous.</b> She burned herself a dozen times as she worked with Umma in the kitchens. Once, chopping onions, she cut herfinger down to the bone. Twice she could not even find her own room in the cellar and had to sleep on the floor at the base of the steps.&nbsp;</p><p><b>All the nooks and alcoves made the temple treacherous, even after the blind girl had learned to use her ears;</b> the way her footsteps bounced off the ceiling and echoed roundthe legs of the thirty tall stone gods made the walls themselves seem to move, and the pool of still black water did strange things to sound as well.</p><p><br /></p><p>A Dance with Dragons - The Blind Girl</p></blockquote><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>So,\nyes. I believe Arya storyline in the books is a hint that she end this story as\na queen. &nbsp;Its no secret to anyone that I believe\nSansa will marry her cousin Jon Snow and both of them will rule the 7 kingdoms\nas King and Queen, so how does Queen Arya works then?<br /></p><p><br /></p><p>I believe The North will accept to a\nunion to the rest of the Kingdom via marriage, mirroring what happened to Dorne\nin the past. There is foreshadowing of the North refusing to bend the knee in\nthe end and joining the Union using a marriage alliance in the books:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;MY LORDS!&rdquo; he shouted,\nhis voice booming off the rafters. &ldquo;Here is what I say to these two\nkings!&rdquo; He spat. &ldquo;Renly Baratheon is nothing to me, nor Stannis\nneither. Why should they rule over me and mine, from some flowery seat in\nHighgarden or Dorne? <b>What do they know\nof the Wall or the wolfswood or the barrows of the First Men? Even their gods\nare wrong.</b> The Others take the Lannisters too, I&rsquo;ve had a bellyful of\nthem.&rdquo; He reached back over his shoulder and drew his immense two-handed\ngreatsword. &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t we rule ourselves again? It was the dragons we\nmarried, and the dragons are all dead!&rdquo; He pointed at Robb with the blade.\n&ldquo;There sits the only king I mean to bow my knee to, m'lords,&rdquo; he\nthundered. &ldquo;The King in the North!&rdquo; </p><p>A GAME OF THRONES Catelyn XI </p></blockquote><p>Funny how Jon Snow fits\nLord Greatjon&nbsp; Umber description of a good King for the North. Jon was Lord\nCommander of the Nights Watch, he knows about the Wolfswood and follows the Old\nGods. So, I predict the North would accept a union as long as Jon married a\nStark, which would be Sansa. And just like Dorne was able to keep some\nindependence, the North would also keep the right to call their heirs as Kings\nand Queens in the North.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This would parallel what\nhappened when Scotland decided that they no longer wanted to be part of the\nEnglish Kingdom and rebelled against the crown, starting The Wars of Scottish\nIndependence, were a series of military campaigns were fought between the\nKingdom of Scotland and the Kingdom of England in the late 13th and early 14th\ncenturies.</p><p>The conflicts came to and end with the The Treaty of\nEdinburgh&ndash;Northampton and a few years later, the Treaty of Berwick (1357).\nScotland became an independent country, with its own King and ruler, yet still\npart of the Great Britain Kingdom.&nbsp;<br /></p><p><br /></p><p>And I want to point out this cute foreshadowing that <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUdltV7CT5rkYP_xKh3KxyA\">@sherlokiness</a> posted on my last meta about this theory.</p><p><br /></p><blockquote><p>Her sister was a queen, <b>why not her?</b></p><p>A Dance with Dragons - Jon XIII</p></blockquote><p><br /></p><p>YES, why not Arya too???</p></p>",

Jon\u2019s baby was born, a Targaryen with black hair once again, the babe took after Jon wholeheartedly. On that day the throne took an heir in the form of a baby boy. Samwell\u2019s son was born shortly after as well. A trueborn Tarly, but still second in line to Samwell Jr. The younger Sam was legitimized as the rightful son of house Tarly. Sansa revealed her pregnancy around that time as well, but she was hardly showing yet. </p><p>Arya and Gendry\u2019s wedding was still on everyone\u2019s mind though. The planning began almost instantly after the babes were born. He had went and spent time in the Stormlands without her and he was waiting for everyone to arrive at Storm\u2019s End soon enough. The latest raven he received promised their arrival within the week. Boy was he excited to see her. He wondered if she let her hair grow even longer since the last time he saw her. He couldn\u2019t imagine her with long flowing hair, but then again she had begun wearing more and more gowns since the last time he saw her. She still refused to sit in on sewing lessons and mind her ladylike manners, forever preferring the training yard over the sewing room. </p><p>Gendry was leaning on the railing of the balcony of his chamber when he heard a knock. I yelled for them to enter and walked back inside begrudgingly. His squire was standing by the door of his chambers. He still had yet to get used to having a squire, how could he teach someone how to fight when he used a warhammer instead of a sword. There was no skill involved really, just brute force and a knack for knowing when to strike. </p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Gendry asked when the boy had still not spoken.</p><p>\u201cMy lord, lady Stark and her party have arrived. They are down by the gates.\u201d Gendry nodded and all but ran down to the gates. He passed everyone and they all smiled at their lords excitement. He saw the carriage and the horses and slowed down to a proper speed. The Hound was the first to step into his view and he greeted him with a handshake. He knew the Hound did not play the game of formalities like everyone else and he appreciated him for it. The carriage opened and Sansa stepped out, her belly a tad bit more noticeable now. He bowed to her and kissed her hand. </p><p>\u201cLady Stark, I\u2019m glad to see you fared well on your trip South.\u201d She nodded her head and stepped aside. He looked around eagerly but could not for the life of him find Arya. \u201cSansa, where-\u201d</p><p>He yelped as someone leaped on his back from behind. He heard a fit of giggles and grabbed the person and whipped around revealing his betrothed. Arya smiled up at him with a mischievous smirk. He was glad he did not need to great her formally now, and instead, he lifted her into the air with his arms wrapped tightly around her waist. Her own arms wrapped around his neck, her face buried into his neck. She inhaled his smell of cologne and rain. She was surprised the the rain held off for their arrival today; it rained all too frequently in the Stormlands. Then again some could argue it snowed too much in the North. Then stayed like that in each other\u2019s embrace for what felt like forever until they knew everyone was waiting for them to part. He set her on the ground gently and moved aside to address everyone around them. </p><p>\u201cI thank you all for making this journey south. I know the Winter Road is not an easy one to travel. You must be wanting to get to your chambers and rest until supper.\u201d He turned to the servants and asked them kindly, \u201cwould you please show Lady Stark and Ser Clegane to their chambers? Also, make sure that all the horses are settled into the stables.\u201d</p><p>He turned to Arya then and extended his elbow. She took it with a roll of her eyes and moved to walk beside him. He walked them along the railing of the side of the castle until they reached the stairs down to the docks. Together they walked in silence until they stood overlooking the sea. He released her arm then and turned to her bringing her in for another tight embrace. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>Arya turned and pressed a kiss to his cheek, making Gendry blush furiously. He never imagined he would feel her lips pressed against his skin. It was something he had dreamed about since the moment he left her behind in Winterfell. Their departure was something he wished he could avoid but she could not leave with him. She needed to spend time in Winterfell with her sister before she headed south. Sansa kept going on and on about needed to prepare her for the wedding. Arya groaned but gave her sister this small victory. </p><p>Gendry\u2019s speculation about her hair being longer was true. It fell midway down her back now. It was wavy and braided in the northern fashion. He want nothing more then to run his hands through it and feel the silky strands between his fingers. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you too.\u201d Arya said turning to rest her head against his arm. They stood there and watched the sunset. The days that followed until the King and all their other friends arrived at Storm\u2019s End were spent in the same fashion. Gendry and Arya spending practically all of their time together. Ignoring all of their responsibilities until they couldn\u2019t anymore. Before anyone knew it the date of the wedding was upon them and Arya was woken up early to begin her preparations. She was bathed and scrubbed nearly raw, her skin a bright pink and they had shaved the hair off her legs. Her hair was curled and her face painted with rogue. They put black clay of some sort on her eyelashes which made her eyes look even more dramatic than they were. Today was the first day she would see her gown and the only time she would wear it. Sansa went on and on about how her daughters would wear it after her. Sansa made the gown herself and put hours of work into getting the detailing just right. It was a beautiful white color with grey and black stitches. Sansa also took the time to sew in jewels that looked white to the eye, but when hit with the right amount of sun glistened a beautiful yellow. Arya had seen nothing like it before. When they put her in it and she saw herself in the mirror for the first time Arya couldn\u2019t help but gasp. For the first time in her life she felt beautiful. Sansa did not cry but she looked very proud of her younger sister. When it came time for the ceremony Sansa left to go stand with the Hound. Arya stood in her room alone and for the first time that say she started to worry. She wasn\u2019t meant for this, she told her father years ago that this wasn\u2019t her, but here she was trying to make him proud of her after all these years. When she was just about to rip the dress from her shoulders Jon entered the room. He grabbed her and pulled her into a tight hug. He took her by the hand and rested it on his elbow, not giving her the option to back out. Jon knew her too well. He knew she would make the wrong decision. </p><p>Slowly, they began their walk down to the sept where she would give away her life as Arya Stark. She would not be Arya Stark, but unlike her experience at the House of Black and White she would still be in control of her path. She would be Arya Baratheon a woman in complete control because Gendry would never make her do anything she did not want. </p><p>When she first saw Gendry standing on the steps of the sept she forgot how to breathe. He was wearing beautiful black and yellow robes and a Baratheon cloak was clasped around his neck. When she finally stood beside him Arya went through the motions on automatically. She said the words without thinking and before she knew it the Stark cloak lifted from her back and the Baratheon cloak replaced it. Gendry looked down at her then, really looked at her, and almost cried. She was breathtaking, her beautiful dark brown hair hanging down her back in loose curls. His hands grasped her face lightly and when his lips captured hers for the first time he was drowning in a pool of bliss. Arya Stark, no. Arya Baratheon, his wife, would be the death of him and everyone cheering for them in this sept knew it. </p><p>When Gendry pulled away from her, Arya looked up at him with wonder and admiration. They grasped hands and walked down the steps of the sept and past all their friend\u2019s eyes. The feast would start soon and then the bedding, but all Gendry could do was look forward to spending the rest of his days with the woman he loved.</p>",

Jon\u2019s baby was born, a Targaryen with black hair once again, the babe took after Jon wholeheartedly. On that day the throne took an heir in the form of a baby boy. Samwell\u2019s son was born shortly after as well. A trueborn Tarly, but still second in line to Samwell Jr. The younger Sam was legitimized as the rightful son of house Tarly. Sansa revealed her pregnancy around that time as well, but she was hardly showing yet. </p><p>Arya and Gendry\u2019s wedding was still on everyone\u2019s mind though. The planning began almost instantly after the babes were born. He had went and spent time in the Stormlands without her and he was waiting for everyone to arrive at Storm\u2019s End soon enough. The latest raven he received promised their arrival within the week. Boy was he excited to see her. He wondered if she let her hair grow even longer since the last time he saw her. He couldn\u2019t imagine her with long flowing hair, but then again she had begun wearing more and more gowns since the last time he saw her. She still refused to sit in on sewing lessons and mind her ladylike manners, forever preferring the training yard over the sewing room. </p><p>Gendry was leaning on the railing of the balcony of his chamber when he heard a knock. I yelled for them to enter and walked back inside begrudgingly. His squire was standing by the door of his chambers. He still had yet to get used to having a squire, how could he teach someone how to fight when he used a warhammer instead of a sword. There was no skill involved really, just brute force and a knack for knowing when to strike. </p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Gendry asked when the boy had still not spoken.</p><p>\u201cMy lord, lady Stark and her party have arrived. They are down by the gates.\u201d Gendry nodded and all but ran down to the gates. He passed everyone and they all smiled at their lords excitement. He saw the carriage and the horses and slowed down to a proper speed. The Hound was the first to step into his view and he greeted him with a handshake. He knew the Hound did not play the game of formalities like everyone else and he appreciated him for it. The carriage opened and Sansa stepped out, her belly a tad bit more noticeable now. He bowed to her and kissed her hand. </p><p>\u201cLady Stark, I\u2019m glad to see you fared well on your trip South.\u201d She nodded her head and stepped aside. He looked around eagerly but could not for the life of him find Arya. \u201cSansa, where-\u201d</p><p>He yelped as someone leaped on his back from behind. He heard a fit of giggles and grabbed the person and whipped around revealing his betrothed. Arya smiled up at him with a mischievous smirk. He was glad he did not need to great her formally now, and instead, he lifted her into the air with his arms wrapped tightly around her waist. Her own arms wrapped around his neck, her face buried into his neck. She inhaled his smell of cologne and rain. She was surprised the the rain held off for their arrival today; it rained all too frequently in the Stormlands. Then again some could argue it snowed too much in the North. Then stayed like that in each other\u2019s embrace for what felt like forever until they knew everyone was waiting for them to part. He set her on the ground gently and moved aside to address everyone around them. </p><p>\u201cI thank you all for making this journey south. I know the Winter Road is not an easy one to travel. You must be wanting to get to your chambers and rest until supper.\u201d He turned to the servants and asked them kindly, \u201cwould you please show Lady Stark and Ser Clegane to their chambers? Also, make sure that all the horses are settled into the stables.\u201d</p><p>He turned to Arya then and extended his elbow. She took it with a roll of her eyes and moved to walk beside him. He walked them along the railing of the side of the castle until they reached the stairs down to the docks. Together they walked in silence until they stood overlooking the sea. He released her arm then and turned to her bringing her in for another tight embrace. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>Arya turned and pressed a kiss to his cheek, making Gendry blush furiously. He never imagined he would feel her lips pressed against his skin. It was something he had dreamed about since the moment he left her behind in Winterfell. Their departure was something he wished he could avoid but she could not leave with him. She needed to spend time in Winterfell with her sister before she headed south. Sansa kept going on and on about needed to prepare her for the wedding. Arya groaned but gave her sister this small victory. </p><p>Gendry\u2019s speculation about her hair being longer was true. It fell midway down her back now. It was wavy and braided in the northern fashion. He want nothing more then to run his hands through it and feel the silky strands between his fingers. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you too.\u201d Arya said turning to rest her head against his arm. They stood there and watched the sunset. The days that followed until the King and all their other friends arrived at Storm\u2019s End were spent in the same fashion. Gendry and Arya spending practically all of their time together. Ignoring all of their responsibilities until they couldn\u2019t anymore. Before anyone knew it the date of the wedding was upon them and Arya was woken up early to begin her preparations. She was bathed and scrubbed nearly raw, her skin a bright pink and they had shaved the hair off her legs. Her hair was curled and her face painted with rogue. They put black clay of some sort on her eyelashes which made her eyes look even more dramatic than they were. Today was the first day she would see her gown and the only time she would wear it. Sansa went on and on about how her daughters would wear it after her. Sansa made the gown herself and put hours of work into getting the detailing just right. It was a beautiful white color with grey and black stitches. Sansa also took the time to sew in jewels that looked white to the eye, but when hit with the right amount of sun glistened a beautiful yellow. Arya had seen nothing like it before. When they put her in it and she saw herself in the mirror for the first time Arya couldn\u2019t help but gasp. For the first time in her life she felt beautiful. Sansa did not cry but she looked very proud of her younger sister. When it came time for the ceremony Sansa left to go stand with the Hound. Arya stood in her room alone and for the first time that say she started to worry. She wasn\u2019t meant for this, she told her father years ago that this wasn\u2019t her, but here she was trying to make him proud of her after all these years. When she was just about to rip the dress from her shoulders Jon entered the room. He grabbed her and pulled her into a tight hug. He took her by the hand and rested it on his elbow, not giving her the option to back out. Jon knew her too well. He knew she would make the wrong decision. </p><p>Slowly, they began their walk down to the sept where she would give away her life as Arya Stark. She would not be Arya Stark, but unlike her experience at the House of Black and White she would still be in control of her path. She would be Arya Baratheon a woman in complete control because Gendry would never make her do anything she did not want. </p><p>When she first saw Gendry standing on the steps of the sept she forgot how to breathe. He was wearing beautiful black and yellow robes and a Baratheon cloak was clasped around his neck. When she finally stood beside him Arya went through the motions on automatically. She said the words without thinking and before she knew it the Stark cloak lifted from her back and the Baratheon cloak replaced it. Gendry looked down at her then, really looked at her, and almost cried. She was breathtaking, her beautiful dark brown hair hanging down her back in loose curls. His hands grasped her face lightly and when his lips captured hers for the first time he was drowning in a pool of bliss. Arya Stark, no. Arya Baratheon, his wife, would be the death of him and everyone cheering for them in this sept knew it. </p><p>When Gendry pulled away from her, Arya looked up at him with wonder and admiration. They grasped hands and walked down the steps of the sept and past all their friend\u2019s eyes. The feast would start soon and then the bedding, but all Gendry could do was look forward to spending the rest of his days with the woman he loved.</p></p>",
