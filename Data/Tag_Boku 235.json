Summer break, of course! And on top of that you were graduating! \nYou stood in line to get the tickets.

Your heartbeat \nquickened as you scanned your surroundings. Nothing looked out of the \nordinary. Your fingers fumbled to type out your message. </p><p>Y/N: who is this? </p><p>The next message came immediately. </p><p>\n \u00a0<i>X: take a wild guess, sweetheart. </i>\n</p><p>You had absolutely no clue. You looked up into the sea of people with a frown on your face. <i>Who was the mystery person? They had to be somewhere near you. </i></p><p>You felt an accidental shove from one of the students behind you \ncausing you to trip over a raised piece of concrete. Your body couldn\u2019t \nreact quick enough. The ground was coming closer to your face. You \nbraced for your stony face plant</p><p>Two strong arms wrapped around you. You were lifted back up with \nease. \u201cFalling for me all over again?\u201d The voice chuckled from behind \nyou. <i>That voice. I know that voice.</i> You turned to greet your savior. <br/></p><!-- more --><p>\n \u00a0<i>Shindou.</i>\n</p><p>He smiled down at you, \u201cDid you miss me?\u201d You couldn\u2019t begin to form a sentence. You mind raced. <i>Why\n is he here? How did he find me? Why is he in his hero outfit? He looks \nso much taller now. And so much more.. muscular. Why did we break up \nagain?</i> \u201cW-why are you\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cWhy am I here? Good question! Well, you see, Ketsubutsu\u2019s 2nd years \nwere doing some training. Our training partners were taking a while to \nget ready so I excused myself to use the restroom and decided to see \nwhat all this commotion was about. And then I saw your pretty little \nface and I sent you a text.\u201d </p><p>It took you a minute to wrap your brain around what he just told you.\n \u201cSo you\u2019re the mystery number person?\u201d You pointed a finger at him. He \nnodded. </p><p>\u201cAnd you went to Mirio\u2019s party last weekend?\u201d Your finger was still \nextended towards him. He nodded again and grabbed your hand, \u201cya know, \nI\u2019m a little disappointed that you deleted my number and also,\u201d his \nfeatures darkened with a playful smirk as he stepped closer, \u201cit\u2019s not \npolite to point.\u201d He winked at you and a surge pulsed through your body \ncausing your stomach to flip.</p><p>Your knees felt weak; you grabbed on to him for support. \u201cShindou, \nwhat the hell was that!\u201d You muttered looking up at the boy. \u201cMy quirk. \nIt\u2019s improved wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d He held you close, providing the \nbalance you needed. Improved was an understatement. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your turn to get your tickets,\u201d he pointed you towards the \nticket lady. She made you sign a few papers and then gave you an \nenvelope with tickets. You decided that you would walk Shindou back to \nhis class so the two of you could catch up.</p><p>As you and Shindou walked, the two of you talked about everything you\n could think of. It felt like the two of you had never been apart. You \nglanced into the envelope at your graduation tickets as Shindou told you\n about his latest adventure. <i>One extra&hellip; should I give it to him?</i> You glanced at Shindou. His eyes crinkled with his smile as he explained his story. <i>So cute..</i></p><p>\u201cOh, so now you\u2019re staring? Really, Y/N, what happened to your \nmanners!\u201d Shindou grinned down at you. You blushed slightly, looking \naway quickly. He stopped abruptly. You stopped as well\u2014trying to avoid \neye contact. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I like when you look at me.\u201d He tilted your \nhead towards him. </p><p>Your cheeks burned as you made eye contact with him, \u201cI, uh, I like looking at you..\u201d <i>God, that sounded so dumb. Way to be smooth, Y/N.</i> He leaned in close to you, \u201cyou know, I really do miss you..\u201d </p><p>\u201cI-i missed you too,\u201d Your eyes fluttered to his lips. <i>He was so close&hellip;you could just\u2014</i></p><p>\u201cIs that Y/N!!! Who is she with! Midoriya do you know that guy?! He kinda looks like you but hotter!!\u201d</p><p>\n \u00a0<i>Izuku!</i>\n</p><p>You stepped back from Shindou quickly and searched for the owner of \nthe voice. It was that yellow haired boy from the party. He was pointing\n right at you and Shindou. <i>Oh no.</i> Your eyes scanned the crowd of underclassmen in their hero suits and you quickly found the hero Deku. </p><p>\nHis eyes were already glued to the tall boy standing next to you. They \nfluttered to you. His stare was cold. You gave him a small wave. He \nforced a small smile. You cringed in the inside. He definitely saw that \nShindou was just trying to make a move of you.\n</p><p>\n \u201cWell, this is my stop!\u201d Shindou smiled and gave your head a small pat.\n He stepped a bit closer to you, trying to recreate that opening from \nbefore.\n</p><p>\n\u201cWait&hellip; you\u2019re training with class 1-A.\u201d You raised an eyebrow at the \nboy. You place you hand against his chest to keep him and arms length \naway. You could feel Midoriya watching your every move. <i>This probably looks bad from Izuku\u2019s point of view&hellip;</i>\n</p><p>\n\u201cYeah, we\u2019re doing some one-on-one with them to train for the \nprovisional license exam.\u201d The boy looked out at the class he would be \ncompeting against, \u201cI believe I\u2019ll be training with the one you waved \nat. Is he your boyfriend or something?\u201d Shindou shot you a look with his\n last question.\n</p><p>\n\u201cUm, it\u2019s a bit complicated\u2014but he is a good friend\u201d You looked away \nnervously. Complicated didn\u2019t even begin to explain your relationship \nwith Midoriya.\n</p><p>\n\u201cAlright, class are you ready to have some fun!\u201d The famed hero Ms. Joke\n pumped her fist into the air. \u201cCome on, Aizawa, tell the students how \nmuch fun we\u2019re gonna have!!\u201d She nudged him with her elbow.\n</p><p>\nHis sleepy eyes looked over the sea of students, \u201cYou\u2019ve already been \ngiven your assignment. Take five minutes to introduce yourself to your \npartner then head to the training courts. Try not to kill each other. \nMs. Joke and I will watch from the sidelines.\u201d\n</p><p>\n\u201cGee, Aizawa, you\u2019re such a buzzkill! It\u2019s a wonder that I love you so~\u201d\n Ms. Joke chatted off Aizawa\u2019s ear as they walked towards the benches on\n the sidelines about how they should get married.\n</p><p>\nShindou had you giggling over a silly little trick he could do with his \nquirk you didn\u2019t even notice when Deku approached the two of you. He \ncleared his throat loudly, \u201cahem, hi there.. I\u2019m Midoriya.\u201d The green \nhaired boy stuck his hand out between you and Shindou for a shake.\n</p><p>\nShindou\u2019s eyes lit up. He took Midoriya\u2019s hand in the two of his, \u201cNice \nto meet you, Midoriya! I\u2019m Shindou! I saw you on TV. Your fighting style\n is really unique!\u201d Midoriya\u2019s face contorted with confusion for a \nmoment. He didn\u2019t expect his partner to be so&hellip; friendly. He almost \nfelt bad for being jealous.\n</p><p>\n\u201cSo, uh, Y/N,\u201d Midoriya looked to you, \u201cdo you know Shindou..?\u201d You looked into his puppy dog eyes. <i>Dammit.</i> A ping of guilt began to build up somewhere within. <i>I have no reason to feel guilty! We&rsquo;re not together&hellip; We&rsquo;re &lsquo;just friends.&rsquo; </i>\n</p><p>\n\u201cYeah, he\u2019s my ex-boyfriend&hellip;\u201d You looked down quickly as the words \nleft your mouth. The air was thick between the three of you.\n</p><p>\n \u201cOh? Ex-boyfriend&hellip; funny you\u2019ve never told me about him&hellip;\u201d \nMidoriya\u2019s voice probably still sounded happy to Shindou but you knew \nbetter. He was not happy with that new information.\n</p><p>\n\u201cMake your way to the courts.\u201d Aizawa ordered loudly. Groans surfaced \nthroughout the classes. The students slowly made their ways to the \ncourts. Shindou slung his arm around Midoriya. He stiffened at the \ntouch. \u201cLet\u2019s head out, buddy!\u201d Shindou had a smile plastered on his \nface as he dragged Midoriya to the court. \u00a0Before they were out of \nearshot, Shindou threw his head back to you, \u201cYou should stay and watch,\n Y/N!\u201d \u00a0He then leaned in to Midoriya and whispered something. (<i>\u201cListen\n I know you like her. But back off she\u2019s mine&hellip; We\u2019ve already dated \nbefore and I\u2019m sure she sees you as just a friend and nothing more.. I \nwanna cut you a deal though, if I win this fight. You have to let me \npursue her with no objections.\u201d</i>) Midoriya\u2019s confused face was replaced with one of determination. <i>Wonder what that was about..?</i>\n</p><p>\nYou sat at the bench closest to Midoriya and Shindou\u2019s court. Shindou \nhad a decent idea of how Midoriya was going to fight considering he \nwatched the Sports Festival. Midoriya had improved so much since then \nthough.\n</p><p>\n Shindou stared down the boy across from him. He had to be careful about\n how he was going to strike. There was no way to really focus his quirk \nunless&hellip;\n</p><p>\n Midoriya bolted at Shindou. Green lights flowed through his veins. He \nmoved so quickly you could hardly keep track as he bunny hopped around \nShindou. <i>What was he doing?</i>\n</p><p>\nShindou was equally confused. He held his fists at bay; his head whipped around following the after image of Midoriya. (<i>\u201cYou see.. while you were flirting it up with Y/N&hellip; I had some time to ask your classmates about your quirk.\u201d</i>)\n Just then, Midoriya landed a blow on Shindou\u2019s cheek. He stumbled back \nbefore regaining his balance. Midoriya was already back to his bunny \nhopping.\n</p><p>\nShindou closed his eyes. <i>You idiot. Why would you take your eyes off your opponent!</i> Midoriya saw this as an opening to give another hit. (<i>\u201cYou can\u2019t make a big quake because that will affect everyone out here and get your in trouble.. and if you can\u2019t grab me then\u2014\u201c</i>)\n Right before his fist landed, Shindou grabbed his wrist. Shindou\u2019s eyes\n darkened sinisterly. He threw Midoriya over his shoulder to the ground.\n</p><p>\nMidoriya\u2019s body ceased up. He turned over and retched. <i>Shindou must\u2019ve had used his quirk while he was flipping him.</i>\n Shindou loomed over the boy who continued to get sick. He kicked \nMidoriya in the ribs, causing you to flinch. Midoriya\u2019s head fell to the\n floor.\n</p><p>\n\u201cGive it up, kid.\u201d You heard Shindou spit out. His voice was seething with anger. <i>Where did that come from?</i> Midoriya struggled to lift himself up. Shindou kicked him again causing him to fall back to the ground. <i>That can\u2019t be allowed&hellip;</i> You looked for Aizawa. He was currently preoccupied with trying to keep the loud angry boy from killing his partner.\n</p><p>\nShindou placed his foot on Midoriya\u2019s back. He said something that you couldn\u2019t quite hear. (<i>\u201cWe\u2019re done here. Stay out of my way. Understand?\u201d</i>) Midoriya\u2019s body seemed to deflate as Shindou showed you his best smile, he then helped Midoriya off the floor.\n</p><p>\nShindou headed your way. Midoriya limped behind clutching his ribs. \nShindou reached out to give you a high five but you pushed past him to \naid Midoriya. \u201cHey, are you okay? Do we need to go to Recovery Girl?\u201d \nWorry riddled your voice.\n</p><p>\nMidoriya let out a shaky sigh, \u201cYeah, I think my ribs\u2014ah!\u201d He whimpered, pressing against his stomach.\n</p><p>\nYour eyes shot up to Shindou, \u201cwhy were you so rough! He\u2019s hurt really bad!\u201d\n</p><p>\n\u201cNo&hellip;no\u2014 Y/N,\u201d Midoriya\u2019s breath was labored, \u201cit\u2019s my fault. We made a\n bet&hellip; The stakes were high. I didn\u2019t want to give up. Our specific \ntraining instructions were to treat our opponents as if they were a \nvillain so.. he did exactly what he was supposed to.&ldquo;\n</p><p>\nYour eyes softened as you looked at the boy in pain. You looked back to \nShindou, \u201cwell&hellip; thanks for stopping when you did.. I know Midoriya is a\n bit hard headed&hellip; he doesn\u2019t like giving up.\u201d\n</p><p>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>Later, in Recovery Girls office.</b>\n</p><p>\nYou smiled as you approached the doorway. Midoriya and Shindou\u2019s \nlaughter filled the air. You stood in the door frame and watched for a \nbit before you announced yourself. Midoriya sat up in the hospital bed \npropped up by some pillows and Shindou sat at the foot of his bed.\n</p><p>\nShindou was telling Midoriya a story about a mucus villain he cane \nacross when he was doing his internship, \u201cit was so disgusting! I was \nliterally covered in snot! It was the stretchy kind too!\u201d He mimicked \nthe stretching between his hands. Midoriya laughed, \u201cThat\u2019s so gross!\u201d \nIt seemed like the two were finally getting along.\n</p><p>\n\u201cHey, guys.\u201d You softly brought their attention to you. Their mannerisms\n were quite similar when they saw you. They both adjusted their posture \nas they took in your appearance. Neither of them tried to hide the fact \nthey were checking you out.\n</p><p>\n\u201cYou look&hellip; beautiful.\u201d Shindou seemed to be flabbergasted by your \nappearance. Midoriya nodded in agreement. You whispered a \u2018thank you.\u2019\n</p><p>\n\u201cUm, yeah&hellip; my graduation is in like an hour&hellip; I came to bring you \nyour ticket, Izuku.\u201d Your heels tapped as you walked to the boy. \nShindou\u2019s eyes were heavy on your hips. Midoriya took the ticket from \nyour hand, \u201cthank you, Y/N! I\u2019ll be there!\u201d\n</p><p>\nYou turned to the black haired boy to your left and held out a ticket \nfor him as well, \u201cI had an extra.. I know you said you wanted to hang \nout&hellip; I know technically you wouldn\u2019t be hanging out with me but\u2014\u201c\n</p><p>\n\u201cI would love to go.\u201d Shindou took the ticket from your hand. His \nfingers brushed against yours momentarily. You felt a jolt rush through \nyour body. <i>Did he use his quirk on me again.. or was that just me?</i>\n</p><p>\nYou sighed happily, \u201cI have to go to the rehearsal, but I\u2019m glad to see \nyou guys getting along! I knew the two of you could be good friends.\u201d \nYou patted their shoulders simultaneously before hopping out of the \nroom. As the door clicked behind you, there was a hushed whisper\u2014but you\n didn\u2019t think too much of it.\n</p><p>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(<i>\u201cWe are -not- friends.\u201d</i>)\n</p>",

He nodded again and grabbed your hand, \u201cya know, \nI\u2019m a little disappointed that you deleted my number and also,\u201d his \nfeatures darkened with a playful smirk as he stepped closer, \u201cit\u2019s not \npolite to point.\u201d He winked at you and a surge pulsed through your body \ncausing your stomach to flip.</p><p>Your knees felt weak; you grabbed on to him for support. \u201cShindou, \nwhat the hell was that!\u201d You muttered looking up at the boy. \u201cMy quirk. \nIt\u2019s improved wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d He held you close, providing the \nbalance you needed. Improved was an understatement. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your turn to get your tickets,\u201d he pointed you towards the \nticket lady. She made you sign a few papers and then gave you an \nenvelope with tickets. You decided that you would walk Shindou back to \nhis class so the two of you could catch up.</p><p>As you and Shindou walked, the two of you talked about everything you\n could think of. It felt like the two of you had never been apart. You \nglanced into the envelope at your graduation tickets as Shindou told you\n about his latest adventure. <i>One extra\u2026 should I give it to him?</i> You glanced at Shindou. His eyes crinkled with his smile as he explained his story. <i>So cute..</i></p><p>\u201cOh, so now you\u2019re staring? Really, Y/N, what happened to your \nmanners!\u201d Shindou grinned down at you. You blushed slightly, looking \naway quickly. He stopped abruptly. You stopped as well\u2014trying to avoid \neye contact. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I like when you look at me.\u201d He tilted your \nhead towards him. </p><p>Your cheeks burned as you made eye contact with him, \u201cI, uh, I like looking at you..\u201d <i>God, that sounded so dumb. Way to be smooth, Y/N.</i> He leaned in close to you, \u201cyou know, I really do miss you..\u201d </p><p>\u201cI-i missed you too,\u201d Your eyes fluttered to his lips. <i>He was so close\u2026you could just\u2014</i></p><p>\u201cIs that Y/N!!! Who is she with! Midoriya do you know that guy?! He kinda looks like you but hotter!!\u201d</p><p>\n \u00a0<i>Izuku!</i>\n</p><p>You stepped back from Shindou quickly and searched for the owner of \nthe voice. It was that yellow haired boy from the party. He was pointing\n right at you and Shindou. <i>Oh no.</i> Your eyes scanned the crowd of underclassmen in their hero suits and you quickly found the hero Deku. </p><p>\nHis eyes were already glued to the tall boy standing next to you. They \nfluttered to you. His stare was cold. You gave him a small wave. He \nforced a small smile. You cringed in the inside. He definitely saw that \nShindou was just trying to make a move of you.\n</p><p>\n \u201cWell, this is my stop!\u201d Shindou smiled and gave your head a small pat.\n He stepped a bit closer to you, trying to recreate that opening from \nbefore.\n</p><p>\n\u201cWait\u2026 you\u2019re training with class 1-A.\u201d You raised an eyebrow at the \nboy. You place you hand against his chest to keep him and arms length \naway. You could feel Midoriya watching your every move. <i>This probably looks bad from Izuku\u2019s point of view\u2026</i>\n</p><p>\n\u201cYeah, we\u2019re doing some one-on-one with them to train for the \nprovisional license exam.\u201d The boy looked out at the class he would be \ncompeting against, \u201cI believe I\u2019ll be training with the one you waved \nat. Is he your boyfriend or something?\u201d Shindou shot you a look with his\n last question.\n</p><p>\n\u201cUm, it\u2019s a bit complicated\u2014but he is a good friend\u201d You looked away \nnervously. Complicated didn\u2019t even begin to explain your relationship \nwith Midoriya.\n</p><p>\n\u201cAlright, class are you ready to have some fun!\u201d The famed hero Ms. Joke\n pumped her fist into the air. \u201cCome on, Aizawa, tell the students how \nmuch fun we\u2019re gonna have!!\u201d She nudged him with her elbow.\n</p><p>\nHis sleepy eyes looked over the sea of students, \u201cYou\u2019ve already been \ngiven your assignment. Take five minutes to introduce yourself to your \npartner then head to the training courts. Try not to kill each other. \nMs. Joke and I will watch from the sidelines.\u201d\n</p><p>\n\u201cGee, Aizawa, you\u2019re such a buzzkill! It\u2019s a wonder that I love you so~\u201d\n Ms. Joke chatted off Aizawa\u2019s ear as they walked towards the benches on\n the sidelines about how they should get married.\n</p><p>\nShindou had you giggling over a silly little trick he could do with his \nquirk you didn\u2019t even notice when Deku approached the two of you. He \ncleared his throat loudly, \u201cahem, hi there.. I\u2019m Midoriya.\u201d The green \nhaired boy stuck his hand out between you and Shindou for a shake.\n</p><p>\nShindou\u2019s eyes lit up. He took Midoriya\u2019s hand in the two of his, \u201cNice \nto meet you, Midoriya! I\u2019m Shindou! I saw you on TV. Your fighting style\n is really unique!\u201d Midoriya\u2019s face contorted with confusion for a \nmoment. He didn\u2019t expect his partner to be so\u2026 friendly. He almost \nfelt bad for being jealous.\n</p><p>\n\u201cSo, uh, Y/N,\u201d Midoriya looked to you, \u201cdo you know Shindou..?\u201d You looked into his puppy dog eyes. <i>Dammit.</i> A ping of guilt began to build up somewhere within. <i>I have no reason to feel guilty! We\u2019re not together\u2026 We\u2019re \u2018just friends.\u2019 </i>\n</p><p>\n\u201cYeah, he\u2019s my ex-boyfriend\u2026\u201d You looked down quickly as the words \nleft your mouth. The air was thick between the three of you.\n</p><p>\n \u201cOh? Ex-boyfriend\u2026 funny you\u2019ve never told me about him\u2026\u201d \nMidoriya\u2019s voice probably still sounded happy to Shindou but you knew \nbetter. He was not happy with that new information.\n</p><p>\n\u201cMake your way to the courts.\u201d Aizawa ordered loudly. Groans surfaced \nthroughout the classes. The students slowly made their ways to the \ncourts. Shindou slung his arm around Midoriya. He stiffened at the \ntouch. \u201cLet\u2019s head out, buddy!\u201d Shindou had a smile plastered on his \nface as he dragged Midoriya to the court. \u00a0Before they were out of \nearshot, Shindou threw his head back to you, \u201cYou should stay and watch,\n Y/N!\u201d \u00a0He then leaned in to Midoriya and whispered something. (<i>\u201cListen\n I know you like her. But back off she\u2019s mine\u2026 We\u2019ve already dated \nbefore and I\u2019m sure she sees you as just a friend and nothing more.. I \nwanna cut you a deal though, if I win this fight. You have to let me \npursue her with no objections.\u201d</i>) Midoriya\u2019s confused face was replaced with one of determination. <i>Wonder what that was about..?</i>\n</p><p>\nYou sat at the bench closest to Midoriya and Shindou\u2019s court. Shindou \nhad a decent idea of how Midoriya was going to fight considering he \nwatched the Sports Festival. Midoriya had improved so much since then \nthough.\n</p><p>\n Shindou stared down the boy across from him. He had to be careful about\n how he was going to strike. There was no way to really focus his quirk \nunless\u2026\n</p><p>\n Midoriya bolted at Shindou. Green lights flowed through his veins. He \nmoved so quickly you could hardly keep track as he bunny hopped around \nShindou. <i>What was he doing?</i>\n</p><p>\nShindou was equally confused. He held his fists at bay; his head whipped around following the after image of Midoriya. (<i>\u201cYou see.. while you were flirting it up with Y/N\u2026 I had some time to ask your classmates about your quirk.\u201d</i>)\n Just then, Midoriya landed a blow on Shindou\u2019s cheek. He stumbled back \nbefore regaining his balance. Midoriya was already back to his bunny \nhopping.\n</p><p>\nShindou closed his eyes. <i>You idiot. Why would you take your eyes off your opponent!</i> Midoriya saw this as an opening to give another hit. (<i>\u201cYou can\u2019t make a big quake because that will affect everyone out here and get your in trouble.. and if you can\u2019t grab me then\u2014\u201c</i>)\n Right before his fist landed, Shindou grabbed his wrist. Shindou\u2019s eyes\n darkened sinisterly. He threw Midoriya over his shoulder to the ground.\n</p><p>\nMidoriya\u2019s body ceased up. He turned over and retched. <i>Shindou must\u2019ve had used his quirk while he was flipping him.</i>\n Shindou loomed over the boy who continued to get sick. He kicked \nMidoriya in the ribs, causing you to flinch. Midoriya\u2019s head fell to the\n floor.\n</p><p>\n\u201cGive it up, kid.\u201d You heard Shindou spit out. His voice was seething with anger. <i>Where did that come from?</i> Midoriya struggled to lift himself up. Shindou kicked him again causing him to fall back to the ground. <i>That can\u2019t be allowed\u2026</i> You looked for Aizawa. He was currently preoccupied with trying to keep the loud angry boy from killing his partner.\n</p><p>\nShindou placed his foot on Midoriya\u2019s back. He said something that you couldn\u2019t quite hear. (<i>\u201cWe\u2019re done here. Stay out of my way. Understand?\u201d</i>) Midoriya\u2019s body seemed to deflate as Shindou showed you his best smile, he then helped Midoriya off the floor.\n</p><p>\nShindou headed your way. Midoriya limped behind clutching his ribs. \nShindou reached out to give you a high five but you pushed past him to \naid Midoriya. \u201cHey, are you okay? Do we need to go to Recovery Girl?\u201d \nWorry riddled your voice.\n</p><p>\nMidoriya let out a shaky sigh, \u201cYeah, I think my ribs\u2014ah!\u201d He whimpered, pressing against his stomach.\n</p><p>\nYour eyes shot up to Shindou, \u201cwhy were you so rough! He\u2019s hurt really bad!\u201d\n</p><p>\n\u201cNo\u2026no\u2014 Y/N,\u201d Midoriya\u2019s breath was labored, \u201cit\u2019s my fault. We made a\n bet\u2026 The stakes were high. I didn\u2019t want to give up. Our specific \ntraining instructions were to treat our opponents as if they were a \nvillain so.. he did exactly what he was supposed to.\u201c\n</p><p>\nYour eyes softened as you looked at the boy in pain. You looked back to \nShindou, \u201cwell\u2026 thanks for stopping when you did.. I know Midoriya is a\n bit hard headed\u2026 he doesn\u2019t like giving up.\u201d\n</p><p>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>Later, in Recovery Girls office.</b>\n</p><p>\nYou smiled as you approached the doorway. Midoriya and Shindou\u2019s \nlaughter filled the air. You stood in the door frame and watched for a \nbit before you announced yourself. Midoriya sat up in the hospital bed \npropped up by some pillows and Shindou sat at the foot of his bed.\n</p><p>\nShindou was telling Midoriya a story about a mucus villain he cane \nacross when he was doing his internship, \u201cit was so disgusting! I was \nliterally covered in snot! It was the stretchy kind too!\u201d He mimicked \nthe stretching between his hands. Midoriya laughed, \u201cThat\u2019s so gross!\u201d \nIt seemed like the two were finally getting along.\n</p><p>\n\u201cHey, guys.\u201d You softly brought their attention to you. Their mannerisms\n were quite similar when they saw you. They both adjusted their posture \nas they took in your appearance. Neither of them tried to hide the fact \nthey were checking you out.\n</p><p>\n\u201cYou look\u2026 beautiful.\u201d Shindou seemed to be flabbergasted by your \nappearance. Midoriya nodded in agreement. You whispered a \u2018thank you.\u2019\n</p><p>\n\u201cUm, yeah\u2026 my graduation is in like an hour\u2026 I came to bring you \nyour ticket, Izuku.\u201d Your heels tapped as you walked to the boy. \nShindou\u2019s eyes were heavy on your hips. Midoriya took the ticket from \nyour hand, \u201cthank you, Y/N! I\u2019ll be there!\u201d\n</p><p>\nYou turned to the black haired boy to your left and held out a ticket \nfor him as well, \u201cI had an extra.. I know you said you wanted to hang \nout\u2026 I know technically you wouldn\u2019t be hanging out with me but\u2014\u201c\n</p><p>\n\u201cI would love to go.\u201d Shindou took the ticket from your hand. His \nfingers brushed against yours momentarily. You felt a jolt rush through \nyour body. <i>Did he use his quirk on me again.. or was that just me?</i>\n</p><p>\nYou sighed happily, \u201cI have to go to the rehearsal, but I\u2019m glad to see \nyou guys getting along! I knew the two of you could be good friends.\u201d \nYou patted their shoulders simultaneously before hopping out of the \nroom. As the door clicked behind you, there was a hushed whisper\u2014but you\n didn\u2019t think too much of it.\n</p><p>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(<i>\u201cWe are -not- friends.\u201d</i>)\n</p></p>",

Summer break, of course! And on top of that you were graduating! \nYou stood in line to get the tickets. You nervously went over the \ndetails in your head. <i>I\u2019ll need one ticket for my mom and dad\u2026 One for my aunt. Umm.. Izuku would probably want to come.. so that\u2019s four..</i></p><p>Ding! </p><p>\n \u00a0<i>X: saw you at Mirio\u2019s party last weekend\u2026 reminded me of some good times we used to have! we should hang out sometime.</i>\n</p><p>\n \u00a0<i>X: btw, you look really cute today..</i>\n</p><p>You glanced at the messages on your phone screen. Your heartbeat \nquickened as you scanned your surroundings. Nothing looked out of the \nordinary. Your fingers fumbled to type out your message. </p><p>Y/N: who is this? </p><p>The next message came immediately. </p><p>\n \u00a0<i>X: take a wild guess, sweetheart. </i>\n</p><p>You had absolutely no clue. You looked up into the sea of people with a frown on your face. <i>Who was the mystery person? They had to be somewhere near you. </i></p><p>You felt an accidental shove from one of the students behind you \ncausing you to trip over a raised piece of concrete. Your body couldn\u2019t \nreact quick enough. The ground was coming closer to your face. You \nbraced for your stony face plant</p><p>Two strong arms wrapped around you. You were lifted back up with \nease. \u201cFalling for me all over again?\u201d The voice chuckled from behind \nyou. <i>That voice. I know that voice.</i> You turned to greet your savior. <br></p>[[MORE]]<p>\n \u00a0<i>Shindou.</i>\n</p><p>He smiled down at you, \u201cDid you miss me?\u201d You couldn\u2019t begin to form a sentence. You mind raced. <i>Why\n is he here? How did he find me? Why is he in his hero outfit? He looks \nso much taller now. And so much more.. muscular. Why did we break up \nagain?</i> \u201cW-why are you\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cWhy am I here? Good question! Well, you see, Ketsubutsu\u2019s 2nd years \nwere doing some training. Our training partners were taking a while to \nget ready so I excused myself to use the restroom and decided to see \nwhat all this commotion was about. And then I saw your pretty little \nface and I sent you a text.\u201d </p><p>It took you a minute to wrap your brain around what he just told you.\n \u201cSo you\u2019re the mystery number person?\u201d You pointed a finger at him. He \nnodded. </p><p>\u201cAnd you went to Mirio\u2019s party last weekend?\u201d Your finger was still \nextended towards him. He nodded again and grabbed your hand, \u201cya know, \nI\u2019m a little disappointed that you deleted my number and also,\u201d his \nfeatures darkened with a playful smirk as he stepped closer, \u201cit\u2019s not \npolite to point.\u201d He winked at you and a surge pulsed through your body \ncausing your stomach to flip.</p><p>Your knees felt weak; you grabbed on to him for support. \u201cShindou, \nwhat the hell was that!\u201d You muttered looking up at the boy. \u201cMy quirk. \nIt\u2019s improved wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d He held you close, providing the \nbalance you needed. Improved was an understatement. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your turn to get your tickets,\u201d he pointed you towards the \nticket lady. She made you sign a few papers and then gave you an \nenvelope with tickets. You decided that you would walk Shindou back to \nhis class so the two of you could catch up.</p><p>As you and Shindou walked, the two of you talked about everything you\n could think of. It felt like the two of you had never been apart. You \nglanced into the envelope at your graduation tickets as Shindou told you\n about his latest adventure. <i>One extra\u2026 should I give it to him?</i> You glanced at Shindou. His eyes crinkled with his smile as he explained his story. <i>So cute..</i></p><p>\u201cOh, so now you\u2019re staring? Really, Y/N, what happened to your \nmanners!\u201d Shindou grinned down at you. You blushed slightly, looking \naway quickly. He stopped abruptly. You stopped as well\u2014trying to avoid \neye contact. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I like when you look at me.\u201d He tilted your \nhead towards him. </p><p>Your cheeks burned as you made eye contact with him, \u201cI, uh, I like looking at you..\u201d <i>God, that sounded so dumb. Way to be smooth, Y/N.</i> He leaned in close to you, \u201cyou know, I really do miss you..\u201d </p><p>\u201cI-i missed you too,\u201d Your eyes fluttered to his lips. <i>He was so close\u2026you could just\u2014</i></p><p>\u201cIs that Y/N!!! Who is she with! Midoriya do you know that guy?! He kinda looks like you but hotter!!\u201d</p><p>\n \u00a0<i>Izuku!</i>\n</p><p>You stepped back from Shindou quickly and searched for the owner of \nthe voice. It was that yellow haired boy from the party. He was pointing\n right at you and Shindou. <i>Oh no.</i> Your eyes scanned the crowd of underclassmen in their hero suits and you quickly found the hero Deku. </p><p>\nHis eyes were already glued to the tall boy standing next to you. They \nfluttered to you. His stare was cold. You gave him a small wave. He \nforced a small smile. You cringed in the inside. He definitely saw that \nShindou was just trying to make a move of you.\n</p><p>\n \u201cWell, this is my stop!\u201d Shindou smiled and gave your head a small pat.\n He stepped a bit closer to you, trying to recreate that opening from \nbefore.\n</p><p>\n\u201cWait\u2026 you\u2019re training with class 1-A.\u201d You raised an eyebrow at the \nboy. You place you hand against his chest to keep him and arms length \naway. You could feel Midoriya watching your every move. <i>This probably looks bad from Izuku\u2019s point of view\u2026</i>\n</p><p>\n\u201cYeah, we\u2019re doing some one-on-one with them to train for the \nprovisional license exam.\u201d The boy looked out at the class he would be \ncompeting against, \u201cI believe I\u2019ll be training with the one you waved \nat. Is he your boyfriend or something?\u201d Shindou shot you a look with his\n last question.\n</p><p>\n\u201cUm, it\u2019s a bit complicated\u2014but he is a good friend\u201d You looked away \nnervously. Complicated didn\u2019t even begin to explain your relationship \nwith Midoriya.\n</p><p>\n\u201cAlright, class are you ready to have some fun!\u201d The famed hero Ms. Joke\n pumped her fist into the air. \u201cCome on, Aizawa, tell the students how \nmuch fun we\u2019re gonna have!!\u201d She nudged him with her elbow.\n</p><p>\nHis sleepy eyes looked over the sea of students, \u201cYou\u2019ve already been \ngiven your assignment. Take five minutes to introduce yourself to your \npartner then head to the training courts. Try not to kill each other. \nMs. Joke and I will watch from the sidelines.\u201d\n</p><p>\n\u201cGee, Aizawa, you\u2019re such a buzzkill! It\u2019s a wonder that I love you so~\u201d\n Ms. Joke chatted off Aizawa\u2019s ear as they walked towards the benches on\n the sidelines about how they should get married.\n</p><p>\nShindou had you giggling over a silly little trick he could do with his \nquirk you didn\u2019t even notice when Deku approached the two of you. He \ncleared his throat loudly, \u201cahem, hi there.. I\u2019m Midoriya.\u201d The green \nhaired boy stuck his hand out between you and Shindou for a shake.\n</p><p>\nShindou\u2019s eyes lit up. He took Midoriya\u2019s hand in the two of his, \u201cNice \nto meet you, Midoriya! I\u2019m Shindou! I saw you on TV. Your fighting style\n is really unique!\u201d Midoriya\u2019s face contorted with confusion for a \nmoment. He didn\u2019t expect his partner to be so\u2026 friendly. He almost \nfelt bad for being jealous.\n</p><p>\n\u201cSo, uh, Y/N,\u201d Midoriya looked to you, \u201cdo you know Shindou..?\u201d You looked into his puppy dog eyes. <i>Dammit.</i> A ping of guilt began to build up somewhere within. <i>I have no reason to feel guilty! We\u2019re not together\u2026 We\u2019re \u2018just friends.\u2019 </i>\n</p><p>\n\u201cYeah, he\u2019s my ex-boyfriend\u2026\u201d You looked down quickly as the words \nleft your mouth. The air was thick between the three of you.\n</p><p>\n \u201cOh? Ex-boyfriend\u2026 funny you\u2019ve never told me about him\u2026\u201d \nMidoriya\u2019s voice probably still sounded happy to Shindou but you knew \nbetter. He was not happy with that new information.\n</p><p>\n\u201cMake your way to the courts.\u201d Aizawa ordered loudly. Groans surfaced \nthroughout the classes. The students slowly made their ways to the \ncourts. Shindou slung his arm around Midoriya. He stiffened at the \ntouch. \u201cLet\u2019s head out, buddy!\u201d Shindou had a smile plastered on his \nface as he dragged Midoriya to the court. \u00a0Before they were out of \nearshot, Shindou threw his head back to you, \u201cYou should stay and watch,\n Y/N!\u201d \u00a0He then leaned in to Midoriya and whispered something. (<i>\u201cListen\n I know you like her. But back off she\u2019s mine\u2026 We\u2019ve already dated \nbefore and I\u2019m sure she sees you as just a friend and nothing more.. I \nwanna cut you a deal though, if I win this fight. You have to let me \npursue her with no objections.\u201d</i>) Midoriya\u2019s confused face was replaced with one of determination. <i>Wonder what that was about..?</i>\n</p><p>\nYou sat at the bench closest to Midoriya and Shindou\u2019s court. Shindou \nhad a decent idea of how Midoriya was going to fight considering he \nwatched the Sports Festival. Midoriya had improved so much since then \nthough.\n</p><p>\n Shindou stared down the boy across from him. He had to be careful about\n how he was going to strike. There was no way to really focus his quirk \nunless\u2026\n</p><p>\n Midoriya bolted at Shindou. Green lights flowed through his veins. He \nmoved so quickly you could hardly keep track as he bunny hopped around \nShindou. <i>What was he doing?</i>\n</p><p>\nShindou was equally confused. He held his fists at bay; his head whipped around following the after image of Midoriya. (<i>\u201cYou see.. while you were flirting it up with Y/N\u2026 I had some time to ask your classmates about your quirk.\u201d</i>)\n Just then, Midoriya landed a blow on Shindou\u2019s cheek. He stumbled back \nbefore regaining his balance. Midoriya was already back to his bunny \nhopping.\n</p><p>\nShindou closed his eyes. <i>You idiot. Why would you take your eyes off your opponent!</i> Midoriya saw this as an opening to give another hit. (<i>\u201cYou can\u2019t make a big quake because that will affect everyone out here and get your in trouble.. and if you can\u2019t grab me then\u2014\u201c</i>)\n Right before his fist landed, Shindou grabbed his wrist. Shindou\u2019s eyes\n darkened sinisterly. He threw Midoriya over his shoulder to the ground.\n</p><p>\nMidoriya\u2019s body ceased up. He turned over and retched. <i>Shindou must\u2019ve had used his quirk while he was flipping him.</i>\n Shindou loomed over the boy who continued to get sick. He kicked \nMidoriya in the ribs, causing you to flinch. Midoriya\u2019s head fell to the\n floor.\n</p><p>\n\u201cGive it up, kid.\u201d You heard Shindou spit out. His voice was seething with anger. <i>Where did that come from?</i> Midoriya struggled to lift himself up. Shindou kicked him again causing him to fall back to the ground. <i>That can\u2019t be allowed\u2026</i> You looked for Aizawa. He was currently preoccupied with trying to keep the loud angry boy from killing his partner.\n</p><p>\nShindou placed his foot on Midoriya\u2019s back. He said something that you couldn\u2019t quite hear. (<i>\u201cWe\u2019re done here. Stay out of my way. Understand?\u201d</i>) Midoriya\u2019s body seemed to deflate as Shindou showed you his best smile, he then helped Midoriya off the floor.\n</p><p>\nShindou headed your way. Midoriya limped behind clutching his ribs. \nShindou reached out to give you a high five but you pushed past him to \naid Midoriya. \u201cHey, are you okay? Do we need to go to Recovery Girl?\u201d \nWorry riddled your voice.\n</p><p>\nMidoriya let out a shaky sigh, \u201cYeah, I think my ribs\u2014ah!\u201d He whimpered, pressing against his stomach.\n</p><p>\nYour eyes shot up to Shindou, \u201cwhy were you so rough! He\u2019s hurt really bad!\u201d\n</p><p>\n\u201cNo\u2026no\u2014 Y/N,\u201d Midoriya\u2019s breath was labored, \u201cit\u2019s my fault. We made a\n bet\u2026 The stakes were high. I didn\u2019t want to give up. Our specific \ntraining instructions were to treat our opponents as if they were a \nvillain so.. he did exactly what he was supposed to.\u201c\n</p><p>\nYour eyes softened as you looked at the boy in pain. You looked back to \nShindou, \u201cwell\u2026 thanks for stopping when you did.. I know Midoriya is a\n bit hard headed\u2026 he doesn\u2019t like giving up.\u201d\n</p><p>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>Later, in Recovery Girls office.</b>\n</p><p>\nYou smiled as you approached the doorway. Midoriya and Shindou\u2019s \nlaughter filled the air. You stood in the door frame and watched for a \nbit before you announced yourself. Midoriya sat up in the hospital bed \npropped up by some pillows and Shindou sat at the foot of his bed.\n</p><p>\nShindou was telling Midoriya a story about a mucus villain he cane \nacross when he was doing his internship, \u201cit was so disgusting! I was \nliterally covered in snot! It was the stretchy kind too!\u201d He mimicked \nthe stretching between his hands. Midoriya laughed, \u201cThat\u2019s so gross!\u201d \nIt seemed like the two were finally getting along.\n</p><p>\n\u201cHey, guys.\u201d You softly brought their attention to you. Their mannerisms\n were quite similar when they saw you. They both adjusted their posture \nas they took in your appearance. Neither of them tried to hide the fact \nthey were checking you out.\n</p><p>\n\u201cYou look\u2026 beautiful.\u201d Shindou seemed to be flabbergasted by your \nappearance. Midoriya nodded in agreement. You whispered a \u2018thank you.\u2019\n</p><p>\n\u201cUm, yeah\u2026 my graduation is in like an hour\u2026 I came to bring you \nyour ticket, Izuku.\u201d Your heels tapped as you walked to the boy. \nShindou\u2019s eyes were heavy on your hips. Midoriya took the ticket from \nyour hand, \u201cthank you, Y/N! I\u2019ll be there!\u201d\n</p><p>\nYou turned to the black haired boy to your left and held out a ticket \nfor him as well, \u201cI had an extra.. I know you said you wanted to hang \nout\u2026 I know technically you wouldn\u2019t be hanging out with me but\u2014\u201c\n</p><p>\n\u201cI would love to go.\u201d Shindou took the ticket from your hand. His \nfingers brushed against yours momentarily. You felt a jolt rush through \nyour body. <i>Did he use his quirk on me again.. or was that just me?</i>\n</p><p>\nYou sighed happily, \u201cI have to go to the rehearsal, but I\u2019m glad to see \nyou guys getting along! I knew the two of you could be good friends.\u201d \nYou patted their shoulders simultaneously before hopping out of the \nroom. As the door clicked behind you, there was a hushed whisper\u2014but you\n didn\u2019t think too much of it.\n</p><p>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(<i>\u201cWe are -not- friends.\u201d</i>)\n</p></p>",

Summer break, of course! And on top of that you were graduating! \nYou stood in line to get the tickets. You nervously went over the \ndetails in your head. <i>I&rsquo;ll need one ticket for my mom and dad&hellip; One for my aunt. Umm.. Izuku would probably want to come.. so that&rsquo;s four..</i></p><p>Ding! </p><p>\n &nbsp;<i>X: saw you at Mirio&rsquo;s party last weekend&hellip; reminded me of some good times we used to have! we should hang out sometime.</i>\n</p><p>\n &nbsp;<i>X: btw, you look really cute today..</i>\n</p><p>You glanced at the messages on your phone screen. Your heartbeat \nquickened as you scanned your surroundings. Nothing looked out of the \nordinary. Your fingers fumbled to type out your message. </p><p>Y/N: who is this? </p><p>The next message came immediately. </p><p>\n &nbsp;<i>X: take a wild guess, sweetheart. </i>\n</p><p>You had absolutely no clue. You looked up into the sea of people with a frown on your face. <i>Who was the mystery person? They had to be somewhere near you. </i></p><p>You felt an accidental shove from one of the students behind you \ncausing you to trip over a raised piece of concrete. Your body couldn&rsquo;t \nreact quick enough. The ground was coming closer to your face. You \nbraced for your stony face plant</p><p>Two strong arms wrapped around you. You were lifted back up with \nease. &ldquo;Falling for me all over again?&rdquo; The voice chuckled from behind \nyou. <i>That voice. I know that voice.</i> You turned to greet your savior. <br /></p><p>\n &nbsp;<i>Shindou.</i>\n</p><p>He smiled down at you, &ldquo;Did you miss me?&rdquo; You couldn&rsquo;t begin to form a sentence. You mind raced. <i>Why\n is he here? How did he find me? Why is he in his hero outfit? He looks \nso much taller now. And so much more.. muscular. Why did we break up \nagain?</i> &ldquo;W-why are you&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why am I here? Good question! Well, you see, Ketsubutsu&rsquo;s 2nd years \nwere doing some training. Our training partners were taking a while to \nget ready so I excused myself to use the restroom and decided to see \nwhat all this commotion was about. And then I saw your pretty little \nface and I sent you a text.&rdquo; </p><p>It took you a minute to wrap your brain around what he just told you.\n &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re the mystery number person?&rdquo; You pointed a finger at him. He \nnodded. </p><p>&ldquo;And you went to Mirio&rsquo;s party last weekend?&rdquo; Your finger was still \nextended towards him. He nodded again and grabbed your hand, &ldquo;ya know, \nI&rsquo;m a little disappointed that you deleted my number and also,&rdquo; his \nfeatures darkened with a playful smirk as he stepped closer, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not \npolite to point.&rdquo; He winked at you and a surge pulsed through your body \ncausing your stomach to flip.</p><p>Your knees felt weak; you grabbed on to him for support. &ldquo;Shindou, \nwhat the hell was that!&rdquo; You muttered looking up at the boy. &ldquo;My quirk. \nIt&rsquo;s improved wouldn&rsquo;t you say?&rdquo; He held you close, providing the \nbalance you needed. Improved was an understatement. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your turn to get your tickets,&rdquo; he pointed you towards the \nticket lady. She made you sign a few papers and then gave you an \nenvelope with tickets. You decided that you would walk Shindou back to \nhis class so the two of you could catch up.</p><p>As you and Shindou walked, the two of you talked about everything you\n could think of. It felt like the two of you had never been apart. You \nglanced into the envelope at your graduation tickets as Shindou told you\n about his latest adventure. <i>One extra&hellip; should I give it to him?</i> You glanced at Shindou. His eyes crinkled with his smile as he explained his story. <i>So cute..</i></p><p>&ldquo;Oh, so now you&rsquo;re staring? Really, Y/N, what happened to your \nmanners!&rdquo; Shindou grinned down at you. You blushed slightly, looking \naway quickly. He stopped abruptly. You stopped as well&mdash;trying to avoid \neye contact. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I like when you look at me.&rdquo; He tilted your \nhead towards him. </p><p>Your cheeks burned as you made eye contact with him, &ldquo;I, uh, I like looking at you..&rdquo; <i>God, that sounded so dumb. Way to be smooth, Y/N.</i> He leaned in close to you, &ldquo;you know, I really do miss you..&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I-i missed you too,&rdquo; Your eyes fluttered to his lips. <i>He was so close&hellip;you could just&mdash;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Is that Y/N!!! Who is she with! Midoriya do you know that guy?! He kinda looks like you but hotter!!&rdquo;</p><p>\n &nbsp;<i>Izuku!</i>\n</p><p>You stepped back from Shindou quickly and searched for the owner of \nthe voice. It was that yellow haired boy from the party. He was pointing\n right at you and Shindou. <i>Oh no.</i> Your eyes scanned the crowd of underclassmen in their hero suits and you quickly found the hero Deku. </p><p>\nHis eyes were already glued to the tall boy standing next to you. They \nfluttered to you. His stare was cold. You gave him a small wave. He \nforced a small smile. You cringed in the inside. He definitely saw that \nShindou was just trying to make a move of you.\n</p><p>\n &ldquo;Well, this is my stop!&rdquo; Shindou smiled and gave your head a small pat.\n He stepped a bit closer to you, trying to recreate that opening from \nbefore.\n</p><p>\n&ldquo;Wait&hellip; you&rsquo;re training with class 1-A.&rdquo; You raised an eyebrow at the \nboy.
