Since 1973 (at least), he was the man with the plan, and led the lower orders of demons with the eventual goal of freeing Lucifer from Hell. They shared his vision, but that\u2019s only a small part of why they followed him. Mainly, it was because he was powerful. The only reason demons will follow a leader is they\u2019re scared not to.

However, as a civil war played out in Heaven, Hell had no such problems. Obviously, the next in line to rule would be Ramiel, the second-oldest Prince of Hell. Yet when Crowley offered Ramiel the throne, he turned it down. Whaat? In a show of unorthodox behavior, Ramiel turned the kingship over to Crowley. With all the living princes, plus Cain, uninterested, Crowley took the opportunity to seize the throne. Crowley\u2019s problem was he just wasn\u2019t\u00a0scary enough to legitimize himself. He was always going to have issues holding onto his throne, and that\u2019s why he went to such lengths to open Purgatory with Cas in Season 6. Abbadon and even Deanmon had more legitimate claims to Hell\u2019s throne than he did.\u00a0</p><p>When Crowley almost got cured in <i>Sacrifice</i>, his character fundamentally changed, much to the detriment of Hell. But even before his pivot, Crowley wasn\u2019t the kind of leader Hell needed. Demons were designed to be a disposable army, not a bureaucracy. Crossroads Demons have their place in Hell, but not every demon is meant to be a Crossroads Demon. It made sense that Sam and Dean saw Abaddon as the much larger threat, because she was. Who\u2019s more likely to lead Hell back to its former glory, a bored bureaucrat or a mad general? If Crowley had never come into power, the demons would have had to spend only a few years in chaos before Abaddon arrived to take her place as queen (provided Sam and Dean didn\u2019t manage to kill her). If they had, would demons simply be running around freely as in early Season 3? I don\u2019t think that would have been worse (for Hell) than them hanging around Hell bored out of their minds, dreaming up ways to double-cross Crowley. From sentimentally saving Cas in <i>Stuck in the Middle (With You)</i> to promising to shut the gates of Hell forever, Crowley left an awesome legacy, but not one that benefited his own kind.\u00a0</p><p>On the other hand, Crowley could have been demons\u2019 savior.</p><p>Remember when he said in Season 5 that after Lucifer won the war against Heaven he would kill all the demons? That\u2019s a good guess. If Lucifer can ever be said to be happy, it\u2019s when he\u2019s around his closest kin\u2014the other archangels, his dad, Jack. Humans are \u201cbroken, flawed abortions,\u201d and once-human demons are if anything worse. Lucifer doesn\u2019t care about them.\u00a0</p><p>So did Crowley play an appreciable role in stopping Lucifer\u2019s victory in Season 5? Yes. If he hadn\u2019t given Sam and Dean the Colt, they probably would have gone on a lengthly wild-goose-chase looking for it as in <i>The End</i>. Crowley was also invaluable when it came to finding the Four Horsemen. Well, two of them, anyway. When time was of the essence, Sam, Dean, and Bobby didn\u2019t know where to start looking for them.

A/C.\u00a0</i></b>Just some domestic sweetness. Aziraphale isn&rsquo;t good with children, not like Crowley is, like Crowley always has been.\u00a0</i></b><b><i>But he tries his best.</i></b></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s alright, just like that,\u201d Crowley\nsaid, smiling as he leaned back, and Aziraphale kept his book loosely in his\nlap as he watched Crowley work. Liam had his arms outstretched as he walked\nslowly along the bar, his gaze forward. \u201cNo, no, see, you\u2019re going on your\ntiptoes again \u2013 you don\u2019t need to. You\u2019ve got the whole of your sole to help\nyou balance, lad, so your toes <i>and</i>\nyour heel\u2026 That\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you do it so fast?\u201d Liam demanded,\nand he stumbled, but Crowley moved to catch him by the hand before he could tip\ntoo far the other way, letting him catch his balance again. </p><p>The children had been watching Crowley fix\nsome of the tiling on the Halifax family\u2019s roof on the other side of\nChesterton-Burnleigh, and they\u2019d been mystified by the way Crowley had moved so\nfast back and forth over the support beams and even over the railing on the\nedges of their balconies. Aziraphale would love to be able to chalk it up to\nhis demonic grace, that perhaps he had his wings invisibly outstretched to\nassist him in balancing, but he knew that wasn\u2019t the case: Crowley really was\nthat comfortable on his fleet feet, balancing on thin beams and railings, and\nnow he had set up a wooden beam on the picnic green beside the pond for them to\ntry their own balance on. The grass here was thick and littered with daisies,\nand would provide a good deal of padding if they fell, beyond Crowley\u2019s own\nlittle twists of magic.</p><p>He remembered, the body Crowley had had before\nthis one. He\u2019d lost it in\u2026 Oh, what year was it? 1831, he thought, that he\u2019d\nbeen discorporated, and he\u2019d only had it for sixty years or so. He preferred \u2013\nlike Aziraphale \u2013 to wear a man\u2019s body, as a rule<a href=\"#_ftn1\" title=\"\">[1]</a>,\nbut he\u2019d worn a woman\u2019s body, then. He\u2019d been kicked by a horse, Aziraphale\nthought, that was what had ended it\u2026</p><p>He\u2019d been a nursemaid for quite a few\nfamilies, before he\u2019d gone on to teach at a girls\u2019 school for ten years or so.\nHe had always enjoyed the work, and Aziraphale had always thought he would be\ncorrupting the children, but he never did, especially. The children were always\nvery happy and healthy, and he was always very careful with them, even as he\nwent about his usual duties. It was the best way, he always said at the time,\nfor a young woman to remain unmarried and not in threat of such proposals, but Aziraphale\nhad never really believed that.</p><p>Crowley could go unnoticed no matter whom\nor what he wore.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just practice,\u201d Crowley was saying\ngently. \u201cYou get a sense for it.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>Liam came to the end of the bar, taking a\nslow step down, and Crowley turned to gesture for young Lisa, who was the end\nof the line.</p><p>She crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cIt\nlooks quite <i>dangerous</i>,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t dangerous,\u201d Crowley said, shaking\nhis head. Aziraphale watched the way he moved. It came so instinctively to him,\nit always had: he leaned down just slightly, that him and Lisa were on a more\nsimilar level, but his body language was open and casual. Aziraphale wouldn\u2019t\nhave thought to do that, he didn\u2019t think \u2013 or maybe he would have crouched, and\nCrowley said the children hated it when one did that. \u201cLook, you\u2019ve seen Liam,\nStephanie, and Nathaniel do it, and when Nick fell, I caught him, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but he\u2019s <i>small</i>,\u201d Lisa said. She was a rather large little girl, round where\nher sister was more athletic, and she looked rather anxious. \u201cHe\u2019s not nearly\nas heavy as I am.\u201d</p><p>Crowley smiled, and it was a warm, gentle\nsmile, softly paternal in its aspect, and Aziraphale exhaled quietly at the\nsight of it. \u201cLisa, you are <i>not</i>\nheavy. You\u2019ve seen me carry big sheets of glass, the stone for the benches\u2026\nDarling, you\u2019re a bag of feathers compared to all that.\u201d</p><p>Lisa didn\u2019t look convinced, biting down\nupon her lower lip, and Aziraphale hesitated, but then he set a bookmark on his\npage, taking a few steps forward. </p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I show you, dear?\u201d he asked, and\nLisa turned to look up at him. Aziraphale felt himself stiffen slightly,\nuncertain, but then Lisa gave an anxious smile, and nodded her head. She was\nthe only one of the children who visited here he really felt he <i>understood, </i>although that was hardly\nsaying much: he wasn\u2019t very good with children, much as he tried his best, and\nhe knew that, but Lisa didn\u2019t seem to mind especially, and would sometimes come\nand sit down next to him whilst Crowley led the other children in an activity,\nor when she grew disinterested in Crowley\u2019s lessons on one subject or other. </p><p>\u201c<i>You </i>can\u2019t\ndo it,\u201d Stephanie said as Aziraphale delicately toed off his loafers.</p><p>\u201cAnd why is that, young lady?\u201d Aziraphale\nasked as Crowley smiled at him, leaning forward and taking hold of his hand, bringing\nit up to his mouth and kissing the back of his knuckles. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re <i>old</i>,\u201d\nStephanie said. \u201cAnd\u2014 And\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig?\u201d Aziraphale asked, somewhat archly.</p><p>Stephanie closed her mouth. Aziraphale\nheard Lisa giggle behind him.</p><p>\u201cYou will catch me?\u201d he asked, somewhat\nuncertainly.</p><p>\u201cYou probably won\u2019t fall,\u201d Crowley said,\nand Aziraphale laughed as he stepped up the wooden stair Crowley had laid\nbeside the beam. It wasn\u2019t so far off the ground \u2013 only a little higher than four\nfeet \u2013 but he did feel somewhat unbalanced as he set one sole upon the beam,\nstretching out his arms and letting Crowley release his hand.</p><p>\u201cCould <i>you</i>\nfix someone\u2019s roof, Mr Fell?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, goodness, no,\u201d Aziraphale said,\nresisting the urge to shake his head, because he knew he would topple if he did\nthat. He wanted to throw out his wings to assist him, but he didn\u2019t wish to <i>cheat</i>, as it were: he was rather\nunsteady as he moved along the beam, rather slowly, compared to the children,\nbut Crowley was smiling up at him as he walked alongside. \u201cNo, I fear Anthony\nfar exceeds me in most practical skills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d Crowley murmured. \u201cEzra\ncan make bindings for books from scratch. Spins his goldwork and everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s goldwork?\u201d Liam asked.</p><p>\u201cYou spin metals into thin threads,\u201d Ezra\nsaid, focusing forward as he drew his next foot forward. \u201cYou can embroider\nwith them, then \u2013 some books take well to embroidery to decorate covers,\nespecially leather and cloth covers, but it\u2019s very good for the binding, too,\nwhere one might stitch the pages. Golden or silver thread is quite hardwearing,\nof course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Liam said. Aziraphale felt his lips\ntwitch as he finally came to the end of the beam. He\u2019d had a few wobbles, but\nhe hadn\u2019t fallen\u2014</p><p>Well.</p><p>Until now.</p><p>He turned to meet Crowley\u2019s gaze, and the\ndemon gave a slight inclination of his head: Aziraphale squeezed his eyes\nrather tightly shut as he let himself tip to the side, doing his best not to\nlet out a yelp as he felt his foot come away from the bar, but he knew Crowley would\ncatch him, he knew\u2014</p><p>Crowley\u2019s arms were strong as they encircled\nhim, catching at the backs of his thighs and his back, and Aziraphale let out a\nbreathless sound, reaching up and touching the side of Crowley\u2019s neck. Crowley\nleaned in, kissing his nose, and Aziraphale laughed quietly, leaning his head\non Crowley\u2019s shoulder as he exhaled.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d Crowley said, winking at Lisa. \u201cLight\nas a feather.\u201d</p><p>She did look much more confident now, at least.\nAziraphale could see the light shining in her eyes and the way she was bouncing\non her heels, and he felt himself smile slightly as he stood delicately back to\nhis feet, moving to retrieve his shoes. </p><p>Lisa hurried forward, and Aziraphale\nstepped to the side, but to his surprise she threw her arms about his waist, hugging\nhim very tightly. \u201cOh,\u201d he said, awkwardly \u2013 but gently \u2013 patting the top of\nher head, brushing the blue silk of her Alice band as he did so, and he smiled.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mr Fell,\u201d she mumbled against\nthe wool vest over his belly.</p><p>\u201cOh, my dear, it\u2019s no trouble at all, come\nnow.\u201d He looked at Crowley, who raised his eyebrows and shrugged his shoulders\nslightly, but his smile was encouraging. Aziraphale delicately patted her\nshoulder, and she leaned back, beaming up at him, before she stepped toward the\nbeam and removed her little ballet slippers. </p><p>It was\u2014</p><p>He hadn\u2019t been hugged by a child in an\nawfully long time, he didn\u2019t think. He wasn\u2019t sure in how many years, but not\nfor\u2026 In the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century, perhaps, when Crowley was asleep \u2013 he\u2019d\ntaken up at the Hyacinth and Vine, the discreet little gentleman\u2019s club in\nLondon, much more than he had, and he believed he\u2019d fetched some young boy\u2019s\ncat from a tree whilst walking out to the club of an evening. Poor thing had\nbeen beside himself, if he recalled.</p><p>This was somewhat more\u2014</p><p><i>Significant</i>, he supposed it felt.</p><p>They had been here for several months, now.\nAdam had visited twice, and that had been nice \u2013 they\u2019d actually rather begun\nbeing his <i>godfathers</i>, in the year\nsince the Apocalypse hadn\u2019t happened, and he was a pleasant boy, kind,\nintelligent, but he was rather\u2026</p><p>Crowley would no doubt chide him for\ncalling the boy rough-and-tumble. Aziraphale didn\u2019t know what the more modern\nparlance might be. But he didn\u2019t especially need anybody\u2019s support or comfort,\nand although he often asked Aziraphale questions, he didn\u2019t ordinarily wait for\nan answer.</p><p>These children, though, they did listen to\nhim, particularly when they <i>asked</i> for\nhim to explain something. They could be a little rude, of course \u2013 Stephanie in\nparticular had a rather startling tendency to blurt out precisely what was on\nher mind, regardless of how <i>thoughtless</i>\nit might be, and young Nathaniel tried too hard to be clever, sometimes with a\nview to being unkind, but\u2026 They weren\u2019t nasty children, not at all. They were\ngenerally thoughtful, and generally gentle.</p><p>He recalled when Crowley had taught at that\ngirls\u2019 school \u2013 <i>those</i> young ladies\nhad been vicious little demons in their own right, even without his careful\ntutelage. He <i>liked</i> children,\nAziraphale knew. He was <i>good</i> with\nthem, and they liked him: they liked that he was funny and erudite, and they\nliked how neatly he explained things, how he saw things on their level\u2026 </p><p>Aziraphale wasn\u2019t all that good at such\nthings. He condescended without meaning to, or got confused as to what the\nchildren did or didn\u2019t know, or tried too hard. But, Crowley\u2026 </p><p>\u201cThere you go, my girl!\u201d Crowley said,\nclapping his hands together, and Lisa laughed as she stepped on very graceful\nfeet down from the beam \u2013 she really did have nothing to worry about. She was an\nincredibly dainty girl, with a grace that did remind Aziraphale of the way\nthings used to be, seventy years ago, ninety\u2026</p><p>She beamed at Aziraphale, and he smiled\nright back at her.</p><p><b>\u2654 </b><b>\u2629 </b><b>\u2654 </b><b>\u2629 </b><b>\u2654 </b><b>\u2629 </b><b>\u2654</b></p><p>Later on, when the children had gone home, he\nsat at one of the stools on the kitchen island, watching Crowley\u2019s fingers as\nhe delicately worked upon the pastry, twisting two threads of the stuff about\nthe edge of a bramble pie. </p><p>\u201cCrowley,\u201d Aziraphale asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith\u2014 With Young Warlock,\u201d Aziraphale said\nquietly, keeping his hands up from the counter and away from the flour dusting\nit, \u201cyou sent Ashtoreth. In your place, I mean, as I sent Francis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe-es,\u201d Crowley said, raising an expectant\neyebrow.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014 Well, my dear, <i>you</i> were a nursemaid. For nearly fifty years! And that was without\nteaching at that boarding school, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that was years ago,\u201d Crowley scoffed,\nhis tone dismissive. \u201cChildren were different, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut these children are just the same, and\nyou\u2019re good with them,\u201d Aziraphale said. \u201cTeaching them this morning, you did\nso well with them. They adore you. I don\u2019t mean to disparage Ashtoreth\u2019s\nabilities, but had you nannied himself, you know, you\u2019d have been\u2014 You\u2019d have\nbeen at quite the advantage, you know, you could have\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe wanted it to be equal,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cOur\ninfluence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Aziraphale allowed.</p><p>\u201cAnd I never\u2014\u201d Crowley furrowed his brow,\npressing his lips together. \u201c<i>Ashtoreth</i>\nwas comfortable, going all in for that\u2026 Hell stuff. You know, telling him to\npraise Lucifer and what-not, and telling him to be nasty and cruel. What do I\nwant to be telling a kid to do that for? She was just as\u2014 What is it, as\nFrancis was?

I couldn\u2019t have been like that.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou seem\u2014 My dear, you seem ever so happy.\nSo in your element, with these children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Crowley murmured, his lip twitching\nslightly, and Aziraphale reached out, drawing his fingers gently over Crowley\u2019s\nchin, tracing the jut of bone there. \u201cCan\u2019t exactly win that Lisa Turpin over,\nthough. She\u2019s your girl through and through, Mr Fell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know about that, Mr Crowley,\u201d\nAziraphale murmured, touching his thumb to the base of Crowley\u2019s lip as Crowley\nlooked at him with warmth in his yellow eyes, but he felt himself smile, felt\nthe sense of warmth the idea evoked. \u201cThey\u2019re such\u2026 They\u2019re such <i>lovely</i> children. I just wish I had your\ngrace with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just need to let them come to you,\u201d\nCrowley said. \u201cLike cats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot of cats find me overbearing,\u201d\nAziraphale said.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cThis advice is two\nbirds with one stone, angel.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale let out an indignant huff, but\nCrowley leaned his chin right into Aziraphale\u2019s palm, showing his teeth when he\nsmiled again. \u201cYou know,\u201d Aziraphale said, \u201cand I don\u2019t say this in terms of\nthe, ah, the <i>near</i> future, but\u2026 A lot\nof retirees, they foster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething to think about,\u201d Crowley said\nquietly, kissing the meat at the heel of Aziraphale\u2019s palm. \u201cDo you want to\nwatch something? I\u2019ll bring the television up to the bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat have you in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Star\nTrek</i>.

For just a moment, they were outside Eden, and Crowley was but a mess of\nroping coils in his lap, his scaled chin resting in Aziraphale\u2019s palm. That was\never so long ago, and yet equally, it was just yesterday.</p><p>He nodded, with a small smile, and he withdrew\nhis hand, that Crowley might return to his work.</p><p>It was a good night.</p><p>Peaceful, quiet.</p><p>They were at home together, and this was\nthe new routine. </p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" title=\"\">[1]</a> Although, they would each freely admit, this mattered very little,\nas either of them could alter their appearance quite entirely on the head of a\npin, if they wanted to, but it was the <i>premise</i>\nof the thing.</p>",

Aziraphale watched the way he moved. It came so instinctively to him,\nit always had: he leaned down just slightly, that him and Lisa were on a more\nsimilar level, but his body language was open and casual. Aziraphale wouldn\u2019t\nhave thought to do that, he didn\u2019t think \u2013 or maybe he would have crouched, and\nCrowley said the children hated it when one did that. \u201cLook, you\u2019ve seen Liam,\nStephanie, and Nathaniel do it, and when Nick fell, I caught him, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but he\u2019s <i>small</i>,\u201d Lisa said. She was a rather large little girl, round where\nher sister was more athletic, and she looked rather anxious. \u201cHe\u2019s not nearly\nas heavy as I am.\u201d</p><p>Crowley smiled, and it was a warm, gentle\nsmile, softly paternal in its aspect, and Aziraphale exhaled quietly at the\nsight of it. \u201cLisa, you are <i>not</i>\nheavy. You\u2019ve seen me carry big sheets of glass, the stone for the benches\u2026\nDarling, you\u2019re a bag of feathers compared to all that.\u201d</p><p>Lisa didn\u2019t look convinced, biting down\nupon her lower lip, and Aziraphale hesitated, but then he set a bookmark on his\npage, taking a few steps forward. </p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I show you, dear?\u201d he asked, and\nLisa turned to look up at him. Aziraphale felt himself stiffen slightly,\nuncertain, but then Lisa gave an anxious smile, and nodded her head. She was\nthe only one of the children who visited here he really felt he <i>understood, </i>although that was hardly\nsaying much: he wasn\u2019t very good with children, much as he tried his best, and\nhe knew that, but Lisa didn\u2019t seem to mind especially, and would sometimes come\nand sit down next to him whilst Crowley led the other children in an activity,\nor when she grew disinterested in Crowley\u2019s lessons on one subject or other. </p><p>\u201c<i>You </i>can\u2019t\ndo it,\u201d Stephanie said as Aziraphale delicately toed off his loafers.</p><p>\u201cAnd why is that, young lady?\u201d Aziraphale\nasked as Crowley smiled at him, leaning forward and taking hold of his hand, bringing\nit up to his mouth and kissing the back of his knuckles. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re <i>old</i>,\u201d\nStephanie said. \u201cAnd\u2014 And\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig?\u201d Aziraphale asked, somewhat archly.</p><p>Stephanie closed her mouth. Aziraphale\nheard Lisa giggle behind him.</p><p>\u201cYou will catch me?\u201d he asked, somewhat\nuncertainly.</p><p>\u201cYou probably won\u2019t fall,\u201d Crowley said,\nand Aziraphale laughed as he stepped up the wooden stair Crowley had laid\nbeside the beam. It wasn\u2019t so far off the ground \u2013 only a little higher than four\nfeet \u2013 but he did feel somewhat unbalanced as he set one sole upon the beam,\nstretching out his arms and letting Crowley release his hand.</p><p>\u201cCould <i>you</i>\nfix someone\u2019s roof, Mr Fell?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, goodness, no,\u201d Aziraphale said,\nresisting the urge to shake his head, because he knew he would topple if he did\nthat. He wanted to throw out his wings to assist him, but he didn\u2019t wish to <i>cheat</i>, as it were: he was rather\nunsteady as he moved along the beam, rather slowly, compared to the children,\nbut Crowley was smiling up at him as he walked alongside. \u201cNo, I fear Anthony\nfar exceeds me in most practical skills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d Crowley murmured. \u201cEzra\ncan make bindings for books from scratch. Spins his goldwork and everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s goldwork?\u201d Liam asked.</p><p>\u201cYou spin metals into thin threads,\u201d Ezra\nsaid, focusing forward as he drew his next foot forward. \u201cYou can embroider\nwith them, then \u2013 some books take well to embroidery to decorate covers,\nespecially leather and cloth covers, but it\u2019s very good for the binding, too,\nwhere one might stitch the pages. Golden or silver thread is quite hardwearing,\nof course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Liam said. Aziraphale felt his lips\ntwitch as he finally came to the end of the beam. He\u2019d had a few wobbles, but\nhe hadn\u2019t fallen\u2014</p><p>Well.</p><p>Until now.</p><p>He turned to meet Crowley\u2019s gaze, and the\ndemon gave a slight inclination of his head: Aziraphale squeezed his eyes\nrather tightly shut as he let himself tip to the side, doing his best not to\nlet out a yelp as he felt his foot come away from the bar, but he knew Crowley would\ncatch him, he knew\u2014</p><p>Crowley\u2019s arms were strong as they encircled\nhim, catching at the backs of his thighs and his back, and Aziraphale let out a\nbreathless sound, reaching up and touching the side of Crowley\u2019s neck. Crowley\nleaned in, kissing his nose, and Aziraphale laughed quietly, leaning his head\non Crowley\u2019s shoulder as he exhaled.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d Crowley said, winking at Lisa. \u201cLight\nas a feather.\u201d</p><p>She did look much more confident now, at least.\nAziraphale could see the light shining in her eyes and the way she was bouncing\non her heels, and he felt himself smile slightly as he stood delicately back to\nhis feet, moving to retrieve his shoes. </p><p>Lisa hurried forward, and Aziraphale\nstepped to the side, but to his surprise she threw her arms about his waist, hugging\nhim very tightly. \u201cOh,\u201d he said, awkwardly \u2013 but gently \u2013 patting the top of\nher head, brushing the blue silk of her Alice band as he did so, and he smiled.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mr Fell,\u201d she mumbled against\nthe wool vest over his belly.</p><p>\u201cOh, my dear, it\u2019s no trouble at all, come\nnow.\u201d He looked at Crowley, who raised his eyebrows and shrugged his shoulders\nslightly, but his smile was encouraging. Aziraphale delicately patted her\nshoulder, and she leaned back, beaming up at him, before she stepped toward the\nbeam and removed her little ballet slippers. </p><p>It was\u2014</p><p>He hadn\u2019t been hugged by a child in an\nawfully long time, he didn\u2019t think. He wasn\u2019t sure in how many years, but not\nfor\u2026 In the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century, perhaps, when Crowley was asleep \u2013 he\u2019d\ntaken up at the Hyacinth and Vine, the discreet little gentleman\u2019s club in\nLondon, much more than he had, and he believed he\u2019d fetched some young boy\u2019s\ncat from a tree whilst walking out to the club of an evening. Poor thing had\nbeen beside himself, if he recalled.</p><p>This was somewhat more\u2014</p><p><i>Significant</i>, he supposed it felt.</p><p>They had been here for several months, now.\nAdam had visited twice, and that had been nice \u2013 they\u2019d actually rather begun\nbeing his <i>godfathers</i>, in the year\nsince the Apocalypse hadn\u2019t happened, and he was a pleasant boy, kind,\nintelligent, but he was rather\u2026</p><p>Crowley would no doubt chide him for\ncalling the boy rough-and-tumble. Aziraphale didn\u2019t know what the more modern\nparlance might be. But he didn\u2019t especially need anybody\u2019s support or comfort,\nand although he often asked Aziraphale questions, he didn\u2019t ordinarily wait for\nan answer.</p><p>These children, though, they did listen to\nhim, particularly when they <i>asked</i> for\nhim to explain something. They could be a little rude, of course \u2013 Stephanie in\nparticular had a rather startling tendency to blurt out precisely what was on\nher mind, regardless of how <i>thoughtless</i>\nit might be, and young Nathaniel tried too hard to be clever, sometimes with a\nview to being unkind, but\u2026 They weren\u2019t nasty children, not at all. They were\ngenerally thoughtful, and generally gentle.</p><p>He recalled when Crowley had taught at that\ngirls\u2019 school \u2013 <i>those</i> young ladies\nhad been vicious little demons in their own right, even without his careful\ntutelage. He <i>liked</i> children,\nAziraphale knew. He was <i>good</i> with\nthem, and they liked him: they liked that he was funny and erudite, and they\nliked how neatly he explained things, how he saw things on their level\u2026 </p><p>Aziraphale wasn\u2019t all that good at such\nthings. He condescended without meaning to, or got confused as to what the\nchildren did or didn\u2019t know, or tried too hard. But, Crowley\u2026 </p><p>\u201cThere you go, my girl!\u201d Crowley said,\nclapping his hands together, and Lisa laughed as she stepped on very graceful\nfeet down from the beam \u2013 she really did have nothing to worry about. She was an\nincredibly dainty girl, with a grace that did remind Aziraphale of the way\nthings used to be, seventy years ago, ninety\u2026</p><p>She beamed at Aziraphale, and he smiled\nright back at her.</p><p><b>\u2654 </b><b>\u2629 </b><b>\u2654 </b><b>\u2629 </b><b>\u2654 </b><b>\u2629 </b><b>\u2654</b></p><p>Later on, when the children had gone home, he\nsat at one of the stools on the kitchen island, watching Crowley\u2019s fingers as\nhe delicately worked upon the pastry, twisting two threads of the stuff about\nthe edge of a bramble pie. </p><p>\u201cCrowley,\u201d Aziraphale asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith\u2014 With Young Warlock,\u201d Aziraphale said\nquietly, keeping his hands up from the counter and away from the flour dusting\nit, \u201cyou sent Ashtoreth.

For nearly fifty years! And that was without\nteaching at that boarding school, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that was years ago,\u201d Crowley scoffed,\nhis tone dismissive. \u201cChildren were different, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut these children are just the same, and\nyou\u2019re good with them,\u201d Aziraphale said. \u201cTeaching them this morning, you did\nso well with them.

I couldn\u2019t have been like that.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou seem\u2014 My dear, you seem ever so happy.\nSo in your element, with these children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Crowley murmured, his lip twitching\nslightly, and Aziraphale reached out, drawing his fingers gently over Crowley\u2019s\nchin, tracing the jut of bone there. \u201cCan\u2019t exactly win that Lisa Turpin over,\nthough. She\u2019s your girl through and through, Mr Fell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know about that, Mr Crowley,\u201d\nAziraphale murmured, touching his thumb to the base of Crowley\u2019s lip as Crowley\nlooked at him with warmth in his yellow eyes, but he felt himself smile, felt\nthe sense of warmth the idea evoked. \u201cThey\u2019re such\u2026 They\u2019re such <i>lovely</i> children. I just wish I had your\ngrace with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just need to let them come to you,\u201d\nCrowley said. \u201cLike cats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot of cats find me overbearing,\u201d\nAziraphale said.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cThis advice is two\nbirds with one stone, angel.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale let out an indignant huff, but\nCrowley leaned his chin right into Aziraphale\u2019s palm, showing his teeth when he\nsmiled again. \u201cYou know,\u201d Aziraphale said, \u201cand I don\u2019t say this in terms of\nthe, ah, the <i>near</i> future, but\u2026 A lot\nof retirees, they foster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething to think about,\u201d Crowley said\nquietly, kissing the meat at the heel of Aziraphale\u2019s palm. \u201cDo you want to\nwatch something? I\u2019ll bring the television up to the bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat have you in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Star\nTrek</i>. The one with the whales, I picked it up on video.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe saw that in the cinema only a few years\nback.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d Crowley said.</p><p>Aziraphale considered this for a moment, his\nfingers stroking at the base of Crowley\u2019s throat, feeling the smoothness of the\nskin. For just a moment, they were outside Eden, and Crowley was but a mess of\nroping coils in his lap, his scaled chin resting in Aziraphale\u2019s palm. That was\never so long ago, and yet equally, it was just yesterday.</p><p>He nodded, with a small smile, and he withdrew\nhis hand, that Crowley might return to his work.</p><p>It was a good night.</p><p>Peaceful, quiet.</p><p>They were at home together, and this was\nthe new routine. </p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" title=\"\">[1]</a> Although, they would each freely admit, this mattered very little,\nas either of them could alter their appearance quite entirely on the head of a\npin, if they wanted to, but it was the <i>premise</i>\nof the thing.</p>",

A/C.\u00a0</i></b>Just some domestic sweetness. Aziraphale isn\u2019t good with children, not like Crowley is, like Crowley always has been.\u00a0</i></b><b><i>But he tries his best.</i></b></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s alright, just like that,\u201d Crowley\nsaid, smiling as he leaned back, and Aziraphale kept his book loosely in his\nlap as he watched Crowley work. Liam had his arms outstretched as he walked\nslowly along the bar, his gaze forward. \u201cNo, no, see, you\u2019re going on your\ntiptoes again \u2013 you don\u2019t need to. You\u2019ve got the whole of your sole to help\nyou balance, lad, so your toes <i>and</i>\nyour heel\u2026 That\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you do it so fast?\u201d Liam demanded,\nand he stumbled, but Crowley moved to catch him by the hand before he could tip\ntoo far the other way, letting him catch his balance again. </p><p>The children had been watching Crowley fix\nsome of the tiling on the Halifax family\u2019s roof on the other side of\nChesterton-Burnleigh, and they\u2019d been mystified by the way Crowley had moved so\nfast back and forth over the support beams and even over the railing on the\nedges of their balconies. Aziraphale would love to be able to chalk it up to\nhis demonic grace, that perhaps he had his wings invisibly outstretched to\nassist him in balancing, but he knew that wasn\u2019t the case: Crowley really was\nthat comfortable on his fleet feet, balancing on thin beams and railings, and\nnow he had set up a wooden beam on the picnic green beside the pond for them to\ntry their own balance on. The grass here was thick and littered with daisies,\nand would provide a good deal of padding if they fell, beyond Crowley\u2019s own\nlittle twists of magic.</p><p>He remembered, the body Crowley had had before\nthis one. He\u2019d lost it in\u2026 Oh, what year was it? 1831, he thought, that he\u2019d\nbeen discorporated, and he\u2019d only had it for sixty years or so. He preferred \u2013\nlike Aziraphale \u2013 to wear a man\u2019s body, as a rule<a href=\"#_ftn1\" title=\"\">[1]</a>,\nbut he\u2019d worn a woman\u2019s body, then. He\u2019d been kicked by a horse, Aziraphale\nthought, that was what had ended it\u2026</p><p>He\u2019d been a nursemaid for quite a few\nfamilies, before he\u2019d gone on to teach at a girls\u2019 school for ten years or so.\nHe had always enjoyed the work, and Aziraphale had always thought he would be\ncorrupting the children, but he never did, especially. The children were always\nvery happy and healthy, and he was always very careful with them, even as he\nwent about his usual duties. It was the best way, he always said at the time,\nfor a young woman to remain unmarried and not in threat of such proposals, but Aziraphale\nhad never really believed that.</p><p>Crowley could go unnoticed no matter whom\nor what he wore.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just practice,\u201d Crowley was saying\ngently. \u201cYou get a sense for it.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>Liam came to the end of the bar, taking a\nslow step down, and Crowley turned to gesture for young Lisa, who was the end\nof the line.</p><p>She crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cIt\nlooks quite <i>dangerous</i>,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t dangerous,\u201d Crowley said, shaking\nhis head. Aziraphale watched the way he moved. It came so instinctively to him,\nit always had: he leaned down just slightly, that him and Lisa were on a more\nsimilar level, but his body language was open and casual. Aziraphale wouldn\u2019t\nhave thought to do that, he didn\u2019t think \u2013 or maybe he would have crouched, and\nCrowley said the children hated it when one did that. \u201cLook, you\u2019ve seen Liam,\nStephanie, and Nathaniel do it, and when Nick fell, I caught him, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but he\u2019s <i>small</i>,\u201d Lisa said. She was a rather large little girl, round where\nher sister was more athletic, and she looked rather anxious. \u201cHe\u2019s not nearly\nas heavy as I am.\u201d</p><p>Crowley smiled, and it was a warm, gentle\nsmile, softly paternal in its aspect, and Aziraphale exhaled quietly at the\nsight of it. \u201cLisa, you are <i>not</i>\nheavy. You\u2019ve seen me carry big sheets of glass, the stone for the benches\u2026\nDarling, you\u2019re a bag of feathers compared to all that.\u201d</p><p>Lisa didn\u2019t look convinced, biting down\nupon her lower lip, and Aziraphale hesitated, but then he set a bookmark on his\npage, taking a few steps forward. </p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I show you, dear?\u201d he asked, and\nLisa turned to look up at him. Aziraphale felt himself stiffen slightly,\nuncertain, but then Lisa gave an anxious smile, and nodded her head. She was\nthe only one of the children who visited here he really felt he <i>understood, </i>although that was hardly\nsaying much: he wasn\u2019t very good with children, much as he tried his best, and\nhe knew that, but Lisa didn\u2019t seem to mind especially, and would sometimes come\nand sit down next to him whilst Crowley led the other children in an activity,\nor when she grew disinterested in Crowley\u2019s lessons on one subject or other. </p><p>\u201c<i>You </i>can\u2019t\ndo it,\u201d Stephanie said as Aziraphale delicately toed off his loafers.</p><p>\u201cAnd why is that, young lady?\u201d Aziraphale\nasked as Crowley smiled at him, leaning forward and taking hold of his hand, bringing\nit up to his mouth and kissing the back of his knuckles. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re <i>old</i>,\u201d\nStephanie said. \u201cAnd\u2014 And\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig?\u201d Aziraphale asked, somewhat archly.</p><p>Stephanie closed her mouth. Aziraphale\nheard Lisa giggle behind him.</p><p>\u201cYou will catch me?\u201d he asked, somewhat\nuncertainly.</p><p>\u201cYou probably won\u2019t fall,\u201d Crowley said,\nand Aziraphale laughed as he stepped up the wooden stair Crowley had laid\nbeside the beam. It wasn\u2019t so far off the ground \u2013 only a little higher than four\nfeet \u2013 but he did feel somewhat unbalanced as he set one sole upon the beam,\nstretching out his arms and letting Crowley release his hand.</p><p>\u201cCould <i>you</i>\nfix someone\u2019s roof, Mr Fell?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, goodness, no,\u201d Aziraphale said,\nresisting the urge to shake his head, because he knew he would topple if he did\nthat. He wanted to throw out his wings to assist him, but he didn\u2019t wish to <i>cheat</i>, as it were: he was rather\nunsteady as he moved along the beam, rather slowly, compared to the children,\nbut Crowley was smiling up at him as he walked alongside. \u201cNo, I fear Anthony\nfar exceeds me in most practical skills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d Crowley murmured. \u201cEzra\ncan make bindings for books from scratch. Spins his goldwork and everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s goldwork?\u201d Liam asked.</p><p>\u201cYou spin metals into thin threads,\u201d Ezra\nsaid, focusing forward as he drew his next foot forward. \u201cYou can embroider\nwith them, then \u2013 some books take well to embroidery to decorate covers,\nespecially leather and cloth covers, but it\u2019s very good for the binding, too,\nwhere one might stitch the pages. Golden or silver thread is quite hardwearing,\nof course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Liam said. Aziraphale felt his lips\ntwitch as he finally came to the end of the beam. He\u2019d had a few wobbles, but\nhe hadn\u2019t fallen\u2014</p><p>Well.</p><p>Until now.</p><p>He turned to meet Crowley\u2019s gaze, and the\ndemon gave a slight inclination of his head: Aziraphale squeezed his eyes\nrather tightly shut as he let himself tip to the side, doing his best not to\nlet out a yelp as he felt his foot come away from the bar, but he knew Crowley would\ncatch him, he knew\u2014</p><p>Crowley\u2019s arms were strong as they encircled\nhim, catching at the backs of his thighs and his back, and Aziraphale let out a\nbreathless sound, reaching up and touching the side of Crowley\u2019s neck. Crowley\nleaned in, kissing his nose, and Aziraphale laughed quietly, leaning his head\non Crowley\u2019s shoulder as he exhaled.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d Crowley said, winking at Lisa. \u201cLight\nas a feather.\u201d</p><p>She did look much more confident now, at least.\nAziraphale could see the light shining in her eyes and the way she was bouncing\non her heels, and he felt himself smile slightly as he stood delicately back to\nhis feet, moving to retrieve his shoes. </p><p>Lisa hurried forward, and Aziraphale\nstepped to the side, but to his surprise she threw her arms about his waist, hugging\nhim very tightly. \u201cOh,\u201d he said, awkwardly \u2013 but gently \u2013 patting the top of\nher head, brushing the blue silk of her Alice band as he did so, and he smiled.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mr Fell,\u201d she mumbled against\nthe wool vest over his belly.</p><p>\u201cOh, my dear, it\u2019s no trouble at all, come\nnow.\u201d He looked at Crowley, who raised his eyebrows and shrugged his shoulders\nslightly, but his smile was encouraging. Aziraphale delicately patted her\nshoulder, and she leaned back, beaming up at him, before she stepped toward the\nbeam and removed her little ballet slippers. </p><p>It was\u2014</p><p>He hadn\u2019t been hugged by a child in an\nawfully long time, he didn\u2019t think. He wasn\u2019t sure in how many years, but not\nfor\u2026 In the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century, perhaps, when Crowley was asleep \u2013 he\u2019d\ntaken up at the Hyacinth and Vine, the discreet little gentleman\u2019s club in\nLondon, much more than he had, and he believed he\u2019d fetched some young boy\u2019s\ncat from a tree whilst walking out to the club of an evening. Poor thing had\nbeen beside himself, if he recalled.</p><p>This was somewhat more\u2014</p><p><i>Significant</i>, he supposed it felt.</p><p>They had been here for several months, now.\nAdam had visited twice, and that had been nice \u2013 they\u2019d actually rather begun\nbeing his <i>godfathers</i>, in the year\nsince the Apocalypse hadn\u2019t happened, and he was a pleasant boy, kind,\nintelligent, but he was rather\u2026</p><p>Crowley would no doubt chide him for\ncalling the boy rough-and-tumble. Aziraphale didn\u2019t know what the more modern\nparlance might be. But he didn\u2019t especially need anybody\u2019s support or comfort,\nand although he often asked Aziraphale questions, he didn\u2019t ordinarily wait for\nan answer.</p><p>These children, though, they did listen to\nhim, particularly when they <i>asked</i> for\nhim to explain something. They could be a little rude, of course \u2013 Stephanie in\nparticular had a rather startling tendency to blurt out precisely what was on\nher mind, regardless of how <i>thoughtless</i>\nit might be, and young Nathaniel tried too hard to be clever, sometimes with a\nview to being unkind, but\u2026 They weren\u2019t nasty children, not at all. They were\ngenerally thoughtful, and generally gentle.</p><p>He recalled when Crowley had taught at that\ngirls\u2019 school \u2013 <i>those</i> young ladies\nhad been vicious little demons in their own right, even without his careful\ntutelage. He <i>liked</i> children,\nAziraphale knew. He was <i>good</i> with\nthem, and they liked him: they liked that he was funny and erudite, and they\nliked how neatly he explained things, how he saw things on their level\u2026 </p><p>Aziraphale wasn\u2019t all that good at such\nthings. He condescended without meaning to, or got confused as to what the\nchildren did or didn\u2019t know, or tried too hard. But, Crowley\u2026 </p><p>\u201cThere you go, my girl!\u201d Crowley said,\nclapping his hands together, and Lisa laughed as she stepped on very graceful\nfeet down from the beam \u2013 she really did have nothing to worry about. She was an\nincredibly dainty girl, with a grace that did remind Aziraphale of the way\nthings used to be, seventy years ago, ninety\u2026</p><p>She beamed at Aziraphale, and he smiled\nright back at her.</p><p><b>\u2654 </b><b>\u2629 </b><b>\u2654 </b><b>\u2629 </b><b>\u2654 </b><b>\u2629 </b><b>\u2654</b></p><p>Later on, when the children had gone home, he\nsat at one of the stools on the kitchen island, watching Crowley\u2019s fingers as\nhe delicately worked upon the pastry, twisting two threads of the stuff about\nthe edge of a bramble pie. </p><p>\u201cCrowley,\u201d Aziraphale asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith\u2014 With Young Warlock,\u201d Aziraphale said\nquietly, keeping his hands up from the counter and away from the flour dusting\nit, \u201cyou sent Ashtoreth. In your place, I mean, as I sent Francis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe-es,\u201d Crowley said, raising an expectant\neyebrow.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014 Well, my dear, <i>you</i> were a nursemaid. For nearly fifty years! And that was without\nteaching at that boarding school, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that was years ago,\u201d Crowley scoffed,\nhis tone dismissive. \u201cChildren were different, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut these children are just the same, and\nyou\u2019re good with them,\u201d Aziraphale said. \u201cTeaching them this morning, you did\nso well with them. They adore you. I don\u2019t mean to disparage Ashtoreth\u2019s\nabilities, but had you nannied himself, you know, you\u2019d have been\u2014 You\u2019d have\nbeen at quite the advantage, you know, you could have\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe wanted it to be equal,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cOur\ninfluence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Aziraphale allowed.</p><p>\u201cAnd I never\u2014\u201d Crowley furrowed his brow,\npressing his lips together. \u201c<i>Ashtoreth</i>\nwas comfortable, going all in for that\u2026 Hell stuff.

Over-the-top, it means.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuperlative?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuperlative,\u201d Crowley said, nodding his\nhead. \u201cYeah.

The children were always\nvery happy and healthy, and he was always very careful with them, even as he\nwent about his usual duties. It was the best way, he always said at the time,\nfor a young woman to remain unmarried and not in threat of such proposals, but Aziraphale\nhad never really believed that.</p><p>Crowley could go unnoticed no matter whom\nor what he wore.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just practice,&rdquo; Crowley was saying\ngently. &ldquo;You get a sense for it.&rdquo;</p><p>Liam came to the end of the bar, taking a\nslow step down, and Crowley turned to gesture for young Lisa, who was the end\nof the line.</p><p>She crossed her arms over her chest. &ldquo;It\nlooks quite <i>dangerous</i>,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t dangerous,&rdquo; Crowley said, shaking\nhis head. Aziraphale watched the way he moved. It came so instinctively to him,\nit always had: he leaned down just slightly, that him and Lisa were on a more\nsimilar level, but his body language was open and casual. Aziraphale wouldn&rsquo;t\nhave thought to do that, he didn&rsquo;t think &ndash; or maybe he would have crouched, and\nCrowley said the children hated it when one did that. &ldquo;Look, you&rsquo;ve seen Liam,\nStephanie, and Nathaniel do it, and when Nick fell, I caught him, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, but he&rsquo;s <i>small</i>,&rdquo; Lisa said. She was a rather large little girl, round where\nher sister was more athletic, and she looked rather anxious. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not nearly\nas heavy as I am.&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley smiled, and it was a warm, gentle\nsmile, softly paternal in its aspect, and Aziraphale exhaled quietly at the\nsight of it. &ldquo;Lisa, you are <i>not</i>\nheavy. You&rsquo;ve seen me carry big sheets of glass, the stone for the benches&hellip;\nDarling, you&rsquo;re a bag of feathers compared to all that.&rdquo;</p><p>Lisa didn&rsquo;t look convinced, biting down\nupon her lower lip, and Aziraphale hesitated, but then he set a bookmark on his\npage, taking a few steps forward. </p><p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t I show you, dear?&rdquo; he asked, and\nLisa turned to look up at him. Aziraphale felt himself stiffen slightly,\nuncertain, but then Lisa gave an anxious smile, and nodded her head. She was\nthe only one of the children who visited here he really felt he <i>understood, </i>although that was hardly\nsaying much: he wasn&rsquo;t very good with children, much as he tried his best, and\nhe knew that, but Lisa didn&rsquo;t seem to mind especially, and would sometimes come\nand sit down next to him whilst Crowley led the other children in an activity,\nor when she grew disinterested in Crowley&rsquo;s lessons on one subject or other. </p><p>&ldquo;<i>You </i>can&rsquo;t\ndo it,&rdquo; Stephanie said as Aziraphale delicately toed off his loafers.</p><p>&ldquo;And why is that, young lady?&rdquo; Aziraphale\nasked as Crowley smiled at him, leaning forward and taking hold of his hand, bringing\nit up to his mouth and kissing the back of his knuckles. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re <i>old</i>,&rdquo;\nStephanie said. &ldquo;And&mdash; And&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Big?&rdquo; Aziraphale asked, somewhat archly.</p><p>Stephanie closed her mouth. Aziraphale\nheard Lisa giggle behind him.</p><p>&ldquo;You will catch me?&rdquo; he asked, somewhat\nuncertainly.</p><p>&ldquo;You probably won&rsquo;t fall,&rdquo; Crowley said,\nand Aziraphale laughed as he stepped up the wooden stair Crowley had laid\nbeside the beam. It wasn&rsquo;t so far off the ground &ndash; only a little higher than four\nfeet &ndash; but he did feel somewhat unbalanced as he set one sole upon the beam,\nstretching out his arms and letting Crowley release his hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Could <i>you</i>\nfix someone&rsquo;s roof, Mr Fell?&rdquo; Nick asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, goodness, no,&rdquo; Aziraphale said,\nresisting the urge to shake his head, because he knew he would topple if he did\nthat. He wanted to throw out his wings to assist him, but he didn&rsquo;t wish to <i>cheat</i>, as it were: he was rather\nunsteady as he moved along the beam, rather slowly, compared to the children,\nbut Crowley was smiling up at him as he walked alongside. &ldquo;No, I fear Anthony\nfar exceeds me in most practical skills.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not true,&rdquo; Crowley murmured. &ldquo;Ezra\ncan make bindings for books from scratch. Spins his goldwork and everything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s goldwork?&rdquo; Liam asked.</p><p>&ldquo;You spin metals into thin threads,&rdquo; Ezra\nsaid, focusing forward as he drew his next foot forward. &ldquo;You can embroider\nwith them, then &ndash; some books take well to embroidery to decorate covers,\nespecially leather and cloth covers, but it&rsquo;s very good for the binding, too,\nwhere one might stitch the pages. Golden or silver thread is quite hardwearing,\nof course.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; Liam said. Aziraphale felt his lips\ntwitch as he finally came to the end of the beam. He&rsquo;d had a few wobbles, but\nhe hadn&rsquo;t fallen&mdash;</p><p>Well.</p><p>Until now.</p><p>He turned to meet Crowley&rsquo;s gaze, and the\ndemon gave a slight inclination of his head: Aziraphale squeezed his eyes\nrather tightly shut as he let himself tip to the side, doing his best not to\nlet out a yelp as he felt his foot come away from the bar, but he knew Crowley would\ncatch him, he knew&mdash;</p><p>Crowley&rsquo;s arms were strong as they encircled\nhim, catching at the backs of his thighs and his back, and Aziraphale let out a\nbreathless sound, reaching up and touching the side of Crowley&rsquo;s neck. Crowley\nleaned in, kissing his nose, and Aziraphale laughed quietly, leaning his head\non Crowley&rsquo;s shoulder as he exhaled.</p><p>&ldquo;See?&rdquo; Crowley said, winking at Lisa. &ldquo;Light\nas a feather.&rdquo;</p><p>She did look much more confident now, at least.\nAziraphale could see the light shining in her eyes and the way she was bouncing\non her heels, and he felt himself smile slightly as he stood delicately back to\nhis feet, moving to retrieve his shoes. </p><p>Lisa hurried forward, and Aziraphale\nstepped to the side, but to his surprise she threw her arms about his waist, hugging\nhim very tightly. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said, awkwardly &ndash; but gently &ndash; patting the top of\nher head, brushing the blue silk of her Alice band as he did so, and he smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mr Fell,&rdquo; she mumbled against\nthe wool vest over his belly.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, my dear, it&rsquo;s no trouble at all, come\nnow.&rdquo; He looked at Crowley, who raised his eyebrows and shrugged his shoulders\nslightly, but his smile was encouraging. Aziraphale delicately patted her\nshoulder, and she leaned back, beaming up at him, before she stepped toward the\nbeam and removed her little ballet slippers. </p><p>It was&mdash;</p><p>He hadn&rsquo;t been hugged by a child in an\nawfully long time, he didn&rsquo;t think. He wasn&rsquo;t sure in how many years, but not\nfor&hellip; In the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century, perhaps, when Crowley was asleep &ndash; he&rsquo;d\ntaken up at the Hyacinth and Vine, the discreet little gentleman&rsquo;s club in\nLondon, much more than he had, and he believed he&rsquo;d fetched some young boy&rsquo;s\ncat from a tree whilst walking out to the club of an evening. Poor thing had\nbeen beside himself, if he recalled.</p><p>This was somewhat more&mdash;</p><p><i>Significant</i>, he supposed it felt.</p><p>They had been here for several months, now.\nAdam had visited twice, and that had been nice &ndash; they&rsquo;d actually rather begun\nbeing his <i>godfathers</i>, in the year\nsince the Apocalypse hadn&rsquo;t happened, and he was a pleasant boy, kind,\nintelligent, but he was rather&hellip;</p><p>Crowley would no doubt chide him for\ncalling the boy rough-and-tumble. Aziraphale didn&rsquo;t know what the more modern\nparlance might be. But he didn&rsquo;t especially need anybody&rsquo;s support or comfort,\nand although he often asked Aziraphale questions, he didn&rsquo;t ordinarily wait for\nan answer.</p><p>These children, though, they did listen to\nhim, particularly when they <i>asked</i> for\nhim to explain something. They could be a little rude, of course &ndash; Stephanie in\nparticular had a rather startling tendency to blurt out precisely what was on\nher mind, regardless of how <i>thoughtless</i>\nit might be, and young Nathaniel tried too hard to be clever, sometimes with a\nview to being unkind, but&hellip; They weren&rsquo;t nasty children, not at all. They were\ngenerally thoughtful, and generally gentle.</p><p>He recalled when Crowley had taught at that\ngirls&rsquo; school &ndash; <i>those</i> young ladies\nhad been vicious little demons in their own right, even without his careful\ntutelage. He <i>liked</i> children,\nAziraphale knew. He was <i>good</i> with\nthem, and they liked him: they liked that he was funny and erudite, and they\nliked how neatly he explained things, how he saw things on their level&hellip; </p><p>Aziraphale wasn&rsquo;t all that good at such\nthings. He condescended without meaning to, or got confused as to what the\nchildren did or didn&rsquo;t know, or tried too hard. But, Crowley&hellip; </p><p>&ldquo;There you go, my girl!&rdquo; Crowley said,\nclapping his hands together, and Lisa laughed as she stepped on very graceful\nfeet down from the beam &ndash; she really did have nothing to worry about. She was an\nincredibly dainty girl, with a grace that did remind Aziraphale of the way\nthings used to be, seventy years ago, ninety&hellip;</p><p>She beamed at Aziraphale, and he smiled\nright back at her.</p><p><b>&#9812; </b><b>&#9769; </b><b>&#9812; </b><b>&#9769; </b><b>&#9812; </b><b>&#9769; </b><b>&#9812;</b></p><p>Later on, when the children had gone home, he\nsat at one of the stools on the kitchen island, watching Crowley&rsquo;s fingers as\nhe delicately worked upon the pastry, twisting two threads of the stuff about\nthe edge of a bramble pie. </p><p>&ldquo;Crowley,&rdquo; Aziraphale asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;With&mdash; With Young Warlock,&rdquo; Aziraphale said\nquietly, keeping his hands up from the counter and away from the flour dusting\nit, &ldquo;you sent Ashtoreth. In your place, I mean, as I sent Francis.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ye-es,&rdquo; Crowley said, raising an expectant\neyebrow.</p><p>&ldquo;But&mdash; Well, my dear, <i>you</i> were a nursemaid. For nearly fifty years! And that was without\nteaching at that boarding school, too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, that was years ago,&rdquo; Crowley scoffed,\nhis tone dismissive. &ldquo;Children were different, then.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But these children are just the same, and\nyou&rsquo;re good with them,&rdquo; Aziraphale said. &ldquo;Teaching them this morning, you did\nso well with them. They adore you. I don&rsquo;t mean to disparage Ashtoreth&rsquo;s\nabilities, but had you nannied himself, you know, you&rsquo;d have been&mdash; You&rsquo;d have\nbeen at quite the advantage, you know, you could have&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We wanted it to be equal,&rdquo; Crowley said. &ldquo;Our\ninfluence.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Aziraphale allowed.</p><p>&ldquo;And I never&mdash;&rdquo; Crowley furrowed his brow,\npressing his lips together. &ldquo;<i>Ashtoreth</i>\nwas comfortable, going all in for that&hellip; Hell stuff. You know, telling him to\npraise Lucifer and what-not, and telling him to be nasty and cruel. What do I\nwant to be telling a kid to do that for? She was just as&mdash; What is it, as\nFrancis was? Over-the-top, it means.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Superlative?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Superlative,&rdquo; Crowley said, nodding his\nhead. &ldquo;Yeah. I couldn&rsquo;t have been like that.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You seem&mdash; My dear, you seem ever so happy.\nSo in your element, with these children.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; Crowley murmured, his lip twitching\nslightly, and Aziraphale reached out, drawing his fingers gently over Crowley&rsquo;s\nchin, tracing the jut of bone there. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t exactly win that Lisa Turpin over,\nthough.
