        "answer": "<p><i>H E A V E N</i></p><p>harry would wake up at the tiniest sound coming from the baby monitor and switch it off so you could sleep a little longer and get your littlest from his nursery. he smiled to himself as he was about to open the door when he heard little babbles coming from inside the nursery. your littlest baby was (always is and forever will be) the happiest, giggliest baby in the whole world so not once he ever woke up crying. okay maybe once when he was teething but hey who can blame him? you\u2019d wake up crying too if you have a pointy little devilish thing breaking through your gums. he\u2019d open the door slightly to peek inside and be like, &ldquo;i heard a sound! roaaar! behold, i\u2019m gonna get you!&rdquo; in his monster voice and the squishy eight months old would let out a proper tiny person laugh that gets harry everrrrrrrytime. he\u2019d scoop the baby up into his arms, attacking his chubby cheek with a million kisses before taking the baby out to the kitchen to prepare breakfast. when he was about to reach the stairs, he heard a tiny yawning noise coming from the other room down the hall and he walked there instead. he smiled when he opened the door as he saw his little girl sitting on her bed and rubbing her eyes, smiling at her daddy and her baby brother. &ldquo;good morning, my love! did you sleep good?&rdquo; and the newly three years old hummed in response. harry bent down to kiss her cheek and gave her a squeeze before he got up and walk to the other bed in the middle of the room. he smiled looking at your other daughter who was still sleeping and he felt bad for waking the seven years old up but he knew she\u2019d get upset at him if he didn\u2019t wake her up to help him make breakfast. helping their daddy to make breakfast was their saturday thing because none of them had school and harry didn\u2019t work on the weekend so they really enjoyed their mornings together whilst you get to sleep in. he bent down to kiss her good morning and whispered in her ear, &ldquo;morning, princess. d\u2019you wanna help daddy make waffles?&rdquo; and of course she jumped out with excitement as soon as she heard waffles because she\u2019s the girl after your own heart after all. </p><p>then he went to the other bed across the room to wake your eldest daughter up. the nine years old was still sleeping, facing the wall and he felt bad for waking her up but he loved having all of his children around the kitchen hanging out together as he made breakfast. also, harry swore she made the best scrambled eggs ever. he thought that if she could make the creamiest, fluffiest scrambled eggs he had ever eaten at nine years old then maybe gordon ramsey could finally retire. </p><p>harry told the girls to go to the kitchen and wait for him as he went to the other room across the hall to your sons shared bedroom and woke your eldest son (baby lad is 11 now!) and the five years old up. the boys loved their sleep so it took him a little longer to wake them up but they woke up anyway because who wouldn\u2019t at the mention of food? your boys loved sleep but they loved food more. after waking your whole brood of children up and herding them all to the kitchen, harry started making breakfast with the help of your kids. man, the perks of having bunch of kids. </p><p>&ldquo;can we make pancakes today, daddy?&rdquo; your little five years old asked him as he tugged on the hem of his shirt. </p><p>harry looked down to him, running his fingers through his straight hair that looked exactly like his when he was around his age. &ldquo;y\u2019want pancakes, mate?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;mhm. w\u2019chocolate chips too, daddy.&rdquo; the little boy nodded and hummed in response. </p><p>&ldquo;alright, s\u2019ppose we can make tha\u2019. who wants pancakes?&rdquo; harry asked and your two other children raised their hands as they giggled. &ldquo;now, who wants waffles?&rdquo; the rest of the children raised their hands and he laughed. promising the kids, &ldquo;alright, we\u2019ll make both today.&rdquo; and earning a cheers from his entire army of children. even the little baby on his hips raised his hands and giggled, mimicking the actions of his older siblings.</p><p>you were already walking towards the kitchen when you heard the cheers. you shook your head as you laughed. you leaned against the frame before entering the kitchen, taking in the sight and feeling your heart twist and turn in the absolute amazing way possible looking at the man of your dream bouncing your baby on his hips as he helped your toddler put some butter into the mixing bowl. some of your kids were squeezing fresh oranges, one was helping to get the flour, the other cracking the eggs. they were all laughing at the joke your five years old was telling them.</p><p>&ldquo;well, well, look who\u2019s up. good morning, your royal highness.&rdquo; harry smirked at you and you cackled. the baby immediately reaching for your arms. </p><p>&ldquo;good morning.&rdquo; you mumbled as you walked closer to where your husband was standing. he shifted the baby into your arms and pressing his lips against yours as he did, earning a shriek of &ldquo;eewwww!&rdquo;, absolutely grossing your children out. it was cut short because you couldn\u2019t help but burst in laugter when your five years old yelled, &ldquo;hey! i can\u2019t see!&rdquo; when his sister covered his eyes with her palms. </p><p>i\u2019m fine you\u2019re fine we\u2019re all fine.</p>",

The friends he has met and the vibe of the culture made him more appreciative of all the greater things in life. It was only supposed to be a two-week trip; to visit some people he already knew and maybe get inspired.</p><p>It has been two months now and Harry was jumping from place to place around the city to get all the things he needed to do done, and all he wanted to do finished since he was leaving in approximately three days. But today was a less productive day than usual so his friend had asked him to walk his Shiba dog; Bell.</p><p>He walked through the increasingly familiar streets with a leash grasped around his large hand and wrapped around his wrist while the end of the chord held the neck of Bell. She had just turned three years old, her birthday only a few days after his and they shared matching birthday hats. He got the pink foam hat, while the puppy got the blue one. His friend had shown him photos of Bell with the hat toppled overhead; almost falling off of the top and Harry couldn\u2019t help but coo at the image.</p><p>Bell was a fast walker. Her feet scampering against the damp concrete as it just rained, but the small puddles on the ground didn\u2019t stop her from briskly walking\u2013 forcing Harry to move his legs faster than his usual walking speed, but he didn\u2019t mind. He was enjoying himself, actually. The smell of fresh rain raised against his nostrils, the rawness of the scenery\u2013 the leaves of the trees were wet and a little darker\u2013 and the roads were emptier than usual from the cold. </p><p>Harry was thinking deeply about new ideas for a new song, mindlessly letting himself get pulled by Bell as if he was the one getting walked. A voice knocks him out of his thoughts. </p><p><i><b>\u201cBell? Is that you?\u201d </b></i></p><p>He usually would\u2019ve ignored it nowadays, wanting to keep a low-profile. But this time, he couldn\u2019t help but lift his head from his neck and crane it toward the sound of the voice, especially since he and Bell were the only ones occupying this street. </p><p>\u201c<b><i>Oh, it is you!</i></b>\u201d He finally finds the source of the voice and sees that it belongs to a girl, a few years younger than him. </p><p>He pauses his steps, waiting for the woman to catch up to him and Bell. His head was tilted in confusion, his grey beanie shifting more on one side of his face. A gust of wind blew suddenly, making the stray curls sway tickling his ears and it makes the girl shiver while she jogged steadily over them. </p><p>She finally reached them, pausing a bit to take a breather while pressing her hands against the tops of her thighs. She smiled at Harry and he didn\u2019t know why his heart fluttered, but it did. </p><p>\u201c<b><i>Hi, can I pet your dog?\u201d</i></b> That was the first sentence she\u2019d uttered directed at him and he blinked at her in response. The softness of her voice surprised him since this was the first time he\u2019d even heard her voice and he found that it was very different from when she was yelling from a distance. </p><p><i>\u201cDo I know you?\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cOops, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</i></b> She said, getting up from her crouched position to get to her full height. Even then, her head only reached the bottom of his chin and he found it absolutely adorable. <b><i>\u201cI\u2019m Y/N, by the way,\u201d</i></b></p><p>Harry engulfed her hand into his; it was soft and felt so fragile between his fingers. Though, he guessed that his brows were still creased in confusion since her facial expression changed when she realized that he didn\u2019t recognize her. </p><p><b><i>\u201cWell, uh no,\u201d </i></b>Y/N trailed off, watching Harry\u2019s reaction closely in case he decided to zoom. <b><i>\u201cI work at a daycare for dogs and I\u2019ve been taking care of Bell for a while,\u201d</i></b></p><p>She crouched down on a knee again when Bell barked her snout at her direction softly, rubbing the side of her nose on Y/N\u2019s calf. Her hand scratched the area between the dogs\u2019 ears, making Bell nuzzle more into her touch. </p><p>While she was busy occupying herself with the pup, Harry was left to stand temporarily fixed to figure where specifically had he heard that name before. He realized that it was <i>the</i> Y/N that Bell\u2019s owner frequently gushed about. And he remembered all the times he mentioned that Bell was much more playful, friendly, and kinder than she was before, having Y/N take care of her when he was busy with work. </p><p><b><i>\u201cI\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m holding you guys up,\u201d </i></b></p><p><i>\u201cNo, no it\u2019s fine. \u2018Wasn\u2019t in a rush or anything,</i>\u201d He rasps out, throat dry from the frigid weather and the unexpected company that had him twitching in his sneakers. </p><p><b><i>\u201cBell\u2019s my favorite and I think I\u2019m her favorite as well, isn\u2019t that right?\u201d</i></b> Y/N states while bumping Bell\u2019s belly lightly with her leg. The pup hums low in its throat, body leaning more into Y/N\u2019s side more than Harry. </p><p>And Harry didn\u2019t know <i>why</i> he was feeling so flushed and flustered.

The friends he has met and the vibe of the culture made him more appreciative of all the greater things in life. It was only supposed to be a two-week trip; to visit some people he already knew and maybe get inspired.</p><p>It has been two months now and Harry was jumping from place to place around the city to get all the things he needed to do done, and all he wanted to do finished since he was leaving in approximately three days. But today was a less productive day than usual so his friend had asked him to walk his Shiba dog; Bell.</p><p>He walked through the increasingly familiar streets with a leash grasped around his large hand and wrapped around his wrist while the end of the chord held the neck of Bell. She had just turned three years old, her birthday only a few days after his and they shared matching birthday hats. He got the pink foam hat, while the puppy got the blue one. His friend had shown him photos of Bell with the hat toppled overhead; almost falling off of the top and Harry couldn\u2019t help but coo at the image.</p><p>Bell was a fast walker. Her feet scampering against the damp concrete as it just rained, but the small puddles on the ground didn\u2019t stop her from briskly walking\u2013 forcing Harry to move his legs faster than his usual walking speed, but he didn\u2019t mind. He was enjoying himself, actually. The smell of fresh rain raised against his nostrils, the rawness of the scenery\u2013 the leaves of the trees were wet and a little darker\u2013 and the roads were emptier than usual from the cold. </p><p>Harry was thinking deeply about new ideas for a new song, mindlessly letting himself get pulled by Bell as if he was the one getting walked. A voice knocks him out of his thoughts. </p><p><i><b>\u201cBell? Is that you?\u201d </b></i></p><p>He usually would\u2019ve ignored it nowadays, wanting to keep a low-profile. But this time, he couldn\u2019t help but lift his head from his neck and crane it toward the sound of the voice, especially since he and Bell were the only ones occupying this street. </p><p>\u201c<b><i>Oh, it is you!</i></b>\u201d He finally finds the source of the voice and sees that it belongs to a girl, a few years younger than him. </p><p>He pauses his steps, waiting for the woman to catch up to him and Bell. His head was tilted in confusion, his grey beanie shifting more on one side of his face. A gust of wind blew suddenly, making the stray curls sway tickling his ears and it makes the girl shiver while she jogged steadily over them. </p><p>She finally reached them, pausing a bit to take a breather while pressing her hands against the tops of her thighs. She smiled at Harry and he didn\u2019t know why his heart fluttered, but it did. </p><p>\u201c<b><i>Hi, can I pet your dog?\u201d</i></b> That was the first sentence she\u2019d uttered directed at him and he blinked at her in response. The softness of her voice surprised him since this was the first time he\u2019d even heard her voice and he found that it was very different from when she was yelling from a distance. </p><p><i>\u201cDo I know you?\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cOops, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</i></b> She said, getting up from her crouched position to get to her full height. Even then, her head only reached the bottom of his chin and he found it absolutely adorable. <b><i>\u201cI\u2019m Y/N, by the way,\u201d</i></b></p><p>Harry engulfed her hand into his; it was soft and felt so fragile between his fingers. Though, he guessed that his brows were still creased in confusion since her facial expression changed when she realized that he didn\u2019t recognize her. </p><p><b><i>\u201cWell, uh no,\u201d </i></b>Y/N trailed off, watching Harry\u2019s reaction closely in case he decided to zoom. <b><i>\u201cI work at a daycare for dogs and I\u2019ve been taking care of Bell for a while,\u201d</i></b></p><p>She crouched down on a knee again when Bell barked her snout at her direction softly, rubbing the side of her nose on Y/N\u2019s calf. Her hand scratched the area between the dogs\u2019 ears, making Bell nuzzle more into her touch. </p><p>While she was busy occupying herself with the pup, Harry was left to stand temporarily fixed to figure where specifically had he heard that name before. He realized that it was <i>the</i> Y/N that Bell\u2019s owner frequently gushed about. And he remembered all the times he mentioned that Bell was much more playful, friendly, and kinder than she was before, having Y/N take care of her when he was busy with work. </p><p><b><i>\u201cI\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m holding you guys up,\u201d </i></b></p><p><i>\u201cNo, no it\u2019s fine. \u2018Wasn\u2019t in a rush or anything,</i>\u201d He rasps out, throat dry from the frigid weather and the unexpected company that had him twitching in his sneakers. </p><p><b><i>\u201cBell\u2019s my favorite and I think I\u2019m her favorite as well, isn\u2019t that right?\u201d</i></b> Y/N states while bumping Bell\u2019s belly lightly with her leg. The pup hums low in its throat, body leaning more into Y/N\u2019s side more than Harry. </p><p>And Harry didn\u2019t know <i>why</i> he was feeling so flushed and flustered. He didn\u2019t why his autonomy injected him with streams of pinkness in his cheeks, had absolutely no idea why felt so connected to her when she\u2019d only introduced herself moments ago. He was befuddled why his body craved to be closer to her but he knew it wasn\u2019t because of the chilly air caressing the hair on his legs. <i>No</i>, it was a unique occurrence and his pumping heart couldn\u2019t stop its thumping when she smiled at him and he decided that it was probably the most amazing grin he had ever encountered.</p><p>She waved at him before bidding goodbye, apologizing for the umpteenth time for her company but Harry couldn\u2019t really complain because, in that short while, he found that he thoroughly enjoyed her brief presence.</p><p>He watched as her figure became smaller because of the distance.

Even in the breaks in between the shots, you noticed the others in the band sort of teasing him about it. All you could do was smile and remain sort of mute.</p><p>However, just as quickly as the shooting started for you it was just as quick for you to be done. Time for you to get your pay and go back to working in a diner to make ends meet before you get your big break.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d a voice caught your attention, making you turn to see who it was. It was the cute shy boy. Harry was his name, you overheard the others all him.\u00a0\u201cI uh\u2026I just wanted to say it was nice to have met you.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cOh!
