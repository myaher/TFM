It didn\u2019t just reach for his throat, it also sought it\u2019s way around towards his back, as if trying to strangle him one way wasn\u2019t good enough. It wrapped around him like threads of death, intent of forcing the breath out of his lungs.</p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He let his head hang between his shoulders, fighting for oxygen.

Naturally, if he\u2019d be caught, it\u2019d be by him. The one person he could not bullshit this away from. He turned on his heel, quickly buttoning up his shirt like nothing was amiss.</p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHey, Brucie bear! What\u2019s the w-\u201d</p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cTony-\u201d Bruce looked dumbfounded, mouth slightly agape, which- in all honesty- was a deeply unnerving look on him.</p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tony knew there was no way out of this, no brilliant lie to deflect with. He deflated, relenting and let his shirt fall open, revealing the clear inky black evidence of his ruin. He looked away, unable to meet his friend\u2019s gaze, so he sensed more than saw the moment when he went from Bruce, Tony\u2019s friend, to Dr. Banner.</p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He let his glasses slide down from his forehead to his nose with a sharp jerk of his head, bending slightly to inspect the marks.</p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s the palladium, correct?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tony nodded.</p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve tried every possible replacement.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was a statement more than a question but Tony nodded just the same.</p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bruce hummed, looking contemplative for a minute, then backed up, leveling Tony with a kind smile.</p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou can\u2019t say that.

Jarvis have-.. there is <i>nothing</i>, I-\u201d</p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe will figure it out.\u201d he repeated, enunciating every word assuredly like that would make them true. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tony slumped down on the closed \u00a0toilet lid, head in his hands.</p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI have searched for months, Bruce, <i>months</i>. There is nothing, and I can\u2019t <i>think</i>, and I am tired and even my thoughts hurt and-\u201d</p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bruce placed a sympathetic hand on Tony\u2019s shoulder, squeezing lightly. It had taken them a while to get to this point of close camaraderie, but it had been worth it; having someone to work with, to build with, to take things apart and put them back together with. Bruce had been hesitant at first, not wanting to come close to anyone, afraid of the green in his soul bleeding into them and infecting them like a virus; but eventually he had not only come to trust Tony, but trust himself around another person.</p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou need to sleep, how long has it- .. when was the last time that you slept? Sleep deprivation will not exactly improve your condition.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tony sighed, a beat and defeated heavy exhale that seemed to come from his very core.</p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI need to find <i>answers</i>, Bruce, I need-\u201d</p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt can wait till tomorrow.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t-\u201d</p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201c<i>Tomorrow</i>.\u201d, he repeated, something stern creeping into his voice. And Tony slumped in his seat but allowed himself to be led out and away from his workshop, up the elevators, into his penthouse suite and into bed. Tony allowed himself a brief respite in his downward spiral; allowed himself to be cared for; just this time; just the once.</p><p>~~~</p>",
