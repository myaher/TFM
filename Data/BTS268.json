I was just kind of feeling for their energies because I&rsquo;ve never really done something for them where I could just observe their energy as it is, so I was taking full advantage of that.</p><p>More than a few cards came out between my tarot deck and my oracle deck that answered the question of how and why Namjoon was disconnected from their Source energy in the soul body (He started to question his own hand in things, started becoming too logical and too reliant on what people said and did \u2014 basically, the same thing that happened to Bang PD, why they started trusting outside companies with more than just their promotional needs.) I was kind of going back and forth with my Guides just kind of looking into how those transmissions actually were delivered, what albums between HYYH Pt1 and You Never Walk Alone did what for the Soul Group and the general public. It was all pretty cool to just sort of get\u00a0some clarification on that and see that for what it was.</p><p>Again, they are going to be sending transmissions through the &ldquo;next album&rdquo; which could be LY: Answer or whatever album comes after that. No, it does not matter that the LY: Answer album is already finished, these transmissions are not a physical thing, it&rsquo;s not something that is &ldquo;installed&rdquo; in the recording process.</p><p><b>August 28, 2018:</b> <i>I did this reading on August 18th, 2018. I can 100% confirm that LY: Answer did carry transmissions and the physical ports that were &ldquo;empty&rdquo; with the last two albums were being filled. If you didn&rsquo;t like the last two LY Albums but suddenly enjoyed this one as well as started enjoying songs from the previous albums that you didn&rsquo;t before, this is why. If you are someone who enjoyed the last two albums but did not enjoy this one, this is why.</i></p><p><i>The transmissions change the frequency output and they line up with different people. People who were brought in in 2015 with HYYH and who were activated through Wings in 2016 are going to vibe with this album more.</i></p><figure data-orig-width=\"600\" data-orig-height=\"388\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/902cd0b2053b664e9b7c99925daa97b0/tumblr_inline_pe6m8dU1ic1rxiljw_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"600\" data-orig-height=\"388\"/></figure><p>This set here came out once all together and I was like okay, got it, and put it back and shuffled it. The same exact fucking cards came out in two heaps and the top of the deck had the Truth Be Told card, which for me is the card that is like, &ldquo;You better listen to this.&rdquo;</p><p>New Life and Yin are referencing the transformation you might notice over the next year or so with the guys, reconnecting back to the Divine Feminine and that Water energy. I talked about it in the original Outlook reading how the entire world is currently experiencing an ascension and that the Divine Feminine is going to be &ldquo;awakened&rdquo; for a lot of people, or in their case, &ldquo;re-awakened.&rdquo; This will be seen in the combo of Serendipity and Deep Knowing.</p><p>This combo is the intuitive knowing that all of them, but especially Namjoon, will have when it comes to their music now that they are reconnected to their Source energy and are now able to put out those frequencies into the 3D plane. I&rsquo;ve mentioned it in an ask that they will not be aware of this shift, but they will have a sudden sense of needing to do more, Namjoon will have more of a need to speak out and write more. They will have a hand in their music even more \u2014 this will all just seem to flow naturally, it&rsquo;s not going to be something that we notice if we aren&rsquo;t really paying attention.</p><p>It all ends with No Place Like Home. Again, it will all flow very naturally into a place where it&rsquo;s very seamless, everything will just come together. Things won&rsquo;t be as mixed up or confusing as they are right now with their music or how they are going about their career. Everything will just be settled and they will feel that and the massive amount of people in their Soul Group will feel that as well. I also mentioned that the first set of transmissions put out are going to be for those that were brought in with HYYH pt1 in 2015. That doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s going to be the same genre of music, the same vibe, or anything like that at all. It just means you&rsquo;re going to connect with it, you will feel something with it that you weren&rsquo;t able to feel with the what has come out so far with the LY series.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"600\" data-orig-height=\"357\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6e57ce2c05cc840f5b0cb8e991e3b361/tumblr_inline_pe6m9mDF9r1rxiljw_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"600\" data-orig-height=\"357\"/></figure><p>Blessed came out for the first paragraph where they talk about the awards won in that time with HYYH and their general success at that time. Lol, I asked why they were blessed here and the fucking card Why? came out and under it was Higher Power card like, <i>\u201cbitch, do you have to ask??\u201d</i> They weren&rsquo;t in full action, as in they all weren&rsquo;t fully aligned with their HS just yet, but they were being guided as they should have been. That slow build up, those struggles they went through before they broke the glass ceiling in Kpop, that was all planned and necessary. They needed to grow slowly to avoid our modern culture shit where people that blow up quickly tend to burn out just as fast. It was all intentional and necessary.</p><p>Truth Be Told and Serendipity \u2014 Apparently the Steve Aoki collaboration wasn&rsquo;t preplanned or anything, it was by pure chance that they came together and it worked out beautifully in terms of boosting their popularity.</p><p>I tried to get a feel for their time before debut, like before they were altogether officially, but there was nothing there. Now that I think about it, they may have ascended timelines now. Most people are with the ascension process, I&rsquo;ve done it already. Some of you might have as well. You&rsquo;ll know if there are certain things in your past, good or bad, that you just don&rsquo;t think about anymore like you used to a year or so ago, or you can&rsquo;t remember them clearly, or you can but it doesn&rsquo;t feel like it happened to you.\u00a0</p><p>I&rsquo;m 99% sure that&rsquo;s what was going on here. In terms of energy and soul, the\u00a0time before they were together officially does not exist or affect them. They remember it, it happened, but it has no influence on them now as the energy signatures from that time are on a separate level of space and time, and are no longer attached to them.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"600\" data-orig-height=\"638\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/15629ead9a662ec6364b9ab80c109dbf/tumblr_inline_pe6mdcYJFN1rxiljw_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"600\" data-orig-height=\"638\"/></figure><p>The outlook collectively for the group is found within No Place Like Home, Poised, Deep Knowing, Serendipity, and The Fates.</p><p>The No Place Like Home means just the same as in the beginning. Things are just going to settle in with them consciously as their HS settle back into the soul body. Things will be a bit more refined and done up in a way that is more in line with what people expect from a group like BTS. That Deep Knowing is there again \u2014 they will have an understanding of what they need to do, but it won&rsquo;t be some grand breakthrough or massive shift. Things will fall together like Serendipity, just seeming like it happens by chance, but it will be controlled by fate, as they are back in line now, back on their rightful path and such.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"700\" data-orig-height=\"1003\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/74c6b61478f2f48494b93a257718d873/tumblr_inline_pe6megJagq1rxiljw_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"700\" data-orig-height=\"1003\"/></figure><ul><li>The Hanged Man - <b>Namjoon</b> (Leader, 1994, Virgo)<br/></li><li>3 of Pentacles - <b>Jin</b> (1992, Sagittarius)<br/></li><li>The World - <b>Yoongi</b> (1993, Pisces)<br/></li><li>Ace of Pentacles - <b>Hoseok</b> (1994, Aquarius)<br/></li><li>Ace of Wands + 3 of Cups - <b>Jimin</b> (1995, Libra)<br/></li><li>Ace of Swords + The Chariot - <b>Taehyung</b> (1995, Capricorn)<br/></li><li>Page of Wands - <b>Kook</b> (1997, Virgo)<br/></li></ul><p><b>The Hanged Man: </b>Namjoon is the image of the Hanged Man as it correlates with his position in the Soul Body. He is the head, he is the crown chakra, and he is the midway point between their Source Energy and the rest of the alchemic process that takes place within the Soul Body between the 7 energy centers. This is the philosophical shit that you all love to make fun of him for, this is what he contributes to the group energy. The expansive and contemplative vibe. If you were to look at BTS as a power cord for their Soul Group and the general public in the shift, Namjoon would be the actual plug that connects to the outlet.</p><p><b>3 of Pentacles:</b> Jin is in the background and that matches his core energy (read his Elemental Alignment to know what I&rsquo;m talking about). He&rsquo;s a balancer IRL as he is in the Soul Body, just like Jimin is. He is more in the \u201ccollaborative\u201d realm where he exists between two people at a time \u2014 he exists in the lines of their connections. This is how he brings balance to them. If you look at the image on the card there are 2 people looking on and up at the individual showing them how things are going with the work he is doing. If you take the meaning of the card out, you see Jin pointing out the connections of the other members, telling them how they balance. This is something he does for real in real life, just not as blatant. This is how he keeps balance \u2014 he understands the connections between them.</p><p><b>The World:</b> Yoongi is The World. \u00a0In his Elemental Alignment reading, I talked about how he has seen the perfect world and is able to speak shit into existence as he is, in fact, on that Pisces shit. This is it. He not only contributes to the &ldquo;ends of the earth&rdquo; sort of goal-oriented mindset of the entire group, but he&rsquo;s literally what brings in a lot of what they ask for. This isn\u2019t really noticed though. This contribution is very separate from the others and I\u2019ve mentioned before how he is extremely aware of things beyond the 3D and beyond on the physical shit, but he doesn&rsquo;t actually communicate it with anyone. This is kind of that vibe here. He is literally connected to and delivering The World to them, but it\u2019s like he wraps it up and forgets to sign the card so no one knows he\u2019s the one doing it. Such a Pisces&hellip;</p><p><b>Ace of Pentacles</b>: Hoseok is the Ace of Pentacles. Again, this is based on his placement in the Soul Body and his general core energy. I spoke about that connection in his Elemental Alignment reading as well as the Update reading following the Soul Body healing. The Ace of Pentacles is representative of his Divine Connection to the physical plain, to the Earth and other celestial bodies. It\u2019s stability and filtration in the very center of all the other cards. He is the one that brings people back down to earth, gets people out of their minds and into their hands and feet. He grounds everyone even when he himself is floating off and extremely unstable.</p><p><b>Ace of Wands + 3 of Cups:</b> Jimin is the Ace of Wands and the 3 of Cups. The 3 of Cups is what I was expecting of him, but the Ace of Wands threw me off until I pulled for Kook, lol. To the group specifically, he acts as the 3 of Cups to juxtapose Jin&rsquo;s 3 of Pentacles. In the soul body and in terms of unconscious awareness, Jin can see the lines between the other members (and everyone in the world actually, lol) while Jimin can see the individual themselves. Jin is the collaboration or the connecting of the lines, whereas Jimin is the coming together as individuals where each person has their own cup or is carrying their own core. He also has an ability to reflect others, show them their real selves, which is why they feel so comfortable around him \u2014 they can do nothing but be open, honest, and real with him. Even Taehyung \u2014 in his Elemental Alignment reading he had a face for everyone except Jimin.</p><p><b>Ace of Swords + The Chariot: </b>Taehyung confuses me and I&rsquo;m still not into dipping in on his energy just yet, but he has the Ace of Swords and The Chariot. This is his mental shit and how he contributes that \u201cout there/4D\u201d vibe or whatever the fuck people get so pissy about when someone mentions it. I said before in a mini-reading or an ask that Taehyung is the one to encourage others to think beyond what is known as fact and what can be understood with the 5 senses. This is that energy. The intellectual mind experiencing a breakthrough and just running with it. That\u2019s who he is and that is what he contributes to the group \u2014 complete freedom in communication and creation.</p><p><b>Page of Wands:</b> Jungkook is the Page of Wands and I think anyone could have guessed that. This is just the epitome of the whole &ldquo;Golden Maknae&rdquo; kind of shit and it reflects is placement in the Soul Body as well, so whatever, I won\u2019t even explain it, lol. What interested me the most is that in the spread with the way I laid everything out, the Page&rsquo;s Wand lines up with Jimin&rsquo;s Ace of Wands, like the two wands in the images connect to each other. Not only that, but the fucking Page is literally looking up at the Ace of Wands. Basically, in group terms, their energetic connection affects the balance of the group. This makes sense because Jimin\u2019s personal balance (and Kook\u2019s too, I guess?) relies on this relationship, and since Jimin is a literal balancer in the Soul Body, that stable connection is necessary for them and for the group.</p><p><b>August 28, 2018: </b>Overall, their energy as a group is balanced and in good shape. I did a couple of readings like this for them prior to the Soul Body Healing and, trust me, it did not look like this, lol. Things are leveling back out really well within the Soul Body and their unconscious minds have already reconnected as well as the subconscious mind. I thought it was going to happen a lot slower than what it has, but everything seems in working order.</p><p><b><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fshop%2FBlueMoonPunch&amp;t=MmYxMGM2MGVmZmU0MTUyYzk4YTIyNDIwOTU3N2IwMDEyNDEzZDk5NCxSRGZNYXpOaQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AQqgMv00BrQNDsOL8dkK7Jg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fbluemoonpunch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F174980405893%2Fthe-elemental-alignment-of-kim-seokjin-oracle&amp;m=1\"><br/>SHOP</a> | <a href=\"http://mopoglo.tumblr.com/\">MAIN BLOG</a> | <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fbluemoonpunch%2F&amp;t=MjM2NjhmNzYzY2VmMjI0YWE3NzhjMWQyMzE4ZDRjOTFkNDM4ODJjMyxSRGZNYXpOaQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AQqgMv00BrQNDsOL8dkK7Jg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fbluemoonpunch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F174980405893%2Fthe-elemental-alignment-of-kim-seokjin-oracle&amp;m=1\">INSTA</a> | <a href=\"https://bluemoonpunch.tumblr.com/post/176169780918/idolcelebrity-readings-list\">MORE BTS READINGS</a></b><br/></p>",

He is the head, he is the crown chakra, and he is the midway point between their Source Energy and the rest of the alchemic process that takes place within the Soul Body between the 7 energy centers. This is the philosophical shit that you all love to make fun of him for, this is what he contributes to the group energy. The expansive and contemplative vibe. If you were to look at BTS as a power cord for their Soul Group and the general public in the shift, Namjoon would be the actual plug that connects to the outlet.</p><p><b>3 of Pentacles:</b> Jin is in the background and that matches his core energy (read his Elemental Alignment to know what I\u2019m talking about). He\u2019s a balancer IRL as he is in the Soul Body, just like Jimin is. He is more in the \u201ccollaborative\u201d realm where he exists between two people at a time \u2014 he exists in the lines of their connections. This is how he brings balance to them. If you look at the image on the card there are 2 people looking on and up at the individual showing them how things are going with the work he is doing. If you take the meaning of the card out, you see Jin pointing out the connections of the other members, telling them how they balance. This is something he does for real in real life, just not as blatant. This is how he keeps balance \u2014 he understands the connections between them.</p><p><b>The World:</b> Yoongi is The World. \u00a0In his Elemental Alignment reading, I talked about how he has seen the perfect world and is able to speak shit into existence as he is, in fact, on that Pisces shit. This is it. He not only contributes to the \u201cends of the earth\u201d sort of goal-oriented mindset of the entire group, but he\u2019s literally what brings in a lot of what they ask for. This isn\u2019t really noticed though. This contribution is very separate from the others and I\u2019ve mentioned before how he is extremely aware of things beyond the 3D and beyond on the physical shit, but he doesn\u2019t actually communicate it with anyone. This is kind of that vibe here. He is literally connected to and delivering The World to them, but it\u2019s like he wraps it up and forgets to sign the card so no one knows he\u2019s the one doing it. Such a Pisces\u2026</p><p><b>Ace of Pentacles</b>: Hoseok is the Ace of Pentacles. Again, this is based on his placement in the Soul Body and his general core energy. I spoke about that connection in his Elemental Alignment reading as well as the Update reading following the Soul Body healing. The Ace of Pentacles is representative of his Divine Connection to the physical plain, to the Earth and other celestial bodies. It\u2019s stability and filtration in the very center of all the other cards. He is the one that brings people back down to earth, gets people out of their minds and into their hands and feet. He grounds everyone even when he himself is floating off and extremely unstable.</p><p><b>Ace of Wands + 3 of Cups:</b> Jimin is the Ace of Wands and the 3 of Cups. The 3 of Cups is what I was expecting of him, but the Ace of Wands threw me off until I pulled for Kook, lol. To the group specifically, he acts as the 3 of Cups to juxtapose Jin\u2019s 3 of Pentacles. In the soul body and in terms of unconscious awareness, Jin can see the lines between the other members (and everyone in the world actually, lol) while Jimin can see the individual themselves. Jin is the collaboration or the connecting of the lines, whereas Jimin is the coming together as individuals where each person has their own cup or is carrying their own core. He also has an ability to reflect others, show them their real selves, which is why they feel so comfortable around him \u2014 they can do nothing but be open, honest, and real with him. Even Taehyung \u2014 in his Elemental Alignment reading he had a face for everyone except Jimin.</p><p><b>Ace of Swords + The Chariot: </b>Taehyung confuses me and I\u2019m still not into dipping in on his energy just yet, but he has the Ace of Swords and The Chariot. This is his mental shit and how he contributes that \u201cout there/4D\u201d vibe or whatever the fuck people get so pissy about when someone mentions it. I said before in a mini-reading or an ask that Taehyung is the one to encourage others to think beyond what is known as fact and what can be understood with the 5 senses. This is that energy. The intellectual mind experiencing a breakthrough and just running with it. That\u2019s who he is and that is what he contributes to the group \u2014 complete freedom in communication and creation.</p><p><b>Page of Wands:</b> Jungkook is the Page of Wands and I think anyone could have guessed that. This is just the epitome of the whole \u201cGolden Maknae\u201d kind of shit and it reflects is placement in the Soul Body as well, so whatever, I won\u2019t even explain it, lol. What interested me the most is that in the spread with the way I laid everything out, the Page\u2019s Wand lines up with Jimin\u2019s Ace of Wands, like the two wands in the images connect to each other. Not only that, but the fucking Page is literally looking up at the Ace of Wands. Basically, in group terms, their energetic connection affects the balance of the group. This makes sense because Jimin\u2019s personal balance (and Kook\u2019s too, I guess?) relies on this relationship, and since Jimin is a literal balancer in the Soul Body, that stable connection is necessary for them and for the group.</p><p><b>August 28, 2018: </b>Overall, their energy as a group is balanced and in good shape. I did a couple of readings like this for them prior to the Soul Body Healing and, trust me, it did not look like this, lol. Things are leveling back out really well within the Soul Body and their unconscious minds have already reconnected as well as the subconscious mind. I thought it was going to happen a lot slower than what it has, but everything seems in working order.</p><p><b><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fshop%2FBlueMoonPunch&amp;t=MmYxMGM2MGVmZmU0MTUyYzk4YTIyNDIwOTU3N2IwMDEyNDEzZDk5NCxSRGZNYXpOaQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AQqgMv00BrQNDsOL8dkK7Jg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fbluemoonpunch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F174980405893%2Fthe-elemental-alignment-of-kim-seokjin-oracle&amp;m=1\"><br>SHOP</a> | <a href=\"http://mopoglo.tumblr.com/\">MAIN BLOG</a> | <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fbluemoonpunch%2F&amp;t=MjM2NjhmNzYzY2VmMjI0YWE3NzhjMWQyMzE4ZDRjOTFkNDM4ODJjMyxSRGZNYXpOaQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AQqgMv00BrQNDsOL8dkK7Jg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fbluemoonpunch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F174980405893%2Fthe-elemental-alignment-of-kim-seokjin-oracle&amp;m=1\">INSTA</a> | <a href=\"https://bluemoonpunch.tumblr.com/post/176169780918/idolcelebrity-readings-list\">MORE BTS READINGS</a></b><br></p></p>",

I then followed that up with pulling a card for each member to gauge their individual energy lines that link into the groups projected energy. In order to do the first segment of the reading I read the beginning summary on their Wikipedia page, and then for the individual members I looked at their profiles on the kprofiles website where I focused on their stage names, real names, positions in the group, the year they were born, and their zodiac signs.]</i></p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"553\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/19492d2358ecf0eab725c0d22237ae6a/tumblr_inline_pe6m5gN4NC1rxiljw_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"553\"></figure><p><b>THIS READING WAS DONE August 18, 2018</b></p><p><b>-full reading with photos under the cut-</b></p>[[MORE]]<p>I was shuffling cards while watching dance practices, going back and forth between songs that I knew carried transmissions and the ones that didn\u2019t. I was just kind of feeling for their energies because I\u2019ve never really done something for them where I could just observe their energy as it is, so I was taking full advantage of that.</p><p>More than a few cards came out between my tarot deck and my oracle deck that answered the question of how and why Namjoon was disconnected from their Source energy in the soul body (He started to question his own hand in things, started becoming too logical and too reliant on what people said and did \u2014 basically, the same thing that happened to Bang PD, why they started trusting outside companies with more than just their promotional needs.) I was kind of going back and forth with my Guides just kind of looking into how those transmissions actually were delivered, what albums between HYYH Pt1 and You Never Walk Alone did what for the Soul Group and the general public. It was all pretty cool to just sort of get\u00a0some clarification on that and see that for what it was.</p><p>Again, they are going to be sending transmissions through the \u201cnext album\u201d which could be LY: Answer or whatever album comes after that. No, it does not matter that the LY: Answer album is already finished, these transmissions are not a physical thing, it\u2019s not something that is \u201cinstalled\u201d in the recording process.</p><p><b>August 28, 2018:</b> <i>I did this reading on August 18th, 2018. I can 100% confirm that LY: Answer did carry transmissions and the physical ports that were \u201cempty\u201d with the last two albums were being filled.

He is the head, he is the crown chakra, and he is the midway point between their Source Energy and the rest of the alchemic process that takes place within the Soul Body between the 7 energy centers. This is the philosophical shit that you all love to make fun of him for, this is what he contributes to the group energy. The expansive and contemplative vibe. If you were to look at BTS as a power cord for their Soul Group and the general public in the shift, Namjoon would be the actual plug that connects to the outlet.</p><p><b>3 of Pentacles:</b> Jin is in the background and that matches his core energy (read his Elemental Alignment to know what I\u2019m talking about). He\u2019s a balancer IRL as he is in the Soul Body, just like Jimin is. He is more in the \u201ccollaborative\u201d realm where he exists between two people at a time \u2014 he exists in the lines of their connections. This is how he brings balance to them. If you look at the image on the card there are 2 people looking on and up at the individual showing them how things are going with the work he is doing. If you take the meaning of the card out, you see Jin pointing out the connections of the other members, telling them how they balance. This is something he does for real in real life, just not as blatant. This is how he keeps balance \u2014 he understands the connections between them.</p><p><b>The World:</b> Yoongi is The World. \u00a0In his Elemental Alignment reading, I talked about how he has seen the perfect world and is able to speak shit into existence as he is, in fact, on that Pisces shit. This is it. He not only contributes to the \u201cends of the earth\u201d sort of goal-oriented mindset of the entire group, but he\u2019s literally what brings in a lot of what they ask for. This isn\u2019t really noticed though. This contribution is very separate from the others and I\u2019ve mentioned before how he is extremely aware of things beyond the 3D and beyond on the physical shit, but he doesn\u2019t actually communicate it with anyone. This is kind of that vibe here. He is literally connected to and delivering The World to them, but it\u2019s like he wraps it up and forgets to sign the card so no one knows he\u2019s the one doing it. Such a Pisces\u2026</p><p><b>Ace of Pentacles</b>: Hoseok is the Ace of Pentacles. Again, this is based on his placement in the Soul Body and his general core energy. I spoke about that connection in his Elemental Alignment reading as well as the Update reading following the Soul Body healing. The Ace of Pentacles is representative of his Divine Connection to the physical plain, to the Earth and other celestial bodies. It\u2019s stability and filtration in the very center of all the other cards. He is the one that brings people back down to earth, gets people out of their minds and into their hands and feet. He grounds everyone even when he himself is floating off and extremely unstable.</p><p><b>Ace of Wands + 3 of Cups:</b> Jimin is the Ace of Wands and the 3 of Cups. The 3 of Cups is what I was expecting of him, but the Ace of Wands threw me off until I pulled for Kook, lol. To the group specifically, he acts as the 3 of Cups to juxtapose Jin\u2019s 3 of Pentacles. In the soul body and in terms of unconscious awareness, Jin can see the lines between the other members (and everyone in the world actually, lol) while Jimin can see the individual themselves. Jin is the collaboration or the connecting of the lines, whereas Jimin is the coming together as individuals where each person has their own cup or is carrying their own core. He also has an ability to reflect others, show them their real selves, which is why they feel so comfortable around him \u2014 they can do nothing but be open, honest, and real with him. Even Taehyung \u2014 in his Elemental Alignment reading he had a face for everyone except Jimin.</p><p><b>Ace of Swords + The Chariot: </b>Taehyung confuses me and I\u2019m still not into dipping in on his energy just yet, but he has the Ace of Swords and The Chariot. This is his mental shit and how he contributes that \u201cout there/4D\u201d vibe or whatever the fuck people get so pissy about when someone mentions it. I said before in a mini-reading or an ask that Taehyung is the one to encourage others to think beyond what is known as fact and what can be understood with the 5 senses. This is that energy. The intellectual mind experiencing a breakthrough and just running with it. That\u2019s who he is and that is what he contributes to the group \u2014 complete freedom in communication and creation.</p><p><b>Page of Wands:</b> Jungkook is the Page of Wands and I think anyone could have guessed that. This is just the epitome of the whole \u201cGolden Maknae\u201d kind of shit and it reflects is placement in the Soul Body as well, so whatever, I won\u2019t even explain it, lol. What interested me the most is that in the spread with the way I laid everything out, the Page\u2019s Wand lines up with Jimin\u2019s Ace of Wands, like the two wands in the images connect to each other. Not only that, but the fucking Page is literally looking up at the Ace of Wands. Basically, in group terms, their energetic connection affects the balance of the group. This makes sense because Jimin\u2019s personal balance (and Kook\u2019s too, I guess?) relies on this relationship, and since Jimin is a literal balancer in the Soul Body, that stable connection is necessary for them and for the group.</p><p><b>August 28, 2018: </b>Overall, their energy as a group is balanced and in good shape. I did a couple of readings like this for them prior to the Soul Body Healing and, trust me, it did not look like this, lol. Things are leveling back out really well within the Soul Body and their unconscious minds have already reconnected as well as the subconscious mind. I thought it was going to happen a lot slower than what it has, but everything seems in working order.</p><p><b><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fshop%2FBlueMoonPunch&amp;t=MmYxMGM2MGVmZmU0MTUyYzk4YTIyNDIwOTU3N2IwMDEyNDEzZDk5NCxSRGZNYXpOaQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AQqgMv00BrQNDsOL8dkK7Jg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fbluemoonpunch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F174980405893%2Fthe-elemental-alignment-of-kim-seokjin-oracle&amp;m=1\"><br>SHOP</a> | <a href=\"http://mopoglo.tumblr.com/\">MAIN BLOG</a> | <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fbluemoonpunch%2F&amp;t=MjM2NjhmNzYzY2VmMjI0YWE3NzhjMWQyMzE4ZDRjOTFkNDM4ODJjMyxSRGZNYXpOaQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AQqgMv00BrQNDsOL8dkK7Jg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fbluemoonpunch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F174980405893%2Fthe-elemental-alignment-of-kim-seokjin-oracle&amp;m=1\">INSTA</a> | <a href=\"https://bluemoonpunch.tumblr.com/post/176169780918/idolcelebrity-readings-list\">MORE BTS READINGS</a></b><br></p></p>",
                "content": "<p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p><i>[A group energy reading for the kpop group BTS, officially debuted in 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment. For this reading, I focused on the group&rsquo;s energy leading up to their debut and did a small predictive reading of what you can expect to see of them through the rest of 2018 and into 2019. I then followed that up with pulling a card for each member to gauge their individual energy lines that link into the groups projected energy. In order to do the first segment of the reading I read the beginning summary on their Wikipedia page, and then for the individual members I looked at their profiles on the kprofiles website where I focused on their stage names, real names, positions in the group, the year they were born, and their zodiac signs.]</i></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/19492d2358ecf0eab725c0d22237ae6a/tumblr_inline_pe6m5gN4NC1rxiljw_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><b>THIS READING WAS DONE August 18, 2018</b></p><p><b>-full reading with photos under the cut-</b></p><p>I was shuffling cards while watching dance practices, going back and forth between songs that I knew carried transmissions and the ones that didn&rsquo;t. I was just kind of feeling for their energies because I&rsquo;ve never really done something for them where I could just observe their energy as it is, so I was taking full advantage of that.</p><p>More than a few cards came out between my tarot deck and my oracle deck that answered the question of how and why Namjoon was disconnected from their Source energy in the soul body (He started to question his own hand in things, started becoming too logical and too reliant on what people said and did &mdash; basically, the same thing that happened to Bang PD, why they started trusting outside companies with more than just their promotional needs.) I was kind of going back and forth with my Guides just kind of looking into how those transmissions actually were delivered, what albums between HYYH Pt1 and You Never Walk Alone did what for the Soul Group and the general public. It was all pretty cool to just sort of get&nbsp;some clarification on that and see that for what it was.</p><p>Again, they are going to be sending transmissions through the &ldquo;next album&rdquo; which could be LY: Answer or whatever album comes after that. No, it does not matter that the LY: Answer album is already finished, these transmissions are not a physical thing, it&rsquo;s not something that is &ldquo;installed&rdquo; in the recording process.</p><p><b>August 28, 2018:</b> <i>I did this reading on August 18th, 2018. I can 100% confirm that LY: Answer did carry transmissions and the physical ports that were &ldquo;empty&rdquo; with the last two albums were being filled. If you didn&rsquo;t like the last two LY Albums but suddenly enjoyed this one as well as started enjoying songs from the previous albums that you didn&rsquo;t before, this is why. If you are someone who enjoyed the last two albums but did not enjoy this one, this is why.</i></p><p><i>The transmissions change the frequency output and they line up with different people. People who were brought in in 2015 with HYYH and who were activated through Wings in 2016 are going to vibe with this album more.</i></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/902cd0b2053b664e9b7c99925daa97b0/tumblr_inline_pe6m8dU1ic1rxiljw_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>This set here came out once all together and I was like okay, got it, and put it back and shuffled it. The same exact fucking cards came out in two heaps and the top of the deck had the Truth Be Told card, which for me is the card that is like, &ldquo;You better listen to this.&rdquo;</p><p>New Life and Yin are referencing the transformation you might notice over the next year or so with the guys, reconnecting back to the Divine Feminine and that Water energy. I talked about it in the original Outlook reading how the entire world is currently experiencing an ascension and that the Divine Feminine is going to be &ldquo;awakened&rdquo; for a lot of people, or in their case, &ldquo;re-awakened.&rdquo; This will be seen in the combo of Serendipity and Deep Knowing.</p><p>This combo is the intuitive knowing that all of them, but especially Namjoon, will have when it comes to their music now that they are reconnected to their Source energy and are now able to put out those frequencies into the 3D plane. I&rsquo;ve mentioned it in an ask that they will not be aware of this shift, but they will have a sudden sense of needing to do more, Namjoon will have more of a need to speak out and write more. They will have a hand in their music even more &mdash; this will all just seem to flow naturally, it&rsquo;s not going to be something that we notice if we aren&rsquo;t really paying attention.</p><p>It all ends with No Place Like Home. Again, it will all flow very naturally into a place where it&rsquo;s very seamless, everything will just come together. Things won&rsquo;t be as mixed up or confusing as they are right now with their music or how they are going about their career. Everything will just be settled and they will feel that and the massive amount of people in their Soul Group will feel that as well. I also mentioned that the first set of transmissions put out are going to be for those that were brought in with HYYH pt1 in 2015. That doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s going to be the same genre of music, the same vibe, or anything like that at all. It just means you&rsquo;re going to connect with it, you will feel something with it that you weren&rsquo;t able to feel with the what has come out so far with the LY series.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6e57ce2c05cc840f5b0cb8e991e3b361/tumblr_inline_pe6m9mDF9r1rxiljw_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Blessed came out for the first paragraph where they talk about the awards won in that time with HYYH and their general success at that time. Lol, I asked why they were blessed here and the fucking card Why? came out and under it was Higher Power card like, <i>&ldquo;bitch, do you have to ask??&rdquo;</i> They weren&rsquo;t in full action, as in they all weren&rsquo;t fully aligned with their HS just yet, but they were being guided as they should have been. That slow build up, those struggles they went through before they broke the glass ceiling in Kpop, that was all planned and necessary. They needed to grow slowly to avoid our modern culture shit where people that blow up quickly tend to burn out just as fast. It was all intentional and necessary.</p><p>Truth Be Told and Serendipity &mdash; Apparently the Steve Aoki collaboration wasn&rsquo;t preplanned or anything, it was by pure chance that they came together and it worked out beautifully in terms of boosting their popularity.</p><p>I tried to get a feel for their time before debut, like before they were altogether officially, but there was nothing there. Now that I think about it, they may have ascended timelines now. Most people are with the ascension process, I&rsquo;ve done it already. Some of you might have as well. You&rsquo;ll know if there are certain things in your past, good or bad, that you just don&rsquo;t think about anymore like you used to a year or so ago, or you can&rsquo;t remember them clearly, or you can but it doesn&rsquo;t feel like it happened to you.&nbsp;</p><p>I&rsquo;m 99% sure that&rsquo;s what was going on here. In terms of energy and soul, the&nbsp;time before they were together officially does not exist or affect them. They remember it, it happened, but it has no influence on them now as the energy signatures from that time are on a separate level of space and time, and are no longer attached to them.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/15629ead9a662ec6364b9ab80c109dbf/tumblr_inline_pe6mdcYJFN1rxiljw_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>The outlook collectively for the group is found within No Place Like Home, Poised, Deep Knowing, Serendipity, and The Fates.</p><p>The No Place Like Home means just the same as in the beginning. Things are just going to settle in with them consciously as their HS settle back into the soul body. Things will be a bit more refined and done up in a way that is more in line with what people expect from a group like BTS. That Deep Knowing is there again &mdash; they will have an understanding of what they need to do, but it won&rsquo;t be some grand breakthrough or massive shift. Things will fall together like Serendipity, just seeming like it happens by chance, but it will be controlled by fate, as they are back in line now, back on their rightful path and such.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/74c6b61478f2f48494b93a257718d873/tumblr_inline_pe6megJagq1rxiljw_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><ul><li>The Hanged Man - <b>Namjoon</b> (Leader, 1994, Virgo)<br /></li><li>3 of Pentacles - <b>Jin</b> (1992, Sagittarius)<br /></li><li>The World - <b>Yoongi</b> (1993, Pisces)<br /></li><li>Ace of Pentacles - <b>Hoseok</b> (1994, Aquarius)<br /></li><li>Ace of Wands + 3 of Cups - <b>Jimin</b> (1995, Libra)<br /></li><li>Ace of Swords + The Chariot - <b>Taehyung</b> (1995, Capricorn)<br /></li><li>Page of Wands - <b>Kook</b> (1997, Virgo)<br /></li></ul><p><b>The Hanged Man: </b>Namjoon is the image of the Hanged Man as it correlates with his position in the Soul Body.

                "content": "<p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>You sighed as you looked out the window of the limo you were riding in.&nbsp;&lsquo;Out of all the days to be out, he has to pick the day its raining to have this meeting?&rsquo; You thought to yourself as you hummed to a song on the radio.&nbsp;</p><p>You were the princess of Busan, your father being the king. He owned every part of Busan and then part of Seoul. You didn&rsquo;t like the publicity, you didn&rsquo;t like the attention, you didn&rsquo;t like being treated differently. You just wanted a normal life.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re here, Princess.&rdquo; The driver said as he stopped in front of the BigHit building. As soon as you pulled up, reporters and news anchors started swarming around the car, leaving you to groan and stare out the window. You&rsquo;re two security guards, Namjoon and Yoongi got out and opened your door, you getting out and shutting the door. The two helped you push pass the crowd, but you were able to hear the questions.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you ready for such a big step?&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you think will happen after you two are wedded?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you and Jimin plan to have kids?&rdquo;</p><p>You were confused, not understanding what they meant. You walked in and got led into the room where your father, Hitman Bang, and another boy were.&nbsp;&ldquo;My Flower!&rdquo; Your father yelled as he walked towards you, embracing you tightly.&nbsp;&ldquo;hello, Father.&rdquo; you said as you bowed your head at him. You then looked at the other two, bowing your head as well. As you looked between the three, you noticed they all had&nbsp; black suits and teal ties on. There was a color scheme here, and all you were wearing was a light emerald dress with black wedges.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I am glad you joined us.&rdquo; Hitman Bang said as he bowed his head at you.&nbsp;&ldquo;This is the prince of Seoul, Park Jimin.&rdquo; Jimin bowed his head as he looked me, forcing a smile. Anyone could tell he felt just as uncomfortable as you did.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;We are here to talk about something important.&rdquo; Father said as you sat down beside him, looking lost. Jimin looked just as lost as you did, so that means he didn&rsquo;t know why you two were here.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;we believe it would be better for the&nbsp;&lsquo;kingdom&rsquo; if you and Jimin got married.&rdquo; Your father said, looking at you and Jimin. Both of your jaws fell. You thought Jimin looked like a player and never wanted to commit to anything. Jimin thought you were a spoiled brat who always got what she wanted, just by looking at each other, you can tell that you didn&rsquo;t like each other at all.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, what?&rdquo; You said as you stood up.&nbsp;&ldquo;You want me to get married to someone I just barely met? For what?&rdquo; You were a lot of emotions,&nbsp; angry and upset the two main ones.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, you&rsquo;re of age, and im not going to live forever. Please do this.&rdquo; You&rsquo;re father said, holding your hand. You sighed and looked at him, nodding your head with a sad look upon your face. Jimin watched you, a part of him kind of dying as he saw the look on your face, but he shook it off.&nbsp;&ldquo;When is the wedding?&rdquo; You both asked, looking at each other then at the two adult males.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;The beginning of Winter.&rdquo; Father said, causing you to look down.&nbsp;</p><p>You and Jimin just had one thing on your mind, and that was to make everyone happy, even if it meant hurting yourselves.&nbsp;</p></p>",
