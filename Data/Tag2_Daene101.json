Dany even tries to stop him by letting him take her eggs but that doesn\u2019t stop him. There is no way Drogo can allow this to go unpunished. It would make him look too weak.

Even in the initial episodes of season 1, even after being raped she does not fully understand this. And here\u2019s the kicker. The thing is that Viserys wasn\u2019t even fully mad at this juncture. He may have been going in that direction, but he still had much of his faculties about him. But he still treated her like this. He wasn\u2019t just an abusive brother who still cared for her in some way. He didn\u2019t care for her at all. Emilia has said in an interview that when he threatens her and her baby, all the affection she has left for him goes away too. And yet we see later that she still names a dragon after him. She never had anyone else. She says he was good to her once. And yet the descriptions we sometimes hear of her childhood don\u2019t seem to present him as loving either (e.g. twisting her hair for saying she wanted to be a sailor).

Jorah sees his wife in her and seems to want to isolate her from anyone and anything else, make her dependent on just him, like Littlefinger with Sansa. Daario is more interested in her as a conquest. Drogo was basically a master. Viserys\u2019 \u2018love\u2019 for her may be no more than Dany\u2019s own projection and imagination.

Even in the initial episodes of season 1, even after being raped she does not fully understand this. And here\u2019s the kicker. The thing is that Viserys wasn\u2019t even fully mad at this juncture. He may have been going in that direction, but he still had much of his faculties about him. But he still treated her like this. He wasn\u2019t just an abusive brother who still cared for her in some way. He didn\u2019t care for her at all. Emilia has said in an interview that when he threatens her and her baby, all the affection she has left for him goes away too. And yet we see later that she still names a dragon after him. She never had anyone else. She says he was good to her once. And yet the descriptions we sometimes hear of her childhood don\u2019t seem to present him as loving either (e.g. twisting her hair for saying she wanted to be a sailor). But what else did she have?</p><p>Almost every expression of\u00a0\u2018love\u2019 that she has seen so far is screwed up in some way. Every single one. Jorah sees his wife in her and seems to want to isolate her from anyone and anything else, make her dependent on just him, like Littlefinger with Sansa. Daario is more interested in her as a conquest. Drogo was basically a master. Viserys\u2019 \u2018love\u2019 for her may be no more than Dany\u2019s own projection and imagination.

                "content": "<p><hr /><p>Hi Anon,</p><p>You&rsquo;re definitely not the first one to feel this way. I suspect that perhaps they weren&rsquo;t very clear in their portrayal of things in the show. Even then, there is quite enough if you watch Dany&rsquo;s arc carefully. The whole problem with Viserys was given a fairly detailed treatment by <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/me0ia9AS76vMZnm5qiSWLmA\">@mhysaofdragons</a> last year in the second part of her answer to <i><b><a href=\"http://mhysaofdragons.tumblr.com/post/169287328985/why-do-you-assume-that-daenerys-will-be-happy-to\">THIS ASK HERE</a></b></i>.</p><p>I have little to add to that. I&rsquo;ll just say in addition that there are two different things here.</p><p>Firstly, the show and book portrayal are different. In the books it is quite clear that there is no real choice for Dany. Viserys threatens the pregnant Khaleesi in front of the Khalasar and Drogo, in their holy place where he is not supposed to draw a blade. Dany even tries to stop him by letting him take her eggs but that doesn&rsquo;t stop him. There is no way Drogo can allow this to go unpunished. It would make him look too weak. Viserys&rsquo; life was forfeit. In the show this was not emphasized as clearly and it seemed like Dany might have had more of say in it. But not really if you consider all these factors.&nbsp;</p><p>Secondly, is an issue related to Dany&rsquo;s own development. The thing is that Dany has hardly ever received any love in her life. She keeps thinking that feelings that shouldn&rsquo;t otherwise qualify as love are love. I think it took her time (even in the show) to realize that Viserys really did not love her at all. Not even one little bit. Had no concern for her whatsoever as his sister. Really saw her as nothing more than a piece of property. Completely dehumanized. Sold into slavery.</p><p>I mean compare with Littlefinger who married Sansa to Ramsey for political reasons. Littlefinger actually did not know what Ramsey was like. He didn&rsquo;t think he was handing Sansa over to a terrible fate. And he did try to make up for it. Compare that to what Viserys said to Dany at the very beginning, i.e. that he would gladly let all the Dothraki horde and even their horses rape her if it meant Viserys getting an army.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t think it had fully sunk in for Dany that Viserys saw her as nothing more than property. Even in the initial episodes of season 1, even after being raped she does not fully understand this. And here&rsquo;s the kicker. The thing is that Viserys wasn&rsquo;t even fully mad at this juncture. He may have been going in that direction, but he still had much of his faculties about him. But he still treated her like this.
