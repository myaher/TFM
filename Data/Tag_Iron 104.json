The only problem is, he\u2019s drunk.</b></p><p><b>Words: 1455</b></p><hr><p>Peter was woken by a loud thud outside his bedroom door. With\na start, he shot up in bed and immediately flicked his eyes around the room,\nsearching for any obvious sign of danger. A quick glance at the alarm clock on\nhis bedside table told him it was four am. Who the <i>hell </i>was up at four am?</p><p>\u201cOw! <i>Shit</i>!\u201d</p><p>Peter frowned. \u201cUh- hello?\u201d His voice was small and,\nhonestly, sounded like a high-pitched squeak in the void of darkness surrounding\nhim, but what could he say? He was still half-asleep, woken by somebody\ncreeping around outside his door and \u2013 oh, <i>God</i>,\nthere was another bang! He gulped, subconsciously pulling his duvet up to his\nchin. \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d</p><p>The teenager swore his heart skipped a beat as his eyes saw the door\u2019s handle dip down. Honestly, he had\nno clue why he was so nervous. Not only was he freaking <i>Spider</i>man, but he was in the Avengers Facility. There were Superheroes\nsleeping above, below and beside him. If someone was in the Facility, they\u00a0\u2013 and subsequently him\u00a0\u2013 would know by now. Nevertheless, he couldn\u2019t help but take a deep\nbreath as the door opened wider and a dark shape practically stumbled into his\nroom. \u201c<i>Jesus</i>, why\u2019sso daaark?\u201d</p><p>Peter sat up straighter before narrowing his eyes, trying to\nsee a little clearer. \u201c<i>Tony</i>? Tony, is\nthat- is that <i>you</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d was the response. Slurred. It was definitely slurred. \u201cNo,\nit\u2019sss Iron Man.\u201d The dark shape fumbled for the switch on the side of the\nwall, and Peter grimaced as light filled the room. His grimace quickly changed\nto pure shock as the light revealed the dark shape to be an <i>exhausted</i> Tony Stark.</p><p>\u201cTony? What the <i>hell</i>? Are you okay?\u201d The kid wasted no time\nin pushing his covers to the side and leaping out of bed, rushing over to the\nman. All kinds of scenarios were rushing through his head as to what could have\npossibly happened \u2013 had he been attacked in his sleep? Had he had a nightmare\nor another panic attack? Had he gone on a nightly trip to the kitchens and somehow\nfallen down the stairs? \u2013 but the thoughts immediately stopped as he took in\nTony\u2019s state and suddenly realised that he was, in fact, drunk. Due to his tired\nmind, he\u2019d somehow forgotten that tonight \u2013 or, rather, yesterday evening \u2013\nwas the man\u2019s bachelor party. He\u2019d gone out with some friends (meaning the\nAvengers) for drinks in a pub he\u2019d somehow managed to rent out for the night\n(how did you rent out a <i>pub</i>?) and, by\nthe looks of things, he\u2019d only just arrived home. He couldn\u2019t help the smile\nthat spread across his face as Tony\u2019s narrowed eyes peered curiously at him.\nHad Tony Stark <i>ever </i>been drunk? He wasn\u2019t sure, and if he had, <i>he\u2019d</i> never seen such a thing. However,\nit <i>was</i> his bachelor party, after all,\nand his and Pepper\u2019s wedding was only around the corner. He deserved a night\nout. The fact that he was drunk told him he\u2019d had a good time, and that fact alone made him happy.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cPeter! It\u2019s you!\u201d A huge grin spread across Tony\u2019s face and\nhe grasped Peter\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYep, it\u2019s me. Don\u2019t know who else you expected to see in my\nroom.\u201d He smiled, reaching up and placing his own hand on top of Tony\u2019s. \u201cHave\nyou just gotten home? Where are the others?\u201d</p><p>Tony blinked and made a face. \u201cNooo. I was asleep, then- uhhh.\nThen I got up and walked here. Came back <i>hours</i>\nago.\u201d </p><p>Peter nodded, tilting his head slightly to the side. \u201cWhy\u2019d\nyou come here? Shouldn\u2019t you be sleeping this off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleeping what off?\u201d The sight of a drunk Tony was\npretty endearing, and Peter bit his lip to stop himself from bursting into\nlaughter.</p><p>\u201cYour- well. You\u2019re drunk. You should be sleeping. Want me\nto take you back to your-\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo. No, came here for a r-reason, Pizza.\u201d</p><p>He did <i>not </i>just call him pizza.</p><p>\u201cI mean- I mean Peter.\u201d</p><p>He did! Okay, <i>no</i>\namount of force the kid put between his teeth and his lip could stop the\nlaughter that spilled from his lips at that. \u201cOkahahay,\u201d he giggled, patting\nTony\u2019s hand as he stared at him, confusion shining in his exhausted eyes. \u201cWhy\ndid youhu come here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to showww- um. Uh. Show you something. Yeah.\u201d</p><p>Honestly, Peter expected some amount of guessing on his part\nbefore Tony showed him what he\u2019d found so important that he had to traipse into\nhis room at four in the morning. However, he was quite surprised when\u00a0Tony pulled his hand away \u2013 and stumbled as he did so \u2013 and lifted his sleeve up, revealing an\narm wrapped in cellophane. He wasted no time in fumbling with it and\nripping it away, and Peter visibly paled at what he saw. \u201cTony! You got a\nfreaking <i>tattoo</i>? While <i>drunk</i>? Dude, that\u2019s- oh, my God. You are\n<i>so </i>gonna regret this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d I regret it? It\u2019s sooooo nice!\u201d He rubbed a finger over\nthe still-red area and a smile lit up his face. Peter heaved a sigh. He thought\nthese things only happened in movies. Nevertheless, he craned his head to have\na look at the tattoo, expecting to see Donald Trump\u2019s face or one of those\ncheesy quotes \u2013 anything that he\u2019d get removed as soon as he saw it while sober.\nWhat he didn\u2019t expect, was a small, black \u2018P\u2019. There was something else below\nit, but his eyes were fixed completely on the letter. </p><p>\u201cUh- a \u2018P\u2019? That\u2019s\u2026 nice. I guess?\u201d</p><p>Tony narrowed his eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s a lie.\u201d</p><p>The corner of Peter\u2019s lips lifted upwards. Even drunk, that\nman could read him like an open book. He shook his head. \u201cNo! No, I- it <i>is\n</i>nice. I just\u2026 what\u2019s it for? Is it P for, I don\u2019t know, playboy?\nPhilanthropist?\u201d</p><p>Tony made the strangest face and stared at him, making the\nteenager feel utterly stupid. He tried again. \u201cUhh- P for\u2026 party? Peace? Peanuts?\u201d\nHe paused, eyes widening in sudden realisation. \u201cWait! I know! P for Pepper? Tony, that\nis <i>so</i> sweet.\u201d</p><p>His mouth opened as Tony\u2019s face didn\u2019t change. \u201cAre you s-stupid?\nP for\u2026 Pepper? No, <i>no</i>, P for- P for <i>Peeeeter. </i>Look at the lil spider.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes widened before Tony motioned back towards his\narm, and he leaned down, finally acknowledging the dark shape he\u2019d briefly\nnoticed under the letter. Sure enough, it was a spider. A tiny spider\nnonetheless, but it most definitely was symbolising him, with the P added to\nthe mix. He felt his heart skip a beat. Oh, God. Tony had drunkenly gotten\nhimself a tattoo representing <i>him</i>. <i>Shit</i>!\nHow awkward would <i>this</i> be in the\nmorning? Especially if he wanted to have it removed&hellip;</p><p>\u201cYou <i>don\u2019t </i>like it! You <i>hate </i>it\u2026 I t-<i>told </i>Steeeve it was a\nbad idea.\u201d Tony looked so dejected that Peter couldn\u2019t help but rush to assure him\nthat he <i>did</i> like it. Which, uh, he\ndid. But it felt strange to admit that.</p><p>\u201cOh! No, no, no, no, Tony\u2026 I <i>do</i> like it. I just- wait. This was <i>Steve\u2019s</i> idea?\u201d</p><p>Tony grinned. \u201cYeaaah. I\u2019m goin\u2019ta sleep.\u201d</p><p>Peter stood rooted to the ground as Tony grabbed him to\nsteady himself before he walked clumsily over to Peter\u2019s bed and fell\nface-first onto the mattress. He was already dressed in his pyjamas \u2013 how he\u2019d\nmanaged to do that, he had no clue \u2013 and Peter turned around just in time to\nsee him reach for the covers and pull them over himself. \u201cC\u2019mere,\u201d he mumbled, and\nPeter rolled his eyes before switching off the light and walking over to the\nbed, getting in beside Tony. If this had been a year or so earlier, he\u2019d have\nhesitated and probably slept on the floor instead of hopping into bed with <i>the\n</i>freaking <i>Iron</i> Man. However, he\u2019d\nspent a lot of sleepless nights in that guy\u2019s room in the past year. The two had had their fair share\nof nightmares, and the only comfort they seemed to find during those times was\nwith each other.</p><p>Peter sighed, staring up at the ceiling. Tony was silent\nbeside him, face smushed against the pillow, eyes shut, and for a moment, the\nkid couldn\u2019t help but wonder at how he\u2019d gone from an eight-year old superfan\nof Iron Man to the unofficial son of Tony Stark. He shook his head, a smile briefly spreading across his lips before he shut his eyes, the warmth of the body\nnext to him making him feel safer than he\u2019d ever felt before.</p><p>\u201cMmmm\u2026 hey, Pete?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Tony?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoooo you wanna see the tattoo of- of Pepper\u2019s face? On my\nback?\u201d</p><p>Crap.</p>",

He\u2019d gone out with some friends (meaning the\nAvengers) for drinks in a pub he\u2019d somehow managed to rent out for the night\n(how did you rent out a <i>pub</i>?) and, by\nthe looks of things, he\u2019d only just arrived home. He couldn\u2019t help the smile\nthat spread across his face as Tony\u2019s narrowed eyes peered curiously at him.\nHad Tony Stark <i>ever </i>been drunk? He wasn\u2019t sure, and if he had, <i>he\u2019d</i> never seen such a thing. However,\nit <i>was</i> his bachelor party, after all,\nand his and Pepper\u2019s wedding was only around the corner. He deserved a night\nout. The fact that he was drunk told him he\u2019d had a good time, and that fact alone made him happy.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cPeter! It\u2019s you!\u201d A huge grin spread across Tony\u2019s face and\nhe grasped Peter\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYep, it\u2019s me. Don\u2019t know who else you expected to see in my\nroom.\u201d He smiled, reaching up and placing his own hand on top of Tony\u2019s. \u201cHave\nyou just gotten home? Where are the others?\u201d</p><p>Tony blinked and made a face. \u201cNooo. I was asleep, then- uhhh.\nThen I got up and walked here. Came back <i>hours</i>\nago.\u201d </p><p>Peter nodded, tilting his head slightly to the side. \u201cWhy\u2019d\nyou come here? Shouldn\u2019t you be sleeping this off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleeping what off?\u201d The sight of a drunk Tony was\npretty endearing, and Peter bit his lip to stop himself from bursting into\nlaughter.</p><p>\u201cYour- well. You\u2019re drunk. You should be sleeping. Want me\nto take you back to your-\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo. No, came here for a r-reason, Pizza.\u201d</p><p>He did <i>not </i>just call him pizza.</p><p>\u201cI mean- I mean Peter.\u201d</p><p>He did! Okay, <i>no</i>\namount of force the kid put between his teeth and his lip could stop the\nlaughter that spilled from his lips at that. \u201cOkahahay,\u201d he giggled, patting\nTony\u2019s hand as he stared at him, confusion shining in his exhausted eyes. \u201cWhy\ndid youhu come here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to showww- um. Uh. Show you something. Yeah.\u201d</p><p>Honestly, Peter expected some amount of guessing on his part\nbefore Tony showed him what he\u2019d found so important that he had to traipse into\nhis room at four in the morning. However, he was quite surprised when\u00a0Tony pulled his hand away \u2013 and stumbled as he did so \u2013 and lifted his sleeve up, revealing an\narm wrapped in cellophane. He wasted no time in fumbling with it and\nripping it away, and Peter visibly paled at what he saw. \u201cTony! You got a\nfreaking <i>tattoo</i>? While <i>drunk</i>? Dude, that\u2019s- oh, my God. You are\n<i>so </i>gonna regret this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d I regret it? It\u2019s sooooo nice!\u201d He rubbed a finger over\nthe still-red area and a smile lit up his face. Peter heaved a sigh. He thought\nthese things only happened in movies. Nevertheless, he craned his head to have\na look at the tattoo, expecting to see Donald Trump\u2019s face or one of those\ncheesy quotes \u2013 anything that he\u2019d get removed as soon as he saw it while sober.\nWhat he didn\u2019t expect, was a small, black \u2018P\u2019. There was something else below\nit, but his eyes were fixed completely on the letter. </p><p>\u201cUh- a \u2018P\u2019? That\u2019s\u2026 nice. I guess?\u201d</p><p>Tony narrowed his eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s a lie.\u201d</p><p>The corner of Peter\u2019s lips lifted upwards. Even drunk, that\nman could read him like an open book. He shook his head. \u201cNo! No, I- it <i>is\n</i>nice. I just\u2026 what\u2019s it for? Is it P for, I don\u2019t know, playboy?\nPhilanthropist?\u201d</p><p>Tony made the strangest face and stared at him, making the\nteenager feel utterly stupid. He tried again. \u201cUhh- P for\u2026 party? Peace? Peanuts?\u201d\nHe paused, eyes widening in sudden realisation. \u201cWait! I know! P for Pepper? Tony, that\nis <i>so</i> sweet.\u201d</p><p>His mouth opened as Tony\u2019s face didn\u2019t change. \u201cAre you s-stupid?\nP for\u2026 Pepper? No, <i>no</i>, P for- P for <i>Peeeeter. </i>Look at the lil spider.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes widened before Tony motioned back towards his\narm, and he leaned down, finally acknowledging the dark shape he\u2019d briefly\nnoticed under the letter. Sure enough, it was a spider. A tiny spider\nnonetheless, but it most definitely was symbolising him, with the P added to\nthe mix. He felt his heart skip a beat. Oh, God. Tony had drunkenly gotten\nhimself a tattoo representing <i>him</i>. <i>Shit</i>!\nHow awkward would <i>this</i> be in the\nmorning? Especially if he wanted to have it removed\u2026</p><p>\u201cYou <i>don\u2019t </i>like it! You <i>hate </i>it\u2026 I t-<i>told </i>Steeeve it was a\nbad idea.\u201d Tony looked so dejected that Peter couldn\u2019t help but rush to assure him\nthat he <i>did</i> like it. Which, uh, he\ndid. But it felt strange to admit that.</p><p>\u201cOh! No, no, no, no, Tony\u2026 I <i>do</i> like it. I just- wait. This was <i>Steve\u2019s</i> idea?\u201d</p><p>Tony grinned. \u201cYeaaah. I\u2019m goin\u2019ta sleep.\u201d</p><p>Peter stood rooted to the ground as Tony grabbed him to\nsteady himself before he walked clumsily over to Peter\u2019s bed and fell\nface-first onto the mattress. He was already dressed in his pyjamas \u2013 how he\u2019d\nmanaged to do that, he had no clue \u2013 and Peter turned around just in time to\nsee him reach for the covers and pull them over himself. \u201cC\u2019mere,\u201d he mumbled, and\nPeter rolled his eyes before switching off the light and walking over to the\nbed, getting in beside Tony. If this had been a year or so earlier, he\u2019d have\nhesitated and probably slept on the floor instead of hopping into bed with <i>the\n</i>freaking <i>Iron</i> Man. However, he\u2019d\nspent a lot of sleepless nights in that guy\u2019s room in the past year. The two had had their fair share\nof nightmares, and the only comfort they seemed to find during those times was\nwith each other.</p><p>Peter sighed, staring up at the ceiling. Tony was silent\nbeside him, face smushed against the pillow, eyes shut, and for a moment, the\nkid couldn\u2019t help but wonder at how he\u2019d gone from an eight-year old superfan\nof Iron Man to the unofficial son of Tony Stark. He shook his head, a smile briefly spreading across his lips before he shut his eyes, the warmth of the body\nnext to him making him feel safer than he\u2019d ever felt before.</p><p>\u201cMmmm\u2026 hey, Pete?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Tony?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoooo you wanna see the tattoo of- of Pepper\u2019s face? On my\nback?\u201d</p><p>Crap.</p>",

He deserved a night\nout. The fact that he was drunk told him he&rsquo;d had a good time, and that fact alone made him happy.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Peter! It&rsquo;s you!&rdquo; A huge grin spread across Tony&rsquo;s face and\nhe grasped Peter&rsquo;s shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;Yep, it&rsquo;s me. Don&rsquo;t know who else you expected to see in my\nroom.&rdquo; He smiled, reaching up and placing his own hand on top of Tony&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Have\nyou just gotten home? Where are the others?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony blinked and made a face. &ldquo;Nooo. I was asleep, then- uhhh.\nThen I got up and walked here. Came back <i>hours</i>\nago.&rdquo; </p><p>Peter nodded, tilting his head slightly to the side. &ldquo;Why&rsquo;d\nyou come here? Shouldn&rsquo;t you be sleeping this off?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sleeping what off?&rdquo; The sight of a drunk Tony was\npretty endearing, and Peter bit his lip to stop himself from bursting into\nlaughter.</p><p>&ldquo;Your- well. You&rsquo;re drunk. You should be sleeping. Want me\nto take you back to your-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. No, came here for a r-reason, Pizza.&rdquo;</p><p>He did <i>not </i>just call him pizza.</p><p>&ldquo;I mean- I mean Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>He did! Okay, <i>no</i>\namount of force the kid put between his teeth and his lip could stop the\nlaughter that spilled from his lips at that. &ldquo;Okahahay,&rdquo; he giggled, patting\nTony&rsquo;s hand as he stared at him, confusion shining in his exhausted eyes. &ldquo;Why\ndid youhu come here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I need to showww- um. Uh. Show you something. Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>Honestly, Peter expected some amount of guessing on his part\nbefore Tony showed him what he&rsquo;d found so important that he had to traipse into\nhis room at four in the morning. However, he was quite surprised when&nbsp;Tony pulled his hand away &ndash; and stumbled as he did so &ndash; and lifted his sleeve up, revealing an\narm wrapped in cellophane. He wasted no time in fumbling with it and\nripping it away, and Peter visibly paled at what he saw. &ldquo;Tony! You got a\nfreaking <i>tattoo</i>? While <i>drunk</i>? Dude, that&rsquo;s- oh, my God. You are\n<i>so </i>gonna regret this!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why&rsquo;d I regret it? It&rsquo;s sooooo nice!&rdquo; He rubbed a finger over\nthe still-red area and a smile lit up his face. Peter heaved a sigh. He thought\nthese things only happened in movies. Nevertheless, he craned his head to have\na look at the tattoo, expecting to see Donald Trump&rsquo;s face or one of those\ncheesy quotes &ndash; anything that he&rsquo;d get removed as soon as he saw it while sober.\nWhat he didn&rsquo;t expect, was a small, black &lsquo;P&rsquo;. There was something else below\nit, but his eyes were fixed completely on the letter. </p><p>&ldquo;Uh- a &lsquo;P&rsquo;? That&rsquo;s&hellip; nice. I guess?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony narrowed his eyes. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lie.&rdquo;</p><p>The corner of Peter&rsquo;s lips lifted upwards. Even drunk, that\nman could read him like an open book. He shook his head. &ldquo;No! No, I- it <i>is\n</i>nice. I just&hellip; what&rsquo;s it for? Is it P for, I don&rsquo;t know, playboy?\nPhilanthropist?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony made the strangest face and stared at him, making the\nteenager feel utterly stupid. He tried again. &ldquo;Uhh- P for&hellip; party? Peace? Peanuts?&rdquo;\nHe paused, eyes widening in sudden realisation. &ldquo;Wait! I know! P for Pepper? Tony, that\nis <i>so</i> sweet.&rdquo;</p><p>His mouth opened as Tony&rsquo;s face didn&rsquo;t change. &ldquo;Are you s-stupid?\nP for&hellip; Pepper? No, <i>no</i>, P for- P for <i>Peeeeter. </i>Look at the lil spider.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s eyes widened before Tony motioned back towards his\narm, and he leaned down, finally acknowledging the dark shape he&rsquo;d briefly\nnoticed under the letter. Sure enough, it was a spider. A tiny spider\nnonetheless, but it most definitely was symbolising him, with the P added to\nthe mix. He felt his heart skip a beat. Oh, God. Tony had drunkenly gotten\nhimself a tattoo representing <i>him</i>. <i>Shit</i>!\nHow awkward would <i>this</i> be in the\nmorning? Especially if he wanted to have it removed&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;You <i>don&rsquo;t </i>like it! You <i>hate </i>it&hellip; I t-<i>told </i>Steeeve it was a\nbad idea.&rdquo; Tony looked so dejected that Peter couldn&rsquo;t help but rush to assure him\nthat he <i>did</i> like it. Which, uh, he\ndid. But it felt strange to admit that.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! No, no, no, no, Tony&hellip; I <i>do</i> like it. I just- wait. This was <i>Steve&rsquo;s</i> idea?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony grinned. &ldquo;Yeaaah. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo;ta sleep.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter stood rooted to the ground as Tony grabbed him to\nsteady himself before he walked clumsily over to Peter&rsquo;s bed and fell\nface-first onto the mattress. He was already dressed in his pyjamas &ndash; how he&rsquo;d\nmanaged to do that, he had no clue &ndash; and Peter turned around just in time to\nsee him reach for the covers and pull them over himself. &ldquo;C&rsquo;mere,&rdquo; he mumbled, and\nPeter rolled his eyes before switching off the light and walking over to the\nbed, getting in beside Tony. If this had been a year or so earlier, he&rsquo;d have\nhesitated and probably slept on the floor instead of hopping into bed with <i>the\n</i>freaking <i>Iron</i> Man. However, he&rsquo;d\nspent a lot of sleepless nights in that guy&rsquo;s room in the past year. The two had had their fair share\nof nightmares, and the only comfort they seemed to find during those times was\nwith each other.</p><p>Peter sighed, staring up at the ceiling. Tony was silent\nbeside him, face smushed against the pillow, eyes shut, and for a moment, the\nkid couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder at how he&rsquo;d gone from an eight-year old superfan\nof Iron Man to the unofficial son of Tony Stark. He shook his head, a smile briefly spreading across his lips before he shut his eyes, the warmth of the body\nnext to him making him feel safer than he&rsquo;d ever felt before.</p><p>&ldquo;Mmmm&hellip; hey, Pete?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, Tony?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Doooo you wanna see the tattoo of- of Pepper&rsquo;s face? On my\nback?&rdquo;</p><p>Crap.</p>",
