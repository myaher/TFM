You also see a lot of it with Unity and the Auditors. It\u2019s that, when an immortal being spends time around humans, especially in the shape of the human, they become human-like. And we see that with Aziraphale and Crowley in the book. It\u2019s one of the big themes, especially with how they\u2019ve become not fully good and not fully evil (<strike>a chef\u2019s salad in a vignette\u00a0of conflict and confusion</strike>). Another element of Death\u2019s character arc is that how one cannot study something without gaining their traits, in his case, humans. And it\u2019s pretty clear that Aziraphale and Crowley have both studied humanity in their own way. But other than Unity giving up the name the Auditors chose from her and her pronouns going from it to her, there isn\u2019t much of a gender thing going on when it comes to this aspect of Discworld.</p><p>So now it\u2019s time to turn to dwarves and golems. Dwarves have an essentially\u00a0genderless society, although humans read it as male and that\u2019s how dwarves explain it to outsiders. But when Cheery started to present herself as female (and going by a non-dwarven chosen name), many dwarves did the same and created a pretty good metaphor for being trans. And of course, their concept of femininity and gender comes from humans and it\u2019s all part of the cultural exchange between the immigrant dwarves and the humans of Ankh-Morpork. As for golems, it\u2019s considered polite to use he\u00a0(as \u201cit\u201d is dehumanizing and no one has told Adora about singular they, I guess) but they don\u2019t really bother with the whole gender thing, but there is an exception. Gladys took her name and started presenting as female to satisfy Miss Maccalariat so she could clean the women\u2019s restrooms at the post office. But to the bafflement of Moist, she seems to have picked up the concept of the gender from the other female employees of the post office. But the literalism of even freed golems does make this example a bit hard to pin down, the dwarves picking up gender from humans do still exist. Either way, the idea is the same, gender is contagious.</p><p>And so, in summary, my theory is that Aziraphale and Crowley have both picked up gender from humans (which makes them trans, I guess).

Either way, the idea is the same, gender is contagious.</p><p>And so, in summary, my theory is that Aziraphale and Crowley have both picked up gender from humans (which makes them trans, I guess). Obviously, the textual evidence in the book is ambiguous, so that\u2019s why I\u2019ve used themes from Neilman\u2019s and Prattchett\u2019s other works.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>",
                "content": "<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about my Aziraphale/Crowley&rsquo;s gender theory on the discord, but here it is in full.</p><p>In Neilman&rsquo;s other story about angels, <i>Murder Mysteries</i>, Raguel explicitly&nbsp;tells the narrator that he, and all the other angels, don&rsquo;t have any genitals. We can assume the same thing applies to the supernatural beings of Good Omens, and that&rsquo;s what&nbsp;&ldquo;sexless unless they make an effort&rdquo; means. But of course, this doesn&rsquo;t mean that Aziraphale and Crowley still aren&rsquo;t gay on human terms (even ignoring that non-binary people often describe their attraction as gay).</p><p>What that statement does apply is that Heaven and Hell are genderless societies. With all angels being sexless and Heaven not being really big on individual&nbsp;identity, this seems likely. So when they first arrived on Earth, Aziraphale and Crowley probably didn&rsquo;t have a concept of gender.</p><p>&nbsp;And so now it&rsquo;s time to bring in Discworld. First is a theme that exists mainly in <i>Thief of TIme</i>, where the character arcs of Death and the Horsemen are very similar to that of Aziraphale and Crowley(as in Death goes around convincing his friends to stop the Apocalypse because they love the Disc). You also see a lot of it with Unity and the Auditors. It&rsquo;s that, when an immortal being spends time around humans, especially in the shape of the human, they become human-like. And we see that with Aziraphale and Crowley in the book. It&rsquo;s one of the big themes, especially with how they&rsquo;ve become not fully good and not fully evil (<strike>a chef&rsquo;s salad in a vignette&nbsp;of conflict and confusion</strike>). Another element of Death&rsquo;s character arc is that how one cannot study something without gaining their traits, in his case, humans. And it&rsquo;s pretty clear that Aziraphale and Crowley have both studied humanity in their own way. But other than Unity giving up the name the Auditors chose from her and her pronouns going from it to her, there isn&rsquo;t much of a gender thing going on when it comes to this aspect of Discworld.</p><p>So now it&rsquo;s time to turn to dwarves and golems. Dwarves have an essentially&nbsp;genderless society, although humans read it as male and that&rsquo;s how dwarves explain it to outsiders. But when Cheery started to present herself as female (and going by a non-dwarven chosen name), many dwarves did the same and created a pretty good metaphor for being trans. And of course, their concept of femininity and gender comes from humans and it&rsquo;s all part of the cultural exchange between the immigrant dwarves and the humans of Ankh-Morpork. As for golems, it&rsquo;s considered polite to use he&nbsp;(as &ldquo;it&rdquo; is dehumanizing and no one has told Adora about singular they, I guess) but they don&rsquo;t really bother with the whole gender thing, but there is an exception. Gladys took her name and started presenting as female to satisfy Miss Maccalariat so she could clean the women&rsquo;s restrooms at the post office. But to the bafflement of Moist, she seems to have picked up the concept of the gender from the other female employees of the post office. But the literalism of even freed golems does make this example a bit hard to pin down, the dwarves picking up gender from humans do still exist. Either way, the idea is the same, gender is contagious.</p><p>And so, in summary, my theory is that Aziraphale and Crowley have both picked up gender from humans (which makes them trans, I guess). Obviously, the textual evidence in the book is ambiguous, so that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve used themes from Neilman&rsquo;s and Prattchett&rsquo;s other works.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",
