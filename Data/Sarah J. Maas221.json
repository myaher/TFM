Armen </p><p>Now there is two possibilities (if the stories are connected) I think that Armen is possibly Monan or Monan and Dorians daughter. Now for the first possiblity I believe this is true because she says that she is impossibly old. She also wasn\u2019t always fae. She had to change herself to escape the prison.

So when Aelin (or whoever closes the gate on the valg and gods) well it bring all the witches as well and that\u2019s how Armen/Monan/ maybe daughter ended up in a new world? Or did Aelin ask her to go and make sure the perfect court was made? Or is the Throne of Glass world destroyed by Aelin and she created Prythian? And Armen stayed alive to make the perfect court? Also what makes me to believe all the possibilities is that in ACOFAS Mor saw (more like felt) a darkness. And she described it as something evil and something powerful like a Valg prince. Now Sara J Maas could have added this little bit to miss lead us into believing it is the Bryaxis. When was possibly the Valg resurfacing. </p><h2>What do you guys think?

Or did Aelin ask her to go and make sure the perfect court was made? Or is the Throne of Glass world destroyed by Aelin and she created Prythian? And Armen stayed alive to make the perfect court? Also what makes me to believe all the possibilities is that in ACOFAS Mor saw (more like felt) a darkness. And she described it as something evil and something powerful like a Valg prince. Now Sara J Maas could have added this little bit to miss lead us into believing it is the Bryaxis. When was possibly the Valg resurfacing. </p><h2>What do you guys think?
