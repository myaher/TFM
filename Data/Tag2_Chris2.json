Was. Bored.</p><p>He looked at Dodger with envy, as he was sound asleep on his little bed. If only he could fall into a nap to cure his boredom, but it seemed the harder he tried the more alert he became. Without Mya around, he always noticed how quiet it was and how such a small person could occupy so much of his space and time. He wasn\u2019t complaining, at all. His eyes scanned the living area of their suite; her toys were neatly strewn here and there, serving as a reminder of her absence. Her little tea-party table hosted two teddy bear guests that sat on separate chairs, the other two empty; reserved for Chris and herself, and a little space in between with stacked cushions for Dodger because she didn\u2019t want him to feel left out.</p><p>Now Chris wished she was there: poking his ear, playing with his beard, painting his toe nails, smothering Dodger in hair gel, watching cartoons all day long and pouring him fake tea and pretending to eat cupcakes. Sometimes they bought real food for the tea party but they mostly ate it at the big dining table because Chris couldn\u2019t last long in that small space.</p><p>Clearly, his life <i>was</i> all about Mya, Dodger and scripts. Even more now, that he\u2019d brought Mya with him to New York for the next few months whilst he was rehearsing for <i>Lobby Hero, </i>she was his priority<i>.</i> He wasn\u2019t too sure how it was going to work once the shows started; whether it was fair to have her shared between Seb or his assistant Tiffany, or if he would rather just take her back to LA to stay with her grandma. The latter seemed to be a more stable solution for her because soon after his Broadway days, he would be filming his last <i>Avengers</i> installment, which meant more time away from home and her. His heart ached at the thought, he\u2019d bonded so much with her in the last few weeks that they had been in New York together and had seen so much growth in her every day. He feared that very soon he\u2019d be missing out and hearing about it over the phone from her grandma. It just wouldn\u2019t be the same. She was picking up new words, new habits and even copying his behaviours; which he often found funny.</p><p><i>\u201cOh man!\u201d she would exclaim if she dropped a toy or made a mistake. </i></p><p><i> </i></p><p><i>It used to be \u2018oh shit,\u2019 (well, only once) because she\u2019d heard it from none other. Chris quickly realised how much of a sponge she was, even when he thought she wasn\u2019t watching or listening; he would later see her exhibit his behaviours.</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p><i>Or she\u2019d greet Dodger with a, \u201cHi buddy,\u201d</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p><i>And in the mornings, she copied her dad\u2019s routine too; she would brush her teeth with him, wash her face and splatter water everywhere, and mutter a small \u201coh man.\u201d After brushing their teeth and washing their faces, Chris would pick up a script or newspaper to read over breakfast, Mya would bring her drawing pad. Breakfast was always a fruit platter and dry seeded bread; or plain oatmeal with just a drizzle of honey since he was slowly easing into his Cap diet. Mya drew the line at the dry seeded bread though, she preferred white bread smothered in butter and jam, and instead of a coffee or green juice like her dad, an orange juice was her go-to. Chris always diluted it because he found out that Mya and sugar were a dangerous combination, add Dodger to the mix and it was a real fucking party.</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p><i>\u201cYuck!\u201d she grimaced at the oatmeal once when Chris had tried to get her to try something new.</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p><i>\u201cOne bite, look, daddy\u2019s putting Nutella in it,\u201d</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p><i>\u201cNo, don\u2019t want it, yuck,\u201d she then fake gagged, making Chris stop immediately, sighing and gave in to her demands of jammy toast and a bowl of strawberries.</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat kid doesn\u2019t like Nutella?\u201d he mumbled to himself.</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p>Chris finally pushed his hair back and compartmentalised the wistful spiral of thoughts and checked his phone, hoping that maybe Sebastian had texted to say she wanted to come home. He wouldn\u2019t even mind if Mya had decided she missed her dad too much and cut their little ice cream date short. He was regretting telling Sebastian to bring her back when the sugar had worn off. Checking the time on his phone; it\u2019d only been an hour since they\u2019d left and it was going to be a while until they came back. He exhaled, and called the best person to help him get him out of his misery, before he let the thoughts build up and exacerbate his anxiety.</p><p><i>So Sebastian was right,</i> Chris concluded begrudgingly as he held the phone to his ear; his life truly evolved around Mya, Dodger and scripts.</p><p> \u201cHey ma,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHi honey, I was just about to call you once I unpacked,\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnpacked?\u201d Chris enquired.</p><p>\u201cThe grocery - I\u2019m just coming in from the market, I\u2019m hosting a dinner tonight,\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust what I wanted to hear to make me homesick,\u201d he laughed softly.</p><p>\u201cYou okay sweetie?\u201d Lisa asked, pausing deciphering her son\u2019s deflated tone.</p><p>\u201cYeah, just feel&hellip;empty\u2026bored. Mya\u2019s gone out with her best friend Seb, and Dodger is sleeping. I don\u2019t know what to do, usually at this time we\u2019ll be watching <i>Curious George</i> together or at the park or debating what to eat for lunch,\u201d</p><p>\u201cAaw, that\u2019s normal,\u201d Lisa said. \u201cYou just need to find something to do to without her. It\u2019s okay to have an independent life outside of her, it\u2019s not good for both of you to always be in each other\u2019s space,\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard, I\u2019m trying to let go, but I feel bad if I don\u2019t spend much time with her because once my shows I won\u2019t be around much and then it\u2019ll be <i>Avengers</i> soon after and we\u2019ll have to be away from each other again,\u201d Chris explained. \u201cI seem to cope better with this when she\u2019s not around because then I\u2019m not physically in close proximity to be so protective of her,\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut think of it this way; once you finish with this <i>Avengers</i> film, she\u2019s all yours. You did say you wanted to take a break after and let her go to school,\u201d Lisa reasoned.</p><p>Chris nodded, as if his mom could see. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right. I guess it\u2019s just still getting used to this parenting thing,\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll keep learning. Use your time alone to rest and unwind, or go out, some \u2018me-time\u2019 will be good for you,\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmhhh,\u201d Chris contemplated, he wondered if that would make him selfish. He quickly snapped out of the thought. \u201cJheeze, Chris, such a downer. Who\u2019s coming to dinner?\u201d</p><p>Lisa laughed at her son, imagining his face as he ridiculed himself, \u201cYour uncles, Scott, Shana, Carly and the kids. It was Scott\u2019s idea. Think we\u2019ll be seeing you here anytime soon?\u201d</p><p>Chris bit his bottom lip, racking his brain quickly for his schedule; \u201cI have a week off in a month, I don\u2019t know where Mya will be. I\u2019ll figure something out,\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould be good for you to take sometime out and switch off, and have her here to play with her cousins,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need it, maybe we could do Disney with her. She\u2019d love it,\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe more you, than her,\u201d Lisa corrected, knowing very well, that any excuse for Chris to go to Disney, he would exploit it.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s some truth in that,\u201d</p><p>The conversation progressed with Chris asking what was on the menu for dinner; he really missed home. He loved his mom\u2019s cooking, being around his siblings and their kids, and friends and their kids too. Boston gave him that respite to be just himself and fully relax which he couldn\u2019t do here in New York, the fact that he was living in a hotel, (which wasn\u2019t a luxury that he took for granted) served as a reminder of his double life. Even his home in LA, the extravagant house tucked in the hills with other celebrities as neighbours, was of the same sentiment; but nothing ever compared to Boston. He found it more grounding and the pace of life was slower, no one cared who he was there nor even noticed him, because in Boston no one is ever looking to spot a celebrity.</p><p>It made him terribly homesick to know that his family was going to be gathered under one roof and enjoying each other\u2019s company, whilst he sat alone in a hotel room, not sure if his daughter would even be back to join him for dinner.</p><p>\u201cSo, if you do come to Boston in a few weeks, should I expect a guest?\u201d</p><p>Chris could tell by his mom\u2019s intonation that she wasn\u2019t talking about a friend like last time, when he\u2019d visited with Seb. She was referring to a woman. For some reason when his mom brought up the topic about his dating life, he didn\u2019t mind so much; supposedly he knew he couldn\u2019t be defensive with her like he was with his friends, she could read him like a book, even over the phone. He was always honest with her because she always gave him the space and opportunity to be vulnerable with her; the same kid that ran home at 13 years old to tell her he\u2019d just lost his virginity.</p><p>\u201cAfraid not, it\u2019ll just be the three of us as usual,\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you looking? Have you been dating \u2013 because you have been quiet the last few weeks, I thought someone\u2019s come along and stole your attention,\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can blame my new schedule and these two kids of mine,\u201d he said referring to Dodger as well. \u201cAnd no, I haven\u2019t been looking or dating. I just don\u2019t have the time,\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do right now in this very moment, Chris,\u201d Lisa challenged.</p><p>\u201cYou say it like I can just walk outside and pick a woman,\u201d Chris scoffed.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean, I\u2019m just saying,\u201d Lisa reasoned. \u201cAnd it\u2019s been so long since you\u2019ve been on the scene, you might lose your charm if you keep away,\u201d</p><p>Tickled by her honesty, Chris drew his head back with laughter, \u201cWow, my own mother ladies and gentlemen,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want you to be happy,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am ma,\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but there\u2019s something missing. Do you really want the only company you keep around you to be a toddler and a dog that you can\u2019t have adult conversations with? Is this why you\u2019re always on Twitter now?\u201d</p><p>Chris roared with laughed again, this time his hand grabbing his left pec, slightly offended but she was actually right. He would find himself berating Donald Trump on his TV screen and look to Dodger and Mya in shock for their support.</p><p><i>\u201cCan you believe this guy?\u201d he would ask exasperatedly, receiving nothing in return but questioning glances from the dog and toddler. He would then go on his Twitter and continue his rant, starting a dialogue with his congregation of followers or his industry allies.</i></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re unbelievable,\u201d</p><p>\u201cFood for thought Chris. Speaking of food, I really have to go start prepping all this, Facetime you later when everyone\u2019s here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please do,\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive my grandbaby a hug and a kiss for me, okay? I love you,\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you ma,\u201d</p><p>Before hanging up, Lisa fired her one last shot, \u201cAnd join Tinder or something, that\u2019ll cure your boredom,\u201d</p><p>Chris chuckled in disbelief when she hang up abruptly after her Tinder proposal. Clutching a cushion to his chest and deciding to take his mom\u2019s advice \u2013 not to join Tinder, but to revel in his quiet time, he put the phone on the table. He was going to count sheep until sleep consumed him, because frankly he needed the rest.

Was. Bored.</p><p>He looked at Dodger with envy, as he was sound asleep on his little bed. If only he could fall into a nap to cure his boredom, but it seemed the harder he tried the more alert he became. Without Mya around, he always noticed how quiet it was and how such a small person could occupy so much of his space and time. He wasn\u2019t complaining, at all. His eyes scanned the living area of their suite; her toys were neatly strewn here and there, serving as a reminder of her absence. Her little tea-party table hosted two teddy bear guests that sat on separate chairs, the other two empty; reserved for Chris and herself, and a little space in between with stacked cushions for Dodger because she didn\u2019t want him to feel left out.</p><p>Now Chris wished she was there: poking his ear, playing with his beard, painting his toe nails, smothering Dodger in hair gel, watching cartoons all day long and pouring him fake tea and pretending to eat cupcakes. Sometimes they bought real food for the tea party but they mostly ate it at the big dining table because Chris couldn\u2019t last long in that small space.</p><p>Clearly, his life <i>was</i> all about Mya, Dodger and scripts. Even more now, that he\u2019d brought Mya with him to New York for the next few months whilst he was rehearsing for <i>Lobby Hero, </i>she was his priority<i>.</i> He wasn\u2019t too sure how it was going to work once the shows started; whether it was fair to have her shared between Seb or his assistant Tiffany, or if he would rather just take her back to LA to stay with her grandma. The latter seemed to be a more stable solution for her because soon after his Broadway days, he would be filming his last <i>Avengers</i> installment, which meant more time away from home and her. His heart ached at the thought, he\u2019d bonded so much with her in the last few weeks that they had been in New York together and had seen so much growth in her every day. He feared that very soon he\u2019d be missing out and hearing about it over the phone from her grandma. It just wouldn\u2019t be the same. She was picking up new words, new habits and even copying his behaviours; which he often found funny.</p><p><i>\u201cOh man!\u201d she would exclaim if she dropped a toy or made a mistake. </i></p><p><i> </i></p><p><i>It used to be \u2018oh shit,\u2019 (well, only once) because she\u2019d heard it from none other. Chris quickly realised how much of a sponge she was, even when he thought she wasn\u2019t watching or listening; he would later see her exhibit his behaviours.</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p><i>Or she\u2019d greet Dodger with a, \u201cHi buddy,\u201d</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p><i>And in the mornings, she copied her dad\u2019s routine too; she would brush her teeth with him, wash her face and splatter water everywhere, and mutter a small \u201coh man.\u201d After brushing their teeth and washing their faces, Chris would pick up a script or newspaper to read over breakfast, Mya would bring her drawing pad. Breakfast was always a fruit platter and dry seeded bread; or plain oatmeal with just a drizzle of honey since he was slowly easing into his Cap diet. Mya drew the line at the dry seeded bread though, she preferred white bread smothered in butter and jam, and instead of a coffee or green juice like her dad, an orange juice was her go-to. Chris always diluted it because he found out that Mya and sugar were a dangerous combination, add Dodger to the mix and it was a real fucking party.</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p><i>\u201cYuck!\u201d she grimaced at the oatmeal once when Chris had tried to get her to try something new.</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p><i>\u201cOne bite, look, daddy\u2019s putting Nutella in it,\u201d</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p><i>\u201cNo, don\u2019t want it, yuck,\u201d she then fake gagged, making Chris stop immediately, sighing and gave in to her demands of jammy toast and a bowl of strawberries.</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat kid doesn\u2019t like Nutella?\u201d he mumbled to himself.</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p>Chris finally pushed his hair back and compartmentalised the wistful spiral of thoughts and checked his phone, hoping that maybe Sebastian had texted to say she wanted to come home. He wouldn\u2019t even mind if Mya had decided she missed her dad too much and cut their little ice cream date short. He was regretting telling Sebastian to bring her back when the sugar had worn off. Checking the time on his phone; it\u2019d only been an hour since they\u2019d left and it was going to be a while until they came back. He exhaled, and called the best person to help him get him out of his misery, before he let the thoughts build up and exacerbate his anxiety.</p><p><i>So Sebastian was right,</i> Chris concluded begrudgingly as he held the phone to his ear; his life truly evolved around Mya, Dodger and scripts.</p><p> \u201cHey ma,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHi honey, I was just about to call you once I unpacked,\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnpacked?\u201d Chris enquired.</p><p>\u201cThe grocery - I\u2019m just coming in from the market, I\u2019m hosting a dinner tonight,\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust what I wanted to hear to make me homesick,\u201d he laughed softly.</p><p>\u201cYou okay sweetie?\u201d Lisa asked, pausing deciphering her son\u2019s deflated tone.</p><p>\u201cYeah, just feel\u2026empty\u2026bored. Mya\u2019s gone out with her best friend Seb, and Dodger is sleeping. I don\u2019t know what to do, usually at this time we\u2019ll be watching <i>Curious George</i> together or at the park or debating what to eat for lunch,\u201d</p><p>\u201cAaw, that\u2019s normal,\u201d Lisa said. \u201cYou just need to find something to do to without her. It\u2019s okay to have an independent life outside of her, it\u2019s not good for both of you to always be in each other\u2019s space,\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard, I\u2019m trying to let go, but I feel bad if I don\u2019t spend much time with her because once my shows I won\u2019t be around much and then it\u2019ll be <i>Avengers</i> soon after and we\u2019ll have to be away from each other again,\u201d Chris explained. \u201cI seem to cope better with this when she\u2019s not around because then I\u2019m not physically in close proximity to be so protective of her,\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut think of it this way; once you finish with this <i>Avengers</i> film, she\u2019s all yours. You did say you wanted to take a break after and let her go to school,\u201d Lisa reasoned.</p><p>Chris nodded, as if his mom could see. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right. I guess it\u2019s just still getting used to this parenting thing,\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll keep learning. Use your time alone to rest and unwind, or go out, some \u2018me-time\u2019 will be good for you,\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmhhh,\u201d Chris contemplated, he wondered if that would make him selfish. He quickly snapped out of the thought. \u201cJheeze, Chris, such a downer. Who\u2019s coming to dinner?\u201d</p><p>Lisa laughed at her son, imagining his face as he ridiculed himself, \u201cYour uncles, Scott, Shana, Carly and the kids. It was Scott\u2019s idea. Think we\u2019ll be seeing you here anytime soon?\u201d</p><p>Chris bit his bottom lip, racking his brain quickly for his schedule; \u201cI have a week off in a month, I don\u2019t know where Mya will be. I\u2019ll figure something out,\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould be good for you to take sometime out and switch off, and have her here to play with her cousins,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need it, maybe we could do Disney with her. She\u2019d love it,\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe more you, than her,\u201d Lisa corrected, knowing very well, that any excuse for Chris to go to Disney, he would exploit it.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s some truth in that,\u201d</p><p>The conversation progressed with Chris asking what was on the menu for dinner; he really missed home. He loved his mom\u2019s cooking, being around his siblings and their kids, and friends and their kids too. Boston gave him that respite to be just himself and fully relax which he couldn\u2019t do here in New York, the fact that he was living in a hotel, (which wasn\u2019t a luxury that he took for granted) served as a reminder of his double life. Even his home in LA, the extravagant house tucked in the hills with other celebrities as neighbours, was of the same sentiment; but nothing ever compared to Boston. He found it more grounding and the pace of life was slower, no one cared who he was there nor even noticed him, because in Boston no one is ever looking to spot a celebrity.</p><p>It made him terribly homesick to know that his family was going to be gathered under one roof and enjoying each other\u2019s company, whilst he sat alone in a hotel room, not sure if his daughter would even be back to join him for dinner.</p><p>\u201cSo, if you do come to Boston in a few weeks, should I expect a guest?\u201d</p><p>Chris could tell by his mom\u2019s intonation that she wasn\u2019t talking about a friend like last time, when he\u2019d visited with Seb. She was referring to a woman. For some reason when his mom brought up the topic about his dating life, he didn\u2019t mind so much; supposedly he knew he couldn\u2019t be defensive with her like he was with his friends, she could read him like a book, even over the phone. He was always honest with her because she always gave him the space and opportunity to be vulnerable with her; the same kid that ran home at 13 years old to tell her he\u2019d just lost his virginity.</p><p>\u201cAfraid not, it\u2019ll just be the three of us as usual,\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you looking? Have you been dating \u2013 because you have been quiet the last few weeks, I thought someone\u2019s come along and stole your attention,\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can blame my new schedule and these two kids of mine,\u201d he said referring to Dodger as well. \u201cAnd no, I haven\u2019t been looking or dating. I just don\u2019t have the time,\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do right now in this very moment, Chris,\u201d Lisa challenged.</p><p>\u201cYou say it like I can just walk outside and pick a woman,\u201d Chris scoffed.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean, I\u2019m just saying,\u201d Lisa reasoned. \u201cAnd it\u2019s been so long since you\u2019ve been on the scene, you might lose your charm if you keep away,\u201d</p><p>Tickled by her honesty, Chris drew his head back with laughter, \u201cWow, my own mother ladies and gentlemen,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want you to be happy,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am ma,\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but there\u2019s something missing. Do you really want the only company you keep around you to be a toddler and a dog that you can\u2019t have adult conversations with? Is this why you\u2019re always on Twitter now?\u201d</p><p>Chris roared with laughed again, this time his hand grabbing his left pec, slightly offended but she was actually right. He would find himself berating Donald Trump on his TV screen and look to Dodger and Mya in shock for their support.</p><p><i>\u201cCan you believe this guy?\u201d he would ask exasperatedly, receiving nothing in return but questioning glances from the dog and toddler. He would then go on his Twitter and continue his rant, starting a dialogue with his congregation of followers or his industry allies.</i></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re unbelievable,\u201d</p><p>\u201cFood for thought Chris. Speaking of food, I really have to go start prepping all this, Facetime you later when everyone\u2019s here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please do,\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive my grandbaby a hug and a kiss for me, okay? I love you,\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you ma,\u201d</p><p>Before hanging up, Lisa fired her one last shot, \u201cAnd join Tinder or something, that\u2019ll cure your boredom,\u201d</p><p>Chris chuckled in disbelief when she hang up abruptly after her Tinder proposal. Clutching a cushion to his chest and deciding to take his mom\u2019s advice \u2013 not to join Tinder, but to revel in his quiet time, he put the phone on the table. He was going to count sheep until sleep consumed him, because frankly he needed the rest. Tomorrow was going to be a busy day, and he would need all the energy he could muster to spread evenly across his <i>Lobby Hero </i>rehearsal, interview with Jimmy Fallon, and a press event in the evening.</p><p>______________</p><p><b>Disclaimer: </b>Gif Not My Own</p><p><b>Tagged As Requested:\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maLh-Z_n-WYz5Bi4f6bAp6A\"></a></b><a>@mississippifangirl</a>\u200b @<a href=\"https://thinemineours.tumblr.com/\">thinemineours</a> @tessathedragon <a>@thottio</a>\u200b @<a href=\"https://caninoona.tumblr.com/\">caninoona</a> @<a href=\"https://eratotalles.tumblr.com/\">eratotalles</a> @<a href=\"https://allonszassbutt.tumblr.com/\">allonszassbutt</a> @<a href=\"https://thinemineours.tumblr.com/\">thinemineours</a> @<a href=\"https://dreamingwithmendes.tumblr.com/\">dreamingwithmendes</a> <a>@void-imaginations</a>\u200b <a>@daybreak96</a>\u200b <a>@l-auteuse</a>\u200b @cliffordasparagus @<a href=\"http://bumber-car-s.tumblr.com/\">bumber-car-s</a></p></p>",

It\u2019s okay to have an independent life outside of her, it\u2019s not good for both of you to always be in each other\u2019s space,\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard, I\u2019m trying to let go, but I feel bad if I don\u2019t spend much time with her because once my shows I won\u2019t be around much and then it\u2019ll be <i>Avengers</i> soon after and we\u2019ll have to be away from each other again,\u201d Chris explained. \u201cI seem to cope better with this when she\u2019s not around because then I\u2019m not physically in close proximity to be so protective of her,\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut think of it this way; once you finish with this <i>Avengers</i> film, she\u2019s all yours. You did say you wanted to take a break after and let her go to school,\u201d Lisa reasoned.</p><p>Chris nodded, as if his mom could see. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right. I guess it\u2019s just still getting used to this parenting thing,\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll keep learning. Use your time alone to rest and unwind, or go out, some \u2018me-time\u2019 will be good for you,\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmhhh,\u201d Chris contemplated, he wondered if that would make him selfish. He quickly snapped out of the thought. \u201cJheeze, Chris, such a downer. Who\u2019s coming to dinner?\u201d</p><p>Lisa laughed at her son, imagining his face as he ridiculed himself, \u201cYour uncles, Scott, Shana, Carly and the kids. It was Scott\u2019s idea. Think we\u2019ll be seeing you here anytime soon?\u201d</p><p>Chris bit his bottom lip, racking his brain quickly for his schedule; \u201cI have a week off in a month, I don\u2019t know where Mya will be. I\u2019ll figure something out,\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould be good for you to take sometime out and switch off, and have her here to play with her cousins,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need it, maybe we could do Disney with her. She\u2019d love it,\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe more you, than her,\u201d Lisa corrected, knowing very well, that any excuse for Chris to go to Disney, he would exploit it.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s some truth in that,\u201d</p><p>The conversation progressed with Chris asking what was on the menu for dinner; he really missed home. He loved his mom\u2019s cooking, being around his siblings and their kids, and friends and their kids too. Boston gave him that respite to be just himself and fully relax which he couldn\u2019t do here in New York, the fact that he was living in a hotel, (which wasn\u2019t a luxury that he took for granted) served as a reminder of his double life. Even his home in LA, the extravagant house tucked in the hills with other celebrities as neighbours, was of the same sentiment; but nothing ever compared to Boston. He found it more grounding and the pace of life was slower, no one cared who he was there nor even noticed him, because in Boston no one is ever looking to spot a celebrity.</p><p>It made him terribly homesick to know that his family was going to be gathered under one roof and enjoying each other\u2019s company, whilst he sat alone in a hotel room, not sure if his daughter would even be back to join him for dinner.</p><p>\u201cSo, if you do come to Boston in a few weeks, should I expect a guest?\u201d</p><p>Chris could tell by his mom\u2019s intonation that she wasn\u2019t talking about a friend like last time, when he\u2019d visited with Seb. She was referring to a woman. For some reason when his mom brought up the topic about his dating life, he didn\u2019t mind so much; supposedly he knew he couldn\u2019t be defensive with her like he was with his friends, she could read him like a book, even over the phone. He was always honest with her because she always gave him the space and opportunity to be vulnerable with her; the same kid that ran home at 13 years old to tell her he\u2019d just lost his virginity.</p><p>\u201cAfraid not, it\u2019ll just be the three of us as usual,\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you looking? Have you been dating \u2013 because you have been quiet the last few weeks, I thought someone\u2019s come along and stole your attention,\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can blame my new schedule and these two kids of mine,\u201d he said referring to Dodger as well. \u201cAnd no, I haven\u2019t been looking or dating. I just don\u2019t have the time,\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do right now in this very moment, Chris,\u201d Lisa challenged.</p><p>\u201cYou say it like I can just walk outside and pick a woman,\u201d Chris scoffed.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean, I\u2019m just saying,\u201d Lisa reasoned. \u201cAnd it\u2019s been so long since you\u2019ve been on the scene, you might lose your charm if you keep away,\u201d</p><p>Tickled by her honesty, Chris drew his head back with laughter, \u201cWow, my own mother ladies and gentlemen,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want you to be happy,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am ma,\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but there\u2019s something missing. Do you really want the only company you keep around you to be a toddler and a dog that you can\u2019t have adult conversations with? Is this why you\u2019re always on Twitter now?\u201d</p><p>Chris roared with laughed again, this time his hand grabbing his left pec, slightly offended but she was actually right. He would find himself berating Donald Trump on his TV screen and look to Dodger and Mya in shock for their support.</p><p><i>\u201cCan you believe this guy?\u201d he would ask exasperatedly, receiving nothing in return but questioning glances from the dog and toddler. He would then go on his Twitter and continue his rant, starting a dialogue with his congregation of followers or his industry allies.</i></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re unbelievable,\u201d</p><p>\u201cFood for thought Chris. Speaking of food, I really have to go start prepping all this, Facetime you later when everyone\u2019s here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please do,\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive my grandbaby a hug and a kiss for me, okay? I love you,\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you ma,\u201d</p><p>Before hanging up, Lisa fired her one last shot, \u201cAnd join Tinder or something, that\u2019ll cure your boredom,\u201d</p><p>Chris chuckled in disbelief when she hang up abruptly after her Tinder proposal. Clutching a cushion to his chest and deciding to take his mom\u2019s advice \u2013 not to join Tinder, but to revel in his quiet time, he put the phone on the table. He was going to count sheep until sleep consumed him, because frankly he needed the rest. Tomorrow was going to be a busy day, and he would need all the energy he could muster to spread evenly across his <i>Lobby Hero </i>rehearsal, interview with Jimmy Fallon, and a press event in the evening.</p><p>______________</p><p><b>Disclaimer: </b>Gif Not My Own</p><p><b>Tagged As Requested:\u00a0 <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maLh-Z_n-WYz5Bi4f6bAp6A\"></a></b><a>@mississippifangirl</a>\u200b @<a href=\"https://thinemineours.tumblr.com/\">thinemineours</a> @tessathedragon <a>@thottio</a>\u200b @<a href=\"https://caninoona.tumblr.com/\">caninoona</a> @<a href=\"https://eratotalles.tumblr.com/\">eratotalles</a> @<a href=\"https://allonszassbutt.tumblr.com/\">allonszassbutt</a> @<a href=\"https://thinemineours.tumblr.com/\">thinemineours</a> @<a href=\"https://dreamingwithmendes.tumblr.com/\">dreamingwithmendes</a> <a>@void-imaginations</a>\u200b <a>@daybreak96</a>\u200b <a>@l-auteuse</a>\u200b @cliffordasparagus @<a href=\"http://bumber-car-s.tumblr.com/\">bumber-car-s</a></p></p>",

Was. Bored.</p><p>He looked at Dodger with envy, as he was sound asleep on his little bed. If only he could fall into a nap to cure his boredom, but it seemed the harder he tried the more alert he became. Without Mya around, he always noticed how quiet it was and how such a small person could occupy so much of his space and time. He wasn&rsquo;t complaining, at all. His eyes scanned the living area of their suite; her toys were neatly strewn here and there, serving as a reminder of her absence. Her little tea-party table hosted two teddy bear guests that sat on separate chairs, the other two empty; reserved for Chris and herself, and a little space in between with stacked cushions for Dodger because she didn&rsquo;t want him to feel left out.</p><p>Now Chris wished she was there: poking his ear, playing with his beard, painting his toe nails, smothering Dodger in hair gel, watching cartoons all day long and pouring him fake tea and pretending to eat cupcakes. Sometimes they bought real food for the tea party but they mostly ate it at the big dining table because Chris couldn&rsquo;t last long in that small space.</p><p>Clearly, his life <i>was</i> all about Mya, Dodger and scripts. Even more now, that he&rsquo;d brought Mya with him to New York for the next few months whilst he was rehearsing for <i>Lobby Hero, </i>she was his priority<i>.</i> He wasn&rsquo;t too sure how it was going to work once the shows started; whether it was fair to have her shared between Seb or his assistant Tiffany, or if he would rather just take her back to LA to stay with her grandma. The latter seemed to be a more stable solution for her because soon after his Broadway days, he would be filming his last <i>Avengers</i> installment, which meant more time away from home and her. His heart ached at the thought, he&rsquo;d bonded so much with her in the last few weeks that they had been in New York together and had seen so much growth in her every day. He feared that very soon he&rsquo;d be missing out and hearing about it over the phone from her grandma. It just wouldn&rsquo;t be the same. She was picking up new words, new habits and even copying his behaviours; which he often found funny.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Oh man!&rdquo; she would exclaim if she dropped a toy or made a mistake. </i></p><p><i> </i></p><p><i>It used to be &lsquo;oh shit,&rsquo; (well, only once) because she&rsquo;d heard it from none other. Chris quickly realised how much of a sponge she was, even when he thought she wasn&rsquo;t watching or listening; he would later see her exhibit his behaviours.</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p><i>Or she&rsquo;d greet Dodger with a, &ldquo;Hi buddy,&rdquo;</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p><i>And in the mornings, she copied her dad&rsquo;s routine too; she would brush her teeth with him, wash her face and splatter water everywhere, and mutter a small &ldquo;oh man.&rdquo; After brushing their teeth and washing their faces, Chris would pick up a script or newspaper to read over breakfast, Mya would bring her drawing pad. Breakfast was always a fruit platter and dry seeded bread; or plain oatmeal with just a drizzle of honey since he was slowly easing into his Cap diet. Mya drew the line at the dry seeded bread though, she preferred white bread smothered in butter and jam, and instead of a coffee or green juice like her dad, an orange juice was her go-to. Chris always diluted it because he found out that Mya and sugar were a dangerous combination, add Dodger to the mix and it was a real fucking party.</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Yuck!&rdquo; she grimaced at the oatmeal once when Chris had tried to get her to try something new.</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;One bite, look, daddy&rsquo;s putting Nutella in it,&rdquo;</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t want it, yuck,&rdquo; she then fake gagged, making Chris stop immediately, sighing and gave in to her demands of jammy toast and a bowl of strawberries.</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What kid doesn&rsquo;t like Nutella?&rdquo; he mumbled to himself.</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p>Chris finally pushed his hair back and compartmentalised the wistful spiral of thoughts and checked his phone, hoping that maybe Sebastian had texted to say she wanted to come home. He wouldn&rsquo;t even mind if Mya had decided she missed her dad too much and cut their little ice cream date short. He was regretting telling Sebastian to bring her back when the sugar had worn off. Checking the time on his phone; it&rsquo;d only been an hour since they&rsquo;d left and it was going to be a while until they came back. He exhaled, and called the best person to help him get him out of his misery, before he let the thoughts build up and exacerbate his anxiety.</p><p><i>So Sebastian was right,</i> Chris concluded begrudgingly as he held the phone to his ear; his life truly evolved around Mya, Dodger and scripts.</p><p> &ldquo;Hey ma,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi honey, I was just about to call you once I unpacked,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Unpacked?&rdquo; Chris enquired.</p><p>&ldquo;The grocery - I&rsquo;m just coming in from the market, I&rsquo;m hosting a dinner tonight,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just what I wanted to hear to make me homesick,&rdquo; he laughed softly.</p><p>&ldquo;You okay sweetie?&rdquo; Lisa asked, pausing deciphering her son&rsquo;s deflated tone.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, just feel&hellip;empty&hellip;bored. Mya&rsquo;s gone out with her best friend Seb, and Dodger is sleeping. I don&rsquo;t know what to do, usually at this time we&rsquo;ll be watching <i>Curious George</i> together or at the park or debating what to eat for lunch,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aaw, that&rsquo;s normal,&rdquo; Lisa said. &ldquo;You just need to find something to do to without her.
