        "caption": "<h2>Day Eleven <br/></h2><p><b>Gendry and Arya build a gingerbread house in a competition against Jon and Robb.</b></p><!-- more --><p>To say Arya was confused was an understatement. Gendry had texted her last night and told her she needed to come to his apartment tonight by six o\u2019clock. So here she was sitting in her car outside Gendry, Jon, and Robb\u2019s apartment five blocks from the Stormland\u2019s campus. Where she would hopefully be attending next year. Her brothers and Gendry were all juniors this year. Although both her brothers were planning on going to graduate school in the next few years. </p><p>She had yet to go inside because their car was not parked outside. She wondered what the hell was going on. After another five minutes another car pulled into the parking lot and their unmistakable forms emerged, and they looked to be carrying boxes. Decently sized boxes at that. Wasting no time Arya turned off her engine and climbed out of her small car, closing the door behind her with a small thud. The walk to their second story apartment wasn\u2019t a long one, but it was quite a cold night and she had all she could not to run up the stairs. She had better balance than most men, but she was convinced that even she would fall on the ice. When she reached the door she knocked on it loudly. Jon opened it almost immediately. He must\u2019ve still been standing in the entryway. He picked her up in a tight hug and carried her inside. He set her down on the tile floor and waited for her to remove her boots before he walked into the kitchen. Arya followed shortly after hanging her coat up and placing her gloves and hat on the radiator. She was wearing her favorite Night\u2019s Watch t-shirt that Jon had gotten her when he went to their concert a few years back, somehow she hadn\u2019t managed to rip it yet. </p><p>Their kitchen wasn\u2019t very large but it had an island the looked into the living room, Arya thought it was an attempt to make the small space seem bigger. On the \u00a0island were the two large boxes she saw them with earlier as well as a few bags of pretzels and various candies. Arya\u2019s eye lit up immediately, she saw Jon and Robb smirk. Gendry on the other hand stood there confused, typical bull. </p><p>\u201cCan someone explain to me why Arya and you two turned into a pack of hungry wolves?\u201d Gendry asked, his hands still resting on top of one of the gingerbread houses he pulled from a paper bag. His eyes locked on Arya\u2019s and it felt like they were piercing into her soul. They were those breathtaking blue eyes that haunted her dreams at night. Those blue eyes that belonged to a man she could never call her\u2019s. She had put her pride aside before and asked him to her homecoming dance, but he had rejected her. Although he did it the nicest way he knew how, Arya understood his message loud and clear. She was and forever will be Arya horseface. She should have known Gendry wouldn\u2019t like her. With the number of girls that were always fawning over him why would he choose her? Why would he when there were people like Sansa? Your typical beautiful girl who swoons over you and won\u2019t challenge your masculinity. Arya hadn\u2019t tried to seek out a romantic partner since the incident with Gendry and most boys weren\u2019t interested in her. Many men had told her that she acted to much like a boy to ever have anyone want her that way. She was done with society\u2019s sexist rules and how women were treated as dainty and unworthy. She didn\u2019t need a man to make her happy, but she wondered how having one would make her feel\u2026 Would she feel different if she had someone in her life that treated her differently? </p><p>\u201cArya?\u201d She heard as she snapped out of her daze, \u201cYou okay over there?\u201d </p><p>She nodded her head and walked over to the counter where the items laid out. \u201cWell, I know exactly what&rsquo;s happening here.\u201d Gendry still looked confused, of course. \u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious? We\u2019re having a gingerbread house competition!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d we only get two gingerbread houses then?\u201d Gendry questioned.</p><p>\u201cOur family only plays in teams. So we\u2019re having a face off. So, I want J-\u201d</p><p>\u201cRobb and I have already decided that we\u2019re going to be a team.\u201d Jon interrupted his sister. She looked furious, but then an evil glint shown in her eyes. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to regret that.\u201d Arya pointed a finger at her favorite sibling. She turned to Gendry and poked a finger into his chest, ignoring the excitement she felt when it hit nothing but muscle. \u201cI hope you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>They stood there staring at into each other\u2019s eyes for a moment ignoring the knowing stares from both of Arya\u2019s brothers. After who knows how long of grey staring down blue, Robb coughed and broke them out of their daze. Neither had known that Gendry had grabbed Arya\u2019s hand that moved from poking his chest to gently resting there. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to crush you.\u201d Arya said annoyed. Gendry\u2019s hand had moved to rest on her lower back in a comforting manner, unbeknownst to Robb and Jon. Arya forced the red off of her cheeks, ducking her head so no one could see her blushing.</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s get to it then!\u201d Robb said clapping his hands together. Jon laughed and grabbed one of the boxes. He brought it to the other end of the counter and unfolded the cardboard box so there was a large base to build their house on. Arya immediately did the same. She motioned for Gendry to grab a bag of pretzels and a few bags of various candies. She began by massaging the bag of frosting, ignoring the way Gendry\u2019s eyes followed her hands as they softened the bag of buttercream. It took him a moment before he grabbed a few pieces on gingerbread and helped Arya to begin stacking them accordingly. She was planning on building a castle, not Winterfell, the castle her family held back in the days of the first men, but a typical one you would see in the storybooks. Her and Gendry peaked across the counter and saw that Jon and Robb were building what looked to be a log cabin. She smiled and continued to work on their modest castle. Gendry was working on building a forest made from ice cream cones on the other side of their piece of cardboard. Arya had to admit that she was impressed at his work for someone who had never built a gingerbread house before. </p><p>\u201cWhat do you two think?\u201d Jon asked, \u201cLet\u2019s say thirty minutes left?\u201d Everyone agreed that that should be more than enough time to finish their masterpieces. Arya and Gendry were putting the last touches on their roof while Robb and Jon added ice cycles to their cabin. </p><p>\u201cTime!\u201d Robb called out much louder than he needed to. Arya jumped and was caught by a pair of strong arms. Gendry was holding her to his chest. She could feel every inch of his body where they were connected. One hand was resting on the skin exposed at her hip where her shirt had rode up. His hand felt like it was on fire, not that he would ever say that out loud for her to hear. He had turned her down once, much to his dismay, but he knew that if he had said yes that both Robb and Jon would gut him like a fish. Arya was their baby sister and no man would ever be good enough for her, no matter if it were himself or the crowned prince. So all those feelings he had for her for the past few years he pushed aside. His relationship with Arya had been strained since he turned down her proposal of going to her homecoming dance. He wished with all his being that he had said yes when he saw her that night before she left. She had been wearing a tight and too short black dress and her hair was down in loose waves around her face. Gendry had never seen anything so beautiful and he wanted to tell her so, but it took her months to even talk to him again and seven hells if he was going to lose her again. </p><p>Gendry leaned in close and whispered in Arya\u2019s ear, his mouth accidentally touching the soft skin of her earlobe. \u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, I think we won.\u201d</p><p>Arya shivered as a chill made its way from her neck to her toes. She relaxed and felt her body rest even more on Gendry, allowing him to hold almost all of her body weight. She rested her hand on his that was still pressed into her hip before she allowed herself to stand freely on her own two feet. Robb and Jon were still focused on their own gingerbread house to notice the exchange between their youngest sister and their friend. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll admit it, you did a good job.\u201d Arya said moving to stand between her brothers. Jon wrapped his arm around her shoulder as Robb slapped Gendry on the back. </p><p>\u201cAye, it turned out really well, but I think you and Gendry might have outdone us this time. We\u2019ll get you next year though.\u201d Arya chuckled at that, Robb nodded in agreement. \u201cNow if you excuse us, Robb and I have dates tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that means I should get going then.\u201d Arya started to move to gather her things. </p><p>\u201cWait, why?\u201d Robb asked confused. \u201cWe thought you\u2019d stay here with Gendry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, why would you think that?\u201d Gendry questioned, Robb\u2019s grip on his shoulder tightened. </p><p>\u201cFor starters, everyone knows you fancy each other. We figured that you\u2019d have both gotten together by now, but seven hells, you two are moving agonizingly slow and everyone thinks that you need a push. So, here it is, a push.\u201d Robb stated, Jon stood next to him now nodding his head in agreement. </p><p>\u201cAre you two out of your minds?\u201d Arya bellowed, her head going into her hands embarrassed. She felt two hands on her wrists, but she moved to pull away. Their grip remained unmoving, not allowing her to get away. She heard some shuffling and then a door shutting loudly</p><p>\u201cArya, open your eyes and look at me please.\u201d Gendry pleaded. Arya lifted her face and looked him in the eyes. \u201cI know I messed up once, but I swear it\u2019s only because I thought myself unworthy. Well, that and I thought your brothers would kill me and wide my body in a ditch somewhere in the Stormlands. But I\u2019m here now and everyone has made it clear that I can finally act on my feelings for you. Arya, please, tell me now if you still feel the way you did when you asked me to your homecoming dance. If you no longer feel that way towards me I understand, but I need to tell you how I truly feel.\u201d</p><p>The younger girl looked up at him and when he moved to speak again, Arya leapt up and threw her arms around his neck. His head was buried in her neck, Arya\u2019s hand grabbing at the hair at the nape of his neck. Gendry pulled back and looked into Arya\u2019s eye for a moment before leaning in tentatively. When his lips met hers it felt like pure bliss. They moved slowly at first, exploring each other\u2019s mouths with pure curiosity that spanned over years and years. Their innocent kiss deepened quickly. Their tongues fighting each other with passion. Gendry lifted Arya up and moved to set her on the counter, accidentally sending Jon and Robb\u2019s gingerbread castle to the tiled floor below. </p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d He yelled and pulled away from Arya. She laughed at how his hair stuck up in different directions. He turned and looked at her like she were mad. </p><p>\u201cI guess that\u2019s one way to ensure we win the gingerbread contest.\u201d Gendry rested his forehead on hers as a small huff of laughter escaped him. He could get used to this.</p>",

Her brothers and Gendry were all juniors this year. Although both her brothers were planning on going to graduate school in the next few years. </p><p>She had yet to go inside because their car was not parked outside. She wondered what the hell was going on. After another five minutes another car pulled into the parking lot and their unmistakable forms emerged, and they looked to be carrying boxes. Decently sized boxes at that. Wasting no time Arya turned off her engine and climbed out of her small car, closing the door behind her with a small thud. The walk to their second story apartment wasn\u2019t a long one, but it was quite a cold night and she had all she could not to run up the stairs. She had better balance than most men, but she was convinced that even she would fall on the ice. When she reached the door she knocked on it loudly. Jon opened it almost immediately. He must\u2019ve still been standing in the entryway. He picked her up in a tight hug and carried her inside. He set her down on the tile floor and waited for her to remove her boots before he walked into the kitchen. Arya followed shortly after hanging her coat up and placing her gloves and hat on the radiator. She was wearing her favorite Night\u2019s Watch t-shirt that Jon had gotten her when he went to their concert a few years back, somehow she hadn\u2019t managed to rip it yet. </p><p>Their kitchen wasn\u2019t very large but it had an island the looked into the living room, Arya thought it was an attempt to make the small space seem bigger. On the \u00a0island were the two large boxes she saw them with earlier as well as a few bags of pretzels and various candies. Arya\u2019s eye lit up immediately, she saw Jon and Robb smirk. Gendry on the other hand stood there confused, typical bull. </p><p>\u201cCan someone explain to me why Arya and you two turned into a pack of hungry wolves?\u201d Gendry asked, his hands still resting on top of one of the gingerbread houses he pulled from a paper bag. His eyes locked on Arya\u2019s and it felt like they were piercing into her soul. They were those breathtaking blue eyes that haunted her dreams at night. Those blue eyes that belonged to a man she could never call her\u2019s. She had put her pride aside before and asked him to her homecoming dance, but he had rejected her. Although he did it the nicest way he knew how, Arya understood his message loud and clear. She was and forever will be Arya horseface. She should have known Gendry wouldn\u2019t like her. With the number of girls that were always fawning over him why would he choose her? Why would he when there were people like Sansa? Your typical beautiful girl who swoons over you and won\u2019t challenge your masculinity. Arya hadn\u2019t tried to seek out a romantic partner since the incident with Gendry and most boys weren\u2019t interested in her. Many men had told her that she acted to much like a boy to ever have anyone want her that way. She was done with society\u2019s sexist rules and how women were treated as dainty and unworthy. She didn\u2019t need a man to make her happy, but she wondered how having one would make her feel\u2026 Would she feel different if she had someone in her life that treated her differently? </p><p>\u201cArya?\u201d She heard as she snapped out of her daze, \u201cYou okay over there?\u201d </p><p>She nodded her head and walked over to the counter where the items laid out. \u201cWell, I know exactly what\u2019s happening here.\u201d Gendry still looked confused, of course. \u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious? We\u2019re having a gingerbread house competition!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d we only get two gingerbread houses then?\u201d Gendry questioned.</p><p>\u201cOur family only plays in teams. So we\u2019re having a face off. So, I want J-\u201d</p><p>\u201cRobb and I have already decided that we\u2019re going to be a team.\u201d Jon interrupted his sister. She looked furious, but then an evil glint shown in her eyes. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to regret that.\u201d Arya pointed a finger at her favorite sibling. She turned to Gendry and poked a finger into his chest, ignoring the excitement she felt when it hit nothing but muscle. \u201cI hope you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>They stood there staring at into each other\u2019s eyes for a moment ignoring the knowing stares from both of Arya\u2019s brothers. After who knows how long of grey staring down blue, Robb coughed and broke them out of their daze. Neither had known that Gendry had grabbed Arya\u2019s hand that moved from poking his chest to gently resting there. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to crush you.\u201d Arya said annoyed. Gendry\u2019s hand had moved to rest on her lower back in a comforting manner, unbeknownst to Robb and Jon. Arya forced the red off of her cheeks, ducking her head so no one could see her blushing.</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s get to it then!\u201d Robb said clapping his hands together. Jon laughed and grabbed one of the boxes. He brought it to the other end of the counter and unfolded the cardboard box so there was a large base to build their house on. Arya immediately did the same. She motioned for Gendry to grab a bag of pretzels and a few bags of various candies. She began by massaging the bag of frosting, ignoring the way Gendry\u2019s eyes followed her hands as they softened the bag of buttercream. It took him a moment before he grabbed a few pieces on gingerbread and helped Arya to begin stacking them accordingly. She was planning on building a castle, not Winterfell, the castle her family held back in the days of the first men, but a typical one you would see in the storybooks. Her and Gendry peaked across the counter and saw that Jon and Robb were building what looked to be a log cabin. She smiled and continued to work on their modest castle. Gendry was working on building a forest made from ice cream cones on the other side of their piece of cardboard. Arya had to admit that she was impressed at his work for someone who had never built a gingerbread house before. </p><p>\u201cWhat do you two think?\u201d Jon asked, \u201cLet\u2019s say thirty minutes left?\u201d Everyone agreed that that should be more than enough time to finish their masterpieces. Arya and Gendry were putting the last touches on their roof while Robb and Jon added ice cycles to their cabin. </p><p>\u201cTime!\u201d Robb called out much louder than he needed to. Arya jumped and was caught by a pair of strong arms. Gendry was holding her to his chest. She could feel every inch of his body where they were connected. One hand was resting on the skin exposed at her hip where her shirt had rode up. His hand felt like it was on fire, not that he would ever say that out loud for her to hear. He had turned her down once, much to his dismay, but he knew that if he had said yes that both Robb and Jon would gut him like a fish. Arya was their baby sister and no man would ever be good enough for her, no matter if it were himself or the crowned prince. So all those feelings he had for her for the past few years he pushed aside. His relationship with Arya had been strained since he turned down her proposal of going to her homecoming dance. He wished with all his being that he had said yes when he saw her that night before she left. She had been wearing a tight and too short black dress and her hair was down in loose waves around her face. Gendry had never seen anything so beautiful and he wanted to tell her so, but it took her months to even talk to him again and seven hells if he was going to lose her again. </p><p>Gendry leaned in close and whispered in Arya\u2019s ear, his mouth accidentally touching the soft skin of her earlobe. \u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, I think we won.\u201d</p><p>Arya shivered as a chill made its way from her neck to her toes. She relaxed and felt her body rest even more on Gendry, allowing him to hold almost all of her body weight. She rested her hand on his that was still pressed into her hip before she allowed herself to stand freely on her own two feet. Robb and Jon were still focused on their own gingerbread house to notice the exchange between their youngest sister and their friend. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll admit it, you did a good job.\u201d Arya said moving to stand between her brothers. Jon wrapped his arm around her shoulder as Robb slapped Gendry on the back. </p><p>\u201cAye, it turned out really well, but I think you and Gendry might have outdone us this time. We\u2019ll get you next year though.\u201d Arya chuckled at that, Robb nodded in agreement. \u201cNow if you excuse us, Robb and I have dates tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that means I should get going then.\u201d Arya started to move to gather her things. </p><p>\u201cWait, why?\u201d Robb asked confused. \u201cWe thought you\u2019d stay here with Gendry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, why would you think that?\u201d Gendry questioned, Robb\u2019s grip on his shoulder tightened. </p><p>\u201cFor starters, everyone knows you fancy each other. We figured that you\u2019d have both gotten together by now, but seven hells, you two are moving agonizingly slow and everyone thinks that you need a push. So, here it is, a push.\u201d Robb stated, Jon stood next to him now nodding his head in agreement. </p><p>\u201cAre you two out of your minds?\u201d Arya bellowed, her head going into her hands embarrassed. She felt two hands on her wrists, but she moved to pull away. Their grip remained unmoving, not allowing her to get away. She heard some shuffling and then a door shutting loudly</p><p>\u201cArya, open your eyes and look at me please.\u201d Gendry pleaded. Arya lifted her face and looked him in the eyes. \u201cI know I messed up once, but I swear it\u2019s only because I thought myself unworthy. Well, that and I thought your brothers would kill me and wide my body in a ditch somewhere in the Stormlands. But I\u2019m here now and everyone has made it clear that I can finally act on my feelings for you. Arya, please, tell me now if you still feel the way you did when you asked me to your homecoming dance. If you no longer feel that way towards me I understand, but I need to tell you how I truly feel.\u201d</p><p>The younger girl looked up at him and when he moved to speak again, Arya leapt up and threw her arms around his neck. His head was buried in her neck, Arya\u2019s hand grabbing at the hair at the nape of his neck. Gendry pulled back and looked into Arya\u2019s eye for a moment before leaning in tentatively. When his lips met hers it felt like pure bliss. They moved slowly at first, exploring each other\u2019s mouths with pure curiosity that spanned over years and years. Their innocent kiss deepened quickly. Their tongues fighting each other with passion. Gendry lifted Arya up and moved to set her on the counter, accidentally sending Jon and Robb\u2019s gingerbread castle to the tiled floor below. </p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d He yelled and pulled away from Arya. She laughed at how his hair stuck up in different directions. He turned and looked at her like she were mad. </p><p>\u201cI guess that\u2019s one way to ensure we win the gingerbread contest.\u201d Gendry rested his forehead on hers as a small huff of laughter escaped him. He could get used to this.</p></p>",

Arya followed shortly after hanging her coat up and placing her gloves and hat on the radiator. She was wearing her favorite Night&rsquo;s Watch t-shirt that Jon had gotten her when he went to their concert a few years back, somehow she hadn&rsquo;t managed to rip it yet. </p><p>Their kitchen wasn&rsquo;t very large but it had an island the looked into the living room, Arya thought it was an attempt to make the small space seem bigger. On the &nbsp;island were the two large boxes she saw them with earlier as well as a few bags of pretzels and various candies. Arya&rsquo;s eye lit up immediately, she saw Jon and Robb smirk. Gendry on the other hand stood there confused, typical bull. </p><p>&ldquo;Can someone explain to me why Arya and you two turned into a pack of hungry wolves?&rdquo; Gendry asked, his hands still resting on top of one of the gingerbread houses he pulled from a paper bag. His eyes locked on Arya&rsquo;s and it felt like they were piercing into her soul. They were those breathtaking blue eyes that haunted her dreams at night. Those blue eyes that belonged to a man she could never call her&rsquo;s. She had put her pride aside before and asked him to her homecoming dance, but he had rejected her. Although he did it the nicest way he knew how, Arya understood his message loud and clear. She was and forever will be Arya horseface. She should have known Gendry wouldn&rsquo;t like her. With the number of girls that were always fawning over him why would he choose her? Why would he when there were people like Sansa? Your typical beautiful girl who swoons over you and won&rsquo;t challenge your masculinity. Arya hadn&rsquo;t tried to seek out a romantic partner since the incident with Gendry and most boys weren&rsquo;t interested in her. Many men had told her that she acted to much like a boy to ever have anyone want her that way. She was done with society&rsquo;s sexist rules and how women were treated as dainty and unworthy. She didn&rsquo;t need a man to make her happy, but she wondered how having one would make her feel&hellip; Would she feel different if she had someone in her life that treated her differently? </p><p>&ldquo;Arya?&rdquo; She heard as she snapped out of her daze, &ldquo;You okay over there?&rdquo; </p><p>She nodded her head and walked over to the counter where the items laid out. &ldquo;Well, I know exactly what&rsquo;s happening here.&rdquo; Gendry still looked confused, of course. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it obvious? We&rsquo;re having a gingerbread house competition!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why&rsquo;d we only get two gingerbread houses then?&rdquo; Gendry questioned.</p><p>&ldquo;Our family only plays in teams. So we&rsquo;re having a face off. So, I want J-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Robb and I have already decided that we&rsquo;re going to be a team.&rdquo; Jon interrupted his sister. She looked furious, but then an evil glint shown in her eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to regret that.&rdquo; Arya pointed a finger at her favorite sibling. She turned to Gendry and poked a finger into his chest, ignoring the excitement she felt when it hit nothing but muscle. &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re ready.&rdquo;</p><p>They stood there staring at into each other&rsquo;s eyes for a moment ignoring the knowing stares from both of Arya&rsquo;s brothers. After who knows how long of grey staring down blue, Robb coughed and broke them out of their daze. Neither had known that Gendry had grabbed Arya&rsquo;s hand that moved from poking his chest to gently resting there. </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to crush you.&rdquo; Arya said annoyed. Gendry&rsquo;s hand had moved to rest on her lower back in a comforting manner, unbeknownst to Robb and Jon. Arya forced the red off of her cheeks, ducking her head so no one could see her blushing.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s get to it then!&rdquo; Robb said clapping his hands together. Jon laughed and grabbed one of the boxes. He brought it to the other end of the counter and unfolded the cardboard box so there was a large base to build their house on. Arya immediately did the same. She motioned for Gendry to grab a bag of pretzels and a few bags of various candies. She began by massaging the bag of frosting, ignoring the way Gendry&rsquo;s eyes followed her hands as they softened the bag of buttercream. It took him a moment before he grabbed a few pieces on gingerbread and helped Arya to begin stacking them accordingly. She was planning on building a castle, not Winterfell, the castle her family held back in the days of the first men, but a typical one you would see in the storybooks. Her and Gendry peaked across the counter and saw that Jon and Robb were building what looked to be a log cabin. She smiled and continued to work on their modest castle. Gendry was working on building a forest made from ice cream cones on the other side of their piece of cardboard. Arya had to admit that she was impressed at his work for someone who had never built a gingerbread house before. </p><p>&ldquo;What do you two think?&rdquo; Jon asked, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s say thirty minutes left?&rdquo; Everyone agreed that that should be more than enough time to finish their masterpieces. Arya and Gendry were putting the last touches on their roof while Robb and Jon added ice cycles to their cabin. </p><p>&ldquo;Time!&rdquo; Robb called out much louder than he needed to. Arya jumped and was caught by a pair of strong arms. Gendry was holding her to his chest. She could feel every inch of his body where they were connected. One hand was resting on the skin exposed at her hip where her shirt had rode up. His hand felt like it was on fire, not that he would ever say that out loud for her to hear. He had turned her down once, much to his dismay, but he knew that if he had said yes that both Robb and Jon would gut him like a fish. Arya was their baby sister and no man would ever be good enough for her, no matter if it were himself or the crowned prince. So all those feelings he had for her for the past few years he pushed aside. His relationship with Arya had been strained since he turned down her proposal of going to her homecoming dance. He wished with all his being that he had said yes when he saw her that night before she left. She had been wearing a tight and too short black dress and her hair was down in loose waves around her face. Gendry had never seen anything so beautiful and he wanted to tell her so, but it took her months to even talk to him again and seven hells if he was going to lose her again. </p><p>Gendry leaned in close and whispered in Arya&rsquo;s ear, his mouth accidentally touching the soft skin of her earlobe. &ldquo;For what it&rsquo;s worth, I think we won.&rdquo;</p><p>Arya shivered as a chill made its way from her neck to her toes. She relaxed and felt her body rest even more on Gendry, allowing him to hold almost all of her body weight. She rested her hand on his that was still pressed into her hip before she allowed herself to stand freely on her own two feet. Robb and Jon were still focused on their own gingerbread house to notice the exchange between their youngest sister and their friend. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll admit it, you did a good job.&rdquo; Arya said moving to stand between her brothers. Jon wrapped his arm around her shoulder as Robb slapped Gendry on the back. </p><p>&ldquo;Aye, it turned out really well, but I think you and Gendry might have outdone us this time. We&rsquo;ll get you next year though.&rdquo; Arya chuckled at that, Robb nodded in agreement. &ldquo;Now if you excuse us, Robb and I have dates tonight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I guess that means I should get going then.&rdquo; Arya started to move to gather her things. </p><p>&ldquo;Wait, why?&rdquo; Robb asked confused. &ldquo;We thought you&rsquo;d stay here with Gendry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, why would you think that?&rdquo; Gendry questioned, Robb&rsquo;s grip on his shoulder tightened. </p><p>&ldquo;For starters, everyone knows you fancy each other. We figured that you&rsquo;d have both gotten together by now, but seven hells, you two are moving agonizingly slow and everyone thinks that you need a push. So, here it is, a push.&rdquo; Robb stated, Jon stood next to him now nodding his head in agreement. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you two out of your minds?&rdquo; Arya bellowed, her head going into her hands embarrassed. She felt two hands on her wrists, but she moved to pull away. Their grip remained unmoving, not allowing her to get away. She heard some shuffling and then a door shutting loudly</p><p>&ldquo;Arya, open your eyes and look at me please.&rdquo; Gendry pleaded. Arya lifted her face and looked him in the eyes. &ldquo;I know I messed up once, but I swear it&rsquo;s only because I thought myself unworthy. Well, that and I thought your brothers would kill me and wide my body in a ditch somewhere in the Stormlands. But I&rsquo;m here now and everyone has made it clear that I can finally act on my feelings for you. Arya, please, tell me now if you still feel the way you did when you asked me to your homecoming dance. If you no longer feel that way towards me I understand, but I need to tell you how I truly feel.&rdquo;</p><p>The younger girl looked up at him and when he moved to speak again, Arya leapt up and threw her arms around his neck. His head was buried in her neck, Arya&rsquo;s hand grabbing at the hair at the nape of his neck. Gendry pulled back and looked into Arya&rsquo;s eye for a moment before leaning in tentatively. When his lips met hers it felt like pure bliss. They moved slowly at first, exploring each other&rsquo;s mouths with pure curiosity that spanned over years and years. Their innocent kiss deepened quickly. Their tongues fighting each other with passion. Gendry lifted Arya up and moved to set her on the counter, accidentally sending Jon and Robb&rsquo;s gingerbread castle to the tiled floor below. </p><p>&ldquo;Shit!&rdquo; He yelled and pulled away from Arya. She laughed at how his hair stuck up in different directions. He turned and looked at her like she were mad. </p><p>&ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s one way to ensure we win the gingerbread contest.&rdquo; Gendry rested his forehead on hers as a small huff of laughter escaped him. He could get used to this.</p></p>",

Needle\nwas Winterfell&rsquo;s grey walls, and the laughter of its people. Needle was the summer snows,\nOld Nan&rsquo;s stories, the heart tree with its red leaves and scary face, the warm earthy smell\nof the glass gardens, the sound of the north wind rattling the shutters of her room. Needle\nwas Jon Snow&rsquo;s smile. He used to mess my hair and call me &ldquo;little sister,&rdquo; she\nremembered, and suddenly there were tears in her eyes<br /></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#9876;\n\n<br /></p><p>\n\nThe gods\nwanted me to have it.
