You were in the middle of grocery shopping as you finally\nhad some time to yourself and wanted to cook yourself your favorite meal as a\ncelebration that you had gotten through the tough past few days.</p><p>At the candy and chocolate isles, you bumped into Chris Evans and\nquickly apologized before going on with your day as you just wanted to get home\nand spend the rest of the late afternoon relaxing. Despite that your heart\nskipped a beat when your eyes first landed on him, you didn\u2019t want to get on\nsome celebrity\u2019s nerves and quickly walked away from him.</p><p>What you didn\u2019t know was that Chris immediately felt drawn to you and put\nhis plan of getting a few snacks aside as his new mission was to get to know\nyou as his gut told him that meeting someone as mesmerizing as you wouldn\u2019t\nhappen on a regular basis.</p><p>Chris then \u201caccidently\u201d bumped his cart against your backside a few\nminutes later, he pretended that he hadn\u2019t seen you while searching for his\nfavorite pasta. After he asked you about yours, you gave him some cooking tips\non how to make the perfect spaghetti Carbonara before moving away towards the\ncereals isles as you remembered that you were out of cereals.</p><p>There again, the actor reached out to the last box of your favorite cereals\nthe same time you did and then quickly apologized with a bright smile. Your gut\ntold you that he wanted to get to know you better while your head made you believe\nthat it was just a funny coincidence.</p><p><i>One more \u201ccoincidence\u201d and then I\u2019ll know</i>, was what you thought to yourself after thanking the\nactor as he generously let you have the last box of cereals. Your stomach was\nchurning and you felt an immense urge to stay with him but you cleared your throat\nand wished him a good day before pushing your cart to the dairy section.</p><p>Now, Chris found you looking for your favorite yoghurt and snuck up\nbehind you to ask about your favorite dairy products but ended up bumping his\ncart against your butt, again. You stopped yourself from grinning as you now\nknew that the actor was trying to stay close to you for the most obvious\nreason.</p><p>\u201cYou are the most beautiful woman I\u2019ve ever seen and I\u2019d be an idiot to\nnot at least try to ask you out\u201d the actor confessed while staring deeply into\nyour eyes, feeling stupid that he wasn\u2019t able to ask you out the second your\neyes first landed on each other. Chris normally didn\u2019t have a problem flirting\nand asking women out but ever since he had met you, he found himself not even\nbeing able to form a proper sentence while (literally) stalking you through the\ngrocery store.</p><p><b><i>\u00a0</i></b></p><p><b><i>Some show, some song, billboard or commercial</i></b><b><i><br/>\nDo you do the weather, do you read the news?<br/>\nGirl you got my head spinning around in circles<br/>\nAnd by the way I&rsquo;m looking at you<br/>\nAnd everybody else is too I&rsquo;m thinking<br/>\nGirl you look famous<br/>\nLike South Beach or Vegas<br/>\nAll up in the paper, in the supermarket aisle<br/>\nThat dress on you I swear<br/>\nI know you from somewhere<br/>\nGotta know what your name is<br/>\nCause God you look famous when you smile<br/>\nFamous when you smile<br/>\nYou got your elbows on the bar<br/>\nShinin&rsquo; in the blue neon</i></b><b><i></i></b></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThen ask me out, don\u2019t follow me like a lost puppy around the store\u201d\nyou chuckled to which the actor nodded his head. \u201cYeah, sorry for that.

You were in the middle of grocery shopping as you finally\nhad some time to yourself and wanted to cook yourself your favorite meal as a\ncelebration that you had gotten through the tough past few days.</p><p>At the candy and chocolate isles, you bumped into Chris Evans and\nquickly apologized before going on with your day as you just wanted to get home\nand spend the rest of the late afternoon relaxing. Despite that your heart\nskipped a beat when your eyes first landed on him, you didn\u2019t want to get on\nsome celebrity\u2019s nerves and quickly walked away from him.</p><p>What you didn\u2019t know was that Chris immediately felt drawn to you and put\nhis plan of getting a few snacks aside as his new mission was to get to know\nyou as his gut told him that meeting someone as mesmerizing as you wouldn\u2019t\nhappen on a regular basis.</p><p>Chris then \u201caccidently\u201d bumped his cart against your backside a few\nminutes later, he pretended that he hadn\u2019t seen you while searching for his\nfavorite pasta. After he asked you about yours, you gave him some cooking tips\non how to make the perfect spaghetti Carbonara before moving away towards the\ncereals isles as you remembered that you were out of cereals.</p><p>There again, the actor reached out to the last box of your favorite cereals\nthe same time you did and then quickly apologized with a bright smile. Your gut\ntold you that he wanted to get to know you better while your head made you believe\nthat it was just a funny coincidence.</p><p><i>One more \u201ccoincidence\u201d and then I\u2019ll know</i>, was what you thought to yourself after thanking the\nactor as he generously let you have the last box of cereals. Your stomach was\nchurning and you felt an immense urge to stay with him but you cleared your throat\nand wished him a good day before pushing your cart to the dairy section.</p><p>Now, Chris found you looking for your favorite yoghurt and snuck up\nbehind you to ask about your favorite dairy products but ended up bumping his\ncart against your butt, again. You stopped yourself from grinning as you now\nknew that the actor was trying to stay close to you for the most obvious\nreason.</p><p>\u201cYou are the most beautiful woman I\u2019ve ever seen and I\u2019d be an idiot to\nnot at least try to ask you out\u201d the actor confessed while staring deeply into\nyour eyes, feeling stupid that he wasn\u2019t able to ask you out the second your\neyes first landed on each other. Chris normally didn\u2019t have a problem flirting\nand asking women out but ever since he had met you, he found himself not even\nbeing able to form a proper sentence while (literally) stalking you through the\ngrocery store.</p><p><b><i>\u00a0</i></b></p><p><b><i>Some show, some song, billboard or commercial</i></b><b><i><br>\nDo you do the weather, do you read the news?<br>\nGirl you got my head spinning around in circles<br>\nAnd by the way I\u2019m looking at you<br>\nAnd everybody else is too I\u2019m thinking<br>\nGirl you look famous<br>\nLike South Beach or Vegas<br>\nAll up in the paper, in the supermarket aisle<br>\nThat dress on you I swear<br>\nI know you from somewhere<br>\nGotta know what your name is<br>\nCause God you look famous when you smile<br>\nFamous when you smile<br>\nYou got your elbows on the bar<br>\nShinin\u2019 in the blue neon</i></b><b><i></i></b></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThen ask me out, don\u2019t follow me like a lost puppy around the store\u201d\nyou chuckled to which the actor nodded his head. \u201cYeah, sorry for that. That\u2019s\nnot how I approach women\u201d he apologized to which you smiled and accepted it.</p><p>\u201cMy name\u2019s [Y/N]\u201d you introduced yourself while holding out your hand to\nChris. He quickly shook it and tried to not shiver at the delightful tingles\ncoursing through his body the second your hands touched.</p><p>\u201cA beautiful name for a beautiful woman\u201d the actor smoothly said to\nwhich you snorted before laughing out loud, \u201cSo cheesy\u201d you smiled before the two\nof you continued to finish grocery shopping. </p><p>\u00a0</p><p><b><i>Yeah something I

You had been dying to meet your beautiful\nbaby girl and be a cute little family with Chris, but all that came tumbling\ndown when videos and pictures of him cheating on you trended on all social\nmedias</p><!-- more --><p>\u2662At first, you didn\u2019t believe the images you were\nseeing until the video clearly showed your boyfriend\u2019s face. Your heart sunk to\nthe pit of your stomach while a sharp pain in your abdomen caught your\nattention</p><p>\u2662Ten minutes later, your water had broke while you forced\nyourself to not cry over the fact that the love of your life had betrayed and\nhumiliated you in the worst way possible. For the sake of your unborn daughter,\nyou decided to deal with the heartache once she\u2019d be born </p><p>\u2662After calling your parents, siblings and best\nfriends, you were on your way to the hospital while Chris was blowing up your\nphone, begging you to talk to him and making promises that he would better\nhimself for you and his daughter</p><p>\u2662His parents were already waiting for you at the hospital\nwhen you arrived and checked in, they apologized as they had seen the pain clouding\nyour eyes and couldn\u2019t describe the anger, they felt towards their son</p><p>\u2662After you had gotten your IV, you were already five centimeters\ndilated. You felt comfortable and happy that your friends and families were\nthere to support you while Chris made his way to the hospital</p><p>\u2662When he arrived, the room grew silent as everyone was\nglaring at him. \u201cFor you\u201d the actor spoke while approaching your bed with a\nbouquet of flowers. All you did was glare at them before turning your head and\nmumbling, \u201cI don\u2019t want anything from you\u201d</p><p>\u2662The actor let out a defeated sigh as he felt like an\nidiot, but the way he felt was nothing compared to what you were keeping inside\nyou. You had decided to not scream and cuss at him as you didn\u2019t want to\ndistress your baby daughter</p><p>\u2662A few hours passed, and the contractions became\nworse. Your sister and best friend were holding onto your hand while your mother\nfed you crushed ice. You made it clear to Chris that you didn\u2019t want to be\ntouched by him, he was to be seated as far away from you as possible and not\ntalk to you</p><p>\u2662When it was time to give birth, the actor was allowed\nto stand next to you and watch you give birth to your beautiful baby daughter while\nyou clung onto your mother\u2019s hand. When the loud cries of your daughter echoed\nthrough the room, your heart burst with immense love as you stared teary eyed\nat your baby girl</p><p>\u2662Your sister cut the umbilical chord which made Chris\nbite his lip to stop him from protesting as it had always been his dream to do\nso. The second your daughter was born, you had realized that you and Chris\nweren\u2019t meant to be. He was meant to help you create the greatest gift you\ncould ever dream of, and then stick around to help you raise her to become a\nbeautiful mixed woman. Nothing else</p><p>\u2662While your baby girl was going through her first\ncheck-up, you delivered the placenta before the nurses cleaned you up. Your\nfamily and friends had left the room so that you and Chris could have <i>the</i> conversation</p><p>\u2662\u201dBaby\u201d the actor sighed and tried to take your hands\nin his but you hummed and shook your head in disapproval. \u201cDon\u2019t call me that,\nyou lost that privilege the second you decided to cheat on me, Chris\u201d you hissed\nwhile glaring at him</p><p>\u2662\u201d You\u2019re going to come by thrice a week, spent some\ntime with her and when she\u2019s three months old, I\u2019ll let her spend the night\nwith you. Other than child support, you owe me nothing, Chris.

You had been dying to meet your beautiful\nbaby girl and be a cute little family with Chris, but all that came tumbling\ndown when videos and pictures of him cheating on you trended on all social\nmedias</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u2662At first, you didn\u2019t believe the images you were\nseeing until the video clearly showed your boyfriend\u2019s face. Your heart sunk to\nthe pit of your stomach while a sharp pain in your abdomen caught your\nattention</p><p>\u2662Ten minutes later, your water had broke while you forced\nyourself to not cry over the fact that the love of your life had betrayed and\nhumiliated you in the worst way possible. For the sake of your unborn daughter,\nyou decided to deal with the heartache once she\u2019d be born </p><p>\u2662After calling your parents, siblings and best\nfriends, you were on your way to the hospital while Chris was blowing up your\nphone, begging you to talk to him and making promises that he would better\nhimself for you and his daughter</p><p>\u2662His parents were already waiting for you at the hospital\nwhen you arrived and checked in, they apologized as they had seen the pain clouding\nyour eyes and couldn\u2019t describe the anger, they felt towards their son</p><p>\u2662After you had gotten your IV, you were already five centimeters\ndilated. You felt comfortable and happy that your friends and families were\nthere to support you while Chris made his way to the hospital</p><p>\u2662When he arrived, the room grew silent as everyone was\nglaring at him. \u201cFor you\u201d the actor spoke while approaching your bed with a\nbouquet of flowers. All you did was glare at them before turning your head and\nmumbling, \u201cI don\u2019t want anything from you\u201d</p><p>\u2662The actor let out a defeated sigh as he felt like an\nidiot, but the way he felt was nothing compared to what you were keeping inside\nyou. You had decided to not scream and cuss at him as you didn\u2019t want to\ndistress your baby daughter</p><p>\u2662A few hours passed, and the contractions became\nworse. Your sister and best friend were holding onto your hand while your mother\nfed you crushed ice. You made it clear to Chris that you didn\u2019t want to be\ntouched by him, he was to be seated as far away from you as possible and not\ntalk to you</p><p>\u2662When it was time to give birth, the actor was allowed\nto stand next to you and watch you give birth to your beautiful baby daughter while\nyou clung onto your mother\u2019s hand. When the loud cries of your daughter echoed\nthrough the room, your heart burst with immense love as you stared teary eyed\nat your baby girl</p><p>\u2662Your sister cut the umbilical chord which made Chris\nbite his lip to stop him from protesting as it had always been his dream to do\nso. The second your daughter was born, you had realized that you and Chris\nweren\u2019t meant to be. He was meant to help you create the greatest gift you\ncould ever dream of, and then stick around to help you raise her to become a\nbeautiful mixed woman. Nothing else</p><p>\u2662While your baby girl was going through her first\ncheck-up, you delivered the placenta before the nurses cleaned you up. Your\nfamily and friends had left the room so that you and Chris could have <i>the</i> conversation</p><p>\u2662\u201dBaby\u201d the actor sighed and tried to take your hands\nin his but you hummed and shook your head in disapproval. \u201cDon\u2019t call me that,\nyou lost that privilege the second you decided to cheat on me, Chris\u201d you hissed\nwhile glaring at him</p><p>\u2662\u201d You\u2019re going to come by thrice a week, spent some\ntime with her and when she\u2019s three months old, I\u2019ll let her spend the night\nwith you. Other than child support, you owe me nothing, Chris. Absolutely\nnothing\u201d you finished and watched a heartbroken expression fill your now\nex-boyfriend\u2019s face</p><p>\u2662You didn\u2019t care at all and let the tears cascade down\nyour cheeks as you were the one hurting the most. A nurse gently entered your\nroom with your daughter in your hands and handed her over to Chris as he hadn\u2019t\nheld her yet.

Since you had only a scene left to film, the directors told you to step aside, because your scene was due after the one they were about to film between Chris, RDJ, Mark, Jeremy and Rebecca. You sat behind the cameras and were going through your phone, when Rebecca&rsquo;s bitter scoff reached your eardrums. &rsquo;<i>What now?&rsquo;</i>, you thought. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re killing my character?&rdquo;, she turned hysterically towards the Russo Brothers, who didn&rsquo;t seem phased by her outburst. &ldquo;Yes, it was planned from the beginning. It&rsquo;s because -&rdquo;, replied Joe back but was cut off by her &lsquo;highness&rsquo;. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not acceptable. I&rsquo;m the real star of the movie here. My character is the main person of the whole plot, how can you just kill me off like that?!&rdquo; You shook your head at her ridiculous attitude, not really surprised. She furiously walked to her phone and typed frantically. A minute later, Anthony Russo&rsquo;s phone rang. He took his brother&rsquo;s arm and stepped aside. &ldquo;What the hell is wrong with you?&rdquo;, spat Chris (Evans) to Rebecca, annoyed at her lack of professionalism. Her only response towards him was her look full of hatred. </p><!-- more --><p>Five minutes later, the directors came back with clenched jaws, tension radiating of them. Kevin Feige who was immediately informed of the change of plans, stormed to the set and said with a firm voice, &ldquo;Joe, Anthony and Y/N we need to talk!&rdquo; Your eyes widened because you didn&rsquo;t know why the president of the Studios was calling out for you, since you haven&rsquo;t done anything compromising. You joined them, your heart pumping heavily in your thoracic cage and with sweaty palms. &ldquo;You wanted to talk to me?&rdquo;, you said calmly. He didn&rsquo;t even look at you and directly turned to the directors, ignoring your existence. &ldquo;New change of plans : Rebecca&rsquo;s character lives and you will kill off Y/N&rsquo;s !&rdquo; You couldn&rsquo;t help yourself and gasped. You knew the Shield agent you were portraying wasn&rsquo;t a big part of the story and that you wouldn&rsquo;t get much attention for it but to the point off killing them, it sucked. &ldquo;We got the news but with all due respect Kevin, we don&rsquo;t think that would be a good idea regarding the future of the franchise and what we visioned for the next movies.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I understand but I&rsquo;ll guess you will have to come up with another storyline that would fit with what we planned for the future !&rdquo;, responded Feige firmly. The directors nodded not really in position to argue with their boss. &ldquo;You may leave now, except you Y/N&rdquo;, he stated furthermore. You gulp harshly, fear creeping your whole body. &ldquo;It has come to my attention that you have a severe drinking problem. I&rsquo;m sure you know that the Studios can&rsquo;t afford the medias focusing on such juicy topics instead of the movie. For that matter, I&rsquo;m sorry but I&rsquo;m afraid that it would be for the best if you didn&rsquo;t attend the premiere.&rdquo; Your mouth stood agape, the words trying to come out but you physically couldn&rsquo;t. Tears welled up in your eyes and you didn&rsquo;t have the force to hide it from him this time. An apologetic expression crossed his features while you stood before him, head down and your silent tears streaming down your face. He patted your shoulder and exclaimed for the first time since he stormed out in the set and took you apart, in a more quiet voice, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really sorry Y/N but business is business. I hope you understand that and can eventually forgive me.&rdquo; You only nodded (what could you have done otherwise), cleaned your face and walked away. </p><p>When you came back, you saw Mason and walked towards him. His smile vanished once seeing your blank and the remaining traces of the tears on your face. He cupped your cheeks and intensely tried to seek for your eyes. &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;, he whispered slowly. &ldquo;Ehm nothing. I wanted to ask you if it was alright for you that we post-pone our date from tonight? I&rsquo;m not really done shooting actually&rdquo;, you said. He saw your pained gaze and with a heavy heart nodded. &ldquo;Yes of course, no problem. Do you want me to stay?&rdquo; You shook your head 'no&rsquo; and he nodded once more, noticing that it somehow was the wrong moment to push more into it. &ldquo;Thanks&rdquo;, you mumbled and went back to the makeup trailer to get your face back on track. When you were done, you left the trailer and plastered a fake smile on your face, not letting Rebecca get the satisfaction of seeing you devastated. Deep down you knew it was because of her. You marched to the Russo brothers who gave you a knowing look and got in position to film the scene. What the other actors didn&rsquo;t know was that instead of Rebecca&rsquo;s character to die, it was yours. The directors took Mackie and Hemsworth discreetly to the side and explained them what they had to do. The two actors looked at each other confused since it wasn&rsquo;t planned and Joe said, &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re confused but just do as we told you.&rdquo; </p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"295\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"nochillrogers:_X2oP7axlKFjcr6-2h3WZA:ZMeoMj2aWBD1K\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/006e576c6bbb3932fd5e8ed462c09c92/tumblr_pcyauvt02t1uhosuvo1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"295\"/></figure><p>The actors didn&rsquo;t question further and got ready to play the new part assigned by the Russos. In the scene, Hydra members managed to infiltrate Stark&rsquo;s reception and their mission was still the same : kill Rogers. During the crossfire, you faked being hit and collapsed on the ground. Mackie and Hemsworth were beside you the next second. &ldquo;Y/C/N, stay with us ! The ambulance is on it&rsquo;s way&rdquo;, stated Wilson while trying to keep pressure on your wound. You cough out fake blood, your eyes tearing. It wasn&rsquo;t just Y/C/N death but somehow symbolically, yours too. &ldquo;Stay with us Y/C/N. I&rsquo;m begging you. Don&rsquo;t leave us&rdquo;, exclaimed Thor with a shaky voice. Your hands weakly reached both their cheeks before dropping down lifeless. You turned your face to the side, your last breath leaving your soul along a final tear. They bowed their heads down and the rest of the Avengers gathered around your lifeless body. &ldquo;CUT !&rdquo;, yelled Joe. They analyzed the scene before applauding. &ldquo;It was remarkable guys. Y/N it was breathtaking, thank you for that performance.&rdquo; The director&rsquo;s assistant gave you a blanket to clean out the fake blood. You felt the cast&rsquo;s piercing gaze shooting hols behind your back, confused at this change of the situation and you tried to shrug it off, not able to face their gazes. </p><p>You felt a hand press to your shoulder, thinking it was Scarlet or RDJ, you turned around with a fake smile but it quickly vanished when you saw that it was Elizabeth. &ldquo;Are you ok?&rdquo;, she asked. &ldquo;What do you care?!&rdquo;, was the only thing you told her, in such a calm voice that it made goosebumps crawl up her whole body. You finished cleaning up because the directors figured that the scenes had to be filmed multiple times. Three hours later, they declared that the shooting was done for the week and that they would see some of them for re-shoots. &ldquo;For the others, thank you so much for your performances. It was a pleasure to work with you&rdquo;, they stated while furtively giving you an apologetic look. You weakly clapped your hands along the crew, drained out from the whole tearing up and filming. You were gathering your stuff when Hemsworth asked you if you wanted to join them for a drink. &ldquo;Thank you for the invitation, but I&rsquo;m really tired. I think I&rsquo;m just gonna fall asleep the second I hit the bed&rdquo;, you chuckled. &ldquo;Are you sure? It&rsquo;s tradition that after the end of shooting everyone gathers around for a final night before everyone goes back to their respective lives and projects.&rdquo; You nodded, &ldquo;I know but I&rsquo;m really sorry to have to pass on it. We&rsquo;ll see each other some other day, ok?&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t push further once seeing your tired eyes. &ldquo;Alright no problem. See you at the movie premiere&rdquo;, he replied with a wide smile when leaving to join the others. At the mention of the premiere, you heart stopped beating and you just nodded. &ldquo;Sure&rdquo;, you lied. </p><p>It was past 10 pm. The only thing you wanted was to beat the shit out of your frustration. You covered yourself in a large hoodie, a cap hiding your face and walked out to the nearest Cornerstore. You knew that you shouldn&rsquo;t but couldn&rsquo;t stop it. &ldquo;One last time&rdquo;, you tried to excuse yourself. You grabbed the bottle of vodka, paid and marched back to the production&rsquo;s gym. First of all, you looked around if you were alone, not wanting to be disturbed by anyone and then turned on the lights. You took of the hoodies along shoes and began taking long sips from the bottle, the familiar sensation burning your throat. Then, without wrapping your hands, you started hitting on the punching bag with all your force. The small breaks you took wasn&rsquo;t to get your breath back but to drink more and more. At this far, your knuckles were bleeding but you didn&rsquo;t felt it, the alcohol being your antidote. Each time the bag came balancing your way, you hit harder and harder, letting all your anger go away. &ldquo;Hey hey hey stop it !!&rdquo;, a loud voice echoed around the gym but you didn&rsquo;t. You kept punching, even if your hand was feeling numb you kept pushing. Strong and firm hands pushed you back violently, making you fall to the ground. You laid back on the ground, the lights burning your vision and started laughing hysterically. &ldquo;Y/N, what the fuck are you doing?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;The bottle&rdquo;, you mumbled. &ldquo;NO !&rdquo; You sat up and were looking for the bottle but before you could reach it, he had already taking it away. &ldquo;Give me the bottle !&rdquo;, you said with a raspy voice. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; &ldquo;Mason, I swear to god, give me my fucking bottle&rdquo;, you said through greeted teeth. &ldquo;And I said no !&rdquo;, he replied with a low but dangerous intonation. You crawled to him, with a piercing gaze, not in control of your acts anymore. &ldquo;Why are you like this with me? What do you want from me? Fuck me? Someone to pity?&rdquo;, you spat. His eyes widened but you didn&rsquo;t gave him a chance to reply, when you crashed your lips against his. He was starting to let go and kiss you back when he suddenly pushed you off him. &ldquo;Y/N stop&rdquo;, he whispered with a shaky voice. It was like a wake-up call and you distanced yourself from him, heat creeping up your body. You realized that you just kissed him without his consent and felt ashamed. You hid your face in your hands and began sobbing loudly, ashamed of your act. He wrapped his arms around you in comfort. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry&rdquo;, you breathed out between your sobs. His hold tightened and he dropped a small kiss on your skull. &ldquo;Y/N, look at me&rdquo;, he said. You shook you face, too embarrassed to face him. He lifted your chin, &ldquo;Look at me.&rdquo; You eventually did as he said. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not rejecting you. Our first kiss shouldn&rsquo;t be like this. It should be full of passion after spending a marvelous night, where we would diner together and get to know each other even more. Where you will have full control of your acts. I really really like you Y/N and what just happened is not gonna change my feelings for you but you need to trust me. What happened for you to be in this state?&rdquo; You let out a shaky breath out before telling him everything. He listened carefully and tried to remain calm because he knew it wasn&rsquo;t the moment to burst out. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Y/N. You don&rsquo;t deserve this and I promise when the day comes, the responsible will pay for their acts.&rdquo; His gaze fell on your hands and he sighed. &ldquo;Come on let&rsquo;s get that cleaned up&rdquo;, he whispered and dropped once again a chaste kiss on your forehead before helping you getting up. </p><p>What neither of your knew was that <i>the walls had eyes</i>. </p><p>After 10 minutes of walking, Mason opened the door and let you in, carefully placing you on the couch. &ldquo;Where are we? This is not my trailer.&rdquo; He chuckled at the small portion of lucidity left in you. &ldquo;No, it my trailer. I figured that it would be a bad idea to cross the whole set. Someone could have crossed path with us and I don&rsquo;t want them to see my girl in this state&rdquo;, he rambled. &ldquo;Your girl, hein?&rdquo;, you whispered with a grin plastered on your face and your eyes closed. You liked the sound of it. &ldquo;Here stay with me. I&rsquo;m gonna grab the first aid kit and clean this mess, ok?&rdquo; You hummed in contentment. Before you had the chance to comprehend, your eyes widened and you reached the nearest sink to empty your stomach. Mason heard the commotion and came running to your position, lifting your hair out of the way. You tried to push him out, not wanting him to face the aftermaths of your drinking, but he wasn&rsquo;t having it. You rinsed your mouth with water and let out a heavy breath out. Mason let go of your hair and fumbled through his furniture. He came back 5 minutes after with a toothbrush and paste. He applied some of it and ordered you to open up. &ldquo;I can do it myself&rdquo;, you told him. &ldquo;No you can&rsquo;t&rdquo;, he said while clenching his jaw and pointing to your bloody knuckles. You let him clean your teeth, silent tears of embarrassment sliding down your face. When he was done he cleaned the tears away, his own eyes glossy to see you like that. He took you in his arms, his strong arms tighten around your form. For the first time in a long time, you felt save. After that he disinfected your knuckles before kissing them softly. &ldquo;What did I do to deserve such a wonderful person in my life?&rdquo;, you asked him while caressing his cheek. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you had to witness this&rdquo;, you whispered. &ldquo;We will get pass this, I promise. I&rsquo;ll have your back, always.&rdquo; You nodded and thanked him from the bottom of your heart. You fell asleep on his bed, his tall and build figure wrapped around your plumb and voluptuous one.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"585\" data-orig-height=\"109\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img

You sat behind the cameras and were going through your phone, when Rebecca\u2019s bitter scoff reached your eardrums. \u2019<i>What now?\u2019</i>, you thought. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re killing my character?\u201d, she turned hysterically towards the Russo Brothers, who didn\u2019t seem phased by her outburst. \u201cYes, it was planned from the beginning.

Her only response towards him was her look full of hatred. </p>[[MORE]]<p>Five minutes later, the directors came back with clenched jaws, tension radiating of them. Kevin Feige who was immediately informed of the change of plans, stormed to the set and said with a firm voice, \u201cJoe, Anthony and Y/N we need to talk!\u201d Your eyes widened because you didn\u2019t know why the president of the Studios was calling out for you, since you haven\u2019t done anything compromising. You joined them, your heart pumping heavily in your thoracic cage and with sweaty palms. \u201cYou wanted to talk to me?\u201d, you said calmly. He didn\u2019t even look at you and directly turned to the directors, ignoring your existence. \u201cNew change of plans : Rebecca\u2019s character lives and you will kill off Y/N\u2019s !\u201d You couldn\u2019t help yourself and gasped. You knew the Shield agent you were portraying wasn\u2019t a big part of the story and that you wouldn\u2019t get much attention for it but to the point off killing them, it sucked. \u201cWe got the news but with all due respect Kevin, we don\u2019t think that would be a good idea regarding the future of the franchise and what we visioned for the next movies.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI understand but I\u2019ll guess you will have to come up with another storyline that would fit with what we planned for the future !\u201d, responded Feige firmly. The directors nodded not really in position to argue with their boss. \u201cYou may leave now, except you Y/N\u201d, he stated furthermore. You gulp harshly, fear creeping your whole body. \u201cIt has come to my attention that you have a severe drinking problem. I\u2019m sure you know that the Studios can\u2019t afford the medias focusing on such juicy topics instead of the movie. For that matter, I\u2019m sorry but I\u2019m afraid that it would be for the best if you didn\u2019t attend the premiere.\u201d Your mouth stood agape, the words trying to come out but you physically couldn\u2019t. Tears welled up in your eyes and you didn\u2019t have the force to hide it from him this time. An apologetic expression crossed his features while you stood before him, head down and your silent tears streaming down your face. He patted your shoulder and exclaimed for the first time since he stormed out in the set and took you apart, in a more quiet voice, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry Y/N but business is business. I hope you understand that and can eventually forgive me.\u201d You only nodded (what could you have done otherwise), cleaned your face and walked away. </p><p>When you came back, you saw Mason and walked towards him. His smile vanished once seeing your blank and the remaining traces of the tears on your face. He cupped your cheeks and intensely tried to seek for your eyes. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d, he whispered slowly. \u201cEhm nothing. I wanted to ask you if it was alright for you that we post-pone our date from tonight? I\u2019m not really done shooting actually\u201d, you said. He saw your pained gaze and with a heavy heart nodded. \u201cYes of course, no problem. Do you want me to stay?\u201d You shook your head 'no\u2019 and he nodded once more, noticing that it somehow was the wrong moment to push more into it. \u201cThanks\u201d, you mumbled and went back to the makeup trailer to get your face back on track. When you were done, you left the trailer and plastered a fake smile on your face, not letting Rebecca get the satisfaction of seeing you devastated. Deep down you knew it was because of her. You marched to the Russo brothers who gave you a knowing look and got in position to film the scene. What the other actors didn\u2019t know was that instead of Rebecca\u2019s character to die, it was yours. The directors took Mackie and Hemsworth discreetly to the side and explained them what they had to do. The two actors looked at each other confused since it wasn\u2019t planned and Joe said, \u201cI know you\u2019re confused but just do as we told you.\u201d </p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"295\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"nochillrogers:_X2oP7axlKFjcr6-2h3WZA:ZMeoMj2aWBD1K\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/006e576c6bbb3932fd5e8ed462c09c92/tumblr_pcyauvt02t1uhosuvo1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"295\"></figure><p>The actors didn\u2019t question further and got ready to play the new part assigned by the Russos. In the scene, Hydra members managed to infiltrate Stark\u2019s reception and their mission was still the same : kill Rogers. During the crossfire, you faked being hit and collapsed on the ground. Mackie and Hemsworth were beside you the next second. \u201cY/C/N, stay with us ! The ambulance is on it\u2019s way\u201d, stated Wilson while trying to keep pressure on your wound. You cough out fake blood, your eyes tearing. It wasn\u2019t just Y/C/N death but somehow symbolically, yours too. \u201cStay with us Y/C/N. I\u2019m begging you. Don\u2019t leave us\u201d, exclaimed Thor with a shaky voice. Your hands weakly reached both their cheeks before dropping down lifeless. You turned your face to the side, your last breath leaving your soul along a final tear. They bowed their heads down and the rest of the Avengers gathered around your lifeless body. \u201cCUT !\u201d, yelled Joe. They analyzed the scene before applauding. \u201cIt was remarkable guys. Y/N it was breathtaking, thank you for that performance.\u201d The director\u2019s assistant gave you a blanket to clean out the fake blood. You felt the cast\u2019s piercing gaze shooting hols behind your back, confused at this change of the situation and you tried to shrug it off, not able to face their gazes. </p><p>You felt a hand press to your shoulder, thinking it was Scarlet or RDJ, you turned around with a fake smile but it quickly vanished when you saw that it was Elizabeth. \u201cAre you ok?\u201d, she asked. \u201cWhat do you care?!\u201d, was the only thing you told her, in such a calm voice that it made goosebumps crawl up her whole body. You finished cleaning up because the directors figured that the scenes had to be filmed multiple times. Three hours later, they declared that the shooting was done for the week and that they would see some of them for re-shoots. \u201cFor the others, thank you so much for your performances. It was a pleasure to work with you\u201d, they stated while furtively giving you an apologetic look. You weakly clapped your hands along the crew, drained out from the whole tearing up and filming. You were gathering your stuff when Hemsworth asked you if you wanted to join them for a drink. \u201cThank you for the invitation, but I\u2019m really tired. I think I\u2019m just gonna fall asleep the second I hit the bed\u201d, you chuckled. \u201cAre you sure? It\u2019s tradition that after the end of shooting everyone gathers around for a final night before everyone goes back to their respective lives and projects.\u201d You nodded, \u201cI know but I\u2019m really sorry to have to pass on it. We\u2019ll see each other some other day, ok?\u201d He didn\u2019t push further once seeing your tired eyes. \u201cAlright no problem. See you at the movie premiere\u201d, he replied with a wide smile when leaving to join the others. At the mention of the premiere, you heart stopped beating and you just nodded. \u201cSure\u201d, you lied. </p><p>It was past 10 pm. The only thing you wanted was to beat the shit out of your frustration. You covered yourself in a large hoodie, a cap hiding your face and walked out to the nearest Cornerstore. You knew that you shouldn\u2019t but couldn\u2019t stop it. \u201cOne last time\u201d, you tried to excuse yourself. You grabbed the bottle of vodka, paid and marched back to the production\u2019s gym. First of all, you looked around if you were alone, not wanting to be disturbed by anyone and then turned on the lights. You took of the hoodies along shoes and began taking long sips from the bottle, the familiar sensation burning your throat. Then, without wrapping your hands, you started hitting on the punching bag with all your force. The small breaks you took wasn\u2019t to get your breath back but to drink more and more. At this far, your knuckles were bleeding but you didn\u2019t felt it, the alcohol being your antidote. Each time the bag came balancing your way, you hit harder and harder, letting all your anger go away. \u201cHey hey hey stop it !!\u201d, a loud voice echoed around the gym but you didn\u2019t. You kept punching, even if your hand was feeling numb you kept pushing. Strong and firm hands pushed you back violently, making you fall to the ground. You laid back on the ground, the lights burning your vision and started laughing hysterically. \u201cY/N, what the fuck are you doing?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThe bottle\u201d, you mumbled. \u201cNO !\u201d You sat up and were looking for the bottle but before you could reach it, he had already taking it away. \u201cGive me the bottle !\u201d, you said with a raspy voice. \u201cNo!\u201d \u201cMason, I swear to god, give me my fucking bottle\u201d, you said through greeted teeth. \u201cAnd I said no !\u201d, he replied with a low but dangerous intonation. You crawled to him, with a piercing gaze, not in control of your acts anymore. \u201cWhy are you like this with me? What do you want from me? Fuck me? Someone to pity?\u201d, you spat. His eyes widened but you didn\u2019t gave him a chance to reply, when you crashed your lips against his. He was starting to let go and kiss you back when he suddenly pushed you off him. \u201cY/N stop\u201d, he whispered with a shaky voice. It was like a wake-up call and you distanced yourself from him, heat creeping up your body. You realized that you just kissed him without his consent and felt ashamed. You hid your face in your hands and began sobbing loudly, ashamed of your act. He wrapped his arms around you in comfort. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry\u201d, you breathed out between your sobs. His hold tightened and he dropped a small kiss on your skull. \u201cY/N, look at me\u201d, he said. You shook you face, too embarrassed to face him. He lifted your chin, \u201cLook at me.\u201d You eventually did as he said. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not rejecting you. Our first kiss shouldn\u2019t be like this. It should be full of passion after spending a marvelous night, where we would diner together and get to know each other even more. Where you will have full control of your acts. I really really like you Y/N and what just happened is not gonna change my feelings for you but you need to trust me. What happened for you to be in this state?\u201d You let out a shaky breath out before telling him everything. He listened carefully and tried to remain calm because he knew it wasn\u2019t the moment to burst out. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Y/N. You don\u2019t deserve this and I promise when the day comes, the responsible will pay for their acts.\u201d His gaze fell on your hands and he sighed. \u201cCome on let\u2019s get that cleaned up\u201d, he whispered and dropped once again a chaste kiss on your forehead before helping you getting up. </p><p>What neither of your knew was that <i>the walls had eyes</i>. </p><p>After 10 minutes of walking, Mason opened the door and let you in, carefully placing you on the couch. \u201cWhere are we? This is not my trailer.\u201d He chuckled at the small portion of lucidity left in you. \u201cNo, it my trailer. I figured that it would be a bad idea to cross the whole set. Someone could have crossed path with us and I don\u2019t want them to see my girl in this state\u201d, he rambled. \u201cYour girl, hein?\u201d, you whispered with a grin plastered on your face and your eyes closed. You liked the sound of it. \u201cHere stay with me. I\u2019m gonna grab the first aid kit and clean this mess, ok?\u201d You hummed in contentment. Before you had the chance to comprehend, your eyes widened and you reached the nearest sink to empty your stomach. Mason heard the commotion and came running to your position, lifting your hair out of the way. You tried to push him out, not wanting him to face the aftermaths of your drinking, but he wasn\u2019t having it. You rinsed your mouth with water and let out a heavy breath out. Mason let go of your hair and fumbled through his furniture. He came back 5 minutes after with a toothbrush and paste. He applied some of it and ordered you to open up. \u201cI can do it myself\u201d, you told him. \u201cNo you can\u2019t\u201d, he said while clenching his jaw and pointing to your bloody knuckles. You let him clean your teeth, silent tears of embarrassment sliding down your face. When he was done he cleaned the tears away, his own eyes glossy to see you like that. He took you in his arms, his strong arms tighten around your form. For the first time in a long time, you felt save. After that he disinfected your knuckles before kissing them softly. \u201cWhat did I do to deserve such a wonderful person in my life?\u201d, you asked him while caressing his cheek. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you had to witness this\u201d, you whispered. \u201cWe will get pass this, I promise. I\u2019ll have your back, always.\u201d You nodded and thanked him from the bottom of your heart. You fell asleep on his bed, his tall and build figure wrapped around your plumb and voluptuous one.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"585\" data-orig-height=\"109\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img

Since you had only a scene left to film, the directors told you to step aside, because your scene was due after the one they were about to film between Chris, RDJ, Mark, Jeremy and Rebecca. You sat behind the cameras and were going through your phone, when Rebecca\u2019s bitter scoff reached your eardrums. \u2019<i>What now?\u2019</i>, you thought. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re killing my character?\u201d, she turned hysterically towards the Russo Brothers, who didn\u2019t seem phased by her outburst. \u201cYes, it was planned from the beginning. It\u2019s because -\u201d, replied Joe back but was cut off by her \u2018highness\u2019. \u201cThat\u2019s not acceptable. I\u2019m the real star of the movie here. My character is the main person of the whole plot, how can you just kill me off like that?!\u201d You shook your head at her ridiculous attitude, not really surprised. She furiously walked to her phone and typed frantically. A minute later, Anthony Russo\u2019s phone rang. He took his brother\u2019s arm and stepped aside. \u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you?\u201d, spat Chris (Evans) to Rebecca, annoyed at her lack of professionalism. Her only response towards him was her look full of hatred. </p>[[MORE]]<p>Five minutes later, the directors came back with clenched jaws, tension radiating of them. Kevin Feige who was immediately informed of the change of plans, stormed to the set and said with a firm voice, \u201cJoe, Anthony and Y/N we need to talk!\u201d Your eyes widened because you didn\u2019t know why the president of the Studios was calling out for you, since you haven\u2019t done anything compromising. You joined them, your heart pumping heavily in your thoracic cage and with sweaty palms. \u201cYou wanted to talk to me?\u201d, you said calmly. He didn\u2019t even look at you and directly turned to the directors, ignoring your existence. \u201cNew change of plans : Rebecca\u2019s character lives and you will kill off Y/N\u2019s !\u201d You couldn\u2019t help yourself and gasped. You knew the Shield agent you were portraying wasn\u2019t a big part of the story and that you wouldn\u2019t get much attention for it but to the point off killing them, it sucked. \u201cWe got the news but with all due respect Kevin, we don\u2019t think that would be a good idea regarding the future of the franchise and what we visioned for the next movies.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI understand but I\u2019ll guess you will have to come up with another storyline that would fit with what we planned for the future !\u201d, responded Feige firmly. The directors nodded not really in position to argue with their boss. \u201cYou may leave now, except you Y/N\u201d, he stated furthermore. You gulp harshly, fear creeping your whole body. \u201cIt has come to my attention that you have a severe drinking problem. I\u2019m sure you know that the Studios can\u2019t afford the medias focusing on such juicy topics instead of the movie. For that matter, I\u2019m sorry but I\u2019m afraid that it would be for the best if you didn\u2019t attend the premiere.\u201d Your mouth stood agape, the words trying to come out but you physically couldn\u2019t. Tears welled up in your eyes and you didn\u2019t have the force to hide it from him this time. An apologetic expression crossed his features while you stood before him, head down and your silent tears streaming down your face. He patted your shoulder and exclaimed for the first time since he stormed out in the set and took you apart, in a more quiet voice, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry Y/N but business is business. I hope you understand that and can eventually forgive me.\u201d You only nodded (what could you have done otherwise), cleaned your face and walked away. </p><p>When you came back, you saw Mason and walked towards him. His smile vanished once seeing your blank and the remaining traces of the tears on your face. He cupped your cheeks and intensely tried to seek for your eyes. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d, he whispered slowly. \u201cEhm nothing. I wanted to ask you if it was alright for you that we post-pone our date from tonight? I\u2019m not really done shooting actually\u201d, you said. He saw your pained gaze and with a heavy heart nodded. \u201cYes of course, no problem. Do you want me to stay?\u201d You shook your head 'no\u2019 and he nodded once more, noticing that it somehow was the wrong moment to push more into it. \u201cThanks\u201d, you mumbled and went back to the makeup trailer to get your face back on track. When you were done, you left the trailer and plastered a fake smile on your face, not letting Rebecca get the satisfaction of seeing you devastated. Deep down you knew it was because of her. You marched to the Russo brothers who gave you a knowing look and got in position to film the scene. What the other actors didn\u2019t know was that instead of Rebecca\u2019s character to die, it was yours. The directors took Mackie and Hemsworth discreetly to the side and explained them what they had to do. The two actors looked at each other confused since it wasn\u2019t planned and Joe said, \u201cI know you\u2019re confused but just do as we told you.\u201d </p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"295\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"nochillrogers:_X2oP7axlKFjcr6-2h3WZA:ZMeoMj2aWBD1K\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/006e576c6bbb3932fd5e8ed462c09c92/tumblr_pcyauvt02t1uhosuvo1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"295\"></figure><p>The actors didn\u2019t question further and got ready to play the new part assigned by the Russos. In the scene, Hydra members managed to infiltrate Stark\u2019s reception and their mission was still the same : kill Rogers. During the crossfire, you faked being hit and collapsed on the ground. Mackie and Hemsworth were beside you the next second. \u201cY/C/N, stay with us ! The ambulance is on it\u2019s way\u201d, stated Wilson while trying to keep pressure on your wound. You cough out fake blood, your eyes tearing. It wasn\u2019t just Y/C/N death but somehow symbolically, yours too. \u201cStay with us Y/C/N. I\u2019m begging you. Don\u2019t leave us\u201d, exclaimed Thor with a shaky voice. Your hands weakly reached both their cheeks before dropping down lifeless. You turned your face to the side, your last breath leaving your soul along a final tear. They bowed their heads down and the rest of the Avengers gathered around your lifeless body. \u201cCUT !\u201d, yelled Joe. They analyzed the scene before applauding. \u201cIt was remarkable guys. Y/N it was breathtaking, thank you for that performance.\u201d The director\u2019s assistant gave you a blanket to clean out the fake blood. You felt the cast\u2019s piercing gaze shooting hols behind your back, confused at this change of the situation and you tried to shrug it off, not able to face their gazes. </p><p>You felt a hand press to your shoulder, thinking it was Scarlet or RDJ, you turned around with a fake smile but it quickly vanished when you saw that it was Elizabeth. \u201cAre you ok?\u201d, she asked. \u201cWhat do you care?!\u201d, was the only thing you told her, in such a calm voice that it made goosebumps crawl up her whole body. You finished cleaning up because the directors figured that the scenes had to be filmed multiple times. Three hours later, they declared that the shooting was done for the week and that they would see some of them for re-shoots. \u201cFor the others, thank you so much for your performances. It was a pleasure to work with you\u201d, they stated while furtively giving you an apologetic look. You weakly clapped your hands along the crew, drained out from the whole tearing up and filming. You were gathering your stuff when Hemsworth asked you if you wanted to join them for a drink. \u201cThank you for the invitation, but I\u2019m really tired. I think I\u2019m just gonna fall asleep the second I hit the bed\u201d, you chuckled. \u201cAre you sure? It\u2019s tradition that after the end of shooting everyone gathers around for a final night before everyone goes back to their respective lives and projects.\u201d You nodded, \u201cI know but I\u2019m really sorry to have to pass on it. We\u2019ll see each other some other day, ok?\u201d He didn\u2019t push further once seeing your tired eyes. \u201cAlright no problem. See you at the movie premiere\u201d, he replied with a wide smile when leaving to join the others. At the mention of the premiere, you heart stopped beating and you just nodded. \u201cSure\u201d, you lied. </p><p>It was past 10 pm. The only thing you wanted was to beat the shit out of your frustration. You covered yourself in a large hoodie, a cap hiding your face and walked out to the nearest Cornerstore. You knew that you shouldn\u2019t but couldn\u2019t stop it. \u201cOne last time\u201d, you tried to excuse yourself. You grabbed the bottle of vodka, paid and marched back to the production\u2019s gym. First of all, you looked around if you were alone, not wanting to be disturbed by anyone and then turned on the lights. You took of the hoodies along shoes and began taking long sips from the bottle, the familiar sensation burning your throat. Then, without wrapping your hands, you started hitting on the punching bag with all your force. The small breaks you took wasn\u2019t to get your breath back but to drink more and more. At this far, your knuckles were bleeding but you didn\u2019t felt it, the alcohol being your antidote. Each time the bag came balancing your way, you hit harder and harder, letting all your anger go away. \u201cHey hey hey stop it !!\u201d, a loud voice echoed around the gym but you didn\u2019t. You kept punching, even if your hand was feeling numb you kept pushing. Strong and firm hands pushed you back violently, making you fall to the ground. You laid back on the ground, the lights burning your vision and started laughing hysterically. \u201cY/N, what the fuck are you doing?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThe bottle\u201d, you mumbled. \u201cNO !\u201d You sat up and were looking for the bottle but before you could reach it, he had already taking it away. \u201cGive me the bottle !\u201d, you said with a raspy voice. \u201cNo!\u201d \u201cMason, I swear to god, give me my fucking bottle\u201d, you said through greeted teeth. \u201cAnd I said no !\u201d, he replied with a low but dangerous intonation. You crawled to him, with a piercing gaze, not in control of your acts anymore. \u201cWhy are you like this with me? What do you want from me? Fuck me? Someone to pity?\u201d, you spat. His eyes widened but you didn\u2019t gave him a chance to reply, when you crashed your lips against his. He was starting to let go and kiss you back when he suddenly pushed you off him. \u201cY/N stop\u201d, he whispered with a shaky voice. It was like a wake-up call and you distanced yourself from him, heat creeping up your body. You realized that you just kissed him without his consent and felt ashamed. You hid your face in your hands and began sobbing loudly, ashamed of your act. He wrapped his arms around you in comfort. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry\u201d, you breathed out between your sobs. His hold tightened and he dropped a small kiss on your skull. \u201cY/N, look at me\u201d, he said. You shook you face, too embarrassed to face him. He lifted your chin, \u201cLook at me.\u201d You eventually did as he said. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not rejecting you. Our first kiss shouldn\u2019t be like this. It should be full of passion after spending a marvelous night, where we would diner together and get to know each other even more. Where you will have full control of your acts. I really really like you Y/N and what just happened is not gonna change my feelings for you but you need to trust me. What happened for you to be in this state?\u201d You let out a shaky breath out before telling him everything. He listened carefully and tried to remain calm because he knew it wasn\u2019t the moment to burst out. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Y/N. You don\u2019t deserve this and I promise when the day comes, the responsible will pay for their acts.\u201d His gaze fell on your hands and he sighed. \u201cCome on let\u2019s get that cleaned up\u201d, he whispered and dropped once again a chaste kiss on your forehead before helping you getting up. </p><p>What neither of your knew was that <i>the walls had eyes</i>. </p><p>After 10 minutes of walking, Mason opened the door and let you in, carefully placing you on the couch. \u201cWhere are we? This is not my trailer.\u201d He chuckled at the small portion of lucidity left in you. \u201cNo, it my trailer. I figured that it would be a bad idea to cross the whole set. Someone could have crossed path with us and I don\u2019t want them to see my girl in this state\u201d, he rambled. \u201cYour girl, hein?\u201d, you whispered with a grin plastered on your face and your eyes closed. You liked the sound of it. \u201cHere stay with me. I\u2019m gonna grab the first aid kit and clean this mess, ok?\u201d You hummed in contentment. Before you had the chance to comprehend, your eyes widened and you reached the nearest sink to empty your stomach. Mason heard the commotion and came running to your position, lifting your hair out of the way. You tried to push him out, not wanting him to face the aftermaths of your drinking, but he wasn\u2019t having it. You rinsed your mouth with water and let out a heavy breath out. Mason let go of your hair and fumbled through his furniture. He came back 5 minutes after with a toothbrush and paste. He applied some of it and ordered you to open up. \u201cI can do it myself\u201d, you told him. \u201cNo you can\u2019t\u201d, he said while clenching his jaw and pointing to your bloody knuckles. You let him clean your teeth, silent tears of embarrassment sliding down your face. When he was done he cleaned the tears away, his own eyes glossy to see you like that. He took you in his arms, his strong arms tighten around your form. For the first time in a long time, you felt save. After that he disinfected your knuckles before kissing them softly. \u201cWhat did I do to deserve such a wonderful person in my life?\u201d, you asked him while caressing his cheek. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you had to witness this\u201d, you whispered. \u201cWe will get pass this, I promise. I\u2019ll have your back, always.\u201d You nodded and thanked him from the bottom of your heart. You fell asleep on his bed, his tall and build figure wrapped around your plumb and voluptuous one.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"585\" data-orig-height=\"109\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img

                "content": "<p><b>Pairing </b>: Chris Evans x Plus Size Reader ; Marvel Cast x Plus Size Reader</p><p><b>Warnings</b> : Language ; mention of drinking problem ; mention of vomit&nbsp;</p><p><b>Word Count</b> : 2.4k</p><p><b>A/N</b> : Hiii :) Sorry it took so long to post the next chapter, but I&rsquo;m really busy with school. Change of plans : This chapter was supposed to be the Finale but changed my mind. The next chapter (9) will be the Finale. Hope you like it :)&nbsp;</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>Everyone got back into their respective positions. Since you had only a scene left to film, the directors told you to step aside, because your scene was due after the one they were about to film between Chris, RDJ, Mark, Jeremy and Rebecca. You sat behind the cameras and were going through your phone, when Rebecca&rsquo;s bitter scoff reached your eardrums. &rsquo;<i>What now?&rsquo;</i>, you thought. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re killing my character?&rdquo;, she turned hysterically towards the Russo Brothers, who didn&rsquo;t seem phased by her outburst. &ldquo;Yes, it was planned from the beginning. It&rsquo;s because -&rdquo;, replied Joe back but was cut off by her &lsquo;highness&rsquo;. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not acceptable. I&rsquo;m the real star of the movie here. My character is the main person of the whole plot, how can you just kill me off like that?!&rdquo; You shook your head at her ridiculous attitude, not really surprised. She furiously walked to her phone and typed frantically. A minute later, Anthony Russo&rsquo;s phone rang. He took his brother&rsquo;s arm and stepped aside. &ldquo;What the hell is wrong with you?&rdquo;, spat Chris (Evans) to Rebecca, annoyed at her lack of professionalism. Her only response towards him was her look full of hatred. </p><p>Five minutes later, the directors came back with clenched jaws, tension radiating of them. Kevin Feige who was immediately informed of the change of plans, stormed to the set and said with a firm voice, &ldquo;Joe, Anthony and Y/N we need to talk!&rdquo; Your eyes widened because you didn&rsquo;t know why the president of the Studios was calling out for you, since you haven&rsquo;t done anything compromising. You joined them, your heart pumping heavily in your thoracic cage and with sweaty palms. &ldquo;You wanted to talk to me?&rdquo;, you said calmly. He didn&rsquo;t even look at you and directly turned to the directors, ignoring your existence. &ldquo;New change of plans : Rebecca&rsquo;s character lives and you will kill off Y/N&rsquo;s !&rdquo; You couldn&rsquo;t help yourself and gasped. You knew the Shield agent you were portraying wasn&rsquo;t a big part of the story and that you wouldn&rsquo;t get much attention for it but to the point off killing them, it sucked. &ldquo;We got the news but with all due respect Kevin, we don&rsquo;t think that would be a good idea regarding the future of the franchise and what we visioned for the next movies.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I understand but I&rsquo;ll guess you will have to come up with another storyline that would fit with what we planned for the future !&rdquo;, responded Feige firmly. The directors nodded not really in position to argue with their boss. &ldquo;You may leave now, except you Y/N&rdquo;, he stated furthermore. You gulp harshly, fear creeping your whole body. &ldquo;It has come to my attention that you have a severe drinking problem. I&rsquo;m sure you know that the Studios can&rsquo;t afford the medias focusing on such juicy topics instead of the movie. For that matter, I&rsquo;m sorry but I&rsquo;m afraid that it would be for the best if you didn&rsquo;t attend the premiere.&rdquo; Your mouth stood agape, the words trying to come out but you physically couldn&rsquo;t. Tears welled up in your eyes and you didn&rsquo;t have the force to hide it from him this time. An apologetic expression crossed his features while you stood before him, head down and your silent tears streaming down your face. He patted your shoulder and exclaimed for the first time since he stormed out in the set and took you apart, in a more quiet voice, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really sorry Y/N but business is business. I hope you understand that and can eventually forgive me.&rdquo; You only nodded (what could you have done otherwise), cleaned your face and walked away. </p><p>When you came back, you saw Mason and walked towards him. His smile vanished once seeing your blank and the remaining traces of the tears on your face. He cupped your cheeks and intensely tried to seek for your eyes. &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;, he whispered slowly. &ldquo;Ehm nothing. I wanted to ask you if it was alright for you that we post-pone our date from tonight? I&rsquo;m not really done shooting actually&rdquo;, you said. He saw your pained gaze and with a heavy heart nodded. &ldquo;Yes of course, no problem. Do you want me to stay?&rdquo; You shook your head 'no&rsquo; and he nodded once more, noticing that it somehow was the wrong moment to push more into it. &ldquo;Thanks&rdquo;, you mumbled and went back to the makeup trailer to get your face back on track. When you were done, you left the trailer and plastered a fake smile on your face, not letting Rebecca get the satisfaction of seeing you devastated. Deep down you knew it was because of her. You marched to the Russo brothers who gave you a knowing look and got in position to film the scene. What the other actors didn&rsquo;t know was that instead of Rebecca&rsquo;s character to die, it was yours. The directors took Mackie and Hemsworth discreetly to the side and explained them what they had to do. The two actors looked at each other confused since it wasn&rsquo;t planned and Joe said, &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re confused but just do as we told you.&rdquo; </p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"1\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>The actors didn&rsquo;t question further and got ready to play the new part assigned by the Russos. In the scene, Hydra members managed to infiltrate Stark&rsquo;s reception and their mission was still the same : kill Rogers. During the crossfire, you faked being hit and collapsed on the ground. Mackie and Hemsworth were beside you the next second. &ldquo;Y/C/N, stay with us ! The ambulance is on it&rsquo;s way&rdquo;, stated Wilson while trying to keep pressure on your wound. You cough out fake blood, your eyes tearing. It wasn&rsquo;t just Y/C/N death but somehow symbolically, yours too. &ldquo;Stay with us Y/C/N. I&rsquo;m begging you. Don&rsquo;t leave us&rdquo;, exclaimed Thor with a shaky voice. Your hands weakly reached both their cheeks before dropping down lifeless. You turned your face to the side, your last breath leaving your soul along a final tear. They bowed their heads down and the rest of the Avengers gathered around your lifeless body. &ldquo;CUT !&rdquo;, yelled Joe. They analyzed the scene before applauding. &ldquo;It was remarkable guys. Y/N it was breathtaking, thank you for that performance.&rdquo; The director&rsquo;s assistant gave you a blanket to clean out the fake blood. You felt the cast&rsquo;s piercing gaze shooting hols behind your back, confused at this change of the situation and you tried to shrug it off, not able to face their gazes. </p><p>You felt a hand press to your shoulder, thinking it was Scarlet or RDJ, you turned around with a fake smile but it quickly vanished when you saw that it was Elizabeth. &ldquo;Are you ok?&rdquo;, she asked. &ldquo;What do you care?!&rdquo;, was the only thing you told her, in such a calm voice that it made goosebumps crawl up her whole body. You finished cleaning up because the directors figured that the scenes had to be filmed multiple times. Three hours later, they declared that the shooting was done for the week and that they would see some of them for re-shoots. &ldquo;For the others, thank you so much for your performances. It was a pleasure to work with you&rdquo;, they stated while furtively giving you an apologetic look. You weakly clapped your hands along the crew, drained out from the whole tearing up and filming. You were gathering your stuff when Hemsworth asked you if you wanted to join them for a drink. &ldquo;Thank you for the invitation, but I&rsquo;m really tired. I think I&rsquo;m just gonna fall asleep the second I hit the bed&rdquo;, you chuckled. &ldquo;Are you sure? It&rsquo;s tradition that after the end of shooting everyone gathers around for a final night before everyone goes back to their respective lives and projects.&rdquo; You nodded, &ldquo;I know but I&rsquo;m really sorry to have to pass on it. We&rsquo;ll see each other some other day, ok?&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t push further once seeing your tired eyes. &ldquo;Alright no problem. See you at the movie premiere&rdquo;, he replied with a wide smile when leaving to join the others. At the mention of the premiere, you heart stopped beating and you just nodded. &ldquo;Sure&rdquo;, you lied. </p><p>It was past 10 pm. The only thing you wanted was to beat the shit out of your frustration. You covered yourself in a large hoodie, a cap hiding your face and walked out to the nearest Cornerstore. You knew that you shouldn&rsquo;t but couldn&rsquo;t stop it. &ldquo;One last time&rdquo;, you tried to excuse yourself. You grabbed the bottle of vodka, paid and marched back to the production&rsquo;s gym. First of all, you looked around if you were alone, not wanting to be disturbed by anyone and then turned on the lights. You took of the hoodies along shoes and began taking long sips from the bottle, the familiar sensation burning your throat. Then, without wrapping your hands, you started hitting on the punching bag with all your force. The small breaks you took wasn&rsquo;t to get your breath back but to drink more and more. At this far, your knuckles were bleeding but you didn&rsquo;t felt it, the alcohol being your antidote. Each time the bag came balancing your way, you hit harder and harder, letting all your anger go away. &ldquo;Hey hey hey stop it !!&rdquo;, a loud voice echoed around the gym but you didn&rsquo;t. You kept punching, even if your hand was feeling numb you kept pushing. Strong and firm hands pushed you back violently, making you fall to the ground. You laid back on the ground, the lights burning your vision and started laughing hysterically. &ldquo;Y/N, what the fuck are you doing?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;The bottle&rdquo;, you mumbled. &ldquo;NO !&rdquo; You sat up and were looking for the bottle but before you could reach it, he had already taking it away. &ldquo;Give me the bottle !&rdquo;, you said with a raspy voice. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; &ldquo;Mason, I swear to god, give me my fucking bottle&rdquo;, you said through greeted teeth. &ldquo;And I said no !&rdquo;, he replied with a low but dangerous intonation. You crawled to him, with a piercing gaze, not in control of your acts anymore. &ldquo;Why are you like this with me? What do you want from me? Fuck me? Someone to pity?&rdquo;, you spat. His eyes widened but you didn&rsquo;t gave him a chance to reply, when you crashed your lips against his. He was starting to let go and kiss you back when he suddenly pushed you off him. &ldquo;Y/N stop&rdquo;, he whispered with a shaky voice. It was like a wake-up call and you distanced yourself from him, heat creeping up your body. You realized that you just kissed him without his consent and felt ashamed. You hid your face in your hands and began sobbing loudly, ashamed of your act. He wrapped his arms around you in comfort. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry&rdquo;, you breathed out between your sobs. His hold tightened and he dropped a small kiss on your skull. &ldquo;Y/N, look at me&rdquo;, he said. You shook you face, too embarrassed to face him. He lifted your chin, &ldquo;Look at me.&rdquo; You eventually did as he said. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not rejecting you. Our first kiss shouldn&rsquo;t be like this. It should be full of passion after spending a marvelous night, where we would diner together and get to know each other even more. Where you will have full control of your acts. I really really like you Y/N and what just happened is not gonna change my feelings for you but you need to trust me. What happened for you to be in this state?&rdquo; You let out a shaky breath out before telling him everything. He listened carefully and tried to remain calm because he knew it wasn&rsquo;t the moment to burst out. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Y/N. You don&rsquo;t deserve this and I promise when the day comes, the responsible will pay for their acts.&rdquo; His gaze fell on your hands and he sighed. &ldquo;Come on let&rsquo;s get that cleaned up&rdquo;, he whispered and dropped once again a chaste kiss on your forehead before helping you getting up. </p><p>What neither of your knew was that <i>the walls had eyes</i>. </p><p>After 10 minutes of walking, Mason opened the door and let you in, carefully placing you on the couch. &ldquo;Where are we? This is not my trailer.&rdquo; He chuckled at the small portion of lucidity left in you. &ldquo;No, it my trailer. I figured that it would be a bad idea to cross the whole set. Someone could have crossed path with us and I don&rsquo;t want them to see my girl in this state&rdquo;, he rambled. &ldquo;Your girl, hein?&rdquo;, you whispered with a grin plastered on your face and your eyes closed. You liked the sound of it. &ldquo;Here stay with me. I&rsquo;m gonna grab the first aid kit and clean this mess, ok?&rdquo; You hummed in contentment. Before you had the chance to comprehend, your eyes widened and you reached the nearest sink to empty your stomach. Mason heard the commotion and came running to your position, lifting your hair out of the way. You tried to push him out, not wanting him to face the aftermaths of your drinking, but he wasn&rsquo;t having it. You rinsed your mouth with water and let out a heavy breath out. Mason let go of your hair and fumbled through his furniture. He came back 5 minutes after with a toothbrush and paste. He applied some of it and ordered you to open up. &ldquo;I can do it myself&rdquo;, you told him. &ldquo;No you can&rsquo;t&rdquo;, he said while clenching his jaw and pointing to your bloody knuckles. You let him clean your teeth, silent tears of embarrassment sliding down your face. When he was done he cleaned the tears away, his own eyes glossy to see you like that. He took you in his arms, his strong arms tighten around your form. For the first time in a long time, you felt save. After that he disinfected your knuckles before kissing them softly. &ldquo;What did I do to deserve such a wonderful person in my life?&rdquo;, you asked him while caressing his cheek. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you had to witness this&rdquo;, you whispered. &ldquo;We will get pass this, I promise. I&rsquo;ll have your back, always.&rdquo; You nodded and thanked him from the bottom of your heart. You fell asleep on his bed, his tall and build figure wrapped around your plumb and voluptuous one.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img

Since you had only a scene left to film, the directors told you to step aside, because your scene was due after the one they were about to film between Chris, RDJ, Mark, Jeremy and Rebecca. You sat behind the cameras and were going through your phone, when Rebecca&rsquo;s bitter scoff reached your eardrums. &rsquo;<i>What now?&rsquo;</i>, you thought. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re killing my character?&rdquo;, she turned hysterically towards the Russo Brothers, who didn&rsquo;t seem phased by her outburst. &ldquo;Yes, it was planned from the beginning. It&rsquo;s because -&rdquo;, replied Joe back but was cut off by her &lsquo;highness&rsquo;. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not acceptable. I&rsquo;m the real star of the movie here. My character is the main person of the whole plot, how can you just kill me off like that?!&rdquo; You shook your head at her ridiculous attitude, not really surprised. She furiously walked to her phone and typed frantically. A minute later, Anthony Russo&rsquo;s phone rang. He took his brother&rsquo;s arm and stepped aside. &ldquo;What the hell is wrong with you?&rdquo;, spat Chris (Evans) to Rebecca, annoyed at her lack of professionalism. Her only response towards him was her look full of hatred. </p>\n</p>",
