He had brought peace back to the Seven Kingdoms and thus been crowned King of them all. They had not spoken much of Daenerys in the days since the war had come to an end, since she&rsquo;d retreated out of Winterfell and back to Dragonstone. There, she would remain with her \u00a0child, her one remaining dragon, never again to be called Queen of anything. Mother of dragons she would always be, but after all she had fought for&hellip; She would never been Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. </p><p>In some ways, Sansa felt for Daenerys&hellip; For were they both not women trapped in a world ruled by men? Had they both not been used and abused by men for their own gain? Had their circumstances been different, they might have been friends. But the one time Dragon Queen had spurned all those in the North, even Jon faced her wrath the night Bran told them the truth. That very night Daenerys had sailed away, back to her army which she had left at Dragonstone. And then&hellip; The war erupted with such a new ferocity that Sansa hadn&rsquo;t been certain it would not end until they were all dead. But thanks to Jaimie Lannister, who had turned against his sister and lover, they had won a decisive battle against Cersei. When they had taken back King&rsquo;s Landing and solidified their army with new troops, it was then that Daenerys had come for them. </p><p>But then something strange had happened&hellip; Her dragon Rhaegal had never bonded with a rider until he met Tyrion, the little imp that Sansa herself once called husband. A kind man with a fondness for drinking, it had been surprising to say the least when Rhaegal had allowed him to climb onto his great scaled back. With a dragon on their side, Jon&rsquo;s army had marched on until Daenerys and her men were pushed back away from King&rsquo;s Landing. </p><p>And that was when Viserion had appeared in the skies above King&rsquo;s Landing, his once creamy gold body turned to ice. Sansa could remember that day, could recall the fear she had felt looking up at the great dragons circling the sky above them. And then Jon had locked her away into dungeon, where she could be kept safe and away from the battle that raged outside the palace. For hours, no perhaps for even days she was trapped down there, surrounded by palace staff, only able to wait for news from the outside. Any moment could have been her very last&hellip;</p><p>But then Jon had appeared, haggard and broken, but alive. He had collapsed into her arms and had only enough strength to tell her the words she&rsquo;d always longed to hear&hellip; We&rsquo;ve won. And that day alone had been weeks before. Things had quickly begun to change after that moment, but such changes were welcome after the years and years of war and suffering. For the first time in many years there was hope in the world again.</p><p>&ldquo;Sansa?&rdquo;</p><p>The voice pulled her back from her thoughts and she turned, facing Jon with a smile. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to catch a chill standing out here without a cloak,&rdquo; he admonished with a chuckle, reaching out to drape her fur lined cloak across her shoulders. Sansa tugged it closer around her, turning back to face out, her blue eyes drinking in the sight of the golden sunlight as it slowly melted the snow. &ldquo;What are you thinking about?&rdquo; Jon&rsquo;s voice coaxed her to turn back to him, blue eyes meeting brown, and it was his turn to offer her a grin. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been out here a while, is all.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just thinking back to all that has happened.&rdquo; She admitted as she turned away from him yet again, reaching out a gloved hand to touch the snow still yet settled on the railing in front of her. &ldquo;Spring is coming.&rdquo; She commented then, shifting her weight from one foot to the other, recalling how just a few weeks ago she had been standing in the same spot, plotting her revenge against the man that had caused her so much grief. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t certain we would see it again.&rdquo; Jon stepped up, their shoulders brushing as he came to stand beside her, dark hair catching the morning sunlight. They had returned to Winterfell a few nights ago, arriving without the pomp of royalty which Jon continued to shy away from. King of the Seven Kingdoms or not, he was still just Jon to all that knew him. Jon had spoken to the men of the North, reminding them of the pledges he&rsquo;d given to them and the ones they had given to him. He spoke with all the greatness of a King until he told them he would not be their King at all&hellip; But rather, they would be ruled by a Queen who still yet held the name Stark. There must always be a Stark at Winterfell, he had spoken those words to the Lords that night, a grin on his face when he&rsquo;d turned to look at her. And then he crowned her a queen in her own right, breaking the North from his own Kingdom and giving her what he believed had been hers all along. She was, after all, the heir to the North. </p><p>&ldquo;Nor was I,&rdquo; Jon admitted as he stared out across the courtyard, already bustling with the start of a busy day in Winterfell. Below them, Arya stood with Brienne, both deep in conversation, the small slip of a girl grinning as she listened to whatever it was that Brienne had to say. As she had long ago promised, Brienne had never once strayed from her side, following her from here to there, the first to bow to her as queen. &ldquo;I was afraid we&rsquo;d never again have a moment like this.&rdquo; Sansa turned to him then, blue eyes peering into his brown, a small smile twitching on her rosy lips. Reaching out before she could stop herself, she placed her hand over top his, giving it a gentle squeeze. &ldquo;And yet&hellip; Here we are.&rdquo; He had found himself longing for moments such as these with her; he enjoyed her company far beyond that of a cousin. During his meetings with advisers, with any Lord, he enjoyed seeing her there at his side. Hearing her speak with the wisdom of any man reminded him of all she had seen and all that she knew. Though some might have once regarded Sansa Stark as nothing more than an empty-headed girl, she was smart beyond her years. She was cunning and strategic, full of ideas that constantly surprised him. Even Jon himself had not given her enough credit and it had almost cost him everything. Now he regarded her in a different light, in a different way, and it was easy to see that so did everyone else. </p><p>&ldquo;And yet you must return to King&rsquo;s Landing,&rdquo; she pouted, her clear blue eyes reflecting the depth of her unhappiness. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve only just found peace but you must leave us.&rdquo; She could not help but to feel unhappy knowing that Jon would have to leave. King&rsquo;s Landing was always home to the King of the Iron Throne, no matter the King. Suddenly, she was plunged into something deeper than the longing to be with a brother or a cousin. The sadness that clung to her was like the snow that still yet clung to the tree tops. Turning away from Jon, she hoped to hide her face from his eyes, not wanting him to see just how badly it affected her. She had only just managed to pull the pieces of her broken family back together&hellip; And now it would be broken yet again. </p><p> It was Jon&rsquo;s turn to reach out- his gloved hand lightly cupped her cheek, drawing her back to face him, his brown eyes gleaming in the sunlight. Like Sansa, he too felt the cold drift of sorrow at the thought of leaving both her and Winterfell. If he could have it his way, he might never have left his home again. But, whether he liked it or not, he had a duty to his Kingdom. &ldquo;Come with me.&rdquo; The words left his lips before he could stop them, surprising the both of them. Emboldened by his slip, Jon chuckled, trailing his fingertips along the outline of her jaw. &ldquo;Come with me, Sansa.&rdquo; His tone changed, turning to one she&rsquo;d never before heard and suddenly it was like they were like a flame, the heat of the moment laying siege to their hearts. With her cheeks as red as her hair, her mouth opened and the words that stammered from her lips brought a grin to his face. &ldquo;Yes, there must always be a Stark in Winterfell,&rdquo; he echoed back the words she&rsquo;d spoken, moving his hand up to brush a stray lock of that beautiful red hair from her forehead. &ldquo;And a Stark there shall be. Bran and Arya shall be here of course, and you shall not be gone long. We will call it a peace mission among the new ruling houses of Westeros.&rdquo; His words brought a laugh from her lips and Jon found the sound to be like music. &ldquo;Say you will come with me.&rdquo; He encouraged softly, leaning in, forehead pressed to hers, their lips hovering dangerously close to one another&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Sansa, I need you.&rdquo; </p><p>Her heart was hammering hard within her chest, so very hard that she was certain Jon would hear it himself. She listened carefully to the words that he spoke, recognizing the look in his eyes as one she&rsquo;d seen in her own in the last few weeks. He meant what he said, those words he&rsquo;d spoken were straight from his own heart. And suddenly, suddenly the answer was there on the tip of her tongue, a smile curving on her lips. &ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;ll come.&rdquo; She said, knowing it had been the answer all along. The only answer at all. \u00a0It took only a moment longer for Jon&rsquo;s mouth to close over hers, lightly, almost hesitantly, and Sansa felt her heart turn over. She returned the kiss, arms slipping over his shoulders as his came around her waist, drawing her closer than ever before. </p><p>For how long they remained there together like \u00a0that, tangled limbs and sweet kisses, Sansa did not know&hellip; But she did know that when they finally parted ways, she was left breathless. Jon was pink-cheeked and grinning, reaching up to run a hand through his black curls. And then he offered her his arm, as a courtier to a queen might do, and she could not help but to laugh as she linked hers with his. Together they made their way back inside, to where they might begin to make plans of returning to King&rsquo;s Landing, for it was as she had said.. Spring was coming and with it would come so many new and beautiful things. </p><p>Finally, a future they could look forward to. </p>",

He had brought peace back to the Seven Kingdoms and thus been crowned King of them all. They had not spoken much of Daenerys in the days since the war had come to an end, since she\u2019d retreated out of Winterfell and back to Dragonstone. There, she would remain with her \u00a0child, her one remaining dragon, never again to be called Queen of anything. Mother of dragons she would always be, but after all she had fought for\u2026 She would never been Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. </p><p>In some ways, Sansa felt for Daenerys\u2026 For were they both not women trapped in a world ruled by men? Had they both not been used and abused by men for their own gain? Had their circumstances been different, they might have been friends. But the one time Dragon Queen had spurned all those in the North, even Jon faced her wrath the night Bran told them the truth. That very night Daenerys had sailed away, back to her army which she had left at Dragonstone. And then\u2026 The war erupted with such a new ferocity that Sansa hadn\u2019t been certain it would not end until they were all dead. But thanks to Jaimie Lannister, who had turned against his sister and lover, they had won a decisive battle against Cersei. When they had taken back King\u2019s Landing and solidified their army with new troops, it was then that Daenerys had come for them. </p><p>But then something strange had happened\u2026 Her dragon Rhaegal had never bonded with a rider until he met Tyrion, the little imp that Sansa herself once called husband. A kind man with a fondness for drinking, it had been surprising to say the least when Rhaegal had allowed him to climb onto his great scaled back. With a dragon on their side, Jon\u2019s army had marched on until Daenerys and her men were pushed back away from King\u2019s Landing. </p><p>And that was when Viserion had appeared in the skies above King\u2019s Landing, his once creamy gold body turned to ice. Sansa could remember that day, could recall the fear she had felt looking up at the great dragons circling the sky above them. And then Jon had locked her away into dungeon, where she could be kept safe and away from the battle that raged outside the palace. For hours, no perhaps for even days she was trapped down there, surrounded by palace staff, only able to wait for news from the outside. Any moment could have been her very last\u2026</p><p>But then Jon had appeared, haggard and broken, but alive. He had collapsed into her arms and had only enough strength to tell her the words she\u2019d always longed to hear\u2026 We\u2019ve won. And that day alone had been weeks before. Things had quickly begun to change after that moment, but such changes were welcome after the years and years of war and suffering. For the first time in many years there was hope in the world again.</p><p>\u201cSansa?\u201d</p><p>The voice pulled her back from her thoughts and she turned, facing Jon with a smile. \u201cYou\u2019re going to catch a chill standing out here without a cloak,\u201d he admonished with a chuckle, reaching out to drape her fur lined cloak across her shoulders. Sansa tugged it closer around her, turning back to face out, her blue eyes drinking in the sight of the golden sunlight as it slowly melted the snow. \u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d Jon\u2019s voice coaxed her to turn back to him, blue eyes meeting brown, and it was his turn to offer her a grin. \u201cYou\u2019ve been out here a while, is all.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just thinking back to all that has happened.\u201d She admitted as she turned away from him yet again, reaching out a gloved hand to touch the snow still yet settled on the railing in front of her. \u201cSpring is coming.\u201d She commented then, shifting her weight from one foot to the other, recalling how just a few weeks ago she had been standing in the same spot, plotting her revenge against the man that had caused her so much grief. \u201cI wasn\u2019t certain we would see it again.\u201d Jon stepped up, their shoulders brushing as he came to stand beside her, dark hair catching the morning sunlight. They had returned to Winterfell a few nights ago, arriving without the pomp of royalty which Jon continued to shy away from. King of the Seven Kingdoms or not, he was still just Jon to all that knew him. Jon had spoken to the men of the North, reminding them of the pledges he\u2019d given to them and the ones they had given to him. He spoke with all the greatness of a King until he told them he would not be their King at all\u2026 But rather, they would be ruled by a Queen who still yet held the name Stark. There must always be a Stark at Winterfell, he had spoken those words to the Lords that night, a grin on his face when he\u2019d turned to look at her. And then he crowned her a queen in her own right, breaking the North from his own Kingdom and giving her what he believed had been hers all along. She was, after all, the heir to the North. </p><p>\u201cNor was I,\u201d Jon admitted as he stared out across the courtyard, already bustling with the start of a busy day in Winterfell. Below them, Arya stood with Brienne, both deep in conversation, the small slip of a girl grinning as she listened to whatever it was that Brienne had to say. As she had long ago promised, Brienne had never once strayed from her side, following her from here to there, the first to bow to her as queen. \u201cI was afraid we\u2019d never again have a moment like this.\u201d Sansa turned to him then, blue eyes peering into his brown, a small smile twitching on her rosy lips. Reaching out before she could stop herself, she placed her hand over top his, giving it a gentle squeeze. \u201cAnd yet\u2026 Here we are.\u201d He had found himself longing for moments such as these with her; he enjoyed her company far beyond that of a cousin. During his meetings with advisers, with any Lord, he enjoyed seeing her there at his side. Hearing her speak with the wisdom of any man reminded him of all she had seen and all that she knew. Though some might have once regarded Sansa Stark as nothing more than an empty-headed girl, she was smart beyond her years. She was cunning and strategic, full of ideas that constantly surprised him. Even Jon himself had not given her enough credit and it had almost cost him everything. Now he regarded her in a different light, in a different way, and it was easy to see that so did everyone else. </p><p>\u201cAnd yet you must return to King\u2019s Landing,\u201d she pouted, her clear blue eyes reflecting the depth of her unhappiness. \u201cWe\u2019ve only just found peace but you must leave us.\u201d She could not help but to feel unhappy knowing that Jon would have to leave. King\u2019s Landing was always home to the King of the Iron Throne, no matter the King. Suddenly, she was plunged into something deeper than the longing to be with a brother or a cousin. The sadness that clung to her was like the snow that still yet clung to the tree tops. Turning away from Jon, she hoped to hide her face from his eyes, not wanting him to see just how badly it affected her. She had only just managed to pull the pieces of her broken family back together\u2026 And now it would be broken yet again. </p><p> It was Jon\u2019s turn to reach out- his gloved hand lightly cupped her cheek, drawing her back to face him, his brown eyes gleaming in the sunlight. Like Sansa, he too felt the cold drift of sorrow at the thought of leaving both her and Winterfell. If he could have it his way, he might never have left his home again. But, whether he liked it or not, he had a duty to his Kingdom. \u201cCome with me.\u201d The words left his lips before he could stop them, surprising the both of them. Emboldened by his slip, Jon chuckled, trailing his fingertips along the outline of her jaw. \u201cCome with me, Sansa.\u201d His tone changed, turning to one she\u2019d never before heard and suddenly it was like they were like a flame, the heat of the moment laying siege to their hearts. With her cheeks as red as her hair, her mouth opened and the words that stammered from her lips brought a grin to his face. \u201cYes, there must always be a Stark in Winterfell,\u201d he echoed back the words she\u2019d spoken, moving his hand up to brush a stray lock of that beautiful red hair from her forehead. \u201cAnd a Stark there shall be. Bran and Arya shall be here of course, and you shall not be gone long. We will call it a peace mission among the new ruling houses of Westeros.\u201d His words brought a laugh from her lips and Jon found the sound to be like music. \u201cSay you will come with me.\u201d He encouraged softly, leaning in, forehead pressed to hers, their lips hovering dangerously close to one another\u2019s. \u201cSansa, I need you.\u201d </p><p>Her heart was hammering hard within her chest, so very hard that she was certain Jon would hear it himself. She listened carefully to the words that he spoke, recognizing the look in his eyes as one she\u2019d seen in her own in the last few weeks. He meant what he said, those words he\u2019d spoken were straight from his own heart. And suddenly, suddenly the answer was there on the tip of her tongue, a smile curving on her lips. \u201cOf course I\u2019ll come.\u201d She said, knowing it had been the answer all along. The only answer at all. \u00a0It took only a moment longer for Jon\u2019s mouth to close over hers, lightly, almost hesitantly, and Sansa felt her heart turn over. She returned the kiss, arms slipping over his shoulders as his came around her waist, drawing her closer than ever before. </p><p>For how long they remained there together like \u00a0that, tangled limbs and sweet kisses, Sansa did not know\u2026 But she did know that when they finally parted ways, she was left breathless. Jon was pink-cheeked and grinning, reaching up to run a hand through his black curls. And then he offered her his arm, as a courtier to a queen might do, and she could not help but to laugh as she linked hers with his. Together they made their way back inside, to where they might begin to make plans of returning to King\u2019s Landing, for it was as she had said.. Spring was coming and with it would come so many new and beautiful things. </p><p>Finally, a future they could look forward to. </p>",
