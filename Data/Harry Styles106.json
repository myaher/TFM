Spending time with Harry has always been easy, and you know him well enough and trust him to believe that everything would be just fine.</p><p>Quite frankly, you\u2019d happily let him take you on a date to McDonalds and that\u2019d be enough, but you have a slight inkling there might be a bit more to it than that.</p><p>His head snaps up at the sound of your door opening, and his heart and his belly simultaneously kick up a fluster as you emerge. The weather was warm, so you\u2019d opted for a pair of white jean shorts and a pale pink vest top, with a little cardigan just for good measure. You\u2019d left your hair down, but you had no doubt that if the heat remained you\u2019d be pulling it up within an hour.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d You chirp at him with a big smile. You don\u2019t notice how he completely relaxes at the sound of your voice, but it doesn\u2019t stop the little butterflies that have taken up permanent residence in his chest.</p><p>He pushes himself off the car with a warm smile and opens the door for you. \u201cMorning.\u201d He hums, and as you reach him he leans down to place a sweet kiss to your temple. </p><p>You can\u2019t help but giggle when he holds the door open until you\u2019re settled into the passenger seat. \u201cFeel like a princess.\u201d</p><p>Harry produces a single high pitched hum at your comment, smiling to himself as he starts up the engine and pulls off.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the plan, Stan?\u201d You ask eagerly, angling yourself towards him rather than the road in front of you.</p><p>Harry shakes his head, glancing at you with light eyes but only for a short moment. \u201cUh-uh, it\u2019s a surprise.\u201d</p><p>Your small scowl gives away your disapproval, which Harry has apparently caught glimpse of given he\u2019s giggling about it. \u201cCan I at least get a clue?\u201d</p><p>Harry purses his lips in thought, cocking his head ever so slightly. \u201cAlright&hellip; your dad gave me the idea.\u201d</p><p>Okay, that was the last thing you expected him to say. \u201cYou\u2019re not taking me to the football are you?\u201d The mere thought has you grimacing. \u201cBecause the last thing I want to do is sit at the Albion in misery because they\u2019re losing.\u201d</p><p>Harry laughs loudly and your little grumble, glancing at you again to see you frowning at the gear stick. \u201cNo, he actually told me to never do that.\u201d</p><p><i>How much did he ask Dad?!</i> You don\u2019t mind going to watch the football, but you\u2019d usually pair it with seeing your nan because going just to see your team lose as they always did was not a fun day out. You\u2019re more concerned with the fact that Harry has been in contact with your dad for dating advice rather than your mum. Were you really that obviously a daddy\u2019s girl?</p><p>Harry\u2019s taken your silence as worry and now <i>he\u2019s</i> worried. \u201cHe swore this is what you\u2019d want to do&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God!

Promise.\u201d</p><p>Harry decides to take your word for it and nods slowly, but never says anything more. With his silence you refocus your attention on the road ahead. It takes you a moment to realise that you\u2019re already out of London and have joined the light traffic on the M4. Already a hundred thought are rattling around at the possibilities, but you try not to dwell on it.</p><p>He notices that you sing quietly to the music in the background, occasionally bobbing your head or drumming your thighs in time with the song. He picks up on your little squeaks when you see animals in the fields, and your hums of appreciation when a nice car flies past.</p><p>Every now and then you\u2019ll make a comment about a place you\u2019ve been to when you pass it signposted, and whatever you were doing there. Most of the time it was work related but a few things took him by surprise, like the fact you decided to stop over in Windsor for the night after a flight home from America, just so you could go to Legoland.</p><p>You grin to yourself with excitement when Harry exits the motorway at Chippenham, and once again your head it reeling with possibilities because you know the area well. You\u2019re about to ask if you\u2019re going somewhere specific in your eagerness, but Harry\u2019s frustrated voice stops you before you even open your mouth.</p><p>\u201cBollocks!\u201d He growls, a strange glare in his eye that you\u2019re not particularly fond of.</p><p>\u201cWhat, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s pulling the car off into a lay-by just off the dual carriageway, but his hands are gripping the steering wheel too tightly for it to be anything simple. \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d His answer is blunt, but you\u2019re certain it\u2019s not aimed at you.</p><p><i>That\u2019s good&hellip;</i> You frown a little, peering over to the dashboard to see various lights lit up. Your better judgment tells you to keep quiet and let him do what he needs to, because the last thing you want is an irate Harry on your first date.</p><p>He busies himself checking the car over for a good five or ten minutes, occasionally asking you to check something, but you\u2019ve never been great with cars and you currently feel like more of a burden than anything else. He\u2019s checking things under the bonnet and rechecking the lights to no avail.</p><p>\u201cGonna have to call the AA.\u201d He mumbles to you as he reaches over for his phone in the centre compartment.</p><p>You nod and wait quietly as he does. He runs the operator through his issues, throwing cautious and nervous glances in your direction every few seconds. You acknowledge each one with a smile in the hopes of calming him down at least a bit.</p><p>\u201cFifteen minutes.\u201d He tells you, shoving his phone back. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, love. Not exactly what I had planned, could\u2019ve probably been there by now.\u201d</p><p>You raise your brows slightly in comprehension of your illusive destination. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to apologise, H. It\u2019s just a little hiccup. Everything will be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I just&hellip; It\u2019s not very&hellip; romantic having you sit here in a lay-by while we wait for a breakdown recovery.\u201d He grumbles, and you can tell he\u2019s really put out by the way his brow creases in the middle and his nose is slightly crinkles and nostrils are flared.</p><p>You giggle and smile at him tentatively. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not. But it doesn\u2019t bother me. Really.\u201d</p><p>Harry seems to ease up at your words, but he\u2019s still not completely satisfied. \u201cI\u2019m still sorry. But I am glad it\u2019s you I\u2019m with. Can\u2019t imagine how this would\u2019ve sat with other dates.\u201d</p><p>You snort loudly. \u201cI can only imagine. If it makes you feel any better, I\u2019ve been on worse dates.\u201d</p><p>Harry smirks. \u201cIt does a little&hellip; although there\u2019s still time. Care to elaborate?\u201d</p><p>You purse your lips for a moment. \u201cSure, my second date with Ryan was actually an approval date with his parents.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s eyes widened, his arms reaching up to rest on the frame of the car. \u201cGo on&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey used to hate me. Said my clothes weren\u2019t appropriate and I was too childish. They were super religious so they got weird if I wore a dress above knee length. Went to a family wedding with them once and they brought a spare dress with them for me just in case.\u201d</p><p>Harry laughs loudly, and you\u2019re glad you\u2019re making him feel at least a bit better. \u201cBet you\u2019re glad to see the back of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI certainly don\u2019t miss it.\u201d You admit. \u201cAlthough that doesn\u2019t beat the first date I ever had. That was terrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>Your mouth falls open in offence. \u201cWhy\u2019d you automatically assume it was me?!\u201d</p><p>Harry remains silent with a look that simply says \u2018because it\u2019s you\u2019.</p><p>You scoff and fold your arms across your chest. \u201cI\u2019ll have you know that date would\u2019ve been fine if he hadn\u2019t spent the entire evening mentioning \u2018how fantastic my breasts are\u2019.\u201d You air quote the words and roll your eyes.</p><p>It takes a lot for Harry not to agree, but for the sake of avoiding inappropriate comments he remains filtered. \u201cAre you sure that\u2019s the only reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will happily abandon you here if I have to. I know my way around, y\u2019know.\u201d You warn, arms refolded over you.</p><p>~</p><p>The repair was quick, which you were both grateful for, and soon enough Harry was pulling up to the kiosk at Longleat. You\u2019d squeaked your appreciation the moment you saw the road sign, grinning at him the entire way after that.</p><p>Your dad really did know you well.</p><p>You decide to go around the safari first, stopping to see the giraffes, zebras and lemurs to start. Harry doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s ever seen you so giggly and happy, and he can\u2019t help but think he\u2019s done a good job this far, besides the minor set back earlier. A lemur did steal his hat, which had you howling with laughter right up until the keeper snatched it back.</p><p>When you got back in the car you\u2019d told Harry not to bother going through the monkey bit because they were notorious for stealing aerials off cars. Did he listen? No. You spent the entire time with a monkey sat on the car bonnet trying to pull of the windscreen wipers, and the little bastard eventually got irate and started furiously hitting the car. Harry used every profanity under the sun to insult the animal, but obviously it didn\u2019t stop him. You were too busy trying to stifle your giggles and not to say \u2018I told you so\u2019.</p><p>The car is also recives some physical abuse from an ostrich in passing, and Harry looks like he\u2019s about to burst.</p><p>You\u2019re apparently incapable of learning from past mistakes, since you spend the rest of the safari in dire need of the bathroom. It\u2019s happened before, you make the mistake of drinking too much and not relieving yourself <i>before</i> you get in the car. Now Harry is going around the park as fast as he can before you have the chance to embarrass yourself, but as fast as he can is not really more than 5mph because everyone is too busy looking for the tiger in the trees.</p><p>Harry is also concerned about the dark cloud threatening overhead. He\u2019s not sure he\u2019ll cope if it rains today.</p><p>As soon as Harry pulls up you\u2019re out of the car and running towards the nearest toilets. You don\u2019t even bother to wait for him, which is endearing, at least to him anyway.</p><p>He\u2019s waiting by the exit for you with a soft smile and a basket in his hand.</p><p>\u201cAre we having a picnic?!\u201d You exclaim excitedly, the largest grin on your face.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d He chuckles, offering his free hand out to you.</p><p>You reach out to him, lacing your fingers through his and still beaming up at him. It\u2019s not the first time you\u2019ve held hands, but you still feel a little floaty every time you do.</p><p>He leads you to a grassy patch and sets out a blanket, handing you a cushion to sit on and gesturing for you to sit. He pulls the food he\u2019s prepared out of the basket and arranges it in front of you, and you can feel your heart swelling more and more with each passing second. No one had ever gone through so much effort to make you happy, and it\u2019s more than surreal to you that these gestures are coming from Harry.</p><p>For a while, everything seems to be going well for once. There haven\u2019t been any hiccups and you\u2019re feeling relaxed and happy. So happy in fact that in your bubble of love you fail to notice that the sun has vanished practically from existence and the cloud that Harry had worried about earlier on is about to unleash the heaviest rain imaginable.</p><p>It starts of slowly, a small drop landing on your thigh and making you shiver. You look up and feel another on your face. And then another, and another.</p><p>\u201cThink we need to take this back to the car.\u201d Harry suggests with a grimace, and you think he might be getting irritable again.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine. I\u2019m happy to eat in the car.\u201d You say lightly, gingerly standing on your feet to pack everything away.</p><p>The rain is growing heavier as you hastily toss everything into the basket, and as you begin to make your way to the car it becomes almost terential.</p><p>\u201cJesus fuck!\u201d Harry shouts from behind you, his hand pressed against your damp back urging you towards the car.</p><p>You rather enjoy the rain, even though you\u2019re worried your feet might turn blue because it\u2019s much colder than you\u2019d expected. You hear a rumble of thunder a distance away, and Harry seems to press against you harder to get you moving faster.</p><p>\u201cOne thing!\u201d Harry stresses as you reach the car. \u201cI just wanted one thing to go right today!\u201d</p><p>You frown at the tone of his voice, your heart panging in your chest. \u201cHarry it\u2019s f-,\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t say it\u2019s fine, cause it\u2019s not!\u201d He yells over the loud rain pour, tossing the basket carelessly into the boot. \u201cToday should\u2019ve been perfect for you and it wasn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous!\u201d You shout back, though your tone doesn\u2019t hold anywhere near as much anger as his does. \u201cAnything could\u2019ve happened today and I\u2019d still say I\u2019ve enjoyed myself because I have!\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head, soaked curls flicking rain water in every direction. \u201cThis should\u2019ve been the best date you\u2019ve ever had and it\u2019s been fucking shit, love!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it, Harry!\u201d You beg, reaching your hands out to take his. \u201cI don\u2019t care that you broke down, I don\u2019t care that it\u2019s raining, it doesn\u2019t matter to me! I\u2019ve had a really lovely day with you, it has been the best date!\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s still shaking his head in denial, but he\u2019s holding onto your hands as if his life depends on it. \u201cJust wanted more for you.\u201d</p><p>You roll your eyes and laugh softly. \u201cMaybe next time then!\u201d You suggest with a gentle squeeze to his hands. You hate how defeated he looks, and you have to reach up to secure your arms around his neck. He reciprocates, holding you tightly against his chest, his large hands pressing firmly against your damp vest. The rain is really pouring, both of you completely drenched in filthy rain water, but you don\u2019t care.</p><p>Harry proceeds to place wet kisses along your cold cheek, and you turn your head to meet his lips. Both of you are shivering, relishing in each other\u2019s warmth. You fingers are tangled in the dripping and matted curls at the nape of his neck whilst his arms are wrapped so tightly around you his hands meet your waist.</p><p>You move your kisses to the rest of his face, pecking him all over until you can feel his laughter against you. \u201cI\u2019ve had a perfect day, end of discussion.\u201d</p><p>Harry nods and places another kiss to your lips.</p><p>\u201cMy parent\u2019s is like forty minutes away. I\u2019m sure they won\u2019t mind us stopping in for a shower.\u201d You suggest innocently.</p><p>Harry purses his lips and smirks. \u201cMaybe we can shower together..?\u201d</p><p>~~~</p><p>Jskcnekdbwkdhrj \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d BYE THIS KILLED ME \ud83d\ude2b</p>",

If it makes you feel any better, I\u2019ve been on worse dates.\u201d</p><p>Harry smirks. \u201cIt does a little\u2026 although there\u2019s still time. Care to elaborate?\u201d</p><p>You purse your lips for a moment. \u201cSure, my second date with Ryan was actually an approval date with his parents.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s eyes widened, his arms reaching up to rest on the frame of the car. \u201cGo on\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey used to hate me. Said my clothes weren\u2019t appropriate and I was too childish. They were super religious so they got weird if I wore a dress above knee length. Went to a family wedding with them once and they brought a spare dress with them for me just in case.\u201d</p><p>Harry laughs loudly, and you\u2019re glad you\u2019re making him feel at least a bit better. \u201cBet you\u2019re glad to see the back of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI certainly don\u2019t miss it.\u201d You admit. \u201cAlthough that doesn\u2019t beat the first date I ever had. That was terrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>Your mouth falls open in offence. \u201cWhy\u2019d you automatically assume it was me?!\u201d</p><p>Harry remains silent with a look that simply says \u2018because it\u2019s you\u2019.</p><p>You scoff and fold your arms across your chest. \u201cI\u2019ll have you know that date would\u2019ve been fine if he hadn\u2019t spent the entire evening mentioning \u2018how fantastic my breasts are\u2019.\u201d You air quote the words and roll your eyes.</p><p>It takes a lot for Harry not to agree, but for the sake of avoiding inappropriate comments he remains filtered. \u201cAre you sure that\u2019s the only reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will happily abandon you here if I have to. I know my way around, y\u2019know.\u201d You warn, arms refolded over you.</p><p>~</p><p>The repair was quick, which you were both grateful for, and soon enough Harry was pulling up to the kiosk at Longleat. You\u2019d squeaked your appreciation the moment you saw the road sign, grinning at him the entire way after that.</p><p>Your dad really did know you well.</p><p>You decide to go around the safari first, stopping to see the giraffes, zebras and lemurs to start. Harry doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s ever seen you so giggly and happy, and he can\u2019t help but think he\u2019s done a good job this far, besides the minor set back earlier. A lemur did steal his hat, which had you howling with laughter right up until the keeper snatched it back.</p><p>When you got back in the car you\u2019d told Harry not to bother going through the monkey bit because they were notorious for stealing aerials off cars. Did he listen? No. You spent the entire time with a monkey sat on the car bonnet trying to pull of the windscreen wipers, and the little bastard eventually got irate and started furiously hitting the car. Harry used every profanity under the sun to insult the animal, but obviously it didn\u2019t stop him. You were too busy trying to stifle your giggles and not to say \u2018I told you so\u2019.</p><p>The car is also recives some physical abuse from an ostrich in passing, and Harry looks like he\u2019s about to burst.</p><p>You\u2019re apparently incapable of learning from past mistakes, since you spend the rest of the safari in dire need of the bathroom. It\u2019s happened before, you make the mistake of drinking too much and not relieving yourself <i>before</i> you get in the car. Now Harry is going around the park as fast as he can before you have the chance to embarrass yourself, but as fast as he can is not really more than 5mph because everyone is too busy looking for the tiger in the trees.</p><p>Harry is also concerned about the dark cloud threatening overhead. He\u2019s not sure he\u2019ll cope if it rains today.</p><p>As soon as Harry pulls up you\u2019re out of the car and running towards the nearest toilets. You don\u2019t even bother to wait for him, which is endearing, at least to him anyway.</p><p>He\u2019s waiting by the exit for you with a soft smile and a basket in his hand.</p><p>\u201cAre we having a picnic?!\u201d You exclaim excitedly, the largest grin on your face.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d He chuckles, offering his free hand out to you.</p><p>You reach out to him, lacing your fingers through his and still beaming up at him. It\u2019s not the first time you\u2019ve held hands, but you still feel a little floaty every time you do.</p><p>He leads you to a grassy patch and sets out a blanket, handing you a cushion to sit on and gesturing for you to sit. He pulls the food he\u2019s prepared out of the basket and arranges it in front of you, and you can feel your heart swelling more and more with each passing second. No one had ever gone through so much effort to make you happy, and it\u2019s more than surreal to you that these gestures are coming from Harry.</p><p>For a while, everything seems to be going well for once. There haven\u2019t been any hiccups and you\u2019re feeling relaxed and happy. So happy in fact that in your bubble of love you fail to notice that the sun has vanished practically from existence and the cloud that Harry had worried about earlier on is about to unleash the heaviest rain imaginable.</p><p>It starts of slowly, a small drop landing on your thigh and making you shiver. You look up and feel another on your face. And then another, and another.</p><p>\u201cThink we need to take this back to the car.\u201d Harry suggests with a grimace, and you think he might be getting irritable again.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine. I\u2019m happy to eat in the car.\u201d You say lightly, gingerly standing on your feet to pack everything away.</p><p>The rain is growing heavier as you hastily toss everything into the basket, and as you begin to make your way to the car it becomes almost terential.</p><p>\u201cJesus fuck!\u201d Harry shouts from behind you, his hand pressed against your damp back urging you towards the car.</p><p>You rather enjoy the rain, even though you\u2019re worried your feet might turn blue because it\u2019s much colder than you\u2019d expected. You hear a rumble of thunder a distance away, and Harry seems to press against you harder to get you moving faster.</p><p>\u201cOne thing!\u201d Harry stresses as you reach the car. \u201cI just wanted one thing to go right today!\u201d</p><p>You frown at the tone of his voice, your heart panging in your chest. \u201cHarry it\u2019s f-,\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t say it\u2019s fine, cause it\u2019s not!\u201d He yells over the loud rain pour, tossing the basket carelessly into the boot. \u201cToday should\u2019ve been perfect for you and it wasn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous!\u201d You shout back, though your tone doesn\u2019t hold anywhere near as much anger as his does. \u201cAnything could\u2019ve happened today and I\u2019d still say I\u2019ve enjoyed myself because I have!\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head, soaked curls flicking rain water in every direction. \u201cThis should\u2019ve been the best date you\u2019ve ever had and it\u2019s been fucking shit, love!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it, Harry!\u201d You beg, reaching your hands out to take his. \u201cI don\u2019t care that you broke down, I don\u2019t care that it\u2019s raining, it doesn\u2019t matter to me! I\u2019ve had a really lovely day with you, it has been the best date!\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s still shaking his head in denial, but he\u2019s holding onto your hands as if his life depends on it. \u201cJust wanted more for you.\u201d</p><p>You roll your eyes and laugh softly. \u201cMaybe next time then!\u201d You suggest with a gentle squeeze to his hands. You hate how defeated he looks, and you have to reach up to secure your arms around his neck. He reciprocates, holding you tightly against his chest, his large hands pressing firmly against your damp vest. The rain is really pouring, both of you completely drenched in filthy rain water, but you don\u2019t care.</p><p>Harry proceeds to place wet kisses along your cold cheek, and you turn your head to meet his lips. Both of you are shivering, relishing in each other\u2019s warmth. You fingers are tangled in the dripping and matted curls at the nape of his neck whilst his arms are wrapped so tightly around you his hands meet your waist.</p><p>You move your kisses to the rest of his face, pecking him all over until you can feel his laughter against you. \u201cI\u2019ve had a perfect day, end of discussion.\u201d</p><p>Harry nods and places another kiss to your lips.</p><p>\u201cMy parent\u2019s is like forty minutes away. I\u2019m sure they won\u2019t mind us stopping in for a shower.\u201d You suggest innocently.</p><p>Harry purses his lips and smirks. \u201cMaybe we can shower together..?\u201d</p><p>~~~</p><p>Jskcnekdbwkdhrj \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d BYE THIS KILLED ME \ud83d\ude2b</p>",

I didn\u2019t want to make it too cliche but at the same time I FUCKING LOVE CLICHES SO IDC. This is part 2 to <a href=\"http://waitingfortwilight.tumblr.com/post/182553315149/request-you-and-harry-have-been-friends-for-a\">this request</a>! - Kate xx</i></b></p><p>Harry knows he needs to stop biting his nails when he gets nervous, but today he just can\u2019t help it. As he waits outside your flat, leaning against his car with a concentrated scowl pointed to the ground, he chews on his thumbnail while his feeling chew at him.</p><p>He\u2019s desperate for today to go well. If it doesn\u2019t he thinks he might have to break off all contact with you and avoid you for the rest of his life. After the big deal he made about his love for you, he feels he absolutely has to live up to it, and he feels like this date might have had more planning go into it than one of his own world tours.</p><p>You\u2019re not so concerned, hell you\u2019re not even that nervous. Spending time with Harry has always been easy, and you know him well enough and trust him to believe that everything would be just fine.</p><p>Quite frankly, you\u2019d happily let him take you on a date to McDonalds and that\u2019d be enough, but you have a slight inkling there might be a bit more to it than that.</p><p>His head snaps up at the sound of your door opening, and his heart and his belly simultaneously kick up a fluster as you emerge. The weather was warm, so you\u2019d opted for a pair of white jean shorts and a pale pink vest top, with a little cardigan just for good measure. You\u2019d left your hair down, but you had no doubt that if the heat remained you\u2019d be pulling it up within an hour.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d You chirp at him with a big smile. You don\u2019t notice how he completely relaxes at the sound of your voice, but it doesn\u2019t stop the little butterflies that have taken up permanent residence in his chest.</p><p>He pushes himself off the car with a warm smile and opens the door for you. \u201cMorning.\u201d He hums, and as you reach him he leans down to place a sweet kiss to your temple. </p><p>You can\u2019t help but giggle when he holds the door open until you\u2019re settled into the passenger seat. \u201cFeel like a princess.\u201d</p><p>Harry produces a single high pitched hum at your comment, smiling to himself as he starts up the engine and pulls off.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the plan, Stan?\u201d You ask eagerly, angling yourself towards him rather than the road in front of you.</p><p>Harry shakes his head, glancing at you with light eyes but only for a short moment. \u201cUh-uh, it\u2019s a surprise.\u201d</p><p>Your small scowl gives away your disapproval, which Harry has apparently caught glimpse of given he\u2019s giggling about it. \u201cCan I at least get a clue?\u201d</p><p>Harry purses his lips in thought, cocking his head ever so slightly. \u201cAlright\u2026 your dad gave me the idea.\u201d</p><p>Okay, that was the last thing you expected him to say. \u201cYou\u2019re not taking me to the football are you?\u201d The mere thought has you grimacing. \u201cBecause the last thing I want to do is sit at the Albion in misery because they\u2019re losing.\u201d</p><p>Harry laughs loudly and your little grumble, glancing at you again to see you frowning at the gear stick. \u201cNo, he actually told me to never do that.\u201d</p><p><i>How much did he ask Dad?!</i> You don\u2019t mind going to watch the football, but you\u2019d usually pair it with seeing your nan because going just to see your team lose as they always did was not a fun day out. You\u2019re more concerned with the fact that Harry has been in contact with your dad for dating advice rather than your mum. Were you really that obviously a daddy\u2019s girl?</p><p>Harry\u2019s taken your silence as worry and now <i>he\u2019s</i> worried. \u201cHe swore this is what you\u2019d want to do\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God! I\u2019m not scared or anything!\u201d You insist, but then think that might be a slight lie. \u201cAlright maybe I am a bit\u2026 puzzled but it doesn\u2019t bother me. Promise.\u201d</p><p>Harry decides to take your word for it and nods slowly, but never says anything more. With his silence you refocus your attention on the road ahead. It takes you a moment to realise that you\u2019re already out of London and have joined the light traffic on the M4. Already a hundred thought are rattling around at the possibilities, but you try not to dwell on it.</p><p>He notices that you sing quietly to the music in the background, occasionally bobbing your head or drumming your thighs in time with the song. He picks up on your little squeaks when you see animals in the fields, and your hums of appreciation when a nice car flies past.</p><p>Every now and then you\u2019ll make a comment about a place you\u2019ve been to when you pass it signposted, and whatever you were doing there. Most of the time it was work related but a few things took him by surprise, like the fact you decided to stop over in Windsor for the night after a flight home from America, just so you could go to Legoland.</p><p>You grin to yourself with excitement when Harry exits the motorway at Chippenham, and once again your head it reeling with possibilities because you know the area well. You\u2019re about to ask if you\u2019re going somewhere specific in your eagerness, but Harry\u2019s frustrated voice stops you before you even open your mouth.</p><p>\u201cBollocks!\u201d He growls, a strange glare in his eye that you\u2019re not particularly fond of.</p><p>\u201cWhat, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s pulling the car off into a lay-by just off the dual carriageway, but his hands are gripping the steering wheel too tightly for it to be anything simple. \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d His answer is blunt, but you\u2019re certain it\u2019s not aimed at you.</p><p><i>That\u2019s good\u2026</i> You frown a little, peering over to the dashboard to see various lights lit up. Your better judgment tells you to keep quiet and let him do what he needs to, because the last thing you want is an irate Harry on your first date.</p><p>He busies himself checking the car over for a good five or ten minutes, occasionally asking you to check something, but you\u2019ve never been great with cars and you currently feel like more of a burden than anything else. He\u2019s checking things under the bonnet and rechecking the lights to no avail.</p><p>\u201cGonna have to call the AA.\u201d He mumbles to you as he reaches over for his phone in the centre compartment.</p><p>You nod and wait quietly as he does. He runs the operator through his issues, throwing cautious and nervous glances in your direction every few seconds. You acknowledge each one with a smile in the hopes of calming him down at least a bit.</p><p>\u201cFifteen minutes.\u201d He tells you, shoving his phone back. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, love. Not exactly what I had planned, could\u2019ve probably been there by now.\u201d</p><p>You raise your brows slightly in comprehension of your illusive destination. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to apologise, H. It\u2019s just a little hiccup. Everything will be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I just\u2026 It\u2019s not very\u2026 romantic having you sit here in a lay-by while we wait for a breakdown recovery.\u201d He grumbles, and you can tell he\u2019s really put out by the way his brow creases in the middle and his nose is slightly crinkles and nostrils are flared.</p><p>You giggle and smile at him tentatively. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not. But it doesn\u2019t bother me. Really.\u201d</p><p>Harry seems to ease up at your words, but he\u2019s still not completely satisfied. \u201cI\u2019m still sorry. But I am glad it\u2019s you I\u2019m with. Can\u2019t imagine how this would\u2019ve sat with other dates.\u201d</p><p>You snort loudly. \u201cI can only imagine. If it makes you feel any better, I\u2019ve been on worse dates.\u201d</p><p>Harry smirks. \u201cIt does a little\u2026 although there\u2019s still time. Care to elaborate?\u201d</p><p>You purse your lips for a moment. \u201cSure, my second date with Ryan was actually an approval date with his parents.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s eyes widened, his arms reaching up to rest on the frame of the car. \u201cGo on\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey used to hate me. Said my clothes weren\u2019t appropriate and I was too childish. They were super religious so they got weird if I wore a dress above knee length. Went to a family wedding with them once and they brought a spare dress with them for me just in case.\u201d</p><p>Harry laughs loudly, and you\u2019re glad you\u2019re making him feel at least a bit better. \u201cBet you\u2019re glad to see the back of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI certainly don\u2019t miss it.\u201d You admit. \u201cAlthough that doesn\u2019t beat the first date I ever had. That was terrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>Your mouth falls open in offence. \u201cWhy\u2019d you automatically assume it was me?!\u201d</p><p>Harry remains silent with a look that simply says \u2018because it\u2019s you\u2019.</p><p>You scoff and fold your arms across your chest. \u201cI\u2019ll have you know that date would\u2019ve been fine if he hadn\u2019t spent the entire evening mentioning \u2018how fantastic my breasts are\u2019.\u201d You air quote the words and roll your eyes.</p><p>It takes a lot for Harry not to agree, but for the sake of avoiding inappropriate comments he remains filtered. \u201cAre you sure that\u2019s the only reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will happily abandon you here if I have to. I know my way around, y\u2019know.\u201d You warn, arms refolded over you.</p><p>~</p><p>The repair was quick, which you were both grateful for, and soon enough Harry was pulling up to the kiosk at Longleat. You\u2019d squeaked your appreciation the moment you saw the road sign, grinning at him the entire way after that.</p><p>Your dad really did know you well.</p><p>You decide to go around the safari first, stopping to see the giraffes, zebras and lemurs to start. Harry doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s ever seen you so giggly and happy, and he can\u2019t help but think he\u2019s done a good job this far, besides the minor set back earlier. A lemur did steal his hat, which had you howling with laughter right up until the keeper snatched it back.</p><p>When you got back in the car you\u2019d told Harry not to bother going through the monkey bit because they were notorious for stealing aerials off cars. Did he listen? No. You spent the entire time with a monkey sat on the car bonnet trying to pull of the windscreen wipers, and the little bastard eventually got irate and started furiously hitting the car. Harry used every profanity under the sun to insult the animal, but obviously it didn\u2019t stop him. You were too busy trying to stifle your giggles and not to say \u2018I told you so\u2019.</p><p>The car is also recives some physical abuse from an ostrich in passing, and Harry looks like he\u2019s about to burst.</p><p>You\u2019re apparently incapable of learning from past mistakes, since you spend the rest of the safari in dire need of the bathroom.

You don\u2019t even bother to wait for him, which is endearing, at least to him anyway.</p><p>He\u2019s waiting by the exit for you with a soft smile and a basket in his hand.</p><p>\u201cAre we having a picnic?!\u201d You exclaim excitedly, the largest grin on your face.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d He chuckles, offering his free hand out to you.</p><p>You reach out to him, lacing your fingers through his and still beaming up at him. It\u2019s not the first time you\u2019ve held hands, but you still feel a little floaty every time you do.</p><p>He leads you to a grassy patch and sets out a blanket, handing you a cushion to sit on and gesturing for you to sit. He pulls the food he\u2019s prepared out of the basket and arranges it in front of you, and you can feel your heart swelling more and more with each passing second. No one had ever gone through so much effort to make you happy, and it\u2019s more than surreal to you that these gestures are coming from Harry.</p><p>For a while, everything seems to be going well for once. There haven\u2019t been any hiccups and you\u2019re feeling relaxed and happy. So happy in fact that in your bubble of love you fail to notice that the sun has vanished practically from existence and the cloud that Harry had worried about earlier on is about to unleash the heaviest rain imaginable.</p><p>It starts of slowly, a small drop landing on your thigh and making you shiver. You look up and feel another on your face. And then another, and another.</p><p>\u201cThink we need to take this back to the car.\u201d Harry suggests with a grimace, and you think he might be getting irritable again.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine. I\u2019m happy to eat in the car.\u201d You say lightly, gingerly standing on your feet to pack everything away.</p><p>The rain is growing heavier as you hastily toss everything into the basket, and as you begin to make your way to the car it becomes almost terential.</p><p>\u201cJesus fuck!\u201d Harry shouts from behind you, his hand pressed against your damp back urging you towards the car.</p><p>You rather enjoy the rain, even though you\u2019re worried your feet might turn blue because it\u2019s much colder than you\u2019d expected. You hear a rumble of thunder a distance away, and Harry seems to press against you harder to get you moving faster.</p><p>\u201cOne thing!\u201d Harry stresses as you reach the car. \u201cI just wanted one thing to go right today!\u201d</p><p>You frown at the tone of his voice, your heart panging in your chest. \u201cHarry it\u2019s f-,\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t say it\u2019s fine, cause it\u2019s not!\u201d He yells over the loud rain pour, tossing the basket carelessly into the boot. \u201cToday should\u2019ve been perfect for you and it wasn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous!\u201d You shout back, though your tone doesn\u2019t hold anywhere near as much anger as his does. \u201cAnything could\u2019ve happened today and I\u2019d still say I\u2019ve enjoyed myself because I have!\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head, soaked curls flicking rain water in every direction. \u201cThis should\u2019ve been the best date you\u2019ve ever had and it\u2019s been fucking shit, love!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it, Harry!\u201d You beg, reaching your hands out to take his. \u201cI don\u2019t care that you broke down, I don\u2019t care that it\u2019s raining, it doesn\u2019t matter to me! I\u2019ve had a really lovely day with you, it has been the best date!\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s still shaking his head in denial, but he\u2019s holding onto your hands as if his life depends on it. \u201cJust wanted more for you.\u201d</p><p>You roll your eyes and laugh softly. \u201cMaybe next time then!\u201d You suggest with a gentle squeeze to his hands. You hate how defeated he looks, and you have to reach up to secure your arms around his neck. He reciprocates, holding you tightly against his chest, his large hands pressing firmly against your damp vest. The rain is really pouring, both of you completely drenched in filthy rain water, but you don\u2019t care.</p><p>Harry proceeds to place wet kisses along your cold cheek, and you turn your head to meet his lips. Both of you are shivering, relishing in each other\u2019s warmth. You fingers are tangled in the dripping and matted curls at the nape of his neck whilst his arms are wrapped so tightly around you his hands meet your waist.</p><p>You move your kisses to the rest of his face, pecking him all over until you can feel his laughter against you. \u201cI\u2019ve had a perfect day, end of discussion.\u201d</p><p>Harry nods and places another kiss to your lips.</p><p>\u201cMy parent\u2019s is like forty minutes away. I\u2019m sure they won\u2019t mind us stopping in for a shower.\u201d You suggest innocently.</p><p>Harry purses his lips and smirks. \u201cMaybe we can shower together..?\u201d</p><p>~~~</p><p>Jskcnekdbwkdhrj \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d BYE THIS KILLED ME \ud83d\ude2b</p>",
                "content": "<p><b><i>*Shudders violently and sobs relentlessly* STOP IM SOFT ENOUGH AS IT IS &#128557; I LOVE THIS SO MUCH THANK YOU &#128158; I have to thank <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgPyqI5CkEId8g7xFggm2Hg\">@permanentllyharry</a> for her inspo, she&rsquo;s the bestest. I didn&rsquo;t want to make it too cliche but at the same time I FUCKING LOVE CLICHES SO IDC. This is part 2 to <a href=\"http://waitingfortwilight.tumblr.com/post/182553315149/request-you-and-harry-have-been-friends-for-a\">this request</a>! - Kate xx</i></b></p><p>Harry knows he needs to stop biting his nails when he gets nervous, but today he just can&rsquo;t help it. As he waits outside your flat, leaning against his car with a concentrated scowl pointed to the ground, he chews on his thumbnail while his feeling chew at him.</p><p>He&rsquo;s desperate for today to go well. If it doesn&rsquo;t he thinks he might have to break off all contact with you and avoid you for the rest of his life. After the big deal he made about his love for you, he feels he absolutely has to live up to it, and he feels like this date might have had more planning go into it than one of his own world tours.</p><p>You&rsquo;re not so concerned, hell you&rsquo;re not even that nervous. Spending time with Harry has always been easy, and you know him well enough and trust him to believe that everything would be just fine.</p><p>Quite frankly, you&rsquo;d happily let him take you on a date to McDonalds and that&rsquo;d be enough, but you have a slight inkling there might be a bit more to it than that.</p><p>His head snaps up at the sound of your door opening, and his heart and his belly simultaneously kick up a fluster as you emerge. The weather was warm, so you&rsquo;d opted for a pair of white jean shorts and a pale pink vest top, with a little cardigan just for good measure. You&rsquo;d left your hair down, but you had no doubt that if the heat remained you&rsquo;d be pulling it up within an hour.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi!&rdquo; You chirp at him with a big smile. You don&rsquo;t notice how he completely relaxes at the sound of your voice, but it doesn&rsquo;t stop the little butterflies that have taken up permanent residence in his chest.</p><p>He pushes himself off the car with a warm smile and opens the door for you. &ldquo;Morning.&rdquo; He hums, and as you reach him he leans down to place a sweet kiss to your temple. </p><p>You can&rsquo;t help but giggle when he holds the door open until you&rsquo;re settled into the passenger seat. &ldquo;Feel like a princess.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry produces a single high pitched hum at your comment, smiling to himself as he starts up the engine and pulls off.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the plan, Stan?&rdquo; You ask eagerly, angling yourself towards him rather than the road in front of you.</p><p>Harry shakes his head, glancing at you with light eyes but only for a short moment. &ldquo;Uh-uh, it&rsquo;s a surprise.&rdquo;</p><p>Your small scowl gives away your disapproval, which Harry has apparently caught glimpse of given he&rsquo;s giggling about it. &ldquo;Can I at least get a clue?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry purses his lips in thought, cocking his head ever so slightly. &ldquo;Alright&hellip; your dad gave me the idea.&rdquo;</p><p>Okay, that was the last thing you expected him to say. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not taking me to the football are you?&rdquo; The mere thought has you grimacing. &ldquo;Because the last thing I want to do is sit at the Albion in misery because they&rsquo;re losing.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry laughs loudly and your little grumble, glancing at you again to see you frowning at the gear stick. &ldquo;No, he actually told me to never do that.&rdquo;</p><p><i>How much did he ask Dad?!</i> You don&rsquo;t mind going to watch the football, but you&rsquo;d usually pair it with seeing your nan because going just to see your team lose as they always did was not a fun day out. You&rsquo;re more concerned with the fact that Harry has been in contact with your dad for dating advice rather than your mum. Were you really that obviously a daddy&rsquo;s girl?</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s taken your silence as worry and now <i>he&rsquo;s</i> worried. &ldquo;He swore this is what you&rsquo;d want to do&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh God! I&rsquo;m not scared or anything!&rdquo; You insist, but then think that might be a slight lie. &ldquo;Alright maybe I am a bit&hellip; puzzled but it doesn&rsquo;t bother me. Promise.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry decides to take your word for it and nods slowly, but never says anything more. With his silence you refocus your attention on the road ahead. It takes you a moment to realise that you&rsquo;re already out of London and have joined the light traffic on the M4. Already a hundred thought are rattling around at the possibilities, but you try not to dwell on it.</p><p>He notices that you sing quietly to the music in the background, occasionally bobbing your head or drumming your thighs in time with the song. He picks up on your little squeaks when you see animals in the fields, and your hums of appreciation when a nice car flies past.</p><p>Every now and then you&rsquo;ll make a comment about a place you&rsquo;ve been to when you pass it signposted, and whatever you were doing there. Most of the time it was work related but a few things took him by surprise, like the fact you decided to stop over in Windsor for the night after a flight home from America, just so you could go to Legoland.</p><p>You grin to yourself with excitement when Harry exits the motorway at Chippenham, and once again your head it reeling with possibilities because you know the area well. You&rsquo;re about to ask if you&rsquo;re going somewhere specific in your eagerness, but Harry&rsquo;s frustrated voice stops you before you even open your mouth.</p><p>&ldquo;Bollocks!&rdquo; He growls, a strange glare in his eye that you&rsquo;re not particularly fond of.</p><p>&ldquo;What, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s pulling the car off into a lay-by just off the dual carriageway, but his hands are gripping the steering wheel too tightly for it to be anything simple. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure.&rdquo; His answer is blunt, but you&rsquo;re certain it&rsquo;s not aimed at you.</p><p><i>That&rsquo;s good&hellip;</i> You frown a little, peering over to the dashboard to see various lights lit up. Your better judgment tells you to keep quiet and let him do what he needs to, because the last thing you want is an irate Harry on your first date.</p><p>He busies himself checking the car over for a good five or ten minutes, occasionally asking you to check something, but you&rsquo;ve never been great with cars and you currently feel like more of a burden than anything else. He&rsquo;s checking things under the bonnet and rechecking the lights to no avail.</p><p>&ldquo;Gonna have to call the AA.&rdquo; He mumbles to you as he reaches over for his phone in the centre compartment.</p><p>You nod and wait quietly as he does. He runs the operator through his issues, throwing cautious and nervous glances in your direction every few seconds. You acknowledge each one with a smile in the hopes of calming him down at least a bit.</p><p>&ldquo;Fifteen minutes.&rdquo; He tells you, shoving his phone back. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really sorry, love. Not exactly what I had planned, could&rsquo;ve probably been there by now.&rdquo;</p><p>You raise your brows slightly in comprehension of your illusive destination. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to apologise, H. It&rsquo;s just a little hiccup. Everything will be fine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know, I just&hellip; It&rsquo;s not very&hellip; romantic having you sit here in a lay-by while we wait for a breakdown recovery.&rdquo; He grumbles, and you can tell he&rsquo;s really put out by the way his brow creases in the middle and his nose is slightly crinkles and nostrils are flared.</p><p>You giggle and smile at him tentatively. &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not. But it doesn&rsquo;t bother me. Really.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry seems to ease up at your words, but he&rsquo;s still not completely satisfied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still sorry. But I am glad it&rsquo;s you I&rsquo;m with. Can&rsquo;t imagine how this would&rsquo;ve sat with other dates.&rdquo;</p><p>You snort loudly. &ldquo;I can only imagine. If it makes you feel any better, I&rsquo;ve been on worse dates.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry smirks. &ldquo;It does a little&hellip; although there&rsquo;s still time. Care to elaborate?&rdquo;</p><p>You purse your lips for a moment. &ldquo;Sure, my second date with Ryan was actually an approval date with his parents.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s eyes widened, his arms reaching up to rest on the frame of the car. &ldquo;Go on&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They used to hate me. Said my clothes weren&rsquo;t appropriate and I was too childish. They were super religious so they got weird if I wore a dress above knee length. Went to a family wedding with them once and they brought a spare dress with them for me just in case.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry laughs loudly, and you&rsquo;re glad you&rsquo;re making him feel at least a bit better. &ldquo;Bet you&rsquo;re glad to see the back of that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I certainly don&rsquo;t miss it.&rdquo; You admit. &ldquo;Although that doesn&rsquo;t beat the first date I ever had. That was terrible.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo;</p><p>Your mouth falls open in offence. &ldquo;Why&rsquo;d you automatically assume it was me?!&rdquo;</p><p>Harry remains silent with a look that simply says &lsquo;because it&rsquo;s you&rsquo;.</p><p>You scoff and fold your arms across your chest. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have you know that date would&rsquo;ve been fine if he hadn&rsquo;t spent the entire evening mentioning &lsquo;how fantastic my breasts are&rsquo;.&rdquo; You air quote the words and roll your eyes.</p><p>It takes a lot for Harry not to agree, but for the sake of avoiding inappropriate comments he remains filtered. &ldquo;Are you sure that&rsquo;s the only reason?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will happily abandon you here if I have to. I know my way around, y&rsquo;know.&rdquo; You warn, arms refolded over you.</p><p>~</p><p>The repair was quick, which you were both grateful for, and soon enough Harry was pulling up to the kiosk at Longleat. You&rsquo;d squeaked your appreciation the moment you saw the road sign, grinning at him the entire way after that.</p><p>Your dad really did know you well.</p><p>You decide to go around the safari first, stopping to see the giraffes, zebras and lemurs to start. Harry doesn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s ever seen you so giggly and happy, and he can&rsquo;t help but think he&rsquo;s done a good job this far, besides the minor set back earlier. A lemur did steal his hat, which had you howling with laughter right up until the keeper snatched it back.</p><p>When you got back in the car you&rsquo;d told Harry not to bother going through the monkey bit because they were notorious for stealing aerials off cars. Did he listen? No. You spent the entire time with a monkey sat on the car bonnet trying to pull of the windscreen wipers, and the little bastard eventually got irate and started furiously hitting the car. Harry used every profanity under the sun to insult the animal, but obviously it didn&rsquo;t stop him. You were too busy trying to stifle your giggles and not to say &lsquo;I told you so&rsquo;.</p><p>The car is also recives some physical abuse from an ostrich in passing, and Harry looks like he&rsquo;s about to burst.</p><p>You&rsquo;re apparently incapable of learning from past mistakes, since you spend the rest of the safari in dire need of the bathroom. It&rsquo;s happened before, you make the mistake of drinking too much and not relieving yourself <i>before</i> you get in the car. Now Harry is going around the park as fast as he can before you have the chance to embarrass yourself, but as fast as he can is not really more than 5mph because everyone is too busy looking for the tiger in the trees.</p><p>Harry is also concerned about the dark cloud threatening overhead. He&rsquo;s not sure he&rsquo;ll cope if it rains today.</p><p>As soon as Harry pulls up you&rsquo;re out of the car and running towards the nearest toilets. You don&rsquo;t even bother to wait for him, which is endearing, at least to him anyway.</p><p>He&rsquo;s waiting by the exit for you with a soft smile and a basket in his hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Are we having a picnic?!&rdquo; You exclaim excitedly, the largest grin on your face.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo; He chuckles, offering his free hand out to you.</p><p>You reach out to him, lacing your fingers through his and still beaming up at him. It&rsquo;s not the first time you&rsquo;ve held hands, but you still feel a little floaty every time you do.</p><p>He leads you to a grassy patch and sets out a blanket, handing you a cushion to sit on and gesturing for you to sit. He pulls the food he&rsquo;s prepared out of the basket and arranges it in front of you, and you can feel your heart swelling more and more with each passing second.
