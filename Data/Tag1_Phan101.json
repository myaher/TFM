Dan is a struggling street musician making his fortune in pennies on the south bank of London, another stranger in the city, who deserves so much more than the copper thrown at him by passers-by every day. But London is big, loud and really fucking overwhelming at the best of times, and sometimes, city life doesn&rsquo;t always go to plan. And that&rsquo;s okay.</i></p><p><b><a href=\"http://lionessphil.tumblr.com/post/65916336369/youre-worse-than-nicotine\" target=\"_blank\">You&rsquo;re Worse Than Nicotine</a></b> - lionessphil</p><p>Summary: <i>Innocent!Phil and bad boy/stoner!Dan meet in detention and end up smoking a joint while getting each other off</i>. </p><p><a href=\"http://botanistlester.tumblr.com/post/138483275963/your-loves-a-fucking-drag-but-i-need-it-so-bad\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Your Love&rsquo;s a Fucking Drag (But I Need It So Bad)</b></a> - &nbsp;botanistlester</p><p>Summary: <i>Dan likes black and leather jackets, Phil likes reading in solitude and playing video games.

        "answer": "<p>The short answer is that I don\u2019t think we can fairly judge comments made ten years ago by today\u2019s standards and without context. Since this is a discussion blog, I\u2019ll give you a long answer. First of all, we do need to acknowledge the fact that even if Dan and Phil aren\u2019t and never were dating, we still don\u2019t know their sexualities now or what they considered their sexualities to be at the time. We don\u2019t know if they were joking around, experimenting, or being completely serious, and those things aren\u2019t for us to know. We don\u2019t know about the inside jokes they had with their friends at the time and how those arose. Some of the comments are completely vague and Dan has said in the past that he saw shippers taking a quote he shared, speaking about his ex-girlfriend (people seem to forget or not know that Dan had a girlfriend for a large part of 2009), and passing it around as a phan thing. This really gets to the crux of the problem, which is that those comments weren\u2019t meant for our us. The only reason we see them today, ten years removed, is because people have selected the comments they wanted to save in order to build a narrative, which are but a snapshot, and applied meaning to them, not even necessarily the right meaning. The phandom, particularly when it comes to shipping, seems to think that everything Dan and Phil do or have done is for our consumption and with us in mind, but that\u2019s a fallacy. The majority of the time Dan and Phil are just living their lives and learning and growing and figuring things out like any other person and, if we respect them, we should give them the space to do that without constantly pulling stuff up from the past and judging them for it, in my opinion. </p>",
