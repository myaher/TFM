He hissed as she started taking off the bandages, putting them in a bowl nearby to soak them later. She took another waterskin from the ground nearby, taking a swig of it and then pouring it on his arm.\u00a0</p><p>Sandor hissed as the water made contact with his skin, and he watched as Sansa ripped the bottom part of her dress to make another bandage to wrap his wounds with, and he was surprised to see small thread in his skin as well.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou stitched me up?\u201d he asked her, surprise evident in his voice. Sansa gave a nonchalant shrug as the stitch disappeared under the dark fabric. She tied it tight, and as she finished her hand was grabbed once again by his.\u00a0<br/></p><p>His eyes, dark brown, danced in the light of the fire. And her eyes, dark and shrouded by her hair, stared up into his. Her hair though glistened in the fire light and danced with the soft, cold breeze.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe longer I\u2019m awake the more it seems like you\u2019re the one who saved me, Little Bird.\u201d He chuckled, his thumb rubbing circles in the back of her hand. His other hand found her cheek.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help but lean into his touch, even if his finger tips were freezing.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep trying to save you if I can.\u201d She replied gently. Sansa closed her eyes, just in time for Sandor to send a glare over to one of the other Lord\u2019s that he really couldn\u2019t give two shits about.\u00a0<br/></p><p>How long had it been since he\u2019d seen her like this? This content? This calm?\u00a0</p><p>If they made it home after this, maybe it wouldn\u2019t have been such an awful Yule after all.\u00a0</p>",

She lowered the red furred hood and looked back over to the fire where there was snow melting for fresh water.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou drank some awful wine from one of the Lord\u2019s earlier.\u201d She started,\u00a0\u201chere, let me grab you some water.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he grabbed at her hand,\u00a0\u201cmore wine.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Sansa frowned, but got up and made her way over the fire anyways.\u00a0</p><p>When she came back she produced a waterskin for him, he took it from her hand and downed it, and made an annoyed look at her but drank the rest of the water anyways.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCheeky Bird.\u201d Sandor said after a moment, handing the waterskin back to her. The silence between them was tense for a moment, before he looked down at his bandaged arm.\u00a0\u201cWhat happened exactly?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Sansa looked away, her cheeks tinted pink but not from the bitter cold air that circled through the cave.\u00a0\u201cI-I was stupid, completely stupid and wandered too far from the group as we were trying to find shelter.\u201d She started, and the hand that sat itself on top of hers stalled her.\u00a0</p><p>She met his eyes, a softness there that he gave only her\u2013 she would\u2019ve had to have been blind to not notice.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI slipped and fell, hanging onto the side of the cliff and you saved my life; but pulling me up you tore your sleeves and your arms on the rough cliff side.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re o.k, my little Song Bird.\u201d He told her softly; she heard the chatter from the other lords, but ignored the whispers.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cSandor, I\u2019m so relieved that you\u2019re fine.\u201d Sansa whispered to him, her fingers trailed over his, and she gave his hand a small, tight squeeze.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhat would you have done if I wasn\u2019t?\u201d He asked her after a brief moment of silence, and the wide eyed stare she gave him betrayed her. His chuckle was low, and he started coughing.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cSandor, do you think we\u2019ll make it home?\u201d She asked him, he looked towards the entrance of the cave, how the blizzard hadn\u2019t let up, he then looked around the cave and only saw a few of them from the big group that they had started with.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhere are the rest?\u201d He asked, Sansa sighed once again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAfter you were knocked unconscious we ended up getting separated, I\u2019m not sure where the rest are, or if they\u2019re even still alive.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI bet they would be saying the same thing\u00a0\u2018bout us.\u201d He murmured, he sighed then.\u00a0\u201cI think we should wait through the night and try to make the trek in the morning.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Sansa gestured for him to give her his injured arm, and he agreed. He hissed as she started taking off the bandages, putting them in a bowl nearby to soak them later. She took another waterskin from the ground nearby, taking a swig of it and then pouring it on his arm.\u00a0</p><p>Sandor hissed as the water made contact with his skin, and he watched as Sansa ripped the bottom part of her dress to make another bandage to wrap his wounds with, and he was surprised to see small thread in his skin as well.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou stitched me up?\u201d he asked her, surprise evident in his voice. Sansa gave a nonchalant shrug as the stitch disappeared under the dark fabric. She tied it tight, and as she finished her hand was grabbed once again by his.\u00a0<br></p><p>His eyes, dark brown, danced in the light of the fire. And her eyes, dark and shrouded by her hair, stared up into his. Her hair though glistened in the fire light and danced with the soft, cold breeze.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe longer I\u2019m awake the more it seems like you\u2019re the one who saved me, Little Bird.\u201d He chuckled, his thumb rubbing circles in the back of her hand. His other hand found her cheek.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help but lean into his touch, even if his finger tips were freezing.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep trying to save you if I can.\u201d She replied gently. Sansa closed her eyes, just in time for Sandor to send a glare over to one of the other Lord\u2019s that he really couldn\u2019t give two shits about.\u00a0<br></p><p>How long had it been since he\u2019d seen her like this?

Arya made the case that as the ruling Lady of Winterfell currently, and as hand of the King of the North, she should be in the Yule hunt and celebrate with her people.&nbsp;</p><p>She didn&rsquo;t know what a Hunt entailed, and if she survived this she didn&rsquo;t know if she would participate in another again.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Sansa,&rdquo; Lord Umber, whose name happened to be Ned, called to her. She turned to look at him, and Sandor was starting to sit up.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>To say that she didn&rsquo;t quickly make her way over to them would be an understatement, her dress was heavy but that didn&rsquo;t hinder her from walking or kneeling close to Sandor as he was fully sitting up now.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Lord Umber. Please, feel free to take up my post.&rdquo; She instructed him, the older man gave a slight stiff nod and left them alone.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Sandor blinked, his eyes having trouble adjusting and his face twisted like he tasted something sour.&nbsp;</p><p>He spat at the ground, running his tongue over his teeth as he looked at Sansa,&nbsp;&ldquo;why does my mouth taste like piss.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Sansa gave a little startled laugh, looking down at the ground briefly before composing herself. She lowered the red furred hood and looked back over to the fire where there was snow melting for fresh water.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You drank some awful wine from one of the Lord&rsquo;s earlier.&rdquo; She started,&nbsp;&ldquo;here, let me grab you some water.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he grabbed at her hand,&nbsp;&ldquo;more wine.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Sansa frowned, but got up and made her way over the fire anyways.&nbsp;</p><p>When she came back she produced a waterskin for him, he took it from her hand and downed it, and made an annoyed look at her but drank the rest of the water anyways.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Cheeky Bird.&rdquo; Sandor said after a moment, handing the waterskin back to her.
