He is sleeping, cuddling his duvet like a child with a blanket while his chest rises up and down to the rhythm of the song of the birds outside our bedroom window. Thick eyelashes compliment his face so beautifully, like syrup on pancakes, they enhance the sweetness of what lies underneath. A waterfall of brown, messy curls stream down his forehead and run over closed eyes, which will be just as pretty when he opens them. His skin looks so delicate in the morning light. I can\u2019t believe how lucky I am to get to touch it.</p><p>He\u2019s shirtless, and warm as toast. His chest is smooth and soft, just perfect to run your hands over, I think, as I hug him closer to me. He should wake up any moment now. I hope he does.</p><p>I trace my hands over his collarbone, lightly pressing down on the skin with my fingertips. Then I run them down to his stomach, his perfect little belly that is just the right amount of squishy.</p><p>I don\u2019t think I can wait any longer.</p><p>I crawl up and gently kiss his cheek a couple of times. He stirs, but doesn\u2019t appear to wake up. Dan and his heavy sleeping. I smile and continue to kiss him, this time on his ears and neck and every inch of skin my lips can reach and this time, I get a reaction. \u2018Phiwww,\u2019 he grunts, half-asleep but still awake enough to know I\u2019m intentionally waking him up. He hasn\u2019t opened his eyes, he doesn\u2019t need to. He\u2019s just as pretty like this.</p><p>\u2018Morning,\u2019 I say, and place my hand on his cheek. He opens his eyes, brown, angelic eyes meeting mine, and I can\u2019t help but lean in and kiss him. Both of us taste of morning breath but it doesn\u2019t matter, everything about him is sweet and so is his kiss. He places his hand on my lower back and pulls me up to lie on top of him and I\u2019m happy to comply.</p><p>His tongue finds its way inside my mouth and all I can think about is this warmth, this unending sense of safety and cosiness spreading all throughout my body just by glancing at him. When he touches my hair a burst of electricity shoot up and down my arms, neck and chest and all I want to do is to stay right here, right now with my Dan.</p><p>My Dan.</p><p>He pulls away and my whole body screams for more, more touch, more sweetness and serenity but instead I plant a kiss to his forehead and lie down on his shoulder, burying my head into his neck.</p><p>He giggles, and kisses my forehead as well. The sensation leaves a tingling feeling all throughout my body. \u2018That\u2019s one hell of a way to start your day,\u2019 he says. I love how raspy his voice is in the morning. Not only is it incredibly sexy, it\u2019s also fricking adorable. All I want is for him to talk more. Whisper in my ear and tell me how much he loves me.</p><p>Dan loves me. I know he does. Every hour of every day he reminds me of that and I never get sick of hearing about it. He tells me he loves my hair when it\u2019s wet and messy from the shower. He loves my body and everything about it. He loves my laugh and my smile and my mouth. He loves the way I look with my glasses on. He loves me, every hour of every day, and there\u2019s nothing I\u2019d rather want than his love, right here and right now.</p><p>\u2018Everything feels so new with you,\u2019 I say.</p><p>\u2018Hmm?\u2019 He strokes a bit of fringe away from my face. Fingertips lightly grazing my skin.</p><p>\u2018I mean like, I can\u2019t get enough of you.\u2019 I look at him. His eyes are so, so pretty. \u2018I still feel like there\u2019s more to explore, more to experience, more to feel when I\u2019m around you. I\u2019ve been with you for ten years and there\u2019s no side of you I\u2019ve grown bored of. I just &hellip; adore you.\u2019</p><p>He\u2019s quiet for a moment. Then he kisses me again.

He\u2019d sorely overestimated the entertainment value his phone held. There were only so many times he could refresh Twitter or Instagram. He\u2019d even ventured into tumblr for a bit, but everyone was talking about the newest Marvel movie that he hadn\u2019t had time to see yet, and he refused to be spoiled when he\u2019d been looking forward to seeing it for months.</p><p>The person using the outlet next to him, who Dan had been dutifully ignoring, unplugged and moved away. He considered using the other outlet for his laptop charger, but he decided against it; there was no use being a complete dick.</p><p>The spot was filled quickly, though, by a tall man with black hair pushed off his forehead into a drooping quiff. He looked tired and grumpy, too, so Dan angled his body away. The man gave a loud huff as he sat down on the floor next to him. They were almost touching - the floor was crowded with people trying to get their technology fix, and it made his skin prickle a bit. He wasn\u2019t big on being touched, especially by strangers.</p><p>The man adjusted himself to get more comfortable and accidentally bumped into Dan. \u201cOops! I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Dan was temporarily thrown by the deep Northern accent that he spoke in. Being in LA, he expected someone American, though seeing as how it was a flight back to London, maybe he shouldn\u2019t have been.</p><p>\u201c\u2018S fine,\u201d he mumbled back, turning to face him.</p><p>It was the first time that Dan had gotten a good look at the stranger, and he suddenly wished that he had put more effort into his appearance when he\u2019d dragged himself out of his hotel this morning.</p><p>His outlet-mate was cute, the kind of cute that made it hard to focus on anything else. His eyes were a bright blue that reminded Dan of the beaches he\u2019d been visiting that week. They were framed by thick black Ray Ban style glasses and there was a smattering of freckles across his cheekbones, and Dan had an irrational thought about touching them to see if they were as soft as they looked.</p><p>\u201cFlight delayed?\u201d he asked, snapping Dan out of his reverie.</p><p>\u201cOh, uh, yeah. I imagine everyone\u2019s is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuh.\u201d He smacked himself in the head, probably harder than he intended, given how he knocked his glasses off and into Dan\u2019s lap.</p><p>Dan picked them up and handed them back gingerly, watching as the man\u2019s cheeks flushed a pretty pink color.</p><p>\u201cGod, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m a wreck today.\u201d</p><p>Dan shrugged, giving him a small smile. \u201cI think most people are when they travel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish there was some traveling actually going on. I miss my bed.\u201d</p><p>It was an opening. Dan could continue the conversation with this cute stranger, but he hesitated. He had a very firm policy on not making small talk with people he didn\u2019t know, but there was something about this stranger. Maybe it was the blue of his eyes, or the way his smile stretched too wide across his face, but Dan took the bait.</p><p>\u201cWere you on holiday?\u201d</p><p>He looked almost relieved that Dan\u2019s replied, and his face brightened despite still looking tired.</p><p>\u201cYes! My family decided to come to LA instead of Florida like we usually do. I was kinda disappointed because I was looking forward to going back to Harry Potter World, but I guess Disneyland is okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like Harry Potter?\u201d It probably wasn\u2019t the point that he was trying to make, but Dan latched onto the first thing he was familiar with.</p><p>\u201cYes! I\u2019ve seen the movies, but I never read the books.\u201d He shrugged like he hadn\u2019t just devastated Dan.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re one of <i>those</i> people.\u201d</p><p>It was a joke, but it was a risky one. Dan\u2019s tone never properly conveyed that he was joking, but he breathed a sigh of relief when the man grinned again.</p><p>\u201cAt least I know what house I\u2019m in! You can still be a fan without reading the books.\u201d</p><p>Dan pursed his lips and he could tell his dimples were out, given the way that the stranger\u2019s eyes fell downward, and a subconscious smile pulled at Dan\u2019s lips.</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a purist, eh?\u201d He bumped their shoulders together, and under normal circumstances Dan would probably flinch, but this time he only felt the warmth of the stranger&rsquo;s arm and it just made him feel a small spark rather than anxiety.</p><p>\u201cI am. I\u2019m that terrible friend that insists on reading the book before I see the movie. I also refuse to watch any trailers before I see any movies. I\u2019m currently avoiding all social media so I don\u2019t get spoiled for the new Marvel movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god, I\u2019m so excited to see it!\u201d</p><p>Dan could feel his cheeks hurt from smiling; the muscles in his face were getting more use than they had in ages. \u201cI was supposed to see it when I got home, but&hellip;\u201d He gestured around to the terminal they were sitting in.</p><p>\u201cThat sucks!\u201d</p><p>His phone chimed and his attention moved towards it, so Dan just nodded a bit even though he wasn\u2019t looking anymore and tried to find something on his own phone that could hold his attention as well as the man to his right had been.</p><p>-</p><p>In reality, it was only about 45 seconds from Dan looking down at his phone to the stranger nudging his shoulder gently to get his attention, but it felt like ages.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that. My mum is a worrier.\u201d</p><p>Dan locked his phone, grateful that he could stop opening and closing the same app over and over. \u201cMine, too. I think it\u2019s like a universal mum thing. Is she here?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cOh, no, they\u2019re staying for a few more days. I have to get back to uni, so I\u2019m leaving a little early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too. Our families are just abandoning us while we slave away at uni. How tragic.\u201d</p><p>The boy giggled a bit in response. God, this guy was cute. Dan was staring a bit, but so was he, so it wasn\u2019t the end of the world.</p><p>\u201cOh! I\u2019m Phil, by the way. How rude of me not to introduce myself!\u201d</p><p>He held out his hand and Dan clasped it, surprised at how nicely it fit in his own, slightly larger one.</p><p>\u201cYour hands are soft.\u201d</p><p>Fuck. Why was he such a mess? He shook his head and tried to correct himself, but Phil just laughed, his head thrown back, exposing the long line of his throat. Dan was still staring when Phil looked back at him; it was then he realized that their hands were still clasped. Dan pulled his away, <i>very</i> aware of the pink of his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI moisturize every day!\u201d Phil said proudly, helping to break the beat of awkward silence.</p><p>\u201cDo you really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmhmm. It was one of those weird things that my mum always insisted on - moisturizing and, like, putting on lotion every day, so I never really grew out of the habit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose there are worse habits,\u201d Dan chuckled. \u201cOh, and I\u2019m Dan, by the way.\u201d</p><p>Phil stared at him for a second, like he was soaking up his appearance or something. \u201cDan. That\u2019s a nice name.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s face was fully red and felt hot and splotchy, but he was saved the embarrassment of trying to come up with a reply by someone coming up and asking if the outlet was free yet.</p><p>\u201cOh! Yes, I\u2019m sorry!\u201d Phil got up quickly, removing his charger, and Dan got up, too, not quite ready to part ways with his newfound companion.</p><p>Phil looked ecstatic to see that Dan had given up his spot to and hitched a thumb over his shoulder. \u201cDo you wanna go get a coffee or something?\u201d</p><p>He usually avoided caffeine when he traveled, not wanting to give another stimulant to his anxiety, but one glance over at the arrival and departure board told him he wasn\u2019t about to leave any time soon.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he agreed and followed Phil.</p><p>-</p><p>The line to the coffee shop was long, but for once Dan didn\u2019t mind. He had someone cute to talk to that he actually had a lot in common with. He had definitely had worse days, even with his flight being delayed.</p><p>When it was their turn to order, Phil pulled out his wallet to pay for their drinks even though Dan tried to refuse.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my treat for keeping me company.\u201d</p><p>Dan mumbled his thanks, willing the blush that had been nearly non-stop since he first started talking to Phil to go away.</p><p>\u201cWhere should we drink these?\u2019 Phil asked, handing Dan his drink.</p><p>He glanced around the shop and saw that every spot available was taken, so he looked out to the terminal, eyes finding a couple of seats near the windows facing the runaway.</p><p>\u201cThere?\u201d He pointed to the spot that he had found and Phil beamed, letting Dan lead the way.</p><p>It was still storming outside, ominous black clouds covering the sky and golf ball sized drops of rain covering everything in their path. It was pretty, despite the fact that it was keeping Dan stuck in a foreign country. Though he glanced over to Phil once they sat, and thought that maybe that wasn\u2019t such a terrible thing.</p><p>\u201cI love storms,\u201d Phil said, like he could read Dan\u2019s mind. \u201cThere\u2019s almost always a summer storm while we\u2019re in Florida. Is it weird that I\u2019m kinda happy that one happened here, too?\u201d</p><p>Dan shrugged. \u201cI mean, it could have happened on a better day rather than the day we\u2019re trying to leave the country, but I think I get it.\u201d</p><p>They didn\u2019t say anything else for a while, just sipping their coffees and staring out the window.</p><p>There was an ease between them that Dan had never felt. Most of Dan\u2019s life had been filled by awkward silences that he didn\u2019t know how to fill, but this felt different. He didn\u2019t feel the need to keep talking to fill the quiet space between them. It felt like he could exist for a second.</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cSo what were you doing in LA?\u201d Phil asked after a while, taking the final drink of his coffee.</p><p>\u201cFamily holiday, too. We usually go somewhere a bit more, I don\u2019t know, different? Like one year we went to India and it was incredible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so cool! I want to travel other places in the world, I\u2019m just kinda scared to do it by myself.\u201d</p><p>Dan hummed in agreement. \u201cYeah, I know what you mean. I\u2019ve always wanted to go to Japan, but I would probably get thrown in jail for telling a bad joke or something.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s eyes were as wide as saucers and he punched Dan in the arm, probably harder than he meant to. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to go to Japan!\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Phil was practically vibrating with excitement. He grabbed Dan\u2019s arm and shook it, as if to emphasize how excited he was. \u201cYes! Oh my god, Dan, it\u2019s my dream vacation!\u201d</p><p>The next hour was filled with them discussing their favorite animes, which turned into their favorite movies and tv shows. How Dan had managed to find someone with almost the exact same interests as him clear across the world amazed him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve seen Buffy like a million times. I own the boxset and I rewatch it every few months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen it.\u201d</p><p>Phil looked like this was the ultimate betrayal. He clutched at his heart, scrunching up his face as if he was in pain. \u201cDan, how could you? I thought you were perfect.\u201d</p><p>All of the blood in his body rushed to his face; even the tips of his ears felt hot. He stuttered something about how he certainly was not perfect, but Phil was already talking again.</p><p>\u201cYou have to watch it! I can lend it to you!\u201d</p><p>Dan shook his head in disbelief. \u201cYou can\u2019t just lend your boxset of your favorite show to a stranger, Phil.\u201d</p><p>Phil considered this before an almost devious smile formed. \u201cOkay, we can just watch it together, that way you can\u2019t steal it.\u201d</p><p>There were <i>so</i> many holes in that plan, but Phil\u2019s enthusiasm was catching.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I\u2019m secretly, like, a murder or, like, a cannibal?\u201d</p><p>Phil waved his hand dismissively. \u201cThat\u2019s a problem for future Phil.\u201d</p><p>That made Dan laugh out loud, and normally he would feel self conscious at being a little loud in a public place, but there was something about Phil that made him care a little less. Who cared about everyone else when Phil was smiling all big and proud at him?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy.\u201d He didn\u2019t even bother trying to keep the fondness out of his voice.</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s not a no,\u201d Phil said, nudging him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay, but you don\u2019t gotta be all smug about it.\u201d Dan knocked their shoulders together and Phil leaned into the pressure.</p><p>There was a second where Dan almost leaned in. Phil\u2019s eyes were trained on him, and he thought that maybe Phil was going to lean forward, but then an announcement rang out over the speakers, snapping them out of the moment.</p><p>\u201cFlight BA1019 is now boarding. Please proceed to the departure gate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I think that\u2019s me,\u201d Dan said, pulling his ticket out of his backpack.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me, too,\u201d Phil said brightly, and Dan felt that tingling, excited feeling in his tummy. The same feeling he\u2019d had since he started talking to Phil hours ago.</p><p>Their seats weren\u2019t anywhere close to each other, but knowing that Phil was there somewhere on the plane made the ten hour flight a little bit more bearable.</p><p>-</p><p>He wasn\u2019t entirely surprised to see Phil standing by the exit waiting for him, but he couldn\u2019t deny how happy it made him.</p><p>\u201cGood flight?\u201d Phil asked, slinging his backpack across his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cLong,\u201d Dan corrected, but he still smiled because he was finding it nearly impossible not to when he was near Phil. \u201cI\u2019m ready to sleep and not leave my bed for a year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, me, too. I can never sleep on flights.\u201d</p><p>They were stood in front of the exit, Dan needing to go left and Phil\u2019s body facing right. It didn\u2019t seem quite right to leave, but there wasn\u2019t anything popping into his brain that would give him a good excuse for staying, so he gave an awkward wave and said he had to go.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>They both twitched, as if they were both going in for hug, but neither did, so Dan took that as a sign and turned to leave.</p><p>He\u2019d only made it about ten feet when he heard heavy footsteps behind him and felt a hand on his arm. Turning quickly, he saw Phil, cheeks that sweet pink color.</p><p>\u201cCan I have your number? For, like, Buffy and stuff?\u201d</p><p>Dan was very curious what the \u2018stuff\u2019 Phil was talking about was, but he just pulled out his phone and let Phil enter his number and then watched as Phil pulled out his own, saving the number from the text he\u2019d sent himself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll text you,\u201d he said, handing Dan his phone back.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Phil moved forward and pressed a quick kiss to Dan\u2019s cheek; the same place where his dimple was currently making a crater on his face. He didn\u2019t have any time to say anything by the time that Phil was waving and moving toward his destination.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure how long he stood there, palm pressed to the spot that Phil had kissed, but when his body finally moved again, it was with a skip in his step and grin on his face.</p>",

They were almost touching - the floor was crowded with people trying to get their technology fix, and it made his skin prickle a bit. He wasn\u2019t big on being touched, especially by strangers.</p><p>The man adjusted himself to get more comfortable and accidentally bumped into Dan. \u201cOops! I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Dan was temporarily thrown by the deep Northern accent that he spoke in. Being in LA, he expected someone American, though seeing as how it was a flight back to London, maybe he shouldn\u2019t have been.</p><p>\u201c\u2018S fine,\u201d he mumbled back, turning to face him.</p><p>It was the first time that Dan had gotten a good look at the stranger, and he suddenly wished that he had put more effort into his appearance when he\u2019d dragged himself out of his hotel this morning.</p><p>His outlet-mate was cute, the kind of cute that made it hard to focus on anything else. His eyes were a bright blue that reminded Dan of the beaches he\u2019d been visiting that week. They were framed by thick black Ray Ban style glasses and there was a smattering of freckles across his cheekbones, and Dan had an irrational thought about touching them to see if they were as soft as they looked.</p><p>\u201cFlight delayed?\u201d he asked, snapping Dan out of his reverie.</p><p>\u201cOh, uh, yeah. I imagine everyone\u2019s is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuh.\u201d He smacked himself in the head, probably harder than he intended, given how he knocked his glasses off and into Dan\u2019s lap.</p><p>Dan picked them up and handed them back gingerly, watching as the man\u2019s cheeks flushed a pretty pink color.</p><p>\u201cGod, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m a wreck today.\u201d</p><p>Dan shrugged, giving him a small smile. \u201cI think most people are when they travel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish there was some traveling actually going on. I miss my bed.\u201d</p><p>It was an opening. Dan could continue the conversation with this cute stranger, but he hesitated. He had a very firm policy on not making small talk with people he didn\u2019t know, but there was something about this stranger. Maybe it was the blue of his eyes, or the way his smile stretched too wide across his face, but Dan took the bait.</p><p>\u201cWere you on holiday?\u201d</p><p>He looked almost relieved that Dan\u2019s replied, and his face brightened despite still looking tired.</p><p>\u201cYes! My family decided to come to LA instead of Florida like we usually do. I was kinda disappointed because I was looking forward to going back to Harry Potter World, but I guess Disneyland is okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like Harry Potter?\u201d It probably wasn\u2019t the point that he was trying to make, but Dan latched onto the first thing he was familiar with.</p><p>\u201cYes! I\u2019ve seen the movies, but I never read the books.\u201d He shrugged like he hadn\u2019t just devastated Dan.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re one of <i>those</i> people.\u201d</p><p>It was a joke, but it was a risky one. Dan\u2019s tone never properly conveyed that he was joking, but he breathed a sigh of relief when the man grinned again.</p><p>\u201cAt least I know what house I\u2019m in! You can still be a fan without reading the books.\u201d</p><p>Dan pursed his lips and he could tell his dimples were out, given the way that the stranger\u2019s eyes fell downward, and a subconscious smile pulled at Dan\u2019s lips.</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a purist, eh?\u201d He bumped their shoulders together, and under normal circumstances Dan would probably flinch, but this time he only felt the warmth of the stranger\u2019s arm and it just made him feel a small spark rather than anxiety.</p><p>\u201cI am. I\u2019m that terrible friend that insists on reading the book before I see the movie. I also refuse to watch any trailers before I see any movies. I\u2019m currently avoiding all social media so I don\u2019t get spoiled for the new Marvel movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god, I\u2019m so excited to see it!\u201d</p><p>Dan could feel his cheeks hurt from smiling; the muscles in his face were getting more use than they had in ages. \u201cI was supposed to see it when I got home, but\u2026\u201d He gestured around to the terminal they were sitting in.</p><p>\u201cThat sucks!\u201d</p><p>His phone chimed and his attention moved towards it, so Dan just nodded a bit even though he wasn\u2019t looking anymore and tried to find something on his own phone that could hold his attention as well as the man to his right had been.</p><p>-</p><p>In reality, it was only about 45 seconds from Dan looking down at his phone to the stranger nudging his shoulder gently to get his attention, but it felt like ages.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that. My mum is a worrier.\u201d</p><p>Dan locked his phone, grateful that he could stop opening and closing the same app over and over. \u201cMine, too. I think it\u2019s like a universal mum thing. Is she here?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cOh, no, they\u2019re staying for a few more days. I have to get back to uni, so I\u2019m leaving a little early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too. Our families are just abandoning us while we slave away at uni. How tragic.\u201d</p><p>The boy giggled a bit in response. God, this guy was cute. Dan was staring a bit, but so was he, so it wasn\u2019t the end of the world.</p><p>\u201cOh! I\u2019m Phil, by the way. How rude of me not to introduce myself!\u201d</p><p>He held out his hand and Dan clasped it, surprised at how nicely it fit in his own, slightly larger one.</p><p>\u201cYour hands are soft.\u201d</p><p>Fuck. Why was he such a mess? He shook his head and tried to correct himself, but Phil just laughed, his head thrown back, exposing the long line of his throat. Dan was still staring when Phil looked back at him; it was then he realized that their hands were still clasped. Dan pulled his away, <i>very</i> aware of the pink of his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI moisturize every day!\u201d Phil said proudly, helping to break the beat of awkward silence.</p><p>\u201cDo you really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmhmm. It was one of those weird things that my mum always insisted on - moisturizing and, like, putting on lotion every day, so I never really grew out of the habit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose there are worse habits,\u201d Dan chuckled. \u201cOh, and I\u2019m Dan, by the way.\u201d</p><p>Phil stared at him for a second, like he was soaking up his appearance or something. \u201cDan. That\u2019s a nice name.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s face was fully red and felt hot and splotchy, but he was saved the embarrassment of trying to come up with a reply by someone coming up and asking if the outlet was free yet.</p><p>\u201cOh! Yes, I\u2019m sorry!\u201d Phil got up quickly, removing his charger, and Dan got up, too, not quite ready to part ways with his newfound companion.</p><p>Phil looked ecstatic to see that Dan had given up his spot to and hitched a thumb over his shoulder. \u201cDo you wanna go get a coffee or something?\u201d</p><p>He usually avoided caffeine when he traveled, not wanting to give another stimulant to his anxiety, but one glance over at the arrival and departure board told him he wasn\u2019t about to leave any time soon.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he agreed and followed Phil.</p><p>-</p><p>The line to the coffee shop was long, but for once Dan didn\u2019t mind. He had someone cute to talk to that he actually had a lot in common with. He had definitely had worse days, even with his flight being delayed.</p><p>When it was their turn to order, Phil pulled out his wallet to pay for their drinks even though Dan tried to refuse.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my treat for keeping me company.\u201d</p><p>Dan mumbled his thanks, willing the blush that had been nearly non-stop since he first started talking to Phil to go away.</p><p>\u201cWhere should we drink these?\u2019 Phil asked, handing Dan his drink.</p><p>He glanced around the shop and saw that every spot available was taken, so he looked out to the terminal, eyes finding a couple of seats near the windows facing the runaway.</p><p>\u201cThere?\u201d He pointed to the spot that he had found and Phil beamed, letting Dan lead the way.</p><p>It was still storming outside, ominous black clouds covering the sky and golf ball sized drops of rain covering everything in their path. It was pretty, despite the fact that it was keeping Dan stuck in a foreign country. Though he glanced over to Phil once they sat, and thought that maybe that wasn\u2019t such a terrible thing.</p><p>\u201cI love storms,\u201d Phil said, like he could read Dan\u2019s mind. \u201cThere\u2019s almost always a summer storm while we\u2019re in Florida. Is it weird that I\u2019m kinda happy that one happened here, too?\u201d</p><p>Dan shrugged. \u201cI mean, it could have happened on a better day rather than the day we\u2019re trying to leave the country, but I think I get it.\u201d</p><p>They didn\u2019t say anything else for a while, just sipping their coffees and staring out the window.</p><p>There was an ease between them that Dan had never felt. Most of Dan\u2019s life had been filled by awkward silences that he didn\u2019t know how to fill, but this felt different. He didn\u2019t feel the need to keep talking to fill the quiet space between them. It felt like he could exist for a second.</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cSo what were you doing in LA?\u201d Phil asked after a while, taking the final drink of his coffee.</p><p>\u201cFamily holiday, too. We usually go somewhere a bit more, I don\u2019t know, different? Like one year we went to India and it was incredible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so cool! I want to travel other places in the world, I\u2019m just kinda scared to do it by myself.\u201d</p><p>Dan hummed in agreement. \u201cYeah, I know what you mean. I\u2019ve always wanted to go to Japan, but I would probably get thrown in jail for telling a bad joke or something.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s eyes were as wide as saucers and he punched Dan in the arm, probably harder than he meant to. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to go to Japan!\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Phil was practically vibrating with excitement. He grabbed Dan\u2019s arm and shook it, as if to emphasize how excited he was. \u201cYes! Oh my god, Dan, it\u2019s my dream vacation!\u201d</p><p>The next hour was filled with them discussing their favorite animes, which turned into their favorite movies and tv shows. How Dan had managed to find someone with almost the exact same interests as him clear across the world amazed him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve seen Buffy like a million times. I own the boxset and I rewatch it every few months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen it.\u201d</p><p>Phil looked like this was the ultimate betrayal. He clutched at his heart, scrunching up his face as if he was in pain. \u201cDan, how could you? I thought you were perfect.\u201d</p><p>All of the blood in his body rushed to his face; even the tips of his ears felt hot. He stuttered something about how he certainly was not perfect, but Phil was already talking again.</p><p>\u201cYou have to watch it! I can lend it to you!\u201d</p><p>Dan shook his head in disbelief. \u201cYou can\u2019t just lend your boxset of your favorite show to a stranger, Phil.\u201d</p><p>Phil considered this before an almost devious smile formed. \u201cOkay, we can just watch it together, that way you can\u2019t steal it.\u201d</p><p>There were <i>so</i> many holes in that plan, but Phil\u2019s enthusiasm was catching.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I\u2019m secretly, like, a murder or, like, a cannibal?\u201d</p><p>Phil waved his hand dismissively. \u201cThat\u2019s a problem for future Phil.\u201d</p><p>That made Dan laugh out loud, and normally he would feel self conscious at being a little loud in a public place, but there was something about Phil that made him care a little less. Who cared about everyone else when Phil was smiling all big and proud at him?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy.\u201d He didn\u2019t even bother trying to keep the fondness out of his voice.</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s not a no,\u201d Phil said, nudging him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay, but you don\u2019t gotta be all smug about it.\u201d Dan knocked their shoulders together and Phil leaned into the pressure.</p><p>There was a second where Dan almost leaned in. Phil\u2019s eyes were trained on him, and he thought that maybe Phil was going to lean forward, but then an announcement rang out over the speakers, snapping them out of the moment.</p><p>\u201cFlight BA1019 is now boarding. Please proceed to the departure gate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I think that\u2019s me,\u201d Dan said, pulling his ticket out of his backpack.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me, too,\u201d Phil said brightly, and Dan felt that tingling, excited feeling in his tummy. The same feeling he\u2019d had since he started talking to Phil hours ago.</p><p>Their seats weren\u2019t anywhere close to each other, but knowing that Phil was there somewhere on the plane made the ten hour flight a little bit more bearable.</p><p>-</p><p>He wasn\u2019t entirely surprised to see Phil standing by the exit waiting for him, but he couldn\u2019t deny how happy it made him.</p><p>\u201cGood flight?\u201d Phil asked, slinging his backpack across his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cLong,\u201d Dan corrected, but he still smiled because he was finding it nearly impossible not to when he was near Phil. \u201cI\u2019m ready to sleep and not leave my bed for a year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, me, too. I can never sleep on flights.\u201d</p><p>They were stood in front of the exit, Dan needing to go left and Phil\u2019s body facing right. It didn\u2019t seem quite right to leave, but there wasn\u2019t anything popping into his brain that would give him a good excuse for staying, so he gave an awkward wave and said he had to go.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>They both twitched, as if they were both going in for hug, but neither did, so Dan took that as a sign and turned to leave.</p><p>He\u2019d only made it about ten feet when he heard heavy footsteps behind him and felt a hand on his arm. Turning quickly, he saw Phil, cheeks that sweet pink color.</p><p>\u201cCan I have your number? For, like, Buffy and stuff?\u201d</p><p>Dan was very curious what the \u2018stuff\u2019 Phil was talking about was, but he just pulled out his phone and let Phil enter his number and then watched as Phil pulled out his own, saving the number from the text he\u2019d sent himself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll text you,\u201d he said, handing Dan his phone back.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Phil moved forward and pressed a quick kiss to Dan\u2019s cheek; the same place where his dimple was currently making a crater on his face. He didn\u2019t have any time to say anything by the time that Phil was waving and moving toward his destination.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure how long he stood there, palm pressed to the spot that Phil had kissed, but when his body finally moved again, it was with a skip in his step and grin on his face.</p>",

His head hurt, he was sunburned, and he just desperately wanted to go home and sleep in his own bed.</p><p>That wouldn\u2019t be possible for hours, or closer to a day, though. His flight home from LA was delayed due to inclement weather. Wasn\u2019t LA supposed to be all sun and fun and whatnot? It was stupid, and he was grumpy, and just desperately wanted to get home.</p><p>An outlet opened up on the wall opposite his chair, and Dan sprinted to it as fast as his sore body would carry him. The woman he beat looked pissed, but he didn\u2019t care. Normally he was a pretty nice guy, but not when he\u2019d been out in the sun for a week straight and had no internet.</p><p>He plugged his charger in, and when the Apple logo lit up his screen, he gave a deep sigh of relief. His therapist would probably lecture him on his addiction to technology, but his therapist was clear across the world, so he cradled his phone in his too large hands and sent out a \u2018thank you\u2019 to the universe that at least <i>one</i> thing went right today.</p>[[MORE]]<p>-</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long for him to get bored. He\u2019d sorely overestimated the entertainment value his phone held. There were only so many times he could refresh Twitter or Instagram. He\u2019d even ventured into tumblr for a bit, but everyone was talking about the newest Marvel movie that he hadn\u2019t had time to see yet, and he refused to be spoiled when he\u2019d been looking forward to seeing it for months.</p><p>The person using the outlet next to him, who Dan had been dutifully ignoring, unplugged and moved away. He considered using the other outlet for his laptop charger, but he decided against it; there was no use being a complete dick.</p><p>The spot was filled quickly, though, by a tall man with black hair pushed off his forehead into a drooping quiff. He looked tired and grumpy, too, so Dan angled his body away. The man gave a loud huff as he sat down on the floor next to him. They were almost touching - the floor was crowded with people trying to get their technology fix, and it made his skin prickle a bit. He wasn\u2019t big on being touched, especially by strangers.</p><p>The man adjusted himself to get more comfortable and accidentally bumped into Dan. \u201cOops! I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Dan was temporarily thrown by the deep Northern accent that he spoke in. Being in LA, he expected someone American, though seeing as how it was a flight back to London, maybe he shouldn\u2019t have been.</p><p>\u201c\u2018S fine,\u201d he mumbled back, turning to face him.</p><p>It was the first time that Dan had gotten a good look at the stranger, and he suddenly wished that he had put more effort into his appearance when he\u2019d dragged himself out of his hotel this morning.</p><p>His outlet-mate was cute, the kind of cute that made it hard to focus on anything else. His eyes were a bright blue that reminded Dan of the beaches he\u2019d been visiting that week. They were framed by thick black Ray Ban style glasses and there was a smattering of freckles across his cheekbones, and Dan had an irrational thought about touching them to see if they were as soft as they looked.</p><p>\u201cFlight delayed?\u201d he asked, snapping Dan out of his reverie.</p><p>\u201cOh, uh, yeah. I imagine everyone\u2019s is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuh.\u201d He smacked himself in the head, probably harder than he intended, given how he knocked his glasses off and into Dan\u2019s lap.</p><p>Dan picked them up and handed them back gingerly, watching as the man\u2019s cheeks flushed a pretty pink color.</p><p>\u201cGod, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m a wreck today.\u201d</p><p>Dan shrugged, giving him a small smile. \u201cI think most people are when they travel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish there was some traveling actually going on. I miss my bed.\u201d</p><p>It was an opening. Dan could continue the conversation with this cute stranger, but he hesitated. He had a very firm policy on not making small talk with people he didn\u2019t know, but there was something about this stranger. Maybe it was the blue of his eyes, or the way his smile stretched too wide across his face, but Dan took the bait.</p><p>\u201cWere you on holiday?\u201d</p><p>He looked almost relieved that Dan\u2019s replied, and his face brightened despite still looking tired.</p><p>\u201cYes! My family decided to come to LA instead of Florida like we usually do. I was kinda disappointed because I was looking forward to going back to Harry Potter World, but I guess Disneyland is okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like Harry Potter?\u201d It probably wasn\u2019t the point that he was trying to make, but Dan latched onto the first thing he was familiar with.</p><p>\u201cYes! I\u2019ve seen the movies, but I never read the books.\u201d He shrugged like he hadn\u2019t just devastated Dan.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re one of <i>those</i> people.\u201d</p><p>It was a joke, but it was a risky one. Dan\u2019s tone never properly conveyed that he was joking, but he breathed a sigh of relief when the man grinned again.</p><p>\u201cAt least I know what house I\u2019m in! You can still be a fan without reading the books.\u201d</p><p>Dan pursed his lips and he could tell his dimples were out, given the way that the stranger\u2019s eyes fell downward, and a subconscious smile pulled at Dan\u2019s lips.</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a purist, eh?\u201d He bumped their shoulders together, and under normal circumstances Dan would probably flinch, but this time he only felt the warmth of the stranger\u2019s arm and it just made him feel a small spark rather than anxiety.</p><p>\u201cI am. I\u2019m that terrible friend that insists on reading the book before I see the movie. I also refuse to watch any trailers before I see any movies. I\u2019m currently avoiding all social media so I don\u2019t get spoiled for the new Marvel movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god, I\u2019m so excited to see it!\u201d</p><p>Dan could feel his cheeks hurt from smiling; the muscles in his face were getting more use than they had in ages. \u201cI was supposed to see it when I got home, but\u2026\u201d He gestured around to the terminal they were sitting in.</p><p>\u201cThat sucks!\u201d</p><p>His phone chimed and his attention moved towards it, so Dan just nodded a bit even though he wasn\u2019t looking anymore and tried to find something on his own phone that could hold his attention as well as the man to his right had been.</p><p>-</p><p>In reality, it was only about 45 seconds from Dan looking down at his phone to the stranger nudging his shoulder gently to get his attention, but it felt like ages.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that. My mum is a worrier.\u201d</p><p>Dan locked his phone, grateful that he could stop opening and closing the same app over and over. \u201cMine, too. I think it\u2019s like a universal mum thing. Is she here?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cOh, no, they\u2019re staying for a few more days. I have to get back to uni, so I\u2019m leaving a little early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too. Our families are just abandoning us while we slave away at uni. How tragic.\u201d</p><p>The boy giggled a bit in response. God, this guy was cute. Dan was staring a bit, but so was he, so it wasn\u2019t the end of the world.</p><p>\u201cOh! I\u2019m Phil, by the way. How rude of me not to introduce myself!\u201d</p><p>He held out his hand and Dan clasped it, surprised at how nicely it fit in his own, slightly larger one.</p><p>\u201cYour hands are soft.\u201d</p><p>Fuck. Why was he such a mess? He shook his head and tried to correct himself, but Phil just laughed, his head thrown back, exposing the long line of his throat. Dan was still staring when Phil looked back at him; it was then he realized that their hands were still clasped. Dan pulled his away, <i>very</i> aware of the pink of his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI moisturize every day!\u201d Phil said proudly, helping to break the beat of awkward silence.</p><p>\u201cDo you really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmhmm. It was one of those weird things that my mum always insisted on - moisturizing and, like, putting on lotion every day, so I never really grew out of the habit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose there are worse habits,\u201d Dan chuckled. \u201cOh, and I\u2019m Dan, by the way.\u201d</p><p>Phil stared at him for a second, like he was soaking up his appearance or something. \u201cDan. That\u2019s a nice name.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s face was fully red and felt hot and splotchy, but he was saved the embarrassment of trying to come up with a reply by someone coming up and asking if the outlet was free yet.</p><p>\u201cOh! Yes, I\u2019m sorry!\u201d Phil got up quickly, removing his charger, and Dan got up, too, not quite ready to part ways with his newfound companion.</p><p>Phil looked ecstatic to see that Dan had given up his spot to and hitched a thumb over his shoulder. \u201cDo you wanna go get a coffee or something?\u201d</p><p>He usually avoided caffeine when he traveled, not wanting to give another stimulant to his anxiety, but one glance over at the arrival and departure board told him he wasn\u2019t about to leave any time soon.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he agreed and followed Phil.</p><p>-</p><p>The line to the coffee shop was long, but for once Dan didn\u2019t mind. He had someone cute to talk to that he actually had a lot in common with. He had definitely had worse days, even with his flight being delayed.</p><p>When it was their turn to order, Phil pulled out his wallet to pay for their drinks even though Dan tried to refuse.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my treat for keeping me company.\u201d</p><p>Dan mumbled his thanks, willing the blush that had been nearly non-stop since he first started talking to Phil to go away.</p><p>\u201cWhere should we drink these?\u2019 Phil asked, handing Dan his drink.</p><p>He glanced around the shop and saw that every spot available was taken, so he looked out to the terminal, eyes finding a couple of seats near the windows facing the runaway.</p><p>\u201cThere?\u201d He pointed to the spot that he had found and Phil beamed, letting Dan lead the way.</p><p>It was still storming outside, ominous black clouds covering the sky and golf ball sized drops of rain covering everything in their path. It was pretty, despite the fact that it was keeping Dan stuck in a foreign country. Though he glanced over to Phil once they sat, and thought that maybe that wasn\u2019t such a terrible thing.</p><p>\u201cI love storms,\u201d Phil said, like he could read Dan\u2019s mind. \u201cThere\u2019s almost always a summer storm while we\u2019re in Florida. Is it weird that I\u2019m kinda happy that one happened here, too?\u201d</p><p>Dan shrugged. \u201cI mean, it could have happened on a better day rather than the day we\u2019re trying to leave the country, but I think I get it.\u201d</p><p>They didn\u2019t say anything else for a while, just sipping their coffees and staring out the window.</p><p>There was an ease between them that Dan had never felt. Most of Dan\u2019s life had been filled by awkward silences that he didn\u2019t know how to fill, but this felt different. He didn\u2019t feel the need to keep talking to fill the quiet space between them. It felt like he could exist for a second.</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cSo what were you doing in LA?\u201d Phil asked after a while, taking the final drink of his coffee.</p><p>\u201cFamily holiday, too. We usually go somewhere a bit more, I don\u2019t know, different? Like one year we went to India and it was incredible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so cool! I want to travel other places in the world, I\u2019m just kinda scared to do it by myself.\u201d</p><p>Dan hummed in agreement. \u201cYeah, I know what you mean. I\u2019ve always wanted to go to Japan, but I would probably get thrown in jail for telling a bad joke or something.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s eyes were as wide as saucers and he punched Dan in the arm, probably harder than he meant to. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to go to Japan!\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Phil was practically vibrating with excitement. He grabbed Dan\u2019s arm and shook it, as if to emphasize how excited he was. \u201cYes! Oh my god, Dan, it\u2019s my dream vacation!\u201d</p><p>The next hour was filled with them discussing their favorite animes, which turned into their favorite movies and tv shows. How Dan had managed to find someone with almost the exact same interests as him clear across the world amazed him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve seen Buffy like a million times. I own the boxset and I rewatch it every few months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen it.\u201d</p><p>Phil looked like this was the ultimate betrayal. He clutched at his heart, scrunching up his face as if he was in pain. \u201cDan, how could you? I thought you were perfect.\u201d</p><p>All of the blood in his body rushed to his face; even the tips of his ears felt hot. He stuttered something about how he certainly was not perfect, but Phil was already talking again.</p><p>\u201cYou have to watch it! I can lend it to you!\u201d</p><p>Dan shook his head in disbelief. \u201cYou can\u2019t just lend your boxset of your favorite show to a stranger, Phil.\u201d</p><p>Phil considered this before an almost devious smile formed. \u201cOkay, we can just watch it together, that way you can\u2019t steal it.\u201d</p><p>There were <i>so</i> many holes in that plan, but Phil\u2019s enthusiasm was catching.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I\u2019m secretly, like, a murder or, like, a cannibal?\u201d</p><p>Phil waved his hand dismissively. \u201cThat\u2019s a problem for future Phil.\u201d</p><p>That made Dan laugh out loud, and normally he would feel self conscious at being a little loud in a public place, but there was something about Phil that made him care a little less. Who cared about everyone else when Phil was smiling all big and proud at him?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy.\u201d He didn\u2019t even bother trying to keep the fondness out of his voice.</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s not a no,\u201d Phil said, nudging him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay, but you don\u2019t gotta be all smug about it.\u201d Dan knocked their shoulders together and Phil leaned into the pressure.</p><p>There was a second where Dan almost leaned in. Phil\u2019s eyes were trained on him, and he thought that maybe Phil was going to lean forward, but then an announcement rang out over the speakers, snapping them out of the moment.</p><p>\u201cFlight BA1019 is now boarding. Please proceed to the departure gate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I think that\u2019s me,\u201d Dan said, pulling his ticket out of his backpack.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me, too,\u201d Phil said brightly, and Dan felt that tingling, excited feeling in his tummy. The same feeling he\u2019d had since he started talking to Phil hours ago.</p><p>Their seats weren\u2019t anywhere close to each other, but knowing that Phil was there somewhere on the plane made the ten hour flight a little bit more bearable.</p><p>-</p><p>He wasn\u2019t entirely surprised to see Phil standing by the exit waiting for him, but he couldn\u2019t deny how happy it made him.</p><p>\u201cGood flight?\u201d Phil asked, slinging his backpack across his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cLong,\u201d Dan corrected, but he still smiled because he was finding it nearly impossible not to when he was near Phil. \u201cI\u2019m ready to sleep and not leave my bed for a year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, me, too. I can never sleep on flights.\u201d</p><p>They were stood in front of the exit, Dan needing to go left and Phil\u2019s body facing right. It didn\u2019t seem quite right to leave, but there wasn\u2019t anything popping into his brain that would give him a good excuse for staying, so he gave an awkward wave and said he had to go.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>They both twitched, as if they were both going in for hug, but neither did, so Dan took that as a sign and turned to leave.</p><p>He\u2019d only made it about ten feet when he heard heavy footsteps behind him and felt a hand on his arm. Turning quickly, he saw Phil, cheeks that sweet pink color.</p><p>\u201cCan I have your number? For, like, Buffy and stuff?\u201d</p><p>Dan was very curious what the \u2018stuff\u2019 Phil was talking about was, but he just pulled out his phone and let Phil enter his number and then watched as Phil pulled out his own, saving the number from the text he\u2019d sent himself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll text you,\u201d he said, handing Dan his phone back.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Phil moved forward and pressed a quick kiss to Dan\u2019s cheek; the same place where his dimple was currently making a crater on his face. He didn\u2019t have any time to say anything by the time that Phil was waving and moving toward his destination.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure how long he stood there, palm pressed to the spot that Phil had kissed, but when his body finally moved again, it was with a skip in his step and grin on his face.</p>",

His head hurt, he was sunburned, and he just desperately wanted to go home and sleep in his own bed.</p><p>That wouldn&rsquo;t be possible for hours, or closer to a day, though. His flight home from LA was delayed due to inclement weather. Wasn&rsquo;t LA supposed to be all sun and fun and whatnot? It was stupid, and he was grumpy, and just desperately wanted to get home.</p><p>An outlet opened up on the wall opposite his chair, and Dan sprinted to it as fast as his sore body would carry him. The woman he beat looked pissed, but he didn&rsquo;t care. Normally he was a pretty nice guy, but not when he&rsquo;d been out in the sun for a week straight and had no internet.</p><p>He plugged his charger in, and when the Apple logo lit up his screen, he gave a deep sigh of relief. His therapist would probably lecture him on his addiction to technology, but his therapist was clear across the world, so he cradled his phone in his too large hands and sent out a &lsquo;thank you&rsquo; to the universe that at least <i>one</i> thing went right today.</p><p>-</p><p>It didn&rsquo;t take long for him to get bored. He&rsquo;d sorely overestimated the entertainment value his phone held. There were only so many times he could refresh Twitter or Instagram. He&rsquo;d even ventured into tumblr for a bit, but everyone was talking about the newest Marvel movie that he hadn&rsquo;t had time to see yet, and he refused to be spoiled when he&rsquo;d been looking forward to seeing it for months.</p><p>The person using the outlet next to him, who Dan had been dutifully ignoring, unplugged and moved away. He considered using the other outlet for his laptop charger, but he decided against it; there was no use being a complete dick.</p><p>The spot was filled quickly, though, by a tall man with black hair pushed off his forehead into a drooping quiff. He looked tired and grumpy, too, so Dan angled his body away. The man gave a loud huff as he sat down on the floor next to him. They were almost touching - the floor was crowded with people trying to get their technology fix, and it made his skin prickle a bit. He wasn&rsquo;t big on being touched, especially by strangers.</p><p>The man adjusted himself to get more comfortable and accidentally bumped into Dan. &ldquo;Oops! I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan was temporarily thrown by the deep Northern accent that he spoke in. Being in LA, he expected someone American, though seeing as how it was a flight back to London, maybe he shouldn&rsquo;t have been.</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;S fine,&rdquo; he mumbled back, turning to face him.</p><p>It was the first time that Dan had gotten a good look at the stranger, and he suddenly wished that he had put more effort into his appearance when he&rsquo;d dragged himself out of his hotel this morning.</p><p>His outlet-mate was cute, the kind of cute that made it hard to focus on anything else. His eyes were a bright blue that reminded Dan of the beaches he&rsquo;d been visiting that week. They were framed by thick black Ray Ban style glasses and there was a smattering of freckles across his cheekbones, and Dan had an irrational thought about touching them to see if they were as soft as they looked.</p><p>&ldquo;Flight delayed?&rdquo; he asked, snapping Dan out of his reverie.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, uh, yeah. I imagine everyone&rsquo;s is.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Duh.&rdquo; He smacked himself in the head, probably harder than he intended, given how he knocked his glasses off and into Dan&rsquo;s lap.</p><p>Dan picked them up and handed them back gingerly, watching as the man&rsquo;s cheeks flushed a pretty pink color.</p><p>&ldquo;God, I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m a wreck today.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan shrugged, giving him a small smile. &ldquo;I think most people are when they travel.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I wish there was some traveling actually going on. I miss my bed.&rdquo;</p><p>It was an opening. Dan could continue the conversation with this cute stranger, but he hesitated. He had a very firm policy on not making small talk with people he didn&rsquo;t know, but there was something about this stranger. Maybe it was the blue of his eyes, or the way his smile stretched too wide across his face, but Dan took the bait.</p><p>&ldquo;Were you on holiday?&rdquo;</p><p>He looked almost relieved that Dan&rsquo;s replied, and his face brightened despite still looking tired.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes! My family decided to come to LA instead of Florida like we usually do. I was kinda disappointed because I was looking forward to going back to Harry Potter World, but I guess Disneyland is okay.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You like Harry Potter?&rdquo; It probably wasn&rsquo;t the point that he was trying to make, but Dan latched onto the first thing he was familiar with.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes! I&rsquo;ve seen the movies, but I never read the books.&rdquo; He shrugged like he hadn&rsquo;t just devastated Dan.</p><p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re one of <i>those</i> people.&rdquo;</p><p>It was a joke, but it was a risky one. Dan&rsquo;s tone never properly conveyed that he was joking, but he breathed a sigh of relief when the man grinned again.</p><p>&ldquo;At least I know what house I&rsquo;m in! You can still be a fan without reading the books.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan pursed his lips and he could tell his dimples were out, given the way that the stranger&rsquo;s eyes fell downward, and a subconscious smile pulled at Dan&rsquo;s lips.</p><p>&ldquo;I guess.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a purist, eh?&rdquo; He bumped their shoulders together, and under normal circumstances Dan would probably flinch, but this time he only felt the warmth of the stranger&rsquo;s arm and it just made him feel a small spark rather than anxiety.</p><p>&ldquo;I am. I&rsquo;m that terrible friend that insists on reading the book before I see the movie. I also refuse to watch any trailers before I see any movies. I&rsquo;m currently avoiding all social media so I don&rsquo;t get spoiled for the new Marvel movie.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god, I&rsquo;m so excited to see it!&rdquo;</p><p>Dan could feel his cheeks hurt from smiling; the muscles in his face were getting more use than they had in ages. &ldquo;I was supposed to see it when I got home, but&hellip;&rdquo; He gestured around to the terminal they were sitting in.</p><p>&ldquo;That sucks!&rdquo;</p><p>His phone chimed and his attention moved towards it, so Dan just nodded a bit even though he wasn&rsquo;t looking anymore and tried to find something on his own phone that could hold his attention as well as the man to his right had been.</p><p>-</p><p>In reality, it was only about 45 seconds from Dan looking down at his phone to the stranger nudging his shoulder gently to get his attention, but it felt like ages.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry about that.

Who cared about everyone else when Phil was smiling all big and proud at him?</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re crazy.&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t even bother trying to keep the fondness out of his voice.</p><p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s not a no,&rdquo; Phil said, nudging him.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, okay, but you don&rsquo;t gotta be all smug about it.&rdquo; Dan knocked their shoulders together and Phil leaned into the pressure.</p><p>There was a second where Dan almost leaned in. Phil&rsquo;s eyes were trained on him, and he thought that maybe Phil was going to lean forward, but then an announcement rang out over the speakers, snapping them out of the moment.</p><p>&ldquo;Flight BA1019 is now boarding. Please proceed to the departure gate.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I think that&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; Dan said, pulling his ticket out of his backpack.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me, too,&rdquo; Phil said brightly, and Dan felt that tingling, excited feeling in his tummy. The same feeling he&rsquo;d had since he started talking to Phil hours ago.</p><p>Their seats weren&rsquo;t anywhere close to each other, but knowing that Phil was there somewhere on the plane made the ten hour flight a little bit more bearable.</p><p>-</p><p>He wasn&rsquo;t entirely surprised to see Phil standing by the exit waiting for him, but he couldn&rsquo;t deny how happy it made him.</p><p>&ldquo;Good flight?&rdquo; Phil asked, slinging his backpack across his shoulders.</p><p>&ldquo;Long,&rdquo; Dan corrected, but he still smiled because he was finding it nearly impossible not to when he was near Phil. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready to sleep and not leave my bed for a year.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, me, too. I can never sleep on flights.&rdquo;</p><p>They were stood in front of the exit, Dan needing to go left and Phil&rsquo;s body facing right. It didn&rsquo;t seem quite right to leave, but there wasn&rsquo;t anything popping into his brain that would give him a good excuse for staying, so he gave an awkward wave and said he had to go.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Phil said.</p><p>They both twitched, as if they were both going in for hug, but neither did, so Dan took that as a sign and turned to leave.</p><p>He&rsquo;d only made it about ten feet when he heard heavy footsteps behind him and felt a hand on his arm. Turning quickly, he saw Phil, cheeks that sweet pink color.</p><p>&ldquo;Can I have your number? For, like, Buffy and stuff?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan was very curious what the &lsquo;stuff&rsquo; Phil was talking about was, but he just pulled out his phone and let Phil enter his number and then watched as Phil pulled out his own, saving the number from the text he&rsquo;d sent himself.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll text you,&rdquo; he said, handing Dan his phone back.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil moved forward and pressed a quick kiss to Dan&rsquo;s cheek; the same place where his dimple was currently making a crater on his face. He didn&rsquo;t have any time to say anything by the time that Phil was waving and moving toward his destination.</p><p>He wasn&rsquo;t sure how long he stood there, palm pressed to the spot that Phil had kissed, but when his body finally moved again, it was with a skip in his step and grin on his face.</p>",

His head hurt, he was sunburned, and he just desperately wanted to go home and sleep in his own bed.</p>\n<p>That wouldn&rsquo;t be possible for hours, or closer to a day, though. His flight home from LA was delayed due to inclement weather. Wasn&rsquo;t LA supposed to be all sun and fun and whatnot? It was stupid, and he was grumpy, and just desperately wanted to get home.</p>\n<p>An outlet opened up on the wall opposite his chair, and Dan sprinted to it as fast as his sore body would carry him. The woman he beat looked pissed, but he didn&rsquo;t care. Normally he was a pretty nice guy, but not when he&rsquo;d been out in the sun for a week straight and had no internet.</p>\n<p>He plugged his charger in, and when the Apple logo lit up his screen, he gave a deep sigh of relief. His therapist would probably lecture him on his addiction to technology, but his therapist was clear across the world, so he cradled his phone in his too large hands and sent out a &lsquo;thank you&rsquo; to the universe that at least <i>one</i> thing went right today.</p>\n</p>",
