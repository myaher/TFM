You were still exhausted from gym class as you had to\nrun around the football field. You could care less how people stared at you for\ndragging your backpack over the floor, but you were to exhausted to lift it up.\nThe cafeteria was crowed as you let your eyes go over every table. You were\nsighing deep as you didn\u2019t want to sit with strangers or alone at some distant\narea as suddenly you saw a familiar person lift it\u2019s head up from the crowd.</p><p>You frowned\nslightly when Peter Parker was holding his hand in the air to get your\nattention. Ned who sat next to Peter kept nudging him to pull his arm down as\nPeter seemed to be arguing with him while keeping his hand up. Seeing no other free\ntable, you picked up your backpack and placed it over your shoulder on your way\nto Peter\u2019s table. When you were near him he quickly pulled his tray closer to\nhim and moved Ned\u2019s backpack aside that laid on the table. You seated yourself\nin front of Peter as Ned looked terrified at him. When you weren\u2019t looking was\nPeter kicking Ned subtly to not look so scared like that. </p><!-- more --><p>The boys\nweren\u2019t used to have girls around them. Most of the time they spent together\ntalking about science and build Lego structures. \u2013 \u201cSo\u2026 Y/n\u2026\u201d \u2013 Peter started\nbut swallowed deep as you were looking at him. You slightly raised your eyebrow,\nwaiting for something more of a possible question as Peter chuckled nervously,\nwhile tugging at his sleeve. \u2013 \u201cWell I\u2019m going to get something to eat while\nyou might find your voice back?\u201d \u2013 You got up as Peter stuttered a bit and\nnodded quickly. As soon as you left slapped Ned hard against Peter\u2019s arm. \u2013 \u201cAu!\nWhat was that for?\u201d \u2013 Peter whined as he rubbed the pain area. </p><p>\u201cPerhaps\nfor asking a girl over to our table! I don\u2019t know how to act around girls?\u201d \u2013 Ned\ncalled out to Peter, trying not to raise his voice as Peter sighed deep, moving\nhis head towards Ned. \u2013 \u201cJust be yourself!\u201d \u2013 Ned gave Peter a questionable\nlook. \u2013 \u201cPeter, no girl wants to know the real us!\u201d \u2013 Peter wanted to explain\nto Ned that some girls would appreciate it as he noticed you arriving again. \u2013 \u201cSo,\ndid you find your voice back?\u201d \u2013 You joked as you seated yourself down and\ngrabbed your fork with some food on it. \u2013 \u201cOf course, Y/n!\u201d \u2013 Peter replied in\na steadier tone than before as you paused your fork for a moment as Peter thought\nyou were going to joke at him as you just smiled at him. When he exhaled subtle,\nPeter felt more at ease around you as you were enjoying your lunch. </p><p>When it was\ntime to head to class you said goodbye to them as you rushed away. Peter and\nNed followed you to class on a slower pace as they were talking exuberant about\nscience since they were too scared to talk about in front of you. They arrived\nin class a few moments before you as they seated themselves somewhere behind\nyou. You were sitting on the second row, with the blackboard as front view as\nyou were unpacking your backpack. Peter and Ned were whispering a bit as Peter\npulled out his laptop from his backpack. The teacher entered moments later as\nyou couldn\u2019t wait what kind of book you would need to read this time. You\nreally adored English as it widened your vision on books, you learned a lot of new\nbooks that you never knew you would love. </p><p>\u201cGood afternoon\nclass!\u201d \u2013 the teacher spoke as she placed her briefcase on her desk. Everyone\nstopped talking as they watched the teacher pull out several things out of her\nbriefcase. She was trying to hide her wide smile as she pulled out a small book\nand placed it behind her back. \u2013 \u201cClass, I have brought you a classic that I\nbelieve everyone will adore!\u201d \u2013 She said as she stood in the centre in front of\nthe blackboard. Slowly revealing the book from behind her she could see all off\nthe students leaning forward. \u2013 \u201cRomeo and Juliet!\u201d \u2013 she called out, trying to\nhide a squeal as some students loved the idea.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d \u2013 you\ncalled out frustrated as you groaned annoyed with your elbows resting on your\ndesk as you let your head fall on the desk together with your arms. Some\nstudents started laugh soft at your behaviour as the teacher looked at you with\nbig confused eyes. \u2013 \u201cI\u2019d thought you\u2019d like that, Y/n?\u201d \u2013 she asked you as you\nbanged your head softly against your desk. More students started to laugh as\nthey loved your little act of drama. \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s not that bad\u2026\u201d \u2013 the teacher said to\nease your thoughts as you lifted your head. \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s boring!\u201d \u2013 you whined out\nas the teacher gave you a questioning look. \u2013 \u201cRomeo and Juliet are the most popular\nstory about love, tragedy and longing for someone that you would risk anything\u2026\u201d\n</p><p>You rolled\nwith your eyes as you crossed your arms and leaned back in your chair. \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s\na story about two fools where one fool fakes her death because her family doesn\u2019t\nwant her to be with him!\u201d \u2013 you replied as you had no interest into reading\nthat boring story. \u2013 \u201cand I don\u2019t blame her as she was only 14 years old and\nclearly drunk on love that she didn\u2019t understand!\u201d \u2013 The teacher crossed her\narms slowly as she looked with a stern eye at you. \u2013 \u201cY/n, there is nothing\nwrong with having an opinion, but can you please stay respectful!\u201d \u2013 You nodded\nsoft with a sigh as the teacher was pleased with it for a moment. </p><p>The teacher\nthan continued to explain to everyone why Romeo and Juliette were so important\nto read. \u2013 \u201cWilliam Shakespeare was the greatest writer from that time as he gave\ntheatre a whole new meaning.\u201d \u2013 You rolled with your eyes as you disagreed with\nher. \u2013 \u201cShakespeare was a drama queen!\u201d \u2013 you joked as Peter snorted loud from\nyour comment, other students laughed loud as they were out of control. \u2013 \u201cAlright\ncalm down!\u201d \u2013 the teacher called out as she tried to calm down the laughing\nstudents. \u2013 \u201cIf you are such a hater against his work Y/n, you don\u2019t mind if I\nuse you for a little reading?\u201d \u2013 You sighed loud as the teacher signalled for\nyou to get up from your chair. </p><p>You got up\nand made your way over to the front as the teacher handed you a copy of the\nscript. You took it with a fake smile as she smiled full of mischief back at\nyou. \u2013 \u201cY/n you will play the role of Juliet!\u201d \u2013 the teacher called out as you\nlooked with a disgusted look at the funny lines in the script. \u2013 \u201cNow I just\nneed a Romeo\u2026\u201d \u2013 she said as she started to tap her finger against her chin, letting\nher eyes go over the boys in class. Peter was grinning at the teacher as a\nsmirk curled up with her. \u2013 \u201cPeter! You will be playing Romeo!\u201d \u2013 She pointed\nat Peter as he lowered the screen of his laptop. \u2013 \u201cYeah -yeah- sure\u2026\u201d \u2013 he stuttered\nas he jumped up and walked over to the front. </p><p>\u201cHey\u2026\u201d \u2013 he\nsaid nervous as he stood next to you, you gave him a smile back as the teacher\nhanded him a script of his own. The teacher than seated herself down at her\ndesk as she told you to start. You sighed loud as you opened the script and\nread the gibberish words. \u2013 \u201cAnytime now Y/n\u201d \u2013 the teacher called out as some\nstudents laughed soft, you looked brief over your shoulder as you gave her a\ndeath stare. With a sigh you started to read out the gibberish talk. \u2013 \u201cOh Romeo,\nRomeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and thy name\u2026\u201d \u2013 you said on a\nslow and annoyed tone as you rather not engaged in this stupid act. \u2013 \u201cTry to\nput more emotion into it, Y/n!\u201d \u2013 the teacher called out as you sighed even\nlouder and slapped your hand against the script. \u2013 \u201cThose lines are ridiculous!\nI mean who even speaks like that!\u201d </p><p>\u201cPeople in that\ntime area did, Y/n now continue please!\u201d \u2013 The teacher replied as she pointed\nat Peter to take the next few lines. \u2013 \u201cBy a name, I know not how to tell thee\nwho I am\u201d \u2013 Peter replied with some stumbling as he felt suddenly nervous\nstanding in front of the class. \u2013 \u201cO, speak again, bright angel! for thou art\u201d \u2013\nyou exaggerated as Peter chuckled soft. Hearing him laugh made you giggle loud as\nyou placed the script against your mouth to cover up your laughing. \u2013 \u201cPlease\ncontinue\u2026\u201d \u2013 the teacher called out as you removed the script from against you\nand started to read a few lines in your mind. </p><p>You were\nabout to open your mouth to say something stupid again as Peter suddenly pulled\nyour script a bit down with his finger, catching your attention. \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ll start\nagain\u2026\u201d \u2013 he said as you blinked a few times and let him continue. Peter cleared\nhis throat as he pretended to search for the right line in the script as he\nsuddenly started to speak. \u2013 \u201cMy heart beats for you and only you as you are\nthe fairest lady I have ever laid my eyes on\u2026\u201d \u2013 You gasped quietly as Peter\u2019s\nwords sounded so sincere. Peter continued as you felt yourself get lost in his\neyes. It was as Peter was everything you ever wanted as he made your heart skip\nbeats. \u2013 \u201cFrom the moment I first saw you I knew my heart belonged to you\u2026\u201d \u2013\nYou looked quickly down, flipping through the pages as you couldn\u2019t find\nanything from what Peter was saying. </p><p>Peter than in\nan act of bravery took your hand and pulled you closer to him, making you take\na few steps forward. He didn\u2019t let go of your hand as you could feel his thumb\nstroke your hand gently. \u2013 \u201cWe might have different eyes, but I know we both\nsee fine\u2026\u201d \u2013 all the students and the teacher were looking confused at each\nother as none of those line\u2019s were from the script. You swallowed soft as you\nfelt your whole-body tingle. Peter\u2019s words sounded like a poem straight from his\nheart as you squeezed his hand soft back. Peter than suddenly took another step\ncloser to you as he dropped the script on the ground and moved his hand towards\nyou. You gasped quietly again as he placed some hair of yours behind your ear,\nhis touch made your cheeks burn up. He then softly let his hand slide down your\ncheek till your chin as something inside of you blindly pushed your head closer\nto him. </p><p>The teacher\nsuddenly cleared her throat as you were leaning in for a kiss in front of class.\nPeter nervously smiled as he stopped talking, pulling his head back as he felt\neveryone stare at him. He briefly made eye contact with Ned who looked confused\nat him back. \u201cThat\u2026 that\u2026 was\u2026\u201d \u2013 the teacher started as she didn\u2019t know what\nto say as nothing came from the original script. \u2013 \u201cBeautiful\u2026\u201d \u2013 you finished as\nyou kept gazing into Peter\u2019s eyes. \u2013 \u201cThank you\u2026 Y/n\u2026\u201d \u2013 Peter stuttered\nnervous as he rubbed the back of his head with his hand. He noticed he was\nstill holding your hand, so he quickly pulled his away and took a step back. </p><p>\u201cThank you,\nPeter and Y/n\u2026\u201d \u2013 the teacher said when Peter walked back to his desk as you followed\nhis movements with love in your eyes. You seated yourself down seconds later as\nfor the resting time of class you hide your blushing face away. When the bell\nfinally rang you collected your supplies and rushed out of the classroom. Ned\nhad been nudging Peter the whole time for more information about what happened.\nPeter ignored his chatting as he jumped up and followed you through the crowd.\nHe followed you towards your locker as you were emptying your backpack. \u2013 \u201cHey\nthere Juliet!\u201d \u2013 Peter called out as he closed your locker door in front of\nyou, making you turn your attention to him. </p><p>You quickly\nopened your locker door again to hide your blushing face as you felt nervous\naround him. Peter walked around you as he came standing on the other side of\nyou. \u2013 \u201cPretty crazy huh\u2026\u201d \u2013 he started to say shy as you agreed with him. \u2013 \u201cDid\nyou mean it&hellip;\u201d \u2013 Peter looked with shock at you as he didn\u2019t expect the\nquestion. \u2013 \u201cI mean\u2026 it seemed to come from your heart and I \u2026 I must say it did\nsomething to me\u2026\u201d \u2013 You said soft, trying not to sound like fool. Peter laughed\nshy as he looked brief at the ground. \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ll tell you the truth over diner, how\ndoes that sound Juliet?\u201d \u2013 A smile appeared on your face as you were eager to spend\nmore time with him.

Most of the time they spent together\ntalking about science and build Lego structures. \u2013 \u201cSo\u2026 Y/n\u2026\u201d \u2013 Peter started\nbut swallowed deep as you were looking at him. You slightly raised your eyebrow,\nwaiting for something more of a possible question as Peter chuckled nervously,\nwhile tugging at his sleeve. \u2013 \u201cWell I\u2019m going to get something to eat while\nyou might find your voice back?\u201d \u2013 You got up as Peter stuttered a bit and\nnodded quickly. As soon as you left slapped Ned hard against Peter\u2019s arm. \u2013 \u201cAu!\nWhat was that for?\u201d \u2013 Peter whined as he rubbed the pain area. </p><p>\u201cPerhaps\nfor asking a girl over to our table! I don\u2019t know how to act around girls?\u201d \u2013 Ned\ncalled out to Peter, trying not to raise his voice as Peter sighed deep, moving\nhis head towards Ned. \u2013 \u201cJust be yourself!\u201d \u2013 Ned gave Peter a questionable\nlook. \u2013 \u201cPeter, no girl wants to know the real us!\u201d \u2013 Peter wanted to explain\nto Ned that some girls would appreciate it as he noticed you arriving again. \u2013 \u201cSo,\ndid you find your voice back?\u201d \u2013 You joked as you seated yourself down and\ngrabbed your fork with some food on it. \u2013 \u201cOf course, Y/n!\u201d \u2013 Peter replied in\na steadier tone than before as you paused your fork for a moment as Peter thought\nyou were going to joke at him as you just smiled at him. When he exhaled subtle,\nPeter felt more at ease around you as you were enjoying your lunch. </p><p>When it was\ntime to head to class you said goodbye to them as you rushed away. Peter and\nNed followed you to class on a slower pace as they were talking exuberant about\nscience since they were too scared to talk about in front of you. They arrived\nin class a few moments before you as they seated themselves somewhere behind\nyou. You were sitting on the second row, with the blackboard as front view as\nyou were unpacking your backpack. Peter and Ned were whispering a bit as Peter\npulled out his laptop from his backpack. The teacher entered moments later as\nyou couldn\u2019t wait what kind of book you would need to read this time. You\nreally adored English as it widened your vision on books, you learned a lot of new\nbooks that you never knew you would love. </p><p>\u201cGood afternoon\nclass!\u201d \u2013 the teacher spoke as she placed her briefcase on her desk. Everyone\nstopped talking as they watched the teacher pull out several things out of her\nbriefcase. She was trying to hide her wide smile as she pulled out a small book\nand placed it behind her back. \u2013 \u201cClass, I have brought you a classic that I\nbelieve everyone will adore!\u201d \u2013 She said as she stood in the centre in front of\nthe blackboard. Slowly revealing the book from behind her she could see all off\nthe students leaning forward. \u2013 \u201cRomeo and Juliet!\u201d \u2013 she called out, trying to\nhide a squeal as some students loved the idea.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d \u2013 you\ncalled out frustrated as you groaned annoyed with your elbows resting on your\ndesk as you let your head fall on the desk together with your arms. Some\nstudents started laugh soft at your behaviour as the teacher looked at you with\nbig confused eyes. \u2013 \u201cI\u2019d thought you\u2019d like that, Y/n?\u201d \u2013 she asked you as you\nbanged your head softly against your desk. More students started to laugh as\nthey loved your little act of drama. \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s not that bad\u2026\u201d \u2013 the teacher said to\nease your thoughts as you lifted your head. \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s boring!\u201d \u2013 you whined out\nas the teacher gave you a questioning look. \u2013 \u201cRomeo and Juliet are the most popular\nstory about love, tragedy and longing for someone that you would risk anything\u2026\u201d\n</p><p>You rolled\nwith your eyes as you crossed your arms and leaned back in your chair. \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s\na story about two fools where one fool fakes her death because her family doesn\u2019t\nwant her to be with him!\u201d \u2013 you replied as you had no interest into reading\nthat boring story. \u2013 \u201cand I don\u2019t blame her as she was only 14 years old and\nclearly drunk on love that she didn\u2019t understand!\u201d \u2013 The teacher crossed her\narms slowly as she looked with a stern eye at you. \u2013 \u201cY/n, there is nothing\nwrong with having an opinion, but can you please stay respectful!\u201d \u2013 You nodded\nsoft with a sigh as the teacher was pleased with it for a moment. </p><p>The teacher\nthan continued to explain to everyone why Romeo and Juliette were so important\nto read. \u2013 \u201cWilliam Shakespeare was the greatest writer from that time as he gave\ntheatre a whole new meaning.\u201d \u2013 You rolled with your eyes as you disagreed with\nher. \u2013 \u201cShakespeare was a drama queen!\u201d \u2013 you joked as Peter snorted loud from\nyour comment, other students laughed loud as they were out of control. \u2013 \u201cAlright\ncalm down!\u201d \u2013 the teacher called out as she tried to calm down the laughing\nstudents. \u2013 \u201cIf you are such a hater against his work Y/n, you don\u2019t mind if I\nuse you for a little reading?\u201d \u2013 You sighed loud as the teacher signalled for\nyou to get up from your chair. </p><p>You got up\nand made your way over to the front as the teacher handed you a copy of the\nscript. You took it with a fake smile as she smiled full of mischief back at\nyou. \u2013 \u201cY/n you will play the role of Juliet!\u201d \u2013 the teacher called out as you\nlooked with a disgusted look at the funny lines in the script. \u2013 \u201cNow I just\nneed a Romeo\u2026\u201d \u2013 she said as she started to tap her finger against her chin, letting\nher eyes go over the boys in class. Peter was grinning at the teacher as a\nsmirk curled up with her. \u2013 \u201cPeter! You will be playing Romeo!\u201d \u2013 She pointed\nat Peter as he lowered the screen of his laptop. \u2013 \u201cYeah -yeah- sure\u2026\u201d \u2013 he stuttered\nas he jumped up and walked over to the front. </p><p>\u201cHey\u2026\u201d \u2013 he\nsaid nervous as he stood next to you, you gave him a smile back as the teacher\nhanded him a script of his own. The teacher than seated herself down at her\ndesk as she told you to start. You sighed loud as you opened the script and\nread the gibberish words. \u2013 \u201cAnytime now Y/n\u201d \u2013 the teacher called out as some\nstudents laughed soft, you looked brief over your shoulder as you gave her a\ndeath stare. With a sigh you started to read out the gibberish talk. \u2013 \u201cOh Romeo,\nRomeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and thy name\u2026\u201d \u2013 you said on a\nslow and annoyed tone as you rather not engaged in this stupid act. \u2013 \u201cTry to\nput more emotion into it, Y/n!\u201d \u2013 the teacher called out as you sighed even\nlouder and slapped your hand against the script. \u2013 \u201cThose lines are ridiculous!\nI mean who even speaks like that!\u201d </p><p>\u201cPeople in that\ntime area did, Y/n now continue please!\u201d \u2013 The teacher replied as she pointed\nat Peter to take the next few lines. \u2013 \u201cBy a name, I know not how to tell thee\nwho I am\u201d \u2013 Peter replied with some stumbling as he felt suddenly nervous\nstanding in front of the class. \u2013 \u201cO, speak again, bright angel! for thou art\u201d \u2013\nyou exaggerated as Peter chuckled soft. Hearing him laugh made you giggle loud as\nyou placed the script against your mouth to cover up your laughing. \u2013 \u201cPlease\ncontinue\u2026\u201d \u2013 the teacher called out as you removed the script from against you\nand started to read a few lines in your mind. </p><p>You were\nabout to open your mouth to say something stupid again as Peter suddenly pulled\nyour script a bit down with his finger, catching your attention. \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ll start\nagain\u2026\u201d \u2013 he said as you blinked a few times and let him continue. Peter cleared\nhis throat as he pretended to search for the right line in the script as he\nsuddenly started to speak. \u2013 \u201cMy heart beats for you and only you as you are\nthe fairest lady I have ever laid my eyes on\u2026\u201d \u2013 You gasped quietly as Peter\u2019s\nwords sounded so sincere. Peter continued as you felt yourself get lost in his\neyes. It was as Peter was everything you ever wanted as he made your heart skip\nbeats. \u2013 \u201cFrom the moment I first saw you I knew my heart belonged to you\u2026\u201d \u2013\nYou looked quickly down, flipping through the pages as you couldn\u2019t find\nanything from what Peter was saying. </p><p>Peter than in\nan act of bravery took your hand and pulled you closer to him, making you take\na few steps forward. He didn\u2019t let go of your hand as you could feel his thumb\nstroke your hand gently. \u2013 \u201cWe might have different eyes, but I know we both\nsee fine\u2026\u201d \u2013 all the students and the teacher were looking confused at each\nother as none of those line\u2019s were from the script. You swallowed soft as you\nfelt your whole-body tingle. Peter\u2019s words sounded like a poem straight from his\nheart as you squeezed his hand soft back. Peter than suddenly took another step\ncloser to you as he dropped the script on the ground and moved his hand towards\nyou. You gasped quietly again as he placed some hair of yours behind your ear,\nhis touch made your cheeks burn up. He then softly let his hand slide down your\ncheek till your chin as something inside of you blindly pushed your head closer\nto him. </p><p>The teacher\nsuddenly cleared her throat as you were leaning in for a kiss in front of class.\nPeter nervously smiled as he stopped talking, pulling his head back as he felt\neveryone stare at him. He briefly made eye contact with Ned who looked confused\nat him back. \u201cThat\u2026 that\u2026 was\u2026\u201d \u2013 the teacher started as she didn\u2019t know what\nto say as nothing came from the original script. \u2013 \u201cBeautiful\u2026\u201d \u2013 you finished as\nyou kept gazing into Peter\u2019s eyes. \u2013 \u201cThank you\u2026 Y/n\u2026\u201d \u2013 Peter stuttered\nnervous as he rubbed the back of his head with his hand. He noticed he was\nstill holding your hand, so he quickly pulled his away and took a step back. </p><p>\u201cThank you,\nPeter and Y/n\u2026\u201d \u2013 the teacher said when Peter walked back to his desk as you followed\nhis movements with love in your eyes. You seated yourself down seconds later as\nfor the resting time of class you hide your blushing face away. When the bell\nfinally rang you collected your supplies and rushed out of the classroom. Ned\nhad been nudging Peter the whole time for more information about what happened.\nPeter ignored his chatting as he jumped up and followed you through the crowd.\nHe followed you towards your locker as you were emptying your backpack. \u2013 \u201cHey\nthere Juliet!\u201d \u2013 Peter called out as he closed your locker door in front of\nyou, making you turn your attention to him. </p><p>You quickly\nopened your locker door again to hide your blushing face as you felt nervous\naround him. Peter walked around you as he came standing on the other side of\nyou. \u2013 \u201cPretty crazy huh\u2026\u201d \u2013 he started to say shy as you agreed with him. \u2013 \u201cDid\nyou mean it\u2026\u201d \u2013 Peter looked with shock at you as he didn\u2019t expect the\nquestion. \u2013 \u201cI mean\u2026 it seemed to come from your heart and I \u2026 I must say it did\nsomething to me\u2026\u201d \u2013 You said soft, trying not to sound like fool. Peter laughed\nshy as he looked brief at the ground. \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ll tell you the truth over diner, how\ndoes that sound Juliet?\u201d \u2013 A smile appeared on your face as you were eager to spend\nmore time with him. You could feel yourself explode with love for him as you\naccepted his offer. \u2013 \u201cI would love to my Romeo\u2026\u201d </p><p>Peter went\nover the details with you as he then said goodbye to you. You waved him shy goodbye\nas you closed your locker door and let yourself lovingly slide down to the\nground as you couldn\u2019t wait to go on a date with him. </p><hr><p>\n\nCheck out my <b><a href=\"https://frost-queen.tumblr.com/post/175583277876/masterlist\" target=\"_blank\">Masterlist</a></b> for more Marvel imagine\u2019s \n\n<br></p>",

When you were near him he quickly pulled his tray closer to\nhim and moved Ned\u2019s backpack aside that laid on the table. You seated yourself\nin front of Peter as Ned looked terrified at him. When you weren\u2019t looking was\nPeter kicking Ned subtly to not look so scared like that. </p>[[MORE]]<p>The boys\nweren\u2019t used to have girls around them.

You seated yourself down seconds later as\nfor the resting time of class you hide your blushing face away. When the bell\nfinally rang you collected your supplies and rushed out of the classroom. Ned\nhad been nudging Peter the whole time for more information about what happened.\nPeter ignored his chatting as he jumped up and followed you through the crowd.\nHe followed you towards your locker as you were emptying your backpack. &ndash; &ldquo;Hey\nthere Juliet!&rdquo; &ndash; Peter called out as he closed your locker door in front of\nyou, making you turn your attention to him. </p><p>You quickly\nopened your locker door again to hide your blushing face as you felt nervous\naround him. Peter walked around you as he came standing on the other side of\nyou. &ndash; &ldquo;Pretty crazy huh&hellip;&rdquo; &ndash; he started to say shy as you agreed with him. &ndash; &ldquo;Did\nyou mean it&hellip;&rdquo; &ndash; Peter looked with shock at you as he didn&rsquo;t expect the\nquestion. &ndash; &ldquo;I mean&hellip; it seemed to come from your heart and I &hellip; I must say it did\nsomething to me&hellip;&rdquo; &ndash; You said soft, trying not to sound like fool. Peter laughed\nshy as he looked brief at the ground. &ndash; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you the truth over diner, how\ndoes that sound Juliet?&rdquo; &ndash; A smile appeared on your face as you were eager to spend\nmore time with him. You could feel yourself explode with love for him as you\naccepted his offer. &ndash; &ldquo;I would love to my Romeo&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>Peter went\nover the details with you as he then said goodbye to you. You waved him shy goodbye\nas you closed your locker door and let yourself lovingly slide down to the\nground as you couldn&rsquo;t wait to go on a date with him. </p><hr /><p>\n\nCheck out my <b><a href=\"https://frost-queen.tumblr.com/post/175583277876/masterlist\" target=\"_blank\">Masterlist</a></b> for more Marvel imagine&rsquo;s \n\n<br /></p>",

You were still exhausted from gym class as you had to\nrun around the football field. You could care less how people stared at you for\ndragging your backpack over the floor, but you were to exhausted to lift it up.\nThe cafeteria was crowed as you let your eyes go over every table. You were\nsighing deep as you didn&rsquo;t want to sit with strangers or alone at some distant\narea as suddenly you saw a familiar person lift it&rsquo;s head up from the crowd.</p>\n<p>You frowned\nslightly when Peter Parker was holding his hand in the air to get your\nattention. Ned who sat next to Peter kept nudging him to pull his arm down as\nPeter seemed to be arguing with him while keeping his hand up. Seeing no other free\ntable, you picked up your backpack and placed it over your shoulder on your way\nto Peter&rsquo;s table. When you were near him he quickly pulled his tray closer to\nhim and moved Ned&rsquo;s backpack aside that laid on the table. You seated yourself\nin front of Peter as Ned looked terrified at him. When you weren&rsquo;t looking was\nPeter kicking Ned subtly to not look so scared like that. </p>\n</p>",
