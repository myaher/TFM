She does love Sansa, and she does understand her. She used to cry herself to sleep because of how sad she was for her character that went through such a hard and terrible journey. Not just that, but many of you don\u2019t understand that Sophie was a teenage girl. She would watch all of the other major actresses get celebrated and lauded for portraying these other types of female characters whereas she, who played a character who found her strength in her femininity, was often ignored and simply didn\u2019t receive a warm reception. She wanted to feel validated. She wanted to see this character that she is so attached to be respected by the fans. Even when she was jealous, she still loved Sansa, she still saw her as a powerful character, and understood what made her strong. When she got older, she understood that so many people ignored her character because for them, a strong female character was one who would swing a sword mass murder and physically be very strong. She even called people out on that, and stated that they should also cheer for the female characters that wear dresses and are instead emotionally and intellectually very strong like Sansa. Yes scenes like Ramsey\u2019s death and Littlefinger\u2019s execution had people praise Sansa because she did something that fit more with strength linked to traditional masculinity, but with that being said, it\u2019s clear that Sophie doesn\u2019t just appreciate these moments when it comes to Sansa\u2019s character, but the whole kaleidoscope that is Sansa, and that very much includes the moments in the earlier seasons where her strength lied in the fact that she never compromised her identity, her motivation to live or her morals because of the abuse she suffered.

They really thought Sansa was a side character because they can\u2019t imagine a girl like her being important and so they\u2019re throwing temper tantrums.</p>",

It has nothing to do with the fact that I am a die-hard, stripped to the bone Arya/Gendry shipper (OK, maybe a little bit of that) or that Sansa and Tyrion are my third favorite pairing (and a wee bit of this) on the show. Mostly, it\u2019s because it&rsquo;s not fair to Gendry. Look, I get that Gendry is not an &ldquo;important&rdquo; character. He falls in the tertiary supporting character category, but I love him. He&rsquo;s actually my fourth favorite character in the entire series; I literally love every single moment that guy is on screen.</p><p>And frankly, the idea of Gendry with Sansa is insulting to Gendry. No, not because Sansa is this terrible character, because she&rsquo;s not. But she&rsquo;d be terrible to and for Gendry. Randomly deciding that Gendry would hook up with Sansa just shows a complete disregard for HIS character. Nothing about Sansa would appeal to who HE is, his upbringing, his life and what has shaped HIM as a person. Everyone (and let&rsquo;s be honest, it&rsquo;s mostly Sansa fans who just want to see her get a handsome, good guy) who thinks of pairing these two up is *only* thinking of Sansa. They aren&rsquo;t thinking of Gendry! They clearly haven&rsquo;t a clue of who this guy really is and what he has been through.</p><p>- Gendry does not like highborns because whenever they come around, he gets screwed over. He gets sold, threatened, lied to, nearly killed, kidnapped, almost eaten alive by a rat, living in fear of death every day, kidnapped (again), sold (again), raped*, and almost burned alive. This all happened whenever he was introduced to a Lord or Lady. (Except Arya, but of course, he wasn&rsquo;t introduced to her as a Lady&hellip; he knew her well before then.)</p><p>* Yes, it may have started out nicely for him, but what Melisandre did to him was rape. She took advantage of a naive, awestruck virgin boy who&rsquo;d never seen a naked woman before and in about ten seconds flat had him naked and on his back. In not much more than a minute after that, she had him tied up against his will, scared out of his mind and begging her to let him go before putting leeches on his body, including his privates. Flip the scenario, imagine that Melisandre is a man, and Gendry a girl. Pretty obviously rape, isn&rsquo;t it?</p><p>And, no, just because Gendry went through this situation doesn&rsquo;t mean that he would *understand* what Sansa went through. What she went through was about a thousand times worse and were Gendry EVER try to console her by comparing the two it would be just the worst. So Gendry never would because Gendry is the BEST!</p><p>- Gendry hasn&rsquo;t had the best experiences with redheads. See * above.</p><p>- Gendry *may* be the son of Robert Baratheon, but he&rsquo;s also a bastard. However, he&rsquo;s not a bastard like Jon Snow who was raised by a noble family. Gendry was raised in the slums of King&rsquo;s Landing, an orphan of Flea Bottom. Contrary to fandom&rsquo;s determination to give him the surname of &ldquo;Waters,&rdquo; he doesn&rsquo;t actually *have* a surname. He&rsquo;s JUST Gendry because only bastards who have been acknowledged by their fathers have surnames. Gendry is not Gendry Waters anymore than he is Gendry Baratheon. He&rsquo;s just Gendry. He&rsquo;s a bastard from Flea Bottom with no highborn manners or training.</p><p>Gendry is someone that Sansa Stark would NEVER, EVER see herself with unless absolutely forced to be with. Why? Because he is a bastard from Flea Bottom with no highborn manners or training. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how blue his eyes are or how great his abs are or how hot he is. She wouldn&rsquo;t even notice him to see the blue, the abs, the hot. Sansa is not the same spoiled, vain girl she was in the early seasons, but she&rsquo;s still a Lady and a Lady does not notice, does not fraternize with bastards from Flea Bottom. THAT is something that Arya does&hellip; Arya fraternizes with EVERYBODY, the servants, the butcher&rsquo;s boys, the bastards.</p><p>Gendry is hot, yeah&hellip; but nothing at ALL in his character in any way, shape or form narratively makes sense for him and Sansa. For either character. Not for her, and definitely not for him. </p><p>Gendry and Arya, on the other hand&hellip; well, they have a history, they have a love song, they&rsquo;ve endured hardships together, Arya is the only nobleperson that Gendry has had good experiences with precisely because she doesn&rsquo;t act like a nobleperson.</p><p>So, TLDR&hellip; before people start randomly shipping Sansa with random good-looking guys on the show, at least know that character&rsquo;s history first and whether or not it would actually, you know, make any fucking sense. In Gendry&rsquo;s case&hellip; it emphatically DOES NOT!</p>",

Gendry was raised in the slums of King\u2019s Landing, an orphan of Flea Bottom. Contrary to fandom\u2019s determination to give him the surname of \u201cWaters,\u201d he doesn\u2019t actually *have* a surname.

He\u2019s a bastard from Flea Bottom with no highborn manners or training.</p><p>Gendry is someone that Sansa Stark would NEVER, EVER see herself with unless absolutely forced to be with. Why? Because he is a bastard from Flea Bottom with no highborn manners or training. It doesn\u2019t matter how blue his eyes are or how great his abs are or how hot he is. She wouldn\u2019t even notice him to see the blue, the abs, the hot. Sansa is not the same spoiled, vain girl she was in the early seasons, but she\u2019s still a Lady and a Lady does not notice, does not fraternize with bastards from Flea Bottom. THAT is something that Arya does\u2026 Arya fraternizes with EVERYBODY, the servants, the butcher\u2019s boys, the bastards.</p><p>Gendry is hot, yeah\u2026 but nothing at ALL in his character in any way, shape or form narratively makes sense for him and Sansa. For either character. Not for her, and definitely not for him. </p><p>Gendry and Arya, on the other hand\u2026 well, they have a history, they have a love song, they\u2019ve endured hardships together, Arya is the only nobleperson that Gendry has had good experiences with precisely because she doesn\u2019t act like a nobleperson.</p><p>So, TLDR\u2026 before people start randomly shipping Sansa with random good-looking guys on the show, at least know that character\u2019s history first and whether or not it would actually, you know, make any fucking sense.

She took advantage of a naive, awestruck virgin boy who\u2019d never seen a naked woman before and in about ten seconds flat had him naked and on his back. In not much more than a minute after that, she had him tied up against his will, scared out of his mind and begging her to let him go before putting leeches on his body, including his privates.
