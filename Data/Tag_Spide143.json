Parker x Reader story but here we are. :D It\u2019s been forever since I wrote a fanfic.\u00a0</p><p>Just heads up, this one is sad. :(\u00a0</p><p>While mourning the divorce between him and MJ, he leans on you, his friend and new neighbor (you live right above him in an apartment building). Through this challenging time, you provide him all he needs: food, distraction, hugs, a shoulder to cry on, etc. He is very thankful for what you\u2019ve done and doesn\u2019t hold back on showing gratitude. He expresses his appreciation in multiple ways, from warm smiles to ice cream. </p><p>To gentle kisses. </p><p>It\u2019s not like you planned on hooking up with him. As cliche as it sounds, it just sorta happened. It started off as another night of him at your place, watching a movie with you on the couch and lamenting his split up with MJ. Through all this, his hand lingered near yours. A scary scene pops up on the film you are watching and your fingers instantly intertwine with his. It was as if on instinct. Hand holding lead to resting your head on his shoulder, which led to placing a soft kiss on your forehead. Which lead to one on your cheek, then one on your lips. It started off tame. Both sets of lips were closed. The longer it lasted, the more intense it became. Mouths opened and tongues were used. His hands wandered from your shoulders to your waist. You felt him gently press you down. Now that he\u2019s on top of you, he started kissing your neck and made his way down to your shoulder. Your fingers slid under his shirt and his did the same. </p><p>You both eventually moved to the bedroom. </p><p>The next morning, you hazily wake up to find him snoring next to you. The warm sunshine cascaded across his sleeping figure. It made him look heavenly. His arm was wrapped around you protectively. Though your hair was a mess and you had no makeup, you didn\u2019t care. In this moment, you felt secure and serene. </p><p>Something deep within you warned you not to get too close, not to fall in love. But it was too late. You\u2019ve been crushing on him for a little while now. Not since you met him, but for a couple weeks for sure. You certainly didn\u2019t feel like a rebound. You\u2019ve, unfortunately, been one before and that guy made a move on you right after his break up. He only cared about getting what he wanted and nothing more. As soon as he landed a new girlfriend, you were quickly forgotten. \u00a0Peter was not like that. He cherished you. He liked spending time with you. He was there for you just as much as you were there for him. Maybe, just maybe, he started having feelings for you, too. </p><p>Your thoughts were interrupted by a loud yawn. Groggily, he opened his eyes. Once he saw you, a content smile spread across his face. A small peck was planted on your cheek.</p><p>\u201cGood morning.\u201d he murmured. </p><p>Days, then weeks, pass. You two continue whatever relationship you had. Neither one of you bothered to put a label on it. You wanted to, but thought claiming the title of \u201cgirlfriend\u201d would be too much for Peter. After all, he was still reeling from his divorce. It was best to take things slow. So, you both laughed like friends and kissed like lovers. And that was fine because you were so madly in love that you were sure he felt the same. You hoped that one day you could become more than friends with benefits. </p><p>Then, he just disappeared. He was gone for a couple of days. His absence scared you. <i>Where is he? Is he safe? Did someone take him? Will he be okay?</i> These worries were irrational because you knew he could take care of himself. He was able to stay cool and collected even in the most terrifying of circumstances. Adding onto that, he was incredibly strong and fast. He\u2019d be okay.</p><p>Sure enough, he texted you once he returned. He went on and on about being at some sort of family gathering and meeting a whole bunch of people that were so alike him and how the experience changed him.</p><p>And then he broke the news that he was going to rekindle his romance with MJ. </p><p>You felt your heart plummet. He said that being with his family made him realize that he does want to have kids, that he does have more of a fathering instinct than he initially thought. </p><p>You didn\u2019t text back. </p><p>He sent many more messages and even tried to call. You didn\u2019t answer any of them. Instead, you turned off your phone and shut yourself indoors. You felt dumb, naive even, for thinking you two would be anything more than friends. </p><p>During your moping, you heard a banging at the door. You groaned out of frustration and dragged yourself over to see who was there. Sure enough, it was him. He looked worried.</p><p>\u201cWhere were you?!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cI\u2019ve been calling and texting you for days now!\u201d</p><p><i>Play it cool. Don\u2019t let him know you are upset.</i> That\u2019s you told yourself. </p><p>\u201cOh, you know, just&hellip;been busy. I, uh, have been feeling kind of sick lately so I\u2019ve been working from home.\u201d you said, avoiding eye contact. </p><p>\u201c&hellip;Are you upset about-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I\u2019ve been WORKING, Peter.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cRight, right.

Parker x Reader story but here we are. :D It\u2019s been forever since I wrote a fanfic.\u00a0</p><p>Just heads up, this one is sad. :(\u00a0</p><p>While mourning the divorce between him and MJ, he leans on you, his friend and new neighbor (you live right above him in an apartment building). Through this challenging time, you provide him all he needs: food, distraction, hugs, a shoulder to cry on, etc. He is very thankful for what you\u2019ve done and doesn\u2019t hold back on showing gratitude. He expresses his appreciation in multiple ways, from warm smiles to ice cream. </p><p>To gentle kisses. </p><p>It\u2019s not like you planned on hooking up with him. As cliche as it sounds, it just sorta happened. It started off as another night of him at your place, watching a movie with you on the couch and lamenting his split up with MJ. Through all this, his hand lingered near yours. A scary scene pops up on the film you are watching and your fingers instantly intertwine with his. It was as if on instinct. Hand holding lead to resting your head on his shoulder, which led to placing a soft kiss on your forehead. Which lead to one on your cheek, then one on your lips. It started off tame. Both sets of lips were closed. The longer it lasted, the more intense it became. Mouths opened and tongues were used. His hands wandered from your shoulders to your waist. You felt him gently press you down. Now that he\u2019s on top of you, he started kissing your neck and made his way down to your shoulder. Your fingers slid under his shirt and his did the same. </p><p>You both eventually moved to the bedroom. </p><p>The next morning, you hazily wake up to find him snoring next to you. The warm sunshine cascaded across his sleeping figure. It made him look heavenly. His arm was wrapped around you protectively. Though your hair was a mess and you had no makeup, you didn\u2019t care. In this moment, you felt secure and serene. </p><p>Something deep within you warned you not to get too close, not to fall in love. But it was too late. You\u2019ve been crushing on him for a little while now. Not since you met him, but for a couple weeks for sure. You certainly didn\u2019t feel like a rebound. You\u2019ve, unfortunately, been one before and that guy made a move on you right after his break up. He only cared about getting what he wanted and nothing more. As soon as he landed a new girlfriend, you were quickly forgotten. \u00a0Peter was not like that. He cherished you. He liked spending time with you. He was there for you just as much as you were there for him. Maybe, just maybe, he started having feelings for you, too. </p><p>Your thoughts were interrupted by a loud yawn. Groggily, he opened his eyes. Once he saw you, a content smile spread across his face. A small peck was planted on your cheek.</p><p>\u201cGood morning.\u201d he murmured. </p><p>Days, then weeks, pass. You two continue whatever relationship you had. Neither one of you bothered to put a label on it. You wanted to, but thought claiming the title of \u201cgirlfriend\u201d would be too much for Peter. After all, he was still reeling from his divorce. It was best to take things slow. So, you both laughed like friends and kissed like lovers. And that was fine because you were so madly in love that you were sure he felt the same. You hoped that one day you could become more than friends with benefits. </p><p>Then, he just disappeared. He was gone for a couple of days. His absence scared you. <i>Where is he? Is he safe? Did someone take him? Will he be okay?</i> These worries were irrational because you knew he could take care of himself. He was able to stay cool and collected even in the most terrifying of circumstances. Adding onto that, he was incredibly strong and fast. He\u2019d be okay.</p><p>Sure enough, he texted you once he returned. He went on and on about being at some sort of family gathering and meeting a whole bunch of people that were so alike him and how the experience changed him.</p><p>And then he broke the news that he was going to rekindle his romance with MJ. </p><p>You felt your heart plummet. He said that being with his family made him realize that he does want to have kids, that he does have more of a fathering instinct than he initially thought. </p><p>You didn\u2019t text back. </p><p>He sent many more messages and even tried to call. You didn\u2019t answer any of them. Instead, you turned off your phone and shut yourself indoors. You felt dumb, naive even, for thinking you two would be anything more than friends. </p><p>During your moping, you heard a banging at the door. You groaned out of frustration and dragged yourself over to see who was there. Sure enough, it was him. He looked worried.</p><p>\u201cWhere were you?!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cI\u2019ve been calling and texting you for days now!\u201d</p><p><i>Play it cool. Don\u2019t let him know you are upset.</i> That\u2019s you told yourself. </p><p>\u201cOh, you know, just\u2026been busy. I, uh, have been feeling kind of sick lately so I\u2019ve been working from home.\u201d you said, avoiding eye contact. </p><p>\u201c\u2026Are you upset about-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I\u2019ve been WORKING, Peter.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cRight, right. Sorry.\u201d He turned to leave, but stopped. \u201cLook, you\u2019re my closest friend. If\u2026you ever want to talk, just know I\u2019m here.\u201d Then he was gone.</p><p><i>You\u2019re the last person I ever want to talk to</i>. You shut the door.</p></p>",
