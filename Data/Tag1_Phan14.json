No. That\u2019s a lie. It has been over ten years in the making. Even since he first found out that he was at least partially that gay thing that everybody kept calling him from a young age. It had always been heading to this, ever since he stepped on the path alongside Phil and started to build an online audience.</p><p>He had tried to hide from it from a long time, especially when the pressure got too much and the questions became too invasive. He wasn\u2019t proud of some of the stuff he\u2019d done back then but it had taken him so horrendously long to shred the internalised oppression. He wasn\u2019t even sure if he\u2019d fully stepped out from under its shadow. </p><p>But yesterday had been an important day and it had been the biggest leap he had ever taken in this regard. He pulled up his phone now, looking at the notes on his phone and the little video idea. It had been sitting there for years and he had almost considered making it last year but the timing hadn\u2019t been right. He had still been too scared.</p><p>Just looking at the little note, starting off with <i>coming out</i>had used to chill his bones. At times, he\u2019d become so paranoid that he\u2019d rephrased it so it wasn\u2019t so obvious just if worst case happened and someone got their hands on his phone. He\u2019d changed it back eventually, ones the paranoid was during its low tide.</p><p>He could officially delete it off the list of video ideas. It was done. It had taken so long to produce and it had been an emotional labour more than anything else. It had taken everything out of him. On the day that he\u2019d filmed it, he\u2019d collapsed into Phil\u2019s arms afterwards, seeking comfort and reassurance which he was awarded in bundles.</p><p>Phil was beside him every step of the way, just like he\u2019d always been ever since they met and Dan knew he wouldn\u2019t have been strong enough to do this if it hadn\u2019t been for the man that he considered his companion through life. Phil had saved his life, again and again, and Dan would not be who he was today if it hadn\u2019t been for the kind-hearted man.</p><p>Dan had been anxious on his own behalf but he\u2019d also been scared on Phil\u2019s. He couldn\u2019t tell his story without revealing the worst kept secret in the fandom that revolved around them. People had known without <i>knowing</i>for years. He knew some people would come out with a <i>we been knew</i>and it had pissed him off pre-emptively. He hoped that addressing the toxicity of such a statement within the video would help to curb it.</p><p>Phil had entirely trusted him to tell the story of them. He had trusted him to phrase it in a way that represented them and their wishes and his trusting eyes and firm hand had never wavered. Dan had placed his heart in Phil\u2019s hands so long ago, nearly ten years now, and he had gotten a heart in return for his own. He had never treated anything with as much care as he did Phil\u2019s heart.</p><p>He knew it was the most important thing he would ever be allowed to hold and he treated it as such. Through their consensual banter, inside jokes, gentle touches, constant reassurance and domestic happiness.</p><p>He had been allowed to break Phil\u2019s coming out indirectly. However, Dan had to admit that the tweet that followed was funny and just so Phil. Phil had been grinning, tongue poking out of his teeth as he\u2019d shown it do Dan. It was lowkey, humorous but also honest. It was Phil in a nutshell.</p><p>Dan had needed the long video, bloody hell it had ended up at 45 minutes, and Phil could do it in just a tweet. Dan had always been the rambler of the two and Phil was more often than not content to just say his piece, concisely and leave it at that. They were different but they complimented each other.</p><p>\u201cDid you even sleep last night?\u201d Phil asked with a yawn. </p><p>Dan rolled over in bed to face Phil.</p><p>\u201cI think I passed out at some point. Maybe?\u201d he said with a chuckle and his voice was heavy with sleep.</p><p>He had entirely too much adrenalin in his system last night to go even remotely early to bed. He had been dipping in and out of various social media sites to gauge everyone\u2019s reaction. On some logical level, he\u2019d tried to tell himself that it would be fine. He\u2019d seen how other online creators was accepted and embraced when they\u2019d come out but it didn\u2019t take away from the fact that this was still special and important to him.</p><p>It was his coming out and no matter how many people had done it before him, none had quite had his experiences and either way, this was a huge potentially life altering thing <i>for him</i>to do. He\u2019d tackled his family, just last month, and how he was laying himself bare and vulnerable for essentially the whole world.</p><p>But the video wasn\u2019t specifically to the whole world, even if he knew that anyone with an internet connection could see it. He\u2019d learned that lesson the hard way years ago. It was to his audience first and foremost and secondarily to the people who would come later looking for reassurance. They were the people who\u2019d shown him that it would be a safe space for him to finally come out and everything around him had reinforced it again and again. At almost every Interactive Introverts show, he\u2019d seen pride flags and he\u2019s posed with many of them at the meet and greets and signed even more. Every time he\u2019d seen one or touched it, he\u2019d felt his heart soar a little. Dan and Phil had always wanted to create a safe and accepting community but witnessing it with his own eyes and hearing the personal stories had brought it to life in a different way.</p><p>The community, his fellow creators and the people who watched his content had become a bit like a family to him. Maybe that was why he had chosen to repeat the same line as the one he\u2019d used in that cringy email to his family.</p><p>Basically, I\u2019m gay.</p><p>It felt good to say it. He was still a little scared of the word. It was conditioned too deeply in him for it to completely disappear, even when the support and love was pouring in from every corner. But it was feeling less scary every time he said it, like he took the bad meaning away just by uttering it with confidence and reclaiming it for himself.</p><p>\u201cSo? How does it feel?\u201d Phil asked and reached over to rub Dan\u2019s back and Dan wondered how long he\u2019d gone silent as he\u2019d retreated into his own head again. It wasn\u2019t like Phil wasn\u2019t used to it.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing here, queer and filled with existential fear?\u201d Phil said in a joking voice and nudge Dan a little almost titling him over in their shared bed.</p><p>Dan barked out a laugh and shoved Phil back, phone forgotten as it landed amongst the duvets. He pushed over his partner until they were both lying on their sides and then he wrapped his arms around Phil, almost burrowing into him.</p><p>\u201cI could ask you too, you know,\u201d he mumbled into the warm expanse of Phil\u2019s neck, comforted by the familiar sense and the strong and warm arms that pulled him tighter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling particularly gay this morning,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>Dan chuckled, knowing what was coming, and Phil\u2019s fingers ran over his ribs. A little jab that made Dan\u2019s heart sing in his chest.</p><p>\u201cGay as in happy, of course,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say, language major,\u201d Dan said.</p><p>But he thought it was very appropriate that gay could also mean happy. He didn\u2019t used to think so. When it was used as a slur and repeated as he took the abuse growing up, he had hated it. He felt like the word was taunting him, claiming that it could mean something good, something jolly when it caused him so much fear and pain. It had almost been responsible for pushing him past an edge he couldn\u2019t return from. </p><p>He had never felt happy to be any bit gay. He\u2019d felt miserable and furious. He had begged to be anything but when he\u2019d been younger. </p><p>But this morning, the morning after coming out to the whole world, he started to accept the other meaning of the word. He was wrapped up in the loving embrace of his actual soulmate, who he had been lucky enough to have in his life for nearly ten years and he hoped they would have each other until they were old, grey and sitting in matching chairs in a nursery home.</p><p>He closed his eyes and recalled all the loving words, the praise for the video that he\u2019d worked so hard for and the overwhelming support that he might have been able to foresee but he hadn\u2019t been able to tell how all of it would make him feel.</p><p>It made him feel warm. It made him feel loved. It made him feel gay.</p><p>Phil started to hum under his breath as he gently trailed his fingers over Dan\u2019s shoulder. Domestic scenes like this had only been a faraway fantasy when Dan had still been in school. He\u2019d see it in movies, between straight couples, and his heart would break because he thought he could never have this. </p><p>When he\u2019d first started seeing Phil, with all that horrible distance between them, he\u2019d lapped up every single domestic moment and committed them to memory. He hadn\u2019t been sure if he\u2019d ever get another. Now, he had so many more than he could even count. Every single day he felt the easy domestic life with Phil but he often had to just pause for a beat to appreciate it. Now was one of those moments and Dan could feel it imprinting on his mind.</p><p>The day after they both came out to the world, they were in bed, lying close as their breaths synched to each other like old friends falling into the familiar step. Dan was almost sure that his and Phil\u2019s heartbeats had learned to beat in perfect unison. </p><p>Soulmates were a ridiculous concept. It was too flimsy for someone with Dan\u2019s level of cynicism but how was he to argue with it on any reasonable level when he felt like his entire life had been made so much better because of the one person in his arms?</p><p>\u201cYou never answered my question,\u201d Phil said, voice soft. He was just noting it; he wasn\u2019t demanding an answer but Dan knew Phil and he was trying to coax him back to the living world and a little out of his head.</p><p>It was probably a good thing. He\u2019d spent way too long in there over the whole process of making the script, filming and editing the video. It was time he returned more firmly to the life outside of his head.</p><p>Dan opened his eyes and looked up at Phil. He was resting his chin on Phil\u2019s chest and looking up at him as if he was the literal sun. With his unruly hair, morning breath and glasses with entirely too many smudges that he should be able to see out of them properly. He was beautiful and wonderful and he was here in Dan\u2019s arms, which tightened around him as he kept looking up.</p><p>\u201cYou know how I\u2019m feeling?\u201d Dan asked, voice a little soft.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Phil asked, blue eyes staring into Dan\u2019s brown ones with sincerity and a playful smile on his lips.</p><p>They both knew where this was going. Just like Dan had known and only needed to chuckle to reveal that he knew what Phil had meant when he\u2019d said the word. They were so in sync, so used to each other that they sometimes could read the other better than themselves. Dan took a deep breath and he felt how in that moment, as Phil\u2019s chest breathing calm but steady rose to meet his own.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling fucking gay,\u201d Dan said and his lips split into the widest smile. </p><p>Phil returned one just as might and Dan revelled in the way it crinkled his eyes and made him look so handsome. Happy Phil was the most beautiful Phil of all and Dan intended to do everything in his power to make sure that Phil was always smiling.</p><p> \u201cI\u2019m proud of you,\u201d Phil said and pulled Dan closer to his chest and his arms were strong now, squeezing him tight. \u201cYou\u2019re amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s you,\u201d Dan said teasingly, squeezing back with just as much might.</p><p>Phil cackled and Dan snorted out a breath through his nose. </p><p>It felt so liberating to say the once dreaded word out loud now. It had felt good during filming, even if he had to take a moment to compose himself before letting the word spill from his lips. He had not spontaneously combusted then and he did not do so now. But he did feel the warmth spread from his core but it was not an explosion or dangerous flames burning him. It was a pair of arms, the sense of rainbows on his skin and a lighter feeling in his heart. </p><p>Pressing publish on the video had made a weight finally lift from his heart and Dan hadn\u2019t realised how heavy it had been until it was gone. He felt different. This was a new era. It had taken him so long but he was proud that he\u2019d even made it here at all.</p><p>For the very first time in his life, he didn\u2019t feel that underlying feeling of dread that had always been there, even in the happy moments. It might come back but for now it was nowhere to be seen or felt and Dan just felt happy.</p><p>He felt gay.</p><p>It was a great day to be gay.</p><p>The future was at his and Phil\u2019s feet. </p><p>He hoped they\u2019d have endless gay days in the future.</p><p>It could only get gayer.</p><p>Dan was so ready for it. </p>",

No. That\u2019s a lie. It has been over ten years in the making. Even since he first found out that he was at least partially that gay thing that everybody kept calling him from a young age. It had always been heading to this, ever since he stepped on the path alongside Phil and started to build an online audience.</p><p>He had tried to hide from it from a long time, especially when the pressure got too much and the questions became too invasive. He wasn\u2019t proud of some of the stuff he\u2019d done back then but it had taken him so horrendously long to shred the internalised oppression. He wasn\u2019t even sure if he\u2019d fully stepped out from under its shadow. </p><p>But yesterday had been an important day and it had been the biggest leap he had ever taken in this regard. He pulled up his phone now, looking at the notes on his phone and the little video idea. It had been sitting there for years and he had almost considered making it last year but the timing hadn\u2019t been right. He had still been too scared.</p><p>Just looking at the little note, starting off with <i>coming out</i>had used to chill his bones.

No. That\u2019s a lie. It has been over ten years in the making. Even since he first found out that he was at least partially that gay thing that everybody kept calling him from a young age. It had always been heading to this, ever since he stepped on the path alongside Phil and started to build an online audience.</p><p>He had tried to hide from it from a long time, especially when the pressure got too much and the questions became too invasive. He wasn\u2019t proud of some of the stuff he\u2019d done back then but it had taken him so horrendously long to shred the internalised oppression. He wasn\u2019t even sure if he\u2019d fully stepped out from under its shadow. </p><p>But yesterday had been an important day and it had been the biggest leap he had ever taken in this regard. He pulled up his phone now, looking at the notes on his phone and the little video idea. It had been sitting there for years and he had almost considered making it last year but the timing hadn\u2019t been right. He had still been too scared.</p><p>Just looking at the little note, starting off with <i>coming out</i>had used to chill his bones. At times, he\u2019d become so paranoid that he\u2019d rephrased it so it wasn\u2019t so obvious just if worst case happened and someone got their hands on his phone. He\u2019d changed it back eventually, ones the paranoid was during its low tide.</p><p>He could officially delete it off the list of video ideas. It was done. It had taken so long to produce and it had been an emotional labour more than anything else. It had taken everything out of him. On the day that he\u2019d filmed it, he\u2019d collapsed into Phil\u2019s arms afterwards, seeking comfort and reassurance which he was awarded in bundles.</p><p>Phil was beside him every step of the way, just like he\u2019d always been ever since they met and Dan knew he wouldn\u2019t have been strong enough to do this if it hadn\u2019t been for the man that he considered his companion through life. Phil had saved his life, again and again, and Dan would not be who he was today if it hadn\u2019t been for the kind-hearted man.</p><p>Dan had been anxious on his own behalf but he\u2019d also been scared on Phil\u2019s. He couldn\u2019t tell his story without revealing the worst kept secret in the fandom that revolved around them. People had known without <i>knowing</i>for years. He knew some people would come out with a <i>we been knew</i>and it had pissed him off pre-emptively. He hoped that addressing the toxicity of such a statement within the video would help to curb it.</p><p>Phil had entirely trusted him to tell the story of them. He had trusted him to phrase it in a way that represented them and their wishes and his trusting eyes and firm hand had never wavered. Dan had placed his heart in Phil\u2019s hands so long ago, nearly ten years now, and he had gotten a heart in return for his own. He had never treated anything with as much care as he did Phil\u2019s heart.</p><p>He knew it was the most important thing he would ever be allowed to hold and he treated it as such. Through their consensual banter, inside jokes, gentle touches, constant reassurance and domestic happiness.</p><p>He had been allowed to break Phil\u2019s coming out indirectly. However, Dan had to admit that the tweet that followed was funny and just so Phil. Phil had been grinning, tongue poking out of his teeth as he\u2019d shown it do Dan. It was lowkey, humorous but also honest. It was Phil in a nutshell.</p><p>Dan had needed the long video, bloody hell it had ended up at 45 minutes, and Phil could do it in just a tweet. Dan had always been the rambler of the two and Phil was more often than not content to just say his piece, concisely and leave it at that. They were different but they complimented each other.</p><p>\u201cDid you even sleep last night?\u201d Phil asked with a yawn. </p><p>Dan rolled over in bed to face Phil.</p><p>\u201cI think I passed out at some point. Maybe?\u201d he said with a chuckle and his voice was heavy with sleep.</p><p>He had entirely too much adrenalin in his system last night to go even remotely early to bed. He had been dipping in and out of various social media sites to gauge everyone\u2019s reaction. On some logical level, he\u2019d tried to tell himself that it would be fine. He\u2019d seen how other online creators was accepted and embraced when they\u2019d come out but it didn\u2019t take away from the fact that this was still special and important to him.</p><p>It was his coming out and no matter how many people had done it before him, none had quite had his experiences and either way, this was a huge potentially life altering thing <i>for him</i>to do. He\u2019d tackled his family, just last month, and how he was laying himself bare and vulnerable for essentially the whole world.</p><p>But the video wasn\u2019t specifically to the whole world, even if he knew that anyone with an internet connection could see it. He\u2019d learned that lesson the hard way years ago. It was to his audience first and foremost and secondarily to the people who would come later looking for reassurance. They were the people who\u2019d shown him that it would be a safe space for him to finally come out and everything around him had reinforced it again and again. At almost every Interactive Introverts show, he\u2019d seen pride flags and he\u2019s posed with many of them at the meet and greets and signed even more. Every time he\u2019d seen one or touched it, he\u2019d felt his heart soar a little. Dan and Phil had always wanted to create a safe and accepting community but witnessing it with his own eyes and hearing the personal stories had brought it to life in a different way.</p><p>The community, his fellow creators and the people who watched his content had become a bit like a family to him. Maybe that was why he had chosen to repeat the same line as the one he\u2019d used in that cringy email to his family.</p><p>Basically, I\u2019m gay.</p><p>It felt good to say it. He was still a little scared of the word. It was conditioned too deeply in him for it to completely disappear, even when the support and love was pouring in from every corner. But it was feeling less scary every time he said it, like he took the bad meaning away just by uttering it with confidence and reclaiming it for himself.</p><p>\u201cSo? How does it feel?\u201d Phil asked and reached over to rub Dan\u2019s back and Dan wondered how long he\u2019d gone silent as he\u2019d retreated into his own head again. It wasn\u2019t like Phil wasn\u2019t used to it.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing here, queer and filled with existential fear?\u201d Phil said in a joking voice and nudge Dan a little almost titling him over in their shared bed.</p><p>Dan barked out a laugh and shoved Phil back, phone forgotten as it landed amongst the duvets. He pushed over his partner until they were both lying on their sides and then he wrapped his arms around Phil, almost burrowing into him.</p><p>\u201cI could ask you too, you know,\u201d he mumbled into the warm expanse of Phil\u2019s neck, comforted by the familiar sense and the strong and warm arms that pulled him tighter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling particularly gay this morning,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>Dan chuckled, knowing what was coming, and Phil\u2019s fingers ran over his ribs. A little jab that made Dan\u2019s heart sing in his chest.</p><p>\u201cGay as in happy, of course,\u201d Phil said.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say, language major,\u201d Dan said.</p><p>But he thought it was very appropriate that gay could also mean happy. He didn\u2019t used to think so. When it was used as a slur and repeated as he took the abuse growing up, he had hated it. He felt like the word was taunting him, claiming that it could mean something good, something jolly when it caused him so much fear and pain. It had almost been responsible for pushing him past an edge he couldn\u2019t return from. </p><p>He had never felt happy to be any bit gay. He\u2019d felt miserable and furious. He had begged to be anything but when he\u2019d been younger. </p><p>But this morning, the morning after coming out to the whole world, he started to accept the other meaning of the word. He was wrapped up in the loving embrace of his actual soulmate, who he had been lucky enough to have in his life for nearly ten years and he hoped they would have each other until they were old, grey and sitting in matching chairs in a nursery home.</p><p>He closed his eyes and recalled all the loving words, the praise for the video that he\u2019d worked so hard for and the overwhelming support that he might have been able to foresee but he hadn\u2019t been able to tell how all of it would make him feel.</p><p>It made him feel warm. It made him feel loved. It made him feel gay.</p><p>Phil started to hum under his breath as he gently trailed his fingers over Dan\u2019s shoulder. Domestic scenes like this had only been a faraway fantasy when Dan had still been in school. He\u2019d see it in movies, between straight couples, and his heart would break because he thought he could never have this. </p><p>When he\u2019d first started seeing Phil, with all that horrible distance between them, he\u2019d lapped up every single domestic moment and committed them to memory. He hadn\u2019t been sure if he\u2019d ever get another. Now, he had so many more than he could even count. Every single day he felt the easy domestic life with Phil but he often had to just pause for a beat to appreciate it. Now was one of those moments and Dan could feel it imprinting on his mind.</p><p>The day after they both came out to the world, they were in bed, lying close as their breaths synched to each other like old friends falling into the familiar step. Dan was almost sure that his and Phil\u2019s heartbeats had learned to beat in perfect unison. </p><p>Soulmates were a ridiculous concept. It was too flimsy for someone with Dan\u2019s level of cynicism but how was he to argue with it on any reasonable level when he felt like his entire life had been made so much better because of the one person in his arms?</p><p>\u201cYou never answered my question,\u201d Phil said, voice soft. He was just noting it; he wasn\u2019t demanding an answer but Dan knew Phil and he was trying to coax him back to the living world and a little out of his head.</p><p>It was probably a good thing. He\u2019d spent way too long in there over the whole process of making the script, filming and editing the video. It was time he returned more firmly to the life outside of his head.</p><p>Dan opened his eyes and looked up at Phil. He was resting his chin on Phil\u2019s chest and looking up at him as if he was the literal sun. With his unruly hair, morning breath and glasses with entirely too many smudges that he should be able to see out of them properly. He was beautiful and wonderful and he was here in Dan\u2019s arms, which tightened around him as he kept looking up.</p><p>\u201cYou know how I\u2019m feeling?\u201d Dan asked, voice a little soft.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Phil asked, blue eyes staring into Dan\u2019s brown ones with sincerity and a playful smile on his lips.</p><p>They both knew where this was going. Just like Dan had known and only needed to chuckle to reveal that he knew what Phil had meant when he\u2019d said the word. They were so in sync, so used to each other that they sometimes could read the other better than themselves. Dan took a deep breath and he felt how in that moment, as Phil\u2019s chest breathing calm but steady rose to meet his own.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling fucking gay,\u201d Dan said and his lips split into the widest smile. </p><p>Phil returned one just as might and Dan revelled in the way it crinkled his eyes and made him look so handsome. Happy Phil was the most beautiful Phil of all and Dan intended to do everything in his power to make sure that Phil was always smiling.</p><p> \u201cI\u2019m proud of you,\u201d Phil said and pulled Dan closer to his chest and his arms were strong now, squeezing him tight. \u201cYou\u2019re amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s you,\u201d Dan said teasingly, squeezing back with just as much might.</p><p>Phil cackled and Dan snorted out a breath through his nose. </p><p>It felt so liberating to say the once dreaded word out loud now. It had felt good during filming, even if he had to take a moment to compose himself before letting the word spill from his lips. He had not spontaneously combusted then and he did not do so now. But he did feel the warmth spread from his core but it was not an explosion or dangerous flames burning him. It was a pair of arms, the sense of rainbows on his skin and a lighter feeling in his heart. </p><p>Pressing publish on the video had made a weight finally lift from his heart and Dan hadn\u2019t realised how heavy it had been until it was gone. He felt different. This was a new era. It had taken him so long but he was proud that he\u2019d even made it here at all.</p><p>For the very first time in his life, he didn\u2019t feel that underlying feeling of dread that had always been there, even in the happy moments. It might come back but for now it was nowhere to be seen or felt and Dan just felt happy.</p><p>He felt gay.</p><p>It was a great day to be gay.</p><p>The future was at his and Phil\u2019s feet. </p><p>He hoped they\u2019d have endless gay days in the future.</p><p>It could only get gayer.</p><p>Dan was so ready for it. </p>",

Happy Phil was the most beautiful Phil of all and Dan intended to do everything in his power to make sure that Phil was always smiling.</p><p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud of you,&rdquo; Phil said and pulled Dan closer to his chest and his arms were strong now, squeezing him tight. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re amazing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s you,&rdquo; Dan said teasingly, squeezing back with just as much might.</p><p>Phil cackled and Dan snorted out a breath through his nose. </p><p>It felt so liberating to say the once dreaded word out loud now. It had felt good during filming, even if he had to take a moment to compose himself before letting the word spill from his lips. He had not spontaneously combusted then and he did not do so now. But he did feel the warmth spread from his core but it was not an explosion or dangerous flames burning him. It was a pair of arms, the sense of rainbows on his skin and a lighter feeling in his heart. </p><p>Pressing publish on the video had made a weight finally lift from his heart and Dan hadn&rsquo;t realised how heavy it had been until it was gone. He felt different. This was a new era. It had taken him so long but he was proud that he&rsquo;d even made it here at all.</p><p>For the very first time in his life, he didn&rsquo;t feel that underlying feeling of dread that had always been there, even in the happy moments. It might come back but for now it was nowhere to be seen or felt and Dan just felt happy.</p><p>He felt gay.</p><p>It was a great day to be gay.</p><p>The future was at his and Phil&rsquo;s feet. </p><p>He hoped they&rsquo;d have endless gay days in the future.</p><p>It could only get gayer.</p><p>Dan was so ready for it. </p>",
