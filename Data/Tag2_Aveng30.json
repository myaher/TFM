The weapon finally flew into his battered hands, the force nearly twisting his whole upper body. He looked up at the Mad Titan above him, and positioned himself in a stance.</p><p>\u2022</p><p><i>Steve didn&rsquo;t mean to derail the group therapy session like that. He didn&rsquo;t mean to talk about someone he cared deeply about many years ago, especially that they died before the Snap. He should have talked about Sam, Bucky or Sharon. They mean more to him now. He ran a shaking hand through his hair, sighing deeply.</i></p><p><i>All he said in the session was bullshit. He doesn&rsquo;t think he can move on from his past. He&rsquo;s lost. No matter how much therapy he leads or gets, he is still lost.</i></p><p><i>He went inside the quiet Avengers Compound, the eery silence caused by the depression still present after five years of loss. He went straight to Nat&rsquo;s office in the heart of the building, seeing her crying over a peanut butter sandwich.</i></p><p><i>They lost \u2013 every single one of them.</i></p><p>\u2022</p><p>He felt uncomfortable holding the hammer. It&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s almost refusing him. Lightning coursed through his arm, so he took that as a cue to start attacking the enemy.</p><p>Thanos broke through his shield with simple blunt strokes of his double-edged sword, accidentally slashing a deep gash on his arm.</p><p>He stood up, tightening the strap of his shield to stop the bleeding. He stood up and faced Thanos and his army.</p><p>Whatever it takes.</p><p>\u2022</p><p><i>He didn&rsquo;t know why he brought this compass again. He knows it&rsquo;s a hazard: it&rsquo;s small and it can fall through his pocket. But he felt compelled to do it. He shook his head, shoving it into his utility belt.</i></p><p><i>What he didn&rsquo;t know that it will fall at the worst time. He quickly ran to save the metal case, his other self followed suit. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Where did you get this?&rdquo; he asked, holding a physical piece of his regret.</i></p><p>I got it from the past, Steve.</p><p><i>He didn&rsquo;t answer, instead, he pounced on him to get it back. But, his past self got him in a choke hold.</i></p><p><i>Steve internally cringed at what he&rsquo;s about to do. Bucky doesn&rsquo;t deserve to be a pawn.</i></p><p><i>But&hellip;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Bucky&rsquo;s alive,&rdquo; he choked out. He was released.</i></p><p>\u2022</p><p>&ldquo;On your left,&rdquo; came Sam&rsquo;s faint voice over the comms.</p><p>Steve felt relief flood over him. He knew he can&rsquo;t take on Thanos and his army alone, but God helo him, he&rsquo;s still willing ti do it.</p><p>Peggy flashed through his mind \u2013 it was forceful and borderline maddening. He forgot about Bucky, Sam, and Sharon. He forgot about saying sorry to Tony. He forgot about Nat. He forgot about his family. All in his mind was to win the fight and go back in time to marry her. To have children with her. To <i>dance</i> with her. He doesn&rsquo;t care about the consequences anymore. To hell with her husband. Or her children. Or his mental health. Real men do not show weakness, a voice told him. All they need is a woman.</p><p>Bucky and Sam are near him. All he needs is to look.
