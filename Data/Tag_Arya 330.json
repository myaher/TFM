Wherever she went<i> he</i> was there and if he wasn&rsquo;t, there were always people talking <i>about him</i>. Like her parents in the living room, praising <i>his book</i> or gloomy Sandor in the kitchen. Arya couldn&rsquo;t decide what was worse, her dad announcing <i>he&rsquo;s wise beyond his years</i> or Sandor sniffling :</p><p>&lsquo;I knew the day would come, she&rsquo;s too good for me !&rsquo;</p><p>The worst was mum, Arya realized, who cared that the man was <i>dashingly handsome</i> !</p><p>It&rsquo;s not how it was meant to be.</p><!-- more --><p>When they told her Jaqen was coming back to Westeros she jumped with joy. She was ten when she last saw him. He used to be their neighbor and he was <i>her friend</i>. He was sweet, he used to tell her funny stories about dragons and spies. He was patient with her when she needed help with homework. Even though he knew she pretended to need help. And he never mocked her fencing lessons like other boys did. He even sparred with her once and let her win. They both knew he let her win but they chose to pretend he didn&rsquo;t. Arya liked his long red hair with funny white streaks, his Lorathi accent and his worn jeans. And she liked that funny feeling in her belly when other girls were looking at him whenever they strolled around the town together. She even tolerated his girlfriend. She was older than Jaqen and already studying in Braavos and he never spoke of her anyway.</p><p>Arya made plans for the whole summer for the two of them. They would feed strays and eat apples straight from the tree in her mother&rsquo;s garden. They would go swimming every day like they used to do. Arya would take Jaqen to that beautiful glade she had discovered behind the pines on the other side of the river. They could stay there for hours, reading his strange books, not bothered by anyone. She bit her lip in excitement at the thought Jaqen would see all the trophies she won in Harrenhal tourneys.

Arya wanted to run and hug him but something stopped her. He seemed taller than she remembered, more masculine, stronger. For a twenty-four year old he had the air of someone who had seen everything. He complimented<i> lady Stark&rsquo;s</i> hospitality, flashing a disarming smile, drawing sighs of admiration from mum, Sansa and Jeyne. Arya could swear mum blushed !</p><p>Jaqen shook hands with everyone and congratulated dad on the case he won against Tywin Lannister. Dad pulled him into a hug laughing and when he released him Jaqen found Arya. His eyes gleamed like blue steel, he had the most beautiful face of any man she had ever seen. Arya had never felt so small and vulnerable, all her plans vanished, her courage evaporated in a heartbeat.</p><p>This handsome stranger wasn&rsquo;t <i>her Jaqen</i>, the slender boy she used to know, with funny hair and dreamy eyes. Suddenly she realized what dad had been trying to tell her for weeks, that Jaqen was a published author now, an expert in politics of Essos and she shouldn&rsquo;t expect him to climb trees with her. Arya remembered the cover of the magazine Sansa showed her with the picture of Jaqen and queen Daenerys. Suddenly she felt so silly with her fencing trophies !

She bit her lip.</p><p>Seven hells&hellip;They had a long hot summer ahead of them&hellip;</p>",
