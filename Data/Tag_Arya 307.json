Not afraid of that goddamn dog. Not afraid of that red bitch. Not afraid of anything.</p><p><b>In Season 4, we saw her never giving in to the dark side. </b>Gave The Hound the benefit of the doubt. Tried to protect the kind farmer and his daughter. Bonus: Didn&rsquo;t give a shit about Brienne in shining armor. &ldquo;I save myself, bitch.&rdquo;</p><p><b>In Season 5, we saw her working to fulfill her destiny.</b> Willing to suffer to achieve her dream. Willing to serve others on the way. Willing to get hurt in order to learn. 0% ego, 100% guts.</p><p><b>In Season 6, we saw principles as strong as the tallest, thickest, oldest tree. </b>Wouldn&rsquo;t kill anyone who didn&rsquo;t deserve it. Not because she could meant she should. The angriest person in Westeros. But also the kindest person in Westeros.</p><p><b>In Season 7, we saw justice in its purest form. </b>Will hurt you the way you hurt her. Poetic. Will give up her search for vengeance to see her family again. Priorities. Will cut her own limb to save the rest of her body from decaying. Wise.&nbsp;</p><p>Arya being&nbsp;&ldquo;watered down&rdquo; is just a euphemism little pussy snowflakes use to say,&nbsp;&ldquo;OMG, how dare the writers make Arya threaten my number one favorite character Sansa or beat my second favorite character Brienne in a fight?!&rdquo;</p><h2>Arya is not your toy robot, bitch. She&rsquo;s not here to kill all the characters you hate and play video games with the characters you love. Get over your goddamn self. She is more than your preferences. She is Arya Stark, and she is better than you.</h2><p>(I don&rsquo;t really hate you, anon. This is just how I talk. XOXO)</p></p>",
