It's likely I do not sail your ship, but I don't wank and expect visitors to play nicely as well. That includes not adding hate or negativity to my posts, altering them to suit your own ships, or removing my original comments. If you do, you will be blocked.\nIRL they call me Doctor. Yep, I'm that old. Sometimes I write things that other people watch. It's all good! I like mocha latte with bourbon. A lot.",
