And we know that both things are supposed to be high level magic. In fact, becoming an animagus is supposedly incredibly dangerous.</p><p>So like</p><p>Do they have to be the same thing?</p><p>Do we know of a case where they are different?</p><p>Could the reason that becoming an animagus is so hard is because it has to be the same as your patronus and your patronus is often not a generic animal type?</p><p>How many people were just like &ldquo;I want to shape change into a lion&rdquo; or &ldquo;I want to be a house cat&rdquo; and it didn&rsquo;t work because their patronus was like a Scottish fold or a Bengal tiger or something else completely like a pangolin?!</p><p>We only know of 4 animagi in canon right? James, Sirius, Peter, and Minerva. </p><p>Could it be that the code to figuring out your only animagus form is to know what the manifestation of your happiest thoughts looks like? </p><p>Also I want to know if Remus&rsquo; patronus is a wolf/werewolf because that doesn&rsquo;t seem like a happy thought? Edit: Google says that it is indeed an ordinary wolf (apparently never revealed in the books though just on Pottermore).</p><p>Further notes: Google says Sirius&rsquo; patronus is a dog. Minerva&rsquo;s is a cat.</p><p>Hm we also know that patronus&rsquo; can change for who you love. Two cases known: Sevs is a doe supposedly because of Lily and Tonk&rsquo;s chages to be a wolf when she falls for Remus.</p><p>So like </p><p>Is that normal?
