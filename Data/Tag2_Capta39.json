        "body": "<p>For the most part, I like it. Could\u2019ve been better. But here are my problems with the movie</p><ul><li>The bad taste Thor fat jokes and mocking jokes about Thor&rsquo;s PTSD and depression&hellip;.like really? Also nice of the Russos for throwing Thor&rsquo;s character arc out the window and abandoning his people&hellip;.TWICE. Instead of taking responsibility and rule with Valkyrie as his equal, Thor just abandons his people just to be a Guardian&hellip;.for reasons??????</li><li>\n\nSidelining Carol. WHAT IS THE FUCKING POINT OF TEASING HER ONLY TO LEAVE HER ON THE FUCKING SIDES. NO SERIOUSLY, FUCKING WHY???\u00a0 Why does Wanda get to unleash on Thanos, but Carol gets knocked around by Thanos? Fucking seriously? What kind of fucking bullshit is this. What kind of actual fucking disrespect is this horseshit?<br/></li><li>\n\nNot making Carol and Maria married and being the representation fans wanted.\u00a0\n\nCarol\u2019s butch lesbian look was more representation than a nameless guy saying he was seeing another guy.\u00a0<br/></li><li>\n\nFridging Black Widow before her fucking movie even comes out, jesus fucking christ, they really went &ldquo;you&rsquo;re getting a Black Widow movie lol lmao bitch you thought&rdquo; it\u2019s not just that. Natasha isn\u2019t even given respect after her passing. She isn\u2019t given a goodbye. All she gets is the men turning into whiny pissants and Bruce tosses a bench into the lake. Natasha sacrificed her life for her family and to stop Thanos and THIS IS THE FUCKING THANKS SHE GETS???\u00a0<br/></li><li>Gamora is still fridged. Past Gamora is loyal to Thanos. That makes no fucking sense. Did the Russos even WATCH Guardians Of The Galaxy? Gamora in 2014 was working AGAINST Thanos. She plotted on hiding the power stone away from Thanos. Present Nebula didn\u2019t even need to convince her, she should\u2019ve helped Present Nebula from the beginning. There was no need for it. Even worse, Strange couldn\u2019t just bring Gamora\u00a0 from a time before she went to Vormir. Gamora couldn\u2019t have been spared her fate. And even worse. Both Gamora and Nebula are denied the revenge of the man who has abused, manipulated and gaslighted them their whole lives and they couldn\u2019t be allowed the opportunity to kill Thanos? Fuck you.</li><li>\n\nHank and Pierce&rsquo;s bad toupees\n\n<br/></li><li>\n\nNot making Loki the rat who frees Scott and having it revealed and having Loki&rsquo;s grand dramatic slut return entrance. Loki just escaping with the Tesseract and\u00a0 not doing anything with it is just dumb. But what\u2019s really dumb is not having Thor and Loki escaping together in Infinity War while Thanos is fighting The Hulk. He had it and he didn\u2019t use it. It just feels like Loki\u2019s death was ultimately pointless now. And apparently Loki escaping with The\n\nTesseract\u00a0 was pointless, Loki is seen in his cell in Asgard&hellip;.how the fuck is this supposed to make any sense at all? So honestly I would just have Loki be the very last one to return and reveal himself as the rat who freed Scott. It would make more sense than anything. Loki is the very thing that started The Avengers, it makes sense that he returns to help them against Thanos.<br/></li><li>\n\nThat fucking Hydra Cap reference, he needed to stay in cover, I know but we wanted to forget it ever happened\n\n<br/></li><li>\n\nOnce again the shows are screwed over. No Quake, Ghost Rider or The Defenders\n\n<br/></li><li>Nebula does not kill Thanos&hellip;..fucking bullshit fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Nebula should\u2019ve killed Thanos. Nebula by far suffered the most and the hand of Thanos. She was abused, manipulated, and isolated because of him and he killed her sister. Additionally, all of her movies, but especially Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and Endgame flesh out and develop her character quite well, giving the audience ample time to connect with her. Furthermore, a great portion of Nebula\u2019s body has been replaced with metal, which we already knew from previous films but was highlighted in Endgame itself, when Nebula simply sticks her hand in the energy field surrounding the power stone to retrieve it, destroying the \u201cskin\u201d on her hand but leaving her \u201cskeleton\u201d intact. Because of this, it is likely that Nebula had a better chance of surviving a snap than any other Avenger (except for maybe Bruce), and the cinematic payoff of allowing her to be the one to kill Thanos would have been far greater than letting Tony kill Thanos. You could even have Thanos say\u00a0\u201cI am inevitable daughter\u201d Nebula could have a Eowyn moment\u00a0\u201cI am not your daughter\u201d and finally Nebula would kill him. Nebula deserved to kill Thanos. And since Nebula was the one who snapped, we know Gamora would return, maybe since they worked together, Nebula would bring back Natasha. Like they all fought to bring an end and bring everyone back. Gamora and Natasha deserved to return and reverse the bullshit fridging.<br/>Tony could return to his family and once again they didn\u2019t have to make Far From Home of making Spider-Man be\u00a0\u201cthe new Iron Man\u201d Tony could retire in peace and tell Peter\u00a0\u201cthe world is in safe hands of the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man\u201d</li><li>Steve Rogers abandoning his found family and the horrible implications of Steve staying in the past. Before I talk about the implications, I just need to say it makes no sense. Steve made peace with his life in the new world. Peggy wanted Steve to move on, Steve grew as a character. He even saw Peggy was happy in Endgame(however I would\u2019ve had Peggy be seen with her wife Angie, yes fuck ABC I am still bitter) and Peggy herself said she was happy with her life. It makes no sense for Steve to just abandon Sam and Bucky just to be with someone he kissed once. I honestly would\u2019ve been happy if he chose to sacrifice himself to bring Natasha back. I would even be happy if Steve came back, married Sharon and chose to retire, and pass on the Shield to Sam. Just anything is better. It\u2019s not a satisfying conclusion to Steve Rogers\u2019 character arc.\u00a0 A satisfying character arc means more than giving the character a prize at the end of the story. Women are not prizes. Peggy Carter is not a prize. Peggy Carter would slap the shit out of Steve Rogers if she knew he threw his life away just to be with her and ruining her own life in turn. Even if I didn&rsquo;t like how they paired Peggy with Daniel, even I understand that Peggy moved on and found love and married a man who lost his leg for his country without superstrength or fame, and they had kids. Steve took away Peggy&rsquo;s agency, destroyed her family and ruined his own journey. Even more insulting is the fact that Bucky Barnes was brought back to life and Steve barely acknowledges him. Ever since The Winter Soldier, Steve\u2019s journey has been focused on Bucky and he barely even acknowledges him. He fought a fucking war that split The Avengers for him and he STILL does not even have one last moment with him? What the fuck? But you know the real stupid thing about this? Tony and Natasha died just so\u00a0to make the world a better place. The better place that Steve then leaves at the end of the movie. Steve\u2019s entire character arc throughout the MCU would be opposed to altering the timeline for his own selfish desires. This is not the Captain America I know. You\u2019re seriously telling me that Steve Rogers didn\u2019t value his present friends, possible girlfriend and life even a little bit? What has been done to Steve Rogers is unforgivable and I would rather Steve dies sacrificing himself in bringing Thanos down. That would\u2019ve been a better send off than ignoring everything about his character arc.<br/>As for the implications about going to the past? He knows about the future, he knows HYDRA infiltrated SHIELD, he knows Bucky is being used as their weapon and will kill the Starks, he knows that Peggy, Howard and Hank are surrounded by Hydra,\u00a0 he even knows about the civil rights fighting. it\u2019s a little alarming Steve Rogers\u2019s idea of a retirement plan was to go back to the jim crow era to cuddle up with his old flame. Apparently a happy ending for Captain America is a white man in the US. He went back to an era where a cis het white man would feel very safe and comfortable.\n\n He doesn&rsquo;t choose to fight for Civil rights in the 60&rsquo;s(how is Sam supposed to feel that Steve did nothing for the movement?), Steve and Peggy don&rsquo;t crack down the Hydra infestation and there isn&rsquo;t a Bucky rescue. Like really bad implications\n\n</li></ul>",

But here are my problems with the movie</p><ul><li>The bad taste Thor fat jokes and mocking jokes about Thor\u2019s PTSD and depression\u2026.like really? Also nice of the Russos for throwing Thor\u2019s character arc out the window and abandoning his people\u2026.TWICE. Instead of taking responsibility and rule with Valkyrie as his equal, Thor just abandons his people just to be a Guardian\u2026.for reasons??????</li><li>\n\nSidelining Carol. WHAT IS THE FUCKING POINT OF TEASING HER ONLY TO LEAVE HER ON THE FUCKING SIDES. NO SERIOUSLY, FUCKING WHY???\u00a0 Why does Wanda get to unleash on Thanos, but Carol gets knocked around by Thanos? Fucking seriously? What kind of fucking bullshit is this. What kind of actual fucking disrespect is this horseshit?<br></li><li>\n\nNot making Carol and Maria married and being the representation fans wanted.\u00a0\n\nCarol\u2019s butch lesbian look was more representation than a nameless guy saying he was seeing another guy.\u00a0<br></li><li>\n\nFridging Black Widow before her fucking movie even comes out, jesus fucking christ, they really went \u201cyou\u2019re getting a Black Widow movie lol lmao bitch you thought\u201d it\u2019s not just that. Natasha isn\u2019t even given respect after her passing. She isn\u2019t given a goodbye. All she gets is the men turning into whiny pissants and Bruce tosses a bench into the lake. Natasha sacrificed her life for her family and to stop Thanos and THIS IS THE FUCKING THANKS SHE GETS???\u00a0<br></li><li>Gamora is still fridged. Past Gamora is loyal to Thanos. That makes no fucking sense. Did the Russos even WATCH Guardians Of The Galaxy? Gamora in 2014 was working AGAINST Thanos. She plotted on hiding the power stone away from Thanos. Present Nebula didn\u2019t even need to convince her, she should\u2019ve helped Present Nebula from the beginning. There was no need for it. Even worse, Strange couldn\u2019t just bring Gamora\u00a0 from a time before she went to Vormir. Gamora couldn\u2019t have been spared her fate. And even worse. Both Gamora and Nebula are denied the revenge of the man who has abused, manipulated and gaslighted them their whole lives and they couldn\u2019t be allowed the opportunity to kill Thanos? Fuck you.</li><li>\n\nHank and Pierce\u2019s bad toupees\n\n<br></li><li>\n\nNot making Loki the rat who frees Scott and having it revealed and having Loki\u2019s grand dramatic slut return entrance. Loki just escaping with the Tesseract and\u00a0 not doing anything with it is just dumb. But what\u2019s really dumb is not having Thor and Loki escaping together in Infinity War while Thanos is fighting The Hulk. He had it and he didn\u2019t use it. It just feels like Loki\u2019s death was ultimately pointless now. And apparently Loki escaping with The\n\nTesseract\u00a0 was pointless, Loki is seen in his cell in Asgard\u2026.how the fuck is this supposed to make any sense at all? So honestly I would just have Loki be the very last one to return and reveal himself as the rat who freed Scott. It would make more sense than anything. Loki is the very thing that started The Avengers, it makes sense that he returns to help them against Thanos.<br></li><li>\n\nThat fucking Hydra Cap reference, he needed to stay in cover, I know but we wanted to forget it ever happened\n\n<br></li><li>\n\nOnce again the shows are screwed over. No Quake, Ghost Rider or The Defenders\n\n<br></li><li>Nebula does not kill Thanos\u2026..fucking bullshit fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Nebula should\u2019ve killed Thanos. Nebula by far suffered the most and the hand of Thanos. She was abused, manipulated, and isolated because of him and he killed her sister. Additionally, all of her movies, but especially Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and Endgame flesh out and develop her character quite well, giving the audience ample time to connect with her. Furthermore, a great portion of Nebula\u2019s body has been replaced with metal, which we already knew from previous films but was highlighted in Endgame itself, when Nebula simply sticks her hand in the energy field surrounding the power stone to retrieve it, destroying the \u201cskin\u201d on her hand but leaving her \u201cskeleton\u201d intact. Because of this, it is likely that Nebula had a better chance of surviving a snap than any other Avenger (except for maybe Bruce), and the cinematic payoff of allowing her to be the one to kill Thanos would have been far greater than letting Tony kill Thanos. You could even have Thanos say\u00a0\u201cI am inevitable daughter\u201d Nebula could have a Eowyn moment\u00a0\u201cI am not your daughter\u201d and finally Nebula would kill him. Nebula deserved to kill Thanos. And since Nebula was the one who snapped, we know Gamora would return, maybe since they worked together, Nebula would bring back Natasha. Like they all fought to bring an end and bring everyone back. Gamora and Natasha deserved to return and reverse the bullshit fridging.<br>Tony could return to his family and once again they didn\u2019t have to make Far From Home of making Spider-Man be\u00a0\u201cthe new Iron Man\u201d Tony could retire in peace and tell Peter\u00a0\u201cthe world is in safe hands of the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man\u201d</li><li>Steve Rogers abandoning his found family and the horrible implications of Steve staying in the past. Before I talk about the implications, I just need to say it makes no sense. Steve made peace with his life in the new world. Peggy wanted Steve to move on, Steve grew as a character. He even saw Peggy was happy in Endgame(however I would\u2019ve had Peggy be seen with her wife Angie, yes fuck ABC I am still bitter) and Peggy herself said she was happy with her life. It makes no sense for Steve to just abandon Sam and Bucky just to be with someone he kissed once. I honestly would\u2019ve been happy if he chose to sacrifice himself to bring Natasha back. I would even be happy if Steve came back, married Sharon and chose to retire, and pass on the Shield to Sam. Just anything is better. It\u2019s not a satisfying conclusion to Steve Rogers\u2019 character arc.\u00a0 A satisfying character arc means more than giving the character a prize at the end of the story. Women are not prizes. Peggy Carter is not a prize. Peggy Carter would slap the shit out of Steve Rogers if she knew he threw his life away just to be with her and ruining her own life in turn. Even if I didn\u2019t like how they paired Peggy with Daniel, even I understand that Peggy moved on and found love and married a man who lost his leg for his country without superstrength or fame, and they had kids. Steve took away Peggy\u2019s agency, destroyed her family and ruined his own journey. Even more insulting is the fact that Bucky Barnes was brought back to life and Steve barely acknowledges him. Ever since The Winter Soldier, Steve\u2019s journey has been focused on Bucky and he barely even acknowledges him. He fought a fucking war that split The Avengers for him and he STILL does not even have one last moment with him? What the fuck? But you know the real stupid thing about this? Tony and Natasha died just so\u00a0to make the world a better place. The better place that Steve then leaves at the end of the movie. Steve\u2019s entire character arc throughout the MCU would be opposed to altering the timeline for his own selfish desires. This is not the Captain America I know. You\u2019re seriously telling me that Steve Rogers didn\u2019t value his present friends, possible girlfriend and life even a little bit? What has been done to Steve Rogers is unforgivable and I would rather Steve dies sacrificing himself in bringing Thanos down. That would\u2019ve been a better send off than ignoring everything about his character arc.<br>As for the implications about going to the past? He knows about the future, he knows HYDRA infiltrated SHIELD, he knows Bucky is being used as their weapon and will kill the Starks, he knows that Peggy, Howard and Hank are surrounded by Hydra,\u00a0 he even knows about the civil rights fighting. it\u2019s a little alarming Steve Rogers\u2019s idea of a retirement plan was to go back to the jim crow era to cuddle up with his old flame. Apparently a happy ending for Captain America is a white man in the US. He went back to an era where a cis het white man would feel very safe and comfortable.\n\n He doesn\u2019t choose to fight for Civil rights in the 60\u2019s(how is Sam supposed to feel that Steve did nothing for the movement?), Steve and Peggy don\u2019t crack down the Hydra infestation and there isn\u2019t a Bucky rescue. Like really bad implications\n\n</li></ul></p>",
