Moominpappa was constantly telling Moomin to get to the center of the stage, so I find it nice that Snufkin is sitting in his direct line of sight.

He even laughed a little bit, which is quite rare for him. It\u2019s really meaningful to see him reacting so openly, especially when it\u2019s Moomin up there on the stage, most likely watching for his reactions. The only thing an audience can really do to offer support to the actors without making a sound, is to be expressive.\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1013\" data-orig-width=\"1911\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d3e8a967b73472ab6897f5bddab06ff0/tumblr_inline_poxboi9H0S1rnhdz2_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"1013\" data-orig-width=\"1911\"/></figure><p>then everything goes wrong and we can see how bad Moomin feels before the curtains close and the intermission begins.\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1021\" data-orig-width=\"1917\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/953cf21fa60c14f8463b4202ce1d4b94/tumblr_inline_poxbsy5GAI1rnhdz2_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"1021\" data-orig-width=\"1917\"/></figure><p>Moominmamma turns to Snufkin, and the two share a look, before Snufkin gets up and goes to find Moomin.\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1017\" data-orig-width=\"1909\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bfee0fdd316e83dba656df3e521f0063/tumblr_inline_poxbuv53wS1rnhdz2_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"1017\" data-orig-width=\"1909\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1023\" data-orig-width=\"1917\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/49f12d8909ecb0b64080be1efb755f60/tumblr_inline_poxbuwJ5BV1rnhdz2_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"1023\" data-orig-width=\"1917\"/></figure><p>we see Moomin gazing sadly at the script. he\u2019s holding his golden tail, but let\u2019s it drop and sighs. Snufkin finds him, and says the tail could always be cut off, but that could disappoint others. Moomin goes to the door to see Sniff selling fake golden tails to the excited audience. People liked the play.\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1011\" data-orig-width=\"1917\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/00c2773b2b70b979792b547c6d277e14/tumblr_inline_poxcumeVL81rnhdz2_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"1011\" data-orig-width=\"1917\"/></figure><p>Moomin remains frustrated and states he\u2019s not his father, and that he\u2019s just himself. Snufkin gazes gently at Moomin, and leaves after stating happy endings are pleasant. Following this conversation, Moomin is able to come up with a solution to the problem at hand.\u00a0</p><p>Deep down this episode heavily revolved around Moomin finding confidence in himself. He was pressured to play a part he didn\u2019t feel confident in. He got a\u00a0 self-esteem boost from his golden tail, but in the end it didn\u2019t change anything. He still couldn\u2019t play the part of his father. Snufkin didn\u2019t at any point tell Moomin what he should do, or what he thought of the play. He allowed Moomin to find the solution on his own, but it\u2019s clear that Snufkin\u2019s words and presence helped Moomin a lot.\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1021\" data-orig-width=\"1917\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/78fc5c1737a700c1e60037a615b8a0f3/tumblr_inline_poxdaqRrEj1rnhdz2_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"1021\" data-orig-width=\"1917\"/></figure><p>Moomin becomes the director of the play, and the role of his father is played by Moominpappa. The play is a success, and the audience claps in captivation. Snufkin has moved to a boat on the side, and he claps and cheers, telling Moomin that he did a good job.\u00a0</p><p>Snufkin is the kind of character that\u00a0 has no need for the opinions of others, and therefore has no need to impress anyone. When you don\u2019t care about compliments or support, it can be extremely difficult to give them out to others. It\u2019s painfully clear that Moomin is trying so hard to do a good job, and make his friends and family proud.</p><p>\u00a0Snufkin\u2019s way of offering his support, is to simply <b>be</b>\u00a0there for Moomin. Everyone knows he could be out there doing anything whenever. He has no obligation to sit through every rehearsal, but he does. He chose to be there. Clapping and giving out a compliment is huge, and definitely means a lot to Moomin.\u00a0</p><p>So far the new show has done a good job of showing Snufkin\u2019s considerate side towards Moomin, and I\u2019m excited to see them explore it more.\u00a0</p>",

He even laughed a little bit, which is quite rare for him. It&rsquo;s really meaningful to see him reacting so openly, especially when it&rsquo;s Moomin up there on the stage, most likely watching for his reactions. The only thing an audience can really do to offer support to the actors without making a sound, is to be expressive.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d3e8a967b73472ab6897f5bddab06ff0/tumblr_inline_poxboi9H0S1rnhdz2_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>then everything goes wrong and we can see how bad Moomin feels before the curtains close and the intermission begins.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/953cf21fa60c14f8463b4202ce1d4b94/tumblr_inline_poxbsy5GAI1rnhdz2_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Moominmamma turns to Snufkin, and the two share a look, before Snufkin gets up and goes to find Moomin.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bfee0fdd316e83dba656df3e521f0063/tumblr_inline_poxbuv53wS1rnhdz2_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/49f12d8909ecb0b64080be1efb755f60/tumblr_inline_poxbuwJ5BV1rnhdz2_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>we see Moomin gazing sadly at the script. he&rsquo;s holding his golden tail, but let&rsquo;s it drop and sighs. Snufkin finds him, and says the tail could always be cut off, but that could disappoint others. Moomin goes to the door to see Sniff selling fake golden tails to the excited audience. People liked the play.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/00c2773b2b70b979792b547c6d277e14/tumblr_inline_poxcumeVL81rnhdz2_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Moomin remains frustrated and states he&rsquo;s not his father, and that he&rsquo;s just himself. Snufkin gazes gently at Moomin, and leaves after stating happy endings are pleasant. Following this conversation, Moomin is able to come up with a solution to the problem at hand.&nbsp;</p><p>Deep down this episode heavily revolved around Moomin finding confidence in himself. He was pressured to play a part he didn&rsquo;t feel confident in. He got a&nbsp; self-esteem boost from his golden tail, but in the end it didn&rsquo;t change anything. He still couldn&rsquo;t play the part of his father. Snufkin didn&rsquo;t at any point tell Moomin what he should do, or what he thought of the play. He allowed Moomin to find the solution on his own, but it&rsquo;s clear that Snufkin&rsquo;s words and presence helped Moomin a lot.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/78fc5c1737a700c1e60037a615b8a0f3/tumblr_inline_poxdaqRrEj1rnhdz2_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Moomin becomes the director of the play, and the role of his father is played by Moominpappa. The play is a success, and the audience claps in captivation. Snufkin has moved to a boat on the side, and he claps and cheers, telling Moomin that he did a good job.&nbsp;</p><p>Snufkin is the kind of character that&nbsp; has no need for the opinions of others, and therefore has no need to impress anyone. When you don&rsquo;t care about compliments or support, it can be extremely difficult to give them out to others. It&rsquo;s painfully clear that Moomin is trying so hard to do a good job, and make his friends and family proud.</p><p>&nbsp;Snufkin&rsquo;s way of offering his support, is to simply <b>be</b>&nbsp;there for Moomin. Everyone knows he could be out there doing anything whenever. He has no obligation to sit through every rehearsal, but he does. He chose to be there. Clapping and giving out a compliment is huge, and definitely means a lot to Moomin.&nbsp;</p><p>So far the new show has done a good job of showing Snufkin&rsquo;s considerate side towards Moomin, and I&rsquo;m excited to see them explore it more.&nbsp;</p>",
