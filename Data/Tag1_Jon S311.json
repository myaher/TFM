        "body": "<h2>-Jon and Dany are NOT a couple.</h2><p>Because I don\u2019t think either of them would <i>want</i> to be together after finding out <b>THE TRUTH</b> about their shared family roots. Dany is unstable and her incestuous bloodline isn\u2019t helping; and bestowing that on a child is even worse. Jon is too moral for that noise. But, of course, there is going to be a child, because of that stupid prophecy. I\u2019m sure they passed an island, or something about Jon being undead, that will fit the requirements and she\u2019ll find she\u2019s with child. They will try to keep it a secret, but Tyrion knows and is dragged into it all as well (that\u2019s the only reason I can think of for why they would make a stink for us to see that <i>Tyrion</i> knows that they had relations).</p><h2>-Sansa and Tyrion will renew their marital contract as a political move.</h2><p>It will be Sansa\u2019s idea, as she is not interested in love sustaining her; she\u2019s in love with Winterfell and it\u2019s people, and that\u2019s enough for her. But to avoid suitors coming at her and being manipulated for political gain ever again, she proposes renewing her marriage to Tyrion, as he has always been kind to Sansa and respects her. If she can produce at least one child, then she has someone to pass Winterfell on to, and it can eventually unite Starks and Lannisters. Tyrion will comply, even though he knows it\u2019s not for love&hellip; but of course my shippers heart would hope that eventually his expert gentleness can teach Sansa to enjoy her body, despite the scars. And they get along so well, as master politicians&hellip; and could probably learn to love each other for their intelligences. And the union pleases\u00a0\u201cThe Rightful Queen\u201d&hellip; though I don\u2019t think Sansa would really care about that.</p><h2>-Jon (or Sansa) takes the Westeros throne, but only until Dany\u2019s child comes of age.</h2><p>This fulfills a few loose ends. When the Mad King was slain, everyone expected Stark to step up and take the throne, as they all could unite under the righteous and honest Neddard Stark. But Robert Baratheon did instead. So it\u2019s gotta be a Stark&hellip;but the end result is <i>King\u2019s Blood</i>, and a female: Cersei\u2019s prophecy is that she will lose all of her children and that a younger, more beautiful queen will take her place on the throne. So she finds all queen contenders a major threat&hellip; but how ironic would it be if the future queen to take her place was actually an infant she doesn\u2019t even know about, rather than all the ladies that are currently posing a threat? So it\u2019s gotta be a Stark, Kings Blood, and a female. I believe it will be Dany\u2019s daughter.\u00a0</p><h2>-Dany dies in child-birth.</h2><p>I\u2019m over Dany. And it would be poetic irony that the mother of dragons, breaker of chains, slave mother who can conquer and is the most beautiful and blah blah blah&hellip; meets her end with something as <i>ordinary</i> as childbirth. I know alot of people don\u2019t like that idea&hellip; But I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t see her going down in a blaze of glory with a gooey death scene (because she\u2019s unbeatable with her dragons)&hellip;but she will die. She\u2019s been built up too much to be the winner they are all expecting. She gonna die.
