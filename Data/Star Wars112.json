He\u2019s not a very present father because obviously he\u2019s off being a Jedi himself, but since Qui-Gon isn\u2019t a Jedi, he feels more of a need to protect him and none the less, is a loving father. If not constantly there.</p><p>So that\u2019s backstory, whatever. I just have a fondness for Dooku being an actual good parent lol, but the real story is set much later on. Qui-Gon is older, Dooku is Hella Old, and Qui-Gon is married on Naboo now to a very nice man, with a few kids of their own. How nice. </p><p>Dooku is visiting the temple one day when Yoda tells him Initiate Kenobi needs to be adopted out and \u2018happen to know, do you, of a family for this little one\u2019 because Yoda is 1000000% sure that if the council gets their way and sends him off to one of the corps, this kid is gonna self destruct and fall into a depression so deep he\u2019ll never climb out and the kid\u2019s fucking 13 years old and Yoda is like \u2018omfg fuck that noise that\u2019s a baby why are y\u2019all so uncaring of how BROKEN he is\u2019 (he broken for a reason okay I\u2019m not gonna say more than that it\u2019s a Bad Situation for a kid to be in) and Dooku is all \u2018well, I may know one\u2019</p><p>Shows up on Naboo two weeks later like \u2018surprise!
