On her right hand, a bright orange that changed almost every moment, quick and fleeting. Sometimes there\u2019d be little drawings, detailed pounding hearts or sloppily constructed portraits. While the orange script vanished and reappeared as a constant, Maria\u2019s left hand stayed static, the same dark blue writing having never changed in over twelve years. </p><p>Head perched in his mother\u2019s lap, Tony played with her hands, marveling quietly at the contrast. \u201cMama, why don\u2019t the red thoughts change anymore?\u201d </p><p>Maria pulled her hand back, rubbing her palm with her thumb, almost tracing the words. Tony was old enough to read now. He could see the words <i>I wish I could have met you</i> clearly, written almost like it was scribbled in a rush all along her hand. </p><p>Immediately, the orange writing changed: <i>Don\u2019t be sad, I hate it when you\u2019re sad</i>. Tony pulled away. Had he upset mama? But quickly, Maria rushed to gather him in her arms, holding him tight. \u201cTony, you remember what the writing means right?\u201d</p><p>Tony nodded, still trying to figure out whether he had upset his mother or not. \u201cThe right hand is your soul mate who\u2019s your best friend and the left is your soul mate that you marry.\u201d</p><p>Maria smiled, pinching his cheek. \u201cThat\u2019s right. And do you remember why the words always change?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s their most important thought.\u201d he answered, proud when his mother nodded.</p><p>\u201cBut sometimes\u2026\u201d her voice trailed off, locked in a pain Tony didn\u2019t yet understand, \u201csometimes the words stay frozen because that\u2019s the person\u2019s last thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can someone stop thinking?\u201d Tony scrunched his nose. </p><p>He knew for sure that could never happen to him. Even when he didn\u2019t want them, his thoughts raced faster than even he could keep up with sometimes. Maria looked down at her hand. \u201cSometimes your soul mate dies.\u201d she says quietly, \u201cAnd the last thing they ever thought stays on your skin forever.\u201d </p><p>Tony frowned. \u201cBut your soul-mate is supposed to <i>be</i> with you forever.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAt least I had a soul-mate Tony. Some people aren\u2019t so lucky.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s frown deepened, a small kernel of anxiety clustering in his stomach, only to grow bigger with time. How could not everyone have a soul mate? That didn\u2019t seem fair. Was it because there weren\u2019t enough people? Or was it because some people are just impossible to love at all? </p><p>Tony\u2019s voice was small, insecure and anxious, \u201cWill I get soul-mates?\u201d</p><p>Maria gathered him in her arms, pressing kisses into his hair. \u201cDon\u2019t ask questions like that Tony, soul-mates or not, everyone deserves love.\u201d </p><p>He wouldn\u2019t notice until much later that she never really answered his question. Maybe she had known, even then, that he would be difficult to love. </p><!-- more --><p>The day Tony turns ten years old is the most exciting day of his life. He falls asleep when he\u2019s still nine and knows that at 4:35 a.m, the exact time he was born, the writing will appear on his right hand. Whichever person turns ten first triggers the writing for both pairs. If he\u2019s being honest, he\u2019s more excited about his platonic soul-mate than the romantic one. Romance was icky and looked like hard work. Who wanted to always buy flowers all the time? </p><p>The clock ticks its way past ten-thirty p.m, a long time after his bed time. Flipping on his stomach, Tony reaches for his alarm clock, turning the dials to set the alarm for exactly 4:35 a.m. Burying himself into his pillows, Tony waits for the earth to turn. He can\u2019t wait. He just can\u2019t wait. Maybe now he wouldn\u2019t be so lonely all the time. Because now he\u2019d find a best friend <i>and</i> a wife and isn\u2019t that the best combination ever? That\u2019s more than Tony ever wanted. </p><p>He was just tired of being lonely. </p><p>Tony drifts off in a hazy dream. He thinks he catches a glimpse of a little girl with strawberry blonde hair. She looks really pretty. He wakes up before his alarm by only a second, a light burning sensation in his left hand tingling. Tony\u2019s eyes widen, heart battering in this throat as he throws himself off the bed to turn on the lights, watching as a white script with almost curly lettering traces itself along his palm. </p><p><i>Cotton candy rain</i></p><p>Tony furrows his brows before remembering what time it is. Smiling to himself, he watches in fascination as the scope of his soul-mate\u2019s dreams change. So this is the person he would marry? She seems really cute. </p><p>But something bothers him. His right hand isn\u2019t tingling. He scrubs at his palm as though that had anything to do with the process at all but it remains just as blank. That kernel of anxiety pounds into something bigger. Something like dread coiling around it. He has one soul-mate, where\u2019s the other? Why aren\u2019t they connected to him yet? </p><p>Does he just not have one? </p><p>Tony thinks about what will be on his romantic soul-mate\u2019s palm. All the scared thoughts rumbling inside his head. The fears. The insecurities. Immediately, he tries to think of better things. What if she wakes up and thinks those bad things are all about her?? She\u2019d hate him before he ever gets the chance to meet her. And Tony really wants to meet her. More than he wants anything. </p><p>Maybe his platonic soul-mate just comes later. </p><p>Yeah. Maybe that\u2019s it. </p><hr><p>Tony\u2019s platonic soul-mate never comes. </p><p>He\u2019s eighteen now and knows two things. One, Pepper- they couldn\u2019t share their real names- was his soul-mate and he loves her more than anything even though he hasn\u2019t met her yet. Two, he doesn\u2019t need a platonic soul mate or anyone else in the world because he has Rhodey and Rhodey is enough for him. </p><p>The white script flows over his hand, <i>Say I\u2019m just a girl one more time. </i></p><p>Tony winces. He would <i>not</i> want to be the sorry asshole on the other side of that conversation. Without even meaning to, Tony checks his other hand and even though it hasn\u2019t changed in eight years, the blankness still hurts him somewhere farther down than he could hide. His mother tries to tell him that maybe his soul-mate just wasn\u2019t born yet. But Tony knows the truth. He just doesn\u2019t get one. Isn\u2019t worthy of one. Pepper\u2019s just a fluke, some kind of cosmic karma taunting him about how he shouldn\u2019t have any soul-mates, let alone the most wonderful woman in the world. That it\u2019s all just an accident he doesn\u2019t deserve. </p><p><i>Hey. Stop that Tony. I deserve you and only you. </i></p><p>Tony stares at the words, wishing he could brand them on his skin forever. Usually the thoughts appeared automatically, but over the years, Tony and Pepper had learned that if they concentrated hard enough, they could craft their own messages. Tony doesn\u2019t have to try though, for his most sincere appreciation to shine through. \u00a0</p><p>But he knows the truth. His father stopped talking to him the moment he left home, tired of him and unwilling to put up with him. His old socialite circle was grandiose and bursting at the seams, lies upon lies piling up over gossip and half-meant kisses. Even Obadiah, mentor that he was, was never really there when he needed him. Everyone around Tony either loved him and then left him, or never really loved him at all. </p><hr><p>Tony takes over Stark Industries and out of habit, looked down at his right hand and thought this has to be the day. This has to be. But as usual, his skin remains unchanged and he honestly doesn\u2019t know how he can still feel so disappointed every time. He\u2019s hosting interviews today, for the position of his assistant and he\u2019s already tired and really can\u2019t care less. </p><p>And then Virginia Potts walks into the room. \u00a0</p><p>Tony doesn\u2019t know how he knows. Maybe it\u2019s the white blazer suit, the one she had thought about in a choice between it and the blue one. Maybe it\u2019s the crimson writing on her palm she had told him was his colour. Or maybe it\u2019s the way she looks at him that makes him feel like he\u2019s known her his whole life. </p><p>\u201cYou wanna know something really weird?\u201d he asks, smiling at her taken aback expression.</p><p>\u201cDepends.\u201d she answers slowly.</p><p>\u201cI only have one soul-mate and it\u2019s this girl who has Maroon 5 stuck in her head so much my entire hand is just She Will Be Loved lyrics.\u201d </p><p>She pauses, narrowing her eyes like she almost doesn\u2019t want to believe it. \u201cThat\u2019s weird. My soul-mate always complains about the same thing as though heavy metal is any better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-the peak of music.\u201d they say together, and Tony gapes.</p><p>Pepper smiles. \u201cSo I\u2019ve been told anyway.\u201d </p><p>Pepper lifts her hand, showing Tony his own thoughts. <i>Oh my God it\u2019s her. She\u2019s beautiful.</i></p><p>When he runs to hug her, he tries not to let anything ruin the joy coursing through him, even when he catches a glimpse of bright green hand-writing on Pepper\u2019s other hand <i>YOU FOUND YOUR SOUL-MATE AHHHH!!!</i></p><p>Tony doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s ever felt happier than kissing Pepper for the first time. And yet he still feels half-way happy. Missing some crucial part of himself that he was robbed of. </p><p>But Tony has Pepper. </p><p>Maybe that could be enough. </p><hr><p>On August 10, everything changes. </p><p>Tony\u2019s forty-one now. He\u2019s married Pepper, a small quiet wedding with just their closest circles. Stark Industries has delved into automated weaponry, and despite everything, Tony\u2019s come to terms now, finally, that he can still be loved even without any writing on his right hand. </p><p>He\u2019s making a sandwich to bring back down to the lab when his right hand burns. Jolting, he drops the knife with a hiss, bringing his hand up to see where he had cut it when he freezes. It\u2019s impossible. It\u2019s utterly impossible but- scratchy blue writing scrawls across his hand, <i>!!!!!</i>. </p><p>Tony\u2019s hand shakes. No. There\u2019s no- there\u2019s no way. Thirty years later, there\u2019s no way- there just- there just isn\u2019t- but the words keep changing, faster and faster. <i>I have a soul-mate. Oh my god! Oh my God! Wow! I have TWO soul-mates! </i></p><p>Tony feels his eyes warm with disbelief, tears pooling at the edge of his lashes. He can\u2019t stop staring at the blue writing curving all around his hand as his soul-mate\u2019s thoughts get more and more out of control. Pepper\u2019s thoughts had always been more constrained, elegant almost, even when they were kids. But whoever\u2019s thoughts are on his hand jumps from one idea to the next, a flurry of energy and vitality that brings up every repressed emotion Tony had hidden deep inside come flooding to the surface.</p><p>He has a soul-mate. He has a soul-mate. They appeared for him. He isn\u2019t unloved. He isn\u2019t a flaw in the universe. He\u2019s- he\u2019s whole. </p><p>The tears wash down his cheeks as Tony closes his eyes, bringing his hands up to his face. His whole life, he had felt like some part of him was missing. That there was something he was supposed to be looking for. And now- </p><p><i>Don\u2019t be sad anymore. Your writing is so sad.</i></p><p>Tony\u2019s mouth trembles. The writing shifting again, <i>How do I cheer them up? A joke? </i></p><p>Two seconds later, <i>I don\u2019t know any jokes though\u2026maybe Ben knows some!</i></p><p>Unprompted, the only thought in Tony\u2019s head is, <i>I don\u2019t even know who this person is, but I love them.</i></p><p><i>I love you too!!</i></p><p>And this time, Tony allows himself to laugh, incredulous and thankful. He\u2019s forty-one when his platonic soul-mate sends their first message. His mother was right, Tony had just needed to wait. The universe had never abandoned it him. It was just waiting to give him the perfect person. But this kid\u2026how can Tony be perfect for him? How can he possibly be deserving of being in a child\u2019s life? A kid so happy it\u2019s almost contagious. </p><p>What is a soul-mate? A person whose atoms are made up from the same star you were born from? A person who has one half of your very own soul? A person you never abandon, no matter what? Maybe the universe gave this kid to Tony to prove he still has love to give in a way he never thought he could have. But maybe one day, this child would need him. Maybe not right now, maybe not that second, but sometime, in the future, they would meet, and Tony knows he\u2019s going to spend every moment trying to make that happen and be there for this kid. </p><p><i>I can\u2019t wait to meet you. </i>He can\u2019t help but think.</p><p><i>Me too! I live at</i></p><p>The text cuts off and Tony smiles in spite of himself. He doesn\u2019t know the tricks of the trade yet and it was somehow more endearing than it should\u2019ve been.</p><p><i>You can\u2019t say anything personal except your name yet kiddo </i></p><p><i>That\u2019s dumb. Rules are dumb. Super duper dumb.</i></p><p>Tony snorts. The kid\u2019ll learn to control his thoughts more one day, but as it is, it\u2019s adorable watching him. Tony takes in a breath, still unable to help his smile. He concentrates his thoughts. </p><p><i>I\u2019m Tony</i>. </p><p><i>My name\u2019s Peter! Do I get to meet you soon?? </i></p><p><i>I want to meet you.</i></p><p><i>Is that weird to say?</i></p><p><i>Oh no, you\u2019re gonna see everything I think. </i></p><p><i>Tony!!</i></p><p>Tony bursts out laughing and he doesn\u2019t know how his entire heart can expand until its swelled with adoration over someone he hasn\u2019t met yet. </p><p><i>!!!</i></p><p><i>That\u2019s so nice</i></p><p><i>Wow</i></p><p>Embarrassed, Tony quickly quiets his mind. No need to traumatize the kid with all his issues and troubles with love. </p><p><i>When you\u2019re older, you\u2019ll get better at only letting certain thoughts appear</i></p><p><i>Wait are you old? My soul-mate\u2019s old??</i></p><p><i>I didn\u2019t know that could happen</i></p><p><i>Hey-</i></p><p><i>I\u2019m old, but not that old </i></p><p>Peter keeps on chattering and Tony counts down the days before the universe brings them together.</p><hr><p>It\u2019s a while later, after Peter\u2019s next birthday- his excitement made Tony smile- when Tony finds out just how deep Obadiah\u2019s betrayal went. He sees the files upon files of under the table deals. Weapons sold to terrorists and warlords and profiteers of senseless violence and death. He traces each deal to an attack that killed more innocents than he could count from all parts of the globe. Stark Industries wasn\u2019t protecting anybody. They were tools of murder. </p><p>Tony can\u2019t move. He\u2019s frozen in his chair. He\u2019s<b> </b>the CEO, he\u2019s the one in charge, he\u2019s the one who had been duped all these years by that lying, two-faced son of a bitch. Shit. He really is the worst. Scum. Garbage. How many people died because of him? How much blood is on his hands? What could he have done better- god it was always about what he could\u2019ve done better. Always playing catch up. </p><p>He thought he was the good guy. Turns out he\u2019d been the villain all along. The universe was wrong. He isn\u2019t worthy of love. He doesn\u2019t deserve it. Smartest man alive. Kid genius. The most brilliant mind of our generation. All that means nothing if he can\u2019t use that so called genius for anything that <b>matters</b>.</p><p>Tony\u2019s head falls into his hands and he shakes. There are no tears. No sobs. He just trembles under the weight of everything he could\u2019ve done differently and wishes he could shake hard enough for everything inside of him to fall right out so his guilt doesn\u2019t consume him whole. He should\u2019ve been better. He should\u2019ve been better. </p><p>His right hand burns. </p><p>It stings with such a fierce intensity that it jerks him out of his self-pity. He stares at the blue writing, usually messily scrawled and quick, now bold and in all capitals, looking crisp and authoritative. </p><p><i>You are not a bad person</i></p><p><i>You are not a bad person</i></p><p><i>You are not a bad person</i></p><p>Every time the thought seems to disappear, the words come back bolder, like Peter\u2019s focusing desperately on keeping that one thought coherent. Demanding Tony to read it. Demanding he accept it. Tony watches as Peter battles with his constant stream of ideas to present just this one and he can imagine a little boy, scrunching his face in concentration, clutching his wrist, working so damn <i>hard</i> so that someone like <i>Tony </i>would hear him. </p><p>The tears finally well up in his eyes and Tony can\u2019t help but feel worse because here he was bringing this little kid down. The kid Tony promised to protect is trying to protect him and he really is the <i>worst</i>. </p><p><i>Not the worst. </i></p><p><i>You\u2019re the best Tony</i></p><p><i>The best the best the best </i></p><p><i>I\u2019m your soul mate so I\u2019ll love you forever even if you don\u2019t love yourself yet</i></p><p><i>May says sometimes that takes a while </i></p><p><i>But I\u2019ll tell you everything I love about you</i></p><p><i>Because you\u2019re good </i></p><p><i>You\u2019re good Tony, you\u2019re good</i></p><p><i>You made good jokes</i></p><p><i>You give me better advice than Ned</i></p><p><i>You\u2019re so smart! Sometimes I see words I don\u2019t even know how to say on my hand and I\u2019m like woahhh!!</i></p><p><i>And you always say nice things to me</i></p><p><i>And you give me funny nicknames</i></p><p><i>No one gives me nicknames so I really like that </i></p><p><i>You\u2019re a good person</i></p><p><i>I know it</i></p><p>Peter\u2019s writing flourishes on his palm almost faster than Tony can read them all and the tears come down harder when Peter doesn\u2019t seem to run out of things to say. He keeps pouring out love and Tony tries desperately to receive it and he thinks maybe he was wrong about what the universe had intended. Maybe he wasn\u2019t meant to save Peter, maybe Peter was meant to save him. Over and over, Peter tells him he can be good. That he <i>is</i> good. And Peter thinks of Tony and thinks about the power of the sun and the wind and the might of the ocean. Tony Stark can do anything and for the first time in his life, Tony believes it. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t feel like a good person. He doesn\u2019t feel anything but guilt and regret. But Peter thinks he\u2019s good. And for Peter, Tony would change the world. </p><p>Tony grits his teeth. Wipes his eyes. Gets up from the floor. He marches down to his lab, ready to unleash hell and turn the entire company around. This isn\u2019t the legacy he\u2019s going to leave behind. He\u2019s done with the world of war and blood. Peter is going to grow up in a world of peace. Tony will make sure of it. </p><p>It\u2019s all over the news the next day. </p><p>STARK INDUSTRIES SHAKEN BY SHOCKING REVELATIONS OF OBADIAH STANE\u2019S DEALS WITH TERRORISTS</p><p>TONY STARK, CEO OF STARK INDUSTRIES, EXPOSES STANE\u2019S WRONGDOING AT BOARD MEMBER\u2019S MEETING </p><p>STARK INDUSTRIES TO SHUT DOWN THE WEAPONS DIVISION EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY </p><p>TONY STARK, CRAZY? OR JUST STUPID? </p><p>CEO TONY STARK TAKES THE MANTLE OF SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE ENTERPRISE TOO SERIOUSLY? </p><p>The media can say whatever they want. They can call him crazy or stupid or the worst thing to happen to business since the housing bubble, but Tony doesn\u2019t care. Peter said he was a good person. And he intended on making sure he was right. </p><hr><p>It\u2019s three years later and Tony\u2019s been delighted with hearing the literal stream of consciousness from Peter over his first crush- a black haired girl named Lindsay,- his adventures in the world of Lego- ridiculous,- and every little dorky thing a nerd kid would get up to in his life. Bored at a meeting or needing a break from the mundane, Tony knows he can just glance at his hand for a good pick me up. </p><p>Peter\u2019s gotten better at controlling his thoughts now. Tony\u2019s hand is no longer an eternally marred canvas, but Peter\u2019s thoughts are still hilariously out of control. Which is why when the blue splatters across his hand Tony almost chuckles before he really reads what\u2019s going on.</p><p><i>No. No nonono no no nono please</i></p><p><i>Please please </i></p><p><i>Ben</i></p><p><i>Ben</i></p><p><i>Oh no </i></p><p><i>Please don\u2019t go please don\u2019t-</i></p><p>Tony\u2019s hand trembles. He clutches it in his left, unable to stop staring at the horror unfolding across his skin. Peter\u2019s in pain. Soul-mates can\u2019t feel each other but Tony can see Peter unraveling anyway. The writing smudges on his palm like Peter\u2019s barely coherent. Tony thinks he can make out the word \u2018no\u2019 and \u2018please\u2019 but mostly it\u2019s Ben\u2019s name, blurred on his hand like he\u2019s seeing through tears. </p><p><i>I need help</i></p><p><i>I need help</i></p><p><i>Someone help me please</i></p><p><i>HELP ME</i></p><p>Tony clenches his jaw, a frustrated growl in the back of his throat. Running, he surges into his lab, throwing himself onto his chair, fingers clattering against the keyboard. \u201cJARVIS call emergency responders tell them-\u201d Tony trails off. </p><p>Tell them what? That there\u2019s a kid somewhere crying about his uncle? Crying over what? What happened? Who else was there? More importantly, <i>where</i> was there. Tony\u2019s heart tremors, he sucks in a breath. He feels like his lungs have shrunk inside him. That the air\u2019s disappeared. His right hand is still on fire, the blue has now consumed his palm, there are barely any distinguishable words from how many of them there are and all Tony can do is press his hand to his lips and rock himself back and forth.</p><p><i>I\u2019m sorry</i></p><p><i>I\u2019m sorry</i></p><p><i>I\u2019m sorry Peter </i></p><p><i>God I\u2019m so sorry</i></p><p>He watches and waits for a hint, a sign, anything to help him know where Peter is and what happened, a hint, a kernel, just the <i>possibility</i> of being to help him. But the day darkens and Tony gets nothing. Not one useful thing. </p><p>Eventually, the blue melts away and it\u2019s replaced by just one sentence that stays even into the night. </p><p><i>Ben\u2019s dead. </i></p><p><i>My fault. </i></p><p>And Tony shakes. </p><hr><p><i>I don\u2019t want to do this</i></p><p><i>I can\u2019t do this</i></p><p><i>Please Tony</i></p><p><i>Please, please please </i></p><p><i>Make it go away </i></p><p><i>Make it stop </i></p><p><i>I can\u2019t do this</i></p><p>Today\u2019s the day of Ben\u2019s funeral and Tony scours the web for any sign of it, but with no last name, Ben dies with thousands of his name. </p><p>Tony focuses everything he has into crafting the perfect message. He wants to be there. Needs to be there. The second Peter\u2019s writing first appeared he had sworn that he would always look out for him, always be there for him, that he would be better than he ever could be because this was the universe giving him a second chance at love. </p><p><i>You can do it Peter</i></p><p><i>You\u2019re strong and you\u2019re kind and you loved your uncle</i></p><p><i>And he would want you there to see him off </i></p><p><i>And be with your aunt</i></p><p>Peter\u2019s reply is immediate. </p><p><i>It should\u2019ve been me</i></p><p>Tony knows he hadn\u2019t meant to let that slip out. He can tell from how it disappears the second it\u2019s written. But it\u2019s too late. The damage is done. </p><p><i>Don\u2019t say that</i></p><p>Tony doesn\u2019t even have to try and focus. He can\u2019t. Even if he wanted to. There\u2019s something fierce inside him. Something deep and primal and unwilling to ever let go. A desperate love he\u2019s never felt before. </p><p><i>Don\u2019t you ever say that</i></p><p>For the first time in a long time, his thoughts become a wave, they douse Peter\u2019s hand and he can\u2019t stop it.</p><p><i>Your life is worth more than you\u2019ll ever possibly know to your uncle</i></p><p><i>He loved you and he wanted you to live</i></p><p><i>Your life meant everything to him</i></p><p><i>I don\u2019t need to have met him to know that</i></p><p><i>And so now</i></p><p><i>You\u2019re going to go to the funeral</i></p><p><i>You\u2019re going to cry and you\u2019re going to mourn and hug your aunt</i></p><p><i>And then you\u2019re going to live</i></p><p><i>Do you hear me Peter?</i></p><p><i>You\u2019re going to LIVE</i></p><p><i>For your uncle</i></p><p><i>For Ben</i></p><p>And Tony\u2019s feelings are like tidal waves, he can\u2019t stop until he knows Peter understands. He\u2019s never even met the kid but he knows just as certainly as he knows anything in this world that if he were Ben, he would\u2019ve done the exact same thing. That loving someone you have to protect is stronger a force than anything on the planet and that Peter will get through this because he\u2019s still surrounded by love and Tony would make sure of it. </p><p>Unbidden, his thoughts come out before can stop them.</p><p><i>I\u2019m here for you. Now, later, forever. </i></p><p><i>I\u2019m going to find you soon </i></p><p><i>I promise </i></p><p><i>I\u2019m going to </i><b><i>find you</i></b></p><hr><p>Except\u2026Tony\u2019s already tried. He\u2019s tried so many times. But every attempt had failed and the failures were piling atop of him. Crushing and mocking. It\u2019s been months since the funeral and he\u2019s at the exact same place now as he was then. Pen twirling in his hand, Tony stops swiveling in his chair when there\u2019s a knock on his office door. </p><p>The sunlight streams through Pepper\u2019s hair like a halo and Tony\u2019s smile comes as naturally as breathing. \u201cHey Pep.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHey yourself.\u201d she greets, an amused note in her wry smile, \u201cYou know you have a meeting in twenty minutes right?\u201d</p><p>Tony feigns surprise, \u201cWhat? Do I? Must\u2019ve slipped my mind.\u201d he makes a snide face, \u201cNo wait, I just decided it was boring and thought we could play hookie and go get coffee instead. My treat.\u201d he waggles his brows in that way he knew always made her laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou know that we\u2019re married and have a joint account right?\u201d but she grins anyway. \u201cActually, I need you to sign this.\u201d </p><p>Not even needing to look at it, Tony flips to the back, scrawling his name with a bit of a flourish. \u201cIs it possible this is even more boring than the meeting?\u201d </p><p>\u201cDepends.\u201d she shrugs, coy. </p><p>\u201cO-n?\u201d he says, dragging the word.</p><p>Something sparkles in Pepper\u2019s eyes, \u201cOn whether you think hosting a summer intern would be fun or not.\u201d</p><p>Tony groans, sliding in his seat. \u201cWhen did this happen? Is this because I missed dinner a week ago because I told you that Happy refused to listen when I said to avoid traffic and-\u201d</p><p>Pepper holds up a hand. \u201cNo.\u201d she says slowly, \u201cThis is because we\u2019re trying to encourage young minds remember? You know, this was technically your idea.\u201d </p><p>Tony looks aghast. \u201cHow dare you.\u201d </p><p>Laughing, Pepper sits across from him on his desk. \u201cRemember when you said it might be fun to host a competition for kids at the next Stark Expo? I thought we could host something for all ages, it would be cute right? To see a bunch of eight year olds walk in with volcanoes? And then I thought, what should the prize be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain how an internship is a prize.\u201d Tony says, expression flat.</p><p>\u201cWhat high school kid obsessed with tech <i>wouldn\u2019t </i>want to work with Tony Stark.\u201d</p><p>Tony smirks, lazy and slow. \u201cIs that a little hint of admiration I sense Miss. Potts?\u201d </p><p>Pepper smiles into his kiss. \u201cNot admiration, just shaking my head at all the misguided youth.\u201d </p><p>Quickly, she snatches up the papers from his desk. \u201cAnd you already signed anyway, so!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheater!!\u201d </p><p>\u201cAll\u2019s fair sweetie.\u201d And she flashes him that smug expression over her shoulder that makes him want to simultaneously kiss and her and sulk, \u201cAnd get up. The meeting\u2019s in five minutes!\u201d </p><p>Tony\u2019s hand burns. <i>She sure got the better of you huh?</i></p><p><i>Zip it kid</i></p><p>Tony shakes his head to hide his grin. </p><hr><p>The universe as it happened, brims with people destined to be together, but who only truly belonged together at a certain moment. Sometimes the people you love the fiercest are those who, in a different time, in a different place, in a different state of mind, you might never have come to love at all. And Tony\u2019s always loved Peter. From the second he knew he existed, he loved him. </p><p>But the right time. </p><p>The perfect time.</p><p>A time where Tony wasn\u2019t grieving and drinking and falling into pits of self-destruction and a time where Peter wasn\u2019t imploding on the inside with guilt and loss, a time where both of them could come into each other\u2019s lives at the perfect moment to acknowledge the worst but bring out the best had yet to come. And Tony\u2019s finally entered it. And he has never felt more afraid and yet, a deeper, intense need for anything ever before in his life. </p><p>The competition\u2019s started. There are three separate rooms, three separate groups. He enters the Kid\u2019s Corner, full of elementary school kids racing through the booths admiring projects their own parents helped them make. Tony takes photos and high-fives children and encourages one shy girl to give a presentation that makes him feel oddly misty. The second room has middle schoolers, probably the worst age group Tony can think of. Even Peter had his days when he was thirteen. And Peter was the sweetest thing since the sugarcane. To be honest, he\u2019s so busy navigating the crowds and playing the part that he doesn\u2019t really notice the burning in both his hands until he\u2019s standing outside the high schooler\u2019s room.</p><p>Pepper\u2019s cursive writing appears like art on his palm, she\u2019s running through her checklist, making sure everything\u2019s all set and good to go. It\u2019s such a small, common thing. But Tony can\u2019t help but think <i>I love you</i> anyway. Pepper always takes such good care of him. Sometimes he doesn\u2019t know if he deserves it. But he cherishes it anyway. </p><p>He looks to his right hand and furrows his brows, fond. The kid\u2019s freaking out. Nervous about presenting soon and that the lights are on him and there\u2019s no way he can compete with all these rich kids when he\u2019s a dumpster diver but it would be so cool to win the competition and-</p><p>Tony stops. No way. </p><p>No way.</p><p>It\u2019s- it\u2019s impossible.</p><p>But it isn\u2019t. It isn\u2019t impossible. And Tony bursts through the doors, eyes wide, muscles tight, his mouth is open like he wants to shout when the curtains draw open on the stage and everyone stops to stare and Tony stops with them. </p><p>He can barely breathe. </p><p>\u201cPresenting Peter Parker and his chemical invention.\u201d</p><p>Peter Parker. </p><p>Tony claps his hands to his mouth. Emotions bursting through every part of him. He can\u2019t take his eyes off him. Peter. Peter. It\u2019s Peter. Peter Parker. And he\u2019s wonderful. Boyish brown curls, a shy smile, the gangly teenage body that doesn\u2019t quite know how to hold itself in the world. \u201cHi- hi everyone, I\u2019m Peter Parker.\u201d </p><p>He sounds exactly like Tony\u2019s imagined. Young and polite and sweet. So sweet. He\u2019s perfect. He\u2019s absolutely perfect. And he\u2019s happy. And <i>Tony\u2019s</i> happy. So so so happy that he\u2019s here. And that today\u2019s the day. And that even if he doesn\u2019t get to meet him at least he got to see him and that\u2019s enough for Tony. It\u2019s enough. </p><p>But his thoughts must have been too loud. Too emotional and strung and so uncontainable he could power a thousand earths because Peter glances down at his own hand and his eyes widen. His head jerks up. Something like longing in the curve of his brows. Hope that he barely wants to believe. He scans the crowd. Tony and Peter lock eyes and he can tell the exact second that Peter realizes that Tony Stark is his soul-mate. His lip wobbles and he looks like he wants to jump into the crowd and run but Peter\u2019s a better kid than Tony ever was and he just shakes his head slightly, like he\u2019s laughing to himself, glances at his hand, <i>I\u2019m so proud of you</i>, and pushes through his presentation because he knows it has to be done and that they\u2019ll have time later. </p><p>Peter\u2019s brilliant on stage. More brilliant than Tony ever was and he knows that Peter will be even better with time. Peter finishes his speech with a shy duck of the head and the sweetest half smile that has Tony feeling endeared to him all over again where he\u2019s waiting in the wings. Peter catches his eye, smiling so uncontrollably it makes him beam and when the curtains close he launches in Tony\u2019s direction, throwing his arms around him like they\u2019d done this a million times. </p><p>The first time Tony spoke to Peter, he had cried from gratitude. The first time he got to hold him, his arms wrapped so tightly around him, feeling Peter\u2019s fingers around his shoulder, he buries his face in Peter\u2019s hair and feels that same gratefulness, that same adoration, that same love for the universe that loved him after all and showed him he could find and give love in return. </p><p>Tony and Peter hold each other tightly and on both their hands, <i>I finally found you</i>. </p>",

Maybe she had known, even then, that he would be difficult to love. </p>[[MORE]]<p>The day Tony turns ten years old is the most exciting day of his life. He falls asleep when he\u2019s still nine and knows that at 4:35 a.m, the exact time he was born, the writing will appear on his right hand. Whichever person turns ten first triggers the writing for both pairs. If he\u2019s being honest, he\u2019s more excited about his platonic soul-mate than the romantic one. Romance was icky and looked like hard work. Who wanted to always buy flowers all the time? </p><p>The clock ticks its way past ten-thirty p.m, a long time after his bed time. Flipping on his stomach, Tony reaches for his alarm clock, turning the dials to set the alarm for exactly 4:35 a.m. Burying himself into his pillows, Tony waits for the earth to turn. He can\u2019t wait. He just can\u2019t wait. Maybe now he wouldn\u2019t be so lonely all the time. Because now he\u2019d find a best friend <i>and</i> a wife and isn\u2019t that the best combination ever? That\u2019s more than Tony ever wanted. </p><p>He was just tired of being lonely. </p><p>Tony drifts off in a hazy dream. He thinks he catches a glimpse of a little girl with strawberry blonde hair. She looks really pretty. He wakes up before his alarm by only a second, a light burning sensation in his left hand tingling. Tony\u2019s eyes widen, heart battering in this throat as he throws himself off the bed to turn on the lights, watching as a white script with almost curly lettering traces itself along his palm. </p><p><i>Cotton candy rain</i></p><p>Tony furrows his brows before remembering what time it is. Smiling to himself, he watches in fascination as the scope of his soul-mate\u2019s dreams change. So this is the person he would marry? She seems really cute. </p><p>But something bothers him. His right hand isn\u2019t tingling. He scrubs at his palm as though that had anything to do with the process at all but it remains just as blank. That kernel of anxiety pounds into something bigger. Something like dread coiling around it. He has one soul-mate, where\u2019s the other? Why aren\u2019t they connected to him yet? </p><p>Does he just not have one? </p><p>Tony thinks about what will be on his romantic soul-mate\u2019s palm. All the scared thoughts rumbling inside his head. The fears. The insecurities. Immediately, he tries to think of better things. What if she wakes up and thinks those bad things are all about her?? She\u2019d hate him before he ever gets the chance to meet her. And Tony really wants to meet her. More than he wants anything. </p><p>Maybe his platonic soul-mate just comes later. </p><p>Yeah. Maybe that\u2019s it. </p><hr><p>Tony\u2019s platonic soul-mate never comes. </p><p>He\u2019s eighteen now and knows two things. One, Pepper- they couldn\u2019t share their real names- was his soul-mate and he loves her more than anything even though he hasn\u2019t met her yet. Two, he doesn\u2019t need a platonic soul mate or anyone else in the world because he has Rhodey and Rhodey is enough for him. </p><p>The white script flows over his hand, <i>Say I\u2019m just a girl one more time. </i></p><p>Tony winces. He would <i>not</i> want to be the sorry asshole on the other side of that conversation. Without even meaning to, Tony checks his other hand and even though it hasn\u2019t changed in eight years, the blankness still hurts him somewhere farther down than he could hide. His mother tries to tell him that maybe his soul-mate just wasn\u2019t born yet. But Tony knows the truth. He just doesn\u2019t get one. Isn\u2019t worthy of one. Pepper\u2019s just a fluke, some kind of cosmic karma taunting him about how he shouldn\u2019t have any soul-mates, let alone the most wonderful woman in the world. That it\u2019s all just an accident he doesn\u2019t deserve. </p><p><i>Hey. Stop that Tony. I deserve you and only you. </i></p><p>Tony stares at the words, wishing he could brand them on his skin forever. Usually the thoughts appeared automatically, but over the years, Tony and Pepper had learned that if they concentrated hard enough, they could craft their own messages. Tony doesn\u2019t have to try though, for his most sincere appreciation to shine through. \u00a0</p><p>But he knows the truth. His father stopped talking to him the moment he left home, tired of him and unwilling to put up with him. His old socialite circle was grandiose and bursting at the seams, lies upon lies piling up over gossip and half-meant kisses. Even Obadiah, mentor that he was, was never really there when he needed him. Everyone around Tony either loved him and then left him, or never really loved him at all. </p><hr><p>Tony takes over Stark Industries and out of habit, looked down at his right hand and thought this has to be the day. This has to be. But as usual, his skin remains unchanged and he honestly doesn\u2019t know how he can still feel so disappointed every time. He\u2019s hosting interviews today, for the position of his assistant and he\u2019s already tired and really can\u2019t care less. </p><p>And then Virginia Potts walks into the room. \u00a0</p><p>Tony doesn\u2019t know how he knows. Maybe it\u2019s the white blazer suit, the one she had thought about in a choice between it and the blue one. Maybe it\u2019s the crimson writing on her palm she had told him was his colour. Or maybe it\u2019s the way she looks at him that makes him feel like he\u2019s known her his whole life. </p><p>\u201cYou wanna know something really weird?\u201d he asks, smiling at her taken aback expression.</p><p>\u201cDepends.\u201d she answers slowly.</p><p>\u201cI only have one soul-mate and it\u2019s this girl who has Maroon 5 stuck in her head so much my entire hand is just She Will Be Loved lyrics.\u201d </p><p>She pauses, narrowing her eyes like she almost doesn\u2019t want to believe it. \u201cThat\u2019s weird. My soul-mate always complains about the same thing as though heavy metal is any better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-the peak of music.\u201d they say together, and Tony gapes.</p><p>Pepper smiles. \u201cSo I\u2019ve been told anyway.\u201d </p><p>Pepper lifts her hand, showing Tony his own thoughts. <i>Oh my God it\u2019s her. She\u2019s beautiful.</i></p><p>When he runs to hug her, he tries not to let anything ruin the joy coursing through him, even when he catches a glimpse of bright green hand-writing on Pepper\u2019s other hand <i>YOU FOUND YOUR SOUL-MATE AHHHH!!!</i></p><p>Tony doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s ever felt happier than kissing Pepper for the first time. And yet he still feels half-way happy. Missing some crucial part of himself that he was robbed of. </p><p>But Tony has Pepper. </p><p>Maybe that could be enough. </p><hr><p>On August 10, everything changes. </p><p>Tony\u2019s forty-one now. He\u2019s married Pepper, a small quiet wedding with just their closest circles. Stark Industries has delved into automated weaponry, and despite everything, Tony\u2019s come to terms now, finally, that he can still be loved even without any writing on his right hand. </p><p>He\u2019s making a sandwich to bring back down to the lab when his right hand burns. Jolting, he drops the knife with a hiss, bringing his hand up to see where he had cut it when he freezes. It\u2019s impossible. It\u2019s utterly impossible but- scratchy blue writing scrawls across his hand, <i>!!!!!</i>. </p><p>Tony\u2019s hand shakes. No. There\u2019s no- there\u2019s no way. Thirty years later, there\u2019s no way- there just- there just isn\u2019t- but the words keep changing, faster and faster. <i>I have a soul-mate. Oh my god! Oh my God! Wow! I have TWO soul-mates! </i></p><p>Tony feels his eyes warm with disbelief, tears pooling at the edge of his lashes. He can\u2019t stop staring at the blue writing curving all around his hand as his soul-mate\u2019s thoughts get more and more out of control. Pepper\u2019s thoughts had always been more constrained, elegant almost, even when they were kids. But whoever\u2019s thoughts are on his hand jumps from one idea to the next, a flurry of energy and vitality that brings up every repressed emotion Tony had hidden deep inside come flooding to the surface.</p><p>He has a soul-mate. He has a soul-mate. They appeared for him. He isn\u2019t unloved. He isn\u2019t a flaw in the universe. He\u2019s- he\u2019s whole. </p><p>The tears wash down his cheeks as Tony closes his eyes, bringing his hands up to his face. His whole life, he had felt like some part of him was missing. That there was something he was supposed to be looking for. And now- </p><p><i>Don\u2019t be sad anymore. Your writing is so sad.</i></p><p>Tony\u2019s mouth trembles. The writing shifting again, <i>How do I cheer them up? A joke? </i></p><p>Two seconds later, <i>I don\u2019t know any jokes though\u2026maybe Ben knows some!</i></p><p>Unprompted, the only thought in Tony\u2019s head is, <i>I don\u2019t even know who this person is, but I love them.</i></p><p><i>I love you too!!</i></p><p>And this time, Tony allows himself to laugh, incredulous and thankful. He\u2019s forty-one when his platonic soul-mate sends their first message. His mother was right, Tony had just needed to wait. The universe had never abandoned it him. It was just waiting to give him the perfect person. But this kid\u2026how can Tony be perfect for him? How can he possibly be deserving of being in a child\u2019s life? A kid so happy it\u2019s almost contagious. </p><p>What is a soul-mate? A person whose atoms are made up from the same star you were born from? A person who has one half of your very own soul? A person you never abandon, no matter what? Maybe the universe gave this kid to Tony to prove he still has love to give in a way he never thought he could have. But maybe one day, this child would need him. Maybe not right now, maybe not that second, but sometime, in the future, they would meet, and Tony knows he\u2019s going to spend every moment trying to make that happen and be there for this kid. </p><p><i>I can\u2019t wait to meet you. </i>He can\u2019t help but think.</p><p><i>Me too! I live at</i></p><p>The text cuts off and Tony smiles in spite of himself. He doesn\u2019t know the tricks of the trade yet and it was somehow more endearing than it should\u2019ve been.</p><p><i>You can\u2019t say anything personal except your name yet kiddo </i></p><p><i>That\u2019s dumb. Rules are dumb. Super duper dumb.</i></p><p>Tony snorts. The kid\u2019ll learn to control his thoughts more one day, but as it is, it\u2019s adorable watching him. Tony takes in a breath, still unable to help his smile. He concentrates his thoughts. </p><p><i>I\u2019m Tony</i>. </p><p><i>My name\u2019s Peter! Do I get to meet you soon?? </i></p><p><i>I want to meet you.</i></p><p><i>Is that weird to say?</i></p><p><i>Oh no, you\u2019re gonna see everything I think. </i></p><p><i>Tony!!</i></p><p>Tony bursts out laughing and he doesn\u2019t know how his entire heart can expand until its swelled with adoration over someone he hasn\u2019t met yet. </p><p><i>!!!</i></p><p><i>That\u2019s so nice</i></p><p><i>Wow</i></p><p>Embarrassed, Tony quickly quiets his mind. No need to traumatize the kid with all his issues and troubles with love. </p><p><i>When you\u2019re older, you\u2019ll get better at only letting certain thoughts appear</i></p><p><i>Wait are you old? My soul-mate\u2019s old??</i></p><p><i>I didn\u2019t know that could happen</i></p><p><i>Hey-</i></p><p><i>I\u2019m old, but not that old </i></p><p>Peter keeps on chattering and Tony counts down the days before the universe brings them together.</p><hr><p>It\u2019s a while later, after Peter\u2019s next birthday- his excitement made Tony smile- when Tony finds out just how deep Obadiah\u2019s betrayal went. He sees the files upon files of under the table deals. Weapons sold to terrorists and warlords and profiteers of senseless violence and death. He traces each deal to an attack that killed more innocents than he could count from all parts of the globe. Stark Industries wasn\u2019t protecting anybody. They were tools of murder. </p><p>Tony can\u2019t move. He\u2019s frozen in his chair. He\u2019s<b> </b>the CEO, he\u2019s the one in charge, he\u2019s the one who had been duped all these years by that lying, two-faced son of a bitch. Shit. He really is the worst. Scum. Garbage. How many people died because of him? How much blood is on his hands? What could he have done better- god it was always about what he could\u2019ve done better. Always playing catch up. </p><p>He thought he was the good guy. Turns out he\u2019d been the villain all along. The universe was wrong. He isn\u2019t worthy of love. He doesn\u2019t deserve it. Smartest man alive. Kid genius. The most brilliant mind of our generation. All that means nothing if he can\u2019t use that so called genius for anything that <b>matters</b>.</p><p>Tony\u2019s head falls into his hands and he shakes. There are no tears. No sobs. He just trembles under the weight of everything he could\u2019ve done differently and wishes he could shake hard enough for everything inside of him to fall right out so his guilt doesn\u2019t consume him whole. He should\u2019ve been better. He should\u2019ve been better. </p><p>His right hand burns. </p><p>It stings with such a fierce intensity that it jerks him out of his self-pity. He stares at the blue writing, usually messily scrawled and quick, now bold and in all capitals, looking crisp and authoritative. </p><p><i>You are not a bad person</i></p><p><i>You are not a bad person</i></p><p><i>You are not a bad person</i></p><p>Every time the thought seems to disappear, the words come back bolder, like Peter\u2019s focusing desperately on keeping that one thought coherent. Demanding Tony to read it. Demanding he accept it. Tony watches as Peter battles with his constant stream of ideas to present just this one and he can imagine a little boy, scrunching his face in concentration, clutching his wrist, working so damn <i>hard</i> so that someone like <i>Tony </i>would hear him. </p><p>The tears finally well up in his eyes and Tony can\u2019t help but feel worse because here he was bringing this little kid down. The kid Tony promised to protect is trying to protect him and he really is the <i>worst</i>. </p><p><i>Not the worst. </i></p><p><i>You\u2019re the best Tony</i></p><p><i>The best the best the best </i></p><p><i>I\u2019m your soul mate so I\u2019ll love you forever even if you don\u2019t love yourself yet</i></p><p><i>May says sometimes that takes a while </i></p><p><i>But I\u2019ll tell you everything I love about you</i></p><p><i>Because you\u2019re good </i></p><p><i>You\u2019re good Tony, you\u2019re good</i></p><p><i>You made good jokes</i></p><p><i>You give me better advice than Ned</i></p><p><i>You\u2019re so smart! Sometimes I see words I don\u2019t even know how to say on my hand and I\u2019m like woahhh!!</i></p><p><i>And you always say nice things to me</i></p><p><i>And you give me funny nicknames</i></p><p><i>No one gives me nicknames so I really like that </i></p><p><i>You\u2019re a good person</i></p><p><i>I know it</i></p><p>Peter\u2019s writing flourishes on his palm almost faster than Tony can read them all and the tears come down harder when Peter doesn\u2019t seem to run out of things to say. He keeps pouring out love and Tony tries desperately to receive it and he thinks maybe he was wrong about what the universe had intended. Maybe he wasn\u2019t meant to save Peter, maybe Peter was meant to save him. Over and over, Peter tells him he can be good. That he <i>is</i> good. And Peter thinks of Tony and thinks about the power of the sun and the wind and the might of the ocean. Tony Stark can do anything and for the first time in his life, Tony believes it. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t feel like a good person. He doesn\u2019t feel anything but guilt and regret. But Peter thinks he\u2019s good. And for Peter, Tony would change the world. </p><p>Tony grits his teeth. Wipes his eyes. Gets up from the floor. He marches down to his lab, ready to unleash hell and turn the entire company around. This isn\u2019t the legacy he\u2019s going to leave behind. He\u2019s done with the world of war and blood. Peter is going to grow up in a world of peace. Tony will make sure of it. </p><p>It\u2019s all over the news the next day. </p><p>STARK INDUSTRIES SHAKEN BY SHOCKING REVELATIONS OF OBADIAH STANE\u2019S DEALS WITH TERRORISTS</p><p>TONY STARK, CEO OF STARK INDUSTRIES, EXPOSES STANE\u2019S WRONGDOING AT BOARD MEMBER\u2019S MEETING </p><p>STARK INDUSTRIES TO SHUT DOWN THE WEAPONS DIVISION EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY </p><p>TONY STARK, CRAZY?

They can call him crazy or stupid or the worst thing to happen to business since the housing bubble, but Tony doesn\u2019t care. Peter said he was a good person. And he intended on making sure he was right. </p><hr><p>It\u2019s three years later and Tony\u2019s been delighted with hearing the literal stream of consciousness from Peter over his first crush- a black haired girl named Lindsay,- his adventures in the world of Lego- ridiculous,- and every little dorky thing a nerd kid would get up to in his life. Bored at a meeting or needing a break from the mundane, Tony knows he can just glance at his hand for a good pick me up. </p><p>Peter\u2019s gotten better at controlling his thoughts now. Tony\u2019s hand is no longer an eternally marred canvas, but Peter\u2019s thoughts are still hilariously out of control. Which is why when the blue splatters across his hand Tony almost chuckles before he really reads what\u2019s going on.</p><p><i>No. No nonono no no nono please</i></p><p><i>Please please </i></p><p><i>Ben</i></p><p><i>Ben</i></p><p><i>Oh no </i></p><p><i>Please don\u2019t go please don\u2019t-</i></p><p>Tony\u2019s hand trembles. He clutches it in his left, unable to stop staring at the horror unfolding across his skin. Peter\u2019s in pain. Soul-mates can\u2019t feel each other but Tony can see Peter unraveling anyway. The writing smudges on his palm like Peter\u2019s barely coherent. Tony thinks he can make out the word \u2018no\u2019 and \u2018please\u2019 but mostly it\u2019s Ben\u2019s name, blurred on his hand like he\u2019s seeing through tears. </p><p><i>I need help</i></p><p><i>I need help</i></p><p><i>Someone help me please</i></p><p><i>HELP ME</i></p><p>Tony clenches his jaw, a frustrated growl in the back of his throat. Running, he surges into his lab, throwing himself onto his chair, fingers clattering against the keyboard. \u201cJARVIS call emergency responders tell them-\u201d Tony trails off. </p><p>Tell them what? That there\u2019s a kid somewhere crying about his uncle? Crying over what? What happened? Who else was there? More importantly, <i>where</i> was there. Tony\u2019s heart tremors, he sucks in a breath. He feels like his lungs have shrunk inside him. That the air\u2019s disappeared. His right hand is still on fire, the blue has now consumed his palm, there are barely any distinguishable words from how many of them there are and all Tony can do is press his hand to his lips and rock himself back and forth.</p><p><i>I\u2019m sorry</i></p><p><i>I\u2019m sorry</i></p><p><i>I\u2019m sorry Peter </i></p><p><i>God I\u2019m so sorry</i></p><p>He watches and waits for a hint, a sign, anything to help him know where Peter is and what happened, a hint, a kernel, just the <i>possibility</i> of being to help him. But the day darkens and Tony gets nothing. Not one useful thing. </p><p>Eventually, the blue melts away and it\u2019s replaced by just one sentence that stays even into the night. </p><p><i>Ben\u2019s dead. </i></p><p><i>My fault. </i></p><p>And Tony shakes. </p><hr><p><i>I don\u2019t want to do this</i></p><p><i>I can\u2019t do this</i></p><p><i>Please Tony</i></p><p><i>Please, please please </i></p><p><i>Make it go away </i></p><p><i>Make it stop </i></p><p><i>I can\u2019t do this</i></p><p>Today\u2019s the day of Ben\u2019s funeral and Tony scours the web for any sign of it, but with no last name, Ben dies with thousands of his name. </p><p>Tony focuses everything he has into crafting the perfect message. He wants to be there. Needs to be there. The second Peter\u2019s writing first appeared he had sworn that he would always look out for him, always be there for him, that he would be better than he ever could be because this was the universe giving him a second chance at love. </p><p><i>You can do it Peter</i></p><p><i>You\u2019re strong and you\u2019re kind and you loved your uncle</i></p><p><i>And he would want you there to see him off </i></p><p><i>And be with your aunt</i></p><p>Peter\u2019s reply is immediate. </p><p><i>It should\u2019ve been me</i></p><p>Tony knows he hadn\u2019t meant to let that slip out. He can tell from how it disappears the second it\u2019s written. But it\u2019s too late. The damage is done. </p><p><i>Don\u2019t say that</i></p><p>Tony doesn\u2019t even have to try and focus. He can\u2019t. Even if he wanted to. There\u2019s something fierce inside him. Something deep and primal and unwilling to ever let go. A desperate love he\u2019s never felt before. </p><p><i>Don\u2019t you ever say that</i></p><p>For the first time in a long time, his thoughts become a wave, they douse Peter\u2019s hand and he can\u2019t stop it.</p><p><i>Your life is worth more than you\u2019ll ever possibly know to your uncle</i></p><p><i>He loved you and he wanted you to live</i></p><p><i>Your life meant everything to him</i></p><p><i>I don\u2019t need to have met him to know that</i></p><p><i>And so now</i></p><p><i>You\u2019re going to go to the funeral</i></p><p><i>You\u2019re going to cry and you\u2019re going to mourn and hug your aunt</i></p><p><i>And then you\u2019re going to live</i></p><p><i>Do you hear me Peter?</i></p><p><i>You\u2019re going to LIVE</i></p><p><i>For your uncle</i></p><p><i>For Ben</i></p><p>And Tony\u2019s feelings are like tidal waves, he can\u2019t stop until he knows Peter understands. He\u2019s never even met the kid but he knows just as certainly as he knows anything in this world that if he were Ben, he would\u2019ve done the exact same thing. That loving someone you have to protect is stronger a force than anything on the planet and that Peter will get through this because he\u2019s still surrounded by love and Tony would make sure of it. </p><p>Unbidden, his thoughts come out before can stop them.</p><p><i>I\u2019m here for you. Now, later, forever. </i></p><p><i>I\u2019m going to find you soon </i></p><p><i>I promise </i></p><p><i>I\u2019m going to </i><b><i>find you</i></b></p><hr><p>Except\u2026Tony\u2019s already tried. He\u2019s tried so many times. But every attempt had failed and the failures were piling atop of him. Crushing and mocking. It\u2019s been months since the funeral and he\u2019s at the exact same place now as he was then. Pen twirling in his hand, Tony stops swiveling in his chair when there\u2019s a knock on his office door. </p><p>The sunlight streams through Pepper\u2019s hair like a halo and Tony\u2019s smile comes as naturally as breathing. \u201cHey Pep.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHey yourself.\u201d she greets, an amused note in her wry smile, \u201cYou know you have a meeting in twenty minutes right?\u201d</p><p>Tony feigns surprise, \u201cWhat? Do I? Must\u2019ve slipped my mind.\u201d he makes a snide face, \u201cNo wait, I just decided it was boring and thought we could play hookie and go get coffee instead. My treat.\u201d he waggles his brows in that way he knew always made her laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou know that we\u2019re married and have a joint account right?\u201d but she grins anyway. \u201cActually, I need you to sign this.\u201d </p><p>Not even needing to look at it, Tony flips to the back, scrawling his name with a bit of a flourish. \u201cIs it possible this is even more boring than the meeting?\u201d </p><p>\u201cDepends.\u201d she shrugs, coy. </p><p>\u201cO-n?\u201d he says, dragging the word.</p><p>Something sparkles in Pepper\u2019s eyes, \u201cOn whether you think hosting a summer intern would be fun or not.\u201d</p><p>Tony groans, sliding in his seat. \u201cWhen did this happen? Is this because I missed dinner a week ago because I told you that Happy refused to listen when I said to avoid traffic and-\u201d</p><p>Pepper holds up a hand. \u201cNo.\u201d she says slowly, \u201cThis is because we\u2019re trying to encourage young minds remember? You know, this was technically your idea.\u201d </p><p>Tony looks aghast. \u201cHow dare you.\u201d </p><p>Laughing, Pepper sits across from him on his desk. \u201cRemember when you said it might be fun to host a competition for kids at the next Stark Expo? I thought we could host something for all ages, it would be cute right? To see a bunch of eight year olds walk in with volcanoes? And then I thought, what should the prize be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain how an internship is a prize.\u201d Tony says, expression flat.</p><p>\u201cWhat high school kid obsessed with tech <i>wouldn\u2019t </i>want to work with Tony Stark.\u201d</p><p>Tony smirks, lazy and slow. \u201cIs that a little hint of admiration I sense Miss. Potts?\u201d </p><p>Pepper smiles into his kiss. \u201cNot admiration, just shaking my head at all the misguided youth.\u201d </p><p>Quickly, she snatches up the papers from his desk. \u201cAnd you already signed anyway, so!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheater!!\u201d </p><p>\u201cAll\u2019s fair sweetie.\u201d And she flashes him that smug expression over her shoulder that makes him want to simultaneously kiss and her and sulk, \u201cAnd get up. The meeting\u2019s in five minutes!\u201d </p><p>Tony\u2019s hand burns. <i>She sure got the better of you huh?</i></p><p><i>Zip it kid</i></p><p>Tony shakes his head to hide his grin. </p><hr><p>The universe as it happened, brims with people destined to be together, but who only truly belonged together at a certain moment. Sometimes the people you love the fiercest are those who, in a different time, in a different place, in a different state of mind, you might never have come to love at all. And Tony\u2019s always loved Peter. From the second he knew he existed, he loved him. </p><p>But the right time. </p><p>The perfect time.</p><p>A time where Tony wasn\u2019t grieving and drinking and falling into pits of self-destruction and a time where Peter wasn\u2019t imploding on the inside with guilt and loss, a time where both of them could come into each other\u2019s lives at the perfect moment to acknowledge the worst but bring out the best had yet to come. And Tony\u2019s finally entered it. And he has never felt more afraid and yet, a deeper, intense need for anything ever before in his life. </p><p>The competition\u2019s started. There are three separate rooms, three separate groups. He enters the Kid\u2019s Corner, full of elementary school kids racing through the booths admiring projects their own parents helped them make. Tony takes photos and high-fives children and encourages one shy girl to give a presentation that makes him feel oddly misty. The second room has middle schoolers, probably the worst age group Tony can think of. Even Peter had his days when he was thirteen. And Peter was the sweetest thing since the sugarcane. To be honest, he\u2019s so busy navigating the crowds and playing the part that he doesn\u2019t really notice the burning in both his hands until he\u2019s standing outside the high schooler\u2019s room.</p><p>Pepper\u2019s cursive writing appears like art on his palm, she\u2019s running through her checklist, making sure everything\u2019s all set and good to go. It\u2019s such a small, common thing. But Tony can\u2019t help but think <i>I love you</i> anyway. Pepper always takes such good care of him. Sometimes he doesn\u2019t know if he deserves it. But he cherishes it anyway. </p><p>He looks to his right hand and furrows his brows, fond. The kid\u2019s freaking out. Nervous about presenting soon and that the lights are on him and there\u2019s no way he can compete with all these rich kids when he\u2019s a dumpster diver but it would be so cool to win the competition and-</p><p>Tony stops. No way. </p><p>No way.</p><p>It\u2019s- it\u2019s impossible.</p><p>But it isn\u2019t. It isn\u2019t impossible. And Tony bursts through the doors, eyes wide, muscles tight, his mouth is open like he wants to shout when the curtains draw open on the stage and everyone stops to stare and Tony stops with them. </p><p>He can barely breathe. </p><p>\u201cPresenting Peter Parker and his chemical invention.\u201d</p><p>Peter Parker. </p><p>Tony claps his hands to his mouth. Emotions bursting through every part of him. He can\u2019t take his eyes off him. Peter. Peter. It\u2019s Peter. Peter Parker. And he\u2019s wonderful. Boyish brown curls, a shy smile, the gangly teenage body that doesn\u2019t quite know how to hold itself in the world. \u201cHi- hi everyone, I\u2019m Peter Parker.\u201d </p><p>He sounds exactly like Tony\u2019s imagined. Young and polite and sweet. So sweet. He\u2019s perfect. He\u2019s absolutely perfect. And he\u2019s happy. And <i>Tony\u2019s</i> happy. So so so happy that he\u2019s here. And that today\u2019s the day. And that even if he doesn\u2019t get to meet him at least he got to see him and that\u2019s enough for Tony. It\u2019s enough. </p><p>But his thoughts must have been too loud. Too emotional and strung and so uncontainable he could power a thousand earths because Peter glances down at his own hand and his eyes widen. His head jerks up. Something like longing in the curve of his brows. Hope that he barely wants to believe. He scans the crowd. Tony and Peter lock eyes and he can tell the exact second that Peter realizes that Tony Stark is his soul-mate. His lip wobbles and he looks like he wants to jump into the crowd and run but Peter\u2019s a better kid than Tony ever was and he just shakes his head slightly, like he\u2019s laughing to himself, glances at his hand, <i>I\u2019m so proud of you</i>, and pushes through his presentation because he knows it has to be done and that they\u2019ll have time later. </p><p>Peter\u2019s brilliant on stage. More brilliant than Tony ever was and he knows that Peter will be even better with time. Peter finishes his speech with a shy duck of the head and the sweetest half smile that has Tony feeling endeared to him all over again where he\u2019s waiting in the wings. Peter catches his eye, smiling so uncontrollably it makes him beam and when the curtains close he launches in Tony\u2019s direction, throwing his arms around him like they\u2019d done this a million times. </p><p>The first time Tony spoke to Peter, he had cried from gratitude. The first time he got to hold him, his arms wrapped so tightly around him, feeling Peter\u2019s fingers around his shoulder, he buries his face in Peter\u2019s hair and feels that same gratefulness, that same adoration, that same love for the universe that loved him after all and showed him he could find and give love in return. </p><p>Tony and Peter hold each other tightly and on both their hands, <i>I finally found you</i>. </p></p>",

Your platonic soul mate on your right. Your romantic soul mate on your left. But Tony\u2019s always known he\u2019s impossible to love. He only gets one. Until Peter.</p><p><b><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/18842041\" target=\"_blank\">Link on AO3</a>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_Pac2IO3jaVcq1pmOXvcQg\" target=\"_blank\">@irondadbingo</a></b></p><hr><p>When Tony was young, he loved to watch the colours dance across his mother\u2019s palms. On her right hand, a bright orange that changed almost every moment, quick and fleeting. Sometimes there\u2019d be little drawings, detailed pounding hearts or sloppily constructed portraits. While the orange script vanished and reappeared as a constant, Maria\u2019s left hand stayed static, the same dark blue writing having never changed in over twelve years. </p><p>Head perched in his mother\u2019s lap, Tony played with her hands, marveling quietly at the contrast. \u201cMama, why don\u2019t the red thoughts change anymore?\u201d </p><p>Maria pulled her hand back, rubbing her palm with her thumb, almost tracing the words. Tony was old enough to read now. He could see the words <i>I wish I could have met you</i> clearly, written almost like it was scribbled in a rush all along her hand. </p><p>Immediately, the orange writing changed: <i>Don\u2019t be sad, I hate it when you\u2019re sad</i>. Tony pulled away. Had he upset mama? But quickly, Maria rushed to gather him in her arms, holding him tight. \u201cTony, you remember what the writing means right?\u201d</p><p>Tony nodded, still trying to figure out whether he had upset his mother or not. \u201cThe right hand is your soul mate who\u2019s your best friend and the left is your soul mate that you marry.\u201d</p><p>Maria smiled, pinching his cheek. \u201cThat\u2019s right. And do you remember why the words always change?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s their most important thought.\u201d he answered, proud when his mother nodded.</p><p>\u201cBut sometimes\u2026\u201d her voice trailed off, locked in a pain Tony didn\u2019t yet understand, \u201csometimes the words stay frozen because that\u2019s the person\u2019s last thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can someone stop thinking?\u201d Tony scrunched his nose. </p><p>He knew for sure that could never happen to him. Even when he didn\u2019t want them, his thoughts raced faster than even he could keep up with sometimes. Maria looked down at her hand. \u201cSometimes your soul mate dies.\u201d she says quietly, \u201cAnd the last thing they ever thought stays on your skin forever.\u201d </p><p>Tony frowned. \u201cBut your soul-mate is supposed to <i>be</i> with you forever.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAt least I had a soul-mate Tony. Some people aren\u2019t so lucky.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s frown deepened, a small kernel of anxiety clustering in his stomach, only to grow bigger with time. How could not everyone have a soul mate? That didn\u2019t seem fair. Was it because there weren\u2019t enough people? Or was it because some people are just impossible to love at all? </p><p>Tony\u2019s voice was small, insecure and anxious, \u201cWill I get soul-mates?\u201d</p><p>Maria gathered him in her arms, pressing kisses into his hair. \u201cDon\u2019t ask questions like that Tony, soul-mates or not, everyone deserves love.\u201d </p><p>He wouldn\u2019t notice until much later that she never really answered his question. Maybe she had known, even then, that he would be difficult to love. </p>[[MORE]]<p>The day Tony turns ten years old is the most exciting day of his life. He falls asleep when he\u2019s still nine and knows that at 4:35 a.m, the exact time he was born, the writing will appear on his right hand. Whichever person turns ten first triggers the writing for both pairs. If he\u2019s being honest, he\u2019s more excited about his platonic soul-mate than the romantic one. Romance was icky and looked like hard work. Who wanted to always buy flowers all the time? </p><p>The clock ticks its way past ten-thirty p.m, a long time after his bed time. Flipping on his stomach, Tony reaches for his alarm clock, turning the dials to set the alarm for exactly 4:35 a.m. Burying himself into his pillows, Tony waits for the earth to turn. He can\u2019t wait. He just can\u2019t wait. Maybe now he wouldn\u2019t be so lonely all the time. Because now he\u2019d find a best friend <i>and</i> a wife and isn\u2019t that the best combination ever? That\u2019s more than Tony ever wanted. </p><p>He was just tired of being lonely. </p><p>Tony drifts off in a hazy dream. He thinks he catches a glimpse of a little girl with strawberry blonde hair. She looks really pretty. He wakes up before his alarm by only a second, a light burning sensation in his left hand tingling. Tony\u2019s eyes widen, heart battering in this throat as he throws himself off the bed to turn on the lights, watching as a white script with almost curly lettering traces itself along his palm. </p><p><i>Cotton candy rain</i></p><p>Tony furrows his brows before remembering what time it is. Smiling to himself, he watches in fascination as the scope of his soul-mate\u2019s dreams change. So this is the person he would marry? She seems really cute. </p><p>But something bothers him. His right hand isn\u2019t tingling. He scrubs at his palm as though that had anything to do with the process at all but it remains just as blank. That kernel of anxiety pounds into something bigger. Something like dread coiling around it. He has one soul-mate, where\u2019s the other? Why aren\u2019t they connected to him yet? </p><p>Does he just not have one? </p><p>Tony thinks about what will be on his romantic soul-mate\u2019s palm. All the scared thoughts rumbling inside his head. The fears. The insecurities. Immediately, he tries to think of better things. What if she wakes up and thinks those bad things are all about her?? She\u2019d hate him before he ever gets the chance to meet her. And Tony really wants to meet her. More than he wants anything. </p><p>Maybe his platonic soul-mate just comes later. </p><p>Yeah. Maybe that\u2019s it. </p><hr><p>Tony\u2019s platonic soul-mate never comes. </p><p>He\u2019s eighteen now and knows two things. One, Pepper- they couldn\u2019t share their real names- was his soul-mate and he loves her more than anything even though he hasn\u2019t met her yet. Two, he doesn\u2019t need a platonic soul mate or anyone else in the world because he has Rhodey and Rhodey is enough for him. </p><p>The white script flows over his hand, <i>Say I\u2019m just a girl one more time. </i></p><p>Tony winces. He would <i>not</i> want to be the sorry asshole on the other side of that conversation. Without even meaning to, Tony checks his other hand and even though it hasn\u2019t changed in eight years, the blankness still hurts him somewhere farther down than he could hide. His mother tries to tell him that maybe his soul-mate just wasn\u2019t born yet. But Tony knows the truth. He just doesn\u2019t get one. Isn\u2019t worthy of one. Pepper\u2019s just a fluke, some kind of cosmic karma taunting him about how he shouldn\u2019t have any soul-mates, let alone the most wonderful woman in the world. That it\u2019s all just an accident he doesn\u2019t deserve. </p><p><i>Hey. Stop that Tony. I deserve you and only you. </i></p><p>Tony stares at the words, wishing he could brand them on his skin forever. Usually the thoughts appeared automatically, but over the years, Tony and Pepper had learned that if they concentrated hard enough, they could craft their own messages. Tony doesn\u2019t have to try though, for his most sincere appreciation to shine through. \u00a0</p><p>But he knows the truth. His father stopped talking to him the moment he left home, tired of him and unwilling to put up with him. His old socialite circle was grandiose and bursting at the seams, lies upon lies piling up over gossip and half-meant kisses. Even Obadiah, mentor that he was, was never really there when he needed him. Everyone around Tony either loved him and then left him, or never really loved him at all. </p><hr><p>Tony takes over Stark Industries and out of habit, looked down at his right hand and thought this has to be the day. This has to be. But as usual, his skin remains unchanged and he honestly doesn\u2019t know how he can still feel so disappointed every time. He\u2019s hosting interviews today, for the position of his assistant and he\u2019s already tired and really can\u2019t care less. </p><p>And then Virginia Potts walks into the room. \u00a0</p><p>Tony doesn\u2019t know how he knows. Maybe it\u2019s the white blazer suit, the one she had thought about in a choice between it and the blue one. Maybe it\u2019s the crimson writing on her palm she had told him was his colour. Or maybe it\u2019s the way she looks at him that makes him feel like he\u2019s known her his whole life. </p><p>\u201cYou wanna know something really weird?\u201d he asks, smiling at her taken aback expression.</p><p>\u201cDepends.\u201d she answers slowly.</p><p>\u201cI only have one soul-mate and it\u2019s this girl who has Maroon 5 stuck in her head so much my entire hand is just She Will Be Loved lyrics.\u201d </p><p>She pauses, narrowing her eyes like she almost doesn\u2019t want to believe it. \u201cThat\u2019s weird. My soul-mate always complains about the same thing as though heavy metal is any better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s-\u201d</p><p>\u201c-the peak of music.\u201d they say together, and Tony gapes.</p><p>Pepper smiles. \u201cSo I\u2019ve been told anyway.\u201d </p><p>Pepper lifts her hand, showing Tony his own thoughts. <i>Oh my God it\u2019s her. She\u2019s beautiful.</i></p><p>When he runs to hug her, he tries not to let anything ruin the joy coursing through him, even when he catches a glimpse of bright green hand-writing on Pepper\u2019s other hand <i>YOU FOUND YOUR SOUL-MATE AHHHH!!!</i></p><p>Tony doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s ever felt happier than kissing Pepper for the first time. And yet he still feels half-way happy. Missing some crucial part of himself that he was robbed of. </p><p>But Tony has Pepper. </p><p>Maybe that could be enough. </p><hr><p>On August 10, everything changes. </p><p>Tony\u2019s forty-one now. He\u2019s married Pepper, a small quiet wedding with just their closest circles. Stark Industries has delved into automated weaponry, and despite everything, Tony\u2019s come to terms now, finally, that he can still be loved even without any writing on his right hand. </p><p>He\u2019s making a sandwich to bring back down to the lab when his right hand burns. Jolting, he drops the knife with a hiss, bringing his hand up to see where he had cut it when he freezes. It\u2019s impossible. It\u2019s utterly impossible but- scratchy blue writing scrawls across his hand, <i>!!!!!</i>. </p><p>Tony\u2019s hand shakes. No. There\u2019s no- there\u2019s no way. Thirty years later, there\u2019s no way- there just- there just isn\u2019t- but the words keep changing, faster and faster. <i>I have a soul-mate. Oh my god! Oh my God! Wow! I have TWO soul-mates! </i></p><p>Tony feels his eyes warm with disbelief, tears pooling at the edge of his lashes. He can\u2019t stop staring at the blue writing curving all around his hand as his soul-mate\u2019s thoughts get more and more out of control. Pepper\u2019s thoughts had always been more constrained, elegant almost, even when they were kids. But whoever\u2019s thoughts are on his hand jumps from one idea to the next, a flurry of energy and vitality that brings up every repressed emotion Tony had hidden deep inside come flooding to the surface.</p><p>He has a soul-mate. He has a soul-mate. They appeared for him. He isn\u2019t unloved. He isn\u2019t a flaw in the universe. He\u2019s- he\u2019s whole. </p><p>The tears wash down his cheeks as Tony closes his eyes, bringing his hands up to his face. His whole life, he had felt like some part of him was missing. That there was something he was supposed to be looking for. And now- </p><p><i>Don\u2019t be sad anymore. Your writing is so sad.</i></p><p>Tony\u2019s mouth trembles. The writing shifting again, <i>How do I cheer them up? A joke? </i></p><p>Two seconds later, <i>I don\u2019t know any jokes though\u2026maybe Ben knows some!</i></p><p>Unprompted, the only thought in Tony\u2019s head is, <i>I don\u2019t even know who this person is, but I love them.</i></p><p><i>I love you too!!</i></p><p>And this time, Tony allows himself to laugh, incredulous and thankful. He\u2019s forty-one when his platonic soul-mate sends their first message. His mother was right, Tony had just needed to wait. The universe had never abandoned it him. It was just waiting to give him the perfect person. But this kid\u2026how can Tony be perfect for him? How can he possibly be deserving of being in a child\u2019s life? A kid so happy it\u2019s almost contagious. </p><p>What is a soul-mate? A person whose atoms are made up from the same star you were born from? A person who has one half of your very own soul? A person you never abandon, no matter what? Maybe the universe gave this kid to Tony to prove he still has love to give in a way he never thought he could have. But maybe one day, this child would need him. Maybe not right now, maybe not that second, but sometime, in the future, they would meet, and Tony knows he\u2019s going to spend every moment trying to make that happen and be there for this kid. </p><p><i>I can\u2019t wait to meet you. </i>He can\u2019t help but think.</p><p><i>Me too! I live at</i></p><p>The text cuts off and Tony smiles in spite of himself. He doesn\u2019t know the tricks of the trade yet and it was somehow more endearing than it should\u2019ve been.</p><p><i>You can\u2019t say anything personal except your name yet kiddo </i></p><p><i>That\u2019s dumb. Rules are dumb. Super duper dumb.</i></p><p>Tony snorts. The kid\u2019ll learn to control his thoughts more one day, but as it is, it\u2019s adorable watching him. Tony takes in a breath, still unable to help his smile. He concentrates his thoughts. </p><p><i>I\u2019m Tony</i>. </p><p><i>My name\u2019s Peter! Do I get to meet you soon?? </i></p><p><i>I want to meet you.</i></p><p><i>Is that weird to say?</i></p><p><i>Oh no, you\u2019re gonna see everything I think. </i></p><p><i>Tony!!</i></p><p>Tony bursts out laughing and he doesn\u2019t know how his entire heart can expand until its swelled with adoration over someone he hasn\u2019t met yet. </p><p><i>!!!</i></p><p><i>That\u2019s so nice</i></p><p><i>Wow</i></p><p>Embarrassed, Tony quickly quiets his mind. No need to traumatize the kid with all his issues and troubles with love. </p><p><i>When you\u2019re older, you\u2019ll get better at only letting certain thoughts appear</i></p><p><i>Wait are you old? My soul-mate\u2019s old??</i></p><p><i>I didn\u2019t know that could happen</i></p><p><i>Hey-</i></p><p><i>I\u2019m old, but not that old </i></p><p>Peter keeps on chattering and Tony counts down the days before the universe brings them together.</p><hr><p>It\u2019s a while later, after Peter\u2019s next birthday- his excitement made Tony smile- when Tony finds out just how deep Obadiah\u2019s betrayal went. He sees the files upon files of under the table deals. Weapons sold to terrorists and warlords and profiteers of senseless violence and death. He traces each deal to an attack that killed more innocents than he could count from all parts of the globe. Stark Industries wasn\u2019t protecting anybody. They were tools of murder. </p><p>Tony can\u2019t move. He\u2019s frozen in his chair. He\u2019s<b> </b>the CEO, he\u2019s the one in charge, he\u2019s the one who had been duped all these years by that lying, two-faced son of a bitch. Shit. He really is the worst. Scum. Garbage. How many people died because of him? How much blood is on his hands? What could he have done better- god it was always about what he could\u2019ve done better. Always playing catch up. </p><p>He thought he was the good guy. Turns out he\u2019d been the villain all along. The universe was wrong. He isn\u2019t worthy of love. He doesn\u2019t deserve it. Smartest man alive. Kid genius. The most brilliant mind of our generation. All that means nothing if he can\u2019t use that so called genius for anything that <b>matters</b>.</p><p>Tony\u2019s head falls into his hands and he shakes. There are no tears. No sobs. He just trembles under the weight of everything he could\u2019ve done differently and wishes he could shake hard enough for everything inside of him to fall right out so his guilt doesn\u2019t consume him whole. He should\u2019ve been better. He should\u2019ve been better. </p><p>His right hand burns. </p><p>It stings with such a fierce intensity that it jerks him out of his self-pity. He stares at the blue writing, usually messily scrawled and quick, now bold and in all capitals, looking crisp and authoritative. </p><p><i>You are not a bad person</i></p><p><i>You are not a bad person</i></p><p><i>You are not a bad person</i></p><p>Every time the thought seems to disappear, the words come back bolder, like Peter\u2019s focusing desperately on keeping that one thought coherent. Demanding Tony to read it. Demanding he accept it. Tony watches as Peter battles with his constant stream of ideas to present just this one and he can imagine a little boy, scrunching his face in concentration, clutching his wrist, working so damn <i>hard</i> so that someone like <i>Tony </i>would hear him. </p><p>The tears finally well up in his eyes and Tony can\u2019t help but feel worse because here he was bringing this little kid down. The kid Tony promised to protect is trying to protect him and he really is the <i>worst</i>. </p><p><i>Not the worst. </i></p><p><i>You\u2019re the best Tony</i></p><p><i>The best the best the best </i></p><p><i>I\u2019m your soul mate so I\u2019ll love you forever even if you don\u2019t love yourself yet</i></p><p><i>May says sometimes that takes a while </i></p><p><i>But I\u2019ll tell you everything I love about you</i></p><p><i>Because you\u2019re good </i></p><p><i>You\u2019re good Tony, you\u2019re good</i></p><p><i>You made good jokes</i></p><p><i>You give me better advice than Ned</i></p><p><i>You\u2019re so smart! Sometimes I see words I don\u2019t even know how to say on my hand and I\u2019m like woahhh!!</i></p><p><i>And you always say nice things to me</i></p><p><i>And you give me funny nicknames</i></p><p><i>No one gives me nicknames so I really like that </i></p><p><i>You\u2019re a good person</i></p><p><i>I know it</i></p><p>Peter\u2019s writing flourishes on his palm almost faster than Tony can read them all and the tears come down harder when Peter doesn\u2019t seem to run out of things to say. He keeps pouring out love and Tony tries desperately to receive it and he thinks maybe he was wrong about what the universe had intended. Maybe he wasn\u2019t meant to save Peter, maybe Peter was meant to save him. Over and over, Peter tells him he can be good. That he <i>is</i> good. And Peter thinks of Tony and thinks about the power of the sun and the wind and the might of the ocean. Tony Stark can do anything and for the first time in his life, Tony believes it. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t feel like a good person. He doesn\u2019t feel anything but guilt and regret. But Peter thinks he\u2019s good. And for Peter, Tony would change the world. </p><p>Tony grits his teeth. Wipes his eyes. Gets up from the floor. He marches down to his lab, ready to unleash hell and turn the entire company around. This isn\u2019t the legacy he\u2019s going to leave behind. He\u2019s done with the world of war and blood. Peter is going to grow up in a world of peace. Tony will make sure of it. </p><p>It\u2019s all over the news the next day. </p><p>STARK INDUSTRIES SHAKEN BY SHOCKING REVELATIONS OF OBADIAH STANE\u2019S DEALS WITH TERRORISTS</p><p>TONY STARK, CEO OF STARK INDUSTRIES, EXPOSES STANE\u2019S WRONGDOING AT BOARD MEMBER\u2019S MEETING </p><p>STARK INDUSTRIES TO SHUT DOWN THE WEAPONS DIVISION EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY </p><p>TONY STARK, CRAZY? OR JUST STUPID? </p><p>CEO TONY STARK TAKES THE MANTLE OF SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE ENTERPRISE TOO SERIOUSLY? </p><p>The media can say whatever they want. They can call him crazy or stupid or the worst thing to happen to business since the housing bubble, but Tony doesn\u2019t care. Peter said he was a good person. And he intended on making sure he was right. </p><hr><p>It\u2019s three years later and Tony\u2019s been delighted with hearing the literal stream of consciousness from Peter over his first crush- a black haired girl named Lindsay,- his adventures in the world of Lego- ridiculous,- and every little dorky thing a nerd kid would get up to in his life. Bored at a meeting or needing a break from the mundane, Tony knows he can just glance at his hand for a good pick me up. </p><p>Peter\u2019s gotten better at controlling his thoughts now. Tony\u2019s hand is no longer an eternally marred canvas, but Peter\u2019s thoughts are still hilariously out of control. Which is why when the blue splatters across his hand Tony almost chuckles before he really reads what\u2019s going on.</p><p><i>No. No nonono no no nono please</i></p><p><i>Please please </i></p><p><i>Ben</i></p><p><i>Ben</i></p><p><i>Oh no </i></p><p><i>Please don\u2019t go please don\u2019t-</i></p><p>Tony\u2019s hand trembles. He clutches it in his left, unable to stop staring at the horror unfolding across his skin. Peter\u2019s in pain. Soul-mates can\u2019t feel each other but Tony can see Peter unraveling anyway. The writing smudges on his palm like Peter\u2019s barely coherent. Tony thinks he can make out the word \u2018no\u2019 and \u2018please\u2019 but mostly it\u2019s Ben\u2019s name, blurred on his hand like he\u2019s seeing through tears. </p><p><i>I need help</i></p><p><i>I need help</i></p><p><i>Someone help me please</i></p><p><i>HELP ME</i></p><p>Tony clenches his jaw, a frustrated growl in the back of his throat. Running, he surges into his lab, throwing himself onto his chair, fingers clattering against the keyboard. \u201cJARVIS call emergency responders tell them-\u201d Tony trails off. </p><p>Tell them what? That there\u2019s a kid somewhere crying about his uncle? Crying over what? What happened? Who else was there? More importantly, <i>where</i> was there. Tony\u2019s heart tremors, he sucks in a breath. He feels like his lungs have shrunk inside him. That the air\u2019s disappeared. His right hand is still on fire, the blue has now consumed his palm, there are barely any distinguishable words from how many of them there are and all Tony can do is press his hand to his lips and rock himself back and forth.</p><p><i>I\u2019m sorry</i></p><p><i>I\u2019m sorry</i></p><p><i>I\u2019m sorry Peter </i></p><p><i>God I\u2019m so sorry</i></p><p>He watches and waits for a hint, a sign, anything to help him know where Peter is and what happened, a hint, a kernel, just the <i>possibility</i> of being to help him. But the day darkens and Tony gets nothing. Not one useful thing. </p><p>Eventually, the blue melts away and it\u2019s replaced by just one sentence that stays even into the night. </p><p><i>Ben\u2019s dead. </i></p><p><i>My fault. </i></p><p>And Tony shakes. </p><hr><p><i>I don\u2019t want to do this</i></p><p><i>I can\u2019t do this</i></p><p><i>Please Tony</i></p><p><i>Please, please please </i></p><p><i>Make it go away </i></p><p><i>Make it stop </i></p><p><i>I can\u2019t do this</i></p><p>Today\u2019s the day of Ben\u2019s funeral and Tony scours the web for any sign of it, but with no last name, Ben dies with thousands of his name. </p><p>Tony focuses everything he has into crafting the perfect message. He wants to be there. Needs to be there. The second Peter\u2019s writing first appeared he had sworn that he would always look out for him, always be there for him, that he would be better than he ever could be because this was the universe giving him a second chance at love. </p><p><i>You can do it Peter</i></p><p><i>You\u2019re strong and you\u2019re kind and you loved your uncle</i></p><p><i>And he would want you there to see him off </i></p><p><i>And be with your aunt</i></p><p>Peter\u2019s reply is immediate. </p><p><i>It should\u2019ve been me</i></p><p>Tony knows he hadn\u2019t meant to let that slip out. He can tell from how it disappears the second it\u2019s written. But it\u2019s too late. The damage is done. </p><p><i>Don\u2019t say that</i></p><p>Tony doesn\u2019t even have to try and focus. He can\u2019t. Even if he wanted to. There\u2019s something fierce inside him. Something deep and primal and unwilling to ever let go. A desperate love he\u2019s never felt before. </p><p><i>Don\u2019t you ever say that</i></p><p>For the first time in a long time, his thoughts become a wave, they douse Peter\u2019s hand and he can\u2019t stop it.</p><p><i>Your life is worth more than you\u2019ll ever possibly know to your uncle</i></p><p><i>He loved you and he wanted you to live</i></p><p><i>Your life meant everything to him</i></p><p><i>I don\u2019t need to have met him to know that</i></p><p><i>And so now</i></p><p><i>You\u2019re going to go to the funeral</i></p><p><i>You\u2019re going to cry and you\u2019re going to mourn and hug your aunt</i></p><p><i>And then you\u2019re going to live</i></p><p><i>Do you hear me Peter?</i></p><p><i>You\u2019re going to LIVE</i></p><p><i>For your uncle</i></p><p><i>For Ben</i></p><p>And Tony\u2019s feelings are like tidal waves, he can\u2019t stop until he knows Peter understands. He\u2019s never even met the kid but he knows just as certainly as he knows anything in this world that if he were Ben, he would\u2019ve done the exact same thing. That loving someone you have to protect is stronger a force than anything on the planet and that Peter will get through this because he\u2019s still surrounded by love and Tony would make sure of it. </p><p>Unbidden, his thoughts come out before can stop them.</p><p><i>I\u2019m here for you. Now, later, forever. </i></p><p><i>I\u2019m going to find you soon </i></p><p><i>I promise </i></p><p><i>I\u2019m going to </i><b><i>find you</i></b></p><hr><p>Except\u2026Tony\u2019s already tried. He\u2019s tried so many times. But every attempt had failed and the failures were piling atop of him. Crushing and mocking. It\u2019s been months since the funeral and he\u2019s at the exact same place now as he was then. Pen twirling in his hand, Tony stops swiveling in his chair when there\u2019s a knock on his office door. </p><p>The sunlight streams through Pepper\u2019s hair like a halo and Tony\u2019s smile comes as naturally as breathing. \u201cHey Pep.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHey yourself.\u201d she greets, an amused note in her wry smile, \u201cYou know you have a meeting in twenty minutes right?\u201d</p><p>Tony feigns surprise, \u201cWhat? Do I? Must\u2019ve slipped my mind.\u201d he makes a snide face, \u201cNo wait, I just decided it was boring and thought we could play hookie and go get coffee instead. My treat.\u201d he waggles his brows in that way he knew always made her laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou know that we\u2019re married and have a joint account right?\u201d but she grins anyway. \u201cActually, I need you to sign this.\u201d </p><p>Not even needing to look at it, Tony flips to the back, scrawling his name with a bit of a flourish. \u201cIs it possible this is even more boring than the meeting?\u201d </p><p>\u201cDepends.\u201d she shrugs, coy. </p><p>\u201cO-n?\u201d he says, dragging the word.</p><p>Something sparkles in Pepper\u2019s eyes, \u201cOn whether you think hosting a summer intern would be fun or not.\u201d</p><p>Tony groans, sliding in his seat. \u201cWhen did this happen? Is this because I missed dinner a week ago because I told you that Happy refused to listen when I said to avoid traffic and-\u201d</p><p>Pepper holds up a hand. \u201cNo.\u201d she says slowly, \u201cThis is because we\u2019re trying to encourage young minds remember? You know, this was technically your idea.\u201d </p><p>Tony looks aghast. \u201cHow dare you.\u201d </p><p>Laughing, Pepper sits across from him on his desk. \u201cRemember when you said it might be fun to host a competition for kids at the next Stark Expo? I thought we could host something for all ages, it would be cute right? To see a bunch of eight year olds walk in with volcanoes? And then I thought, what should the prize be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain how an internship is a prize.\u201d Tony says, expression flat.</p><p>\u201cWhat high school kid obsessed with tech <i>wouldn\u2019t </i>want to work with Tony Stark.\u201d</p><p>Tony smirks, lazy and slow. \u201cIs that a little hint of admiration I sense Miss. Potts?\u201d </p><p>Pepper smiles into his kiss. \u201cNot admiration, just shaking my head at all the misguided youth.\u201d </p><p>Quickly, she snatches up the papers from his desk. \u201cAnd you already signed anyway, so!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheater!!\u201d </p><p>\u201cAll\u2019s fair sweetie.\u201d And she flashes him that smug expression over her shoulder that makes him want to simultaneously kiss and her and sulk, \u201cAnd get up. The meeting\u2019s in five minutes!\u201d </p><p>Tony\u2019s hand burns. <i>She sure got the better of you huh?</i></p><p><i>Zip it kid</i></p><p>Tony shakes his head to hide his grin. </p><hr><p>The universe as it happened, brims with people destined to be together, but who only truly belonged together at a certain moment. Sometimes the people you love the fiercest are those who, in a different time, in a different place, in a different state of mind, you might never have come to love at all. And Tony\u2019s always loved Peter. From the second he knew he existed, he loved him. </p><p>But the right time. </p><p>The perfect time.</p><p>A time where Tony wasn\u2019t grieving and drinking and falling into pits of self-destruction and a time where Peter wasn\u2019t imploding on the inside with guilt and loss, a time where both of them could come into each other\u2019s lives at the perfect moment to acknowledge the worst but bring out the best had yet to come. And Tony\u2019s finally entered it. And he has never felt more afraid and yet, a deeper, intense need for anything ever before in his life. </p><p>The competition\u2019s started. There are three separate rooms, three separate groups. He enters the Kid\u2019s Corner, full of elementary school kids racing through the booths admiring projects their own parents helped them make. Tony takes photos and high-fives children and encourages one shy girl to give a presentation that makes him feel oddly misty. The second room has middle schoolers, probably the worst age group Tony can think of. Even Peter had his days when he was thirteen. And Peter was the sweetest thing since the sugarcane. To be honest, he\u2019s so busy navigating the crowds and playing the part that he doesn\u2019t really notice the burning in both his hands until he\u2019s standing outside the high schooler\u2019s room.</p><p>Pepper\u2019s cursive writing appears like art on his palm, she\u2019s running through her checklist, making sure everything\u2019s all set and good to go. It\u2019s such a small, common thing. But Tony can\u2019t help but think <i>I love you</i> anyway. Pepper always takes such good care of him. Sometimes he doesn\u2019t know if he deserves it. But he cherishes it anyway. </p><p>He looks to his right hand and furrows his brows, fond. The kid\u2019s freaking out. Nervous about presenting soon and that the lights are on him and there\u2019s no way he can compete with all these rich kids when he\u2019s a dumpster diver but it would be so cool to win the competition and-</p><p>Tony stops. No way. </p><p>No way.</p><p>It\u2019s- it\u2019s impossible.</p><p>But it isn\u2019t. It isn\u2019t impossible. And Tony bursts through the doors, eyes wide, muscles tight, his mouth is open like he wants to shout when the curtains draw open on the stage and everyone stops to stare and Tony stops with them. </p><p>He can barely breathe. </p><p>\u201cPresenting Peter Parker and his chemical invention.\u201d</p><p>Peter Parker. </p><p>Tony claps his hands to his mouth. Emotions bursting through every part of him. He can\u2019t take his eyes off him. Peter. Peter. It\u2019s Peter. Peter Parker. And he\u2019s wonderful. Boyish brown curls, a shy smile, the gangly teenage body that doesn\u2019t quite know how to hold itself in the world. \u201cHi- hi everyone, I\u2019m Peter Parker.\u201d </p><p>He sounds exactly like Tony\u2019s imagined. Young and polite and sweet. So sweet. He\u2019s perfect. He\u2019s absolutely perfect. And he\u2019s happy. And <i>Tony\u2019s</i> happy. So so so happy that he\u2019s here. And that today\u2019s the day. And that even if he doesn\u2019t get to meet him at least he got to see him and that\u2019s enough for Tony. It\u2019s enough. </p><p>But his thoughts must have been too loud. Too emotional and strung and so uncontainable he could power a thousand earths because Peter glances down at his own hand and his eyes widen. His head jerks up. Something like longing in the curve of his brows. Hope that he barely wants to believe. He scans the crowd. Tony and Peter lock eyes and he can tell the exact second that Peter realizes that Tony Stark is his soul-mate. His lip wobbles and he looks like he wants to jump into the crowd and run but Peter\u2019s a better kid than Tony ever was and he just shakes his head slightly, like he\u2019s laughing to himself, glances at his hand, <i>I\u2019m so proud of you</i>, and pushes through his presentation because he knows it has to be done and that they\u2019ll have time later. </p><p>Peter\u2019s brilliant on stage. More brilliant than Tony ever was and he knows that Peter will be even better with time. Peter finishes his speech with a shy duck of the head and the sweetest half smile that has Tony feeling endeared to him all over again where he\u2019s waiting in the wings. Peter catches his eye, smiling so uncontrollably it makes him beam and when the curtains close he launches in Tony\u2019s direction, throwing his arms around him like they\u2019d done this a million times. </p><p>The first time Tony spoke to Peter, he had cried from gratitude. The first time he got to hold him, his arms wrapped so tightly around him, feeling Peter\u2019s fingers around his shoulder, he buries his face in Peter\u2019s hair and feels that same gratefulness, that same adoration, that same love for the universe that loved him after all and showed him he could find and give love in return. </p><p>Tony and Peter hold each other tightly and on both their hands, <i>I finally found you</i>. </p></p>",

Your platonic soul mate on your right. Your romantic soul mate on your left. But Tony&rsquo;s always known he&rsquo;s impossible to love. He only gets one. Until Peter.</p><p><b><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/18842041\" target=\"_blank\">Link on AO3</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_Pac2IO3jaVcq1pmOXvcQg\" target=\"_blank\">@irondadbingo</a></b></p><hr /><p>When Tony was young, he loved to watch the colours dance across his mother&rsquo;s palms. On her right hand, a bright orange that changed almost every moment, quick and fleeting. Sometimes there&rsquo;d be little drawings, detailed pounding hearts or sloppily constructed portraits. While the orange script vanished and reappeared as a constant, Maria&rsquo;s left hand stayed static, the same dark blue writing having never changed in over twelve years. </p><p>Head perched in his mother&rsquo;s lap, Tony played with her hands, marveling quietly at the contrast. &ldquo;Mama, why don&rsquo;t the red thoughts change anymore?&rdquo; </p><p>Maria pulled her hand back, rubbing her palm with her thumb, almost tracing the words. Tony was old enough to read now. He could see the words <i>I wish I could have met you</i> clearly, written almost like it was scribbled in a rush all along her hand. </p><p>Immediately, the orange writing changed: <i>Don&rsquo;t be sad, I hate it when you&rsquo;re sad</i>. Tony pulled away. Had he upset mama? But quickly, Maria rushed to gather him in her arms, holding him tight. &ldquo;Tony, you remember what the writing means right?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony nodded, still trying to figure out whether he had upset his mother or not. &ldquo;The right hand is your soul mate who&rsquo;s your best friend and the left is your soul mate that you marry.&rdquo;</p><p>Maria smiled, pinching his cheek. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. And do you remember why the words always change?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s their most important thought.&rdquo; he answered, proud when his mother nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;But sometimes&hellip;&rdquo; her voice trailed off, locked in a pain Tony didn&rsquo;t yet understand, &ldquo;sometimes the words stay frozen because that&rsquo;s the person&rsquo;s last thought.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How can someone stop thinking?&rdquo; Tony scrunched his nose. </p><p>He knew for sure that could never happen to him. Even when he didn&rsquo;t want them, his thoughts raced faster than even he could keep up with sometimes. Maria looked down at her hand. &ldquo;Sometimes your soul mate dies.&rdquo; she says quietly, &ldquo;And the last thing they ever thought stays on your skin forever.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony frowned. &ldquo;But your soul-mate is supposed to <i>be</i> with you forever.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;At least I had a soul-mate Tony. Some people aren&rsquo;t so lucky.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s frown deepened, a small kernel of anxiety clustering in his stomach, only to grow bigger with time. How could not everyone have a soul mate? That didn&rsquo;t seem fair. Was it because there weren&rsquo;t enough people? Or was it because some people are just impossible to love at all? </p><p>Tony&rsquo;s voice was small, insecure and anxious, &ldquo;Will I get soul-mates?&rdquo;</p><p>Maria gathered him in her arms, pressing kisses into his hair. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask questions like that Tony, soul-mates or not, everyone deserves love.&rdquo; </p><p>He wouldn&rsquo;t notice until much later that she never really answered his question. Maybe she had known, even then, that he would be difficult to love. </p><p>The day Tony turns ten years old is the most exciting day of his life. He falls asleep when he&rsquo;s still nine and knows that at 4:35 a.m, the exact time he was born, the writing will appear on his right hand. Whichever person turns ten first triggers the writing for both pairs. If he&rsquo;s being honest, he&rsquo;s more excited about his platonic soul-mate than the romantic one. Romance was icky and looked like hard work. Who wanted to always buy flowers all the time? </p><p>The clock ticks its way past ten-thirty p.m, a long time after his bed time. Flipping on his stomach, Tony reaches for his alarm clock, turning the dials to set the alarm for exactly 4:35 a.m. Burying himself into his pillows, Tony waits for the earth to turn. He can&rsquo;t wait. He just can&rsquo;t wait. Maybe now he wouldn&rsquo;t be so lonely all the time. Because now he&rsquo;d find a best friend <i>and</i> a wife and isn&rsquo;t that the best combination ever? That&rsquo;s more than Tony ever wanted. </p><p>He was just tired of being lonely. </p><p>Tony drifts off in a hazy dream. He thinks he catches a glimpse of a little girl with strawberry blonde hair. She looks really pretty. He wakes up before his alarm by only a second, a light burning sensation in his left hand tingling. Tony&rsquo;s eyes widen, heart battering in this throat as he throws himself off the bed to turn on the lights, watching as a white script with almost curly lettering traces itself along his palm. </p><p><i>Cotton candy rain</i></p><p>Tony furrows his brows before remembering what time it is. Smiling to himself, he watches in fascination as the scope of his soul-mate&rsquo;s dreams change. So this is the person he would marry? She seems really cute. </p><p>But something bothers him. His right hand isn&rsquo;t tingling. He scrubs at his palm as though that had anything to do with the process at all but it remains just as blank. That kernel of anxiety pounds into something bigger. Something like dread coiling around it. He has one soul-mate, where&rsquo;s the other? Why aren&rsquo;t they connected to him yet? </p><p>Does he just not have one? </p><p>Tony thinks about what will be on his romantic soul-mate&rsquo;s palm. All the scared thoughts rumbling inside his head. The fears. The insecurities. Immediately, he tries to think of better things. What if she wakes up and thinks those bad things are all about her?? She&rsquo;d hate him before he ever gets the chance to meet her. And Tony really wants to meet her. More than he wants anything. </p><p>Maybe his platonic soul-mate just comes later. </p><p>Yeah. Maybe that&rsquo;s it. </p><hr /><p>Tony&rsquo;s platonic soul-mate never comes. </p><p>He&rsquo;s eighteen now and knows two things. One, Pepper- they couldn&rsquo;t share their real names- was his soul-mate and he loves her more than anything even though he hasn&rsquo;t met her yet. Two, he doesn&rsquo;t need a platonic soul mate or anyone else in the world because he has Rhodey and Rhodey is enough for him. </p><p>The white script flows over his hand, <i>Say I&rsquo;m just a girl one more time. </i></p><p>Tony winces. He would <i>not</i> want to be the sorry asshole on the other side of that conversation. Without even meaning to, Tony checks his other hand and even though it hasn&rsquo;t changed in eight years, the blankness still hurts him somewhere farther down than he could hide. His mother tries to tell him that maybe his soul-mate just wasn&rsquo;t born yet. But Tony knows the truth. He just doesn&rsquo;t get one. Isn&rsquo;t worthy of one. Pepper&rsquo;s just a fluke, some kind of cosmic karma taunting him about how he shouldn&rsquo;t have any soul-mates, let alone the most wonderful woman in the world. That it&rsquo;s all just an accident he doesn&rsquo;t deserve. </p><p><i>Hey. Stop that Tony. I deserve you and only you. </i></p><p>Tony stares at the words, wishing he could brand them on his skin forever. Usually the thoughts appeared automatically, but over the years, Tony and Pepper had learned that if they concentrated hard enough, they could craft their own messages. Tony doesn&rsquo;t have to try though, for his most sincere appreciation to shine through. &nbsp;</p><p>But he knows the truth. His father stopped talking to him the moment he left home, tired of him and unwilling to put up with him. His old socialite circle was grandiose and bursting at the seams, lies upon lies piling up over gossip and half-meant kisses. Even Obadiah, mentor that he was, was never really there when he needed him. Everyone around Tony either loved him and then left him, or never really loved him at all. </p><hr /><p>Tony takes over Stark Industries and out of habit, looked down at his right hand and thought this has to be the day. This has to be. But as usual, his skin remains unchanged and he honestly doesn&rsquo;t know how he can still feel so disappointed every time. He&rsquo;s hosting interviews today, for the position of his assistant and he&rsquo;s already tired and really can&rsquo;t care less. </p><p>And then Virginia Potts walks into the room. &nbsp;</p><p>Tony doesn&rsquo;t know how he knows. Maybe it&rsquo;s the white blazer suit, the one she had thought about in a choice between it and the blue one. Maybe it&rsquo;s the crimson writing on her palm she had told him was his colour. Or maybe it&rsquo;s the way she looks at him that makes him feel like he&rsquo;s known her his whole life. </p><p>&ldquo;You wanna know something really weird?&rdquo; he asks, smiling at her taken aback expression.</p><p>&ldquo;Depends.&rdquo; she answers slowly.</p><p>&ldquo;I only have one soul-mate and it&rsquo;s this girl who has Maroon 5 stuck in her head so much my entire hand is just She Will Be Loved lyrics.&rdquo; </p><p>She pauses, narrowing her eyes like she almost doesn&rsquo;t want to believe it. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s weird. My soul-mate always complains about the same thing as though heavy metal is any better.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, it&rsquo;s-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;-the peak of music.&rdquo; they say together, and Tony gapes.</p><p>Pepper smiles. &ldquo;So I&rsquo;ve been told anyway.&rdquo; </p><p>Pepper lifts her hand, showing Tony his own thoughts. <i>Oh my God it&rsquo;s her. She&rsquo;s beautiful.</i></p><p>When he runs to hug her, he tries not to let anything ruin the joy coursing through him, even when he catches a glimpse of bright green hand-writing on Pepper&rsquo;s other hand <i>YOU FOUND YOUR SOUL-MATE AHHHH!!!</i></p><p>Tony doesn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s ever felt happier than kissing Pepper for the first time. And yet he still feels half-way happy. Missing some crucial part of himself that he was robbed of. </p><p>But Tony has Pepper. </p><p>Maybe that could be enough. </p><hr /><p>On August 10, everything changes. </p><p>Tony&rsquo;s forty-one now. He&rsquo;s married Pepper, a small quiet wedding with just their closest circles. Stark Industries has delved into automated weaponry, and despite everything, Tony&rsquo;s come to terms now, finally, that he can still be loved even without any writing on his right hand. </p><p>He&rsquo;s making a sandwich to bring back down to the lab when his right hand burns. Jolting, he drops the knife with a hiss, bringing his hand up to see where he had cut it when he freezes. It&rsquo;s impossible. It&rsquo;s utterly impossible but- scratchy blue writing scrawls across his hand, <i>!!!!!</i>. </p><p>Tony&rsquo;s hand shakes. No. There&rsquo;s no- there&rsquo;s no way. Thirty years later, there&rsquo;s no way- there just- there just isn&rsquo;t- but the words keep changing, faster and faster. <i>I have a soul-mate. Oh my god! Oh my God! Wow! I have TWO soul-mates! </i></p><p>Tony feels his eyes warm with disbelief, tears pooling at the edge of his lashes. He can&rsquo;t stop staring at the blue writing curving all around his hand as his soul-mate&rsquo;s thoughts get more and more out of control. Pepper&rsquo;s thoughts had always been more constrained, elegant almost, even when they were kids. But whoever&rsquo;s thoughts are on his hand jumps from one idea to the next, a flurry of energy and vitality that brings up every repressed emotion Tony had hidden deep inside come flooding to the surface.</p><p>He has a soul-mate. He has a soul-mate. They appeared for him. He isn&rsquo;t unloved. He isn&rsquo;t a flaw in the universe. He&rsquo;s- he&rsquo;s whole. </p><p>The tears wash down his cheeks as Tony closes his eyes, bringing his hands up to his face. His whole life, he had felt like some part of him was missing. That there was something he was supposed to be looking for. And now- </p><p><i>Don&rsquo;t be sad anymore. Your writing is so sad.</i></p><p>Tony&rsquo;s mouth trembles. The writing shifting again, <i>How do I cheer them up? A joke? </i></p><p>Two seconds later, <i>I don&rsquo;t know any jokes though&hellip;maybe Ben knows some!</i></p><p>Unprompted, the only thought in Tony&rsquo;s head is, <i>I don&rsquo;t even know who this person is, but I love them.</i></p><p><i>I love you too!!</i></p><p>And this time, Tony allows himself to laugh, incredulous and thankful. He&rsquo;s forty-one when his platonic soul-mate sends their first message. His mother was right, Tony had just needed to wait. The universe had never abandoned it him. It was just waiting to give him the perfect person. But this kid&hellip;how can Tony be perfect for him? How can he possibly be deserving of being in a child&rsquo;s life? A kid so happy it&rsquo;s almost contagious. </p><p>What is a soul-mate? A person whose atoms are made up from the same star you were born from? A person who has one half of your very own soul? A person you never abandon, no matter what? Maybe the universe gave this kid to Tony to prove he still has love to give in a way he never thought he could have. But maybe one day, this child would need him. Maybe not right now, maybe not that second, but sometime, in the future, they would meet, and Tony knows he&rsquo;s going to spend every moment trying to make that happen and be there for this kid. </p><p><i>I can&rsquo;t wait to meet you. </i>He can&rsquo;t help but think.</p><p><i>Me too! I live at</i></p><p>The text cuts off and Tony smiles in spite of himself. He doesn&rsquo;t know the tricks of the trade yet and it was somehow more endearing than it should&rsquo;ve been.</p><p><i>You can&rsquo;t say anything personal except your name yet kiddo </i></p><p><i>That&rsquo;s dumb. Rules are dumb. Super duper dumb.</i></p><p>Tony snorts. The kid&rsquo;ll learn to control his thoughts more one day, but as it is, it&rsquo;s adorable watching him. Tony takes in a breath, still unable to help his smile. He concentrates his thoughts. </p><p><i>I&rsquo;m Tony</i>. </p><p><i>My name&rsquo;s Peter! Do I get to meet you soon?? </i></p><p><i>I want to meet you.</i></p><p><i>Is that weird to say?</i></p><p><i>Oh no, you&rsquo;re gonna see everything I think. </i></p><p><i>Tony!!</i></p><p>Tony bursts out laughing and he doesn&rsquo;t know how his entire heart can expand until its swelled with adoration over someone he hasn&rsquo;t met yet. </p><p><i>!!!</i></p><p><i>That&rsquo;s so nice</i></p><p><i>Wow</i></p><p>Embarrassed, Tony quickly quiets his mind. No need to traumatize the kid with all his issues and troubles with love. </p><p><i>When you&rsquo;re older, you&rsquo;ll get better at only letting certain thoughts appear</i></p><p><i>Wait are you old? My soul-mate&rsquo;s old??</i></p><p><i>I didn&rsquo;t know that could happen</i></p><p><i>Hey-</i></p><p><i>I&rsquo;m old, but not that old </i></p><p>Peter keeps on chattering and Tony counts down the days before the universe brings them together.</p><hr /><p>It&rsquo;s a while later, after Peter&rsquo;s next birthday- his excitement made Tony smile- when Tony finds out just how deep Obadiah&rsquo;s betrayal went. He sees the files upon files of under the table deals. Weapons sold to terrorists and warlords and profiteers of senseless violence and death. He traces each deal to an attack that killed more innocents than he could count from all parts of the globe. Stark Industries wasn&rsquo;t protecting anybody. They were tools of murder. </p><p>Tony can&rsquo;t move. He&rsquo;s frozen in his chair. He&rsquo;s<b> </b>the CEO, he&rsquo;s the one in charge, he&rsquo;s the one who had been duped all these years by that lying, two-faced son of a bitch. Shit. He really is the worst. Scum. Garbage. How many people died because of him? How much blood is on his hands? What could he have done better- god it was always about what he could&rsquo;ve done better. Always playing catch up. </p><p>He thought he was the good guy. Turns out he&rsquo;d been the villain all along. The universe was wrong. He isn&rsquo;t worthy of love. He doesn&rsquo;t deserve it. Smartest man alive. Kid genius. The most brilliant mind of our generation. All that means nothing if he can&rsquo;t use that so called genius for anything that <b>matters</b>.</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s head falls into his hands and he shakes. There are no tears. No sobs. He just trembles under the weight of everything he could&rsquo;ve done differently and wishes he could shake hard enough for everything inside of him to fall right out so his guilt doesn&rsquo;t consume him whole. He should&rsquo;ve been better. He should&rsquo;ve been better. </p><p>His right hand burns. </p><p>It stings with such a fierce intensity that it jerks him out of his self-pity. He stares at the blue writing, usually messily scrawled and quick, now bold and in all capitals, looking crisp and authoritative. </p><p><i>You are not a bad person</i></p><p><i>You are not a bad person</i></p><p><i>You are not a bad person</i></p><p>Every time the thought seems to disappear, the words come back bolder, like Peter&rsquo;s focusing desperately on keeping that one thought coherent. Demanding Tony to read it. Demanding he accept it. Tony watches as Peter battles with his constant stream of ideas to present just this one and he can imagine a little boy, scrunching his face in concentration, clutching his wrist, working so damn <i>hard</i> so that someone like <i>Tony </i>would hear him. </p><p>The tears finally well up in his eyes and Tony can&rsquo;t help but feel worse because here he was bringing this little kid down. The kid Tony promised to protect is trying to protect him and he really is the <i>worst</i>. </p><p><i>Not the worst. </i></p><p><i>You&rsquo;re the best Tony</i></p><p><i>The best the best the best </i></p><p><i>I&rsquo;m your soul mate so I&rsquo;ll love you forever even if you don&rsquo;t love yourself yet</i></p><p><i>May says sometimes that takes a while </i></p><p><i>But I&rsquo;ll tell you everything I love about you</i></p><p><i>Because you&rsquo;re good </i></p><p><i>You&rsquo;re good Tony, you&rsquo;re good</i></p><p><i>You made good jokes</i></p><p><i>You give me better advice than Ned</i></p><p><i>You&rsquo;re so smart! Sometimes I see words I don&rsquo;t even know how to say on my hand and I&rsquo;m like woahhh!!</i></p><p><i>And you always say nice things to me</i></p><p><i>And you give me funny nicknames</i></p><p><i>No one gives me nicknames so I really like that </i></p><p><i>You&rsquo;re a good person</i></p><p><i>I know it</i></p><p>Peter&rsquo;s writing flourishes on his palm almost faster than Tony can read them all and the tears come down harder when Peter doesn&rsquo;t seem to run out of things to say. He keeps pouring out love and Tony tries desperately to receive it and he thinks maybe he was wrong about what the universe had intended. Maybe he wasn&rsquo;t meant to save Peter, maybe Peter was meant to save him. Over and over, Peter tells him he can be good. That he <i>is</i> good. And Peter thinks of Tony and thinks about the power of the sun and the wind and the might of the ocean. Tony Stark can do anything and for the first time in his life, Tony believes it. </p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t feel like a good person. He doesn&rsquo;t feel anything but guilt and regret. But Peter thinks he&rsquo;s good. And for Peter, Tony would change the world. </p><p>Tony grits his teeth. Wipes his eyes. Gets up from the floor. He marches down to his lab, ready to unleash hell and turn the entire company around. This isn&rsquo;t the legacy he&rsquo;s going to leave behind. He&rsquo;s done with the world of war and blood. Peter is going to grow up in a world of peace. Tony will make sure of it. </p><p>It&rsquo;s all over the news the next day. </p><p>STARK INDUSTRIES SHAKEN BY SHOCKING REVELATIONS OF OBADIAH STANE&rsquo;S DEALS WITH TERRORISTS</p><p>TONY STARK, CEO OF STARK INDUSTRIES, EXPOSES STANE&rsquo;S WRONGDOING AT BOARD MEMBER&rsquo;S MEETING </p><p>STARK INDUSTRIES TO SHUT DOWN THE WEAPONS DIVISION EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY </p><p>TONY STARK, CRAZY? OR JUST STUPID? </p><p>CEO TONY STARK TAKES THE MANTLE OF SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE ENTERPRISE TOO SERIOUSLY? </p><p>The media can say whatever they want. They can call him crazy or stupid or the worst thing to happen to business since the housing bubble, but Tony doesn&rsquo;t care. Peter said he was a good person. And he intended on making sure he was right. </p><hr /><p>It&rsquo;s three years later and Tony&rsquo;s been delighted with hearing the literal stream of consciousness from Peter over his first crush- a black haired girl named Lindsay,- his adventures in the world of Lego- ridiculous,- and every little dorky thing a nerd kid would get up to in his life. Bored at a meeting or needing a break from the mundane, Tony knows he can just glance at his hand for a good pick me up. </p><p>Peter&rsquo;s gotten better at controlling his thoughts now. Tony&rsquo;s hand is no longer an eternally marred canvas, but Peter&rsquo;s thoughts are still hilariously out of control. Which is why when the blue splatters across his hand Tony almost chuckles before he really reads what&rsquo;s going on.</p><p><i>No. No nonono no no nono please</i></p><p><i>Please please </i></p><p><i>Ben</i></p><p><i>Ben</i></p><p><i>Oh no </i></p><p><i>Please don&rsquo;t go please don&rsquo;t-</i></p><p>Tony&rsquo;s hand trembles. He clutches it in his left, unable to stop staring at the horror unfolding across his skin. Peter&rsquo;s in pain. Soul-mates can&rsquo;t feel each other but Tony can see Peter unraveling anyway. The writing smudges on his palm like Peter&rsquo;s barely coherent. Tony thinks he can make out the word &lsquo;no&rsquo; and &lsquo;please&rsquo; but mostly it&rsquo;s Ben&rsquo;s name, blurred on his hand like he&rsquo;s seeing through tears. </p><p><i>I need help</i></p><p><i>I need help</i></p><p><i>Someone help me please</i></p><p><i>HELP ME</i></p><p>Tony clenches his jaw, a frustrated growl in the back of his throat. Running, he surges into his lab, throwing himself onto his chair, fingers clattering against the keyboard. &ldquo;JARVIS call emergency responders tell them-&rdquo; Tony trails off. </p><p>Tell them what? That there&rsquo;s a kid somewhere crying about his uncle? Crying over what? What happened? Who else was there? More importantly, <i>where</i> was there. Tony&rsquo;s heart tremors, he sucks in a breath. He feels like his lungs have shrunk inside him. That the air&rsquo;s disappeared. His right hand is still on fire, the blue has now consumed his palm, there are barely any distinguishable words from how many of them there are and all Tony can do is press his hand to his lips and rock himself back and forth.</p><p><i>I&rsquo;m sorry</i></p><p><i>I&rsquo;m sorry</i></p><p><i>I&rsquo;m sorry Peter </i></p><p><i>God I&rsquo;m so sorry</i></p><p>He watches and waits for a hint, a sign, anything to help him know where Peter is and what happened, a hint, a kernel, just the <i>possibility</i> of being to help him. But the day darkens and Tony gets nothing. Not one useful thing. </p><p>Eventually, the blue melts away and it&rsquo;s replaced by just one sentence that stays even into the night. </p><p><i>Ben&rsquo;s dead. </i></p><p><i>My fault. </i></p><p>And Tony shakes. </p><hr /><p><i>I don&rsquo;t want to do this</i></p><p><i>I can&rsquo;t do this</i></p><p><i>Please Tony</i></p><p><i>Please, please please </i></p><p><i>Make it go away </i></p><p><i>Make it stop </i></p><p><i>I can&rsquo;t do this</i></p><p>Today&rsquo;s the day of Ben&rsquo;s funeral and Tony scours the web for any sign of it, but with no last name, Ben dies with thousands of his name. </p><p>Tony focuses everything he has into crafting the perfect message. He wants to be there. Needs to be there. The second Peter&rsquo;s writing first appeared he had sworn that he would always look out for him, always be there for him, that he would be better than he ever could be because this was the universe giving him a second chance at love. </p><p><i>You can do it Peter</i></p><p><i>You&rsquo;re strong and you&rsquo;re kind and you loved your uncle</i></p><p><i>And he would want you there to see him off </i></p><p><i>And be with your aunt</i></p><p>Peter&rsquo;s reply is immediate. </p><p><i>It should&rsquo;ve been me</i></p><p>Tony knows he hadn&rsquo;t meant to let that slip out. He can tell from how it disappears the second it&rsquo;s written. But it&rsquo;s too late. The damage is done. </p><p><i>Don&rsquo;t say that</i></p><p>Tony doesn&rsquo;t even have to try and focus. He can&rsquo;t. Even if he wanted to. There&rsquo;s something fierce inside him. Something deep and primal and unwilling to ever let go. A desperate love he&rsquo;s never felt before. </p><p><i>Don&rsquo;t you ever say that</i></p><p>For the first time in a long time, his thoughts become a wave, they douse Peter&rsquo;s hand and he can&rsquo;t stop it.</p><p><i>Your life is worth more than you&rsquo;ll ever possibly know to your uncle</i></p><p><i>He loved you and he wanted you to live</i></p><p><i>Your life meant everything to him</i></p><p><i>I don&rsquo;t need to have met him to know that</i></p><p><i>And so now</i></p><p><i>You&rsquo;re going to go to the funeral</i></p><p><i>You&rsquo;re going to cry and you&rsquo;re going to mourn and hug your aunt</i></p><p><i>And then you&rsquo;re going to live</i></p><p><i>Do you hear me Peter?</i></p><p><i>You&rsquo;re going to LIVE</i></p><p><i>For your uncle</i></p><p><i>For Ben</i></p><p>And Tony&rsquo;s feelings are like tidal waves, he can&rsquo;t stop until he knows Peter understands. He&rsquo;s never even met the kid but he knows just as certainly as he knows anything in this world that if he were Ben, he would&rsquo;ve done the exact same thing. That loving someone you have to protect is stronger a force than anything on the planet and that Peter will get through this because he&rsquo;s still surrounded by love and Tony would make sure of it. </p><p>Unbidden, his thoughts come out before can stop them.</p><p><i>I&rsquo;m here for you. Now, later, forever. </i></p><p><i>I&rsquo;m going to find you soon </i></p><p><i>I promise </i></p><p><i>I&rsquo;m going to </i><b><i>find you</i></b></p><hr /><p>Except&hellip;Tony&rsquo;s already tried. He&rsquo;s tried so many times. But every attempt had failed and the failures were piling atop of him. Crushing and mocking. It&rsquo;s been months since the funeral and he&rsquo;s at the exact same place now as he was then. Pen twirling in his hand, Tony stops swiveling in his chair when there&rsquo;s a knock on his office door. </p><p>The sunlight streams through Pepper&rsquo;s hair like a halo and Tony&rsquo;s smile comes as naturally as breathing. &ldquo;Hey Pep.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Hey yourself.&rdquo; she greets, an amused note in her wry smile, &ldquo;You know you have a meeting in twenty minutes right?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony feigns surprise, &ldquo;What? Do I? Must&rsquo;ve slipped my mind.&rdquo; he makes a snide face, &ldquo;No wait, I just decided it was boring and thought we could play hookie and go get coffee instead. My treat.&rdquo; he waggles his brows in that way he knew always made her laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;You know that we&rsquo;re married and have a joint account right?&rdquo; but she grins anyway. &ldquo;Actually, I need you to sign this.&rdquo; </p><p>Not even needing to look at it, Tony flips to the back, scrawling his name with a bit of a flourish. &ldquo;Is it possible this is even more boring than the meeting?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Depends.&rdquo; she shrugs, coy. </p><p>&ldquo;O-n?&rdquo; he says, dragging the word.</p><p>Something sparkles in Pepper&rsquo;s eyes, &ldquo;On whether you think hosting a summer intern would be fun or not.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony groans, sliding in his seat. &ldquo;When did this happen? Is this because I missed dinner a week ago because I told you that Happy refused to listen when I said to avoid traffic and-&rdquo;</p><p>Pepper holds up a hand. &ldquo;No.&rdquo; she says slowly, &ldquo;This is because we&rsquo;re trying to encourage young minds remember? You know, this was technically your idea.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony looks aghast. &ldquo;How dare you.&rdquo; </p><p>Laughing, Pepper sits across from him on his desk. &ldquo;Remember when you said it might be fun to host a competition for kids at the next Stark Expo? I thought we could host something for all ages, it would be cute right? To see a bunch of eight year olds walk in with volcanoes? And then I thought, what should the prize be?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Explain how an internship is a prize.&rdquo; Tony says, expression flat.</p><p>&ldquo;What high school kid obsessed with tech <i>wouldn&rsquo;t </i>want to work with Tony Stark.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony smirks, lazy and slow. &ldquo;Is that a little hint of admiration I sense Miss. Potts?&rdquo; </p><p>Pepper smiles into his kiss. &ldquo;Not admiration, just shaking my head at all the misguided youth.&rdquo; </p><p>Quickly, she snatches up the papers from his desk. &ldquo;And you already signed anyway, so!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cheater!!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;All&rsquo;s fair sweetie.&rdquo; And she flashes him that smug expression over her shoulder that makes him want to simultaneously kiss and her and sulk, &ldquo;And get up. The meeting&rsquo;s in five minutes!&rdquo; </p><p>Tony&rsquo;s hand burns. <i>She sure got the better of you huh?</i></p><p><i>Zip it kid</i></p><p>Tony shakes his head to hide his grin. </p><hr /><p>The universe as it happened, brims with people destined to be together, but who only truly belonged together at a certain moment. Sometimes the people you love the fiercest are those who, in a different time, in a different place, in a different state of mind, you might never have come to love at all. And Tony&rsquo;s always loved Peter. From the second he knew he existed, he loved him. </p><p>But the right time. </p><p>The perfect time.</p><p>A time where Tony wasn&rsquo;t grieving and drinking and falling into pits of self-destruction and a time where Peter wasn&rsquo;t imploding on the inside with guilt and loss, a time where both of them could come into each other&rsquo;s lives at the perfect moment to acknowledge the worst but bring out the best had yet to come. And Tony&rsquo;s finally entered it. And he has never felt more afraid and yet, a deeper, intense need for anything ever before in his life. </p><p>The competition&rsquo;s started. There are three separate rooms, three separate groups. He enters the Kid&rsquo;s Corner, full of elementary school kids racing through the booths admiring projects their own parents helped them make. Tony takes photos and high-fives children and encourages one shy girl to give a presentation that makes him feel oddly misty. The second room has middle schoolers, probably the worst age group Tony can think of. Even Peter had his days when he was thirteen. And Peter was the sweetest thing since the sugarcane. To be honest, he&rsquo;s so busy navigating the crowds and playing the part that he doesn&rsquo;t really notice the burning in both his hands until he&rsquo;s standing outside the high schooler&rsquo;s room.</p><p>Pepper&rsquo;s cursive writing appears like art on his palm, she&rsquo;s running through her checklist, making sure everything&rsquo;s all set and good to go. It&rsquo;s such a small, common thing. But Tony can&rsquo;t help but think <i>I love you</i> anyway. Pepper always takes such good care of him. Sometimes he doesn&rsquo;t know if he deserves it. But he cherishes it anyway. </p><p>He looks to his right hand and furrows his brows, fond. The kid&rsquo;s freaking out. Nervous about presenting soon and that the lights are on him and there&rsquo;s no way he can compete with all these rich kids when he&rsquo;s a dumpster diver but it would be so cool to win the competition and-</p><p>Tony stops. No way. </p><p>No way.</p><p>It&rsquo;s- it&rsquo;s impossible.</p><p>But it isn&rsquo;t. It isn&rsquo;t impossible. And Tony bursts through the doors, eyes wide, muscles tight, his mouth is open like he wants to shout when the curtains draw open on the stage and everyone stops to stare and Tony stops with them. </p><p>He can barely breathe. </p><p>&ldquo;Presenting Peter Parker and his chemical invention.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter Parker. </p><p>Tony claps his hands to his mouth. Emotions bursting through every part of him. He can&rsquo;t take his eyes off him. Peter. Peter. It&rsquo;s Peter. Peter Parker. And he&rsquo;s wonderful. Boyish brown curls, a shy smile, the gangly teenage body that doesn&rsquo;t quite know how to hold itself in the world. &ldquo;Hi- hi everyone, I&rsquo;m Peter Parker.&rdquo; </p><p>He sounds exactly like Tony&rsquo;s imagined. Young and polite and sweet. So sweet. He&rsquo;s perfect. He&rsquo;s absolutely perfect. And he&rsquo;s happy. And <i>Tony&rsquo;s</i> happy. So so so happy that he&rsquo;s here. And that today&rsquo;s the day. And that even if he doesn&rsquo;t get to meet him at least he got to see him and that&rsquo;s enough for Tony. It&rsquo;s enough. </p><p>But his thoughts must have been too loud. Too emotional and strung and so uncontainable he could power a thousand earths because Peter glances down at his own hand and his eyes widen. His head jerks up. Something like longing in the curve of his brows. Hope that he barely wants to believe. He scans the crowd. Tony and Peter lock eyes and he can tell the exact second that Peter realizes that Tony Stark is his soul-mate. His lip wobbles and he looks like he wants to jump into the crowd and run but Peter&rsquo;s a better kid than Tony ever was and he just shakes his head slightly, like he&rsquo;s laughing to himself, glances at his hand, <i>I&rsquo;m so proud of you</i>, and pushes through his presentation because he knows it has to be done and that they&rsquo;ll have time later. </p><p>Peter&rsquo;s brilliant on stage. More brilliant than Tony ever was and he knows that Peter will be even better with time. Peter finishes his speech with a shy duck of the head and the sweetest half smile that has Tony feeling endeared to him all over again where he&rsquo;s waiting in the wings. Peter catches his eye, smiling so uncontrollably it makes him beam and when the curtains close he launches in Tony&rsquo;s direction, throwing his arms around him like they&rsquo;d done this a million times. </p><p>The first time Tony spoke to Peter, he had cried from gratitude. The first time he got to hold him, his arms wrapped so tightly around him, feeling Peter&rsquo;s fingers around his shoulder, he buries his face in Peter&rsquo;s hair and feels that same gratefulness, that same adoration, that same love for the universe that loved him after all and showed him he could find and give love in return. </p><p>Tony and Peter hold each other tightly and on both their hands, <i>I finally found you</i>. </p></p>",

On her right hand, a bright orange that changed almost every moment, quick and fleeting. Sometimes there&rsquo;d be little drawings, detailed pounding hearts or sloppily constructed portraits. While the orange script vanished and reappeared as a constant, Maria&rsquo;s left hand stayed static, the same dark blue writing having never changed in over twelve years. </p>\n<p>Head perched in his mother&rsquo;s lap, Tony played with her hands, marveling quietly at the contrast. &ldquo;Mama, why don&rsquo;t the red thoughts change anymore?&rdquo; </p>\n<p>Maria pulled her hand back, rubbing her palm with her thumb, almost tracing the words. Tony was old enough to read now. He could see the words <i>I wish I could have met you</i> clearly, written almost like it was scribbled in a rush all along her hand. </p>\n<p>Immediately, the orange writing changed: <i>Don&rsquo;t be sad, I hate it when you&rsquo;re sad</i>. Tony pulled away. Had he upset mama? But quickly, Maria rushed to gather him in her arms, holding him tight. &ldquo;Tony, you remember what the writing means right?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Tony nodded, still trying to figure out whether he had upset his mother or not. &ldquo;The right hand is your soul mate who&rsquo;s your best friend and the left is your soul mate that you marry.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Maria smiled, pinching his cheek. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. And do you remember why the words always change?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s their most important thought.&rdquo; he answered, proud when his mother nodded.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;But sometimes&hellip;&rdquo; her voice trailed off, locked in a pain Tony didn&rsquo;t yet understand, &ldquo;sometimes the words stay frozen because that&rsquo;s the person&rsquo;s last thought.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;How can someone stop thinking?&rdquo; Tony scrunched his nose. </p>\n<p>He knew for sure that could never happen to him. Even when he didn&rsquo;t want them, his thoughts raced faster than even he could keep up with sometimes. Maria looked down at her hand. &ldquo;Sometimes your soul mate dies.&rdquo; she says quietly, &ldquo;And the last thing they ever thought stays on your skin forever.&rdquo; </p>\n<p>Tony frowned. &ldquo;But your soul-mate is supposed to <i>be</i> with you forever.&rdquo; </p>\n<p>&ldquo;At least I had a soul-mate Tony. Some people aren&rsquo;t so lucky.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Tony&rsquo;s frown deepened, a small kernel of anxiety clustering in his stomach, only to grow bigger with time. How could not everyone have a soul mate? That didn&rsquo;t seem fair. Was it because there weren&rsquo;t enough people? Or was it because some people are just impossible to love at all? </p>\n<p>Tony&rsquo;s voice was small, insecure and anxious, &ldquo;Will I get soul-mates?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Maria gathered him in her arms, pressing kisses into his hair. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask questions like that Tony, soul-mates or not, everyone deserves love.&rdquo; </p>\n<p>He wouldn&rsquo;t notice until much later that she never really answered his question. Maybe she had known, even then, that he would be difficult to love. </p>\n</p>",

I feel like it works as an ending for him but it's not the ONLY satisfying conclusion to his arc. I hope someday you can grace us with some happier-ending picture because I could do with one but tbh, you come first, I hope you're doing well while dealing with it. I never thought I'd actually grieve for a character but Tony is special, isn't he..?",

So you decided to get an excuse to go over to his, you went to a deli bought him home made soup, bought cold medicine and pain killers and went to his with the pretext that you&rsquo;re doing what he did for you. You knocked on the door and waited, nothing, you knocked again and you heard footsteps as if someone walks up to the door looked through the peep hole and walked away, you knocked again and nothing. &ldquo;Barnes I can hear you walking around in there!&rdquo; You shouted and then the door opened. Bucky looked rough maybe he was ill, it looked like he didn&rsquo;t shave all week his usual clean shaven or slightly stumble look was replaced with the beginnings of a beard, he was wearing trashy clothes and his hair was a mess. &ldquo;Hi, look I know you don&rsquo;t want to see me and I&rsquo;m 90% sure you&rsquo;re not actually ill but if you are I bought you some stuff because you did it for me it&rsquo;s only fair-&rdquo; You ranted.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want to come in?&rdquo; Bucky cut you off in a deeper voice than usual he sounded broken.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; You asked and he lightly nodded stepping aside to let you in, you walked in expecting the flat to be a complete mess like Bucky but surprisingly it was spotless. You sat down on the couch and Bucky took a seat opposite you neither of you knowing what to say. &ldquo;Is everything okay Bucky? I&rsquo;m worried.&rdquo; You said receiving a deep sigh from Bucky before he hid his face in his palms.</p><p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m gonna quit work and move somewhere else like a new state.&rdquo; Bucky simply said in his broken voice.</p><p>&ldquo;What? Why?&rdquo; You asked confused and also with worry. Would this mean that Bucky was going to be out of your life?</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Bucky said aggravated standing up and starting to pace the room.</p><p>&ldquo;Well you obviously do, considering that you&rsquo;ve made this decision.&rdquo; You stood up angry with how Bucky has been acting these past few days. Bucky ignored you so you continued. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re acting so selfish.&rdquo; You said and Bucky kept pacing. &ldquo;Steve will be devestated and heart broken, your students will be loosing their teacher half way through the year they will be confused and hurt, your friends will all be upset and miss you, need I go on.&rdquo; You continued and Bucky kept pacing and not saying anything. &ldquo;Fucking hell Bucky stop pacing.&rdquo; You said putting your hands on each of his arms in order to make him stand still and he stopped. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; You said with a sigh.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to leave&hellip;&rdquo; Bucky said his voice filled with sadness.</p><p>&ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; You simply said looking up at him to look him in the eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;But I have to.&rdquo; He replied you could see the pain in his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Look whatever you think if forcing you out of here you can fight it.&rdquo; You said hugging Bucky to comfort him. &ldquo;You grew up here, New York is your home don&rsquo;t leave. You have people who will help you, you just need to let us help you.&rdquo; You said and you felt Bucky nod and you let go of him ending the hug.</p><p>&ldquo;Steve&rsquo;s already tried to help me, it didn&rsquo;t work I don&rsquo;t know how to get out of this situation.&rdquo; Bucky said sounding frustrated again and sitting down.</p><p>&ldquo;What situation?&rdquo; You asked calmly sitting down opposite him.</p><p>&ldquo;Me kissing you!&rdquo; Bucky raised his voice making you slightly flinch, you knew he wouldn&rsquo;t hurt you but when he raised his voice he was terrifying.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Bucky I really wanted to help you but if you&rsquo;re childish enough to fucking leave town because of one accidental kiss then I think you should grow up.&rdquo; You said feeling annoyed with his pettiness.</p><p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t accidental, I mean it was, but I wanted to kiss you, of course if I ever was going to actually kiss you on purpose I would&rsquo;ve asked for your consent but I&rsquo;m a fucking idiot, my head just forgot who you were, it felt like we&rsquo;ve been dating for years and that&rsquo;s so fucked up because you&rsquo;re my student and the only way out of this situation is to leave.&rdquo; Bucky ranted.</p><p>&ldquo;Bucky the last thing I want is for you to leave town.&rdquo; You said honestly. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t want you to quit your job for a few reasons, you like what you do, you&rsquo;re good at it and without you I&rsquo;d fail but the last one is a bit selfish.&rdquo; You said and Bucky final smiled a bit.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if we can be friends&hellip;&rdquo; Bucky said sadly.</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; You asked trying not to sound hurt.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m your teacher.&rdquo; Bucky said harshly.</p><p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t our excuse: we were friends before I became your student?&rdquo; You said trying not to get tears in your eyes, you knew you&rsquo;d never date him but you hoped you could stay friends, and now he didn&rsquo;t even want to be your friend?</p><p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m into you, I want to kiss you again, and I shouldn&rsquo;t want to, but if I met you any other way, if you weren&rsquo;t my student, I would&rsquo;ve used every line I know, I would be the best smooth talker in the world, I&rsquo;d do anything just for you to go on one date with me so do you understand why I can&rsquo;t be your teacher why I can&rsquo;t be your friend?&rdquo; Bucky said in a rant his voice filled with desperation and pain. You didn&rsquo;t say anything you reacted on impulse and leaned on and kissed him. The kiss started off slow and when Bucky realised you wanted him as much as he wanted you it began to get hot and messy, it was just as you imagined except with the addition of his scruffy beard. Somehow the two of you were making out on the couch now with Bucky on top of you his arms on either side of you and your arms around him with one of your hands in his hair. Your make out session got abruptly cut short when there was a loud knock on the door. &ldquo;If I ignore it they&rsquo;ll go away.&rdquo; Bucky said inches away from your mouth before continuing to make out with you but another knock followed. Bucky sighed standing up and you laughed at the situation. &ldquo;Should I like hide or stay here? Or what do I do?&rdquo; You whispered as Bucky checked who it is and you saw his eyes widen. &ldquo;Hide. It&rsquo;s Steve. Go in the bedroom.&rdquo; Bucky whispered pointing to the bedroom and you went to hide. It looked exactly the same as the last time you were in there you decided to just sit down on the bed and wait for Steve to leave, however Steve was seeming to take his time or Bucky forgot about you, to make sure you decided to actually pay attention to their conversation. &ldquo;You sound like you&rsquo;re trying to get rid of me bud.&rdquo; You heard Steve say.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not I promise Steve I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo; Bucky replied.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been in this apartment since you kissed Y/N feeling sorry for yourself because you have a crush on a student news flash she probably is into you! So just talk to her like I told you to do before this whole kiss fiasco!&rdquo; You heard Steve say in a very leader like voice, there was a few seconds of silence before Bucky spoke again.</p><p>&ldquo;Why would you think she likes me?&rdquo; Bucky asked as if he&rsquo;s genuinely asking. That dick.</p><p>&ldquo;Well I don&rsquo;t know, she deals with your shit I mean the million times you acted like a dick and she never held a grudge, remember Dot would ignore you till you apologised and it would always be a fight, the two of you at Bruce&rsquo;s party was the cutest thing ever and she came to me asking if you are okay, asking why you aren&rsquo;t coming to work, knowing that you&rsquo;re faking it.&rdquo; Steve explained and you cursed him for outing you like that to Bucky. &ldquo;Look she doesn&rsquo;t take any of your shit. I can&rsquo;t believe I just said that but it&rsquo;s the only way you&rsquo;ll understand. She doesn&rsquo;t, but she still cares for you so much, when you were walking away from her at the cinema she bought you M&amp;Ms not to make you walk her home but to make you happier. And if you don&rsquo;t speak up and tell her how you feel I will.&rdquo; Steve finished his rant and you couldn&rsquo;t help but to laugh slightly to yourself over this whole situation. You couldn&rsquo;t hear anything for a bit and then you heard footsteps approach the door so you panicked and hid on the floor next to the bed pulling a blanket over yourself. &ldquo;Wow you&rsquo;re great at hiding.&rdquo; Bucky said laughing and pulling the blanket off you.</p><p>&ldquo;I panicked.&rdquo; You said and Bucky laughed. &ldquo;So what did Steve want?&rdquo; You asked.</p><p>&ldquo;He wanted me to tell you that I like you.&rdquo; Bucky said stretching out his hand to you to help you up.</p><p>&ldquo;So how do we do this?&rdquo; You asked honestly.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m trying to figure out.&rdquo; Bucky said honestly the two of you going to sit down at the kitchen island to talk.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay let&rsquo;s break it down. So we&rsquo;re dead if the school finds out we&rsquo;re dating&hellip;&rdquo; You began.</p><p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;re dead if we don&rsquo;t tell our friends, Steve will kill me just for me hiding you today.&rdquo; Bucky said honestly. &ldquo;Want anything to drink?&rdquo; Bucky said \u00a0opening the fridge.</p><p>&ldquo;Water please.&rdquo; You replied. &ldquo;Boring.&rdquo; Bucky remarked and you scoffed. &ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; you said making a big deal of changing back the subject. &ldquo;Maybe we only tell the people we can definitely trust, like our closest friends and tell them not to tell anyone.&rdquo; You said and Bucky agreed.</p><p>&ldquo;I think we should cut down how much time we spend with each other around town, because before if anyone said anything we genuinely were just friends and we can&rsquo;t play that card anymore.&rdquo; Bucky said and you agreed but feeling a bit sad because you loved spending time with Bucky and doing things and it will suck to be stuck indoors together all the time.</p><p>&ldquo;No PDA, but that&rsquo;s a given, and maybe it may be a good idea to change the contact names for each other in our phones because one text message seen by the wrong person can cause this to all come crashing down.&rdquo; You said and Bucky agreed.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your middle name?&rdquo; Bucky asked pulling out his phone.</p><p>&ldquo;(Middle/ Name), why?&rdquo; You asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay I have you saved as M/N.&rdquo; Bucky said changing the contact.</p><p>&ldquo;Well I already have you saved as your middle name so that doesn&rsquo;t work, and I can&rsquo;t use your first name because that&rsquo;s also obvious.&rdquo; You said.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, oh use Grant.&rdquo; Bucky said and you have him a confused look. &ldquo;Steve&rsquo;s middle name.&rdquo; Bucky explained. &ldquo;Oh okay.&rdquo; You said changing the name.</p><p>&ldquo;So do you have anywhere to be right now?&rdquo; Bucky asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Nope my professor didn&rsquo;t come in all week so I have no work to do.&rdquo; You said making him chuckle.</p><p>&ldquo;Wow good on him so that means you can stay here a bit longer and watch a movie or something?&rdquo; Bucky asked.</p><p>&ldquo; I would love that.&rdquo; You said with a smile sitting down next to him to watch a film and cuddling up into his side.</p><hr><p><b><strike>Part 9</strike>\u00a0| <a href=\"https://writing-in-the-impala.tumblr.com/post/164495385445/masterlist\">More stuff I wrote</a></b></p><p><b>Tags (send me an ask or message and I\u2019ll add you):</b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8g1Ipk3npYUY3Usv1tQb4w\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8g1Ipk3npYUY3Usv1tQb4w\">@iconictaurus</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_a6WATlQbO86UGaonb86Eg\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_a6WATlQbO86UGaonb86Eg\">@whosmarisaaarw</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHeksqB1hnRuxf3NgrycBjQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHeksqB1hnRuxf3NgrycBjQ\">@grayxswan</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXB8x9oGsrIP83vLEr060zQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXB8x9oGsrIP83vLEr060zQ\">@sideeffectsofyou</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtcd0CpYSugGVgUv0H8BDTg\">@alt-er-love-er-alt</a></p>",

So you decided to get an excuse to go over to his, you went to a deli bought him home made soup, bought cold medicine and pain killers and went to his with the pretext that you\u2019re doing what he did for you. You knocked on the door and waited, nothing, you knocked again and you heard footsteps as if someone walks up to the door looked through the peep hole and walked away, you knocked again and nothing. \u201cBarnes I can hear you walking around in there!\u201d You shouted and then the door opened. Bucky looked rough maybe he was ill, it looked like he didn\u2019t shave all week his usual clean shaven or slightly stumble look was replaced with the beginnings of a beard, he was wearing trashy clothes and his hair was a mess. \u201cHi, look I know you don\u2019t want to see me and I\u2019m 90% sure you\u2019re not actually ill but if you are I bought you some stuff because you did it for me it\u2019s only fair-\u201d You ranted.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to come in?\u201d Bucky cut you off in a deeper voice than usual he sounded broken.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d You asked and he lightly nodded stepping aside to let you in, you walked in expecting the flat to be a complete mess like Bucky but surprisingly it was spotless. You sat down on the couch and Bucky took a seat opposite you neither of you knowing what to say. \u201cIs everything okay Bucky? I\u2019m worried.\u201d You said receiving a deep sigh from Bucky before he hid his face in his palms.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m gonna quit work and move somewhere else like a new state.\u201d Bucky simply said in his broken voice.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d You asked confused and also with worry. Would this mean that Bucky was going to be out of your life?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Bucky said aggravated standing up and starting to pace the room.</p><p>\u201cWell you obviously do, considering that you\u2019ve made this decision.\u201d You stood up angry with how Bucky has been acting these past few days. Bucky ignored you so you continued. \u201cYou\u2019re acting so selfish.\u201d You said and Bucky kept pacing. \u201cSteve will be devestated and heart broken, your students will be loosing their teacher half way through the year they will be confused and hurt, your friends will all be upset and miss you, need I go on.\u201d You continued and Bucky kept pacing and not saying anything. \u201cFucking hell Bucky stop pacing.\u201d You said putting your hands on each of his arms in order to make him stand still and he stopped. \u201cThank you.\u201d You said with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave\u2026\u201d Bucky said his voice filled with sadness.</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t.\u201d You simply said looking up at him to look him in the eyes.</p><p>\u201cBut I have to.\u201d He replied you could see the pain in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cLook whatever you think if forcing you out of here you can fight it.\u201d You said hugging Bucky to comfort him. \u201cYou grew up here, New York is your home don\u2019t leave.

So you decided to get an excuse to go over to his, you went to a deli bought him home made soup, bought cold medicine and pain killers and went to his with the pretext that you\u2019re doing what he did for you. You knocked on the door and waited, nothing, you knocked again and you heard footsteps as if someone walks up to the door looked through the peep hole and walked away, you knocked again and nothing. \u201cBarnes I can hear you walking around in there!\u201d You shouted and then the door opened. Bucky looked rough maybe he was ill, it looked like he didn\u2019t shave all week his usual clean shaven or slightly stumble look was replaced with the beginnings of a beard, he was wearing trashy clothes and his hair was a mess. \u201cHi, look I know you don\u2019t want to see me and I\u2019m 90% sure you\u2019re not actually ill but if you are I bought you some stuff because you did it for me it\u2019s only fair-\u201d You ranted.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to come in?\u201d Bucky cut you off in a deeper voice than usual he sounded broken.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d You asked and he lightly nodded stepping aside to let you in, you walked in expecting the flat to be a complete mess like Bucky but surprisingly it was spotless. You sat down on the couch and Bucky took a seat opposite you neither of you knowing what to say. \u201cIs everything okay Bucky? I\u2019m worried.\u201d You said receiving a deep sigh from Bucky before he hid his face in his palms.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m gonna quit work and move somewhere else like a new state.\u201d Bucky simply said in his broken voice.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d You asked confused and also with worry. Would this mean that Bucky was going to be out of your life?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Bucky said aggravated standing up and starting to pace the room.</p><p>\u201cWell you obviously do, considering that you\u2019ve made this decision.\u201d You stood up angry with how Bucky has been acting these past few days. Bucky ignored you so you continued. \u201cYou\u2019re acting so selfish.\u201d You said and Bucky kept pacing. \u201cSteve will be devestated and heart broken, your students will be loosing their teacher half way through the year they will be confused and hurt, your friends will all be upset and miss you, need I go on.\u201d You continued and Bucky kept pacing and not saying anything. \u201cFucking hell Bucky stop pacing.\u201d You said putting your hands on each of his arms in order to make him stand still and he stopped. \u201cThank you.\u201d You said with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave\u2026\u201d Bucky said his voice filled with sadness.</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t.\u201d You simply said looking up at him to look him in the eyes.</p><p>\u201cBut I have to.\u201d He replied you could see the pain in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cLook whatever you think if forcing you out of here you can fight it.\u201d You said hugging Bucky to comfort him. \u201cYou grew up here, New York is your home don\u2019t leave. You have people who will help you, you just need to let us help you.\u201d You said and you felt Bucky nod and you let go of him ending the hug.</p><p>\u201cSteve\u2019s already tried to help me, it didn\u2019t work I don\u2019t know how to get out of this situation.\u201d Bucky said sounding frustrated again and sitting down.</p><p>\u201cWhat situation?\u201d You asked calmly sitting down opposite him.</p><p>\u201cMe kissing you!\u201d Bucky raised his voice making you slightly flinch, you knew he wouldn\u2019t hurt you but when he raised his voice he was terrifying.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Bucky I really wanted to help you but if you\u2019re childish enough to fucking leave town because of one accidental kiss then I think you should grow up.\u201d You said feeling annoyed with his pettiness.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t accidental, I mean it was, but I wanted to kiss you, of course if I ever was going to actually kiss you on purpose I would\u2019ve asked for your consent but I\u2019m a fucking idiot, my head just forgot who you were, it felt like we\u2019ve been dating for years and that\u2019s so fucked up because you\u2019re my student and the only way out of this situation is to leave.\u201d Bucky ranted.</p><p>\u201cBucky the last thing I want is for you to leave town.\u201d You said honestly. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want you to quit your job for a few reasons, you like what you do, you\u2019re good at it and without you I\u2019d fail but the last one is a bit selfish.\u201d You said and Bucky final smiled a bit.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if we can be friends\u2026\u201d Bucky said sadly.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d You asked trying not to sound hurt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your teacher.\u201d Bucky said harshly.</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t our excuse: we were friends before I became your student?\u201d You said trying not to get tears in your eyes, you knew you\u2019d never date him but you hoped you could stay friends, and now he didn\u2019t even want to be your friend?</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m into you, I want to kiss you again, and I shouldn\u2019t want to, but if I met you any other way, if you weren\u2019t my student, I would\u2019ve used every line I know, I would be the best smooth talker in the world, I\u2019d do anything just for you to go on one date with me so do you understand why I can\u2019t be your teacher why I can\u2019t be your friend?\u201d Bucky said in a rant his voice filled with desperation and pain. You didn\u2019t say anything you reacted on impulse and leaned on and kissed him. The kiss started off slow and when Bucky realised you wanted him as much as he wanted you it began to get hot and messy, it was just as you imagined except with the addition of his scruffy beard. Somehow the two of you were making out on the couch now with Bucky on top of you his arms on either side of you and your arms around him with one of your hands in his hair. Your make out session got abruptly cut short when there was a loud knock on the door. \u201cIf I ignore it they\u2019ll go away.\u201d Bucky said inches away from your mouth before continuing to make out with you but another knock followed. Bucky sighed standing up and you laughed at the situation. \u201cShould I like hide or stay here? Or what do I do?\u201d You whispered as Bucky checked who it is and you saw his eyes widen. \u201cHide. It\u2019s Steve. Go in the bedroom.\u201d Bucky whispered pointing to the bedroom and you went to hide. It looked exactly the same as the last time you were in there you decided to just sit down on the bed and wait for Steve to leave, however Steve was seeming to take his time or Bucky forgot about you, to make sure you decided to actually pay attention to their conversation. \u201cYou sound like you\u2019re trying to get rid of me bud.\u201d You heard Steve say.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not I promise Steve I\u2019m fine.\u201d Bucky replied.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been in this apartment since you kissed Y/N feeling sorry for yourself because you have a crush on a student news flash she probably is into you! So just talk to her like I told you to do before this whole kiss fiasco!\u201d You heard Steve say in a very leader like voice, there was a few seconds of silence before Bucky spoke again.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you think she likes me?\u201d Bucky asked as if he\u2019s genuinely asking. That dick.</p><p>\u201cWell I don\u2019t know, she deals with your shit I mean the million times you acted like a dick and she never held a grudge, remember Dot would ignore you till you apologised and it would always be a fight, the two of you at Bruce\u2019s party was the cutest thing ever and she came to me asking if you are okay, asking why you aren\u2019t coming to work, knowing that you\u2019re faking it.\u201d Steve explained and you cursed him for outing you like that to Bucky. \u201cLook she doesn\u2019t take any of your shit. I can\u2019t believe I just said that but it\u2019s the only way you\u2019ll understand. She doesn\u2019t, but she still cares for you so much, when you were walking away from her at the cinema she bought you M&amp;Ms not to make you walk her home but to make you happier. And if you don\u2019t speak up and tell her how you feel I will.\u201d Steve finished his rant and you couldn\u2019t help but to laugh slightly to yourself over this whole situation. You couldn\u2019t hear anything for a bit and then you heard footsteps approach the door so you panicked and hid on the floor next to the bed pulling a blanket over yourself. \u201cWow you\u2019re great at hiding.\u201d Bucky said laughing and pulling the blanket off you.</p><p>\u201cI panicked.\u201d You said and Bucky laughed. \u201cSo what did Steve want?\u201d You asked.</p><p>\u201cHe wanted me to tell you that I like you.\u201d Bucky said stretching out his hand to you to help you up.</p><p>\u201cSo how do we do this?\u201d You asked honestly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to figure out.\u201d Bucky said honestly the two of you going to sit down at the kitchen island to talk.</p><p>\u201cOkay let\u2019s break it down. So we\u2019re dead if the school finds out we\u2019re dating\u2026\u201d You began.</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019re dead if we don\u2019t tell our friends, Steve will kill me just for me hiding you today.\u201d Bucky said honestly. \u201cWant anything to drink?\u201d Bucky said \u00a0opening the fridge.</p><p>\u201cWater please.\u201d You replied. \u201cBoring.\u201d Bucky remarked and you scoffed. \u201cAnyway,\u201d you said making a big deal of changing back the subject. \u201cMaybe we only tell the people we can definitely trust, like our closest friends and tell them not to tell anyone.\u201d You said and Bucky agreed.</p><p>\u201cI think we should cut down how much time we spend with each other around town, because before if anyone said anything we genuinely were just friends and we can\u2019t play that card anymore.\u201d Bucky said and you agreed but feeling a bit sad because you loved spending time with Bucky and doing things and it will suck to be stuck indoors together all the time.</p><p>\u201cNo PDA, but that\u2019s a given, and maybe it may be a good idea to change the contact names for each other in our phones because one text message seen by the wrong person can cause this to all come crashing down.\u201d You said and Bucky agreed.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your middle name?\u201d Bucky asked pulling out his phone.</p><p>\u201c(Middle/ Name), why?\u201d You asked.</p><p>\u201cOkay I have you saved as M/N.\u201d Bucky said changing the contact.</p><p>\u201cWell I already have you saved as your middle name so that doesn\u2019t work, and I can\u2019t use your first name because that\u2019s also obvious.\u201d You said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, oh use Grant.\u201d Bucky said and you have him a confused look. \u201cSteve\u2019s middle name.\u201d Bucky explained. \u201cOh okay.\u201d You said changing the name.</p><p>\u201cSo do you have anywhere to be right now?\u201d Bucky asked.</p><p>\u201cNope my professor didn\u2019t come in all week so I have no work to do.\u201d You said making him chuckle.</p><p>\u201cWow good on him so that means you can stay here a bit longer and watch a movie or something?\u201d Bucky asked.</p><p>\u201c I would love that.\u201d You said with a smile sitting down next to him to watch a film and cuddling up into his side.</p><hr><p><b><strike>Part 9</strike>\u00a0| <a href=\"https://writing-in-the-impala.tumblr.com/post/164495385445/masterlist\">More stuff I wrote</a></b></p><p><b>Tags (send me an ask or message and I\u2019ll add you):</b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8g1Ipk3npYUY3Usv1tQb4w\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8g1Ipk3npYUY3Usv1tQb4w\">@iconictaurus</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_a6WATlQbO86UGaonb86Eg\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_a6WATlQbO86UGaonb86Eg\">@whosmarisaaarw</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHeksqB1hnRuxf3NgrycBjQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHeksqB1hnRuxf3NgrycBjQ\">@grayxswan</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXB8x9oGsrIP83vLEr060zQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXB8x9oGsrIP83vLEr060zQ\">@sideeffectsofyou</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtcd0CpYSugGVgUv0H8BDTg\">@alt-er-love-er-alt</a></p>",

You have people who will help you, you just need to let us help you.&rdquo; You said and you felt Bucky nod and you let go of him ending the hug.</p><p>&ldquo;Steve&rsquo;s already tried to help me, it didn&rsquo;t work I don&rsquo;t know how to get out of this situation.&rdquo; Bucky said sounding frustrated again and sitting down.</p><p>&ldquo;What situation?&rdquo; You asked calmly sitting down opposite him.</p><p>&ldquo;Me kissing you!&rdquo; Bucky raised his voice making you slightly flinch, you knew he wouldn&rsquo;t hurt you but when he raised his voice he was terrifying.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Bucky I really wanted to help you but if you&rsquo;re childish enough to fucking leave town because of one accidental kiss then I think you should grow up.&rdquo; You said feeling annoyed with his pettiness.</p><p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t accidental, I mean it was, but I wanted to kiss you, of course if I ever was going to actually kiss you on purpose I would&rsquo;ve asked for your consent but I&rsquo;m a fucking idiot, my head just forgot who you were, it felt like we&rsquo;ve been dating for years and that&rsquo;s so fucked up because you&rsquo;re my student and the only way out of this situation is to leave.&rdquo; Bucky ranted.</p><p>&ldquo;Bucky the last thing I want is for you to leave town.&rdquo; You said honestly. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t want you to quit your job for a few reasons, you like what you do, you&rsquo;re good at it and without you I&rsquo;d fail but the last one is a bit selfish.&rdquo; You said and Bucky final smiled a bit.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if we can be friends&hellip;&rdquo; Bucky said sadly.</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; You asked trying not to sound hurt.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m your teacher.&rdquo; Bucky said harshly.</p><p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t our excuse: we were friends before I became your student?&rdquo; You said trying not to get tears in your eyes, you knew you&rsquo;d never date him but you hoped you could stay friends, and now he didn&rsquo;t even want to be your friend?</p><p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m into you, I want to kiss you again, and I shouldn&rsquo;t want to, but if I met you any other way, if you weren&rsquo;t my student, I would&rsquo;ve used every line I know, I would be the best smooth talker in the world, I&rsquo;d do anything just for you to go on one date with me so do you understand why I can&rsquo;t be your teacher why I can&rsquo;t be your friend?&rdquo; Bucky said in a rant his voice filled with desperation and pain. You didn&rsquo;t say anything you reacted on impulse and leaned on and kissed him. The kiss started off slow and when Bucky realised you wanted him as much as he wanted you it began to get hot and messy, it was just as you imagined except with the addition of his scruffy beard. Somehow the two of you were making out on the couch now with Bucky on top of you his arms on either side of you and your arms around him with one of your hands in his hair. Your make out session got abruptly cut short when there was a loud knock on the door. &ldquo;If I ignore it they&rsquo;ll go away.&rdquo; Bucky said inches away from your mouth before continuing to make out with you but another knock followed. Bucky sighed standing up and you laughed at the situation. &ldquo;Should I like hide or stay here? Or what do I do?&rdquo; You whispered as Bucky checked who it is and you saw his eyes widen. &ldquo;Hide. It&rsquo;s Steve. Go in the bedroom.&rdquo; Bucky whispered pointing to the bedroom and you went to hide. It looked exactly the same as the last time you were in there you decided to just sit down on the bed and wait for Steve to leave, however Steve was seeming to take his time or Bucky forgot about you, to make sure you decided to actually pay attention to their conversation. &ldquo;You sound like you&rsquo;re trying to get rid of me bud.&rdquo; You heard Steve say.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not I promise Steve I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo; Bucky replied.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been in this apartment since you kissed Y/N feeling sorry for yourself because you have a crush on a student news flash she probably is into you! So just talk to her like I told you to do before this whole kiss fiasco!&rdquo; You heard Steve say in a very leader like voice, there was a few seconds of silence before Bucky spoke again.</p><p>&ldquo;Why would you think she likes me?&rdquo; Bucky asked as if he&rsquo;s genuinely asking. That dick.</p><p>&ldquo;Well I don&rsquo;t know, she deals with your shit I mean the million times you acted like a dick and she never held a grudge, remember Dot would ignore you till you apologised and it would always be a fight, the two of you at Bruce&rsquo;s party was the cutest thing ever and she came to me asking if you are okay, asking why you aren&rsquo;t coming to work, knowing that you&rsquo;re faking it.&rdquo; Steve explained and you cursed him for outing you like that to Bucky. &ldquo;Look she doesn&rsquo;t take any of your shit. I can&rsquo;t believe I just said that but it&rsquo;s the only way you&rsquo;ll understand. She doesn&rsquo;t, but she still cares for you so much, when you were walking away from her at the cinema she bought you M&amp;Ms not to make you walk her home but to make you happier. And if you don&rsquo;t speak up and tell her how you feel I will.&rdquo; Steve finished his rant and you couldn&rsquo;t help but to laugh slightly to yourself over this whole situation. You couldn&rsquo;t hear anything for a bit and then you heard footsteps approach the door so you panicked and hid on the floor next to the bed pulling a blanket over yourself. &ldquo;Wow you&rsquo;re great at hiding.&rdquo; Bucky said laughing and pulling the blanket off you.</p><p>&ldquo;I panicked.&rdquo; You said and Bucky laughed. &ldquo;So what did Steve want?&rdquo; You asked.</p><p>&ldquo;He wanted me to tell you that I like you.&rdquo; Bucky said stretching out his hand to you to help you up.</p><p>&ldquo;So how do we do this?&rdquo; You asked honestly.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m trying to figure out.&rdquo; Bucky said honestly the two of you going to sit down at the kitchen island to talk.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay let&rsquo;s break it down. So we&rsquo;re dead if the school finds out we&rsquo;re dating&hellip;&rdquo; You began.</p><p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;re dead if we don&rsquo;t tell our friends, Steve will kill me just for me hiding you today.&rdquo; Bucky said honestly. &ldquo;Want anything to drink?&rdquo; Bucky said &nbsp;opening the fridge.</p><p>&ldquo;Water please.&rdquo; You replied. &ldquo;Boring.&rdquo; Bucky remarked and you scoffed. &ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; you said making a big deal of changing back the subject. &ldquo;Maybe we only tell the people we can definitely trust, like our closest friends and tell them not to tell anyone.&rdquo; You said and Bucky agreed.</p><p>&ldquo;I think we should cut down how much time we spend with each other around town, because before if anyone said anything we genuinely were just friends and we can&rsquo;t play that card anymore.&rdquo; Bucky said and you agreed but feeling a bit sad because you loved spending time with Bucky and doing things and it will suck to be stuck indoors together all the time.</p><p>&ldquo;No PDA, but that&rsquo;s a given, and maybe it may be a good idea to change the contact names for each other in our phones because one text message seen by the wrong person can cause this to all come crashing down.&rdquo; You said and Bucky agreed.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your middle name?&rdquo; Bucky asked pulling out his phone.</p><p>&ldquo;(Middle/ Name), why?&rdquo; You asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay I have you saved as M/N.&rdquo; Bucky said changing the contact.</p><p>&ldquo;Well I already have you saved as your middle name so that doesn&rsquo;t work, and I can&rsquo;t use your first name because that&rsquo;s also obvious.&rdquo; You said.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, oh use Grant.&rdquo; Bucky said and you have him a confused look. &ldquo;Steve&rsquo;s middle name.&rdquo; Bucky explained. &ldquo;Oh okay.&rdquo; You said changing the name.</p><p>&ldquo;So do you have anywhere to be right now?&rdquo; Bucky asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Nope my professor didn&rsquo;t come in all week so I have no work to do.&rdquo; You said making him chuckle.</p><p>&ldquo;Wow good on him so that means you can stay here a bit longer and watch a movie or something?&rdquo; Bucky asked.</p><p>&ldquo; I would love that.&rdquo; You said with a smile sitting down next to him to watch a film and cuddling up into his side.</p><hr /><p><b><strike>Part 9</strike>&nbsp;| <a href=\"https://writing-in-the-impala.tumblr.com/post/164495385445/masterlist\">More stuff I wrote</a></b></p><p><b>Tags (send me an ask or message and I&rsquo;ll add you):</b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8g1Ipk3npYUY3Usv1tQb4w\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8g1Ipk3npYUY3Usv1tQb4w\">@iconictaurus</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_a6WATlQbO86UGaonb86Eg\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_a6WATlQbO86UGaonb86Eg\">@whosmarisaaarw</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHeksqB1hnRuxf3NgrycBjQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHeksqB1hnRuxf3NgrycBjQ\">@grayxswan</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXB8x9oGsrIP83vLEr060zQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXB8x9oGsrIP83vLEr060zQ\">@sideeffectsofyou</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtcd0CpYSugGVgUv0H8BDTg\">@alt-er-love-er-alt</a></p>",
