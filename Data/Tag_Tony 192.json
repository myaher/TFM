I knew there were still many preparations for the evening\u2019s Christmas Dinner, that\u2019s why I pulled myself together quickly and headed to the kitchen to do what was needed to be done. Wanda and Vision were already there doing some things and Bruce was sitting at the table drinking coffee.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d I greeted them. </p><p>\u201cOh, hey (y/n),\u201d Bruce replied. \u201cWe made bets who will show up next. Vision won.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a surprise,\u201d I said ironically. \u201cHe\u2019s a super high-tech computer so he probably developed an algorithm based on who wakes up and when.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey! Don\u2019t talk about me like I wasn\u2019t there! Instead of babbling you could better get to work, there is a lot to do.\u201d </p><p>I nodded and got on with polishing the tableware. The morning went on painfully slowly and the omnipresent smell of Christmas dishes made the wait for the feast even more difficult. </p><p>\u201cThe most annoying thing about Christmas Dinner is that everybody wants to eat but nobody wants to prepare it. And you Bruce, since you\u2019re here, you could at least pretend you\u2019re doing something useful,\u201d Wanda broke the silence. </p><p>\u201cYou guys are doing great, I\u2019d only disturb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I murmured and approached Bruce with a handful of plates. \u201cLay them out on the table and when you\u2019re done come back for plates for soup and cutlery. Oh, and try not to break anything.\u201d</p><p>Bruce murmured something under his breath and exited the kitchen. When I was done polishing, I went on to preparing sweet potatoes for the mash. We were working in silence until Peter Parker entered the kitchen. </p><p>\u201cWell hello there! Why so silent? Let\u2019s turn on some music to add ourselves the spirit!\u201d He exclaimed happily.</p><p>I looked at him amused. \u201cHi spider-boy! I assume you came here to help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course! I\u2019ll turn on the radio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea what we would do without you,\u201d Vision growled slightly annoyed. </p><p>Peter turned on the music and came up to me asking if there was anything for him to do. I ordered him to peel and drill apples for the pie and later prepare the mulled wine. So, the work went on, but this time with Christmas tunes coming out of the speakers. When the Italian song <i>Acapulco</i>by Ricchi&amp;Poveri started to play, Wanda stopped in her tracks. </p><p>\u201cWhy would they play a summer hit at this time of year?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cActually, the song is not a summer hit. It says that in Italy, when Christmas come, people go to Acapulco to use some sun,\u201d I explained. </p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>We finished the work around noon, and everyone headed to their rooms to get ready for the evening. The first thing I did was checking if all presents are ready and prepared as they should be \u2013 packed and signed. For Thor I got a plaid flannel shirt and hammer-patterned boxers, for Bruce the <i>Jurassic Park </i>trilogy on Blu-ray and a Rubik\u2019s Cube, for Bucky sleeves with fake tattoos and an iPod, for Peter a backpack and a Death Star Lego set, for Nat super-stylish velvet Ray-Ban sunglasses, for Tony a Gameboy and games, for Captain an electric shaver and Metallica\u2019s <i>Black Album</i>, for Sam new running shoes, for Vision a sonic toothbrush, for Wanda a pillow with Vision\u2019s face and a digital photo frame with some pictures of her and Vision I\u2019ve secretly taken, for Clint a GPS locator, for T\u2019Challa new Hawaiian-patterned swimming trunks and for Rhodey a voucher to spa. I even got a gift for the newest Avengers Tower resident, who was Loki, Thor\u2019s brother. I got him an ugly Christmas sweater and the whole series of <i>The Saxon Stories </i>by Bernard Cornwell. Loki was still and outcast among Avengers, they all still remembered how he tried to take over the world. But even so I didn\u2019t want him to be alienated on a day like this. </p><p>After checking the presents I moved on to making myself beautiful for the Dinner. I took a shower, washed my hair and applied some stunning make-up. For the occasion I chose a black skirt, an ugly Christmas sweater, similar to the one I bought for Loki and a Santa Claus hat. When I was all set, I took the gifts and headed to the dining room. Almost everyone was already there except for Thor and his brother. I put all presents under the tree and took a place at the table. Soon came Thor and announced that his brother won\u2019t be joining us for the Christmas Dinner. A sigh of relief could be heard, and the atmosphere relaxed a little. I was wondering if I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s not happy about this. Okay, I knew Loki was evil and tricky, but it\u2019s Christmas! Supposedly even animals speak in a human voice on this one special evening. </p><p>\u201cSince everyone is finally here, I\u2019d like to wish you all a Merry Christmas and let\u2019s get down to eating!\u201d Tony announced.</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas!\u201d Everyone replied and the sound of chattering cutlery filled the room. There were so many dishes, all so delicious, and I wanted to try them all, but at some point my stomach was so full that I had to take a break. </p><p>\u201cHey, Clint, would you mind pouring me some mulled wine?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSure thing, (y/n),\u201d Clint replied, smiling as he handed me the mug full hot liquid. \u201cAre you done earing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, for now. I\u2019m sooo full,\u201d I said, patting my belly. \u201cI look as if I was pregnant.\u201d</p><p>My words made Clint laugh. \u201cI\u2019ve had enough too, shall we get down to presents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that would be rude!\u201d I reproached. \u201cWe have to wait until everyone finishes eating.\u201d</p><p>I liked Clint, he was one of my favourites at the Avengers Tower. Behind a seemingly inaccessible fa\u00e7ade he was an incredibly nice and warm guy, a big child really. My second favourite was Peter Parker a.k.a. Spider-boy and he was the one to speak up next. \u201cCan we already move to the presents?\u201d He asked loudly. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still eating, would you, please, let me finish?\u201d Thor protested. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re always eating, Thor,\u201d Natasha teased. \u201cI\u2019m also voting for the presents.\u201d</p><p>Everybody nodded and got up from their places, leaving almighty Thor, the God of Thunder, alone at the table. Unpacking presents gave everyone a lot of joy. Some of them were funny and some really useful. Among many voices I heard Vision saying quietly why would someone get him a toothbrush. I got many books, a set of beanie and gloves a, a t-shirt saying <i>I &lt;3 NY</i>and earrings. After some time the only present under the tree was the one I prepared for Loki. </p><p>\u201cWho on Earth would buy a present for this freak?\u201d Sam asked turning the package around in his hands. </p><p>\u201cMe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too good, (y/n).\u201d </p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d I agreed. </p><p>From that moment the atmosphere tensed a little, but everyone went on to their own business. Natasha and Bruce were kissing in the corner, Tony, Clint, Sam and Rhodey got engaged in a drinking contest, Vision and Wanda left, T\u2019Challa and Cap were playing table football and Peter and Bucky started to put the Death Star together. I moved away from the group and sat in front of the glass wall, looking at the city and drinking tea. It was dark and Christmas lights were perfectly visible. The view calmed me down. The glass wall showed the reflection of Thor approaching me. </p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d He said sitting beside me. </p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThat you don\u2019t see my brother as a monster,\u201d The man explained. \u201cHe did many things wrong but he\u2019s trying to be good. I wish everyone could see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019s just lost?\u201d I suggested. \u201cYou were brothers and best friends when you were young and then he found out he\u2019s not your real brother, that your father took him away from his home planet. Maybe he\u2019s lost his identity and feels he doesn\u2019t belong anywhere? Maybe he did all these dreadful things because he was trying to find his place in the universe?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou know, (y/n), you might be right. But everyone\u2019s aversion won\u2019t help him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo talk to him. He needs to understand that fixing his relations with everyone here will take some time, but if he sticks to his decision it will eventually pay off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Thor said and got up to leave. \u201cAnd thank you for the boxers, they\u2019re wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me, it was the Santa Claus.\u201d </p><hr><p>It got really late and I was the only one left in the dining room. I didn\u2019t even realize when everyone left, I was so drowned in my thoughts. I decided to go to sleep too, but first\u2026I took a glance at the lonely package under the Christmas tree. I knew I had to be the one to make the first move, and to get to my room I had to go past Loki\u2019s anyway, so I decided to give him the gift in person. I took the package and headed in the right direction, vigorously at first but as I was getting close I slowed down my pace, losing my initial confidence. What if, in fact, Loki was so evil? I shook of all negative thoughts. He came to the Avengers Tower on his own accord, he must\u2019ve had good intentions. </p><p>When I stood at his door I had to fight another battle with myself. <i>And what if he\u2019s asleep and I\u2019ll wake him up and make him angry?</i>And then: <i>No, I have to try!</i>I knocked on the door slightly and held my breath for a few seconds. There was no response. And just when I was about to leave the door opened slightly.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I heard Loki\u2019s smooth voice.</p><p>I turned around to face the door again. \u201cYou didn\u2019t join us for the Christmas Dinner and Santa Claus left something for you too,\u201d I said walking back to the door. Loki opened the door some more and I saw he was dressed in black sweatpants only. </p><p>\u201cSome kind-hearted creature cared to get me a present. This can\u2019t be. Where\u2019s the trick?\u201d Loki asked suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cThere is none, I swear,\u201d I promised in a voice just above a whisper. </p><p>\u201cWhy do you even care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I believe you\u2019re not evil, just lost. I bought you a series of books by my favourite author, let me know if you like them.\u201d With these words I turned to leave but stopped after few steps and turned around. \u201cOh, and Loki, Merry Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas, (y/n).\u201d Loki whispered and quickly closed the door behind him not to let me see tears forming in his eyes. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"209\" data-orig-width=\"1858\" style=\"\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/959e6b7592b57b20edabcae6250fa5fe/tumblr_inline_pjy7z9lVxx1r22qhm_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"209\" data-orig-width=\"1858\"/></figure><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-VKdlT8mNZmmNrbC4kUciw\">@kuroshikine</a></p>",

I knew there were still many preparations for the evening\u2019s Christmas Dinner, that\u2019s why I pulled myself together quickly and headed to the kitchen to do what was needed to be done. Wanda and Vision were already there doing some things and Bruce was sitting at the table drinking coffee.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d I greeted them. </p><p>\u201cOh, hey (y/n),\u201d Bruce replied. \u201cWe made bets who will show up next. Vision won.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a surprise,\u201d I said ironically. \u201cHe\u2019s a super high-tech computer so he probably developed an algorithm based on who wakes up and when.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey! Don\u2019t talk about me like I wasn\u2019t there! Instead of babbling you could better get to work, there is a lot to do.\u201d </p><p>I nodded and got on with polishing the tableware. The morning went on painfully slowly and the omnipresent smell of Christmas dishes made the wait for the feast even more difficult. </p><p>\u201cThe most annoying thing about Christmas Dinner is that everybody wants to eat but nobody wants to prepare it. And you Bruce, since you\u2019re here, you could at least pretend you\u2019re doing something useful,\u201d Wanda broke the silence. </p><p>\u201cYou guys are doing great, I\u2019d only disturb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I murmured and approached Bruce with a handful of plates. \u201cLay them out on the table and when you\u2019re done come back for plates for soup and cutlery. Oh, and try not to break anything.\u201d</p><p>Bruce murmured something under his breath and exited the kitchen. When I was done polishing, I went on to preparing sweet potatoes for the mash. We were working in silence until Peter Parker entered the kitchen. </p><p>\u201cWell hello there! Why so silent? Let\u2019s turn on some music to add ourselves the spirit!\u201d He exclaimed happily.</p><p>I looked at him amused. \u201cHi spider-boy! I assume you came here to help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course! I\u2019ll turn on the radio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea what we would do without you,\u201d Vision growled slightly annoyed. </p><p>Peter turned on the music and came up to me asking if there was anything for him to do. I ordered him to peel and drill apples for the pie and later prepare the mulled wine. So, the work went on, but this time with Christmas tunes coming out of the speakers. When the Italian song <i>Acapulco</i>by Ricchi&amp;Poveri started to play, Wanda stopped in her tracks. </p><p>\u201cWhy would they play a summer hit at this time of year?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cActually, the song is not a summer hit. It says that in Italy, when Christmas come, people go to Acapulco to use some sun,\u201d I explained. </p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>We finished the work around noon, and everyone headed to their rooms to get ready for the evening. The first thing I did was checking if all presents are ready and prepared as they should be \u2013 packed and signed. For Thor I got a plaid flannel shirt and hammer-patterned boxers, for Bruce the <i>Jurassic Park </i>trilogy on Blu-ray and a Rubik\u2019s Cube, for Bucky sleeves with fake tattoos and an iPod, for Peter a backpack and a Death Star Lego set, for Nat super-stylish velvet Ray-Ban sunglasses, for Tony a Gameboy and games, for Captain an electric shaver and Metallica\u2019s <i>Black Album</i>, for Sam new running shoes, for Vision a sonic toothbrush, for Wanda a pillow with Vision\u2019s face and a digital photo frame with some pictures of her and Vision I\u2019ve secretly taken, for Clint a GPS locator, for T\u2019Challa new Hawaiian-patterned swimming trunks and for Rhodey a voucher to spa. I even got a gift for the newest Avengers Tower resident, who was Loki, Thor\u2019s brother. I got him an ugly Christmas sweater and the whole series of <i>The Saxon Stories </i>by Bernard Cornwell. Loki was still and outcast among Avengers, they all still remembered how he tried to take over the world. But even so I didn\u2019t want him to be alienated on a day like this. </p><p>After checking the presents I moved on to making myself beautiful for the Dinner. I took a shower, washed my hair and applied some stunning make-up. For the occasion I chose a black skirt, an ugly Christmas sweater, similar to the one I bought for Loki and a Santa Claus hat. When I was all set, I took the gifts and headed to the dining room. Almost everyone was already there except for Thor and his brother. I put all presents under the tree and took a place at the table. Soon came Thor and announced that his brother won\u2019t be joining us for the Christmas Dinner. A sigh of relief could be heard, and the atmosphere relaxed a little. I was wondering if I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s not happy about this. Okay, I knew Loki was evil and tricky, but it\u2019s Christmas! Supposedly even animals speak in a human voice on this one special evening. </p><p>\u201cSince everyone is finally here, I\u2019d like to wish you all a Merry Christmas and let\u2019s get down to eating!\u201d Tony announced.</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas!\u201d Everyone replied and the sound of chattering cutlery filled the room.

I\u2019ll turn on the radio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea what we would do without you,\u201d Vision growled slightly annoyed. </p><p>Peter turned on the music and came up to me asking if there was anything for him to do. I ordered him to peel and drill apples for the pie and later prepare the mulled wine. So, the work went on, but this time with Christmas tunes coming out of the speakers. When the Italian song <i>Acapulco</i>by Ricchi&amp;Poveri started to play, Wanda stopped in her tracks. </p><p>\u201cWhy would they play a summer hit at this time of year?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cActually, the song is not a summer hit. It says that in Italy, when Christmas come, people go to Acapulco to use some sun,\u201d I explained. </p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>We finished the work around noon, and everyone headed to their rooms to get ready for the evening. The first thing I did was checking if all presents are ready and prepared as they should be \u2013 packed and signed. For Thor I got a plaid flannel shirt and hammer-patterned boxers, for Bruce the <i>Jurassic Park </i>trilogy on Blu-ray and a Rubik\u2019s Cube, for Bucky sleeves with fake tattoos and an iPod, for Peter a backpack and a Death Star Lego set, for Nat super-stylish velvet Ray-Ban sunglasses, for Tony a Gameboy and games, for Captain an electric shaver and Metallica\u2019s <i>Black Album</i>, for Sam new running shoes, for Vision a sonic toothbrush, for Wanda a pillow with Vision\u2019s face and a digital photo frame with some pictures of her and Vision I\u2019ve secretly taken, for Clint a GPS locator, for T\u2019Challa new Hawaiian-patterned swimming trunks and for Rhodey a voucher to spa. I even got a gift for the newest Avengers Tower resident, who was Loki, Thor\u2019s brother. I got him an ugly Christmas sweater and the whole series of <i>The Saxon Stories </i>by Bernard Cornwell. Loki was still and outcast among Avengers, they all still remembered how he tried to take over the world. But even so I didn\u2019t want him to be alienated on a day like this. </p><p>After checking the presents I moved on to making myself beautiful for the Dinner. I took a shower, washed my hair and applied some stunning make-up. For the occasion I chose a black skirt, an ugly Christmas sweater, similar to the one I bought for Loki and a Santa Claus hat. When I was all set, I took the gifts and headed to the dining room. Almost everyone was already there except for Thor and his brother. I put all presents under the tree and took a place at the table. Soon came Thor and announced that his brother won\u2019t be joining us for the Christmas Dinner. A sigh of relief could be heard, and the atmosphere relaxed a little. I was wondering if I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s not happy about this. Okay, I knew Loki was evil and tricky, but it\u2019s Christmas! Supposedly even animals speak in a human voice on this one special evening. </p><p>\u201cSince everyone is finally here, I\u2019d like to wish you all a Merry Christmas and let\u2019s get down to eating!\u201d Tony announced.</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas!\u201d Everyone replied and the sound of chattering cutlery filled the room. There were so many dishes, all so delicious, and I wanted to try them all, but at some point my stomach was so full that I had to take a break. </p><p>\u201cHey, Clint, would you mind pouring me some mulled wine?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSure thing, (y/n),\u201d Clint replied, smiling as he handed me the mug full hot liquid. \u201cAre you done earing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, for now. I\u2019m sooo full,\u201d I said, patting my belly. \u201cI look as if I was pregnant.\u201d</p><p>My words made Clint laugh. \u201cI\u2019ve had enough too, shall we get down to presents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that would be rude!\u201d I reproached. \u201cWe have to wait until everyone finishes eating.\u201d</p><p>I liked Clint, he was one of my favourites at the Avengers Tower. Behind a seemingly inaccessible fa\u00e7ade he was an incredibly nice and warm guy, a big child really. My second favourite was Peter Parker a.k.a. Spider-boy and he was the one to speak up next. \u201cCan we already move to the presents?\u201d He asked loudly. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still eating, would you, please, let me finish?\u201d Thor protested. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re always eating, Thor,\u201d Natasha teased. \u201cI\u2019m also voting for the presents.\u201d</p><p>Everybody nodded and got up from their places, leaving almighty Thor, the God of Thunder, alone at the table. Unpacking presents gave everyone a lot of joy. Some of them were funny and some really useful. Among many voices I heard Vision saying quietly why would someone get him a toothbrush. I got many books, a set of beanie and gloves a, a t-shirt saying <i>I &lt;3 NY</i>and earrings. After some time the only present under the tree was the one I prepared for Loki. </p><p>\u201cWho on Earth would buy a present for this freak?\u201d Sam asked turning the package around in his hands. </p><p>\u201cMe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too good, (y/n).\u201d </p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d I agreed. </p><p>From that moment the atmosphere tensed a little, but everyone went on to their own business. Natasha and Bruce were kissing in the corner, Tony, Clint, Sam and Rhodey got engaged in a drinking contest, Vision and Wanda left, T\u2019Challa and Cap were playing table football and Peter and Bucky started to put the Death Star together. I moved away from the group and sat in front of the glass wall, looking at the city and drinking tea. It was dark and Christmas lights were perfectly visible. The view calmed me down. The glass wall showed the reflection of Thor approaching me. </p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d He said sitting beside me. </p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThat you don\u2019t see my brother as a monster,\u201d The man explained. \u201cHe did many things wrong but he\u2019s trying to be good. I wish everyone could see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019s just lost?\u201d I suggested. \u201cYou were brothers and best friends when you were young and then he found out he\u2019s not your real brother, that your father took him away from his home planet. Maybe he\u2019s lost his identity and feels he doesn\u2019t belong anywhere? Maybe he did all these dreadful things because he was trying to find his place in the universe?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou know, (y/n), you might be right. But everyone\u2019s aversion won\u2019t help him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo talk to him. He needs to understand that fixing his relations with everyone here will take some time, but if he sticks to his decision it will eventually pay off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Thor said and got up to leave. \u201cAnd thank you for the boxers, they\u2019re wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me, it was the Santa Claus.\u201d </p><hr><p>It got really late and I was the only one left in the dining room. I didn\u2019t even realize when everyone left, I was so drowned in my thoughts. I decided to go to sleep too, but first\u2026I took a glance at the lonely package under the Christmas tree. I knew I had to be the one to make the first move, and to get to my room I had to go past Loki\u2019s anyway, so I decided to give him the gift in person. I took the package and headed in the right direction, vigorously at first but as I was getting close I slowed down my pace, losing my initial confidence. What if, in fact, Loki was so evil? I shook of all negative thoughts. He came to the Avengers Tower on his own accord, he must\u2019ve had good intentions. </p><p>When I stood at his door I had to fight another battle with myself. <i>And what if he\u2019s asleep and I\u2019ll wake him up and make him angry?</i>And then: <i>No, I have to try!</i>I knocked on the door slightly and held my breath for a few seconds. There was no response. And just when I was about to leave the door opened slightly.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I heard Loki\u2019s smooth voice.</p><p>I turned around to face the door again. \u201cYou didn\u2019t join us for the Christmas Dinner and Santa Claus left something for you too,\u201d I said walking back to the door. Loki opened the door some more and I saw he was dressed in black sweatpants only. </p><p>\u201cSome kind-hearted creature cared to get me a present. This can\u2019t be. Where\u2019s the trick?\u201d Loki asked suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cThere is none, I swear,\u201d I promised in a voice just above a whisper. </p><p>\u201cWhy do you even care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I believe you\u2019re not evil, just lost. I bought you a series of books by my favourite author, let me know if you like them.\u201d With these words I turned to leave but stopped after few steps and turned around. \u201cOh, and Loki, Merry Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas, (y/n).\u201d Loki whispered and quickly closed the door behind him not to let me see tears forming in his eyes. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"209\" data-orig-width=\"1858\" style=\"\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/959e6b7592b57b20edabcae6250fa5fe/tumblr_inline_pjy7z9lVxx1r22qhm_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"209\" data-orig-width=\"1858\"></figure><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-VKdlT8mNZmmNrbC4kUciw\">@kuroshikine</a></p>",

I knew there were still many preparations for the evening&rsquo;s Christmas Dinner, that&rsquo;s why I pulled myself together quickly and headed to the kitchen to do what was needed to be done. Wanda and Vision were already there doing some things and Bruce was sitting at the table drinking coffee.</p><p>&ldquo;Morning,&rdquo; I greeted them. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, hey (y/n),&rdquo; Bruce replied. &ldquo;We made bets who will show up next. Vision won.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What a surprise,&rdquo; I said ironically. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a super high-tech computer so he probably developed an algorithm based on who wakes up and when.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey! Don&rsquo;t talk about me like I wasn&rsquo;t there! Instead of babbling you could better get to work, there is a lot to do.&rdquo; </p><p>I nodded and got on with polishing the tableware. The morning went on painfully slowly and the omnipresent smell of Christmas dishes made the wait for the feast even more difficult. </p><p>&ldquo;The most annoying thing about Christmas Dinner is that everybody wants to eat but nobody wants to prepare it. And you Bruce, since you&rsquo;re here, you could at least pretend you&rsquo;re doing something useful,&rdquo; Wanda broke the silence. </p><p>&ldquo;You guys are doing great, I&rsquo;d only disturb.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; I murmured and approached Bruce with a handful of plates. &ldquo;Lay them out on the table and when you&rsquo;re done come back for plates for soup and cutlery. Oh, and try not to break anything.&rdquo;</p><p>Bruce murmured something under his breath and exited the kitchen. When I was done polishing, I went on to preparing sweet potatoes for the mash. We were working in silence until Peter Parker entered the kitchen. </p><p>&ldquo;Well hello there! Why so silent? Let&rsquo;s turn on some music to add ourselves the spirit!&rdquo; He exclaimed happily.</p><p>I looked at him amused. &ldquo;Hi spider-boy! I assume you came here to help?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, of course!
