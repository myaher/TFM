NOTE: This blog is Gendarya, Team Dragonstone-friendly. This blog is NOT J*nsa-friendly or supportive of Jon or Dany's past romantic pairings. I don't actively hate on them on here in public.

The dwarf had given him the truth on the road north, but by then it had been too late. Jon wondered if his father had known what the Wall would be like. He must have, he thought; that only made it hurt the worse.</p><p>Even his uncle had abandoned him in this cold place at the end of the world. Up here, the genial Benjen Stark he had known became a different person. He was First Ranger, and he spent his days and nights with Lord Commander Mormont and Maester Aemon and the other high officers, while Jon was given over to the less than tender charge of Ser Alliser Thorne.\u201d<br/></p></blockquote><p>Meanwhile, Arya sees that the rules of justice and heroism she was taught were nothing but hollow words, which damages the trust and faith she had in her father and the household guards she thought of as friends:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThis was the first time they had supped with the men since arriving in King&rsquo;s Landing. Arya hated it. She hated the sounds of their voices now, the way they laughed, the stories they told. They&rsquo;d been her friends, she&rsquo;d felt safe around them, but now she knew that was a lie. They&rsquo;d let the queen kill Lady, that was horrible enough, but then the Hound found Mycah. Jeyne Poole had told Arya that he&rsquo;d cut him up in so many pieces that they&rsquo;d given him back to the butcher in a bag, and at first the poor man had thought it was a pig they&rsquo;d slaughtered. And no one had raised a voice or drawn a blade or anything, not Harwin who always talked so bold, or Alyn who was going to be a knight, or Jory who was captain of the guard. Not even her father.\u201d<br/></p></blockquote><p>Both Jon and Arya are forced to let go of part of their childhood ideals and see the harsher realities of their world. Unfortunately, that includes realizing that their father isn\u2019t perfect. This, in addition to other factors, leads to both of them feeling isolated without anyone to fully trust:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cJon followed the rest back to the armory, walking alone. He often walked alone here. There were almost twenty in the group he trained with, yet not one he could call a friend.\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cIf he must be alone, he would make solitude his armor.\u201d<br/></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cNo one talked to Arya. She didn&rsquo;t care. She liked it that way. She would have eaten her meals alone in her bedchamber if they let her.\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cShe found herself wishing that Jon was here with her now. Then maybe she wouldn&rsquo;t feel so alone.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Their longing for each other and their brothers are even similar:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThat was when Arya missed her brothers most. She wanted to tease Bran and play with baby Rickon and have Robb smile at her. She wanted Jon to muss up her hair and call her &ldquo;little sister&rdquo; and finish her sentences with her.\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cHe missed his true brothers: little Rickon, bright eyes shining as he begged for a sweet; Robb, his rival and best friend and constant companion; Bran, stubborn and curious, always wanting to follow and join in whatever Jon and Robb were doing. &hellip; And Arya \u2026 he missed her even more than Robb, skinny little thing that she was, all scraped knees and tangled hair and torn clothes, so fierce and willful. Arya never seemed to fit, no more than he had \u2026 yet she could always make Jon smile. He would give anything to be with her now, to muss up her hair once more and watch her make a face, to hear her finish a sentence with him.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>They also have similar nightmares with Arya running around the Red Keep looking for Ned while Jon\u2019s dreams take him to an empty Winterfell looking for his family.</p><p>It\u2019s also interesting that they\u2019re able to find happiness in their new situations through arms training. Arya gains a new dancing instructor who fits her unique style while Jon becomes an instructor himself, rather than bullying the other recruits. They\u2019re both able to gain genuine confidence while building new relationships.</p>",

They\u2019d let the queen kill Lady, that was horrible enough, but then the Hound found Mycah. Jeyne Poole had told Arya that he\u2019d cut him up in so many pieces that they\u2019d given him back to the butcher in a bag, and at first the poor man had thought it was a pig they\u2019d slaughtered.

This, in addition to other factors, leads to both of them feeling isolated without anyone to fully trust:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cJon followed the rest back to the armory, walking alone. He often walked alone here.

She didn\u2019t care. She liked it that way. She would have eaten her meals alone in her bedchamber if they let her.\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cShe found herself wishing that Jon was here with her now. Then maybe she wouldn\u2019t feel so alone.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Their longing for each other and their brothers are even similar:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThat was when Arya missed her brothers most. She wanted to tease Bran and play with baby Rickon and have Robb smile at her. She wanted Jon to muss up her hair and call her \u201clittle sister\u201d and finish her sentences with her.\u201d</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cHe missed his true brothers: little Rickon, bright eyes shining as he begged for a sweet; Robb, his rival and best friend and constant companion; Bran, stubborn and curious, always wanting to follow and join in whatever Jon and Robb were doing. \u2026 And Arya \u2026 he missed her even more than Robb, skinny little thing that she was, all scraped knees and tangled hair and torn clothes, so fierce and willful. Arya never seemed to fit, no more than he had \u2026 yet she could always make Jon smile. He would give anything to be with her now, to muss up her hair once more and watch her make a face, to hear her finish a sentence with him.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>They also have similar nightmares with Arya running around the Red Keep looking for Ned while Jon\u2019s dreams take him to an empty Winterfell looking for his family.</p><p>It\u2019s also interesting that they\u2019re able to find happiness in their new situations through arms training.
