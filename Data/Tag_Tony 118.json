Isn\u2019t it supposed to be the other way around?\u201d </p><p>\u201cTo be fair, wasn\u2019t a slight bump.\u201d Pepper corrected. \u201cit was a concussion&ndash;</p><p>\u201c&ndash; a <i>slight </i>concussion.\u201d </p><p>\u201c&ndash;and he has every right to be sore at you for it, it was tag-football Tasha, not tackle football.\u201d She tossed Natasha a magazine and went back to opening bills. \u201cWhat about Steve or Bucky? You couldn\u2019t give those two concussions if you tried and they have no problem kicking your butt if you\u2019re feeling vicious.\u201d </p><!-- more --><p>\u201cSteve is teaching an art class and Bucky volunteered to be his model&ndash;\u201d Pepper\u2019s jaw dropped and Natasha nodded. \u201cI know, I have a million questions about it too. But they are busy, and Clint\u2019s being a whiner and Tony barricaded himself in his lab to work on something devious&ndash;\u201d </p><p>\u201c&ndash;he\u2019s one bad lab accident from a super villain.\u201d Pepper confirmed, her lips twitching in a smile. \u201cBut he\u2019s so gosh darn cute in those big goggles and that ridiculous white coat Bruce makes him wear, it\u2019s almost worth it.\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>Anyway</i>, Tony\u2019s busy so I can\u2019t drag him off for sex and you threatened me with bodily harm if I disturbed you today&ndash;\u201d </p><p>\u201cI did no such thing!\u201d Pepper protested and when Natasha just <i>looked </i>at her, she protested again&ndash; \u201cI\u2019m <i>busy </i>today, Nat! This is the only free time I have today and you should be glad I\u2019m spending it with you and not our boyfriend because let\u2019s face it, it\u2019s been so long since he\u2019s actually come to bed at a decent hour I\u2019m starting to think he broke up with us and just didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTony would never break up with us.\u201d Nat said confidently. \u201cHe thinks it&rsquo;s too funny to constantly remind Sam that there are exactly <i>two </i>beautiful women in this compound and we <i>both </i>sleep in his bed.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes, well we are rather beautiful, aren\u2019t we?\u201d Pepper\u2019s cheeks tinted a soft pink and first Natasha smiled over it and then her eyes flew open wide and&ndash;</p><p>\u201cWhat if we have a contest!\u201d she cried. \u201cThat would take care of my boredom and my viciousness!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>When Pepper narrowed her eyes suspiciously, Nat hurried to add, \u201cNot like the ultimate hide and go seek one from last month, don\u2019t worry. But what if we had a contest just you and Tony and I?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Pepper scanned through her last piece of mail. \u201cWhat sort of contest would this be then? And remember, it can\u2019t be naked. Bucky almost had a heart attack the last time Tony lost a bet and had to cook breakfast in nothing but an apron and a thong. Those sorts of bets are off limits now.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo aprons and thongs required for this one.\u201d Nat assured her. \u201cWhat if&ndash; and hear me out&ndash; what if we see who can make which of the three of us blush the hardest?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re more excited by that prospect than I am.\u201d Pepper said dryly. \u201cBecause I\u2019m so pale I blush if my heart rate picks up at all, whereas you walked in on Steve and Bucky watching porn last week and didn\u2019t so much as blink. I think the odds are unfairly skewed in your favor.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIn my defense&ndash;\u201d Nat held up her hand when Pepper started laughing. \u201cIt was some terrible super hero parody porn and no one would ever think that was sexy, much less blush worthy. And second of all&ndash;\u201d she raised her voice when Pepper only laughed harder. \u201c&ndash; <i>second </i>of all, what if only you and I knew about the contest?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOnly you and I?\u201d Pepper repeated. \u201cSo what, we\u2019d just be competing to try and make each other blush and Tony would have no idea what\u2019s going on? Where\u2019s the fun in that?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThe <i>fun</i>&ndash;\u201d Natasha emphasized. \u201cWould be when Tony can\u2019t keep his hands off us because I know for a fact he has a complete kink for seeing me do something that makes you blush.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh he does no&ndash;\u201d </p><p>\u201cNew Years Eve.\u201d Natasha challenged. \u201cYou were wearing a silver dress and I used your braid to yank you down so we could kiss and you turned tomato red and Tony&ndash;\u201d </p><p>\u201c&ndash;locked us both in the bedroom all night and then instead of breakfast in bed we had&ndash;\u201d Predictably, Pepper turned bright pink. \u201cOh my. He does have a little bit of a kink for that doesn\u2019t he?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo if I\u2019m going to be making you blush all the time, and you\u2019re going to be acting bold and scandalous to make me blush\u2026.?\u201d Natasha let the question hang there as Pepper\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYep. Could be fun, right?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell then, how do we know who wins?\u201d The discarded mail went into the trash and Pepper dusted off her hands. \u201cIf the point is to just get Tony into bed, how do we keep score?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhichever one breaks him first.\u201d Natasha patted her thighs, and Pepper came willingly, folding her tall frame onto the smaller redheads lap. \u201cWe\u2019ll judge his reactions based on how red he turns, how much he stammers and whoever does something that gets him to drag us both to bed first, wins.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTasha, I do love when your vicious moods play out and no one gets hurt.\u201d Pepper looked her arms around Natasha\u2019s neck and kissed her square on the lips. \u201cThough I suppose I love you when you\u2019re stabby too.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019m glad to hear it.\u201d Natasha grinned and kissed her back. \u201cGame starts tomorrow, okay?\u201d </p><p>\u201cGet ready to lose, Romanov.\u201d Pepper threatened playfully, and Natasha retaliated with a &ndash;\u00a0\u201cYour ass is mine, Potts!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a shame.\u201d Pepper giggled and Natasha blew her a kiss.\u00a0\u201cTomorrow then. Be ready.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>*******************<br/></p><p>Most people assumed Tony Stark was full of himself, focused only what he wanted and oblivious to anything or anyone else. He was never anywhere he needed to be on time, he couldn\u2019t be bothered to remember birthdays or important dates, and despite constant assurances to the negative, the press was sure that he was playing <i>both </i>Natasha and Pepper because that\u2019s the only thing that possibly made sense. No way he loved them both, not billionaire playboy Tony Stark. One day the tabloids announced that he was only dating Ms. Potts because she was his boss, the next everyone was sure that Natasha was blackmailing him somehow&ndash; on and on it went. </p><p>Of course anyone who knew Tony in the slightest was well aware that he was head over heels for both the always put together Pepper Potts and femme fatale Natasha Romanov. And he never remembered birthdays, but he never forgot anyone\u2019s favorite coffee and ordered the specific sheets that Clint liked and had the sensors in the Tower set to change anytime Bucky was in a room since he still had triggers after his Winter Soldier time. Tony noticed everything and was oblivious to nothing&ndash;</p><p>&ndash;But <i>boy howdy</i> was he caught off guard when Natasha walked into the living room wearing a white crop top that showed off her stomach and little flashes of&ndash; <i>eep</i>! Under bosoms!&ndash; and snake skin pants riding low enough to show her thong, swaggered up to Pepper and brought her in for a long, <i>filthy </i>kiss. </p><p>\u201cWhat&ndash;What&ndash; <i>hnnnngh</i>!\u201d Tony gaped at the scene&ndash; his prim proper Pepper palming over Natasha\u2019s rear, the snakeskin pants hanging on for dear life, in immediate peril of exposing much more cheek than the spy had intended. \u201cNatasha! <i>Clothes</i>!\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy do you mean, clothes?\u201d Nat asked lazily, wiping a smudge of lipstick off Pepper\u2019s face and smirking when she saw the tell tale streak of red on Pepper\u2019s cheek. \u201cI\u2019m wearing clothes.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot&ndash;not many of them!\u201d Tony stammered. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard the term \u2018whale tail\u2019 since like, 2002 but good <i>Christ</i>!\u201d </p><p>\u201cCalm down, Tony.\u201d Natasha snapped the unbelievably skimpy line of her thong and winked at their boyfriend. \u201cYou\u2019ve see me in less.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI&ndash; You&ndash; urgh&ndash;\u201d Tony kept stammering as Natasha sauntered right back out, and he had no idea why she pulled out a notebook and made a mark in it, just like he had no idea why Pepper cursed and also pulled out a notebook and made a mark in it, but he didn\u2019t really care. </p><p>Natasha in snakeskin pants? </p><p>Heaven save him.</p><p>******************</p><p>Pepper Potts was practically perfect in every way, the best dressed in any room she walked into, somehow stylish in nothing more than a pair of Nat\u2019s cut off shorties and one of Tony\u2019s white button down, and a literal goddess in a floor length gown. </p><p>Natasha had seen the woman in everything from pin striped pant suits to fishnet lingerie and anything in between, but she had <i>not </i>seen Pepper in a black skirt just a hint too tight and a hint too short and a blouse unbuttoned just on this side too low.</p><p>\u201cOh fuck me.\u201d Natasha interrupted the briefing when she swore out loud, staring opened mouth at her girlfriend as Pepper sat that adorable ass upon the conference table and crossed long <i>long </i>legs one over the other, showing off the thigh high slit in that damnable black skirt and&ndash;</p><p>\u201cMs. Potts!\u201d Tony sounded like he really might be choking to death when he caught sight of the color inked high up on Pepper\u2019s thigh, bright flowers and flowing vines wrapping around her leg and disappearing out of eye sight further beyond the cut to <i>whoo </i>skirt. \u201cIs that&ndash; are you&ndash;\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo fair.\u201d Natasha breathed, face flushing a dull red, green eyes glowing with something altogether wicked, and Pepper simply tossed her hair over her shoulder and handed Tony something else to sign, smiling prettily into his shell shocked expression. </p><p>\u201cThank you, sweetheart.\u201d She cooed when Tony handed her back the file, and with a little more swing in her hips than strictly necessary, Pepper left the room so the briefing could resume. </p><p>Not that Steve could remember what the hell he\u2019d been briefing anyone on, and not that Bucky was thinking about anything else but the <i>situation </i>in his jeans and Clint and Sam weren\u2019t doing much better. Tony\u2019s jaw was still somewhere near the vicinity of the floor and Natasha was muttering curses under her breath as she dug out her notebook again and made another mark. </p><p>Briefly, Tony wondered which god he\u2019d pleased so much to have not one but <i>two </i>redheads who seemed intent on making him explode, and then he pulled out his phone and texted Thor:</p><p><b>From Iron Man</b>: <i>Hey God of Fertility, you are awesome</i></p><p><b>From Thor</b>: <i>I AM AWARE</i></p><p>*****************</p><p>*****************</p><p>Natasha had a scar on her abdomen, the result of a bullet that had gone through her and into someone else, and she tended to wear camisoles and shorty shorts to the beach or pool just to avoid stares and the smattering of freckles she accumulated after just a few minutes in the sun. </p><p>Pepper freckled too, in the sort of sophisticated way she did everything, so she was one for sun hats and cover ups as she lounged on deck chairs at the poolside cabana and sipped at her no- doubt low fat drink. </p><p>But when Tony went out to the pool to swim a few laps, he found not just one but <i>two </i>women in bathing suits that were nothing more than strategically placed bits of cloth held together by a smattering of strings and the occasional buckle. </p><p>Pepper in a plunging white monokini that was more like a <i>no</i>-kini and Natasha in what might have passed for a bikini in certain sketchy circles, but was really a collection of sparkles and tassels that somehow stayed put as she chased Pepper around, tackling her girlfriend into the grass and smearing sun tan lotion in a graceless, completely Tony approved way until Pepper had enough and rolled them over a few feet to dunk in the pool. </p><p>Then there were screams and giggles and&ndash; \u201cOh look at that.\u201d Tony gulped. \u201cThe suits are just about see through.\u201d &ndash; and playful kisses and greedy hands and&ndash; \u201cHo-ho-holy shit&ndash;\u201d Tony had to suddenly sit down, towel held over his lap when they both <strike>bounced jiggled </strike>walked out of the pool and dried each other off, teasing and laughing at each other. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pretty red, my love.\u201d Pepper rubbed a towel through her long hair. \u201cI think I win this round.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI dunno, I made you blush hard enough you got spontaneous freckles.\u201d Natasha pointed out, brushing her fingers over Pepper\u2019s collarbone. \u201cI think <i>I</i> win this round.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell to be fair,\u201d Pepper inclined her head towards Tony. \u201cI think we might have broken our boyfriend. There\u2019s no way he\u2019s going to be able to walk for a while, and that towel isn\u2019t hiding as much as he thinks it is, so maybe we call this round a tie.\u201d </p><p>\u201cShould we have pity on him and take him to bed?\u201d Natasha reached out and tugged at an errant strap, correcting it before Pepper\u2019s entire top came off, and trying not to laugh when Tony made a high pitched noise behind them. </p><p>\u201cNo no, the bet was that <i>he </i>has to break and take us to bed.\u201d Pepper adjusted a tassel that wasn\u2019t quite doing it\u2019s job anymore. \u201cSo. This one is a tie?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI suppose so.\u201d Natasha\u2019s eyes sparked. \u201cBut <i>I </i>can take you to bed, right?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMs. Romanov, I think you should.\u201d</p><p>*******************</p><p>There was nothing heinous nor distracting nor naked &ndash; or any combination of the three&ndash; planned on Thursday morning, so Pepper and Natasha cuddled up together in their fluffiest robes and shared a cup of coffee while reading through the paper and waiting for Tony to come down for breakfast. </p><p>\u201cAre we still tied?\u201d Natasha asked absentmindedly, weaving their fingers together, and Pepper hummed a response, adding, \u201cFive to five darling. We\u2019ll have to step it up if Tony is going to break soon. I\u2019ll tell you, I was his assistant for years and never saw a single <i>ounce </i>on impulse control from that man, but all the sudden he\u2019s a picture of restraint. It\u2019s baffling.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s baffling, beautiful?\u201d Tony made his appearance for the day, swooping down to kiss both of them good morning and getting himself a cup of coffee. \u201cYou\u2019re so smart, I can\u2019t imagine there\u2019s anything that <i>really </i>baffles you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d Pepper answered cheekily and Natasha kicked her foot under the table. \u201cHow are you this morning, love?\u201d </p><p>\u201cStill a genius.\u201d Tony winked and pushed two identical sized boxes towards them. \u201cI got you something.\u201d </p><p>\u201cPresents!\u201d Pepper cried and while Natasha wasn\u2019t as outwardly excited, she still snatched her box as fast as she could and tore off the wrapping paper.</p><p>\u201cYou&ndash; you bought me a gun?\u201d She hefted the handgun in her palm, admiring the weight and feel, the way it fit her fingers perfectly, then turned it over and&ndash; \u201cWhy is there sparkly things on my gun, Tony? That\u2019s not the proper place for sparkly things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, this is lovely.\u201d Pepper admired her necklace, the way it shone against the velvet box, the uniquely green stones gleaming in the light. \u201cWhat design is this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen it before.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThis is a journey design.\u201d \u00a0Tony touched Pepper\u2019s necklace, then drew a line along the matching design on the grip of Natasha\u2019s gun. \u201cIt looks like a river, and represents the journey of life&ndash; where we\u2019ve been, where we are, and where we are going together.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Pepper turned light pink, her breath hitching. \u201cThis is so thoughtful.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNat.\u201d Tony tapped at the stones. \u201cI had these created specifically for you. They are the exact shade of your eyes, lighter here for when you laugh, darker here for when you\u2019re&ndash;\u201d he cleared his throat meaningfully, and it was Natasha\u2019s turn to flush. \u201cThere is no other gemstone in the world the same color as these ones right here, because there\u2019s no one else in the world like you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd Pepper&ndash;\u201d he turned back to the necklace. \u201cThese are the same color as your eyes, too, and some of them have white cut through like lightning because when your eyes flash in laughter or anger or anything I&ndash;\u201d Pepper bit her lip and Tony grinned. \u201c&ndash; I love it every time.

But they are busy, and Clint\u2019s being a whiner and Tony barricaded himself in his lab to work on something devious\u2013\u201d </p><p>\u201c\u2013he\u2019s one bad lab accident from a super villain.\u201d Pepper confirmed, her lips twitching in a smile. \u201cBut he\u2019s so gosh darn cute in those big goggles and that ridiculous white coat Bruce makes him wear, it\u2019s almost worth it.\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>Anyway</i>, Tony\u2019s busy so I can\u2019t drag him off for sex and you threatened me with bodily harm if I disturbed you today\u2013\u201d </p><p>\u201cI did no such thing!\u201d Pepper protested and when Natasha just <i>looked </i>at her, she protested again\u2013 \u201cI\u2019m <i>busy </i>today, Nat! This is the only free time I have today and you should be glad I\u2019m spending it with you and not our boyfriend because let\u2019s face it, it\u2019s been so long since he\u2019s actually come to bed at a decent hour I\u2019m starting to think he broke up with us and just didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTony would never break up with us.\u201d Nat said confidently. \u201cHe thinks it\u2019s too funny to constantly remind Sam that there are exactly <i>two </i>beautiful women in this compound and we <i>both </i>sleep in his bed.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes, well we are rather beautiful, aren\u2019t we?\u201d Pepper\u2019s cheeks tinted a soft pink and first Natasha smiled over it and then her eyes flew open wide and\u2013</p><p>\u201cWhat if we have a contest!\u201d she cried. \u201cThat would take care of my boredom and my viciousness!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>When Pepper narrowed her eyes suspiciously, Nat hurried to add, \u201cNot like the ultimate hide and go seek one from last month, don\u2019t worry. But what if we had a contest just you and Tony and I?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Pepper scanned through her last piece of mail. \u201cWhat sort of contest would this be then? And remember, it can\u2019t be naked. Bucky almost had a heart attack the last time Tony lost a bet and had to cook breakfast in nothing but an apron and a thong. Those sorts of bets are off limits now.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo aprons and thongs required for this one.\u201d Nat assured her. \u201cWhat if\u2013 and hear me out\u2013 what if we see who can make which of the three of us blush the hardest?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re more excited by that prospect than I am.\u201d Pepper said dryly. \u201cBecause I\u2019m so pale I blush if my heart rate picks up at all, whereas you walked in on Steve and Bucky watching porn last week and didn\u2019t so much as blink. I think the odds are unfairly skewed in your favor.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIn my defense\u2013\u201d Nat held up her hand when Pepper started laughing. \u201cIt was some terrible super hero parody porn and no one would ever think that was sexy, much less blush worthy. And second of all\u2013\u201d she raised her voice when Pepper only laughed harder. \u201c\u2013 <i>second </i>of all, what if only you and I knew about the contest?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOnly you and I?\u201d Pepper repeated. \u201cSo what, we\u2019d just be competing to try and make each other blush and Tony would have no idea what\u2019s going on? Where\u2019s the fun in that?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThe <i>fun</i>\u2013\u201d Natasha emphasized. \u201cWould be when Tony can\u2019t keep his hands off us because I know for a fact he has a complete kink for seeing me do something that makes you blush.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh he does no\u2013\u201d </p><p>\u201cNew Years Eve.\u201d Natasha challenged. \u201cYou were wearing a silver dress and I used your braid to yank you down so we could kiss and you turned tomato red and Tony\u2013\u201d </p><p>\u201c\u2013locked us both in the bedroom all night and then instead of breakfast in bed we had\u2013\u201d Predictably, Pepper turned bright pink. \u201cOh my. He does have a little bit of a kink for that doesn\u2019t he?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo if I\u2019m going to be making you blush all the time, and you\u2019re going to be acting bold and scandalous to make me blush\u2026.?\u201d Natasha let the question hang there as Pepper\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYep. Could be fun, right?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell then, how do we know who wins?\u201d The discarded mail went into the trash and Pepper dusted off her hands. \u201cIf the point is to just get Tony into bed, how do we keep score?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhichever one breaks him first.\u201d Natasha patted her thighs, and Pepper came willingly, folding her tall frame onto the smaller redheads lap. \u201cWe\u2019ll judge his reactions based on how red he turns, how much he stammers and whoever does something that gets him to drag us both to bed first, wins.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTasha, I do love when your vicious moods play out and no one gets hurt.\u201d Pepper looked her arms around Natasha\u2019s neck and kissed her square on the lips. \u201cThough I suppose I love you when you\u2019re stabby too.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019m glad to hear it.\u201d Natasha grinned and kissed her back. \u201cGame starts tomorrow, okay?\u201d </p><p>\u201cGet ready to lose, Romanov.\u201d Pepper threatened playfully, and Natasha retaliated with a \u2013\u00a0\u201cYour ass is mine, Potts!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a shame.\u201d Pepper giggled and Natasha blew her a kiss.\u00a0\u201cTomorrow then. Be ready.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>*******************<br></p><p>Most people assumed Tony Stark was full of himself, focused only what he wanted and oblivious to anything or anyone else. He was never anywhere he needed to be on time, he couldn\u2019t be bothered to remember birthdays or important dates, and despite constant assurances to the negative, the press was sure that he was playing <i>both </i>Natasha and Pepper because that\u2019s the only thing that possibly made sense. No way he loved them both, not billionaire playboy Tony Stark. One day the tabloids announced that he was only dating Ms. Potts because she was his boss, the next everyone was sure that Natasha was blackmailing him somehow\u2013 on and on it went. </p><p>Of course anyone who knew Tony in the slightest was well aware that he was head over heels for both the always put together Pepper Potts and femme fatale Natasha Romanov. And he never remembered birthdays, but he never forgot anyone\u2019s favorite coffee and ordered the specific sheets that Clint liked and had the sensors in the Tower set to change anytime Bucky was in a room since he still had triggers after his Winter Soldier time. Tony noticed everything and was oblivious to nothing\u2013</p><p>\u2013But <i>boy howdy</i> was he caught off guard when Natasha walked into the living room wearing a white crop top that showed off her stomach and little flashes of\u2013 <i>eep</i>! Under bosoms!\u2013 and snake skin pants riding low enough to show her thong, swaggered up to Pepper and brought her in for a long, <i>filthy </i>kiss. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2013What\u2013 <i>hnnnngh</i>!\u201d Tony gaped at the scene\u2013 his prim proper Pepper palming over Natasha\u2019s rear, the snakeskin pants hanging on for dear life, in immediate peril of exposing much more cheek than the spy had intended. \u201cNatasha! <i>Clothes</i>!\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy do you mean, clothes?\u201d Nat asked lazily, wiping a smudge of lipstick off Pepper\u2019s face and smirking when she saw the tell tale streak of red on Pepper\u2019s cheek. \u201cI\u2019m wearing clothes.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot\u2013not many of them!\u201d Tony stammered. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard the term \u2018whale tail\u2019 since like, 2002 but good <i>Christ</i>!\u201d </p><p>\u201cCalm down, Tony.\u201d Natasha snapped the unbelievably skimpy line of her thong and winked at their boyfriend. \u201cYou\u2019ve see me in less.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2013 You\u2013 urgh\u2013\u201d Tony kept stammering as Natasha sauntered right back out, and he had no idea why she pulled out a notebook and made a mark in it, just like he had no idea why Pepper cursed and also pulled out a notebook and made a mark in it, but he didn\u2019t really care. </p><p>Natasha in snakeskin pants? </p><p>Heaven save him.</p><p>******************</p><p>Pepper Potts was practically perfect in every way, the best dressed in any room she walked into, somehow stylish in nothing more than a pair of Nat\u2019s cut off shorties and one of Tony\u2019s white button down, and a literal goddess in a floor length gown. </p><p>Natasha had seen the woman in everything from pin striped pant suits to fishnet lingerie and anything in between, but she had <i>not </i>seen Pepper in a black skirt just a hint too tight and a hint too short and a blouse unbuttoned just on this side too low.</p><p>\u201cOh fuck me.\u201d Natasha interrupted the briefing when she swore out loud, staring opened mouth at her girlfriend as Pepper sat that adorable ass upon the conference table and crossed long <i>long </i>legs one over the other, showing off the thigh high slit in that damnable black skirt and\u2013</p><p>\u201cMs. Potts!\u201d Tony sounded like he really might be choking to death when he caught sight of the color inked high up on Pepper\u2019s thigh, bright flowers and flowing vines wrapping around her leg and disappearing out of eye sight further beyond the cut to <i>whoo </i>skirt. \u201cIs that\u2013 are you\u2013\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo fair.\u201d Natasha breathed, face flushing a dull red, green eyes glowing with something altogether wicked, and Pepper simply tossed her hair over her shoulder and handed Tony something else to sign, smiling prettily into his shell shocked expression. </p><p>\u201cThank you, sweetheart.\u201d She cooed when Tony handed her back the file, and with a little more swing in her hips than strictly necessary, Pepper left the room so the briefing could resume. </p><p>Not that Steve could remember what the hell he\u2019d been briefing anyone on, and not that Bucky was thinking about anything else but the <i>situation </i>in his jeans and Clint and Sam weren\u2019t doing much better. Tony\u2019s jaw was still somewhere near the vicinity of the floor and Natasha was muttering curses under her breath as she dug out her notebook again and made another mark. </p><p>Briefly, Tony wondered which god he\u2019d pleased so much to have not one but <i>two </i>redheads who seemed intent on making him explode, and then he pulled out his phone and texted Thor:</p><p><b>From Iron Man</b>: <i>Hey God of Fertility, you are awesome</i></p><p><b>From Thor</b>: <i>I AM AWARE</i></p><p>*****************</p><p>*****************</p><p>Natasha had a scar on her abdomen, the result of a bullet that had gone through her and into someone else, and she tended to wear camisoles and shorty shorts to the beach or pool just to avoid stares and the smattering of freckles she accumulated after just a few minutes in the sun. </p><p>Pepper freckled too, in the sort of sophisticated way she did everything, so she was one for sun hats and cover ups as she lounged on deck chairs at the poolside cabana and sipped at her no- doubt low fat drink. </p><p>But when Tony went out to the pool to swim a few laps, he found not just one but <i>two </i>women in bathing suits that were nothing more than strategically placed bits of cloth held together by a smattering of strings and the occasional buckle. </p><p>Pepper in a plunging white monokini that was more like a <i>no</i>-kini and Natasha in what might have passed for a bikini in certain sketchy circles, but was really a collection of sparkles and tassels that somehow stayed put as she chased Pepper around, tackling her girlfriend into the grass and smearing sun tan lotion in a graceless, completely Tony approved way until Pepper had enough and rolled them over a few feet to dunk in the pool. </p><p>Then there were screams and giggles and\u2013 \u201cOh look at that.\u201d Tony gulped. \u201cThe suits are just about see through.\u201d \u2013 and playful kisses and greedy hands and\u2013 \u201cHo-ho-holy shit\u2013\u201d Tony had to suddenly sit down, towel held over his lap when they both <strike>bounced jiggled </strike>walked out of the pool and dried each other off, teasing and laughing at each other. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pretty red, my love.\u201d Pepper rubbed a towel through her long hair. \u201cI think I win this round.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI dunno, I made you blush hard enough you got spontaneous freckles.\u201d Natasha pointed out, brushing her fingers over Pepper\u2019s collarbone. \u201cI think <i>I</i> win this round.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell to be fair,\u201d Pepper inclined her head towards Tony. \u201cI think we might have broken our boyfriend. There\u2019s no way he\u2019s going to be able to walk for a while, and that towel isn\u2019t hiding as much as he thinks it is, so maybe we call this round a tie.\u201d </p><p>\u201cShould we have pity on him and take him to bed?\u201d Natasha reached out and tugged at an errant strap, correcting it before Pepper\u2019s entire top came off, and trying not to laugh when Tony made a high pitched noise behind them. </p><p>\u201cNo no, the bet was that <i>he </i>has to break and take us to bed.\u201d Pepper adjusted a tassel that wasn\u2019t quite doing it\u2019s job anymore. \u201cSo. This one is a tie?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI suppose so.\u201d Natasha\u2019s eyes sparked. \u201cBut <i>I </i>can take you to bed, right?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMs. Romanov, I think you should.\u201d</p><p>*******************</p><p>There was nothing heinous nor distracting nor naked \u2013 or any combination of the three\u2013 planned on Thursday morning, so Pepper and Natasha cuddled up together in their fluffiest robes and shared a cup of coffee while reading through the paper and waiting for Tony to come down for breakfast. </p><p>\u201cAre we still tied?\u201d Natasha asked absentmindedly, weaving their fingers together, and Pepper hummed a response, adding, \u201cFive to five darling. We\u2019ll have to step it up if Tony is going to break soon. I\u2019ll tell you, I was his assistant for years and never saw a single <i>ounce </i>on impulse control from that man, but all the sudden he\u2019s a picture of restraint. It\u2019s baffling.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s baffling, beautiful?\u201d Tony made his appearance for the day, swooping down to kiss both of them good morning and getting himself a cup of coffee. \u201cYou\u2019re so smart, I can\u2019t imagine there\u2019s anything that <i>really </i>baffles you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d Pepper answered cheekily and Natasha kicked her foot under the table. \u201cHow are you this morning, love?\u201d </p><p>\u201cStill a genius.\u201d Tony winked and pushed two identical sized boxes towards them. \u201cI got you something.\u201d </p><p>\u201cPresents!\u201d Pepper cried and while Natasha wasn\u2019t as outwardly excited, she still snatched her box as fast as she could and tore off the wrapping paper.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2013 you bought me a gun?\u201d She hefted the handgun in her palm, admiring the weight and feel, the way it fit her fingers perfectly, then turned it over and\u2013 \u201cWhy is there sparkly things on my gun, Tony? That\u2019s not the proper place for sparkly things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, this is lovely.\u201d Pepper admired her necklace, the way it shone against the velvet box, the uniquely green stones gleaming in the light. \u201cWhat design is this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen it before.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThis is a journey design.\u201d \u00a0Tony touched Pepper\u2019s necklace, then drew a line along the matching design on the grip of Natasha\u2019s gun. \u201cIt looks like a river, and represents the journey of life\u2013 where we\u2019ve been, where we are, and where we are going together.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Pepper turned light pink, her breath hitching. \u201cThis is so thoughtful.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNat.\u201d Tony tapped at the stones. \u201cI had these created specifically for you. They are the exact shade of your eyes, lighter here for when you laugh, darker here for when you\u2019re\u2013\u201d he cleared his throat meaningfully, and it was Natasha\u2019s turn to flush. \u201cThere is no other gemstone in the world the same color as these ones right here, because there\u2019s no one else in the world like you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd Pepper\u2013\u201d he turned back to the necklace. \u201cThese are the same color as your eyes, too, and some of them have white cut through like lightning because when your eyes flash in laughter or anger or anything I\u2013\u201d Pepper bit her lip and Tony grinned. \u201c\u2013 I love it every time. Different from Nat\u2019s in every way, but equally as stunning. It\u2019s one of a kind, just like you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cChrist.\u201d Natasha choked out, red from her collar clear to the tips of her ears and Pepper wasn\u2019t doing much better, her pale skin nearly crimson. \u201cTony, this is\u2013\u201d </p><p>\u201cTony, I don\u2019t even know what to\u2013\u201d Pepper shook his head.\u00a0\u201cWhy\u2013\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAnd because I know Pepper is way more dangerous than she looks, and Natasha loves pretty things too\u2013\u201d Tony handed them two more boxes, and Pepper laughed when she opened a handgun with her design on the grip, and Natasha sighed happily when she held up a journey stone necklace as well. \u201cLoving you two is a journey I don\u2019t want to ever end.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He smecked a kiss onto both their cheeks.\u00a0\u201cIf you two decide you want to spend some time together\u2013\u201d\u00a0</p><p> \u201cGet you ass upstairs.\u201d Natasha demanded and Pepper echoed\u2013 \u201cAnd you should be naked when we get there.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Tony saluted them teasingly and headed out the door, leaving them to smile and blush,\u00a0<i>oohing </i>and <i>ahhing </i>over each others gems.<br></p><p>\u201cAre you gonna tell them you knew about the bet?\u201d Steve asked under his breath as Tony passed him in the dining room. </p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Tony shook his head. \u201cBut let\u2019s be honest, I definitely won.\u201d </p><p style=\"\">*****************************</p><p><b><a href=\"https://not-close-to-straight.tumblr.com/ask\">SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE

I thought you were going to mess around on that obstacle course Tony had put in.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cClint\u2019s still pouting because of that slight bump on the head I gave him last week.\u201d Natasha leaned her chair back and plonked her feet on the table. \u201cYou know, I think he\u2019s getting whinier the older he gets. Isn\u2019t it supposed to be the other way around?\u201d </p><p>\u201cTo be fair, wasn\u2019t a slight bump.\u201d Pepper corrected. \u201cit was a concussion\u2013</p><p>\u201c\u2013 a <i>slight </i>concussion.\u201d </p><p>\u201c\u2013and he has every right to be sore at you for it, it was tag-football Tasha, not tackle football.\u201d She tossed Natasha a magazine and went back to opening bills. \u201cWhat about Steve or Bucky? You couldn\u2019t give those two concussions if you tried and they have no problem kicking your butt if you\u2019re feeling vicious.\u201d </p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cSteve is teaching an art class and Bucky volunteered to be his model\u2013\u201d Pepper\u2019s jaw dropped and Natasha nodded. \u201cI know, I have a million questions about it too. But they are busy, and Clint\u2019s being a whiner and Tony barricaded himself in his lab to work on something devious\u2013\u201d </p><p>\u201c\u2013he\u2019s one bad lab accident from a super villain.\u201d Pepper confirmed, her lips twitching in a smile. \u201cBut he\u2019s so gosh darn cute in those big goggles and that ridiculous white coat Bruce makes him wear, it\u2019s almost worth it.\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>Anyway</i>, Tony\u2019s busy so I can\u2019t drag him off for sex and you threatened me with bodily harm if I disturbed you today\u2013\u201d </p><p>\u201cI did no such thing!\u201d Pepper protested and when Natasha just <i>looked </i>at her, she protested again\u2013 \u201cI\u2019m <i>busy </i>today, Nat! This is the only free time I have today and you should be glad I\u2019m spending it with you and not our boyfriend because let\u2019s face it, it\u2019s been so long since he\u2019s actually come to bed at a decent hour I\u2019m starting to think he broke up with us and just didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTony would never break up with us.\u201d Nat said confidently. \u201cHe thinks it\u2019s too funny to constantly remind Sam that there are exactly <i>two </i>beautiful women in this compound and we <i>both </i>sleep in his bed.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes, well we are rather beautiful, aren\u2019t we?\u201d Pepper\u2019s cheeks tinted a soft pink and first Natasha smiled over it and then her eyes flew open wide and\u2013</p><p>\u201cWhat if we have a contest!\u201d she cried. \u201cThat would take care of my boredom and my viciousness!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>When Pepper narrowed her eyes suspiciously, Nat hurried to add, \u201cNot like the ultimate hide and go seek one from last month, don\u2019t worry. But what if we had a contest just you and Tony and I?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Pepper scanned through her last piece of mail. \u201cWhat sort of contest would this be then? And remember, it can\u2019t be naked. Bucky almost had a heart attack the last time Tony lost a bet and had to cook breakfast in nothing but an apron and a thong. Those sorts of bets are off limits now.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo aprons and thongs required for this one.\u201d Nat assured her. \u201cWhat if\u2013 and hear me out\u2013 what if we see who can make which of the three of us blush the hardest?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re more excited by that prospect than I am.\u201d Pepper said dryly. \u201cBecause I\u2019m so pale I blush if my heart rate picks up at all, whereas you walked in on Steve and Bucky watching porn last week and didn\u2019t so much as blink. I think the odds are unfairly skewed in your favor.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIn my defense\u2013\u201d Nat held up her hand when Pepper started laughing. \u201cIt was some terrible super hero parody porn and no one would ever think that was sexy, much less blush worthy. And second of all\u2013\u201d she raised her voice when Pepper only laughed harder. \u201c\u2013 <i>second </i>of all, what if only you and I knew about the contest?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOnly you and I?\u201d Pepper repeated. \u201cSo what, we\u2019d just be competing to try and make each other blush and Tony would have no idea what\u2019s going on? Where\u2019s the fun in that?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThe <i>fun</i>\u2013\u201d Natasha emphasized. \u201cWould be when Tony can\u2019t keep his hands off us because I know for a fact he has a complete kink for seeing me do something that makes you blush.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh he does no\u2013\u201d </p><p>\u201cNew Years Eve.\u201d Natasha challenged. \u201cYou were wearing a silver dress and I used your braid to yank you down so we could kiss and you turned tomato red and Tony\u2013\u201d </p><p>\u201c\u2013locked us both in the bedroom all night and then instead of breakfast in bed we had\u2013\u201d Predictably, Pepper turned bright pink. \u201cOh my. He does have a little bit of a kink for that doesn\u2019t he?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo if I\u2019m going to be making you blush all the time, and you\u2019re going to be acting bold and scandalous to make me blush\u2026.?\u201d Natasha let the question hang there as Pepper\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYep. Could be fun, right?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell then, how do we know who wins?\u201d The discarded mail went into the trash and Pepper dusted off her hands. \u201cIf the point is to just get Tony into bed, how do we keep score?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhichever one breaks him first.\u201d Natasha patted her thighs, and Pepper came willingly, folding her tall frame onto the smaller redheads lap. \u201cWe\u2019ll judge his reactions based on how red he turns, how much he stammers and whoever does something that gets him to drag us both to bed first, wins.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTasha, I do love when your vicious moods play out and no one gets hurt.\u201d Pepper looked her arms around Natasha\u2019s neck and kissed her square on the lips. \u201cThough I suppose I love you when you\u2019re stabby too.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019m glad to hear it.\u201d Natasha grinned and kissed her back. \u201cGame starts tomorrow, okay?\u201d </p><p>\u201cGet ready to lose, Romanov.\u201d Pepper threatened playfully, and Natasha retaliated with a \u2013\u00a0\u201cYour ass is mine, Potts!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a shame.\u201d Pepper giggled and Natasha blew her a kiss.\u00a0\u201cTomorrow then. Be ready.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>*******************<br></p><p>Most people assumed Tony Stark was full of himself, focused only what he wanted and oblivious to anything or anyone else. He was never anywhere he needed to be on time, he couldn\u2019t be bothered to remember birthdays or important dates, and despite constant assurances to the negative, the press was sure that he was playing <i>both </i>Natasha and Pepper because that\u2019s the only thing that possibly made sense. No way he loved them both, not billionaire playboy Tony Stark. One day the tabloids announced that he was only dating Ms. Potts because she was his boss, the next everyone was sure that Natasha was blackmailing him somehow\u2013 on and on it went. </p><p>Of course anyone who knew Tony in the slightest was well aware that he was head over heels for both the always put together Pepper Potts and femme fatale Natasha Romanov. And he never remembered birthdays, but he never forgot anyone\u2019s favorite coffee and ordered the specific sheets that Clint liked and had the sensors in the Tower set to change anytime Bucky was in a room since he still had triggers after his Winter Soldier time. Tony noticed everything and was oblivious to nothing\u2013</p><p>\u2013But <i>boy howdy</i> was he caught off guard when Natasha walked into the living room wearing a white crop top that showed off her stomach and little flashes of\u2013 <i>eep</i>! Under bosoms!\u2013 and snake skin pants riding low enough to show her thong, swaggered up to Pepper and brought her in for a long, <i>filthy </i>kiss. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2013What\u2013 <i>hnnnngh</i>!\u201d Tony gaped at the scene\u2013 his prim proper Pepper palming over Natasha\u2019s rear, the snakeskin pants hanging on for dear life, in immediate peril of exposing much more cheek than the spy had intended. \u201cNatasha! <i>Clothes</i>!\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy do you mean, clothes?\u201d Nat asked lazily, wiping a smudge of lipstick off Pepper\u2019s face and smirking when she saw the tell tale streak of red on Pepper\u2019s cheek. \u201cI\u2019m wearing clothes.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot\u2013not many of them!\u201d Tony stammered. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard the term \u2018whale tail\u2019 since like, 2002 but good <i>Christ</i>!\u201d </p><p>\u201cCalm down, Tony.\u201d Natasha snapped the unbelievably skimpy line of her thong and winked at their boyfriend. \u201cYou\u2019ve see me in less.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2013 You\u2013 urgh\u2013\u201d Tony kept stammering as Natasha sauntered right back out, and he had no idea why she pulled out a notebook and made a mark in it, just like he had no idea why Pepper cursed and also pulled out a notebook and made a mark in it, but he didn\u2019t really care. </p><p>Natasha in snakeskin pants? </p><p>Heaven save him.</p><p>******************</p><p>Pepper Potts was practically perfect in every way, the best dressed in any room she walked into, somehow stylish in nothing more than a pair of Nat\u2019s cut off shorties and one of Tony\u2019s white button down, and a literal goddess in a floor length gown. </p><p>Natasha had seen the woman in everything from pin striped pant suits to fishnet lingerie and anything in between, but she had <i>not </i>seen Pepper in a black skirt just a hint too tight and a hint too short and a blouse unbuttoned just on this side too low.</p><p>\u201cOh fuck me.\u201d Natasha interrupted the briefing when she swore out loud, staring opened mouth at her girlfriend as Pepper sat that adorable ass upon the conference table and crossed long <i>long </i>legs one over the other, showing off the thigh high slit in that damnable black skirt and\u2013</p><p>\u201cMs. Potts!\u201d Tony sounded like he really might be choking to death when he caught sight of the color inked high up on Pepper\u2019s thigh, bright flowers and flowing vines wrapping around her leg and disappearing out of eye sight further beyond the cut to <i>whoo </i>skirt. \u201cIs that\u2013 are you\u2013\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo fair.\u201d Natasha breathed, face flushing a dull red, green eyes glowing with something altogether wicked, and Pepper simply tossed her hair over her shoulder and handed Tony something else to sign, smiling prettily into his shell shocked expression. </p><p>\u201cThank you, sweetheart.\u201d She cooed when Tony handed her back the file, and with a little more swing in her hips than strictly necessary, Pepper left the room so the briefing could resume. </p><p>Not that Steve could remember what the hell he\u2019d been briefing anyone on, and not that Bucky was thinking about anything else but the <i>situation </i>in his jeans and Clint and Sam weren\u2019t doing much better. Tony\u2019s jaw was still somewhere near the vicinity of the floor and Natasha was muttering curses under her breath as she dug out her notebook again and made another mark. </p><p>Briefly, Tony wondered which god he\u2019d pleased so much to have not one but <i>two </i>redheads who seemed intent on making him explode, and then he pulled out his phone and texted Thor:</p><p><b>From Iron Man</b>: <i>Hey God of Fertility, you are awesome</i></p><p><b>From Thor</b>: <i>I AM AWARE</i></p><p>*****************</p><p>*****************</p><p>Natasha had a scar on her abdomen, the result of a bullet that had gone through her and into someone else, and she tended to wear camisoles and shorty shorts to the beach or pool just to avoid stares and the smattering of freckles she accumulated after just a few minutes in the sun. </p><p>Pepper freckled too, in the sort of sophisticated way she did everything, so she was one for sun hats and cover ups as she lounged on deck chairs at the poolside cabana and sipped at her no- doubt low fat drink. </p><p>But when Tony went out to the pool to swim a few laps, he found not just one but <i>two </i>women in bathing suits that were nothing more than strategically placed bits of cloth held together by a smattering of strings and the occasional buckle. </p><p>Pepper in a plunging white monokini that was more like a <i>no</i>-kini and Natasha in what might have passed for a bikini in certain sketchy circles, but was really a collection of sparkles and tassels that somehow stayed put as she chased Pepper around, tackling her girlfriend into the grass and smearing sun tan lotion in a graceless, completely Tony approved way until Pepper had enough and rolled them over a few feet to dunk in the pool. </p><p>Then there were screams and giggles and\u2013 \u201cOh look at that.\u201d Tony gulped. \u201cThe suits are just about see through.\u201d \u2013 and playful kisses and greedy hands and\u2013 \u201cHo-ho-holy shit\u2013\u201d Tony had to suddenly sit down, towel held over his lap when they both <strike>bounced jiggled </strike>walked out of the pool and dried each other off, teasing and laughing at each other. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pretty red, my love.\u201d Pepper rubbed a towel through her long hair. \u201cI think I win this round.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI dunno, I made you blush hard enough you got spontaneous freckles.\u201d Natasha pointed out, brushing her fingers over Pepper\u2019s collarbone. \u201cI think <i>I</i> win this round.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell to be fair,\u201d Pepper inclined her head towards Tony. \u201cI think we might have broken our boyfriend. There\u2019s no way he\u2019s going to be able to walk for a while, and that towel isn\u2019t hiding as much as he thinks it is, so maybe we call this round a tie.\u201d </p><p>\u201cShould we have pity on him and take him to bed?\u201d Natasha reached out and tugged at an errant strap, correcting it before Pepper\u2019s entire top came off, and trying not to laugh when Tony made a high pitched noise behind them. </p><p>\u201cNo no, the bet was that <i>he </i>has to break and take us to bed.\u201d Pepper adjusted a tassel that wasn\u2019t quite doing it\u2019s job anymore. \u201cSo. This one is a tie?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI suppose so.\u201d Natasha\u2019s eyes sparked. \u201cBut <i>I </i>can take you to bed, right?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMs. Romanov, I think you should.\u201d</p><p>*******************</p><p>There was nothing heinous nor distracting nor naked \u2013 or any combination of the three\u2013 planned on Thursday morning, so Pepper and Natasha cuddled up together in their fluffiest robes and shared a cup of coffee while reading through the paper and waiting for Tony to come down for breakfast. </p><p>\u201cAre we still tied?\u201d Natasha asked absentmindedly, weaving their fingers together, and Pepper hummed a response, adding, \u201cFive to five darling. We\u2019ll have to step it up if Tony is going to break soon. I\u2019ll tell you, I was his assistant for years and never saw a single <i>ounce </i>on impulse control from that man, but all the sudden he\u2019s a picture of restraint. It\u2019s baffling.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s baffling, beautiful?\u201d Tony made his appearance for the day, swooping down to kiss both of them good morning and getting himself a cup of coffee. \u201cYou\u2019re so smart, I can\u2019t imagine there\u2019s anything that <i>really </i>baffles you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d Pepper answered cheekily and Natasha kicked her foot under the table. \u201cHow are you this morning, love?\u201d </p><p>\u201cStill a genius.\u201d Tony winked and pushed two identical sized boxes towards them. \u201cI got you something.\u201d </p><p>\u201cPresents!\u201d Pepper cried and while Natasha wasn\u2019t as outwardly excited, she still snatched her box as fast as she could and tore off the wrapping paper.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2013 you bought me a gun?\u201d She hefted the handgun in her palm, admiring the weight and feel, the way it fit her fingers perfectly, then turned it over and\u2013 \u201cWhy is there sparkly things on my gun, Tony? That\u2019s not the proper place for sparkly things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, this is lovely.\u201d Pepper admired her necklace, the way it shone against the velvet box, the uniquely green stones gleaming in the light. \u201cWhat design is this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen it before.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThis is a journey design.\u201d \u00a0Tony touched Pepper\u2019s necklace, then drew a line along the matching design on the grip of Natasha\u2019s gun. \u201cIt looks like a river, and represents the journey of life\u2013 where we\u2019ve been, where we are, and where we are going together.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Pepper turned light pink, her breath hitching. \u201cThis is so thoughtful.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNat.\u201d Tony tapped at the stones. \u201cI had these created specifically for you. They are the exact shade of your eyes, lighter here for when you laugh, darker here for when you\u2019re\u2013\u201d he cleared his throat meaningfully, and it was Natasha\u2019s turn to flush. \u201cThere is no other gemstone in the world the same color as these ones right here, because there\u2019s no one else in the world like you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd Pepper\u2013\u201d he turned back to the necklace. \u201cThese are the same color as your eyes, too, and some of them have white cut through like lightning because when your eyes flash in laughter or anger or anything I\u2013\u201d Pepper bit her lip and Tony grinned. \u201c\u2013 I love it every time. Different from Nat\u2019s in every way, but equally as stunning. It\u2019s one of a kind, just like you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cChrist.\u201d Natasha choked out, red from her collar clear to the tips of her ears and Pepper wasn\u2019t doing much better, her pale skin nearly crimson. \u201cTony, this is\u2013\u201d </p><p>\u201cTony, I don\u2019t even know what to\u2013\u201d Pepper shook his head.\u00a0\u201cWhy\u2013\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAnd because I know Pepper is way more dangerous than she looks, and Natasha loves pretty things too\u2013\u201d Tony handed them two more boxes, and Pepper laughed when she opened a handgun with her design on the grip, and Natasha sighed happily when she held up a journey stone necklace as well. \u201cLoving you two is a journey I don\u2019t want to ever end.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He smecked a kiss onto both their cheeks.\u00a0\u201cIf you two decide you want to spend some time together\u2013\u201d\u00a0</p><p> \u201cGet you ass upstairs.\u201d Natasha demanded and Pepper echoed\u2013 \u201cAnd you should be naked when we get there.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Tony saluted them teasingly and headed out the door, leaving them to smile and blush,\u00a0<i>oohing </i>and <i>ahhing </i>over each others gems.<br></p><p>\u201cAre you gonna tell them you knew about the bet?\u201d Steve asked under his breath as Tony passed him in the dining room. </p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Tony shook his head. \u201cBut let\u2019s be honest, I definitely won.\u201d </p><p style=\"\">*****************************</p><p><b><a href=\"https://not-close-to-straight.tumblr.com/ask\">SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE

I thought you were going to mess around on that obstacle course Tony had put in.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Clint&rsquo;s still pouting because of that slight bump on the head I gave him last week.&rdquo; Natasha leaned her chair back and plonked her feet on the table. &ldquo;You know, I think he&rsquo;s getting whinier the older he gets. Isn&rsquo;t it supposed to be the other way around?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;To be fair, wasn&rsquo;t a slight bump.&rdquo; Pepper corrected. &ldquo;it was a concussion&ndash;</p><p>&ldquo;&ndash; a <i>slight </i>concussion.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;&ndash;and he has every right to be sore at you for it, it was tag-football Tasha, not tackle football.&rdquo; She tossed Natasha a magazine and went back to opening bills. &ldquo;What about Steve or Bucky? You couldn&rsquo;t give those two concussions if you tried and they have no problem kicking your butt if you&rsquo;re feeling vicious.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Steve is teaching an art class and Bucky volunteered to be his model&ndash;&rdquo; Pepper&rsquo;s jaw dropped and Natasha nodded. &ldquo;I know, I have a million questions about it too. But they are busy, and Clint&rsquo;s being a whiner and Tony barricaded himself in his lab to work on something devious&ndash;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;&ndash;he&rsquo;s one bad lab accident from a super villain.&rdquo; Pepper confirmed, her lips twitching in a smile. &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s so gosh darn cute in those big goggles and that ridiculous white coat Bruce makes him wear, it&rsquo;s almost worth it.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Anyway</i>, Tony&rsquo;s busy so I can&rsquo;t drag him off for sex and you threatened me with bodily harm if I disturbed you today&ndash;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I did no such thing!&rdquo; Pepper protested and when Natasha just <i>looked </i>at her, she protested again&ndash; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m <i>busy </i>today, Nat! This is the only free time I have today and you should be glad I&rsquo;m spending it with you and not our boyfriend because let&rsquo;s face it, it&rsquo;s been so long since he&rsquo;s actually come to bed at a decent hour I&rsquo;m starting to think he broke up with us and just didn&rsquo;t say anything.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Tony would never break up with us.&rdquo; Nat said confidently. &ldquo;He thinks it&rsquo;s too funny to constantly remind Sam that there are exactly <i>two </i>beautiful women in this compound and we <i>both </i>sleep in his bed.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yes, well we are rather beautiful, aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; Pepper&rsquo;s cheeks tinted a soft pink and first Natasha smiled over it and then her eyes flew open wide and&ndash;</p><p>&ldquo;What if we have a contest!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;That would take care of my boredom and my viciousness!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>When Pepper narrowed her eyes suspiciously, Nat hurried to add, &ldquo;Not like the ultimate hide and go seek one from last month, don&rsquo;t worry. But what if we had a contest just you and Tony and I?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; Pepper scanned through her last piece of mail. &ldquo;What sort of contest would this be then? And remember, it can&rsquo;t be naked. Bucky almost had a heart attack the last time Tony lost a bet and had to cook breakfast in nothing but an apron and a thong. Those sorts of bets are off limits now.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No aprons and thongs required for this one.&rdquo; Nat assured her. &ldquo;What if&ndash; and hear me out&ndash; what if we see who can make which of the three of us blush the hardest?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re more excited by that prospect than I am.&rdquo; Pepper said dryly. &ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m so pale I blush if my heart rate picks up at all, whereas you walked in on Steve and Bucky watching porn last week and didn&rsquo;t so much as blink. I think the odds are unfairly skewed in your favor.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;In my defense&ndash;&rdquo; Nat held up her hand when Pepper started laughing. &ldquo;It was some terrible super hero parody porn and no one would ever think that was sexy, much less blush worthy. And second of all&ndash;&rdquo; she raised her voice when Pepper only laughed harder. &ldquo;&ndash; <i>second </i>of all, what if only you and I knew about the contest?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Only you and I?&rdquo; Pepper repeated. &ldquo;So what, we&rsquo;d just be competing to try and make each other blush and Tony would have no idea what&rsquo;s going on? Where&rsquo;s the fun in that?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;The <i>fun</i>&ndash;&rdquo; Natasha emphasized. &ldquo;Would be when Tony can&rsquo;t keep his hands off us because I know for a fact he has a complete kink for seeing me do something that makes you blush.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh he does no&ndash;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;New Years Eve.&rdquo; Natasha challenged. &ldquo;You were wearing a silver dress and I used your braid to yank you down so we could kiss and you turned tomato red and Tony&ndash;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;&ndash;locked us both in the bedroom all night and then instead of breakfast in bed we had&ndash;&rdquo; Predictably, Pepper turned bright pink. &ldquo;Oh my. He does have a little bit of a kink for that doesn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;So if I&rsquo;m going to be making you blush all the time, and you&rsquo;re going to be acting bold and scandalous to make me blush&hellip;.?&rdquo; Natasha let the question hang there as Pepper&rsquo;s eyes widened. &ldquo;Yep. Could be fun, right?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well then, how do we know who wins?&rdquo; The discarded mail went into the trash and Pepper dusted off her hands. &ldquo;If the point is to just get Tony into bed, how do we keep score?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Whichever one breaks him first.&rdquo; Natasha patted her thighs, and Pepper came willingly, folding her tall frame onto the smaller redheads lap. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll judge his reactions based on how red he turns, how much he stammers and whoever does something that gets him to drag us both to bed first, wins.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Tasha, I do love when your vicious moods play out and no one gets hurt.&rdquo; Pepper looked her arms around Natasha&rsquo;s neck and kissed her square on the lips. &ldquo;Though I suppose I love you when you&rsquo;re stabby too.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well I&rsquo;m glad to hear it.&rdquo; Natasha grinned and kissed her back. &ldquo;Game starts tomorrow, okay?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Get ready to lose, Romanov.&rdquo; Pepper threatened playfully, and Natasha retaliated with a &ndash;&nbsp;&ldquo;Your ass is mine, Potts!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What a shame.&rdquo; Pepper giggled and Natasha blew her a kiss.&nbsp;&ldquo;Tomorrow then. Be ready.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>*******************<br /></p><p>Most people assumed Tony Stark was full of himself, focused only what he wanted and oblivious to anything or anyone else. He was never anywhere he needed to be on time, he couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to remember birthdays or important dates, and despite constant assurances to the negative, the press was sure that he was playing <i>both </i>Natasha and Pepper because that&rsquo;s the only thing that possibly made sense. No way he loved them both, not billionaire playboy Tony Stark. One day the tabloids announced that he was only dating Ms. Potts because she was his boss, the next everyone was sure that Natasha was blackmailing him somehow&ndash; on and on it went. </p><p>Of course anyone who knew Tony in the slightest was well aware that he was head over heels for both the always put together Pepper Potts and femme fatale Natasha Romanov. And he never remembered birthdays, but he never forgot anyone&rsquo;s favorite coffee and ordered the specific sheets that Clint liked and had the sensors in the Tower set to change anytime Bucky was in a room since he still had triggers after his Winter Soldier time. Tony noticed everything and was oblivious to nothing&ndash;</p><p>&ndash;But <i>boy howdy</i> was he caught off guard when Natasha walked into the living room wearing a white crop top that showed off her stomach and little flashes of&ndash; <i>eep</i>! Under bosoms!&ndash; and snake skin pants riding low enough to show her thong, swaggered up to Pepper and brought her in for a long, <i>filthy </i>kiss. </p><p>&ldquo;What&ndash;What&ndash; <i>hnnnngh</i>!&rdquo; Tony gaped at the scene&ndash; his prim proper Pepper palming over Natasha&rsquo;s rear, the snakeskin pants hanging on for dear life, in immediate peril of exposing much more cheek than the spy had intended. &ldquo;Natasha! <i>Clothes</i>!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Why do you mean, clothes?&rdquo; Nat asked lazily, wiping a smudge of lipstick off Pepper&rsquo;s face and smirking when she saw the tell tale streak of red on Pepper&rsquo;s cheek. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m wearing clothes.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Not&ndash;not many of them!&rdquo; Tony stammered. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t heard the term &lsquo;whale tail&rsquo; since like, 2002 but good <i>Christ</i>!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Calm down, Tony.&rdquo; Natasha snapped the unbelievably skimpy line of her thong and winked at their boyfriend. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve see me in less.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&ndash; You&ndash; urgh&ndash;&rdquo; Tony kept stammering as Natasha sauntered right back out, and he had no idea why she pulled out a notebook and made a mark in it, just like he had no idea why Pepper cursed and also pulled out a notebook and made a mark in it, but he didn&rsquo;t really care. </p><p>Natasha in snakeskin pants? </p><p>Heaven save him.</p><p>******************</p><p>Pepper Potts was practically perfect in every way, the best dressed in any room she walked into, somehow stylish in nothing more than a pair of Nat&rsquo;s cut off shorties and one of Tony&rsquo;s white button down, and a literal goddess in a floor length gown. </p><p>Natasha had seen the woman in everything from pin striped pant suits to fishnet lingerie and anything in between, but she had <i>not </i>seen Pepper in a black skirt just a hint too tight and a hint too short and a blouse unbuttoned just on this side too low.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh fuck me.&rdquo; Natasha interrupted the briefing when she swore out loud, staring opened mouth at her girlfriend as Pepper sat that adorable ass upon the conference table and crossed long <i>long </i>legs one over the other, showing off the thigh high slit in that damnable black skirt and&ndash;</p><p>&ldquo;Ms. Potts!&rdquo; Tony sounded like he really might be choking to death when he caught sight of the color inked high up on Pepper&rsquo;s thigh, bright flowers and flowing vines wrapping around her leg and disappearing out of eye sight further beyond the cut to <i>whoo </i>skirt. &ldquo;Is that&ndash; are you&ndash;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No fair.&rdquo; Natasha breathed, face flushing a dull red, green eyes glowing with something altogether wicked, and Pepper simply tossed her hair over her shoulder and handed Tony something else to sign, smiling prettily into his shell shocked expression. </p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, sweetheart.&rdquo; She cooed when Tony handed her back the file, and with a little more swing in her hips than strictly necessary, Pepper left the room so the briefing could resume. </p><p>Not that Steve could remember what the hell he&rsquo;d been briefing anyone on, and not that Bucky was thinking about anything else but the <i>situation </i>in his jeans and Clint and Sam weren&rsquo;t doing much better. Tony&rsquo;s jaw was still somewhere near the vicinity of the floor and Natasha was muttering curses under her breath as she dug out her notebook again and made another mark. </p><p>Briefly, Tony wondered which god he&rsquo;d pleased so much to have not one but <i>two </i>redheads who seemed intent on making him explode, and then he pulled out his phone and texted Thor:</p><p><b>From Iron Man</b>: <i>Hey God of Fertility, you are awesome</i></p><p><b>From Thor</b>: <i>I AM AWARE</i></p><p>*****************</p><p>*****************</p><p>Natasha had a scar on her abdomen, the result of a bullet that had gone through her and into someone else, and she tended to wear camisoles and shorty shorts to the beach or pool just to avoid stares and the smattering of freckles she accumulated after just a few minutes in the sun. </p><p>Pepper freckled too, in the sort of sophisticated way she did everything, so she was one for sun hats and cover ups as she lounged on deck chairs at the poolside cabana and sipped at her no- doubt low fat drink. </p><p>But when Tony went out to the pool to swim a few laps, he found not just one but <i>two </i>women in bathing suits that were nothing more than strategically placed bits of cloth held together by a smattering of strings and the occasional buckle. </p><p>Pepper in a plunging white monokini that was more like a <i>no</i>-kini and Natasha in what might have passed for a bikini in certain sketchy circles, but was really a collection of sparkles and tassels that somehow stayed put as she chased Pepper around, tackling her girlfriend into the grass and smearing sun tan lotion in a graceless, completely Tony approved way until Pepper had enough and rolled them over a few feet to dunk in the pool. </p><p>Then there were screams and giggles and&ndash; &ldquo;Oh look at that.&rdquo; Tony gulped. &ldquo;The suits are just about see through.&rdquo; &ndash; and playful kisses and greedy hands and&ndash; &ldquo;Ho-ho-holy shit&ndash;&rdquo; Tony had to suddenly sit down, towel held over his lap when they both <strike>bounced jiggled </strike>walked out of the pool and dried each other off, teasing and laughing at each other. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re pretty red, my love.&rdquo; Pepper rubbed a towel through her long hair. &ldquo;I think I win this round.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I dunno, I made you blush hard enough you got spontaneous freckles.&rdquo; Natasha pointed out, brushing her fingers over Pepper&rsquo;s collarbone. &ldquo;I think <i>I</i> win this round.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well to be fair,&rdquo; Pepper inclined her head towards Tony. &ldquo;I think we might have broken our boyfriend. There&rsquo;s no way he&rsquo;s going to be able to walk for a while, and that towel isn&rsquo;t hiding as much as he thinks it is, so maybe we call this round a tie.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Should we have pity on him and take him to bed?&rdquo; Natasha reached out and tugged at an errant strap, correcting it before Pepper&rsquo;s entire top came off, and trying not to laugh when Tony made a high pitched noise behind them. </p><p>&ldquo;No no, the bet was that <i>he </i>has to break and take us to bed.&rdquo; Pepper adjusted a tassel that wasn&rsquo;t quite doing it&rsquo;s job anymore. &ldquo;So. This one is a tie?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I suppose so.&rdquo; Natasha&rsquo;s eyes sparked. &ldquo;But <i>I </i>can take you to bed, right?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Ms. Romanov, I think you should.&rdquo;</p><p>*******************</p><p>There was nothing heinous nor distracting nor naked &ndash; or any combination of the three&ndash; planned on Thursday morning, so Pepper and Natasha cuddled up together in their fluffiest robes and shared a cup of coffee while reading through the paper and waiting for Tony to come down for breakfast. </p><p>&ldquo;Are we still tied?&rdquo; Natasha asked absentmindedly, weaving their fingers together, and Pepper hummed a response, adding, &ldquo;Five to five darling. We&rsquo;ll have to step it up if Tony is going to break soon. I&rsquo;ll tell you, I was his assistant for years and never saw a single <i>ounce </i>on impulse control from that man, but all the sudden he&rsquo;s a picture of restraint. It&rsquo;s baffling.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s baffling, beautiful?&rdquo; Tony made his appearance for the day, swooping down to kiss both of them good morning and getting himself a cup of coffee. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re so smart, I can&rsquo;t imagine there&rsquo;s anything that <i>really </i>baffles you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No, of course not.&rdquo; Pepper answered cheekily and Natasha kicked her foot under the table. &ldquo;How are you this morning, love?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Still a genius.&rdquo; Tony winked and pushed two identical sized boxes towards them. &ldquo;I got you something.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Presents!&rdquo; Pepper cried and while Natasha wasn&rsquo;t as outwardly excited, she still snatched her box as fast as she could and tore off the wrapping paper.</p><p>&ldquo;You&ndash; you bought me a gun?&rdquo; She hefted the handgun in her palm, admiring the weight and feel, the way it fit her fingers perfectly, then turned it over and&ndash; &ldquo;Why is there sparkly things on my gun, Tony? That&rsquo;s not the proper place for sparkly things.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sweetheart, this is lovely.&rdquo; Pepper admired her necklace, the way it shone against the velvet box, the uniquely green stones gleaming in the light. &ldquo;What design is this, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve seen it before.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;This is a journey design.&rdquo; &nbsp;Tony touched Pepper&rsquo;s necklace, then drew a line along the matching design on the grip of Natasha&rsquo;s gun. &ldquo;It looks like a river, and represents the journey of life&ndash; where we&rsquo;ve been, where we are, and where we are going together.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; Pepper turned light pink, her breath hitching. &ldquo;This is so thoughtful.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Nat.&rdquo; Tony tapped at the stones. &ldquo;I had these created specifically for you. They are the exact shade of your eyes, lighter here for when you laugh, darker here for when you&rsquo;re&ndash;&rdquo; he cleared his throat meaningfully, and it was Natasha&rsquo;s turn to flush. &ldquo;There is no other gemstone in the world the same color as these ones right here, because there&rsquo;s no one else in the world like you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;And Pepper&ndash;&rdquo; he turned back to the necklace. &ldquo;These are the same color as your eyes, too, and some of them have white cut through like lightning because when your eyes flash in laughter or anger or anything I&ndash;&rdquo; Pepper bit her lip and Tony grinned. &ldquo;&ndash; I love it every time. Different from Nat&rsquo;s in every way, but equally as stunning. It&rsquo;s one of a kind, just like you.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Christ.&rdquo; Natasha choked out, red from her collar clear to the tips of her ears and Pepper wasn&rsquo;t doing much better, her pale skin nearly crimson. &ldquo;Tony, this is&ndash;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Tony, I don&rsquo;t even know what to&ndash;&rdquo; Pepper shook his head.&nbsp;&ldquo;Why&ndash;&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;And because I know Pepper is way more dangerous than she looks, and Natasha loves pretty things too&ndash;&rdquo; Tony handed them two more boxes, and Pepper laughed when she opened a handgun with her design on the grip, and Natasha sighed happily when she held up a journey stone necklace as well. &ldquo;Loving you two is a journey I don&rsquo;t want to ever end.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>He smecked a kiss onto both their cheeks.&nbsp;&ldquo;If you two decide you want to spend some time together&ndash;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p> &ldquo;Get you ass upstairs.&rdquo; Natasha demanded and Pepper echoed&ndash; &ldquo;And you should be naked when we get there.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Tony saluted them teasingly and headed out the door, leaving them to smile and blush,&nbsp;<i>oohing </i>and <i>ahhing </i>over each others gems.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Are you gonna tell them you knew about the bet?&rdquo; Steve asked under his breath as Tony passed him in the dining room. </p><p>&ldquo;Nope.&rdquo; Tony shook his head. &ldquo;But let&rsquo;s be honest, I definitely won.&rdquo; </p><p>*****************************</p><p><b><a href=\"https://not-close-to-straight.tumblr.com/ask\">SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE FIC!</a></b><br /></p><p><b><a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/B0B1AQGB\">A KO-FI WOULD MAKE ME BLUSH!</a></b></p><p>*****************************</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUbmMlXWIV2H180SDpW9oLQ\">@bethy-sue</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM0hMHLv-MrevwdP8ARj8tw\">@thesmollestgay</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOn4GzjnLU_JZCqRl6Z0Emw\">@babypinkbunny</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM7QAK8K_nfu3DiLj_QDvIA\">@lilwitchybee</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mablaP1O-iIQPcvzur2TzyA\">@kloudbby</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mb5aCs-ON5F1BGuOrdFjtAA\">@shipeveryonetogether</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mf7QK7Lagudd0OAsy4K5gyA\">@shadowrayven</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPcwm3OWywM360CM5brqPCA\">@deppfan16</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOUwkjiFhakf3IsAOe22Nnw\">@hausoffro</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfbhMj2VUyFoglMwEe52OEg\">@plutoisstillsalty</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/my9WfX0fYsC38M2vcFzVNnA\">@thereaderandwriterwithin</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mA56E784KtC-mk4WWj9EZog\">@thecat-theparrot-theonion</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5Mz802OH9NxWk0gC32t4Cw\">@zerokrox-blog</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTLu3-Lr-MrfP3ulurKwy9A\">@zuretha-metal</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgG3mzSba-LEYbVC3GyjTng\">@hurricanesass</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQjhhd0DrOrWhIHNO-VEapQ\">@tstilcr</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mU369rxPkGNUUmKxSIwDtvQ\">@ulnusilmukka</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVItnQOVx-W1mpLeU8lD9CA\">@kahowl-knight</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mw0QUxYEZhF9gyWdyecb3pg\">@oswolfpack</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMF6L8YXdS6uIe-4CP1Phag\">@larissaloki</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0aTjNzdGFn5reyH0EiHaig\">@stuckony-stank</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mW-LqsduH6Fx2ah-SCZ0mnQ\">@blackhearted</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2C3WzZ7G0L1TpcS8ta34Qg\">@iona-laia</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1PvkirZd4n_WYy0f5i5Jxg\">@itsallyd</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mguzhV29Uu21vESpeX6jd5g\">@youarenewformetoo</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mriu7Fs8Pt5k6g_W94bcr8g\">@megahuffledor</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvJlwqGeBurNdkPssSFL0eg\">@starks-avengers</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcHtSA_TluCDqYJFaa-oqeA\">@tabziecat</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIuDy-TAdQsv41jkqT5geRA\">@stitchinaride</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYoXJW7Y4XtQaxkgXl6KDMw\">@ceealaina</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcgrph0khVHhRJimt8IaMUw\">@cwar1864</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIKZC3X9k1UNWm3RTTWUiiQ\">@trinidaddee</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYuCGfXnhMRsyzFZJ2UIfBg\">@emogoddess24</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZMC9C6KcYYj4lauqo8oYVA\">@my-drowning-in-time</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLrlHfOXjncoOI5-mzzUZJQ\">@pidgist</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtUdP5q20jraIyD4U-VE8qA\">@yukina64</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGv0fmdPgGsiO1LlHPiw8Ww\">@words-aremy-weapons</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5avSROZxu4b-YN0jOV9mZw\">@psychobitchgonepsycho</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mb8sYqe_vjar7OllTzGhIxA\">@little-big-mac2</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCgEWa6jW3ppb9vXBt5zElw\">@multishippinglife</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmFJW2vkUAZ9tLq9q6rwdRA\">@susana0</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjHPr5BZlWQo9YT4C5ilAjA\">@paranormalmoonlight5</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3dwW8CjRVRBl1izMB5yGTA\">@lullilt</a></p>",

Even Aunt May had to admit that you had a mesmerizing gift, and honestly, your aunt was quite proud of it\u2014often saying you got it from your father. She was especially proud because you never used your so-called gift to do any harm, it was purely for keeping you and Peter out of trouble. He <i>was</i> Spider-Man, after all, and he often turned to you to back him up. </p><p>Which lead to this exact moment\u2014where the team was ready to barge in to the unsespecting building and risk their lives for something, where you would simply be able to strut on in, shine your pretty little smile, then walk on out with exactly what they needed. </p><p>&ldquo;Who<i> is that</i>?&rdquo; Tony practically gawked, his widened eyes were hidden behind his mask. The rest of the team turned to look at where he was, only to let themselves follow Tony&rsquo;s lead in gawking. </p><!-- more --><p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s my older sister, (Y/N),&rdquo; Peter nodded casually, crossing his arms over his chest as confidence spurred through him\u2014with you here to enhance the target with your charm, there was no way they could lose. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s always been really good at, like, charming people and stuff. So I asked her to meet us here all dolled up to do just that.&rdquo;</p><p>And you were really gonna do just that; you were wearing a basic little black dress, hair pulled up into an elegant bun and your beautifully toned legs confidentally pulled you towards the team\u2014where even Natasha was mind-boggled by your appearance. </p><p>You stopped next to Bucky, who swallowed as he looked you over, <i>who would&rsquo;ve thought that Peter had a hot older sister</i>? </p><p>&ldquo;Know how to fight?&rdquo; Steve asked, coming up with absolutely any reason to talk to you, and Clint glared at him for stealing the opportunity. </p><p>&ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; you responded, your voice coming out silky smooth and gentle.

Also, sidenote Starkid songs kept popping into my head while proof reading so if you see any spelling errors it&rsquo;s their fault for having such catchy songs.</p><p>Words: 1606</p><p><b>Chapter 6</b></p><p>As any 6 year old you were currently groggy because you just woke up. Your mood worsened by the fact that your dad would leave for a business trip today.</p><p>&ldquo;Somebody woke up on the wrong foot.&rdquo; Said man commented as you dragged your feet towards the table. You filled your bowl with cereal and chose to ignore his comment. You were rather mean spirited when you woke up. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh using the force first thing in the morning I see.&rdquo; He said as he observed. &ldquo;You really have a grip on it now, don&rsquo;t you? The first time you tried that, you were fully awake and still managed to cause a milk flood.&rdquo; He chuckled. You cracked a smile remembering the scene. Especially the part where at attempt nr. 18, he slipped in the milk and crashed onto his behind breaking out in a full of string of bad words.</p><p>&ldquo;Looks like you&rsquo;re coming back to me now.&rdquo; He joked and continued with telling you the funny things you clearly remembered that we&rsquo;re caused because you didn&rsquo;t have full control over the force.</p><p>You still don&rsquo;t completely but you just repeat whatever you want to learn until you could do it half asleep and moved on to the next thing. </p><p>Once the cereal was down you were almost completely awake and ready to face the day. </p><p>&ldquo;You ready to brush those pearly whites?&rdquo; Tony asked</p><p>&ldquo;Yes! Can I use my new toothbrush?&rdquo; you asked following him into your bathroom.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s why you have it.&rdquo; </p><p>He handed you your toothbrush and toothpaste from the sink and took his own. </p><p>You two brushed while you pulled faces at each other in the mirror.

The most stylish outfit you have in your humble 6 year old opinion. </p><p>You came out of your bedroom with your backpack on your back. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready daddy!&rdquo; you shouted walking toward the stairs to the lab/garage as every day before.. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure? I think you forgot something.&rdquo; he said walking down the stairs with you. </p><p>You thought for a moment. </p><p>&ldquo;What? I didn&rsquo;t forget anything.&rdquo; At that he placed a pair of sunglasses onto your head. </p><p>&ldquo;There now you look like me!&rdquo; he said giving your head a kiss, &ldquo;You also forgot your homework.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t have homework.?&rdquo; You said absentmindedly as you examined your new sunglasses that matched the ones your dad was always wearing.</p><p>&ldquo;Really? Because I remember clearly that you asked me to hand you some pictures of you for your class project.&rdquo; he said holding an envelope toward you. </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not until tomorrow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you could already take it with you so you don&rsquo;t forget it when I&rsquo;m not here to remember it.&rdquo; you took the envelope. And climbed inside one of the cars. This one only had two seats and one of which had a booster on it.</p><p>Your name was written on the envelope in your fathers handwriting, and when you peaked inside you saw all the pictures you had selected with him yesterday. You put them in your lap as you buckled up. </p><p>Bobbing your head along with the music during the drive to school and singing along to a few lyrics you knew, the day seemed to start out okay. Just as any other day but a lingering sadness sat deep within your stomach.</p><p>As your dad stopped the car infront of your school, it hit you. This was the last time you&rsquo;d see him for the next few days. While you were used to him having to take trips without you, they usually were only a day long. And the last trip that was longer you didn&rsquo;t even remember. This would be the first time where he wouldn&rsquo;t be back the next day since you were 3. It made your stomach sink and throat close a but, especially since you&rsquo;d be staying in your home rather than spending the night at your uncle&rsquo;s or aunts house.</p><p>&ldquo;Ready for a fun d&ndash; Hey what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Tony asked seeing the tears build up in your eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to leave.&rdquo; once admitted you started to bawl your eyes out. </p><p>Your fathers eyebrows shot up in worry. He quickly got out of the car walking around it to pull you into his arms. </p><p>&ldquo;Aw, Bug. It&rsquo;s only a few days. I&rsquo;ll be back before you know it. It&rsquo;s alright, I&rsquo;ll miss you too. You still have Happy, and Obie, and Pepper.&rdquo; He soothed gently swaying back and forth.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want them&hellip; I want my daddy.&rdquo; You choked out between sobs. A sound that made Tony&rsquo;s heart wrench.</p><p>&ldquo;I know but, how about I&rsquo;ll tell them to take you to that cool park you want to go to? You&rsquo;re going to have so much fun you won&rsquo;t even realize I&rsquo;m gone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go there with them, I want to go there with you.&rdquo; You cried out sniveling and wiping at your face.</p><p>Tony sighed as he rubbed your back soothingly. </p><p>&ldquo;Bug, I already moved the date last time. Uncle Rhodey said he&rsquo;ll drag me there if I don&rsquo;t go. I promised him, and you know that we can&rsquo;t break promises, right?&rdquo; He tried to reason, you nodded through your tears.</p><p>&ldquo;How about we go somewhere when I&rsquo;m back. Where would you like to go with me, hm?&rdquo; He asked soothingly petting your head still swaying. </p><p>You sniffled as you calmed down. &ldquo;I,\u00a0 I wanna go to the park with you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The amusement park?&rdquo; </p><p>You nodded. </p><p>&ldquo;Alright, as soon as I&rsquo;m back we two go to the park and have some fun. Does that sound good?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You Promise?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I Promise. Do you want me to bring you to your classroom?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Carry me.&rdquo; you said laying your head back on his shoulder.</p><p>Tony chuckled, grabbed your stuff and carried you into the school. He was slightly concerned considering that you usually weren&rsquo;t this clingy when it came to his trips. It was probably because of how long it was. He reassured himself.</p><p>He got looks from other parents left and right, most parents at this school didn&rsquo;t really seem to like clingy or even just emotional children, he found that odd but ignored their looks. You reached your classroom way too soon in your opinion. He put you down and crouched in front of you.</p><p>&ldquo;So, are you feeling better now?&rdquo; </p><p>You nodded. </p><p>&ldquo;Alright, here&rsquo;s your stuff. Uncle Happy will pick you up and bring you to the Daycare since he still has work to do. If you get homework take care of it there, then you don&rsquo;t have to lose so much free time? Don&rsquo;t do anything I would do. I love you Bug. I&rsquo;ll be back in about 76 hours. Have some fun while I&rsquo;m gone.&rdquo; he told you softly not wanting to leave just yet after such an emotional outburst.</p><p>&ldquo;I will. Love you too, daddy.&quot;He sighed, gave you a hug and stood up. Slowly you went into the classroom not wanting to worry him any further. But still extremely welled up with emotions you couldn&rsquo;t describe properly.</p><p>After taking off your jacket and putting it away together with your other things you sat down on your table next to your friend Jason. </p><p>Together you waited for the bell to ring and school to begin. </p><p>Lessons became boring quickly and you passed most of them daydreaming about things while completing your work. </p><p>In the breaks you played with Jason, Sam and Ryan, your usual friend group. You had forgotten all about your little breakdown this morning by then.</p><p>You were picked up by Happy as told, together with a bunch of other kids since he apparently took over &quot;bus duty&rdquo; from the daycare for the next three days. Ryan also needed to come to daycare so you sat together. </p><p>At Stark Industries you completed your homework and told Ryan the answers so the two of you could play together. </p><p>Too soon you were brought home by Happy and spend the rest of your almost uneventful day eating fast food and watching a bunch of Disney movies. You drifted off in front of the TV without even changing into your pj&rsquo;s. </p><p>You were unaware that while you had your much needed sleep your father was currently living through some events that would change the course of both of your lifes forever. </p><p>Your sleep was uneasy almost as if knowing that something wasn&rsquo;t right.</p><p><b>Tags: </b><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYlu0CG6g0HV126mDX5EUAA\">@shannonr2003</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtf05S9ZeLGz0pONCgva8gg\">@art-estrange</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYOIwa-lCaRffcCFVek9_Hg\">@nicholasbich</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgD-QccdHC_RkLzqBEvS7oQ\">@tater-thottie</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mc7DlDWkX8lf-cxRaNqs7Ow\">@tonystanktheirondad</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6r0Z83vxCNxu61ii2DIi6w\">@gaylemonshark</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvpcr2B8Ixe3yKFu3BBZ-Uw\">@emilaa2001</a> </p>",

The first time you tried that, you were fully awake and still managed to cause a milk flood.\u201d He chuckled. You cracked a smile remembering the scene. Especially the part where at attempt nr. 18, he slipped in the milk and crashed onto his behind breaking out in a full of string of bad words.</p><p>\u201cLooks like you\u2019re coming back to me now.\u201d He joked and continued with telling you the funny things you clearly remembered that we\u2019re caused because you didn\u2019t have full control over the force.</p><p>You still don\u2019t completely but you just repeat whatever you want to learn until you could do it half asleep and moved on to the next thing. </p><p>Once the cereal was down you were almost completely awake and ready to face the day. </p><p>\u201cYou ready to brush those pearly whites?\u201d Tony asked</p><p>\u201cYes!

I think you forgot something.\u201d he said walking down the stairs with you. </p><p>You thought for a moment. </p><p>\u201cWhat? I didn\u2019t forget anything.\u201d At that he placed a pair of sunglasses onto your head. </p><p>\u201cThere now you look like me!\u201d he said giving your head a kiss, \u201cYou also forgot your homework.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have homework.?\u201d You said absentmindedly as you examined your new sunglasses that matched the ones your dad was always wearing.</p><p>\u201cReally? Because I remember clearly that you asked me to hand you some pictures of you for your class project.\u201d he said holding an envelope toward you. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not until tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you could already take it with you so you don\u2019t forget it when I\u2019m not here to remember it.\u201d you took the envelope. And climbed inside one of the cars. This one only had two seats and one of which had a booster on it.</p><p>Your name was written on the envelope in your fathers handwriting, and when you peaked inside you saw all the pictures you had selected with him yesterday. You put them in your lap as you buckled up. </p><p>Bobbing your head along with the music during the drive to school and singing along to a few lyrics you knew, the day seemed to start out okay. Just as any other day but a lingering sadness sat deep within your stomach.</p><p>As your dad stopped the car infront of your school, it hit you. This was the last time you\u2019d see him for the next few days. While you were used to him having to take trips without you, they usually were only a day long. And the last trip that was longer you didn\u2019t even remember. This would be the first time where he wouldn\u2019t be back the next day since you were 3. It made your stomach sink and throat close a but, especially since you\u2019d be staying in your home rather than spending the night at your uncle\u2019s or aunts house.</p><p>\u201cReady for a fun d\u2013 Hey what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Tony asked seeing the tears build up in your eyes. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to leave.\u201d once admitted you started to bawl your eyes out. </p><p>Your fathers eyebrows shot up in worry. He quickly got out of the car walking around it to pull you into his arms. </p><p>\u201cAw, Bug. It\u2019s only a few days. I\u2019ll be back before you know it. It\u2019s alright, I\u2019ll miss you too. You still have Happy, and Obie, and Pepper.\u201d He soothed gently swaying back and forth.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want them\u2026 I want my daddy.\u201d You choked out between sobs. A sound that made Tony\u2019s heart wrench.</p><p>\u201cI know but, how about I\u2019ll tell them to take you to that cool park you want to go to? You\u2019re going to have so much fun you won\u2019t even realize I\u2019m gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go there with them, I want to go there with you.\u201d You cried out sniveling and wiping at your face.</p><p>Tony sighed as he rubbed your back soothingly. </p><p>\u201cBug, I already moved the date last time. Uncle Rhodey said he\u2019ll drag me there if I don\u2019t go. I promised him, and you know that we can\u2019t break promises, right?\u201d He tried to reason, you nodded through your tears.</p><p>\u201cHow about we go somewhere when I\u2019m back. Where would you like to go with me, hm?\u201d He asked soothingly petting your head still swaying. </p><p>You sniffled as you calmed down. \u201cI,\u00a0 I wanna go to the park with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe amusement park?\u201d </p><p>You nodded. </p><p>\u201cAlright, as soon as I\u2019m back we two go to the park and have some fun. Does that sound good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou Promise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI Promise. Do you want me to bring you to your classroom?\u201d </p><p>\u201cCarry me.\u201d you said laying your head back on his shoulder.</p><p>Tony chuckled, grabbed your stuff and carried you into the school. He was slightly concerned considering that you usually weren\u2019t this clingy when it came to his trips. It was probably because of how long it was. He reassured himself.</p><p>He got looks from other parents left and right, most parents at this school didn\u2019t really seem to like clingy or even just emotional children, he found that odd but ignored their looks. You reached your classroom way too soon in your opinion. He put you down and crouched in front of you.</p><p>\u201cSo, are you feeling better now?\u201d </p><p>You nodded. </p><p>\u201cAlright, here\u2019s your stuff. Uncle Happy will pick you up and bring you to the Daycare since he still has work to do. If you get homework take care of it there, then you don\u2019t have to lose so much free time? Don\u2019t do anything I would do. I love you Bug. I\u2019ll be back in about 76 hours. Have some fun while I\u2019m gone.\u201d he told you softly not wanting to leave just yet after such an emotional outburst.</p><p>\u201cI will. Love you too, daddy.\"He sighed, gave you a hug and stood up. Slowly you went into the classroom not wanting to worry him any further. But still extremely welled up with emotions you couldn\u2019t describe properly.</p><p>After taking off your jacket and putting it away together with your other things you sat down on your table next to your friend Jason. </p><p>Together you waited for the bell to ring and school to begin. </p><p>Lessons became boring quickly and you passed most of them daydreaming about things while completing your work. </p><p>In the breaks you played with Jason, Sam and Ryan, your usual friend group.

                "content": "<p><h1>Stark&rsquo;s Bug</h1><p>And we finally landed in the Marvel universe from here on out the events of the movies will play into the story as well as my own ideas so, enjoy! Also, sidenote Starkid songs kept popping into my head while proof reading so if you see any spelling errors it&rsquo;s their fault for having such catchy songs.</p><p>Words: 1606</p><p><b>Chapter 6</b></p><p>As any 6 year old you were currently groggy because you just woke up. Your mood worsened by the fact that your dad would leave for a business trip today.</p><p>&ldquo;Somebody woke up on the wrong foot.&rdquo; Said man commented as you dragged your feet towards the table. You filled your bowl with cereal and chose to ignore his comment. You were rather mean spirited when you woke up. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh using the force first thing in the morning I see.&rdquo; He said as he observed. &ldquo;You really have a grip on it now, don&rsquo;t you? The first time you tried that, you were fully awake and still managed to cause a milk flood.&rdquo; He chuckled. You cracked a smile remembering the scene. Especially the part where at attempt nr. 18, he slipped in the milk and crashed onto his behind breaking out in a full of string of bad words.</p><p>&ldquo;Looks like you&rsquo;re coming back to me now.&rdquo; He joked and continued with telling you the funny things you clearly remembered that we&rsquo;re caused because you didn&rsquo;t have full control over the force.</p><p>You still don&rsquo;t completely but you just repeat whatever you want to learn until you could do it half asleep and moved on to the next thing. </p><p>Once the cereal was down you were almost completely awake and ready to face the day. </p><p>&ldquo;You ready to brush those pearly whites?&rdquo; Tony asked</p><p>&ldquo;Yes! Can I use my new toothbrush?&rdquo; you asked following him into your bathroom.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s why you have it.&rdquo; </p><p>He handed you your toothbrush and toothpaste from the sink and took his own. </p><p>You two brushed while you pulled faces at each other in the mirror. Giggling over the weird face he pulled you almost chocked on foam.</p><p>He helped you wash your face which had a milk and toothpaste beard before he washed his own. </p><p>&ldquo;Alright, are we done here? Or did we forget something?&rdquo; He asked you scratching his chin, pretending to think.</p><p>&ldquo;We have to shave!&rdquo; you said like it was the most obvious thing in the world and got your &ldquo;razor\"&nbsp; from the sink.</p><p>\"Yeah next thing you know you&rsquo;ll be looking like Santa if you don&rsquo;t shave!&rdquo; </p><p>You two went to his bathroom to &ldquo;shave&rdquo; since he is a responsible father who doesn&rsquo;t keep sharp razors in his son&rsquo;s bathroom.</p><p>Recently you had insisted on doing it with him just like you brushed your teeth and washed your face together it was just the next logical step for you. So instead of watching him do it, you now joined in.</p><p>He applied some shaving cream to your face, then to his own. You were mimicking his movements to the best of your abilities as he was doing it. And because you&rsquo;re so good at copying you always ended up with a shaving cream beard that resembled your fathers. Tony dies a little at the cuteness everytime he sees it.</p><p>Your clothes today were picked out by you. It was a cute starwars t-shirt, bright green pants and your Captain Magic jacket.
