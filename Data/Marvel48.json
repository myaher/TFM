Also, bad Loki!</p><p>Thor met you on a whim one day. He was out with the warriors three when you literally ran in to him. You were embarrassed by the result and apologised to the prince profusely, running on. It was later that day he found out you were being chased by someone you managed to anger.</p><p>The second time he met you he found you alone. You were stood under a tree looking up at the sky. He approached you slowly, intrigued by your presence.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you hiding?&rdquo; He asked amused.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! Prince Thor.&rdquo; You bowed to him. You had never met the prince&rsquo;s before. &ldquo;Sort of. You remembering that is quite embarrassing.&rdquo; You felt awful that you weren&rsquo;t paying attention that day and had ran into the prince.</p><!-- more --><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t forget something like that. It&rsquo;s not everyday people run right into me.&rdquo; He chuckled. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N.&rdquo; You looked back it as to not be rude.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice to meet you, perhaps I could keep you company? At least until you think it&rsquo;s safe for you to stop hiding.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I would be honoured.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to be so formal with me. Think of me as your friend now.&rdquo; His smile was bright and uplifting.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright.&rdquo; You smiled back. The pair of you made to sit on the bench by the tree. Everything felt a little more comfortable \u00a0now. &ldquo;What brought you here?&rdquo; You asked trying to more casual.</p><p>&ldquo;My mother planted this tree many years ago. I like to come here sometimes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know All Mother planted this tree.&rdquo; You gazed at it with awe. It was very tall and cast a huge shadow around the area.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s relaxing here. I even see Loki here sometimes.&rdquo;</p><p>You&rsquo;ve seen Loki around every once in a while, but have never spoken to him. You&rsquo;ve only ever seen him in the company of the Warriors three and Thor. Otherwise he&rsquo;s alone.</p><p>&ldquo;Understandable. I can see why he likes it out here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome to come here any time. Mother wouldn&rsquo;t mind. I think she&rsquo;d be happy to know out people are making use of her garden.&rdquo; Thor made you smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Then I promise to visit often.&rdquo;</p><p>Acer a couple of hours of talking to each other and becoming good friends. Thor seemed to very much enjoy your company and he even seemed sad when you told him you should probably go.</p><p>&ldquo;Come back soon. I enjoyed talking to you.&rdquo; He stood up with you and grinned.</p><p>You nodded and waved as you left.</p><p>You came back to the garden several times over the next few weeks. Thor was there most of the time, sometimes you would just miss each other, but would make up for lost time the next time you met up. Each time would be spent talking for a few hours before parting ways.</p><p>You were becoming quite close as time went on.</p><p>One day when you went to the garden, rather than seeing Thor there waiting for you, Loki was sitting on the bench reading. He looked up when you got there.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, you must be Y/N. My brother speaks of you often.&rdquo; He closed the book in his lap.</p><p>&ldquo;He does?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s quite fond of you.&rdquo; Looks expression was hard to read and you were beginning to feel a little awkward, but at the same time he was at ease and didn&rsquo;t seem like a threat to you.</p><p>&ldquo;I suppose I&rsquo;m fond of him too.&rdquo; You smiled sheepishly.</p><p>&ldquo;Hm.&rdquo; Loki made no sign of leaving as he opened the book and looked down at its pages. &ldquo;Thor won&rsquo;t be here today, he&rsquo;s gone with the others.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I see. Sorry for taking up your time and disturbing you. I&rsquo;ll leave you to your book.&rdquo; You made to leave.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say you had to go. You like to spend time here too, do you not?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, yes. It&rsquo;s beautiful here.&rdquo; You turned back to face him.</p><p>Loki glances at the space beside him as if he was silently offering it to you.</p><p>You shuffled closer to the bench and took it, sitting quietly beside the younger prince. Loki had a certain aura to him that made the garden seem much more peaceful than before.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you and Thor&hellip; together?&rdquo; Loki asked after several moments of silence.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, no. We&rsquo;re just good friends.&rdquo; You smiled in his direction, but his eyes were locked onto the pages of the book.</p><p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</p><p>The silence that followed wasn&rsquo;t awkward, it was rather comforting and made you feel much more relaxed in his presence. It was oddly strange Ben g this close to someone who you had only ever seen from so far away.</p><p>Loki didn&rsquo;t speak to you again and after an hour of reading hisbalmost finished book, he stood up and bid you farewell as he left.</p><p>You remained seated there for a while longer before heading home.</p><p>The next few visits to the garden you rarely saw Thor. It seemed Loki was there to greet you most of the time.</p><p>The couple of times you did see Thor it was spent chatting about everything you could think of. While Loki was there, it was mostly spent in silence with minimum conversation. Both outcomes were quite welcome to you, however.</p><p>You found yourself seated with Loki once again.</p><p>&ldquo;Your brother just be very busy. I don&rsquo;t see him as often any more.&rdquo; You mused, eyes focused on the tree, feet swinging gently under the bench.</p><p>&ldquo;He is to take the throne after Father, much is expected of him.&rdquo; Loki turned the page in the new book he had with him. &ldquo;He has many things to do before then.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s not too bad, I get spend more time with you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You like spending time with me?&rdquo; Loki sounded a little caught off guard. You could tell he was looking at you.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. I consider you my friend now. I like spending time with both of you. With Thor we talk and laugh, but with you it&rsquo;s peaceful and I can take time to admire the flowers.&rdquo; You smiled softly at him.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m flattered.&rdquo; Loki looked quite pleased with your answer.</p><p>Silence followed again.</p><p>An hour or so must have passed before Loki made to leave, but your voice stopped him from going very far.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Loki?&rdquo;</p><p>The Prince turned around to give you his attention.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you think your brother likes me?&rdquo; You asked rather innocently.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course, he talks about you all the time. You&rsquo;re his friend.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know that, but I mean&hellip; do you think he likes me. You know, fancies me.&rdquo; You really wanted to know and Loki could tell by the sound of your voice.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&hellip; do you&hellip; like him?&rdquo;</p><p>Your smile was answer enough for him. You looked so happy and dream like sitting there as you spoke of his brother.</p><p>&ldquo;I think so, yeah. I hope to get to speak to him soon.&rdquo;</p><p>Loki said nothing more as he left and you seemed to be lost in thought to notice his expression as he left.</p><p>The next time you came to the garden Thor was waiting for you. He had that bright smile on his face that made your heart melt.</p><p>You ran up to him and hugged him. Something the pair of you only recently got comfortable doing.</p><p>&ldquo;I missed you! I don&rsquo;t see you as much anymore.&rdquo; You pouted.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Y/N. I&rsquo;ll have more time to spend with you now as I&rsquo;m not required to leave Asgard as much any more. I&rsquo;ll be here waiting for you more.&rdquo; He grinned.</p><p>Seeing you happy made him happy.</p><p>As you stood there under the shadow of his mother&rsquo;s tree, he couldn&rsquo;t help himself as he lifted your hand to his lips and placed a kiss there.</p><p>Your blush made him all the happier.</p><p>The pair of you were in the garden until sundown where Thor then walked you home and promised he&rsquo;d see you again tomorrow.</p><p>Neither of you knew that Loki had seen you both there together.</p><p>For the next week Thor and you met up in the garden every day and spent hours in each other&rsquo;s company.</p><p>Frigga was becoming curious about the girl who had caught her son&rsquo;s attention and was starting to urge Thor to have them meet.</p><p>He promised he would introduce you to her soon.</p><p>One afternoon, while once again waiting in that same garden, Loki came to see you. He was smiling at you as he approached you.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello Loki, I haven&rsquo;t seen you in a little while.&rdquo; You smiled at him.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been busy with Thor, I thought it best not to interupt you both. You&rsquo;ve been getting rather close haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I suppose we have.&rdquo; Just the thought of Thor brought a smile to your face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hoping we can become even closer.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Thor would like it. I know he likes you very much.&rdquo; Loki was rather spiteful in his words, but you chose not to pick up on it. Loki could be hard to read sometimes.</p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; You were so hopeful now.</p><p>&ldquo;Before I forget, I hear Mother wishes to meet you. I&rsquo;ve had our family tailor prepare an outfit for you. You should go see them and make sure it&rsquo;s perfect.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s very sweet, but I should wait for Thor first.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell him you&rsquo;re there, he can meet you outside of the garden.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s fine, thank you Loki!&rdquo; You smiled as you hurried off to see the gift Loki had made for you.</p><p>Thor came to the garden to see you as he had done very day that week, but only saw his brother there. He frowned and instantly thought something was up as you hadn&rsquo;t failed to meet so far.</p><p>He very much hoped to ask you to be his officially.</p><p>&ldquo;Loki, have you seen Y/N?&rdquo; He approached his brother.</p><p>&ldquo;I have. She went to to see the tailor, I hear you intend to introduce her to mother. I thought I&rsquo;d give her a gift to wear, she went to see if would be suitable.&rdquo; Loki replied with a slight charm in his aura.</p><p>&ldquo;I see, I thought maybe she would be here as intended.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She mentioned you were to meet, that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m still here. I told her I would send you to meet her there.&rdquo; Loki smirked.</p><p>Thor smiled and felt rather pleased that Loki was being so nice about this. He thanked his brother and headed off to meet you.</p><p>Loki smirked as his brother walked off. Thor would fond you, but you would have certainly taken the bait by now. He had many tricks up his sleeve.</p><p>Thor didn&rsquo;t get very far when he saw the tailor rush past him screaming. He didn&rsquo;t have to stop her as she kept on running.</p><p>In a moment of worry he hurried to her workplace, desperate to know everything was OK. Knowing this is where you were headed brought many concerned thoughts to his mind.</p><p>When he arrived his mother was there crouching over someone.</p><p>He heart stopped in his chest.</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; He muttered. He staggered forwards and knelt down beside his mother who was looking at him with sorrow. &ldquo;No. What has he done?&rdquo; He cradled you in his arms.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s sleeping.&rdquo; Frigga placed a comforting hand on his shoulder. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sleeping curse.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Loki did this.&rdquo; He said through gritted teeth.</p><p>Frigga was disappointed in Loki. This was an action of his envy of Thor. He claimed to hate Thor so much that he would take away anything good he had. The throne seemingly not enough.</p><p>Thor lifted you up into his arms and began to leave the room, his mother following behind.</p><p>He took you a bedroom, freshly made up and in pristine condition. He lay you gently on the bed and sat down, gazing at you.</p><p>&ldquo;How do we get her to wake up?&rdquo; He was desperate for an answer, any way to fix this.</p><p>&ldquo;I do not know the cure. Give me time to search my books. I will find you the answer.&rdquo;</p><p>Thor looked at her were a grateful gaze.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, mother.&rdquo;</p><p>Frigga rushed to the door, but before leaving completely out of sight she turned to her son once more and said, &ldquo;I approve of her.&rdquo; Then she left.</p><p>Those words made Thor so happy to hear.</p><p>He held your hand in his and remained silently by your side, his heart aching for you to wake up and smile at him. He yearned to hear your voice and tell you those words he so desperately wanted to say.</p><p>Thor would make sure Loki would pay the price of casting such a curse on you. </p><p>Hours passed.</p><p>Loki has vanished out of sight.</p><p>Frigga had read every book you could think of in hopes of finding a cure, only to come up empty. Yet, she read on with hope.</p><p>Odin had been told of what had happened. He made sure his best guards were on the look out of his son.</p><p>Thor hadn&rsquo;t moved from your side. You looked so peaceful, but he wanted you to wake up more than anything.</p><p>Frigga closed the last book and sighed. It pained her to have to tell her son that she couldn&rsquo;t find an answer. Every book came up empty.</p><p>When she reached &rsquo;re room you were resting in, she heard Thor talking. She peered from the doorway and saw him holding your hand and looking at your slumbering figure.</p><p>&ldquo;When you wake up I&rsquo;m going to tell you how I feel. I was going to tell you today, but Loki and his jealously took that away from me. He was jealous that once again I had one good thing that he didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; He took a moment to calm himself as he felt tears threatening to spill.</p><p>&ldquo;I have this dream. It came to me quote recently, but it&rsquo;s my favourite dream. I&rsquo;m sitting on the throne as long of Asgard and you&rsquo;re beside me as queen. We&rsquo;re happy and in love.&rdquo; His smile was sad, but he had to chuckle at his own dreams. &ldquo;I want to make that a reality with you.&rdquo;</p><p>He leaned in close to take in your features. Your smooth skin, your cute nose, your resting eyes, your plump lips.</p><p>You were perfection.</p><p>&ldquo;When you wake I will do whatever it takes to make you happy and I&rsquo;ll be by your side always.&rdquo;</p><p>He ran his free hand along your cheek gently and leaned down to give you a kiss.</p><p>He had to give you at least one because he wasn&rsquo;t sure you would ever wake up.</p><p>Frigga wanted to cry at the sight.</p><p>Thor was in love and he was heart broken. She had failed to find him a solution and didn&rsquo;t know what else she could to help.</p><p>Then, while silence had once again enveloped the room, your eyes flickered open slowly. You squeezed your hand which caught the attention of the god and he looked up to you in shock as waited for you to adjust to the light.</p><p>&ldquo;Thor?&rdquo;</p><p>Frigga smiled as she rushed in to her son&rsquo;s side, who had now gathered you up in his arms and pulled you to his chest.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here. I&rsquo;m here!&rdquo; He was so happy.</p><p>&ldquo;Loki&hellip; He&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know. You&rsquo;re alright. You&rsquo;re safe now.&rdquo; He pulled away just enough so he could look at you. &ldquo;I was so scared I was going to lose you.&rdquo;</p><p>You reached up and cradled his face in your hands.</p><p>&ldquo;You could never lose me.&rdquo;</p><p>He leaned in and gave you that long awaited kiss. This was bliss to him. He had everything he wanted wrapped up in his arms.</p><p>Frigga smiled and coughed lightly into her hand to get Thor&rsquo;s attention.</p><p>The pair of you broke apart and turned to her.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you not going to introduce us?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Apologies mother.&rdquo; He wasn&rsquo;t even the least bit embarrassed about kissing you in front of her. Your cheeks felt warm, however. &ldquo;This is Lady Y/N. Y/N, all mother Frigga.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an honour to meet you.&rdquo; You smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;The honour is mine, Y/N. I welcome you into our family.&rdquo; Her smile was warm and inviting. She made you feel comfortable and safe.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; Your cheeks must be bright red right now.</p><p>&ldquo;That is if you&rsquo;ll have. Thor spoke seriously. His eyes trained on you.</p><p>&quot;You&rsquo;d be a fool to think otherwise.&rdquo;</p><p>He laughed before kissing you again.</p><p>Loki would eventually be caught and punished for his attempts to rid of you under the influence of a curse, but until then Thor and yourself would live out your days happily.</p><p>It was a shame his brother wouldn&rsquo;t be at the wedding.</p>",

You know, fancies me.\u201d You really wanted to know and Loki could tell by the sound of your voice.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 do you\u2026 like him?\u201d</p><p>Your smile was answer enough for him. You looked so happy and dream like sitting there as you spoke of his brother.</p><p>\u201cI think so, yeah. I hope to get to speak to him soon.\u201d</p><p>Loki said nothing more as he left and you seemed to be lost in thought to notice his expression as he left.</p><p>The next time you came to the garden Thor was waiting for you. He had that bright smile on his face that made your heart melt.</p><p>You ran up to him and hugged him. Something the pair of you only recently got comfortable doing.</p><p>\u201cI missed you! I don\u2019t see you as much anymore.\u201d You pouted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Y/N. I\u2019ll have more time to spend with you now as I\u2019m not required to leave Asgard as much any more. I\u2019ll be here waiting for you more.\u201d He grinned.</p><p>Seeing you happy made him happy.</p><p>As you stood there under the shadow of his mother\u2019s tree, he couldn\u2019t help himself as he lifted your hand to his lips and placed a kiss there.</p><p>Your blush made him all the happier.</p><p>The pair of you were in the garden until sundown where Thor then walked you home and promised he\u2019d see you again tomorrow.</p><p>Neither of you knew that Loki had seen you both there together.</p><p>For the next week Thor and you met up in the garden every day and spent hours in each other\u2019s company.</p><p>Frigga was becoming curious about the girl who had caught her son\u2019s attention and was starting to urge Thor to have them meet.</p><p>He promised he would introduce you to her soon.</p><p>One afternoon, while once again waiting in that same garden, Loki came to see you. He was smiling at you as he approached you.</p><p>\u201cHello Loki, I haven\u2019t seen you in a little while.\u201d You smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been busy with Thor, I thought it best not to interupt you both. You\u2019ve been getting rather close haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose we have.\u201d Just the thought of Thor brought a smile to your face. \u201cI\u2019m hoping we can become even closer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Thor would like it. I know he likes you very much.\u201d Loki was rather spiteful in his words, but you chose not to pick up on it. Loki could be hard to read sometimes.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d You were so hopeful now.</p><p>\u201cBefore I forget, I hear Mother wishes to meet you. I\u2019ve had our family tailor prepare an outfit for you. You should go see them and make sure it\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s very sweet, but I should wait for Thor first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell him you\u2019re there, he can meet you outside of the garden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that\u2019s fine, thank you Loki!\u201d You smiled as you hurried off to see the gift Loki had made for you.</p><p>Thor came to the garden to see you as he had done very day that week, but only saw his brother there. He frowned and instantly thought something was up as you hadn\u2019t failed to meet so far.</p><p>He very much hoped to ask you to be his officially.</p><p>\u201cLoki, have you seen Y/N?\u201d He approached his brother.</p><p>\u201cI have. She went to to see the tailor, I hear you intend to introduce her to mother. I thought I\u2019d give her a gift to wear, she went to see if would be suitable.\u201d Loki replied with a slight charm in his aura.</p><p>\u201cI see, I thought maybe she would be here as intended.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe mentioned you were to meet, that\u2019s why I\u2019m still here. I told her I would send you to meet her there.\u201d Loki smirked.</p><p>Thor smiled and felt rather pleased that Loki was being so nice about this. He thanked his brother and headed off to meet you.</p><p>Loki smirked as his brother walked off. Thor would fond you, but you would have certainly taken the bait by now. He had many tricks up his sleeve.</p><p>Thor didn\u2019t get very far when he saw the tailor rush past him screaming. He didn\u2019t have to stop her as she kept on running.</p><p>In a moment of worry he hurried to her workplace, desperate to know everything was OK. Knowing this is where you were headed brought many concerned thoughts to his mind.</p><p>When he arrived his mother was there crouching over someone.</p><p>He heart stopped in his chest.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He muttered. He staggered forwards and knelt down beside his mother who was looking at him with sorrow. \u201cNo. What has he done?\u201d He cradled you in his arms.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s sleeping.\u201d Frigga placed a comforting hand on his shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s a sleeping curse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoki did this.\u201d He said through gritted teeth.</p><p>Frigga was disappointed in Loki. This was an action of his envy of Thor. He claimed to hate Thor so much that he would take away anything good he had. The throne seemingly not enough.</p><p>Thor lifted you up into his arms and began to leave the room, his mother following behind.</p><p>He took you a bedroom, freshly made up and in pristine condition. He lay you gently on the bed and sat down, gazing at you.</p><p>\u201cHow do we get her to wake up?\u201d He was desperate for an answer, any way to fix this.</p><p>\u201cI do not know the cure. Give me time to search my books. I will find you the answer.\u201d</p><p>Thor looked at her were a grateful gaze.</p><p>\u201cThank you, mother.\u201d</p><p>Frigga rushed to the door, but before leaving completely out of sight she turned to her son once more and said, \u201cI approve of her.\u201d Then she left.</p><p>Those words made Thor so happy to hear.</p><p>He held your hand in his and remained silently by your side, his heart aching for you to wake up and smile at him. He yearned to hear your voice and tell you those words he so desperately wanted to say.</p><p>Thor would make sure Loki would pay the price of casting such a curse on you. </p><p>Hours passed.</p><p>Loki has vanished out of sight.</p><p>Frigga had read every book you could think of in hopes of finding a cure, only to come up empty. Yet, she read on with hope.</p><p>Odin had been told of what had happened. He made sure his best guards were on the look out of his son.</p><p>Thor hadn\u2019t moved from your side. You looked so peaceful, but he wanted you to wake up more than anything.</p><p>Frigga closed the last book and sighed. It pained her to have to tell her son that she couldn\u2019t find an answer. Every book came up empty.</p><p>When she reached \u2019re room you were resting in, she heard Thor talking. She peered from the doorway and saw him holding your hand and looking at your slumbering figure.</p><p>\u201cWhen you wake up I\u2019m going to tell you how I feel. I was going to tell you today, but Loki and his jealously took that away from me. He was jealous that once again I had one good thing that he didn\u2019t.\u201d He took a moment to calm himself as he felt tears threatening to spill.</p><p>\u201cI have this dream. It came to me quote recently, but it\u2019s my favourite dream. I\u2019m sitting on the throne as long of Asgard and you\u2019re beside me as queen. We\u2019re happy and in love.\u201d His smile was sad, but he had to chuckle at his own dreams. \u201cI want to make that a reality with you.\u201d</p><p>He leaned in close to take in your features. Your smooth skin, your cute nose, your resting eyes, your plump lips.</p><p>You were perfection.</p><p>\u201cWhen you wake I will do whatever it takes to make you happy and I\u2019ll be by your side always.\u201d</p><p>He ran his free hand along your cheek gently and leaned down to give you a kiss.</p><p>He had to give you at least one because he wasn\u2019t sure you would ever wake up.</p><p>Frigga wanted to cry at the sight.</p><p>Thor was in love and he was heart broken. She had failed to find him a solution and didn\u2019t know what else she could to help.</p><p>Then, while silence had once again enveloped the room, your eyes flickered open slowly. You squeezed your hand which caught the attention of the god and he looked up to you in shock as waited for you to adjust to the light.</p><p>\u201cThor?\u201d</p><p>Frigga smiled as she rushed in to her son\u2019s side, who had now gathered you up in his arms and pulled you to his chest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here. I\u2019m here!\u201d He was so happy.</p><p>\u201cLoki\u2026 He\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. You\u2019re alright. You\u2019re safe now.\u201d He pulled away just enough so he could look at you. \u201cI was so scared I was going to lose you.\u201d</p><p>You reached up and cradled his face in your hands.</p><p>\u201cYou could never lose me.\u201d</p><p>He leaned in and gave you that long awaited kiss. This was bliss to him. He had everything he wanted wrapped up in his arms.</p><p>Frigga smiled and coughed lightly into her hand to get Thor\u2019s attention.</p><p>The pair of you broke apart and turned to her.</p><p>\u201cAre you not going to introduce us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApologies mother.\u201d He wasn\u2019t even the least bit embarrassed about kissing you in front of her. Your cheeks felt warm, however. \u201cThis is Lady Y/N. Y/N, all mother Frigga.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an honour to meet you.\u201d You smiled.</p><p>\u201cThe honour is mine, Y/N. I welcome you into our family.\u201d Her smile was warm and inviting. She made you feel comfortable and safe.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Your cheeks must be bright red right now.</p><p>\u201cThat is if you\u2019ll have. Thor spoke seriously. His eyes trained on you.</p><p>\"You\u2019d be a fool to think otherwise.\u201d</p><p>He laughed before kissing you again.</p><p>Loki would eventually be caught and punished for his attempts to rid of you under the influence of a curse, but until then Thor and yourself would live out your days happily.</p><p>It was a shame his brother wouldn\u2019t be at the wedding.</p></p>",

Also, bad Loki!</p><p>Thor met you on a whim one day. He was out with the warriors three when you literally ran in to him. You were embarrassed by the result and apologised to the prince profusely, running on. It was later that day he found out you were being chased by someone you managed to anger.</p><p>The second time he met you he found you alone. You were stood under a tree looking up at the sky. He approached you slowly, intrigued by your presence.</p><p>\u201cAre you hiding?\u201d He asked amused.</p><p>\u201cOh! Prince Thor.\u201d You bowed to him. You had never met the prince\u2019s before. \u201cSort of. You remembering that is quite embarrassing.\u201d You felt awful that you weren\u2019t paying attention that day and had ran into the prince.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cCan\u2019t forget something like that. It\u2019s not everyday people run right into me.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N.\u201d You looked back it as to not be rude.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, perhaps I could keep you company? At least until you think it\u2019s safe for you to stop hiding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would be honoured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be so formal with me. Think of me as your friend now.\u201d His smile was bright and uplifting.</p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d You smiled back. The pair of you made to sit on the bench by the tree. Everything felt a little more comfortable \u00a0now. \u201cWhat brought you here?\u201d You asked trying to more casual.</p><p>\u201cMy mother planted this tree many years ago. I like to come here sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know All Mother planted this tree.\u201d You gazed at it with awe. It was very tall and cast a huge shadow around the area.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s relaxing here. I even see Loki here sometimes.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019ve seen Loki around every once in a while, but have never spoken to him. You\u2019ve only ever seen him in the company of the Warriors three and Thor. Otherwise he\u2019s alone.</p><p>\u201cUnderstandable. I can see why he likes it out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome to come here any time. Mother wouldn\u2019t mind. I think she\u2019d be happy to know out people are making use of her garden.\u201d Thor made you smile.</p><p>\u201cThen I promise to visit often.\u201d</p><p>Acer a couple of hours of talking to each other and becoming good friends. Thor seemed to very much enjoy your company and he even seemed sad when you told him you should probably go.</p><p>\u201cCome back soon. I enjoyed talking to you.\u201d He stood up with you and grinned.</p><p>You nodded and waved as you left.</p><p>You came back to the garden several times over the next few weeks. Thor was there most of the time, sometimes you would just miss each other, but would make up for lost time the next time you met up. Each time would be spent talking for a few hours before parting ways.</p><p>You were becoming quite close as time went on.</p><p>One day when you went to the garden, rather than seeing Thor there waiting for you, Loki was sitting on the bench reading. He looked up when you got there.</p><p>\u201cAh, you must be Y/N. My brother speaks of you often.\u201d He closed the book in his lap.</p><p>\u201cHe does?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s quite fond of you.\u201d Looks expression was hard to read and you were beginning to feel a little awkward, but at the same time he was at ease and didn\u2019t seem like a threat to you.</p><p>\u201cI suppose I\u2019m fond of him too.\u201d You smiled sheepishly.</p><p>\u201cHm.\u201d Loki made no sign of leaving as he opened the book and looked down at its pages. \u201cThor won\u2019t be here today, he\u2019s gone with the others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I see. Sorry for taking up your time and disturbing you. I\u2019ll leave you to your book.\u201d You made to leave.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say you had to go. You like to spend time here too, do you not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yes. It\u2019s beautiful here.\u201d You turned back to face him.</p><p>Loki glances at the space beside him as if he was silently offering it to you.</p><p>You shuffled closer to the bench and took it, sitting quietly beside the younger prince. Loki had a certain aura to him that made the garden seem much more peaceful than before.</p><p>\u201cAre you and Thor\u2026 together?\u201d Loki asked after several moments of silence.</p><p>\u201cOh, no. We\u2019re just good friends.\u201d You smiled in his direction, but his eyes were locked onto the pages of the book.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>The silence that followed wasn\u2019t awkward, it was rather comforting and made you feel much more relaxed in his presence. It was oddly strange Ben g this close to someone who you had only ever seen from so far away.</p><p>Loki didn\u2019t speak to you again and after an hour of reading hisbalmost finished book, he stood up and bid you farewell as he left.</p><p>You remained seated there for a while longer before heading home.</p><p>The next few visits to the garden you rarely saw Thor. It seemed Loki was there to greet you most of the time.</p><p>The couple of times you did see Thor it was spent chatting about everything you could think of. While Loki was there, it was mostly spent in silence with minimum conversation. Both outcomes were quite welcome to you, however.</p><p>You found yourself seated with Loki once again.</p><p>\u201cYour brother just be very busy. I don\u2019t see him as often any more.\u201d You mused, eyes focused on the tree, feet swinging gently under the bench.</p><p>\u201cHe is to take the throne after Father, much is expected of him.\u201d Loki turned the page in the new book he had with him. \u201cHe has many things to do before then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess it\u2019s not too bad, I get spend more time with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like spending time with me?\u201d Loki sounded a little caught off guard. You could tell he was looking at you.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I consider you my friend now. I like spending time with both of you. With Thor we talk and laugh, but with you it\u2019s peaceful and I can take time to admire the flowers.\u201d You smiled softly at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m flattered.\u201d Loki looked quite pleased with your answer.</p><p>Silence followed again.</p><p>An hour or so must have passed before Loki made to leave, but your voice stopped him from going very far.</p><p>\u201cHey Loki?\u201d</p><p>The Prince turned around to give you his attention.</p><p>\u201cDo you think your brother likes me?\u201d You asked rather innocently.</p><p>\u201cOf course, he talks about you all the time. You\u2019re his friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, but I mean\u2026 do you think he likes me. You know, fancies me.\u201d You really wanted to know and Loki could tell by the sound of your voice.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 do you\u2026 like him?\u201d</p><p>Your smile was answer enough for him. You looked so happy and dream like sitting there as you spoke of his brother.</p><p>\u201cI think so, yeah. I hope to get to speak to him soon.\u201d</p><p>Loki said nothing more as he left and you seemed to be lost in thought to notice his expression as he left.</p><p>The next time you came to the garden Thor was waiting for you. He had that bright smile on his face that made your heart melt.</p><p>You ran up to him and hugged him. Something the pair of you only recently got comfortable doing.</p><p>\u201cI missed you! I don\u2019t see you as much anymore.\u201d You pouted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Y/N. I\u2019ll have more time to spend with you now as I\u2019m not required to leave Asgard as much any more. I\u2019ll be here waiting for you more.\u201d He grinned.</p><p>Seeing you happy made him happy.</p><p>As you stood there under the shadow of his mother\u2019s tree, he couldn\u2019t help himself as he lifted your hand to his lips and placed a kiss there.</p><p>Your blush made him all the happier.</p><p>The pair of you were in the garden until sundown where Thor then walked you home and promised he\u2019d see you again tomorrow.</p><p>Neither of you knew that Loki had seen you both there together.</p><p>For the next week Thor and you met up in the garden every day and spent hours in each other\u2019s company.</p><p>Frigga was becoming curious about the girl who had caught her son\u2019s attention and was starting to urge Thor to have them meet.</p><p>He promised he would introduce you to her soon.</p><p>One afternoon, while once again waiting in that same garden, Loki came to see you. He was smiling at you as he approached you.</p><p>\u201cHello Loki, I haven\u2019t seen you in a little while.\u201d You smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been busy with Thor, I thought it best not to interupt you both. You\u2019ve been getting rather close haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose we have.\u201d Just the thought of Thor brought a smile to your face. \u201cI\u2019m hoping we can become even closer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Thor would like it. I know he likes you very much.\u201d Loki was rather spiteful in his words, but you chose not to pick up on it. Loki could be hard to read sometimes.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d You were so hopeful now.</p><p>\u201cBefore I forget, I hear Mother wishes to meet you. I\u2019ve had our family tailor prepare an outfit for you. You should go see them and make sure it\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s very sweet, but I should wait for Thor first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell him you\u2019re there, he can meet you outside of the garden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that\u2019s fine, thank you Loki!\u201d You smiled as you hurried off to see the gift Loki had made for you.</p><p>Thor came to the garden to see you as he had done very day that week, but only saw his brother there. He frowned and instantly thought something was up as you hadn\u2019t failed to meet so far.</p><p>He very much hoped to ask you to be his officially.</p><p>\u201cLoki, have you seen Y/N?\u201d He approached his brother.</p><p>\u201cI have. She went to to see the tailor, I hear you intend to introduce her to mother. I thought I\u2019d give her a gift to wear, she went to see if would be suitable.\u201d Loki replied with a slight charm in his aura.</p><p>\u201cI see, I thought maybe she would be here as intended.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe mentioned you were to meet, that\u2019s why I\u2019m still here. I told her I would send you to meet her there.\u201d Loki smirked.</p><p>Thor smiled and felt rather pleased that Loki was being so nice about this. He thanked his brother and headed off to meet you.</p><p>Loki smirked as his brother walked off. Thor would fond you, but you would have certainly taken the bait by now. He had many tricks up his sleeve.</p><p>Thor didn\u2019t get very far when he saw the tailor rush past him screaming. He didn\u2019t have to stop her as she kept on running.</p><p>In a moment of worry he hurried to her workplace, desperate to know everything was OK. Knowing this is where you were headed brought many concerned thoughts to his mind.</p><p>When he arrived his mother was there crouching over someone.</p><p>He heart stopped in his chest.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He muttered. He staggered forwards and knelt down beside his mother who was looking at him with sorrow. \u201cNo. What has he done?\u201d He cradled you in his arms.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s sleeping.\u201d Frigga placed a comforting hand on his shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s a sleeping curse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoki did this.\u201d He said through gritted teeth.</p><p>Frigga was disappointed in Loki. This was an action of his envy of Thor. He claimed to hate Thor so much that he would take away anything good he had. The throne seemingly not enough.</p><p>Thor lifted you up into his arms and began to leave the room, his mother following behind.</p><p>He took you a bedroom, freshly made up and in pristine condition. He lay you gently on the bed and sat down, gazing at you.</p><p>\u201cHow do we get her to wake up?\u201d He was desperate for an answer, any way to fix this.</p><p>\u201cI do not know the cure. Give me time to search my books. I will find you the answer.\u201d</p><p>Thor looked at her were a grateful gaze.</p><p>\u201cThank you, mother.\u201d</p><p>Frigga rushed to the door, but before leaving completely out of sight she turned to her son once more and said, \u201cI approve of her.\u201d Then she left.</p><p>Those words made Thor so happy to hear.</p><p>He held your hand in his and remained silently by your side, his heart aching for you to wake up and smile at him. He yearned to hear your voice and tell you those words he so desperately wanted to say.</p><p>Thor would make sure Loki would pay the price of casting such a curse on you. </p><p>Hours passed.</p><p>Loki has vanished out of sight.</p><p>Frigga had read every book you could think of in hopes of finding a cure, only to come up empty. Yet, she read on with hope.</p><p>Odin had been told of what had happened. He made sure his best guards were on the look out of his son.</p><p>Thor hadn\u2019t moved from your side. You looked so peaceful, but he wanted you to wake up more than anything.</p><p>Frigga closed the last book and sighed. It pained her to have to tell her son that she couldn\u2019t find an answer. Every book came up empty.</p><p>When she reached \u2019re room you were resting in, she heard Thor talking. She peered from the doorway and saw him holding your hand and looking at your slumbering figure.</p><p>\u201cWhen you wake up I\u2019m going to tell you how I feel. I was going to tell you today, but Loki and his jealously took that away from me. He was jealous that once again I had one good thing that he didn\u2019t.\u201d He took a moment to calm himself as he felt tears threatening to spill.</p><p>\u201cI have this dream. It came to me quote recently, but it\u2019s my favourite dream. I\u2019m sitting on the throne as long of Asgard and you\u2019re beside me as queen. We\u2019re happy and in love.\u201d His smile was sad, but he had to chuckle at his own dreams. \u201cI want to make that a reality with you.\u201d</p><p>He leaned in close to take in your features. Your smooth skin, your cute nose, your resting eyes, your plump lips.</p><p>You were perfection.</p><p>\u201cWhen you wake I will do whatever it takes to make you happy and I\u2019ll be by your side always.\u201d</p><p>He ran his free hand along your cheek gently and leaned down to give you a kiss.</p><p>He had to give you at least one because he wasn\u2019t sure you would ever wake up.</p><p>Frigga wanted to cry at the sight.</p><p>Thor was in love and he was heart broken. She had failed to find him a solution and didn\u2019t know what else she could to help.</p><p>Then, while silence had once again enveloped the room, your eyes flickered open slowly. You squeezed your hand which caught the attention of the god and he looked up to you in shock as waited for you to adjust to the light.</p><p>\u201cThor?\u201d</p><p>Frigga smiled as she rushed in to her son\u2019s side, who had now gathered you up in his arms and pulled you to his chest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here. I\u2019m here!\u201d He was so happy.</p><p>\u201cLoki\u2026 He\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. You\u2019re alright. You\u2019re safe now.\u201d He pulled away just enough so he could look at you. \u201cI was so scared I was going to lose you.\u201d</p><p>You reached up and cradled his face in your hands.</p><p>\u201cYou could never lose me.\u201d</p><p>He leaned in and gave you that long awaited kiss. This was bliss to him. He had everything he wanted wrapped up in his arms.</p><p>Frigga smiled and coughed lightly into her hand to get Thor\u2019s attention.</p><p>The pair of you broke apart and turned to her.</p><p>\u201cAre you not going to introduce us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApologies mother.\u201d He wasn\u2019t even the least bit embarrassed about kissing you in front of her. Your cheeks felt warm, however. \u201cThis is Lady Y/N. Y/N, all mother Frigga.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an honour to meet you.\u201d You smiled.</p><p>\u201cThe honour is mine, Y/N. I welcome you into our family.\u201d Her smile was warm and inviting. She made you feel comfortable and safe.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Your cheeks must be bright red right now.</p><p>\u201cThat is if you\u2019ll have. Thor spoke seriously. His eyes trained on you.</p><p>\"You\u2019d be a fool to think otherwise.\u201d</p><p>He laughed before kissing you again.</p><p>Loki would eventually be caught and punished for his attempts to rid of you under the influence of a curse, but until then Thor and yourself would live out your days happily.</p><p>It was a shame his brother wouldn\u2019t be at the wedding.</p></p>",

Also, bad Loki!</p><p>Thor met you on a whim one day. He was out with the warriors three when you literally ran in to him. You were embarrassed by the result and apologised to the prince profusely, running on. It was later that day he found out you were being chased by someone you managed to anger.</p><p>The second time he met you he found you alone. You were stood under a tree looking up at the sky. He approached you slowly, intrigued by your presence.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you hiding?&rdquo; He asked amused.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! Prince Thor.&rdquo; You bowed to him. You had never met the prince&rsquo;s before. &ldquo;Sort of. You remembering that is quite embarrassing.&rdquo; You felt awful that you weren&rsquo;t paying attention that day and had ran into the prince.</p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t forget something like that. It&rsquo;s not everyday people run right into me.&rdquo; He chuckled. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N.&rdquo; You looked back it as to not be rude.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice to meet you, perhaps I could keep you company? At least until you think it&rsquo;s safe for you to stop hiding.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I would be honoured.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to be so formal with me. Think of me as your friend now.&rdquo; His smile was bright and uplifting.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright.&rdquo; You smiled back. The pair of you made to sit on the bench by the tree. Everything felt a little more comfortable &nbsp;now. &ldquo;What brought you here?&rdquo; You asked trying to more casual.</p><p>&ldquo;My mother planted this tree many years ago. I like to come here sometimes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know All Mother planted this tree.&rdquo; You gazed at it with awe. It was very tall and cast a huge shadow around the area.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s relaxing here. I even see Loki here sometimes.&rdquo;</p><p>You&rsquo;ve seen Loki around every once in a while, but have never spoken to him. You&rsquo;ve only ever seen him in the company of the Warriors three and Thor. Otherwise he&rsquo;s alone.</p><p>&ldquo;Understandable. I can see why he likes it out here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome to come here any time. Mother wouldn&rsquo;t mind. I think she&rsquo;d be happy to know out people are making use of her garden.&rdquo; Thor made you smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Then I promise to visit often.&rdquo;</p><p>Acer a couple of hours of talking to each other and becoming good friends. Thor seemed to very much enjoy your company and he even seemed sad when you told him you should probably go.</p><p>&ldquo;Come back soon. I enjoyed talking to you.&rdquo; He stood up with you and grinned.</p><p>You nodded and waved as you left.</p><p>You came back to the garden several times over the next few weeks. Thor was there most of the time, sometimes you would just miss each other, but would make up for lost time the next time you met up. Each time would be spent talking for a few hours before parting ways.</p><p>You were becoming quite close as time went on.</p><p>One day when you went to the garden, rather than seeing Thor there waiting for you, Loki was sitting on the bench reading. He looked up when you got there.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, you must be Y/N. My brother speaks of you often.&rdquo; He closed the book in his lap.</p><p>&ldquo;He does?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s quite fond of you.&rdquo; Looks expression was hard to read and you were beginning to feel a little awkward, but at the same time he was at ease and didn&rsquo;t seem like a threat to you.</p><p>&ldquo;I suppose I&rsquo;m fond of him too.&rdquo; You smiled sheepishly.</p><p>&ldquo;Hm.&rdquo; Loki made no sign of leaving as he opened the book and looked down at its pages. &ldquo;Thor won&rsquo;t be here today, he&rsquo;s gone with the others.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I see. Sorry for taking up your time and disturbing you. I&rsquo;ll leave you to your book.&rdquo; You made to leave.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say you had to go. You like to spend time here too, do you not?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, yes. It&rsquo;s beautiful here.&rdquo; You turned back to face him.</p><p>Loki glances at the space beside him as if he was silently offering it to you.</p><p>You shuffled closer to the bench and took it, sitting quietly beside the younger prince. Loki had a certain aura to him that made the garden seem much more peaceful than before.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you and Thor&hellip; together?&rdquo; Loki asked after several moments of silence.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, no. We&rsquo;re just good friends.&rdquo; You smiled in his direction, but his eyes were locked onto the pages of the book.</p><p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</p><p>The silence that followed wasn&rsquo;t awkward, it was rather comforting and made you feel much more relaxed in his presence. It was oddly strange Ben g this close to someone who you had only ever seen from so far away.</p><p>Loki didn&rsquo;t speak to you again and after an hour of reading hisbalmost finished book, he stood up and bid you farewell as he left.</p><p>You remained seated there for a while longer before heading home.</p><p>The next few visits to the garden you rarely saw Thor. It seemed Loki was there to greet you most of the time.</p><p>The couple of times you did see Thor it was spent chatting about everything you could think of. While Loki was there, it was mostly spent in silence with minimum conversation. Both outcomes were quite welcome to you, however.</p><p>You found yourself seated with Loki once again.</p><p>&ldquo;Your brother just be very busy. I don&rsquo;t see him as often any more.&rdquo; You mused, eyes focused on the tree, feet swinging gently under the bench.</p><p>&ldquo;He is to take the throne after Father, much is expected of him.&rdquo; Loki turned the page in the new book he had with him. &ldquo;He has many things to do before then.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s not too bad, I get spend more time with you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You like spending time with me?&rdquo; Loki sounded a little caught off guard. You could tell he was looking at you.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. I consider you my friend now. I like spending time with both of you. With Thor we talk and laugh, but with you it&rsquo;s peaceful and I can take time to admire the flowers.&rdquo; You smiled softly at him.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m flattered.&rdquo; Loki looked quite pleased with your answer.</p><p>Silence followed again.</p><p>An hour or so must have passed before Loki made to leave, but your voice stopped him from going very far.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Loki?&rdquo;</p><p>The Prince turned around to give you his attention.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you think your brother likes me?&rdquo; You asked rather innocently.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course, he talks about you all the time. You&rsquo;re his friend.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know that, but I mean&hellip; do you think he likes me. You know, fancies me.&rdquo; You really wanted to know and Loki could tell by the sound of your voice.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&hellip; do you&hellip; like him?&rdquo;</p><p>Your smile was answer enough for him. You looked so happy and dream like sitting there as you spoke of his brother.</p><p>&ldquo;I think so, yeah. I hope to get to speak to him soon.&rdquo;</p><p>Loki said nothing more as he left and you seemed to be lost in thought to notice his expression as he left.</p><p>The next time you came to the garden Thor was waiting for you. He had that bright smile on his face that made your heart melt.</p><p>You ran up to him and hugged him. Something the pair of you only recently got comfortable doing.</p><p>&ldquo;I missed you! I don&rsquo;t see you as much anymore.&rdquo; You pouted.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Y/N. I&rsquo;ll have more time to spend with you now as I&rsquo;m not required to leave Asgard as much any more. I&rsquo;ll be here waiting for you more.&rdquo; He grinned.</p><p>Seeing you happy made him happy.</p><p>As you stood there under the shadow of his mother&rsquo;s tree, he couldn&rsquo;t help himself as he lifted your hand to his lips and placed a kiss there.</p><p>Your blush made him all the happier.</p><p>The pair of you were in the garden until sundown where Thor then walked you home and promised he&rsquo;d see you again tomorrow.</p><p>Neither of you knew that Loki had seen you both there together.</p><p>For the next week Thor and you met up in the garden every day and spent hours in each other&rsquo;s company.</p><p>Frigga was becoming curious about the girl who had caught her son&rsquo;s attention and was starting to urge Thor to have them meet.</p><p>He promised he would introduce you to her soon.</p><p>One afternoon, while once again waiting in that same garden, Loki came to see you. He was smiling at you as he approached you.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello Loki, I haven&rsquo;t seen you in a little while.&rdquo; You smiled at him.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been busy with Thor, I thought it best not to interupt you both. You&rsquo;ve been getting rather close haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I suppose we have.&rdquo; Just the thought of Thor brought a smile to your face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hoping we can become even closer.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Thor would like it. I know he likes you very much.&rdquo; Loki was rather spiteful in his words, but you chose not to pick up on it. Loki could be hard to read sometimes.</p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; You were so hopeful now.</p><p>&ldquo;Before I forget, I hear Mother wishes to meet you. I&rsquo;ve had our family tailor prepare an outfit for you. You should go see them and make sure it&rsquo;s perfect.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s very sweet, but I should wait for Thor first.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell him you&rsquo;re there, he can meet you outside of the garden.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s fine, thank you Loki!&rdquo; You smiled as you hurried off to see the gift Loki had made for you.</p><p>Thor came to the garden to see you as he had done very day that week, but only saw his brother there.
