Then they dip back into point loss with Fjord Completely Failing To Be On The Wavelength when it comes to disguising as leaves, participating in dance parties, not making people exhausted with a hard ride on the moorbounders through the night, \u00a0etc etc, but these were largely made up for by Jester\u2019s appreciation for Fjord paying for their inn stay, his continued helpfulness with Sending, and most importantly Jester taking every opportunity to point out how RIPPED and TOUGH and SMART and GOOD AT ACCENTS Fjord is as he flexes for her benefit. Overall, a rollercoaster week, but we at the lab feel it balances to point loss when you factor in the massive physical toll these two took on each other, and not in the fun way. They can do better (the fun way, for instance)</p><p><b>+20 to Jester/Caduceus</b> as these two show us Battle Points Done Right, with Jester casting an insect plague in the most Caduceus of moves, and NOT ONLY THAT, but making them an Oprah BEES gif, recalling the most Iconic of Jester/Cads scenes, and the most Iconic Jester Ship Mascot, comparable only to jellyfish. Caduceus calling Jester a \u201csugar pea\u201d and making her squeal and hug him, a type of #BodyContact which earns the most possible points without lips being involved. Dancing with Jester and having a grand old time. Them earning Battle Points?????? with their protracted bat-catching session, and Caduceus using literally all of his Banes so that the itty creature never so much as nicks Jester. That\u2019s love.</p><p><b>+10 to Nott/Cat Shaped Creatures</b> Speaking of lip involvement, Frumpkin got a kiss from Nott before being let down!!! Caleb better watch out, or she\u2019ll steal his cat right out from under him!! Massive point loss however for Jannick yeeting Nott off of him for daring to ride alone, because Caleb\u2019s precious pets are nothing if not loyal. (that\u2019s a <b>+15 to Caleb/Cat Shaped Creatures </b>right there!)</p><p><b>+37 to Fjord/Caduceus</b> These two have their strongest week YET, with Fjord\u2014voluntarily! opening up about the Wildmother, and Caduceus giving some amazing advice about meditation which lets Fjord get more peaceful sleep to ASMR ocean sounds! Caduceus talking about a \u201cshining beautiful\u201d destiny (always a point earner!), and opening up about HIS Wildmother dreams and past and quests as well! Caduceus saying he has faith in Fjord\u2014though there\u2019s some point loss as Caduceus seems to have joined Nott\u2019s \u201cThere is Evil in the Fjord Club\u201d by implying it\u2019s only his good friendships keeping him on the straight and narrow, smh Caduceus. Cads adorably suggesting that they can ALSO stop in the abyssal temple before they leave town if that\u2019s what Fjord wants, like visiting a gift shop. Caduceus as usual being the first to Fjord\u2019s side for That Good Hjealing and Emotional Sjupport, which Fjord petulantly demands, and Fjord encouragingly saying \u201cC\u2019mon, baby\u201d as Caduceus looks around for the pursuing roc. In the Creepy Tunnels, <b>Caleb gets +2 to Cockblocking</b> as Fjord wanted to be the one to help Caduceus out, but Caleb gets the honor. Later Cads helps Fjord look for magical arms and armor though, that\u2019s pretty sweet.</p><p><b>+42 to Jester/Yasha</b> LOVE??? LOVE WAS SAID????? ANNNND THEY <b>HUGGED?!?!?!?!?!</b> The \u201cwe\u201d puts ever so slight a damper on things, but that is a Point Earner right there, with a lovely conversation about being Yasha\u2019s New Family and defending her from anything that would upset her. Yasha getting teary, saying Jessie once more and making a joke about the king\u2019s instrument being a rock harp, like\u2026.they are love?? Love?????? AND, <i>annnnnnnd</i> they get the Sexy Points for \u201cComes more with another person\u201d HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS JESTER I\u2019M LOVsjkajkgakajksakjkasjksajkfukewk;HA;GKJ BKfjkcbdjabkjsdbalkbB \u00a0SJAK BKJBSAKJK;jkjdasbjksbjkdakasdsfnajdknmbznb</p><p><b>-1 to Beau/Pets</b> While she gets point gains for charming a baby roc with some staff scritches and thrown food, she gets point loss for beaning the poor baby with that same staff, though luckily she doesn\u2019t join Nott in the Baby Killing Club of this campaign. <b>-1 to Caleb/Vulture Culture</b> as despite using all of his spells to Live a Bird-Brained Life, he unfortunately drops his form too quickly to save Fjord, gets bit back to wizard form by the baby roc and told to shut up with the bird screeching by Beau. But Frumpkin gains some points for looking successfully for the pursuing roc.</p><p><b>-20 to Nott/Yasha </b>You get the sense that Nott is trying to mend things with Yasha, but it always falls apart and falls apart horribly. \u201cWe\u2019re safe in this smoke\u201d leads to Yasha immediately leaving it, and after Nott has her flask taken she spends the rest of the episode talking about how shady and suspicious Yasha is which even Caleb \u201cNott is Never Wrong\u201d Widogast can\u2019t agree with. Searching the darling barbarian\u2019s pockets and accusing her until Yasha gets fed up and yells that she didn\u2019t FUCKING take it.</p><p><b>+15 to Beau/Yasha/Jester</b> as they have another stellar week. Featuring Classic Threesome Moments, including \u201cShould I give you some private time alone?\u201d with both Beau and Yasha Very Much Wanting Her To Stay, and Jester sharing the Sugar Momma loveliness she\u2019d been having with Beau with Yasha, in the form of a suggestive ring gifting joke and \u201cdressing Yasha up\u201d in the fancy clothing Beau recovered for the both of them. The three of them touching the stone Celestials and listening to their music</p><p><b>+17 to Beau/Yasha</b> *starts singing Beyonce* she liked it, so she put a ring on it! \u2018Nuff said. Beau\u2019s terribly awkward but wonderful \u201cWe\u2019ll protect you with our lives\u201d also: goooooooooooooooooooooooood. Beau being incredibly worried over using Yasha as bait, more worried over dead Celestials, but forging ahead because they both know it\u2019s the best option they have at the moment *sniffs* it\u2019s Some Angst Here. Beau saying Yasha has \u201cdope wings\u201d and might be a \u201cdope angel in irons\u201d and suggesting that Yasha may have gotten her name by sleeping with a lot of people, the sheer dumbassery of which makes Yasha facepalm herself in the hopes of getting a Lesbian Amnesia concussion.</p><p><b>+20 to Beau/Jester</b> as Dimension Door gets used once more for an incredibly sapphic and beautiful moment. Beau grabs onto Jester to try to throw her to safety, but stays when Jester asks, and Jester getting them both to safety?? Dare I say, Romance? Dancing together, loving shiny loot together, running their hands along the side of the tunnel and detectiving together. Beau saying Jester is pretty awesome, as always!</p><p><b>+4 to Fjord/Cowboy Vibes</b> as for one glorious moment, he was yeehaw riding that roc. Alas.</p><p><b>+11 to Caleb/Fjord</b>. Although a sincere effort was made, these two did not in fact earn any Battle Points as Caleb\u2019s furious handwringing, running around, and smacking faulty cocoons and tossing feathers repeatedly failed to help Fjord out of his situation with the roc\u2014only acting as a feathery transport to a cleric managed to do the poor man any good. Nonetheless, these two continued to Same Hat on planning as usual, going full speed (or not at all) with the moorbounders, Caleb directing Fjord towards Facely duties but admirably performing on some Facely duties himself when they first roll into town and get the side-eye. Fjord as always being Very Attuned to Caleb\u2019s navigational skills, wanting to know what direction they\u2019re going and wanting Caleb to do translation duty. Being excellent detective partners as they have been since the circus in identifying bodies and bones together. Point loss for Fjord apparently thinking that the best way to get Caleb\u2019s attention is to throw an eldritch blast in the vicinity of his cat instead of, say, shaking him or something. Fjord\u2026\u2026.when are you going to be nice to other people\u2019s pets? Will you ever?</p><p><b>+1 to Caleb/Essik </b>\u201cBut of course you must know of THIS EXTREMELY FAMOUS AND HANDSOME MAN ESSIK THEYLAS who will ABSOLUTELY VOUCH FOR US, IN FACT PLEASE ASK HIM TO I NEED AN EXCUSE TO TALK TO HIM.\u201d</p><p><b>+5 to Jester/Graffiti</b> as she pulls off a difficult prank in changing the sign to the \u201cRuddy Poon\u201d in full view of the whole community. One of her weaker jokes of the episode, though, so less point gain.</p><p><b>+3 to The Mighty Nein/Oban</b> as he\u2019s apparently super impressed with how quickly and trustworthily they brought Yasha to the area. Compliments Jester on her singing skills. He must be a good guy then, right? <b>Right?</b></p><p><b>-4 to Nott/Jester</b> for Nott claiming erroneously that rocs eat leaves to Jester, absolutely wanting Jester to \u201cwaste\u201d a spell looking for her missing flask (that Jester stole). Point gains for Jester casting lesser restoration on Nott and worrying about her alcoholism and recklessness to a heartbreaking degree\u2026.but unfortunately, balancing out to point loss considering the physical and emotional toll her thievery resulted in as Nott panicks and takes out her feelings on the rest of the party. We at the lab live in fear on what will happen once Nott discovers who IS responsible</p><p><b>+14 to Caleb/Jester </b>she\u2026..makes him laugh???? A rare accomplishment for which There Must Surely Be a Medal??? This alone earns All The Points for an Iconic Moment, but <b>Caduceus gets +7 to Cockblocking</b> for being the one Eagle Caleb carts around when the offer was originally extended to Jester. Caleb also catching onto Jessie (thank you Nott for this nickname I despise) and looking soft at everything she does, and dancing, and being the first to adorably compare Jester to a snap pea. Caleb agreeing with Jester that building bridges sounds nice. Point loss for Jester making far too much fun of Caleb for not knowing her demon stories and not seeing the obelisk, prompting him to weakly defend himself that he\u2019s \u201cdoing his best.\u201d More point loss for Caleb also pushing to ride the moorbounders to exhaustion, and just ignoring Jester\u2019s \u201cfeelings\u201d to talk to Caduceus, showing a lack of trust that is UNACCEPTABLE.</p><p><b>-500 to Nott/Alcohol</b> Which needs no explanation.</p><p><b>+16 to Caleb/Caduceus</b> as these boys get Good Quality Time, with Caleb flying Caduceus around everywhere, Caduceus continuing to think Caleb Magic is the Solution to Everything by suggesting alarms at the cave entrance and seeking out Caleb\u2019s cat-based assistance three billion times. Caleb asking for Caduceus\u2019 opinion and feelings specifically for guidance on what they should do, also thinking Caduceus Magic is the Solution to Everything by asking for a detect magic which Caduceus could not provide. Once more very emphatically forbidding Caduceus from wasting his spell slots on Daylight, because like a #KnightInShiningArmor Caleb wants to chivalrously cast that spell himself with the driftglobe. Caduceus chivalrously picking up the tab and buying incense both for himself and Caleb. Caleb holding onto Caduceus\u2019 wrist for a full minute and proving Caduceus is a favorite for his Special Buffing Spells, \u00a0because the wizard is too much of a scaredy-cat to just hold his hand, I suppose.</p><p><b>+20 to Everyone/Detective Work</b> for finding gems, bones, maps, emblems, and identifying the precise coagulation of blood to determine when it was spilled! Nothing Conclusive was learned, but boy did it increase the Creepiness Factor of the episode!</p><p><b>-100 to The Mighty Nein/This One Particular Roc</b> who will hold \u00a0a grudge against them for the rest of time, woe unto them should they ever venture into the Barbed Fields again.</p><p><b>+19 to Jester/Cosplay of the Week</b> for a much-complimented leaf disguise, and for dressing up in the bloody garb of some mauled nobles. Point loss because it was unclear to most of the judges that \u201cleaf\u201d is what she was going for, and not \u201chealthy edible vegetable\u201d</p>",

Beau saying Yasha has \u201cdope wings\u201d and might be a \u201cdope angel in irons\u201d and suggesting that Yasha may have gotten her name by sleeping with a lot of people, the sheer dumbassery of which makes Yasha facepalm herself in the hopes of getting a Lesbian Amnesia concussion.</p><p><b>+20 to Beau/Jester</b> as Dimension Door gets used once more for an incredibly sapphic and beautiful moment.

Nonetheless, these two continued to Same Hat on planning as usual, going full speed (or not at all) with the moorbounders, Caleb directing Fjord towards Facely duties but admirably performing on some Facely duties himself when they first roll into town and get the side-eye. Fjord as always being Very Attuned to Caleb\u2019s navigational skills, wanting to know what direction they\u2019re going and wanting Caleb to do translation duty. Being excellent detective partners as they have been since the circus in identifying bodies and bones together. Point loss for Fjord apparently thinking that the best way to get Caleb\u2019s attention is to throw an eldritch blast in the vicinity of his cat instead of, say, shaking him or something.

Caleb also catching onto Jessie (thank you Nott for this nickname I despise) and looking soft at everything she does, and dancing, and being the first to adorably compare Jester to a snap pea. Caleb agreeing with Jester that building bridges sounds nice. Point loss for Jester making far too much fun of Caleb for not knowing her demon stories and not seeing the obelisk, prompting him to weakly defend himself that he\u2019s \u201cdoing his best.\u201d More point loss for Caleb also pushing to ride the moorbounders to exhaustion, and just ignoring Jester\u2019s \u201cfeelings\u201d to talk to Caduceus, showing a lack of trust that is UNACCEPTABLE.</p><p><b>-500 to Nott/Alcohol</b> Which needs no explanation.</p><p><b>+16 to Caleb/Caduceus</b> as these boys get Good Quality Time, with Caleb flying Caduceus around everywhere, Caduceus continuing to think Caleb Magic is the Solution to Everything by suggesting alarms at the cave entrance and seeking out Caleb\u2019s cat-based assistance three billion times. Caleb asking for Caduceus\u2019 opinion and feelings specifically for guidance on what they should do, also thinking Caduceus Magic is the Solution to Everything by asking for a detect magic which Caduceus could not provide. Once more very emphatically forbidding Caduceus from wasting his spell slots on Daylight, because like a #KnightInShiningArmor Caleb wants to chivalrously cast that spell himself with the driftglobe. Caduceus chivalrously picking up the tab and buying incense both for himself and Caleb. Caleb holding onto Caduceus\u2019 wrist for a full minute and proving Caduceus is a favorite for his Special Buffing Spells, \u00a0because the wizard is too much of a scaredy-cat to just hold his hand, I suppose.</p><p><b>+20 to Everyone/Detective Work</b> for finding gems, bones, maps, emblems, and identifying the precise coagulation of blood to determine when it was spilled!

The hemorrhaging to the ship was mostly patched up by both of them being very regretful over the whole situation, Jester saying \u201csorry\u201d a billion and one times, and so on. Then they dip back into point loss with Fjord Completely Failing To Be On The Wavelength when it comes to disguising as leaves, participating in dance parties, not making people exhausted with a hard ride on the moorbounders through the night, \u00a0etc etc, but these were largely made up for by Jester\u2019s appreciation for Fjord paying for their inn stay, his continued helpfulness with Sending, and most importantly Jester taking every opportunity to point out how RIPPED and TOUGH and SMART and GOOD AT ACCENTS Fjord is as he flexes for her benefit. Overall, a rollercoaster week, but we at the lab feel it balances to point loss when you factor in the massive physical toll these two took on each other, and not in the fun way.

Caduceus calling Jester a \u201csugar pea\u201d and making her squeal and hug him, a type of #BodyContact which earns the most possible points without lips being involved. Dancing with Jester and having a grand old time.

Then they dip back into point loss with Fjord Completely Failing To Be On The Wavelength when it comes to disguising as leaves, participating in dance parties, not making people exhausted with a hard ride on the moorbounders through the night, &nbsp;etc etc, but these were largely made up for by Jester&rsquo;s appreciation for Fjord paying for their inn stay, his continued helpfulness with Sending, and most importantly Jester taking every opportunity to point out how RIPPED and TOUGH and SMART and GOOD AT ACCENTS Fjord is as he flexes for her benefit. Overall, a rollercoaster week, but we at the lab feel it balances to point loss when you factor in the massive physical toll these two took on each other, and not in the fun way. They can do better (the fun way, for instance)</p><p><b>+20 to Jester/Caduceus</b> as these two show us Battle Points Done Right, with Jester casting an insect plague in the most Caduceus of moves, and NOT ONLY THAT, but making them an Oprah BEES gif, recalling the most Iconic of Jester/Cads scenes, and the most Iconic Jester Ship Mascot, comparable only to jellyfish. Caduceus calling Jester a &ldquo;sugar pea&rdquo; and making her squeal and hug him, a type of #BodyContact which earns the most possible points without lips being involved. Dancing with Jester and having a grand old time. Them earning Battle Points?????? with their protracted bat-catching session, and Caduceus using literally all of his Banes so that the itty creature never so much as nicks Jester. That&rsquo;s love.</p><p><b>+10 to Nott/Cat Shaped Creatures</b> Speaking of lip involvement, Frumpkin got a kiss from Nott before being let down!!! Caleb better watch out, or she&rsquo;ll steal his cat right out from under him!! Massive point loss however for Jannick yeeting Nott off of him for daring to ride alone, because Caleb&rsquo;s precious pets are nothing if not loyal. (that&rsquo;s a <b>+15 to Caleb/Cat Shaped Creatures </b>right there!)</p><p><b>+37 to Fjord/Caduceus</b> These two have their strongest week YET, with Fjord&mdash;voluntarily! opening up about the Wildmother, and Caduceus giving some amazing advice about meditation which lets Fjord get more peaceful sleep to ASMR ocean sounds! Caduceus talking about a &ldquo;shining beautiful&rdquo; destiny (always a point earner!), and opening up about HIS Wildmother dreams and past and quests as well! Caduceus saying he has faith in Fjord&mdash;though there&rsquo;s some point loss as Caduceus seems to have joined Nott&rsquo;s &ldquo;There is Evil in the Fjord Club&rdquo; by implying it&rsquo;s only his good friendships keeping him on the straight and narrow, smh Caduceus. Cads adorably suggesting that they can ALSO stop in the abyssal temple before they leave town if that&rsquo;s what Fjord wants, like visiting a gift shop. Caduceus as usual being the first to Fjord&rsquo;s side for That Good Hjealing and Emotional Sjupport, which Fjord petulantly demands, and Fjord encouragingly saying &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, baby&rdquo; as Caduceus looks around for the pursuing roc. In the Creepy Tunnels, <b>Caleb gets +2 to Cockblocking</b> as Fjord wanted to be the one to help Caduceus out, but Caleb gets the honor. Later Cads helps Fjord look for magical arms and armor though, that&rsquo;s pretty sweet.</p><p><b>+42 to Jester/Yasha</b> LOVE??? LOVE WAS SAID????? ANNNND THEY <b>HUGGED?!?!?!?!?!</b> The &ldquo;we&rdquo; puts ever so slight a damper on things, but that is a Point Earner right there, with a lovely conversation about being Yasha&rsquo;s New Family and defending her from anything that would upset her. Yasha getting teary, saying Jessie once more and making a joke about the king&rsquo;s instrument being a rock harp, like&hellip;.they are love?? Love?????? AND, <i>annnnnnnd</i> they get the Sexy Points for &ldquo;Comes more with another person&rdquo; HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS JESTER I&rsquo;M LOVsjkajkgakajksakjkasjksajkfukewk;HA;GKJ BKfjkcbdjabkjsdbalkbB &nbsp;SJAK BKJBSAKJK;jkjdasbjksbjkdakasdsfnajdknmbznb</p><p><b>-1 to Beau/Pets</b> While she gets point gains for charming a baby roc with some staff scritches and thrown food, she gets point loss for beaning the poor baby with that same staff, though luckily she doesn&rsquo;t join Nott in the Baby Killing Club of this campaign. <b>-1 to Caleb/Vulture Culture</b> as despite using all of his spells to Live a Bird-Brained Life, he unfortunately drops his form too quickly to save Fjord, gets bit back to wizard form by the baby roc and told to shut up with the bird screeching by Beau. But Frumpkin gains some points for looking successfully for the pursuing roc.</p><p><b>-20 to Nott/Yasha </b>You get the sense that Nott is trying to mend things with Yasha, but it always falls apart and falls apart horribly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re safe in this smoke&rdquo; leads to Yasha immediately leaving it, and after Nott has her flask taken she spends the rest of the episode talking about how shady and suspicious Yasha is which even Caleb &ldquo;Nott is Never Wrong&rdquo; Widogast can&rsquo;t agree with. Searching the darling barbarian&rsquo;s pockets and accusing her until Yasha gets fed up and yells that she didn&rsquo;t FUCKING take it.</p><p><b>+15 to Beau/Yasha/Jester</b> as they have another stellar week. Featuring Classic Threesome Moments, including &ldquo;Should I give you some private time alone?&rdquo; with both Beau and Yasha Very Much Wanting Her To Stay, and Jester sharing the Sugar Momma loveliness she&rsquo;d been having with Beau with Yasha, in the form of a suggestive ring gifting joke and &ldquo;dressing Yasha up&rdquo; in the fancy clothing Beau recovered for the both of them. The three of them touching the stone Celestials and listening to their music</p><p><b>+17 to Beau/Yasha</b> *starts singing Beyonce* she liked it, so she put a ring on it! &lsquo;Nuff said. Beau&rsquo;s terribly awkward but wonderful &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll protect you with our lives&rdquo; also: goooooooooooooooooooooooood. Beau being incredibly worried over using Yasha as bait, more worried over dead Celestials, but forging ahead because they both know it&rsquo;s the best option they have at the moment *sniffs* it&rsquo;s Some Angst Here. Beau saying Yasha has &ldquo;dope wings&rdquo; and might be a &ldquo;dope angel in irons&rdquo; and suggesting that Yasha may have gotten her name by sleeping with a lot of people, the sheer dumbassery of which makes Yasha facepalm herself in the hopes of getting a Lesbian Amnesia concussion.</p><p><b>+20 to Beau/Jester</b> as Dimension Door gets used once more for an incredibly sapphic and beautiful moment. Beau grabs onto Jester to try to throw her to safety, but stays when Jester asks, and Jester getting them both to safety?? Dare I say, Romance? Dancing together, loving shiny loot together, running their hands along the side of the tunnel and detectiving together. Beau saying Jester is pretty awesome, as always!</p><p><b>+4 to Fjord/Cowboy Vibes</b> as for one glorious moment, he was yeehaw riding that roc. Alas.</p><p><b>+11 to Caleb/Fjord</b>. Although a sincere effort was made, these two did not in fact earn any Battle Points as Caleb&rsquo;s furious handwringing, running around, and smacking faulty cocoons and tossing feathers repeatedly failed to help Fjord out of his situation with the roc&mdash;only acting as a feathery transport to a cleric managed to do the poor man any good. Nonetheless, these two continued to Same Hat on planning as usual, going full speed (or not at all) with the moorbounders, Caleb directing Fjord towards Facely duties but admirably performing on some Facely duties himself when they first roll into town and get the side-eye. Fjord as always being Very Attuned to Caleb&rsquo;s navigational skills, wanting to know what direction they&rsquo;re going and wanting Caleb to do translation duty. Being excellent detective partners as they have been since the circus in identifying bodies and bones together. Point loss for Fjord apparently thinking that the best way to get Caleb&rsquo;s attention is to throw an eldritch blast in the vicinity of his cat instead of, say, shaking him or something. Fjord&hellip;&hellip;.when are you going to be nice to other people&rsquo;s pets? Will you ever?</p><p><b>+1 to Caleb/Essik </b>&ldquo;But of course you must know of THIS EXTREMELY FAMOUS AND HANDSOME MAN ESSIK THEYLAS who will ABSOLUTELY VOUCH FOR US, IN FACT PLEASE ASK HIM TO I NEED AN EXCUSE TO TALK TO HIM.&rdquo;</p><p><b>+5 to Jester/Graffiti</b> as she pulls off a difficult prank in changing the sign to the &ldquo;Ruddy Poon&rdquo; in full view of the whole community. One of her weaker jokes of the episode, though, so less point gain.</p><p><b>+3 to The Mighty Nein/Oban</b> as he&rsquo;s apparently super impressed with how quickly and trustworthily they brought Yasha to the area. Compliments Jester on her singing skills. He must be a good guy then, right? <b>Right?</b></p><p><b>-4 to Nott/Jester</b> for Nott claiming erroneously that rocs eat leaves to Jester, absolutely wanting Jester to &ldquo;waste&rdquo; a spell looking for her missing flask (that Jester stole). Point gains for Jester casting lesser restoration on Nott and worrying about her alcoholism and recklessness to a heartbreaking degree&hellip;.but unfortunately, balancing out to point loss considering the physical and emotional toll her thievery resulted in as Nott panicks and takes out her feelings on the rest of the party. We at the lab live in fear on what will happen once Nott discovers who IS responsible</p><p><b>+14 to Caleb/Jester </b>she&hellip;..makes him laugh???? A rare accomplishment for which There Must Surely Be a Medal??? This alone earns All The Points for an Iconic Moment, but <b>Caduceus gets +7 to Cockblocking</b> for being the one Eagle Caleb carts around when the offer was originally extended to Jester. Caleb also catching onto Jessie (thank you Nott for this nickname I despise) and looking soft at everything she does, and dancing, and being the first to adorably compare Jester to a snap pea. Caleb agreeing with Jester that building bridges sounds nice. Point loss for Jester making far too much fun of Caleb for not knowing her demon stories and not seeing the obelisk, prompting him to weakly defend himself that he&rsquo;s &ldquo;doing his best.&rdquo; More point loss for Caleb also pushing to ride the moorbounders to exhaustion, and just ignoring Jester&rsquo;s &ldquo;feelings&rdquo; to talk to Caduceus, showing a lack of trust that is UNACCEPTABLE.</p><p><b>-500 to Nott/Alcohol</b> Which needs no explanation.</p><p><b>+16 to Caleb/Caduceus</b> as these boys get Good Quality Time, with Caleb flying Caduceus around everywhere, Caduceus continuing to think Caleb Magic is the Solution to Everything by suggesting alarms at the cave entrance and seeking out Caleb&rsquo;s cat-based assistance three billion times. Caleb asking for Caduceus&rsquo; opinion and feelings specifically for guidance on what they should do, also thinking Caduceus Magic is the Solution to Everything by asking for a detect magic which Caduceus could not provide. Once more very emphatically forbidding Caduceus from wasting his spell slots on Daylight, because like a #KnightInShiningArmor Caleb wants to chivalrously cast that spell himself with the driftglobe. Caduceus chivalrously picking up the tab and buying incense both for himself and Caleb. Caleb holding onto Caduceus&rsquo; wrist for a full minute and proving Caduceus is a favorite for his Special Buffing Spells, &nbsp;because the wizard is too much of a scaredy-cat to just hold his hand, I suppose.</p><p><b>+20 to Everyone/Detective Work</b> for finding gems, bones, maps, emblems, and identifying the precise coagulation of blood to determine when it was spilled! Nothing Conclusive was learned, but boy did it increase the Creepiness Factor of the episode!</p><p><b>-100 to The Mighty Nein/This One Particular Roc</b> who will hold &nbsp;a grudge against them for the rest of time, woe unto them should they ever venture into the Barbed Fields again.</p><p><b>+19 to Jester/Cosplay of the Week</b> for a much-complimented leaf disguise, and for dressing up in the bloody garb of some mauled nobles. Point loss because it was unclear to most of the judges that &ldquo;leaf&rdquo; is what she was going for, and not &ldquo;healthy edible vegetable&rdquo;</p></p>",
