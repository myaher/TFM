The sound of pneumatic hammers breaking every concrete wall, smooth sound of a laser cutting through every surface, loud raving up of an engine, all coupled with heavy and energizing notes of rock music blasting in the background. It was his everyday bread, something he lived in and was an inherent part of his everyday routine, just like a cup of coffee every morning. While most people would find it unpleasant, it was one of the sweetest music for Tony. Not being bothered by loud, ongoing sounds was a useful skill and definitely helped Tony to sleep through the nights when Steve, with circled eyes and head lolling forward, stumbled into their shared bed after particularly exhausting days and snored for twelve hours, resembling a chainsaw. Tony could sleep happily through it, cuddled to his soldier and wake up refreshed.</p><p>Just not when it was two super soldiers snoring.</p><p>Just no.</p><!-- more --><p>Tony shut his eyes tight when it began all over again. Sometimes it was one Steve snoring, and the other started, just when the first ended. Sometimes it was them both, taking turns, as if in some very bad band. The worst was when they got gradually louder, up to a point when it all died down, just to start minutes later.</p><p>Tony didn&rsquo;t get a lot of sleep, waking up every hour or so, trying to shut his Steve&rsquo;s mouth from time to time, but it just fell open almost right away.</p><p>Some part of him felt proud that he and T2 managed to tire their boyfriends out the day before during the joined tickle session, but the other part of him told him to get a gag and use it on both blonds because he needed his damn sleep.</p><p>And T2 seemed to sleep through all of this. Lucky bastard. Or at least it was what Tony thought.</p><p>Tony groaned, hearing another snore rumble in Steve&rsquo;s chest before it left his mouth. He just wanted to sleep and use his boyfriend&rsquo;s peck as a pillow was that too much to ask? In a quick move, he lifted himself up and looked angrily at his boyfriend, his irritation level rising when he noticed that it was getting bright outside and he painfully felt the consequences of being awake for almost the whole night. And snore. A loud one. Tony put his hand under Steve&rsquo;s chin and shut his mouth. As usual, it worked for about ten seconds before his mouth opened and the snoring started anew. What was worse, S2 started to snore too, almost as if it was a competition between both blonds who could snore louder. Usually, Tony found the competitiveness between two Captain Americas amusing, but right now, there was nothing endearing about this situation.</p><p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t work, huh?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony winced in surprise, before he looked to the middle of the bed, eyebrows creasing. T2, acting as a small spoon to S2, was wide awake, his eyes red and tired and he kept smiling weakly at his counterpart. Tony felt tired himself, but he liked to think that he looked less chewed out than T2 did.</p><p>&ldquo;They woke you up too?&rdquo; Tony asked in a whisper, wriggling back into the covers. Feeling him back, Steve immediately wrapped arms again around his torso and buried his face into Tony&rsquo;s shoulder. If he started drooling on him, Tony would have no problems with pushing Steve out of the bed. And it still was the nice option. </p><p>&ldquo;Ugh, I don&rsquo;t think I slept at all,&rdquo; T2 admitted in a pained voice, closing his eyes tight, &ldquo;you make a lot of ruckus too you know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, what?&rdquo; Tony asked back. He remembered seeing T2 perfectly still the whole night, not flinching even once or giving any other signs of being awake.</p><p>&ldquo;Each time you moved to quiet one of them, you made me awake all over again. Also, you snore too,&rdquo; T2 said, opening his eyes and jutting his lower lip forward.</p><p>&ldquo;You snore too!&rdquo; Tony argued back, clearly in self-defense. </p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be as bad as this one,&rdquo; T2 said through a yawn, pointing with his head to his Steve. &ldquo;Or that one,&rdquo; he continued, meaning the other Steve.</p><p>Tony mellowed down. He and T2 were on the same page here. And somewhere deep, deep down he did feel a bit bad for keeping the other him awake.</p><p>&ldquo;You know, I would still take his snoring in favor of the other sound that comes from him during the night,&rdquo; Tony said, trying to lighten up the mood.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; T2 asked, his face showing some interest.</p><p>&ldquo;I mean that when the evening earlier he binges on ice cream or pizza with double cheese,&rdquo; Tony explained, trying to keep his smile to minimum and voice neutral, while he watched the spreading glee on T2&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;No amount of scented candles can help. I think I would be even scared to light up a match near him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Noooo,&rdquo; T2 whined, voice cracking with laughter.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Tony nodded, finally smiling, &ldquo;I swear, one night our covers didn&rsquo;t even touch the bed, they just kept floating in the air.&rdquo;</p><p>T2 buried his face in the pillow, shoulders shaking with laughter. Tony gave him a minute, just enjoying seeing the other him giggling away. It was a cute sight. </p><p>&ldquo;I am glad mine has a nuts allergy, it just makes his tongue bigger,&rdquo; T2 said after his giggling fit was over. Then his smiling face changed into a more mischievous one. &ldquo;Actually, sometimes we use it to our advantage.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Now you are just bragging,&rdquo; Tony narrowed his eyes, and T2 laughed happily. He stopped laughing, when more rumbling snores filled the room, this time coming from both soldiers.</p><p>&ldquo;I guess we are getting up?&rdquo; T2 asked while Tony was busy rolling his eyes at the soldier glued to his back.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. Let them go deaf alone,&rdquo; Tony said, gently moving Steve&rsquo;s hands and wriggling himself out from the covers and making a wobbly way out of the bed, trying not to step on anyone. </p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that,&rdquo; T2 cooed, untangling himself from his Steve&rsquo;s hold. He yelped softly when a hand grabbed his ankle and T1 pulled on it, dragging him all the way down the mattress until he reached the end of the bed and a good portion of his legs was out.</p><p>&ldquo;I kinda mean that,&rdquo; Tony said, lack of sleep making him cranky. He lifted the covers up and saw T2&rsquo;s smiling and amused face. T2 liked to be manhandled a bit too much, but Tony could understand that just as much enjoying manhandling the other him.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go, before I lose my hearing,&rdquo; Tony urged when snoring became louder, and he pulled T2 up and to himself.</p><p>&ldquo;Breakfast?&rdquo; T2 asked hopefully, grabbing some basic clothes for him and T1 on their way out.</p><p>&ldquo;Coffee. Lots,&rdquo; Tony groaned, tilting his head back. &ldquo;And I have no strength to cook. We will do what we always do on days like this.&rdquo;</p><p>T2 giggled, handing T1 a tank top and sweat pants. &ldquo;Order food and push it as our cooking?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shhh!&rdquo; T1 quieted the other him, shooting a quick glance at their, hopefully, sleeping boyfriends. There was a limited number of times they could impress Steves with unburnt omelets and poached eggs on toast. Seemed that their secret would remain safe, judging on the ongoing snoring. </p><p>&ldquo;Coffee?&rdquo; T2 reminded.</p><p>&ldquo;Coffee,&rdquo; Tony nodded and they both walked out of the bedroom. </p><p>***</p><p>Three refills of coffee and one waffle delivery later, Steves walked into the kitchen, looking fresh and chipper.</p><p>&ldquo;Morning, honey,&rdquo; Steve said warmly, kissing Tony&rsquo;s cheek for hello. Tony grumbled his greeting back, still sucked to a coffee cup, letting caffeine fuel him. </p><p>&ldquo;Morning,&rdquo; S2 smiled at his Tony and went to him first, T2 already putting his cheek out for his kiss and smiling back, because he was the yin to Tony&rsquo;s yang. &ldquo;Breakfast smells great,&rdquo; he said, smelling warm waffles and butter and syrup.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not breakfast, that&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; T2 flirted with a charming smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Um, Tony\u2026&rdquo; Steve said insecurely, noticing the almost empty bag of coffee on the counter and the overpowering aroma of coffee in the air. &ldquo;I think you should slow down.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony growled from behind his cup. He would need a nap later for sure. Seeing T2 and S2 cooing to each other was not helping him either. </p><p>&ldquo;He is cranky because he didn&rsquo;t get a lot of sleep today!&rdquo; T2 explained before Steve could ask what already ruined his boyfriend mood. &ldquo;You two had a snoring contest.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Steve grimaced, watching Tony&rsquo;s grumpy face. &ldquo;Why- why didn&rsquo;t you go to the second bedroom?&rdquo; he asked. Seemed logical to him.</p><p>Tony put the empty cup away from his lips. He looked Steve straight in the eyes, huffing a bit, looking agitated. &ldquo;Because you are warm.&rdquo; </p><p>Steve waited for something to follow. Nothing did, as if that explanation should be enough. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Steve said because no better thing came to his mind. Well, that was almost flattering. Taking advantage of the silent moment, S2 slipped in between them and gave Tony a good morning kiss, quickly moving away. Of course, on the lips, as Tony turned his head to match S2&rsquo;s. How come Tony seemed more angry at him than S2? That reminded him that he better hurry up and give a good morning kiss to the other Tony or he would just end with both Tonys being angry, but if he would walk away now, it would just make his Tony angrier and there was no good solution here. \u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;I - I promise to not snore ever again?&rdquo; Steve said, clearly not believing his own words. He just panicked and said the first thing he thought that could amend the situation.</p><p>Tony eyed him for a bit longer, before his chest jumped with a huff of laughter, his shoulders relaxing and not so tight anymore. He put the cup away and used his free hand to put at the back of Steve&rsquo;s neck, urging him closer and stood on his toes, nuzzling into Steve&rsquo;s face, his nose tracing soldier&rsquo;s cheek in a tender move before he rubbed their noses together for few seconds. When they drew apart, Tony&rsquo;s gaze was soft and he looked less tense. </p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s eat while it is still warm,&rdquo; Tony decided, walking around his Steve and joining the other couple at the table. </p><p>Well, that went surprisingly easy. Usually Tony liked to make things more dramatic. Maybe he had just the right amount of coffee to mellow down. Steve turned around and joined the breakfast chaos, and he caught Tony&rsquo;s love filled gaze on him, just as if Steve was something very precious. And Steve smiled, taking Tony&rsquo;s hand in his and thinking the exact same thing about Tony. </p><p>***</p><p>Hours later, Tony was stumbling down the corridor, his head dropping down. The lack of sleep was catching up on him, and he desperately needed a nap. A short, power nap. He had a full right to a nap after the poor quality sleep he got the last night. </p><p>&ldquo;Ack!&rdquo; Tony yelped in protest when he was tackled against the wall before he could reach the bedroom. He opened his mouth to voice his protest out, but a warm palm pressed to his mouth, silencing him.</p><p>&ldquo;Shhh. Don&rsquo;t say a word.&rdquo;</p><p>A very nice shudder ran through Tony&rsquo;s body at the low, husked out voice whispering in his ear. He felt a muscled body pressing into his back, towering over him and hips grinding into his ass. Seemed that Steve came to make up for the awful night he had caused. It wasn&rsquo;t needed, but very welcomed, and Tony would happily let himself be carried to the bedroom for some private time.</p><p>&ldquo;Hands on the wall.&rdquo;</p><p>Oh. That was new. Suddenly all the sleep was gone. Steve wanted to make out here? Here in the middle of the corridor, where T2 or S2 could stumble on them any second?</p><p>&ldquo;Do it.&rdquo; </p><p>It was not a request. Feeling hot all over, Tony pressed both palms to the cool wall, keeping his arms outstretched. It was almost as if he was a criminal and Steve was a policeman, ready to pat him down. Well, that was a nice scenario for a role play. </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony nodded. Steve&rsquo;s hand was still firmly pressed to his mouth and it was getting a whole lot exciting.</p><p>&ldquo;And stay quiet. You don&rsquo;t want anyone walking on us, do you?&rdquo;</p><p>A whole, whole lot exciting. When moist, plumps lips touched his ear and moved all the way down, grazing his neck in a delicate pattern, Tony moved his head back, a small whimper escaping him, muffled by the hand. Little, playful nip on his collarbone and Tony rolled his bitten arm.</p><p>&ldquo;Shh.&rdquo;</p><p>One big hand cupped his jawline, palm sliding down, brushing his neck firmly and making his breath short for a while. Tony didn&rsquo;t mind a little rough play. Down the middle of his chest, the touch becoming lighter at the scar the arc reactor left and Tony was really grateful for that. He didn&rsquo;t need a panic attack setting in. Not when it was getting so good, and Steve caressed his stomach, pressing on the skin under his hand and moved all the way down, stopping at the edge of his tank top and sliding easily into his pants. It was common knowledge that on his free days, Tony liked to go commando and Steve didn&rsquo;t pause for a second feeling bare, heated skin, already expecting that. Fingers pressing into his lower belly, curling into the soft skin and Tony snapped his head up, some involuntary giggle escaping, barely hearable as Steve kept his hand stubbornly pressed to his lips. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, this is a sensitive spot, right?&rdquo;</p><p>More whispering and four fingers kept gently digging into the soft spot, slowly and teasingly. Tony giggled more, shaking his head and curling in himself slightly, his hands sliding a bit down on the wall. Steve pressed his hips firmer into Tony&rsquo;s, helping him to stay upright. </p><p>&ldquo;I would use both hands, but you will just disobey me and make a lot of noise, wouldn&rsquo;t you? You can be a very loud one.&rdquo;</p><p>As to confirm his words, Steve dug his fingertips into the soft lower belly and squeezed the skin repeatedly. Tony jumped, more muffled laughter and breath coming out in short, hot waves. His arms startled to tremble with effort of keeping them in place. A wet kiss on his neck, probably a reward for not moving during the short tickle attack.</p><p>&ldquo;Fortunately, one hand is enough for what I have planned.&rdquo;</p><p>The hand splayed on his lower belly, covering more skin, and Tony&rsquo;s breath stopped in anticipation. South or north. Both options sounded equally lovely. Both made him feel incredibly nervous and giddy. </p><p>When Steve decided on his direction, Tony rolled his stomach, following the movement.</p><p>North.</p><p>Oh boy. </p><p>The hand stopped under his shirt, pressing into the middle of his stomach, his belly button directly under the middle of the palm. Tony couldn&rsquo;t help, and whimpered, feeling that he was in trouble. </p><p>&ldquo;You will enjoy this.&rdquo;</p><p>The touch lightened and a finger pressed directly on his outie, already sending an electric like feeling through his whole body. A gentle pressure, pushing on the ticklish spot and Tony started to giggle frantically, his whole body shivering and becoming heated.</p><p>&ldquo;Or more of, I will enjoy this.&rdquo;</p><p>Of course. </p><p>Everything got blocked out. Tony felt only the light tickle on his outie, his mind reading the feeling as devastating and making his whole body numb, as he continued to laugh, the sound coming out as choked and snorted, obscured by the hand on his lips. He didn&rsquo;t care how ridiculous he sounded, not when the finger on his outie was driving him insane, lightly touching and rubbing, never leaving or stopping, despite the constant hips rocking Tony did, almost as if dancing. Then two fingers, rubbing the small nub in circular motions. It tickled so, so intense, but then another feeling joined. Hot and dizzying, bunching up all his nerves. </p><p>&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; Steve whispered, always in awe how proper stimulation on Tony&rsquo;s outie could both tickle and make him aroused. &ldquo;You are amazing, you know that?&rdquo; Steve whispered with love, continuing the touch, feeling the breathed out giggles and moans on his palm, and almost making Tony&rsquo;s knees buckle. </p><p>When Steve pinched delicately the small nub between his fingers, Tony almost exploded with laughter. When he used his fingers to rub the very sides of the outie, Tony continued to shrill in laughter and tried to suck his belly in. All this was accompanied by the hot, tingling feeling spreading all over his limbs. His hands were slowly giving up and he didn&rsquo;t have enough of will power to keep them on the wall anymore, but he didn&rsquo;t want to stop their play either, so he came up with a different plan. Using the wall as leverage, Tony pushed himself away, bumping his back into Steve&rsquo;s chest and falling with all his weight on him, he raised his arms up and threw over Steve&rsquo;s neck, fingers intertwining on the nape to help himself stay in place. Steve, a little shocked at first, felt a loving, serene feeling taking over him, with Tony being so open and presenting himself to him. That truly was something special. He won&rsquo;t waste this opportunity.</p><p>Steve rolled Tony&rsquo;s shirt up to his chest and used his knuckles to brush over the quivering stomach, up from the ribs, ending on the pant line. Five fingers drawing horizontal lines over the middle, often catching on the belly button, brushing it over and over again. Tony&rsquo;s arms and legs felt limp, but his torso was straight and skin tight as a drum, belly forming a gentle slope, Steve&rsquo;s fingers were following. Somehow during his wiggling, Steve&rsquo;s hand slid down from his lips and stopped only on the lower lip and Tony could laugh properly. It was short-lived when strong fingers poked softly into his mouth, \u00a0two fingers placed on his lower teeth. Tony bit gently on them, understanding that he was still supposed to be quiet, but it was becoming so good and so hot, his breath coming out in short waves and giggles mixing with delighted, short moans. </p><p>A thumb pressed strongly to his belly button and pushed, rubbing on the little numb, and Tony&rsquo;s eyes rolled to the back in delight, all his nerves lighting up with a shimmering, ticklish feeling. Huh. That was new for both of them and Steve was pleasantly surprised with the reaction before he got back to more traditional techniques. Some more circles rubbed directly on his outie, and Tony felt the hot feeling growing in him and stirring his insides, a delightful ringing in his ears becoming louder and louder until he snapped his hips forward and his vision darkened at the edges as he moaned and laughed and came. </p><p>The hold around Steve&rsquo;s neck loosened. Steve moved both of his hands to held Tony under his arms, feeling that his boyfriend was slipping to the floor, exhausted and limbless. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, easy now.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve was gentle and spoke in a soothing voice, turning Tony around, their chests pressing together. The sight almost knocked the breath out of him. Tony was flushed and panting, his eyes sparkling with post orgasm bliss. What made Steve&rsquo;s blood flow faster was that when Tony looked up at him, eyes bright and mouth slightly opened, he saw that Tony wasn&rsquo;t as exhausted as Steve assumed he was. No, he clearly wanted more. Tony surged up, pressing their lips together in a needy, deep kiss, climbing on Steve and entangling fingers into blonde hair, one leg already hooked around soldier\u2019s hip, his whole body pushing into him, silently asking to be lifted up and carried somewhere more private. Or even here, Tony didn&rsquo;t care, as long as he would get more of that.</p><p>&ldquo;Ummm\u2026 What&rsquo;s going on here?&rdquo;</p><p>Steve broke the kiss, hearing the other him behind his back. He looked to the back, admittedly looking startled for a second. Tony looked too, thinking that good that S2 showed up because he wanted to be in a threesome with both Steves for a long, long time and maybe it was the right moment to propose that when-</p><p>It was his Steve. The one with the stunned, shocked expression on his face, standing in the corridor. </p><p>Tony blinked and took a proper look at the Steve he basically had climbed over and got lost in his arms. It was S2. </p><p>Oh, that was a bit awkward. Just a bit. </p><p>Before anything else could happen, S2 grinned that smug, practiced smile, scooping Tony up and walking to Steve. </p><p>&ldquo;Here, I warmed him up for you,&rdquo; he winked and handed Tony over to other him and Tony clung to his soldier. </p><p>&ldquo;The heck-&rdquo; Steve protested, but still held Tony close, his voice lost when he saw how flushed and bothered Tony looked. </p><p>&ldquo;One out of three,&rdquo; S2 said proudly and walked away, smug and pleased with himself.</p><p>&ldquo;Where are you -&rdquo; Steve didn&rsquo;t finish, noticing S2 walking into the bedroom they all shared. And he was pretty sure that earlier today, T2 had collapsed in bed, claiming that he was too tired and needed to get some sleep.</p><p>&ldquo;Steve.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve looked back at Tony. At his heated cheeks, half-lidded, glazed eyes. He was clinging to him and Steve felt the short breath and rapidly beating heart. Tony pushed on Steve, urging him and Steve was a weak, weak man. </p><p>Just like S2 earlier, he scooped Tony up and carried away into the bedroom not occupied by the other couple, and Tony laughed in delight, already kissing and gently biting on Steve&rsquo;s ear to get him faster in the mood. </p><p>Some things could wait.</p><p>***</p><p>&ldquo;How did you do that?&rdquo;</p><p>S2 shut his sketchbook close. He turned his head to the side, eyes meeting with S1, who was leaning over the couch back, looking down at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Did what?&rdquo; S2 asked, tapping fingers on the hardcover. He was getting in the zone when he had to be interrupted.</p><p>&ldquo;You know what,&rdquo; Steve replied, sounding somehow irritated. And not only because he clearly saw the other him sketching not his nr 1 boyfriend. </p><p>There it was. That sly, self-pleased grin showing on S2&rsquo;s face. Steve already felt tense.</p><p>&ldquo;You mean how I made your boyfriend climb you like a tree?&rdquo;</p><p>Steve could reply something snarky. Something very ironic and full of sarcasm, just to shut the other him up. He was fully capable of that. Just, curiosity won over.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Steve admitted with a sigh, dropping his fight stance, &ldquo;that.&rdquo;</p><p>After S1&rsquo;s confession, S2 changed his tone too, his smile dimming into a nicer, gentler one. Even more genuine than his practiced smirk. Steve liked that smile more.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, before I answer that, let me ask you a very fair question,&rdquo; S2 said, and S1 nodded, giving him permission, &ldquo;have you ever slept with a woman?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;WHAT?!&rdquo; Steve burst out, feeling his cheeks burning. S2 was looking back at him, no snark in his posture or voice, just waiting for the answer. And Steve felt very hot under his collar. Okay, he felt a lot closer to S2 since he got here, but such information was not something he was ready to share yet. Some things were supposed to stay only between him and his Tony. </p><p>&ldquo;What it has to do with anything, anyway?&rdquo; Steve asked, nervously tugging on the neckline of his shirt.</p><p>S2 looked at him with pity. S1 didn&rsquo;t intend to correct him. Let the asshole think what he wanted. Oh, he was calling S2 an asshole again. That didn&rsquo;t happen for a while.</p><p>&ldquo;I am gonna leave you with this,&rdquo; S2 said, standing up and tucking his sketchbook under his arm, &ldquo;think what women have and what Tony has.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve&rsquo;s forehead creased in confusion. That didn&rsquo;t make any sense. He watched S2 walk away in the kitchen direction. Well, that wasn&rsquo;t helpful at all and felt like a waste of time. He should know that S2 won&rsquo;t give him a clear answer.</p><p>And then it hit him. His face exploded with a whole new shade of red, one that should be named after him.</p><p>&ldquo;S2!&rdquo;</p><p>At the outraged scream coming from the living room, S2 just smiled, clearly pleased with himself, not stopping smearing bread with butter even for a second.</p><p>***</p><p>&ldquo;You mad?&rdquo;</p><p>Steve didn&rsquo;t answer. He was on the couch, in the exact spot S2 was minutes ago. He was hunched, elbows resting on his knees, one hand on top of the other, and he put his chin on them, lips thinned. Stubborn eyes. </p><p>S2 took another bite out of his sandwich, chewing slowly. He didn&rsquo;t feel remorseful at all.</p><p>&ldquo;If you stop brooding, I will give you the rest of my sandwich.&rdquo;</p><p>No reaction. Maybe even the frown on Steve&rsquo;s face got bigger. Was S2 offering him leftovers?</p><p>&ldquo;Ugh. You want to see what I sketched?&rdquo; </p><p>That got S1&rsquo;s attention. He finally looked at the other him. </p><p>S2 smiled softly. He pushed the rest of the sandwich in his mouth and sat next to Steve, opening his sketchbook. After he swallowed the sandwich, he went through the pages, explaining what he drew and why sharing his memories with Steve.</p><p>And it was sweet again.</p><p>***</p><p>Not so sweet when lunchtime came. Steve and Tony were already in the kitchen, setting the table for four, reheating some leftover Chinese food from last day. Steve put some freshly made rice on the table, intended to go with sweet and sour pork and lemon chicken and some leftover spring rolls no one had room left for, when the other couple entered the kitchen, T2, a little ruffled and dazed and smiling sweetly, having experienced a very nice wake up from his long nap, S2 smiling proud and following his boyfriend.</p><p>&ldquo;Two out of three,&rdquo; S2 said to Steve, grabbing a spring roll and biting into it.</p><p>Steve scoffed, the scoff going unnoticed when Tonys started to chatter with each other. </p><p>If S2 wanted to be an asshole again, S1 won&rsquo;t make it easy for him.</p><p>***</p><p>It happened sooner than Steve thought. After lunch, Steve stayed in the kitchen, scrubbing the dishes. Minutes later, S2 came back, standing behind Steve and pressing into him.</p><p>S1 paused his work. He rearranged his grasp on the sponge and let S2&rsquo;s hands travel along his body, caressing his torso.</p><p>&ldquo;Going for three out of three?&rdquo; S1 asked, pretending to be interested. He felt S2&rsquo;s grin pressed to his neck. Hook, line, and sinker. </p><p>&ldquo;You know it.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve hummed. He turned around in S2&rsquo;s arm and looked deep into his eyes. &ldquo;Not gonna happen,&rdquo; he said strongly, pushing the sponge into S2&rsquo;s chest, leaving a wet mark on his shirt. &ldquo;Finish washing the dishes.&rdquo;</p><p>Stunned, S2 opened his mouth, watching Steve walking away, a pleased smile on his lips. Huh. How the roles reversed.</p><p>&ldquo;You are killing my vibe, S1!&rdquo; S2 called, but obediently dipped his hands in the water and resumed the choir.</p><p>S1 only kept smiling, considering it a win. If S2 wanted it, he would make him work for it.</p><p>***</p><p>The game of cat and mouse lasted for the rest of the day. S2 tried to surprise S1 any occasion he got, and S1 always managed to wriggle away, finding himself something more urgent to do instead. The epitome of pathetic make out attempts was reached when late evening Steve walked out of the shower and into the bedroom, a towel on his hips and another one wiping his hair dry and saw S2 spread on the top of the covers. One of his hands was behind his head, the other one laid down casually along his side, one knee bent. Completely naked. Honestly, the only thing that was missing was a rose between his teeth. </p><p>&ldquo;Seriously, dude?&rdquo; Steve asked, eyeing the other him in disbelief. The asshole could be stubborn. </p><p>&ldquo;You know you want me,&rdquo; S2 said in a sultry whisper.</p><p>&ldquo;You know I could just go back to the bathroom and jerk myself off while looking in the mirror, that would be like making out with you.&rdquo;</p><p>S2 grimaced. That was something he didn&rsquo;t think of before. &ldquo;Oh, come on, man!&rdquo; he whined, losing his cool and making S1 giggle. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be mean!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mean?&rdquo; S1 continued to giggle. &ldquo;Why do you want this anyway? You already had both Tonys.&rdquo;</p><p>S2 zipped his mouth. There was an answer to it, but he was not keen on sharing. Steve felt that maybe it was more serious than he initially assumed and sat down on the bed, next to S2&rsquo;s legs.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on. Tell me,&rdquo; Steve asked, no snark, no irony, just kindness.</p><p>S2 dropped his head, feeling that it was time for honesty hour. &ldquo;I just need to feel on top again,&rdquo; he mumbled his answer out. </p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Steve asked in disbelief, while S2 stubbornly avoided his gaze. &ldquo;What does that even mean- oh. Is it because of what happened yesterday?&rdquo; </p><p>S2&rsquo;s head got even lower and he whimpered something, clearly embarrassed. Of course, he had fun with his Tony. He loved seeing his boyfriend&rsquo;s smiling face and the love-filled look when Steve gave himself over. Just letting go of control was not easy for him. He needed to feel in control again.</p><p>Steve tried to hold back a smile. It wasn&rsquo;t a mean one, but a fond one, while he thought how unreasonable the other he was. Then again, he could imagine what it was so hard for the other him to drop his male alpha act. </p><p>&ldquo;Alright. Three out of three,&rdquo; Steve agreed, tossing the towels aside, deciding to let the other him have this win. S2 perked up at that. &ldquo;But only because you are stupid and you look cute while being stupid.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will take that,&rdquo; S2 nodded, watching S1 climbing over him until their bodies aligned. The kiss was slow and gentle, filling them both with a sweet, soothing feeling. </p><p>&ldquo;You still didn&rsquo;t tell me if you ever slept with a woman,&rdquo; S2 reminded into the kiss.</p><p>Instead of feeling offended, S1 smiled. His counterpart shared two secrets with him today and Steve felt a lot closer to him, finally witnessing the more vulnerable side, S2 was so desperate to hide away from everyone. S1 still called the other him an asshole in his mind, but it was a lot fonder and warm than earlier today.</p><p>&ldquo;If you make as limp and dazed as Tonys, I will tell you,&rdquo; Steve bargained in a honeyed voice.</p><p>A smile spread over S2&rsquo;s lips. Real and honest. Beautiful.</p><p>&ldquo;Can do, doll,&rdquo; S2 took Steve by the shoulders and reversed their positions, getting Steve on his back, while he hovered above him, before sinking down.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p><a href=\"https://lemonsandstrawberries.tumblr.com/post/183754975479/double-trouble-reunion-part-11\">&lt;\u2013</a> previous part // next part \u2014&gt; tbc</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>while you\u2019re here, remember to read a bonus <b>DTR chapter</b> - <i><a href=\"https://lemonsandstrawberries.tumblr.com/post/184996312324/double-trouble-reunion-the-ending-that-wont\">The Ending that won\u2019t happen</a></i> - what would happen if Thanos showed in <b>DTR</b> world? here is your answer!\u00a0</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-<br/></p><p><b>OPENING A TAG LIST FOR DTR!</b> If you want to be noted about updates for this series, leave a comment below or send me an ask!</p><p><b>tag list</b></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPJVwxDeaQzxOgOZH4jTZ3w\">@princess-evans-addict</a> , @<a href=\"http://ticklishwallflower.tumblr.com/\">ticklishwallflower</a>,</p>",

The sound of pneumatic hammers breaking every concrete wall, smooth sound of a laser cutting through every surface, loud raving up of an engine, all coupled with heavy and energizing notes of rock music blasting in the background. It was his everyday bread, something he lived in and was an inherent part of his everyday routine, just like a cup of coffee every morning. While most people would find it unpleasant, it was one of the sweetest music for Tony. Not being bothered by loud, ongoing sounds was a useful skill and definitely helped Tony to sleep through the nights when Steve, with circled eyes and head lolling forward, stumbled into their shared bed after particularly exhausting days and snored for twelve hours, resembling a chainsaw. Tony could sleep happily through it, cuddled to his soldier and wake up refreshed.</p><p>Just not when it was two super soldiers snoring.</p><p>Just no.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Tony shut his eyes tight when it began all over again. Sometimes it was one Steve snoring, and the other started, just when the first ended. Sometimes it was them both, taking turns, as if in some very bad band. The worst was when they got gradually louder, up to a point when it all died down, just to start minutes later.</p><p>Tony didn\u2019t get a lot of sleep, waking up every hour or so, trying to shut his Steve\u2019s mouth from time to time, but it just fell open almost right away.</p><p>Some part of him felt proud that he and T2 managed to tire their boyfriends out the day before during the joined tickle session, but the other part of him told him to get a gag and use it on both blonds because he needed his damn sleep.</p><p>And T2 seemed to sleep through all of this. Lucky bastard. Or at least it was what Tony thought.</p><p>Tony groaned, hearing another snore rumble in Steve\u2019s chest before it left his mouth. He just wanted to sleep and use his boyfriend\u2019s peck as a pillow was that too much to ask? In a quick move, he lifted himself up and looked angrily at his boyfriend, his irritation level rising when he noticed that it was getting bright outside and he painfully felt the consequences of being awake for almost the whole night. And snore. A loud one. Tony put his hand under Steve\u2019s chin and shut his mouth. As usual, it worked for about ten seconds before his mouth opened and the snoring started anew. What was worse, S2 started to snore too, almost as if it was a competition between both blonds who could snore louder. Usually, Tony found the competitiveness between two Captain Americas amusing, but right now, there was nothing endearing about this situation.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t work, huh?\u201d</p><p>Tony winced in surprise, before he looked to the middle of the bed, eyebrows creasing. T2, acting as a small spoon to S2, was wide awake, his eyes red and tired and he kept smiling weakly at his counterpart. Tony felt tired himself, but he liked to think that he looked less chewed out than T2 did.</p><p>\u201cThey woke you up too?\u201d Tony asked in a whisper, wriggling back into the covers. Feeling him back, Steve immediately wrapped arms again around his torso and buried his face into Tony\u2019s shoulder. If he started drooling on him, Tony would have no problems with pushing Steve out of the bed. And it still was the nice option. </p><p>\u201cUgh, I don\u2019t think I slept at all,\u201d T2 admitted in a pained voice, closing his eyes tight, \u201cyou make a lot of ruckus too you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, what?\u201d Tony asked back. He remembered seeing T2 perfectly still the whole night, not flinching even once or giving any other signs of being awake.</p><p>\u201cEach time you moved to quiet one of them, you made me awake all over again. Also, you snore too,\u201d T2 said, opening his eyes and jutting his lower lip forward.</p><p>\u201cYou snore too!\u201d Tony argued back, clearly in self-defense. </p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t be as bad as this one,\u201d T2 said through a yawn, pointing with his head to his Steve. \u201cOr that one,\u201d he continued, meaning the other Steve.</p><p>Tony mellowed down. He and T2 were on the same page here. And somewhere deep, deep down he did feel a bit bad for keeping the other him awake.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I would still take his snoring in favor of the other sound that comes from him during the night,\u201d Tony said, trying to lighten up the mood.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d T2 asked, his face showing some interest.</p><p>\u201cI mean that when the evening earlier he binges on ice cream or pizza with double cheese,\u201d Tony explained, trying to keep his smile to minimum and voice neutral, while he watched the spreading glee on T2\u2019s face. \u201cNo amount of scented candles can help. I think I would be even scared to light up a match near him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoooo,\u201d T2 whined, voice cracking with laughter.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Tony nodded, finally smiling, \u201cI swear, one night our covers didn\u2019t even touch the bed, they just kept floating in the air.\u201d</p><p>T2 buried his face in the pillow, shoulders shaking with laughter. Tony gave him a minute, just enjoying seeing the other him giggling away. It was a cute sight. </p><p>\u201cI am glad mine has a nuts allergy, it just makes his tongue bigger,\u201d T2 said after his giggling fit was over. Then his smiling face changed into a more mischievous one. \u201cActually, sometimes we use it to our advantage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you are just bragging,\u201d Tony narrowed his eyes, and T2 laughed happily. He stopped laughing, when more rumbling snores filled the room, this time coming from both soldiers.</p><p>\u201cI guess we are getting up?\u201d T2 asked while Tony was busy rolling his eyes at the soldier glued to his back.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Let them go deaf alone,\u201d Tony said, gently moving Steve\u2019s hands and wriggling himself out from the covers and making a wobbly way out of the bed, trying not to step on anyone. </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mean that,\u201d T2 cooed, untangling himself from his Steve\u2019s hold. He yelped softly when a hand grabbed his ankle and T1 pulled on it, dragging him all the way down the mattress until he reached the end of the bed and a good portion of his legs was out.</p><p>\u201cI kinda mean that,\u201d Tony said, lack of sleep making him cranky. He lifted the covers up and saw T2\u2019s smiling and amused face. T2 liked to be manhandled a bit too much, but Tony could understand that just as much enjoying manhandling the other him.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, before I lose my hearing,\u201d Tony urged when snoring became louder, and he pulled T2 up and to himself.</p><p>\u201cBreakfast?\u201d T2 asked hopefully, grabbing some basic clothes for him and T1 on their way out.</p><p>\u201cCoffee. Lots,\u201d Tony groaned, tilting his head back. \u201cAnd I have no strength to cook. We will do what we always do on days like this.\u201d</p><p>T2 giggled, handing T1 a tank top and sweat pants. \u201cOrder food and push it as our cooking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh!\u201d T1 quieted the other him, shooting a quick glance at their, hopefully, sleeping boyfriends. There was a limited number of times they could impress Steves with unburnt omelets and poached eggs on toast. Seemed that their secret would remain safe, judging on the ongoing snoring. </p><p>\u201cCoffee?\u201d T2 reminded.</p><p>\u201cCoffee,\u201d Tony nodded and they both walked out of the bedroom. </p><p>***</p><p>Three refills of coffee and one waffle delivery later, Steves walked into the kitchen, looking fresh and chipper.</p><p>\u201cMorning, honey,\u201d Steve said warmly, kissing Tony\u2019s cheek for hello. Tony grumbled his greeting back, still sucked to a coffee cup, letting caffeine fuel him. </p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d S2 smiled at his Tony and went to him first, T2 already putting his cheek out for his kiss and smiling back, because he was the yin to Tony\u2019s yang. \u201cBreakfast smells great,\u201d he said, smelling warm waffles and butter and syrup.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not breakfast, that\u2019s me,\u201d T2 flirted with a charming smile.</p><p>\u201cUm, Tony\u2026\u201d Steve said insecurely, noticing the almost empty bag of coffee on the counter and the overpowering aroma of coffee in the air. \u201cI think you should slow down.\u201d</p><p>Tony growled from behind his cup. He would need a nap later for sure. Seeing T2 and S2 cooing to each other was not helping him either. </p><p>\u201cHe is cranky because he didn\u2019t get a lot of sleep today!\u201d T2 explained before Steve could ask what already ruined his boyfriend mood. \u201cYou two had a snoring contest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Steve grimaced, watching Tony\u2019s grumpy face. \u201cWhy- why didn\u2019t you go to the second bedroom?\u201d he asked. Seemed logical to him.</p><p>Tony put the empty cup away from his lips. He looked Steve straight in the eyes, huffing a bit, looking agitated. \u201cBecause you are warm.\u201d </p><p>Steve waited for something to follow. Nothing did, as if that explanation should be enough. </p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Steve said because no better thing came to his mind. Well, that was almost flattering. Taking advantage of the silent moment, S2 slipped in between them and gave Tony a good morning kiss, quickly moving away. Of course, on the lips, as Tony turned his head to match S2\u2019s. How come Tony seemed more angry at him than S2? That reminded him that he better hurry up and give a good morning kiss to the other Tony or he would just end with both Tonys being angry, but if he would walk away now, it would just make his Tony angrier and there was no good solution here. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI - I promise to not snore ever again?\u201d Steve said, clearly not believing his own words. He just panicked and said the first thing he thought that could amend the situation.</p><p>Tony eyed him for a bit longer, before his chest jumped with a huff of laughter, his shoulders relaxing and not so tight anymore. He put the cup away and used his free hand to put at the back of Steve\u2019s neck, urging him closer and stood on his toes, nuzzling into Steve\u2019s face, his nose tracing soldier\u2019s cheek in a tender move before he rubbed their noses together for few seconds. When they drew apart, Tony\u2019s gaze was soft and he looked less tense. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s eat while it is still warm,\u201d Tony decided, walking around his Steve and joining the other couple at the table. </p><p>Well, that went surprisingly easy. Usually Tony liked to make things more dramatic. Maybe he had just the right amount of coffee to mellow down. Steve turned around and joined the breakfast chaos, and he caught Tony\u2019s love filled gaze on him, just as if Steve was something very precious. And Steve smiled, taking Tony\u2019s hand in his and thinking the exact same thing about Tony. </p><p>***</p><p>Hours later, Tony was stumbling down the corridor, his head dropping down. The lack of sleep was catching up on him, and he desperately needed a nap. A short, power nap. He had a full right to a nap after the poor quality sleep he got the last night. </p><p>\u201cAck!\u201d Tony yelped in protest when he was tackled against the wall before he could reach the bedroom. He opened his mouth to voice his protest out, but a warm palm pressed to his mouth, silencing him.</p><p>\u201cShhh. Don\u2019t say a word.\u201d</p><p>A very nice shudder ran through Tony\u2019s body at the low, husked out voice whispering in his ear. He felt a muscled body pressing into his back, towering over him and hips grinding into his ass. Seemed that Steve came to make up for the awful night he had caused. It wasn\u2019t needed, but very welcomed, and Tony would happily let himself be carried to the bedroom for some private time.</p><p>\u201cHands on the wall.\u201d</p><p>Oh. That was new. Suddenly all the sleep was gone. Steve wanted to make out here? Here in the middle of the corridor, where T2 or S2 could stumble on them any second?</p><p>\u201cDo it.\u201d </p><p>It was not a request. Feeling hot all over, Tony pressed both palms to the cool wall, keeping his arms outstretched. It was almost as if he was a criminal and Steve was a policeman, ready to pat him down. Well, that was a nice scenario for a role play. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>Tony nodded. Steve\u2019s hand was still firmly pressed to his mouth and it was getting a whole lot exciting.</p><p>\u201cAnd stay quiet. You don\u2019t want anyone walking on us, do you?\u201d</p><p>A whole, whole lot exciting. When moist, plumps lips touched his ear and moved all the way down, grazing his neck in a delicate pattern, Tony moved his head back, a small whimper escaping him, muffled by the hand. Little, playful nip on his collarbone and Tony rolled his bitten arm.</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d</p><p>One big hand cupped his jawline, palm sliding down, brushing his neck firmly and making his breath short for a while. Tony didn\u2019t mind a little rough play. Down the middle of his chest, the touch becoming lighter at the scar the arc reactor left and Tony was really grateful for that. He didn\u2019t need a panic attack setting in. Not when it was getting so good, and Steve caressed his stomach, pressing on the skin under his hand and moved all the way down, stopping at the edge of his tank top and sliding easily into his pants. It was common knowledge that on his free days, Tony liked to go commando and Steve didn\u2019t pause for a second feeling bare, heated skin, already expecting that. Fingers pressing into his lower belly, curling into the soft skin and Tony snapped his head up, some involuntary giggle escaping, barely hearable as Steve kept his hand stubbornly pressed to his lips. </p><p>\u201cOh, this is a sensitive spot, right?\u201d</p><p>More whispering and four fingers kept gently digging into the soft spot, slowly and teasingly. Tony giggled more, shaking his head and curling in himself slightly, his hands sliding a bit down on the wall. Steve pressed his hips firmer into Tony\u2019s, helping him to stay upright. </p><p>\u201cI would use both hands, but you will just disobey me and make a lot of noise, wouldn\u2019t you? You can be a very loud one.\u201d</p><p>As to confirm his words, Steve dug his fingertips into the soft lower belly and squeezed the skin repeatedly. Tony jumped, more muffled laughter and breath coming out in short, hot waves. His arms startled to tremble with effort of keeping them in place. A wet kiss on his neck, probably a reward for not moving during the short tickle attack.</p><p>\u201cFortunately, one hand is enough for what I have planned.\u201d</p><p>The hand splayed on his lower belly, covering more skin, and Tony\u2019s breath stopped in anticipation. South or north. Both options sounded equally lovely. Both made him feel incredibly nervous and giddy. </p><p>When Steve decided on his direction, Tony rolled his stomach, following the movement.</p><p>North.</p><p>Oh boy. </p><p>The hand stopped under his shirt, pressing into the middle of his stomach, his belly button directly under the middle of the palm. Tony couldn\u2019t help, and whimpered, feeling that he was in trouble. </p><p>\u201cYou will enjoy this.\u201d</p><p>The touch lightened and a finger pressed directly on his outie, already sending an electric like feeling through his whole body. A gentle pressure, pushing on the ticklish spot and Tony started to giggle frantically, his whole body shivering and becoming heated.</p><p>\u201cOr more of, I will enjoy this.\u201d</p><p>Of course. </p><p>Everything got blocked out. Tony felt only the light tickle on his outie, his mind reading the feeling as devastating and making his whole body numb, as he continued to laugh, the sound coming out as choked and snorted, obscured by the hand on his lips. He didn\u2019t care how ridiculous he sounded, not when the finger on his outie was driving him insane, lightly touching and rubbing, never leaving or stopping, despite the constant hips rocking Tony did, almost as if dancing. Then two fingers, rubbing the small nub in circular motions. It tickled so, so intense, but then another feeling joined. Hot and dizzying, bunching up all his nerves. </p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Steve whispered, always in awe how proper stimulation on Tony\u2019s outie could both tickle and make him aroused. \u201cYou are amazing, you know that?\u201d Steve whispered with love, continuing the touch, feeling the breathed out giggles and moans on his palm, and almost making Tony\u2019s knees buckle. </p><p>When Steve pinched delicately the small nub between his fingers, Tony almost exploded with laughter. When he used his fingers to rub the very sides of the outie, Tony continued to shrill in laughter and tried to suck his belly in. All this was accompanied by the hot, tingling feeling spreading all over his limbs. His hands were slowly giving up and he didn\u2019t have enough of will power to keep them on the wall anymore, but he didn\u2019t want to stop their play either, so he came up with a different plan. Using the wall as leverage, Tony pushed himself away, bumping his back into Steve\u2019s chest and falling with all his weight on him, he raised his arms up and threw over Steve\u2019s neck, fingers intertwining on the nape to help himself stay in place. Steve, a little shocked at first, felt a loving, serene feeling taking over him, with Tony being so open and presenting himself to him. That truly was something special. He won\u2019t waste this opportunity.</p><p>Steve rolled Tony\u2019s shirt up to his chest and used his knuckles to brush over the quivering stomach, up from the ribs, ending on the pant line. Five fingers drawing horizontal lines over the middle, often catching on the belly button, brushing it over and over again. Tony\u2019s arms and legs felt limp, but his torso was straight and skin tight as a drum, belly forming a gentle slope, Steve\u2019s fingers were following. Somehow during his wiggling, Steve\u2019s hand slid down from his lips and stopped only on the lower lip and Tony could laugh properly. It was short-lived when strong fingers poked softly into his mouth, \u00a0two fingers placed on his lower teeth. Tony bit gently on them, understanding that he was still supposed to be quiet, but it was becoming so good and so hot, his breath coming out in short waves and giggles mixing with delighted, short moans. </p><p>A thumb pressed strongly to his belly button and pushed, rubbing on the little numb, and Tony\u2019s eyes rolled to the back in delight, all his nerves lighting up with a shimmering, ticklish feeling. Huh. That was new for both of them and Steve was pleasantly surprised with the reaction before he got back to more traditional techniques. Some more circles rubbed directly on his outie, and Tony felt the hot feeling growing in him and stirring his insides, a delightful ringing in his ears becoming louder and louder until he snapped his hips forward and his vision darkened at the edges as he moaned and laughed and came. </p><p>The hold around Steve\u2019s neck loosened. Steve moved both of his hands to held Tony under his arms, feeling that his boyfriend was slipping to the floor, exhausted and limbless. </p><p>\u201cHey, easy now.\u201d</p><p>Steve was gentle and spoke in a soothing voice, turning Tony around, their chests pressing together. The sight almost knocked the breath out of him. Tony was flushed and panting, his eyes sparkling with post orgasm bliss. What made Steve\u2019s blood flow faster was that when Tony looked up at him, eyes bright and mouth slightly opened, he saw that Tony wasn\u2019t as exhausted as Steve assumed he was. No, he clearly wanted more. Tony surged up, pressing their lips together in a needy, deep kiss, climbing on Steve and entangling fingers into blonde hair, one leg already hooked around soldier\u2019s hip, his whole body pushing into him, silently asking to be lifted up and carried somewhere more private. Or even here, Tony didn\u2019t care, as long as he would get more of that.</p><p>\u201cUmmm\u2026 What\u2019s going on here?\u201d</p><p>Steve broke the kiss, hearing the other him behind his back. He looked to the back, admittedly looking startled for a second. Tony looked too, thinking that good that S2 showed up because he wanted to be in a threesome with both Steves for a long, long time and maybe it was the right moment to propose that when-</p><p>It was his Steve. The one with the stunned, shocked expression on his face, standing in the corridor. </p><p>Tony blinked and took a proper look at the Steve he basically had climbed over and got lost in his arms. It was S2. </p><p>Oh, that was a bit awkward. Just a bit. </p><p>Before anything else could happen, S2 grinned that smug, practiced smile, scooping Tony up and walking to Steve. </p><p>\u201cHere, I warmed him up for you,\u201d he winked and handed Tony over to other him and Tony clung to his soldier. </p><p>\u201cThe heck-\u201d Steve protested, but still held Tony close, his voice lost when he saw how flushed and bothered Tony looked. </p><p>\u201cOne out of three,\u201d S2 said proudly and walked away, smug and pleased with himself.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you -\u201d Steve didn\u2019t finish, noticing S2 walking into the bedroom they all shared. And he was pretty sure that earlier today, T2 had collapsed in bed, claiming that he was too tired and needed to get some sleep.</p><p>\u201cSteve.\u201d</p><p>Steve looked back at Tony. At his heated cheeks, half-lidded, glazed eyes. He was clinging to him and Steve felt the short breath and rapidly beating heart. Tony pushed on Steve, urging him and Steve was a weak, weak man. </p><p>Just like S2 earlier, he scooped Tony up and carried away into the bedroom not occupied by the other couple, and Tony laughed in delight, already kissing and gently biting on Steve\u2019s ear to get him faster in the mood. </p><p>Some things could wait.</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cHow did you do that?\u201d</p><p>S2 shut his sketchbook close. He turned his head to the side, eyes meeting with S1, who was leaning over the couch back, looking down at him.</p><p>\u201cDid what?\u201d S2 asked, tapping fingers on the hardcover. He was getting in the zone when he had to be interrupted.</p><p>\u201cYou know what,\u201d Steve replied, sounding somehow irritated. And not only because he clearly saw the other him sketching not his nr 1 boyfriend. </p><p>There it was. That sly, self-pleased grin showing on S2\u2019s face. Steve already felt tense.</p><p>\u201cYou mean how I made your boyfriend climb you like a tree?\u201d</p><p>Steve could reply something snarky. Something very ironic and full of sarcasm, just to shut the other him up. He was fully capable of that. Just, curiosity won over.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Steve admitted with a sigh, dropping his fight stance, \u201cthat.\u201d</p><p>After S1\u2019s confession, S2 changed his tone too, his smile dimming into a nicer, gentler one. Even more genuine than his practiced smirk. Steve liked that smile more.</p><p>\u201cWell, before I answer that, let me ask you a very fair question,\u201d S2 said, and S1 nodded, giving him permission, \u201chave you ever slept with a woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWHAT?!\u201d Steve burst out, feeling his cheeks burning. S2 was looking back at him, no snark in his posture or voice, just waiting for the answer. And Steve felt very hot under his collar. Okay, he felt a lot closer to S2 since he got here, but such information was not something he was ready to share yet. Some things were supposed to stay only between him and his Tony. </p><p>\u201cWhat it has to do with anything, anyway?\u201d Steve asked, nervously tugging on the neckline of his shirt.</p><p>S2 looked at him with pity. S1 didn\u2019t intend to correct him. Let the asshole think what he wanted. Oh, he was calling S2 an asshole again. That didn\u2019t happen for a while.</p><p>\u201cI am gonna leave you with this,\u201d S2 said, standing up and tucking his sketchbook under his arm, \u201cthink what women have and what Tony has.\u201d</p><p>Steve\u2019s forehead creased in confusion. That didn\u2019t make any sense. He watched S2 walk away in the kitchen direction. Well, that wasn\u2019t helpful at all and felt like a waste of time. He should know that S2 won\u2019t give him a clear answer.</p><p>And then it hit him. His face exploded with a whole new shade of red, one that should be named after him.</p><p>\u201cS2!\u201d</p><p>At the outraged scream coming from the living room, S2 just smiled, clearly pleased with himself, not stopping smearing bread with butter even for a second.</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cYou mad?\u201d</p><p>Steve didn\u2019t answer. He was on the couch, in the exact spot S2 was minutes ago. He was hunched, elbows resting on his knees, one hand on top of the other, and he put his chin on them, lips thinned. Stubborn eyes. </p><p>S2 took another bite out of his sandwich, chewing slowly. He didn\u2019t feel remorseful at all.</p><p>\u201cIf you stop brooding, I will give you the rest of my sandwich.\u201d</p><p>No reaction. Maybe even the frown on Steve\u2019s face got bigger. Was S2 offering him leftovers?</p><p>\u201cUgh. You want to see what I sketched?\u201d </p><p>That got S1\u2019s attention. He finally looked at the other him. </p><p>S2 smiled softly. He pushed the rest of the sandwich in his mouth and sat next to Steve, opening his sketchbook. After he swallowed the sandwich, he went through the pages, explaining what he drew and why sharing his memories with Steve.</p><p>And it was sweet again.</p><p>***</p><p>Not so sweet when lunchtime came. Steve and Tony were already in the kitchen, setting the table for four, reheating some leftover Chinese food from last day. Steve put some freshly made rice on the table, intended to go with sweet and sour pork and lemon chicken and some leftover spring rolls no one had room left for, when the other couple entered the kitchen, T2, a little ruffled and dazed and smiling sweetly, having experienced a very nice wake up from his long nap, S2 smiling proud and following his boyfriend.</p><p>\u201cTwo out of three,\u201d S2 said to Steve, grabbing a spring roll and biting into it.</p><p>Steve scoffed, the scoff going unnoticed when Tonys started to chatter with each other. </p><p>If S2 wanted to be an asshole again, S1 won\u2019t make it easy for him.</p><p>***</p><p>It happened sooner than Steve thought. After lunch, Steve stayed in the kitchen, scrubbing the dishes. Minutes later, S2 came back, standing behind Steve and pressing into him.</p><p>S1 paused his work. He rearranged his grasp on the sponge and let S2\u2019s hands travel along his body, caressing his torso.</p><p>\u201cGoing for three out of three?\u201d S1 asked, pretending to be interested. He felt S2\u2019s grin pressed to his neck. Hook, line, and sinker. </p><p>\u201cYou know it.\u201d</p><p>Steve hummed. He turned around in S2\u2019s arm and looked deep into his eyes. \u201cNot gonna happen,\u201d he said strongly, pushing the sponge into S2\u2019s chest, leaving a wet mark on his shirt. \u201cFinish washing the dishes.\u201d</p><p>Stunned, S2 opened his mouth, watching Steve walking away, a pleased smile on his lips. Huh. How the roles reversed.</p><p>\u201cYou are killing my vibe, S1!\u201d S2 called, but obediently dipped his hands in the water and resumed the choir.</p><p>S1 only kept smiling, considering it a win. If S2 wanted it, he would make him work for it.</p><p>***</p><p>The game of cat and mouse lasted for the rest of the day. S2 tried to surprise S1 any occasion he got, and S1 always managed to wriggle away, finding himself something more urgent to do instead. The epitome of pathetic make out attempts was reached when late evening Steve walked out of the shower and into the bedroom, a towel on his hips and another one wiping his hair dry and saw S2 spread on the top of the covers. One of his hands was behind his head, the other one laid down casually along his side, one knee bent. Completely naked. Honestly, the only thing that was missing was a rose between his teeth. </p><p>\u201cSeriously, dude?\u201d Steve asked, eyeing the other him in disbelief. The asshole could be stubborn. </p><p>\u201cYou know you want me,\u201d S2 said in a sultry whisper.</p><p>\u201cYou know I could just go back to the bathroom and jerk myself off while looking in the mirror, that would be like making out with you.\u201d</p><p>S2 grimaced. That was something he didn\u2019t think of before. \u201cOh, come on, man!\u201d he whined, losing his cool and making S1 giggle. \u201cDon\u2019t be mean!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMean?\u201d S1 continued to giggle. \u201cWhy do you want this anyway? You already had both Tonys.\u201d</p><p>S2 zipped his mouth. There was an answer to it, but he was not keen on sharing. Steve felt that maybe it was more serious than he initially assumed and sat down on the bed, next to S2\u2019s legs.</p><p>\u201cCome on. Tell me,\u201d Steve asked, no snark, no irony, just kindness.</p><p>S2 dropped his head, feeling that it was time for honesty hour. \u201cI just need to feel on top again,\u201d he mumbled his answer out. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Steve asked in disbelief, while S2 stubbornly avoided his gaze. \u201cWhat does that even mean- oh. Is it because of what happened yesterday?\u201d </p><p>S2\u2019s head got even lower and he whimpered something, clearly embarrassed. Of course, he had fun with his Tony. He loved seeing his boyfriend\u2019s smiling face and the love-filled look when Steve gave himself over. Just letting go of control was not easy for him. He needed to feel in control again.</p><p>Steve tried to hold back a smile. It wasn\u2019t a mean one, but a fond one, while he thought how unreasonable the other he was. Then again, he could imagine what it was so hard for the other him to drop his male alpha act. </p><p>\u201cAlright. Three out of three,\u201d Steve agreed, tossing the towels aside, deciding to let the other him have this win. S2 perked up at that. \u201cBut only because you are stupid and you look cute while being stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will take that,\u201d S2 nodded, watching S1 climbing over him until their bodies aligned. The kiss was slow and gentle, filling them both with a sweet, soothing feeling. </p><p>\u201cYou still didn\u2019t tell me if you ever slept with a woman,\u201d S2 reminded into the kiss.</p><p>Instead of feeling offended, S1 smiled. His counterpart shared two secrets with him today and Steve felt a lot closer to him, finally witnessing the more vulnerable side, S2 was so desperate to hide away from everyone.

The sound of pneumatic hammers breaking every concrete wall, smooth sound of a laser cutting through every surface, loud raving up of an engine, all coupled with heavy and energizing notes of rock music blasting in the background. It was his everyday bread, something he lived in and was an inherent part of his everyday routine, just like a cup of coffee every morning. While most people would find it unpleasant, it was one of the sweetest music for Tony. Not being bothered by loud, ongoing sounds was a useful skill and definitely helped Tony to sleep through the nights when Steve, with circled eyes and head lolling forward, stumbled into their shared bed after particularly exhausting days and snored for twelve hours, resembling a chainsaw. Tony could sleep happily through it, cuddled to his soldier and wake up refreshed.</p><p>Just not when it was two super soldiers snoring.</p><p>Just no.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Tony shut his eyes tight when it began all over again. Sometimes it was one Steve snoring, and the other started, just when the first ended. Sometimes it was them both, taking turns, as if in some very bad band. The worst was when they got gradually louder, up to a point when it all died down, just to start minutes later.</p><p>Tony didn\u2019t get a lot of sleep, waking up every hour or so, trying to shut his Steve\u2019s mouth from time to time, but it just fell open almost right away.</p><p>Some part of him felt proud that he and T2 managed to tire their boyfriends out the day before during the joined tickle session, but the other part of him told him to get a gag and use it on both blonds because he needed his damn sleep.</p><p>And T2 seemed to sleep through all of this. Lucky bastard. Or at least it was what Tony thought.</p><p>Tony groaned, hearing another snore rumble in Steve\u2019s chest before it left his mouth. He just wanted to sleep and use his boyfriend\u2019s peck as a pillow was that too much to ask? In a quick move, he lifted himself up and looked angrily at his boyfriend, his irritation level rising when he noticed that it was getting bright outside and he painfully felt the consequences of being awake for almost the whole night. And snore. A loud one. Tony put his hand under Steve\u2019s chin and shut his mouth. As usual, it worked for about ten seconds before his mouth opened and the snoring started anew. What was worse, S2 started to snore too, almost as if it was a competition between both blonds who could snore louder. Usually, Tony found the competitiveness between two Captain Americas amusing, but right now, there was nothing endearing about this situation.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t work, huh?\u201d</p><p>Tony winced in surprise, before he looked to the middle of the bed, eyebrows creasing. T2, acting as a small spoon to S2, was wide awake, his eyes red and tired and he kept smiling weakly at his counterpart. Tony felt tired himself, but he liked to think that he looked less chewed out than T2 did.</p><p>\u201cThey woke you up too?\u201d Tony asked in a whisper, wriggling back into the covers. Feeling him back, Steve immediately wrapped arms again around his torso and buried his face into Tony\u2019s shoulder. If he started drooling on him, Tony would have no problems with pushing Steve out of the bed. And it still was the nice option. </p><p>\u201cUgh, I don\u2019t think I slept at all,\u201d T2 admitted in a pained voice, closing his eyes tight, \u201cyou make a lot of ruckus too you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, what?\u201d Tony asked back. He remembered seeing T2 perfectly still the whole night, not flinching even once or giving any other signs of being awake.</p><p>\u201cEach time you moved to quiet one of them, you made me awake all over again. Also, you snore too,\u201d T2 said, opening his eyes and jutting his lower lip forward.</p><p>\u201cYou snore too!\u201d Tony argued back, clearly in self-defense. </p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t be as bad as this one,\u201d T2 said through a yawn, pointing with his head to his Steve. \u201cOr that one,\u201d he continued, meaning the other Steve.</p><p>Tony mellowed down. He and T2 were on the same page here. And somewhere deep, deep down he did feel a bit bad for keeping the other him awake.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I would still take his snoring in favor of the other sound that comes from him during the night,\u201d Tony said, trying to lighten up the mood.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d T2 asked, his face showing some interest.</p><p>\u201cI mean that when the evening earlier he binges on ice cream or pizza with double cheese,\u201d Tony explained, trying to keep his smile to minimum and voice neutral, while he watched the spreading glee on T2\u2019s face. \u201cNo amount of scented candles can help. I think I would be even scared to light up a match near him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoooo,\u201d T2 whined, voice cracking with laughter.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Tony nodded, finally smiling, \u201cI swear, one night our covers didn\u2019t even touch the bed, they just kept floating in the air.\u201d</p><p>T2 buried his face in the pillow, shoulders shaking with laughter. Tony gave him a minute, just enjoying seeing the other him giggling away. It was a cute sight. </p><p>\u201cI am glad mine has a nuts allergy, it just makes his tongue bigger,\u201d T2 said after his giggling fit was over. Then his smiling face changed into a more mischievous one. \u201cActually, sometimes we use it to our advantage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you are just bragging,\u201d Tony narrowed his eyes, and T2 laughed happily. He stopped laughing, when more rumbling snores filled the room, this time coming from both soldiers.</p><p>\u201cI guess we are getting up?\u201d T2 asked while Tony was busy rolling his eyes at the soldier glued to his back.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Let them go deaf alone,\u201d Tony said, gently moving Steve\u2019s hands and wriggling himself out from the covers and making a wobbly way out of the bed, trying not to step on anyone. </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mean that,\u201d T2 cooed, untangling himself from his Steve\u2019s hold. He yelped softly when a hand grabbed his ankle and T1 pulled on it, dragging him all the way down the mattress until he reached the end of the bed and a good portion of his legs was out.</p><p>\u201cI kinda mean that,\u201d Tony said, lack of sleep making him cranky. He lifted the covers up and saw T2\u2019s smiling and amused face. T2 liked to be manhandled a bit too much, but Tony could understand that just as much enjoying manhandling the other him.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, before I lose my hearing,\u201d Tony urged when snoring became louder, and he pulled T2 up and to himself.</p><p>\u201cBreakfast?\u201d T2 asked hopefully, grabbing some basic clothes for him and T1 on their way out.</p><p>\u201cCoffee. Lots,\u201d Tony groaned, tilting his head back. \u201cAnd I have no strength to cook. We will do what we always do on days like this.\u201d</p><p>T2 giggled, handing T1 a tank top and sweat pants. \u201cOrder food and push it as our cooking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh!\u201d T1 quieted the other him, shooting a quick glance at their, hopefully, sleeping boyfriends. There was a limited number of times they could impress Steves with unburnt omelets and poached eggs on toast. Seemed that their secret would remain safe, judging on the ongoing snoring. </p><p>\u201cCoffee?\u201d T2 reminded.</p><p>\u201cCoffee,\u201d Tony nodded and they both walked out of the bedroom. </p><p>***</p><p>Three refills of coffee and one waffle delivery later, Steves walked into the kitchen, looking fresh and chipper.</p><p>\u201cMorning, honey,\u201d Steve said warmly, kissing Tony\u2019s cheek for hello. Tony grumbled his greeting back, still sucked to a coffee cup, letting caffeine fuel him. </p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d S2 smiled at his Tony and went to him first, T2 already putting his cheek out for his kiss and smiling back, because he was the yin to Tony\u2019s yang. \u201cBreakfast smells great,\u201d he said, smelling warm waffles and butter and syrup.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not breakfast, that\u2019s me,\u201d T2 flirted with a charming smile.</p><p>\u201cUm, Tony\u2026\u201d Steve said insecurely, noticing the almost empty bag of coffee on the counter and the overpowering aroma of coffee in the air. \u201cI think you should slow down.\u201d</p><p>Tony growled from behind his cup. He would need a nap later for sure. Seeing T2 and S2 cooing to each other was not helping him either. </p><p>\u201cHe is cranky because he didn\u2019t get a lot of sleep today!\u201d T2 explained before Steve could ask what already ruined his boyfriend mood. \u201cYou two had a snoring contest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Steve grimaced, watching Tony\u2019s grumpy face. \u201cWhy- why didn\u2019t you go to the second bedroom?\u201d he asked. Seemed logical to him.</p><p>Tony put the empty cup away from his lips. He looked Steve straight in the eyes, huffing a bit, looking agitated. \u201cBecause you are warm.\u201d </p><p>Steve waited for something to follow. Nothing did, as if that explanation should be enough. </p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Steve said because no better thing came to his mind. Well, that was almost flattering. Taking advantage of the silent moment, S2 slipped in between them and gave Tony a good morning kiss, quickly moving away. Of course, on the lips, as Tony turned his head to match S2\u2019s. How come Tony seemed more angry at him than S2? That reminded him that he better hurry up and give a good morning kiss to the other Tony or he would just end with both Tonys being angry, but if he would walk away now, it would just make his Tony angrier and there was no good solution here. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI - I promise to not snore ever again?\u201d Steve said, clearly not believing his own words. He just panicked and said the first thing he thought that could amend the situation.</p><p>Tony eyed him for a bit longer, before his chest jumped with a huff of laughter, his shoulders relaxing and not so tight anymore. He put the cup away and used his free hand to put at the back of Steve\u2019s neck, urging him closer and stood on his toes, nuzzling into Steve\u2019s face, his nose tracing soldier\u2019s cheek in a tender move before he rubbed their noses together for few seconds. When they drew apart, Tony\u2019s gaze was soft and he looked less tense. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s eat while it is still warm,\u201d Tony decided, walking around his Steve and joining the other couple at the table. </p><p>Well, that went surprisingly easy. Usually Tony liked to make things more dramatic. Maybe he had just the right amount of coffee to mellow down. Steve turned around and joined the breakfast chaos, and he caught Tony\u2019s love filled gaze on him, just as if Steve was something very precious. And Steve smiled, taking Tony\u2019s hand in his and thinking the exact same thing about Tony. </p><p>***</p><p>Hours later, Tony was stumbling down the corridor, his head dropping down. The lack of sleep was catching up on him, and he desperately needed a nap. A short, power nap. He had a full right to a nap after the poor quality sleep he got the last night. </p><p>\u201cAck!\u201d Tony yelped in protest when he was tackled against the wall before he could reach the bedroom. He opened his mouth to voice his protest out, but a warm palm pressed to his mouth, silencing him.</p><p>\u201cShhh. Don\u2019t say a word.\u201d</p><p>A very nice shudder ran through Tony\u2019s body at the low, husked out voice whispering in his ear. He felt a muscled body pressing into his back, towering over him and hips grinding into his ass. Seemed that Steve came to make up for the awful night he had caused. It wasn\u2019t needed, but very welcomed, and Tony would happily let himself be carried to the bedroom for some private time.</p><p>\u201cHands on the wall.\u201d</p><p>Oh. That was new. Suddenly all the sleep was gone. Steve wanted to make out here? Here in the middle of the corridor, where T2 or S2 could stumble on them any second?</p><p>\u201cDo it.\u201d </p><p>It was not a request. Feeling hot all over, Tony pressed both palms to the cool wall, keeping his arms outstretched. It was almost as if he was a criminal and Steve was a policeman, ready to pat him down. Well, that was a nice scenario for a role play. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>Tony nodded. Steve\u2019s hand was still firmly pressed to his mouth and it was getting a whole lot exciting.</p><p>\u201cAnd stay quiet. You don\u2019t want anyone walking on us, do you?\u201d</p><p>A whole, whole lot exciting. When moist, plumps lips touched his ear and moved all the way down, grazing his neck in a delicate pattern, Tony moved his head back, a small whimper escaping him, muffled by the hand. Little, playful nip on his collarbone and Tony rolled his bitten arm.</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d</p><p>One big hand cupped his jawline, palm sliding down, brushing his neck firmly and making his breath short for a while. Tony didn\u2019t mind a little rough play. Down the middle of his chest, the touch becoming lighter at the scar the arc reactor left and Tony was really grateful for that. He didn\u2019t need a panic attack setting in. Not when it was getting so good, and Steve caressed his stomach, pressing on the skin under his hand and moved all the way down, stopping at the edge of his tank top and sliding easily into his pants. It was common knowledge that on his free days, Tony liked to go commando and Steve didn\u2019t pause for a second feeling bare, heated skin, already expecting that. Fingers pressing into his lower belly, curling into the soft skin and Tony snapped his head up, some involuntary giggle escaping, barely hearable as Steve kept his hand stubbornly pressed to his lips. </p><p>\u201cOh, this is a sensitive spot, right?\u201d</p><p>More whispering and four fingers kept gently digging into the soft spot, slowly and teasingly. Tony giggled more, shaking his head and curling in himself slightly, his hands sliding a bit down on the wall. Steve pressed his hips firmer into Tony\u2019s, helping him to stay upright. </p><p>\u201cI would use both hands, but you will just disobey me and make a lot of noise, wouldn\u2019t you? You can be a very loud one.\u201d</p><p>As to confirm his words, Steve dug his fingertips into the soft lower belly and squeezed the skin repeatedly. Tony jumped, more muffled laughter and breath coming out in short, hot waves. His arms startled to tremble with effort of keeping them in place. A wet kiss on his neck, probably a reward for not moving during the short tickle attack.</p><p>\u201cFortunately, one hand is enough for what I have planned.\u201d</p><p>The hand splayed on his lower belly, covering more skin, and Tony\u2019s breath stopped in anticipation. South or north. Both options sounded equally lovely. Both made him feel incredibly nervous and giddy. </p><p>When Steve decided on his direction, Tony rolled his stomach, following the movement.</p><p>North.</p><p>Oh boy. </p><p>The hand stopped under his shirt, pressing into the middle of his stomach, his belly button directly under the middle of the palm. Tony couldn\u2019t help, and whimpered, feeling that he was in trouble. </p><p>\u201cYou will enjoy this.\u201d</p><p>The touch lightened and a finger pressed directly on his outie, already sending an electric like feeling through his whole body. A gentle pressure, pushing on the ticklish spot and Tony started to giggle frantically, his whole body shivering and becoming heated.</p><p>\u201cOr more of, I will enjoy this.\u201d</p><p>Of course. </p><p>Everything got blocked out. Tony felt only the light tickle on his outie, his mind reading the feeling as devastating and making his whole body numb, as he continued to laugh, the sound coming out as choked and snorted, obscured by the hand on his lips. He didn\u2019t care how ridiculous he sounded, not when the finger on his outie was driving him insane, lightly touching and rubbing, never leaving or stopping, despite the constant hips rocking Tony did, almost as if dancing. Then two fingers, rubbing the small nub in circular motions. It tickled so, so intense, but then another feeling joined. Hot and dizzying, bunching up all his nerves. </p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Steve whispered, always in awe how proper stimulation on Tony\u2019s outie could both tickle and make him aroused. \u201cYou are amazing, you know that?\u201d Steve whispered with love, continuing the touch, feeling the breathed out giggles and moans on his palm, and almost making Tony\u2019s knees buckle. </p><p>When Steve pinched delicately the small nub between his fingers, Tony almost exploded with laughter. When he used his fingers to rub the very sides of the outie, Tony continued to shrill in laughter and tried to suck his belly in. All this was accompanied by the hot, tingling feeling spreading all over his limbs. His hands were slowly giving up and he didn\u2019t have enough of will power to keep them on the wall anymore, but he didn\u2019t want to stop their play either, so he came up with a different plan. Using the wall as leverage, Tony pushed himself away, bumping his back into Steve\u2019s chest and falling with all his weight on him, he raised his arms up and threw over Steve\u2019s neck, fingers intertwining on the nape to help himself stay in place. Steve, a little shocked at first, felt a loving, serene feeling taking over him, with Tony being so open and presenting himself to him. That truly was something special. He won\u2019t waste this opportunity.</p><p>Steve rolled Tony\u2019s shirt up to his chest and used his knuckles to brush over the quivering stomach, up from the ribs, ending on the pant line. Five fingers drawing horizontal lines over the middle, often catching on the belly button, brushing it over and over again. Tony\u2019s arms and legs felt limp, but his torso was straight and skin tight as a drum, belly forming a gentle slope, Steve\u2019s fingers were following. Somehow during his wiggling, Steve\u2019s hand slid down from his lips and stopped only on the lower lip and Tony could laugh properly. It was short-lived when strong fingers poked softly into his mouth, \u00a0two fingers placed on his lower teeth. Tony bit gently on them, understanding that he was still supposed to be quiet, but it was becoming so good and so hot, his breath coming out in short waves and giggles mixing with delighted, short moans. </p><p>A thumb pressed strongly to his belly button and pushed, rubbing on the little numb, and Tony\u2019s eyes rolled to the back in delight, all his nerves lighting up with a shimmering, ticklish feeling. Huh. That was new for both of them and Steve was pleasantly surprised with the reaction before he got back to more traditional techniques. Some more circles rubbed directly on his outie, and Tony felt the hot feeling growing in him and stirring his insides, a delightful ringing in his ears becoming louder and louder until he snapped his hips forward and his vision darkened at the edges as he moaned and laughed and came. </p><p>The hold around Steve\u2019s neck loosened. Steve moved both of his hands to held Tony under his arms, feeling that his boyfriend was slipping to the floor, exhausted and limbless. </p><p>\u201cHey, easy now.\u201d</p><p>Steve was gentle and spoke in a soothing voice, turning Tony around, their chests pressing together. The sight almost knocked the breath out of him. Tony was flushed and panting, his eyes sparkling with post orgasm bliss. What made Steve\u2019s blood flow faster was that when Tony looked up at him, eyes bright and mouth slightly opened, he saw that Tony wasn\u2019t as exhausted as Steve assumed he was. No, he clearly wanted more. Tony surged up, pressing their lips together in a needy, deep kiss, climbing on Steve and entangling fingers into blonde hair, one leg already hooked around soldier\u2019s hip, his whole body pushing into him, silently asking to be lifted up and carried somewhere more private. Or even here, Tony didn\u2019t care, as long as he would get more of that.</p><p>\u201cUmmm\u2026 What\u2019s going on here?\u201d</p><p>Steve broke the kiss, hearing the other him behind his back. He looked to the back, admittedly looking startled for a second. Tony looked too, thinking that good that S2 showed up because he wanted to be in a threesome with both Steves for a long, long time and maybe it was the right moment to propose that when-</p><p>It was his Steve. The one with the stunned, shocked expression on his face, standing in the corridor. </p><p>Tony blinked and took a proper look at the Steve he basically had climbed over and got lost in his arms. It was S2. </p><p>Oh, that was a bit awkward. Just a bit. </p><p>Before anything else could happen, S2 grinned that smug, practiced smile, scooping Tony up and walking to Steve. </p><p>\u201cHere, I warmed him up for you,\u201d he winked and handed Tony over to other him and Tony clung to his soldier. </p><p>\u201cThe heck-\u201d Steve protested, but still held Tony close, his voice lost when he saw how flushed and bothered Tony looked. </p><p>\u201cOne out of three,\u201d S2 said proudly and walked away, smug and pleased with himself.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you -\u201d Steve didn\u2019t finish, noticing S2 walking into the bedroom they all shared. And he was pretty sure that earlier today, T2 had collapsed in bed, claiming that he was too tired and needed to get some sleep.</p><p>\u201cSteve.\u201d</p><p>Steve looked back at Tony. At his heated cheeks, half-lidded, glazed eyes. He was clinging to him and Steve felt the short breath and rapidly beating heart. Tony pushed on Steve, urging him and Steve was a weak, weak man. </p><p>Just like S2 earlier, he scooped Tony up and carried away into the bedroom not occupied by the other couple, and Tony laughed in delight, already kissing and gently biting on Steve\u2019s ear to get him faster in the mood. </p><p>Some things could wait.</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cHow did you do that?\u201d</p><p>S2 shut his sketchbook close. He turned his head to the side, eyes meeting with S1, who was leaning over the couch back, looking down at him.</p><p>\u201cDid what?\u201d S2 asked, tapping fingers on the hardcover. He was getting in the zone when he had to be interrupted.</p><p>\u201cYou know what,\u201d Steve replied, sounding somehow irritated. And not only because he clearly saw the other him sketching not his nr 1 boyfriend. </p><p>There it was. That sly, self-pleased grin showing on S2\u2019s face. Steve already felt tense.</p><p>\u201cYou mean how I made your boyfriend climb you like a tree?\u201d</p><p>Steve could reply something snarky. Something very ironic and full of sarcasm, just to shut the other him up. He was fully capable of that. Just, curiosity won over.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Steve admitted with a sigh, dropping his fight stance, \u201cthat.\u201d</p><p>After S1\u2019s confession, S2 changed his tone too, his smile dimming into a nicer, gentler one. Even more genuine than his practiced smirk. Steve liked that smile more.</p><p>\u201cWell, before I answer that, let me ask you a very fair question,\u201d S2 said, and S1 nodded, giving him permission, \u201chave you ever slept with a woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWHAT?!\u201d Steve burst out, feeling his cheeks burning. S2 was looking back at him, no snark in his posture or voice, just waiting for the answer. And Steve felt very hot under his collar. Okay, he felt a lot closer to S2 since he got here, but such information was not something he was ready to share yet. Some things were supposed to stay only between him and his Tony. </p><p>\u201cWhat it has to do with anything, anyway?\u201d Steve asked, nervously tugging on the neckline of his shirt.</p><p>S2 looked at him with pity. S1 didn\u2019t intend to correct him. Let the asshole think what he wanted. Oh, he was calling S2 an asshole again. That didn\u2019t happen for a while.</p><p>\u201cI am gonna leave you with this,\u201d S2 said, standing up and tucking his sketchbook under his arm, \u201cthink what women have and what Tony has.\u201d</p><p>Steve\u2019s forehead creased in confusion. That didn\u2019t make any sense. He watched S2 walk away in the kitchen direction. Well, that wasn\u2019t helpful at all and felt like a waste of time. He should know that S2 won\u2019t give him a clear answer.</p><p>And then it hit him. His face exploded with a whole new shade of red, one that should be named after him.</p><p>\u201cS2!\u201d</p><p>At the outraged scream coming from the living room, S2 just smiled, clearly pleased with himself, not stopping smearing bread with butter even for a second.</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cYou mad?\u201d</p><p>Steve didn\u2019t answer. He was on the couch, in the exact spot S2 was minutes ago. He was hunched, elbows resting on his knees, one hand on top of the other, and he put his chin on them, lips thinned. Stubborn eyes. </p><p>S2 took another bite out of his sandwich, chewing slowly. He didn\u2019t feel remorseful at all.</p><p>\u201cIf you stop brooding, I will give you the rest of my sandwich.\u201d</p><p>No reaction. Maybe even the frown on Steve\u2019s face got bigger. Was S2 offering him leftovers?</p><p>\u201cUgh. You want to see what I sketched?\u201d </p><p>That got S1\u2019s attention. He finally looked at the other him. </p><p>S2 smiled softly. He pushed the rest of the sandwich in his mouth and sat next to Steve, opening his sketchbook. After he swallowed the sandwich, he went through the pages, explaining what he drew and why sharing his memories with Steve.</p><p>And it was sweet again.</p><p>***</p><p>Not so sweet when lunchtime came. Steve and Tony were already in the kitchen, setting the table for four, reheating some leftover Chinese food from last day. Steve put some freshly made rice on the table, intended to go with sweet and sour pork and lemon chicken and some leftover spring rolls no one had room left for, when the other couple entered the kitchen, T2, a little ruffled and dazed and smiling sweetly, having experienced a very nice wake up from his long nap, S2 smiling proud and following his boyfriend.</p><p>\u201cTwo out of three,\u201d S2 said to Steve, grabbing a spring roll and biting into it.</p><p>Steve scoffed, the scoff going unnoticed when Tonys started to chatter with each other. </p><p>If S2 wanted to be an asshole again, S1 won\u2019t make it easy for him.</p><p>***</p><p>It happened sooner than Steve thought. After lunch, Steve stayed in the kitchen, scrubbing the dishes. Minutes later, S2 came back, standing behind Steve and pressing into him.</p><p>S1 paused his work. He rearranged his grasp on the sponge and let S2\u2019s hands travel along his body, caressing his torso.</p><p>\u201cGoing for three out of three?\u201d S1 asked, pretending to be interested. He felt S2\u2019s grin pressed to his neck. Hook, line, and sinker. </p><p>\u201cYou know it.\u201d</p><p>Steve hummed. He turned around in S2\u2019s arm and looked deep into his eyes. \u201cNot gonna happen,\u201d he said strongly, pushing the sponge into S2\u2019s chest, leaving a wet mark on his shirt. \u201cFinish washing the dishes.\u201d</p><p>Stunned, S2 opened his mouth, watching Steve walking away, a pleased smile on his lips. Huh. How the roles reversed.</p><p>\u201cYou are killing my vibe, S1!\u201d S2 called, but obediently dipped his hands in the water and resumed the choir.</p><p>S1 only kept smiling, considering it a win. If S2 wanted it, he would make him work for it.</p><p>***</p><p>The game of cat and mouse lasted for the rest of the day. S2 tried to surprise S1 any occasion he got, and S1 always managed to wriggle away, finding himself something more urgent to do instead. The epitome of pathetic make out attempts was reached when late evening Steve walked out of the shower and into the bedroom, a towel on his hips and another one wiping his hair dry and saw S2 spread on the top of the covers. One of his hands was behind his head, the other one laid down casually along his side, one knee bent. Completely naked. Honestly, the only thing that was missing was a rose between his teeth. </p><p>\u201cSeriously, dude?\u201d Steve asked, eyeing the other him in disbelief. The asshole could be stubborn. </p><p>\u201cYou know you want me,\u201d S2 said in a sultry whisper.</p><p>\u201cYou know I could just go back to the bathroom and jerk myself off while looking in the mirror, that would be like making out with you.\u201d</p><p>S2 grimaced. That was something he didn\u2019t think of before. \u201cOh, come on, man!\u201d he whined, losing his cool and making S1 giggle. \u201cDon\u2019t be mean!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMean?\u201d S1 continued to giggle. \u201cWhy do you want this anyway? You already had both Tonys.\u201d</p><p>S2 zipped his mouth. There was an answer to it, but he was not keen on sharing. Steve felt that maybe it was more serious than he initially assumed and sat down on the bed, next to S2\u2019s legs.</p><p>\u201cCome on. Tell me,\u201d Steve asked, no snark, no irony, just kindness.</p><p>S2 dropped his head, feeling that it was time for honesty hour. \u201cI just need to feel on top again,\u201d he mumbled his answer out. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Steve asked in disbelief, while S2 stubbornly avoided his gaze. \u201cWhat does that even mean- oh. Is it because of what happened yesterday?\u201d </p><p>S2\u2019s head got even lower and he whimpered something, clearly embarrassed. Of course, he had fun with his Tony. He loved seeing his boyfriend\u2019s smiling face and the love-filled look when Steve gave himself over. Just letting go of control was not easy for him. He needed to feel in control again.</p><p>Steve tried to hold back a smile. It wasn\u2019t a mean one, but a fond one, while he thought how unreasonable the other he was. Then again, he could imagine what it was so hard for the other him to drop his male alpha act. </p><p>\u201cAlright. Three out of three,\u201d Steve agreed, tossing the towels aside, deciding to let the other him have this win. S2 perked up at that. \u201cBut only because you are stupid and you look cute while being stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will take that,\u201d S2 nodded, watching S1 climbing over him until their bodies aligned. The kiss was slow and gentle, filling them both with a sweet, soothing feeling. </p><p>\u201cYou still didn\u2019t tell me if you ever slept with a woman,\u201d S2 reminded into the kiss.</p><p>Instead of feeling offended, S1 smiled. His counterpart shared two secrets with him today and Steve felt a lot closer to him, finally witnessing the more vulnerable side, S2 was so desperate to hide away from everyone. S1 still called the other him an asshole in his mind, but it was a lot fonder and warm than earlier today.</p><p>\u201cIf you make as limp and dazed as Tonys, I will tell you,\u201d Steve bargained in a honeyed voice.</p><p>A smile spread over S2\u2019s lips. Real and honest. Beautiful.</p><p>\u201cCan do, doll,\u201d S2 took Steve by the shoulders and reversed their positions, getting Steve on his back, while he hovered above him, before sinking down.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p><a href=\"https://lemonsandstrawberries.tumblr.com/post/183754975479/double-trouble-reunion-part-11\">&lt;\u2013</a> previous part // next part \u2014&gt; tbc</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>while you\u2019re here, remember to read a bonus <b>DTR chapter</b> - <i><a href=\"https://lemonsandstrawberries.tumblr.com/post/184996312324/double-trouble-reunion-the-ending-that-wont\">The Ending that won\u2019t happen</a></i> - what would happen if Thanos showed in <b>DTR</b> world? here is your answer!\u00a0</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-<br></p><p><b>OPENING A TAG LIST FOR DTR!</b> If you want to be noted about updates for this series, leave a comment below or send me an ask!</p><p><b>tag list</b></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPJVwxDeaQzxOgOZH4jTZ3w\">@princess-evans-addict</a> , @<a href=\"http://ticklishwallflower.tumblr.com/\">ticklishwallflower</a>,</p>",

The sound of pneumatic hammers breaking every concrete wall, smooth sound of a laser cutting through every surface, loud raving up of an engine, all coupled with heavy and energizing notes of rock music blasting in the background. It was his everyday bread, something he lived in and was an inherent part of his everyday routine, just like a cup of coffee every morning. While most people would find it unpleasant, it was one of the sweetest music for Tony. Not being bothered by loud, ongoing sounds was a useful skill and definitely helped Tony to sleep through the nights when Steve, with circled eyes and head lolling forward, stumbled into their shared bed after particularly exhausting days and snored for twelve hours, resembling a chainsaw. Tony could sleep happily through it, cuddled to his soldier and wake up refreshed.</p><p>Just not when it was two super soldiers snoring.</p><p>Just no.</p><p>Tony shut his eyes tight when it began all over again. Sometimes it was one Steve snoring, and the other started, just when the first ended. Sometimes it was them both, taking turns, as if in some very bad band. The worst was when they got gradually louder, up to a point when it all died down, just to start minutes later.</p><p>Tony didn&rsquo;t get a lot of sleep, waking up every hour or so, trying to shut his Steve&rsquo;s mouth from time to time, but it just fell open almost right away.</p><p>Some part of him felt proud that he and T2 managed to tire their boyfriends out the day before during the joined tickle session, but the other part of him told him to get a gag and use it on both blonds because he needed his damn sleep.</p><p>And T2 seemed to sleep through all of this. Lucky bastard. Or at least it was what Tony thought.</p><p>Tony groaned, hearing another snore rumble in Steve&rsquo;s chest before it left his mouth. He just wanted to sleep and use his boyfriend&rsquo;s peck as a pillow was that too much to ask? In a quick move, he lifted himself up and looked angrily at his boyfriend, his irritation level rising when he noticed that it was getting bright outside and he painfully felt the consequences of being awake for almost the whole night. And snore. A loud one. Tony put his hand under Steve&rsquo;s chin and shut his mouth. As usual, it worked for about ten seconds before his mouth opened and the snoring started anew. What was worse, S2 started to snore too, almost as if it was a competition between both blonds who could snore louder. Usually, Tony found the competitiveness between two Captain Americas amusing, but right now, there was nothing endearing about this situation.</p><p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t work, huh?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony winced in surprise, before he looked to the middle of the bed, eyebrows creasing. T2, acting as a small spoon to S2, was wide awake, his eyes red and tired and he kept smiling weakly at his counterpart. Tony felt tired himself, but he liked to think that he looked less chewed out than T2 did.</p><p>&ldquo;They woke you up too?&rdquo; Tony asked in a whisper, wriggling back into the covers. Feeling him back, Steve immediately wrapped arms again around his torso and buried his face into Tony&rsquo;s shoulder. If he started drooling on him, Tony would have no problems with pushing Steve out of the bed. And it still was the nice option. </p><p>&ldquo;Ugh, I don&rsquo;t think I slept at all,&rdquo; T2 admitted in a pained voice, closing his eyes tight, &ldquo;you make a lot of ruckus too you know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, what?&rdquo; Tony asked back. He remembered seeing T2 perfectly still the whole night, not flinching even once or giving any other signs of being awake.</p><p>&ldquo;Each time you moved to quiet one of them, you made me awake all over again. Also, you snore too,&rdquo; T2 said, opening his eyes and jutting his lower lip forward.</p><p>&ldquo;You snore too!&rdquo; Tony argued back, clearly in self-defense. </p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be as bad as this one,&rdquo; T2 said through a yawn, pointing with his head to his Steve. &ldquo;Or that one,&rdquo; he continued, meaning the other Steve.</p><p>Tony mellowed down. He and T2 were on the same page here. And somewhere deep, deep down he did feel a bit bad for keeping the other him awake.</p><p>&ldquo;You know, I would still take his snoring in favor of the other sound that comes from him during the night,&rdquo; Tony said, trying to lighten up the mood.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; T2 asked, his face showing some interest.</p><p>&ldquo;I mean that when the evening earlier he binges on ice cream or pizza with double cheese,&rdquo; Tony explained, trying to keep his smile to minimum and voice neutral, while he watched the spreading glee on T2&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;No amount of scented candles can help. I think I would be even scared to light up a match near him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Noooo,&rdquo; T2 whined, voice cracking with laughter.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Tony nodded, finally smiling, &ldquo;I swear, one night our covers didn&rsquo;t even touch the bed, they just kept floating in the air.&rdquo;</p><p>T2 buried his face in the pillow, shoulders shaking with laughter. Tony gave him a minute, just enjoying seeing the other him giggling away. It was a cute sight. </p><p>&ldquo;I am glad mine has a nuts allergy, it just makes his tongue bigger,&rdquo; T2 said after his giggling fit was over. Then his smiling face changed into a more mischievous one. &ldquo;Actually, sometimes we use it to our advantage.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Now you are just bragging,&rdquo; Tony narrowed his eyes, and T2 laughed happily. He stopped laughing, when more rumbling snores filled the room, this time coming from both soldiers.</p><p>&ldquo;I guess we are getting up?&rdquo; T2 asked while Tony was busy rolling his eyes at the soldier glued to his back.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. Let them go deaf alone,&rdquo; Tony said, gently moving Steve&rsquo;s hands and wriggling himself out from the covers and making a wobbly way out of the bed, trying not to step on anyone. </p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that,&rdquo; T2 cooed, untangling himself from his Steve&rsquo;s hold. He yelped softly when a hand grabbed his ankle and T1 pulled on it, dragging him all the way down the mattress until he reached the end of the bed and a good portion of his legs was out.</p><p>&ldquo;I kinda mean that,&rdquo; Tony said, lack of sleep making him cranky. He lifted the covers up and saw T2&rsquo;s smiling and amused face. T2 liked to be manhandled a bit too much, but Tony could understand that just as much enjoying manhandling the other him.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go, before I lose my hearing,&rdquo; Tony urged when snoring became louder, and he pulled T2 up and to himself.</p><p>&ldquo;Breakfast?&rdquo; T2 asked hopefully, grabbing some basic clothes for him and T1 on their way out.</p><p>&ldquo;Coffee. Lots,&rdquo; Tony groaned, tilting his head back. &ldquo;And I have no strength to cook. We will do what we always do on days like this.&rdquo;</p><p>T2 giggled, handing T1 a tank top and sweat pants. &ldquo;Order food and push it as our cooking?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shhh!&rdquo; T1 quieted the other him, shooting a quick glance at their, hopefully, sleeping boyfriends. There was a limited number of times they could impress Steves with unburnt omelets and poached eggs on toast. Seemed that their secret would remain safe, judging on the ongoing snoring. </p><p>&ldquo;Coffee?&rdquo; T2 reminded.</p><p>&ldquo;Coffee,&rdquo; Tony nodded and they both walked out of the bedroom. </p><p>***</p><p>Three refills of coffee and one waffle delivery later, Steves walked into the kitchen, looking fresh and chipper.</p><p>&ldquo;Morning, honey,&rdquo; Steve said warmly, kissing Tony&rsquo;s cheek for hello. Tony grumbled his greeting back, still sucked to a coffee cup, letting caffeine fuel him. </p><p>&ldquo;Morning,&rdquo; S2 smiled at his Tony and went to him first, T2 already putting his cheek out for his kiss and smiling back, because he was the yin to Tony&rsquo;s yang. &ldquo;Breakfast smells great,&rdquo; he said, smelling warm waffles and butter and syrup.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not breakfast, that&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; T2 flirted with a charming smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Um, Tony&hellip;&rdquo; Steve said insecurely, noticing the almost empty bag of coffee on the counter and the overpowering aroma of coffee in the air. &ldquo;I think you should slow down.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony growled from behind his cup. He would need a nap later for sure. Seeing T2 and S2 cooing to each other was not helping him either. </p><p>&ldquo;He is cranky because he didn&rsquo;t get a lot of sleep today!&rdquo; T2 explained before Steve could ask what already ruined his boyfriend mood. &ldquo;You two had a snoring contest.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Steve grimaced, watching Tony&rsquo;s grumpy face. &ldquo;Why- why didn&rsquo;t you go to the second bedroom?&rdquo; he asked. Seemed logical to him.</p><p>Tony put the empty cup away from his lips. He looked Steve straight in the eyes, huffing a bit, looking agitated. &ldquo;Because you are warm.&rdquo; </p><p>Steve waited for something to follow. Nothing did, as if that explanation should be enough. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Steve said because no better thing came to his mind. Well, that was almost flattering. Taking advantage of the silent moment, S2 slipped in between them and gave Tony a good morning kiss, quickly moving away. Of course, on the lips, as Tony turned his head to match S2&rsquo;s. How come Tony seemed more angry at him than S2? That reminded him that he better hurry up and give a good morning kiss to the other Tony or he would just end with both Tonys being angry, but if he would walk away now, it would just make his Tony angrier and there was no good solution here. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I - I promise to not snore ever again?&rdquo; Steve said, clearly not believing his own words. He just panicked and said the first thing he thought that could amend the situation.</p><p>Tony eyed him for a bit longer, before his chest jumped with a huff of laughter, his shoulders relaxing and not so tight anymore. He put the cup away and used his free hand to put at the back of Steve&rsquo;s neck, urging him closer and stood on his toes, nuzzling into Steve&rsquo;s face, his nose tracing soldier&rsquo;s cheek in a tender move before he rubbed their noses together for few seconds. When they drew apart, Tony&rsquo;s gaze was soft and he looked less tense. </p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s eat while it is still warm,&rdquo; Tony decided, walking around his Steve and joining the other couple at the table. </p><p>Well, that went surprisingly easy. Usually Tony liked to make things more dramatic. Maybe he had just the right amount of coffee to mellow down. Steve turned around and joined the breakfast chaos, and he caught Tony&rsquo;s love filled gaze on him, just as if Steve was something very precious. And Steve smiled, taking Tony&rsquo;s hand in his and thinking the exact same thing about Tony. </p><p>***</p><p>Hours later, Tony was stumbling down the corridor, his head dropping down. The lack of sleep was catching up on him, and he desperately needed a nap. A short, power nap. He had a full right to a nap after the poor quality sleep he got the last night. </p><p>&ldquo;Ack!&rdquo; Tony yelped in protest when he was tackled against the wall before he could reach the bedroom. He opened his mouth to voice his protest out, but a warm palm pressed to his mouth, silencing him.</p><p>&ldquo;Shhh. Don&rsquo;t say a word.&rdquo;</p><p>A very nice shudder ran through Tony&rsquo;s body at the low, husked out voice whispering in his ear. He felt a muscled body pressing into his back, towering over him and hips grinding into his ass. Seemed that Steve came to make up for the awful night he had caused. It wasn&rsquo;t needed, but very welcomed, and Tony would happily let himself be carried to the bedroom for some private time.</p><p>&ldquo;Hands on the wall.&rdquo;</p><p>Oh. That was new. Suddenly all the sleep was gone. Steve wanted to make out here? Here in the middle of the corridor, where T2 or S2 could stumble on them any second?</p><p>&ldquo;Do it.&rdquo; </p><p>It was not a request. Feeling hot all over, Tony pressed both palms to the cool wall, keeping his arms outstretched. It was almost as if he was a criminal and Steve was a policeman, ready to pat him down. Well, that was a nice scenario for a role play. </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony nodded. Steve&rsquo;s hand was still firmly pressed to his mouth and it was getting a whole lot exciting.</p><p>&ldquo;And stay quiet. You don&rsquo;t want anyone walking on us, do you?&rdquo;</p><p>A whole, whole lot exciting. When moist, plumps lips touched his ear and moved all the way down, grazing his neck in a delicate pattern, Tony moved his head back, a small whimper escaping him, muffled by the hand. Little, playful nip on his collarbone and Tony rolled his bitten arm.</p><p>&ldquo;Shh.&rdquo;</p><p>One big hand cupped his jawline, palm sliding down, brushing his neck firmly and making his breath short for a while. Tony didn&rsquo;t mind a little rough play. Down the middle of his chest, the touch becoming lighter at the scar the arc reactor left and Tony was really grateful for that. He didn&rsquo;t need a panic attack setting in. Not when it was getting so good, and Steve caressed his stomach, pressing on the skin under his hand and moved all the way down, stopping at the edge of his tank top and sliding easily into his pants. It was common knowledge that on his free days, Tony liked to go commando and Steve didn&rsquo;t pause for a second feeling bare, heated skin, already expecting that. Fingers pressing into his lower belly, curling into the soft skin and Tony snapped his head up, some involuntary giggle escaping, barely hearable as Steve kept his hand stubbornly pressed to his lips. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, this is a sensitive spot, right?&rdquo;</p><p>More whispering and four fingers kept gently digging into the soft spot, slowly and teasingly. Tony giggled more, shaking his head and curling in himself slightly, his hands sliding a bit down on the wall. Steve pressed his hips firmer into Tony&rsquo;s, helping him to stay upright. </p><p>&ldquo;I would use both hands, but you will just disobey me and make a lot of noise, wouldn&rsquo;t you? You can be a very loud one.&rdquo;</p><p>As to confirm his words, Steve dug his fingertips into the soft lower belly and squeezed the skin repeatedly. Tony jumped, more muffled laughter and breath coming out in short, hot waves. His arms startled to tremble with effort of keeping them in place. A wet kiss on his neck, probably a reward for not moving during the short tickle attack.</p><p>&ldquo;Fortunately, one hand is enough for what I have planned.&rdquo;</p><p>The hand splayed on his lower belly, covering more skin, and Tony&rsquo;s breath stopped in anticipation. South or north. Both options sounded equally lovely. Both made him feel incredibly nervous and giddy. </p><p>When Steve decided on his direction, Tony rolled his stomach, following the movement.</p><p>North.</p><p>Oh boy. </p><p>The hand stopped under his shirt, pressing into the middle of his stomach, his belly button directly under the middle of the palm. Tony couldn&rsquo;t help, and whimpered, feeling that he was in trouble. </p><p>&ldquo;You will enjoy this.&rdquo;</p><p>The touch lightened and a finger pressed directly on his outie, already sending an electric like feeling through his whole body. A gentle pressure, pushing on the ticklish spot and Tony started to giggle frantically, his whole body shivering and becoming heated.</p><p>&ldquo;Or more of, I will enjoy this.&rdquo;</p><p>Of course. </p><p>Everything got blocked out. Tony felt only the light tickle on his outie, his mind reading the feeling as devastating and making his whole body numb, as he continued to laugh, the sound coming out as choked and snorted, obscured by the hand on his lips. He didn&rsquo;t care how ridiculous he sounded, not when the finger on his outie was driving him insane, lightly touching and rubbing, never leaving or stopping, despite the constant hips rocking Tony did, almost as if dancing. Then two fingers, rubbing the small nub in circular motions. It tickled so, so intense, but then another feeling joined. Hot and dizzying, bunching up all his nerves. </p><p>&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; Steve whispered, always in awe how proper stimulation on Tony&rsquo;s outie could both tickle and make him aroused. &ldquo;You are amazing, you know that?&rdquo; Steve whispered with love, continuing the touch, feeling the breathed out giggles and moans on his palm, and almost making Tony&rsquo;s knees buckle. </p><p>When Steve pinched delicately the small nub between his fingers, Tony almost exploded with laughter. When he used his fingers to rub the very sides of the outie, Tony continued to shrill in laughter and tried to suck his belly in. All this was accompanied by the hot, tingling feeling spreading all over his limbs. His hands were slowly giving up and he didn&rsquo;t have enough of will power to keep them on the wall anymore, but he didn&rsquo;t want to stop their play either, so he came up with a different plan. Using the wall as leverage, Tony pushed himself away, bumping his back into Steve&rsquo;s chest and falling with all his weight on him, he raised his arms up and threw over Steve&rsquo;s neck, fingers intertwining on the nape to help himself stay in place. Steve, a little shocked at first, felt a loving, serene feeling taking over him, with Tony being so open and presenting himself to him. That truly was something special. He won&rsquo;t waste this opportunity.</p><p>Steve rolled Tony&rsquo;s shirt up to his chest and used his knuckles to brush over the quivering stomach, up from the ribs, ending on the pant line. Five fingers drawing horizontal lines over the middle, often catching on the belly button, brushing it over and over again. Tony&rsquo;s arms and legs felt limp, but his torso was straight and skin tight as a drum, belly forming a gentle slope, Steve&rsquo;s fingers were following. Somehow during his wiggling, Steve&rsquo;s hand slid down from his lips and stopped only on the lower lip and Tony could laugh properly. It was short-lived when strong fingers poked softly into his mouth, &nbsp;two fingers placed on his lower teeth. Tony bit gently on them, understanding that he was still supposed to be quiet, but it was becoming so good and so hot, his breath coming out in short waves and giggles mixing with delighted, short moans. </p><p>A thumb pressed strongly to his belly button and pushed, rubbing on the little numb, and Tony&rsquo;s eyes rolled to the back in delight, all his nerves lighting up with a shimmering, ticklish feeling. Huh. That was new for both of them and Steve was pleasantly surprised with the reaction before he got back to more traditional techniques. Some more circles rubbed directly on his outie, and Tony felt the hot feeling growing in him and stirring his insides, a delightful ringing in his ears becoming louder and louder until he snapped his hips forward and his vision darkened at the edges as he moaned and laughed and came. </p><p>The hold around Steve&rsquo;s neck loosened. Steve moved both of his hands to held Tony under his arms, feeling that his boyfriend was slipping to the floor, exhausted and limbless. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, easy now.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve was gentle and spoke in a soothing voice, turning Tony around, their chests pressing together. The sight almost knocked the breath out of him. Tony was flushed and panting, his eyes sparkling with post orgasm bliss. What made Steve&rsquo;s blood flow faster was that when Tony looked up at him, eyes bright and mouth slightly opened, he saw that Tony wasn&rsquo;t as exhausted as Steve assumed he was. No, he clearly wanted more. Tony surged up, pressing their lips together in a needy, deep kiss, climbing on Steve and entangling fingers into blonde hair, one leg already hooked around soldier&rsquo;s hip, his whole body pushing into him, silently asking to be lifted up and carried somewhere more private. Or even here, Tony didn&rsquo;t care, as long as he would get more of that.</p><p>&ldquo;Ummm&hellip; What&rsquo;s going on here?&rdquo;</p><p>Steve broke the kiss, hearing the other him behind his back. He looked to the back, admittedly looking startled for a second. Tony looked too, thinking that good that S2 showed up because he wanted to be in a threesome with both Steves for a long, long time and maybe it was the right moment to propose that when-</p><p>It was his Steve. The one with the stunned, shocked expression on his face, standing in the corridor. </p><p>Tony blinked and took a proper look at the Steve he basically had climbed over and got lost in his arms. It was S2. </p><p>Oh, that was a bit awkward. Just a bit. </p><p>Before anything else could happen, S2 grinned that smug, practiced smile, scooping Tony up and walking to Steve. </p><p>&ldquo;Here, I warmed him up for you,&rdquo; he winked and handed Tony over to other him and Tony clung to his soldier. </p><p>&ldquo;The heck-&rdquo; Steve protested, but still held Tony close, his voice lost when he saw how flushed and bothered Tony looked. </p><p>&ldquo;One out of three,&rdquo; S2 said proudly and walked away, smug and pleased with himself.</p><p>&ldquo;Where are you -&rdquo; Steve didn&rsquo;t finish, noticing S2 walking into the bedroom they all shared. And he was pretty sure that earlier today, T2 had collapsed in bed, claiming that he was too tired and needed to get some sleep.</p><p>&ldquo;Steve.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve looked back at Tony. At his heated cheeks, half-lidded, glazed eyes. He was clinging to him and Steve felt the short breath and rapidly beating heart. Tony pushed on Steve, urging him and Steve was a weak, weak man. </p><p>Just like S2 earlier, he scooped Tony up and carried away into the bedroom not occupied by the other couple, and Tony laughed in delight, already kissing and gently biting on Steve&rsquo;s ear to get him faster in the mood. </p><p>Some things could wait.</p><p>***</p><p>&ldquo;How did you do that?&rdquo;</p><p>S2 shut his sketchbook close. He turned his head to the side, eyes meeting with S1, who was leaning over the couch back, looking down at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Did what?&rdquo; S2 asked, tapping fingers on the hardcover. He was getting in the zone when he had to be interrupted.</p><p>&ldquo;You know what,&rdquo; Steve replied, sounding somehow irritated. And not only because he clearly saw the other him sketching not his nr 1 boyfriend. </p><p>There it was. That sly, self-pleased grin showing on S2&rsquo;s face. Steve already felt tense.</p><p>&ldquo;You mean how I made your boyfriend climb you like a tree?&rdquo;</p><p>Steve could reply something snarky. Something very ironic and full of sarcasm, just to shut the other him up. He was fully capable of that. Just, curiosity won over.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Steve admitted with a sigh, dropping his fight stance, &ldquo;that.&rdquo;</p><p>After S1&rsquo;s confession, S2 changed his tone too, his smile dimming into a nicer, gentler one. Even more genuine than his practiced smirk. Steve liked that smile more.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, before I answer that, let me ask you a very fair question,&rdquo; S2 said, and S1 nodded, giving him permission, &ldquo;have you ever slept with a woman?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;WHAT?!&rdquo; Steve burst out, feeling his cheeks burning. S2 was looking back at him, no snark in his posture or voice, just waiting for the answer. And Steve felt very hot under his collar. Okay, he felt a lot closer to S2 since he got here, but such information was not something he was ready to share yet. Some things were supposed to stay only between him and his Tony. </p><p>&ldquo;What it has to do with anything, anyway?&rdquo; Steve asked, nervously tugging on the neckline of his shirt.</p><p>S2 looked at him with pity. S1 didn&rsquo;t intend to correct him. Let the asshole think what he wanted. Oh, he was calling S2 an asshole again. That didn&rsquo;t happen for a while.</p><p>&ldquo;I am gonna leave you with this,&rdquo; S2 said, standing up and tucking his sketchbook under his arm, &ldquo;think what women have and what Tony has.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve&rsquo;s forehead creased in confusion. That didn&rsquo;t make any sense. He watched S2 walk away in the kitchen direction. Well, that wasn&rsquo;t helpful at all and felt like a waste of time. He should know that S2 won&rsquo;t give him a clear answer.</p><p>And then it hit him. His face exploded with a whole new shade of red, one that should be named after him.</p><p>&ldquo;S2!&rdquo;</p><p>At the outraged scream coming from the living room, S2 just smiled, clearly pleased with himself, not stopping smearing bread with butter even for a second.</p><p>***</p><p>&ldquo;You mad?&rdquo;</p><p>Steve didn&rsquo;t answer. He was on the couch, in the exact spot S2 was minutes ago. He was hunched, elbows resting on his knees, one hand on top of the other, and he put his chin on them, lips thinned. Stubborn eyes. </p><p>S2 took another bite out of his sandwich, chewing slowly. He didn&rsquo;t feel remorseful at all.</p><p>&ldquo;If you stop brooding, I will give you the rest of my sandwich.&rdquo;</p><p>No reaction. Maybe even the frown on Steve&rsquo;s face got bigger. Was S2 offering him leftovers?</p><p>&ldquo;Ugh. You want to see what I sketched?&rdquo; </p><p>That got S1&rsquo;s attention. He finally looked at the other him. </p><p>S2 smiled softly. He pushed the rest of the sandwich in his mouth and sat next to Steve, opening his sketchbook. After he swallowed the sandwich, he went through the pages, explaining what he drew and why sharing his memories with Steve.</p><p>And it was sweet again.</p><p>***</p><p>Not so sweet when lunchtime came. Steve and Tony were already in the kitchen, setting the table for four, reheating some leftover Chinese food from last day. Steve put some freshly made rice on the table, intended to go with sweet and sour pork and lemon chicken and some leftover spring rolls no one had room left for, when the other couple entered the kitchen, T2, a little ruffled and dazed and smiling sweetly, having experienced a very nice wake up from his long nap, S2 smiling proud and following his boyfriend.</p><p>&ldquo;Two out of three,&rdquo; S2 said to Steve, grabbing a spring roll and biting into it.</p><p>Steve scoffed, the scoff going unnoticed when Tonys started to chatter with each other. </p><p>If S2 wanted to be an asshole again, S1 won&rsquo;t make it easy for him.</p><p>***</p><p>It happened sooner than Steve thought. After lunch, Steve stayed in the kitchen, scrubbing the dishes. Minutes later, S2 came back, standing behind Steve and pressing into him.</p><p>S1 paused his work. He rearranged his grasp on the sponge and let S2&rsquo;s hands travel along his body, caressing his torso.</p><p>&ldquo;Going for three out of three?&rdquo; S1 asked, pretending to be interested. He felt S2&rsquo;s grin pressed to his neck. Hook, line, and sinker. </p><p>&ldquo;You know it.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve hummed. He turned around in S2&rsquo;s arm and looked deep into his eyes. &ldquo;Not gonna happen,&rdquo; he said strongly, pushing the sponge into S2&rsquo;s chest, leaving a wet mark on his shirt. &ldquo;Finish washing the dishes.&rdquo;</p><p>Stunned, S2 opened his mouth, watching Steve walking away, a pleased smile on his lips. Huh. How the roles reversed.</p><p>&ldquo;You are killing my vibe, S1!&rdquo; S2 called, but obediently dipped his hands in the water and resumed the choir.</p><p>S1 only kept smiling, considering it a win. If S2 wanted it, he would make him work for it.</p><p>***</p><p>The game of cat and mouse lasted for the rest of the day. S2 tried to surprise S1 any occasion he got, and S1 always managed to wriggle away, finding himself something more urgent to do instead. The epitome of pathetic make out attempts was reached when late evening Steve walked out of the shower and into the bedroom, a towel on his hips and another one wiping his hair dry and saw S2 spread on the top of the covers. One of his hands was behind his head, the other one laid down casually along his side, one knee bent. Completely naked. Honestly, the only thing that was missing was a rose between his teeth. </p><p>&ldquo;Seriously, dude?&rdquo; Steve asked, eyeing the other him in disbelief. The asshole could be stubborn. </p><p>&ldquo;You know you want me,&rdquo; S2 said in a sultry whisper.</p><p>&ldquo;You know I could just go back to the bathroom and jerk myself off while looking in the mirror, that would be like making out with you.&rdquo;</p><p>S2 grimaced. That was something he didn&rsquo;t think of before. &ldquo;Oh, come on, man!&rdquo; he whined, losing his cool and making S1 giggle. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be mean!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mean?&rdquo; S1 continued to giggle. &ldquo;Why do you want this anyway? You already had both Tonys.&rdquo;</p><p>S2 zipped his mouth. There was an answer to it, but he was not keen on sharing. Steve felt that maybe it was more serious than he initially assumed and sat down on the bed, next to S2&rsquo;s legs.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on. Tell me,&rdquo; Steve asked, no snark, no irony, just kindness.</p><p>S2 dropped his head, feeling that it was time for honesty hour. &ldquo;I just need to feel on top again,&rdquo; he mumbled his answer out. </p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Steve asked in disbelief, while S2 stubbornly avoided his gaze. &ldquo;What does that even mean- oh. Is it because of what happened yesterday?&rdquo; </p><p>S2&rsquo;s head got even lower and he whimpered something, clearly embarrassed. Of course, he had fun with his Tony. He loved seeing his boyfriend&rsquo;s smiling face and the love-filled look when Steve gave himself over. Just letting go of control was not easy for him. He needed to feel in control again.</p><p>Steve tried to hold back a smile. It wasn&rsquo;t a mean one, but a fond one, while he thought how unreasonable the other he was. Then again, he could imagine what it was so hard for the other him to drop his male alpha act. </p><p>&ldquo;Alright. Three out of three,&rdquo; Steve agreed, tossing the towels aside, deciding to let the other him have this win. S2 perked up at that. &ldquo;But only because you are stupid and you look cute while being stupid.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will take that,&rdquo; S2 nodded, watching S1 climbing over him until their bodies aligned. The kiss was slow and gentle, filling them both with a sweet, soothing feeling. </p><p>&ldquo;You still didn&rsquo;t tell me if you ever slept with a woman,&rdquo; S2 reminded into the kiss.</p><p>Instead of feeling offended, S1 smiled. His counterpart shared two secrets with him today and Steve felt a lot closer to him, finally witnessing the more vulnerable side, S2 was so desperate to hide away from everyone. S1 still called the other him an asshole in his mind, but it was a lot fonder and warm than earlier today.</p><p>&ldquo;If you make as limp and dazed as Tonys, I will tell you,&rdquo; Steve bargained in a honeyed voice.</p><p>A smile spread over S2&rsquo;s lips. Real and honest. Beautiful.</p><p>&ldquo;Can do, doll,&rdquo; S2 took Steve by the shoulders and reversed their positions, getting Steve on his back, while he hovered above him, before sinking down.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p><a href=\"https://lemonsandstrawberries.tumblr.com/post/183754975479/double-trouble-reunion-part-11\">&lt;&ndash;</a> previous part // next part &mdash;&gt; tbc</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>while you&rsquo;re here, remember to read a bonus <b>DTR chapter</b> - <i><a href=\"https://lemonsandstrawberries.tumblr.com/post/184996312324/double-trouble-reunion-the-ending-that-wont\">The Ending that won&rsquo;t happen</a></i> - what would happen if Thanos showed in <b>DTR</b> world? here is your answer!&nbsp;</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-<br /></p><p><b>OPENING A TAG LIST FOR DTR!</b> If you want to be noted about updates for this series, leave a comment below or send me an ask!</p><p><b>tag list</b></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPJVwxDeaQzxOgOZH4jTZ3w\">@princess-evans-addict</a> , @<a href=\"http://ticklishwallflower.tumblr.com/\">ticklishwallflower</a>,</p>",

The sound of pneumatic hammers breaking every concrete wall, smooth sound of a laser cutting through every surface, loud raving up of an engine, all coupled with heavy and energizing notes of rock music blasting in the background. It was his everyday bread, something he lived in and was an inherent part of his everyday routine, just like a cup of coffee every morning. While most people would find it unpleasant, it was one of the sweetest music for Tony. Not being bothered by loud, ongoing sounds was a useful skill and definitely helped Tony to sleep through the nights when Steve, with circled eyes and head lolling forward, stumbled into their shared bed after particularly exhausting days and snored for twelve hours, resembling a chainsaw. Tony could sleep happily through it, cuddled to his soldier and wake up refreshed.</p>\n<p>Just not when it was two super soldiers snoring.</p>\n<p>Just no.</p>\n</p>",
