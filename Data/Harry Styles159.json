I wear plain black running pants and the treat people with kindness shirt I bought at the show. I tie up my sneakers and head down to the lobby. Harry&rsquo;s car pulls up at exactly 9, and he gets out. We hug to greet each other.</p><p>&ldquo;Nice <g class=\"gr_ gr_451 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"451\" data-gr-id=\"451\">shirt</g>&rdquo; he says as we pull away and opens the car door for me.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank <g class=\"gr_ gr_480 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"480\" data-gr-id=\"480\">you</g>&rdquo; I say hopping in, he gets in after me. We get to Mount Takao after about an hours drive. It went quickly as we just chatted about random things. I asked him how his interview went.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, uh it was <g class=\"gr_ gr_496 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"496\" data-gr-id=\"496\">fine</g>&rdquo; he says unsurely, and then quickly changes the subject. That&rsquo;s odd, maybe he doesn&rsquo;t like talking about work. I shrug it off and continue talking. When we get there, we begin to walk up to the top along with many other tourists. It&rsquo;s a really popular place. We walk side by side talking, he tells me about his favorite hiking trails around the world.</p><p>&ldquo;My dad took me on a hike back home in New Zealand, it had about 2000 stairs, but the view was incredible,&rdquo; I tell him.</p><p>&ldquo;You will have to take me there one day,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I might hate stairs but I&rsquo;m a sucker for a good view&rdquo;</p><p>When we get to the top, we manage to find a bench that overlooks the view. We sit down and look around. \u201dThis is beautiful,&ldquo; I say as we both take it in.</p><p>&quot;So when are you leaving Tokyo?&rdquo; he asks me.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure actually. I never booked a return flight, I might stay for a while longer, then train down to Osaka or something like that&rdquo; I <g class=\"gr_ gr_478 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"478\" data-gr-id=\"478\">say</g> looking at him. &ldquo;You must be leaving soon? What is the schedule of &lsquo;Harry Styles&rsquo; looking like?&rdquo; I ask him.</p><p>&ldquo;I actually fly to London tonight. I&rsquo;m there for about a week, then I&rsquo;m off to South America, then America for the last leg of the tour&rdquo; he says.</p><p>&ldquo;Busy then, that&rsquo;s a lot of traveling!&rdquo; I say with a surprised expression on my face.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you think you will be able to handle it?&rdquo; he asks me.</p><p>&ldquo;Whha-&rdquo; I stop mid-sentence to process what he said. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; I say laughing a bit in confusion.</p><p>&ldquo;I want you to come with <g class=\"gr_ gr_483 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"483\" data-gr-id=\"483\">me</g>&rdquo; He says. &ldquo;I was actually thinking about hiring another photographer, then I met you. I also just want an excuse to spend time with you. If you think about it, I&rsquo;m basically hiring you to hang out with me.&rdquo; he says trailing off, looking away. &ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo;</p><p>I stare at him blankly with my mouth open slightly. &ldquo;Harry. Are you sure?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes! I already talked to Jeff, that\u2019s why I left lunch yesterday, I didn&rsquo;t have an interview, we were going over things. I showed him some of your work, and he thinks it&rsquo;s a good idea.&rdquo; He has really thought about this.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, a secure job would be nice&hellip;&rdquo; I start, &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t think it would be the worst thing if I had to hang out with you.&rdquo; I stop to think about it. Am I really about to say yes to going on tour? &ldquo;Sure, why the hell not?&rdquo; I say to him.</p><p>He leans in and passionately kisses me. He then takes my hand and squeezes it. There is a big smile on his face. &ldquo;Amazing!&rdquo; he exclaims.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m flying to Argentina on the 21st, and I figured you wanted to stay here until then, so your flight will be on the same <g class=\"gr_ gr_476 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"476\" data-gr-id=\"476\">day</g>&rdquo; He tells me, and I make sure to listen so I don&rsquo;t miss anything. &ldquo;Claire will also be on your flight, as she&rsquo;s staying in Japan since she has family here&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sounds perfect,&rdquo; I said squeezing his hand back. &ldquo;What time is your flight today?&rdquo; I ask.</p><p>&ldquo;3, it&rsquo;s a long one too. 12 hours&rdquo; he says sighing.</p><p>I make a pained expression &ldquo;Eesh, that is long&rdquo; There&rsquo;s a pause in the conversation, and we both look out at the view. &ldquo;So, what&rsquo;s the job description, I need to know what I&rsquo;m in <g class=\"gr_ gr_456 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"456\" data-gr-id=\"456\">for</g>&rdquo; I ask.</p><p>&ldquo;Uhh well just taking pictures I guess. I post a picture from each show on my Instagram, and we have the HsHq which posts pictures too. So yeah, basically just take pictures of me on stage, the crowd, and the fans always seem to love a good candid backstage shot.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, doesn&rsquo;t sound too hard.&rdquo; He tells me about the places we will be going and how excited he is. We walk back down the mountain and he drops me back at my hotel. I hug him goodbye and wish him a safe flight.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you in Argentina!\u201d he says.</p><p>When I get to my hotel room, I check the dates, today is the 15th, so 6 more days in Tokyo. I get a text on my phone from an unknown number;</p><p><b>\u2018Hey, its Clare, I got your number from Harry, hope you don&rsquo;t mind. Since you are also in Tokyo, do you want to hang out?&rsquo;</b></p><p>I reply <b>'Yes! That would be lovely&rsquo;</b></p><p>I see Clare a few times over the 6 days, she takes me to some 'hidden&rsquo; places which are really cool. On the 21st we meet at the airport to catch our flight to Argentina. I don&rsquo;t end up sitting next to her which is disappointing since it was a long flight. Harry kindly booked me a business class seat, which was really nice of him. When we arrive in Argentina Clare and I get the same taxi to the hotel.</p><p>&quot;In our last 'team&rsquo; meeting Jeff said the fans here are very intense, and to just be prepared&rdquo; She informs me.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; I say, as we pull up to the hotel. There are at least a hundred fans around, they are all anticipating who is arriving. When I step out they all seem disappointed, as they have no idea who I am. When Clare gets out of the car some of them start screaming and ask for pictures. They are all telling her how much they love her. We quickly grab our bags and are ushered by security into the lobby.</p><p>&ldquo;Wow, that was crazy,&rdquo; I say to Clare while looking back at the fans.</p><p>&ldquo;Yep, that definitely was,&rdquo; Clare says taking a sip from her water bottle. We are met by Jeff who helps checks us in.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry only arrived about an hour ago, that&rsquo;s why its pretty crazy out there. Hope you managed okay&rdquo; he says.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah I&rsquo;m fine I just didn&rsquo;t expect it, I&rsquo;m only the girl on keys,&rdquo; Clare says laughing.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay here are your room cards, please find me if anything goes wrong or if you just have any questions,&rdquo; Jeff says to us as we wait for the lift. When it arrives, Jeff walks off waving goodbye.</p><p>We both enter the lift and I get out on level 2. I say goodbye to Clare as her room is on level 3. I roll my suitcase down the hall looking for number 35. After a while I find it. When I open the door, my mouth drops open. This hotel room is beautiful. There is a massive bed, a balcony, and a huge bathroom.</p><p>I put all my bags down and go out onto the balcony. It overlooks the parking lot and entrance to the hotel, there are so many fans crowded around. Some fans look over to me trying to figure out who I am. When they realize I&rsquo;m no one of importance they all look away.</p><p>When I yawn, I look at my phone to see the time. Its 2.42pm, so it would be 2.42am in Japan, no wonder I&rsquo;m tired. I take a photo of the crowd just for memories. I decide to wash my face and change into something more comfortable so I can relax for a while. I lay on my bed and it doesn&rsquo;t take long before I&rsquo;m falling asleep. I awake to a soft knocking on my door. I open the door to see Harry standing there. I semi jump into giving him a hug.&ldquo;Hey&rdquo; he says as we pull away.</p><p>&ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; I ask him.<br/></p><p>&ldquo;I\u2019m good, how was your flight?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Long, I&rsquo;m so tired, just accidentally fell <g class=\"gr_ gr_452 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"452\" data-gr-id=\"452\">asleep</g>&rdquo; I say gesturing to the bed behind me.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh sorry, I didn&rsquo;t mean to wake you&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s okay. Come in, you have to see this balcony!&rdquo; I say opening the doors of the balcony completely forgetting that there are about 100 fans outside. As I opened the door suddenly, all their attention is drawn in my direction. Since my room is only on the second level, they can see very clearly into it. They see Harry and all run over screaming to get his attention and a better view. &ldquo;Shit!&rdquo; I say as I quickly close the door and Harry pulls the curtains. &ldquo;Sorry, I wasn&rsquo;t thinking!&quot;\u00a0</p><p>&quot;It&rsquo;s okay, don&rsquo;t worry about <g class=\"gr_ gr_450 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"450\" data-gr-id=\"450\">it</g>&rdquo; he says sitting down on my bed.</p><p>&ldquo;Woah, that&rsquo;s pretty crazy, how do they even know you&rsquo;re staying here?&rdquo; I open the curtain slightly to see if they are still looking.</p><p>&ldquo;I guess one person sees me, then they tell someone and it kind of carries on, next thing you know its pretty <g class=\"gr_ gr_454 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"454\" data-gr-id=\"454\">chaotic</g>&rdquo; he says.</p><p>&ldquo;It was cute before, they all screamed for Clare when we got out of the car&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah Jeff told me, I love how they love the <g class=\"gr_ gr_460 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"460\" data-gr-id=\"460\">band</g>&rdquo; he says fondly.</p><p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he says scooching up the bed to lean against the headboard. &ldquo;Tell me what you did while I was gone&rdquo; he continues while patting the space next to him.</p><p>I sit down and begin to tell him about what I got up to. He then tells me about London, I&rsquo;m lying down on my side looking up at him. Again I have woken up to a light knocking on the door. I jolt up and I realize I fell asleep while Harry was telling me about some wedding he went to. He walks back from the door with a tray of food and drinks. He carefully places it on the bed. &ldquo;Oh you&rsquo;re <g class=\"gr_ gr_505 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"505\" data-gr-id=\"505\">awake</g>&rdquo; he says with an ounce of surprise in his voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry for falling <g class=\"gr_ gr_453 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"453\" data-gr-id=\"453\">asleep</g>&rdquo; I say softly.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Nice to know I must be really interesting to talk to&rdquo; he laughs.</p><p>&ldquo;No! You&rsquo;re interesting, really interesting, I-I&rsquo;m just really jet-lagged, promise you&rsquo;re not boring&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m only joking, I know you must be really tired. I ordered you some food so you can eat something then go to bed&quot;\u00a0</p><p>&quot;Aw thank you! How long was I asleep for?&rdquo; I question.</p><p>&ldquo;About 45 <g class=\"gr_ gr_467 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"467\" data-gr-id=\"467\">minutes</g>&rdquo; he says checking his watch.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry you could have left you to know. You must have been so bored!&rdquo; I say feeling bad.</p><p>&ldquo;No it was fine, I was just replying to some emails&rdquo; he pauses. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t really know what you would want, so I got you some soup, salad, and fries,&rdquo; he says lifting up the covers over each dish.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, <g class=\"gr_ gr_448 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"448\" data-gr-id=\"448\">Harry</g>&rdquo; I say smiling at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want to put on a movie?&rdquo; he asks turning on the tv.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure put anything on, I don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; I say beginning to eat the salad.</p><p>He flicks through the channels, trying to find something in English. &ldquo;This will have to <g class=\"gr_ gr_469 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"469\" data-gr-id=\"469\">do</g>&rdquo; he says. I look up at the tv and the notebook is playing, but with really out of time Spanish voice-overs.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfect,&rdquo; I say laughing.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually my favorite movie, so I could probably recite the whole thing for you, I&rsquo;ve seen it that many times,&rdquo; he says laughing as he sits back on the bed. We sit watching the movie and I notice him nibbling on the fries.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, have the <g class=\"gr_ gr_446 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"446\" data-gr-id=\"446\">soup</g>&rdquo; I say.</p><p>&ldquo;You sure? I got it for you&rdquo; he says.</p><p>&ldquo;No it&rsquo;s fine, the salad is plenty&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<g class=\"gr_ gr_465 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"465\" data-gr-id=\"465\">Thanks</g>&rdquo; he says as he starts eating it.</p><p>After we finish the food, I put the tray on the table by the window,</p><p>&ldquo;Wow, there are still heaps of people out there,&rdquo; I say looking out the curtain. I sit back on the bed but this time I get in it. The movie is almost over and I look over at Harry, despite the movie being in Spanish, there are tears in his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you crying?&rdquo; I ask him</p><p>&ldquo;What? No&rdquo; he says wiping his eyes with the back of his hand.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re totally crying!&rdquo; I say teasing him.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay okay! What? I can&rsquo;t help it, it&rsquo;s a really sad movie!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aw, its okay Harry,&rdquo; I say in a baby voice as I grab his hand and squeeze it. He looks over at me and we both start laughing.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe your crying,&rdquo; I say between laughs. &ldquo;You are what? 24? A grown man!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey! Crying is manly&rdquo; he says semi-seriously.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; I say making my tone of voice serious too.</p><p>&ldquo;Soooo <g class=\"gr_ gr_488 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"488\" data-gr-id=\"488\">manly</g>&rdquo; I say laughing. He pushes me playfully. I push him back, he hardly even budges since he&rsquo;s so strong compared to me. He laughs at my attempt so I push him harder. He then pushes me back even harder and I manage to fall off the bed.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh shit. Are you okay?&rdquo; he says rushing over to me.</p><p>I just sit on the floor laughing. &ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; I manage to say even though I&rsquo;m laughing so hard tears are coming out of my eyes.</p><p>He helps me up and I get back under the covers, so does Harry this time. &ldquo;Are you okay? See look now <i>your c</i>rying. Let me see if you&rsquo;re okay&rdquo; he says as he puts his hands around my waist pulling me closer to him.</p><p>I&rsquo;m still cry-laughing at this point, he then kisses me slowly. I start kissing him back and things quickly get very heated. I pull away and smile &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; I say as I lay down and turn over, he puts his arms around me. We fit together perfectly. He softly strokes my arm with his thumb.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry for pushing you off the bed&rdquo; he whispers into my ear.</p><p>&ldquo;-<g class=\"gr_ gr_373 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del\" id=\"373\" data-gr-id=\"373\">t&rsquo;s</g> okay,&rdquo; I say hazy as I&rsquo;m pretty much asleep.</p><p>I hear him giggle softly. &ldquo;Night&rdquo; he whispers.</p><p>I mumble back something along the lines of 'goodnight&rsquo;.</p>",

I never booked a return flight, I might stay for a while longer, then train down to Osaka or something like that\u201d I <g class=\"gr_ gr_478 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"478\" data-gr-id=\"478\">say</g> looking at him. \u201cYou must be leaving soon? What is the schedule of \u2018Harry Styles\u2019 looking like?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>\u201cI actually fly to London tonight. I\u2019m there for about a week, then I\u2019m off to South America, then America for the last leg of the tour\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cBusy then, that\u2019s a lot of traveling!\u201d I say with a surprised expression on my face.</p><p>\u201cDo you think you will be able to handle it?\u201d he asks me.</p><p>\u201cWhha-\u201d I stop mid-sentence to process what he said. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I say laughing a bit in confusion.</p><p>\u201cI want you to come with <g class=\"gr_ gr_483 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"483\" data-gr-id=\"483\">me</g>\u201d He says. \u201cI was actually thinking about hiring another photographer, then I met you. I also just want an excuse to spend time with you. If you think about it, I\u2019m basically hiring you to hang out with me.\u201d he says trailing off, looking away. \u201cWhat do you say?\u201d</p><p>I stare at him blankly with my mouth open slightly. \u201cHarry. Are you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! I already talked to Jeff, that\u2019s why I left lunch yesterday, I didn\u2019t have an interview, we were going over things. I showed him some of your work, and he thinks it\u2019s a good idea.\u201d He has really thought about this.</p><p>\u201cWell, a secure job would be nice\u2026\u201d I start, \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think it would be the worst thing if I had to hang out with you.\u201d I stop to think about it. Am I really about to say yes to going on tour? \u201cSure, why the hell not?\u201d I say to him.</p><p>He leans in and passionately kisses me. He then takes my hand and squeezes it. There is a big smile on his face. \u201cAmazing!\u201d he exclaims.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m flying to Argentina on the 21st, and I figured you wanted to stay here until then, so your flight will be on the same <g class=\"gr_ gr_476 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"476\" data-gr-id=\"476\">day</g>\u201d He tells me, and I make sure to listen so I don\u2019t miss anything. \u201cClaire will also be on your flight, as she\u2019s staying in Japan since she has family here\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds perfect,\u201d I said squeezing his hand back. \u201cWhat time is your flight today?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201c3, it\u2019s a long one too. 12 hours\u201d he says sighing.</p><p>I make a pained expression \u201cEesh, that is long\u201d There\u2019s a pause in the conversation, and we both look out at the view. \u201cSo, what\u2019s the job description, I need to know what I\u2019m in <g class=\"gr_ gr_456 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"456\" data-gr-id=\"456\">for</g>\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cUhh well just taking pictures I guess. I post a picture from each show on my Instagram, and we have the HsHq which posts pictures too. So yeah, basically just take pictures of me on stage, the crowd, and the fans always seem to love a good candid backstage shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, doesn\u2019t sound too hard.\u201d He tells me about the places we will be going and how excited he is. We walk back down the mountain and he drops me back at my hotel. I hug him goodbye and wish him a safe flight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you in Argentina!\u201d he says.</p><p>When I get to my hotel room, I check the dates, today is the 15th, so 6 more days in Tokyo. I get a text on my phone from an unknown number;</p><p><b>\u2018Hey, its Clare, I got your number from Harry, hope you don\u2019t mind. Since you are also in Tokyo, do you want to hang out?\u2019</b></p><p>I reply <b>'Yes! That would be lovely\u2019</b></p><p>I see Clare a few times over the 6 days, she takes me to some 'hidden\u2019 places which are really cool. On the 21st we meet at the airport to catch our flight to Argentina. I don\u2019t end up sitting next to her which is disappointing since it was a long flight. Harry kindly booked me a business class seat, which was really nice of him. When we arrive in Argentina Clare and I get the same taxi to the hotel.</p><p>\"In our last 'team\u2019 meeting Jeff said the fans here are very intense, and to just be prepared\u201d She informs me.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say, as we pull up to the hotel. There are at least a hundred fans around, they are all anticipating who is arriving. When I step out they all seem disappointed, as they have no idea who I am. When Clare gets out of the car some of them start screaming and ask for pictures. They are all telling her how much they love her. We quickly grab our bags and are ushered by security into the lobby.</p><p>\u201cWow, that was crazy,\u201d I say to Clare while looking back at the fans.</p><p>\u201cYep, that definitely was,\u201d Clare says taking a sip from her water bottle. We are met by Jeff who helps checks us in.</p><p>\u201cHarry only arrived about an hour ago, that\u2019s why its pretty crazy out there. Hope you managed okay\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cYeah I\u2019m fine I just didn\u2019t expect it, I\u2019m only the girl on keys,\u201d Clare says laughing.</p><p>\u201cOkay here are your room cards, please find me if anything goes wrong or if you just have any questions,\u201d Jeff says to us as we wait for the lift. When it arrives, Jeff walks off waving goodbye.</p><p>We both enter the lift and I get out on level 2. I say goodbye to Clare as her room is on level 3. I roll my suitcase down the hall looking for number 35. After a while I find it. When I open the door, my mouth drops open. This hotel room is beautiful. There is a massive bed, a balcony, and a huge bathroom.</p><p>I put all my bags down and go out onto the balcony. It overlooks the parking lot and entrance to the hotel, there are so many fans crowded around. Some fans look over to me trying to figure out who I am. When they realize I\u2019m no one of importance they all look away.</p><p>When I yawn, I look at my phone to see the time. Its 2.42pm, so it would be 2.42am in Japan, no wonder I\u2019m tired. I take a photo of the crowd just for memories. I decide to wash my face and change into something more comfortable so I can relax for a while. I lay on my bed and it doesn\u2019t take long before I\u2019m falling asleep. I awake to a soft knocking on my door. I open the door to see Harry standing there. I semi jump into giving him a hug.\u201cHey\u201d he says as we pull away.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d I ask him.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good, how was your flight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong, I\u2019m so tired, just accidentally fell <g class=\"gr_ gr_452 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"452\" data-gr-id=\"452\">asleep</g>\u201d I say gesturing to the bed behind me.</p><p>\u201cOh sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to wake you\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s okay. Come in, you have to see this balcony!\u201d I say opening the doors of the balcony completely forgetting that there are about 100 fans outside. As I opened the door suddenly, all their attention is drawn in my direction. Since my room is only on the second level, they can see very clearly into it. They see Harry and all run over screaming to get his attention and a better view. \u201cShit!\u201d I say as I quickly close the door and Harry pulls the curtains. \u201cSorry, I wasn\u2019t thinking!\"\u00a0</p><p>\"It\u2019s okay, don\u2019t worry about <g class=\"gr_ gr_450 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"450\" data-gr-id=\"450\">it</g>\u201d he says sitting down on my bed.</p><p>\u201cWoah, that\u2019s pretty crazy, how do they even know you\u2019re staying here?\u201d I open the curtain slightly to see if they are still looking.</p><p>\u201cI guess one person sees me, then they tell someone and it kind of carries on, next thing you know its pretty <g class=\"gr_ gr_454 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"454\" data-gr-id=\"454\">chaotic</g>\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cIt was cute before, they all screamed for Clare when we got out of the car\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah Jeff told me, I love how they love the <g class=\"gr_ gr_460 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"460\" data-gr-id=\"460\">band</g>\u201d he says fondly.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d he says scooching up the bed to lean against the headboard. \u201cTell me what you did while I was gone\u201d he continues while patting the space next to him.</p><p>I sit down and begin to tell him about what I got up to. He then tells me about London, I\u2019m lying down on my side looking up at him. Again I have woken up to a light knocking on the door. I jolt up and I realize I fell asleep while Harry was telling me about some wedding he went to. He walks back from the door with a tray of food and drinks. He carefully places it on the bed. \u201cOh you\u2019re <g class=\"gr_ gr_505 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"505\" data-gr-id=\"505\">awake</g>\u201d he says with an ounce of surprise in his voice.</p><p>\u201cSorry for falling <g class=\"gr_ gr_453 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"453\" data-gr-id=\"453\">asleep</g>\u201d I say softly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he says. \u201cNice to know I must be really interesting to talk to\u201d he laughs.</p><p>\u201cNo! You\u2019re interesting, really interesting, I-I\u2019m just really jet-lagged, promise you\u2019re not boring\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only joking, I know you must be really tired. I ordered you some food so you can eat something then go to bed\"\u00a0</p><p>\"Aw thank you! How long was I asleep for?\u201d I question.</p><p>\u201cAbout 45 <g class=\"gr_ gr_467 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"467\" data-gr-id=\"467\">minutes</g>\u201d he says checking his watch.</p><p>\u201cHarry you could have left you to know. You must have been so bored!\u201d I say feeling bad.</p><p>\u201cNo it was fine, I was just replying to some emails\u201d he pauses. \u201cI didn\u2019t really know what you would want, so I got you some soup, salad, and fries,\u201d he says lifting up the covers over each dish.</p><p>\u201cThanks, <g class=\"gr_ gr_448 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"448\" data-gr-id=\"448\">Harry</g>\u201d I say smiling at him.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to put on a movie?\u201d he asks turning on the tv.</p><p>\u201cSure put anything on, I don\u2019t mind,\u201d I say beginning to eat the salad.</p><p>He flicks through the channels, trying to find something in English. \u201cThis will have to <g class=\"gr_ gr_469 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"469\" data-gr-id=\"469\">do</g>\u201d he says. I look up at the tv and the notebook is playing, but with really out of time Spanish voice-overs.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfect,\u201d I say laughing.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s actually my favorite movie, so I could probably recite the whole thing for you, I\u2019ve seen it that many times,\u201d he says laughing as he sits back on the bed. We sit watching the movie and I notice him nibbling on the fries.</p><p>\u201cHarry, have the <g class=\"gr_ gr_446 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"446\" data-gr-id=\"446\">soup</g>\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cYou sure? I got it for you\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cNo it\u2019s fine, the salad is plenty\u201d</p><p>\u201c<g class=\"gr_ gr_465 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"465\" data-gr-id=\"465\">Thanks</g>\u201d he says as he starts eating it.</p><p>After we finish the food, I put the tray on the table by the window,</p><p>\u201cWow, there are still heaps of people out there,\u201d I say looking out the curtain. I sit back on the bed but this time I get in it. The movie is almost over and I look over at Harry, despite the movie being in Spanish, there are tears in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cAre you crying?\u201d I ask him</p><p>\u201cWhat? No\u201d he says wiping his eyes with the back of his hand.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re totally crying!\u201d I say teasing him.</p><p>\u201cOkay okay! What? I can\u2019t help it, it\u2019s a really sad movie!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, its okay Harry,\u201d I say in a baby voice as I grab his hand and squeeze it. He looks over at me and we both start laughing.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe your crying,\u201d I say between laughs. \u201cYou are what? 24? A grown man!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey! Crying is manly\u201d he says semi-seriously.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, you\u2019re right,\u201d I say making my tone of voice serious too.</p><p>\u201cSoooo <g class=\"gr_ gr_488 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"488\" data-gr-id=\"488\">manly</g>\u201d I say laughing. He pushes me playfully. I push him back, he hardly even budges since he\u2019s so strong compared to me. He laughs at my attempt so I push him harder. He then pushes me back even harder and I manage to fall off the bed.</p><p>\u201cOh shit. Are you okay?\u201d he says rushing over to me.</p><p>I just sit on the floor laughing. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine,\u201d I manage to say even though I\u2019m laughing so hard tears are coming out of my eyes.</p><p>He helps me up and I get back under the covers, so does Harry this time. \u201cAre you okay? See look now <i>your c</i>rying. Let me see if you\u2019re okay\u201d he says as he puts his hands around my waist pulling me closer to him.</p><p>I\u2019m still cry-laughing at this point, he then kisses me slowly. I start kissing him back and things quickly get very heated. I pull away and smile \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I say as I lay down and turn over, he puts his arms around me. We fit together perfectly. He softly strokes my arm with his thumb.</p><p>\u201cSorry for pushing you off the bed\u201d he whispers into my ear.</p><p>\u201c-<g class=\"gr_ gr_373 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del\" id=\"373\" data-gr-id=\"373\">t\u2019s</g> okay,\u201d I say hazy as I\u2019m pretty much asleep.</p><p>I hear him giggle softly. \u201cNight\u201d he whispers.</p><p>I mumble back something along the lines of 'goodnight\u2019.</p>",

He looks at his phone and reads a text. He sighs while locking the screen.<br></p><p>\u201cSorry I have to do this again, but I have a radio interview at 3 and Jeff wants me to be there at least half an hour before\u201d I look at my watch, its already 2.30</p><p>\u201cYou better get going, thanks for lunch and trying to teach me how to use these,\u201d I say picking up my chopsticks.</p><p>He laughs and says \u201cI can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m a really bad teacher or you are just hopeless at using them\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it safe to say I hopeless at using <g class=\"gr_ gr_461 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"461\" data-gr-id=\"461\">them</g>\u201d I say while placing them down.</p><p>After he kindly pays the bill, we walk to the exit of the restaurant.

I wear plain black running pants and the treat people with kindness shirt I bought at the show. I tie up my sneakers and head down to the lobby. Harry\u2019s car pulls up at exactly 9, and he gets out. We hug to greet each other.</p><p>\u201cNice <g class=\"gr_ gr_451 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"451\" data-gr-id=\"451\">shirt</g>\u201d he says as we pull away and opens the car door for me.</p><p>\u201cThank <g class=\"gr_ gr_480 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"480\" data-gr-id=\"480\">you</g>\u201d I say hopping in, he gets in after me. We get to Mount Takao after about an hours drive. It went quickly as we just chatted about random things. I asked him how his interview went.</p><p>\u201cYeah, uh it was <g class=\"gr_ gr_496 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"496\" data-gr-id=\"496\">fine</g>\u201d he says unsurely, and then quickly changes the subject. That\u2019s odd, maybe he doesn\u2019t like talking about work. I shrug it off and continue talking. When we get there, we begin to walk up to the top along with many other tourists. It\u2019s a really popular place. We walk side by side talking, he tells me about his favorite hiking trails around the world.</p><p>\u201cMy dad took me on a hike back home in New Zealand, it had about 2000 stairs, but the view was incredible,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cYou will have to take me there one day,\u201d he says. \u201cI might hate stairs but I\u2019m a sucker for a good view\u201d</p><p>When we get to the top, we manage to find a bench that overlooks the view.

I never booked a return flight, I might stay for a while longer, then train down to Osaka or something like that\u201d I <g class=\"gr_ gr_478 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"478\" data-gr-id=\"478\">say</g> looking at him. \u201cYou must be leaving soon?

I\u2019m there for about a week, then I\u2019m off to South America, then America for the last leg of the tour\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cBusy then, that\u2019s a lot of traveling!\u201d I say with a surprised expression on my face.</p><p>\u201cDo you think you will be able to handle it?\u201d he asks me.</p><p>\u201cWhha-\u201d I stop mid-sentence to process what he said. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I say laughing a bit in confusion.</p><p>\u201cI want you to come with <g class=\"gr_ gr_483 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"483\" data-gr-id=\"483\">me</g>\u201d He says. \u201cI was actually thinking about hiring another photographer, then I met you. I also just want an excuse to spend time with you. If you think about it, I\u2019m basically hiring you to hang out with me.\u201d he says trailing off, looking away. \u201cWhat do you say?\u201d</p><p>I stare at him blankly with my mouth open slightly. \u201cHarry. Are you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! I already talked to Jeff, that\u2019s why I left lunch yesterday, I didn\u2019t have an interview, we were going over things. I showed him some of your work, and he thinks it\u2019s a good idea.\u201d He has really thought about this.</p><p>\u201cWell, a secure job would be nice\u2026\u201d I start, \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think it would be the worst thing if I had to hang out with you.\u201d I stop to think about it. Am I really about to say yes to going on tour? \u201cSure, why the hell not?\u201d I say to him.</p><p>He leans in and passionately kisses me. He then takes my hand and squeezes it. There is a big smile on his face. \u201cAmazing!\u201d he exclaims.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m flying to Argentina on the 21st, and I figured you wanted to stay here until then, so your flight will be on the same <g class=\"gr_ gr_476 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"476\" data-gr-id=\"476\">day</g>\u201d He tells me, and I make sure to listen so I don\u2019t miss anything. \u201cClaire will also be on your flight, as she\u2019s staying in Japan since she has family here\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds perfect,\u201d I said squeezing his hand back. \u201cWhat time is your flight today?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201c3, it\u2019s a long one too. 12 hours\u201d he says sighing.</p><p>I make a pained expression \u201cEesh, that is long\u201d There\u2019s a pause in the conversation, and we both look out at the view. \u201cSo, what\u2019s the job description, I need to know what I\u2019m in <g class=\"gr_ gr_456 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"456\" data-gr-id=\"456\">for</g>\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cUhh well just taking pictures I guess. I post a picture from each show on my Instagram, and we have the HsHq which posts pictures too. So yeah, basically just take pictures of me on stage, the crowd, and the fans always seem to love a good candid backstage shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, doesn\u2019t sound too hard.\u201d He tells me about the places we will be going and how excited he is. We walk back down the mountain and he drops me back at my hotel. I hug him goodbye and wish him a safe flight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you in Argentina!\u201d he says.</p><p>When I get to my hotel room, I check the dates, today is the 15th, so 6 more days in Tokyo. I get a text on my phone from an unknown number;</p><p><b>\u2018Hey, its Clare, I got your number from Harry, hope you don\u2019t mind. Since you are also in Tokyo, do you want to hang out?\u2019</b></p><p>I reply <b>'Yes! That would be lovely\u2019</b></p><p>I see Clare a few times over the 6 days, she takes me to some 'hidden\u2019 places which are really cool. On the 21st we meet at the airport to catch our flight to Argentina. I don\u2019t end up sitting next to her which is disappointing since it was a long flight. Harry kindly booked me a business class seat, which was really nice of him. When we arrive in Argentina Clare and I get the same taxi to the hotel.</p><p>\"In our last 'team\u2019 meeting Jeff said the fans here are very intense, and to just be prepared\u201d She informs me.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say, as we pull up to the hotel. There are at least a hundred fans around, they are all anticipating who is arriving. When I step out they all seem disappointed, as they have no idea who I am. When Clare gets out of the car some of them start screaming and ask for pictures. They are all telling her how much they love her. We quickly grab our bags and are ushered by security into the lobby.</p><p>\u201cWow, that was crazy,\u201d I say to Clare while looking back at the fans.</p><p>\u201cYep, that definitely was,\u201d Clare says taking a sip from her water bottle. We are met by Jeff who helps checks us in.</p><p>\u201cHarry only arrived about an hour ago, that\u2019s why its pretty crazy out there. Hope you managed okay\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cYeah I\u2019m fine I just didn\u2019t expect it, I\u2019m only the girl on keys,\u201d Clare says laughing.</p><p>\u201cOkay here are your room cards, please find me if anything goes wrong or if you just have any questions,\u201d Jeff says to us as we wait for the lift. When it arrives, Jeff walks off waving goodbye.</p><p>We both enter the lift and I get out on level 2. I say goodbye to Clare as her room is on level 3. I roll my suitcase down the hall looking for number 35. After a while I find it. When I open the door, my mouth drops open. This hotel room is beautiful. There is a massive bed, a balcony, and a huge bathroom.</p><p>I put all my bags down and go out onto the balcony. It overlooks the parking lot and entrance to the hotel, there are so many fans crowded around. Some fans look over to me trying to figure out who I am. When they realize I\u2019m no one of importance they all look away.</p><p>When I yawn, I look at my phone to see the time. Its 2.42pm, so it would be 2.42am in Japan, no wonder I\u2019m tired. I take a photo of the crowd just for memories. I decide to wash my face and change into something more comfortable so I can relax for a while. I lay on my bed and it doesn\u2019t take long before I\u2019m falling asleep. I awake to a soft knocking on my door. I open the door to see Harry standing there. I semi jump into giving him a hug.\u201cHey\u201d he says as we pull away.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d I ask him.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good, how was your flight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong, I\u2019m so tired, just accidentally fell <g class=\"gr_ gr_452 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"452\" data-gr-id=\"452\">asleep</g>\u201d I say gesturing to the bed behind me.</p><p>\u201cOh sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to wake you\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s okay. Come in, you have to see this balcony!\u201d I say opening the doors of the balcony completely forgetting that there are about 100 fans outside. As I opened the door suddenly, all their attention is drawn in my direction. Since my room is only on the second level, they can see very clearly into it. They see Harry and all run over screaming to get his attention and a better view. \u201cShit!\u201d I say as I quickly close the door and Harry pulls the curtains. \u201cSorry, I wasn\u2019t thinking!\"\u00a0</p><p>\"It\u2019s okay, don\u2019t worry about <g class=\"gr_ gr_450 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"450\" data-gr-id=\"450\">it</g>\u201d he says sitting down on my bed.</p><p>\u201cWoah, that\u2019s pretty crazy, how do they even know you\u2019re staying here?\u201d I open the curtain slightly to see if they are still looking.</p><p>\u201cI guess one person sees me, then they tell someone and it kind of carries on, next thing you know its pretty <g class=\"gr_ gr_454 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"454\" data-gr-id=\"454\">chaotic</g>\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cIt was cute before, they all screamed for Clare when we got out of the car\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah Jeff told me, I love how they love the <g class=\"gr_ gr_460 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"460\" data-gr-id=\"460\">band</g>\u201d he says fondly.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d he says scooching up the bed to lean against the headboard. \u201cTell me what you did while I was gone\u201d he continues while patting the space next to him.</p><p>I sit down and begin to tell him about what I got up to. He then tells me about London, I\u2019m lying down on my side looking up at him. Again I have woken up to a light knocking on the door. I jolt up and I realize I fell asleep while Harry was telling me about some wedding he went to. He walks back from the door with a tray of food and drinks. He carefully places it on the bed. \u201cOh you\u2019re <g class=\"gr_ gr_505 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"505\" data-gr-id=\"505\">awake</g>\u201d he says with an ounce of surprise in his voice.</p><p>\u201cSorry for falling <g class=\"gr_ gr_453 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"453\" data-gr-id=\"453\">asleep</g>\u201d I say softly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he says. \u201cNice to know I must be really interesting to talk to\u201d he laughs.</p><p>\u201cNo! You\u2019re interesting, really interesting, I-I\u2019m just really jet-lagged, promise you\u2019re not boring\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only joking, I know you must be really tired. I ordered you some food so you can eat something then go to bed\"\u00a0</p><p>\"Aw thank you! How long was I asleep for?\u201d I question.</p><p>\u201cAbout 45 <g class=\"gr_ gr_467 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"467\" data-gr-id=\"467\">minutes</g>\u201d he says checking his watch.</p><p>\u201cHarry you could have left you to know. You must have been so bored!\u201d I say feeling bad.</p><p>\u201cNo it was fine, I was just replying to some emails\u201d he pauses. \u201cI didn\u2019t really know what you would want, so I got you some soup, salad, and fries,\u201d he says lifting up the covers over each dish.</p><p>\u201cThanks, <g class=\"gr_ gr_448 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"448\" data-gr-id=\"448\">Harry</g>\u201d I say smiling at him.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to put on a movie?\u201d he asks turning on the tv.</p><p>\u201cSure put anything on, I don\u2019t mind,\u201d I say beginning to eat the salad.</p><p>He flicks through the channels, trying to find something in English. \u201cThis will have to <g class=\"gr_ gr_469 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"469\" data-gr-id=\"469\">do</g>\u201d he says. I look up at the tv and the notebook is playing, but with really out of time Spanish voice-overs.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfect,\u201d I say laughing.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s actually my favorite movie, so I could probably recite the whole thing for you, I\u2019ve seen it that many times,\u201d he says laughing as he sits back on the bed. We sit watching the movie and I notice him nibbling on the fries.</p><p>\u201cHarry, have the <g class=\"gr_ gr_446 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"446\" data-gr-id=\"446\">soup</g>\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cYou sure? I got it for you\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cNo it\u2019s fine, the salad is plenty\u201d</p><p>\u201c<g class=\"gr_ gr_465 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"465\" data-gr-id=\"465\">Thanks</g>\u201d he says as he starts eating it.</p><p>After we finish the food, I put the tray on the table by the window,</p><p>\u201cWow, there are still heaps of people out there,\u201d I say looking out the curtain. I sit back on the bed but this time I get in it. The movie is almost over and I look over at Harry, despite the movie being in Spanish, there are tears in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cAre you crying?\u201d I ask him</p><p>\u201cWhat? No\u201d he says wiping his eyes with the back of his hand.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re totally crying!\u201d I say teasing him.</p><p>\u201cOkay okay! What? I can\u2019t help it, it\u2019s a really sad movie!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, its okay Harry,\u201d I say in a baby voice as I grab his hand and squeeze it. He looks over at me and we both start laughing.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe your crying,\u201d I say between laughs. \u201cYou are what? 24? A grown man!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey! Crying is manly\u201d he says semi-seriously.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, you\u2019re right,\u201d I say making my tone of voice serious too.</p><p>\u201cSoooo <g class=\"gr_ gr_488 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"488\" data-gr-id=\"488\">manly</g>\u201d I say laughing. He pushes me playfully. I push him back, he hardly even budges since he\u2019s so strong compared to me. He laughs at my attempt so I push him harder. He then pushes me back even harder and I manage to fall off the bed.</p><p>\u201cOh shit. Are you okay?\u201d he says rushing over to me.</p><p>I just sit on the floor laughing. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine,\u201d I manage to say even though I\u2019m laughing so hard tears are coming out of my eyes.</p><p>He helps me up and I get back under the covers, so does Harry this time. \u201cAre you okay? See look now <i>your c</i>rying. Let me see if you\u2019re okay\u201d he says as he puts his hands around my waist pulling me closer to him.</p><p>I\u2019m still cry-laughing at this point, he then kisses me slowly. I start kissing him back and things quickly get very heated. I pull away and smile \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I say as I lay down and turn over, he puts his arms around me. We fit together perfectly. He softly strokes my arm with his thumb.</p><p>\u201cSorry for pushing you off the bed\u201d he whispers into my ear.</p><p>\u201c-<g class=\"gr_ gr_373 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del\" id=\"373\" data-gr-id=\"373\">t\u2019s</g> okay,\u201d I say hazy as I\u2019m pretty much asleep.</p><p>I hear him giggle softly. \u201cNight\u201d he whispers.</p><p>I mumble back something along the lines of 'goodnight\u2019.</p>",

It overlooks the parking lot and entrance to the hotel, there are so many fans crowded around. Some fans look over to me trying to figure out who I am. When they realize I&rsquo;m no one of importance they all look away.</p><p>When I yawn, I look at my phone to see the time. Its 2.42pm, so it would be 2.42am in Japan, no wonder I&rsquo;m tired. I take a photo of the crowd just for memories. I decide to wash my face and change into something more comfortable so I can relax for a while. I lay on my bed and it doesn&rsquo;t take long before I&rsquo;m falling asleep. I awake to a soft knocking on my door. I open the door to see Harry standing there. I semi jump into giving him a hug.&ldquo;Hey&rdquo; he says as we pull away.</p><p>&ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; I ask him.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m good, how was your flight?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Long, I&rsquo;m so tired, just accidentally fell asleep&rdquo; I say gesturing to the bed behind me.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh sorry, I didn&rsquo;t mean to wake you&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s okay. Come in, you have to see this balcony!&rdquo; I say opening the doors of the balcony completely forgetting that there are about 100 fans outside. As I opened the door suddenly, all their attention is drawn in my direction. Since my room is only on the second level, they can see very clearly into it. They see Harry and all run over screaming to get his attention and a better view. &ldquo;Shit!&rdquo; I say as I quickly close the door and Harry pulls the curtains. &ldquo;Sorry, I wasn&rsquo;t thinking!\"&nbsp;</p><p>\"It&rsquo;s okay, don&rsquo;t worry about it&rdquo; he says sitting down on my bed.</p><p>&ldquo;Woah, that&rsquo;s pretty crazy, how do they even know you&rsquo;re staying here?&rdquo; I open the curtain slightly to see if they are still looking.</p><p>&ldquo;I guess one person sees me, then they tell someone and it kind of carries on, next thing you know its pretty chaotic&rdquo; he says.</p><p>&ldquo;It was cute before, they all screamed for Clare when we got out of the car&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah Jeff told me, I love how they love the band&rdquo; he says fondly.</p><p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he says scooching up the bed to lean against the headboard. &ldquo;Tell me what you did while I was gone&rdquo; he continues while patting the space next to him.</p><p>I sit down and begin to tell him about what I got up to. He then tells me about London, I&rsquo;m lying down on my side looking up at him. Again I have woken up to a light knocking on the door. I jolt up and I realize I fell asleep while Harry was telling me about some wedding he went to. He walks back from the door with a tray of food and drinks. He carefully places it on the bed. &ldquo;Oh you&rsquo;re awake&rdquo; he says with an ounce of surprise in his voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry for falling asleep&rdquo; I say softly.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Nice to know I must be really interesting to talk to&rdquo; he laughs.</p><p>&ldquo;No! You&rsquo;re interesting, really interesting, I-I&rsquo;m just really jet-lagged, promise you&rsquo;re not boring&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m only joking, I know you must be really tired. I ordered you some food so you can eat something then go to bed\"&nbsp;</p><p>\"Aw thank you! How long was I asleep for?&rdquo; I question.</p><p>&ldquo;About 45 minutes&rdquo; he says checking his watch.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry you could have left you to know. You must have been so bored!&rdquo; I say feeling bad.</p><p>&ldquo;No it was fine, I was just replying to some emails&rdquo; he pauses. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t really know what you would want, so I got you some soup, salad, and fries,&rdquo; he says lifting up the covers over each dish.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, Harry&rdquo; I say smiling at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want to put on a movie?&rdquo; he asks turning on the tv.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure put anything on, I don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; I say beginning to eat the salad.</p><p>He flicks through the channels, trying to find something in English. &ldquo;This will have to do&rdquo; he says. I look up at the tv and the notebook is playing, but with really out of time Spanish voice-overs.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfect,&rdquo; I say laughing.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually my favorite movie, so I could probably recite the whole thing for you, I&rsquo;ve seen it that many times,&rdquo; he says laughing as he sits back on the bed. We sit watching the movie and I notice him nibbling on the fries.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, have the soup&rdquo; I say.</p><p>&ldquo;You sure? I got it for you&rdquo; he says.</p><p>&ldquo;No it&rsquo;s fine, the salad is plenty&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks&rdquo; he says as he starts eating it.</p><p>After we finish the food, I put the tray on the table by the window,</p><p>&ldquo;Wow, there are still heaps of people out there,&rdquo; I say looking out the curtain. I sit back on the bed but this time I get in it. The movie is almost over and I look over at Harry, despite the movie being in Spanish, there are tears in his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you crying?&rdquo; I ask him</p><p>&ldquo;What? No&rdquo; he says wiping his eyes with the back of his hand.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re totally crying!&rdquo; I say teasing him.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay okay! What? I can&rsquo;t help it, it&rsquo;s a really sad movie!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aw, its okay Harry,&rdquo; I say in a baby voice as I grab his hand and squeeze it. He looks over at me and we both start laughing.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe your crying,&rdquo; I say between laughs. &ldquo;You are what? 24? A grown man!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey! Crying is manly&rdquo; he says semi-seriously.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; I say making my tone of voice serious too.</p><p>&ldquo;Soooo manly&rdquo; I say laughing. He pushes me playfully. I push him back, he hardly even budges since he&rsquo;s so strong compared to me. He laughs at my attempt so I push him harder. He then pushes me back even harder and I manage to fall off the bed.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh shit. Are you okay?&rdquo; he says rushing over to me.</p><p>I just sit on the floor laughing. &ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; I manage to say even though I&rsquo;m laughing so hard tears are coming out of my eyes.</p><p>He helps me up and I get back under the covers, so does Harry this time. &ldquo;Are you okay? See look now <i>your c</i>rying. Let me see if you&rsquo;re okay&rdquo; he says as he puts his hands around my waist pulling me closer to him.</p><p>I&rsquo;m still cry-laughing at this point, he then kisses me slowly. I start kissing him back and things quickly get very heated. I pull away and smile &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; I say as I lay down and turn over, he puts his arms around me. We fit together perfectly. He softly strokes my arm with his thumb.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry for pushing you off the bed&rdquo; he whispers into my ear.</p><p>&ldquo;-t&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; I say hazy as I&rsquo;m pretty much asleep.</p><p>I hear him giggle softly. &ldquo;Night&rdquo; he whispers.</p><p>I mumble back something along the lines of 'goodnight&rsquo;.</p>",
