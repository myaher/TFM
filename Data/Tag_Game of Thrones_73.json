So many people like Arya for being strong and fierce, but for some reasons so many hate Sansa for what she was like in the earlier seasons. Can you give specific instances why you like both of them?

        "answer": "<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:11pt;\">I\u2019m going to talk about Dany first (and I\u2019m sticking to the show here, though I have read the books, but they\u2019re never getting finished, let\u2019s be real), and then I&rsquo;ll put my thoughts on Sansa and Arya in another post (hey, you asked, so I\u2019m delivering) because otherwise this will go on forever and it\u2019s cleaner this way. Putting a \u2018read more\u2019 here because this is long (lol I\u2019m at work I should be working)</p><!-- more --><p>To preface, I would not dislike Daenerys as much as I do if she didn\u2019t want to be queen. I\u2019ll touch on this when I talk about Arya, but I appreciate characters who have the self-awareness required to know who and what they are. Since Daenerys does want to rule Westeros, I have <i>so many</i> issues.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:11pt;margin-bottom:11pt;\">I also think the eighth season is going to see her turning on most of the people she\u2019s currently allied with and I think the catalyst for that is the discovery that Jon is the legitimate child of Rhaegar and Lyanna, and therefore his claim to the throne supersedes hers. I\u2019ll gladly admit that I\u2019m wrong if I am, but right now I don\u2019t think I am. Here\u2019s why.</p><p><i>1) She is an ineffective ruler </i></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:11pt;margin-bottom:11pt;\">After Dany liberated the slave cities of Astapor, Yunkai and Meereen, she stayed to rule and did a terrible job of it. Nobody in particular was better off, the majority of the slaves she freed were homeless and scraping for food in mess halls, and she killed elders who had spoken out against slavery without even listening to what any of them had to say. She has the mind for conquering, not for ruling.</p><p>(side note: why does she <i>even</i> want to be queen? It\u2019s something she just seemed to jump on in season two without ever reasoning it out, and from there on in it\u2019s like an obsession that has grown inside her. Now she says she wants to make the world a better place but she hasn\u2019t the skills to do it. It should be enough for her to liberate oppressed societies and allow somebody qualified to fix them. But it\u2019s not.)</p><p>The truth is, Meereen saw no real improvement until <i>after</i> Dany skipped town on Drogon, because Tyrion had the idea to replace the slave trade with actual trade. He made changes that impacted the city\u2019s economy and allowed its residents to start supporting themselves, so of course, the slavers attacked just as Dany came back, at which point her bright idea was to <i>decimate an entire armada</i> when she <i>needed</i> ships. Tyrion had to talk her out of it. Which brings me to her next point.</p><p><i>2) She requires constant babysitting</i></p><p>It\u2019s ironic to me that Tyrion told Cersei that \u201cthe difference\u201d between Cersei and Daenerys is that Dany knows herself well enough to hire advisors who tell her not to do dumb, impulsive things, firstly because <i>that is such a low bar, Tyrion!</i> There are people out there (Sansa) who <i>do not</i> require that kind of monitoring! Secondly because Cersei is far more self-aware than Dany. </p><p>Cersei knows that the things she does are bad and does them anyway because fuck it, she knows she wants power for power\u2019s sake. Dany has such a narrow view of justice that actually thinks she\u2019s being <i>righteous</i> when she burns people to death (more on that later) and that is the most dangerous mindset a leader can have. Compare that, if you will, to Sansa, who quite sensibly told Arya that chopping off heads might feel good but that\u2019s not the way to make people work together. Jorah, Tyrion and Jon have all had to speak out against Dany\u2019s more violent predilections and she\u2019s fast running out of people she wants to listen to. She and Tyrion are certainly hanging on by a thread. Which brings me to my next point.</p><p><i>3) She mistreats her own Hand</i></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:11pt;margin-bottom:11pt;\">The relationship between Dany and Tyrion absolutely reeks of Aerys and Tywin, their respective fathers, who were the best of friends until Aerys\u2019 jealousy and paranoia forced them to opposite sides of a bloody war. Dany is all too happy to take credit for Tyrion\u2019s best ideas when they work (and he is happy to let her) but as soon as one of his plans go wrong she whirls on him and berates him like he\u2019s a piece of trash. Everything\u2019s his fault when a plan goes wrong. </p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:11pt;margin-bottom:11pt;\">When he brought up the matter of the succession she accused him of plotting her death with his brother, which not only is batshit insane but proves that Daenerys gives far less of a shit about the future of Westeros than she claims to, because if she cared that much, she\u2019d care about planning to carry on the legacy she wants to build. She can\u2019t seem to forgive Tyrion for the heinous crime of\u2026loving his siblings? Trying to broker the most peaceful end to the war? Not wanting his brother to die? </p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:11pt;margin-bottom:11pt;\">Honestly, her treatment of Tyrion is one of the most telling aspects of her character and I am aghast that nobody seems to be talking about it.</p><p><i>4) Like all of the maddest Targaryens before her, she gets off on burning people</i></p><p>This one isn\u2019t subtle at all. Sorry to drop the intellectual veneer for a moment but she <i>fucking loves</i> that shit. It doesn\u2019t bother her a whit to watch people scream as they\u2019re being burned alive. She takes pleasure in burning people, you can see the satisfaction on her face, and a good leader should never take pleasure in something like that.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:11pt;margin-bottom:11pt;\">(FYI people like to mention how Sansa smiled when Ramsay\u2019s dogs ate him when I make this point and to that I blow a raspberry. That was her personal moment of justice against her rapist and abuser, not the lord of some house who wouldn\u2019t submit to her, there is no fair comparison)</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:11pt;margin-bottom:11pt;\">Dany was smiling like a satisfied cat when she burned down the temple of the Dosh Khaleen and killed everybody inside it, which was something she did to seize power, by the way. She didn\u2019t do it to stick it to a bunch of misogynists, though I\u2019m sure that was an added bonus. She did the exact same thing Cersei did to the Sept of Baelor and for the exact same reasons, yet only one of them is painted as a villain by the viewing public even though you can argue that Cersei was also sticking it to misogynists when she killed the High Sparrow. The only reason for that is that Dany was given humble origins while the narrative told us that Cersei was bad from the very beginning.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:11pt;margin-bottom:11pt;\">Theon is still beating himself up for killing and burning those two farm boys \u2014 as he should. Stannis burned his daughter and everyone was horrified. Jon was so repulsed to watch Mance Rayder burn that he defied Stannis and shot him in the heart. How many times is the show going to have to tell us that burning people alive is a terrible act of evil before people stop cheering Dany on for it? When Ned Stark was Lord of Winterfell, he understood and felt the weight of executing a man. Jon feels the weight of it, too, as we\u2019ve seen on a couple of occasions. Sansa clearly thought long and hard about executing Petyr \u2014 that\u2019s what her moment of reflection on the battlements was meant to show us. Dany just\u2026 doesn\u2019t care. I think she cared a bit when she had Daario execute Mossador, but I can\u2019t think of any other occasion where she has been directly responsible for a death and been remotely bothered by it.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:11pt;margin-bottom:11pt;\">So. yes.</p><p>I think the reason a lot of people \u2013 and in particular a lot of women \u2013 support Daenerys is because she has a girl power narrative. She <i>does</i> have a girl power narrative, it\u2019s true, but that is not a good enough reason to support a character who on so many occasions has proven herself to be unqualified for the job she wants, not to mention bordering on dangerously unhinged and increasingly paranoid. In that sense I think her season 1 narrative was genius, because her origins and the way in which she started to gain power (as well as her gender) has granted her a kind of automatic forgiveness for behaviours that several male characters \u2013 and Cersei, most importantly, because she also has a girl power narrative (and she and Dany are two peas in a pod) but the show told us she was a baddie from episode one \u2013 would be dragged through the mud for. And I\u2019m sorry, but it\u2019s not good enough for me. I\u2019m not going to support a powerful female character just because she\u2019s a powerful female character who did some good things once. Powerful women can be good or bad.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:11pt;margin-bottom:11pt;\">Some other points re: Daenerys</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:11pt;margin-bottom:11pt;\">The dragons are weapons of mass destruction and need to be killed.

I\u2019ll touch on this when I talk about Arya, but I appreciate characters who have the self-awareness required to know who and what they are. Since Daenerys does want to rule Westeros, I have <i>so many</i> issues.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:11pt;margin-bottom:11pt;\">I also think the eighth season is going to see her turning on most of the people she\u2019s currently allied with and I think the catalyst for that is the discovery that Jon is the legitimate child of Rhaegar and Lyanna, and therefore his claim to the throne supersedes hers. I\u2019ll gladly admit that I\u2019m wrong if I am, but right now I don\u2019t think I am. Here\u2019s why.</p><p><i>1) She is an ineffective ruler </i></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:11pt;margin-bottom:11pt;\">After Dany liberated the slave cities of Astapor, Yunkai and Meereen, she stayed to rule and did a terrible job of it. Nobody in particular was better off, the majority of the slaves she freed were homeless and scraping for food in mess halls, and she killed elders who had spoken out against slavery without even listening to what any of them had to say. She has the mind for conquering, not for ruling.</p><p>(side note: why does she <i>even</i> want to be queen? It\u2019s something she just seemed to jump on in season two without ever reasoning it out, and from there on in it\u2019s like an obsession that has grown inside her. Now she says she wants to make the world a better place but she hasn\u2019t the skills to do it. It should be enough for her to liberate oppressed societies and allow somebody qualified to fix them. But it\u2019s not.)</p><p>The truth is, Meereen saw no real improvement until <i>after</i> Dany skipped town on Drogon, because Tyrion had the idea to replace the slave trade with actual trade. He made changes that impacted the city\u2019s economy and allowed its residents to start supporting themselves, so of course, the slavers attacked just as Dany came back, at which point her bright idea was to <i>decimate an entire armada</i> when she <i>needed</i> ships. Tyrion had to talk her out of it. Which brings me to her next point.</p><p><i>2) She requires constant babysitting</i></p><p>It\u2019s ironic to me that Tyrion told Cersei that \u201cthe difference\u201d between Cersei and Daenerys is that Dany knows herself well enough to hire advisors who tell her not to do dumb, impulsive things, firstly because <i>that is such a low bar, Tyrion!</i> There are people out there (Sansa) who <i>do not</i> require that kind of monitoring! Secondly because Cersei is far more self-aware than Dany. </p><p>Cersei knows that the things she does are bad and does them anyway because fuck it, she knows she wants power for power\u2019s sake. Dany has such a narrow view of justice that actually thinks she\u2019s being <i>righteous</i> when she burns people to death (more on that later) and that is the most dangerous mindset a leader can have. Compare that, if you will, to Sansa, who quite sensibly told Arya that chopping off heads might feel good but that\u2019s not the way to make people work together. Jorah, Tyrion and Jon have all had to speak out against Dany\u2019s more violent predilections and she\u2019s fast running out of people she wants to listen to. She and Tyrion are certainly hanging on by a thread. Which brings me to my next point.</p><p><i>3) She mistreats her own Hand</i></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:11pt;margin-bottom:11pt;\">The relationship between Dany and Tyrion absolutely reeks of Aerys and Tywin, their respective fathers, who were the best of friends until Aerys\u2019 jealousy and paranoia forced them to opposite sides of a bloody war. Dany is all too happy to take credit for Tyrion\u2019s best ideas when they work (and he is happy to let her) but as soon as one of his plans go wrong she whirls on him and berates him like he\u2019s a piece of trash. Everything\u2019s his fault when a plan goes wrong. </p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:11pt;margin-bottom:11pt;\">When he brought up the matter of the succession she accused him of plotting her death with his brother, which not only is batshit insane but proves that Daenerys gives far less of a shit about the future of Westeros than she claims to, because if she cared that much, she\u2019d care about planning to carry on the legacy she wants to build. She can\u2019t seem to forgive Tyrion for the heinous crime of\u2026loving his siblings? Trying to broker the most peaceful end to the war? Not wanting his brother to die? </p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:11pt;margin-bottom:11pt;\">Honestly, her treatment of Tyrion is one of the most telling aspects of her character and I am aghast that nobody seems to be talking about it.</p><p><i>4) Like all of the maddest Targaryens before her, she gets off on burning people</i></p><p>This one isn\u2019t subtle at all. Sorry to drop the intellectual veneer for a moment but she <i>fucking loves</i> that shit. It doesn\u2019t bother her a whit to watch people scream as they\u2019re being burned alive. She takes pleasure in burning people, you can see the satisfaction on her face, and a good leader should never take pleasure in something like that.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:11pt;margin-bottom:11pt;\">(FYI people like to mention how Sansa smiled when Ramsay\u2019s dogs ate him when I make this point and to that I blow a raspberry. That was her personal moment of justice against her rapist and abuser, not the lord of some house who wouldn\u2019t submit to her, there is no fair comparison)</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:11pt;margin-bottom:11pt;\">Dany was smiling like a satisfied cat when she burned down the temple of the Dosh Khaleen and killed everybody inside it, which was something she did to seize power, by the way. She didn\u2019t do it to stick it to a bunch of misogynists, though I\u2019m sure that was an added bonus. She did the exact same thing Cersei did to the Sept of Baelor and for the exact same reasons, yet only one of them is painted as a villain by the viewing public even though you can argue that Cersei was also sticking it to misogynists when she killed the High Sparrow. The only reason for that is that Dany was given humble origins while the narrative told us that Cersei was bad from the very beginning.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:11pt;margin-bottom:11pt;\">Theon is still beating himself up for killing and burning those two farm boys \u2014 as he should. Stannis burned his daughter and everyone was horrified. Jon was so repulsed to watch Mance Rayder burn that he defied Stannis and shot him in the heart. How many times is the show going to have to tell us that burning people alive is a terrible act of evil before people stop cheering Dany on for it? When Ned Stark was Lord of Winterfell, he understood and felt the weight of executing a man. Jon feels the weight of it, too, as we\u2019ve seen on a couple of occasions. Sansa clearly thought long and hard about executing Petyr \u2014 that\u2019s what her moment of reflection on the battlements was meant to show us. Dany just\u2026 doesn\u2019t care. I think she cared a bit when she had Daario execute Mossador, but I can\u2019t think of any other occasion where she has been directly responsible for a death and been remotely bothered by it.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:11pt;margin-bottom:11pt;\">So. yes.</p><p>I think the reason a lot of people \u2013 and in particular a lot of women \u2013 support Daenerys is because she has a girl power narrative. She <i>does</i> have a girl power narrative, it\u2019s true, but that is not a good enough reason to support a character who on so many occasions has proven herself to be unqualified for the job she wants, not to mention bordering on dangerously unhinged and increasingly paranoid. In that sense I think her season 1 narrative was genius, because her origins and the way in which she started to gain power (as well as her gender) has granted her a kind of automatic forgiveness for behaviours that several male characters \u2013 and Cersei, most importantly, because she also has a girl power narrative (and she and Dany are two peas in a pod) but the show told us she was a baddie from episode one \u2013 would be dragged through the mud for. And I\u2019m sorry, but it\u2019s not good enough for me. I\u2019m not going to support a powerful female character just because she\u2019s a powerful female character who did some good things once. Powerful women can be good or bad.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:11pt;margin-bottom:11pt;\">Some other points re: Daenerys</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:11pt;margin-bottom:11pt;\">The dragons are weapons of mass destruction and need to be killed.
