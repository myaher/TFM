7</b></p><p>\u201cEasy, hey\u2026 <i>hey</i>, take it easy,\u201d he calls out, hands\nraised in surrender as he warily eyes the barrels of two pump-action shotguns pointed\nwith deadly precision at his chest. \u00a0</p><p>This wasn\u2019t quite the welcome he was expecting, but then\nagain he can\u2019t really say he had time to think about what it was he was hoping\nto find at the end of the gravel driveway he somehow managed to swerve onto without hitting any of the trees that framed it. \nBetween the adrenaline-fogged turmoil of their flight, Stark\u2019s shocking\nconfession and the man\u2019s abrupt loss of consciousness that had James lunging\nfor the steering wheel to avoid ramming the car into the nearest tree, he\ndidn\u2019t have time to think about anything. \nSo maybe finding himself facing two gun-wielding teenagers (and, yes,\nthey are just kids, goddamit, and what the hell kind of place is this anyway?)\nshouldn\u2019t have come as such great of a shock. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trespassing.\u201d One of the kids raises his weapon\nhigher, finger tightening on the trigger, and James has to fight the urge to\nduck, because he\u2019s really not looking forward to getting shot at again. \u00a0He\u2019s had enough of that for one day, thank\nyou very much.</p><p>\u201cLook, I don\u2019t want any trouble,\u201d he begins, placating. \u00a0\u201cI just\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just <i>what</i>?\u201d </p><p>A woman steps out of a large stucco farmhouse that stands at\nthe edge of the driveway. \u00a0Tall and\nblue-eyed with a long beautiful mane of strawberry blond hair pulled into a\nmessy bun above her head, she somehow manages to look intimidatingly regal in a\nplain white button down tucked carelessly into a pair of threadbare jeans.</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cThe only people who come here are either running from\ntrouble or looking for it,\u201d she muses, taking a few slow, measured steps toward\nhim, and even though she carries no weapon that James can see, there\u2019s\nsomething about her that makes her look even more dangerous than the two\ngun-wielding teens. \u00a0\u201cSo which of that\napplies to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d \u00a0He looks back\nover his shoulder at their car, parked crookedly in the middle of the driveway\n(he did the best he could under the circumstances, forced to maneuver his way\naround Stark\u2019s dead weight to get to the pedals and the wheel). \u00a0Looks at Stark\u2019s unconscious form, barely\nvisible from where it\u2019s slumped sideways between the steering wheel and the\ndoor. \u00a0\u201cI was told to come here,\u201d he\nsays, turning back to his \u201cwelcoming committee\u201d. \u00a0Thinks back to the name Stark mentioned\nbefore passing out and scaring the fuck out of him. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m looking for someone named\u2026 Pepper?\u201d \u00a0</p><p>He feels ridiculous saying it. \u00a0Pepper doesn\u2019t even sound like a name. \u00a0Not a person\u2019s name anyhow. \u00a0And maybe that wasn\u2019t even what Stark was\nsaying at all \u2013 the man was barely putting words together. \u00a0What if James misheard? What if it wasn\u2019t\n\u201cPepper\u201d at all? \u00a0But he can\u2019t very well\nask Stark for clarification now, and it\u2019s not like he\u2019s got much of a choice,\ndoes he.</p><p>The woman, however, stiffens visibly at the odd moniker,\nblue eyes narrowing in open suspicion. \n\u201cWhere did you hear that name?\u201d</p><p>He swallows nervously as the older of the two teens shifts threateningly toward him. \u00a0Stumbles back a step,\nfeeling the back of his knee hit the bumper of the car.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d he tries again, daring to wave his hand in the\ndirection of the driver\u2019s seat. \u00a0\u201cMy\nfriend\u2019s been shot, he needs help.\u201d</p><p>The teen glances back at the woman as if asking permission,\nwalks carefully around James to the driver\u2019s seat, his weapon still at the\nready as he peers inside through the shot-out driver\u2019s window. \u00a0In the next instant his dark eyes widen in alarm,\nmouth falling open with a shocked gasp.</p><p>\u201cMiss Potts!\u201d the kid yells over his shoulder even as he\u2019s\nwrenching the door open, the shotgun tossed aside without a second thought. \u201cCome\nhere, quick! It\u2019s Mr. Stark!\u201d \u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>The next few minutes fly by in a frantic bustle of activity,\nwhere James stands to the side, forgotten, as he watches the two teens pull\nStark out of the car with almost reverent care, settling him briefly down on\nthe older one\u2019s lap. \u00a0The woman, Potts, crouches\ndown next to him, her face scrunched up in worry as she presses trembling fingers\nto the pulse point on Stark\u2019s neck. \u00a0</p><p>James doesn\u2019t begrudge her that worry. \u00a0Because Stark looks bad \u2013 a few heartbeats away\nfrom a corpse kind of bad. \u00a0The man\u2019s\nskin is ashen, his face slack, the left side of his shirt is soaked with blood. \u00a0Not for the first time James berates himself\nfor not noticing that something was amiss

Parker, <i>May</i> <i>Parker</i>. \nThe senator\u2019s goddamn secretary. \nThe one James strongly suspects was the reason behind Stark\u2019s abrupt\nfiring 10 years ago. \u00a0The one who\ndisappeared without a trace. \u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>And he really has to wonder about the coincidental\nstrangeness of it all, has questions he wants to ask. \u00a0But Potts (<i>Pepper</i>, James knows that, too, now) is looking at him with murder\nin her eyes, and all those questions are momentarily forgotten as James wonders\nif the woman might possibly turn out to be more dangerous for his health than the hired killers.</p>",

no weapon that James can see, there\u2019s\nsomething about her that makes her look even more dangerous than the two\ngun-wielding teens. \u00a0\u201cSo which of that\napplies to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d \u00a0He looks back\nover his shoulder at their car, parked crookedly in the middle of the driveway\n(he did the best he could under the circumstances, forced to maneuver his way\naround Stark\u2019s dead weight to get to the pedals and the wheel). \u00a0Looks at Stark\u2019s unconscious form, barely\nvisible from where it\u2019s slumped sideways between the steering wheel and the\ndoor. \u00a0\u201cI was told to come here,\u201d he\nsays, turning back to his \u201cwelcoming committee\u201d. \u00a0Thinks back to the name Stark mentioned\nbefore passing out and scaring the fuck out of him. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m looking for someone named\u2026 Pepper?\u201d \u00a0</p><p>He feels ridiculous saying it. \u00a0Pepper doesn\u2019t even sound like a name. \u00a0Not a person\u2019s name anyhow. \u00a0And maybe that wasn\u2019t even what Stark was\nsaying at all \u2013 the man was barely putting words together. \u00a0What if James misheard? What if it wasn\u2019t\n\u201cPepper\u201d at all? \u00a0But he can\u2019t very well\nask Stark for clarification now, and it\u2019s not like he\u2019s got much of a choice,\ndoes he.</p><p>The woman, however, stiffens visibly at the odd moniker,\nblue eyes narrowing in open suspicion. \n\u201cWhere did you hear that name?\u201d</p><p>He swallows nervously as the older of the two teens shifts threateningly toward him. \u00a0Stumbles back a step,\nfeeling the back of his knee hit the bumper of the car.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d he tries again, daring to wave his hand in the\ndirection of the driver\u2019s seat. \u00a0\u201cMy\nfriend\u2019s been shot, he needs help.\u201d</p><p>The teen glances back at the woman as if asking permission,\nwalks carefully around James to the driver\u2019s seat, his weapon still at the\nready as he peers inside through the shot-out driver\u2019s window. \u00a0In the next instant his dark eyes widen in alarm,\nmouth falling open with a shocked gasp.</p><p>\u201cMiss Potts!\u201d the kid yells over his shoulder even as he\u2019s\nwrenching the door open, the shotgun tossed aside without a second thought. \u201cCome\nhere, quick!

of the car with almost reverent care, settling him briefly down on\nthe older one\u2019s lap. \u00a0The woman, Potts, crouches\ndown next to him, her face scrunched up in worry as she presses trembling fingers\nto the pulse point on Stark\u2019s neck. \u00a0</p><p>James doesn\u2019t begrudge her that worry. \u00a0Because Stark looks bad \u2013 a few heartbeats away\nfrom a corpse kind of bad. \u00a0The man\u2019s\nskin is ashen, his face slack, the left side of his shirt is soaked with blood. \u00a0Not for the first time James berates himself\nfor not noticing that something was amiss sooner. \u00a0Perhaps he could have done something. \u00a0Could have insisted they stop the car. \u00a0Could have applied pressure to the wound,\nwrapped it up, slowed the bleeding down. \nCould have prevented this from getting so far out of hand.</p><p>Potts stands up abruptly, motioning for the boys to pick\nStark up. \u00a0\u201cPut him in my room,\u201d she\ninstructs, voice tense \u2013 a far

toward the house, Stark\u2019s limp body\ncradled carefully between them.</p><p>Potts closes her eyes for a moment, takes a breath, her\nshoulders trembling slightly before she visibly pulls herself together. \u00a0Casts a brief assessing look back at\nJames. \u00a0\u201cCome along,\u201d she tells him in a\ntone that makes it sound more like an order than a suggestion. \u00a0\u201cYou can

7</b></p><p>\u201cEasy, hey\u2026 <i>hey</i>, take it easy,\u201d he calls out, hands\nraised in surrender as he warily eyes the barrels of two pump-action shotguns pointed\nwith deadly precision at his chest. \u00a0</p><p>This wasn\u2019t quite the welcome he was expecting, but then\nagain he can\u2019t really say he had time to think about what it was he was hoping\nto find at the end of the gravel driveway he somehow managed to swerve onto without hitting any of the trees that framed it. \nBetween the adrenaline-fogged turmoil of their flight, Stark\u2019s shocking\nconfession and the man\u2019s abrupt loss of consciousness that had James lunging\nfor the steering wheel to avoid ramming the car into the nearest tree, he\ndidn\u2019t have time to think about anything. \nSo maybe finding himself facing two gun-wielding teenagers (and, yes,\nthey are just kids, goddamit, and what the hell kind of place is this anyway?)\nshouldn\u2019t have come as such great of a shock. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trespassing.\u201d One of the kids raises his weapon\nhigher, finger tightening on the trigger, and James has to fight the urge to\nduck, because he\u2019s really not looking forward to getting shot at again. \u00a0He\u2019s had enough of that for one day, thank\nyou very much.</p><p>\u201cLook, I don\u2019t want any trouble,\u201d he begins, placating. \u00a0\u201cI just\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just <i>what</i>?\u201d </p><p>A woman steps out of a large stucco farmhouse that stands at\nthe edge of the driveway. \u00a0Tall and\nblue-eyed with a long beautiful mane of strawberry blond hair pulled into a\nmessy bun above her head, she somehow manages to look intimidatingly regal in a\nplain white button down tucked carelessly into a pair of threadbare jeans.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cThe only people who come here are either running from\ntrouble or looking for it,\u201d she muses, taking a few slow, measured steps toward\nhim, and even though she carries no weapon that James can see, there\u2019s\nsomething about her that makes her look even more dangerous than the two\ngun-wielding teens. \u00a0\u201cSo which of that\napplies to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d \u00a0He looks back\nover his shoulder at their car, parked crookedly in the middle of the driveway\n(he did the best he could under the circumstances, forced to maneuver his way\naround Stark\u2019s dead weight to get to the pedals and the wheel). \u00a0Looks at Stark\u2019s unconscious form, barely\nvisible from where it\u2019s slumped sideways between the steering wheel and the\ndoor. \u00a0\u201cI was told to come here,\u201d he\nsays, turning back to his \u201cwelcoming committee\u201d. \u00a0Thinks back to the name Stark mentioned\nbefore passing out and scaring the fuck out of him. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m looking for someone named\u2026 Pepper?\u201d \u00a0</p><p>He feels ridiculous saying it. \u00a0Pepper doesn\u2019t even sound like a name. \u00a0Not a person\u2019s name anyhow. \u00a0And maybe that wasn\u2019t even what Stark was\nsaying at all \u2013 the man was barely putting words together. \u00a0What if James misheard? What if it wasn\u2019t\n\u201cPepper\u201d at all? \u00a0But he can\u2019t very well\nask Stark for clarification now, and it\u2019s not like he\u2019s got much of a choice,\ndoes he.</p><p>The woman, however, stiffens visibly at the odd moniker,\nblue eyes narrowing in open suspicion. \n\u201cWhere did you hear that name?\u201d</p><p>He swallows nervously as the older of the two teens shifts threateningly toward him. \u00a0Stumbles back a step,\nfeeling the back of his knee hit the bumper of the car.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d he tries again, daring to wave his hand in the\ndirection of the driver\u2019s seat. \u00a0\u201cMy\nfriend\u2019s been shot, he needs help.\u201d</p><p>The teen glances back at the woman as if asking permission,\nwalks carefully around James to the driver\u2019s seat, his weapon still at the\nready as he peers inside through the shot-out driver\u2019s window. \u00a0In the next instant his dark eyes widen in alarm,\nmouth falling open with a shocked gasp.</p><p>\u201cMiss Potts!\u201d the kid yells over his shoulder even as he\u2019s\nwrenching the door open, the shotgun tossed aside without a second thought. \u201cCome\nhere, quick! It\u2019s Mr. Stark!\u201d \u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>The next few minutes fly by in a frantic bustle of activity,\nwhere James stands to the side, forgotten, as he watches the two teens pull\nStark out of the car with almost reverent care, settling him briefly down on\nthe older one\u2019s lap. \u00a0The woman, Potts, crouches\ndown next to him, her face scrunched up in worry as she presses trembling fingers\nto the pulse point on Stark\u2019s neck. \u00a0</p><p>James doesn\u2019t begrudge her that worry. \u00a0Because Stark looks bad \u2013 a few heartbeats away\nfrom a corpse kind of bad. \u00a0The man\u2019s\nskin is ashen, his face slack, the left side of his shirt is soaked with blood. \u00a0Not for the first time James berates himself\nfor not noticing that something was amiss sooner. \u00a0Perhaps he could have done something. \u00a0Could have insisted they stop the car. \u00a0Could have applied pressure to the wound,\nwrapped it up, slowed the bleeding down. \nCould have prevented this from getting so far out of hand.</p><p>Potts stands up abruptly, motioning for the boys to pick\nStark up. \u00a0\u201cPut him in my room,\u201d she\ninstructs, voice tense \u2013 a far cry from her cool, composed timbre from\nbefore. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll need boiled water, towels\nand my medical kit. \u00a0Get everything\nready. \u00a0And then the two of you go take\ncare of the car \u2013 I don\u2019t want either of you witnessing this, you\nunderstand?\u201d \u00a0</p><p>The older teen opens his mouth as if to argue, then relents\nwith a nod and the two of them take off toward the house, Stark\u2019s limp body\ncradled carefully between them.</p><p>Potts closes her eyes for a moment, takes a breath, her\nshoulders trembling slightly before she visibly pulls herself together. \u00a0Casts a brief assessing look back at\nJames. \u00a0\u201cCome along,\u201d she tells him in a\ntone that makes it sound more like an order than a suggestion. \u00a0\u201cYou can help.\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>In the end James doesn\u2019t end up doing much past crouching by\nStark\u2019s head, hands resting lightly on the man\u2019s biceps to help keep him still\nshould he awaken while Potts works on cleaning and wrapping the wound with the\nhelp of another woman, who seems familiar somehow, though James, for the life\nof him, can\u2019t figure out why.</p><p>Potts cleans out the wound with copious amounts of boiled\nwater, her hands sure now, in control, exhibiting none of the earlier quiver. \u00a0But James is all too aware of how skin-deep that control\nis. \u00a0Can see it in the almost frantic\nurgency of her movements, in the lines of tension around her eyes, in the\npallor of her cheeks that almost rivals Stark\u2019s\u2026</p><p>Stark\u2019s body jolts violently when she pours some rubbing\nalcohol onto the wound, and she jerks her hand away with a startled gasp, cuts\na worried glance at Stark\u2019s face. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cTony?\u201d she calls out, and there it is \u2013 that same naked\nvulnerability in her expression, the undisguised fear in the wide blue-eyed\ngaze that James had observed outside earlier. \n\u201cTony?\u201d </p><p>She reaches for him, hesitant, trembling fingertips\nskittering over the ashen skin. \u00a0Stark\u2019s eyelashes\nflutter briefly in response, his forehead scrunching up. \u00a0But he doesn\u2019t wake fully, and James can feel\nthe pain-strained muscles under his palms relax as the man slips back under\nmere moments later.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s alright,\u201d James gives Potts, what he hopes is, a\nreassuring nod, loosening his grip on Stark\u2019s arms. \n\u201cHe\u2019s still out of it. \u00a0Just\u2026 just\nkeep going.\u201d </p><p>She doesn\u2019t acknowledge him, but her jaw clenches sharply,\nlips pressing together in a grim, worried line. \nTears her gaze away from Stark\u2019s face, reaches for the dressing that the\nother woman holds out for her.</p><p>\u201cMay,\u201d she calls out as she finishes applying the dressing\nand moves to cover Stark with a blanket that lies folded at the foot of the\nbed, \u201ccould you go check on the boys, please?\u201d There\u2019s something in her voice,\na kind of dark tension that puts James on edge once again.</p><p>The other woman frowns at that, casts a wary glance at\nJames. \u00a0\u201cAre you sure it\u2019s a good idea,\nPep?\u201d she hedges, concern written into every line of her expressive face. \u00a0\u201cI\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Potts insists, her voice soft but with an undercurrent of cold, unyielding steel. \u00a0She\ngives James a smile that\u2019s all teeth and sharp edges. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll be out in a bit.\u201d</p><p>The other woman purses her lips unhappily \u2013 an expression\neerily similar to what James saw on the face of the older teen not too long\nago. \u00a0Acquiesces with a soft sigh of\ndefeat. \u00a0\u201cCall me if you need me,\u201d she\nsays and walks out, throwing James one last almost apologetic look.</p><p>It\u2019s only when the door clicks shut behind her that James\u2019s\nbrain finally catches up to him long enough for him to remember a pretty brown-eyed\nwoman that used to sit behind Justin Hammer during meetings, writing things\ndown on a thick notepad. Parker, <i>May</i> <i>Parker</i>. \nThe senator\u2019s goddamn secretary. \nThe one James strongly suspects was the reason behind Stark\u2019s abrupt\nfiring 10 years ago. \u00a0The one who\ndisappeared without a trace. \u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>And he really has to wonder about the coincidental\nstrangeness of it all, has questions he wants to ask. \u00a0But Potts (<i>Pepper</i>, James knows that, too, now) is looking at him with murder\nin her eyes, and all those questions are momentarily forgotten as James wonders\nif the woman might possibly turn out to be more dangerous for his health than the hired killers.</p>",

she muses, taking a few slow, measured steps toward\nhim, and even though she carries no weapon that James can see, there&rsquo;s\nsomething about her that makes her look even more dangerous than the two\ngun-wielding teens. &nbsp;&ldquo;So which of that\napplies to you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo; &nbsp;He looks back\nover his shoulder at their car, parked crookedly in the middle of the driveway\n(he did the best he could under the circumstances, forced to maneuver his way\naround Stark&rsquo;s dead weight to get to the pedals and the wheel). &nbsp;Looks at Stark&rsquo;s unconscious form, barely\nvisible from where it&rsquo;s slumped sideways between the steering wheel and the\ndoor. &nbsp;&ldquo;I was told to come here,&rdquo; he\nsays, turning back to his &ldquo;welcoming committee&rdquo;. &nbsp;Thinks back to the name Stark mentioned\nbefore passing out and scaring the fuck out of him. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for someone named&hellip; Pepper?&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>He feels ridiculous saying it. &nbsp;Pepper doesn&rsquo;t even sound like a name. &nbsp;Not a person&rsquo;s name anyhow. &nbsp;And maybe that wasn&rsquo;t even what Stark was\nsaying at all &ndash; the man was barely putting words together. &nbsp;What if James misheard? What if it wasn&rsquo;t\n&ldquo;Pepper&rdquo; at all? &nbsp;But he can&rsquo;t very well\nask Stark for clarification now, and it&rsquo;s not like he&rsquo;s got much of a choice,\ndoes he.</p><p>The woman, however, stiffens visibly at the odd moniker,\nblue eyes narrowing in open suspicion. \n&ldquo;Where did you hear that name?&rdquo;</p><p>He swallows nervously as the older of the two teens shifts threateningly toward him. &nbsp;Stumbles back a step,\nfeeling the back of his knee hit the bumper of the car.</p><p>&ldquo;Please,&rdquo; he tries again, daring to wave his hand in the\ndirection of the driver&rsquo;s seat. &nbsp;&ldquo;My\nfriend&rsquo;s been shot, he needs help.&rdquo;</p><p>The teen glances back at the woman as if asking permission,\nwalks carefully around James to the driver&rsquo;s seat, his weapon still at the\nready as he peers inside through the shot-out driver&rsquo;s window. &nbsp;In the next instant his dark eyes widen in alarm,\nmouth falling open with a shocked gasp.</p><p>&ldquo;Miss Potts!&rdquo; the kid yells over his shoulder even as he&rsquo;s\nwrenching the door open, the shotgun tossed aside without a second thought. &ldquo;Come\nhere, quick! It&rsquo;s Mr. Stark!&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>***</p><p>The next few minutes fly by in a frantic bustle of activity,\nwhere James stands to the side, forgotten, as he watches the two teens pull\nStark out of the car with almost reverent care, settling him briefly down on\nthe older one&rsquo;s lap. &nbsp;The woman, Potts, crouches\ndown next to him, her face scrunched up in worry as she presses trembling fingers\nto the pulse point on Stark&rsquo;s neck. &nbsp;</p><p>James doesn&rsquo;t begrudge her that worry. &nbsp;Because Stark looks bad &ndash; a few heartbeats away\nfrom a corpse kind of bad. &nbsp;The man&rsquo;s\nskin is ashen, his face slack, the left side of his shirt is soaked with blood. &nbsp;Not for the first time James berates himself\nfor not noticing that something was amiss sooner. &nbsp;Perhaps he could have done something. &nbsp;Could have insisted they stop the car. &nbsp;Could have applied pressure to the wound,\nwrapped it up, slowed the bleeding down. \nCould have prevented this from getting so far out of hand.</p><p>Potts stands up abruptly, motioning for the boys to pick\nStark up. &nbsp;&ldquo;Put him in my room,&rdquo; she\ninstructs, voice tense &ndash; a far cry from her cool, composed timbre from\nbefore. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll need boiled water, towels\nand my medical kit. &nbsp;Get everything\nready. &nbsp;And then the two of you go take\ncare of the car &ndash; I don&rsquo;t want either of you witnessing this, you\nunderstand?&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>The older teen opens his mouth as if to argue, then relents\nwith a nod and the two of them take off toward the house, Stark&rsquo;s limp body\ncradled carefully between them.</p><p>Potts closes her eyes for a moment, takes a breath, her\nshoulders trembling slightly before she visibly pulls herself together. &nbsp;Casts a brief assessing look back at\nJames. &nbsp;&ldquo;Come along,&rdquo; she tells him in a\ntone that makes it sound more like an order than a suggestion. &nbsp;&ldquo;You can help.&rdquo;</p><p>***</p><p>In the end James doesn&rsquo;t end up doing much past crouching by\nStark&rsquo;s head, hands resting lightly on the man&rsquo;s biceps to help keep him still\nshould he awaken while Potts works on cleaning and wrapping the wound with the\nhelp of another woman, who seems familiar somehow, though James, for the life\nof him, can&rsquo;t figure out why.</p><p>Potts cleans out the wound with copious amounts of boiled\nwater, her hands sure now, in control, exhibiting none of the earlier quiver. &nbsp;But James is all too aware of how skin-deep that control\nis. &nbsp;Can see it in the almost frantic\nurgency of her movements, in the lines of tension around her eyes, in the\npallor of her cheeks that almost rivals Stark&rsquo;s&hellip;</p><p>Stark&rsquo;s body jolts violently when she pours some rubbing\nalcohol onto the wound, and she jerks her hand away with a startled gasp, cuts\na worried glance at Stark&rsquo;s face. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony?&rdquo; she calls out, and there it is &ndash; that same naked\nvulnerability in her expression, the undisguised fear in the wide blue-eyed\ngaze that James had observed outside earlier. \n&ldquo;Tony?&rdquo; </p><p>She reaches for him, hesitant, trembling fingertips\nskittering over the ashen skin. &nbsp;Stark&rsquo;s eyelashes\nflutter briefly in response, his forehead scrunching up. &nbsp;But he doesn&rsquo;t wake fully, and James can feel\nthe pain-strained muscles under his palms relax as the man slips back under\nmere moments later.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s alright,&rdquo; James gives Potts, what he hopes is, a\nreassuring nod, loosening his grip on Stark&rsquo;s arms. \n&ldquo;He&rsquo;s still out of it. &nbsp;Just&hellip; just\nkeep going.&rdquo; </p><p>She doesn&rsquo;t acknowledge him, but her jaw clenches sharply,\nlips pressing together in a grim, worried line. \nTears her gaze away from Stark&rsquo;s face, reaches for the dressing that the\nother woman holds out for her.</p><p>&ldquo;May,&rdquo; she calls out as she finishes applying the dressing\nand moves to cover Stark with a blanket that lies folded at the foot of the\nbed, &ldquo;could you go check on the boys, please?&rdquo; There&rsquo;s something in her voice,\na kind of dark tension that puts James on edge once again.</p><p>The other woman frowns at that, casts a wary glance at\nJames. &nbsp;&ldquo;Are you sure it&rsquo;s a good idea,\nPep?&rdquo; she hedges, concern written into every line of her expressive face. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be fine,&rdquo; Potts insists, her voice soft but with an undercurrent of cold, unyielding steel. &nbsp;She\ngives James a smile that&rsquo;s all teeth and sharp edges. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be out in a bit.&rdquo;</p><p>The other woman purses her lips unhappily &ndash; an expression\neerily similar to what James saw on the face of the older teen not too long\nago. &nbsp;Acquiesces with a soft sigh of\ndefeat. &nbsp;&ldquo;Call me if you need me,&rdquo; she\nsays and walks out, throwing James one last almost apologetic look.</p><p>It&rsquo;s only when the door clicks shut behind her that James&rsquo;s\nbrain finally catches up to him long enough for him to remember a pretty brown-eyed\nwoman that used to sit behind Justin Hammer during meetings, writing things\ndown on a thick notepad. Parker, <i>May</i> <i>Parker</i>. \nThe senator&rsquo;s goddamn secretary. \nThe one James strongly suspects was the reason behind Stark&rsquo;s abrupt\nfiring 10 years ago. &nbsp;The one who\ndisappeared without a trace. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>And he really has to wonder about the coincidental\nstrangeness of it all, has questions he wants to ask. &nbsp;But Potts (<i>Pepper</i>, James knows that, too, now) is looking at him with murder\nin her eyes, and all those questions are momentarily forgotten as James wonders\nif the woman might possibly turn out to be more dangerous for his health than the hired killers.</p>",

Pepper\u2019s phone blew up literally a few minutes \nlater, an action for which Tony had to do a lot of explaining. He was \nforced to remove the explosive devices he\u2019d placed it Clint, Steve, \nRhodey and Natasha\u2019s phones. Of course, Stephen, Bruce, Thor, Jane and \nBilly all heard about it from Christine, who was more shocked than she \nhad any right to be. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Tony Stark, Christine, they guy could blow up a wet piece of paper.\u201d Stephen had sneered. </p><p>\u201cAnyone\n could blow up a wet piece of paper if they strapped it to a bomb.\u201d Thor\n said, always taking pleasure in undermining Stephen. It reminded him of\n the way he used to tease his adoptive brother Loki before he ran away.</p><p>\u201cThe\n point is, he would think to do that.\u201d Stephen glared at Thor and Thor \nnodded sagely, barely hiding his amusement. \u201cHe\u2019s a total nut job and \nsomeone should lock him up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny,\u201d Bruce says from where he\u2019s sitting beside Thor. \u201cHe says the same thing about you.\u201d</p><p>Stephen\n glares and Bruce just shrugs. Thor takes the glare much more seriously \nand leans closer to Bruce while glaring right back at Stephen. That \nprotective streak he had seemed to be skewing in Bruce\u2019s direction more \noften than not lately. </p><p>\u201cHe would. He\u2019s threatened by my genius.\u201d</p><p>Christine\n rolled her eyes and threw a perfectly good french fry at him, but it \nhad to be done. \u201cYou two just need to get together already. I don\u2019t care\n if it\u2019s to hook up or get married and have one point seven children, \nbut you guys seriously just need to work something out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh please, like I\u2019d ever stoop that low. I\u2019m gay, not desperate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDesperate\n isn\u2019t really the word I would have used.\u201d Bruce came to his defense. \nThen the rest of the table got involved, like they had any right to be \ndiscussing his private life.</p><p>\u201cTesty,\u201d Jane supplied, followed by Thor\u2019s, \u201chorny,\u201d and Christine\u2019s, \u201cthat all sounds like desperate to me.\u201d</p><p>Stephen\n sighed and blew a strand of hair out of his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not desperate \nfor anything. I\u2019d eat my shoe before I\u2019d go on a date with Tony Stark.\u201d<br/>\u201cI can arrange that,\u201d Jane smiled, \u201cBesides, no one said anything about dates. Oooo, Stephen has a crush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Stephen rolled his eyes. \u201cYou are all unhelpful. I\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo\n go find Tony and make raucous love to him?\u201d Thor asked, throwing his \narm around Bruce and shaking him with his laughter. Bruce started \nlaughing too, but he only had eyes for Thor.</p><p>\u201cTo get away from you idiots. Why am I friends with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe ask ourselves the same question everyday, Stephen,\u201d Christine tells him with a smile that\u2019s too sweet.</p><p>\u201cI hate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you too. You should really think about doing something about that massive heart on you have for Tony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, haha, you\u2019re so witty.\u201d Stephen sneers at her and she just keeps smiling.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s\n got a heart on for me?\u201d Tony Stark of all people asks as he\u2019s walking \nby. \u201cI can\u2019t help but interrupt when I hear my name. It\u2019s part \nself-defense and part narcissism.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeak\n of the devil.\u201d Stephen muttered under his breath. \u201cMy friends are all \nobsessed with you, why don\u2019t you chat about that while I go anywhere \nelse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\n come on Stephen, don\u2019t be mad. We love you.\u201d Jane called as Stephen \nwalked away, always the quickest to try to smooth things over.</p><p>He waved without looking back at them, a universal sign for exactly how done he was with them.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his problem?\u201d Tony asked Christine, and Christine smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d </p><p>Tony\n tilted his head curiously and then looked back after Stephen. \u201cReally?\u201d\n he licked his lips just a little as he watched Stephen\u2019s retreat. \u201cDo \ntell.\u201d He sat down in Stephen\u2019s recently vacated spot.</p><p>\u201cHe hates you.\u201d Thor tells him cheerily, and Jane nods her affirmation.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what he says anyway. Bruce says you hate him too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell sure, the guy\u2019s a total asshole. What\u2019s this about me being his problem though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re only asking so you can use it against him-\u201d Christine started, but Tony waved away her concern.</p><p>\u201cRelax, I draw the line at tugging on people\u2019s heart strings, even I\u2019m not that much of an asshole. Does he like me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf\n I answer that will you promise never to blow up anyone else\u2019s phones \nbecause you\u2019re jealous they\u2019re stealing your friends.\u201d Christine raised \nan eyebrow, narrowing her eyes in scrutiny.</p><p>\u201cHand to Thor, I won\u2019t. Spill.\u201d</p><p>Jane squealed and hit Thor in the arm. \u201cOh my god we\u2019re finally getting them together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, no one said anything about together. I just want to know what the deal is. I\u2019m not admitting to anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsking was as good as admitting.\u201d Christine rolled her eyes. \u201cAlright, here\u2019s the deal.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014</p><p>Stephen\n was shoving books into his locker when Tony fucking Stark of all people\n showed up, again, and just had to make his presence known.</p><p>\u201cHey\n Stephen.\u201d Tony grinned, closing Stephen\u2019s locker as soon as he was done\n putting books in. \u201cI hear from nowhere in particular that you don\u2019t \nhave a date to homecoming yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\n I wonder where you heard that.\u201d Stephen rolled his eyes and the venom \npractically dripped from his words. His friends were dead to him. He\u2019d \nhave to find new ones. Maybe live as a hermit without friends for the \nrest of his miserable existence.</p><p>\u201cWell,\n I heard it from that cute girl who apparently lives under a rock. She \nwas just heartbroken that you turned her down. Anyway. Will you go to \nhomecoming with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd\n why the hell would I want to do that?\u201d Stephen asked, trying to evade \nTony by walking in the direction opposite Tony\u2019s next class, nevermind \nhow he knew where Tony\u2019s next class was.</p><p>\u201cWell,\n because you\u2019re hot. I\u2019m hot. We\u2019d be a really hot couple, and I\u2019m super\n easy so if you\u2019re just in it for sex, I\u2019m your guy. So, what do you \nsay? Homecoming?\u201d</p><p>Stephen stopped, looked at Tony, and then continued walking again, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cDo you really think I\u2019m in it just for sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\n don\u2019t know, it\u2019s what like,\u201d Tony takes a second and Stephen\u2019s pretty \nsure he\u2019s doing actual math when he finally says, \u201csixty two percent of \npeople are in for. Statistically, it\u2019s probable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you can\u2019t apply statistics like that in this situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure\n I can. I didn\u2019t say what you would do, just what you\u2019d probably do, and\n either way I\u2019m good. So don\u2019t make me ask again, I hate to come off as \nneedy.\u201d Tony grinned and then pulled a red rose out from his backpack. \n\u201cCan a guy get an answer, Stephen?\u201d</p><p>Stephen looked at the rose and then at Tony.</p><p>\u201cHave you been carrying that around all day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swiped it off Vice Principal Hill\u2019s desk. She had twelve, she\u2019ll never notice one missing.\u201d</p><p>Stephen\n rolled his eyes and then looked back at the flower. \u201cI\u2019m saying yes but\n you can keep your pilfered flower. I\u2019m not taking the fall for your \ncrimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome!\u201d\n Tony grinned tossing the flower over his shoulder and taking a step \ncloser to Stephen. \u201cSo, can I pick you up at seven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeven thirty, if you\u2019re as insufferable on a date as you are right now I\u2019d like to spend less time with you, not more.\u201d</p><p>Tony\n studied Stephen\u2019s face and licked his lips then nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s a deal. \nSeven thirty.\u201d Tony started to leave, riding the high of a mission \ncomplete.</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t wear something obnoxious!\u201d Stephen calls after him, and Tony just smiles over his shoulder.</p><p>Tony\n shows up in a gold tux and a bright red undershirt. Stephen refuses to \nbe seen with him in public. Tony cackles and then suggests they spend \nthe night in. Stephen says yes.</p><p>They show up to school together the next Monday, and Tony gives Stephen a kiss on the cheek before heading to class. </p><p>Jane squeals. <br/></p><p><a href=\"https://iwritefanficsometimes.tumblr.com/ask\">Prompt Me!</a><br/></p>",

I don\u2019t care\n if it\u2019s to hook up or get married and have one point seven children, \nbut you guys seriously just need to work something out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh please, like I\u2019d ever stoop that low. I\u2019m gay, not desperate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDesperate\n isn\u2019t really the word I would have used.\u201d Bruce came to his defense. \nThen the rest of the table got involved, like they had any right to be \ndiscussing his private life.</p><p>\u201cTesty,\u201d Jane supplied, followed by Thor\u2019s, \u201chorny,\u201d and Christine\u2019s, \u201cthat all sounds like desperate to me.\u201d</p><p>Stephen\n sighed and blew a strand of hair out of his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not desperate \nfor anything. I\u2019d eat my shoe before I\u2019d go on a date with Tony Stark.\u201d<br>\u201cI can arrange that,\u201d Jane smiled, \u201cBesides, no one said anything about dates. Oooo, Stephen has a crush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Stephen rolled his eyes. \u201cYou are all unhelpful. I\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo\n go find Tony and make raucous love to him?\u201d Thor asked, throwing his \narm around Bruce and shaking him with his laughter. Bruce started \nlaughing too, but he only had eyes for Thor.</p><p>\u201cTo get away from you idiots. Why am I friends with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe ask ourselves the same question everyday, Stephen,\u201d Christine tells him with a smile that\u2019s too sweet.</p><p>\u201cI hate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you too. You should really think about doing something about that massive heart on you have for Tony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, haha, you\u2019re so witty.\u201d Stephen sneers at her and she just keeps smiling.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s\n got a heart on for me?\u201d Tony Stark of all people asks as he\u2019s walking \nby. \u201cI can\u2019t help but interrupt when I hear my name. It\u2019s part \nself-defense and part narcissism.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeak\n of the devil.\u201d Stephen muttered under his breath. \u201cMy friends are all \nobsessed with you, why don\u2019t you chat about that while I go anywhere \nelse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\n come on Stephen, don\u2019t be mad. We love you.\u201d Jane called as Stephen \nwalked away, always the quickest to try to smooth things over.</p><p>He waved without looking back at them, a universal sign for exactly how done he was with them.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his problem?\u201d Tony asked Christine, and Christine smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d </p><p>Tony\n tilted his head curiously and then looked back after Stephen. \u201cReally?\u201d\n he licked his lips just a little as he watched Stephen\u2019s retreat. \u201cDo \ntell.\u201d He sat down in Stephen\u2019s recently vacated spot.</p><p>\u201cHe hates you.\u201d Thor tells him cheerily, and Jane nods her affirmation.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what he says anyway. Bruce says you hate him too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell sure, the guy\u2019s a total asshole. What\u2019s this about me being his problem though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re only asking so you can use it against him-\u201d Christine started, but Tony waved away her concern.</p><p>\u201cRelax, I draw the line at tugging on people\u2019s heart strings, even I\u2019m not that much of an asshole. Does he like me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf\n I answer that will you promise never to blow up anyone else\u2019s phones \nbecause you\u2019re jealous they\u2019re stealing your friends.\u201d Christine raised \nan eyebrow, narrowing her eyes in scrutiny.</p><p>\u201cHand to Thor, I won\u2019t. Spill.\u201d</p><p>Jane squealed and hit Thor in the arm. \u201cOh my god we\u2019re finally getting them together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, no one said anything about together. I just want to know what the deal is. I\u2019m not admitting to anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsking was as good as admitting.\u201d Christine rolled her eyes. \u201cAlright, here\u2019s the deal.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014</p><p>Stephen\n was shoving books into his locker when Tony fucking Stark of all people\n showed up, again, and just had to make his presence known.</p><p>\u201cHey\n Stephen.\u201d Tony grinned, closing Stephen\u2019s locker as soon as he was done\n putting books in. \u201cI hear from nowhere in particular that you don\u2019t \nhave a date to homecoming yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\n I wonder where you heard that.\u201d Stephen rolled his eyes and the venom \npractically dripped from his words. His friends were dead to him. He\u2019d \nhave to find new ones. Maybe live as a hermit without friends for the \nrest of his miserable existence.</p><p>\u201cWell,\n I heard it from that cute girl who apparently lives under a rock. She \nwas just heartbroken that you turned her down. Anyway. Will you go to \nhomecoming with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd\n why the hell would I want to do that?\u201d Stephen asked, trying to evade \nTony by walking in the direction opposite Tony\u2019s next class, nevermind \nhow he knew where Tony\u2019s next class was.</p><p>\u201cWell,\n because you\u2019re hot. I\u2019m hot. We\u2019d be a really hot couple, and I\u2019m super\n easy so if you\u2019re just in it for sex, I\u2019m your guy. So, what do you \nsay? Homecoming?\u201d</p><p>Stephen stopped, looked at Tony, and then continued walking again, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cDo you really think I\u2019m in it just for sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\n don\u2019t know, it\u2019s what like,\u201d Tony takes a second and Stephen\u2019s pretty \nsure he\u2019s doing actual math when he finally says, \u201csixty two percent of \npeople are in for. Statistically, it\u2019s probable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you can\u2019t apply statistics like that in this situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure\n I can. I didn\u2019t say what you would do, just what you\u2019d probably do, and\n either way I\u2019m good. So don\u2019t make me ask again, I hate to come off as \nneedy.\u201d Tony grinned and then pulled a red rose out from his backpack. \n\u201cCan a guy get an answer, Stephen?\u201d</p><p>Stephen looked at the rose and then at Tony.</p><p>\u201cHave you been carrying that around all day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swiped it off Vice Principal Hill\u2019s desk. She had twelve, she\u2019ll never notice one missing.\u201d</p><p>Stephen\n rolled his eyes and then looked back at the flower. \u201cI\u2019m saying yes but\n you can keep your pilfered flower. I\u2019m not taking the fall for your \ncrimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome!\u201d\n Tony grinned tossing the flower over his shoulder and taking a step \ncloser to Stephen. \u201cSo, can I pick you up at seven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeven thirty, if you\u2019re as insufferable on a date as you are right now I\u2019d like to spend less time with you, not more.\u201d</p><p>Tony\n studied Stephen\u2019s face and licked his lips then nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s a deal. \nSeven thirty.\u201d Tony started to leave, riding the high of a mission \ncomplete.</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t wear something obnoxious!\u201d Stephen calls after him, and Tony just smiles over his shoulder.</p><p>Tony\n shows up in a gold tux and a bright red undershirt. Stephen refuses to \nbe seen with him in public. Tony cackles and then suggests they spend \nthe night in. Stephen says yes.</p><p>They show up to school together the next Monday, and Tony gives Stephen a kiss on the cheek before heading to class. </p><p>Jane squeals. <br></p><p><a href=\"https://iwritefanficsometimes.tumblr.com/ask\">Prompt Me!</a><br></p>",

Of course, Stephen, Bruce, Thor, Jane and \nBilly all heard about it from Christine, who was more shocked than she \nhad any right to be. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Tony Stark, Christine, they guy could blow up a wet piece of paper.&rdquo; Stephen had sneered. </p><p>&ldquo;Anyone\n could blow up a wet piece of paper if they strapped it to a bomb.&rdquo; Thor\n said, always taking pleasure in undermining Stephen. It reminded him of\n the way he used to tease his adoptive brother Loki before he ran away.</p><p>&ldquo;The\n point is, he would think to do that.&rdquo; Stephen glared at Thor and Thor \nnodded sagely, barely hiding his amusement. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a total nut job and \nsomeone should lock him up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Funny,&rdquo; Bruce says from where he&rsquo;s sitting beside Thor. &ldquo;He says the same thing about you.&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen\n glares and Bruce just shrugs. Thor takes the glare much more seriously \nand leans closer to Bruce while glaring right back at Stephen. That \nprotective streak he had seemed to be skewing in Bruce&rsquo;s direction more \noften than not lately. </p><p>&ldquo;He would. He&rsquo;s threatened by my genius.&rdquo;</p><p>Christine\n rolled her eyes and threw a perfectly good french fry at him, but it \nhad to be done. &ldquo;You two just need to get together already. I don&rsquo;t care\n if it&rsquo;s to hook up or get married and have one point seven children, \nbut you guys seriously just need to work something out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh please, like I&rsquo;d ever stoop that low. I&rsquo;m gay, not desperate.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Desperate\n isn&rsquo;t really the word I would have used.&rdquo; Bruce came to his defense. \nThen the rest of the table got involved, like they had any right to be \ndiscussing his private life.</p><p>&ldquo;Testy,&rdquo; Jane supplied, followed by Thor&rsquo;s, &ldquo;horny,&rdquo; and Christine&rsquo;s, &ldquo;that all sounds like desperate to me.&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen\n sighed and blew a strand of hair out of his eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not desperate \nfor anything. I&rsquo;d eat my shoe before I&rsquo;d go on a date with Tony Stark.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;I can arrange that,&rdquo; Jane smiled, &ldquo;Besides, no one said anything about dates. Oooo, Stephen has a crush.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Whatever,&rdquo; Stephen rolled his eyes. &ldquo;You are all unhelpful. I&rsquo;m leaving.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To\n go find Tony and make raucous love to him?&rdquo; Thor asked, throwing his \narm around Bruce and shaking him with his laughter. Bruce started \nlaughing too, but he only had eyes for Thor.</p><p>&ldquo;To get away from you idiots. Why am I friends with you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We ask ourselves the same question everyday, Stephen,&rdquo; Christine tells him with a smile that&rsquo;s too sweet.</p><p>&ldquo;I hate you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Love you too. You should really think about doing something about that massive heart on you have for Tony.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, haha, you&rsquo;re so witty.&rdquo; Stephen sneers at her and she just keeps smiling.</p><p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s\n got a heart on for me?&rdquo; Tony Stark of all people asks as he&rsquo;s walking \nby. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help but interrupt when I hear my name. It&rsquo;s part \nself-defense and part narcissism.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Speak\n of the devil.&rdquo; Stephen muttered under his breath. &ldquo;My friends are all \nobsessed with you, why don&rsquo;t you chat about that while I go anywhere \nelse.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,\n come on Stephen, don&rsquo;t be mad. We love you.&rdquo; Jane called as Stephen \nwalked away, always the quickest to try to smooth things over.</p><p>He waved without looking back at them, a universal sign for exactly how done he was with them.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s his problem?&rdquo; Tony asked Christine, and Christine smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;You.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony\n tilted his head curiously and then looked back after Stephen. &ldquo;Really?&rdquo;\n he licked his lips just a little as he watched Stephen&rsquo;s retreat. &ldquo;Do \ntell.&rdquo; He sat down in Stephen&rsquo;s recently vacated spot.</p><p>&ldquo;He hates you.&rdquo; Thor tells him cheerily, and Jane nods her affirmation.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what he says anyway. Bruce says you hate him too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well sure, the guy&rsquo;s a total asshole. What&rsquo;s this about me being his problem though?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re only asking so you can use it against him-&rdquo; Christine started, but Tony waved away her concern.</p><p>&ldquo;Relax, I draw the line at tugging on people&rsquo;s heart strings, even I&rsquo;m not that much of an asshole. Does he like me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If\n I answer that will you promise never to blow up anyone else&rsquo;s phones \nbecause you&rsquo;re jealous they&rsquo;re stealing your friends.&rdquo; Christine raised \nan eyebrow, narrowing her eyes in scrutiny.</p><p>&ldquo;Hand to Thor, I won&rsquo;t. Spill.&rdquo;</p><p>Jane squealed and hit Thor in the arm. &ldquo;Oh my god we&rsquo;re finally getting them together.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, no one said anything about together. I just want to know what the deal is. I&rsquo;m not admitting to anything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Asking was as good as admitting.&rdquo; Christine rolled her eyes. &ldquo;Alright, here&rsquo;s the deal.&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>Stephen\n was shoving books into his locker when Tony fucking Stark of all people\n showed up, again, and just had to make his presence known.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey\n Stephen.&rdquo; Tony grinned, closing Stephen&rsquo;s locker as soon as he was done\n putting books in. &ldquo;I hear from nowhere in particular that you don&rsquo;t \nhave a date to homecoming yet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh\n I wonder where you heard that.&rdquo; Stephen rolled his eyes and the venom \npractically dripped from his words. His friends were dead to him. He&rsquo;d \nhave to find new ones. Maybe live as a hermit without friends for the \nrest of his miserable existence.</p><p>&ldquo;Well,\n I heard it from that cute girl who apparently lives under a rock. She \nwas just heartbroken that you turned her down. Anyway. Will you go to \nhomecoming with me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And\n why the hell would I want to do that?&rdquo; Stephen asked, trying to evade \nTony by walking in the direction opposite Tony&rsquo;s next class, nevermind \nhow he knew where Tony&rsquo;s next class was.</p><p>&ldquo;Well,\n because you&rsquo;re hot. I&rsquo;m hot. We&rsquo;d be a really hot couple, and I&rsquo;m super\n easy so if you&rsquo;re just in it for sex, I&rsquo;m your guy. So, what do you \nsay? Homecoming?&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen stopped, looked at Tony, and then continued walking again, shaking his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you really think I&rsquo;m in it just for sex?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I\n don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s what like,&rdquo; Tony takes a second and Stephen&rsquo;s pretty \nsure he&rsquo;s doing actual math when he finally says, &ldquo;sixty two percent of \npeople are in for. Statistically, it&rsquo;s probable.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t apply statistics like that in this situation.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure\n I can. I didn&rsquo;t say what you would do, just what you&rsquo;d probably do, and\n either way I&rsquo;m good. So don&rsquo;t make me ask again, I hate to come off as \nneedy.&rdquo; Tony grinned and then pulled a red rose out from his backpack. \n&ldquo;Can a guy get an answer, Stephen?&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen looked at the rose and then at Tony.</p><p>&ldquo;Have you been carrying that around all day?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I swiped it off Vice Principal Hill&rsquo;s desk. She had twelve, she&rsquo;ll never notice one missing.&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen\n rolled his eyes and then looked back at the flower. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m saying yes but\n you can keep your pilfered flower. I&rsquo;m not taking the fall for your \ncrimes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Awesome!&rdquo;\n Tony grinned tossing the flower over his shoulder and taking a step \ncloser to Stephen. &ldquo;So, can I pick you up at seven?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Seven thirty, if you&rsquo;re as insufferable on a date as you are right now I&rsquo;d like to spend less time with you, not more.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony\n studied Stephen&rsquo;s face and licked his lips then nodded. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a deal. \nSeven thirty.&rdquo; Tony started to leave, riding the high of a mission \ncomplete.</p><p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t wear something obnoxious!&rdquo; Stephen calls after him, and Tony just smiles over his shoulder.</p><p>Tony\n shows up in a gold tux and a bright red undershirt. Stephen refuses to \nbe seen with him in public. Tony cackles and then suggests they spend \nthe night in. Stephen says yes.</p><p>They show up to school together the next Monday, and Tony gives Stephen a kiss on the cheek before heading to class. </p><p>Jane squeals. <br /></p><p><a href=\"https://iwritefanficsometimes.tumblr.com/ask\">Prompt Me!</a><br /></p>",
