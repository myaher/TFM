He eyed her sourly. Her hair, loose and frizzy, poofed around her head in a bob. Her lemon yellow highlights made his mouth water with disgust. She was messy.</p><p>\u201cPassable,\u201d he said, taking back his black card and putting it in his wallet. It gave him pleasure to see the girl\u2019s mouth move silently. Her tiny pig eyes bugged out.</p><p>\u201cSir, if there is anything additional we can do next time to make your stay more pleasant-\u201d</p><p>He held his hand up. She stopped talking immediately. He smoothed the front of his shirt.</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary, because I will not be coming back,\u201d he said. The girl\u2019s eyes watered.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"436\" data-orig-height=\"335\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"blogdeepbelieverbouquetworld:9sg4SRhUrHnQuaRFp9lAPQ:Z7Zs_b2b78UV8\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/020cd246986bf555ec71b35726e3866f/tumblr_pdvxzyJzCb1wim3ngo1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"436\" data-orig-height=\"335\"/></figure><p>\u201cPlease, Mr. Valkenberg. I will get the manager. We will make it right, no matter what!\u201d She waved her arm wildly at the beautifully suited woman approaching, curious about the intense conversation. She took one look at Valkenberg and put on her most unctuous grin.</p><p>\u201cHello, sir. I trust you enjoyed your stay in your eponymous suite?\u201d The receptionist\u2019s eyes bugged out further.</p><p>\u201cNo, madam, I did not,\u201d he said, squaring up. The woman\u2019s face twitched.</p><p>\u201cMay I ask why? We strive to give every single one of our guests-\u201d</p><p>Again, he held his hand up for silence. The manager\u2019s mouth snapped shut.</p><p>\u201cDust. In the carpets, and on the windowsills and shelves. The sheets were unironed, and dubious at best. The sink had fingerprints, and there was mold-\u201d he got really close to her, and his brown eyes widened with indignation -\u201dslimy black mold in the shower. The amenities are black marble, but that does not mean they don\u2019t need to be properly scrubbed and sanitized.\u201d</p><p>The woman\u2019s face steadily got redder and redder, but she remained quiet. He got steadily angrier as he spoke.</p><p>\u201cJust because we\u2019re in a backwoods wilderness does not give your establishment carte blanche to cut corners,\u201d he hissed. \u201cEspecially after how much I paid for one night. It\u2019s disgusting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir, I deeply apologize for our negligence. At least three generations of Valkenbergs have stayed in our hotel when visiting the Pacific Northwest in that very suite, and we are determined to make it memorable.\u201d</p><p>His eyes drifted to the woman fidgeting by the sitting area. She took off her stilettos and rubbed her raw toes on the oriental carpet. She closed her eyes and sighed with relief. His mouth twisted with displeasure.</p><p>Uncultured bitch.</p><p>\u201cSir? I will run a strict evaluation of all our current staff, and remove those who\u2026\u201d</p><p>He walked to his ward and pointed down at the floor. \u201cPut your shoes back on. Now!\u201d</p><p>She gave him a vacuous look. Pretty face, empty eyes. \u201cBut these shoes are too small. They\u2019re killing me, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your baby,\u201d he said. \u201cYour feet will adjust. You will not walk around in public barefoot. You\u2019re not a hobo. Or are you? A dirty, uncouth homeless bitch with a pretty pretty face?\u201d He gave her a condescending smile.</p><p>She bit her lip.</p><p>\u201cYou can keep them off if you like. If so, this stops now. You can find your own way home. No treats for you.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in breath, and for a second, he thought she would tell him where to go and stalk off. Pleasure flooded his limbs when she nodded and put on the purposefully uncomfortable shoes.</p><p>\u201cWise choice,\u201d he said, and patted her long, silky red hair. When the manager turned away to speak to the receptionist, he slid his fingers in the hair at the back of her head and pulled firmly. She gasped, and her blue eyes went cloudy as the pain aroused her. He let go and wiped his hand on his pants. There was once a time when that look would make his cock hard almost immediately. But it wasn\u2019t working so well anymore, which made him meaner.</p><p>He was feeling very mean right now. He watched as the woman sat down, and waited five beats.</p><p>\u201cGet your ass up. You did not ask permission to sit,\u201d he said. His voice was quiet, but laced with just the right amount of venom. She popped up, and her face twitched with pain. Tears rimmed her lovely cornflower eyes. He stepped on her foot, putting his whole weight on it. She bit back a groan, and the water in her eyes threatened to spill over. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare ruin your makeup with pointless tears. You don\u2019t want to look a mess, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she breathed. He moved his foot, and she exhaled slowly. When her eyes focused in his face, they were full of surrender. She wanted validation. He did an about face, and the manager and receptionist pretended they didn\u2019t see a thing.</p><p>\u201cGet my car. My ward is aching to get out of here,\u201d he said to the manager. She called the valet service and avoided his gaze. \u00a0He walked to to the revolving doors, not looking back. The woman limped behind him, but she knew not to call out. She caught up to him as the valet brought his midnight blue Aston Martin Vanquish around.</p><p>She smiled. He rolled his eyes. He didn\u2019t get the car to impress silly twats like her. He got the car because he appreciated the gracefulness of its lines, and the almost nonexistent purr of the engine. It was a mechanical marvel, a paragon of order. Now, she almost ruined it. It irritated him.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550<br/></p><p><b>Want more?

Just &hellip; fair warning.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#9552;&#9552;&#9552;&#9552;&#9552;&#9552;&#9552;&#9552;&#9552;&#9552;&#9552;&#9552;&#9552;&#9552;&#9552;&#9552;&#9552;&#9552;<br /></i></p><p>&ldquo;How was everything, Mr. Valkenberg?&rdquo; the young woman at reception asked. He eyed her sourly. Her hair, loose and frizzy, poofed around her head in a bob. Her lemon yellow highlights made his mouth water with disgust. She was messy.</p><p>&ldquo;Passable,&rdquo; he said, taking back his black card and putting it in his wallet. It gave him pleasure to see the girl&rsquo;s mouth move silently. Her tiny pig eyes bugged out.</p><p>&ldquo;Sir, if there is anything additional we can do next time to make your stay more pleasant-&rdquo;</p><p>He held his hand up. She stopped talking immediately. He smoothed the front of his shirt.</p><p>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t be necessary, because I will not be coming back,&rdquo; he said. The girl&rsquo;s eyes watered.</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>&ldquo;Please, Mr. Valkenberg. I will get the manager. We will make it right, no matter what!&rdquo; She waved her arm wildly at the beautifully suited woman approaching, curious about the intense conversation. She took one look at Valkenberg and put on her most unctuous grin.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello, sir. I trust you enjoyed your stay in your eponymous suite?&rdquo; The receptionist&rsquo;s eyes bugged out further.</p><p>&ldquo;No, madam, I did not,&rdquo; he said, squaring up. The woman&rsquo;s face twitched.</p><p>&ldquo;May I ask why? We strive to give every single one of our guests-&rdquo;</p><p>Again, he held his hand up for silence. The manager&rsquo;s mouth snapped shut.</p><p>&ldquo;Dust. In the carpets, and on the windowsills and shelves. The sheets were unironed, and dubious at best. The sink had fingerprints, and there was mold-&rdquo; he got really close to her, and his brown eyes widened with indignation -&rdquo;slimy black mold in the shower. The amenities are black marble, but that does not mean they don&rsquo;t need to be properly scrubbed and sanitized.&rdquo;</p><p>The woman&rsquo;s face steadily got redder and redder, but she remained quiet. He got steadily angrier as he spoke.</p><p>&ldquo;Just because we&rsquo;re in a backwoods wilderness does not give your establishment carte blanche to cut corners,&rdquo; he hissed. &ldquo;Especially after how much I paid for one night. It&rsquo;s disgusting.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sir, I deeply apologize for our negligence. At least three generations of Valkenbergs have stayed in our hotel when visiting the Pacific Northwest in that very suite, and we are determined to make it memorable.&rdquo;</p><p>His eyes drifted to the woman fidgeting by the sitting area. She took off her stilettos and rubbed her raw toes on the oriental carpet. She closed her eyes and sighed with relief. His mouth twisted with displeasure.</p><p>Uncultured bitch.</p><p>&ldquo;Sir? I will run a strict evaluation of all our current staff, and remove those who&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>He walked to his ward and pointed down at the floor. &ldquo;Put your shoes back on. Now!&rdquo;</p><p>She gave him a vacuous look. Pretty face, empty eyes. &ldquo;But these shoes are too small. They&rsquo;re killing me, baby.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not your baby,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Your feet will adjust. You will not walk around in public barefoot. You&rsquo;re not a hobo. Or are you? A dirty, uncouth homeless bitch with a pretty pretty face?&rdquo; He gave her a condescending smile.</p><p>She bit her lip.</p><p>&ldquo;You can keep them off if you like. If so, this stops now. You can find your own way home. No treats for you.&rdquo;</p><p>She sucked in breath, and for a second, he thought she would tell him where to go and stalk off. Pleasure flooded his limbs when she nodded and put on the purposefully uncomfortable shoes.</p><p>&ldquo;Wise choice,&rdquo; he said, and patted her long, silky red hair. When the manager turned away to speak to the receptionist, he slid his fingers in the hair at the back of her head and pulled firmly. She gasped, and her blue eyes went cloudy as the pain aroused her. He let go and wiped his hand on his pants. There was once a time when that look would make his cock hard almost immediately. But it wasn&rsquo;t working so well anymore, which made him meaner.</p><p>He was feeling very mean right now. He watched as the woman sat down, and waited five beats.</p><p>&ldquo;Get your ass up. You did not ask permission to sit,&rdquo; he said. His voice was quiet, but laced with just the right amount of venom. She popped up, and her face twitched with pain. Tears rimmed her lovely cornflower eyes. He stepped on her foot, putting his whole weight on it. She bit back a groan, and the water in her eyes threatened to spill over. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare ruin your makeup with pointless tears. You don&rsquo;t want to look a mess, do you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she breathed. He moved his foot, and she exhaled slowly. When her eyes focused in his face, they were full of surrender. She wanted validation. He did an about face, and the manager and receptionist pretended they didn&rsquo;t see a thing.</p><p>&ldquo;Get my car. My ward is aching to get out of here,&rdquo; he said to the manager. She called the valet service and avoided his gaze. &nbsp;He walked to to the revolving doors, not looking back. The woman limped behind him, but she knew not to call out. She caught up to him as the valet brought his midnight blue Aston Martin Vanquish around.</p><p>She smiled. He rolled his eyes. He didn&rsquo;t get the car to impress silly twats like her. He got the car because he appreciated the gracefulness of its lines, and the almost nonexistent purr of the engine. It was a mechanical marvel, a paragon of order. Now, she almost ruined it. It irritated him.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#9552;&#9552;&#9552;&#9552;&#9552;&#9552;&#9552;&#9552;&#9552;&#9552;&#9552;&#9552;&#9552;&#9552;&#9552;&#9552;&#9552;&#9552;<br /></p><p><b>Want more?
