Robert never passes up the chance to tease you both and embarrass you.</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>You were on set of <i>Avengers: Endgame, </i>visiting your boyfriend, Chris Evans, who was hard at work playing the role of Captain America. You loved being there and watching him do what he loved. It was also very bittersweet because it was the last time he would be playing the role of Captain America. He was excited about moving on to new things, but you could also tell that he was quite emotional about it.</p><p>You and Chris had been together for almost two years. You&rsquo;d known each other much longer, however. Your father was Robert Downey Jr. He&rsquo;d had you from a previous relationship that didn&rsquo;t work out. You were mostly raised by your father so you two were close. You visited him on the sets of his movies so you&rsquo;d known Chris from visiting your father while he was filming for the Avengers movies. You and Chris had become fast friends and it stayed that way for years until you both realized that there was something more between you.</p><p>The scene ended and Chris came over to where you were stood. He was dressed in his Captain America suit, making you feel some type of way. Let&rsquo;s just say that suit did him some favors in the ass department. Scott Lang, Paul Rudd, did say it best after all&hellip;that&rsquo;s America&rsquo;s ass.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, sweetheart,&rdquo; Chris greeted you with a peck to your lips. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you were here already.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I snuck in,&rdquo; you told him as you smiled at him. &ldquo;Lucky for me too because you <i>know </i>what that suit does to me.&rdquo;</p><p>Chris smirked and you could see him blushing as he leaned down to kiss you. If only he had his beard. Of course you preferred Chris either way, but that beard&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;And just <i>what </i>does that suit do to you?&rdquo; You heard someone say.</p><p>You pulled away from Chris as your eyes widened. You turned your head and found your father stood there, arms crossed with a look on his face. You blushed as you pulled away from Chris. Your father seemed to always pop up at the most awkward times.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, dad,&rdquo; you greeted your father as you smiled awkwardly at him. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t know you were filming today.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am, which is pretty lucky for you, right?&rdquo; He asked as he stepped over to you and put his arm around your shoulders. &ldquo;Chris, buddy, I&rsquo;m going to need you to <i>not </i>hog my daughter today, okay? I barely get to spend any time with her anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I literally ate lunch with you yesterday,&rdquo; you told your father, shaking your head at his antics.</p><p>Your father never passed up the opportunity to mess with Chris or tease him. It was like that before you and Chris even started dating, but it increased after that. He took it with ease though. He actually thought it was pretty funny. Plus, he loved you and he could handle it.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make it sound like such a chore,&rdquo; your father replied, jokingly. &ldquo;I was wondering if you two would like to go out to dinner with me and Susan tonight. You should really get to know your in-laws, Chris, since you and my daughter are practically married.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dad,&rdquo; you hissed out and blushed.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; He asked, acting clueless. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a fact.

I hope you enjoy!<br/></p><p><b>Summary:</b> Just a slice of life featuring your husband, daughter, and dog. Oh, did I mention that your husband is Chris Evans? <i>Yup, I got your attention now</i>. - It\u2019s your Anniversary and Chris asked for a weekend together, just you and him.</p><p><b>Word Count: </b>2K</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"framespace:R_L3J5dToU5PEgozSn0saQ:ZC2Zef2V5IlJX\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/38d7112be7e9732889d69d1246f1c167/tumblr_p42aahGIQC1viv1s4o1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"500\"/></figure><!-- more --><p><br/></p><p>\u201cY/N, we\u2019re going to be late!\u201d Chris called from somewhere downstairs.<b><br/></b></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m almost done!\u201d I shouted towards the direction of the stairs leading downstairs loud enough for him to hear. Was two hours too much to ask for me to get ready? It was our night together for the first time in forever and I wanted to make sure that I looked perfect.</p><p>Thanks to the courtesy of Chris complaining for the third week about how we needed a weekend between us for our Anniversary, Emily, our daughter, was at her grandparents&rsquo; house with Dodger. After seeing him pout around the house, I finally gave in last week. A weekend together didn\u2019t sound like a bad idea. Plus, it was our Anniversary.</p><p>After applying a little bit of gloss on top of my nude lipstick, I ran into the closet. I pulled the little black dress from the hiding spot and slipped it on. I\u2019ve had eyes on this dress since last month and tonight&rsquo;s dinner was going to be its debut.<br/></p><p>\u201cY/N, we\u2019re spending the weekend in bed if you don\u2019t hurry up!\u201d Chris called again.</p><p>I reached behind to zip up the dress and quickly realized my arm was only flexible to a certain angle. I needed Chris to help me with the rest. Rushing out of the closet, I quickly found the pair of black stilettos and stuck them on my feet and headed down the stairs.</p><p>Halfway down, I quickly realized the lights were dimmed on the entire first floor. Confused, I took each step slowly as my heels clicked softly with each step. The last 3 steps of the stairs had candles lining the sides of it. Pass the candlelit stairs, I saw why the rest of the house was so dim. Lit candles of all sizes and all shades of white filled up every inch of the house. The sweet fragrance from the candles surrounded the space around you as I looked around in awe. <b>It was so beautiful.</b></p><p>From the other end of the house, Chris appeared in a fitted black velvet suit with a matching skinny black tie. He had a wide grin on his face and he walked over to me with his fancy black shoes softly tapping against the dark hardwood floor. In his left hand, he was holding onto a bouquet of red roses surrounded by a cloud of baby\u2019s breath.</p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d he said as he reached out his right hand to you.</p><p>I met his warm touch with my hand as I took a step closer to him. He handed the bouquet to me and I gave him a small thank you peck. The red roses in the center were shaped into a heart and the contrasting white fluff made the heart shape even more prominent. I brought the flowers up to my nose and sniffed the floral scent before placing it down on the stairs behind me.</p><p>\u201cChris, did you do all of this?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean\u2026 I don\u2019t-\u201d I stumbled around my words trying to find the right words. \u201cChris, I don&rsquo;t know what to say&hellip;<b>I\u2019m speechless</b>,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know how I could describe what I was seeing right now. Did he know that the lantern scene in Tangled was my favorite? How did he get all these candles in here while I was getting ready? There were so many thoughts running through my mind.</p><p>\u201cHm, that\u2019s funny,\u201d he smiled.</p><p>I put a hold on my inside thoughts and looked up at him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly how I feel when I see you, like right now for example,\u201d he said looking at my eyes.</p><p>I felt my heart race as I was standing there, truly speechless. From his eyes, I saw the same look in his eyes that I saw during our first exchange of hello years ago. It was filled with anticipation, confidence, and a hint of nervousness.</p><p>I laced my fingers in between his. \u201cYou know that\u2019s exactly how you looked at me when we first met?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I?\u201d He asked, clearly amused by the thought I remembered how he looked at me when we first met. \u201cI must have fallen in love with you at first sight then.\u201d</p><p>My face was uncontrollably warm as I diverted my eyes from him to cool off. I wanted to cover my cheeks with my hands and hide my thumping heart that I knew he could hear at this point. Since we met, my friends always believed that Chris had me in a trance. <i>Crazy, I know.</i> But, I had some good evidence to back up my claims. For example, I hated the thought of spending a summer day under the sun. My justification was why go outside if I had a functioning AC at home? But now, I make the effort to make sure Emily gets a chance to be outside whenever the weather allows. I hated Disney movies and classics and only watched action films. Now, Chris, Emily, Dodger, and I gather around our TV every Friday to see who memorized the most lines from every Disney classic. I should also mention how\u00a0<i>I\u2019ve been beating Chris at his own game.</i></p><p>\u201cMrs. Evans,\u201d he whispered as he placed his other hand on my chin and slowly turned my head to face him. As I caught his long eyelashes and blue eyes, my breath was kicked out of my lungs. \u201cYou know, I can just stare at you all day like this.\u201d</p><p>Pulling my hand from his, I wrapped my arms around his neck and his hands followed, gently landing on my hips. \u201cThat\u2019s what I was thinking about you just now,\u201d I whispered. \u201cAre you sure you can\u2019t read my mind?\u201d</p><p>His grip tensed around me as he exhaled in frustration.<br/></p><p>\u201cIf I kiss you right now, I know I won\u2019t be able to stop myself.\u201d He answered, leaning his head towards me.</p><p>I smiled remembering all the times our makeout sessions turned into something more at random places. Let\u2019s just say, we were VIP members of the Mile High Club.</p><p>\u201cWell, if you help me zip up this dress, we can go out for dinner.\u201d</p><p>Pulling away from him, I swept my hair to the side. I turned around so that my halfway zipped dress was facing him.</p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d I heard him say as his hand touched my zipper. He held onto the zipper and leaned close to me. His head burrowed into my shoulders and his lips grazed the sensitive skin on my neck.</p><p>\u201cChris,\u201d I warned.</p><p>Despite the not-so-intimidating warning, the zipper slowly moved down, unzipping the dress. When the zipper reached the end by my lower back, Chris\u2019 hand moved onto my bare back. I felt his hot longing touch against my warm skin.</p><p>\u201cBaby,\u201d he whispered, his warm breath embracing my skin. His finger traced down my back, over my vertebrae. <i>He knew what that did to me.</i> As I turned, I reached out for his face with my hands and locked my lips with his. Our kiss quickly ignited into a hot mess as his tongue explored every part of my mouth and mine did the same. By the time we pulled away, my dress was barely holding on, stretched over my shoulders. We were both exhaling irregularly to catch our breaths.</p><p>\u201cHold on, before this I still have something to show you,\u201d he said as he took off his suit jacket and placed it over my shoulders. It wasn\u2019t like him to get distracted from what was going to happen soon and change subjects. He took my hand and pulled me along. As I followed behind him, I was mesmerized by the way candles lit up our shared space in the loving light.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay, you have to close your eyes from here.\u201d I did what I was told and closed my eyes. I heard his footsteps move behind me. I felt his hands over my eyes, covering them. \u201cSlowly, take one step at a time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, am I walking to a fire pit of doom?\u201d I asked, carefully taking one step at a time as he said. When I took a step, he followed right behind me.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he laughed.</p><p>I stopped abruptly in place and Chris\u2019 body made a soft thud against my back. \u201cOkay, okay. I\u2019m joking, he said. \u201cPlus, I won\u2019t let that happen to you.\u201d</p><p>Satisfied with his answer, I continued to walk with his footsteps right behind mine like a shadow.</p><p>As we continued to walk, Chris was directing me when to take a big step or a small step. From my memory of the house layout, I knew that we were headed for the backyard door. He asked me to step over the door ledge carefully and I immediately felt the warm summer night breeze blowing on my face.</p><p>\u201cOkay. stop.\u201d He whispered.</p><p>\u201cCan I open my eyes now?\u201d I questioned moving my hands over his on top of my head.</p><p>\u201cIf you can answer this question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I have to answer in Jeopardy form?\u201d I asked and he made a small \u201chm\u201d as he was seriously contemplating it.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered eventually and I giggled at his adorableness.</p><p>\u201cOkay, bring it,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Y/N,\u201d he paused for a second. \u201cDo you love me?\u201d</p><p>I was so confused by the easy question that I didn\u2019t know if it was meant to be a trick question. I felt his silver band around the fourth finger of his left hand with my hand.</p><p>\u201cYes, I love you, Christopher Robert Evans,\u201d I replied confidently.</p><p>\u201cGood to know,\u201d he said.

On the first note, the lanterns started to lift up to the sky in concert. The midnight blue sky was filled with warm lights that slowly drifted up the sky lighting up the path.

Was two hours too much to ask for me to get ready? It was our night together for the first time in forever and I wanted to make sure that I looked perfect.</p><p>Thanks to the courtesy of Chris complaining for the third week about how we needed a weekend between us for our Anniversary, Emily, our daughter, was at her grandparents\u2019 house with Dodger. After seeing him pout around the house, I finally gave in last week. A weekend together didn\u2019t sound like a bad idea. Plus, it was our Anniversary.</p><p>After applying a little bit of gloss on top of my nude lipstick, I ran into the closet. I pulled the little black dress from the hiding spot and slipped it on. I\u2019ve had eyes on this dress since last month and tonight\u2019s dinner was going to be its debut.<br></p><p>\u201cY/N, we\u2019re spending the weekend in bed if you don\u2019t hurry up!\u201d Chris called again.</p><p>I reached behind to zip up the dress and quickly realized my arm was only flexible to a certain angle. I needed Chris to help me with the rest. Rushing out of the closet, I quickly found the pair of black stilettos and stuck them on my feet and headed down the stairs.</p><p>Halfway down, I quickly realized the lights were dimmed on the entire first floor. Confused, I took each step slowly as my heels clicked softly with each step. The last 3 steps of the stairs had candles lining the sides of it. Pass the candlelit stairs, I saw why the rest of the house was so dim. Lit candles of all sizes and all shades of white filled up every inch of the house. The sweet fragrance from the candles surrounded the space around you as I looked around in awe. <b>It was so beautiful.</b></p><p>From the other end of the house, Chris appeared in a fitted black velvet suit with a matching skinny black tie. He had a wide grin on his face and he walked over to me with his fancy black shoes softly tapping against the dark hardwood floor. In his left hand, he was holding onto a bouquet of red roses surrounded by a cloud of baby\u2019s breath.</p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d he said as he reached out his right hand to you.</p><p>I met his warm touch with my hand as I took a step closer to him. He handed the bouquet to me and I gave him a small thank you peck. The red roses in the center were shaped into a heart and the contrasting white fluff made the heart shape even more prominent. I brought the flowers up to my nose and sniffed the floral scent before placing it down on the stairs behind me.</p><p>\u201cChris, did you do all of this?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean\u2026 I don\u2019t-\u201d I stumbled around my words trying to find the right words. \u201cChris, I don\u2019t know what to say\u2026<b>I\u2019m speechless</b>,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know how I could describe what I was seeing right now. Did he know that the lantern scene in Tangled was my favorite? How did he get all these candles in here while I was getting ready? There were so many thoughts running through my mind.</p><p>\u201cHm, that\u2019s funny,\u201d he smiled.</p><p>I put a hold on my inside thoughts and looked up at him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly how I feel when I see you, like right now for example,\u201d he said looking at my eyes.</p><p>I felt my heart race as I was standing there, truly speechless. From his eyes, I saw the same look in his eyes that I saw during our first exchange of hello years ago. It was filled with anticipation, confidence, and a hint of nervousness.</p><p>I laced my fingers in between his. \u201cYou know that\u2019s exactly how you looked at me when we first met?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I?\u201d He asked, clearly amused by the thought I remembered how he looked at me when we first met. \u201cI must have fallen in love with you at first sight then.\u201d</p><p>My face was uncontrollably warm as I diverted my eyes from him to cool off. I wanted to cover my cheeks with my hands and hide my thumping heart that I knew he could hear at this point. Since we met, my friends always believed that Chris had me in a trance. <i>Crazy, I know.</i> But, I had some good evidence to back up my claims. For example, I hated the thought of spending a summer day under the sun. My justification was why go outside if I had a functioning AC at home? But now, I make the effort to make sure Emily gets a chance to be outside whenever the weather allows. I hated Disney movies and classics and only watched action films. Now, Chris, Emily, Dodger, and I gather around our TV every Friday to see who memorized the most lines from every Disney classic. I should also mention how\u00a0<i>I\u2019ve been beating Chris at his own game.</i></p><p>\u201cMrs. Evans,\u201d he whispered as he placed his other hand on my chin and slowly turned my head to face him. As I caught his long eyelashes and blue eyes, my breath was kicked out of my lungs. \u201cYou know, I can just stare at you all day like this.\u201d</p><p>Pulling my hand from his, I wrapped my arms around his neck and his hands followed, gently landing on my hips. \u201cThat\u2019s what I was thinking about you just now,\u201d I whispered. \u201cAre you sure you can\u2019t read my mind?\u201d</p><p>His grip tensed around me as he exhaled in frustration.<br></p><p>\u201cIf I kiss you right now, I know I won\u2019t be able to stop myself.\u201d He answered, leaning his head towards me.</p><p>I smiled remembering all the times our makeout sessions turned into something more at random places. Let\u2019s just say, we were VIP members of the Mile High Club.</p><p>\u201cWell, if you help me zip up this dress, we can go out for dinner.\u201d</p><p>Pulling away from him, I swept my hair to the side. I turned around so that my halfway zipped dress was facing him.</p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d I heard him say as his hand touched my zipper. He held onto the zipper and leaned close to me. His head burrowed into my shoulders and his lips grazed the sensitive skin on my neck.</p><p>\u201cChris,\u201d I warned.</p><p>Despite the not-so-intimidating warning, the zipper slowly moved down, unzipping the dress. When the zipper reached the end by my lower back, Chris\u2019 hand moved onto my bare back. I felt his hot longing touch against my warm skin.</p><p>\u201cBaby,\u201d he whispered, his warm breath embracing my skin. His finger traced down my back, over my vertebrae. <i>He knew what that did to me.</i> As I turned, I reached out for his face with my hands and locked my lips with his. Our kiss quickly ignited into a hot mess as his tongue explored every part of my mouth and mine did the same. By the time we pulled away, my dress was barely holding on, stretched over my shoulders. We were both exhaling irregularly to catch our breaths.</p><p>\u201cHold on, before this I still have something to show you,\u201d he said as he took off his suit jacket and placed it over my shoulders. It wasn\u2019t like him to get distracted from what was going to happen soon and change subjects. He took my hand and pulled me along. As I followed behind him, I was mesmerized by the way candles lit up our shared space in the loving light.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay, you have to close your eyes from here.\u201d I did what I was told and closed my eyes. I heard his footsteps move behind me. I felt his hands over my eyes, covering them. \u201cSlowly, take one step at a time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, am I walking to a fire pit of doom?\u201d I asked, carefully taking one step at a time as he said. When I took a step, he followed right behind me.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he laughed.</p><p>I stopped abruptly in place and Chris\u2019 body made a soft thud against my back. \u201cOkay, okay. I\u2019m joking, he said. \u201cPlus, I won\u2019t let that happen to you.\u201d</p><p>Satisfied with his answer, I continued to walk with his footsteps right behind mine like a shadow.</p><p>As we continued to walk, Chris was directing me when to take a big step or a small step. From my memory of the house layout, I knew that we were headed for the backyard door. He asked me to step over the door ledge carefully and I immediately felt the warm summer night breeze blowing on my face.</p><p>\u201cOkay. stop.\u201d He whispered.</p><p>\u201cCan I open my eyes now?\u201d I questioned moving my hands over his on top of my head.</p><p>\u201cIf you can answer this question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I have to answer in Jeopardy form?\u201d I asked and he made a small \u201chm\u201d as he was seriously contemplating it.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered eventually and I giggled at his adorableness.</p><p>\u201cOkay, bring it,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Y/N,\u201d he paused for a second. \u201cDo you love me?\u201d</p><p>I was so confused by the easy question that I didn\u2019t know if it was meant to be a trick question. I felt his silver band around the fourth finger of his left hand with my hand.</p><p>\u201cYes, I love you, Christopher Robert Evans,\u201d I replied confidently.</p><p>\u201cGood to know,\u201d he said. The way he said it, I knew that he was grinning.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite Disney movie?\u201d</p><p>Without hesitation, I answered. \u201cTangl-\u201d</p><p>His hands left my face and my eyes immediately started to well up with tears overwhelmed by emotions. In our own backyard, hundreds of light lanterns laid scattered in front of us. Then, from somewhere behind me, the music to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chDDxukoT1M\">Tangled\u2019s \u2018I See The Light\u2019</a> started to play. On the first note, the lanterns started to lift up to the sky in concert. The midnight blue sky was filled with warm lights that slowly drifted up the sky lighting up the path. I felt a light tap on my arm and I looked over at Chris with a light lantern in his hands.</p><p>I smiled at him, wiping the happy tears from my face. \u201cChris,\u201d I managed to say to get out before I ended up bursting into a stream of tears. He looked down at the lantern and I placed my hands by his. The warmth of the candle against the delicate paper embraced the palm of my hands.</p><p>\u201c<i>Now she\u2019s here shining in the starlight</i>,\u201d he started reciting the lines to the song I knew so well. He was so corny and I loved him for it. \u201c<i>Now she\u2019s here suddenly I know.

For example, I hated the thought of spending a summer day under the sun. My justification was why go outside if I had a functioning AC at home? But now, I make the effort to make sure Emily gets a chance to be outside whenever the weather allows. I hated Disney movies and classics and only watched action films. Now, Chris, Emily, Dodger, and I gather around our TV every Friday to see who memorized the most lines from every Disney classic. I should also mention how\u00a0<i>I\u2019ve been beating Chris at his own game.</i></p><p>\u201cMrs. Evans,\u201d he whispered as he placed his other hand on my chin and slowly turned my head to face him. As I caught his long eyelashes and blue eyes, my breath was kicked out of my lungs. \u201cYou know, I can just stare at you all day like this.\u201d</p><p>Pulling my hand from his, I wrapped my arms around his neck and his hands followed, gently landing on my hips. \u201cThat\u2019s what I was thinking about you just now,\u201d I whispered. \u201cAre you sure you can\u2019t read my mind?\u201d</p><p>His grip tensed around me as he exhaled in frustration.<br></p><p>\u201cIf I kiss you right now, I know I won\u2019t be able to stop myself.\u201d He answered, leaning his head towards me.</p><p>I smiled remembering all the times our makeout sessions turned into something more at random places. Let\u2019s just say, we were VIP members of the Mile High Club.</p><p>\u201cWell, if you help me zip up this dress, we can go out for dinner.\u201d</p><p>Pulling away from him, I swept my hair to the side. I turned around so that my halfway zipped dress was facing him.</p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d I heard him say as his hand touched my zipper. He held onto the zipper and leaned close to me. His head burrowed into my shoulders and his lips grazed the sensitive skin on my neck.</p><p>\u201cChris,\u201d I warned.</p><p>Despite the not-so-intimidating warning, the zipper slowly moved down, unzipping the dress. When the zipper reached the end by my lower back, Chris\u2019 hand moved onto my bare back. I felt his hot longing touch against my warm skin.</p><p>\u201cBaby,\u201d he whispered, his warm breath embracing my skin. His finger traced down my back, over my vertebrae. <i>He knew what that did to me.</i> As I turned, I reached out for his face with my hands and locked my lips with his. Our kiss quickly ignited into a hot mess as his tongue explored every part of my mouth and mine did the same. By the time we pulled away, my dress was barely holding on, stretched over my shoulders. We were both exhaling irregularly to catch our breaths.</p><p>\u201cHold on, before this I still have something to show you,\u201d he said as he took off his suit jacket and placed it over my shoulders. It wasn\u2019t like him to get distracted from what was going to happen soon and change subjects. He took my hand and pulled me along. As I followed behind him, I was mesmerized by the way candles lit up our shared space in the loving light.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay, you have to close your eyes from here.\u201d I did what I was told and closed my eyes. I heard his footsteps move behind me. I felt his hands over my eyes, covering them. \u201cSlowly, take one step at a time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, am I walking to a fire pit of doom?\u201d I asked, carefully taking one step at a time as he said. When I took a step, he followed right behind me.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he laughed.</p><p>I stopped abruptly in place and Chris\u2019 body made a soft thud against my back. \u201cOkay, okay. I\u2019m joking, he said. \u201cPlus, I won\u2019t let that happen to you.\u201d</p><p>Satisfied with his answer, I continued to walk with his footsteps right behind mine like a shadow.</p><p>As we continued to walk, Chris was directing me when to take a big step or a small step. From my memory of the house layout, I knew that we were headed for the backyard door. He asked me to step over the door ledge carefully and I immediately felt the warm summer night breeze blowing on my face.</p><p>\u201cOkay. stop.\u201d He whispered.</p><p>\u201cCan I open my eyes now?\u201d I questioned moving my hands over his on top of my head.</p><p>\u201cIf you can answer this question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I have to answer in Jeopardy form?\u201d I asked and he made a small \u201chm\u201d as he was seriously contemplating it.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered eventually and I giggled at his adorableness.</p><p>\u201cOkay, bring it,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Y/N,\u201d he paused for a second. \u201cDo you love me?\u201d</p><p>I was so confused by the easy question that I didn\u2019t know if it was meant to be a trick question. I felt his silver band around the fourth finger of his left hand with my hand.</p><p>\u201cYes, I love you, Christopher Robert Evans,\u201d I replied confidently.</p><p>\u201cGood to know,\u201d he said. The way he said it, I knew that he was grinning.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite Disney movie?\u201d</p><p>Without hesitation, I answered. \u201cTangl-\u201d</p><p>His hands left my face and my eyes immediately started to well up with tears overwhelmed by emotions. In our own backyard, hundreds of light lanterns laid scattered in front of us. Then, from somewhere behind me, the music to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chDDxukoT1M\">Tangled\u2019s \u2018I See The Light\u2019</a> started to play. On the first note, the lanterns started to lift up to the sky in concert. The midnight blue sky was filled with warm lights that slowly drifted up the sky lighting up the path. I felt a light tap on my arm and I looked over at Chris with a light lantern in his hands.</p><p>I smiled at him, wiping the happy tears from my face. \u201cChris,\u201d I managed to say to get out before I ended up bursting into a stream of tears. He looked down at the lantern and I placed my hands by his. The warmth of the candle against the delicate paper embraced the palm of my hands.</p><p>\u201c<i>Now she\u2019s here shining in the starlight</i>,\u201d he started reciting the lines to the song I knew so well. He was so corny and I loved him for it. \u201c<i>Now she\u2019s here suddenly I know. If she\u2019s here it\u2019s crystal clear, I\u2019m where I\u2019m meant to go</i>.\u201d He smiled and glanced down at the lantern.</p><p>I replied to his lines, <b>\u201cNow that I see you.\u201d</b></p><p>We both let go and the lantern slowly floated to the top. I stared at it as it went up and joined the rest of the other lanterns in the sky. When I looked over at Chris, he was already staring at me. Our gazes met and I threw myself into his arms.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>He wrapped his arms around me and held me close against his body. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>When I looked up and he kissed my forehead. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to cry, it was a nice surprise\u201d he smiled.</p><p>\u201cShhh,\u201d I said to him, embarrassed. \u201cTangled is my favorite movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, in that case\u2026 did I mention that \u201850 Shades of Gray\u2019 is my favorite movie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChris,\u201d I nudged him back playfully. \u201cWell, we can make that happen anytime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight,\u201d he whispered as he leaned in for my lips. His lips were delicate, different from our kiss before, as it grazed over mine. He inhaled my breath and our lips entwined as we drowned into our version of a romantic kiss. I heard the song fade away in the background as I reached for him and pulled him deeper into our own perfect Disney love story.</p>",

I hope you enjoy!<br /></p><p><b>Summary:</b> Just a slice of life featuring your husband, daughter, and dog. Oh, did I mention that your husband is Chris Evans? <i>Yup, I got your attention now</i>. - It&rsquo;s your Anniversary and Chris asked for a weekend together, just you and him.</p><p><b>Word Count: </b>2K</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, we&rsquo;re going to be late!&rdquo; Chris called from somewhere downstairs.<b><br /></b></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost done!&rdquo; I shouted towards the direction of the stairs leading downstairs loud enough for him to hear. Was two hours too much to ask for me to get ready? It was our night together for the first time in forever and I wanted to make sure that I looked perfect.</p><p>Thanks to the courtesy of Chris complaining for the third week about how we needed a weekend between us for our Anniversary, Emily, our daughter, was at her grandparents&rsquo; house with Dodger. After seeing him pout around the house, I finally gave in last week. A weekend together didn&rsquo;t sound like a bad idea. Plus, it was our Anniversary.</p><p>After applying a little bit of gloss on top of my nude lipstick, I ran into the closet. I pulled the little black dress from the hiding spot and slipped it on. I&rsquo;ve had eyes on this dress since last month and tonight&rsquo;s dinner was going to be its debut.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, we&rsquo;re spending the weekend in bed if you don&rsquo;t hurry up!&rdquo; Chris called again.</p><p>I reached behind to zip up the dress and quickly realized my arm was only flexible to a certain angle. I needed Chris to help me with the rest. Rushing out of the closet, I quickly found the pair of black stilettos and stuck them on my feet and headed down the stairs.</p><p>Halfway down, I quickly realized the lights were dimmed on the entire first floor. Confused, I took each step slowly as my heels clicked softly with each step. The last 3 steps of the stairs had candles lining the sides of it. Pass the candlelit stairs, I saw why the rest of the house was so dim. Lit candles of all sizes and all shades of white filled up every inch of the house. The sweet fragrance from the candles surrounded the space around you as I looked around in awe. <b>It was so beautiful.</b></p><p>From the other end of the house, Chris appeared in a fitted black velvet suit with a matching skinny black tie. He had a wide grin on his face and he walked over to me with his fancy black shoes softly tapping against the dark hardwood floor. In his left hand, he was holding onto a bouquet of red roses surrounded by a cloud of baby&rsquo;s breath.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N,&rdquo; he said as he reached out his right hand to you.</p><p>I met his warm touch with my hand as I took a step closer to him. He handed the bouquet to me and I gave him a small thank you peck. The red roses in the center were shaped into a heart and the contrasting white fluff made the heart shape even more prominent. I brought the flowers up to my nose and sniffed the floral scent before placing it down on the stairs behind me.</p><p>&ldquo;Chris, did you do all of this?&rdquo; I whispered.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you like it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I mean&hellip; I don&rsquo;t-&rdquo; I stumbled around my words trying to find the right words. &ldquo;Chris, I don&rsquo;t know what to say&hellip;<b>I&rsquo;m speechless</b>,&rdquo; I muttered.</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t know how I could describe what I was seeing right now. Did he know that the lantern scene in Tangled was my favorite? How did he get all these candles in here while I was getting ready? There were so many thoughts running through my mind.</p><p>&ldquo;Hm, that&rsquo;s funny,&rdquo; he smiled.</p><p>I put a hold on my inside thoughts and looked up at him.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly how I feel when I see you, like right now for example,&rdquo; he said looking at my eyes.</p><p>I felt my heart race as I was standing there, truly speechless. From his eyes, I saw the same look in his eyes that I saw during our first exchange of hello years ago. It was filled with anticipation, confidence, and a hint of nervousness.</p><p>I laced my fingers in between his. &ldquo;You know that&rsquo;s exactly how you looked at me when we first met?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did I?&rdquo; He asked, clearly amused by the thought I remembered how he looked at me when we first met. &ldquo;I must have fallen in love with you at first sight then.&rdquo;</p><p>My face was uncontrollably warm as I diverted my eyes from him to cool off. I wanted to cover my cheeks with my hands and hide my thumping heart that I knew he could hear at this point. Since we met, my friends always believed that Chris had me in a trance. <i>Crazy, I know.</i> But, I had some good evidence to back up my claims.
