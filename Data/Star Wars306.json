        "body": "<p>\n\nWhat i want to happen is that the next movie has a time jump of a month or two, the resistance have set up a base and Rey goes on different missions to find force wielders to keep safe and help. The First Order haven&rsquo;t looked for the resistance or bothered to kill them all, Kylo has realised there is a bigger mission he needs to complete, which is policing the galaxy. Honestly i really don\u2019t want Snoke to be alive in the next film. As a force ghost maybe but not actually alive tbh not in the film at all. I want Kylo to be ruling and Rey and Ben to continue to have these force connections where they appear to each other. Ben struggles to rule on his own and he asks her in one of the force connections why she had rejected him so harshly, whether she intended to kill him or not. They argue and Rey says if she wanted him dead, she would have done it when he was unconscious, she lets it slip that she has woken up and run to check that he was still alive before she left for Crait. She also tells him that she couldn&rsquo;t kill him even if he wanted to\u00a0 but he just passes it off as her wanting to be a Jedi. She doesn&rsquo;t continue to argue that she cant kill him not because of the Jedi ways but because she feels it would destroy her very being and will to live. It would be cool to have obi wan and Yoda come to Rey and help her discover more about her life, personally i like the idea that shes a no body that was left on Jakku, and i want Anakin and Luke to go to Kylo. They explain the balance and when Ben and Rey next see each other, they realise they are the ones who need to bring the balance to the galaxy but they don\u2019t acknowledge it to each other, but they do try and read each others mind if they think the same thing. Rey is hesitant because she still doesn&rsquo;t know what Ben really wants for the galaxy, to rule it or police it. That force connection ends and in the night they both get visions of the same vision they had from the last Jedi when they touched hands, them both standing together side by side, at the time of the last Jedi, they both saw it as trying to pull each over to either the light side or the dark side. They begin to think that the force actually needs them together to bring balance. Kylo already has admitted to himself, Anakin and Luke that she is the light that creates conflict in him, and he admits he feels something towards her. Rey struggles because she feels like she cant tell Finn, Poe and Rose because they wont understand the conflict she feels. Rey goes on a mission the next day to find more force users, going back to Canto bight (Where that boy with the force lives that we saw at the end of the last Jedi) and that when she and Ben come face to face. He is already there with the child and she thinks hes going to try and take him to be a slave for the first order and they fight. Rey shows her blue (Maybe yellow?) double bladed lightsaber and they duel. But when their lightsabers touch, a spark is let out and their lightsabers turn to a grey white colour, the force telling them that they are the ones who need to bring balance. Ben immediately thinks this. Rey is angry that her lightsaber has changed and she blames it on him. Ben pins Rey to the wall and tries to calm her, and he tells her how he feels and that he cant help be completely drawn to her and that she means a lot to him, that he would give her the galaxy if she wanted it. Rey cries from a mixture of her own feelings, conflict and longing to be loved and cared for. They look into each others eyes and share a kiss, (Cheesy i know but sweet and romantic). A pulse is sent into the galaxy and everything goes silent. The balancing of the force has begun. Luke, Anakin, Obi wan and Yoda all appear to them both telling them that this is their calling and that it wont be easy but this is what the force needs. There will always be times when it becomes unbalanced and its their job to ensure its balanced again, going round together, keeping the peace side by side, the resistance and first order coming together to create \u2018The New Order\u2019. A time jump happens, 3-5 years later and the vision of them standing side by side looking out to a sunset holding hands.

            "comment": "<p>\n\nWhat i want to happen is that the next movie has a time jump of a month or two, the resistance have set up a base and Rey goes on different missions to find force wielders to keep safe and help. The First Order haven\u2019t looked for the resistance or bothered to kill them all, Kylo has realised there is a bigger mission he needs to complete, which is policing the galaxy. Honestly i really don\u2019t want Snoke to be alive in the next film. As a force ghost maybe but not actually alive tbh not in the film at all. I want Kylo to be ruling and Rey and Ben to continue to have these force connections where they appear to each other. Ben struggles to rule on his own and he asks her in one of the force connections why she had rejected him so harshly, whether she intended to kill him or not. They argue and Rey says if she wanted him dead, she would have done it when he was unconscious, she lets it slip that she has woken up and run to check that he was still alive before she left for Crait. She also tells him that she couldn\u2019t kill him even if he wanted to\u00a0 but he just passes it off as her wanting to be a Jedi. She doesn\u2019t continue to argue that she cant kill him not because of the Jedi ways but because she feels it would destroy her very being and will to live. It would be cool to have obi wan and Yoda come to Rey and help her discover more about her life, personally i like the idea that shes a no body that was left on Jakku, and i want Anakin and Luke to go to Kylo. They explain the balance and when Ben and Rey next see each other, they realise they are the ones who need to bring the balance to the galaxy but they don\u2019t acknowledge it to each other, but they do try and read each others mind if they think the same thing. Rey is hesitant because she still doesn\u2019t know what Ben really wants for the galaxy, to rule it or police it. That force connection ends and in the night they both get visions of the same vision they had from the last Jedi when they touched hands, them both standing together side by side, at the time of the last Jedi, they both saw it as trying to pull each over to either the light side or the dark side. They begin to think that the force actually needs them together to bring balance. Kylo already has admitted to himself, Anakin and Luke that she is the light that creates conflict in him, and he admits he feels something towards her. Rey struggles because she feels like she cant tell Finn, Poe and Rose because they wont understand the conflict she feels. Rey goes on a mission the next day to find more force users, going back to Canto bight (Where that boy with the force lives that we saw at the end of the last Jedi) and that when she and Ben come face to face. He is already there with the child and she thinks hes going to try and take him to be a slave for the first order and they fight. Rey shows her blue (Maybe yellow?) double bladed lightsaber and they duel. But when their lightsabers touch, a spark is let out and their lightsabers turn to a grey white colour, the force telling them that they are the ones who need to bring balance. Ben immediately thinks this. Rey is angry that her lightsaber has changed and she blames it on him. Ben pins Rey to the wall and tries to calm her, and he tells her how he feels and that he cant help be completely drawn to her and that she means a lot to him, that he would give her the galaxy if she wanted it. Rey cries from a mixture of her own feelings, conflict and longing to be loved and cared for. They look into each others eyes and share a kiss, (Cheesy i know but sweet and romantic). A pulse is sent into the galaxy and everything goes silent. The balancing of the force has begun. Luke, Anakin, Obi wan and Yoda all appear to them both telling them that this is their calling and that it wont be easy but this is what the force needs. There will always be times when it becomes unbalanced and its their job to ensure its balanced again, going round together, keeping the peace side by side, the resistance and first order coming together to create \u2018The New Order\u2019. A time jump happens, 3-5 years later and the vision of them standing side by side looking out to a sunset holding hands.

It had been\u2026a long time since you had been here. It used to be a regular spot for you. The baristas and servers knew you by name. Hell, you even met some of your best friends from being a regular. The caf\u00e9 was your spot, your corner to relax and be with your thoughts. You never thought you\u2019d leave the place.</p><p>That was, until, your previous partner broke up with you.</p><p>You felt like dirt, to put kindly. You couldn\u2019t face the world in your hurting state. There were days where your heart ached so much that you wouldn\u2019t even leave your bed. Curling into yourself was a regular occurrence.</p><p>Of course your friends tried to help. They would stay on the phone listening to you cry. A few times, they came over to make sure you were eating. They were helping your through getting over him. They all knew how unexpected the break up had been for you.</p><p>Eventually, enough was enough. You were sick of feeling broken, sick of feeling like something was missing, sick of feeling unwanted. To the world, it would have seemed like a switch was flicked.</p><p>You woke up on time and went through your usual routine. You played your favorite music that always could put a smile on your face. You cooked and ate; you returned to your normal.</p><p><i>Rain came pouring down when I was drowning<br/>That\u2019s when I could finally breathe<br/>And by morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean (Clean)</i><br/></p><p>Forcing a genuine smile, you walked up to the counter. The barista greeted you happily. You returned the sentiment and traded casual speak. You could tell they were a tad concerned, but their joy at seeing you again kept them from questioning. You appreciated it.</p><p>Once your order was in, you glanced around the shop. You smiled when you saw your usual corner open. Like always, you walked over and sat down. You pulled out your laptop and set up your little work station.</p><p>Knowing how long your drink usually took, you set to work right away.</p><p>As usual, you got a little too deep into your work. You were so focused that you didn\u2019t hear your friend call for you drink. Just as well, you didn\u2019t see them talking to a ginger and pointing in your direction.</p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d an unexpected voice piped up.</p><p>You jumped slightly while looking up. A man with ginger hair and blue eyes was calmly smiling down at you. He held a cup and a mug. He smirked when he realized how bewildered you looked.</p><p>\u201cMy apologies. I didn\u2019t mean to frighten you,\u201d he started,\u00a0\u201cYour friend asked me to bring your drink over since you didn\u2019t hear them.\u201d<br/>You blushed from embarrassment.\u00a0\u201cOh crud! Uh, thank you. You didn\u2019t have to do that.\u201d<br/>\u201cAnd let your drink get cold?\u201d he teased, setting down your mug,\u00a0\u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine a worse torture.\u201d<br/>You chuckled.\u00a0\u201cThen I\u2019ll spare you the details of my late nights here.\u201d<br/></p><p>He let out a laugh of his own, one that fluttered your stomach. He glanced around a moment, thinking of his next words. He lowered his gaze.</p><p>\u201cWould it be all right if I joined you?\u201d<br/>You grinned.\u00a0\u201cOf course!\u201d You yanked your bag from the chair.\u00a0\u201cHave a seat. I\u2019m Y/N, obviously.\u201d<br/>He grinned.\u00a0\u201cArmitage. So you\u2019re a regular?\u201d<br/>You nodded.\u00a0\u201cFor the most part. I was\u2026gone for a stretch, but I\u2019m back to working and it feels-\u201d<br/>\u201cRefreshing?\u201d<br/>You titled your head to the side.\u00a0\u201cYeah. How did you\u2026\u201d<br/>He lowered his gaze again.\u00a0\u201cI\u2026I recently went through a rough patch of my own. Returning to normal feels relieving.\u201d<br/>You nodded.\u00a0\u201cCouldn\u2019t agree more.\u201d</p><p>The two of you continued on talking. There might have been only a small bit of work done, but you couldn\u2019t care less. In the moment, neither of you wanted a relationship. However, you two did want a friendship. So, for awhile one, the two of you met at the coffee shop each day. You\u2019d talk about anything and everything until Armitage had to go. Then you\u2019d work.</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t be for another couple of years until you, on one fateful night, acted on the growing feelings in your core. That night was filled with a passion that carried your blooming relationship.</p><p><i>And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid<br/>I think it\u2019s strange that you think I\u2019m funny \u2018cause he never did<br/>I\u2019ve been spending the last eight months<br/>Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end<br/>But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again (Begin Again)</i><br/></p></blockquote><p><i>Perma-tags: <a></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-68KujyzwQLby23TmkAzXw\">@beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep</a> <a></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGnRvcQInOgbRYK4js9l55Q\">@ttelesilla</a> @jumperswellies <a></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPKafYnyixN5fVyDrM5A7mQ\">@caitsymichelle13</a> <a></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDrUqw8AhW4lfhwOJvNukAA\">@frostbyte-horan</a> <a></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/me6kgnW6oIwTa-RKv-Xlibg\">@bestillmystuckyheart</a>\u200b <a></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6JrH0mInv0_jJIQb7ThoRQ\">@littlestfangirl</a>\u200b <a></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhzYxjQcnUFNPCI68g6pgrA\">@anali-022506</a>\u200b <a></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6xMfKFmw_U3e1P1wlJFR9Q\">@krylo-rxn</a>\u200b <a></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6-bf6s2SIze9i8e1xmhBzg\">@ilovetvshowsblog</a>\u200b <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTAUNGqx8Qq3sz7TCcD06ww\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTAUNGqx8Qq3sz7TCcD06ww\">@yllwtaxi</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzKnf5L15KlP69Jb0EAMXRg\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzKnf5L15KlP69Jb0EAMXRg\">@mimikyu-of-death</a><br/>Semi-tags: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mztWAQ9xeKFu35MEDPKC9zQ\">@bi-shy-and-ready-to-die</a></i></p><p><b><a href=\"http://silentwaters4.tumblr.com/ask\">Request Here</a> ; <a href=\"http://silentwaters4.tumblr.com/submit\">Submit Here</a></b></p>",
