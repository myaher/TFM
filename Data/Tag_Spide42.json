Why would you do that?\u201d she said in a horrified voice.</p><p>\u201cOw! Ow, heyy!

He chuckled quietly\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry, you just seemed scared and it\u2019s dark so I thought I could walk you to your home.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSorry spider-man but how do I know that you\u2019re not some old creep? What am I supposed to do just give you my adress? Do you want my security number too while you\u2019re at it?\u201d Peter was truly offended but then he remembered how he kept the secret from you so he softened.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want you to walk home on your own, I swear I\u2019m not a creep, please just let me walk you home safely.\u201d you looked up at him admiring him and for some reason you felt like you could trust him.</p><p>After a few tries of him trying to make you accept it you finally gave in and he helped you get home safely,most of the way you walked and chatted he was quite fun to talk with but when both of you got kinda tired from walking he decided to take you by your waist and take you home in a much faster way. Him holding you while shooting webs and screaming\u00a0\u201cWOOO!\u201d was one of the best things that happened to you and considering how shitty your day went this whole thing felt really nice to you.</p><p>As Peter finally dropped you of on home by the window safely, he looked at you one last time and said\u00a0\u201cSee you later, uhm, what\u2019s your name?\u201d he said pretending his best to not know you.\u00a0\u201cUh-, it\u2019s Y/N.\u201d you smiled up at him\u00a0\u201cIt was nice chatting up with you but I\u2019ve gotta a whole city to save, see you later Y/N. \u201d you watched as he kept shooting webs and screaming\u00a0\u201cWOOO!\u201d once again making you giggle.\u00a0\u201cSee you later,spidey.\u201d</p><p>You were so tired. so tired.
