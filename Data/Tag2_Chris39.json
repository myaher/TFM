I realized that I would (eventually) like other guys and get over my broken heart. And, of course, I did.</p><p><br /></p><p>Over the years, I&rsquo;ve read interviews where he&rsquo;s open about his anxiety and depression. Knowing that someone so talented and successful has the same illnesses that I do helps, even though I&rsquo;d never wish either illness on anyone (but especially not the combination).</p><p><br /></p><p>I follow him on Twitter, and I love how&nbsp;outspoken he is about his beliefs. He seems to always do and say what he believes is right, and I&nbsp;love that. I love that he&rsquo;s not just about making money&hellip;.he&rsquo;s genuine, and he&rsquo;s deep. He really is/was the perfect choice for Captain America.</p><p><br /></p><p>I don&rsquo;t give a shit how corny that sounds. I just really fucking appreciate Chris Evans.</p>",

Chris was over, as always, claiming he didn\u2019t have anything better to do at home and ended up driving to your house. It wasn\u2019t unusual for him to be at your house, in fact he was always at your house. It\u2019s like a second home to him, he had some spare clothes hidden in the guest bedroom <i>(although some of his hoodies somehow made its way into your closet, don\u2019t know why lol)</i>, and some of his favorite snacks were stashed in your kitchen cabinets.                     </p><p>You and Chris have been friends for a good few years. You guys met on the set of the first Avengers movie. After RDJ introduced you to each other, you guys hit it off, starting a friendship that would last a long time. You\u2019d be lying if you said you didn\u2019t have feelings for him. But you did, and you couldn\u2019t help it. Chris is just an amazing guy with the most purest personality, who was also a mix of dork and frat boy. Little did you know, he was feeling the same.</p><p>Chris stared at you from across the room. You were going through your phone, your eyebrows crinkled together. He loved the way your hair was pulled to one side and fell so naturally against your neck. </p><p>\u201cYou wanna order some food? I\u2019d suggest cooking, but that ended badly the last time we tried it.\u201d You asked glancing up from your phone. Before you looked at him, Chris moved his gaze to the tv, which was playing some new show you were obsessed with. </p><p>Chris chuckled as he remembered the big mess you two left in your kitchen. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s a smart idea.\u201d </p><p>You tapped the Uber Eats app and opened it up. \u201cSo, what are we in the mood for Christopher? Chinese? Mexican? Ooo, how about some good ol\u2019 McDonald\u2019s? Jennifer mentioned this restaurant with some kickass Italian food, should we try it out?\u201d You kept on suggesting things waiting for Chris\u2019s reply. But you were met with silence. You looked up and saw Chris gazing at you from the other couch across from you. He was leaning back on one of his arms with his legs resting on the couch.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d You asked playfully, squinting your eyes at him. \u201cIs there something on my face?\u201d You asked again. A smile formed onto his lips as he shook his head. </p><p>\u201cNo. I-I just-\u201c he stuttered out, struggling a bit with his words. Your phone\u2019s screen dimmed as you waited for him to finish his sentence. </p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d He blurted out. You were taken aback by his sudden confession. Your mouth gaped as you stared back at him. </p><p>\u201cOh- wow.\u201d You managed to let out. You couldn\u2019t believe it, Chris just said he loved you. But your mind was all over the place. Did he mean it as a friend? Or did he mean that he loves you loves you? Like as in relationship wise.</p><p>Chris got up from his seat and ran a hand through his hair, and scratched his his newly grown beard. \u201cI was just- I mean- Ah fahk that was stupid.\u201d He said, his Boston accent slipping out. He squeezed his eyes shut as if he were trying to make himself disappear from the situation. He opened his eyes and shook himself a bit, and sent you a reassuring smile. Besides your current situation, you thought he looked adorable when he was all flustered and embarrassed. </p><p>\u201cNo- I don\u2019t love you.\u201d He said pointing at you.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d You asked, a bit confused. Your heart felt like it was falling out of your body.</p><p>\u201cNO! I mean-\u201cHe yelled out after seeing your face drop.</p><p>\u201cI do love you! Yeah, I do, I love you a lot- Ah shit.\u201d He groaned throwing both his hands and head back. A soft smile made its way to your lips. \u201cYou\u2019re, you\u2019re doing great.\u201d You assured him. </p><p>\u201cI just- that was unexpected. I don\u2019t know what to-\u201c you explained but Chris cut you off. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, really. You know what? You order the food, and I\u2019ll be in the bathroom. Yeah.\u201d He confirmed before rushing to your bathroom. When you heard the door shut you sat back into your couch with a stupid grin on your face. You bit your bottom lip, trying to stop, but your face wouldn\u2019t allow you. Your stomach felt like there was a zoo of butterflies let loose in it and you felt like you were on cloud 9. </p><p>\u201cOh my god.\u201d You breathed out as you shoved a pillow onto your face before squealing into it. He just said he loved you. What the hell are you doing on the couch, tell him you love him dumbass, your inner conscience yelled at yourself. You hopped up from your spot and ran to your bathroom. </p><p>\u201cFuck fuck fuck fuck fuck. You stupid asshole, you can\u2019t just say that to her out of no where. God, you screwed it up. You meatball, you screwed everything up with her.\u201d You heard Chris whisper harshly to himself. You heard somthing getting hit, making you more concerned to what was happening inside. </p><p>You took a deep breath and knocked on the door. The footsteps inside came to a halt. </p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d </p><p>\u201cCan you open the door?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d  He answered, his voice a bit pitched. </p><p>\u201cChristopher Robert Evans, this is my house.\u201d You heard the door unlock. The door opened and revealed Chris. He forehead looked a bit red. </p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d He greeted you, his shoulders a bit tensed. You smiled and leaned against the door way. </p><p>\u201cHi. Quite a show you put on back there.\u201d He groaned and placed his head against the door. </p><p>\u201cLook. I know it came out of no where, but I\u2019ve loved you for a long ass time. And I\u2019ve been such a pussy because it took me this long to tell you and I fucked it up. I just like you a lot. You\u2019re so caring and nice to everybody. But you\u2019re also independent and you don\u2019t let anybody stop you from doing things you want to do. And I admire you for that. You\u2019re just- you. And I love every little thing about you.\u201d He confessed. </p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d You answered. There\u2019s wasn\u2019t anything left to say, technically you were speechless, the man you loved just admitted that he loved you back. But you ended up saying what you\u2019ve always wanted to tell him. The two of you just stood there staring at each other. </p><p>\u201cC\u2019mere you.\u201d Chris muttered and grabbed you by the waist. Your hands locked around his neck. He brushed a few strands of hair off your face before leaning in. You closed your eyes and met him in the middle. The kiss was soft, gentle even, but full of emotion. </p><p>\u201cGod, I\u2019ve wanted to do for such a long time.\u201d Chris breathed out after you two broke your kiss. </p><p>You glanced at his forehead, \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want any ice for that?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNah, but a kiss\u2019ll do.\u201d He winked leaning forward to your face. </p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>\u2022</p><p>I hope you guys liked this. I know my writing is a bit iffy, bear with me please I\u2019m trying my best out here. </p>",

Chris was over, as always, claiming he didn\u2019t have anything better to do at home and ended up driving to your house. It wasn\u2019t unusual for him to be at your house, in fact he was always at your house. It\u2019s like a second home to him, he had some spare clothes hidden in the guest bedroom <i>(although some of his hoodies somehow made its way into your closet, don\u2019t know why lol)</i>, and some of his favorite snacks were stashed in your kitchen cabinets.                     </p><p>You and Chris have been friends for a good few years. You guys met on the set of the first Avengers movie. After RDJ introduced you to each other, you guys hit it off, starting a friendship that would last a long time. You\u2019d be lying if you said you didn\u2019t have feelings for him. But you did, and you couldn\u2019t help it. Chris is just an amazing guy with the most purest personality, who was also a mix of dork and frat boy. Little did you know, he was feeling the same.</p><p>Chris stared at you from across the room. You were going through your phone, your eyebrows crinkled together. He loved the way your hair was pulled to one side and fell so naturally against your neck. </p><p>\u201cYou wanna order some food? I\u2019d suggest cooking, but that ended badly the last time we tried it.\u201d You asked glancing up from your phone. Before you looked at him, Chris moved his gaze to the tv, which was playing some new show you were obsessed with. </p><p>Chris chuckled as he remembered the big mess you two left in your kitchen. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s a smart idea.\u201d </p><p>You tapped the Uber Eats app and opened it up. \u201cSo, what are we in the mood for Christopher? Chinese? Mexican? Ooo, how about some good ol\u2019 McDonald\u2019s? Jennifer mentioned this restaurant with some kickass Italian food, should we try it out?\u201d You kept on suggesting things waiting for Chris\u2019s reply. But you were met with silence. You looked up and saw Chris gazing at you from the other couch across from you. He was leaning back on one of his arms with his legs resting on the couch.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d You asked playfully, squinting your eyes at him. \u201cIs there something on my face?\u201d You asked again. A smile formed onto his lips as he shook his head. </p><p>\u201cNo. I-I just-\u201c he stuttered out, struggling a bit with his words. Your phone\u2019s screen dimmed as you waited for him to finish his sentence. </p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d He blurted out. You were taken aback by his sudden confession. Your mouth gaped as you stared back at him. </p><p>\u201cOh- wow.\u201d You managed to let out. You couldn\u2019t believe it, Chris just said he loved you. But your mind was all over the place. Did he mean it as a friend? Or did he mean that he loves you loves you? Like as in relationship wise.</p><p>Chris got up from his seat and ran a hand through his hair, and scratched his his newly grown beard. \u201cI was just- I mean- Ah fahk that was stupid.\u201d He said, his Boston accent slipping out. He squeezed his eyes shut as if he were trying to make himself disappear from the situation. He opened his eyes and shook himself a bit, and sent you a reassuring smile. Besides your current situation, you thought he looked adorable when he was all flustered and embarrassed. </p><p>\u201cNo- I don\u2019t love you.\u201d He said pointing at you.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d You asked, a bit confused. Your heart felt like it was falling out of your body.</p><p>\u201cNO! I mean-\u201cHe yelled out after seeing your face drop.</p><p>\u201cI do love you! Yeah, I do, I love you a lot- Ah shit.\u201d He groaned throwing both his hands and head back. A soft smile made its way to your lips. \u201cYou\u2019re, you\u2019re doing great.\u201d You assured him. </p><p>\u201cI just- that was unexpected. I don\u2019t know what to-\u201c you explained but Chris cut you off. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, really. You know what? You order the food, and I\u2019ll be in the bathroom. Yeah.\u201d He confirmed before rushing to your bathroom. When you heard the door shut you sat back into your couch with a stupid grin on your face. You bit your bottom lip, trying to stop, but your face wouldn\u2019t allow you. Your stomach felt like there was a zoo of butterflies let loose in it and you felt like you were on cloud 9. </p><p>\u201cOh my god.\u201d You breathed out as you shoved a pillow onto your face before squealing into it. He just said he loved you. What the hell are you doing on the couch, tell him you love him dumbass, your inner conscience yelled at yourself. You hopped up from your spot and ran to your bathroom. </p><p>\u201cFuck fuck fuck fuck fuck. You stupid asshole, you can\u2019t just say that to her out of no where. God, you screwed it up. You meatball, you screwed everything up with her.\u201d You heard Chris whisper harshly to himself. You heard somthing getting hit, making you more concerned to what was happening inside. </p><p>You took a deep breath and knocked on the door. The footsteps inside came to a halt. </p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d </p><p>\u201cCan you open the door?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d  He answered, his voice a bit pitched. </p><p>\u201cChristopher Robert Evans, this is my house.\u201d You heard the door unlock. The door opened and revealed Chris. He forehead looked a bit red. </p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d He greeted you, his shoulders a bit tensed. You smiled and leaned against the door way. </p><p>\u201cHi. Quite a show you put on back there.\u201d He groaned and placed his head against the door. </p><p>\u201cLook. I know it came out of no where, but I\u2019ve loved you for a long ass time. And I\u2019ve been such a pussy because it took me this long to tell you and I fucked it up. I just like you a lot. You\u2019re so caring and nice to everybody. But you\u2019re also independent and you don\u2019t let anybody stop you from doing things you want to do. And I admire you for that. You\u2019re just- you. And I love every little thing about you.\u201d He confessed. </p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d You answered. There\u2019s wasn\u2019t anything left to say, technically you were speechless, the man you loved just admitted that he loved you back. But you ended up saying what you\u2019ve always wanted to tell him. The two of you just stood there staring at each other. </p><p>\u201cC\u2019mere you.\u201d Chris muttered and grabbed you by the waist. Your hands locked around his neck. He brushed a few strands of hair off your face before leaning in. You closed your eyes and met him in the middle. The kiss was soft, gentle even, but full of emotion. </p><p>\u201cGod, I\u2019ve wanted to do for such a long time.\u201d Chris breathed out after you two broke your kiss. </p><p>You glanced at his forehead, \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want any ice for that?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNah, but a kiss\u2019ll do.\u201d He winked leaning forward to your face. </p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>\u2022</p><p>I hope you guys liked this.

The lights were off as you placed your keys on the table, trying to make the least noise possible. The only hint of life were the footsteps in the kitchen, stepping back and forth. Footsteps you would recognise anywhere. Your body began to shake as you stepped towards the ajar door, pushing it open to see a familiar silhouette facing away from you. A pale blue, checkered shirt and jeans framed his figure perfectly, and his dirty blonde hair sat atop his tired face. </p><p>\tTears pricked at your eyes as you took the sight of him in. He had been away for weeks on a mission, with no idea of when he would return. You had spoken to him briefly on the phone, but it couldn\u2019t be the same as seeing him in person. You took a deep breath before walking towards him slowly, your footsteps almost silent. Upon reaching him, you wrapped your arms around his waist and pressed your face in between his shoulder blades, just breathing in his scent. Feeling him sent you overboard, tears falling onto your cheeks as you smiled into his back, the world finally seeming at peace.</p><p>\tSteve placed his hands atop yours and waited for a moment, before turning to see your face. He looked down at you, his blue eyes sparkling in the evening light streaming through the window. He tucked a finger underneath your chin, encouraging you to look up at him. Your eyelashes were wet as you peered up at him, his unshaven face smiling back down at you.</p><p>\t\u201cHey babe,\u201d he spoke, his voice gravelly and intimate. </p><p>\tYou smiled up at him, \u201cYou\u2019re home.\u201d The sentence was simple, but filled with love. He wrapped his arms around your waist, pulling you close to him and you slinked your arms around his neck. You played with the hair at the nape of his neck and pulled him towards you. Your eyes fluttered shut as your lips met, soft and familiar. You could feel Steve\u2019s eyelashes against your face, and you were sure he could feel the tears which left your eyes. Your lips moved together gracefully, as though you had never been apart. Your hands slid from Steve\u2019s neck across his shoulders and down his chest, as his stroked up and down your hips. You grabbed fistfuls of his shirt and pulled him deeper into the kiss. </p><p>\tSteve walked you backwards to the island in the centre of the kitchen. When your butt touched it, he wrapped his arms around your waist and lifted you to sit on it. He stood between your legs, still entirely lost in the passion you shared. You tightened your legs around his hips, your feet meeting in the middle as you drew him as close to you as physically possible. Your hands repositioned themselves on his chest before sliding down to the hem of his shirt. Steve pulled away for a second to whip off his shirt, allowing you to admire his chest before he placed his hands on your hips.</p><p>\t\u201cI was away for far too long,\u201d he whispered, groaning at the sight of you still fully clothed. He ran his fingers along the hem of your shirt, and it was gone within a second. You grabbed him by the belt loops and kissed him again, this time filled with lust. You felt his hips grind against yours as he moaned into the kiss, causing you to smirk. His hands trailed from your back to your thighs, his grip tightening as you felt him harder underneath you.</p><p>\t\u201cAre we doing this here, <i>Captain</i>?\u201d you asked, feigning innocence. You knew exactly how the final word would affect Steve, and it proved correct as his eyes just about rolled into the back of his head. Instead of giving you an answer, he reached his hands under your ass and lifted you, pressing kisses to your exposed collarbone. The skin-on-skin contact and the soft bites he left along your skin made your head fall back as you breathed a soft sigh. <i>This</i>. This was the difference between in person and over the phone. Not just the sex, but the connection.</p><p>\tYou barely noticed as the record continued to play and transitioned into the next song. It was still an old song, likely from Steve\u2019s original era, but had a much more sultry, sexy feel. Steve placed you down onto the bed, your legs still wrapped around his waist. You rolled your hips into his, eliciting a moan as Steve\u2019s hands roamed to the waistband of your pants. You lifted your body, allowing him to remove your clothing, leaving you almost naked on the bed. Your hands trailed down Steve\u2019s exposed chest, reaching his jeans and unbuttoning them. They slid to the floor with a thud, and Steve was left in only his boxers, which didn\u2019t do a good job of hiding his arousal. </p><p>\tYou reached into Steve\u2019s boxers, wrapping your hand lightly around his length. He groaned at the touch before removing his boxers entirely. You began to move your hand, slowly but surely, and he shivered in anticipation. You flipped so that Steve was sat on the bed, with you on your hands and knees before him. You lowered your head to his member, still pumping with your hand. You left a sloppy trail of kisses down his shaft before kissing the tip, drawing out a moan from his lips. You licked up the underside of his cock before taking him in your mouth. You moved yourself along him, up and down, moaning and sending vibrations along his shaft, making him call out in pleasure. </p><p>\tAs Steve could feel himself rising, he pulled away and spoke, \u201cYour turn, baby.\u201d He lifted you and lay you on the bed before trailing kisses down your chest, your stomach before reaching the waistband of your underwear. He looked up at you, checking if you were okay. You gave him a nod and he ripped off the layer of lace, admiring you with wide eyes. He had missed this. He kissed down your hips, landing between your thighs. He traced a finger along your folds, and you bit your lip at the familiar feeling. He flicked your clit, sending tremors up your body. You shivered from arousal, rolling your hips to show your weakness. Steve chuckled, a deep sound as you thrived underneath him. \u201cHold on baby, you know I\u2019m gonna do it well.\u201d</p><p>\tHe slipped a single finger into you, drawing out a moan, low and guttural. He used his other hand to lift your leg over his shoulder, giving you a perfect view of his eyes as he looked up at you. Maintaining eye contact, he bent his head down to lick at your clit. The sight was almost too much for you, making you arch your back and bite your lower lip. He added another finger, pulsing in and out of you, curling to hit the best spot. Moans and grunts slipped out from your lips, despite your best efforts to keep them quiet. </p><p>\t\u201cNo, darling, I want to hear you,\u201d Steve grumbled, sending vibrations across your body and making your legs shake. You moaned loudly in response, causing Steve to smirk. He went back to work, his licks and nips becoming rougher as you reached your climax. You cried out his name when you came, and Steve rose back up to capture your lips as you rode out your high on his fingers. Your kisses were passionate, fiery. </p><p>\t\u201cPlease,\u201d you whimpered, your body still trembling from your orgasm. \u201cPlease, fuck me.\u201d</p><p>\tSteve moaned and attacked your neck, sucking and leaving bruises across your chest. You could feel his erection against your thigh, and reached down to stroke it. Steve groaned against your skin and pulled away, looking deep into your eyes. \t</p><p>\t\u201cYou sure you\u2019re good with this?\u201d he asked, and you could see the lust in his eyes.</p><p>\t\u201cYes,\u201d you breathed, wanting nothing more in that moment than to have him. </p><p>\tCarefully, Steve grabbed a condom from the bedside drawer and slipped it on. Aligning himself with you, Steve eased into you, allowing you time to adjust to his size. You reached up to his neck, pulling him down and crashing your lips together. The two of you moved in sync as he grinded further into you, until he bottomed out and pulled away to rock his hips back into you. You moved your hands up and down his back, leaving scratches as he grunted into the crook of your neck. One of his hands was in your hair, tangling and messing it as he lost himself in you entirely. You placed your hands on the small of his back, pressing him further into you. He lifted his head to kiss you, his kisses becoming sloppy as the two of you started to reach your high. He pulled out of you quickly, moving you so you were on top of him. \t</p><p>\tYou angled yourself correctly, and eased yourself down onto him. Your head rolled back as Steve\u2019s large hands were on your waist, gripping you tightly. You rocked your hips back and forward, Steve falling in sync with you. After a few moments, you could feel your orgasm building in your stomach.</p><p>\t\u201cSteve, I-\u201d you moaned, your hair flying around your face.</p><p>\t\u201cI know babe, me too,\u201d he spoke, his voice deep and gravelly.</p><p>\tYour stomach tightened as you let go, and your orgasm roared throughout your body.

The lights were off as you placed your keys on the table, trying to make the least noise possible. The only hint of life were the footsteps in the kitchen, stepping back and forth. Footsteps you would recognise anywhere. Your body began to shake as you stepped towards the ajar door, pushing it open to see a familiar silhouette facing away from you. A pale blue, checkered shirt and jeans framed his figure perfectly, and his dirty blonde hair sat atop his tired face. </p><p>\tTears pricked at your eyes as you took the sight of him in. He had been away for weeks on a mission, with no idea of when he would return. You had spoken to him briefly on the phone, but it couldn\u2019t be the same as seeing him in person. You took a deep breath before walking towards him slowly, your footsteps almost silent. Upon reaching him, you wrapped your arms around his waist and pressed your face in between his shoulder blades, just breathing in his scent. Feeling him sent you overboard, tears falling onto your cheeks as you smiled into his back, the world finally seeming at peace.</p><p>\tSteve placed his hands atop yours and waited for a moment, before turning to see your face. He looked down at you, his blue eyes sparkling in the evening light streaming through the window. He tucked a finger underneath your chin, encouraging you to look up at him. Your eyelashes were wet as you peered up at him, his unshaven face smiling back down at you.</p><p>\t\u201cHey babe,\u201d he spoke, his voice gravelly and intimate. </p><p>\tYou smiled up at him, \u201cYou\u2019re home.\u201d The sentence was simple, but filled with love. He wrapped his arms around your waist, pulling you close to him and you slinked your arms around his neck. You played with the hair at the nape of his neck and pulled him towards you. Your eyes fluttered shut as your lips met, soft and familiar. You could feel Steve\u2019s eyelashes against your face, and you were sure he could feel the tears which left your eyes. Your lips moved together gracefully, as though you had never been apart. Your hands slid from Steve\u2019s neck across his shoulders and down his chest, as his stroked up and down your hips. You grabbed fistfuls of his shirt and pulled him deeper into the kiss. </p><p>\tSteve walked you backwards to the island in the centre of the kitchen. When your butt touched it, he wrapped his arms around your waist and lifted you to sit on it. He stood between your legs, still entirely lost in the passion you shared. You tightened your legs around his hips, your feet meeting in the middle as you drew him as close to you as physically possible. Your hands repositioned themselves on his chest before sliding down to the hem of his shirt. Steve pulled away for a second to whip off his shirt, allowing you to admire his chest before he placed his hands on your hips.</p><p>\t\u201cI was away for far too long,\u201d he whispered, groaning at the sight of you still fully clothed. He ran his fingers along the hem of your shirt, and it was gone within a second. You grabbed him by the belt loops and kissed him again, this time filled with lust. You felt his hips grind against yours as he moaned into the kiss, causing you to smirk. His hands trailed from your back to your thighs, his grip tightening as you felt him harder underneath you.</p><p>\t\u201cAre we doing this here, <i>Captain</i>?\u201d you asked, feigning innocence. You knew exactly how the final word would affect Steve, and it proved correct as his eyes just about rolled into the back of his head. Instead of giving you an answer, he reached his hands under your ass and lifted you, pressing kisses to your exposed collarbone. The skin-on-skin contact and the soft bites he left along your skin made your head fall back as you breathed a soft sigh. <i>This</i>. This was the difference between in person and over the phone. Not just the sex, but the connection.</p><p>\tYou barely noticed as the record continued to play and transitioned into the next song. It was still an old song, likely from Steve\u2019s original era, but had a much more sultry, sexy feel. Steve placed you down onto the bed, your legs still wrapped around his waist. You rolled your hips into his, eliciting a moan as Steve\u2019s hands roamed to the waistband of your pants. You lifted your body, allowing him to remove your clothing, leaving you almost naked on the bed. Your hands trailed down Steve\u2019s exposed chest, reaching his jeans and unbuttoning them. They slid to the floor with a thud, and Steve was left in only his boxers, which didn\u2019t do a good job of hiding his arousal. </p><p>\tYou reached into Steve\u2019s boxers, wrapping your hand lightly around his length. He groaned at the touch before removing his boxers entirely. You began to move your hand, slowly but surely, and he shivered in anticipation. You flipped so that Steve was sat on the bed, with you on your hands and knees before him. You lowered your head to his member, still pumping with your hand. You left a sloppy trail of kisses down his shaft before kissing the tip, drawing out a moan from his lips. You licked up the underside of his cock before taking him in your mouth. You moved yourself along him, up and down, moaning and sending vibrations along his shaft, making him call out in pleasure. </p><p>\tAs Steve could feel himself rising, he pulled away and spoke, \u201cYour turn, baby.\u201d He lifted you and lay you on the bed before trailing kisses down your chest, your stomach before reaching the waistband of your underwear. He looked up at you, checking if you were okay. You gave him a nod and he ripped off the layer of lace, admiring you with wide eyes. He had missed this. He kissed down your hips, landing between your thighs. He traced a finger along your folds, and you bit your lip at the familiar feeling. He flicked your clit, sending tremors up your body. You shivered from arousal, rolling your hips to show your weakness. Steve chuckled, a deep sound as you thrived underneath him. \u201cHold on baby, you know I\u2019m gonna do it well.\u201d</p><p>\tHe slipped a single finger into you, drawing out a moan, low and guttural. He used his other hand to lift your leg over his shoulder, giving you a perfect view of his eyes as he looked up at you. Maintaining eye contact, he bent his head down to lick at your clit. The sight was almost too much for you, making you arch your back and bite your lower lip. He added another finger, pulsing in and out of you, curling to hit the best spot. Moans and grunts slipped out from your lips, despite your best efforts to keep them quiet. </p><p>\t\u201cNo, darling, I want to hear you,\u201d Steve grumbled, sending vibrations across your body and making your legs shake. You moaned loudly in response, causing Steve to smirk. He went back to work, his licks and nips becoming rougher as you reached your climax. You cried out his name when you came, and Steve rose back up to capture your lips as you rode out your high on his fingers. Your kisses were passionate, fiery. </p><p>\t\u201cPlease,\u201d you whimpered, your body still trembling from your orgasm. \u201cPlease, fuck me.\u201d</p><p>\tSteve moaned and attacked your neck, sucking and leaving bruises across your chest. You could feel his erection against your thigh, and reached down to stroke it. Steve groaned against your skin and pulled away, looking deep into your eyes. \t</p><p>\t\u201cYou sure you\u2019re good with this?\u201d he asked, and you could see the lust in his eyes.</p><p>\t\u201cYes,\u201d you breathed, wanting nothing more in that moment than to have him. </p><p>\tCarefully, Steve grabbed a condom from the bedside drawer and slipped it on. Aligning himself with you, Steve eased into you, allowing you time to adjust to his size. You reached up to his neck, pulling him down and crashing your lips together. The two of you moved in sync as he grinded further into you, until he bottomed out and pulled away to rock his hips back into you. You moved your hands up and down his back, leaving scratches as he grunted into the crook of your neck. One of his hands was in your hair, tangling and messing it as he lost himself in you entirely. You placed your hands on the small of his back, pressing him further into you. He lifted his head to kiss you, his kisses becoming sloppy as the two of you started to reach your high. He pulled out of you quickly, moving you so you were on top of him. \t</p><p>\tYou angled yourself correctly, and eased yourself down onto him. Your head rolled back as Steve\u2019s large hands were on your waist, gripping you tightly. You rocked your hips back and forward, Steve falling in sync with you. After a few moments, you could feel your orgasm building in your stomach.</p><p>\t\u201cSteve, I-\u201d you moaned, your hair flying around your face.</p><p>\t\u201cI know babe, me too,\u201d he spoke, his voice deep and gravelly.</p><p>\tYour stomach tightened as you let go, and your orgasm roared throughout your body. Steve thrusted one last time before falling back on the bed, sweat beading on his forehead. You rolled over, breathing heavy as you felt Steve\u2019s breath hot on your shoulder.

He ran his fingers along the hem of your shirt, and it was gone within a second. You grabbed him by the belt loops and kissed him again, this time filled with lust. You felt his hips grind against yours as he moaned into the kiss, causing you to smirk. His hands trailed from your back to your thighs, his grip tightening as you felt him harder underneath you.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Are we doing this here, <i>Captain</i>?&rdquo; you asked, feigning innocence. You knew exactly how the final word would affect Steve, and it proved correct as his eyes just about rolled into the back of his head. Instead of giving you an answer, he reached his hands under your ass and lifted you, pressing kisses to your exposed collarbone. The skin-on-skin contact and the soft bites he left along your skin made your head fall back as you breathed a soft sigh. <i>This</i>. This was the difference between in person and over the phone. Not just the sex, but the connection.</p><p>\tYou barely noticed as the record continued to play and transitioned into the next song. It was still an old song, likely from Steve&rsquo;s original era, but had a much more sultry, sexy feel. Steve placed you down onto the bed, your legs still wrapped around his waist. You rolled your hips into his, eliciting a moan as Steve&rsquo;s hands roamed to the waistband of your pants. You lifted your body, allowing him to remove your clothing, leaving you almost naked on the bed. Your hands trailed down Steve&rsquo;s exposed chest, reaching his jeans and unbuttoning them. They slid to the floor with a thud, and Steve was left in only his boxers, which didn&rsquo;t do a good job of hiding his arousal. </p><p>\tYou reached into Steve&rsquo;s boxers, wrapping your hand lightly around his length. He groaned at the touch before removing his boxers entirely. You began to move your hand, slowly but surely, and he shivered in anticipation. You flipped so that Steve was sat on the bed, with you on your hands and knees before him. You lowered your head to his member, still pumping with your hand. You left a sloppy trail of kisses down his shaft before kissing the tip, drawing out a moan from his lips. You licked up the underside of his cock before taking him in your mouth. You moved yourself along him, up and down, moaning and sending vibrations along his shaft, making him call out in pleasure. </p><p>\tAs Steve could feel himself rising, he pulled away and spoke, &ldquo;Your turn, baby.&rdquo; He lifted you and lay you on the bed before trailing kisses down your chest, your stomach before reaching the waistband of your underwear. He looked up at you, checking if you were okay. You gave him a nod and he ripped off the layer of lace, admiring you with wide eyes. He had missed this. He kissed down your hips, landing between your thighs. He traced a finger along your folds, and you bit your lip at the familiar feeling. He flicked your clit, sending tremors up your body. You shivered from arousal, rolling your hips to show your weakness. Steve chuckled, a deep sound as you thrived underneath him. &ldquo;Hold on baby, you know I&rsquo;m gonna do it well.&rdquo;</p><p>\tHe slipped a single finger into you, drawing out a moan, low and guttural. He used his other hand to lift your leg over his shoulder, giving you a perfect view of his eyes as he looked up at you. Maintaining eye contact, he bent his head down to lick at your clit. The sight was almost too much for you, making you arch your back and bite your lower lip. He added another finger, pulsing in and out of you, curling to hit the best spot. Moans and grunts slipped out from your lips, despite your best efforts to keep them quiet. </p><p>\t&ldquo;No, darling, I want to hear you,&rdquo; Steve grumbled, sending vibrations across your body and making your legs shake. You moaned loudly in response, causing Steve to smirk. He went back to work, his licks and nips becoming rougher as you reached your climax. You cried out his name when you came, and Steve rose back up to capture your lips as you rode out your high on his fingers. Your kisses were passionate, fiery. </p><p>\t&ldquo;Please,&rdquo; you whimpered, your body still trembling from your orgasm. &ldquo;Please, fuck me.&rdquo;</p><p>\tSteve moaned and attacked your neck, sucking and leaving bruises across your chest. You could feel his erection against your thigh, and reached down to stroke it. Steve groaned against your skin and pulled away, looking deep into your eyes. \t</p><p>\t&ldquo;You sure you&rsquo;re good with this?&rdquo; he asked, and you could see the lust in his eyes.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; you breathed, wanting nothing more in that moment than to have him. </p><p>\tCarefully, Steve grabbed a condom from the bedside drawer and slipped it on. Aligning himself with you, Steve eased into you, allowing you time to adjust to his size. You reached up to his neck, pulling him down and crashing your lips together. The two of you moved in sync as he grinded further into you, until he bottomed out and pulled away to rock his hips back into you. You moved your hands up and down his back, leaving scratches as he grunted into the crook of your neck. One of his hands was in your hair, tangling and messing it as he lost himself in you entirely. You placed your hands on the small of his back, pressing him further into you. He lifted his head to kiss you, his kisses becoming sloppy as the two of you started to reach your high. He pulled out of you quickly, moving you so you were on top of him. \t</p><p>\tYou angled yourself correctly, and eased yourself down onto him. Your head rolled back as Steve&rsquo;s large hands were on your waist, gripping you tightly. You rocked your hips back and forward, Steve falling in sync with you. After a few moments, you could feel your orgasm building in your stomach.</p><p>\t&ldquo;Steve, I-&rdquo; you moaned, your hair flying around your face.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I know babe, me too,&rdquo; he spoke, his voice deep and gravelly.</p><p>\tYour stomach tightened as you let go, and your orgasm roared throughout your body. Steve thrusted one last time before falling back on the bed, sweat beading on his forehead. You rolled over, breathing heavy as you felt Steve&rsquo;s breath hot on your shoulder. After a moment, you stood and padded to the bathroom. Upon returning, you dove under the covers, where Steve had his arms outstretched for you. He wrapped you in his tight embrace and pressed kisses to your face.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I missed you Stevie,&rdquo; you whispered, reaching up to brush a strand of hair out of his eyes. </p><p>\t&ldquo;I missed you too, (Y/N). I love you so much,&rdquo; Steve breathed, loud enough for only you to hear.</p><p>\t&ldquo;I love you too.&rdquo;</p>",
