We got this right?\u201d A question he posed to the lump, wriggling slightly against his chest, its little black wet nose poking at his neck. All he got in reply was a shrill whine and a languid lick. </p><p>\u201cGood enough.\u201d Nodding to himself, he tucked the furry lump more securely within the confines of his hoodie. With one hand under the puppy\u2019s bum, Jon slung his guitar case onto his shoulder, setting off down the street towards the quaint little ice cream parlour that he had come to love. The ice cream was delicious but it was for more than that. Hell, even his family knew about it. </p><p>His uncle had been badgering him so hard for frequenting \u201cenemy\u201d territory. Well, more like teasingly niggling him endlessly about going over whenever he could just so he could catch a glimpse of that pretty ice cream lady. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to see the competition again are you?\u201d Ned asked, flinging an arm around his nephew\u2019s shoulder and pulling the smaller man into a snug side hug. His prominent brows wriggled cheekily at Jon. Those kind knowing eyes of his uncle, gleaming with mirth always reminded him so much of his mother, Lyanna, Ned\u2019s baby sister. Under the scrutiny of their identical grey eyes, Jon always felt like a child. A boy who could keep no secrets from them. Their eyes saw right through him, always. </p><p>See, Jon\u2019s Uncle Ned was the current owner of the local diner and the bed and breakfast above it. It was a family run business passed down from his parents. Besides providing warm meals for the people, the diner was also well known for its range of milkshakes, warm dessert classics like their bestselling rhubarb pie and of course ice cream. It was a place that travellers who were passing through town loved and a place the town folk grew up with. Including, a certain pretty ice cream lady. </p><p>Since Dany opened her shop, the two establishments had started a friendly rivalry to see who could attract the most customers by the end of her first year. The time was almost up. Ned had been in the lead due to the fact that he had his diner and bed and breakfast to account for, but now Dany seemed to be catching up. Which may or may not be thanks to him secretly recommending his customers to visit her if they ever wanted a more modern twist to their frozen desserts. Ned wasn\u2019t one who particularly cared for winning. He only wanted his friend\u2019s little girl, whom he watched grow from a spirited little thing with skinned knees and leaves in her hair into a smart, capable young woman to strive and some competition would do her good. </p><p>\u201cWhen are you going to strike up a conversation with that girl, boy? Daenerys is not gonna wait forever!\u201d Ned yelled out at Jon as he made his way to the door.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re indicating at. I\u2019m just going for a walk with Ghost, uncle.\u201d Jon feigned ignorance, feeling rather flushed and discomfited. Was he really that obvious? Ned\u2019s bellowing laughter followed him as the diner door shut behind him. </p><p><i>Daenerys. Dany, the other lady at the shop had called her. </i></p><p>She was the most beautiful woman he\u2019d ever seen. Jon was sure she could have her pick of any man anywhere. Would she even want to bat an eye in his direction? A lady like her must be accustomed to all manner of pursuits from men. What if him going after her would be unwelcome? What if she found him too forward and he\u2019d just chase her away? She might even be taken already! The thought had his heart clenching unpleasantly. For now, he was content with just admiring her from afar and dreaming of how their future interactions would go. Moreover, if he kept going, she was bound to take his order one day, right? That would be a start. </p><p>The second day he arrived at the town he had only heard his parents wistfully reminisce about through the stories they told him regarding his extended family, Jon went out exploring with his camera. Taking in the sights of this scenic little seaside town. His wandering lead him further and further into town. Sitting just at the edge of the town centre, at the junction of a street that seemed to lead into the more residential area was a cottage. Its cheerful exterior with its pale pink walls and white roof caught his eye. Curious, he decided to check it out. The closer he got, the noisy chatter of people and the smell of vanilla bean and waffle cones awoke his senses. The sign by the pathway under a fragrant lemon tree, leading up to the house read \u201cSweet Summer Chilled Ice Cream Parlour\u201d.</p><p>Making his way up the front steps to the door, Jon snuck a glimpse inside from the porch windows. His eyes took in the matching pastel aesthetics of the interior decor, the numerous patrons lounging about, the freezers with the ice cream, sorbet and frozen yogurt on display before landing on a woman behind the counter talking to a patron. The sight of her forced a quiet \u2018whoa&hellip;\u2019 from his lips. </p><p>The woman had a head of silver curls that she wore in a fish tail braid, draped over her left shoulder. Her cheeks were tinged with the slightest hint of pink. As for her eyes, he couldn\u2019t discern the colour from where he stood but they were large and doe like. The edges crinkled as she laughed at something her customer said. She was absolutely stunning and that smile of hers took his breath away.</p><p>The shop was fairly busy that afternoon and yet despite that, the woman bustled about serving her customers with the biggest, brightest smile on her face. The enjoyment and passion she had for her profession was captured in the twinkling of her eyes. Her never faltering grin was like the sun, so warm and radiant, infectious. Without knowing, his own lips had quirked up to smile along with her. It was that very instant, standing by the door watching her, Jon knew that he was lost. Completely and utterly besotted with this gorgeous stranger. </p><p>Upon his return to his uncle\u2019s diner, he tried desperately to be subtle. Casually, as best as he could, he brought up the house at the end of the street to his younger cousin Arya. Thankfully, she did not disappoint. He found out that her name was Daenerys, she grew up in town but left for college. After graduating, she had a job in the big city for a while but decided to return home to open an ice cream parlour. The cottage it now resided in used to belong to her grandparents who left it to her before they passed. </p><p>Since then, he\u2019d found himself being drawn to that fairy-tale-esque ice cream parlour, drawn to the lady inside. He didn\u2019t know why but he knew he wanted to be around her. He wanted to learn how to draw out those lovely smiles of hers. He wanted to know what her favourite ice cream flavour was. He wanted to know every single detail that shaped the woman she was. </p><p>In theory, wanting something was easy but the process of achieving said goal, sometimes won\u2019t go as smoothly as one would expect. The same goes for wanting to be in a relationship with someone. Jon was learning that now. His dating experience wasn\u2019t much to brag about. His last girlfriend was an acquaintance of his best friend. After their first meeting, the two of them engaged in on and off hook ups and attempts at dating for three months until she broke it off when he hinted at the possibility of them becoming an exclusive couple. After that, Jon gradually shied away from relationships. His job kept him well occupied and he even picked up a new hobby of creating music. That was three years ago. </p><p>As each footfall took him closer to the cottage, under the warm pressure of his puppy curled up and dozing on his chest, his heart began to play a game of jump rope. Would she be just as pretty as she was three days ago? Oh, who was he kidding, of course she would be. Would she be wearing that beautiful smile today? Stepping up the steps like he had done so many tines this week, his stomach did a flip at the thought of seeing her again. Ghost began to stir from his nap, whining a little by the jostling of his owner\u2019s steps. \u201cShhh&hellip;.\u201d Jon snuck a finger into the collar of his hoodie to scratch between his puppy\u2019s ears.</p><p>Pushing the door open, the warmth of the interior and the now familiar scent of vanilla and waffle cones washed over him once more. This place really was lovely. The cosiness of the layout was a nice counterbalance to the slight chill of the house. The shop was quiet that day, with only two of the booths occupied. Scanning the shop with his heart in his throat, his eyes searched for that glimmer of silver that he longed to see. </p><p>There she was! </p><p>How odd the phenomenon of having a crush was? Just a simple glance could reduce a sane person into a star struck, fumbling, bumbling mess whose brain and body just refused to coordinate. All he could do was stand and stare with his mouth agape. It would appear that he underestimated the degree of his feelings for that woman before him. </p><p>That smile she had refilling an empty ice cream tub was like a bolt straight to his heart. A flurry of goose bumps scurried across his skin. What would it feel to kiss that smile of hers, he wondered? Would her lips taste sweet like strawberries and cream? What would it be like to tangle his fingers in those curls that swayed as she moved? How would it feel like to kiss her under the stars, to hold her in his arms? His hands craved to touch her pale skin, to glide over the curves he could see through the confines of her clothes. What would he have to do to make her tremble and call out his name? Perhaps a kiss to her pulse point? One that he longed to find. How would it feel to have her writhing under him, above him, to move within her warmth?</p><p><i>Good lord, snap out of it man!</i></p><p>Running a hand down his face with a groan, this was not the time nor the place for thoughts like that, he berated himself. Jon subtly slung his guitar case to the front of his pants. A little hot under his collar and it wasn\u2019t because of his puppy\u2019s body heat, unsteady steps took him to the freezer display in search of something to cool him down. </p><p><i>Key lime pie, raspberry jelly donut, blueberry cheesecake, peach cobbler&hellip;. </i></p><p>What should he go for today? Out of the corner of his eye, he noted Dany and her friend whispering in quiet tones to one another. Dany\u2019s cheeks were looking a bit flushed as she clutched her hand to her chest whereas her friend with her back to him was giggling so hard she was shaking. </p><p><i>Chocolate swirl, cookies and cream, black cherry chocolate chip, rum raisin, mint chocolate chip&hellip;.</i></p><p>I suppose my default wouldn\u2019t hurt, Jon thought with a shrug. Besides, he had more important matters to worry about. Reaching for the bell on the counter he gave it a tap. </p><p><i>Ding!</i></p><p>Shuffling a few steps back from the counter, he started to fidget, adjusting the strap of his guitar case to lie higher on his shoulder. Anxiety swirled to life in the pit of his stomach. Would Dany finally take his order today? If she did, what was he going to say? What was she going to say? Would she look at him strangely like the weirdo she must think he was coming to her shop so often, getting the same ice cream every time? </p><p>\u201cHello there again!\u201d </p><p>His head shot up just in time to see her silver pony tail bob out of view as her petite figure hurry off to the back of the house. Jon\u2019s heart dropped. It wasn\u2019t Dany today. </p><p>Averting his eyes to face Dany\u2019s co-worker, he gave her a timid wave. \u201cUmm&hellip; hi again.\u201d</p><p>From his brief interactions with the lady, he could tell that she had a charmingly friendly demeanour and a very pleasant smile. She looked like a person you could be comfortable around and confide your deepest secrets to without the fear of her leaking them out.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been coming around a lot. You must really like ice cream huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmongst other things&hellip;.\u201d Jon muttered quietly to himself. Tugging at his ear lobe, his eyes darted away from her. If only she knew. Although, that elusive smirk she wore and her teasing tone hinted that maybe she did. With that mildly mortifying thought in his mind now, a flush quickly spread like wildfire up his neck. </p><p>Missandei had her suspicions as to why this good-looking fellow came by so recurrently. His look of disappointment at seeing her and the futile glance full of longing over her shoulder just confirmed it. This man standing right there opposite her clearly had a crush on Dany! The poor guy had no idea that his feelings were very much reciprocated. She was really having the best time observing the reactions from these two lovebirds. Lovebirds who didn\u2019t even know that all they needed to start something beautiful, was to just go for it. They were going to need some help and she was going to give it to them whether they liked it or not.</p><p>To start, she needed some information. Clearing her throat, Missandei asked: \u201cSo, what\u2019s your name? It\u2019s always good to know our customers and you\u2019re already very much a regular here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I\u2019m Jon. Jon Snow.\u201d Being the cordial gentleman that he was, he stuck out his right hand in greeting.</p><p>Taking his proffered hand in hers, she gave it a quick shake. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to finally meet you, Jon, properly this time. I\u2019m Missandei.\u201d </p><p>Deciding that it was time to wake up, Ghost poked his furry head out of Jon\u2019s collar. Pushing down on the zipper to free his head, a white ball of fluff emerged from the depths of Jon\u2019s hoodie to address the humans outside with a huge yawn. </p><p>\u201cAww&hellip;. and who\u2019s this?\u201d Missandei cooed. Her heart melted into a puddle at the sight of the little puppy in Jon\u2019s hoodie. Its white fur matched his owner\u2019s last name perfectly. Inquisitive ruby red eyes blinked sluggishly as he roused himself fully from sleep to glance about at his surroundings.</p><p>Fondly, scratching the puppy under his chin, Jon said to her: \u201cThis is Ghost. As you can see he\u2019s an albino pup. He was the smallest of his litter when I adopted him from the shelter. And&hellip; he likes to hide out in my clothing for some reason.\u201d Ghost\u2019s eyes narrowed into a squint at Jon\u2019s pleasurable ministrations. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s lovely.\u201d Rubbing a tiny paw under her thumb, Missandei melted even further as Ghost\u2019s mouth tried to gnaw at her. He was the cutest little thing.</p><p>Eventually, when Ghost gave up his attempt at chewing and settled for just licking her, Missandei shifted her attention back to Jon to ask him for his order. \u201cAre you having the usual today? Or would you like to try out some new flavours?\u201d Just then, an idea struck her. \u201cOh, and this puppy\u2019s getting a treat too! On the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to. Just a bowl of water will be fine for him please. I\u2019ll umm&hellip; yeah. I\u2019ll have my usual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense! A puppy that cute deserve a treat! I insist.\u201d Missandei implored, dismissing any possible protests of his. </p><p>\u201cWell&hellip;. if you insist.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI absolutely do! Go wait outside at your table!\u201d Missandei waved her hands at him to shoo him out playfully. \u201cI won\u2019t be a long with your order,\u201d she added with a smile.</p><p>Jon watched her work for a moment before exiting the shop to take up his usual bench. Sighing, he lay his guitar case down on the table. Unzipping his hoodie, he lifted Ghost out and plopped him on the table too. Did bringing his puppy with him in hopes to attract the attentions of a girl? Sure. It worked, the girl just wasn\u2019t Dany. </p><p>A man with babies or puppies always gets the ladies. That\u2019s what his best friend had said.</p><p>Once again, he didn\u2019t get to talk to the woman he went to see but he did make a new acquaintance and possibly a new ally.</p><p>\u201cWell, that was something huh?\u201d He asked his furry companion, stroking a finger gently through his snowy white fur. </p><p>Little did he know, Ghost the puppy would be the catalyst to his first conversation with the girl of his dreams. </p>",

We got this right?\u201d A question he posed to the lump, wriggling slightly against his chest, its little black wet nose poking at his neck. All he got in reply was a shrill whine and a languid lick. </p><p>\u201cGood enough.\u201d Nodding to himself, he tucked the furry lump more securely within the confines of his hoodie. With one hand under the puppy\u2019s bum, Jon slung his guitar case onto his shoulder, setting off down the street towards the quaint little ice cream parlour that he had come to love. The ice cream was delicious but it was for more than that. Hell, even his family knew about it. </p><p>His uncle had been badgering him so hard for frequenting \u201cenemy\u201d territory. Well, more like teasingly niggling him endlessly about going over whenever he could just so he could catch a glimpse of that pretty ice cream lady. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to see the competition again are you?\u201d Ned asked, flinging an arm around his nephew\u2019s shoulder and pulling the smaller man into a snug side hug. His prominent brows wriggled cheekily at Jon. Those kind knowing eyes of his uncle, gleaming with mirth always reminded him so much of his mother, Lyanna, Ned\u2019s baby sister. Under the scrutiny of their identical grey eyes, Jon always felt like a child. A boy who could keep no secrets from them. Their eyes saw right through him, always. </p><p>See, Jon\u2019s Uncle Ned was the current owner of the local diner and the bed and breakfast above it.

It wasn\u2019t Dany today. </p><p>Averting his eyes to face Dany\u2019s co-worker, he gave her a timid wave. \u201cUmm\u2026 hi again.\u201d</p><p>From his brief interactions with the lady, he could tell that she had a charmingly friendly demeanour and a very pleasant smile. She looked like a person you could be comfortable around and confide your deepest secrets to without the fear of her leaking them out.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been coming around a lot. You must really like ice cream huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmongst other things\u2026.\u201d Jon muttered quietly to himself. Tugging at his ear lobe, his eyes darted away from her. If only she knew. Although, that elusive smirk she wore and her teasing tone hinted that maybe she did. With that mildly mortifying thought in his mind now, a flush quickly spread like wildfire up his neck. </p><p>Missandei had her suspicions as to why this good-looking fellow came by so recurrently. His look of disappointment at seeing her and the futile glance full of longing over her shoulder just confirmed it. This man standing right there opposite her clearly had a crush on Dany! The poor guy had no idea that his feelings were very much reciprocated. She was really having the best time observing the reactions from these two lovebirds. Lovebirds who didn\u2019t even know that all they needed to start something beautiful, was to just go for it. They were going to need some help and she was going to give it to them whether they liked it or not.</p><p>To start, she needed some information. Clearing her throat, Missandei asked: \u201cSo, what\u2019s your name? It\u2019s always good to know our customers and you\u2019re already very much a regular here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I\u2019m Jon. Jon Snow.\u201d Being the cordial gentleman that he was, he stuck out his right hand in greeting.</p><p>Taking his proffered hand in hers, she gave it a quick shake. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to finally meet you, Jon, properly this time. I\u2019m Missandei.\u201d </p><p>Deciding that it was time to wake up, Ghost poked his furry head out of Jon\u2019s collar. Pushing down on the zipper to free his head, a white ball of fluff emerged from the depths of Jon\u2019s hoodie to address the humans outside with a huge yawn. </p><p>\u201cAww\u2026. and who\u2019s this?\u201d Missandei cooed. Her heart melted into a puddle at the sight of the little puppy in Jon\u2019s hoodie. Its white fur matched his owner\u2019s last name perfectly. Inquisitive ruby red eyes blinked sluggishly as he roused himself fully from sleep to glance about at his surroundings.</p><p>Fondly, scratching the puppy under his chin, Jon said to her: \u201cThis is Ghost. As you can see he\u2019s an albino pup. He was the smallest of his litter when I adopted him from the shelter. And\u2026 he likes to hide out in my clothing for some reason.\u201d Ghost\u2019s eyes narrowed into a squint at Jon\u2019s pleasurable ministrations. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s lovely.\u201d Rubbing a tiny paw under her thumb, Missandei melted even further as Ghost\u2019s mouth tried to gnaw at her. He was the cutest little thing.</p><p>Eventually, when Ghost gave up his attempt at chewing and settled for just licking her, Missandei shifted her attention back to Jon to ask him for his order. \u201cAre you having the usual today? Or would you like to try out some new flavours?\u201d Just then, an idea struck her. \u201cOh, and this puppy\u2019s getting a treat too! On the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to. Just a bowl of water will be fine for him please. I\u2019ll umm\u2026 yeah. I\u2019ll have my usual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense! A puppy that cute deserve a treat! I insist.\u201d Missandei implored, dismissing any possible protests of his. </p><p>\u201cWell\u2026. if you insist.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI absolutely do! Go wait outside at your table!\u201d Missandei waved her hands at him to shoo him out playfully. \u201cI won\u2019t be a long with your order,\u201d she added with a smile.</p><p>Jon watched her work for a moment before exiting the shop to take up his usual bench. Sighing, he lay his guitar case down on the table. Unzipping his hoodie, he lifted Ghost out and plopped him on the table too. Did bringing his puppy with him in hopes to attract the attentions of a girl? Sure. It worked, the girl just wasn\u2019t Dany. </p><p>A man with babies or puppies always gets the ladies. That\u2019s what his best friend had said.</p><p>Once again, he didn\u2019t get to talk to the woman he went to see but he did make a new acquaintance and possibly a new ally.</p><p>\u201cWell, that was something huh?\u201d He asked his furry companion, stroking a finger gently through his snowy white fur. </p><p>Little did he know, Ghost the puppy would be the catalyst to his first conversation with the girl of his dreams. </p></p>",

Just click Previous if you haven\u2019t read chap 1~</p><p>Enjoy! XD</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cOkay\u2026 okay\u2026 play it cool. Don\u2019t act weird. We got this right?\u201d A question he posed to the lump, wriggling slightly against his chest, its little black wet nose poking at his neck. All he got in reply was a shrill whine and a languid lick. </p><p>\u201cGood enough.\u201d Nodding to himself, he tucked the furry lump more securely within the confines of his hoodie. With one hand under the puppy\u2019s bum, Jon slung his guitar case onto his shoulder, setting off down the street towards the quaint little ice cream parlour that he had come to love. The ice cream was delicious but it was for more than that. Hell, even his family knew about it. </p><p>His uncle had been badgering him so hard for frequenting \u201cenemy\u201d territory. Well, more like teasingly niggling him endlessly about going over whenever he could just so he could catch a glimpse of that pretty ice cream lady. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to see the competition again are you?\u201d Ned asked, flinging an arm around his nephew\u2019s shoulder and pulling the smaller man into a snug side hug. His prominent brows wriggled cheekily at Jon. Those kind knowing eyes of his uncle, gleaming with mirth always reminded him so much of his mother, Lyanna, Ned\u2019s baby sister. Under the scrutiny of their identical grey eyes, Jon always felt like a child. A boy who could keep no secrets from them. Their eyes saw right through him, always. </p><p>See, Jon\u2019s Uncle Ned was the current owner of the local diner and the bed and breakfast above it. It was a family run business passed down from his parents. Besides providing warm meals for the people, the diner was also well known for its range of milkshakes, warm dessert classics like their bestselling rhubarb pie and of course ice cream. It was a place that travellers who were passing through town loved and a place the town folk grew up with. Including, a certain pretty ice cream lady. </p><p>Since Dany opened her shop, the two establishments had started a friendly rivalry to see who could attract the most customers by the end of her first year. The time was almost up. Ned had been in the lead due to the fact that he had his diner and bed and breakfast to account for, but now Dany seemed to be catching up. Which may or may not be thanks to him secretly recommending his customers to visit her if they ever wanted a more modern twist to their frozen desserts. Ned wasn\u2019t one who particularly cared for winning. He only wanted his friend\u2019s little girl, whom he watched grow from a spirited little thing with skinned knees and leaves in her hair into a smart, capable young woman to strive and some competition would do her good. </p><p>\u201cWhen are you going to strike up a conversation with that girl, boy? Daenerys is not gonna wait forever!\u201d Ned yelled out at Jon as he made his way to the door.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re indicating at. I\u2019m just going for a walk with Ghost, uncle.\u201d Jon feigned ignorance, feeling rather flushed and discomfited. Was he really that obvious? Ned\u2019s bellowing laughter followed him as the diner door shut behind him. </p><p><i>Daenerys. Dany, the other lady at the shop had called her. </i></p><p>She was the most beautiful woman he\u2019d ever seen. Jon was sure she could have her pick of any man anywhere. Would she even want to bat an eye in his direction? A lady like her must be accustomed to all manner of pursuits from men. What if him going after her would be unwelcome? What if she found him too forward and he\u2019d just chase her away? She might even be taken already! The thought had his heart clenching unpleasantly. For now, he was content with just admiring her from afar and dreaming of how their future interactions would go. Moreover, if he kept going, she was bound to take his order one day, right? That would be a start. </p><p>The second day he arrived at the town he had only heard his parents wistfully reminisce about through the stories they told him regarding his extended family, Jon went out exploring with his camera. Taking in the sights of this scenic little seaside town. His wandering lead him further and further into town. Sitting just at the edge of the town centre, at the junction of a street that seemed to lead into the more residential area was a cottage. Its cheerful exterior with its pale pink walls and white roof caught his eye. Curious, he decided to check it out. The closer he got, the noisy chatter of people and the smell of vanilla bean and waffle cones awoke his senses. The sign by the pathway under a fragrant lemon tree, leading up to the house read \u201cSweet Summer Chilled Ice Cream Parlour\u201d.</p><p>Making his way up the front steps to the door, Jon snuck a glimpse inside from the porch windows. His eyes took in the matching pastel aesthetics of the interior decor, the numerous patrons lounging about, the freezers with the ice cream, sorbet and frozen yogurt on display before landing on a woman behind the counter talking to a patron. The sight of her forced a quiet \u2018whoa\u2026\u2019 from his lips. </p><p>The woman had a head of silver curls that she wore in a fish tail braid, draped over her left shoulder. Her cheeks were tinged with the slightest hint of pink. As for her eyes, he couldn\u2019t discern the colour from where he stood but they were large and doe like. The edges crinkled as she laughed at something her customer said. She was absolutely stunning and that smile of hers took his breath away.</p><p>The shop was fairly busy that afternoon and yet despite that, the woman bustled about serving her customers with the biggest, brightest smile on her face. The enjoyment and passion she had for her profession was captured in the twinkling of her eyes. Her never faltering grin was like the sun, so warm and radiant, infectious. Without knowing, his own lips had quirked up to smile along with her. It was that very instant, standing by the door watching her, Jon knew that he was lost. Completely and utterly besotted with this gorgeous stranger. </p><p>Upon his return to his uncle\u2019s diner, he tried desperately to be subtle. Casually, as best as he could, he brought up the house at the end of the street to his younger cousin Arya. Thankfully, she did not disappoint. He found out that her name was Daenerys, she grew up in town but left for college. After graduating, she had a job in the big city for a while but decided to return home to open an ice cream parlour. The cottage it now resided in used to belong to her grandparents who left it to her before they passed. </p><p>Since then, he\u2019d found himself being drawn to that fairy-tale-esque ice cream parlour, drawn to the lady inside. He didn\u2019t know why but he knew he wanted to be around her. He wanted to learn how to draw out those lovely smiles of hers. He wanted to know what her favourite ice cream flavour was. He wanted to know every single detail that shaped the woman she was. </p><p>In theory, wanting something was easy but the process of achieving said goal, sometimes won\u2019t go as smoothly as one would expect. The same goes for wanting to be in a relationship with someone. Jon was learning that now. His dating experience wasn\u2019t much to brag about. His last girlfriend was an acquaintance of his best friend. After their first meeting, the two of them engaged in on and off hook ups and attempts at dating for three months until she broke it off when he hinted at the possibility of them becoming an exclusive couple. After that, Jon gradually shied away from relationships. His job kept him well occupied and he even picked up a new hobby of creating music. That was three years ago. </p><p>As each footfall took him closer to the cottage, under the warm pressure of his puppy curled up and dozing on his chest, his heart began to play a game of jump rope. Would she be just as pretty as she was three days ago? Oh, who was he kidding, of course she would be. Would she be wearing that beautiful smile today? Stepping up the steps like he had done so many tines this week, his stomach did a flip at the thought of seeing her again. Ghost began to stir from his nap, whining a little by the jostling of his owner\u2019s steps. \u201cShhh\u2026.\u201d Jon snuck a finger into the collar of his hoodie to scratch between his puppy\u2019s ears.</p><p>Pushing the door open, the warmth of the interior and the now familiar scent of vanilla and waffle cones washed over him once more. This place really was lovely. The cosiness of the layout was a nice counterbalance to the slight chill of the house. The shop was quiet that day, with only two of the booths occupied. Scanning the shop with his heart in his throat, his eyes searched for that glimmer of silver that he longed to see. </p><p>There she was! </p><p>How odd the phenomenon of having a crush was? Just a simple glance could reduce a sane person into a star struck, fumbling, bumbling mess whose brain and body just refused to coordinate. All he could do was stand and stare with his mouth agape. It would appear that he underestimated the degree of his feelings for that woman before him. </p><p>That smile she had refilling an empty ice cream tub was like a bolt straight to his heart. A flurry of goose bumps scurried across his skin. What would it feel to kiss that smile of hers, he wondered? Would her lips taste sweet like strawberries and cream? What would it be like to tangle his fingers in those curls that swayed as she moved? How would it feel like to kiss her under the stars, to hold her in his arms? His hands craved to touch her pale skin, to glide over the curves he could see through the confines of her clothes. What would he have to do to make her tremble and call out his name? Perhaps a kiss to her pulse point? One that he longed to find. How would it feel to have her writhing under him, above him, to move within her warmth?</p><p><i>Good lord, snap out of it man!</i></p><p>Running a hand down his face with a groan, this was not the time nor the place for thoughts like that, he berated himself. Jon subtly slung his guitar case to the front of his pants. A little hot under his collar and it wasn\u2019t because of his puppy\u2019s body heat, unsteady steps took him to the freezer display in search of something to cool him down. </p><p><i>Key lime pie, raspberry jelly donut, blueberry cheesecake, peach cobbler\u2026. </i></p><p>What should he go for today? Out of the corner of his eye, he noted Dany and her friend whispering in quiet tones to one another. Dany\u2019s cheeks were looking a bit flushed as she clutched her hand to her chest whereas her friend with her back to him was giggling so hard she was shaking. </p><p><i>Chocolate swirl, cookies and cream, black cherry chocolate chip, rum raisin, mint chocolate chip\u2026.</i></p><p>I suppose my default wouldn\u2019t hurt, Jon thought with a shrug. Besides, he had more important matters to worry about. Reaching for the bell on the counter he gave it a tap. </p><p><i>Ding!</i></p><p>Shuffling a few steps back from the counter, he started to fidget, adjusting the strap of his guitar case to lie higher on his shoulder. Anxiety swirled to life in the pit of his stomach. Would Dany finally take his order today? If she did, what was he going to say? What was she going to say? Would she look at him strangely like the weirdo she must think he was coming to her shop so often, getting the same ice cream every time? </p><p>\u201cHello there again!\u201d </p><p>His head shot up just in time to see her silver pony tail bob out of view as her petite figure hurry off to the back of the house. Jon\u2019s heart dropped. It wasn\u2019t Dany today. </p><p>Averting his eyes to face Dany\u2019s co-worker, he gave her a timid wave. \u201cUmm\u2026 hi again.\u201d</p><p>From his brief interactions with the lady, he could tell that she had a charmingly friendly demeanour and a very pleasant smile. She looked like a person you could be comfortable around and confide your deepest secrets to without the fear of her leaking them out.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been coming around a lot. You must really like ice cream huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmongst other things\u2026.\u201d Jon muttered quietly to himself. Tugging at his ear lobe, his eyes darted away from her. If only she knew. Although, that elusive smirk she wore and her teasing tone hinted that maybe she did. With that mildly mortifying thought in his mind now, a flush quickly spread like wildfire up his neck. </p><p>Missandei had her suspicions as to why this good-looking fellow came by so recurrently. His look of disappointment at seeing her and the futile glance full of longing over her shoulder just confirmed it. This man standing right there opposite her clearly had a crush on Dany! The poor guy had no idea that his feelings were very much reciprocated. She was really having the best time observing the reactions from these two lovebirds.

I\u2019m Missandei.\u201d </p><p>Deciding that it was time to wake up, Ghost poked his furry head out of Jon\u2019s collar. Pushing down on the zipper to free his head, a white ball of fluff emerged from the depths of Jon\u2019s hoodie to address the humans outside with a huge yawn. </p><p>\u201cAww\u2026. and who\u2019s this?\u201d Missandei cooed. Her heart melted into a puddle at the sight of the little puppy in Jon\u2019s hoodie. Its white fur matched his owner\u2019s last name perfectly.

We got this right?&rdquo; A question he posed to the lump, wriggling slightly against his chest, its little black wet nose poking at his neck. All he got in reply was a shrill whine and a languid lick. </p><p>&ldquo;Good enough.&rdquo; Nodding to himself, he tucked the furry lump more securely within the confines of his hoodie. With one hand under the puppy&rsquo;s bum, Jon slung his guitar case onto his shoulder, setting off down the street towards the quaint little ice cream parlour that he had come to love. The ice cream was delicious but it was for more than that. Hell, even his family knew about it. </p><p>His uncle had been badgering him so hard for frequenting &ldquo;enemy&rdquo; territory. Well, more like teasingly niggling him endlessly about going over whenever he could just so he could catch a glimpse of that pretty ice cream lady. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to see the competition again are you?&rdquo; Ned asked, flinging an arm around his nephew&rsquo;s shoulder and pulling the smaller man into a snug side hug. His prominent brows wriggled cheekily at Jon. Those kind knowing eyes of his uncle, gleaming with mirth always reminded him so much of his mother, Lyanna, Ned&rsquo;s baby sister. Under the scrutiny of their identical grey eyes, Jon always felt like a child. A boy who could keep no secrets from them. Their eyes saw right through him, always. </p><p>See, Jon&rsquo;s Uncle Ned was the current owner of the local diner and the bed and breakfast above it. It was a family run business passed down from his parents. Besides providing warm meals for the people, the diner was also well known for its range of milkshakes, warm dessert classics like their bestselling rhubarb pie and of course ice cream. It was a place that travellers who were passing through town loved and a place the town folk grew up with. Including, a certain pretty ice cream lady. </p><p>Since Dany opened her shop, the two establishments had started a friendly rivalry to see who could attract the most customers by the end of her first year. The time was almost up. Ned had been in the lead due to the fact that he had his diner and bed and breakfast to account for, but now Dany seemed to be catching up. Which may or may not be thanks to him secretly recommending his customers to visit her if they ever wanted a more modern twist to their frozen desserts. Ned wasn&rsquo;t one who particularly cared for winning. He only wanted his friend&rsquo;s little girl, whom he watched grow from a spirited little thing with skinned knees and leaves in her hair into a smart, capable young woman to strive and some competition would do her good. </p><p>&ldquo;When are you going to strike up a conversation with that girl, boy? Daenerys is not gonna wait forever!&rdquo; Ned yelled out at Jon as he made his way to the door.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re indicating at. I&rsquo;m just going for a walk with Ghost, uncle.&rdquo; Jon feigned ignorance, feeling rather flushed and discomfited. Was he really that obvious? Ned&rsquo;s bellowing laughter followed him as the diner door shut behind him. </p><p><i>Daenerys. Dany, the other lady at the shop had called her. </i></p><p>She was the most beautiful woman he&rsquo;d ever seen. Jon was sure she could have her pick of any man anywhere. Would she even want to bat an eye in his direction? A lady like her must be accustomed to all manner of pursuits from men. What if him going after her would be unwelcome? What if she found him too forward and he&rsquo;d just chase her away? She might even be taken already! The thought had his heart clenching unpleasantly. For now, he was content with just admiring her from afar and dreaming of how their future interactions would go. Moreover, if he kept going, she was bound to take his order one day, right? That would be a start. </p><p>The second day he arrived at the town he had only heard his parents wistfully reminisce about through the stories they told him regarding his extended family, Jon went out exploring with his camera. Taking in the sights of this scenic little seaside town. His wandering lead him further and further into town. Sitting just at the edge of the town centre, at the junction of a street that seemed to lead into the more residential area was a cottage. Its cheerful exterior with its pale pink walls and white roof caught his eye. Curious, he decided to check it out. The closer he got, the noisy chatter of people and the smell of vanilla bean and waffle cones awoke his senses. The sign by the pathway under a fragrant lemon tree, leading up to the house read &ldquo;Sweet Summer Chilled Ice Cream Parlour&rdquo;.</p><p>Making his way up the front steps to the door, Jon snuck a glimpse inside from the porch windows. His eyes took in the matching pastel aesthetics of the interior decor, the numerous patrons lounging about, the freezers with the ice cream, sorbet and frozen yogurt on display before landing on a woman behind the counter talking to a patron. The sight of her forced a quiet &lsquo;whoa&hellip;&rsquo; from his lips. </p><p>The woman had a head of silver curls that she wore in a fish tail braid, draped over her left shoulder. Her cheeks were tinged with the slightest hint of pink. As for her eyes, he couldn&rsquo;t discern the colour from where he stood but they were large and doe like. The edges crinkled as she laughed at something her customer said. She was absolutely stunning and that smile of hers took his breath away.</p><p>The shop was fairly busy that afternoon and yet despite that, the woman bustled about serving her customers with the biggest, brightest smile on her face. The enjoyment and passion she had for her profession was captured in the twinkling of her eyes. Her never faltering grin was like the sun, so warm and radiant, infectious. Without knowing, his own lips had quirked up to smile along with her. It was that very instant, standing by the door watching her, Jon knew that he was lost. Completely and utterly besotted with this gorgeous stranger. </p><p>Upon his return to his uncle&rsquo;s diner, he tried desperately to be subtle. Casually, as best as he could, he brought up the house at the end of the street to his younger cousin Arya. Thankfully, she did not disappoint. He found out that her name was Daenerys, she grew up in town but left for college. After graduating, she had a job in the big city for a while but decided to return home to open an ice cream parlour. The cottage it now resided in used to belong to her grandparents who left it to her before they passed. </p><p>Since then, he&rsquo;d found himself being drawn to that fairy-tale-esque ice cream parlour, drawn to the lady inside. He didn&rsquo;t know why but he knew he wanted to be around her. He wanted to learn how to draw out those lovely smiles of hers. He wanted to know what her favourite ice cream flavour was. He wanted to know every single detail that shaped the woman she was. </p><p>In theory, wanting something was easy but the process of achieving said goal, sometimes won&rsquo;t go as smoothly as one would expect. The same goes for wanting to be in a relationship with someone. Jon was learning that now. His dating experience wasn&rsquo;t much to brag about. His last girlfriend was an acquaintance of his best friend. After their first meeting, the two of them engaged in on and off hook ups and attempts at dating for three months until she broke it off when he hinted at the possibility of them becoming an exclusive couple. After that, Jon gradually shied away from relationships. His job kept him well occupied and he even picked up a new hobby of creating music. That was three years ago. </p><p>As each footfall took him closer to the cottage, under the warm pressure of his puppy curled up and dozing on his chest, his heart began to play a game of jump rope. Would she be just as pretty as she was three days ago? Oh, who was he kidding, of course she would be. Would she be wearing that beautiful smile today? Stepping up the steps like he had done so many tines this week, his stomach did a flip at the thought of seeing her again. Ghost began to stir from his nap, whining a little by the jostling of his owner&rsquo;s steps. &ldquo;Shhh&hellip;.&rdquo; Jon snuck a finger into the collar of his hoodie to scratch between his puppy&rsquo;s ears.</p><p>Pushing the door open, the warmth of the interior and the now familiar scent of vanilla and waffle cones washed over him once more. This place really was lovely. The cosiness of the layout was a nice counterbalance to the slight chill of the house. The shop was quiet that day, with only two of the booths occupied. Scanning the shop with his heart in his throat, his eyes searched for that glimmer of silver that he longed to see. </p><p>There she was! </p><p>How odd the phenomenon of having a crush was? Just a simple glance could reduce a sane person into a star struck, fumbling, bumbling mess whose brain and body just refused to coordinate. All he could do was stand and stare with his mouth agape. It would appear that he underestimated the degree of his feelings for that woman before him. </p><p>That smile she had refilling an empty ice cream tub was like a bolt straight to his heart. A flurry of goose bumps scurried across his skin. What would it feel to kiss that smile of hers, he wondered? Would her lips taste sweet like strawberries and cream? What would it be like to tangle his fingers in those curls that swayed as she moved? How would it feel like to kiss her under the stars, to hold her in his arms? His hands craved to touch her pale skin, to glide over the curves he could see through the confines of her clothes. What would he have to do to make her tremble and call out his name? Perhaps a kiss to her pulse point? One that he longed to find. How would it feel to have her writhing under him, above him, to move within her warmth?</p><p><i>Good lord, snap out of it man!</i></p><p>Running a hand down his face with a groan, this was not the time nor the place for thoughts like that, he berated himself. Jon subtly slung his guitar case to the front of his pants. A little hot under his collar and it wasn&rsquo;t because of his puppy&rsquo;s body heat, unsteady steps took him to the freezer display in search of something to cool him down. </p><p><i>Key lime pie, raspberry jelly donut, blueberry cheesecake, peach cobbler&hellip;. </i></p><p>What should he go for today? Out of the corner of his eye, he noted Dany and her friend whispering in quiet tones to one another. Dany&rsquo;s cheeks were looking a bit flushed as she clutched her hand to her chest whereas her friend with her back to him was giggling so hard she was shaking. </p><p><i>Chocolate swirl, cookies and cream, black cherry chocolate chip, rum raisin, mint chocolate chip&hellip;.</i></p><p>I suppose my default wouldn&rsquo;t hurt, Jon thought with a shrug. Besides, he had more important matters to worry about. Reaching for the bell on the counter he gave it a tap. </p><p><i>Ding!</i></p><p>Shuffling a few steps back from the counter, he started to fidget, adjusting the strap of his guitar case to lie higher on his shoulder. Anxiety swirled to life in the pit of his stomach. Would Dany finally take his order today? If she did, what was he going to say? What was she going to say? Would she look at him strangely like the weirdo she must think he was coming to her shop so often, getting the same ice cream every time? </p><p>&ldquo;Hello there again!&rdquo; </p><p>His head shot up just in time to see her silver pony tail bob out of view as her petite figure hurry off to the back of the house. Jon&rsquo;s heart dropped. It wasn&rsquo;t Dany today. </p><p>Averting his eyes to face Dany&rsquo;s co-worker, he gave her a timid wave. &ldquo;Umm&hellip; hi again.&rdquo;</p><p>From his brief interactions with the lady, he could tell that she had a charmingly friendly demeanour and a very pleasant smile. She looked like a person you could be comfortable around and confide your deepest secrets to without the fear of her leaking them out.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been coming around a lot. You must really like ice cream huh?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Amongst other things&hellip;.&rdquo; Jon muttered quietly to himself. Tugging at his ear lobe, his eyes darted away from her. If only she knew. Although, that elusive smirk she wore and her teasing tone hinted that maybe she did. With that mildly mortifying thought in his mind now, a flush quickly spread like wildfire up his neck. </p><p>Missandei had her suspicions as to why this good-looking fellow came by so recurrently. His look of disappointment at seeing her and the futile glance full of longing over her shoulder just confirmed it. This man standing right there opposite her clearly had a crush on Dany! The poor guy had no idea that his feelings were very much reciprocated. She was really having the best time observing the reactions from these two lovebirds. Lovebirds who didn&rsquo;t even know that all they needed to start something beautiful, was to just go for it. They were going to need some help and she was going to give it to them whether they liked it or not.</p><p>To start, she needed some information. Clearing her throat, Missandei asked: &ldquo;So, what&rsquo;s your name? It&rsquo;s always good to know our customers and you&rsquo;re already very much a regular here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh. I&rsquo;m Jon. Jon Snow.&rdquo; Being the cordial gentleman that he was, he stuck out his right hand in greeting.</p><p>Taking his proffered hand in hers, she gave it a quick shake. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice to finally meet you, Jon, properly this time. I&rsquo;m Missandei.&rdquo; </p><p>Deciding that it was time to wake up, Ghost poked his furry head out of Jon&rsquo;s collar. Pushing down on the zipper to free his head, a white ball of fluff emerged from the depths of Jon&rsquo;s hoodie to address the humans outside with a huge yawn. </p><p>&ldquo;Aww&hellip;. and who&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; Missandei cooed. Her heart melted into a puddle at the sight of the little puppy in Jon&rsquo;s hoodie. Its white fur matched his owner&rsquo;s last name perfectly. Inquisitive ruby red eyes blinked sluggishly as he roused himself fully from sleep to glance about at his surroundings.</p><p>Fondly, scratching the puppy under his chin, Jon said to her: &ldquo;This is Ghost. As you can see he&rsquo;s an albino pup. He was the smallest of his litter when I adopted him from the shelter. And&hellip; he likes to hide out in my clothing for some reason.&rdquo; Ghost&rsquo;s eyes narrowed into a squint at Jon&rsquo;s pleasurable ministrations. </p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s lovely.&rdquo; Rubbing a tiny paw under her thumb, Missandei melted even further as Ghost&rsquo;s mouth tried to gnaw at her. He was the cutest little thing.</p><p>Eventually, when Ghost gave up his attempt at chewing and settled for just licking her, Missandei shifted her attention back to Jon to ask him for his order. &ldquo;Are you having the usual today? Or would you like to try out some new flavours?&rdquo; Just then, an idea struck her. &ldquo;Oh, and this puppy&rsquo;s getting a treat too! On the house.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to. Just a bowl of water will be fine for him please. I&rsquo;ll umm&hellip; yeah. I&rsquo;ll have my usual.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nonsense! A puppy that cute deserve a treat! I insist.&rdquo; Missandei implored, dismissing any possible protests of his. </p><p>&ldquo;Well&hellip;. if you insist.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I absolutely do! Go wait outside at your table!&rdquo; Missandei waved her hands at him to shoo him out playfully. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be a long with your order,&rdquo; she added with a smile.</p><p>Jon watched her work for a moment before exiting the shop to take up his usual bench. Sighing, he lay his guitar case down on the table. Unzipping his hoodie, he lifted Ghost out and plopped him on the table too. Did bringing his puppy with him in hopes to attract the attentions of a girl? Sure. It worked, the girl just wasn&rsquo;t Dany. </p><p>A man with babies or puppies always gets the ladies. That&rsquo;s what his best friend had said.</p><p>Once again, he didn&rsquo;t get to talk to the woman he went to see but he did make a new acquaintance and possibly a new ally.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, that was something huh?&rdquo; He asked his furry companion, stroking a finger gently through his snowy white fur. </p><p>Little did he know, Ghost the puppy would be the catalyst to his first conversation with the girl of his dreams. </p></p>",

        "excerpt": "A drunken Jon Snow entertained the notion of joining the Night's Watch of his own free will. But the decision that he had to go to the Night's Watch was made in Catelyn Stark's bedchamber by Eddard Stark, Catelyn Stark, and Maester Luwin. Keep in mind that said chapter ends with Ned telling that he'll tell Jon himself that he had to go to the Wall as they had decided he would, not that he would ask the boy whether this was truly (still) his wish. Not to mention that nobody - neither Ned nor Benjen - actually explained to Jon what a fucked-up place the Night's Watch really was. In addition, there is the fact that Bran realizes that Jon Snow is pissed/sullen before he climbs the tower, a fact most likely connected to that last conversation between him and Ned where Ned flat-out told him that he had to go to the Wall. If Jon Snow wants to go to the Wall then he should actually look forward to that experience pretty much as much as Bran does to the journey south, right? And if his drunken desire to join the NW was all that sincere he had no problem leaving Winterfell as fourteen-year-old boy, right? This leads we to the conclusion that he realized that his desire to go to the Wall wasn't that strong after he sobered up.",
