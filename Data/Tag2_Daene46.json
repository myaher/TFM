Of course they&rsquo;d save it until the end. And no I didn&rsquo;t find it anticlimactic. As much as I wanted Sandor to win, his brother is a fucking zombie. He cannot be killed like that. Sandor had an amazing character arc and his redemption climaxed here through his relationship with Arya. The last thing he needed to resolve was his brother and ultimately they were too linked to each other to survive. Neither could win properly and Sandor was not a good man either.

But the whole episode portrays Cersei in a rather sympathetic way, far from the ruthless persona we&rsquo;ve seen before. This is partly to really portray Dany as the villain here. And the reasoning works here too. Jaime might be a redeemed man but he is not a good man. Neither is Cersei.

I didn&rsquo;t understand why&hellip; is Tyrion really this loyal to Dany ? Did he purposely blind himself until he couldn&rsquo;t anymore ? Jon is creeped out by the burning alive. He just couldn&rsquo;t do anything about it because he&rsquo;s afraid of Dany. The difference with Mance in S5 is he did something then because he wasn&rsquo;t afraid to stand up to Stannis </li><li>Lol how could so many Dothraki survive the charge against the wights ? </li><li>Greyworm loses it and he&rsquo;s seemingly gonna go up against Jon.

I&rsquo;d have loved to see Jon being smacked at how good his baby sister has become </li><li>Jon saving the girl from rape indeed reminded me of Sansa&rsquo;s near rape scene. In fact that&rsquo;s not the only time I was reminded of Sansa. When Arya passes civilians there are many shots of girls in lady dresses and frightened non-fighters who reminded me of Sansa - who stands for this specific group of people.
