Peter yelped, and tumbled off the couch arm as Stark came in.</p><p>Quickly Peter dived behind a pillow. </p><p>***</p><p>\u201cPeter? Are you in here?\u201d Stark asked. He thought he had heard a scream or something. </p><p>He walked into the living room and sat down. Another roll of thunder sounded outside. The glass was all that separated the cold drumming rain from the warm room.</p><p>As he sat down he could hear some faint panicked sounding breathing from under a nearby pillow. Tony scooted it back, and found Peter cowering, with his arms wrapped around his knees.</p><p>\u201cPeter? Are you ok?\u201d Tony asked, lowering his hand around the trembling kid.</p><p>Peter bit his lip, and flinched as the thunder rumbled. \u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m ok Mr. Stark..\u201d he said shakily.</p><p>\u201cWhat? No your not. Come here,\u201d Stark scooped Peter up in his palm, and held him up to look him over. He was pale, and shaking but he didn\u2019t seem sick\u2026..</p><p>Peter ducked his head, shrinking back as lighting lit up the room. Booming thunder quickly followed after.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Realization dawned on tony. \u201cPeter, are you scared of the storm?\u201d</p><p>Peter kept his eyes down as he nodded.</p><p>\u201cKid, it\u2019s ok to be scared of rain.\u201d Slowly he brought the kid over to his chest, and leaned back to let Peter lay on his chest. </p><p>Peter fidgeted. \u201cIt\u2019s stupid though, it\u2019s just\u2026 It\u2019s just noisy water\u2026plus I\u2019m probably to small to get hit by lightning anyways\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s not stupid. Lots of people are afraid of Thunder.\u201d Tony assured. His fingers went to Peter\u2019s back, and rubbed small circles. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be ok.\u201d</p><p>Some silence passed them by. \u201cYou know, I bet Thor is up to all of this.\u201d Tony speculated.</p><p>\u201cWhy would he do this though? Nobody likes rain.\u201d Peter mumbled.</p><p>\u201cHmmm\u2026.\u201d Tony chuckled, and moved his finger to Peter\u2019s curly hair. \u201cIt could be because I forgot to add strawberry poptarts to the the grocery list.\u201d Lighting cracked once more, filling the sky.</p><p>Peter shoved his face into Starks shirt to block put his surrondings. He said something, but it was too muffled to make out.</p><p>Stark furrowed his brows. \u201cWhat did you say Petey?\u201d </p><p>Peter lifted his face a bit. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake please buy some poptarts!\u201d He moaned. </p><p>Stark snorted. \u201cAlright. Friday! Order a dozen boxes of strawberry poptarts. Have them sent over right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure boss.\u201d The voice of the A.I answered. </p><p>Cupping his hand over Peter, Tony smiled. \u201cThere problem solved.\u201d He said despite the rain still pouring. </p><p>Peter curled up under the hand. \u201cNot completely\u2026.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, how about this.\u201d Stark began. \u201cI\u2019ll stay with you until the storm has passed. And when you wake up it\u2019ll be over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that. What if it\u2019s not?\u201d</p><p>Tony ran his thumb down Peter\u2019s back. \u201cThen I\u2019ll still be here. Ok?\u201d He looked down.</p><p>Peter bit his lip, and nodded. Silently he layed his head back down.

He said he didn\u2019t like the winters but then, it was him who suggested to go out into the park, it was him who initiated a snowball fight with a group of children, it was him who helped them build a snowman and Clint smiled happily when he saw his man playing in the snow like a child. And he would\u2019ve suggested to go ice skating on the small pond nearby but the ice was still too thin. Tony laughed and all the worry lines in his face were gone and he was so beautiful to look at at the moment. </p><p>\u201cHey, grumpy pants,\u201d he called and jogged over to him, \u201cI could need your help. They are winning,\u201d Tony grinned and pointed at the group of boys just making more snowballs. </p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d Clint smiled and shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019d be unfair.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh, come on,\u201d Tony took his hand and tried to pull him to the kids. \u201cHelp!\u201d </p><p>\u201cTell you what,\u201d Clint said. \u201cThere\u2019s a coffee shop over there,\u201d he pointed over his shoulder with his thumb, \u201cand I\u2019ll get us some coffee. I guess you should\u2019ve defeated your dangerous enemies by then.\u201d </p><p>\u201cParty pooper,\u201d Tony grinned but before he went back to the kids he stole a quick kiss from Clint. </p><p>Clint walked over to the coffee shop and groaned when he saw the line but he joined the end of the queue and kept watching Tony playing with the kids under the watchful eyes of their moms or nannies. But then his eyes were drawn to a young woman, walking in the park with a leash in her hand and calling someone, probably her dog. She seemed worried, Clint could see that even if she was far away. There was a reason why he got called Hawkeye. </p><p>But then it was his turn and he bought two coffees and two cookies and left the shop. He wanted to go back to Tony when the woman came up to him.</p><p>\u201cSir, have you seen my dog?\u201d she asked and Clint looked around. Maybe he could spot the dog but it was nowhere to be seen. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo, sorry,\u201d he said and shrugged apologetically. </p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d the woman said and walked away. Clint turned to go back to Tony when he passed the small pond. In summer there were ducks and frogs but now there was ice on it\u2026 or should be. Because right now there was a hole and Clint could see the water underneath moving. </p><p>\u201cAww, dog, no,\u201d he cursed when he saw the tail of a dog for a second. And without a thought he put the coffee and the cookies down on a bench and went to the pond, tried to lie down on the ice and to rob to the hole but - still - the ice was too thin and he fell through, too. </p><p>From one moment to the next it felt as if his breath froze in his lungs and he gasped for air, his thick jacket was soaked through in an instant. Fortunately the pond wasn\u2019t too deep, just to his waist so at least he didn\u2019t have to swim. </p><p>He found the dog, who was weakly struggling by now and Clint grabbed it and pulled it out of the water. </p><p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d he could hear the woman from behind him. \u201cDodger! You found him!\u201d </p><p>Clint\u2019s teeth chattered and he went back but thanks to the struggling dog he slid and fell on his knee and the ice cold water hit his chin. With a curse on his lips he rose and managed to get out of the pond and he put the dog down. </p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d the woman breathed and wrapped it in her jacket. \u201cThank you, thank you, thank you!\u201d She hurried away and Clint fell down on his knees. He felt dizzy and really, really tired. He wasn\u2019t too long in the water but it\u2019s been so cold. He wrapped his arms around himself. </p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he slurred and tried to rise but his knees refused to work properly. The woman was hurried away and had left him sitting beside the pond. He looked around and saw Tony in the distance, building a snow castle with the kids. </p><p>\u201cTony,\u201d he whispered. His teeth clattered so badly now and he crawled on his knees to the bench. </p><p>\u201cOh my god, Clint!\u201d Tony had finally seen him and came over. He grabbed his arm and helped him up. \u201cClint, what happened?\u201d He removed his glove and put a hand on his cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re ice cold! What happened?\u201d </p><p>\u201cD-d-dog\u2026 w-w-water,\u201d Clint pressed through his teeth, shivering violently. </p><p>Tony reached in his pocket, took his phone and called for one of his suits. It was faster than an ambulance. </p><p>\u201cClint,\u201d he whispered and put his arm around his shoulders. \u201cClint, are you with me?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Clint looked up but couldn\u2019t see Tony properly. </p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Tony cursed but then his suit appeared, opened and Tony climbed in, put Clint on his arms and flew him back to the tower. He brought him to their bedroom and got out of the suit. </p><p>\u201cCome on, get out of the wet clothes,\u201d he said and pulled at the zipper of his jacket. Clint shivered and his teeth clattered and he could barely stand. Tony cursed silently and removed bit after bit of his wet clothing. \u201cCome on,\u201d he said and helped Clint into the bathroom and shoved him into the shower and turned on the water. </p><p>\u201cUhhh,\u201d Clint groaned when the hot water hit his skin and Tony slipped out of his clothes, too, and went with him to hold him upright. \u201cOkay, Clint? Are you okay?\u201d </p><p>\u201cY-y-yeah\u2026\u201d Clint nodded after a long moment. Tony dragged him to the bedroom and shoved him in the bed, wrapped lots of blankets around him. </p><p>\u201cS-s-stay?\u201d he said when Tony wanted to leave. Tony deliberated for a moment, he just wanted to get Bruce. \u201cP-p-please!\u201d </p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said and lay down beside Clint and wrapped his arm around him. He could feel him shiver under all the blankets. \u201cI\u2019ll be here,\u201d he said and kissed Clint\u2019s forehead. \u201cMy hero.\u201d </p><p>\u201cL-l-love y-y-you,\u201d Clint mumbled and Tony caressed his head. </p><p>\u201cLove you, too.\u201d </p>",

With a curse on his lips he rose and managed to get out of the pond and he put the dog down. </p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d the woman breathed and wrapped it in her jacket. \u201cThank you, thank you, thank you!\u201d She hurried away and Clint fell down on his knees. He felt dizzy and really, really tired. He wasn\u2019t too long in the water but it\u2019s been so cold. He wrapped his arms around himself. </p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he slurred and tried to rise but his knees refused to work properly. The woman was hurried away and had left him sitting beside the pond. He looked around and saw Tony in the distance, building a snow castle with the kids. </p><p>\u201cTony,\u201d he whispered. His teeth clattered so badly now and he crawled on his knees to the bench. </p><p>\u201cOh my god, Clint!\u201d Tony had finally seen him and came over. He grabbed his arm and helped him up. \u201cClint, what happened?\u201d He removed his glove and put a hand on his cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re ice cold! What happened?\u201d </p><p>\u201cD-d-dog\u2026 w-w-water,\u201d Clint pressed through his teeth, shivering violently. </p><p>Tony reached in his pocket, took his phone and called for one of his suits. It was faster than an ambulance. </p><p>\u201cClint,\u201d he whispered and put his arm around his shoulders. \u201cClint, are you with me?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Clint looked up but couldn\u2019t see Tony properly. </p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Tony cursed but then his suit appeared, opened and Tony climbed in, put Clint on his arms and flew him back to the tower. He brought him to their bedroom and got out of the suit. </p><p>\u201cCome on, get out of the wet clothes,\u201d he said and pulled at the zipper of his jacket. Clint shivered and his teeth clattered and he could barely stand. Tony cursed silently and removed bit after bit of his wet clothing. \u201cCome on,\u201d he said and helped Clint into the bathroom and shoved him into the shower and turned on the water. </p><p>\u201cUhhh,\u201d Clint groaned when the hot water hit his skin and Tony slipped out of his clothes, too, and went with him to hold him upright. \u201cOkay, Clint? Are you okay?\u201d </p><p>\u201cY-y-yeah\u2026\u201d Clint nodded after a long moment. Tony dragged him to the bedroom and shoved him in the bed, wrapped lots of blankets around him. </p><p>\u201cS-s-stay?\u201d he said when Tony wanted to leave. Tony deliberated for a moment, he just wanted to get Bruce. \u201cP-p-please!\u201d </p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said and lay down beside Clint and wrapped his arm around him. He could feel him shiver under all the blankets. \u201cI\u2019ll be here,\u201d he said and kissed Clint\u2019s forehead. \u201cMy hero.\u201d </p><p>\u201cL-l-love y-y-you,\u201d Clint mumbled and Tony caressed his head. </p><p>\u201cLove you, too.\u201d </p>",

Clint hated them. He hated the snow, he hated the cold and he hated that he had to wear lots of clothes to not freeze to death. </p><p>Tony on the other hand seemed to love them even if he stated otherwise. He said he didn\u2019t like the winters but then, it was him who suggested to go out into the park, it was him who initiated a snowball fight with a group of children, it was him who helped them build a snowman and Clint smiled happily when he saw his man playing in the snow like a child. And he would\u2019ve suggested to go ice skating on the small pond nearby but the ice was still too thin. Tony laughed and all the worry lines in his face were gone and he was so beautiful to look at at the moment. </p><p>\u201cHey, grumpy pants,\u201d he called and jogged over to him, \u201cI could need your help. They are winning,\u201d Tony grinned and pointed at the group of boys just making more snowballs. </p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d Clint smiled and shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019d be unfair.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh, come on,\u201d Tony took his hand and tried to pull him to the kids. \u201cHelp!\u201d </p><p>\u201cTell you what,\u201d Clint said. \u201cThere\u2019s a coffee shop over there,\u201d he pointed over his shoulder with his thumb, \u201cand I\u2019ll get us some coffee. I guess you should\u2019ve defeated your dangerous enemies by then.\u201d </p><p>\u201cParty pooper,\u201d Tony grinned but before he went back to the kids he stole a quick kiss from Clint. </p><p>Clint walked over to the coffee shop and groaned when he saw the line but he joined the end of the queue and kept watching Tony playing with the kids under the watchful eyes of their moms or nannies. But then his eyes were drawn to a young woman, walking in the park with a leash in her hand and calling someone, probably her dog. She seemed worried, Clint could see that even if she was far away. There was a reason why he got called Hawkeye. </p><p>But then it was his turn and he bought two coffees and two cookies and left the shop. He wanted to go back to Tony when the woman came up to him.</p><p>\u201cSir, have you seen my dog?\u201d she asked and Clint looked around. Maybe he could spot the dog but it was nowhere to be seen. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo, sorry,\u201d he said and shrugged apologetically. </p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d the woman said and walked away. Clint turned to go back to Tony when he passed the small pond. In summer there were ducks and frogs but now there was ice on it\u2026 or should be. Because right now there was a hole and Clint could see the water underneath moving. </p><p>\u201cAww, dog, no,\u201d he cursed when he saw the tail of a dog for a second. And without a thought he put the coffee and the cookies down on a bench and went to the pond, tried to lie down on the ice and to rob to the hole but - still - the ice was too thin and he fell through, too. </p><p>From one moment to the next it felt as if his breath froze in his lungs and he gasped for air, his thick jacket was soaked through in an instant.

Not that he had any right to, to be honest. They were friends, maybe close ones since he convinced the man to be his \u2018awesome facial hair bro\u2019, but that was all. He had no idea what happened between him and Palmer after that Tony himself reversed the Snap, but he was pretty sure they both were head over the heels for each other. <br/>And Tony didn\u2019t plan to ruin whatever relationship the doctor had for a stupid crush. Though he couldn\u2019t even deny that he had a stupid crush for Stephen Strange. They somehow speak every day at least one of them was out of the country, or their dimension if was Stephen, and keep updated about stuff both in Kamar-Taj or with the other Avengers. </p><p>With the passing of time, they started to speak about more personal arguments, and Tony understood how lonely Stephen\u2019s life was, he spoke a lot about Christine and Wong and his students in Nepal, though he sounded always happier when Peter swung by. It was like listening to the kid, only less over-enthusiastic. Not that Stephen let Stark understand, but the man could recognize some scheme he used in the past. </p><p>That day, he was working at the new War Machine Mark III after having tried and failed to call Stephen four time. \u2018He\u2019s probably chasing some student in the Forbidden Forest\u2019 He repeated to himself, still tinkering with the suit. Rhodey repeated to him over and over again that he didn\u2019t need an update, but it was like speaking with a wall when it came to Tony, and anyway, he felt better to keep his friends safe. Which was the reason why he was also working on something for Stephen, but, again, it wasn\u2019t like the Sorcerer needed to know. </p><p>He let one of his hard rock playlists play in the background and came back to his blueprints, trying not to think about Stephen and the fact that he shouldn\u2019t have missed the man so bad. Anyway, it was easy for him to be dragged again in the workshop routine and rapidly any thought he may have had on Stephen was dismissed in favour of his researches on how to integrate nanoparticles braces which could replace the real ones Rhodey needed to walk. </p><p>His hands were flying over the touchscreen keyboards and through holographic projects and data. Somehow, it was the best place where to be, for the genius. He could pretend to feel comfortable among people and he usually was, though he was never as happy as he was when he could close everything outside the workshop doors and work on whatever crossed his mind. Bruce told him he was two different men, one who he showed to the world, and a more private one. Tony knew Banner was right, he also knew he showed that side of himself only to Rhodes, Banner, Peter, probably Nat, and Stephen. The people he really cared about. </p><p>He glanced to DUM-E which was moving dangerously close to his workbench with the fire extinguisher and backed off immediately with a sad beep, and went back to his work. Which was why he didn\u2019t notice the golden sparkling portal opening in the middle of the lab until Stephen stumbled against the concrete. The portal collapsed at his backs a moment later and that was weird. </p><p>\u201cStephen?\u201d He asked, dismissing the projects with a fast movement of his hand. From the other man, no answer came, and Tony all but jumped over the table. </p><p>Stephen was lying on the floor and his hands were fumbling, though Tony couldn\u2019t understand if it was because of the nerve damage or there was something wrong with the Sorcerer. \u201cDumbledore\u2026?\u201d He asked, again, hoping that the ironic tone could hide the fact that Tony was definitely worried. </p><p>It took some minutes in which Stark was mildly panicking to Stephen to speak. \u201cWhere am I?\u201d </p><p>If that was supposed to calm Tony, it didn\u2019t work at all. Stark cradled the other\u2019s head in his hand, trying to understand what to do and bringing his steel-blue eyes at his owns height. His eyes were almost black, and it was clear that he couldn\u2019t really picture where he was, again, Tony couldn\u2019t say if it was panic or something else. But it was a terrible view. </p><p>\u201cFry,\u201d He ordered, without even needing to tell him to run scanning on the man. Then he went back looking at Strange. \u201cYou are in the Compound, in my workshop.\u201d</p><p>Stephen nodded, very, very slowly. And now Tony was sure that there was something wrong with him. He wasn\u2019t like it was the first time Stephen did something strange, no pun intended, but he usually came back from some dimension who left him high or extremely clingy which was something Tony was more than willing to help with. Whatever THAT was, well, was a fucking mess and Tony didn\u2019t know what to do to help the man.</p><p>\u201cStrange, I need you to speak with me, ok?\u201d He asked, but Stephen seemed to doze off again and, fuck, why was Friday so slow? And why the wizard\u2019s pulse was so weak? \u00a0He was going to ask his AI to speed things up when her voice filled the workshop.</p><p>\u201cDoctor Strange seems to present symptoms of hypothermia, boss.\u201d </p><p>What the fucking fuck? Stephen\u2019s hand wrapped around Tony\u2019s arm as if he was trying to tell him something, but he had no idea of what to do. He knew for sure that he couldn\u2019t leave Stephen like that but, again, he didn\u2019t want either to do something which could bring things to a worse point. \u201cHow do I help him?\u201d </p><p>Stephen was barely conscious, by now, and his breath was terribly shallow. He knew nothing about hypothermia, but that, for sure, wasn\u2019t a good sign. While Friday\u2019s voice went on again, he started to search for Bruce\u2019s number on his mobile. \u201cYou should strip him off of wet clothes and give him warm ones, boss,\u201d Friday informed him. Tony nodded. </p><p>\u201cSend the bots in my room, and call Bruce,\u201d He ordered, a moment later the beep of the line was all over the workshop. Tony\u2019s hands ran on Stephen\u2019s clothes, stripping him off from his too many layers of sorcerer robes. \u201cGoddamned belts!\u201d He almost screamed it took him some seconds to realize that the Cloak was helping him, undoing the belts for Stark. \u201cThank you, pretty carpet.\u201d </p><p>Once they managed to take Stephen\u2019s clothes off, and Tony tried not to stare but the man had a very fine body and how he didn\u2019t even see it before, the Cloak wrapped itself around its owner. Tony looked at it, knowing that, of course, that wasn\u2019t enough for the time being and everything he had to raise the temperature in the workshop could as well burn Stephen. </p><p>\u201cTony?\u201d Bruce\u2019s voice came from his mobile. </p><p>\u201cBruce, thank god you picked up,\u201d Tony tried not to sound too panicked, though he knew he had to be fast. Stephen was still passed out and it didn\u2019t matter how tight the Cloak was protecting his body. \u201cStephen isn\u2019t feeling well. Friday told me is hypothermia\u2026 I took his clothes off.\u201d</p><p>Despite everything, Tony could hear Bruce chuckle before answering. \u201cDo you have something like an electric blanket? Or hot packs. You have to warm his torso, neck and groin\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have the Cloak,\u201d Tony answered, looking at the red cape which was clearly trying to do whatever in its power to increase Stephen\u2019s body temperature. \u201cI\u2019m in the workshop, and I don\u2019t want to leave him.\u201d</p><p>From the other side of the phone everything went silent for a while, then Bruce continued: \u201cOk, it\u2019s not the best way but can work in the meanwhile. Try to use your body to warm him. Just, get under the Cloak as well, it will steady your temperature.\u201d</p><p>Tony nodded, hoping that his bots will arrive with new clothes soon and then he looked at the Cloak. \u201cHave you hear the other doc, pretty carpet?\u201d </p><p>The Cloak nodded in that weird way it had to make others understand what it said. It rose from Stephen\u2019s body what was necessary to Tony to reach the other man. His workshop floor was one of the most uncomfortable superficies on which Tony had ever lay, and holding Strange like that was the sweetest hell ever for Stark. He tried not to think about that and focus on the fact that Stephen\u2019s pulse was too slow, while he let run his hands on the sorcerer\u2019s torso and neck, as Bruce said. </p><p>His skin was freezing. \u201cFriday, turn the heating on in the workshop,\u201d He said. It took almost too long, in his opinion, but after some minutes, when the bots already arrived, Stephen started to shake, grasping at Tony\u2019s shoulders and reducing the already minimum distance between their bodies. Tony wasn\u2019t going to complying, repeating to himself that the other man was looking for his heat. </p><p>The genius had no idea how long they stayed like that, but Stephen\u2019s breath stabilized after a while and when he opened his eyes they had again that light that Tony loved so much. </p><p>\u201cWhy am I naked?\u201d He asked, in a whisper. At that question, the DUM-E beeped, bringing both of them to turn and see the bot with Tony\u2019s clothes. </p><p>\u201cHypothermia,\u201d Tony let out, forcing his eyes to go to the ceiling which was better than looking at Stephen\u2019s face, right now. \u201cI was keeping you warm.\u201d</p><p>A soft smile cracked through Stephen\u2019s lips, and Tony started to move back, leaving the other man his space to get up and get dressed again. Once he rose from the floor, Tony took his good time admiring the man\u2019s back. He was in his underwear and one of Tony\u2019s worn t-shirt in an eye-beat. And then Stephen turned and was staring straight at Tony. </p><p>The genius ran a hand in his hair, trying to do something which wasn\u2019t looking at him. It wasn\u2019t so easy but Tony was used to wearing the perfect society man mask. \u201cWell, this had been fun, but let\u2019s try not to do it again, ok? You scared the shit out of me.\u201d</p><p>Stephen nodded. \u201cI\u2019d rather not to reply the travel in the icy dimension which isn\u2019t the one of Frozen before you decided to call it like that, but I don\u2019t mind the \u2018I\u2019m naked in your house\u2019 part.\u201d </p><p>And then he opened a portal, leaving Tony there, his jaw almost on the floor, while he tried to understand what the hell did that mean. A moment later, the sound of an incoming text came from his mobile phone: \u201cI meant it for real, douchebag. -SS\u201d<br/></p>",

They somehow speak every day at least one of them was out of the country, or their dimension if was Stephen, and keep updated about stuff both in Kamar-Taj or with the other Avengers. </p><p>With the passing of time, they started to speak about more personal arguments, and Tony understood how lonely Stephen\u2019s life was, he spoke a lot about Christine and Wong and his students in Nepal, though he sounded always happier when Peter swung by. It was like listening to the kid, only less over-enthusiastic. Not that Stephen let Stark understand, but the man could recognize some scheme he used in the past. </p><p>That day, he was working at the new War Machine Mark III after having tried and failed to call Stephen four time. \u2018He\u2019s probably chasing some student in the Forbidden Forest\u2019 He repeated to himself, still tinkering with the suit. Rhodey repeated to him over and over again that he didn\u2019t need an update, but it was like speaking with a wall when it came to Tony, and anyway, he felt better to keep his friends safe. Which was the reason why he was also working on something for Stephen, but, again, it wasn\u2019t like the Sorcerer needed to know. </p><p>He let one of his hard rock playlists play in the background and came back to his blueprints, trying not to think about Stephen and the fact that he shouldn\u2019t have missed the man so bad. Anyway, it was easy for him to be dragged again in the workshop routine and rapidly any thought he may have had on Stephen was dismissed in favour of his researches on how to integrate nanoparticles braces which could replace the real ones Rhodey needed to walk. </p><p>His hands were flying over the touchscreen keyboards and through holographic projects and data. Somehow, it was the best place where to be, for the genius. He could pretend to feel comfortable among people and he usually was, though he was never as happy as he was when he could close everything outside the workshop doors and work on whatever crossed his mind. Bruce told him he was two different men, one who he showed to the world, and a more private one. Tony knew Banner was right, he also knew he showed that side of himself only to Rhodes, Banner, Peter, probably Nat, and Stephen. The people he really cared about. </p><p>He glanced to DUM-E which was moving dangerously close to his workbench with the fire extinguisher and backed off immediately with a sad beep, and went back to his work. Which was why he didn\u2019t notice the golden sparkling portal opening in the middle of the lab until Stephen stumbled against the concrete. The portal collapsed at his backs a moment later and that was weird. </p><p>\u201cStephen?\u201d He asked, dismissing the projects with a fast movement of his hand. From the other man, no answer came, and Tony all but jumped over the table. </p><p>Stephen was lying on the floor and his hands were fumbling, though Tony couldn\u2019t understand if it was because of the nerve damage or there was something wrong with the Sorcerer. \u201cDumbledore\u2026?\u201d He asked, again, hoping that the ironic tone could hide the fact that Tony was definitely worried. </p><p>It took some minutes in which Stark was mildly panicking to Stephen to speak. \u201cWhere am I?\u201d </p><p>If that was supposed to calm Tony, it didn\u2019t work at all. Stark cradled the other\u2019s head in his hand, trying to understand what to do and bringing his steel-blue eyes at his owns height. His eyes were almost black, and it was clear that he couldn\u2019t really picture where he was, again, Tony couldn\u2019t say if it was panic or something else. But it was a terrible view. </p><p>\u201cFry,\u201d He ordered, without even needing to tell him to run scanning on the man. Then he went back looking at Strange. \u201cYou are in the Compound, in my workshop.\u201d</p><p>Stephen nodded, very, very slowly. And now Tony was sure that there was something wrong with him. He wasn\u2019t like it was the first time Stephen did something strange, no pun intended, but he usually came back from some dimension who left him high or extremely clingy which was something Tony was more than willing to help with. Whatever THAT was, well, was a fucking mess and Tony didn\u2019t know what to do to help the man.</p><p>\u201cStrange, I need you to speak with me, ok?\u201d He asked, but Stephen seemed to doze off again and, fuck, why was Friday so slow? And why the wizard\u2019s pulse was so weak? \u00a0He was going to ask his AI to speed things up when her voice filled the workshop.</p><p>\u201cDoctor Strange seems to present symptoms of hypothermia, boss.\u201d </p><p>What the fucking fuck? Stephen\u2019s hand wrapped around Tony\u2019s arm as if he was trying to tell him something, but he had no idea of what to do. He knew for sure that he couldn\u2019t leave Stephen like that but, again, he didn\u2019t want either to do something which could bring things to a worse point. \u201cHow do I help him?\u201d </p><p>Stephen was barely conscious, by now, and his breath was terribly shallow. He knew nothing about hypothermia, but that, for sure, wasn\u2019t a good sign. While Friday\u2019s voice went on again, he started to search for Bruce\u2019s number on his mobile. \u201cYou should strip him off of wet clothes and give him warm ones, boss,\u201d Friday informed him. Tony nodded. </p><p>\u201cSend the bots in my room, and call Bruce,\u201d He ordered, a moment later the beep of the line was all over the workshop. Tony\u2019s hands ran on Stephen\u2019s clothes, stripping him off from his too many layers of sorcerer robes. \u201cGoddamned belts!\u201d He almost screamed it took him some seconds to realize that the Cloak was helping him, undoing the belts for Stark. \u201cThank you, pretty carpet.\u201d </p><p>Once they managed to take Stephen\u2019s clothes off, and Tony tried not to stare but the man had a very fine body and how he didn\u2019t even see it before, the Cloak wrapped itself around its owner. Tony looked at it, knowing that, of course, that wasn\u2019t enough for the time being and everything he had to raise the temperature in the workshop could as well burn Stephen. </p><p>\u201cTony?\u201d Bruce\u2019s voice came from his mobile. </p><p>\u201cBruce, thank god you picked up,\u201d Tony tried not to sound too panicked, though he knew he had to be fast. Stephen was still passed out and it didn\u2019t matter how tight the Cloak was protecting his body. \u201cStephen isn\u2019t feeling well. Friday told me is hypothermia\u2026 I took his clothes off.\u201d</p><p>Despite everything, Tony could hear Bruce chuckle before answering. \u201cDo you have something like an electric blanket? Or hot packs. You have to warm his torso, neck and groin\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have the Cloak,\u201d Tony answered, looking at the red cape which was clearly trying to do whatever in its power to increase Stephen\u2019s body temperature. \u201cI\u2019m in the workshop, and I don\u2019t want to leave him.\u201d</p><p>From the other side of the phone everything went silent for a while, then Bruce continued: \u201cOk, it\u2019s not the best way but can work in the meanwhile. Try to use your body to warm him. Just, get under the Cloak as well, it will steady your temperature.\u201d</p><p>Tony nodded, hoping that his bots will arrive with new clothes soon and then he looked at the Cloak. \u201cHave you hear the other doc, pretty carpet?\u201d </p><p>The Cloak nodded in that weird way it had to make others understand what it said. It rose from Stephen\u2019s body what was necessary to Tony to reach the other man. His workshop floor was one of the most uncomfortable superficies on which Tony had ever lay, and holding Strange like that was the sweetest hell ever for Stark. He tried not to think about that and focus on the fact that Stephen\u2019s pulse was too slow, while he let run his hands on the sorcerer\u2019s torso and neck, as Bruce said. </p><p>His skin was freezing. \u201cFriday, turn the heating on in the workshop,\u201d He said. It took almost too long, in his opinion, but after some minutes, when the bots already arrived, Stephen started to shake, grasping at Tony\u2019s shoulders and reducing the already minimum distance between their bodies. Tony wasn\u2019t going to complying, repeating to himself that the other man was looking for his heat. </p><p>The genius had no idea how long they stayed like that, but Stephen\u2019s breath stabilized after a while and when he opened his eyes they had again that light that Tony loved so much. </p><p>\u201cWhy am I naked?\u201d He asked, in a whisper. At that question, the DUM-E beeped, bringing both of them to turn and see the bot with Tony\u2019s clothes. </p><p>\u201cHypothermia,\u201d Tony let out, forcing his eyes to go to the ceiling which was better than looking at Stephen\u2019s face, right now. \u201cI was keeping you warm.\u201d</p><p>A soft smile cracked through Stephen\u2019s lips, and Tony started to move back, leaving the other man his space to get up and get dressed again. Once he rose from the floor, Tony took his good time admiring the man\u2019s back. He was in his underwear and one of Tony\u2019s worn t-shirt in an eye-beat. And then Stephen turned and was staring straight at Tony. </p><p>The genius ran a hand in his hair, trying to do something which wasn\u2019t looking at him. It wasn\u2019t so easy but Tony was used to wearing the perfect society man mask. \u201cWell, this had been fun, but let\u2019s try not to do it again, ok? You scared the shit out of me.\u201d</p><p>Stephen nodded. \u201cI\u2019d rather not to reply the travel in the icy dimension which isn\u2019t the one of Frozen before you decided to call it like that, but I don\u2019t mind the \u2018I\u2019m naked in your house\u2019 part.\u201d </p><p>And then he opened a portal, leaving Tony there, his jaw almost on the floor, while he tried to understand what the hell did that mean. A moment later, the sound of an incoming text came from his mobile phone: \u201cI meant it for real, douchebag. -SS\u201d<br></p>",
