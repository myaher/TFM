We should just leave him, like he says. If it was you or me hurt, you know he\u2019d leave us.\u201d They scrambled down a steep cut and up the other side, using roots for handholds. \u201cI\u2019m sick of carrying him, and I\u2019m sick of all his talk about yielding too. If he could stand up, I\u2019d knock his teeth in. Lommy\u2019s no use to anyone.

Like total, absolute horse crap. <br /></p><p>There are 7 kingdoms in Westeros.</p><p>- The North: Jon has the support of Lyanna Mormont and some houses - like Alys and Umber will support him. He will also always have the support of house Stark - or atleast of Arya and Bran. <br /></p><p>-&nbsp; The Rock/Lannisters - Enemies of the North/Starks, current rulers in KL. They are not going to be supporting anyone</p><p>- Dorne - Allied to Dany, defeated by Euron/Cersei. Current situation unknown. But they have been tradionally Targ allies both in the books and show</p><p>- The Riverlands/Iron Islands - Edmure Tully, his wife and child are still alive. The last we saw, they were imprisoned by the Freys. Arya annihilated the Freys and Edmure is possibly free. Edmure owes Arya his freedom and if Arya supports Jon, then so will Edmure. In the books, Edmure is a witness and signatory to Robb&rsquo;s will which legitimizes and makes Jon KITN and a Stark and at the same time disinherits Sansa.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>&nbsp; Euron is most likely going to be defeated. Yara and Theon Greyjoy are Dany allies.<br /></p><p>&nbsp;- The Stormlands - on the show, all the Baratheons are gone except for Gendry. Gendry can be legitimized and given the Stormlands by Dany, he is a good Jon friend and there is Arya who supports Jon. <br /></p><p>-&nbsp; The Reach: The Tyrells were Dany allies before they were betrayed and backstabbed by the traitor Tarlys. The Lannisters sacked and looted the Reach. Current status unknown. But I doubt the other houses in the region are happy about what was done to the Tyrells. Will most likely continue to support Dany. <br /></p><p>&nbsp;- The Vale: The only support we know is there for Sansa as opposed to Jon/Dany. Even this support is nebulous and depends on SweetRobin. If SweetRobin makes an alliance elsewhere and marries a Dornish princess, then his allegiance is to Dorne and not to the North. <br /></p><p>The others - the Wildlings will support Jon. The Dothraki/unsullied will support Dany, Iron Bank will support the richest candidate, the Citadel are opportunistic idiots, and the small folk don&rsquo;t have a say in who rules over them. <br /></p><p>So this is the current situation. Allying with Dany, gives Jon a lot of political and military power. So why should Sansa protect Jon? From what? <br /></p>",
