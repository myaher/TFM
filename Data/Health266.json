Thank you so much to\u00a0<a href=\"http://clickmetertracking.com/g57n\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RetailMeNot</a>\u00a0for sponsoring this post!\u00a0</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The 2018-2019 preschool year officially kicks off for Chase on Tuesday next week. He\u2019ll be in a Monday through Thursday program for three-year-olds for just under four hours a day and I know he will have the best time! We absolutely love Chase\u2019s preschool (he went two days a week last year) and after attending his orientation on Sunday afternoon, I am even more excited about what the upcoming year holds for Chase!</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Chase-Preschool.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81971\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Chase-Preschool.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"443\" height=\"511\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Chase-Preschool.jpg 666w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Chase-Preschool-260x300.jpg 260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 443px) 100vw, 443px\"/></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This week we\u2019re scrambling to get everything in order before the school year begins. We actually have Chase\u2019s meet the teacher ice cream party at his school today which should be a lot of fun!</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/chase-preschool-2-years-old_thumb.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-78713\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/chase-preschool-2-years-old_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"426\" height=\"426\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/chase-preschool-2-years-old_thumb.jpg 528w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/chase-preschool-2-years-old_thumb-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/chase-preschool-2-years-old_thumb-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/chase-preschool-2-years-old_thumb-450x450.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\"/></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>(Flashback photo to Chase at his preschool\u2019s Meet the Teacher ice cream social last year!)\u00a0</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Before I drop Chase off at preschool on Tuesday morning (and try my hardest to keep my sappy mom tears inside), I am going to do my best to get organized for the school year ahead because something about the start of school \u2014 even preschool \u2014 feels like a fresh slate to me! With all of the craziness of the summer and the big changes in our family (hi, Ryder!), I am trying to take advantage of this exciting time of year to jump back into the swing of things, get organized and kick off some healthy habits.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here are a few ways I\u2019m planning to get myself and our family ready for the 2018-2019 preschool year:</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Preparing for Back to (Pre)School</h4>\n<ul><li dir=\"ltr\">\n<h4>Revisit Meal Planning</h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9365.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83562\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9365-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"518\" height=\"345\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9365-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9365-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9365-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9365-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9365.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 518px) 100vw, 518px\"/></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Oh meal planning! I love you but we admittedly have a bit of a rollercoaster relationship. When life feels crazy, meal planning is one of the first things that often falls to the wayside for me which is horrible because it\u2019s one of the things that helps me feel more organized and less stressed throughout the week! It helps our family eat healthier, save money and look forward to mealtime. With the start of the school year comes packing Chase lunch four days a week and if I want to be sure his lunches are well-rounded, I try to plan them out ahead of time (or at least have a rough idea of what I\u2019ll pack) and this also helps keep me motivated to meal plan our family dinners while I\u2019m making my grocery list as well!</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Interested in meal planning?

I think part of this can be attributed to the fact that ever since Ryder was born, I have neglected keeping up with my planner. This has resulted in a few missed appointments and deadlines and a handful of events seemed to creep up on me at the last minute and left me feeling overwhelmed. Before I attended Chase\u2019s preschool orientation on Sunday, I grabbed my planner and brought it along to encourage myself to get back into the groove of keeping a detailed calendar so I feel organized and activities, deadlines, events, etc. are all in front of me and don\u2019t seemingly creep up out of nowhere.</p>\n<ul><li dir=\"ltr\">\n<h4><strong>Prepare Make-Ahead Meals for Busy Mornings / Snack Time</strong></h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Best-Ever-Morning-Glory-Muffins.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75098\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Best-Ever-Morning-Glory-Muffins.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"408\" height=\"612\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Best-Ever-Morning-Glory-Muffins.jpg 512w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Best-Ever-Morning-Glory-Muffins-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Best-Ever-Morning-Glory-Muffins-300x450.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px\"/></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As I\u2019m sure nearly every parent out there can attest, some mornings feel a bit more scrambled than others. Sometimes we\u2019re in our groove and ease into the day but other mornings I feel like we hit the ground running and I find myself feeling especially grateful for my stash of <a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/toddler-muffin-recipes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">freezer-friendly breakfast muffins</a> on these mornings! I simply reheat one of Chase\u2019s favorite toddler muffins in the microwave for 20 seconds and we have a homemade breakfast on hand in a flash. I almost always have two different kinds of muffins in our freezer to grab at any given time and I\u2019m planning to prepare another batch this weekend for back-to-school breakfasts and after-school snacks!</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If muffins aren\u2019t appealing for your little one, consider <a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/chocolate-superfood-energy-bites/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">energy bites</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/healthy-blender-breakfast-bars-kid-approved/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">breakfast bars</a> or <a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/banana-pecan-coconut-baked-oatmeal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">baked oatmeal</a> for make-ahead breakfast options!</p>\n<ul><li dir=\"ltr\">\n<h4>Create A Weekly To Do List and Revisit It Daily</h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p>This one goes along the same lines as keeping my planner updated but on Sundays, I like to create a to do list for the week and then revisit it every morning to see what the \u201cmust dos\u201d for every day look like before Ryder and Chase are up for the day and everything begins to feel a bit chaotic. There\u2019s something magical about actually taking time to\u00a0<em>write down</em> my weekly and daily to-dos and the feeling of crossing something off my to-do list can\u2019t be beat!</p>\n<ul><li>\n<h4>Wake Up Before the Kids</h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Coffee-You-Are-My-Sunshine-Mug.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-78226\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Coffee-You-Are-My-Sunshine-Mug-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"521\" height=\"347\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Coffee-You-Are-My-Sunshine-Mug.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Coffee-You-Are-My-Sunshine-Mug-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Coffee-You-Are-My-Sunshine-Mug-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Coffee-You-Are-My-Sunshine-Mug-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px\"/></a></p>\n<p>This is my latest must-do! Now that Ryder is sleeping a little better, I am able to wake up at 5 a.m. without feeling like a complete zombie\u2026 most days. I am definitely a morning person and feel like my brain works best first thing in the morning so by setting my alarm for 5 a.m. and cranking out some work before my boys are awake, I begin the day feeling productive. On the days when I opt to sleep in, I almost always regret it because I spend the entire day feeling like I am playing catch up. Sticking to a 5 a.m. wake-up time is crucial for me if I want to feel less stressed and distracted during the day.</p>\n<ul><li>\n<h4>Prioritize Back-to-School Shopping</h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9375.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83563\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9375-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"385\" height=\"578\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9375-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9375-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9375-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9375.jpg 1067w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 385px) 100vw, 385px\"/></a></p>\n<p>Pop into just about any large store this time of year and you\u2019ll see no shortage of back-to-school clothing, supplies and more. Rather than just mindlessly throw things I think Chase will need during the school year into my cart, I\u2019ve opted to do the vast majority of his back-to-preschool shopping online. All parents were provided a list of items to bring to school for their kids as well as a list of voluntary items we could supply to the school for the kids and teachers to use throughout the year. I am always all about a good deal and thankfully <a href=\"http://clickmetertracking.com/g57n\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RetailMeNot</a> helped me save money on some of our back-to-preschool essentials and fall clothing this year!</p>\n<p>I\u2019m sure most of you are quite familiar with <a href=\"http://clickmetertracking.com/g57n\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RetailMeNot</a> by now \u2014 I\u2019ve been using the site and <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2Nqaia8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">app</a> for years now to find great deals, cash back offers and coupons online \u2014 and it\u2019s a great resource for saving money on all of your shopping throughout the year, whether you\u2019re shopping for back-to-school items or other must-haves.

Thank you so much to\u00a0<a href=\"http://clickmetertracking.com/g57n\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RetailMeNot</a>\u00a0for sponsoring this post!\u00a0</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The 2018-2019 preschool year officially kicks off for Chase on Tuesday next week. He\u2019ll be in a Monday through Thursday program for three-year-olds for just under four hours a day and I know he will have the best time! We absolutely love Chase\u2019s preschool (he went two days a week last year) and after attending his orientation on Sunday afternoon, I am even more excited about what the upcoming year holds for Chase!</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Chase-Preschool.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81971\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Chase-Preschool.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"443\" height=\"511\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Chase-Preschool.jpg 666w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Chase-Preschool-260x300.jpg 260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 443px) 100vw, 443px\"></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This week we\u2019re scrambling to get everything in order before the school year begins.

With all of the craziness of the summer and the big changes in our family (hi, Ryder!), I am trying to take advantage of this exciting time of year to jump back into the swing of things, get organized and kick off some healthy habits.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here are a few ways I\u2019m planning to get myself and our family ready for the 2018-2019 preschool year:</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Preparing for Back to (Pre)School</h4>\n<ul><li dir=\"ltr\">\n<h4>Revisit Meal Planning</h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9365.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83562\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9365-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"518\" height=\"345\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9365-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9365-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9365-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9365-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9365.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 518px) 100vw, 518px\"></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Oh meal planning! I love you but we admittedly have a bit of a rollercoaster relationship. When life feels crazy, meal planning is one of the first things that often falls to the wayside for me which is horrible because it\u2019s one of the things that helps me feel more organized and less stressed throughout the week! It helps our family eat healthier, save money and look forward to mealtime. With the start of the school year comes packing Chase lunch four days a week and if I want to be sure his lunches are well-rounded, I try to plan them out ahead of time (or at least have a rough idea of what I\u2019ll pack) and this also helps keep me motivated to meal plan our family dinners while I\u2019m making my grocery list as well!</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Interested in meal planning?

I think part of this can be attributed to the fact that ever since Ryder was born, I have neglected keeping up with my planner. This has resulted in a few missed appointments and deadlines and a handful of events seemed to creep up on me at the last minute and left me feeling overwhelmed. Before I attended Chase\u2019s preschool orientation on Sunday, I grabbed my planner and brought it along to encourage myself to get back into the groove of keeping a detailed calendar so I feel organized and activities, deadlines, events, etc. are all in front of me and don\u2019t seemingly creep up out of nowhere.</p>\n<ul><li dir=\"ltr\">\n<h4><strong>Prepare Make-Ahead Meals for Busy Mornings / Snack Time</strong></h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Best-Ever-Morning-Glory-Muffins.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75098\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Best-Ever-Morning-Glory-Muffins.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"408\" height=\"612\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Best-Ever-Morning-Glory-Muffins.jpg 512w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Best-Ever-Morning-Glory-Muffins-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Best-Ever-Morning-Glory-Muffins-300x450.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px\"></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As I\u2019m sure nearly every parent out there can attest, some mornings feel a bit more scrambled than others. Sometimes we\u2019re in our groove and ease into the day but other mornings I feel like we hit the ground running and I find myself feeling especially grateful for my stash of <a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/toddler-muffin-recipes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">freezer-friendly breakfast muffins</a> on these mornings! I simply reheat one of Chase\u2019s favorite toddler muffins in the microwave for 20 seconds and we have a homemade breakfast on hand in a flash. I almost always have two different kinds of muffins in our freezer to grab at any given time and I\u2019m planning to prepare another batch this weekend for back-to-school breakfasts and after-school snacks!</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If muffins aren\u2019t appealing for your little one, consider <a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/chocolate-superfood-energy-bites/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">energy bites</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/healthy-blender-breakfast-bars-kid-approved/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">breakfast bars</a> or <a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/banana-pecan-coconut-baked-oatmeal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">baked oatmeal</a> for make-ahead breakfast options!</p>\n<ul><li dir=\"ltr\">\n<h4>Create A Weekly To Do List and Revisit It Daily</h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p>This one goes along the same lines as keeping my planner updated but on Sundays, I like to create a to do list for the week and then revisit it every morning to see what the \u201cmust dos\u201d for every day look like before Ryder and Chase are up for the day and everything begins to feel a bit chaotic. There\u2019s something magical about actually taking time to\u00a0<em>write down</em> my weekly and daily to-dos and the feeling of crossing something off my to-do list can\u2019t be beat!</p>\n<ul><li>\n<h4>Wake Up Before the Kids</h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Coffee-You-Are-My-Sunshine-Mug.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-78226\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Coffee-You-Are-My-Sunshine-Mug-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"521\" height=\"347\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Coffee-You-Are-My-Sunshine-Mug.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Coffee-You-Are-My-Sunshine-Mug-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Coffee-You-Are-My-Sunshine-Mug-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Coffee-You-Are-My-Sunshine-Mug-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px\"></a></p>\n<p>This is my latest must-do! Now that Ryder is sleeping a little better, I am able to wake up at 5 a.m. without feeling like a complete zombie\u2026 most days. I am definitely a morning person and feel like my brain works best first thing in the morning so by setting my alarm for 5 a.m. and cranking out some work before my boys are awake, I begin the day feeling productive. On the days when I opt to sleep in, I almost always regret it because I spend the entire day feeling like I am playing catch up. Sticking to a 5 a.m. wake-up time is crucial for me if I want to feel less stressed and distracted during the day.</p>\n<ul><li>\n<h4>Prioritize Back-to-School Shopping</h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9375.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83563\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9375-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"385\" height=\"578\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9375-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9375-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9375-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9375.jpg 1067w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 385px) 100vw, 385px\"></a></p>\n<p>Pop into just about any large store this time of year and you\u2019ll see no shortage of back-to-school clothing, supplies and more. Rather than just mindlessly throw things I think Chase will need during the school year into my cart, I\u2019ve opted to do the vast majority of his back-to-preschool shopping online. All parents were provided a list of items to bring to school for their kids as well as a list of voluntary items we could supply to the school for the kids and teachers to use throughout the year. I am always all about a good deal and thankfully <a href=\"http://clickmetertracking.com/g57n\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RetailMeNot</a> helped me save money on some of our back-to-preschool essentials and fall clothing this year!</p>\n<p>I\u2019m sure most of you are quite familiar with <a href=\"http://clickmetertracking.com/g57n\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RetailMeNot</a> by now \u2014 I\u2019ve been using the site and <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2Nqaia8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">app</a> for years now to find great deals, cash back offers and coupons online \u2014 and it\u2019s a great resource for saving money on all of your shopping throughout the year, whether you\u2019re shopping for back-to-school items or other must-haves.

It helps our family eat healthier, save money and look forward to mealtime. With the start of the school year comes packing Chase lunch four days a week and if I want to be sure his lunches are well-rounded, I try to plan them out ahead of time (or at least have a rough idea of what I\u2019ll pack) and this also helps keep me motivated to meal plan our family dinners while I\u2019m making my grocery list as well!</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Interested in meal planning?

I think part of this can be attributed to the fact that ever since Ryder was born, I have neglected keeping up with my planner. This has resulted in a few missed appointments and deadlines and a handful of events seemed to creep up on me at the last minute and left me feeling overwhelmed. Before I attended Chase\u2019s preschool orientation on Sunday, I grabbed my planner and brought it along to encourage myself to get back into the groove of keeping a detailed calendar so I feel organized and activities, deadlines, events, etc. are all in front of me and don\u2019t seemingly creep up out of nowhere.</p>\n<ul><li dir=\"ltr\">\n<h4><strong>Prepare Make-Ahead Meals for Busy Mornings / Snack Time</strong></h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Best-Ever-Morning-Glory-Muffins.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75098\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Best-Ever-Morning-Glory-Muffins.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"408\" height=\"612\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Best-Ever-Morning-Glory-Muffins.jpg 512w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Best-Ever-Morning-Glory-Muffins-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Best-Ever-Morning-Glory-Muffins-300x450.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px\"></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As I\u2019m sure nearly every parent out there can attest, some mornings feel a bit more scrambled than others.

Sticking to a 5 a.m. wake-up time is crucial for me if I want to feel less stressed and distracted during the day.</p>\n<ul><li>\n<h4>Prioritize Back-to-School Shopping</h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9375-683x1024.jpg\">External image</div></p>\n<p>Pop into just about any large store this time of year and you&rsquo;ll see no shortage of back-to-school clothing, supplies and more.

Usually, nose bleeding doesn&rsquo;t point towards any serious health condition but it can be a sign of:</p><ul><li><strong>Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT): </strong>This is a rare genetic disorder which can lead to nose bleeding and weakening of your blood vessels. If you see tiny red spots on your face, hands and legs or wake up to a bloodied pillow or got any relatives suffering from HHT, consult your doctor. This disease can lead to heart stroke or cause a blood clot in your lungs. </li><li><strong>Dry Sinuses:</strong> It dries your nose, mouth and sinus cavities making them painful and sensitive. It also cracks the skin in your nostril leaving it dry and lead to nose bleeding.</li><li><strong>Other Causes:</strong> You can suffer from nose bleeding due to various causes ranging from picking your nose, hemophilia - inherited nose bleeding disorder, blood thinners, nasal sprays, aspirin, etc. In case you suffer from difficulty in breathing due to nose bleeding or you bleed for a long duration (30 minutes or more) do consult a doctor.</li></ul><h2>Loss Of Sense Of Smell:</h2><p>If you are experiencing a loss of sense of smell it could be a sign of health conditions ranging from diabetes to nasal polyps. Here&rsquo;s all you need to know about it:</p><ul><li><strong>Diabetes:</strong> Though the connection between diabetes and sense of smell is not really clear, the high blood sugar levels can result in damaging organs, blood vessels and nerves which play a crucial role in letting your sensory organs smell complex odours. There are chances that diabetes can affect your endocrine system - which includes all the hormone-producing glands in our body - and end up interfering with your nose and affecting your smelling ability.</li><li><strong>Nasal Polyps:</strong> These are harmless non-cancerous, painless, soft growths in the nasal passages and lead to the loss of sense of smell by preventing the smell to reach the right cells. These can be removed surgically or treated with the help of medication.</li><li><strong>Neurodegenerative Disease:</strong> If you feel your ability to smell have depleted you should consult a doctor immediately as it could be a symptom of the onset of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer&rsquo;s or Parkinson&rsquo;s disease. Though these ailments are incurable you can get some aid from the medic in easing the symptoms and taking important precautions. </li></ul><h2>Phantom Smell:</h2><p>This refers to smelling something good or bad which doesn&rsquo;t really exist. It can be a symptom of serious health conditions. One or both your nostrils get affected in this condition. Phantom smell can be an outcome of:</p><ul><li><strong>Sinus Infection: </strong>Phantom smell can be caused due to an infected sinus, your doctor might ask you to use saline water solution to rinse your sinuses to get rid of the infection. Phantom smell phenomenon might go away itself within a span of a few months. </li><li><strong>Brain Disorder: </strong>You may experience smelling something that doesn&rsquo;t exist once or multiple times. It can be because of head injuries, brain tumour, neurogenerative diseases, etc. Looking at the seriousness of the condition, you should get checked by a doctor to figure out the exact cause behind it and get treated.</li></ul><p>Rosacea: <br/>This condition is marked by reddening or thickening of the skin of your nose. A subtype of severe rosacea which is called rhinophyma results in the change in shape of the nose and triggers breathing difficulty. This is found to be common amongst men.</p><p>Nasal Mucus:<br/>Did you know that the colour of your nasal mucus can help you detect infections?<br/>Coloured Mucus: If your snot is yellow or green-coloured, it can be a sign of viral or bacterial infections and you should consult your doctor to get medicated with antibiotics to treat the infection.<br/>Brown Mucus: Various causes can turn your snot brown-coloured, severe air pollution, excess consumption of tobacco, dried blood, etc. If your surrounding environment is too polluted, then avoid outdoor exercises and switch to an indoor workout. Also, wear a mask when you step out to prevent inhaling dust and debris.<br/>Black Mucus: If you notice that the colour of your nasal mucus is black, it can be symptom a serious condition or fungal infection caused by fungus in your respiratory system. It could also be because of inhaling dust in excess.

These can be removed surgically or treated with the help of medication.</li><li><strong>Neurodegenerative Disease:</strong> If you feel your ability to smell have depleted you should consult a doctor immediately as it could be a symptom of the onset of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Though these ailments are incurable you can get some aid from the medic in easing the symptoms and taking important precautions. </li></ul><h2>Phantom Smell:</h2><p>This refers to smelling something good or bad which doesn\u2019t really exist. It can be a symptom of serious health conditions. One or both your nostrils get affected in this condition. Phantom smell can be an outcome of:</p><ul><li><strong>Sinus Infection: </strong>Phantom smell can be caused due to an infected sinus, your doctor might ask you to use saline water solution to rinse your sinuses to get rid of the infection. Phantom smell phenomenon might go away itself within a span of a few months. </li><li><strong>Brain Disorder: </strong>You may experience smelling something that doesn\u2019t exist once or multiple times. It can be because of head injuries, brain tumour, neurogenerative diseases, etc. Looking at the seriousness of the condition, you should get checked by a doctor to figure out the exact cause behind it and get treated.</li></ul><p>Rosacea: <br>This condition is marked by reddening or thickening of the skin of your nose. A subtype of severe rosacea which is called rhinophyma results in the change in shape of the nose and triggers breathing difficulty. This is found to be common amongst men.</p><p>Nasal Mucus:<br>Did you know that the colour of your nasal mucus can help you detect infections?<br>Coloured Mucus: If your snot is yellow or green-coloured, it can be a sign of viral or bacterial infections and you should consult your doctor to get medicated with antibiotics to treat the infection.<br>Brown Mucus: Various causes can turn your snot brown-coloured, severe air pollution, excess consumption of tobacco, dried blood, etc. If your surrounding environment is too polluted, then avoid outdoor exercises and switch to an indoor workout. Also, wear a mask when you step out to prevent inhaling dust and debris.<br>Black Mucus: If you notice that the colour of your nasal mucus is black, it can be symptom a serious condition or fungal infection caused by fungus in your respiratory system. It could also be because of inhaling dust in excess.

This disease can lead to heart stroke or cause a blood clot in your lungs. </li><li><strong>Dry Sinuses:</strong> It dries your nose, mouth and sinus cavities making them painful and sensitive. It also cracks the skin in your nostril leaving it dry and lead to nose bleeding.</li><li><strong>Other Causes:</strong> You can suffer from nose bleeding due to various causes ranging from picking your nose, hemophilia - inherited nose bleeding disorder, blood thinners, nasal sprays, aspirin, etc. In case you suffer from difficulty in breathing due to nose bleeding or you bleed for a long duration (30 minutes or more) do consult a doctor.</li></ul><h2>Loss Of Sense Of Smell:</h2><p>If you are experiencing a loss of sense of smell it could be a sign of health conditions ranging from diabetes to nasal polyps.

Thank you so much to\u00a0<a href=\"http://clickmetertracking.com/g57n\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RetailMeNot</a>\u00a0for sponsoring this post!\u00a0</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The 2018-2019 preschool year officially kicks off for Chase on Tuesday next week. He\u2019ll be in a Monday through Thursday program for three-year-olds for just under four hours a day and I know he will have the best time! We absolutely love Chase\u2019s preschool (he went two days a week last year) and after attending his orientation on Sunday afternoon, I am even more excited about what the upcoming year holds for Chase!</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Chase-Preschool.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81971\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Chase-Preschool.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"443\" height=\"511\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Chase-Preschool.jpg 666w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Chase-Preschool-260x300.jpg 260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 443px) 100vw, 443px\"/></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This week we\u2019re scrambling to get everything in order before the school year begins.

With all of the craziness of the summer and the big changes in our family (hi, Ryder!), I am trying to take advantage of this exciting time of year to jump back into the swing of things, get organized and kick off some healthy habits.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here are a few ways I\u2019m planning to get myself and our family ready for the 2018-2019 preschool year:</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Preparing for Back to (Pre)School</h4>\n<ul><li dir=\"ltr\">\n<h4>Revisit Meal Planning</h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9365.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83562\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9365-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"518\" height=\"345\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9365-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9365-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9365-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9365-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9365.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 518px) 100vw, 518px\"/></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Oh meal planning! I love you but we admittedly have a bit of a rollercoaster relationship. When life feels crazy, meal planning is one of the first things that often falls to the wayside for me which is horrible because it\u2019s one of the things that helps me feel more organized and less stressed throughout the week! It helps our family eat healthier, save money and look forward to mealtime. With the start of the school year comes packing Chase lunch four days a week and if I want to be sure his lunches are well-rounded, I try to plan them out ahead of time (or at least have a rough idea of what I\u2019ll pack) and this also helps keep me motivated to meal plan our family dinners while I\u2019m making my grocery list as well!</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Interested in meal planning?

I think part of this can be attributed to the fact that ever since Ryder was born, I have neglected keeping up with my planner. This has resulted in a few missed appointments and deadlines and a handful of events seemed to creep up on me at the last minute and left me feeling overwhelmed. Before I attended Chase\u2019s preschool orientation on Sunday, I grabbed my planner and brought it along to encourage myself to get back into the groove of keeping a detailed calendar so I feel organized and activities, deadlines, events, etc. are all in front of me and don\u2019t seemingly creep up out of nowhere.</p>\n<ul><li dir=\"ltr\">\n<h4><strong>Prepare Make-Ahead Meals for Busy Mornings / Snack Time</strong></h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Best-Ever-Morning-Glory-Muffins.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75098\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Best-Ever-Morning-Glory-Muffins.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"408\" height=\"612\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Best-Ever-Morning-Glory-Muffins.jpg 512w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Best-Ever-Morning-Glory-Muffins-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Best-Ever-Morning-Glory-Muffins-300x450.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px\"/></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As I\u2019m sure nearly every parent out there can attest, some mornings feel a bit more scrambled than others. Sometimes we\u2019re in our groove and ease into the day but other mornings I feel like we hit the ground running and I find myself feeling especially grateful for my stash of <a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/toddler-muffin-recipes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">freezer-friendly breakfast muffins</a> on these mornings! I simply reheat one of Chase\u2019s favorite toddler muffins in the microwave for 20 seconds and we have a homemade breakfast on hand in a flash. I almost always have two different kinds of muffins in our freezer to grab at any given time and I\u2019m planning to prepare another batch this weekend for back-to-school breakfasts and after-school snacks!</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If muffins aren\u2019t appealing for your little one, consider <a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/chocolate-superfood-energy-bites/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">energy bites</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/healthy-blender-breakfast-bars-kid-approved/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">breakfast bars</a> or <a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/banana-pecan-coconut-baked-oatmeal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">baked oatmeal</a> for make-ahead breakfast options!</p>\n<ul><li dir=\"ltr\">\n<h4>Create A Weekly To Do List and Revisit It Daily</h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p>This one goes along the same lines as keeping my planner updated but on Sundays, I like to create a to do list for the week and then revisit it every morning to see what the \u201cmust dos\u201d for every day look like before Ryder and Chase are up for the day and everything begins to feel a bit chaotic. There\u2019s something magical about actually taking time to\u00a0<em>write down</em> my weekly and daily to-dos and the feeling of crossing something off my to-do list can\u2019t be beat!</p>\n<ul><li>\n<h4>Wake Up Before the Kids</h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Coffee-You-Are-My-Sunshine-Mug.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-78226\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Coffee-You-Are-My-Sunshine-Mug-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"521\" height=\"347\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Coffee-You-Are-My-Sunshine-Mug.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Coffee-You-Are-My-Sunshine-Mug-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Coffee-You-Are-My-Sunshine-Mug-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Coffee-You-Are-My-Sunshine-Mug-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px\"/></a></p>\n<p>This is my latest must-do! Now that Ryder is sleeping a little better, I am able to wake up at 5 a.m. without feeling like a complete zombie\u2026 most days. I am definitely a morning person and feel like my brain works best first thing in the morning so by setting my alarm for 5 a.m. and cranking out some work before my boys are awake, I begin the day feeling productive. On the days when I opt to sleep in, I almost always regret it because I spend the entire day feeling like I am playing catch up. Sticking to a 5 a.m. wake-up time is crucial for me if I want to feel less stressed and distracted during the day.</p>\n<ul><li>\n<h4>Prioritize Back-to-School Shopping</h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9375.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83563\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9375-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"385\" height=\"578\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9375-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9375-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9375-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9375.jpg 1067w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 385px) 100vw, 385px\"/></a></p>\n<p>Pop into just about any large store this time of year and you\u2019ll see no shortage of back-to-school clothing, supplies and more. Rather than just mindlessly throw things I think Chase will need during the school year into my cart, I\u2019ve opted to do the vast majority of his back-to-preschool shopping online. All parents were provided a list of items to bring to school for their kids as well as a list of voluntary items we could supply to the school for the kids and teachers to use throughout the year. I am always all about a good deal and thankfully <a href=\"http://clickmetertracking.com/g57n\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RetailMeNot</a> helped me save money on some of our back-to-preschool essentials and fall clothing this year!</p>\n<p>I\u2019m sure most of you are quite familiar with <a href=\"http://clickmetertracking.com/g57n\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RetailMeNot</a> by now \u2014 I\u2019ve been using the site and <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2Nqaia8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">app</a> for years now to find great deals, cash back offers and coupons online \u2014 and it\u2019s a great resource for saving money on all of your shopping throughout the year, whether you\u2019re shopping for back-to-school items or other must-haves.

Thank you so much to\u00a0<a href=\"http://clickmetertracking.com/g57n\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RetailMeNot</a>\u00a0for sponsoring this post!\u00a0</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The 2018-2019 preschool year officially kicks off for Chase on Tuesday next week. He\u2019ll be in a Monday through Thursday program for three-year-olds for just under four hours a day and I know he will have the best time! We absolutely love Chase\u2019s preschool (he went two days a week last year) and after attending his orientation on Sunday afternoon, I am even more excited about what the upcoming year holds for Chase!</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Chase-Preschool.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-81971\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Chase-Preschool.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"443\" height=\"511\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Chase-Preschool.jpg 666w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Chase-Preschool-260x300.jpg 260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 443px) 100vw, 443px\"></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This week we\u2019re scrambling to get everything in order before the school year begins.

With all of the craziness of the summer and the big changes in our family (hi, Ryder!), I am trying to take advantage of this exciting time of year to jump back into the swing of things, get organized and kick off some healthy habits.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here are a few ways I\u2019m planning to get myself and our family ready for the 2018-2019 preschool year:</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Preparing for Back to (Pre)School</h4>\n<ul><li dir=\"ltr\">\n<h4>Revisit Meal Planning</h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9365.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83562\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9365-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"518\" height=\"345\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9365-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9365-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9365-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9365-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9365.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 518px) 100vw, 518px\"></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Oh meal planning! I love you but we admittedly have a bit of a rollercoaster relationship. When life feels crazy, meal planning is one of the first things that often falls to the wayside for me which is horrible because it\u2019s one of the things that helps me feel more organized and less stressed throughout the week! It helps our family eat healthier, save money and look forward to mealtime. With the start of the school year comes packing Chase lunch four days a week and if I want to be sure his lunches are well-rounded, I try to plan them out ahead of time (or at least have a rough idea of what I\u2019ll pack) and this also helps keep me motivated to meal plan our family dinners while I\u2019m making my grocery list as well!</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Interested in meal planning?

I think part of this can be attributed to the fact that ever since Ryder was born, I have neglected keeping up with my planner. This has resulted in a few missed appointments and deadlines and a handful of events seemed to creep up on me at the last minute and left me feeling overwhelmed. Before I attended Chase\u2019s preschool orientation on Sunday, I grabbed my planner and brought it along to encourage myself to get back into the groove of keeping a detailed calendar so I feel organized and activities, deadlines, events, etc. are all in front of me and don\u2019t seemingly creep up out of nowhere.</p>\n<ul><li dir=\"ltr\">\n<h4><strong>Prepare Make-Ahead Meals for Busy Mornings / Snack Time</strong></h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Best-Ever-Morning-Glory-Muffins.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75098\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Best-Ever-Morning-Glory-Muffins.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"408\" height=\"612\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Best-Ever-Morning-Glory-Muffins.jpg 512w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Best-Ever-Morning-Glory-Muffins-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Best-Ever-Morning-Glory-Muffins-300x450.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px\"></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As I\u2019m sure nearly every parent out there can attest, some mornings feel a bit more scrambled than others. Sometimes we\u2019re in our groove and ease into the day but other mornings I feel like we hit the ground running and I find myself feeling especially grateful for my stash of <a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/toddler-muffin-recipes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">freezer-friendly breakfast muffins</a> on these mornings! I simply reheat one of Chase\u2019s favorite toddler muffins in the microwave for 20 seconds and we have a homemade breakfast on hand in a flash. I almost always have two different kinds of muffins in our freezer to grab at any given time and I\u2019m planning to prepare another batch this weekend for back-to-school breakfasts and after-school snacks!</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If muffins aren\u2019t appealing for your little one, consider <a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/chocolate-superfood-energy-bites/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">energy bites</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/healthy-blender-breakfast-bars-kid-approved/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">breakfast bars</a> or <a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/banana-pecan-coconut-baked-oatmeal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">baked oatmeal</a> for make-ahead breakfast options!</p>\n<ul><li dir=\"ltr\">\n<h4>Create A Weekly To Do List and Revisit It Daily</h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p>This one goes along the same lines as keeping my planner updated but on Sundays, I like to create a to do list for the week and then revisit it every morning to see what the \u201cmust dos\u201d for every day look like before Ryder and Chase are up for the day and everything begins to feel a bit chaotic. There\u2019s something magical about actually taking time to\u00a0<em>write down</em> my weekly and daily to-dos and the feeling of crossing something off my to-do list can\u2019t be beat!</p>\n<ul><li>\n<h4>Wake Up Before the Kids</h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Coffee-You-Are-My-Sunshine-Mug.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-78226\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Coffee-You-Are-My-Sunshine-Mug-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"521\" height=\"347\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Coffee-You-Are-My-Sunshine-Mug.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Coffee-You-Are-My-Sunshine-Mug-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Coffee-You-Are-My-Sunshine-Mug-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Coffee-You-Are-My-Sunshine-Mug-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px\"></a></p>\n<p>This is my latest must-do! Now that Ryder is sleeping a little better, I am able to wake up at 5 a.m. without feeling like a complete zombie\u2026 most days. I am definitely a morning person and feel like my brain works best first thing in the morning so by setting my alarm for 5 a.m. and cranking out some work before my boys are awake, I begin the day feeling productive. On the days when I opt to sleep in, I almost always regret it because I spend the entire day feeling like I am playing catch up. Sticking to a 5 a.m. wake-up time is crucial for me if I want to feel less stressed and distracted during the day.</p>\n<ul><li>\n<h4>Prioritize Back-to-School Shopping</h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9375.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83563\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9375-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"385\" height=\"578\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9375-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9375-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9375-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9375.jpg 1067w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 385px) 100vw, 385px\"></a></p>\n<p>Pop into just about any large store this time of year and you\u2019ll see no shortage of back-to-school clothing, supplies and more. Rather than just mindlessly throw things I think Chase will need during the school year into my cart, I\u2019ve opted to do the vast majority of his back-to-preschool shopping online. All parents were provided a list of items to bring to school for their kids as well as a list of voluntary items we could supply to the school for the kids and teachers to use throughout the year. I am always all about a good deal and thankfully <a href=\"http://clickmetertracking.com/g57n\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RetailMeNot</a> helped me save money on some of our back-to-preschool essentials and fall clothing this year!</p>\n<p>I\u2019m sure most of you are quite familiar with <a href=\"http://clickmetertracking.com/g57n\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RetailMeNot</a> by now \u2014 I\u2019ve been using the site and <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2Nqaia8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">app</a> for years now to find great deals, cash back offers and coupons online \u2014 and it\u2019s a great resource for saving money on all of your shopping throughout the year, whether you\u2019re shopping for back-to-school items or other must-haves.

With all of the craziness of the summer and the big changes in our family (hi, Ryder!), I am trying to take advantage of this exciting time of year to jump back into the swing of things, get organized and kick off some healthy habits.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here are a few ways I\u2019m planning to get myself and our family ready for the 2018-2019 preschool year:</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Preparing for Back to (Pre)School</h4>\n<ul><li dir=\"ltr\">\n<h4>Revisit Meal Planning</h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9365.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83562\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9365-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"518\" height=\"345\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9365-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9365-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9365-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9365-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9365.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 518px) 100vw, 518px\"></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Oh meal planning! I love you but we admittedly have a bit of a rollercoaster relationship. When life feels crazy, meal planning is one of the first things that often falls to the wayside for me which is horrible because it\u2019s one of the things that helps me feel more organized and less stressed throughout the week! It helps our family eat healthier, save money and look forward to mealtime. With the start of the school year comes packing Chase lunch four days a week and if I want to be sure his lunches are well-rounded, I try to plan them out ahead of time (or at least have a rough idea of what I\u2019ll pack) and this also helps keep me motivated to meal plan our family dinners while I\u2019m making my grocery list as well!</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Interested in meal planning?

I think part of this can be attributed to the fact that ever since Ryder was born, I have neglected keeping up with my planner. This has resulted in a few missed appointments and deadlines and a handful of events seemed to creep up on me at the last minute and left me feeling overwhelmed. Before I attended Chase\u2019s preschool orientation on Sunday, I grabbed my planner and brought it along to encourage myself to get back into the groove of keeping a detailed calendar so I feel organized and activities, deadlines, events, etc. are all in front of me and don\u2019t seemingly creep up out of nowhere.</p>\n<ul><li dir=\"ltr\">\n<h4><strong>Prepare Make-Ahead Meals for Busy Mornings / Snack Time</strong></h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Best-Ever-Morning-Glory-Muffins.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-75098\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Best-Ever-Morning-Glory-Muffins.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"408\" height=\"612\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Best-Ever-Morning-Glory-Muffins.jpg 512w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Best-Ever-Morning-Glory-Muffins-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Best-Ever-Morning-Glory-Muffins-300x450.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px\"></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As I\u2019m sure nearly every parent out there can attest, some mornings feel a bit more scrambled than others. Sometimes we\u2019re in our groove and ease into the day but other mornings I feel like we hit the ground running and I find myself feeling especially grateful for my stash of <a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/toddler-muffin-recipes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">freezer-friendly breakfast muffins</a> on these mornings! I simply reheat one of Chase\u2019s favorite toddler muffins in the microwave for 20 seconds and we have a homemade breakfast on hand in a flash. I almost always have two different kinds of muffins in our freezer to grab at any given time and I\u2019m planning to prepare another batch this weekend for back-to-school breakfasts and after-school snacks!</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If muffins aren\u2019t appealing for your little one, consider <a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/chocolate-superfood-energy-bites/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">energy bites</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/healthy-blender-breakfast-bars-kid-approved/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">breakfast bars</a> or <a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/banana-pecan-coconut-baked-oatmeal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">baked oatmeal</a> for make-ahead breakfast options!</p>\n<ul><li dir=\"ltr\">\n<h4>Create A Weekly To Do List and Revisit It Daily</h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p>This one goes along the same lines as keeping my planner updated but on Sundays, I like to create a to do list for the week and then revisit it every morning to see what the \u201cmust dos\u201d for every day look like before Ryder and Chase are up for the day and everything begins to feel a bit chaotic. There\u2019s something magical about actually taking time to\u00a0<em>write down</em> my weekly and daily to-dos and the feeling of crossing something off my to-do list can\u2019t be beat!</p>\n<ul><li>\n<h4>Wake Up Before the Kids</h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Coffee-You-Are-My-Sunshine-Mug.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-78226\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Coffee-You-Are-My-Sunshine-Mug-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"521\" height=\"347\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Coffee-You-Are-My-Sunshine-Mug.jpg 1024w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Coffee-You-Are-My-Sunshine-Mug-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Coffee-You-Are-My-Sunshine-Mug-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Coffee-You-Are-My-Sunshine-Mug-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px\"></a></p>\n<p>This is my latest must-do! Now that Ryder is sleeping a little better, I am able to wake up at 5 a.m. without feeling like a complete zombie\u2026 most days. I am definitely a morning person and feel like my brain works best first thing in the morning so by setting my alarm for 5 a.m. and cranking out some work before my boys are awake, I begin the day feeling productive. On the days when I opt to sleep in, I almost always regret it because I spend the entire day feeling like I am playing catch up. Sticking to a 5 a.m. wake-up time is crucial for me if I want to feel less stressed and distracted during the day.</p>\n<ul><li>\n<h4>Prioritize Back-to-School Shopping</h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9375.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-83563\" src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9375-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"385\" height=\"578\" srcset=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9375-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9375-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9375-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9375.jpg 1067w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 385px) 100vw, 385px\"></a></p>\n<p>Pop into just about any large store this time of year and you\u2019ll see no shortage of back-to-school clothing, supplies and more.

Now that Ryder is sleeping a little better, I am able to wake up at 5 a.m. without feeling like a complete zombie&hellip; most days. I am definitely a morning person and feel like my brain works best first thing in the morning so by setting my alarm for 5 a.m. and cranking out some work before my boys are awake, I begin the day feeling productive. On the days when I opt to sleep in, I almost always regret it because I spend the entire day feeling like I am playing catch up. Sticking to a 5 a.m. wake-up time is crucial for me if I want to feel less stressed and distracted during the day.</p>\n<ul><li>\n<h4>Prioritize Back-to-School Shopping</h4>\n</li>\n</ul><p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9375-683x1024.jpg\">External image</div></p>\n<p>Pop into just about any large store this time of year and you&rsquo;ll see no shortage of back-to-school clothing, supplies and more. Rather than just mindlessly throw things I think Chase will need during the school year into my cart, I&rsquo;ve opted to do the vast majority of his back-to-preschool shopping online. All parents were provided a list of items to bring to school for their kids as well as a list of voluntary items we could supply to the school for the kids and teachers to use throughout the year. I am always all about a good deal and thankfully <a href=\"http://clickmetertracking.com/g57n\" target=\"_blank\">RetailMeNot</a> helped me save money on some of our back-to-preschool essentials and fall clothing this year!</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m sure most of you are quite familiar with <a href=\"http://clickmetertracking.com/g57n\" target=\"_blank\">RetailMeNot</a> by now &mdash; I&rsquo;ve been using the site and <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2Nqaia8\" target=\"_blank\">app</a> for years now to find great deals, cash back offers and coupons online &mdash; and it&rsquo;s a great resource for saving money on all of your shopping throughout the year, whether you&rsquo;re shopping for back-to-school items or other must-haves. (It&rsquo;s actually how I find a lot of the deals I share with you guys in some of my Things I&rsquo;m Loving Friday sale roundups!)</p>\n<p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://www.pbfingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9379-738x1024.jpg\">External image</div></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://clickmetertracking.com/g57n\" target=\"_blank\">RetailMeNot</a> actually just released a new <a href=\"http://clickmetertracking.com/6kmj\">Genie browser extension</a> to automatically find and apply promo codes and cashback offers for you at checkout when you shop online so you can completely bypass the step of searching for promo codes on your own!

She focuses on volume for one session a week, lifting about 70 per cent of her maximum weight for five sets of five reps, and intensity for the other, aiming for five sets of one rep at her maximum. </p> <p>\u201cEach week, all being well, the maximum moves up a tiny bit,\u201d says Dr Walter.</p> <figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"912\" data-orig-width=\"1368\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en-GB/homerun/the_independent_577/b3468acc5c9b1582c288d4ec76e4d043\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d89da53d894c75ed75606cde82d9636a/tumblr_inline_pe9ljsFrgZ1ueqzl4_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"912\" data-orig-width=\"1368\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en-GB/homerun/the_independent_577/b3468acc5c9b1582c288d4ec76e4d043\"/></figure><p>And this is one of the reasons she loves lifting so much: \u201cI love seeing the weights get heavier and heavier. I even like it that sometimes I have to live with plateauing or reducing my weights, for example when I\u2019ve been ill, because it teaches me resilience.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Walter is passionate about weight lifting for many reasons.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I have a really heavy weight on my shoulders, I feel as if lifting it is what my body is made to do - it just feels right,\u201d she explains. \u201cAlso, when I&rsquo;m lifting, I can\u2019t be thinking of anything else - I have to be right there, in the moment, with the basic elements - the bar, the weights, and my body, in a kind of mindfulness. </p><!--ReadMoreRemoved-->  <p>\u201cI love pushing the limits of what I can lift, and knowing that if I never fail, I\u2019m not being brave enough. I love the camaraderie of women at the bar: each woman in our club competes only against herself, and has her own goals, which may be strength in the context of a disability, or general fitness, or competitive powerlifting. </p> <p>\u201cI love it that the focus is on what our bodies can do instead of on how our bodies look. I love seeing students realise that a long-term goal can be achieved in small increments, and not just in the gym. </p> <p>\u201cI love the fact that at 71, I have the bone density of a 20-year-old, and that this is largely due to lifting. I love having a coach who is enormously knowledgeable, who is one of the best teachers of anything I have ever had, and who is thoughtfully, strongly committed to helping women lift heavy weights. </p> <p>\u201cAnd to be honest, I do get a bit of a kick out of competing, setting national and world records, and taking my club members along to competitions.\u201d</p>   <p>Dr Walter\u2019s next challenge is set to tie in with her 72nd birthday on October 3 - she will attempt to deadlift a total of 7,200 pounds in an hour, which is about 55 times her bodyweight.</p> <p>\u201cI figured it would be fun to do this in multiples of my own body weight,\u201d she says. \u201cI weigh 58.5kg, so I am going to lift 60kg in sets of five for 11 sets: 55 reps in all. That will make 3,300kg or 7,275 pounds. </p> <p>\u201c60 kilos is about 60 per cent of my maximum deadlift, which should be comfortable, but it\u2019s a lot of reps!\u201d</p> <p>The Linacre Ladies that Lift are <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/catherine039s-72nd-bday-fundraiser\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">hoping to raise \u00a32,000 for the club through people sponsoring Dr Walter</a> in her challenge, and are currently more than halfway towards their target at \u00a31,042.</p> <p>As well as raising money, however, Dr Walter hopes to encourage other women to try weightlifting. </p> <figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"912\" data-orig-width=\"1368\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en-GB/homerun/the_independent_577/e4ea036094c0c3330e0420b5f8331dd7\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3982d4fed02ea6f8534a264f9f4ddf59/tumblr_inline_pe9lju6wNS1ueqzl4_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"912\" data-orig-width=\"1368\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en-GB/homerun/the_independent_577/e4ea036094c0c3330e0420b5f8331dd7\"/></figure><p>\u201cNervousness is not unreasonable,\u201d she says. \u201cIn some gyms, some men (not usually the ones who lift very well) deliberately try to intimidate women who lift. So go online, for example to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/481508715506/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">the Facebook page of the British Drug Free Powerlifting Association</a>, or the Lady Lifters group on <a href=\"https://www.fitocracy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">fitocracy.com</a>, and ask the group about a gym near you that is likely to be friendly to women who want to lift.\u201d</p> <p>She also believes it\u2019s never too late to find a sport or type of exercise you love. </p> <p>\u201cIn school, I was always labelled \u2018not good at sport\u2019,\u201d says Dr Walter. \u201cClearly it just took me 65 years to find the sport I am good at!\u201d</p> <p><em>You can watch the short film Ladies that Lift, by Tabac Creative in full <a href=\"http://www.tabaccreative.com/ladiesthatlift\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</em></p> <figure data-orig-height=\"1\" data-orig-width=\"1\" data-orig-src=\"https://ssc.independent.co.uk/b/ss/indepdev/1/H.27.5--NS/0?c25=8512766\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/58b6eab85c3d693580ce3b2d5e559c37/tumblr_inline_pe9ljvYtAo1ueqzl4_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"1\" data-orig-width=\"1\" data-orig-src=\"https://ssc.independent.co.uk/b/ss/indepdev/1/H.27.5--NS/0?c25=8512766\"/></figure>",

I love the camaraderie of women at the bar: each woman in our club competes only against herself, and has her own goals, which may be strength in the context of a disability, or general fitness, or competitive powerlifting. </p> <p>&ldquo;I love it that the focus is on what our bodies can do instead of on how our bodies look. I love seeing students realise that a long-term goal can be achieved in small increments, and not just in the gym. </p> <p>&ldquo;I love the fact that at 71, I have the bone density of a 20-year-old, and that this is largely due to lifting. I love having a coach who is enormously knowledgeable, who is one of the best teachers of anything I have ever had, and who is thoughtfully, strongly committed to helping women lift heavy weights. </p> <p>&ldquo;And to be honest, I do get a bit of a kick out of competing, setting national and world records, and taking my club members along to competitions.&rdquo;</p>   <p>Dr Walter&rsquo;s next challenge is set to tie in with her 72nd birthday on October 3 - she will attempt to deadlift a total of 7,200 pounds in an hour, which is about 55 times her bodyweight.</p> <p>&ldquo;I figured it would be fun to do this in multiples of my own body weight,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I weigh 58.5kg, so I am going to lift 60kg in sets of five for 11 sets: 55 reps in all. That will make 3,300kg or 7,275 pounds. </p> <p>&ldquo;60 kilos is about 60 per cent of my maximum deadlift, which should be comfortable, but it&rsquo;s a lot of reps!&rdquo;</p> <p>The Linacre Ladies that Lift are <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/catherine039s-72nd-bday-fundraiser\" target=\"_blank\">hoping to raise &pound;2,000 for the club through people sponsoring Dr Walter</a> in her challenge, and are currently more than halfway towards their target at &pound;1,042.</p> <p>As well as raising money, however, Dr Walter hopes to encourage other women to try weightlifting. </p> <figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3982d4fed02ea6f8534a264f9f4ddf59/tumblr_inline_pe9lju6wNS1ueqzl4_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>&ldquo;Nervousness is not unreasonable,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;In some gyms, some men (not usually the ones who lift very well) deliberately try to intimidate women who lift. So go online, for example to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/481508715506/\" target=\"_blank\">the Facebook page of the British Drug Free Powerlifting Association</a>, or the Lady Lifters group on <a href=\"https://www.fitocracy.com/\" target=\"_blank\">fitocracy.com</a>, and ask the group about a gym near you that is likely to be friendly to women who want to lift.&rdquo;</p> <p>She also believes it&rsquo;s never too late to find a sport or type of exercise you love. </p> <p>&ldquo;In school, I was always labelled &lsquo;not good at sport&rsquo;,&rdquo; says Dr Walter. &ldquo;Clearly it just took me 65 years to find the sport I am good at!&rdquo;</p> <p><em>You can watch the short film Ladies that Lift, by Tabac Creative in full <a href=\"http://www.tabaccreative.com/ladiesthatlift\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</em></p> <figure><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/58b6eab85c3d693580ce3b2d5e559c37/tumblr_inline_pe9ljvYtAo1ueqzl4_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure></p>",
