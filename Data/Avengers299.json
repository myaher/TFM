It had been a while since you had been this dressed up for something, well, someone. </p><p>You were wearing your favourite colour, which was rare to you, as they always told you they hated it, and that it didn&rsquo;t suit you. Seeing yourself in that colour now felt weird, but also quite relieving.</p><p>You had been in a relationship with your ex for over two years, and even though you broke up with them months ago, everything they did still played on your mind. The way they would tell you what you could and couldn&rsquo;t wear, who you could and couldn&rsquo;t talk to. The way they acted around you made it increasingly difficult to bond with other people after the two of you had broken up, however you had found what appeared to be a bond with Steve Rogers, the guy who had saved your life a month earlier. </p><p>It was typical really, you were cornered by a strange man, and Steve just so happened to be passing by and of course he jumped in to save you. He gave you his number (which you didn&rsquo;t expect, with him being the man out of time and all), and it took you a few weeks to work up the courage to text him, but eventually you did and you both set a date, which was today.</p><p><br/></p><p><i><b>\u2661 turn the lock and put my headphones on, he always said he didn&rsquo;t get this song but i do, i do \u2661</b></i></p><p><br/></p><p>You sighed to yourself, deciding that you should probably set off to meet Steve at the cafe, you didn&rsquo;t want to be late for your first date.</p><p>You grabbed your purse, house keys, headphones and a jacket, and left your apartment, locking the door and checking it three times. </p><p>You pulled your headphones on and plugged your phone in, immediately opening spotify to play your favourite song, it only seemed right that your favourite song could possibly give you good luck on a very important day. </p><p>Listening carefully to the song, your mind began to wander to your ex. They always said you had a bad taste in music, that they didn&rsquo;t understand the songs you listened to, and you had to sit back and agree with them. But you still loved the music you listened to, and you understood every word of them.</p><p>Eventually, you sighed and pushed the thoughts of him out of your head, and walked quickly to the cafe where you would be meeting Steve in central Manhattan. </p><p><br/></p><p><i><b>\u2661 walked in expecting you&rsquo;d be late but you got here early and you stand and wave, i walk to you. you pull my chair out and help me in, and you don&rsquo;t know how nice that is, but i do \u2661</b></i></p><p><br/></p><p>You stood in front of the cafe where you would meet Steve and took a deep breath, straightening your outfit. You peered inside, looking for him for a few seconds. You didn&rsquo;t expect him to be there already, but it would be nice if he was.</p><p>Eventually, you spotted him, and your face lit up. He was sat in a small corner, and it seemed that as soon as you saw him, he glanced up and made eye contact with you, almost like he knew you were looking over at him. </p><p>Steve gave you a small wave and stood up, and you pushed the door to the cafe open and made your way over to where he was sat. You gave him a small smile, &ldquo;Hi&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>He grinned and pulled out your chair, &ldquo;Hey, you look&hellip;amazing.&rdquo;</p><p>You shook your head, a grin on your features, &ldquo;Oh, no, I wouldn&rsquo;t say that&hellip;.&rdquo;</p><p>He just smiled at you softly, and you smiled back at him. It had been a while since you had smiled genuinely. Your ex never made you feel the way Steve did, appreciated. Everything Steve did seemed to be the opposite of what your ex did, and you loved it.</p><p><br/></p><p><i><b>\u2661 and you throw your head back laughing like a little kid. i think your strange that you think I&rsquo;m funny cause he never did \u2661</b></i></p><p><br/></p><p>You and Steve had been sat in the cafe talking for an hour about anything and everything. You had taken it in turns to pay for coffee or cake, or whatever the two of you fancied in that moment. You had already written this date down as the best.</p><p>You smiled, telling him a story from when you were young, &ldquo;So, I was in middle school, and we were doing a play, it was like Peter Pan or something. And I was playing a lost boy, so I was on the stage balcony in the hideout or whatever. I said my lines, everything was going perfect, but then I leaned on the side of the balcony and the WHOLE set came crashing down. I was so embarrassed.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve threw his head back in a fit of giggles, and you furrowed your eyebrows in confusion. It&rsquo;d been a while since anyone had found you that funny. </p><p>Steve noticed your expression and frowned a little, &ldquo;Y/N? Are you alright? Is everything okay?&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded, giving him a small smile, &ldquo;Yeah, everything&rsquo;s perfect. I&rsquo;m just not used to people finding me that funny.&rdquo;</p><p>He grinned, &ldquo;Well, I think you&rsquo;re hilarious.&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p><i><b>\u2661 And we walked down the block, to my car and I almost brought him up. But you start to talk about the movies that your family watches every single Christmas \u2661</b></i></p><p><br/></p><p>You stood up from your seat at the small table, and pushed your chair under, whilst Steve did the same. You gave him a small smile, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been so lovely, Steve. Thankyou.&rdquo;</p><p>He grinned, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re more than welcome. I&rsquo;d love to do it again, if you&rsquo;re interested&hellip;.&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded, &ldquo;Of course I am.&rdquo;</p><p>He smiled, his cheeks blushing a light shade of pink, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll&hellip;uh&hellip;I&rsquo;ll walk you home. If that&rsquo;s alright with you.&rdquo;</p><p>You bit your lip to suppress your smile and took his hand, a small wave of confidence overtaking you at his offer, &ldquo;That would be more than alright with me. Come on.&rdquo; </p><p>You left a tip on the counter of the cafe, and pulled Steve outside, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little colder than usual.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve smiled at you, &ldquo;Well, you have a jacket with you. Some of us aren&rsquo;t so lucky.&rdquo;</p><p>You looked at his bare arms and nodded, &ldquo;Point taken. I got this jacket for Christmas, like two years ago. It&rsquo;s not my favourite but it works with what I&rsquo;m wearing.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve smiled, &ldquo;Christmas is my fav-&rdquo;</p><p>However, you had started speaking at the same time as him, &ldquo;My ex bought-&rdquo;. You bit your lip and looked over at Steve, &ldquo;You talk.&rdquo;</p><p>He shook his head, &ldquo;No, by all means. Go ahead.&rdquo;</p><p>You bit your lip, &ldquo;No, you should really talk. I wanna know why Christmas is your favourite time of year, because it&rsquo;s also mine.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve gave you a small smile and a nod, &ldquo;I just enjoy being able to spend time with the rest of the team. There&rsquo;s no arguments. Everything&rsquo;s just so nice. Last year we watched Elf on Christmas Eve, and I&rsquo;ve never seen Thor get so worked up.

You gave him a small smile, \u201cHi\u2026\u201d</p><p>He grinned and pulled out your chair, \u201cHey, you look\u2026amazing.\u201d</p><p>You shook your head, a grin on your features, \u201cOh, no, I wouldn\u2019t say that\u2026.\u201d</p><p>He just smiled at you softly, and you smiled back at him. It had been a while since you had smiled genuinely. Your ex never made you feel the way Steve did, appreciated.

And I was playing a lost boy, so I was on the stage balcony in the hideout or whatever. I said my lines, everything was going perfect, but then I leaned on the side of the balcony and the WHOLE set came crashing down.

Is everything okay?\u201d</p><p>You nodded, giving him a small smile, \u201cYeah, everything\u2019s perfect. I\u2019m just not used to people finding me that funny.\u201d</p><p>He grinned, \u201cWell, I think you\u2019re hilarious.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><i><b>\u2661 And we walked down the block, to my car and I almost brought him up.

It had been a while since you had been this dressed up for something, well, someone. </p><p>You were wearing your favourite colour, which was rare to you, as they always told you they hated it, and that it didn&rsquo;t suit you. Seeing yourself in that colour now felt weird, but also quite relieving.</p><p>You had been in a relationship with your ex for over two years, and even though you broke up with them months ago, everything they did still played on your mind. The way they would tell you what you could and couldn&rsquo;t wear, who you could and couldn&rsquo;t talk to. The way they acted around you made it increasingly difficult to bond with other people after the two of you had broken up, however you had found what appeared to be a bond with Steve Rogers, the guy who had saved your life a month earlier. </p><p>It was typical really, you were cornered by a strange man, and Steve just so happened to be passing by and of course he jumped in to save you.

Sitting up in bed, I rub my eyes.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cFriday, what\u2019s going on?\u201d I ask groggily.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou should probably go to Jack and James\u2019 room, Mrs. Stark.\u201d She answers.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That gets me out of bed. I throw a robe on and tie it across my big belly. I quickly make my way to the boys\u2019 room. I am greeted with Jack making Elijah float in the air. Eli is giggling, and Jack is smiling pleasantly. James is hugging his twin and Hudson is clapping his hands. Just inside the door is Pepper with her hands over her mouth.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cJackson Howard Stark! You put your brother down this instant!\u201d I say sternly. He jumps and brings his hands to his chest. Suddenly my baby Elijah is falling from the ceiling. Quick on my feet, I slow him down with my mind until I\u2019m under him and then I lightly put him in my arms. Once he\u2019s safe, I turn towards his older brother. \u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jack looks down at his feet. \u201cHe thought it was fun.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat if you dropped him and he fell? How would you feel then?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cReally bad.\u201d He sniffs. Tears start streaming down his face. I put Eli on the ground and crouch down in front of him.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou know you have to be careful with your brothers. We\u2019ve had this discussion Jack. They are smaller than you. And you also know that using your powers outside of Daddy\u2019s lab is not allowed. Elijah and Hudson don\u2019t have powers yet and can\u2019t defend themselves against you.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tony skids into the room then. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Everyone okay?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m handling it.\u201d I say, not looking away from Jack. Pepper takes Tony by the shoulder and escorts him into the hallway to tell him what happened.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDo you understand what I\u2019m saying, Jack?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes Mama, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d I dry his tears away and kiss his forehead.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhy don\u2019t you put in a movie and watch it with your brothers?\u201d I suggest.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOkay come on Eli, come on Hudsie.\u201d He takes Eli\u2019s hand and James takes Hudson\u2019s hand and they make their way out into the common room. I hear Pepper say that she\u2019ll make them popcorn.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I hug myself. In the last twenty weeks since we went to the doctor, James had shown signs of being able to control machines. When we tested it out with one of Tony\u2019s suits, he made it fly without it being on in the first place. We triple checked it wasn\u2019t Friday. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tony comes in and rubs my belly. \u201cIt\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWill it?\u201d</p><p>* * *</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I can\u2019t sleep. I look at the clock again. 1:16. Great. I roll over towards Tony. He\u2019s snoring. It isn\u2019t so bad. Just a dull snoring. It\u2019s kinda cute really. Ow. I grip my belly. Shit, Braxton hicks. Ugh. That\u2019s not good. I\u2019m only thirty weeks pregnant. I have to pee. I get up and walk towards the bathroom when my water breaks. Shit.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cTony!\u201d I shout. He\u2019s instantly sitting up.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat?\u201d He looks over at me.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMy water just broke. We need to go to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh, fucking shit.\u201d He stands up and starts pulling on clothes. I call Pepper.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHello?\u201d she answers.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cCan you come up and sleep in our bed? I need you to be with the kids. My water broke.\u201d I explain. I sound calm but I\u2019m freaking out.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She agrees, and I hang up.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tony and I make our way to the garage and into the first car we see. On the drive to the hospital, Tony\u2019s like a bat out of hell.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0At the hospital we\u2019re rushed back to the room where I\u2019m going to have my c section. Laying on the table and waiting for Dr. Moe to take the babies out feels like centuries. I just want to know if my babies are okay.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHere\u2019s baby one!\u201d she shouts suddenly. I hear a shrill crying and part of me sighs. Tony squeezes my hand. The nurses take her off the be weighed and cleaned. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s going to the NICU.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBaby two!\u201d another shout comes two minutes later. Another little cry. Thank the lord. One more to go.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then\u2026silence. A nurse gasps. What\u2019s going on? Oh my god. What\u2019s happening? There\u2019s scuffling and a shout from Dr. Moe to give her some space.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I ask franticly.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The nurse that gasps looks over the sheet at me. \u201cThe umbilical cord is wrapped around baby three\u2019s neck.\u201d No.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After a few more moments Dr. Moe yells \u201cBaby three is out.\u201d There\u2019s no cry. Tears are streaming down my face. Another nurse takes baby three away.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMy baby! Save her! Please!\u201d I shout.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Once I\u2019m all put back together again, I\u2019m rolled into my room. I\u2019m so scared. I hug myself. Tony is yelling at a nurse that wasn\u2019t even in the room when I gave birth.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ten minutes pass.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twenty minutes.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Finally, Dr. Moe comes in. We stare at each other for a moment then\u2026</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWe couldn\u2019t save the third baby. I\u2019m sorry for your loss.\u201d She whispers.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I cover my face with my hands and cry.</p>",

Sitting up in bed, I rub my eyes.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cFriday, what\u2019s going on?\u201d I ask groggily.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou should probably go to Jack and James\u2019 room, Mrs. Stark.\u201d She answers.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That gets me out of bed. I throw a robe on and tie it across my big belly. I quickly make my way to the boys\u2019 room. I am greeted with Jack making Elijah float in the air. Eli is giggling, and Jack is smiling pleasantly. James is hugging his twin and Hudson is clapping his hands. Just inside the door is Pepper with her hands over her mouth.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cJackson Howard Stark! You put your brother down this instant!\u201d I say sternly. He jumps and brings his hands to his chest. Suddenly my baby Elijah is falling from the ceiling. Quick on my feet, I slow him down with my mind until I\u2019m under him and then I lightly put him in my arms. Once he\u2019s safe, I turn towards his older brother. \u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jack looks down at his feet. \u201cHe thought it was fun.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat if you dropped him and he fell? How would you feel then?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cReally bad.\u201d He sniffs. Tears start streaming down his face. I put Eli on the ground and crouch down in front of him.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou know you have to be careful with your brothers. We\u2019ve had this discussion Jack. They are smaller than you. And you also know that using your powers outside of Daddy\u2019s lab is not allowed. Elijah and Hudson don\u2019t have powers yet and can\u2019t defend themselves against you.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tony skids into the room then. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Everyone okay?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m handling it.\u201d I say, not looking away from Jack. Pepper takes Tony by the shoulder and escorts him into the hallway to tell him what happened.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDo you understand what I\u2019m saying, Jack?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes Mama, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d I dry his tears away and kiss his forehead.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhy don\u2019t you put in a movie and watch it with your brothers?\u201d I suggest.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOkay come on Eli, come on Hudsie.\u201d He takes Eli\u2019s hand and James takes Hudson\u2019s hand and they make their way out into the common room. I hear Pepper say that she\u2019ll make them popcorn.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I hug myself. In the last twenty weeks since we went to the doctor, James had shown signs of being able to control machines. When we tested it out with one of Tony\u2019s suits, he made it fly without it being on in the first place. We triple checked it wasn\u2019t Friday. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tony comes in and rubs my belly. \u201cIt\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWill it?\u201d</p><p>* * *</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I can\u2019t sleep. I look at the clock again. 1:16. Great. I roll over towards Tony. He\u2019s snoring. It isn\u2019t so bad. Just a dull snoring. It\u2019s kinda cute really. Ow. I grip my belly. Shit, Braxton hicks. Ugh. That\u2019s not good. I\u2019m only thirty weeks pregnant. I have to pee. I get up and walk towards the bathroom when my water breaks. Shit.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cTony!\u201d I shout. He\u2019s instantly sitting up.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat?\u201d He looks over at me.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMy water just broke. We need to go to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh, fucking shit.\u201d He stands up and starts pulling on clothes. I call Pepper.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHello?\u201d she answers.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cCan you come up and sleep in our bed? I need you to be with the kids. My water broke.\u201d I explain. I sound calm but I\u2019m freaking out.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She agrees, and I hang up.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tony and I make our way to the garage and into the first car we see. On the drive to the hospital, Tony\u2019s like a bat out of hell.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0At the hospital we\u2019re rushed back to the room where I\u2019m going to have my c section. Laying on the table and waiting for Dr. Moe to take the babies out feels like centuries. I just want to know if my babies are okay.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHere\u2019s baby one!\u201d she shouts suddenly. I hear a shrill crying and part of me sighs. Tony squeezes my hand. The nurses take her off the be weighed and cleaned. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s going to the NICU.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBaby two!\u201d another shout comes two minutes later. Another little cry. Thank the lord. One more to go.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then\u2026silence. A nurse gasps. What\u2019s going on? Oh my god. What\u2019s happening? There\u2019s scuffling and a shout from Dr. Moe to give her some space.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I ask franticly.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The nurse that gasps looks over the sheet at me. \u201cThe umbilical cord is wrapped around baby three\u2019s neck.\u201d No.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After a few more moments Dr. Moe yells \u201cBaby three is out.\u201d There\u2019s no cry. Tears are streaming down my face. Another nurse takes baby three away.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMy baby! Save her! Please!\u201d I shout.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Once I\u2019m all put back together again, I\u2019m rolled into my room. I\u2019m so scared. I hug myself. Tony is yelling at a nurse that wasn\u2019t even in the room when I gave birth.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ten minutes pass.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twenty minutes.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Finally, Dr. Moe comes in. We stare at each other for a moment then\u2026</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWe couldn\u2019t save the third baby. I\u2019m sorry for your loss.\u201d She whispers.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I cover my face with my hands and cry.</p></p>",

Sitting up in bed, I rub my eyes.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Friday, what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; I ask groggily.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You should probably go to Jack and James&rsquo; room, Mrs. Stark.&rdquo; She answers.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That gets me out of bed. I throw a robe on and tie it across my big belly. I quickly make my way to the boys&rsquo; room. I am greeted with Jack making Elijah float in the air. Eli is giggling, and Jack is smiling pleasantly. James is hugging his twin and Hudson is clapping his hands. Just inside the door is Pepper with her hands over her mouth.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Jackson Howard Stark! You put your brother down this instant!&rdquo; I say sternly. He jumps and brings his hands to his chest. Suddenly my baby Elijah is falling from the ceiling. Quick on my feet, I slow him down with my mind until I&rsquo;m under him and then I lightly put him in my arms. Once he&rsquo;s safe, I turn towards his older brother. &ldquo;What were you thinking?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jack looks down at his feet. &ldquo;He thought it was fun.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;What if you dropped him and he fell? How would you feel then?&rdquo; I ask.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Really bad.&rdquo; He sniffs. Tears start streaming down his face. I put Eli on the ground and crouch down in front of him.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You know you have to be careful with your brothers. We&rsquo;ve had this discussion Jack. They are smaller than you. And you also know that using your powers outside of Daddy&rsquo;s lab is not allowed. Elijah and Hudson don&rsquo;t have powers yet and can&rsquo;t defend themselves against you.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tony skids into the room then. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on? Everyone okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m handling it.&rdquo; I say, not looking away from Jack. Pepper takes Tony by the shoulder and escorts him into the hallway to tell him what happened.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Do you understand what I&rsquo;m saying, Jack?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Yes Mama, I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; I dry his tears away and kiss his forehead.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you put in a movie and watch it with your brothers?&rdquo; I suggest.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Okay come on Eli, come on Hudsie.&rdquo; He takes Eli&rsquo;s hand and James takes Hudson&rsquo;s hand and they make their way out into the common room. I hear Pepper say that she&rsquo;ll make them popcorn.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I hug myself. In the last twenty weeks since we went to the doctor, James had shown signs of being able to control machines. When we tested it out with one of Tony&rsquo;s suits, he made it fly without it being on in the first place. We triple checked it wasn&rsquo;t Friday. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tony comes in and rubs my belly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be okay.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Will it?&rdquo;</p><p>* * *</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I can&rsquo;t sleep. I look at the clock again. 1:16. Great. I roll over towards Tony. He&rsquo;s snoring. It isn&rsquo;t so bad. Just a dull snoring. It&rsquo;s kinda cute really. Ow. I grip my belly. Shit, Braxton hicks. Ugh. That&rsquo;s not good. I&rsquo;m only thirty weeks pregnant. I have to pee. I get up and walk towards the bathroom when my water breaks. Shit.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Tony!&rdquo; I shout. He&rsquo;s instantly sitting up.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;What?&rdquo; He looks over at me.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;My water just broke. We need to go to the hospital.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, fucking shit.&rdquo; He stands up and starts pulling on clothes. I call Pepper.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo; she answers.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Can you come up and sleep in our bed? I need you to be with the kids. My water broke.&rdquo; I explain. I sound calm but I&rsquo;m freaking out.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She agrees, and I hang up.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tony and I make our way to the garage and into the first car we see. On the drive to the hospital, Tony&rsquo;s like a bat out of hell.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At the hospital we&rsquo;re rushed back to the room where I&rsquo;m going to have my c section. Laying on the table and waiting for Dr. Moe to take the babies out feels like centuries. I just want to know if my babies are okay.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s baby one!&rdquo; she shouts suddenly. I hear a shrill crying and part of me sighs. Tony squeezes my hand. The nurses take her off the be weighed and cleaned. I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;s going to the NICU.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Baby two!&rdquo; another shout comes two minutes later. Another little cry. Thank the lord. One more to go.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then&hellip;silence. A nurse gasps. What&rsquo;s going on? Oh my god. What&rsquo;s happening?

You know they always give you the good stuff the first day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need help\ngetting her to her room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I got it.\nI\u2019ll see you tomorrow afternoon for training. I\u2019m taking the morning off.\u201d</p><p>Natasha nodded\nbefore climbing off the chair and giving him a little wave. \u201cSee you tomorrow,\nBarton.\u201d</p><p>Clint looked down\nat the assassin sleeping peacefully with her head in his lap and smiled. He\nused two fingers to brush the hair off her face. \u201cWake up, little bird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t wanna,\u201d\nshe grumbled. </p><p>He nudged her\ngently in the back. \u201cCome on, Sterling. Let\u2019s get you to your bed. It\u2019s got to\nbe more comfortable than this.\u201d</p><p>She groaned but\nstarted to push herself up. He helped brace her and move her to a sitting\nposition. \u201cSorry I fell asleep on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I minded, I\nwouldn\u2019t have offered.\u201d He stood and stretched before holding out a hand to\nher. She took it and he helped her to her feet, frowning when she wove\nunsteadily. \u201cAll right, that\u2019s not going to work,\u201d he said before scooping her\nup to carry her bridal style. He made sure her bad shoulder wasn\u2019t the one\nresting against him.</p><p>He had been\nprepared for her to argue or pitch a fit but she surprised him by leaning her\nhead against his chest. \u201cThanks, archer,\u201d she said with a yawn.</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\nlittle bird. Let\u2019s get you to bed.\u201d He carried her down the hall to the\nelevator and pressed the button for her floor. When they reached her door, he stood\nher on her feet so she could open the door, but kept a hand wrapped around her\nwaist to keep her steady.</p><p>He helped her\ninside and she immediately climbed up on the bed and laid down. He chuckled a\nlittle and moved over to at least take off her shoes. \u201cDo you want me to get\nNat to help you change?\u201d</p><p>She shook her\nhead. \u201cToo tired.\u201d She rolled onto her uninjured side and brought her knees up\ncloser to her chest. </p><p>\u201cGood night,\nRaven,\u201d Clint said softly after watching her for a moment. He started to back\nout of the room but her soft voice stopped him. </p><p>\u201cClint,\u201d she said\nand turned slightly so she could see him. </p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you stay,\njust for a little bit?\u201d</p><p>He studied her\nfor a moment, surprised she would ask.</p><p>She must have\nmistook his hesitation for reluctance because she launched into an explanation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just that I\u2019m not used to sleeping with my back to the room and the meds\nhave my brain foggy and\u2014\u201d</p><p>He cut her off by\nstepping fully into the room and shutting the door. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to explain,\nlittle bird. I\u2019m just surprised you asked is all. Scoot over a bit.\u201d</p><p>She moved closer\nto the wall to make room for him and he slid in behind her after taking off his\nshoes. He laid a hand on her waist, taking care to not injure her further. A\nsigh escaped her as she snuggled deeper into the bed. </p><p>\u201cGo to sleep,\nRaven.

They\nweren&rsquo;t even a half hour into the movie before her eyelids started drifting\nshut.</p><hr /><p>Clint had been\nkeeping one eye on Raven, knowing she&rsquo;d had a long day and was undoubtedly\ndoped up on painkillers. It didn&rsquo;t take long for her eyes to start drifting\nshut for longer and longer periods of time. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; he said\nsoftly and she turned to look at him. &ldquo;You want me to escort you back to your\nroom?&rdquo;</p><p>She shook her\nhead. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really want to be alone right now.&rdquo; She said it so low, he\nwouldn&rsquo;t have caught it if he hadn&rsquo;t been listening for her response.</p><p>He smiled at her.\n&ldquo;Then lay down. I&rsquo;ll get you back to your room later.&rdquo;</p><p>She nodded and\nwent to lay with her head on the other end of the couch. He saw the moment she\nrealized she would have to lay on her bad shoulder to lay that way. She sat\nback up.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been told\nI&rsquo;m pretty comfortable to cuddle with,&rdquo; he said. He smiled again when her\ncheeks flushed pink. &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he added and patted his lap. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be on my\nbest behavior. Promise.&rdquo;</p><p>Finally, she\nnodded and leaned in his direction. She laid her head on his lap, her hand\nunder her cheek. She sighed and smiled a little as she settled and got\ncomfortable. His eyes continued to move between her and the screen. After a\ncouple of minutes he started to run his fingers through her hair. When she\ndidn&rsquo;t complain, he continued. She was asleep by the time Marvin got the pig.\nAnd he&rsquo;d joined her, his head leaning against the back of the couch, before the\nfilm ended. </p><hr /><p>&ldquo;Guess you didn&rsquo;t\ndo it on purpose,&rdquo; a familiar voice next to his ear had him jerking awake. </p><p>&ldquo;What was your\nfirst clue?&rdquo; he said as he looked over at Nat. Her admitting she was wrong was\nas close as he was going to get to an apology. He ran a hand down his face and\nblinked his eyes trying to wake up. &ldquo;What time is it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Eleven.&rdquo; She\nclimbed into a nearby chair and perched herself on the back of it. &ldquo;How is she\ndoing?&rdquo;</p><p>Clint shrugged.\n&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t make it long before she crashed out.
