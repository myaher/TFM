Two minutes is a long time in a battle, especially one against a\ncompletely unknown antagonist.</p><p>The\nattack had come at dawn, and had been devastating within a very short period of\ntime. People had just started to drop in the street - night shifters on their\nway home, early commuters, the deli workers heading out to prep for the\nbreakfast rush. The first few casualties had not raised the alarm at the\nhospitals - unconscious but otherwise stable people who just weren\u2019t waking up.\nCould be the leftovers from a wild night out. </p><p>But\nby seven in the morning, the numbers were moving into the hundreds, and the\nemergency services started to raise their voices in concern, and within the\ndepths of the hugely complex and intelligent machine known as JARVIS a series\nof little red flags were raised. </p><p>And\nIron Man was on the street before the clock hit seven-fifteen. </p><p><i>\u201cI\nwas watching,\u201d </i>Clint\u2019s\nvoice says. <i>\u201cI don\u2019t know what went wrong. It looked like he had it on the\nropes, he was advancing, it was backing up, then he just - stopped. Looked like\nhe was in pain, hands to his head. Then he went down.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cHe\nnever took the helmet off?\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cNever.\nAll suit, all the way.\u201d</i></p><p>Not\na good sign. Steve is reminded, as he often is, that Clint is highly trained\nand lethal, but he\u2018s still only regular human. Not enhanced, not magical, not\nheavily armoured. \u201cStay out of range, Hawkeye. That\u2019s an order.\u201d</p><p>Clint\nis hesitant. And says so. Clint is not someone to keep a perfectly good opinion\nto himself. </p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019ve\ngot no backup.\u201d</i></p><p>Which\nis partly why Steve had wanted to sigh, because that was true. Banner was away\nat some kind of science junket in Europe, Natasha had gone dark somewhere in\nSyria the past two weeks, and Thor and Loki were doing politics in Asgard,\nwhich left him, Clint, Tony and - </p><p>\u201cGet\nHeckyl out here. Now. Tell him no time to suit up, just get here.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>He\ncan almost hear Clint clenching his teeth. Clint and Heckyl are not friends. If\nSteve\u2019s being honest, Heckyl\u2019s probably not his favourite person either, but he\u2019s\na hard hitter and you can generally trust him enough to fight on your side. And\nbesides, they\u2019re out of options and people are in danger. Steve weaves between\ntraffic, horns blaring at him as he goes, and vaults a parked cab. </p><p>\u201cETA\nthirty seconds. Call him <i>now</i>.\u201d</p><p>And\nthen he\u2019s in range, and he can see it, and there is no more time. </p><p>The\nmonster is huge, at least fifteen feet tall: or at least as close as can be\nreckoned, because its form is not set and solid. It roils and bubbles like\ncloud or ink, ugly amorphous shapes shifting in and out of solidity along its\nbreadth. Sometimes it appears to have arms, which reach and grab, and at others\ndark maws seem to open up, champing and snapping towards anything that moves. </p><p>It\nis easy to see how in the half-light before dawn this creature could have\nstayed hidden, taken victims without warning. </p><p>Wrapped\nin the coils of smoky body at the base lies the flash of red and yellow that is\nTony, and Steve\u2019s focus contracts onto the one sprawled visible length of\narmoured leg. </p><p>How\ndo you fight smoke? </p><p>He\ncircles for a moment. The creature has no visible eyes, but nonetheless Steve\nfeels unaccountably observed, and indeed observed in a forensic fashion. He\nfeels stripped back, as if the thing in front of him can see inside his veins <i>(Bucky)\n</i>and is gnawing on his thoughts <i>(Peggy) </i>and -</p><p>The\nguilt washes through him like bile, in a rush, all at once, and Steve buckles\nas if he\u2019s taken a tank direct to the gut. It\u2019s like poison - </p><p><i>(Tony)</i></p><p>-\nthe most virulent kind of poison, and the creature is dragging it out of him\nthrough every vein, every pore -</p><p><i>(couldn\u2019t\nsave him/her/them)</i></p><p><i>(not\nany of them)</i></p><p><i>(frozen)</i></p><p><i>(dead)</i></p><p><i>(all\ndead)</i></p><p><i>(all\nyour fault)</i></p><p>It\u2019s\nlike an evil, backward form of dialysis: the creature siphons the guilt through\nSteve, takes it in, circulates it gluttonously to power its own form, then\npours the dregs back into Steve complete with all the alien awfulness that its\nrotting self can give. </p><p>Human\nbeings are very good at guilt. It\u2019s a distinguishing feature of their species.\nAnd you cannot punch guilt. You cannot take it by the throat and shake it. It\nis so much harder to fight when the enemy is inside you, in your past, in the\nfaces of everyone you ever lost or loved. By the time Steve has the ability to\nmuster a thought (and that thought is \u201cUnder attack\u201d) he is already on his\nknees, his body unable to cope with the sickening alien bio-feedback, his mind a\ntormented whirl of distilled and corrupted emotion. He feels the hard, chill\nsmack of the sidewalk against the side of his face before he is even aware he\nis falling. He rolls, inelegantly, his face up so all he can see is the sky,\nand the coiling smoky tendrils of the beast, ever-expanding, glutted on his\nguilt. It is full: he has never felt so empty in his life, and everything\nhurts, from his heart to his stomach. Consciousness fades in and out and it is\nlikely only the serum that keeps him from drifting permanently into the\nblack. \u00a0</p><p>It\nstarts to rain. And someone leaps over Steve\u2019s sprawled body, boot-heels\nslamming hard on the street, and gets in between him and the beast. </p><p>It\u2019s\nHeckyl, of course, because even though he\u2019s definitely got his problems he does\nfight on the right side these days. Clint has called him as promised, and here\nhe is. Steve blinks away raindrops, his blurring vision taking in the flap of\nHeckyl\u2019s coat-tails in the breeze, noting with hazy gratitude the arched,\naggressive stance the man is taking in front of him. Heckyl\u2019s body language\nlooks mad as all hell, and possibly this is only because he\u2019s been dragged away\nfrom whatever fun thing he\u2019d been up to so he can pull their backsides out of\nthe fire, but Steve is grateful for it nonetheless. An angry Heckyl is a good\nthing to have at your back in a pinch. </p><p>But\nif whatever that thing is can fell both Steve and Tony like cut flowers, then\nthere\u2019s a real danger Heckyl\u2019s about to get the same treatment if he gets too\nclose, and then they\u2019ll be in no better place than before. He can hear Clint on\nthe radio, and Heckyl\u2019s terse responses. They\u2019re ready to fight. </p><p>He\ntries to speak. He needs to warn his team-mates. They have to know what this\nthing can do. He tries, he really does - but his lips feel frost-bitten, old,\nuseless, his tongue a heavy strip of leather in his mouth. </p><p>\u201c\n-!\u201d he manages, and that useless sound makes Heckyl glance down at him,\nfrowning, but nothing more. Failed. Once again. Failed - </p><p><i>(Heckyl)</i></p><p><i>(can\u2019t\nsave him)</i></p><p>Steve\ndrifts towards unconsciousness, fighting all the way. </p><p>It\n<i>almost </i>claims him. </p><p>The\nrain on his face is cold. He opens his eyes again, and to his huge surprise\nHeckyl is still on his feet. And not only that, he\u2019s advancing. He looks like a\nmime doing the whole walking-against-the-wind thing, as if he\u2019s pushing against\nsome terrible pressure, but he\u2018s taking the fight to the thing and (even more\nunbelievably) it\u2018s backing away. Steve is vaguely aware of Clint screaming\nabuse down the comm, but mercifully it\u2019s abuse of the \u201c<i>Get the fuck out of\nthere you colossal idiot, you\u2019re gonna die -!\u201d </i>variety. Friendly,\nteam-spirited abuse. Oh good. </p><p>The\nvast, smoky bulk of the creature is definitely growing. Swelling, billowing, as\nif it will envelop the world. Heckyl\u2019s lips pull back in a snarl, his teeth\nclenched viciously, but he keeps moving. As Steve watches, blinking as much as\nhe can will his leaden eyelids to, Heckyl drags his fists up to almost\nboxing-style pose - he looks as if even that small change in position is like\nwading through treacle - and starts to call on his power. </p><p>The\nbeast before him balloons. Bulges appear, amorphous limbs trying to resolve and\nstrike out at the man in front it, but becoming instead shapeless swollen lumps\nwhich bubble uncomfortably before sagging back into the mass. It strains. Steve\nhas the impression that if it could, it would be howling. But instead there\u2019s\njust an eerie silence, as the thing continues to inflate and grow to unbearably\nstretched proportions. Heckyl, his face set and pale, two trails of blood now\nrunning from the corners of his eyes, takes one final step until he\u2019s almost\npressed into the distended form of the creature. </p><p>And\nit explodes. </p><p>There\u2019s\nalmost no sound, only something like an inhalation of air rushing into a vacuum\nleft by the creature\u2019s abrupt departure, but fragments of oily black ash start\nto float down through the air, falling into Steve\u2019s face. It smells abominable,\nstale and anciently corrupt, like the inside of a sarcophagus. \u00a0</p><p>A\nscrape of boots. Heckyl is crouching down next to him, swiping an arm across\nhis face to wipe away the tracks of blood, and looking extremely weary. But he\u2019s\nalive. Alive and awake. </p><p>\u201cCan\nyou walk?\u201d Heckyl is asking him, his tone bitter and irritable. \u201cBecause I\u2019m <i>not\n</i>carrying you.\u201d</p><p>For\n<i>I\u2019m not </i>Steve correctly reads <i>I can\u2019t, </i>the sarcastic manner\naside. Heckyl looks dead on his feet. It\u2019s amazing he\u2019s able to carry his own\nweight, let alone someone like Steve who outweighs him by almost half. </p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d\nSteve replies, somewhat astonished by the fact that he isn\u2019t lying. As soon as\nthe creature exploded, he\u2019d started feeling better. Like he\u2019s had the world\u2019s\nworst dose of the flu, but better. He starts trying to sit up, and between him\nand Heckyl\u2019s supporting arm, they manage it. They sit there for a while, as the\nrain and ash continue to fall and the air starts to clear of the stink. </p><p><i>\u201cCap,\nHeckyl.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re\nhere,\u201d Steve says, and even hears (to his great relief) an affirmative grunt\nfrom Tony, who is evidently annoyed at being counted out of the game despite\nhaving spent most of the action lying comatose on the street. </p><p><i>\u201cJe-sus.\u201d\n</i>Clint\u2019s\nvoice is half-admiring. <i>\u201cWhat was that thing.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nmore interested,\u201d Steve says, locking eyes with Heckyl, \u201cas to how you knew how\nto kill it.\u201d</p><p>Heckyl\njust shrugs - a testament to how tired he must be, usually he\u2019s far more\nelaborate - and looks away. </p><p>\u201cWhat\nan assumption,\u201d he says. \u201c<i>I</i> didn\u2019t kill it. One might say it killed\nitself. Obviously none too bright. About as sentient as the average\ncaterpillar, I\u2018d say. A brainless eating machine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd\nit ate itself to death,\u201d Steve says, the horrible truth of it all dawning on\nhim. \u201cIt found an almost limitless supply of food and it just couldn\u2019t stop\nitself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoom,\u201d\nagrees Heckyl, soberly miming an explosion with both hands spread. He is\nsteadfastly ignoring the way Steve is looking at him. </p><p>Tony\u2019s\nforty-odd years and countless acts of regret had barely served as a snack. His\nown near-century of horror and loss had only satiated the creature for a\nmoment. But Heckyl -</p><p>-\nHeckyl was millions of years old. </p><p>And\nhad, as Loki had once put it, darkly, <i>done things</i>. On a planetary\ngenocidal scale of awfulness, for countless centuries. </p><p>No\nwonder the creature had exploded. And Steve, because he is a good man and\nvalues his own sanity, makes a careful and conscious decision to put this from\nhis mind. Besides, it\u2019s almost palpable how uncomfortable Heckyl is about this\nwhole thing, and the man\u2019s been through enough. </p><p>\u201cCome\non,\u201d he says, as the rain begins to falter and the sun attempt to filter\nthrough the grey clouds. \u201cLet\u2019s try that walk now.\u201d</p>",

Two minutes is a long time in a battle, especially one against a\ncompletely unknown antagonist.</p><p>The\nattack had come at dawn, and had been devastating within a very short period of\ntime. People had just started to drop in the street - night shifters on their\nway home, early commuters, the deli workers heading out to prep for the\nbreakfast rush. The first few casualties had not raised the alarm at the\nhospitals - unconscious but otherwise stable people who just weren\u2019t waking up.\nCould be the leftovers from a wild night out. </p><p>But\nby seven in the morning, the numbers were moving into the hundreds, and the\nemergency services started to raise their voices in concern, and within the\ndepths of the hugely complex and intelligent machine known as JARVIS a series\nof little red flags were raised. </p><p>And\nIron Man was on the street before the clock hit seven-fifteen. </p><p><i>\u201cI\nwas watching,\u201d </i>Clint\u2019s\nvoice says. <i>\u201cI don\u2019t know what went wrong. It looked like he had it on the\nropes, he was advancing, it was backing up, then he just - stopped. Looked like\nhe was in pain, hands to his head. Then he went down.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cHe\nnever took the helmet off?\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cNever.\nAll suit, all the way.\u201d</i></p><p>Not\na good sign. Steve is reminded, as he often is, that Clint is highly trained\nand lethal, but he\u2018s still only regular human. Not enhanced, not magical, not\nheavily armoured. \u201cStay out of range, Hawkeye. That\u2019s an order.\u201d</p><p>Clint\nis hesitant. And says so. Clint is not someone to keep a perfectly good opinion\nto himself. </p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019ve\ngot no backup.\u201d</i></p><p>Which\nis partly why Steve had wanted to sigh, because that was true. Banner was away\nat some kind of science junket in Europe, Natasha had gone dark somewhere in\nSyria the past two weeks, and Thor and Loki were doing politics in Asgard,\nwhich left him, Clint, Tony and - </p><p>\u201cGet\nHeckyl out here. Now. Tell him no time to suit up, just get here.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>He\ncan almost hear Clint clenching his teeth. Clint and Heckyl are not friends. If\nSteve\u2019s being honest, Heckyl\u2019s probably not his favourite person either, but he\u2019s\na hard hitter and you can generally trust him enough to fight on your side. And\nbesides, they\u2019re out of options and people are in danger. Steve weaves between\ntraffic, horns blaring at him as he goes, and vaults a parked cab. </p><p>\u201cETA\nthirty seconds. Call him <i>now</i>.\u201d</p><p>And\nthen he\u2019s in range, and he can see it, and there is no more time. </p><p>The\nmonster is huge, at least fifteen feet tall: or at least as close as can be\nreckoned, because its form is not set and solid. It roils and bubbles like\ncloud or ink, ugly amorphous shapes shifting in and out of solidity along its\nbreadth. Sometimes it appears to have arms, which reach and grab, and at others\ndark maws seem to open up, champing and snapping towards anything that moves. </p><p>It\nis easy to see how in the half-light before dawn this creature could have\nstayed hidden, taken victims without warning. </p><p>Wrapped\nin the coils of smoky body at the base lies the flash of red and yellow that is\nTony, and Steve\u2019s focus contracts onto the one sprawled visible length of\narmoured leg. </p><p>How\ndo you fight smoke? </p><p>He\ncircles for a moment. The creature has no visible eyes, but nonetheless Steve\nfeels unaccountably observed, and indeed observed in a forensic fashion. He\nfeels stripped back, as if the thing in front of him can see inside his veins <i>(Bucky)\n</i>and is gnawing on his thoughts <i>(Peggy) </i>and -</p><p>The\nguilt washes through him like bile, in a rush, all at once, and Steve buckles\nas if he\u2019s taken a tank direct to the gut. It\u2019s like poison - </p><p><i>(Tony)</i></p><p>-\nthe most virulent kind of poison, and the creature is dragging it out of him\nthrough every vein, every pore -</p><p><i>(couldn\u2019t\nsave him/her/them)</i></p><p><i>(not\nany of them)</i></p><p><i>(frozen)</i></p><p><i>(dead)</i></p><p><i>(all\ndead)</i></p><p><i>(all\nyour fault)</i></p><p>It\u2019s\nlike an evil, backward form of dialysis: the creature siphons the guilt through\nSteve, takes it in, circulates it gluttonously to power its own form, then\npours the dregs back into Steve complete with all the alien awfulness that its\nrotting self can give. </p><p>Human\nbeings are very good at guilt. It\u2019s a distinguishing feature of their species.\nAnd you cannot punch guilt. You cannot take it by the throat and shake it. It\nis so much harder to fight when the enemy is inside you, in your past, in the\nfaces of everyone you ever lost or loved. By the time Steve has the ability to\nmuster a thought (and that thought is \u201cUnder attack\u201d) he is already on his\nknees, his body unable to cope with the sickening alien bio-feedback, his mind a\ntormented whirl of distilled and corrupted emotion. He feels the hard, chill\nsmack of the sidewalk against the side of his face before he is even aware he\nis falling. He rolls, inelegantly, his face up so all he can see is the sky,\nand the coiling smoky tendrils of the beast, ever-expanding, glutted on his\nguilt. It is full: he has never felt so empty in his life, and everything\nhurts, from his heart to his stomach. Consciousness fades in and out and it is\nlikely only the serum that keeps him from drifting permanently into the\nblack. \u00a0</p><p>It\nstarts to rain. And someone leaps over Steve\u2019s sprawled body, boot-heels\nslamming hard on the street, and gets in between him and the beast. </p><p>It\u2019s\nHeckyl, of course, because even though he\u2019s definitely got his problems he does\nfight on the right side these days. Clint has called him as promised, and here\nhe is. Steve blinks away raindrops, his blurring vision taking in the flap of\nHeckyl\u2019s coat-tails in the breeze, noting with hazy gratitude the arched,\naggressive stance the man is taking in front of him. Heckyl\u2019s body language\nlooks mad as all hell, and possibly this is only because he\u2019s been dragged away\nfrom whatever fun thing he\u2019d been up to so he can pull their backsides out of\nthe fire, but Steve is grateful for it nonetheless. An angry Heckyl is a good\nthing to have at your back in a pinch. </p><p>But\nif whatever that thing is can fell both Steve and Tony like cut flowers, then\nthere\u2019s a real danger Heckyl\u2019s about to get the same treatment if he gets too\nclose, and then they\u2019ll be in no better place than before. He can hear Clint on\nthe radio, and Heckyl\u2019s terse responses. They\u2019re ready to fight. </p><p>He\ntries to speak. He needs to warn his team-mates. They have to know what this\nthing can do. He tries, he really does - but his lips feel frost-bitten, old,\nuseless, his tongue a heavy strip of leather in his mouth. </p><p>\u201c\n-!\u201d he manages, and that useless sound makes Heckyl glance down at him,\nfrowning, but nothing more. Failed. Once again. Failed - </p><p><i>(Heckyl)</i></p><p><i>(can\u2019t\nsave him)</i></p><p>Steve\ndrifts towards unconsciousness, fighting all the way. </p><p>It\n<i>almost </i>claims him. </p><p>The\nrain on his face is cold. He opens his eyes again, and to his huge surprise\nHeckyl is still on his feet. And not only that, he\u2019s advancing. He looks like a\nmime doing the whole walking-against-the-wind thing, as if he\u2019s pushing against\nsome terrible pressure, but he\u2018s taking the fight to the thing and (even more\nunbelievably) it\u2018s backing away. Steve is vaguely aware of Clint screaming\nabuse down the comm, but mercifully it\u2019s abuse of the \u201c<i>Get the fuck out of\nthere you colossal idiot, you\u2019re gonna die -!\u201d </i>variety. Friendly,\nteam-spirited abuse. Oh good. </p><p>The\nvast, smoky bulk of the creature is definitely growing. Swelling, billowing, as\nif it will envelop the world. Heckyl\u2019s lips pull back in a snarl, his teeth\nclenched viciously, but he keeps moving. As Steve watches, blinking as much as\nhe can will his leaden eyelids to, Heckyl drags his fists up to almost\nboxing-style pose - he looks as if even that small change in position is like\nwading through treacle - and starts to call on his power. </p><p>The\nbeast before him balloons. Bulges appear, amorphous limbs trying to resolve and\nstrike out at the man in front it, but becoming instead shapeless swollen lumps\nwhich bubble uncomfortably before sagging back into the mass. It strains. Steve\nhas the impression that if it could, it would be howling. But instead there\u2019s\njust an eerie silence, as the thing continues to inflate and grow to unbearably\nstretched proportions. Heckyl, his face set and pale, two trails of blood now\nrunning from the corners of his eyes, takes one final step until he\u2019s almost\npressed into the distended form of the creature. </p><p>And\nit explodes. </p><p>There\u2019s\nalmost no sound, only something like an inhalation of air rushing into a vacuum\nleft by the creature\u2019s abrupt departure, but fragments of oily black ash start\nto float down through the air, falling into Steve\u2019s face. It smells abominable,\nstale and anciently corrupt, like the inside of a sarcophagus. \u00a0</p><p>A\nscrape of boots. Heckyl is crouching down next to him, swiping an arm across\nhis face to wipe away the tracks of blood, and looking extremely weary. But he\u2019s\nalive. Alive and awake. </p><p>\u201cCan\nyou walk?\u201d Heckyl is asking him, his tone bitter and irritable. \u201cBecause I\u2019m <i>not\n</i>carrying you.\u201d</p><p>For\n<i>I\u2019m not </i>Steve correctly reads <i>I can\u2019t, </i>the sarcastic manner\naside. Heckyl looks dead on his feet. It\u2019s amazing he\u2019s able to carry his own\nweight, let alone someone like Steve who outweighs him by almost half. </p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d\nSteve replies, somewhat astonished by the fact that he isn\u2019t lying. As soon as\nthe creature exploded, he\u2019d started feeling better. Like he\u2019s had the world\u2019s\nworst dose of the flu, but better. He starts trying to sit up, and between him\nand Heckyl\u2019s supporting arm, they manage it. They sit there for a while, as the\nrain and ash continue to fall and the air starts to clear of the stink. </p><p><i>\u201cCap,\nHeckyl.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re\nhere,\u201d Steve says, and even hears (to his great relief) an affirmative grunt\nfrom Tony, who is evidently annoyed at being counted out of the game despite\nhaving spent most of the action lying comatose on the street. </p><p><i>\u201cJe-sus.\u201d\n</i>Clint\u2019s\nvoice is half-admiring. <i>\u201cWhat was that thing.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nmore interested,\u201d Steve says, locking eyes with Heckyl, \u201cas to how you knew how\nto kill it.\u201d</p><p>Heckyl\njust shrugs - a testament to how tired he must be, usually he\u2019s far more\nelaborate - and looks away. </p><p>\u201cWhat\nan assumption,\u201d he says. \u201c<i>I</i> didn\u2019t kill it. One might say it killed\nitself. Obviously none too bright. About as sentient as the average\ncaterpillar, I\u2018d say. A brainless eating machine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd\nit ate itself to death,\u201d Steve says, the horrible truth of it all dawning on\nhim. \u201cIt found an almost limitless supply of food and it just couldn\u2019t stop\nitself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoom,\u201d\nagrees Heckyl, soberly miming an explosion with both hands spread. He is\nsteadfastly ignoring the way Steve is looking at him. </p><p>Tony\u2019s\nforty-odd years and countless acts of regret had barely served as a snack. His\nown near-century of horror and loss had only satiated the creature for a\nmoment. But Heckyl -</p><p>-\nHeckyl was millions of years old. </p><p>And\nhad, as Loki had once put it, darkly, <i>done things</i>. On a planetary\ngenocidal scale of awfulness, for countless centuries. </p><p>No\nwonder the creature had exploded. And Steve, because he is a good man and\nvalues his own sanity, makes a careful and conscious decision to put this from\nhis mind. Besides, it\u2019s almost palpable how uncomfortable Heckyl is about this\nwhole thing, and the man\u2019s been through enough. </p><p>\u201cCome\non,\u201d he says, as the rain begins to falter and the sun attempt to filter\nthrough the grey clouds. \u201cLet\u2019s try that walk now.\u201d</p>",

As soon as\nthe creature exploded, he\u2019d started feeling better. Like he\u2019s had the world\u2019s\nworst dose of the flu, but better.

Two minutes is a long time in a battle, especially one against a\ncompletely unknown antagonist.</p><p>The\nattack had come at dawn, and had been devastating within a very short period of\ntime. People had just started to drop in the street - night shifters on their\nway home, early commuters, the deli workers heading out to prep for the\nbreakfast rush.

It looked like he had it on the\nropes, he was advancing, it was backing up, then he just - stopped. Looked like\nhe was in pain, hands to his head. Then he went down.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;He\nnever took the helmet off?&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Never.\nAll suit, all the way.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Not\na good sign. Steve is reminded, as he often is, that Clint is highly trained\nand lethal, but he&lsquo;s still only regular human. Not enhanced, not magical, not\nheavily armoured. &ldquo;Stay out of range, Hawkeye. That&rsquo;s an order.&rdquo;</p><p>Clint\nis hesitant. And says so. Clint is not someone to keep a perfectly good opinion\nto himself. </p><p><i>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve\ngot no backup.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Which\nis partly why Steve had wanted to sigh, because that was true. Banner was away\nat some kind of science junket in Europe, Natasha had gone dark somewhere in\nSyria the past two weeks, and Thor and Loki were doing politics in Asgard,\nwhich left him, Clint, Tony and - </p><p>&ldquo;Get\nHeckyl out here. Now. Tell him no time to suit up, just get here.&rdquo;</p><p>He\ncan almost hear Clint clenching his teeth. Clint and Heckyl are not friends. If\nSteve&rsquo;s being honest, Heckyl&rsquo;s probably not his favourite person either, but he&rsquo;s\na hard hitter and you can generally trust him enough to fight on your side. And\nbesides, they&rsquo;re out of options and people are in danger. Steve weaves between\ntraffic, horns blaring at him as he goes, and vaults a parked cab. </p><p>&ldquo;ETA\nthirty seconds. Call him <i>now</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>And\nthen he&rsquo;s in range, and he can see it, and there is no more time. </p><p>The\nmonster is huge, at least fifteen feet tall: or at least as close as can be\nreckoned, because its form is not set and solid. It roils and bubbles like\ncloud or ink, ugly amorphous shapes shifting in and out of solidity along its\nbreadth. Sometimes it appears to have arms, which reach and grab, and at others\ndark maws seem to open up, champing and snapping towards anything that moves. </p><p>It\nis easy to see how in the half-light before dawn this creature could have\nstayed hidden, taken victims without warning. </p><p>Wrapped\nin the coils of smoky body at the base lies the flash of red and yellow that is\nTony, and Steve&rsquo;s focus contracts onto the one sprawled visible length of\narmoured leg. </p><p>How\ndo you fight smoke? </p><p>He\ncircles for a moment. The creature has no visible eyes, but nonetheless Steve\nfeels unaccountably observed, and indeed observed in a forensic fashion. He\nfeels stripped back, as if the thing in front of him can see inside his veins <i>(Bucky)\n</i>and is gnawing on his thoughts <i>(Peggy) </i>and -</p><p>The\nguilt washes through him like bile, in a rush, all at once, and Steve buckles\nas if he&rsquo;s taken a tank direct to the gut. It&rsquo;s like poison - </p><p><i>(Tony)</i></p><p>-\nthe most virulent kind of poison, and the creature is dragging it out of him\nthrough every vein, every pore -</p><p><i>(couldn&rsquo;t\nsave him/her/them)</i></p><p><i>(not\nany of them)</i></p><p><i>(frozen)</i></p><p><i>(dead)</i></p><p><i>(all\ndead)</i></p><p><i>(all\nyour fault)</i></p><p>It&rsquo;s\nlike an evil, backward form of dialysis: the creature siphons the guilt through\nSteve, takes it in, circulates it gluttonously to power its own form, then\npours the dregs back into Steve complete with all the alien awfulness that its\nrotting self can give. </p><p>Human\nbeings are very good at guilt. It&rsquo;s a distinguishing feature of their species.\nAnd you cannot punch guilt. You cannot take it by the throat and shake it. It\nis so much harder to fight when the enemy is inside you, in your past, in the\nfaces of everyone you ever lost or loved. By the time Steve has the ability to\nmuster a thought (and that thought is &ldquo;Under attack&rdquo;) he is already on his\nknees, his body unable to cope with the sickening alien bio-feedback, his mind a\ntormented whirl of distilled and corrupted emotion. He feels the hard, chill\nsmack of the sidewalk against the side of his face before he is even aware he\nis falling. He rolls, inelegantly, his face up so all he can see is the sky,\nand the coiling smoky tendrils of the beast, ever-expanding, glutted on his\nguilt. It is full: he has never felt so empty in his life, and everything\nhurts, from his heart to his stomach. Consciousness fades in and out and it is\nlikely only the serum that keeps him from drifting permanently into the\nblack. &nbsp;</p><p>It\nstarts to rain. And someone leaps over Steve&rsquo;s sprawled body, boot-heels\nslamming hard on the street, and gets in between him and the beast. </p><p>It&rsquo;s\nHeckyl, of course, because even though he&rsquo;s definitely got his problems he does\nfight on the right side these days. Clint has called him as promised, and here\nhe is. Steve blinks away raindrops, his blurring vision taking in the flap of\nHeckyl&rsquo;s coat-tails in the breeze, noting with hazy gratitude the arched,\naggressive stance the man is taking in front of him. Heckyl&rsquo;s body language\nlooks mad as all hell, and possibly this is only because he&rsquo;s been dragged away\nfrom whatever fun thing he&rsquo;d been up to so he can pull their backsides out of\nthe fire, but Steve is grateful for it nonetheless. An angry Heckyl is a good\nthing to have at your back in a pinch. </p><p>But\nif whatever that thing is can fell both Steve and Tony like cut flowers, then\nthere&rsquo;s a real danger Heckyl&rsquo;s about to get the same treatment if he gets too\nclose, and then they&rsquo;ll be in no better place than before. He can hear Clint on\nthe radio, and Heckyl&rsquo;s terse responses. They&rsquo;re ready to fight. </p><p>He\ntries to speak. He needs to warn his team-mates. They have to know what this\nthing can do. He tries, he really does - but his lips feel frost-bitten, old,\nuseless, his tongue a heavy strip of leather in his mouth. </p><p>&ldquo;\n-!&rdquo; he manages, and that useless sound makes Heckyl glance down at him,\nfrowning, but nothing more. Failed. Once again.
