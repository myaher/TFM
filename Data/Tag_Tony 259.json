You smiled, \u201cMe too, I\u2019m surprised\nthat Captain America can move his hips\u201d you teased while remembering how he had\ndanced his heart out on the dancefloor at the club.</p><p>Steve\u2019s checks reddened at your comment as you\nhad been the only one who had seen him let loose and he didn\u2019t regret it at\nall. He huffed amused, \u201cIf Tony would have been there, he\u2019d tease me for the rest\nof my life\u201d he added and placed his hand on your thigh. At the mention of Tony\u2019s\nname, your heart dropped to the pit of your stomach as you remembered what you\nwere doing.</p><p>You couldn\u2019t decide on what man to choose and\ndecided to date both, the feeling of having two handsome superheroes wanting\nyou, dedicating all their time and attention of you made your heart swell with\npride as you felt so powerful.</p><p>But the thing was that Tony had something that\nmade you feel extraordinary, that man was able to make you feel so many and intense\nemotions and you found yourself yearning for his presence every day. With Steve,\nyou didn\u2019t feel the same way, spending time with him while knowing that you\nprobably wouldn\u2019t end up with him was just to feed your ego, nothing more.</p><p>\u201c[Y/N]?\u201d the super soldier gently spoke and\nwaved his hand in front of your face as you had completely tuned out, \u201cSorry\u201d\nyou cleared your throat and smiled, \u201cWhat were you saying?\u201d you asked, silently\nhoping that he hadn\u2019t noticed that Tony\u2019s name was the reason for your little\ntime out.</p><p>Steve chuckled, \u201cI was asking if you\u2019d like to\nmeet up again, tomorrow? I thought about bringing the chocolate fondue fountain\nand same fresh fruits?\u201d his voice lowered to a husky whispered while slowly\nleaning in. The image of Steve feeding pieced of fruit covered in chocolate was\na delicate thought but your mind replaced him with Tony.</p><p>\u201cI-uh..\u201d you stuttered and leaned back, not\nwanting to kiss Steve as it felt like you were betraying Tony. \u201cI have a busy\nday ahead and would be too exhausted to enjoy the chocolate fountain\u201d you lied\nand let out a silent sigh of relief when the super soldier nodded his head in\nagreement and leaned back, but kept his hand on your thigh. His touch slowly\nbegan to make you feel uncomfortable as your mind body and soul began to yearn\nfor Tony again.</p><p>You cleared your throat again and decided to\ncall it a night as you wanted to be alone with your thoughts, \u201cIt\u2019s very late,\nyou should go and I\u2019ll give you a call, okay?\u201d you suggested to which Steve\nnodded his head and looked down at his watch, seeing that it was indeed late. \u201cYeah,\nI have an early training session in a few hours, don\u2019t want to be all cranky\u201d\nhe chuckled, you added a fake one before standing up and adjusting your short\ndress.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><b><i>But I gotta\nbe strong<br/>\nYou did me wrong<br/>\nWhen I thought that we were really down<br/>\nSo you say you want me<br/>\nMake up your mind<br/>\n&lsquo;Cause I&rsquo;m not gonna be here for long</i></b></p><p><b><i>Baby, baby\nin time<br/>\nBaby I know you&rsquo;ll find<br/>\nThat what you needed was here<br/>\nAnd think about it my dear<br/><br/></i></b></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you around then\u201d Steve whispered and gently\nhugged you, you wrapped your arms around his broad shoulders but still felt\nuncomfortable doing so, \u201dYeah\u201d you awkwardly answered and gave him a fake smile\nbefore leading him to the door, wanting to get rid of him so bad.</p><p>Steve gave you one last smile before turning\naround and opening the door, only to see Tony standing there with a bouquet of\nroses and his hands. \u201cT-Tony?\u201d you whispered as your heart dropped to the pit\nof your stomach, you immediately felt nauseous as you had been caught.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Steve asked while Tony\nentered your apartment while quickly scanning your outfit before glaring at the\nsuper soldier. \u201cAre you dating, [Y/N]?\u201d Tony hissed angrily while glaring at\nyou. Steve nodded his head and furrowed his eyebrows in confusion, \u201cYes, we\u2019ve\nbeen dating for three weeks now\u201d. His answer made Tony clench his jaw while\nslowly shaking his head as he knew what you had done both of them.</p><p>\u201cSame here, Steve. We\u2019ve obviously been played\u201d\nhe continued to which Steve looked at you, hoping to have you say that Tony was\nlying but your avoiding gaze showed the opposite. \u201cWow\u201d was all Steve said to\nwhich you swallowed hard, \u201cWho do you want to be with? I don\u2019t have time to be\nplayed\u201d the super soldier spoke with annoyance as he felt so disappointed and\nhurt as you really meant something to him.</p><p>You clenched your eyes shut, \u201cTony\u201d you\nwhispered and listened to Steve scoffing loudly before saying, \u201cLose my number\u201d\nbefore storming out of your apartment and slamming the door shut behind him.\nYou slowly opened your eyes and had tears brim them when Tony dropped the\nbouquet of roses and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI love you. I know that we had been dating for\nthree weeks but I knew that you were the love of my life, [Y/N]. I was willing\nto do anything for you, I stopped lying and seeing other women for you only to\nhave you do all of that to me\u201d he hissed while looking away from you.</p><p>His words were like sharp daggers to your heart,\n\u201cTony!\u201d you choked through the tears and reached out for him, only to have him\ntake a step back and hum in disapproval. \u201dNo, you wanted me to show you that I was\nserious and I did. You\u2019re a hypocrite for doing the exact same thing\u201d you sniffled\nloudly and shook your head, feeling like you were about to lose everything.</p><p>\u201cI-I love you too! I-It was never serious with\nSteve! I just liked the feeling of being desired\u201d you shamefully confessed\nwhile your heart pounded harshly in your chest.

You smiled, \u201cMe too, I\u2019m surprised\nthat Captain America can move his hips\u201d you teased while remembering how he had\ndanced his heart out on the dancefloor at the club.</p><p>Steve\u2019s checks reddened at your comment as you\nhad been the only one who had seen him let loose and he didn\u2019t regret it at\nall. He huffed amused, \u201cIf Tony would have been there, he\u2019d tease me for the rest\nof my life\u201d he added and placed his hand on your thigh. At the mention of Tony\u2019s\nname, your heart dropped to the pit of your stomach as you remembered what you\nwere doing.</p><p>You couldn\u2019t decide on what man to choose and\ndecided to date both, the feeling of having two handsome superheroes wanting\nyou, dedicating all their time and attention of you made your heart swell with\npride as you felt so powerful.</p><p>But the thing was that Tony had something that\nmade you feel extraordinary, that man was able to make you feel so many and intense\nemotions and you found yourself yearning for his presence every day. With Steve,\nyou didn\u2019t feel the same way, spending time with him while knowing that you\nprobably wouldn\u2019t end up with him was just to feed your ego, nothing more.</p><p>\u201c[Y/N]?\u201d the super soldier gently spoke and\nwaved his hand in front of your face as you had completely tuned out, \u201cSorry\u201d\nyou cleared your throat and smiled, \u201cWhat were you saying?\u201d you asked, silently\nhoping that he hadn\u2019t noticed that Tony\u2019s name was the reason for your little\ntime out.</p><p>Steve chuckled, \u201cI was asking if you\u2019d like to\nmeet up again, tomorrow? I thought about bringing the chocolate fondue fountain\nand same fresh fruits?\u201d his voice lowered to a husky whispered while slowly\nleaning in. The image of Steve feeding pieced of fruit covered in chocolate was\na delicate thought but your mind replaced him with Tony.</p><p>\u201cI-uh..\u201d you stuttered and leaned back, not\nwanting to kiss Steve as it felt like you were betraying Tony. \u201cI have a busy\nday ahead and would be too exhausted to enjoy the chocolate fountain\u201d you lied\nand let out a silent sigh of relief when the super soldier nodded his head in\nagreement and leaned back, but kept his hand on your thigh. His touch slowly\nbegan to make you feel uncomfortable as your mind body and soul began to yearn\nfor Tony again.</p><p>You cleared your throat again and decided to\ncall it a night as you wanted to be alone with your thoughts, \u201cIt\u2019s very late,\nyou should go and I\u2019ll give you a call, okay?\u201d you suggested to which Steve\nnodded his head and looked down at his watch, seeing that it was indeed late. \u201cYeah,\nI have an early training session in a few hours, don\u2019t want to be all cranky\u201d\nhe chuckled, you added a fake one before standing up and adjusting your short\ndress.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><b><i>But I gotta\nbe strong<br>\nYou did me wrong<br>\nWhen I thought that we were really down<br>\nSo you say you want me<br>\nMake up your mind<br>\n\u2018Cause I\u2019m not gonna be here for long</i></b></p><p><b><i>Baby, baby\nin time<br>\nBaby I know you\u2019ll find<br>\nThat what you needed was here<br>\nAnd think about it my dear<br><br></i></b></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you around then\u201d Steve whispered and gently\nhugged you, you wrapped your arms around his broad shoulders but still felt\nuncomfortable doing so, \u201dYeah\u201d you awkwardly answered and gave him a fake smile\nbefore leading him to the door, wanting to get rid of him so bad.</p><p>Steve gave you one last smile before turning\naround and opening the door, only to see Tony standing there with a bouquet of\nroses and his hands. \u201cT-Tony?\u201d you whispered as your heart dropped to the pit\nof your stomach, you immediately felt nauseous as you had been caught.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Steve asked while Tony\nentered your apartment while quickly scanning your outfit before glaring at the\nsuper soldier. \u201cAre you dating, [Y/N]?\u201d Tony hissed angrily while glaring at\nyou. Steve nodded his head and furrowed his eyebrows in confusion, \u201cYes, we\u2019ve\nbeen dating for three weeks now\u201d. His answer made Tony clench his jaw while\nslowly shaking his head as he knew what you had done both of them.</p><p>\u201cSame here, Steve. We\u2019ve obviously been played\u201d\nhe continued to which Steve looked at you, hoping to have you say that Tony was\nlying but your avoiding gaze showed the opposite. \u201cWow\u201d was all Steve said to\nwhich you swallowed hard, \u201cWho do you want to be with? I don\u2019t have time to be\nplayed\u201d the super soldier spoke with annoyance as he felt so disappointed and\nhurt as you really meant something to him.</p><p>You clenched your eyes shut, \u201cTony\u201d you\nwhispered and listened to Steve scoffing loudly before saying, \u201cLose my number\u201d\nbefore storming out of your apartment and slamming the door shut behind him.\nYou slowly opened your eyes and had tears brim them when Tony dropped the\nbouquet of roses and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI love you. I know that we had been dating for\nthree weeks but I knew that you were the love of my life, [Y/N]. I was willing\nto do anything for you, I stopped lying and seeing other women for you only to\nhave you do all of that to me\u201d he hissed while looking away from you.</p><p>His words were like sharp daggers to your heart,\n\u201cTony!\u201d you choked through the tears and reached out for him, only to have him\ntake a step back and hum in disapproval. \u201dNo, you wanted me to show you that I was\nserious and I did. You\u2019re a hypocrite for doing the exact same thing\u201d you sniffled\nloudly and shook your head, feeling like you were about to lose everything.</p><p>\u201cI-I love you too! I-It was never serious with\nSteve! I just liked the feeling of being desired\u201d you shamefully confessed\nwhile your heart pounded harshly in your chest. Tony shrugged at your words and\nlooked at his feet, \u201cI felt the same way for a long while until I met you.

If any post has a link in it, it won\u2019t appear in the search engine. Obviously others are saying it too but please if you see a fic/content you like the reblog it! It just became much harder for content creators to spread their work and this would help a lot! <b>You can find my Masterlist on my profile and the Whumptober Masterlist under series!</b></i></p><p><i><b><br/></b></i></p><hr><p>A scream echoes through the room. It\u2019s Peter, he\u2019s screaming.<b><br/></b></p><p>Tony watches through metal bars chained to a wall fear edged into his features. Peter wasn\u2019t supposed to be here, he was supposed to be home. </p><p><i>This was all his fault, this was all his fault. His kid shouldn\u2019t be here. </i></p><p>Peter lays on the ground body seizing in pain, arms, and feet bound in shackles. A shock collar sat around his neck glowing brightly as a man loomed over the boy. A few more seconds go by before the screaming stops. </p><p>Peter goes limp, his breathing sharp and fast. A mixture of gasps and sobs tremble through his body. </p><p><i>He was just a kid. He shouldn\u2019t be here, he shouldn\u2019t be here.</i></p><p>\u201cTony,\u201d Peter whispers almost reaching out for him until the man stomps on his fingers. </p><p>The screaming starts again, and Tony feels like he\u2019s about to puke. </p><p>\u201cTony!\u201d This time Peter screams out and all the air leaves Tony\u2019s lungs. \u201cTony, please!\u201d</p><p>The screaming continues only growing louder by the minute. Tony pulls against his chains desperately trying to get to Peter. Tears threaten to spill the longing he looked at his kid crying in pain calling out for his mentor to save him. </p><p>The screaming stops, but Peter doesn\u2019t cry. Instead, he goes quiet and still. His body slightly twitching from the electrical torture he endured. </p><p>\u201cI have to give it to the boy,\u201d The man said with a smirk on his face. \u201cHe lasted longer than I expected. I\u2019m going to have fun with his one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just a kid!\u201d Tony cried out. \u201cHe has nothing to do with the Avengers! </p><p>\u201cEven if that\u2019s true Hydra doesn\u2019t give me a kid a torture every day now. No, they come once every few weeks. And I hate to wait about a few weeks for the next one.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s body shuttered. \u201cYou\u2019re sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you an hour Stark. Wouldn\u2019t want to kill the boy just yet.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t bother to look at the man leaving the room. His eyes watched Peter\u2019s body making sure that he was in fact, breathing. Tony wanted nothing more than to run over and comfort him. To brush is curls out of his face and tell him that they\u2019ll get out of this hellhole. </p><p>But he couldn\u2019t, Tony could only watch a few feet away staring at the boy who should be getting tortured. They only wanted Peter for leverage, for some sick twisted game that involved Tony\u2019s suffering. </p><p>He stares at Peter\u2019s sleeping body one more time before a fresh set of tears ran down his face. </p><p><i>This was all his fault. </i></p><p>____</p><p>When Peter wakes up, he wakes up to the sound of sniffling. His eyes flutter open body aching from what he just endured. He wiggles his hands trying to find some feeling in his limbs before sitting up.</p><p>He groans shifting his weight trying to adjust to his soreness. His muscles felt sluggish tired from the spasms he experienced earlier. Black dots filled his vision as Peter was quick to blink them away. </p><p>\u201cPeter?\u201d Tony asked.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d He responded remembering his helpless cries. \u201cM\u2019sorry for earlier.\u201d</p><p>Tony eyes narrowed. \u201cYou have nothing to be sorry for Pete. I\u2019m the one who should be sorry.\u201d Peter opened his mouth to disagree but his mentor was quick to stop him. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be in this mess if it wasn\u2019t for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only people at fault here are those Hydra freaks.\u201d</p><p>His mentor sighed leaning his head against the brick wall. \u201cI\u2019m going to get you out this. I promise.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure the team is looking for us,\u201d He shrugged before rolling out his sore muscles. </p><p>\u201cSore?\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded. </p><p>\u201cLet me know if you start to have any pain in your chest. And not from shocks. The last I want is your heart to have issues from the stress you\u2019re being put through.\u201d </p><p>The door slams open as the same sick man from before comes strolling in. Peter\u2019s spider-sense buzzes loudly as a small hum comes from his shock collar. </p><p>\u201cHow ya doin kid? A little sore?\u201d The man grabs Peter\u2019s face roughly bring his chin upwards. \u201cYou know it\u2019s rude to not acknowledge someone when they\u2019re talking to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave him alone!\u201d Tony shouts. </p><p>The man laughs. \u201cGod you\u2019re so pathetic chained to that wall.\u201d </p><p>Anger boils within Peter as he glares at the man. He doesn\u2019t think, he spits in the man\u2019s face. \u201cFuck you.\u201d He smiles only for a moment before his senses warn him of oncoming danger. </p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have done that.\u201d</p><p>His vision blurs, body slamming to the ground as it spasms. Peter gasps trying to get air into lungs a screaming escaping his lips. His body twitches, unable to control itself from the electrical shocks. </p><p>\u201cStop hurting him!\u201d Tony yelled! </p><p>The man doesn\u2019t listen, inside he turns up the intensity smiling at the screams Peter makes. \u00a0He laughs enjoying every moment. </p><p>____</p><p>Tony watched in horror as Peter\u2019s body twitched on the ground, him gasping for air through his mangled cries. He wanted to look away, but he had to make sure his kid was ok.</p><p>He bit his tongue, making sure he didn\u2019t cry. Not in front of Peter, not when he\u2019s the one in pain. Crying can wait until his kid wasn\u2019t looking at him with his own tearful eyes. </p><p>Peter screams loudly, his body locked tight in pain that Tony almost didn\u2019t hear the metal footsteps knocking down his door. His head snaps to the side a wave of relief washing over him. </p><p><i>Rhodey.</i></p><p>Natasha is the next person to kick down Peter\u2019s door. She effortlessly kicks the man the in the knocking him to the ground. She turns off the shock collar unlocking it from Peter\u2019s neck</p><p>\u201cGet me,\u201d Tony huffs panicked. \u201cOut of these!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to see you too Tones,\u201d His friend jokes breaking the chains.</p><p>By the time he\u2019s freed, Steve was breaking Peter\u2019s restraints as Natasha muttered comforting words to the whimpering boy. Once he was free, the kid practically wrapped his whole body around \u00a0Natasha body still twitching from the shocks. </p><p>Before Tony could even ask, Rhodey was quick to knock down the bars keeping them separated. Running through the opening his friend created, he slid over to Peter taking him out of Natasha\u2019s arms and into his. </p><p>Peter whimpers. \u201cTony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got you, kid, I got you,\u201d Tony whispers kissing the top of his head.</p><hr><p>Permanent Tags:</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSAoXn7rDKTQ-SDQxNVGeAg\">@winteriscomingidjits</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mANuzPF2mJ6WzfNF_feQprQ\">@lizgchamp</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2CKgaSTJTCjMH-zHQXoGzw\">@theflameofdeath</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mo1EWywR0ccRgrmOc0jyBvQ\">@jaderbugz</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfoPV1Ui7yX-K4v94t3R7tg\">@queenmira29</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mB-BRcATjRvvVf-wcKsaeiw\">@that-sokovian-bastard</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTL_fBdzW5DV5gqufjzLz9A\">@love-allthingsmarvel</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8gkvVO6zlA4ee95PGAYa-A\">@satanandblade</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mU1QmiATgpQD5Iu2P2ERQBA\">@yourcaitlinraye</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqyi0AE8b8Vu4wbSPtRxApg\">@fanobsessed</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mewUy_XelSasFGtxS5vBRvQ\">@grantward3</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxFlKSjxkyTLa9S-0xos4YQ\">@camila1818</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6p1YEmE0Qbkr4Ns0UGLIcw\">@divergentseagreengirl</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2nW_T8ialWJHy7lteytuMg\">@bobbyrocha20</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxKW9HvPyrdXVuvoWeIyv3g\">@capbuckthor</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdn1sI03iVG0cTZly9hABww\">@buckysendoftheline</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmxj6dCflGVofFYyoOyBbmw\">@graysonmalfoy</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtTiaTbO-mBahLbup3actVw\">@8181pjh</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHMAe5ZiH1b_S3jsSSYUUtw\">@they-are-not-only-fandoms</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mn0sfvpo23beszFoU6yfj7w\">@niyaslife13</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/meerNkTiABW5dWq5OaCd1PA\">@queenshipper63</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m66FQFLkc7scpxt_GYjBmhQ\">@buckys-newarm</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/miP3cE4YMZhN3GCzmU37_1A\">@dolan-hollander</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mevyaZrgR8GtBkdROGoPYAw\">@theshortegg</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mf1n848G1wIm0T4kZ_epceA\">@topjean</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDMxStN2oLDhlEHXolvQ3hg\">@hunters-from-stark-tower</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpRzNb0VH4mKtBGw_dURFSQ\">@fullofsasstiel</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6-bf6s2SIze9i8e1xmhBzg\">@ilovetvshowsblog</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m92sOrWGQh4fo_HHXwt_CJw\">@its-destiel-ass-butt</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ml6gRKooUky0BvQACA69JuA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ml6gRKooUky0BvQACA69JuA\">@muggle-who-lived</a>| <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBVhlXxyikz14d7VOmFef4A\">@wronglanemendes</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtG0pLUGW0dDfFLts8cfM5g\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtG0pLUGW0dDfFLts8cfM5g\">@loony-luju</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPaHUhIrm3xUpdbTJeQTVlg\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPaHUhIrm3xUpdbTJeQTVlg\">@emilydiangelo</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnRyYF33YU6iDIALdO-UlPQ\">@the-last\u2013time-saving</a>\u00a0| <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/micVMIU8USJ0eVFNz1tipjw\">@omegatomato</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTnrA5UKprJ6EI9pTVYTs4Q\">@liljeknott</a></p><p>Whumptober Tags:</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZt7Oc9qpicqLlHjHPJpndA\">@parkrstark</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msKGQqv2ibLw0rJG3ybtpzg\">@dissupanatrlbish</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVfrjQbOKBs5jEcSgtp3vHQ\">@pookiethefrickinbunn</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNk_H7PLSRr0JI-13XShCrw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNk_H7PLSRr0JI-13XShCrw\">@thepanthatcanwithoutaplan</a> |\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-9L9VyDsvpkcqEL0n1m39g\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-9L9VyDsvpkcqEL0n1m39g\">@a-distressed-fan</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbvm2sEzD6riXaeYhCZjLyQ\">@sunny-after-all</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfCUDDTejTVrMaDJAQlyw7g\">@wisehokte</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWc1e_Sxqybw1Ja9tHyf5OA\">@marvelwallet</a></p><p>Peter Parker Tags:</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMnjBH8VtbHN4L258wgqf7w\">@mainspidey</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mX25ZtVXMCTRTmh1eOUU7Lg\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mX25ZtVXMCTRTmh1eOUU7Lg\">@mcheung0314</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m60ljilaA1xdYQ8l46fbpGg\">@marvelbased</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCWYPQdGnC8zqqRCJydNIQA\">@wtfwolfstar</a></p><p>Tony Stark Tags:</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1ybOYA-ncRK7OsGkgMgn2g\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1ybOYA-ncRK7OsGkgMgn2g\">@dressed-up-just-like-z1ggy</a></p><h2>If anyone wants to be tagged just send an ask!</h2>",

It\u2019s Peter, he\u2019s screaming.<b><br></b></p><p>Tony watches through metal bars chained to a wall fear edged into his features. Peter wasn\u2019t supposed to be here, he was supposed to be home. </p><p><i>This was all his fault, this was all his fault. His kid shouldn\u2019t be here. </i></p><p>Peter lays on the ground body seizing in pain, arms, and feet bound in shackles. A shock collar sat around his neck glowing brightly as a man loomed over the boy. A few more seconds go by before the screaming stops. </p><p>Peter goes limp, his breathing sharp and fast. A mixture of gasps and sobs tremble through his body. </p><p><i>He was just a kid. He shouldn\u2019t be here, he shouldn\u2019t be here.</i></p><p>\u201cTony,\u201d Peter whispers almost reaching out for him until the man stomps on his fingers. </p><p>The screaming starts again, and Tony feels like he\u2019s about to puke. </p><p>\u201cTony!\u201d This time Peter screams out and all the air leaves Tony\u2019s lungs. \u201cTony, please!\u201d</p><p>The screaming continues only growing louder by the minute. Tony pulls against his chains desperately trying to get to Peter. Tears threaten to spill the longing he looked at his kid crying in pain calling out for his mentor to save him. </p><p>The screaming stops, but Peter doesn\u2019t cry. Instead, he goes quiet and still. His body slightly twitching from the electrical torture he endured. </p><p>\u201cI have to give it to the boy,\u201d The man said with a smirk on his face. \u201cHe lasted longer than I expected. I\u2019m going to have fun with his one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just a kid!\u201d Tony cried out. \u201cHe has nothing to do with the Avengers! </p><p>\u201cEven if that\u2019s true Hydra doesn\u2019t give me a kid a torture every day now. No, they come once every few weeks. And I hate to wait about a few weeks for the next one.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s body shuttered. \u201cYou\u2019re sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you an hour Stark. Wouldn\u2019t want to kill the boy just yet.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t bother to look at the man leaving the room. His eyes watched Peter\u2019s body making sure that he was in fact, breathing. Tony wanted nothing more than to run over and comfort him. To brush is curls out of his face and tell him that they\u2019ll get out of this hellhole. </p><p>But he couldn\u2019t, Tony could only watch a few feet away staring at the boy who should be getting tortured. They only wanted Peter for leverage, for some sick twisted game that involved Tony\u2019s suffering. </p><p>He stares at Peter\u2019s sleeping body one more time before a fresh set of tears ran down his face. </p><p><i>This was all his fault. </i></p><p>____</p><p>When Peter wakes up, he wakes up to the sound of sniffling. His eyes flutter open body aching from what he just endured.

It\u2019s Peter, he\u2019s screaming.<b><br></b></p><p>Tony watches through metal bars chained to a wall fear edged into his features. Peter wasn\u2019t supposed to be here, he was supposed to be home. </p><p><i>This was all his fault, this was all his fault. His kid shouldn\u2019t be here. </i></p><p>Peter lays on the ground body seizing in pain, arms, and feet bound in shackles. A shock collar sat around his neck glowing brightly as a man loomed over the boy. A few more seconds go by before the screaming stops. </p><p>Peter goes limp, his breathing sharp and fast. A mixture of gasps and sobs tremble through his body. </p><p><i>He was just a kid. He shouldn\u2019t be here, he shouldn\u2019t be here.</i></p><p>\u201cTony,\u201d Peter whispers almost reaching out for him until the man stomps on his fingers. </p><p>The screaming starts again, and Tony feels like he\u2019s about to puke. </p><p>\u201cTony!\u201d This time Peter screams out and all the air leaves Tony\u2019s lungs. \u201cTony, please!\u201d</p><p>The screaming continues only growing louder by the minute. Tony pulls against his chains desperately trying to get to Peter. Tears threaten to spill the longing he looked at his kid crying in pain calling out for his mentor to save him. </p><p>The screaming stops, but Peter doesn\u2019t cry. Instead, he goes quiet and still. His body slightly twitching from the electrical torture he endured. </p><p>\u201cI have to give it to the boy,\u201d The man said with a smirk on his face. \u201cHe lasted longer than I expected. I\u2019m going to have fun with his one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just a kid!\u201d Tony cried out. \u201cHe has nothing to do with the Avengers! </p><p>\u201cEven if that\u2019s true Hydra doesn\u2019t give me a kid a torture every day now. No, they come once every few weeks. And I hate to wait about a few weeks for the next one.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s body shuttered. \u201cYou\u2019re sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you an hour Stark. Wouldn\u2019t want to kill the boy just yet.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t bother to look at the man leaving the room. His eyes watched Peter\u2019s body making sure that he was in fact, breathing. Tony wanted nothing more than to run over and comfort him. To brush is curls out of his face and tell him that they\u2019ll get out of this hellhole. </p><p>But he couldn\u2019t, Tony could only watch a few feet away staring at the boy who should be getting tortured. They only wanted Peter for leverage, for some sick twisted game that involved Tony\u2019s suffering. </p><p>He stares at Peter\u2019s sleeping body one more time before a fresh set of tears ran down his face. </p><p><i>This was all his fault. </i></p><p>____</p><p>When Peter wakes up, he wakes up to the sound of sniffling. His eyes flutter open body aching from what he just endured. He wiggles his hands trying to find some feeling in his limbs before sitting up.</p><p>He groans shifting his weight trying to adjust to his soreness. His muscles felt sluggish tired from the spasms he experienced earlier. Black dots filled his vision as Peter was quick to blink them away. </p><p>\u201cPeter?\u201d Tony asked.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d He responded remembering his helpless cries. \u201cM\u2019sorry for earlier.\u201d</p><p>Tony eyes narrowed. \u201cYou have nothing to be sorry for Pete. I\u2019m the one who should be sorry.\u201d Peter opened his mouth to disagree but his mentor was quick to stop him. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be in this mess if it wasn\u2019t for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only people at fault here are those Hydra freaks.\u201d</p><p>His mentor sighed leaning his head against the brick wall. \u201cI\u2019m going to get you out this. I promise.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure the team is looking for us,\u201d He shrugged before rolling out his sore muscles. </p><p>\u201cSore?\u201d</p><p>Peter nodded. </p><p>\u201cLet me know if you start to have any pain in your chest. And not from shocks. The last I want is your heart to have issues from the stress you\u2019re being put through.\u201d </p><p>The door slams open as the same sick man from before comes strolling in. Peter\u2019s spider-sense buzzes loudly as a small hum comes from his shock collar. </p><p>\u201cHow ya doin kid? A little sore?\u201d The man grabs Peter\u2019s face roughly bring his chin upwards. \u201cYou know it\u2019s rude to not acknowledge someone when they\u2019re talking to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave him alone!\u201d Tony shouts. </p><p>The man laughs. \u201cGod you\u2019re so pathetic chained to that wall.\u201d </p><p>Anger boils within Peter as he glares at the man. He doesn\u2019t think, he spits in the man\u2019s face. \u201cFuck you.\u201d He smiles only for a moment before his senses warn him of oncoming danger. </p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have done that.\u201d</p><p>His vision blurs, body slamming to the ground as it spasms. Peter gasps trying to get air into lungs a screaming escaping his lips. His body twitches, unable to control itself from the electrical shocks. </p><p>\u201cStop hurting him!\u201d Tony yelled! </p><p>The man doesn\u2019t listen, inside he turns up the intensity smiling at the screams Peter makes. \u00a0He laughs enjoying every moment. </p><p>____</p><p>Tony watched in horror as Peter\u2019s body twitched on the ground, him gasping for air through his mangled cries. He wanted to look away, but he had to make sure his kid was ok.</p><p>He bit his tongue, making sure he didn\u2019t cry. Not in front of Peter, not when he\u2019s the one in pain. Crying can wait until his kid wasn\u2019t looking at him with his own tearful eyes. </p><p>Peter screams loudly, his body locked tight in pain that Tony almost didn\u2019t hear the metal footsteps knocking down his door. His head snaps to the side a wave of relief washing over him. </p><p><i>Rhodey.</i></p><p>Natasha is the next person to kick down Peter\u2019s door. She effortlessly kicks the man the in the knocking him to the ground.

It&rsquo;s Peter, he&rsquo;s screaming.<b><br /></b></p><p>Tony watches through metal bars chained to a wall fear edged into his features. Peter wasn&rsquo;t supposed to be here, he was supposed to be home. </p><p><i>This was all his fault, this was all his fault. His kid shouldn&rsquo;t be here. </i></p><p>Peter lays on the ground body seizing in pain, arms, and feet bound in shackles. A shock collar sat around his neck glowing brightly as a man loomed over the boy. A few more seconds go by before the screaming stops. </p><p>Peter goes limp, his breathing sharp and fast. A mixture of gasps and sobs tremble through his body. </p><p><i>He was just a kid. He shouldn&rsquo;t be here, he shouldn&rsquo;t be here.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Tony,&rdquo; Peter whispers almost reaching out for him until the man stomps on his fingers. </p><p>The screaming starts again, and Tony feels like he&rsquo;s about to puke. </p><p>&ldquo;Tony!&rdquo; This time Peter screams out and all the air leaves Tony&rsquo;s lungs. &ldquo;Tony, please!&rdquo;</p><p>The screaming continues only growing louder by the minute. Tony pulls against his chains desperately trying to get to Peter. Tears threaten to spill the longing he looked at his kid crying in pain calling out for his mentor to save him. </p><p>The screaming stops, but Peter doesn&rsquo;t cry. Instead, he goes quiet and still. His body slightly twitching from the electrical torture he endured. </p><p>&ldquo;I have to give it to the boy,&rdquo; The man said with a smirk on his face. &ldquo;He lasted longer than I expected. I&rsquo;m going to have fun with his one.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s just a kid!&rdquo; Tony cried out. &ldquo;He has nothing to do with the Avengers! </p><p>&ldquo;Even if that&rsquo;s true Hydra doesn&rsquo;t give me a kid a torture every day now. No, they come once every few weeks. And I hate to wait about a few weeks for the next one.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s body shuttered. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re sick.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you an hour Stark. Wouldn&rsquo;t want to kill the boy just yet.&rdquo;</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t bother to look at the man leaving the room. His eyes watched Peter&rsquo;s body making sure that he was in fact, breathing. Tony wanted nothing more than to run over and comfort him. To brush is curls out of his face and tell him that they&rsquo;ll get out of this hellhole. </p><p>But he couldn&rsquo;t, Tony could only watch a few feet away staring at the boy who should be getting tortured. They only wanted Peter for leverage, for some sick twisted game that involved Tony&rsquo;s suffering. </p><p>He stares at Peter&rsquo;s sleeping body one more time before a fresh set of tears ran down his face. </p><p><i>This was all his fault. </i></p><p>____</p><p>When Peter wakes up, he wakes up to the sound of sniffling. His eyes flutter open body aching from what he just endured. He wiggles his hands trying to find some feeling in his limbs before sitting up.</p><p>He groans shifting his weight trying to adjust to his soreness. His muscles felt sluggish tired from the spasms he experienced earlier. Black dots filled his vision as Peter was quick to blink them away. </p><p>&ldquo;Peter?&rdquo; Tony asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; He responded remembering his helpless cries. &ldquo;M&rsquo;sorry for earlier.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony eyes narrowed. &ldquo;You have nothing to be sorry for Pete. I&rsquo;m the one who should be sorry.&rdquo; Peter opened his mouth to disagree but his mentor was quick to stop him. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t be in this mess if it wasn&rsquo;t for me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The only people at fault here are those Hydra freaks.&rdquo;</p><p>His mentor sighed leaning his head against the brick wall. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get you out this. I promise.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure the team is looking for us,&rdquo; He shrugged before rolling out his sore muscles. </p><p>&ldquo;Sore?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter nodded. </p><p>&ldquo;Let me know if you start to have any pain in your chest. And not from shocks. The last I want is your heart to have issues from the stress you&rsquo;re being put through.&rdquo; </p><p>The door slams open as the same sick man from before comes strolling in. Peter&rsquo;s spider-sense buzzes loudly as a small hum comes from his shock collar. </p><p>&ldquo;How ya doin kid? A little sore?&rdquo; The man grabs Peter&rsquo;s face roughly bring his chin upwards. &ldquo;You know it&rsquo;s rude to not acknowledge someone when they&rsquo;re talking to you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Leave him alone!&rdquo; Tony shouts. </p><p>The man laughs. &ldquo;God you&rsquo;re so pathetic chained to that wall.&rdquo; </p><p>Anger boils within Peter as he glares at the man. He doesn&rsquo;t think, he spits in the man&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Fuck you.&rdquo; He smiles only for a moment before his senses warn him of oncoming danger. </p><p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t have done that.&rdquo;</p><p>His vision blurs, body slamming to the ground as it spasms. Peter gasps trying to get air into lungs a screaming escaping his lips. His body twitches, unable to control itself from the electrical shocks. </p><p>&ldquo;Stop hurting him!&rdquo; Tony yelled! </p><p>The man doesn&rsquo;t listen, inside he turns up the intensity smiling at the screams Peter makes. &nbsp;He laughs enjoying every moment. </p><p>____</p><p>Tony watched in horror as Peter&rsquo;s body twitched on the ground, him gasping for air through his mangled cries. He wanted to look away, but he had to make sure his kid was ok.</p><p>He bit his tongue, making sure he didn&rsquo;t cry. Not in front of Peter, not when he&rsquo;s the one in pain. Crying can wait until his kid wasn&rsquo;t looking at him with his own tearful eyes. </p><p>Peter screams loudly, his body locked tight in pain that Tony almost didn&rsquo;t hear the metal footsteps knocking down his door. His head snaps to the side a wave of relief washing over him. </p><p><i>Rhodey.</i></p><p>Natasha is the next person to kick down Peter&rsquo;s door. She effortlessly kicks the man the in the knocking him to the ground.
