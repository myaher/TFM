(Established IronStrange for this one) During a sorcerer mission, Stephen is sexually assaulted. And because Stephen is Stephen, he doesn\u2019t tell Tony about it. He\u2019s far too ashamed and believes that he betrayed Tony. But Tony grows more suspicious of his boyfriend, so goes to Wong for answers about what happened on that mission (oh Stephen, I\u2019m sorry)",

He pulled the mask off his head, his sweat-dampened curls springing up in all directions.  \u201cWe were gonna start on the Back to the Future trilogy, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me,\u201d said Wanda.  \u201cYou boys can watch your silly movies by yourselves.  Natasha said she\u2019d do my nails for me tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll just get destroyed again as soon as we get back to the farm!\u201d Pietro protested.  \u201cWhat\u2019s the point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAww, Ro, it\u2019s still fun,\u201d Barton said as he unbuckled his armguard.  \u201cLet the girls have their girly times, and you and Peter can watch your movies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou&rsquo;re not doing anything until you take a shower first, Spider-Kid,\u201d Tony said as he grabbed Peter around the neck, rubbing his knuckles into the top of his head.  \u201cThe eau de teenage boy you&rsquo;re letting off is a bit too pungent for my tastes right about now.  We wouldn\u2019t want the rest of the folks wilting at the dinner table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, I&rsquo;ll take a shower,\u201d grumbled Peter.  He ducked down out of Tony\u2019s grasp, wiping the sweat off his forehead with his mask.  \u201cAnd then dinner.  I\u2019m starving!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I!\u201d said Pietro with a grin.  \u201cRace ya!\u201d</p><p>Tony watched the two boys head towards the exit, with Peter talking a blue streak about Back to the Future or Legos or some other such thing.  Barton came up next to him, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cSeems like your boy\u2019s getting the hang of things there, Tony,\u201d Barton said.  \u201cI was pretty impressed by him today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Tony said softly.  He tapped the small, triangular-shaped device resting over his heart, watching with pride as his nanotech armor began to dissolve and flow back into its housing unit.  This long weekend was the first real test of his new armor, and so far it had performed well beyond his expectations.  \u201cYeah,\u201d he repeated, a little louder.  \u201cNot that I expected anything less, of course.  The kid\u2019s a natural, what else can I say?\u201d</p><p>Barton shot him an amused look, clapping a hand on his shoulder as they headed for the stairs.  \u201cDon&rsquo;t worry, Tony.  It eventually gets easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does?\u201d Tony asked, almost involuntarily.  \u201cAre ya sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d said Barton as they arrived in the equipment room.  \u201cIt\u2019s hard to not hover all the time at first, because it\u2019s instinctive, ya know?  You just wanna protect them from everything because they&rsquo;re just kids, and the real world kinda sucks.  But then as you keep going, it gets a little bit easier to fight against that instinct and to just sit back and watch, and then you eventually see that they really are a lot more capable than you think they might be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know Pete\u2019s capable,\u201d Tony cut in.  \u201cHe\u2019s more than capable, in fact.  But I still\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d Barton interrupted.  \u201cI know the twins are a few years older than Peter, but they were close enough to his age now when I first got them that I feel like I can say this.  You&rsquo;re never gonna be absolutely sure about what you&rsquo;re doing with teenagers.  It\u2019s always gonna feel like a guessing game, so the best thing you can do is just keep putting your best guesses forward, and then just pray like hell that you don&rsquo;t mess \u2018em up all that much by the time they turn into adults.\u201d</p><p>Tony shot Barton a look sharper than his arrowheads.  \u201cGee, thanks, Legolas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I just call things like I see \u2018em,\u201d said Barton with a chuckle.  \u201cBut c\u2019mon, Tony.  If you haven\u2019t messed up that kid of yours by now, then I don&rsquo;t think it\u2019s possible.  He&rsquo;s gonna be fine!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure <i>he\u2019ll</i> be fine,\u201d Tony said, not quite convincingly.  \u201cNow <i>me</i>, on the other hand\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou&rsquo;re gonna be fine too, Tony,\u201d Barton said as they arrived on the main floor of the residential section.  \u201cNow, what\u2019s this I hear about a wedding?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><i><b>The full chapter will post on Monday, December 17th :)</b></i></p>",

This long weekend was the first real test of his new armor, and so far it had performed well beyond his expectations.  \u201cYeah,\u201d he repeated, a little louder.  \u201cNot that I expected anything less, of course.  The kid\u2019s a natural, what else can I say?\u201d</p><p>Barton shot him an amused look, clapping a hand on his shoulder as they headed for the stairs.  \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Tony.

You just wanna protect them from everything because they\u2019re just kids, and the real world kinda sucks.  But then as you keep going, it gets a little bit easier to fight against that instinct and to just sit back and watch, and then you eventually see that they really are a lot more capable than you think they might be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know Pete\u2019s capable,\u201d Tony cut in.  \u201cHe\u2019s more than capable, in fact.  But I still\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d Barton interrupted.  \u201cI know the twins are a few years older than Peter, but they were close enough to his age now when I first got them that I feel like I can say this.  You\u2019re never gonna be absolutely sure about what you\u2019re doing with teenagers.  It\u2019s always gonna feel like a guessing game, so the best thing you can do is just keep putting your best guesses forward, and then just pray like hell that you don\u2019t mess \u2018em up all that much by the time they turn into adults.\u201d</p><p>Tony shot Barton a look sharper than his arrowheads.  \u201cGee, thanks, Legolas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I just call things like I see \u2018em,\u201d said Barton with a chuckle.  \u201cBut c\u2019mon, Tony.  If you haven\u2019t messed up that kid of yours by now, then I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible.  He\u2019s gonna be fine!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure <i>he\u2019ll</i> be fine,\u201d Tony said, not quite convincingly.  \u201cNow <i>me</i>, on the other hand\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna be fine too, Tony,\u201d Barton said as they arrived on the main floor of the residential section.  \u201cNow, what\u2019s this I hear about a wedding?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><i><b>The full chapter will post on Monday, December 17th :)</b></i></p></p>",

But at least he didn&rsquo;t have any time to pine.</p>\n\n<p>God he was pathetic, <em>Get it together Rogers.</em></p>\n\n<p>And with that, he flicked off the lamp on his bedside table and tried to sleep.</p>\n\n<hr width=\"\u201c33%\u201d\"><p>He missed Steve</p>\n\n<p>As much as in the year he was off doing the USO tour.</p> \n\n<p>And it had only been two months, although he supposed it had something to do with recently realising that he\u2019d fallen in love with the spitfire he met in first grade, sometime in the 19th century.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>\u201cWhy\u2019ren\u2019t you sittin\u2019 with the other kids?\u201d Bucky finally asked Steve, after weeks of noticing that he never sat with anyone at lunch, even though he was always nice to everybody, unless they were mean; last time Timmy called Bobby a \u2018<em>fairy\u2019</em>, Steve, despite being 2 years younger and a foot shorter, stood up to him, and told Bobby, after his visit to the nurse, that it was worth it to see another bully hurt.</p> \n\n<p>The teachers thought that made him violent and impulsive.\nBucky thought he was brave.</p> \n\n<p>He also thought that the late-fall sun made his floppy blond hair look pretty, he wondered if it felt soft. \nIt looked like it felt soft.</p>\n\n<p>Steve\u2019s sigh brought him out of his thoughts, \u201cI can\u2019t play games \u2018cos i get sick a lot, an\u2019 Ma said I gotta be careful, so they said there\u2019s no point.\u201d \nHe said it like he\u2019s repeated over and over and he\u2019s resigned himself to a lifetime of lonely lunches. Bucky wanted to change that.</p>\n\n<p>Bucky wanted to be his friend, he didn\u2019t care that he couldn\u2019t play games - the boys usually played war and Bucky didn\u2019t really like it, he didn\u2019t see the point. He told Steve as much.</p>\n\n<p>Bucky also vowed to make him happy all the time from when his eyes lit up when he asked Steve if he wanted to be friends.\n</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>\u201cBucky, baby, you ok?\u201d</p> \n\n<p>Tony\u2019s voice never failed to make him smile. He turned his back on the window of their room to face him and gave Tony a slightly melancholy smile, \u201cI just, miss him, a lot.\u201d Tony crossed the room to him and wrapped his arms around his waist, leaning into his chest, \u201cI know.\u201d He huffed out a humourless laugh, \u201cGod, if you\u2019d told me back in 2012 that I\u2019d be missing Steve\u2026\u201d\n \nHe smiled, a little sadly, \u201cThey ever tell you that we weren\u2019t the best of friends until I almost blew myself up? A couple years before Steve crashed the old Shield and found you, god, I thought he was an asshole, self-righteous-\u201d</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>\u201c<em>-prick!</em> You can not just tell me what to do and what to make and how to live my life, Rogers.\u201d Tony slammed down the file on Steve\u2019s coffee table after bursting into his apartment.</p> \n\n<p>Steve shot up from his couch, snapping <em>Fahrenheit 451</em> shut. \u201cI-You-Tony! You can\u2019t come here, you shouldn\u2019t even know this place exists! Email me or something, you do know what that is right?\u201d \nHe knew he shouldn\u2019t aggravate him but Tony had no right, whatsoever, to, firstly, stalk him, as he evidently had (just because he could doesn\u2019t mean that he has to) and secondly just come to him ho-apartment.</p> \n\n<p>They had told him that people aren&rsquo;t as friendly in this century, that people didn&rsquo;t talk to strangers anymore (that lead to a stranger danger lecture he didn&rsquo;t want to recount). But Steve didn&rsquo;t have much of a desire to talk to people anyway.</p> \n\n<p>And he definitely hadn\u2019t told anyone he was living in Brooklyn now, although, he wasn\u2019t na\u00efve, he was positive that Shield were tracking his payments and probably other things (he didn\u2019t like to dwell on that too long), but at least they were respectful enough to recognise that he wanted privacy.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike <em>Tony goddamn Stark</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Were privacy and <em>basic fucking respect</em> difficult concepts for him?</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIs personal freedom a difficult concept for you?\u201d Tony barked back, glaring at him, \u201cYou are aware that the <em>\u2018Captain\u2019</em> in your fucking title is barely honorary, you have next to no experience in this century, a preschooler has more experience. You have no right to tell me what to do in a <em>battle for our lives</em>-\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Steve\u2019s jaw clicked, his eyes hardened and he stepped forward, almost nose-to-nose with him. \u201c<em>You,</em>\u201d he seethed, almost growling, \u201chave done nothing but what you want, regardless of any consequences whatsoever, to yourself or to others. I give you commands for your safety, the team\u2019s safety and the civillian\u2019s safety and the defeat of <em>who-fucking-ever</em>, you disobeying that puts everyone at risk. We are a team, and as the person responsibl-\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201c<em>But you aren\u2019t, Rogers!</em> You fucking aren\u2019t and you never will be. Just because you\u2019re the \u2018C.O\u2019and we\u2019re a \u2018team\u2019, don\u2019t think for a damn second we\u2019re ever going to be friends, the Avenegers aren\u2019t your fucking Howlies. Wake up already.\u201d</p> \n\n<p>Steve rolled his eyes, <em>God, he really thought he knew everything, huh</em>.</p> \n\n<p>\u201cOh, <em>fuck off</em>, Stark, you think I don\u2019t know that? I honestly couldn\u2019t care less if you, Thor and Barton have a weekly orgy. But we have a duty to do-\u201d</p>\n\n<p>This time, it was Tony who growled, \u201cAh, right, the only reason you\u2019re even fucking here-\u201d</p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cGet. Out.\u201d</em></p> \n\n<p>He spoke through gritted teeth and in a low voice. \u201cGet the fuck out right now.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Tony swallowed, for the first time, in all the months he\u2019d known Steve, he was terrified of him, his brain unhelpfully supplied the numbers and stats from his Dad\u2019s Project: Rebirth files, about how much he could bench and throw and just how fast he could move.</p>\n\n<p>It was probably best if he left.</p> \n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Bucky carded a hand through Tony\u2019s hair, comforting him, knowing that he regretted all the words he said, despite how much he had believed it at the time. \n\u201cYou were both assholes, still are, but at least you\u2019re friends and assholes.\u201d Tony snorted and tried to headbut Bucky, \u201cYou\u2019re an asshole too. And I wanna be more than friends,\u201d he mumbled into his shirt, the last half barely audible.</p> \n\n<p>Bucky\u2019s hand kept moving in his hair, a constant, soothing, moving motion, \u201cI know, sugar, I know.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>They stayed in that position for a while, the sky melding from a pink-orange, the sun a semi-circle on the horizon to a dark blue, a crescent moon hanging in the sky, surrounded by stars they could barely see.\n</p>\n\n<hr width=\"\u201c33%\u201d\"><p>Steve woke up when the moon was hanging high in the sky, a waxing crescent </p> \n<blockquote> <p> He turned his head to face Tony, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> \n\n<p>\u201cThe moon, right now, about a quarter visible, just after the new moon.

But at least he didn\u2019t have any time to pine.</p>\n\n<p>God he was pathetic, <em>Get it together Rogers.</em></p>\n\n<p>And with that, he flicked off the lamp on his bedside table and tried to sleep.</p>\n\n<hr width=\"\u201c33%\u201d\"><p>He missed Steve</p>\n\n<p>As much as in the year he was off doing the USO tour.</p> \n\n<p>And it had only been two months, although he supposed it had something to do with recently realising that he\u2019d fallen in love with the spitfire he met in first grade, sometime in the 19th century.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>\u201cWhy\u2019ren\u2019t you sittin\u2019 with the other kids?\u201d Bucky finally asked Steve, after weeks of noticing that he never sat with anyone at lunch, even though he was always nice to everybody, unless they were mean; last time Timmy called Bobby a \u2018<em>fairy\u2019</em>, Steve, despite being 2 years younger and a foot shorter, stood up to him, and told Bobby, after his visit to the nurse, that it was worth it to see another bully hurt.</p> \n\n<p>The teachers thought that made him violent and impulsive.\nBucky thought he was brave.</p> \n\n<p>He also thought that the late-fall sun made his floppy blond hair look pretty, he wondered if it felt soft. \nIt looked like it felt soft.</p>\n\n<p>Steve\u2019s sigh brought him out of his thoughts, \u201cI can\u2019t play games \u2018cos i get sick a lot, an\u2019 Ma said I gotta be careful, so they said there\u2019s no point.\u201d \nHe said it like he\u2019s repeated over and over and he\u2019s resigned himself to a lifetime of lonely lunches. Bucky wanted to change that.</p>\n\n<p>Bucky wanted to be his friend, he didn\u2019t care that he couldn\u2019t play games - the boys usually played war and Bucky didn\u2019t really like it, he didn\u2019t see the point. He told Steve as much.</p>\n\n<p>Bucky also vowed to make him happy all the time from when his eyes lit up when he asked Steve if he wanted to be friends.\n</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>\u201cBucky, baby, you ok?\u201d</p> \n\n<p>Tony\u2019s voice never failed to make him smile. He turned his back on the window of their room to face him and gave Tony a slightly melancholy smile, \u201cI just, miss him, a lot.\u201d Tony crossed the room to him and wrapped his arms around his waist, leaning into his chest, \u201cI know.\u201d He huffed out a humourless laugh, \u201cGod, if you\u2019d told me back in 2012 that I\u2019d be missing Steve\u2026\u201d\n \nHe smiled, a little sadly, \u201cThey ever tell you that we weren\u2019t the best of friends until I almost blew myself up? A couple years before Steve crashed the old Shield and found you, god, I thought he was an asshole, self-righteous-\u201d</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>\u201c<em>-prick!</em> You can not just tell me what to do and what to make and how to live my life, Rogers.\u201d Tony slammed down the file on Steve\u2019s coffee table after bursting into his apartment.</p> \n\n<p>Steve shot up from his couch, snapping <em>Fahrenheit 451</em> shut. \u201cI-You-Tony! You can\u2019t come here, you shouldn\u2019t even know this place exists! Email me or something, you do know what that is right?\u201d \nHe knew he shouldn\u2019t aggravate him but Tony had no right, whatsoever, to, firstly, stalk him, as he evidently had (just because he could doesn\u2019t mean that he has to) and secondly just come to him ho-apartment.</p> \n\n<p>They had told him that people aren\u2019t as friendly in this century, that people didn\u2019t talk to strangers anymore (that lead to a stranger danger lecture he didn\u2019t want to recount). But Steve didn\u2019t have much of a desire to talk to people anyway.</p> \n\n<p>And he definitely hadn\u2019t told anyone he was living in Brooklyn now, although, he wasn\u2019t na\u00efve, he was positive that Shield were tracking his payments and probably other things (he didn\u2019t like to dwell on that too long), but at least they were respectful enough to recognise that he wanted privacy.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike <em>Tony goddamn Stark</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Were privacy and <em>basic fucking respect</em> difficult concepts for him?</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIs personal freedom a difficult concept for you?\u201d Tony barked back, glaring at him, \u201cYou are aware that the <em>\u2018Captain\u2019</em> in your fucking title is barely honorary, you have next to no experience in this century, a preschooler has more experience. You have no right to tell me what to do in a <em>battle for our lives</em>-\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Steve\u2019s jaw clicked, his eyes hardened and he stepped forward, almost nose-to-nose with him. \u201c<em>You,</em>\u201d he seethed, almost growling, \u201chave done nothing but what you want, regardless of any consequences whatsoever, to yourself or to others. I give you commands for your safety, the team\u2019s safety and the civillian\u2019s safety and the defeat of <em>who-fucking-ever</em>, you disobeying that puts everyone at risk. We are a team, and as the person responsibl-\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201c<em>But you aren\u2019t, Rogers!</em> You fucking aren\u2019t and you never will be. Just because you\u2019re the \u2018C.O\u2019and we\u2019re a \u2018team\u2019, don\u2019t think for a damn second we\u2019re ever going to be friends, the Avenegers aren\u2019t your fucking Howlies. Wake up already.\u201d</p> \n\n<p>Steve rolled his eyes, <em>God, he really thought he knew everything, huh</em>.</p> \n\n<p>\u201cOh, <em>fuck off</em>, Stark, you think I don\u2019t know that? I honestly couldn\u2019t care less if you, Thor and Barton have a weekly orgy. But we have a duty to do-\u201d</p>\n\n<p>This time, it was Tony who growled, \u201cAh, right, the only reason you\u2019re even fucking here-\u201d</p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cGet. Out.\u201d</em></p> \n\n<p>He spoke through gritted teeth and in a low voice. \u201cGet the fuck out right now.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Tony swallowed, for the first time, in all the months he\u2019d known Steve, he was terrified of him, his brain unhelpfully supplied the numbers and stats from his Dad\u2019s Project: Rebirth files, about how much he could bench and throw and just how fast he could move.</p>\n\n<p>It was probably best if he left.</p> \n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Bucky carded a hand through Tony\u2019s hair, comforting him, knowing that he regretted all the words he said, despite how much he had believed it at the time. \n\u201cYou were both assholes, still are, but at least you\u2019re friends and assholes.\u201d Tony snorted and tried to headbut Bucky, \u201cYou\u2019re an asshole too. And I wanna be more than friends,\u201d he mumbled into his shirt, the last half barely audible.</p> \n\n<p>Bucky\u2019s hand kept moving in his hair, a constant, soothing, moving motion, \u201cI know, sugar, I know.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>They stayed in that position for a while, the sky melding from a pink-orange, the sun a semi-circle on the horizon to a dark blue, a crescent moon hanging in the sky, surrounded by stars they could barely see.\n</p>\n\n<hr width=\"\u201c33%\u201d\"><p>Steve woke up when the moon was hanging high in the sky, a waxing crescent </p> \n<blockquote> <p> He turned his head to face Tony, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> \n\n<p>\u201cThe moon, right now, about a quarter visible, just after the new moon.

But at least he didn&rsquo;t have any time to pine.</p>\n\n<p>God he was pathetic, <em>Get it together Rogers.</em></p>\n\n<p>And with that, he flicked off the lamp on his bedside table and tried to sleep.</p>\n\n<hr /><p>He missed Steve</p>\n\n<p>As much as in the year he was off doing the USO tour.</p> \n\n<p>And it had only been two months, although he supposed it had something to do with recently realising that he&rsquo;d fallen in love with the spitfire he met in first grade, sometime in the 19th century.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Why&rsquo;ren&rsquo;t you sittin&rsquo; with the other kids?&rdquo; Bucky finally asked Steve, after weeks of noticing that he never sat with anyone at lunch, even though he was always nice to everybody, unless they were mean; last time Timmy called Bobby a &lsquo;<em>fairy&rsquo;</em>, Steve, despite being 2 years younger and a foot shorter, stood up to him, and told Bobby, after his visit to the nurse, that it was worth it to see another bully hurt.</p> \n\n<p>The teachers thought that made him violent and impulsive.\nBucky thought he was brave.</p> \n\n<p>He also thought that the late-fall sun made his floppy blond hair look pretty, he wondered if it felt soft. \nIt looked like it felt soft.</p>\n\n<p>Steve&rsquo;s sigh brought him out of his thoughts, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t play games &lsquo;cos i get sick a lot, an&rsquo; Ma said I gotta be careful, so they said there&rsquo;s no point.&rdquo; \nHe said it like he&rsquo;s repeated over and over and he&rsquo;s resigned himself to a lifetime of lonely lunches. Bucky wanted to change that.</p>\n\n<p>Bucky wanted to be his friend, he didn&rsquo;t care that he couldn&rsquo;t play games - the boys usually played war and Bucky didn&rsquo;t really like it, he didn&rsquo;t see the point. He told Steve as much.</p>\n\n<p>Bucky also vowed to make him happy all the time from when his eyes lit up when he asked Steve if he wanted to be friends.\n</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Bucky, baby, you ok?&rdquo;</p> \n\n<p>Tony&rsquo;s voice never failed to make him smile. He turned his back on the window of their room to face him and gave Tony a slightly melancholy smile, &ldquo;I just, miss him, a lot.&rdquo; Tony crossed the room to him and wrapped his arms around his waist, leaning into his chest, &ldquo;I know.&rdquo; He huffed out a humourless laugh, &ldquo;God, if you&rsquo;d told me back in 2012 that I&rsquo;d be missing Steve&hellip;&rdquo;\n \nHe smiled, a little sadly, &ldquo;They ever tell you that we weren&rsquo;t the best of friends until I almost blew myself up? A couple years before Steve crashed the old Shield and found you, god, I thought he was an asshole, self-righteous-&rdquo;</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<em>-prick!</em> You can not just tell me what to do and what to make and how to live my life, Rogers.&rdquo; Tony slammed down the file on Steve&rsquo;s coffee table after bursting into his apartment.</p> \n\n<p>Steve shot up from his couch, snapping <em>Fahrenheit 451</em> shut. &ldquo;I-You-Tony! You can&rsquo;t come here, you shouldn&rsquo;t even know this place exists! Email me or something, you do know what that is right?&rdquo; \nHe knew he shouldn&rsquo;t aggravate him but Tony had no right, whatsoever, to, firstly, stalk him, as he evidently had (just because he could doesn&rsquo;t mean that he has to) and secondly just come to him ho-apartment.</p> \n\n<p>They had told him that people aren&rsquo;t as friendly in this century, that people didn&rsquo;t talk to strangers anymore (that lead to a stranger danger lecture he didn&rsquo;t want to recount). But Steve didn&rsquo;t have much of a desire to talk to people anyway.</p> \n\n<p>And he definitely hadn&rsquo;t told anyone he was living in Brooklyn now, although, he wasn&rsquo;t na&iuml;ve, he was positive that Shield were tracking his payments and probably other things (he didn&rsquo;t like to dwell on that too long), but at least they were respectful enough to recognise that he wanted privacy.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike <em>Tony goddamn Stark</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Were privacy and <em>basic fucking respect</em> difficult concepts for him?</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Is personal freedom a difficult concept for you?&rdquo; Tony barked back, glaring at him, &ldquo;You are aware that the <em>&lsquo;Captain&rsquo;</em> in your fucking title is barely honorary, you have next to no experience in this century, a preschooler has more experience. You have no right to tell me what to do in a <em>battle for our lives</em>-&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Steve&rsquo;s jaw clicked, his eyes hardened and he stepped forward, almost nose-to-nose with him. &ldquo;<em>You,</em>&rdquo; he seethed, almost growling, &ldquo;have done nothing but what you want, regardless of any consequences whatsoever, to yourself or to others. I give you commands for your safety, the team&rsquo;s safety and the civillian&rsquo;s safety and the defeat of <em>who-fucking-ever</em>, you disobeying that puts everyone at risk. We are a team, and as the person responsibl-&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;<em>But you aren&rsquo;t, Rogers!</em> You fucking aren&rsquo;t and you never will be. Just because you&rsquo;re the &lsquo;C.O&rsquo;and we&rsquo;re a &lsquo;team&rsquo;, don&rsquo;t think for a damn second we&rsquo;re ever going to be friends, the Avenegers aren&rsquo;t your fucking Howlies. Wake up already.&rdquo;</p> \n\n<p>Steve rolled his eyes, <em>God, he really thought he knew everything, huh</em>.</p> \n\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, <em>fuck off</em>, Stark, you think I don&rsquo;t know that? I honestly couldn&rsquo;t care less if you, Thor and Barton have a weekly orgy. But we have a duty to do-&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>This time, it was Tony who growled, &ldquo;Ah, right, the only reason you&rsquo;re even fucking here-&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p><em>&ldquo;Get. Out.&rdquo;</em></p> \n\n<p>He spoke through gritted teeth and in a low voice. &ldquo;Get the fuck out right now.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Tony swallowed, for the first time, in all the months he&rsquo;d known Steve, he was terrified of him, his brain unhelpfully supplied the numbers and stats from his Dad&rsquo;s Project: Rebirth files, about how much he could bench and throw and just how fast he could move.</p>\n\n<p>It was probably best if he left.</p> \n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Bucky carded a hand through Tony&rsquo;s hair, comforting him, knowing that he regretted all the words he said, despite how much he had believed it at the time. \n&ldquo;You were both assholes, still are, but at least you&rsquo;re friends and assholes.&rdquo; Tony snorted and tried to headbut Bucky, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re an asshole too. And I wanna be more than friends,&rdquo; he mumbled into his shirt, the last half barely audible.</p> \n\n<p>Bucky&rsquo;s hand kept moving in his hair, a constant, soothing, moving motion, &ldquo;I know, sugar, I know.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>They stayed in that position for a while, the sky melding from a pink-orange, the sun a semi-circle on the horizon to a dark blue, a crescent moon hanging in the sky, surrounded by stars they could barely see.\n</p>\n\n<hr /><p>Steve woke up when the moon was hanging high in the sky, a waxing crescent </p> \n<blockquote> <p> He turned his head to face Tony, &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p> \n\n<p>&ldquo;The moon, right now, about a quarter visible, just after the new moon.

No one save for Steve who races forward without much thought. </p><p>Bruised, shaking; but wide-eyed, is Tony and he stands there with his arm wrapped around his lower stomach.
