        "body": "<p>I do not really like this movie&hellip;. why?</p><p>because its the deterioration of Cap\u2019s character.</p><p>Like let&rsquo;s be real, in CA:FA Steve was this small enigma of righteousness, he took on the Captain America Schmick as a propaganda tool (hence the movies and etc) and truly is an American patriot.\u00a0 He works with the American Government (Shield at the time) as Steve rogers (a good man) and becomes a soldier. So he does in the water like the captain that he is. Losing it all for <i>AMERICA.</i></p><p>The amazing kickstarter to his arc is when he wakes up. This is emphasized in Avengers when he says: they say we won, they didnt say we lost.\u00a0</p><p>He saw how the future came out, he saw how people became after ww2. And he absolutely cant stand it. This is why he is such an ass in avengers, like not only does he lose everything for nothing, but he sees how the world is not the place wide-eyed steve had in mind. In Winter Soldier, he mentions how fury is using fear and ignoring security. He sees the injustice in the system. SO when his ideology comes to life and Hydra was infiltrated the entire time, his mindset changes even further from when he spoke to peggy. At this point, you notice how he starts to look less at the big picture and more so at the picture he has at hand. Personally, I think he does this so that he doesnt miss any details in what hes dealing with, much like how he didnt realize shield was hydra. This is why he disagrees to ultron, he doesnt know all the details as to why its needed (tony\u2019s vision, tonys ptsd to the wormhole etc) and he sees it as being too precautious, similar to hpw fury was with project insight. He refuses the accords because he doesnt know all the details, which is why in the lounge scene in CA:CW, he is the only one reading the accords. He has changed from the wide eyed patriot to the realistic soldier who fights for the people. Which is why I can agree with civil war up to the point where its revealed cap knew about tony\u2019s parents. YOURE telling ME that STEVE ROGERS did NOT TELL HIS BEST FRIEND ABKUT his PArentS?!\u00a0</p><p>I felt like it was so out of character for him, he spoke so grandly about truth and freedom in winter soldier, and was inspired by a truth speech made by Sharon, and yet keeps important information for TWO YEARS only for Tony to find out in the most idek how to describe it possible? that scene makes Steve\u00a0\u201cthe good man\u201d Rogers, the guy who wouldn\u2019t lift Mjolnir in AoU bc he didn&rsquo;t want his friend to lose Asgard over a drunken bet when hes the only sober guy, the dude that gains respect for Tony in Avengers when he risks it all, mirroring his past self, the guy that BASICALLY SUBMITS TO KILLING HIMSELF SO HE DOESNT HAVE TO KILL BUCKY WHEN IT ISNT HIM, turn into a disgusting, selfish monster in that one moment. And that&rsquo;s a stain he can never wash off.\u00a0</p><p>I would have much rather had Steve somehow confess to tony, that they actually communicated, and decided to find Bucky together under the radar. This would make Steve see how Tony is such an amazing friend who is by his side, and the guilt would just bubble up inside until he can&rsquo;t take it anymore. He confesses to tony and tony is just shocked and angry and there starts to be an argument.\u00a0</p><p>There&rsquo;s silence until they find bucky in Siberia (he gets there alone somehow) and Tony begins to grill him. THAT&rsquo;S when Zemo shows the tapes and brings tony over the edge. And I don&rsquo;t want it to seem like tony is the villain, the info is still fresh in his mind, he would go through so many emotions, asking himself if Rogers would have ever told him if he didn&rsquo;t need him, and distrusting the man in front of him (bucky). Also, imagine watching a tape where the man standing in front of you kills your parents in cold blood? do you think you would be able to shrug it off? I know I wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>So this change would make Steve stay in character, the good guy persona and Tony is not the bad guy, he&rsquo;s just human. And in the end, Steve still drops his shield but not because he betrayed his good nature of being steve rogers, but because he abandoned the meaning behind captain America (no longer blindly following governments and serving for nothing). Makes the bearded cap a lot more in line with the character, he\u2019s steve as the hero, not steve in the persona of America</p><p style=\"\">That is why I don&rsquo;t like this movie.</p>",

Also, imagine watching a tape where the man standing in front of you kills your parents in cold blood? do you think you would be able to shrug it off? I know I wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>So this change would make Steve stay in character, the good guy persona and Tony is not the bad guy, he\u2019s just human. And in the end, Steve still drops his shield but not because he betrayed his good nature of being steve rogers, but because he abandoned the meaning behind captain America (no longer blindly following governments and serving for nothing). Makes the bearded cap a lot more in line with the character, he\u2019s steve as the hero, not steve in the persona of America</p><p style=\"\">That is why I don\u2019t like this movie.</p>",
                "content": "<p>I do not really like this movie&hellip;. why?</p><p>because its the deterioration of Cap&rsquo;s character.</p><p>Like let&rsquo;s be real, in CA:FA Steve was this small enigma of righteousness, he took on the Captain America Schmick as a propaganda tool (hence the movies and etc) and truly is an American patriot.&nbsp; He works with the American Government (Shield at the time) as Steve rogers (a good man) and becomes a soldier. So he does in the water like the captain that he is. Losing it all for <i>AMERICA.</i></p><p>The amazing kickstarter to his arc is when he wakes up. This is emphasized in Avengers when he says: they say we won, they didnt say we lost.&nbsp;</p><p>He saw how the future came out, he saw how people became after ww2. And he absolutely cant stand it. This is why he is such an ass in avengers, like not only does he lose everything for nothing, but he sees how the world is not the place wide-eyed steve had in mind. In Winter Soldier, he mentions how fury is using fear and ignoring security. He sees the injustice in the system. SO when his ideology comes to life and Hydra was infiltrated the entire time, his mindset changes even further from when he spoke to peggy. At this point, you notice how he starts to look less at the big picture and more so at the picture he has at hand. Personally, I think he does this so that he doesnt miss any details in what hes dealing with, much like how he didnt realize shield was hydra. This is why he disagrees to ultron, he doesnt know all the details as to why its needed (tony&rsquo;s vision, tonys ptsd to the wormhole etc) and he sees it as being too precautious, similar to hpw fury was with project insight. He refuses the accords because he doesnt know all the details, which is why in the lounge scene in CA:CW, he is the only one reading the accords. He has changed from the wide eyed patriot to the realistic soldier who fights for the people. Which is why I can agree with civil war up to the point where its revealed cap knew about tony&rsquo;s parents. YOURE telling ME that STEVE ROGERS did NOT TELL HIS BEST FRIEND ABKUT his PArentS?!&nbsp;</p><p>I felt like it was so out of character for him, he spoke so grandly about truth and freedom in winter soldier, and was inspired by a truth speech made by Sharon, and yet keeps important information for TWO YEARS only for Tony to find out in the most idek how to describe it possible? that scene makes Steve&nbsp;&ldquo;the good man&rdquo; Rogers, the guy who wouldn&rsquo;t lift Mjolnir in AoU bc he didn&rsquo;t want his friend to lose Asgard over a drunken bet when hes the only sober guy, the dude that gains respect for Tony in Avengers when he risks it all, mirroring his past self, the guy that BASICALLY SUBMITS TO KILLING HIMSELF SO HE DOESNT HAVE TO KILL BUCKY WHEN IT ISNT HIM, turn into a disgusting, selfish monster in that one moment. And that&rsquo;s a stain he can never wash off.&nbsp;</p><p>I would have much rather had Steve somehow confess to tony, that they actually communicated, and decided to find Bucky together under the radar. This would make Steve see how Tony is such an amazing friend who is by his side, and the guilt would just bubble up inside until he can&rsquo;t take it anymore. He confesses to tony and tony is just shocked and angry and there starts to be an argument.&nbsp;</p><p>There&rsquo;s silence until they find bucky in Siberia (he gets there alone somehow) and Tony begins to grill him. THAT&rsquo;S when Zemo shows the tapes and brings tony over the edge. And I don&rsquo;t want it to seem like tony is the villain, the info is still fresh in his mind, he would go through so many emotions, asking himself if Rogers would have ever told him if he didn&rsquo;t need him, and distrusting the man in front of him (bucky). Also, imagine watching a tape where the man standing in front of you kills your parents in cold blood? do you think you would be able to shrug it off? I know I wouldn&rsquo;t.</p><p>So this change would make Steve stay in character, the good guy persona and Tony is not the bad guy, he&rsquo;s just human.

It had been a few days since Tegan been released from the hospital and was going to be coming to class. He had missed seeing her beautiful face in class. It wasn\u2019t the same as her seat was empty and then remembering what she had gone through.</p><p>It\u2019s not like he can talk to Chris or Daphne about Tegan. They were barely speaking to him as it is. After the whole thing at the hospital, they basically had shut him out. It\u2019s not like he didn\u2019t deserve it. Tegan wasn\u2019t his girlfriend after all but it didn\u2019t stop him from caring even though she was with Jay. Lord, he hated that smug asshole. With the better than thou attitude because he was a cop. It didn&rsquo;t matter what Jay&rsquo;s job was - what mattered was Tegan and her safety. </p><p>If only things were that simple for him but it wasn&rsquo;t when she was with another man. She wasn&rsquo;t with him. The smile on her face or how happy she was around Jay. Her face had just lit up around him. How could he take that away from her and just resent him? No, it was just best to move on and focus on himself. To get rid of the nasty habits and be healthy for once. Maybe fates would be kind to him and someone new would appear. </p><p>Watching as Chris entered his office, they both looked at each other. Chris had dropped his stuff off and left just as quickly. Sebastian needed to talk it out but now wasn&rsquo;t the best time. The class was about to start and needed to head that way. Grabbing his stuff, Sebastian walked out of the office. Several of the female students just smiled towards him and give him those doey eyes they all loved to give him. </p><p>Turning the corner, Sebastian came to a dead stop as his attention focused outside - right in front of him. Seeing the one thing he didn&rsquo;t want to see at all. Just once, he wished things would be in his favor. Who was he kidding? That probably would never happen. All he could do was just watch as sadness took over. </p><!-- more --><hr><p>&ldquo;Tegan sweetie, you don&rsquo;t have to go back to school this week. I am sure we can talk to Professor Stan and get your assignments. You need to rest.&rdquo; Daphne said watching her cousin got ready for school. Tegan had officially moved in with Daphne and Chris now. Jay had gone back to her old apartment to get the few essentials but had yet to remove the rest of her stuff out of there. </p><p>Honestly, Jay didn&rsquo;t want Tegan to go back there to get her stuff as it might trigger something. So the plan was for Jay and Chris to get her stuff later. Of course, Jay wanted Tegan to stay with him but right now, it was best she stay with here. It wasn&rsquo;t like Jay&rsquo;s apartment was far away from Daphne&rsquo;s house. It was at least 20 minutes away and pretty easy to get too. It was actually closer to the district than his apartment. </p><p>Tegan put the finishing touches on her makeup and looked up at her cousin, &ldquo;I know Daph, but if I don&rsquo;t get out this house I am going to go stir crazy. There is only so much TV I tolerate.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I know sweetie, but you have only been out of the hospital for a week. Dr. Rhodes did say to take it easy.&rdquo; Just then the doorbell rang and Daphne saw the immediate smile on Tegan&rsquo;s face.<i> &ldquo;No one ever listens to me&rdquo;</i> Daphne muttered walking down the stairs to answer the door.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Jay, how are you?&rdquo; Daphne asked as Jay walked into the house. Jay looked up towards the stairs and saw Tegan was wearing a pair of leggings and green plaid shirt along with her combats boots and his leather jacket. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, beautiful,&rdquo; Jay smirked walking up the stairs. Lord was she beautiful as the blush in her cheeks could be seen. That instant smile on her face the moment they looked at each other. How the hell did she have this effect on him so much?</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, I am going to go over here. Have a good day at school. Be safe.&rdquo; Daphne just shook her head and walked away. Oh, those two were at the point of being sickeningly annoying but it didn&rsquo;t matter. As long as Tegan was happy, that&rsquo;s all that mattered to her. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, there handsome.&rdquo; Tegan cupped his face and felt as Jay&rsquo;s face just rested in her hands. His eyes were closed and nuzzled against her hand. &ldquo;You alright?&rdquo; </p><p>Jay opened his eyes and stepped up towards the next step. His eyes looked deep into hers and cupped her face as well. His lips slowly started to massage hers as his tongue advanced inward. His arms rested around her waist, holding her steady against him. Their tongues working together as the kiss became intense. The small moan that escaped her lips caused Jay to get turned on just a bit. Those sweet sounds that came out of her mouth were something he loved to hear. Both of them slowly pulled away as there heads rest against one another.</p><p>&ldquo;I am glad that you are safe and here with me baby. I promise I will always keep you safe, no matter what. I am sorry I couldn&rsquo;t be there to protect you.&rdquo; Tegan lifted his chin up to meet her eyes seeing the sadness in his eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;You know I don&rsquo;t blame you or anything Jay. We didn&rsquo;t know it was going to happen. You got the son of a bitch and he&rsquo;s in jail. That&rsquo;s all that matters. You are right here with me and I couldn&rsquo;t be happier. How about tonight, we spend the night watching movies - just the two of us.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I would love that baby. Remember, I still owe you a Halstead dinner and whatever you want to do.&rdquo; Jay smirked as their hands linked in with one another. </p><p>&ldquo;Well, if you don&rsquo;t have a case this weekend, then how about Friday? Your place?&rdquo; Tegan smirked as Jay gave her that dashing smile. The one she loved so much. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a date, my love.&rdquo; Jay lifting up Tegan bridal style causing her to giggle and smile. Her arms linked around his neck and kissed Jay&rsquo;s neck. There was a small moan escape his lips as Tegan&rsquo;s lips went towards his ear. Oh, how she loved the sounds he made when they kissed. It literally brought Tegan to her knees. </p><p>&ldquo;You are amazing Jay Halstead,&rdquo; She whispered into his ear as they got close to the truck. He was about to set her down but instead lightly spun her around causing her to giggle. Placing her back down, they just looked at each other. </p><p>&ldquo;Not as much as you. You are the light I need in my life.&rdquo; Jay looked deep into her eyes and could feel Tegan run her fingers through his hair. His eyes closed enjoying every touch as it went down towards his arms. It was something that he was never going to let go. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get you to class baby, I don&rsquo;t want you to be late.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, we definitely don&rsquo;t want that,&rdquo; Tegan smirked as Jay helped her into the truck. Placing the crutches beside her and closed the door, Jay walked over towards the other side. Tegan looked up and saw the picture of them was on his dash. A huge smile crossed her face as they headed off to her school. There was no one she would rather be with than Jay Halstead. </p><hr><p>Jay had parked the truck on the side and went to help Tegan out of the truck. As Tegan exited the truck, she could see Travis was standing in there normal spot with 2 coffees and muffins in hand. Grabbing her backpack, Jay walked with her towards Travis. </p><p>&ldquo;Well, well, look who has decided to grace me with her presence. It&rsquo;s been a horrible two weeks without you!&rdquo; Travis smirked watching the two of them. They were both so in sync with one another it wasn&rsquo;t even funny. The happiness was written all over there faces. </p><p>&ldquo;Lord help me with you two. I need to find someone at this rate.&rdquo; Travis groaned watched as Jay kissed her head. </p><p>&ldquo;How about we go find someone for you?&rdquo; Tegan suggested looking amongst her best friend. Deep down, she knew that Travis had a thing for her brother. If only those two would get together. Time would only tell if that happened. </p><p>&ldquo;Um T, no thanks. I got someone in mind.&rdquo; Travis just rolled his eyes and heard the bell start to ring from the tower across signifying that it was time to go. The class was about to start in 10 minutes and didn&rsquo;t want to get on Professor Stan&rsquo;s bad side. &ldquo;We should get going, T. We don&rsquo;t want to be late.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Go inside and save me a seat. I will be right there.&rdquo; Tegan suggested as Travis nodded and headed inside. &ldquo;You got the key?&rdquo; Her attention turning towards Jay.</p><p>&ldquo;Yup, anything particular you want me to keep or just the basics,&rdquo; Jay asked as they held hands with each other.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I made a list.&rdquo; Tegan pulled the list out of her backpack and handed it to Jay. &ldquo;All the furniture and bedsheets can go. It&rsquo;s pretty much everything on this list and everything else can go. It&rsquo;s old and not really needed.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Okay, so everything on this list?&rdquo; Jay placed the list in his pocket then wrapped his arms around her waist. He could see that she was swaying a bit so he held onto her tightly. Honestly, he would find any excuse to hold her close to him. Placing a kiss on her forehead, Tegan&rsquo;s hands went right back into his hair as her fingers ran through it. </p><p>Jay lowered his lips and went straight back to those glorious lips. They slowly massaged each other again and feeling her into him. There tongues dancing against one another as he deepened the kiss. There was that same moan from a bit ago driving him completely utterly nuts. Tegan lightly pulled away and looked deep into his eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;I could spend hours just kissing you,&rdquo; Jay whispered, trying to regain some sort of composure since they were out in public but it was almost impossible. There was just something about her that was impossible to resist. </p><p>&ldquo;How about tonight as well. I need to go, baby. If you have any questions, just text me. I will see you later?&rdquo; \u00a0Tegan gave a small smile looking up at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course. I will pick you up after we get done, okay?&rdquo; Tegan took her backpack and gave Jay one last passionate kiss before she walked away leaving him breathless. Her own lips were now on fire just from the simple contact. Opening the door, she headed to class with a huge smile on her face.</p><hr><p>Sebastian did everything he could to remain calm. He couldn&rsquo;t hold this against Tegan at all. Being mean and nasty to her wasn&rsquo;t going to help his case by any means. At that moment, Sebastian realized that he wasn&rsquo;t going to give up that easy. All the back and forth within his brain had finally settled on an answer. He was going to do his best to sweep Tegan off her feet despite her being with Jay. Sebastian was going to steal Tegan for himself. Prove to her that he was the better guy and give her what she needed. Now that she was going to be living with Chris, it would be a lot easier to see her on a daily basis. The only thing he had to do was fix things. </p><p>Heading towards the class, Sebastian entered and saw some of the students were already seated. Assignments were already on his desk and placed his stuff on the chair. His attention turned around to face the class and saw Tegan had now entered the class. Both their eyes focused on one another and could feel his heart start to race as he looked at her. Watching her every moment as she didn&rsquo;t take her normal seat in the middle. It was right next to the stairs with Travis right beside her. </p><p>Tegan walked into the classroom and felt someone&rsquo;s eyes on her. She wasn&rsquo;t sure until she looked forward as Sebastian&rsquo;s eyes were focused watching her. That&rsquo;s when she felt butterflies appear and heart racing a million miles. How could this even be happening when she despised Sebastian? He was everything that didn&rsquo;t want in a man. Jay was everything she wanted. Right? Pushing those feelings deep down inside, Tegan took her seat and pulled out her laptop. </p><p>&ldquo;Was it just me or was the Professor completely focused on you?&rdquo; Travis whispered causing Tegan to give him a glare. With that Travis closed his mouth and then it hit him. The professor did have feelings for her. The whole conversation between Chris, Daphne and him when Tegan was in the hospital. It all made sense now. </p><p>He had heard the whole thing from outside. He just hoped that Sebastian wasn&rsquo;t going to do something stupid or worse - ruin her relationship with Jay. He wasn&rsquo;t going to let that happen at all. </p><p>&ldquo;Alright class, we are going to do something a little different from the lesson plan. I take it most of you have turned in your assignments. This next assignment will be a group essay with two or more people&rdquo; He could hear some students groaned and some were cheering as he proceeded, &ldquo;You can choose who you want and will be due next Wednesday, so you have two weeks to complete it. With a show of hands, how many of you have seen Gone with the Wind?&rdquo; Sebastian watched as about half the class did and the rest didn&rsquo;t. He saw both Tegan and Travis&rsquo; hand both go up. A small smile was placed on Tegan&rsquo;s face causing him to give a smile towards her. </p><p>&ldquo;Alright, we are going to be watching the movie but doing the assignment a little bit differently. I want you to write an essay and a partial play regarding the movie. But don&rsquo;t focus on the movie this time and era, I want you to focus the movie on today and now. How is it different from today&rsquo;s society, how is it the same, etc.. Each group will come up here, explain their findings and perform it. Now if you want more than two people be my guest, but each person will have to play a part. Understand?&rdquo; Sebastian could see some confused faces amongst several faces. &ldquo;I know it might sound confusing but how about we watch the movie and save questions for after. It is a four-hour movie, so if you need to go to the bathroom or anything during the movie, please do so. But please remember it&rsquo;s your responsibility to come back and make sure you do the work.&rdquo; </p><p>Most of the class nodded in agreement and settled in for the movie. Sebastian turned on the DVD player and turned off the lights. The movie started and his eyes focused upon Tegan who was smiling completely from ear to ear. The smile he loved to see so much. Grabbing his bag, Sebastian made his way up the stairs and took a seat behind Tegan and Travis. The smell of her perfume filled his nose as he took the seat. Closing his eyes, Sebastian settled into the seat and watched the movie. Secretly thinking it was the two of them. </p><hr><p>The moment Jay walked into the apartment, it felt like a knife to his gut. The police tape was still on the apartment door and it was freezing as ever. The dried blood remained in its spot as well. The bear he had gotten her still remained on the bed. Picking it up off the bed, he held onto it close. Her sweet smell lingered on the stuffed animal. It was her scent and it always lingered on everything he had owned. Even his detective badge. </p><p>He had thrown most of the stuff away in her apartment. At least the things Tegan had wanted to go. Old plastic Tupperware and utensils, the gross food that was now expired and the old bedsheets. He wasn&rsquo;t going to worry about the furniture. That was the owner&rsquo;s problem. Not like it even mattered as most of the tenants left the apartment and the owner was now facing serious charges against him. </p><p>Jay had already tackled the closet with most of the stuff packed up. Her clothes that were hanging were placed in boxes. By that time, Chris had already arrived and started loading the boxes in both cars. Looking at his watch, Tegan would be getting out of class soon and wanted to make sure it was all packed up before she got out of class. </p><p>Chris looked down on the ground and saw the dried blood that was on the floor. His heart immediately broke just looking at it. Not to mention the condition of the apartment in general. How in the hell did her aunt let Tegan live like this? No heat or AC - it was freezing in the apartment. He would be damned if Tegan would come back here. </p><p>&ldquo;I am just thankful Tegan has a better place to stay with both of you. I never liked this place.&rdquo; Jay said placing some of Tegan&rsquo;s stuff in boxes. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not easy looking at her blood on the ground.&rdquo; Chris could hear the sadness in his voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Jay, for getting the son of a bitch and for protecting her. She really likes you a lot.&rdquo; Chris gave a reassuring smile as he taped one of the boxes.</p><p>&ldquo;Can I ask you something, Chris?&rdquo; Chris nodded in agreement and Jay progressed with the question. &ldquo;Sebastian is a friend of yours, correct?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am sorry about that. I don&rsquo;t even know why he was acting that way. Trust me, it won&rsquo;t happen again.&rdquo; Chris was quick to correct the actions that Sebastian had caused at the hospital. This wasn&rsquo;t the kind of drama that never should have been started. </p><p>&ldquo;I just want to know if he is going to be a problem. I really like Tegan and want to be with her. If he is, I will be damned if he gets in the way of my relationship with her. I plan on being in Tegan&rsquo;s life for as long as she wants me.&rdquo; Jay stopped and turned towards Chris. </p><p>&ldquo;Trust me, I WILL be damned if Sebastian gets in the way. I haven&rsquo;t even spoken to him since it happened. I am not exactly happy with him as well but I will talk to him. Don&rsquo;t worry. Just focus on Tegan.&rdquo; Chris really needs to speak with Sebastian and figure out what was going on.</p><p>&ldquo;If things get out of hand, I will file charges for harassment and a restraining order. I don&rsquo;t care if he is your best friend. I will do whatever it takes to keep her safe.&rdquo; Jay said placing another box on the floor. Most of everything was packed up with the exception of the bathroom.</p><p>&ldquo;Trust me, that will never happen again, you have my word.&rdquo; Chris looked over at Jay and both nodded in agreement. &ldquo;Does Tegan want any of the furniture?&rdquo; Quickly changing the subject.</p><p>&ldquo;No, just the clothes, the stuff in the bathroom and closet. Everything else can pretty much be left here. It doesn&rsquo;t even matter. The owner is in facing criminal charges and this place has been marked condemned.&rdquo; Jay explained grabbing some stuff from Tegan&rsquo;s side table. There were several pictures and one popped out to him. It was Tegan when she was younger, Daphne and another male. Chris had walked over as he went towards the bathroom.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Tegan&rsquo;s older brother Logan. I think that picture was right around when Tegan&rsquo;s parents passed away. It was a rough time for all three of them and the only thing holding them together was Daphne. Here&rsquo;s a picture of her parents&rdquo; Chris pulled out the picture as it was the next picture on the pile. Jay took the picture and his heart immediately dropped looking at the picture. Tegan was so young when she lost her parents. He could see the striking resemblance between Tegan and her mother. The exact same smile and light behind her eyes. </p><p>Placing the picture in the box, he focused on getting the rest of the stuff together. Chris went into the bathroom and quickly packed it up. Placing the bear on top of the stuff, Jay taped the box up. Looking around the room, all of Tegan&rsquo;s stuff had been packed up. There wasn&rsquo;t much left in the way of her room anyways. </p><p>&ldquo;Alright, I got everything out of the bathroom. We should load the rest of this stuff up and get out of here. It&rsquo;s freezing and honestly, I cannot look at that spot anymore.&rdquo; Chris said looking down at the dried blood splatter.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, let&rsquo;s get out of here. I am gonna need to pick up Tegan soon. Not to mention, I am getting hungry.&rdquo; Jay could hear his stomach start to growl causing Chris to laugh as well.</p><p>&ldquo;How about before we load this stuff in the house, we get some lunch and then tackle this. You are staying for dinner right? I know Daphne is making something tasty.&rdquo; Chris picked up some of the boxes and made his way towards the door.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course. I can always go for tasty food.&rdquo; Jay laughed picking up several boxes alongside Chris. &ldquo;Daphne is an amazing cook by the way.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You think Daphne&rsquo;s good, it doesn&rsquo;t compare to Tegan&rsquo;s cooking. To be honest and don&rsquo;t tell Daphne because she would kill me but Tegan is way better at cooking. I think it&rsquo;s one of the reasons why I am glad she&rsquo;s with us. She makes a mean brownie cheesecake and Chicken Piccata.&rdquo; Chris laughed as they made there way down the stairs.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, it&rsquo;s our little secret. It&rsquo;s something I definitely will looking forward too&rdquo; Giving each other a high five, they made there way back upstairs to finish the job. Within 20 minutes, the rest of the stuff was packed up and on there way. Jay couldn&rsquo;t help by smile realizing that the rest of the day would be spent with Tegan. Just holding and cuddling her in his arms. He would have to thank Hank for giving him an extra week. It was definitely what he needed. What they both needed. </p><hr><p>As the movie played, some of the students look bored with the movie. Maybe because it wasn\u2019t some action story or a superhero movie. But Sebastian&rsquo;s focus was on Tegan as the movie played. Her head was on Travis&rsquo; shoulder as they leaned back in the seats. He could hear them whispering but wasn&rsquo;t sure about what. </p><p>Looking at his watch, the movie and class itself were almost over with. About half the class had already left the room and the rest was watching the movie. Just like that, the credits play causing him to get out of his seat.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright class, since we are way past the allotted time, next class we will cover any questions anyone has or you can come to my office. If you haven&rsquo;t turned in your assignment, please do so now. If not, it will be considered late and not be counted. Miss. Mitchell, please stay behind.&rdquo; Sebastian&rsquo;s eyes focus on Tegan could see a small blush hit her cheeks. With that, most of the class gathered their stuff and headed out the door.</p><p>&ldquo;Wonder what&rsquo;s the about?&rdquo; Travis whispered causing Tegan to shrug. &ldquo;Want me to help you down there?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, my leg is killing me right now and don&rsquo;t know if I will be able to walk down and back up the stairs.&rdquo; Tegan watched as Sebastian started gathering his stuff as well. By this time, all of the class had left the room just leaving Travis, Sebastian, and Tegan. Travis helped Tegan up and started the slow process down the stairs.</p><p>&ldquo;Tegan, stay there. I will meet you up there. I don&rsquo;t want you injuring yourself more. Lord knows, your cousin will kill me.&rdquo; Sebastian flashed that pretty boy smile causing Tegan to get flushed just a bit.<i>&ldquo;Stop it!&rdquo; </i>Trying to tell herself. It wasn&rsquo;t like he was completely attracted to her. </p><p>Just then, Tegan&rsquo;s felt like jello and landed back in the seat. She could see the concern on Travis&rsquo; face as well as Sebastian as he walked up the stairs. &ldquo;You alright, T,&rdquo; Travis asked watching her closely.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, just slightly in pain.&rdquo; Tegan looked up at Sebastian and her heart raced even more as his blue eyes watched her every move. </p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t keep you long, I just wanted to see how you were doing? I can give you some extra time if you haven&rsquo;t completed the assignments?&rdquo; Sebastian watched Tegan smile towards him as it left him weak in the knees. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh no, I finished the assignments, last night Professor.&rdquo; Tegan opened her bag to retrieve the three essays that had been completed. She looked up and handed them to him. The moment their hands touched, a simple spark shot through them. Tegan immediately retrieved her hand back the moment Sebastian took the essays unsure if he felt it as well. &ldquo;I was going to have Travis turn them at the end. Just couldn&rsquo;t really make it down there.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it. I don&rsquo;t want to keep you any longer than you have to. Just don&rsquo;t overdo it alright and take care of yourself.&rdquo; With that Sebastian quickly walked out of the class, stuffing his hand in his jacket. A small tingle radiating through his hand up towards the arm. </p><p><i>&ldquo;Had she felt that as well?&rdquo; </i>Sebastian wondered walking back to his office. </p><hr><p>Tegan just watched as Sebastian left the room wondering what just happened. The look on Travis&rsquo; face said everything as Tegan looked up at him. &ldquo;What was that T?&rdquo; Travis asked as he helped her up.</p><p>&ldquo;No fucking clue but whatever it was, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. There is no way I could ever fall for Sebastian.&rdquo; Just than Tegan heard her phone go off and saw it was a message from Jay saying he was there. &ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s get out of here.&rdquo; Both of them left the classroom with Tegan unsure of what the hell had just happened.</p><hr><p>&ldquo;Dinner smells amazing Daphne.&rdquo; Jay smiled as they had unloaded the rest of the boxes. The most essential items went up towards Tegan&rsquo;s room and the rest had gone in the garage. Tegan was sprawled out on the couch watching some crime TV show - Criminal Minds. </p><p>&ldquo;Thank you. Why don&rsquo;t both of you go get cleaned up cause dinner is almost ready.&rdquo; Daphne watched as the boys placed the remaining boxes down. &ldquo;Tegan! Dinner.&rdquo; </p><p><i>&ldquo;One moment.&rdquo;</i> Tegan&rsquo;s voice shouted from the other room.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, hunnie, why don&rsquo;t we let those two eat dinner in peace,&rdquo; Chris whispered in his girl&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s give them some alone time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nevermind T.&rdquo; Just than Tegan groaned from the other room shouting <i>&ldquo;really?&rdquo; </i>causing both of them to laugh. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey Jay, we are going to eat in the other room and give both of you some time together. \u00a0Would you mind bringing this to Tegan?&rdquo; Daphne said handing two plates of food to Jay. It was Salmon with mixed vegetables and mashed potatoes.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course. Thank you.&rdquo; Jay smiled as he took the plates and walked over to where Tegan was sitting. His eyes focused on her placing the two plates on the small table in front of them. She was completely lost in the show. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey baby, what would you like to drink?&rdquo; Tegan sat up just a bit and went to stand up but sat right back down. &ldquo;Hey, easy love&rdquo; Tegan took Jay&rsquo;s hands into hers and met his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;What if I say you, would that count,&rdquo; Tegan smirked looking at Jay&rsquo;s reaction causing him to laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;It does my love, but I mean for dinner.&rdquo; Jay bent down and kissed Tegan on the lips. He cupped her chin to pull it closer to him as it captured her lips to his. Jay&rsquo;s tongue slowly massaging hers deepening the kiss. Slowly breaking the kiss, a small smile crept on Jay&rsquo;s face seeing the blush in Tegan&rsquo;s cheeks.</p><p>&ldquo;Water&rdquo; was all the Tegan managed to get out. &ldquo;You got it, babe.&rdquo; With that Jay left the room and returned quickly with drinks in hand. Jay handed her the plate and took his plate. Both of them relaxed on the couch and ate dinner in comforting silence.</p><hr><p>Jay looked down at Tegan who was in-between his legs, curled up on her side. Placing a kiss on her forehead, he watched as her eyes struggled to stay open. The pain medication was starting to take its effect in helping relieve the pain in her leg. One his hands laced in with her fingers as the other hand started to rub her back lightly helping send her to sleep. His own eyes slowly started to close at the feeling of Tegan in his arms. </p><p>&ldquo;Would either of you&hellip;&quot;Daphne walked into the room and stopped when she saw both of them asleep on the couch. Just then the doorbell rang with Chris walking in the room to answer it. Daphne grabbed the blanket off the couch and draped it over them. Opening the door, Chris looked in surprise as who was on the opposite side. </p><p><b>It was Sebastian&hellip;</b></p><p><b>Do You See Me Taglist: \u00a0</b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mW5ssh_HpQSSs4kyjRhe9vA\">@hehurst23</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgSQ8RXPV_K5CBpeHj6cPsw\">@fangirlfiction</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPeJwFWMRmS8pvLzN_lQAWA\">@writing-in-the-impala</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mK5sYAuxIuAF6WSSFLdXNhw\">@emercat</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mARSIftlXw_99S9YvPIZ3MQ\">@cootie06</a>\u200b // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muqRvbe0mEj95uNt_yVzXuw\">@kyber-hearts-and-stardust-souls</a>\u200b // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTrt1frH3lYtqeYiaqMLhiA\">@lovejessejay</a>\u200b // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM3UeVBrk2zdM_9tQRO8Cog\">@canumoveurseatup-no</a>\u200b // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrg5dyIjtxkXJkfauPnLA6w\">@all1e23</a>\u200b // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3oVXVm_CJfrBWJsvf7wX4Q\">@buckmesideways22</a>\u200b // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEc2i1VDavwHiG3zjhY58fw\">@moonriv-er</a>\u200b // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDBZ6G6dGwaeFSodTIVmV-A\">@cap-evanns</a>\u200b // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mklkZ0WDDCgHBRbTDgg_EfA\">@cmorgana</a>\u200b // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mA4_8wswWZ_qSkEMMQ_5V0w\">@givebuckyhisplum</a>\u200b </p>",

Seeing the one thing he didn\u2019t want to see at all. Just once, he wished things would be in his favor. Who was he kidding? That probably would never happen. All he could do was just watch as sadness took over. </p>[[MORE]]<hr><p>\u201cTegan sweetie, you don\u2019t have to go back to school this week. I am sure we can talk to Professor Stan and get your assignments. You need to rest.\u201d Daphne said watching her cousin got ready for school. Tegan had officially moved in with Daphne and Chris now. Jay had gone back to her old apartment to get the few essentials but had yet to remove the rest of her stuff out of there. </p><p>Honestly, Jay didn\u2019t want Tegan to go back there to get her stuff as it might trigger something. So the plan was for Jay and Chris to get her stuff later. Of course, Jay wanted Tegan to stay with him but right now, it was best she stay with here. It wasn\u2019t like Jay\u2019s apartment was far away from Daphne\u2019s house. It was at least 20 minutes away and pretty easy to get too. It was actually closer to the district than his apartment. </p><p>Tegan put the finishing touches on her makeup and looked up at her cousin, \u201cI know Daph, but if I don\u2019t get out this house I am going to go stir crazy. There is only so much TV I tolerate.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know sweetie, but you have only been out of the hospital for a week. Dr. Rhodes did say to take it easy.\u201d Just then the doorbell rang and Daphne saw the immediate smile on Tegan\u2019s face.<i> \u201cNo one ever listens to me\u201d</i> Daphne muttered walking down the stairs to answer the door.</p><p>\u201cHey Jay, how are you?\u201d Daphne asked as Jay walked into the house. Jay looked up towards the stairs and saw Tegan was wearing a pair of leggings and green plaid shirt along with her combats boots and his leather jacket. </p><p>\u201cHey, beautiful,\u201d Jay smirked walking up the stairs. Lord was she beautiful as the blush in her cheeks could be seen. That instant smile on her face the moment they looked at each other. How the hell did she have this effect on him so much?</p><p>\u201cAlright, I am going to go over here. Have a good day at school. Be safe.\u201d Daphne just shook her head and walked away. Oh, those two were at the point of being sickeningly annoying but it didn\u2019t matter. As long as Tegan was happy, that\u2019s all that mattered to her. </p><p>\u201cHey, there handsome.\u201d Tegan cupped his face and felt as Jay\u2019s face just rested in her hands. His eyes were closed and nuzzled against her hand. \u201cYou alright?\u201d </p><p>Jay opened his eyes and stepped up towards the next step. His eyes looked deep into hers and cupped her face as well. His lips slowly started to massage hers as his tongue advanced inward. His arms rested around her waist, holding her steady against him. Their tongues working together as the kiss became intense. The small moan that escaped her lips caused Jay to get turned on just a bit. Those sweet sounds that came out of her mouth were something he loved to hear. Both of them slowly pulled away as there heads rest against one another.</p><p>\u201cI am glad that you are safe and here with me baby. I promise I will always keep you safe, no matter what. I am sorry I couldn\u2019t be there to protect you.\u201d Tegan lifted his chin up to meet her eyes seeing the sadness in his eyes. </p><p>\u201cYou know I don\u2019t blame you or anything Jay. We didn\u2019t know it was going to happen. You got the son of a bitch and he\u2019s in jail. That\u2019s all that matters. You are right here with me and I couldn\u2019t be happier. How about tonight, we spend the night watching movies - just the two of us.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI would love that baby. Remember, I still owe you a Halstead dinner and whatever you want to do.\u201d Jay smirked as their hands linked in with one another. </p><p>\u201cWell, if you don\u2019t have a case this weekend, then how about Friday? Your place?\u201d Tegan smirked as Jay gave her that dashing smile. The one she loved so much. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a date, my love.\u201d Jay lifting up Tegan bridal style causing her to giggle and smile. Her arms linked around his neck and kissed Jay\u2019s neck. There was a small moan escape his lips as Tegan\u2019s lips went towards his ear. Oh, how she loved the sounds he made when they kissed. It literally brought Tegan to her knees. </p><p>\u201cYou are amazing Jay Halstead,\u201d She whispered into his ear as they got close to the truck. He was about to set her down but instead lightly spun her around causing her to giggle. Placing her back down, they just looked at each other. </p><p>\u201cNot as much as you. You are the light I need in my life.\u201d Jay looked deep into her eyes and could feel Tegan run her fingers through his hair. His eyes closed enjoying every touch as it went down towards his arms. It was something that he was never going to let go. \u201cLet\u2019s get you to class baby, I don\u2019t want you to be late.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh, we definitely don\u2019t want that,\u201d Tegan smirked as Jay helped her into the truck. Placing the crutches beside her and closed the door, Jay walked over towards the other side. Tegan looked up and saw the picture of them was on his dash. A huge smile crossed her face as they headed off to her school. There was no one she would rather be with than Jay Halstead. </p><hr><p>Jay had parked the truck on the side and went to help Tegan out of the truck. As Tegan exited the truck, she could see Travis was standing in there normal spot with 2 coffees and muffins in hand. Grabbing her backpack, Jay walked with her towards Travis. </p><p>\u201cWell, well, look who has decided to grace me with her presence. It\u2019s been a horrible two weeks without you!\u201d Travis smirked watching the two of them. They were both so in sync with one another it wasn\u2019t even funny. The happiness was written all over there faces. </p><p>\u201cLord help me with you two. I need to find someone at this rate.\u201d Travis groaned watched as Jay kissed her head. </p><p>\u201cHow about we go find someone for you?\u201d Tegan suggested looking amongst her best friend. Deep down, she knew that Travis had a thing for her brother. If only those two would get together. Time would only tell if that happened. </p><p>\u201cUm T, no thanks. I got someone in mind.\u201d Travis just rolled his eyes and heard the bell start to ring from the tower across signifying that it was time to go. The class was about to start in 10 minutes and didn\u2019t want to get on Professor Stan\u2019s bad side. \u201cWe should get going, T. We don\u2019t want to be late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo inside and save me a seat. I will be right there.\u201d Tegan suggested as Travis nodded and headed inside. \u201cYou got the key?\u201d Her attention turning towards Jay.</p><p>\u201cYup, anything particular you want me to keep or just the basics,\u201d Jay asked as they held hands with each other.</p><p>\u201cOh, I made a list.\u201d Tegan pulled the list out of her backpack and handed it to Jay. \u201cAll the furniture and bedsheets can go. It\u2019s pretty much everything on this list and everything else can go. It\u2019s old and not really needed.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay, so everything on this list?\u201d Jay placed the list in his pocket then wrapped his arms around her waist. He could see that she was swaying a bit so he held onto her tightly. Honestly, he would find any excuse to hold her close to him. Placing a kiss on her forehead, Tegan\u2019s hands went right back into his hair as her fingers ran through it. </p><p>Jay lowered his lips and went straight back to those glorious lips. They slowly massaged each other again and feeling her into him. There tongues dancing against one another as he deepened the kiss. There was that same moan from a bit ago driving him completely utterly nuts. Tegan lightly pulled away and looked deep into his eyes. </p><p>\u201cI could spend hours just kissing you,\u201d Jay whispered, trying to regain some sort of composure since they were out in public but it was almost impossible. There was just something about her that was impossible to resist. </p><p>\u201cHow about tonight as well. I need to go, baby. If you have any questions, just text me. I will see you later?\u201d \u00a0Tegan gave a small smile looking up at him.</p><p>\u201cOf course. I will pick you up after we get done, okay?\u201d Tegan took her backpack and gave Jay one last passionate kiss before she walked away leaving him breathless. Her own lips were now on fire just from the simple contact. Opening the door, she headed to class with a huge smile on her face.</p><hr><p>Sebastian did everything he could to remain calm. He couldn\u2019t hold this against Tegan at all. Being mean and nasty to her wasn\u2019t going to help his case by any means. At that moment, Sebastian realized that he wasn\u2019t going to give up that easy. All the back and forth within his brain had finally settled on an answer. He was going to do his best to sweep Tegan off her feet despite her being with Jay. Sebastian was going to steal Tegan for himself. Prove to her that he was the better guy and give her what she needed. Now that she was going to be living with Chris, it would be a lot easier to see her on a daily basis. The only thing he had to do was fix things. </p><p>Heading towards the class, Sebastian entered and saw some of the students were already seated. Assignments were already on his desk and placed his stuff on the chair. His attention turned around to face the class and saw Tegan had now entered the class. Both their eyes focused on one another and could feel his heart start to race as he looked at her. Watching her every moment as she didn\u2019t take her normal seat in the middle. It was right next to the stairs with Travis right beside her. </p><p>Tegan walked into the classroom and felt someone\u2019s eyes on her. She wasn\u2019t sure until she looked forward as Sebastian\u2019s eyes were focused watching her. That\u2019s when she felt butterflies appear and heart racing a million miles. How could this even be happening when she despised Sebastian? He was everything that didn\u2019t want in a man. Jay was everything she wanted. Right? Pushing those feelings deep down inside, Tegan took her seat and pulled out her laptop. </p><p>\u201cWas it just me or was the Professor completely focused on you?\u201d Travis whispered causing Tegan to give him a glare. With that Travis closed his mouth and then it hit him. The professor did have feelings for her. The whole conversation between Chris, Daphne and him when Tegan was in the hospital. It all made sense now. </p><p>He had heard the whole thing from outside. He just hoped that Sebastian wasn\u2019t going to do something stupid or worse - ruin her relationship with Jay. He wasn\u2019t going to let that happen at all. </p><p>\u201cAlright class, we are going to do something a little different from the lesson plan. I take it most of you have turned in your assignments. This next assignment will be a group essay with two or more people\u201d He could hear some students groaned and some were cheering as he proceeded, \u201cYou can choose who you want and will be due next Wednesday, so you have two weeks to complete it. With a show of hands, how many of you have seen Gone with the Wind?\u201d Sebastian watched as about half the class did and the rest didn\u2019t. He saw both Tegan and Travis\u2019 hand both go up. A small smile was placed on Tegan\u2019s face causing him to give a smile towards her. </p><p>\u201cAlright, we are going to be watching the movie but doing the assignment a little bit differently. I want you to write an essay and a partial play regarding the movie. But don\u2019t focus on the movie this time and era, I want you to focus the movie on today and now. How is it different from today\u2019s society, how is it the same, etc.. Each group will come up here, explain their findings and perform it. Now if you want more than two people be my guest, but each person will have to play a part. Understand?\u201d Sebastian could see some confused faces amongst several faces. \u201cI know it might sound confusing but how about we watch the movie and save questions for after. It is a four-hour movie, so if you need to go to the bathroom or anything during the movie, please do so. But please remember it\u2019s your responsibility to come back and make sure you do the work.\u201d </p><p>Most of the class nodded in agreement and settled in for the movie. Sebastian turned on the DVD player and turned off the lights. The movie started and his eyes focused upon Tegan who was smiling completely from ear to ear. The smile he loved to see so much. Grabbing his bag, Sebastian made his way up the stairs and took a seat behind Tegan and Travis. The smell of her perfume filled his nose as he took the seat. Closing his eyes, Sebastian settled into the seat and watched the movie. Secretly thinking it was the two of them. </p><hr><p>The moment Jay walked into the apartment, it felt like a knife to his gut. The police tape was still on the apartment door and it was freezing as ever. The dried blood remained in its spot as well. The bear he had gotten her still remained on the bed. Picking it up off the bed, he held onto it close. Her sweet smell lingered on the stuffed animal. It was her scent and it always lingered on everything he had owned. Even his detective badge. </p><p>He had thrown most of the stuff away in her apartment. At least the things Tegan had wanted to go. Old plastic Tupperware and utensils, the gross food that was now expired and the old bedsheets. He wasn\u2019t going to worry about the furniture. That was the owner\u2019s problem. Not like it even mattered as most of the tenants left the apartment and the owner was now facing serious charges against him. </p><p>Jay had already tackled the closet with most of the stuff packed up. Her clothes that were hanging were placed in boxes. By that time, Chris had already arrived and started loading the boxes in both cars. Looking at his watch, Tegan would be getting out of class soon and wanted to make sure it was all packed up before she got out of class. </p><p>Chris looked down on the ground and saw the dried blood that was on the floor. His heart immediately broke just looking at it. Not to mention the condition of the apartment in general. How in the hell did her aunt let Tegan live like this? No heat or AC - it was freezing in the apartment. He would be damned if Tegan would come back here. </p><p>\u201cI am just thankful Tegan has a better place to stay with both of you. I never liked this place.\u201d Jay said placing some of Tegan\u2019s stuff in boxes. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy looking at her blood on the ground.\u201d Chris could hear the sadness in his voice.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Jay, for getting the son of a bitch and for protecting her. She really likes you a lot.\u201d Chris gave a reassuring smile as he taped one of the boxes.</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you something, Chris?\u201d Chris nodded in agreement and Jay progressed with the question. \u201cSebastian is a friend of yours, correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am sorry about that. I don\u2019t even know why he was acting that way. Trust me, it won\u2019t happen again.\u201d Chris was quick to correct the actions that Sebastian had caused at the hospital. This wasn\u2019t the kind of drama that never should have been started. </p><p>\u201cI just want to know if he is going to be a problem. I really like Tegan and want to be with her. If he is, I will be damned if he gets in the way of my relationship with her. I plan on being in Tegan\u2019s life for as long as she wants me.\u201d Jay stopped and turned towards Chris. </p><p>\u201cTrust me, I WILL be damned if Sebastian gets in the way. I haven\u2019t even spoken to him since it happened. I am not exactly happy with him as well but I will talk to him. Don\u2019t worry. Just focus on Tegan.\u201d Chris really needs to speak with Sebastian and figure out what was going on.</p><p>\u201cIf things get out of hand, I will file charges for harassment and a restraining order. I don\u2019t care if he is your best friend. I will do whatever it takes to keep her safe.\u201d Jay said placing another box on the floor. Most of everything was packed up with the exception of the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, that will never happen again, you have my word.\u201d Chris looked over at Jay and both nodded in agreement. \u201cDoes Tegan want any of the furniture?\u201d Quickly changing the subject.</p><p>\u201cNo, just the clothes, the stuff in the bathroom and closet. Everything else can pretty much be left here. It doesn\u2019t even matter. The owner is in facing criminal charges and this place has been marked condemned.\u201d Jay explained grabbing some stuff from Tegan\u2019s side table. There were several pictures and one popped out to him. It was Tegan when she was younger, Daphne and another male. Chris had walked over as he went towards the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Tegan\u2019s older brother Logan. I think that picture was right around when Tegan\u2019s parents passed away. It was a rough time for all three of them and the only thing holding them together was Daphne. Here\u2019s a picture of her parents\u201d Chris pulled out the picture as it was the next picture on the pile. Jay took the picture and his heart immediately dropped looking at the picture. Tegan was so young when she lost her parents. He could see the striking resemblance between Tegan and her mother. The exact same smile and light behind her eyes. </p><p>Placing the picture in the box, he focused on getting the rest of the stuff together. Chris went into the bathroom and quickly packed it up. Placing the bear on top of the stuff, Jay taped the box up. Looking around the room, all of Tegan\u2019s stuff had been packed up. There wasn\u2019t much left in the way of her room anyways. </p><p>\u201cAlright, I got everything out of the bathroom. We should load the rest of this stuff up and get out of here. It\u2019s freezing and honestly, I cannot look at that spot anymore.\u201d Chris said looking down at the dried blood splatter.</p><p>\u201cYeah, let\u2019s get out of here. I am gonna need to pick up Tegan soon. Not to mention, I am getting hungry.\u201d Jay could hear his stomach start to growl causing Chris to laugh as well.</p><p>\u201cHow about before we load this stuff in the house, we get some lunch and then tackle this. You are staying for dinner right? I know Daphne is making something tasty.\u201d Chris picked up some of the boxes and made his way towards the door.</p><p>\u201cOf course. I can always go for tasty food.\u201d Jay laughed picking up several boxes alongside Chris. \u201cDaphne is an amazing cook by the way.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou think Daphne\u2019s good, it doesn\u2019t compare to Tegan\u2019s cooking. To be honest and don\u2019t tell Daphne because she would kill me but Tegan is way better at cooking. I think it\u2019s one of the reasons why I am glad she\u2019s with us. She makes a mean brownie cheesecake and Chicken Piccata.\u201d Chris laughed as they made there way down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s our little secret. It\u2019s something I definitely will looking forward too\u201d Giving each other a high five, they made there way back upstairs to finish the job. Within 20 minutes, the rest of the stuff was packed up and on there way. Jay couldn\u2019t help by smile realizing that the rest of the day would be spent with Tegan. Just holding and cuddling her in his arms. He would have to thank Hank for giving him an extra week. It was definitely what he needed. What they both needed. </p><hr><p>As the movie played, some of the students look bored with the movie. Maybe because it wasn\u2019t some action story or a superhero movie. But Sebastian\u2019s focus was on Tegan as the movie played. Her head was on Travis\u2019 shoulder as they leaned back in the seats. He could hear them whispering but wasn\u2019t sure about what. </p><p>Looking at his watch, the movie and class itself were almost over with. About half the class had already left the room and the rest was watching the movie. Just like that, the credits play causing him to get out of his seat.</p><p>\u201cAlright class, since we are way past the allotted time, next class we will cover any questions anyone has or you can come to my office. If you haven\u2019t turned in your assignment, please do so now. If not, it will be considered late and not be counted. Miss. Mitchell, please stay behind.\u201d Sebastian\u2019s eyes focus on Tegan could see a small blush hit her cheeks. With that, most of the class gathered their stuff and headed out the door.</p><p>\u201cWonder what\u2019s the about?\u201d Travis whispered causing Tegan to shrug. \u201cWant me to help you down there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, my leg is killing me right now and don\u2019t know if I will be able to walk down and back up the stairs.\u201d Tegan watched as Sebastian started gathering his stuff as well. By this time, all of the class had left the room just leaving Travis, Sebastian, and Tegan. Travis helped Tegan up and started the slow process down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cTegan, stay there. I will meet you up there. I don\u2019t want you injuring yourself more. Lord knows, your cousin will kill me.\u201d Sebastian flashed that pretty boy smile causing Tegan to get flushed just a bit.<i>\u201cStop it!\u201d </i>Trying to tell herself. It wasn\u2019t like he was completely attracted to her. </p><p>Just then, Tegan\u2019s felt like jello and landed back in the seat. She could see the concern on Travis\u2019 face as well as Sebastian as he walked up the stairs. \u201cYou alright, T,\u201d Travis asked watching her closely.</p><p>\u201cYeah, just slightly in pain.\u201d Tegan looked up at Sebastian and her heart raced even more as his blue eyes watched her every move. </p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t keep you long, I just wanted to see how you were doing? I can give you some extra time if you haven\u2019t completed the assignments?\u201d Sebastian watched Tegan smile towards him as it left him weak in the knees. </p><p>\u201cOh no, I finished the assignments, last night Professor.\u201d Tegan opened her bag to retrieve the three essays that had been completed. She looked up and handed them to him. The moment their hands touched, a simple spark shot through them. Tegan immediately retrieved her hand back the moment Sebastian took the essays unsure if he felt it as well. \u201cI was going to have Travis turn them at the end. Just couldn\u2019t really make it down there.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. I don\u2019t want to keep you any longer than you have to. Just don\u2019t overdo it alright and take care of yourself.\u201d With that Sebastian quickly walked out of the class, stuffing his hand in his jacket. A small tingle radiating through his hand up towards the arm. </p><p><i>\u201cHad she felt that as well?\u201d </i>Sebastian wondered walking back to his office. </p><hr><p>Tegan just watched as Sebastian left the room wondering what just happened. The look on Travis\u2019 face said everything as Tegan looked up at him. \u201cWhat was that T?\u201d Travis asked as he helped her up.</p><p>\u201cNo fucking clue but whatever it was, it doesn\u2019t matter. There is no way I could ever fall for Sebastian.\u201d Just than Tegan heard her phone go off and saw it was a message from Jay saying he was there. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d Both of them left the classroom with Tegan unsure of what the hell had just happened.</p><hr><p>\u201cDinner smells amazing Daphne.\u201d Jay smiled as they had unloaded the rest of the boxes. The most essential items went up towards Tegan\u2019s room and the rest had gone in the garage. Tegan was sprawled out on the couch watching some crime TV show - Criminal Minds. </p><p>\u201cThank you. Why don\u2019t both of you go get cleaned up cause dinner is almost ready.\u201d Daphne watched as the boys placed the remaining boxes down. \u201cTegan! Dinner.\u201d </p><p><i>\u201cOne moment.\u201d</i> Tegan\u2019s voice shouted from the other room.</p><p>\u201cHey, hunnie, why don\u2019t we let those two eat dinner in peace,\u201d Chris whispered in his girl\u2019s ear. \u201cLet\u2019s give them some alone time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNevermind T.\u201d Just than Tegan groaned from the other room shouting <i>\u201creally?\u201d </i>causing both of them to laugh. </p><p>\u201cHey Jay, we are going to eat in the other room and give both of you some time together. \u00a0Would you mind bringing this to Tegan?\u201d Daphne said handing two plates of food to Jay. It was Salmon with mixed vegetables and mashed potatoes.</p><p>\u201cOf course. Thank you.\u201d Jay smiled as he took the plates and walked over to where Tegan was sitting. His eyes focused on her placing the two plates on the small table in front of them. She was completely lost in the show. </p><p>\u201cHey baby, what would you like to drink?\u201d Tegan sat up just a bit and went to stand up but sat right back down. \u201cHey, easy love\u201d Tegan took Jay\u2019s hands into hers and met his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I say you, would that count,\u201d Tegan smirked looking at Jay\u2019s reaction causing him to laugh.</p><p>\u201cIt does my love, but I mean for dinner.\u201d Jay bent down and kissed Tegan on the lips. He cupped her chin to pull it closer to him as it captured her lips to his. Jay\u2019s tongue slowly massaging hers deepening the kiss. Slowly breaking the kiss, a small smile crept on Jay\u2019s face seeing the blush in Tegan\u2019s cheeks.</p><p>\u201cWater\u201d was all the Tegan managed to get out. \u201cYou got it, babe.\u201d With that Jay left the room and returned quickly with drinks in hand. Jay handed her the plate and took his plate. Both of them relaxed on the couch and ate dinner in comforting silence.</p><hr><p>Jay looked down at Tegan who was in-between his legs, curled up on her side. Placing a kiss on her forehead, he watched as her eyes struggled to stay open. The pain medication was starting to take its effect in helping relieve the pain in her leg. One his hands laced in with her fingers as the other hand started to rub her back lightly helping send her to sleep. His own eyes slowly started to close at the feeling of Tegan in his arms. </p><p>\u201cWould either of you\u2026\"Daphne walked into the room and stopped when she saw both of them asleep on the couch. Just then the doorbell rang with Chris walking in the room to answer it. Daphne grabbed the blanket off the couch and draped it over them. Opening the door, Chris looked in surprise as who was on the opposite side. </p><p><b>It was Sebastian\u2026</b></p><p><b>Do You See Me Taglist: \u00a0</b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mW5ssh_HpQSSs4kyjRhe9vA\">@hehurst23</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgSQ8RXPV_K5CBpeHj6cPsw\">@fangirlfiction</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPeJwFWMRmS8pvLzN_lQAWA\">@writing-in-the-impala</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mK5sYAuxIuAF6WSSFLdXNhw\">@emercat</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mARSIftlXw_99S9YvPIZ3MQ\">@cootie06</a>\u200b // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muqRvbe0mEj95uNt_yVzXuw\">@kyber-hearts-and-stardust-souls</a>\u200b // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTrt1frH3lYtqeYiaqMLhiA\">@lovejessejay</a>\u200b // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM3UeVBrk2zdM_9tQRO8Cog\">@canumoveurseatup-no</a>\u200b // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrg5dyIjtxkXJkfauPnLA6w\">@all1e23</a>\u200b // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3oVXVm_CJfrBWJsvf7wX4Q\">@buckmesideways22</a>\u200b // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEc2i1VDavwHiG3zjhY58fw\">@moonriv-er</a>\u200b // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDBZ6G6dGwaeFSodTIVmV-A\">@cap-evanns</a>\u200b // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mklkZ0WDDCgHBRbTDgg_EfA\">@cmorgana</a>\u200b // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mA4_8wswWZ_qSkEMMQ_5V0w\">@givebuckyhisplum</a>\u200b </p>",

It had been a few days since Tegan been released from the hospital and was going to be coming to class. He had missed seeing her beautiful face in class. It wasn\u2019t the same as her seat was empty and then remembering what she had gone through.</p><p>It\u2019s not like he can talk to Chris or Daphne about Tegan. They were barely speaking to him as it is. After the whole thing at the hospital, they basically had shut him out. It\u2019s not like he didn\u2019t deserve it. Tegan wasn\u2019t his girlfriend after all but it didn\u2019t stop him from caring even though she was with Jay. Lord, he hated that smug asshole. With the better than thou attitude because he was a cop. It didn\u2019t matter what Jay\u2019s job was - what mattered was Tegan and her safety. </p><p>If only things were that simple for him but it wasn\u2019t when she was with another man. She wasn\u2019t with him. The smile on her face or how happy she was around Jay. Her face had just lit up around him. How could he take that away from her and just resent him? No, it was just best to move on and focus on himself. To get rid of the nasty habits and be healthy for once. Maybe fates would be kind to him and someone new would appear. </p><p>Watching as Chris entered his office, they both looked at each other. Chris had dropped his stuff off and left just as quickly. Sebastian needed to talk it out but now wasn\u2019t the best time. The class was about to start and needed to head that way. Grabbing his stuff, Sebastian walked out of the office. Several of the female students just smiled towards him and give him those doey eyes they all loved to give him. </p><p>Turning the corner, Sebastian came to a dead stop as his attention focused outside - right in front of him. Seeing the one thing he didn\u2019t want to see at all. Just once, he wished things would be in his favor. Who was he kidding? That probably would never happen. All he could do was just watch as sadness took over. </p>[[MORE]]<hr><p>\u201cTegan sweetie, you don\u2019t have to go back to school this week. I am sure we can talk to Professor Stan and get your assignments. You need to rest.\u201d Daphne said watching her cousin got ready for school. Tegan had officially moved in with Daphne and Chris now. Jay had gone back to her old apartment to get the few essentials but had yet to remove the rest of her stuff out of there. </p><p>Honestly, Jay didn\u2019t want Tegan to go back there to get her stuff as it might trigger something. So the plan was for Jay and Chris to get her stuff later. Of course, Jay wanted Tegan to stay with him but right now, it was best she stay with here. It wasn\u2019t like Jay\u2019s apartment was far away from Daphne\u2019s house. It was at least 20 minutes away and pretty easy to get too. It was actually closer to the district than his apartment. </p><p>Tegan put the finishing touches on her makeup and looked up at her cousin, \u201cI know Daph, but if I don\u2019t get out this house I am going to go stir crazy. There is only so much TV I tolerate.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know sweetie, but you have only been out of the hospital for a week. Dr. Rhodes did say to take it easy.\u201d Just then the doorbell rang and Daphne saw the immediate smile on Tegan\u2019s face.<i> \u201cNo one ever listens to me\u201d</i> Daphne muttered walking down the stairs to answer the door.</p><p>\u201cHey Jay, how are you?\u201d Daphne asked as Jay walked into the house. Jay looked up towards the stairs and saw Tegan was wearing a pair of leggings and green plaid shirt along with her combats boots and his leather jacket. </p><p>\u201cHey, beautiful,\u201d Jay smirked walking up the stairs. Lord was she beautiful as the blush in her cheeks could be seen. That instant smile on her face the moment they looked at each other. How the hell did she have this effect on him so much?</p><p>\u201cAlright, I am going to go over here. Have a good day at school. Be safe.\u201d Daphne just shook her head and walked away. Oh, those two were at the point of being sickeningly annoying but it didn\u2019t matter. As long as Tegan was happy, that\u2019s all that mattered to her. </p><p>\u201cHey, there handsome.\u201d Tegan cupped his face and felt as Jay\u2019s face just rested in her hands. His eyes were closed and nuzzled against her hand. \u201cYou alright?\u201d </p><p>Jay opened his eyes and stepped up towards the next step. His eyes looked deep into hers and cupped her face as well. His lips slowly started to massage hers as his tongue advanced inward. His arms rested around her waist, holding her steady against him. Their tongues working together as the kiss became intense. The small moan that escaped her lips caused Jay to get turned on just a bit. Those sweet sounds that came out of her mouth were something he loved to hear. Both of them slowly pulled away as there heads rest against one another.</p><p>\u201cI am glad that you are safe and here with me baby. I promise I will always keep you safe, no matter what. I am sorry I couldn\u2019t be there to protect you.\u201d Tegan lifted his chin up to meet her eyes seeing the sadness in his eyes. </p><p>\u201cYou know I don\u2019t blame you or anything Jay. We didn\u2019t know it was going to happen. You got the son of a bitch and he\u2019s in jail. That\u2019s all that matters. You are right here with me and I couldn\u2019t be happier. How about tonight, we spend the night watching movies - just the two of us.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI would love that baby. Remember, I still owe you a Halstead dinner and whatever you want to do.\u201d Jay smirked as their hands linked in with one another. </p><p>\u201cWell, if you don\u2019t have a case this weekend, then how about Friday? Your place?\u201d Tegan smirked as Jay gave her that dashing smile. The one she loved so much. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a date, my love.\u201d Jay lifting up Tegan bridal style causing her to giggle and smile. Her arms linked around his neck and kissed Jay\u2019s neck. There was a small moan escape his lips as Tegan\u2019s lips went towards his ear. Oh, how she loved the sounds he made when they kissed. It literally brought Tegan to her knees. </p><p>\u201cYou are amazing Jay Halstead,\u201d She whispered into his ear as they got close to the truck. He was about to set her down but instead lightly spun her around causing her to giggle. Placing her back down, they just looked at each other. </p><p>\u201cNot as much as you. You are the light I need in my life.\u201d Jay looked deep into her eyes and could feel Tegan run her fingers through his hair. His eyes closed enjoying every touch as it went down towards his arms. It was something that he was never going to let go. \u201cLet\u2019s get you to class baby, I don\u2019t want you to be late.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh, we definitely don\u2019t want that,\u201d Tegan smirked as Jay helped her into the truck. Placing the crutches beside her and closed the door, Jay walked over towards the other side. Tegan looked up and saw the picture of them was on his dash. A huge smile crossed her face as they headed off to her school. There was no one she would rather be with than Jay Halstead. </p><hr><p>Jay had parked the truck on the side and went to help Tegan out of the truck. As Tegan exited the truck, she could see Travis was standing in there normal spot with 2 coffees and muffins in hand. Grabbing her backpack, Jay walked with her towards Travis. </p><p>\u201cWell, well, look who has decided to grace me with her presence. It\u2019s been a horrible two weeks without you!\u201d Travis smirked watching the two of them. They were both so in sync with one another it wasn\u2019t even funny. The happiness was written all over there faces. </p><p>\u201cLord help me with you two. I need to find someone at this rate.\u201d Travis groaned watched as Jay kissed her head. </p><p>\u201cHow about we go find someone for you?\u201d Tegan suggested looking amongst her best friend. Deep down, she knew that Travis had a thing for her brother. If only those two would get together. Time would only tell if that happened. </p><p>\u201cUm T, no thanks. I got someone in mind.\u201d Travis just rolled his eyes and heard the bell start to ring from the tower across signifying that it was time to go. The class was about to start in 10 minutes and didn\u2019t want to get on Professor Stan\u2019s bad side. \u201cWe should get going, T. We don\u2019t want to be late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo inside and save me a seat. I will be right there.\u201d Tegan suggested as Travis nodded and headed inside. \u201cYou got the key?\u201d Her attention turning towards Jay.</p><p>\u201cYup, anything particular you want me to keep or just the basics,\u201d Jay asked as they held hands with each other.</p><p>\u201cOh, I made a list.\u201d Tegan pulled the list out of her backpack and handed it to Jay. \u201cAll the furniture and bedsheets can go. It\u2019s pretty much everything on this list and everything else can go. It\u2019s old and not really needed.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay, so everything on this list?\u201d Jay placed the list in his pocket then wrapped his arms around her waist. He could see that she was swaying a bit so he held onto her tightly. Honestly, he would find any excuse to hold her close to him. Placing a kiss on her forehead, Tegan\u2019s hands went right back into his hair as her fingers ran through it. </p><p>Jay lowered his lips and went straight back to those glorious lips. They slowly massaged each other again and feeling her into him. There tongues dancing against one another as he deepened the kiss. There was that same moan from a bit ago driving him completely utterly nuts. Tegan lightly pulled away and looked deep into his eyes. </p><p>\u201cI could spend hours just kissing you,\u201d Jay whispered, trying to regain some sort of composure since they were out in public but it was almost impossible. There was just something about her that was impossible to resist. </p><p>\u201cHow about tonight as well. I need to go, baby. If you have any questions, just text me. I will see you later?\u201d \u00a0Tegan gave a small smile looking up at him.</p><p>\u201cOf course. I will pick you up after we get done, okay?\u201d Tegan took her backpack and gave Jay one last passionate kiss before she walked away leaving him breathless. Her own lips were now on fire just from the simple contact. Opening the door, she headed to class with a huge smile on her face.</p><hr><p>Sebastian did everything he could to remain calm. He couldn\u2019t hold this against Tegan at all. Being mean and nasty to her wasn\u2019t going to help his case by any means. At that moment, Sebastian realized that he wasn\u2019t going to give up that easy. All the back and forth within his brain had finally settled on an answer. He was going to do his best to sweep Tegan off her feet despite her being with Jay. Sebastian was going to steal Tegan for himself. Prove to her that he was the better guy and give her what she needed. Now that she was going to be living with Chris, it would be a lot easier to see her on a daily basis. The only thing he had to do was fix things. </p><p>Heading towards the class, Sebastian entered and saw some of the students were already seated. Assignments were already on his desk and placed his stuff on the chair. His attention turned around to face the class and saw Tegan had now entered the class. Both their eyes focused on one another and could feel his heart start to race as he looked at her. Watching her every moment as she didn\u2019t take her normal seat in the middle. It was right next to the stairs with Travis right beside her. </p><p>Tegan walked into the classroom and felt someone\u2019s eyes on her. She wasn\u2019t sure until she looked forward as Sebastian\u2019s eyes were focused watching her. That\u2019s when she felt butterflies appear and heart racing a million miles. How could this even be happening when she despised Sebastian? He was everything that didn\u2019t want in a man. Jay was everything she wanted. Right? Pushing those feelings deep down inside, Tegan took her seat and pulled out her laptop. </p><p>\u201cWas it just me or was the Professor completely focused on you?\u201d Travis whispered causing Tegan to give him a glare. With that Travis closed his mouth and then it hit him. The professor did have feelings for her. The whole conversation between Chris, Daphne and him when Tegan was in the hospital. It all made sense now. </p><p>He had heard the whole thing from outside. He just hoped that Sebastian wasn\u2019t going to do something stupid or worse - ruin her relationship with Jay. He wasn\u2019t going to let that happen at all. </p><p>\u201cAlright class, we are going to do something a little different from the lesson plan. I take it most of you have turned in your assignments. This next assignment will be a group essay with two or more people\u201d He could hear some students groaned and some were cheering as he proceeded, \u201cYou can choose who you want and will be due next Wednesday, so you have two weeks to complete it. With a show of hands, how many of you have seen Gone with the Wind?\u201d Sebastian watched as about half the class did and the rest didn\u2019t. He saw both Tegan and Travis\u2019 hand both go up. A small smile was placed on Tegan\u2019s face causing him to give a smile towards her. </p><p>\u201cAlright, we are going to be watching the movie but doing the assignment a little bit differently. I want you to write an essay and a partial play regarding the movie. But don\u2019t focus on the movie this time and era, I want you to focus the movie on today and now. How is it different from today\u2019s society, how is it the same, etc.. Each group will come up here, explain their findings and perform it. Now if you want more than two people be my guest, but each person will have to play a part. Understand?\u201d Sebastian could see some confused faces amongst several faces. \u201cI know it might sound confusing but how about we watch the movie and save questions for after. It is a four-hour movie, so if you need to go to the bathroom or anything during the movie, please do so. But please remember it\u2019s your responsibility to come back and make sure you do the work.\u201d </p><p>Most of the class nodded in agreement and settled in for the movie. Sebastian turned on the DVD player and turned off the lights. The movie started and his eyes focused upon Tegan who was smiling completely from ear to ear. The smile he loved to see so much. Grabbing his bag, Sebastian made his way up the stairs and took a seat behind Tegan and Travis. The smell of her perfume filled his nose as he took the seat. Closing his eyes, Sebastian settled into the seat and watched the movie. Secretly thinking it was the two of them. </p><hr><p>The moment Jay walked into the apartment, it felt like a knife to his gut. The police tape was still on the apartment door and it was freezing as ever. The dried blood remained in its spot as well. The bear he had gotten her still remained on the bed. Picking it up off the bed, he held onto it close. Her sweet smell lingered on the stuffed animal. It was her scent and it always lingered on everything he had owned. Even his detective badge. </p><p>He had thrown most of the stuff away in her apartment. At least the things Tegan had wanted to go. Old plastic Tupperware and utensils, the gross food that was now expired and the old bedsheets. He wasn\u2019t going to worry about the furniture. That was the owner\u2019s problem. Not like it even mattered as most of the tenants left the apartment and the owner was now facing serious charges against him. </p><p>Jay had already tackled the closet with most of the stuff packed up. Her clothes that were hanging were placed in boxes. By that time, Chris had already arrived and started loading the boxes in both cars. Looking at his watch, Tegan would be getting out of class soon and wanted to make sure it was all packed up before she got out of class. </p><p>Chris looked down on the ground and saw the dried blood that was on the floor. His heart immediately broke just looking at it. Not to mention the condition of the apartment in general. How in the hell did her aunt let Tegan live like this? No heat or AC - it was freezing in the apartment. He would be damned if Tegan would come back here. </p><p>\u201cI am just thankful Tegan has a better place to stay with both of you. I never liked this place.\u201d Jay said placing some of Tegan\u2019s stuff in boxes. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy looking at her blood on the ground.\u201d Chris could hear the sadness in his voice.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Jay, for getting the son of a bitch and for protecting her. She really likes you a lot.\u201d Chris gave a reassuring smile as he taped one of the boxes.</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you something, Chris?\u201d Chris nodded in agreement and Jay progressed with the question. \u201cSebastian is a friend of yours, correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am sorry about that. I don\u2019t even know why he was acting that way. Trust me, it won\u2019t happen again.\u201d Chris was quick to correct the actions that Sebastian had caused at the hospital. This wasn\u2019t the kind of drama that never should have been started. </p><p>\u201cI just want to know if he is going to be a problem. I really like Tegan and want to be with her. If he is, I will be damned if he gets in the way of my relationship with her. I plan on being in Tegan\u2019s life for as long as she wants me.\u201d Jay stopped and turned towards Chris. </p><p>\u201cTrust me, I WILL be damned if Sebastian gets in the way. I haven\u2019t even spoken to him since it happened. I am not exactly happy with him as well but I will talk to him. Don\u2019t worry. Just focus on Tegan.\u201d Chris really needs to speak with Sebastian and figure out what was going on.</p><p>\u201cIf things get out of hand, I will file charges for harassment and a restraining order. I don\u2019t care if he is your best friend. I will do whatever it takes to keep her safe.\u201d Jay said placing another box on the floor. Most of everything was packed up with the exception of the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, that will never happen again, you have my word.\u201d Chris looked over at Jay and both nodded in agreement. \u201cDoes Tegan want any of the furniture?\u201d Quickly changing the subject.</p><p>\u201cNo, just the clothes, the stuff in the bathroom and closet. Everything else can pretty much be left here. It doesn\u2019t even matter. The owner is in facing criminal charges and this place has been marked condemned.\u201d Jay explained grabbing some stuff from Tegan\u2019s side table. There were several pictures and one popped out to him. It was Tegan when she was younger, Daphne and another male. Chris had walked over as he went towards the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Tegan\u2019s older brother Logan. I think that picture was right around when Tegan\u2019s parents passed away. It was a rough time for all three of them and the only thing holding them together was Daphne. Here\u2019s a picture of her parents\u201d Chris pulled out the picture as it was the next picture on the pile. Jay took the picture and his heart immediately dropped looking at the picture. Tegan was so young when she lost her parents. He could see the striking resemblance between Tegan and her mother. The exact same smile and light behind her eyes. </p><p>Placing the picture in the box, he focused on getting the rest of the stuff together. Chris went into the bathroom and quickly packed it up. Placing the bear on top of the stuff, Jay taped the box up. Looking around the room, all of Tegan\u2019s stuff had been packed up. There wasn\u2019t much left in the way of her room anyways. </p><p>\u201cAlright, I got everything out of the bathroom. We should load the rest of this stuff up and get out of here. It\u2019s freezing and honestly, I cannot look at that spot anymore.\u201d Chris said looking down at the dried blood splatter.</p><p>\u201cYeah, let\u2019s get out of here. I am gonna need to pick up Tegan soon. Not to mention, I am getting hungry.\u201d Jay could hear his stomach start to growl causing Chris to laugh as well.</p><p>\u201cHow about before we load this stuff in the house, we get some lunch and then tackle this. You are staying for dinner right? I know Daphne is making something tasty.\u201d Chris picked up some of the boxes and made his way towards the door.</p><p>\u201cOf course. I can always go for tasty food.\u201d Jay laughed picking up several boxes alongside Chris. \u201cDaphne is an amazing cook by the way.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou think Daphne\u2019s good, it doesn\u2019t compare to Tegan\u2019s cooking. To be honest and don\u2019t tell Daphne because she would kill me but Tegan is way better at cooking. I think it\u2019s one of the reasons why I am glad she\u2019s with us. She makes a mean brownie cheesecake and Chicken Piccata.\u201d Chris laughed as they made there way down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s our little secret. It\u2019s something I definitely will looking forward too\u201d Giving each other a high five, they made there way back upstairs to finish the job. Within 20 minutes, the rest of the stuff was packed up and on there way. Jay couldn\u2019t help by smile realizing that the rest of the day would be spent with Tegan. Just holding and cuddling her in his arms. He would have to thank Hank for giving him an extra week. It was definitely what he needed. What they both needed. </p><hr><p>As the movie played, some of the students look bored with the movie. Maybe because it wasn\u2019t some action story or a superhero movie. But Sebastian\u2019s focus was on Tegan as the movie played. Her head was on Travis\u2019 shoulder as they leaned back in the seats. He could hear them whispering but wasn\u2019t sure about what. </p><p>Looking at his watch, the movie and class itself were almost over with. About half the class had already left the room and the rest was watching the movie. Just like that, the credits play causing him to get out of his seat.</p><p>\u201cAlright class, since we are way past the allotted time, next class we will cover any questions anyone has or you can come to my office. If you haven\u2019t turned in your assignment, please do so now. If not, it will be considered late and not be counted. Miss. Mitchell, please stay behind.\u201d Sebastian\u2019s eyes focus on Tegan could see a small blush hit her cheeks. With that, most of the class gathered their stuff and headed out the door.</p><p>\u201cWonder what\u2019s the about?\u201d Travis whispered causing Tegan to shrug. \u201cWant me to help you down there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, my leg is killing me right now and don\u2019t know if I will be able to walk down and back up the stairs.\u201d Tegan watched as Sebastian started gathering his stuff as well. By this time, all of the class had left the room just leaving Travis, Sebastian, and Tegan. Travis helped Tegan up and started the slow process down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cTegan, stay there. I will meet you up there. I don\u2019t want you injuring yourself more. Lord knows, your cousin will kill me.\u201d Sebastian flashed that pretty boy smile causing Tegan to get flushed just a bit.<i>\u201cStop it!\u201d </i>Trying to tell herself. It wasn\u2019t like he was completely attracted to her. </p><p>Just then, Tegan\u2019s felt like jello and landed back in the seat. She could see the concern on Travis\u2019 face as well as Sebastian as he walked up the stairs. \u201cYou alright, T,\u201d Travis asked watching her closely.</p><p>\u201cYeah, just slightly in pain.\u201d Tegan looked up at Sebastian and her heart raced even more as his blue eyes watched her every move. </p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t keep you long, I just wanted to see how you were doing? I can give you some extra time if you haven\u2019t completed the assignments?\u201d Sebastian watched Tegan smile towards him as it left him weak in the knees. </p><p>\u201cOh no, I finished the assignments, last night Professor.\u201d Tegan opened her bag to retrieve the three essays that had been completed. She looked up and handed them to him. The moment their hands touched, a simple spark shot through them. Tegan immediately retrieved her hand back the moment Sebastian took the essays unsure if he felt it as well. \u201cI was going to have Travis turn them at the end. Just couldn\u2019t really make it down there.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. I don\u2019t want to keep you any longer than you have to. Just don\u2019t overdo it alright and take care of yourself.\u201d With that Sebastian quickly walked out of the class, stuffing his hand in his jacket. A small tingle radiating through his hand up towards the arm. </p><p><i>\u201cHad she felt that as well?\u201d </i>Sebastian wondered walking back to his office. </p><hr><p>Tegan just watched as Sebastian left the room wondering what just happened. The look on Travis\u2019 face said everything as Tegan looked up at him. \u201cWhat was that T?\u201d Travis asked as he helped her up.</p><p>\u201cNo fucking clue but whatever it was, it doesn\u2019t matter. There is no way I could ever fall for Sebastian.\u201d Just than Tegan heard her phone go off and saw it was a message from Jay saying he was there. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d Both of them left the classroom with Tegan unsure of what the hell had just happened.</p><hr><p>\u201cDinner smells amazing Daphne.\u201d Jay smiled as they had unloaded the rest of the boxes. The most essential items went up towards Tegan\u2019s room and the rest had gone in the garage. Tegan was sprawled out on the couch watching some crime TV show - Criminal Minds. </p><p>\u201cThank you. Why don\u2019t both of you go get cleaned up cause dinner is almost ready.\u201d Daphne watched as the boys placed the remaining boxes down. \u201cTegan! Dinner.\u201d </p><p><i>\u201cOne moment.\u201d</i> Tegan\u2019s voice shouted from the other room.</p><p>\u201cHey, hunnie, why don\u2019t we let those two eat dinner in peace,\u201d Chris whispered in his girl\u2019s ear. \u201cLet\u2019s give them some alone time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNevermind T.\u201d Just than Tegan groaned from the other room shouting <i>\u201creally?\u201d </i>causing both of them to laugh. </p><p>\u201cHey Jay, we are going to eat in the other room and give both of you some time together. \u00a0Would you mind bringing this to Tegan?\u201d Daphne said handing two plates of food to Jay. It was Salmon with mixed vegetables and mashed potatoes.</p><p>\u201cOf course. Thank you.\u201d Jay smiled as he took the plates and walked over to where Tegan was sitting. His eyes focused on her placing the two plates on the small table in front of them. She was completely lost in the show. </p><p>\u201cHey baby, what would you like to drink?\u201d Tegan sat up just a bit and went to stand up but sat right back down. \u201cHey, easy love\u201d Tegan took Jay\u2019s hands into hers and met his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I say you, would that count,\u201d Tegan smirked looking at Jay\u2019s reaction causing him to laugh.</p><p>\u201cIt does my love, but I mean for dinner.\u201d Jay bent down and kissed Tegan on the lips. He cupped her chin to pull it closer to him as it captured her lips to his. Jay\u2019s tongue slowly massaging hers deepening the kiss. Slowly breaking the kiss, a small smile crept on Jay\u2019s face seeing the blush in Tegan\u2019s cheeks.</p><p>\u201cWater\u201d was all the Tegan managed to get out. \u201cYou got it, babe.\u201d With that Jay left the room and returned quickly with drinks in hand. Jay handed her the plate and took his plate. Both of them relaxed on the couch and ate dinner in comforting silence.</p><hr><p>Jay looked down at Tegan who was in-between his legs, curled up on her side. Placing a kiss on her forehead, he watched as her eyes struggled to stay open. The pain medication was starting to take its effect in helping relieve the pain in her leg. One his hands laced in with her fingers as the other hand started to rub her back lightly helping send her to sleep. His own eyes slowly started to close at the feeling of Tegan in his arms. </p><p>\u201cWould either of you\u2026\"Daphne walked into the room and stopped when she saw both of them asleep on the couch. Just then the doorbell rang with Chris walking in the room to answer it. Daphne grabbed the blanket off the couch and draped it over them. Opening the door, Chris looked in surprise as who was on the opposite side. </p><p><b>It was Sebastian\u2026</b></p><p><b>Do You See Me Taglist: \u00a0</b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mW5ssh_HpQSSs4kyjRhe9vA\">@hehurst23</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgSQ8RXPV_K5CBpeHj6cPsw\">@fangirlfiction</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPeJwFWMRmS8pvLzN_lQAWA\">@writing-in-the-impala</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mK5sYAuxIuAF6WSSFLdXNhw\">@emercat</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mARSIftlXw_99S9YvPIZ3MQ\">@cootie06</a>\u200b // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muqRvbe0mEj95uNt_yVzXuw\">@kyber-hearts-and-stardust-souls</a>\u200b // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTrt1frH3lYtqeYiaqMLhiA\">@lovejessejay</a>\u200b // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM3UeVBrk2zdM_9tQRO8Cog\">@canumoveurseatup-no</a>\u200b // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrg5dyIjtxkXJkfauPnLA6w\">@all1e23</a>\u200b // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3oVXVm_CJfrBWJsvf7wX4Q\">@buckmesideways22</a>\u200b // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEc2i1VDavwHiG3zjhY58fw\">@moonriv-er</a>\u200b // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDBZ6G6dGwaeFSodTIVmV-A\">@cap-evanns</a>\u200b // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mklkZ0WDDCgHBRbTDgg_EfA\">@cmorgana</a>\u200b // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mA4_8wswWZ_qSkEMMQ_5V0w\">@givebuckyhisplum</a>\u200b </p>",

It had been a few days since Tegan been released from the hospital and was going to be coming to class. He had missed seeing her beautiful face in class. It wasn&rsquo;t the same as her seat was empty and then remembering what she had gone through.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not like he can talk to Chris or Daphne about Tegan. They were barely speaking to him as it is. After the whole thing at the hospital, they basically had shut him out. It&rsquo;s not like he didn&rsquo;t deserve it. Tegan wasn&rsquo;t his girlfriend after all but it didn&rsquo;t stop him from caring even though she was with Jay. Lord, he hated that smug asshole. With the better than thou attitude because he was a cop. It didn&rsquo;t matter what Jay&rsquo;s job was - what mattered was Tegan and her safety. </p><p>If only things were that simple for him but it wasn&rsquo;t when she was with another man. She wasn&rsquo;t with him. The smile on her face or how happy she was around Jay. Her face had just lit up around him. How could he take that away from her and just resent him? No, it was just best to move on and focus on himself. To get rid of the nasty habits and be healthy for once. Maybe fates would be kind to him and someone new would appear. </p><p>Watching as Chris entered his office, they both looked at each other. Chris had dropped his stuff off and left just as quickly. Sebastian needed to talk it out but now wasn&rsquo;t the best time. The class was about to start and needed to head that way. Grabbing his stuff, Sebastian walked out of the office. Several of the female students just smiled towards him and give him those doey eyes they all loved to give him. </p><p>Turning the corner, Sebastian came to a dead stop as his attention focused outside - right in front of him. Seeing the one thing he didn&rsquo;t want to see at all. Just once, he wished things would be in his favor. Who was he kidding? That probably would never happen. All he could do was just watch as sadness took over. </p><hr /><p>&ldquo;Tegan sweetie, you don&rsquo;t have to go back to school this week. I am sure we can talk to Professor Stan and get your assignments. You need to rest.&rdquo; Daphne said watching her cousin got ready for school. Tegan had officially moved in with Daphne and Chris now. Jay had gone back to her old apartment to get the few essentials but had yet to remove the rest of her stuff out of there. </p><p>Honestly, Jay didn&rsquo;t want Tegan to go back there to get her stuff as it might trigger something. So the plan was for Jay and Chris to get her stuff later. Of course, Jay wanted Tegan to stay with him but right now, it was best she stay with here. It wasn&rsquo;t like Jay&rsquo;s apartment was far away from Daphne&rsquo;s house. It was at least 20 minutes away and pretty easy to get too. It was actually closer to the district than his apartment. </p><p>Tegan put the finishing touches on her makeup and looked up at her cousin, &ldquo;I know Daph, but if I don&rsquo;t get out this house I am going to go stir crazy. There is only so much TV I tolerate.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I know sweetie, but you have only been out of the hospital for a week. Dr. Rhodes did say to take it easy.&rdquo; Just then the doorbell rang and Daphne saw the immediate smile on Tegan&rsquo;s face.<i> &ldquo;No one ever listens to me&rdquo;</i> Daphne muttered walking down the stairs to answer the door.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Jay, how are you?&rdquo; Daphne asked as Jay walked into the house. Jay looked up towards the stairs and saw Tegan was wearing a pair of leggings and green plaid shirt along with her combats boots and his leather jacket. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, beautiful,&rdquo; Jay smirked walking up the stairs. Lord was she beautiful as the blush in her cheeks could be seen. That instant smile on her face the moment they looked at each other. How the hell did she have this effect on him so much?</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, I am going to go over here. Have a good day at school. Be safe.&rdquo; Daphne just shook her head and walked away. Oh, those two were at the point of being sickeningly annoying but it didn&rsquo;t matter. As long as Tegan was happy, that&rsquo;s all that mattered to her. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, there handsome.&rdquo; Tegan cupped his face and felt as Jay&rsquo;s face just rested in her hands. His eyes were closed and nuzzled against her hand. &ldquo;You alright?&rdquo; </p><p>Jay opened his eyes and stepped up towards the next step. His eyes looked deep into hers and cupped her face as well. His lips slowly started to massage hers as his tongue advanced inward. His arms rested around her waist, holding her steady against him. Their tongues working together as the kiss became intense. The small moan that escaped her lips caused Jay to get turned on just a bit. Those sweet sounds that came out of her mouth were something he loved to hear. Both of them slowly pulled away as there heads rest against one another.</p><p>&ldquo;I am glad that you are safe and here with me baby. I promise I will always keep you safe, no matter what. I am sorry I couldn&rsquo;t be there to protect you.&rdquo; Tegan lifted his chin up to meet her eyes seeing the sadness in his eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;You know I don&rsquo;t blame you or anything Jay. We didn&rsquo;t know it was going to happen. You got the son of a bitch and he&rsquo;s in jail. That&rsquo;s all that matters. You are right here with me and I couldn&rsquo;t be happier. How about tonight, we spend the night watching movies - just the two of us.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I would love that baby. Remember, I still owe you a Halstead dinner and whatever you want to do.&rdquo; Jay smirked as their hands linked in with one another. </p><p>&ldquo;Well, if you don&rsquo;t have a case this weekend, then how about Friday? Your place?&rdquo; Tegan smirked as Jay gave her that dashing smile. The one she loved so much. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a date, my love.&rdquo; Jay lifting up Tegan bridal style causing her to giggle and smile. Her arms linked around his neck and kissed Jay&rsquo;s neck. There was a small moan escape his lips as Tegan&rsquo;s lips went towards his ear. Oh, how she loved the sounds he made when they kissed. It literally brought Tegan to her knees. </p><p>&ldquo;You are amazing Jay Halstead,&rdquo; She whispered into his ear as they got close to the truck. He was about to set her down but instead lightly spun her around causing her to giggle. Placing her back down, they just looked at each other. </p><p>&ldquo;Not as much as you. You are the light I need in my life.&rdquo; Jay looked deep into her eyes and could feel Tegan run her fingers through his hair. His eyes closed enjoying every touch as it went down towards his arms. It was something that he was never going to let go. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get you to class baby, I don&rsquo;t want you to be late.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, we definitely don&rsquo;t want that,&rdquo; Tegan smirked as Jay helped her into the truck. Placing the crutches beside her and closed the door, Jay walked over towards the other side. Tegan looked up and saw the picture of them was on his dash. A huge smile crossed her face as they headed off to her school. There was no one she would rather be with than Jay Halstead. </p><hr /><p>Jay had parked the truck on the side and went to help Tegan out of the truck. As Tegan exited the truck, she could see Travis was standing in there normal spot with 2 coffees and muffins in hand. Grabbing her backpack, Jay walked with her towards Travis. </p><p>&ldquo;Well, well, look who has decided to grace me with her presence. It&rsquo;s been a horrible two weeks without you!&rdquo; Travis smirked watching the two of them. They were both so in sync with one another it wasn&rsquo;t even funny. The happiness was written all over there faces. </p><p>&ldquo;Lord help me with you two. I need to find someone at this rate.&rdquo; Travis groaned watched as Jay kissed her head. </p><p>&ldquo;How about we go find someone for you?&rdquo; Tegan suggested looking amongst her best friend. Deep down, she knew that Travis had a thing for her brother. If only those two would get together. Time would only tell if that happened. </p><p>&ldquo;Um T, no thanks. I got someone in mind.&rdquo; Travis just rolled his eyes and heard the bell start to ring from the tower across signifying that it was time to go. The class was about to start in 10 minutes and didn&rsquo;t want to get on Professor Stan&rsquo;s bad side. &ldquo;We should get going, T. We don&rsquo;t want to be late.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Go inside and save me a seat. I will be right there.&rdquo; Tegan suggested as Travis nodded and headed inside. &ldquo;You got the key?&rdquo; Her attention turning towards Jay.</p><p>&ldquo;Yup, anything particular you want me to keep or just the basics,&rdquo; Jay asked as they held hands with each other.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I made a list.&rdquo; Tegan pulled the list out of her backpack and handed it to Jay. &ldquo;All the furniture and bedsheets can go. It&rsquo;s pretty much everything on this list and everything else can go. It&rsquo;s old and not really needed.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Okay, so everything on this list?&rdquo; Jay placed the list in his pocket then wrapped his arms around her waist. He could see that she was swaying a bit so he held onto her tightly. Honestly, he would find any excuse to hold her close to him. Placing a kiss on her forehead, Tegan&rsquo;s hands went right back into his hair as her fingers ran through it. </p><p>Jay lowered his lips and went straight back to those glorious lips. They slowly massaged each other again and feeling her into him. There tongues dancing against one another as he deepened the kiss. There was that same moan from a bit ago driving him completely utterly nuts. Tegan lightly pulled away and looked deep into his eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;I could spend hours just kissing you,&rdquo; Jay whispered, trying to regain some sort of composure since they were out in public but it was almost impossible. There was just something about her that was impossible to resist. </p><p>&ldquo;How about tonight as well. I need to go, baby. If you have any questions, just text me. I will see you later?&rdquo; &nbsp;Tegan gave a small smile looking up at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course. I will pick you up after we get done, okay?&rdquo; Tegan took her backpack and gave Jay one last passionate kiss before she walked away leaving him breathless. Her own lips were now on fire just from the simple contact. Opening the door, she headed to class with a huge smile on her face.</p><hr /><p>Sebastian did everything he could to remain calm. He couldn&rsquo;t hold this against Tegan at all. Being mean and nasty to her wasn&rsquo;t going to help his case by any means. At that moment, Sebastian realized that he wasn&rsquo;t going to give up that easy. All the back and forth within his brain had finally settled on an answer. He was going to do his best to sweep Tegan off her feet despite her being with Jay. Sebastian was going to steal Tegan for himself. Prove to her that he was the better guy and give her what she needed. Now that she was going to be living with Chris, it would be a lot easier to see her on a daily basis. The only thing he had to do was fix things. </p><p>Heading towards the class, Sebastian entered and saw some of the students were already seated. Assignments were already on his desk and placed his stuff on the chair. His attention turned around to face the class and saw Tegan had now entered the class. Both their eyes focused on one another and could feel his heart start to race as he looked at her. Watching her every moment as she didn&rsquo;t take her normal seat in the middle. It was right next to the stairs with Travis right beside her. </p><p>Tegan walked into the classroom and felt someone&rsquo;s eyes on her. She wasn&rsquo;t sure until she looked forward as Sebastian&rsquo;s eyes were focused watching her. That&rsquo;s when she felt butterflies appear and heart racing a million miles. How could this even be happening when she despised Sebastian? He was everything that didn&rsquo;t want in a man. Jay was everything she wanted. Right? Pushing those feelings deep down inside, Tegan took her seat and pulled out her laptop. </p><p>&ldquo;Was it just me or was the Professor completely focused on you?&rdquo; Travis whispered causing Tegan to give him a glare. With that Travis closed his mouth and then it hit him. The professor did have feelings for her. The whole conversation between Chris, Daphne and him when Tegan was in the hospital. It all made sense now. </p><p>He had heard the whole thing from outside. He just hoped that Sebastian wasn&rsquo;t going to do something stupid or worse - ruin her relationship with Jay. He wasn&rsquo;t going to let that happen at all. </p><p>&ldquo;Alright class, we are going to do something a little different from the lesson plan. I take it most of you have turned in your assignments. This next assignment will be a group essay with two or more people&rdquo; He could hear some students groaned and some were cheering as he proceeded, &ldquo;You can choose who you want and will be due next Wednesday, so you have two weeks to complete it. With a show of hands, how many of you have seen Gone with the Wind?&rdquo; Sebastian watched as about half the class did and the rest didn&rsquo;t. He saw both Tegan and Travis&rsquo; hand both go up. A small smile was placed on Tegan&rsquo;s face causing him to give a smile towards her. </p><p>&ldquo;Alright, we are going to be watching the movie but doing the assignment a little bit differently. I want you to write an essay and a partial play regarding the movie. But don&rsquo;t focus on the movie this time and era, I want you to focus the movie on today and now. How is it different from today&rsquo;s society, how is it the same, etc.. Each group will come up here, explain their findings and perform it. Now if you want more than two people be my guest, but each person will have to play a part. Understand?&rdquo; Sebastian could see some confused faces amongst several faces. &ldquo;I know it might sound confusing but how about we watch the movie and save questions for after. It is a four-hour movie, so if you need to go to the bathroom or anything during the movie, please do so. But please remember it&rsquo;s your responsibility to come back and make sure you do the work.&rdquo; </p><p>Most of the class nodded in agreement and settled in for the movie. Sebastian turned on the DVD player and turned off the lights. The movie started and his eyes focused upon Tegan who was smiling completely from ear to ear. The smile he loved to see so much. Grabbing his bag, Sebastian made his way up the stairs and took a seat behind Tegan and Travis. The smell of her perfume filled his nose as he took the seat. Closing his eyes, Sebastian settled into the seat and watched the movie. Secretly thinking it was the two of them. </p><hr /><p>The moment Jay walked into the apartment, it felt like a knife to his gut. The police tape was still on the apartment door and it was freezing as ever. The dried blood remained in its spot as well. The bear he had gotten her still remained on the bed. Picking it up off the bed, he held onto it close. Her sweet smell lingered on the stuffed animal. It was her scent and it always lingered on everything he had owned. Even his detective badge. </p><p>He had thrown most of the stuff away in her apartment. At least the things Tegan had wanted to go. Old plastic Tupperware and utensils, the gross food that was now expired and the old bedsheets. He wasn&rsquo;t going to worry about the furniture. That was the owner&rsquo;s problem. Not like it even mattered as most of the tenants left the apartment and the owner was now facing serious charges against him. </p><p>Jay had already tackled the closet with most of the stuff packed up. Her clothes that were hanging were placed in boxes. By that time, Chris had already arrived and started loading the boxes in both cars. Looking at his watch, Tegan would be getting out of class soon and wanted to make sure it was all packed up before she got out of class. </p><p>Chris looked down on the ground and saw the dried blood that was on the floor. His heart immediately broke just looking at it. Not to mention the condition of the apartment in general. How in the hell did her aunt let Tegan live like this? No heat or AC - it was freezing in the apartment. He would be damned if Tegan would come back here. </p><p>&ldquo;I am just thankful Tegan has a better place to stay with both of you. I never liked this place.&rdquo; Jay said placing some of Tegan&rsquo;s stuff in boxes. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not easy looking at her blood on the ground.&rdquo; Chris could hear the sadness in his voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Jay, for getting the son of a bitch and for protecting her. She really likes you a lot.&rdquo; Chris gave a reassuring smile as he taped one of the boxes.</p><p>&ldquo;Can I ask you something, Chris?&rdquo; Chris nodded in agreement and Jay progressed with the question. &ldquo;Sebastian is a friend of yours, correct?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am sorry about that. I don&rsquo;t even know why he was acting that way. Trust me, it won&rsquo;t happen again.&rdquo; Chris was quick to correct the actions that Sebastian had caused at the hospital. This wasn&rsquo;t the kind of drama that never should have been started. </p><p>&ldquo;I just want to know if he is going to be a problem. I really like Tegan and want to be with her. If he is, I will be damned if he gets in the way of my relationship with her. I plan on being in Tegan&rsquo;s life for as long as she wants me.&rdquo; Jay stopped and turned towards Chris. </p><p>&ldquo;Trust me, I WILL be damned if Sebastian gets in the way. I haven&rsquo;t even spoken to him since it happened. I am not exactly happy with him as well but I will talk to him. Don&rsquo;t worry. Just focus on Tegan.&rdquo; Chris really needs to speak with Sebastian and figure out what was going on.</p><p>&ldquo;If things get out of hand, I will file charges for harassment and a restraining order. I don&rsquo;t care if he is your best friend. I will do whatever it takes to keep her safe.&rdquo; Jay said placing another box on the floor. Most of everything was packed up with the exception of the bathroom.</p><p>&ldquo;Trust me, that will never happen again, you have my word.&rdquo; Chris looked over at Jay and both nodded in agreement. &ldquo;Does Tegan want any of the furniture?&rdquo; Quickly changing the subject.</p><p>&ldquo;No, just the clothes, the stuff in the bathroom and closet. Everything else can pretty much be left here. It doesn&rsquo;t even matter. The owner is in facing criminal charges and this place has been marked condemned.&rdquo; Jay explained grabbing some stuff from Tegan&rsquo;s side table. There were several pictures and one popped out to him. It was Tegan when she was younger, Daphne and another male. Chris had walked over as he went towards the bathroom.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Tegan&rsquo;s older brother Logan. I think that picture was right around when Tegan&rsquo;s parents passed away. It was a rough time for all three of them and the only thing holding them together was Daphne. Here&rsquo;s a picture of her parents&rdquo; Chris pulled out the picture as it was the next picture on the pile. Jay took the picture and his heart immediately dropped looking at the picture. Tegan was so young when she lost her parents. He could see the striking resemblance between Tegan and her mother. The exact same smile and light behind her eyes. </p><p>Placing the picture in the box, he focused on getting the rest of the stuff together. Chris went into the bathroom and quickly packed it up. Placing the bear on top of the stuff, Jay taped the box up. Looking around the room, all of Tegan&rsquo;s stuff had been packed up. There wasn&rsquo;t much left in the way of her room anyways. </p><p>&ldquo;Alright, I got everything out of the bathroom. We should load the rest of this stuff up and get out of here. It&rsquo;s freezing and honestly, I cannot look at that spot anymore.&rdquo; Chris said looking down at the dried blood splatter.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, let&rsquo;s get out of here. I am gonna need to pick up Tegan soon. Not to mention, I am getting hungry.&rdquo; Jay could hear his stomach start to growl causing Chris to laugh as well.</p><p>&ldquo;How about before we load this stuff in the house, we get some lunch and then tackle this. You are staying for dinner right? I know Daphne is making something tasty.&rdquo; Chris picked up some of the boxes and made his way towards the door.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course. I can always go for tasty food.&rdquo; Jay laughed picking up several boxes alongside Chris. &ldquo;Daphne is an amazing cook by the way.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You think Daphne&rsquo;s good, it doesn&rsquo;t compare to Tegan&rsquo;s cooking. To be honest and don&rsquo;t tell Daphne because she would kill me but Tegan is way better at cooking. I think it&rsquo;s one of the reasons why I am glad she&rsquo;s with us. She makes a mean brownie cheesecake and Chicken Piccata.&rdquo; Chris laughed as they made there way down the stairs.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, it&rsquo;s our little secret. It&rsquo;s something I definitely will looking forward too&rdquo; Giving each other a high five, they made there way back upstairs to finish the job. Within 20 minutes, the rest of the stuff was packed up and on there way. Jay couldn&rsquo;t help by smile realizing that the rest of the day would be spent with Tegan. Just holding and cuddling her in his arms. He would have to thank Hank for giving him an extra week. It was definitely what he needed. What they both needed. </p><hr /><p>As the movie played, some of the students look bored with the movie. Maybe because it wasn&rsquo;t some action story or a superhero movie. But Sebastian&rsquo;s focus was on Tegan as the movie played. Her head was on Travis&rsquo; shoulder as they leaned back in the seats. He could hear them whispering but wasn&rsquo;t sure about what. </p><p>Looking at his watch, the movie and class itself were almost over with. About half the class had already left the room and the rest was watching the movie. Just like that, the credits play causing him to get out of his seat.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright class, since we are way past the allotted time, next class we will cover any questions anyone has or you can come to my office. If you haven&rsquo;t turned in your assignment, please do so now. If not, it will be considered late and not be counted. Miss. Mitchell, please stay behind.&rdquo; Sebastian&rsquo;s eyes focus on Tegan could see a small blush hit her cheeks. With that, most of the class gathered their stuff and headed out the door.</p><p>&ldquo;Wonder what&rsquo;s the about?&rdquo; Travis whispered causing Tegan to shrug. &ldquo;Want me to help you down there?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, my leg is killing me right now and don&rsquo;t know if I will be able to walk down and back up the stairs.&rdquo; Tegan watched as Sebastian started gathering his stuff as well. By this time, all of the class had left the room just leaving Travis, Sebastian, and Tegan. Travis helped Tegan up and started the slow process down the stairs.</p><p>&ldquo;Tegan, stay there. I will meet you up there. I don&rsquo;t want you injuring yourself more. Lord knows, your cousin will kill me.&rdquo; Sebastian flashed that pretty boy smile causing Tegan to get flushed just a bit.<i>&ldquo;Stop it!&rdquo; </i>Trying to tell herself. It wasn&rsquo;t like he was completely attracted to her. </p><p>Just then, Tegan&rsquo;s felt like jello and landed back in the seat. She could see the concern on Travis&rsquo; face as well as Sebastian as he walked up the stairs. &ldquo;You alright, T,&rdquo; Travis asked watching her closely.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, just slightly in pain.&rdquo; Tegan looked up at Sebastian and her heart raced even more as his blue eyes watched her every move. </p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t keep you long, I just wanted to see how you were doing? I can give you some extra time if you haven&rsquo;t completed the assignments?&rdquo; Sebastian watched Tegan smile towards him as it left him weak in the knees. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh no, I finished the assignments, last night Professor.&rdquo; Tegan opened her bag to retrieve the three essays that had been completed. She looked up and handed them to him. The moment their hands touched, a simple spark shot through them. Tegan immediately retrieved her hand back the moment Sebastian took the essays unsure if he felt it as well. &ldquo;I was going to have Travis turn them at the end. Just couldn&rsquo;t really make it down there.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it. I don&rsquo;t want to keep you any longer than you have to. Just don&rsquo;t overdo it alright and take care of yourself.&rdquo; With that Sebastian quickly walked out of the class, stuffing his hand in his jacket. A small tingle radiating through his hand up towards the arm. </p><p><i>&ldquo;Had she felt that as well?&rdquo; </i>Sebastian wondered walking back to his office. </p><hr /><p>Tegan just watched as Sebastian left the room wondering what just happened. The look on Travis&rsquo; face said everything as Tegan looked up at him. &ldquo;What was that T?&rdquo; Travis asked as he helped her up.</p><p>&ldquo;No fucking clue but whatever it was, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. There is no way I could ever fall for Sebastian.&rdquo; Just than Tegan heard her phone go off and saw it was a message from Jay saying he was there. &ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s get out of here.&rdquo; Both of them left the classroom with Tegan unsure of what the hell had just happened.</p><hr /><p>&ldquo;Dinner smells amazing Daphne.&rdquo; Jay smiled as they had unloaded the rest of the boxes. The most essential items went up towards Tegan&rsquo;s room and the rest had gone in the garage. Tegan was sprawled out on the couch watching some crime TV show - Criminal Minds. </p><p>&ldquo;Thank you. Why don&rsquo;t both of you go get cleaned up cause dinner is almost ready.&rdquo; Daphne watched as the boys placed the remaining boxes down. &ldquo;Tegan! Dinner.&rdquo; </p><p><i>&ldquo;One moment.&rdquo;</i> Tegan&rsquo;s voice shouted from the other room.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, hunnie, why don&rsquo;t we let those two eat dinner in peace,&rdquo; Chris whispered in his girl&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s give them some alone time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nevermind T.&rdquo; Just than Tegan groaned from the other room shouting <i>&ldquo;really?&rdquo; </i>causing both of them to laugh. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey Jay, we are going to eat in the other room and give both of you some time together. &nbsp;Would you mind bringing this to Tegan?&rdquo; Daphne said handing two plates of food to Jay. It was Salmon with mixed vegetables and mashed potatoes.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course. Thank you.&rdquo; Jay smiled as he took the plates and walked over to where Tegan was sitting. His eyes focused on her placing the two plates on the small table in front of them. She was completely lost in the show. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey baby, what would you like to drink?&rdquo; Tegan sat up just a bit and went to stand up but sat right back down. &ldquo;Hey, easy love&rdquo; Tegan took Jay&rsquo;s hands into hers and met his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;What if I say you, would that count,&rdquo; Tegan smirked looking at Jay&rsquo;s reaction causing him to laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;It does my love, but I mean for dinner.&rdquo; Jay bent down and kissed Tegan on the lips. He cupped her chin to pull it closer to him as it captured her lips to his. Jay&rsquo;s tongue slowly massaging hers deepening the kiss. Slowly breaking the kiss, a small smile crept on Jay&rsquo;s face seeing the blush in Tegan&rsquo;s cheeks.</p><p>&ldquo;Water&rdquo; was all the Tegan managed to get out. &ldquo;You got it, babe.&rdquo; With that Jay left the room and returned quickly with drinks in hand. Jay handed her the plate and took his plate. Both of them relaxed on the couch and ate dinner in comforting silence.</p><hr /><p>Jay looked down at Tegan who was in-between his legs, curled up on her side. Placing a kiss on her forehead, he watched as her eyes struggled to stay open. The pain medication was starting to take its effect in helping relieve the pain in her leg. One his hands laced in with her fingers as the other hand started to rub her back lightly helping send her to sleep. His own eyes slowly started to close at the feeling of Tegan in his arms. </p><p>&ldquo;Would either of you&hellip;\"Daphne walked into the room and stopped when she saw both of them asleep on the couch. Just then the doorbell rang with Chris walking in the room to answer it. Daphne grabbed the blanket off the couch and draped it over them. Opening the door, Chris looked in surprise as who was on the opposite side. </p><p><b>It was Sebastian&hellip;</b></p><p><b>Do You See Me Taglist: &nbsp;</b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mW5ssh_HpQSSs4kyjRhe9vA\">@hehurst23</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgSQ8RXPV_K5CBpeHj6cPsw\">@fangirlfiction</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPeJwFWMRmS8pvLzN_lQAWA\">@writing-in-the-impala</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mK5sYAuxIuAF6WSSFLdXNhw\">@emercat</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mARSIftlXw_99S9YvPIZ3MQ\">@cootie06</a>&#8203; // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muqRvbe0mEj95uNt_yVzXuw\">@kyber-hearts-and-stardust-souls</a>&#8203; // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTrt1frH3lYtqeYiaqMLhiA\">@lovejessejay</a>&#8203; // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM3UeVBrk2zdM_9tQRO8Cog\">@canumoveurseatup-no</a>&#8203; // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrg5dyIjtxkXJkfauPnLA6w\">@all1e23</a>&#8203; // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3oVXVm_CJfrBWJsvf7wX4Q\">@buckmesideways22</a>&#8203; // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEc2i1VDavwHiG3zjhY58fw\">@moonriv-er</a>&#8203; // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDBZ6G6dGwaeFSodTIVmV-A\">@cap-evanns</a>&#8203; // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mklkZ0WDDCgHBRbTDgg_EfA\">@cmorgana</a>&#8203; // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mA4_8wswWZ_qSkEMMQ_5V0w\">@givebuckyhisplum</a>&#8203; </p>",

It had been a few days since Tegan been released from the hospital and was going to be coming to class. He had missed seeing her beautiful face in class. It wasn&rsquo;t the same as her seat was empty and then remembering what she had gone through.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s not like he can talk to Chris or Daphne about Tegan. They were barely speaking to him as it is. After the whole thing at the hospital, they basically had shut him out. It&rsquo;s not like he didn&rsquo;t deserve it. Tegan wasn&rsquo;t his girlfriend after all but it didn&rsquo;t stop him from caring even though she was with Jay. Lord, he hated that smug asshole. With the better than thou attitude because he was a cop. It didn&rsquo;t matter what Jay&rsquo;s job was - what mattered was Tegan and her safety. </p>\n<p>If only things were that simple for him but it wasn&rsquo;t when she was with another man. She wasn&rsquo;t with him. The smile on her face or how happy she was around Jay. Her face had just lit up around him. How could he take that away from her and just resent him? No, it was just best to move on and focus on himself. To get rid of the nasty habits and be healthy for once. Maybe fates would be kind to him and someone new would appear. </p>\n<p>Watching as Chris entered his office, they both looked at each other. Chris had dropped his stuff off and left just as quickly. Sebastian needed to talk it out but now wasn&rsquo;t the best time. The class was about to start and needed to head that way. Grabbing his stuff, Sebastian walked out of the office. Several of the female students just smiled towards him and give him those doey eyes they all loved to give him. </p>\n<p>Turning the corner, Sebastian came to a dead stop as his attention focused outside - right in front of him. Seeing the one thing he didn&rsquo;t want to see at all. Just once, he wished things would be in his favor. Who was he kidding? That probably would never happen. All he could do was just watch as sadness took over. </p>\n</p>",
