There is redemption. <br></p><p>Because why bother trying to do better when you can\u2019t find forgiveness? <br></p>",
                "content": "<p>So by now, all of the Daenerys Targaryen fandom has come to the conclusion that Drogon will be bringing her body to Kinvara to be resurrected. There already has been so many parallels between these two characters, I see no reason as to why they can&rsquo;t have this. I don&rsquo;t disagree with this. It makes thematic sense.<br /></p><p>What I do not agree on is what happens next. Many want to see Daenerys burn everything. Have Drogon come back every year and put Winterfell and King&rsquo;s Landing to the ground. And I get <i>why</i> that sentiment exists. Daenerys was given the most raw of raw deals this season. Her heel turn made no sense with her character. It was one of the most gross displays of misogyny, xenophobia, ableism and victim blaming I have seen in modern storytelling. <br /></p><p>And her death scene was even worse. Much and plenty has been said on that, so I won&rsquo;t waste space here. <br /></p><p>I do not want Daenerys to be filled with vengeance when she gets revived. I want to see a path of reconciliation for her. One of the powers of fiction, and indeed something that I love about the Fantasy genre as a whole, is the power of forgiveness and redemption. <br /></p><p>We do not like what D&amp;D did to Daenerys. What she did in &ldquo;The Bells&rdquo; was as Out-of-Character as a character can act. I am not defending that. But if we are going to have a &ldquo;What happens after 8x06&Prime; we NEED to deal with that. And it was that the Targaryen madness DID overwhelm Daenerys in that moment. It it is the only way it makes any sense. <br /></p><p>And Daenerys is revived, and I want to say the taint is no longer there. Daenerys is forced to face what she did. There is no sugar coating it. She cannot pretend it was for the greater good, or she can&rsquo;t rule with small mercies, or any of that bullshit. She went against all of her values and beliefs. <br /></p><p>Daenerys needs to ask herself WHY the Lord of Light brought her back, why he is not done with her. And I think the answer can be found in her speech in 8x06. There is still slavery in the world. And she has to be the one to end it. <br /></p><p>But ultimately, this Daenerys needs to be the one we saw in 8x03. A rescuer, a savior, someone who is horrified by what she did. She was consumed by madness. That is the only explanation. She must find atonement - and the only way she can do that is by ending slavery for good. <br /></p><p>I would say the first major arc has to be all about Daenerys. Jon is not even a major character. She is regathering her allies, forming a new coalition of Unsullied, Dothraki, R&rsquo;hllor zealots and sellswords. And she goes to war against the Free Cities. <br /></p><p>Daenerys is not a conqueror. She is a liberator. And she has to come to terms with that. Let this be her path of redemption. <br /></p><p>And of course, Jon will hear of it. It is narratively unfulfilling if he doesn&rsquo;t. He hears of what she is doing, but he only hears shards and fragments of it. But all he knows is that the woman that murdered hundreds of thousands of innocents is back, alive, with a dragon, and seemingly doing the same thing to the Free Cities. <br /></p><p>So of course he goes to Essos. He has to stop her. For good; <br /></p><p>But, of course, we know that isn&rsquo;t how it works out. There is reconciliation. There is peace found between them. There is redemption. <br /></p><p>Because why bother trying to do better when you can&rsquo;t find forgiveness? <br /></p>",
