You huffed and took a step back\nwhile wiping your tears away.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><b><i>&lsquo;Cause, baby<br/>\nThere&rsquo;s nothing I won&rsquo;t do<br/>\nTo spend my life with you<br/>\nI&rsquo;ll give my all to you</i></b></p><p><b><i><br/>\nI promise that I will never lie to you, boy<br/>\nThere&rsquo;s nothing I won&rsquo;t do<br/>\nTo spend my life with you<br/>\nI&rsquo;ll give my all to you<br/>\nI promise that I will never lie to you, boy</i></b></p><p><b><i>You and me\ntogether<br/>\nPicture perfect</i></b></p><p><b><i><br/>\nI&rsquo;ll spend all my money all my time<br/>\nBecause you&rsquo;re worth it<br/>\nIt&rsquo;s just me and you, you, you<br/>\nWhat you wanna do, do, do?<br/>\nMake a move<br/>\nCall me mama, spoil you like a baby<br/>\nThinking about you, dreaming about you<br/>\nGot me going crazy<br/>\nWhat you wanna do, do, do?<br/></i></b><b><i>Now it&rsquo;s me and you, you, you<br/>\nThe mood, yeah</i></b></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that\u201d you hissed, your body trembling\nfrom the immense pain and anger. Your husband bit his lip, trying to hold in\nthe tears as he took a step forwards and reached his hands out to you, \u201cPlease\nlet me explain\u201d he begged, feeling nauseous that he had brought you to this\npoint.</p><p>\u201cExplain what?!\u201d you burst out, the salty tears\nmaking their way down your cheeks again. \u201cHow you forgot our wedding\nanniversary three times in a row?!\u201d you yelled, not caring how your loud voice echoed\nthrough the mansion.</p><p>Tony bowed his head in shame and clenched his fits\n\u201cHow you keep neglecting me?! Your fucking wife?!\u201d you continued, in desperate\nneed to tell him how you had been feeling the past three years. \u201cHow I clung\nonto your empty promises of making me your priority? How I swallowed all the\npain and disappointment down and continued rooting for you while you never made\nenough time and effort to help and support me with my projects or how you have\nbeen nothing but a shitty husband to me?!\u201d you finished while breathing heavily,\nyours words shattering Tony\u2019s heart into tiny pieces.</p><p>He looked at you, tears streaming down his face\nas he didn\u2019t know what to say. He knew that he wasn\u2019t the perfect husband but\nhaving to hear that he was <b>bad</b>\nhusband left him shocked. He had never seen you hurt and upset. \u201cI-I\u2026\u201d was all\nhe was able to stutter to which you bit your lip before letting out a loud\nsigh.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly how I knew you\u2019d react\u201d you\nmumbled to yourself, now understanding that you were the one who loved the most\nin your marriage, the one who gave their all into it and was willing to make\nthe most sacrifices. </p><p>Without a word, you walked past your husband\nand made your way out of the mansion to your car, not caring about the\npaparazzis taking pictures of you at the gate while screaming tons of questions\nat you. You began to load your suitcases in your car, still not wanting to\nbelieve that your marriage had neared its end and that Tony wasn\u2019t willing to\nfight for it.</p><p>He was still frozen at the front door, not\nwanting to accept that he was the one who had caused you to leave him. When you\ntook the last bag not too far away from him, he snapped out his trance and took\na shaky breath as his heart began to pound in his chest.</p><p>Suddenly, he was filled with determination and\nstormed his way to you, finding you in the middle of closing the trunk of your\ncar. \u201c[Y/N]!\u201d he shouted to which you rolled your eyes but didn\u2019t turn to him.\nTony let out an angry huff before stopping you from getting into the driver\u2019s\nseat by gently pulling you away from your car and holding your hands tightly in\nhis.</p><p>\u201cLet me go\u201d you demanded, too tired and\nheartbroken to cause another scene. Your husband shook his head. \u201cNo. I won\u2019t\nlet our marriage end, especially not this way\u201d his words made you roll your\neyes again, \u201cWow and suddenly you care about your marriage\u201d you mumbled, the\ncomment hurt him deep but you had made a good point.</p><p>\u201cI-I now know that I haven\u2019t been a good\nhusband to you. I had promised to devote myself to you and your dreams and\ncompletely tossed those vows aside while losing myself in my work, but please\nbelieve me when I say that I love you and am willing to do <b>anything </b>for your forgiveness\u201d Tony spoke while staring deeply into\nyour eyes, the intensity of his gaze making you look away and you instantly\nfelt your heart yearning for him again.</p><p>You swallowed hard, \u201cI don\u2019t believe you\u201d you\nconfessed, \u201cYour words don\u2019t mean anything to me anymore. Your actions have\nmade it more than clear that I will never be your priority so just cut this\nbullshit and let me send you divorce papers\u201d you mumbling, your heart painfully\nclenching at your last words.</p><p>\u201cNo\u201d Tony hissed, the mere thought of not\nhaving you in his life anymore making him sick to the stomach. He was breathing\nheavily, normally he was able to get you to stop being mad at him by taking you\nout or showering you with lots of gifts and flowers. But no amount of gifts and\nfancy date were able to undo the damage he had caused in your heart.</p><p>He didn\u2019t stop gazing deeply into your eyes\nwhile slowly kneeling down in front of you, his action made you furrow your\neyebrows in confusion. \u201cGet up\u201d you demanded to which your husband shook his\nhead. \u201cNo, I need to show you how sorry I am for breaking your heart. For\nmaking you feel unloved and neglected. To show you that you are the love of my\nlife and my priority\u201d.</p><p>In that moment, you didn\u2019t care that you were being\nphotographed and probably would be making the headlines the following day, this\nwas something Tony had never done before. He wasn\u2019t the one to show his vulnerability\nor admit his mistakes.</p><p>\u201cI am here\u2026on my knees and don\u2019t care what\nanybody has to say, [Y/N]. I love you so much and don\u2019t want you to leave me. I\npromise, <b>truly promise</b> that I will\nfix our marriage and keep you happy for the rest of my life if you find it in\nyour caring heart to give me another chance\u201d his words made you swallow hard as\nyou believed every word he said.</p><p>You let out a long sigh and bit your lip, thinking\nabout the pros and cons of giving Tony another chance. He didn\u2019t move,\npatiently gave you the time to think about his proposition while mouthing \u201cI\nlove you\u201d, making your heart flutter in your chest.</p><p>\u201cOkay\u201d was all you mumbled, willing to forgive him\nand move forwards. Your husband quickly stood up and captured your lips in a\npassionate kiss that made your head spin and release you from all the pain you\nhad been feeling. He poured all his love for you in that kiss and you let it\nrush through your body.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go inside\u201d Tony whispered after pulling\naway and quickly glancing at the paparazzis, you nodded your head and quickly\nrushed back into the mansion with your husband right behind you. \u201cHappy will\ntake care of the suitcases\u201d was all he said before crashing his lips

Your fucking wife?!\u201d you continued, in desperate\nneed to tell him how you had been feeling the past three years. \u201cHow I clung\nonto your empty promises of making me your priority?

He knew that he wasn\u2019t the perfect husband but\nhaving to hear that he was <b>bad</b>\nhusband left him shocked. He had never seen you hurt and upset. \u201cI-I\u2026\u201d was all\nhe was able to stutter to which you bit your lip before letting out a loud\nsigh.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly how I knew you\u2019d react\u201d you\nmumbled to yourself, now understanding that you were the one who loved the most\nin your marriage, the one who gave their all into it and was willing to make\nthe most sacrifices. </p><p>Without a word, you walked past your husband\nand made your way out of the mansion to your car, not caring about the\npaparazzis taking pictures of you at the gate while screaming tons of questions\nat you. You began to load your suitcases in your car, still not wanting to\nbelieve that your marriage had neared its end and that Tony wasn\u2019t willing to\nfight for it.</p><p>He was still frozen at the front door, not\nwanting to accept that he was the one who had caused you to leave him. When you\ntook the last bag not too far away from him, he snapped out his trance and took\na shaky breath as his heart began to pound in his chest.</p><p>Suddenly, he was filled with determination and\nstormed his way to you, finding you in the middle of closing the trunk of your\ncar. \u201c[Y/N]!\u201d he shouted to which you rolled your eyes but didn\u2019t turn to him.\nTony let out an angry huff before stopping you from getting into the driver\u2019s\nseat by gently pulling you away from your car and holding your hands tightly in\nhis.</p><p>\u201cLet me go\u201d you demanded, too tired and\nheartbroken to cause another scene. Your husband shook his head. \u201cNo. I won\u2019t\nlet our marriage end, especially not this way\u201d his words made you roll your\neyes again, \u201cWow and suddenly you care about your marriage\u201d you mumbled, the\ncomment hurt him deep but you had made a good point.</p><p>\u201cI-I now know that I haven\u2019t been a good\nhusband to you. I had promised to devote myself to you and your dreams and\ncompletely tossed those vows aside while losing myself in my work, but please\nbelieve me when I say that I love you and am willing to do <b>anything </b>for your forgiveness\u201d Tony spoke while staring deeply into\nyour eyes, the intensity of his gaze making you look away and you instantly\nfelt your heart yearning for him again.</p><p>You swallowed hard, \u201cI don\u2019t believe you\u201d you\nconfessed, \u201cYour words don\u2019t mean anything to me anymore. Your actions have\nmade it more than clear that I will never be your priority so just cut this\nbullshit and let me send you divorce papers\u201d you mumbling, your heart painfully\nclenching at your last words.</p><p>\u201cNo\u201d Tony hissed, the mere thought of not\nhaving you in his life anymore making him sick to the stomach. He was breathing\nheavily, normally he was able to get you to stop being mad at him by taking you\nout or showering you with lots of gifts and flowers. But no amount of gifts and\nfancy date were able to undo the damage he had caused in your heart.</p><p>He didn\u2019t stop gazing deeply into your eyes\nwhile slowly kneeling down in front of you, his action made you furrow your\neyebrows in confusion. \u201cGet up\u201d you demanded to which your husband shook his\nhead. \u201cNo, I need to show you how sorry I am for breaking your heart. For\nmaking you feel unloved and neglected. To show you that you are the love of my\nlife and my priority\u201d.</p><p>In that moment, you didn\u2019t care that you were being\nphotographed and probably would be making the headlines the following day, this\nwas something Tony had never done before. He wasn\u2019t the one to show his vulnerability\nor admit his mistakes.</p><p>\u201cI am here\u2026on my knees and don\u2019t care what\nanybody has to say, [Y/N]. I love you so much and don\u2019t want you to leave me. I\npromise, <b>truly promise</b> that I will\nfix our marriage and keep you happy for the rest of my life if you find it in\nyour caring heart to give me another chance\u201d his words made you swallow hard as\nyou believed every word he said.</p><p>You let out a long sigh and bit your lip, thinking\nabout the pros and cons of giving Tony another chance. He didn\u2019t move,\npatiently gave you the time to think about his proposition while mouthing \u201cI\nlove you\u201d, making your heart flutter in your chest.</p><p>\u201cOkay\u201d was all you mumbled, willing to forgive him\nand move forwards. Your husband quickly stood up and captured your lips in a\npassionate kiss that made your head spin and release you from all the pain you\nhad been feeling. He poured all his love for you in that kiss and you let it\nrush through your body.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go inside\u201d Tony whispered after pulling\naway and quickly glancing at the paparazzis, you nodded your head and quickly\nrushed back into the mansion with your husband right behind you. \u201cHappy will\ntake care of the suitcases\u201d was all he said before crashing his lips against\nyours while picking you up, carrying you up the stairs to your shared bedroom.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><b><i>I mean\neverything that I say<br>\nFrom the bottom of my heart<br>\nI will never,

Your husband bit his lip, trying to hold in\nthe tears as he took a step forwards and reached his hands out to you, \u201cPlease\nlet me explain\u201d he begged, feeling nauseous that he had brought you to this\npoint.</p><p>\u201cExplain what?!\u201d you burst out, the salty tears\nmaking their way down your cheeks again. \u201cHow you forgot our wedding\nanniversary three times in a row?!\u201d you yelled, not caring how your loud voice echoed\nthrough the mansion.</p><p>Tony bowed his head in shame and clenched his fits\n\u201cHow you keep neglecting me?! Your fucking wife?!\u201d you continued, in desperate\nneed to tell him how you had been feeling the past three years. \u201cHow I clung\nonto your empty promises of making me your priority? How I swallowed all the\npain and disappointment down and continued rooting for you while you never made\nenough time and effort to help and support me with my projects or how you have\nbeen nothing but a shitty husband to me?!\u201d you finished while breathing heavily,\nyours words shattering Tony\u2019s heart into tiny pieces.</p><p>He looked at you, tears streaming down his face\nas he didn\u2019t know what to say. He knew that he wasn\u2019t the perfect husband but\nhaving to hear that he was <b>bad</b>\nhusband left him shocked. He had never seen you hurt and upset. \u201cI-I\u2026\u201d was all\nhe was able to stutter to which you bit your lip before letting out a loud\nsigh.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly how I knew you\u2019d react\u201d you\nmumbled to yourself, now understanding that you were the one who loved the most\nin your marriage, the one who gave their all into it and was willing to make\nthe most sacrifices. </p><p>Without a word, you walked past your husband\nand made your way out of the mansion to your car, not caring about the\npaparazzis taking pictures of you at the gate while screaming tons of questions\nat you. You began to load your suitcases in your car, still not wanting to\nbelieve that your marriage had neared its end and that Tony wasn\u2019t willing to\nfight for it.</p><p>He was still frozen at the front door, not\nwanting to accept that he was the one who had caused you to leave him. When you\ntook the last bag not too far away from him, he snapped out his trance and took\na shaky breath as his heart began to pound in his chest.</p><p>Suddenly, he was filled with determination and\nstormed his way to you, finding you in the middle of closing the trunk of your\ncar. \u201c[Y/N]!\u201d he shouted to which you rolled your eyes but didn\u2019t turn to him.\nTony let out an angry huff before stopping you from getting into the driver\u2019s\nseat by gently pulling you away from your car and holding your hands tightly in\nhis.</p><p>\u201cLet me go\u201d you demanded, too tired and\nheartbroken to cause another scene. Your husband shook his head. \u201cNo. I won\u2019t\nlet our marriage end, especially not this way\u201d his words made you roll your\neyes again, \u201cWow and suddenly you care about your marriage\u201d you mumbled, the\ncomment hurt him deep but you had made a good point.</p><p>\u201cI-I now know that I haven\u2019t been a good\nhusband to you. I had promised to devote myself to you and your dreams and\ncompletely tossed those vows aside while losing myself in my work, but please\nbelieve me when I say that I love you and am willing to do <b>anything </b>for your forgiveness\u201d Tony spoke while staring deeply into\nyour eyes, the intensity of his gaze making you look away and you instantly\nfelt your heart yearning for him again.</p><p>You swallowed hard, \u201cI don\u2019t believe you\u201d you\nconfessed, \u201cYour words don\u2019t mean anything to me anymore. Your actions have\nmade it more than clear that I will never be your priority so just cut this\nbullshit and let me send you divorce papers\u201d you mumbling, your heart painfully\nclenching at your last words.</p><p>\u201cNo\u201d Tony hissed, the mere thought of not\nhaving you in his life anymore making him sick to the stomach. He was breathing\nheavily, normally he was able to get you to stop being mad at him by taking you\nout or showering you with lots of gifts and flowers. But no amount of gifts and\nfancy date were able to undo the damage he had caused in your heart.</p><p>He didn\u2019t stop gazing deeply into your eyes\nwhile slowly kneeling down in front of you, his action made you furrow your\neyebrows in confusion. \u201cGet up\u201d you demanded to which your husband shook his\nhead. \u201cNo, I need to show you how sorry I am for breaking your heart. For\nmaking you feel unloved and neglected. To show you that you are the love of my\nlife and my priority\u201d.</p><p>In that moment, you didn\u2019t care that you were being\nphotographed and probably would be making the headlines the following day, this\nwas something Tony had never done before. He wasn\u2019t the one to show his vulnerability\nor admit his mistakes.</p><p>\u201cI am here\u2026on my knees and don\u2019t care what\nanybody has to say, [Y/N]. I love you so much and don\u2019t want you to leave me. I\npromise, <b>truly promise</b> that I will\nfix our marriage and keep you happy for the rest of my life if you find it in\nyour caring heart to give me another chance\u201d his words made you swallow hard as\nyou believed every word he said.</p><p>You let out a long sigh and bit your lip, thinking\nabout the pros and cons of giving Tony another chance. He didn\u2019t move,\npatiently gave you the time to think about his proposition while mouthing \u201cI\nlove you\u201d, making your heart flutter in your chest.</p><p>\u201cOkay\u201d was all you mumbled, willing to forgive him\nand move forwards. Your husband quickly stood up and captured your lips in a\npassionate kiss that made your head spin and release you from all the pain you\nhad been feeling. He poured all his love for you in that kiss and you let it\nrush through your body.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go inside\u201d Tony whispered after pulling\naway and quickly glancing at the paparazzis, you nodded your head and quickly\nrushed back into the mansion with your husband right behind you. \u201cHappy will\ntake care of the suitcases\u201d was all he said before crashing his lips against\nyours while picking you up, carrying you up the stairs to your shared bedroom.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><b><i>I mean\neverything that I say<br>\nFrom the bottom of my heart<br>\nI will never,

It only made you huff out in anger &ldquo;Only shows how devoted\nI was to our marriage&rdquo; you whispered before zipping the suitcase up and\nstorming your way out of the bedroom again.</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark is pulling into the driveway&rdquo; F.R.I.D.A.Y\ninformed you, making your heart drop to the pit of your stomach upon realizing that\npacking your belongings (while screaming and crying) had taken you longer than expected.\n&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call me that&rdquo; you hissed and rushed your way to the front door, hoping\nthat you&rsquo;d be able to get to your car with your suitcase and leave your husband\nfor good.</p><p>&ldquo;Baby&rdquo; Tony said while storming into the\nmansion, so much regret and shame clouding his eyes when he almost tripped over\nyour suitcases before looking at you. His heart dropped to the pit of his stomach,\nrealizing that he had messed up really bad. You huffed and took a step back\nwhile wiping your tears away.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b><i>&lsquo;Cause, baby<br />\nThere&rsquo;s nothing I won&rsquo;t do<br />\nTo spend my life with you<br />\nI&rsquo;ll give my all to you</i></b></p><p><b><i><br />\nI promise that I will never lie to you, boy<br />\nThere&rsquo;s nothing I won&rsquo;t do<br />\nTo spend my life with you<br />\nI&rsquo;ll give my all to you<br />\nI promise that I will never lie to you, boy</i></b></p><p><b><i>You and me\ntogether<br />\nPicture perfect</i></b></p><p><b><i><br />\nI&rsquo;ll spend all my money all my time<br />\nBecause you&rsquo;re worth it<br />\nIt&rsquo;s just me and you, you, you<br />\nWhat you wanna do, do, do?<br />\nMake a move<br />\nCall me mama, spoil you like a baby<br />\nThinking about you, dreaming about you<br />\nGot me going crazy<br />\nWhat you wanna do, do, do?<br /></i></b><b><i>Now it&rsquo;s me and you, you, you<br />\nThe mood, yeah</i></b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call me that&rdquo; you hissed, your body trembling\nfrom the immense pain and anger. Your husband bit his lip, trying to hold in\nthe tears as he took a step forwards and reached his hands out to you, &ldquo;Please\nlet me explain&rdquo; he begged, feeling nauseous that he had brought you to this\npoint.</p><p>&ldquo;Explain what?!&rdquo; you burst out, the salty tears\nmaking their way down your cheeks again. &ldquo;How you forgot our wedding\nanniversary three times in a row?!&rdquo; you yelled, not caring how your loud voice echoed\nthrough the mansion.</p><p>Tony bowed his head in shame and clenched his fits\n&ldquo;How you keep neglecting me?! Your fucking wife?!&rdquo; you continued, in desperate\nneed to tell him how you had been feeling the past three years. &ldquo;How I clung\nonto your empty promises of making me your priority? How I swallowed all the\npain and disappointment down and continued rooting for you while you never made\nenough time and effort to help and support me with my projects or how you have\nbeen nothing but a shitty husband to me?!&rdquo; you finished while breathing heavily,\nyours words shattering Tony&rsquo;s heart into tiny pieces.</p><p>He looked at you, tears streaming down his face\nas he didn&rsquo;t know what to say. He knew that he wasn&rsquo;t the perfect husband but\nhaving to hear that he was <b>bad</b>\nhusband left him shocked. He had never seen you hurt and upset. &ldquo;I-I&hellip;&rdquo; was all\nhe was able to stutter to which you bit your lip before letting out a loud\nsigh.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly how I knew you&rsquo;d react&rdquo; you\nmumbled to yourself, now understanding that you were the one who loved the most\nin your marriage, the one who gave their all into it and was willing to make\nthe most sacrifices. </p><p>Without a word, you walked past your husband\nand made your way out of the mansion to your car, not caring about the\npaparazzis taking pictures of you at the gate while screaming tons of questions\nat you. You began to load your suitcases in your car, still not wanting to\nbelieve that your marriage had neared its end and that Tony wasn&rsquo;t willing to\nfight for it.</p><p>He was still frozen at the front door, not\nwanting to accept that he was the one who had caused you to leave him. When you\ntook the last bag not too far away from him, he snapped out his trance and took\na shaky breath as his heart began to pound in his chest.</p><p>Suddenly, he was filled with determination and\nstormed his way to you, finding you in the middle of closing the trunk of your\ncar. &ldquo;[Y/N]!&rdquo; he shouted to which you rolled your eyes but didn&rsquo;t turn to him.\nTony let out an angry huff before stopping you from getting into the driver&rsquo;s\nseat by gently pulling you away from your car and holding your hands tightly in\nhis.</p><p>&ldquo;Let me go&rdquo; you demanded, too tired and\nheartbroken to cause another scene. Your husband shook his head. &ldquo;No. I won&rsquo;t\nlet our marriage end, especially not this way&rdquo; his words made you roll your\neyes again, &ldquo;Wow and suddenly you care about your marriage&rdquo; you mumbled, the\ncomment hurt him deep but you had made a good point.</p><p>&ldquo;I-I now know that I haven&rsquo;t been a good\nhusband to you. I had promised to devote myself to you and your dreams and\ncompletely tossed those vows aside while losing myself in my work, but please\nbelieve me when I say that I love you and am willing to do <b>anything </b>for your forgiveness&rdquo; Tony spoke while staring deeply into\nyour eyes, the intensity of his gaze making you look away and you instantly\nfelt your heart yearning for him again.</p><p>You swallowed hard, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you&rdquo; you\nconfessed, &ldquo;Your words don&rsquo;t mean anything to me anymore. Your actions have\nmade it more than clear that I will never be your priority so just cut this\nbullshit and let me send you divorce papers&rdquo; you mumbling, your heart painfully\nclenching at your last words.</p><p>&ldquo;No&rdquo; Tony hissed, the mere thought of not\nhaving you in his life anymore making him sick to the stomach. He was breathing\nheavily, normally he was able to get you to stop being mad at him by taking you\nout or showering you with lots of gifts and flowers. But no amount of gifts and\nfancy date were able to undo the damage he had caused in your heart.</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t stop gazing deeply into your eyes\nwhile slowly kneeling down in front of you, his action made you furrow your\neyebrows in confusion. &ldquo;Get up&rdquo; you demanded to which your husband shook his\nhead. &ldquo;No, I need to show you how sorry I am for breaking your heart. For\nmaking you feel unloved and neglected. To show you that you are the love of my\nlife and my priority&rdquo;.</p><p>In that moment, you didn&rsquo;t care that you were being\nphotographed and probably would be making the headlines the following day, this\nwas something Tony had never done before. He wasn&rsquo;t the one to show his vulnerability\nor admit his mistakes.</p><p>&ldquo;I am here&hellip;on my knees and don&rsquo;t care what\nanybody has to say, [Y/N]. I love you so much and don&rsquo;t want you to leave me. I\npromise, <b>truly promise</b> that I will\nfix our marriage and keep you happy for the rest of my life if you find it in\nyour caring heart to give me another chance&rdquo; his words made you swallow hard as\nyou believed every word he said.</p><p>You let out a long sigh and bit your lip, thinking\nabout the pros and cons of giving Tony another chance. He didn&rsquo;t move,\npatiently gave you the time to think about his proposition while mouthing &ldquo;I\nlove you&rdquo;, making your heart flutter in your chest.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay&rdquo; was all you mumbled, willing to forgive him\nand move forwards. Your husband quickly stood up and captured your lips in a\npassionate kiss that made your head spin and release you from all the pain you\nhad been feeling. He poured all his love for you in that kiss and you let it\nrush through your body.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go inside&rdquo; Tony whispered after pulling\naway and quickly glancing at the paparazzis, you nodded your head and quickly\nrushed back into the mansion with your husband right behind you. &ldquo;Happy will\ntake care of the suitcases&rdquo; was all he said before crashing his lips against\nyours while picking you up, carrying you up the stairs to your shared bedroom.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b><i>I mean\neverything that I say<br />\nFrom the bottom of my heart<br />\nI will never, never, ever hurt you<br />\nI open my hea</i></b></p><p><b><i>rt</i></b></p><p><b><i>Open my\nheart<br />\nGive it to you<br />\nTell the whole world that I&rsquo;m in love with you<br />\nWhatever you want<br />\nBaby, I&rsquo;ll do<br />\nI know I don&rsquo;t want nobody else but you</i></b></p><p><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></p><p><b><i>'Cause, baby<br />\nThere&rsquo;s nothing I won&rsquo;t do<br />\nTo spend my life with you<br />\nI&rsquo;ll give my all to you<br />\nI promise that I will never lie to you, boy<br />\nThere&rsquo;s nothing I won&rsquo;t do<br />\nTo spend my life with you<br />\nI&rsquo;ll give my all to you<br />\nI promise that I will never lie to you, boy</i></b></p><p><b><br /></b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/477ecdffafeb8c727a90c77189dcf1f0/tumblr_inline_pguo75ThJy1u76kd4_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><b>Tag list:</b> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-ixtvXWYRjnPY2ci_2H2Qw\">@jamesbarnesappreciationsociety</a> &nbsp;l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQCv_74CjwaS_PEJtleKI2w\">@pleasantdreamqueen</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQiukMVK06i8gIuZSqag8mA\">@disneymarina</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNB1xtSDi3hrnJb7JSXSqjw\">@koizorahana</a> l l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSV8_iEBdIrspRVXhUIecAQ\">@harleycativy</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5kibQ7TNYx1stzpzh32BMg\">@itik-angsa</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzsOy9niPmjfbhYBqyd6a0A\">@sparklemichele</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmWqMeYCqqMUafaMHnY8dXw\">@melaninmarvel</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfx0H27xwRpt5M_Ep0dFZLw\">@amethyst09</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJxr6NB8iL5fXWCB-cS1LfQ\">@the-force-of-imagines</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mg3swgy8PaF_CfpMMhG4ieQ\">@bossyboyd03</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mk3jCyvsf1lt6d99fG6cH6A\">@enigmaticaphrodite</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwF_faTuWcK9bOxjdhVr6sw\">@pebblesz892</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZdtIjIxEP6UZvjeYFzalzg\">@stars8melanin</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mH7xZfPLDjciBP2SWY0sT6A\">@brittyevans</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYgWr4jFi0fiJTuUKxtqzyw\">@toc1985</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-7P3-Sw9RWpGbn5Hx4MI5Q\">@janeyboo</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mq3cy1j5dCpdq9OpT4x3Ukw\">@badassbaker</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbOe8MT7EHcTjkfLSvti90Q\">@earthtocynthia</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRxOV1HZZiJw1Ecc5XMEUFQ\">@lafayettes-baguettes-1</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQ-__xYtl9MJjmKJU87F0ag\">@winters-beauty</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muI5pmOUaX6wvmS3rzWyaFg\">@cannonindeez</a> &nbsp;l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mW3rG8OGU5z0bF7hpc7GGtw\">@ilovefanfic86</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRFGeUKdsFmQbN20Im6B6wA\">@foureyedsiopao</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzpa6VC140Rh0xuV3KKzQfw\">@adorablespecialsnowflakes</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAbNjFuFx4LjGdpSDYiuvDg\">@brittanyovens</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcRxn7YLseanjYhB44PCesg\">@kanupps06</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbMPhxGtiyvS6lRzoCLKblA\">@jazmynejack</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mg1Cop7_uIHrZgAe6F08DCg\">@oliviajmarvel</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mE075uYL8GhDerMZHu47cCg\">@thebookwormslytherin</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkT23YitSkT0OnrVoJy-tzw\">@theunsweetenedtruth</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvFEAzWXUrcNrMxyFoephgw\">@talannalew</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m28vjCOlX587TUhd2Aim0qA\">@littlexmissxfandomxlover</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqOGfTW0AeSA1n8vLZ7u_Lw\">@amethyst-dreams-and-candy-canes</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvRECilFLSOv3BsRCElrGyA\">@dedebebe13</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mS-aQBYqOd3zetPMpAAC5pA\">@challaxkillmonger</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkwo5DwDq-3uHkvig2KjGDQ\">@crimsonash330</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcJYqpLTihsHWwFk501mJwA\">@booklover2929</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mx1AA7Td8Po7vnEjirLLZog\">@aranelgrey</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mB0YQZZqvad5zaWBRzLWiLA\">@panda-duuu</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbzINLfv17mQRDzuIowmuaA\">@thisismysecrethappyplace</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msM0ovIDtcyyW_zok4fAuhg\">@killmonsgyal</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCNbfAm2afBUpNhZjTec9sQ\">@lokislilcaribbeanprincess</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9nHaXHEK2rAR_IE_wt-3Yg\">@titty-teetee</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_P1wub5l9MWmCc3Rlzq3kg\">@honey-anon</a> l <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mS-aQBYqOd3zetPMpAAC5pA\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mS-aQBYqOd3zetPMpAAC5pA\">@queenxchallaxkillamonger</a></p><p>-Emma &#128139;&#10084;&#65039;</p></p>",

She took a gasping breath, trying to sit up. She was on a helicopter. </p><p>&ldquo;Stay still.&rdquo; Sam murmured from somewhere outside of her line of vision. She twisted her head around to see him sitting in a chair, his arms strapped down and his wrists cuffed together. She spotted Scott Lang, Wanda, and Clint sitting next to him, restrained in similar ways. </p><p>Jet opened her mouth to say something but Sam shook his head. </p><p>&ldquo;Shhh.&rdquo; Sam whispered. Jet nodded and she drifted back to sleep. </p><p>When she woke back up,  someone was carrying her. She tried to move, but her body screamed in pain. She opened her eyes and saw it was an armed guard carrying her. Sam walked in front of her, lead by another guard. </p><p>&ldquo;Sir, she&rsquo;s awake.&rdquo; The guard carrying her said as they entered a white room. Her friends were led to separate cells and the doors were locked. </p><p>&ldquo;Get her restrained.&rdquo; Sergeant Ross ordered. Two other guards walked forward and grabbed hold of Jet&rsquo;s arms as the other carrying her set her down. With no intent of being gentle, the guards held her still as her wrists were cuffed together and her ankles were chained. </p><p>A black strap was wrapped around her shoulders and tightened around her wings. She let out a cry as she felt her bones crack under the restraint. Another strap went around her waist and tightened around the bottom part of her wings. </p><p>&ldquo;Let her go! You&rsquo;re hurting her!&rdquo; Sam shouted from his cell, banging a fist against the glass. </p><p>&ldquo;Take her to the lab.&rdquo; Ross instructed. Jet was dragged from the cell block as she struggled against her restraints. </p><p>&ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo; She screamed. She locked eyes with Sam just before the doors closed. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be okay, Jet!&rdquo; He called after her. But both of them highly doubted that. </p><p>***</p><p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Jet?&rdquo; Tony asked, his eyes wandering\u00a0 around the cell block. There was one empty cell next to Clint and Wanda. Tony turned back to Sam, whose held tilted to the side, his arms crossed.</p><p>&ldquo;Where do you think?&rdquo; Sam snapped. &ldquo;Do you really think that they\u2019d leave a scientific marvel like her alone?&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s face paled. </p><p>&ldquo;I told them not to touch her.&rdquo; He said, feeling like he was trying to reassure himself more than Sam. </p><p>&ldquo;And yet where were you when we were all forced to watch them tie her wings down and drag her to the lab, listening to her screaming the whole way.&rdquo; Tony didn&rsquo;t speak so Sam continued, &ldquo;we told her she would be fine. That even though we were caught, you wouldn&rsquo;t let a 15 year old girl get locked up. But I guess we misjudged you.&rdquo;</p><p>***</p><p>Tony sat alone in a dimly lit room, his arms crossed as he anxiously tapped his foot. The door opened and he looked up. A guard had a tight hold on Jet&rsquo;s arm, pulling her into the room. She was still bruised and bloodied from the battle even though that was over a week ago. Her wrists were cuffed and a long chain connected them to her ankles, which were also cuffed. Her wings were forcibly folded tightly against her back and held down with two thick black straps. </p><p>The guard forced her down into the chair across from Tony. Without a nod to Tony, the guard left, closing the door behind him. Tony sighed and locked eyes with Jet. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey kid.&rdquo; He whispered. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey.&rdquo; She answered, breaking their eye contact and looking down. </p><p>&ldquo;What did they do to you?&rdquo; He asked. Jet, without moving her head, looked over to the camera in the upper corner of the room. Tony smirked. </p><p>&ldquo;I hacked the system. Muted the audio and looped the footage.&rdquo; Jet looked up at him. </p><p>&ldquo;Then they&rsquo;ll come back in here.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Bolted the door. Now tell me, what have they done?&rdquo; Tony pressed. </p><p>&ldquo;Why would you care?&rdquo; Jet spat, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re the one who got me locked up in the first place.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I told them to keep you safe. This isn&rsquo;t what I had in mind.&rdquo; Tony explained. Jet scoffed and sat back, but winced as her wings made contact with the back of the chair. </p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help you if you don&rsquo;t tell me what they did.&rdquo; Tony added quieter. He could see the exhaustion in Jet&rsquo;s eyes, as if she hadn&rsquo;t slept since she got here.

His fists were clenched and his face held a permanent glare. The second his doors opened, he swore he would kill every last person who hurt the winged girl. Jet sighed. </p><p>&ldquo;Nothing this time.&rdquo; She whispered back. &ldquo;Tony wanted to see me.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Stark&rsquo;s here?&rdquo; Sam spat. He was the reason Jet was even in this mess. Jet merely nodded. </p><p>&ldquo;What did he want?&rdquo; Clint asked, leaning against the glass. Jet shrugged slightly, not wanting the camera&rsquo;s to hear what Tony was actually doing. Clint didn\u2019t press for information, pushing himself off the glass and sitting down on his bed. Sam remained standing, pacing back and forth.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d Wanda asked. Jet looked over to the other girl\u2019s cell block. She looked tired and her hair hung limp against her shoulders. Like Jet, Wanda remained bound. The others were free to roam around their cells, while Wanda was restricted in a straight jacket. Jet would\u2019ve worn a straight jacket too, only it didn\u2019t fit over her wings.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d Jet responded. Wanda sent her a pointed look.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re not.\u201d She said. Jet didn\u2019t say anything, pulling herself up onto her bed and laying down on her side. She drifted into an uneasy sleep, her body screaming in pain.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>Tony tapped his fingers against the metal table impatiently waiting for Secretary Ross.

We may have done a few blood tests, but that\u2019t all!\u201d He said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m willing to strike a deal with you, Ross. So that Jet can go free, and you won\u2019t have to worry about her acting out again.\u201d Tony said, sitting down.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>Jet woke up with a start as her cell door was being unlocked. Sitting up, she cowered in the corner of her bed, hoping that maybe this once, they weren\u2019t going to hurt her. The door swung open and Tony stood there.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCome on, kid.

She took a gasping breath, trying to sit up. She was on a helicopter. </p><p>\u201cStay still.\u201d Sam murmured from somewhere outside of her line of vision. She twisted her head around to see him sitting in a chair, his arms strapped down and his wrists cuffed together. She spotted Scott Lang, Wanda, and Clint sitting next to him, restrained in similar ways. </p><p>Jet opened her mouth to say something but Sam shook his head. </p><p>\u201cShhh.\u201d Sam whispered. Jet nodded and she drifted back to sleep. </p><p>When she woke back up,  someone was carrying her. She tried to move, but her body screamed in pain. She opened her eyes and saw it was an armed guard carrying her. Sam walked in front of her, lead by another guard. </p><p>\u201cSir, she\u2019s awake.\u201d The guard carrying her said as they entered a white room. Her friends were led to separate cells and the doors were locked. </p><p>\u201cGet her restrained.\u201d Sergeant Ross ordered. Two other guards walked forward and grabbed hold of Jet\u2019s arms as the other carrying her set her down. With no intent of being gentle, the guards held her still as her wrists were cuffed together and her ankles were chained. </p><p>A black strap was wrapped around her shoulders and tightened around her wings. She let out a cry as she felt her bones crack under the restraint. Another strap went around her waist and tightened around the bottom part of her wings. </p><p>\u201cLet her go! You\u2019re hurting her!\u201d Sam shouted from his cell, banging a fist against the glass. </p><p>\u201cTake her to the lab.\u201d Ross instructed. Jet was dragged from the cell block as she struggled against her restraints. </p><p>\u201cLet me go!\u201d She screamed. She locked eyes with Sam just before the doors closed. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be okay, Jet!\u201d He called after her. But both of them highly doubted that. </p><p>***</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Jet?\u201d Tony asked, his eyes wandering\u00a0 around the cell block. There was one empty cell next to Clint and Wanda. Tony turned back to Sam, whose held tilted to the side, his arms crossed.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you think?\u201d Sam snapped. \u201cDo you really think that they\u2019d leave a scientific marvel like her alone?\u201d Tony\u2019s face paled. </p><p>\u201cI told them not to touch her.\u201d He said, feeling like he was trying to reassure himself more than Sam. </p><p>\u201cAnd yet where were you when we were all forced to watch them tie her wings down and drag her to the lab, listening to her screaming the whole way.\u201d Tony didn\u2019t speak so Sam continued, \u201cwe told her she would be fine. That even though we were caught, you wouldn\u2019t let a 15 year old girl get locked up. But I guess we misjudged you.\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>Tony sat alone in a dimly lit room, his arms crossed as he anxiously tapped his foot. The door opened and he looked up. A guard had a tight hold on Jet\u2019s arm, pulling her into the room. She was still bruised and bloodied from the battle even though that was over a week ago. Her wrists were cuffed and a long chain connected them to her ankles, which were also cuffed. Her wings were forcibly folded tightly against her back and held down with two thick black straps. </p><p>The guard forced her down into the chair across from Tony. Without a nod to Tony, the guard left, closing the door behind him. Tony sighed and locked eyes with Jet. </p><p>\u201cHey kid.\u201d He whispered. </p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d She answered, breaking their eye contact and looking down. </p><p>\u201cWhat did they do to you?\u201d He asked. Jet, without moving her head, looked over to the camera in the upper corner of the room. Tony smirked. </p><p>\u201cI hacked the system.

Now tell me, what have they done?\u201d Tony pressed. </p><p>\u201cWhy would you care?\u201d Jet spat, \u201cyou\u2019re the one who got me locked up in the first place.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI told them to keep you safe. This isn\u2019t what I had in mind.\u201d Tony explained. Jet scoffed and sat back, but winced as her wings made contact with the back of the chair. </p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help you if you don\u2019t tell me what they did.\u201d Tony added quieter. He could see the exhaustion in Jet\u2019s eyes, as if she hadn\u2019t slept since she got here.

Jet merely nodded. </p><p>\u201cWhat did he want?\u201d Clint asked, leaning against the glass. Jet shrugged slightly, not wanting the camera\u2019s to hear what Tony was actually doing. Clint didn\u2019t press for information, pushing himself off the glass and sitting down on his bed. Sam remained standing, pacing back and forth.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d Wanda asked. Jet looked over to the other girl\u2019s cell block. She looked tired and her hair hung limp against her shoulders. Like Jet, Wanda remained bound. The others were free to roam around their cells, while Wanda was restricted in a straight jacket. Jet would\u2019ve worn a straight jacket too, only it didn\u2019t fit over her wings.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d Jet responded. Wanda sent her a pointed look.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re not.\u201d She said. Jet didn\u2019t say anything, pulling herself up onto her bed and laying down on her side. She drifted into an uneasy sleep, her body screaming in pain.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>Tony tapped his fingers against the metal table impatiently waiting for Secretary Ross. The gray haired man walked in and Tony stood up.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI want you to release Jet.\u201d He demanded.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a criminal. Along with everyone else here.\u201d Ross answered, shutting the door.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a child!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t change anything.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat still doesn\u2019t constitute experimentation.\u201d Tony said through clenched teeth.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t done any-\u201d Tony slammed his fist against the table.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me! Jet told me as much.\u201d Ross held his hands up in surrender.</p><p>\u201cAlright, alright. We may have done a few blood tests, but that\u2019t all!\u201d He said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m willing to strike a deal with you, Ross. So that Jet can go free, and you won\u2019t have to worry about her acting out again.\u201d Tony said, sitting down.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>Jet woke up with a start as her cell door was being unlocked. Sitting up, she cowered in the corner of her bed, hoping that maybe this once, they weren\u2019t going to hurt her. The door swung open and Tony stood there.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCome on, kid.

She took a gasping breath, trying to sit up. She was on a helicopter. </p><p>&ldquo;Stay still.&rdquo; Sam murmured from somewhere outside of her line of vision. She twisted her head around to see him sitting in a chair, his arms strapped down and his wrists cuffed together. She spotted Scott Lang, Wanda, and Clint sitting next to him, restrained in similar ways. </p><p>Jet opened her mouth to say something but Sam shook his head. </p><p>&ldquo;Shhh.&rdquo; Sam whispered. Jet nodded and she drifted back to sleep. </p><p>When she woke back up,  someone was carrying her. She tried to move, but her body screamed in pain. She opened her eyes and saw it was an armed guard carrying her. Sam walked in front of her, lead by another guard. </p><p>&ldquo;Sir, she&rsquo;s awake.&rdquo; The guard carrying her said as they entered a white room. Her friends were led to separate cells and the doors were locked. </p><p>&ldquo;Get her restrained.&rdquo; Sergeant Ross ordered. Two other guards walked forward and grabbed hold of Jet&rsquo;s arms as the other carrying her set her down. With no intent of being gentle, the guards held her still as her wrists were cuffed together and her ankles were chained. </p><p>A black strap was wrapped around her shoulders and tightened around her wings. She let out a cry as she felt her bones crack under the restraint. Another strap went around her waist and tightened around the bottom part of her wings. </p><p>&ldquo;Let her go! You&rsquo;re hurting her!&rdquo; Sam shouted from his cell, banging a fist against the glass. </p><p>&ldquo;Take her to the lab.&rdquo; Ross instructed. Jet was dragged from the cell block as she struggled against her restraints. </p><p>&ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo; She screamed. She locked eyes with Sam just before the doors closed. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be okay, Jet!&rdquo; He called after her. But both of them highly doubted that. </p><p>***</p><p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Jet?&rdquo; Tony asked, his eyes wandering&nbsp; around the cell block. There was one empty cell next to Clint and Wanda. Tony turned back to Sam, whose held tilted to the side, his arms crossed.</p><p>&ldquo;Where do you think?&rdquo; Sam snapped. &ldquo;Do you really think that they&rsquo;d leave a scientific marvel like her alone?&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s face paled. </p><p>&ldquo;I told them not to touch her.&rdquo; He said, feeling like he was trying to reassure himself more than Sam. </p><p>&ldquo;And yet where were you when we were all forced to watch them tie her wings down and drag her to the lab, listening to her screaming the whole way.&rdquo; Tony didn&rsquo;t speak so Sam continued, &ldquo;we told her she would be fine. That even though we were caught, you wouldn&rsquo;t let a 15 year old girl get locked up. But I guess we misjudged you.&rdquo;</p><p>***</p><p>Tony sat alone in a dimly lit room, his arms crossed as he anxiously tapped his foot. The door opened and he looked up. A guard had a tight hold on Jet&rsquo;s arm, pulling her into the room. She was still bruised and bloodied from the battle even though that was over a week ago. Her wrists were cuffed and a long chain connected them to her ankles, which were also cuffed. Her wings were forcibly folded tightly against her back and held down with two thick black straps. </p><p>The guard forced her down into the chair across from Tony. Without a nod to Tony, the guard left, closing the door behind him. Tony sighed and locked eyes with Jet. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey kid.&rdquo; He whispered. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey.&rdquo; She answered, breaking their eye contact and looking down. </p><p>&ldquo;What did they do to you?&rdquo; He asked. Jet, without moving her head, looked over to the camera in the upper corner of the room. Tony smirked. </p><p>&ldquo;I hacked the system. Muted the audio and looped the footage.&rdquo; Jet looked up at him. </p><p>&ldquo;Then they&rsquo;ll come back in here.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Bolted the door. Now tell me, what have they done?&rdquo; Tony pressed. </p><p>&ldquo;Why would you care?&rdquo; Jet spat, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re the one who got me locked up in the first place.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I told them to keep you safe. This isn&rsquo;t what I had in mind.&rdquo; Tony explained. Jet scoffed and sat back, but winced as her wings made contact with the back of the chair. </p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help you if you don&rsquo;t tell me what they did.&rdquo; Tony added quieter. He could see the exhaustion in Jet&rsquo;s eyes, as if she hadn&rsquo;t slept since she got here. And she was thinner, not by much, since she was already a rail, but Tony could tell. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s more like what they haven&rsquo;t done.&rdquo; Jet said. Tony nodded for her to continue. Jet sighed. </p><p>&ldquo;My wings are broken. And they won&rsquo;t allow me to stretch them out. Any longer with them held down by these straps and they&rsquo;ll heal wrong. Then I&rsquo;ll be in pain for the rest of my life. And I&rsquo;m covered in injuries that they refuse to look at.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony sat forward, knowing there was something more. </p><p>&ldquo;But they <i>have </i>done<i> </i>something<i>. </i>Haven&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; He pressed. Jet squirmed under his stare and nodded slightly. </p><p>&ldquo;They do&hellip;experiments&hellip; try to test my limits. Since I&rsquo;m a scientific breakthrough and all.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Steve sent me a message. To make sure you&rsquo;re safe. And I intend to do that.&rdquo;</p><p>***</p><p>Jet was escorted back to her cell block, where she was unceremoniously pushed to the ground and the door was locked before she could even sit up. </p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;d they do this time?&rdquo; Sam asked from his cell. His fists were clenched and his face held a permanent glare. The second his doors opened, he swore he would kill every last person who hurt the winged girl. Jet sighed. </p><p>&ldquo;Nothing this time.&rdquo; She whispered back. &ldquo;Tony wanted to see me.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Stark&rsquo;s here?&rdquo; Sam spat. He was the reason Jet was even in this mess. Jet merely nodded. </p><p>&ldquo;What did he want?&rdquo; Clint asked, leaning against the glass. Jet shrugged slightly, not wanting the camera&rsquo;s to hear what Tony was actually doing. Clint didn&rsquo;t press for information, pushing himself off the glass and sitting down on his bed. Sam remained standing, pacing back and forth.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;How are you feeling?&rdquo; Wanda asked. Jet looked over to the other girl&rsquo;s cell block.

As the plane descended, he slithered back up Eddie&rsquo;s sleeve, happy as a clam.

As the plane descended, he slithered back up Eddie\u2019s sleeve, happy as a clam. The sensation of having an alien parasite hum tunes in your own head was.. indescribable. </p><p>The driver Tony sent was holding up a sign that said \u201cEddie Brock and Venom,\u201d which of course was the kind of thoughtful thing that Tony <i>would</i> do and made Venom chuckle gleefully inside Eddie\u2019s head. The real surprise, though, was that Tony himself was waiting in the car; as Eddie climbed in and slid across the seat to give him a kiss, Venom oozed out to slither over him, a short term infestation being its version of a hug. </p><p>\u201cHey, babe. Babes,\u201d Tony corrected when Venom raised its head to scowl at him. \u201cNice flight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one got eaten,\u201d Eddie said cheerfully, which was actually a sentence he said often enough that it had actually lost it\u2019s \u201cwhat the hell is my life\u201d factor. </p><p>\u201cPoor Venom,\u201d Tony said when Venom raised his head to sigh melodramatically. \u201cI\u2019ve got sushi at the tower. Nagiri for you, Venom. It\u2019s already dead, my charming little homicidal symbiote, but it is raw.\u201d He smiled when he could feel Venom\u2019s pleasure before it climbed back into Eddie.</p><p>Eddie squeezed Tony\u2019s hand gratefully, always surprised at how easily Tony had accepted Venom into his life, treating him like a welcome member of their relationship instead of a bizarre, occasionally terrifying third wheel. Eddie knew that Venom didn\u2019t so much appreciate it as expect it as his due, but Eddie knew how rare it was. </p><p>\n\n<i>Good mate, </i>Venom agreed, though Eddie had the sneaking suspicion Venom was thinking more of the \u201cplanes, towers, cars\u201d from earlier than anything else.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to stop by Avenger\u2019s compound first, I\u2019ve got a little bit of work to do but then I\u2019m yours for the rest of the weekend,\u201d Tony said. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cRough week?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cRough year,\u201d he said with a sigh, so Eddie squeezed his hand again.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>As Eddie followed Tony into the compound, his first clue that something was wrong was when he saw Tony\u2019s shoulders stiffen.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell, hello Tony, kind of you to grace us with your presence,\u201d a voice drawled.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cLong time no see.

Is that what I can do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Eddie said mildly, pretending to look at his phone while Clint was frozen in terror and Tony was staring at the drama with wide eyes,\u00a0\u201cfirst you gotta give them time to apologize.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Venom said, sounding disappointed.
