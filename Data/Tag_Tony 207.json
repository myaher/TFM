With a loving yet victorious smile, you led him to the kitchen where you fixed him breakfast before taking him to bed. \u201cHoney, you need to stop putting so much pressure on yourself. It\u2019s not healthy.\u201d</p><p>You could tell he would have made a sarcastic comeback if he had the energy to talk. You took advantage of his vulnerable silence, making your favorite point in times like this. \u201cI know why you stay up, love. But if you want to keep them safe, you can\u2019t be a drooling, sleep-deprived mess.\u201d</p><p>Tony makes a small grumbling noise in the back of his throat and you think that it\u2019s meant to be some sort of reply probably laced with profanities. With a slight heave, you got Tony into your shared bed (that he barely used) and slid his jeans off so he\u2019d be comfortable. You got him under the covers and was seconds away from leaving before he let out a small whine, hand extended towards you.</p><p>\u201cI would love to sleep right now, but I have a better idea,\u201d The gears turning in his head were probably thinking of something inappropriate, but you quelled those thoughts before they turned to reality. \u201cHow about you send me the updates you need to be done on your suit? I can get them done for you and you can get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>Tony looked like he was on the edge of accepting your offer, but then he grabbed at you again. \u201cC\u2019mere,\u201d he mumbled. Tony, despite his bad boy persona, was an aggressive cuddler. Most of the time he was the little spoon, and you loved being able to take care of him when he needed a little extra help. You crawled over the bed and into where his arms were waiting, and he closed them around you.</p><p>He nuzzled his face into the crook of your neck, taking in the scent of your shampoo. You carded your fingers through his hair slowly in an attempt to soothe him. Expecting that you\u2019d have to do this until he was asleep, you were surprised when he broke the peaceful silence that had cocooned your bedroom.</p><p>\u201cTh\u2019 updat\u2019s are in the lab, hon\u2019y,\u201d His speech was slurred (you found it adorable whether he was sleepy or drunk) and it took a second to understand what he had said, but when you did, you felt victorious. \u201cI\u2019ll get them done before I come to bed, sweetie. Just rest for a little while and everything will be okay,\u201d you kiss his temple before crawling out of his arms. Tony reached for your pillow as you walked out of the bedroom, him hugging it like you weren\u2019t going to be back in a few hours.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>Seconds away from being done, you wipe the sweat from your brow with your free hand. \u201cDum-E, soldering iron, please,\u201d the robot happily complies, handing you the tool while you try and keep yourself from messing up. You were adding the last adjustment to Tony\u2019s repulsor beams and struggling to make everything as perfect as your boyfriend would. Tony never let anyone work on his suit, so you doing this was a bigger deal than some would realize.</p><p>\u201cSteady, steady\u2026\u201d you were talking to yourself in an attempt to help keep your hands from shaking. You knew your way around a lab (you met Tony at MIT long ago), but you had to admit that Tony made his suits so complicated that it wasn\u2019t a walk in the park.</p><p>\u201cFinally!\u201d You shout to no one, realizing seconds after you shout that it\u2019s some ungodly hour in the night. Cleaning up, you cross your fingers in the hopes that you didn\u2019t wake anybody up with your exclamation of victory.</p><p>Once the lab is somewhat clean, you sit in your previous chair and run a hand down your face. You were exhausted and clueless as to how your boyfriend does this for days on end, wanting nothing more to crawl back into your shared bed and sleep until the afternoon. Your body too fatigued to get up in that moment, you lay your head down in your arms, the worktable becoming your trusty substitute pillow.</p><p>You had no idea what time it was when you felt it. It was like a ghost, there one second and gone the next. The short time of its presence and the fact you were in between consciousness and not caused you to doubt whether it even happened, but when it happened again, you knew you weren\u2019t hallucinating the feeling of it on your feet.</p><p>You looked down the moment you felt it a second time, catching the culprit in the act. Two beady eyes peered back at you, silently daring you to do something about its presence. Your brain realized with a start what exactly was causing your discomfort and you lost control of your vocal cords.</p><p>Your scream ricocheted out of the lab and through the living room as you clambered on top of the work table, your terror awakening your fight-or-flight instinct. FRIDAY had alerted Tony and the others about your increased heart rate and apparent distress (as if your shriek wouldn\u2019t alert them enough) immediately and you cursed. Whoever wasn\u2019t woken up from your scream was for sure going to be awake from FRIDAY\u2019s joyful little wake-up call.</p><p>Your boyfriend was the first one to arrive at the scene, fear in his eyes. He most likely heard the scream instead of FRIDAY and you felt guilty for waking him how you did. He absorbed the scene of you cowering on the lab table and frantically searched for the threat before coming up empty.</p><p>\u201cHoney, what\u2019s going on?\u201d You stuttered out a broken reply, pointing towards where the rodent scurried to with a shaking finger. You looked horrible; tears were falling from darkened, hollow eyes that desperately needed to rest while frightened sobs escaped your lips. Instead of asking more questions, your loving boyfriend simply walked to you and pulled you into his arms as you shook, unable to speak coherently over your panic.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2026 it t-touched me, T-Tone,\u201d You finally got out. \u201cIt c-crawled on mm-my foot!\u201d When you started sobbing more, he pulled you closer and began to run his fingers through your hair to try and calm you down.</p><p>More people dashed in within moments, all of them wondering what could have possibly penetrated the Avengers Tower at this hour without tripping any alarms. Without lifting your head from Tony\u2019s chest, you could feel the stares of the rest of the Avengers on you and oh how horrible it made you feel.</p><p>For most of everyone in the Tower, sleep was an elusive creature and your scream had chased it away. Your fear began to mesh with guilt and it made the tears on your face fall harder. Tony was shushing you gently as he rocked you back and forth, ignoring the stares and silent questions from his teammates.</p><p>\u201cTony, what\u2019s wrong with her?\u201d Steve had broken the almost-silence with the most obvious question (you were still sobbing so it wasn\u2019t complete silence).</p><p>You wanted to answer him, you really did. You wanted to climb off of the table and out of Tony\u2019s arms and calmly explain to them your phobia, but alas, it\u2019s a phobia. It&rsquo;s presence in your safe haven shook your resolve to the core and kept you from rationally discussing your current state with your friends.</p><p>Tony decided to answer for you, sparing you from babbling a reply through your hysteria. \u201cIt was a rat and it crawled on her while she was working. Go back to bed, I\u2019ve got her.\u201d They looked worried, but Tony\u2019s hard glare chased them away.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow we can work on setting traps so we can catch it. We\u2019ll get it out of here, don\u2019t worry.\u201d Bucky sympathised, wanting you to feel better.</p><p>\u201cWe could get a cat. Those things kill rats and stuff, and it\u2019s even cute. Name it Terminator and give it a little Iron Kitten suit.\u201d You laughed a little through the tears, the image of a kitten with its own suit flying around the Tower lightening the mood. Of course that would be the first thing to pop out of Sam\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m so sorry, guys. I didn\u2019t me-mean to wake everyone,\u201d You stuttered. \u201cIt just c-crawled on me an-and I panicked.\u201d Tony brought you a little closer to him while the others were quick to shrug it off like it was no big deal.</p><p>\u201cClint probably would have screamed louder than you did, hon. Don\u2019t feel bad.\u201d Nat got a hard glare from the archer, but it weakened slightly at the sound of your laugh following the comment.</p><p>Everyone continued to joke around about the ordeal for a few minutes longer until Tony decided it was time to go to bed. \u201cAlright, this is starting to become a chick-flick, so I\u2019m gonna take her to bed.\u201d You moved to get out of his embrace and onto the floor, but he stopped you. \u201cNuh-uh, I\u2019m gonna carry you, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>You hear a few \u201caww\u201d sounds come from your friends and you giggle into Tony\u2019s neck as he lifted you from the work table. \u201cI thought you said this wasn\u2019t gonna be a chick flick!\u201d Clint shouted when Tony had you almost to the bedroom. </p><p>You and Tony shared a look for a moment before the two of you sent matching middle fingers toward your friend. The team laughed at the interaction before retreating to their own rooms, eager to catch up on the sleep lost.</p><p>Once you and Tony were cuddled in bed, you were finally able to relax. There was nothing that could scare you as long as your loving boyfriend was beside you.</p>",

With a loving yet victorious smile, you led him to the kitchen where you fixed him breakfast before taking him to bed. \u201cHoney, you need to stop putting so much pressure on yourself. It\u2019s not healthy.\u201d</p><p>You could tell he would have made a sarcastic comeback if he had the energy to talk. You took advantage of his vulnerable silence, making your favorite point in times like this. \u201cI know why you stay up, love. But if you want to keep them safe, you can\u2019t be a drooling, sleep-deprived mess.\u201d</p><p>Tony makes a small grumbling noise in the back of his throat and you think that it\u2019s meant to be some sort of reply probably laced with profanities. With a slight heave, you got Tony into your shared bed (that he barely used) and slid his jeans off so he\u2019d be comfortable. You got him under the covers and was seconds away from leaving before he let out a small whine, hand extended towards you.</p><p>\u201cI would love to sleep right now, but I have a better idea,\u201d The gears turning in his head were probably thinking of something inappropriate, but you quelled those thoughts before they turned to reality. \u201cHow about you send me the updates you need to be done on your suit? I can get them done for you and you can get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>Tony looked like he was on the edge of accepting your offer, but then he grabbed at you again. \u201cC\u2019mere,\u201d he mumbled. Tony, despite his bad boy persona, was an aggressive cuddler. Most of the time he was the little spoon, and you loved being able to take care of him when he needed a little extra help. You crawled over the bed and into where his arms were waiting, and he closed them around you.</p><p>He nuzzled his face into the crook of your neck, taking in the scent of your shampoo. You carded your fingers through his hair slowly in an attempt to soothe him. Expecting that you\u2019d have to do this until he was asleep, you were surprised when he broke the peaceful silence that had cocooned your bedroom.</p><p>\u201cTh\u2019 updat\u2019s are in the lab, hon\u2019y,\u201d His speech was slurred (you found it adorable whether he was sleepy or drunk) and it took a second to understand what he had said, but when you did, you felt victorious. \u201cI\u2019ll get them done before I come to bed, sweetie. Just rest for a little while and everything will be okay,\u201d you kiss his temple before crawling out of his arms. Tony reached for your pillow as you walked out of the bedroom, him hugging it like you weren\u2019t going to be back in a few hours.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p>Seconds away from being done, you wipe the sweat from your brow with your free hand. \u201cDum-E, soldering iron, please,\u201d the robot happily complies, handing you the tool while you try and keep yourself from messing up. You were adding the last adjustment to Tony\u2019s repulsor beams and struggling to make everything as perfect as your boyfriend would. Tony never let anyone work on his suit, so you doing this was a bigger deal than some would realize.</p><p>\u201cSteady, steady\u2026\u201d you were talking to yourself in an attempt to help keep your hands from shaking. You knew your way around a lab (you met Tony at MIT long ago), but you had to admit that Tony made his suits so complicated that it wasn\u2019t a walk in the park.</p><p>\u201cFinally!\u201d You shout to no one, realizing seconds after you shout that it\u2019s some ungodly hour in the night. Cleaning up, you cross your fingers in the hopes that you didn\u2019t wake anybody up with your exclamation of victory.</p><p>Once the lab is somewhat clean, you sit in your previous chair and run a hand down your face. You were exhausted and clueless as to how your boyfriend does this for days on end, wanting nothing more to crawl back into your shared bed and sleep until the afternoon. Your body too fatigued to get up in that moment, you lay your head down in your arms, the worktable becoming your trusty substitute pillow.</p><p>You had no idea what time it was when you felt it. It was like a ghost, there one second and gone the next. The short time of its presence and the fact you were in between consciousness and not caused you to doubt whether it even happened, but when it happened again, you knew you weren\u2019t hallucinating the feeling of it on your feet.</p><p>You looked down the moment you felt it a second time, catching the culprit in the act. Two beady eyes peered back at you, silently daring you to do something about its presence. Your brain realized with a start what exactly was causing your discomfort and you lost control of your vocal cords.</p><p>Your scream ricocheted out of the lab and through the living room as you clambered on top of the work table, your terror awakening your fight-or-flight instinct. FRIDAY had alerted Tony and the others about your increased heart rate and apparent distress (as if your shriek wouldn\u2019t alert them enough) immediately and you cursed. Whoever wasn\u2019t woken up from your scream was for sure going to be awake from FRIDAY\u2019s joyful little wake-up call.</p><p>Your boyfriend was the first one to arrive at the scene, fear in his eyes. He most likely heard the scream instead of FRIDAY and you felt guilty for waking him how you did. He absorbed the scene of you cowering on the lab table and frantically searched for the threat before coming up empty.</p><p>\u201cHoney, what\u2019s going on?\u201d You stuttered out a broken reply, pointing towards where the rodent scurried to with a shaking finger. You looked horrible; tears were falling from darkened, hollow eyes that desperately needed to rest while frightened sobs escaped your lips. Instead of asking more questions, your loving boyfriend simply walked to you and pulled you into his arms as you shook, unable to speak coherently over your panic.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2026 it t-touched me, T-Tone,\u201d You finally got out. \u201cIt c-crawled on mm-my foot!\u201d When you started sobbing more, he pulled you closer and began to run his fingers through your hair to try and calm you down.</p><p>More people dashed in within moments, all of them wondering what could have possibly penetrated the Avengers Tower at this hour without tripping any alarms. Without lifting your head from Tony\u2019s chest, you could feel the stares of the rest of the Avengers on you and oh how horrible it made you feel.</p><p>For most of everyone in the Tower, sleep was an elusive creature and your scream had chased it away. Your fear began to mesh with guilt and it made the tears on your face fall harder. Tony was shushing you gently as he rocked you back and forth, ignoring the stares and silent questions from his teammates.</p><p>\u201cTony, what\u2019s wrong with her?\u201d Steve had broken the almost-silence with the most obvious question (you were still sobbing so it wasn\u2019t complete silence).</p><p>You wanted to answer him, you really did. You wanted to climb off of the table and out of Tony\u2019s arms and calmly explain to them your phobia, but alas, it\u2019s a phobia. It\u2019s presence in your safe haven shook your resolve to the core and kept you from rationally discussing your current state with your friends.</p><p>Tony decided to answer for you, sparing you from babbling a reply through your hysteria. \u201cIt was a rat and it crawled on her while she was working. Go back to bed, I\u2019ve got her.\u201d They looked worried, but Tony\u2019s hard glare chased them away.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow we can work on setting traps so we can catch it. We\u2019ll get it out of here, don\u2019t worry.\u201d Bucky sympathised, wanting you to feel better.</p><p>\u201cWe could get a cat. Those things kill rats and stuff, and it\u2019s even cute. Name it Terminator and give it a little Iron Kitten suit.\u201d You laughed a little through the tears, the image of a kitten with its own suit flying around the Tower lightening the mood. Of course that would be the first thing to pop out of Sam\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m so sorry, guys. I didn\u2019t me-mean to wake everyone,\u201d You stuttered. \u201cIt just c-crawled on me an-and I panicked.\u201d Tony brought you a little closer to him while the others were quick to shrug it off like it was no big deal.</p><p>\u201cClint probably would have screamed louder than you did, hon. Don\u2019t feel bad.\u201d Nat got a hard glare from the archer, but it weakened slightly at the sound of your laugh following the comment.</p><p>Everyone continued to joke around about the ordeal for a few minutes longer until Tony decided it was time to go to bed. \u201cAlright, this is starting to become a chick-flick, so I\u2019m gonna take her to bed.\u201d You moved to get out of his embrace and onto the floor, but he stopped you. \u201cNuh-uh, I\u2019m gonna carry you, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>You hear a few \u201caww\u201d sounds come from your friends and you giggle into Tony\u2019s neck as he lifted you from the work table. \u201cI thought you said this wasn\u2019t gonna be a chick flick!\u201d Clint shouted when Tony had you almost to the bedroom. </p><p>You and Tony shared a look for a moment before the two of you sent matching middle fingers toward your friend. The team laughed at the interaction before retreating to their own rooms, eager to catch up on the sleep lost.</p><p>Once you and Tony were cuddled in bed, you were finally able to relax. There was nothing that could scare you as long as your loving boyfriend was beside you.</p>",

                "content": "<p>Sometimes I think about Tony and Peter&rsquo;s conversation during Homecoming. You know the disappointed!Tony one. </p><p><b>Peter Parker</b>: I just wanted to be like you. </p><p><b>Tony Stark</b>: And I wanted you to be better. </p><p>Like that interaction <i>breaks</i> my damn heart. </p><p>On one hand, my heart breaks for Peter Parker. Who desperately wants to prove himself and make Tony proud. Peter Benjamin Parker, who after being through so damn much in his life at such a young age, wants nothing more than to be a hero. And not just any hero. No, he wants to be a hero like <i>Tony Stark</i>. Cause I imagine, Peter must have read what Tony went through right? From graduating MIT at 17 to losing his parents to being kidnapped by a terrorist group to saving the world everyday as Iron-Man. Can you imagine 2010 Peter Parker sitting in his living room in Queens excited to go to the Stark Expo? Can you imagine how Peter must have felt when Tony Stark saved his life that night and well technically gave [Peter] the credit for it and kinda made him a hero that night? So, Peter sees Tony as this amazing guy. As the man who invented all these cool robots and revolutionized clean energy. As the man who, despite having been through so much loss and pain, still puts others life before his own. And that&rsquo;s why Peter desperately wants to be a hero like <i>Tony Stark</i>.

She nuzzled her head in his neck and they continued their walk to school.</p><p>It went on with a steady silence. They were close to each other, but didn\u2019t say anything. Emma\u2019s mind probably wondering about what they relatively new couple were going to do in the oncoming autumn. Halloween and holiday season was soon, after all.\u00a0All Tony could think about, though, was football season starting and what his father was going to say about him spending all his time after school on that. </p><p>As they kept walking, his thoughts continued to drift. Up ahead he could see a tall blonde girl walking ahead of them. \u201cWho is that?\u201d Tony asked Emma, immediately regretting it because he knew Emma would get jealous.</p><p>\u201cPepper Potts, we\u2019re co-presidents of the Business club. You don\u2019t know who she is? She\u2019s the one who hosts all the pep rallies!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t pay attention, I\u2019m always in the locker rooms waiting for them to call the football team,\u201d Tony countered. </p><p>\u201cWaiting for <i>her</i> to call the football team,\u201d Emma nudged Tony. He simply rolled his eyes and tightened his grip on her. They continued to walk in silence, which Tony preferred.</p><p>\u201cTony, can\u2019t we take our time, spend time with each other?\u201d Emma begged. Tony glanced at her with a raised eyebrow and Emma smiled. She began playfully skipping around Tony, grabbing his hand. She kissed his cheek and stopped him in his tracks.</p><p>\u201cHm, maybe we could take a break. Those trees over there look pretty comfy.\u201d Tony reached his other hand down and grabbed Emma\u2019s open hand. They took a sharp right and turned into a small alcove of trees.</p><p>Tony leaned his back against the tree and put his hands out reaching for Emma. Once he could grasp her, he pulled her hips against his and spread his hands to her back. She leaned in slowly until her lips brushed against his. </p><p>At first, they did nothing. He opened his mouth and slowly she put her hands on his shoulders. His hands lowered below her waist and his tongue found her bottom lip. She leaned into him, but then quickly took a step back breaking their contact. </p><p>\u201cTony, that\u2019s too far.\u201d She looked down at the floor, embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d he said grabbing her hand and pulling her back towards the path up to school. \u201cNo pressure,\u201d he smiled. He wrapped his hand around her shoulder and they finished their walk to high school in silence. </p><p>Tony opened the door for Emma and followed her in. Immediately, they were bombarded by a group of guys in blue and yellow jerseys. Screaming ensued and chants of \u201cTony\u201d began. </p><p>Emma took a step back from Tony, uncomfortable from the lack of personal space. She let the football team do their thing. Watching as they huddled around Tony and wrapped their arms around each other.</p><p>\u201cThis year is <i>our</i> <i>year</i>!\u201d Tony yelled, exciting the boys surrounding him. The football team was the royal court of high school, and Tony was the king. Tony knew it too. Every girl wanted to be with him and every guy wanted to be him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBruce, see you didn\u2019t do <i>any</i>thing over summer,\u201d Tony said slapping the shorter boy\u2019s stomach.</p><p>The crowd dissipated and Tony, Bruce, and Emma began their walk to their classes. \u201c<i>Har</i> <i>har</i>, I\u2019ve been playing all summer with my brothers. What have you been doing? Helping your dad fight aliens or some shit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoy did I miss you,\u201d Tony grinned, wrapping his arm around Bruce\u2019s neck and giving him an affectionate noogie. \u201cWe all in homeroom together?\u201d He asked letting go of Bruce and continuing the walk.</p><p>Emma and Bruce pulled out their phones to look at their schedules.</p><p>\u201cI have Ms. Danvers,\u201d Bruce said sliding his phone back in his pocket.</p><p>\u201cSame!\u201d Emma said excitedly, reaching over Tony to give Bruce a high-five. \u201cWhat about you, Tony?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Lang,\u201d he sighed,\u00a0\u201cthis blows!\u201d Tony said stopping in front of a door marked <i>Scott</i> <i>Lang</i>. \u201cWell, I guess I\u2019ll&hellip; see you at lunch?\u201d He leaned forward and gave Emma a quick peck.</p><p>\u201cEw, ew, ew, okay lovebirds you\u2019ll see each other <i>literally</i> in 3 hours, give it a rest,\u201d Bruce said waving his hand. He jokingly wrapped his arm around Emma\u2019s shoulder and started walking her towards their own homeroom a few doors down. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of her, no worries Stark.\u201d </p><p>Tony shook his head listening to Emma\u2019s laugh as they disappeared down the hallway. He turned his head to face the door and opened it. Inside were two people: Jane Foster and Pepper Potts. He quietly scanned the room for his seat but to no avail, until he heard Jane say, \u201cRight here, Tony,\u201d as she motioned towards the seat in a theatrical manner.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Jane,\u201d he replied nodding his head in a \u201cbro\u201d sort of way. Jane headed back toward her seat as Tony stepped into his and sat down. He looked to his left. Pepper was seated with perfect posture already writing diligently on what looked to be like homework. \u201cHi,\u201d he said, bending down to get a look at her face, and ultimately trying to start some conversation.</p><p>Pepper jerked her head up. She looked dead in Tony\u2019s eyes for a few seconds before looking at his feet. \u201cHi, I\u2019m, um, I\u2019m Pepper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he responded. Her eyes shot back up at Tony\u2019s. The most beautiful shade of blue he had ever seen. Noticing the dark teal around her iris, he smiled. \u201cI\u2019m Tony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know, your father owns basically everything in this city.\u201d She laughed as she turned back to her work. He had never heard a laugh that made his teeth show under a smile so quickly.</p><p>\u201cYou have a point,\u201d he said swiveling his legs under the desk. He pulled out a binder from his perpetually opened backpack saying, \u201care you working on homework or\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah I\u2019m doing tutor work for Ms. Danvers for calculus and she gave me the work for this week a few days ago, so I thought I\u2019d get a head start so I know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d She not once looked up at Tony and continued scribbling numbers and symbols on her paper.</p><p>\u201cWow, impressive,\u201d Tony laughed. \u201cI might need to ask for your help on some calculus too if it comes down to it.\u201d He leaned back and rested his hands on his head. He glanced over at Pepper hoping for some sort of eye contact.</p><p>At those words, though, Pepper immediately looked at Tony with a small half-smile. \u201cSure, um, abso-,\u201d she stopped herself from sounding too eager. \u201cThat\u2019d be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d he said coming back from his resting position. Pepper was&hellip; intriguing to Tony. He\u2019d never met a girl who didn\u2019t try and be a part of his life immediately. He didn\u2019t see it as Pepper playing\u00a0\u2018hard to get\u2019, rather she was completely doing her own thing and she was proud of it.</p><p>Tony sat there in silence, thinking about this fascinating girl next to him. She seemed so independent yet kind-hearted. He wanted to be a part of her life, in some way, but knew because of Emma he would have trouble.</p><p>\u201cSo, Pepper,\u201d he began as he opened his binder. Pepper immediately swung around to look at him, though, he saw Jane walking towards the couple. He shuffled his papers and stopped talking, but he was preparing to covertly eavesdrop on the oncoming conversation between Jane and Pepper.</p><p>\u201cSo tonight, around 7? Stay up till midnight so we can celebrate!\u201d He heard Jane say with a sing-song voice, grabbing Pepper\u2019s hands. Pepper\u2019s attention was completely diverted from Tony\u2019s as he continued to listen.</p><p>\u201cYes, but don\u2019t invite anyone you <i>know</i> I wouldn\u2019t want,\u201d Pepper retaliated.</p><p>\u201cSo Tony, do you want to come to Pepper\u2019s sleepover tonight? It\u2019s her seventeenth birthday!\u201d Jane leaned down and rested her chin on Pepper\u2019s shoulder. \u201cShe\u2019d love it if you could come.</p><p>Tony saw Pepper pinch Jane\u2019s arm. \u201cWell, I mean, I wouldn\u2019t want to intrude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Jane said, \u201cPepper would love it, wouldn\u2019t you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, if you want, Tony.\u201d Pepper said looking Tony dead in the eyes.</p><p>\u201cUm, okay. I\u2019ll see if I can swing by after practice tonight.\u201d Tony said nodding.</p><p>\u201cGreat, there\u2019s going to be a ton of people. Can\u2019t wait!\u201d Jane said hugging Pepper. She looked Tony deep in the eyes and then walked off back at her seat as Mr. Lang walked into the room. Tall, built, and always wearing some sort of T-shirt. </p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t wait, Pepper.\u201d Tony said looking back at the front of the class. More people had flooded into the room, yet Tony hadn\u2019t noticed. The clock almost said 8:30, so Tony slid his phone away and got a few pencils out. 11 hours till Pepper\u2019s party. </p><p><i><b>- now that the exposition is done we can get into the real stuff.

Sure she was cute, and genuinely one of the nicest girls he had ever met, but Tony didn\u2019t like the way she depended on his attention and company so much. Not that Tony didn\u2019t love the attention, it was just too much at times.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to Germany?\u201d she asked hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cEmma, we\u2019re going to school, I\u2019m not going anywhere without you.\u201d Tony wrapped his arm around Emma\u2019s shoulder, reassuring her. She nuzzled her head in his neck and they continued their walk to school.</p><p>It went on with a steady silence. They were close to each other, but didn\u2019t say anything. Emma\u2019s mind probably wondering about what they relatively new couple were going to do in the oncoming autumn. Halloween and holiday season was soon, after all.\u00a0All Tony could think about, though, was football season starting and what his father was going to say about him spending all his time after school on that. </p><p>As they kept walking, his thoughts continued to drift. Up ahead he could see a tall blonde girl walking ahead of them. \u201cWho is that?\u201d Tony asked Emma, immediately regretting it because he knew Emma would get jealous.</p><p>\u201cPepper Potts, we\u2019re co-presidents of the Business club. You don\u2019t know who she is? She\u2019s the one who hosts all the pep rallies!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t pay attention, I\u2019m always in the locker rooms waiting for them to call the football team,\u201d Tony countered. </p><p>\u201cWaiting for <i>her</i> to call the football team,\u201d Emma nudged Tony. He simply rolled his eyes and tightened his grip on her. They continued to walk in silence, which Tony preferred.</p><p>\u201cTony, can\u2019t we take our time, spend time with each other?\u201d Emma begged. Tony glanced at her with a raised eyebrow and Emma smiled. She began playfully skipping around Tony, grabbing his hand. She kissed his cheek and stopped him in his tracks.</p><p>\u201cHm, maybe we could take a break. Those trees over there look pretty comfy.\u201d Tony reached his other hand down and grabbed Emma\u2019s open hand. They took a sharp right and turned into a small alcove of trees.</p><p>Tony leaned his back against the tree and put his hands out reaching for Emma. Once he could grasp her, he pulled her hips against his and spread his hands to her back. She leaned in slowly until her lips brushed against his. </p><p>At first, they did nothing. He opened his mouth and slowly she put her hands on his shoulders. His hands lowered below her waist and his tongue found her bottom lip. She leaned into him, but then quickly took a step back breaking their contact. </p><p>\u201cTony, that\u2019s too far.\u201d She looked down at the floor, embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d he said grabbing her hand and pulling her back towards the path up to school. \u201cNo pressure,\u201d he smiled. He wrapped his hand around her shoulder and they finished their walk to high school in silence. </p><p>Tony opened the door for Emma and followed her in. Immediately, they were bombarded by a group of guys in blue and yellow jerseys. Screaming ensued and chants of \u201cTony\u201d began. </p><p>Emma took a step back from Tony, uncomfortable from the lack of personal space. She let the football team do their thing. Watching as they huddled around Tony and wrapped their arms around each other.</p><p>\u201cThis year is <i>our</i> <i>year</i>!\u201d Tony yelled, exciting the boys surrounding him. The football team was the royal court of high school, and Tony was the king. Tony knew it too. Every girl wanted to be with him and every guy wanted to be him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBruce, see you didn\u2019t do <i>any</i>thing over summer,\u201d Tony said slapping the shorter boy\u2019s stomach.</p><p>The crowd dissipated and Tony, Bruce, and Emma began their walk to their classes. \u201c<i>Har</i> <i>har</i>, I\u2019ve been playing all summer with my brothers. What have you been doing? Helping your dad fight aliens or some shit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoy did I miss you,\u201d Tony grinned, wrapping his arm around Bruce\u2019s neck and giving him an affectionate noogie. \u201cWe all in homeroom together?\u201d He asked letting go of Bruce and continuing the walk.</p><p>Emma and Bruce pulled out their phones to look at their schedules.</p><p>\u201cI have Ms. Danvers,\u201d Bruce said sliding his phone back in his pocket.</p><p>\u201cSame!\u201d Emma said excitedly, reaching over Tony to give Bruce a high-five. \u201cWhat about you, Tony?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Lang,\u201d he sighed,\u00a0\u201cthis blows!\u201d Tony said stopping in front of a door marked <i>Scott</i> <i>Lang</i>. \u201cWell, I guess I\u2019ll\u2026 see you at lunch?\u201d He leaned forward and gave Emma a quick peck.</p><p>\u201cEw, ew, ew, okay lovebirds you\u2019ll see each other <i>literally</i> in 3 hours, give it a rest,\u201d Bruce said waving his hand. He jokingly wrapped his arm around Emma\u2019s shoulder and started walking her towards their own homeroom a few doors down. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of her, no worries Stark.\u201d </p><p>Tony shook his head listening to Emma\u2019s laugh as they disappeared down the hallway. He turned his head to face the door and opened it. Inside were two people: Jane Foster and Pepper Potts. He quietly scanned the room for his seat but to no avail, until he heard Jane say, \u201cRight here, Tony,\u201d as she motioned towards the seat in a theatrical manner.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Jane,\u201d he replied nodding his head in a \u201cbro\u201d sort of way. Jane headed back toward her seat as Tony stepped into his and sat down. He looked to his left. Pepper was seated with perfect posture already writing diligently on what looked to be like homework. \u201cHi,\u201d he said, bending down to get a look at her face, and ultimately trying to start some conversation.</p><p>Pepper jerked her head up. She looked dead in Tony\u2019s eyes for a few seconds before looking at his feet. \u201cHi, I\u2019m, um, I\u2019m Pepper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he responded. Her eyes shot back up at Tony\u2019s. The most beautiful shade of blue he had ever seen. Noticing the dark teal around her iris, he smiled. \u201cI\u2019m Tony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know, your father owns basically everything in this city.\u201d She laughed as she turned back to her work. He had never heard a laugh that made his teeth show under a smile so quickly.</p><p>\u201cYou have a point,\u201d he said swiveling his legs under the desk. He pulled out a binder from his perpetually opened backpack saying, \u201care you working on homework or\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah I\u2019m doing tutor work for Ms. Danvers for calculus and she gave me the work for this week a few days ago, so I thought I\u2019d get a head start so I know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d She not once looked up at Tony and continued scribbling numbers and symbols on her paper.</p><p>\u201cWow, impressive,\u201d Tony laughed. \u201cI might need to ask for your help on some calculus too if it comes down to it.\u201d He leaned back and rested his hands on his head. He glanced over at Pepper hoping for some sort of eye contact.</p><p>At those words, though, Pepper immediately looked at Tony with a small half-smile. \u201cSure, um, abso-,\u201d she stopped herself from sounding too eager. \u201cThat\u2019d be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d he said coming back from his resting position. Pepper was\u2026 intriguing to Tony. He\u2019d never met a girl who didn\u2019t try and be a part of his life immediately. He didn\u2019t see it as Pepper playing\u00a0\u2018hard to get\u2019, rather she was completely doing her own thing and she was proud of it.</p><p>Tony sat there in silence, thinking about this fascinating girl next to him. She seemed so independent yet kind-hearted. He wanted to be a part of her life, in some way, but knew because of Emma he would have trouble.</p><p>\u201cSo, Pepper,\u201d he began as he opened his binder. Pepper immediately swung around to look at him, though, he saw Jane walking towards the couple. He shuffled his papers and stopped talking, but he was preparing to covertly eavesdrop on the oncoming conversation between Jane and Pepper.</p><p>\u201cSo tonight, around 7? Stay up till midnight so we can celebrate!\u201d He heard Jane say with a sing-song voice, grabbing Pepper\u2019s hands. Pepper\u2019s attention was completely diverted from Tony\u2019s as he continued to listen.</p><p>\u201cYes, but don\u2019t invite anyone you <i>know</i> I wouldn\u2019t want,\u201d Pepper retaliated.</p><p>\u201cSo Tony, do you want to come to Pepper\u2019s sleepover tonight? It\u2019s her seventeenth birthday!\u201d Jane leaned down and rested her chin on Pepper\u2019s shoulder. \u201cShe\u2019d love it if you could come.</p><p>Tony saw Pepper pinch Jane\u2019s arm. \u201cWell, I mean, I wouldn\u2019t want to intrude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Jane said, \u201cPepper would love it, wouldn\u2019t you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, if you want, Tony.\u201d Pepper said looking Tony dead in the eyes.</p><p>\u201cUm, okay. I\u2019ll see if I can swing by after practice tonight.\u201d Tony said nodding.</p><p>\u201cGreat, there\u2019s going to be a ton of people. Can\u2019t wait!\u201d Jane said hugging Pepper. She looked Tony deep in the eyes and then walked off back at her seat as Mr. Lang walked into the room. Tall, built, and always wearing some sort of T-shirt. </p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t wait, Pepper.\u201d Tony said looking back at the front of the class. More people had flooded into the room, yet Tony hadn\u2019t noticed. The clock almost said 8:30, so Tony slid his phone away and got a few pencils out. 11 hours till Pepper\u2019s party. </p><p><i><b>- now that the exposition is done we can get into the real stuff.

Helping your dad fight aliens or some shit?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Boy did I miss you,&rdquo; Tony grinned, wrapping his arm around Bruce&rsquo;s neck and giving him an affectionate noogie. &ldquo;We all in homeroom together?&rdquo; He asked letting go of Bruce and continuing the walk.</p><p>Emma and Bruce pulled out their phones to look at their schedules.</p><p>&ldquo;I have Ms. Danvers,&rdquo; Bruce said sliding his phone back in his pocket.</p><p>&ldquo;Same!&rdquo; Emma said excitedly, reaching over Tony to give Bruce a high-five. &ldquo;What about you, Tony?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Lang,&rdquo; he sighed,&nbsp;&ldquo;this blows!&rdquo; Tony said stopping in front of a door marked <i>Scott</i> <i>Lang</i>. &ldquo;Well, I guess I&rsquo;ll&hellip; see you at lunch?&rdquo; He leaned forward and gave Emma a quick peck.</p><p>&ldquo;Ew, ew, ew, okay lovebirds you&rsquo;ll see each other <i>literally</i> in 3 hours, give it a rest,&rdquo; Bruce said waving his hand. He jokingly wrapped his arm around Emma&rsquo;s shoulder and started walking her towards their own homeroom a few doors down. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of her, no worries Stark.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony shook his head listening to Emma&rsquo;s laugh as they disappeared down the hallway. He turned his head to face the door and opened it. Inside were two people: Jane Foster and Pepper Potts. He quietly scanned the room for his seat but to no avail, until he heard Jane say, &ldquo;Right here, Tony,&rdquo; as she motioned towards the seat in a theatrical manner.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, Jane,&rdquo; he replied nodding his head in a &ldquo;bro&rdquo; sort of way. Jane headed back toward her seat as Tony stepped into his and sat down. He looked to his left. Pepper was seated with perfect posture already writing diligently on what looked to be like homework. &ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; he said, bending down to get a look at her face, and ultimately trying to start some conversation.</p><p>Pepper jerked her head up. She looked dead in Tony&rsquo;s eyes for a few seconds before looking at his feet. &ldquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m, um, I&rsquo;m Pepper.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he responded. Her eyes shot back up at Tony&rsquo;s. The most beautiful shade of blue he had ever seen. Noticing the dark teal around her iris, he smiled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Tony.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I know, your father owns basically everything in this city.&rdquo; She laughed as she turned back to her work. He had never heard a laugh that made his teeth show under a smile so quickly.</p><p>&ldquo;You have a point,&rdquo; he said swiveling his legs under the desk. He pulled out a binder from his perpetually opened backpack saying, &ldquo;are you working on homework or&hellip;?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah I&rsquo;m doing tutor work for Ms. Danvers for calculus and she gave me the work for this week a few days ago, so I thought I&rsquo;d get a head start so I know what I&rsquo;m doing.&rdquo; She not once looked up at Tony and continued scribbling numbers and symbols on her paper.</p><p>&ldquo;Wow, impressive,&rdquo; Tony laughed. &ldquo;I might need to ask for your help on some calculus too if it comes down to it.&rdquo; He leaned back and rested his hands on his head. He glanced over at Pepper hoping for some sort of eye contact.</p><p>At those words, though, Pepper immediately looked at Tony with a small half-smile. &ldquo;Sure, um, abso-,&rdquo; she stopped herself from sounding too eager. &ldquo;That&rsquo;d be okay.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cool,&rdquo; he said coming back from his resting position. Pepper was&hellip; intriguing to Tony. He&rsquo;d never met a girl who didn&rsquo;t try and be a part of his life immediately. He didn&rsquo;t see it as Pepper playing&nbsp;&lsquo;hard to get&rsquo;, rather she was completely doing her own thing and she was proud of it.</p><p>Tony sat there in silence, thinking about this fascinating girl next to him. She seemed so independent yet kind-hearted. He wanted to be a part of her life, in some way, but knew because of Emma he would have trouble.</p><p>&ldquo;So, Pepper,&rdquo; he began as he opened his binder. Pepper immediately swung around to look at him, though, he saw Jane walking towards the couple. He shuffled his papers and stopped talking, but he was preparing to covertly eavesdrop on the oncoming conversation between Jane and Pepper.</p><p>&ldquo;So tonight, around 7? Stay up till midnight so we can celebrate!&rdquo; He heard Jane say with a sing-song voice, grabbing Pepper&rsquo;s hands. Pepper&rsquo;s attention was completely diverted from Tony&rsquo;s as he continued to listen.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, but don&rsquo;t invite anyone you <i>know</i> I wouldn&rsquo;t want,&rdquo; Pepper retaliated.</p><p>&ldquo;So Tony, do you want to come to Pepper&rsquo;s sleepover tonight? It&rsquo;s her seventeenth birthday!&rdquo; Jane leaned down and rested her chin on Pepper&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;She&rsquo;d love it if you could come.</p><p>Tony saw Pepper pinch Jane&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Well, I mean, I wouldn&rsquo;t want to intrude.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; Jane said, &ldquo;Pepper would love it, wouldn&rsquo;t you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, if you want, Tony.&rdquo; Pepper said looking Tony dead in the eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Um, okay. I&rsquo;ll see if I can swing by after practice tonight.&rdquo; Tony said nodding.</p><p>&ldquo;Great, there&rsquo;s going to be a ton of people. Can&rsquo;t wait!&rdquo; Jane said hugging Pepper. She looked Tony deep in the eyes and then walked off back at her seat as Mr. Lang walked into the room. Tall, built, and always wearing some sort of T-shirt. </p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t wait, Pepper.&rdquo; Tony said looking back at the front of the class. More people had flooded into the room, yet Tony hadn&rsquo;t noticed. The clock almost said 8:30, so Tony slid his phone away and got a few pencils out. 11 hours till Pepper&rsquo;s party. </p><p><i><b>- now that the exposition is done we can get into the real stuff.
