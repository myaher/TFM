However, I\u2019ve not let her have any blueberries and she\u2019s still getting them hives.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d I pouted. \u201cTell you what, we\u2019ll do a chemical test. There must be something else she\u2019s allergic to. Are they a little better now though that she\u2019s not eating blueberries?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMuch better,\u201d Harry looked down at Anne who seemed a bit sleepy on his lap.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. So, the chemical test lasts two days. Basically, there\u2019s little things taped to her back-you know what? She\u2019s four. I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s the best option,\u201d I thought to myself.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? Is it painful?\u201d Harry asked.</p><p>\u201cNot at all but you would have to not shower her for two days, can\u2019t move too much-kids are not able to sit still. We can do a blood test if you\u2019d prefer, it\u2019d be easier only you\u2019d have to wait at least four days for the results&hellip;<i>or</i> we can go with the chemical test directly on the skin but that\u2019s your call.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019ll just do the chemical test.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay. Has she taken any Zyrtec or any other antihistamines recently?\u201d </p><p>\u201cEhm, just last night actually I gave her a bit.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay, so What has to happen in order for the test to be as accurate as possible, she needs to be off of the medication for at a minimum of six days. So when that\u2019s happened, you can bring her back in and we\u2019ll do the test right away. It also requires that she not take any medication within the two days that the test is taking place.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d he nodded.</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d I smiled. \u201c<i>Anne</i>, are you okay?\u201d I smiled at the little girl. </p><p>\u201cI want ice cream and daddy won\u2019t let me have any,\u201d she pouted, upset with her father although she cuddled into his chest. </p><p>He blushed. \u201cYou\u2019ve had ice cream twice yesterday and once today. \u2018s enough ice cream, darling, don\u2019t you think?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, daddy,\u201d she said. \u201cI want <i>more</i> ice cream.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m sorry to hear that,\u201d he laughed.</p><p>I laughed as well. \u201cHow about a sticker? Would you like one of those?\u201d </p><p>She nodded before she looked at Harry. \u201cCan I, Daddy?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes, darling.\u201d </p><p>\u201cFollow me to the front,\u201d I smiled.</p><p>I set out various character and Disney princess stickers in front of her. \u201cTake your pick,\u201d I smiled as I put on my glasses to review some insurance papers. I had to make sure all of my patients were up to date.  </p><p>\u201cI want those two,\u201d she pointed.</p><p>\u201cLove, you only get one-\u201c Harry began, laughing softly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d I smiled. Anne was so darn adorable that if she said she wanted all of them I would have let her take them. \u201cYou said these two?\u201d I asked gently and she nodded as I picked them up. \u201cHere you go.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNow will you stop nagging daddy about ice cream?\u201d Harry asked.</p><p>She nodded with a grin. He put her down and I got to work, but before they left I listened to their conversation. </p><p>\u201cPut then on me, daddy.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhere would you like them?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOn my cheeks,\u201d she answered adorably.</p><p>\u201cYour cheeks?! That\u2019s quite an odd place to put stickers, don\u2019t you think?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll look pretty with them on my cheeks, daddy.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Harry laughed, shaking his head as he bent down to peel the stickers off of the white paper for her and put a sticker on each of her cheeks.</p><p>She grinned. </p><p>\u201c<i>Beautiful</i>,\u201d Harry laughed.</p><p>-</p><p><b>Harry\u2019s pov</b></p><p>Y/N wasn\u2019t at the clinic the day Annie got her chemical test. I asked why and they said she had a family emergency, and I found myself thinking about it more often than not. Does she have kids? A husband? Who exactly is her \u201cfamily\u201d and if there was an emergency, is she okay?</p><p>She was rather attractive and I noticed that immediately. She was effortlessly beautiful, seemingly make up free yet still sexy with her full lips, bright eyes, and full hips. Not to mention her full ass.</p><p>\u201cHello, Anne. How are you?\u201d She grinned at Anne who frowned.</p><p>\u201cNot good. My back has a lot of itchy.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d she pouted. </p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s been pretty bad&hellip;\u201d I agreed.</p><p>\u201cOkay, well at least now we can take them off, yeah?\u201d She said sadly. \u201cDo you mind taking your shirt off for me?\u201d</p><p>Annie looked at me first for permission. I nodded, standing to be beside her. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d I helped her take her shirt off.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, I see why it was such a bother,\u201d Y/N frowned and seemed saddened at the sight of the hives on my daughters small back.</p><p>\u201cSeems like,\u201d Y/N looked down at her papers. \u201cPollen andddd&hellip;dust mites. She\u2019s allergic to pollen and dust. Very allergic actually.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s never been allergic to any of that. Not even blueberries. Where is all of this coming from?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, Mr-uh, <i>Harry</i>, people develope allergies all the time. At any age. Typically we see it in teens but it\u2019s very common in young children as well. Normally, when it\u2019s present in teens it\u2019s more likely to go away than in young children, but it\u2019s possible that some if not all of her allergies will subside the older she gets,\u201d she spoke, and oddly her intelligence turned me on.</p><p>\u201cOh, okay..\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>Daddy</i>, I\u2019m itchy,\u201d Annie whined. </p><p>I gently scratched her back. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you some cream, love,\u201d Y/N said gently as she turned to the cabinets in the room. She rubbed some onto Annie\u2019s back gently. \u201cHow does that feel? Nice and cool?\u201d </p><p>Annie nodded. Y/N then blew onto where she\u2019d put the cream, her lips puckering and I\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t feel myself grow. Annie hummed at the feeling.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still itchy,\u201d she complained after a moment.</p><p>\u201cI know. You just have to remember not to touch it. It\u2019ll go away. Here, have some medicine,\u201d she poured Annie some of the grape Zyrtec she had prescribed her. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna make the itchy got away like <i>that</i>,\u201d Y/N snapped her fingers. </p><p>\u201cScratch my back,\u201d Anne whined to me. </p><p>So I did. However, Y/N objected.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d she reached foward and pulled down Anne\u2019s shirt. \u201cRub,\u201d she rubbed Anne\u2019s back up and down quickly. \u201cIt\u2019ll help the itch while not irritating the hives too much. Scratching will make it worse and harder for the medication to fight the hives.\u201d </p><p>I nodded as I rubbed Anne\u2019s back over her shirt rather than scratching her skin.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Harry, so the solution to her allergies is allergy shots. These are weekly shots-she will be receiving two-one for pollen and one for dust mites. At first they may cause her to breakout, but over time it is building up immunity to the things she is allergic to so that eventually, she may at least be able to tolerate pollen and dust, or even be completely immune to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery week? Will that affect her at all?\u201d </p><p>\u201cUhm, it may cause a bit of sleepiness but it won\u2019t be severe.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay, then. And it\u2019s proven to help?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s very affective actually. I did it becuase I also had allergies to dust mites and it helped me tremendously. All of my patients get really good results.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I smiled. The fact that she\u2019s so successful turns me on so much and I couldn\u2019t ignore it. \u201cSo I have to bring her here every week or is it possible for me to give her the shot at home?\u201d </p><p>\u201cUhm, no. It\u2019s takes a lot of preparing each day and it\u2019s very specific. You would have to bring her here every week. I can give you a minute to think about it, if you want?\u201d </p><p>\u201cEh&hellip;it\u2019s just I don\u2019t have much time to be brining her&hellip;I could have the nanny do it&hellip;\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell it\u2019d have to be you since you\u2019re her father&hellip;\u201d </p><p>I sighed as I ran my fingers through my hair. As I looked at my daughter who had a pained face because of her itchy back I didn\u2019t have anything else to think about. \u201cOkay. How soon can we start them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can start today actually, if you\u2019d like. I just have to go get the paperwork beforehand.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I nodded.                                                            <b><i>Y/N\u2019s pov</i></b></p><p>I had my nurse bring Harry the paperwork while I took care of my other two patients.

They\u2019re much smaller and you can barely feel them. We give them to you in your arm, and you pick the area. Overtime we\u2019ll learn what spot on your arm doesn\u2019t hurt. Okay?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d Anne cried.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be really fast,\u201d I said. \u201cI promise. And when we\u2019re done I\u2019ll let you get two more stickers. How does that sound?\u201d </p><p>\u201c&hellip;.okay&hellip;.\u201d </p><p>Harry laughed, looking up at me as I smiled.</p><p>\u201cOkay, honey. Which arm do you want them on? Or we can do one each.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do one each. Yeah?\u201d Harry asked Anne who nodded.</p><p>\u201cOkay&hellip;\u201d I cleaned an area on Anne\u2019s arm, near the back of her shoulder. \u201cSo Anne, sometimes when I squeeze the skin a little where I\u2019m going to give the shot it makes it less painful. Would you like me to try that or no?\u201d</p><p>Anne nodded.</p><p>\u201cOkay, here\u2019s goes the first one, for pollen,\u201d I spoke as I gently squeezed Anne\u2019s skin then gave her the shot. </p><p>Anne was tearing up. \u201cOkay, do it,\u201d she whimpered, making Harry laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou got the shot ages ago, Annie!\u201d Harry laughed, making her laugh as well as she wiped her tears.</p><p>\u201cOkay, ready for the next one?\u201d I asked, and Anne nodded.</p><p><i><b>- <a href=\"https://and-im-okay-with-it.tumblr.com/post/175559495326/it-was-our-third-visit-for-annes-shots-i\">Next part&gt;&gt;</a>                        <a href=\"https://and-im-okay-with-it.tumblr.com/post/175259280741/masterlist-taking-requests\">Masterlist</a></b></i></p>",

However, I\u2019ve not let her have any blueberries and she\u2019s still getting them hives.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d I pouted. \u201cTell you what, we\u2019ll do a chemical test. There must be something else she\u2019s allergic to. Are they a little better now though that she\u2019s not eating blueberries?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMuch better,\u201d Harry looked down at Anne who seemed a bit sleepy on his lap.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. So, the chemical test lasts two days. Basically, there\u2019s little things taped to her back-you know what? She\u2019s four. I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s the best option,\u201d I thought to myself.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? Is it painful?\u201d Harry asked.</p><p>\u201cNot at all but you would have to not shower her for two days, can\u2019t move too much-kids are not able to sit still. We can do a blood test if you\u2019d prefer, it\u2019d be easier only you\u2019d have to wait at least four days for the results\u2026<i>or</i> we can go with the chemical test directly on the skin but that\u2019s your call.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019ll just do the chemical test.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay.

However, I\u2019ve not let her have any blueberries and she\u2019s still getting them hives.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d I pouted. \u201cTell you what, we\u2019ll do a chemical test. There must be something else she\u2019s allergic to. Are they a little better now though that she\u2019s not eating blueberries?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMuch better,\u201d Harry looked down at Anne who seemed a bit sleepy on his lap.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. So, the chemical test lasts two days. Basically, there\u2019s little things taped to her back-you know what? She\u2019s four. I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s the best option,\u201d I thought to myself.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? Is it painful?\u201d Harry asked.</p><p>\u201cNot at all but you would have to not shower her for two days, can\u2019t move too much-kids are not able to sit still. We can do a blood test if you\u2019d prefer, it\u2019d be easier only you\u2019d have to wait at least four days for the results\u2026<i>or</i> we can go with the chemical test directly on the skin but that\u2019s your call.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019ll just do the chemical test.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay. Has she taken any Zyrtec or any other antihistamines recently?\u201d </p><p>\u201cEhm, just last night actually I gave her a bit.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay, so What has to happen in order for the test to be as accurate as possible, she needs to be off of the medication for at a minimum of six days. So when that\u2019s happened, you can bring her back in and we\u2019ll do the test right away. It also requires that she not take any medication within the two days that the test is taking place.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d he nodded.</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d I smiled. \u201c<i>Anne</i>, are you okay?\u201d I smiled at the little girl. </p><p>\u201cI want ice cream and daddy won\u2019t let me have any,\u201d she pouted, upset with her father although she cuddled into his chest. </p><p>He blushed. \u201cYou\u2019ve had ice cream twice yesterday and once today. \u2018s enough ice cream, darling, don\u2019t you think?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, daddy,\u201d she said. \u201cI want <i>more</i> ice cream.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m sorry to hear that,\u201d he laughed.</p><p>I laughed as well. \u201cHow about a sticker? Would you like one of those?\u201d </p><p>She nodded before she looked at Harry. \u201cCan I, Daddy?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes, darling.\u201d </p><p>\u201cFollow me to the front,\u201d I smiled.</p><p>I set out various character and Disney princess stickers in front of her. \u201cTake your pick,\u201d I smiled as I put on my glasses to review some insurance papers. I had to make sure all of my patients were up to date.  </p><p>\u201cI want those two,\u201d she pointed.</p><p>\u201cLove, you only get one-\u201c Harry began, laughing softly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d I smiled. Anne was so darn adorable that if she said she wanted all of them I would have let her take them. \u201cYou said these two?\u201d I asked gently and she nodded as I picked them up. \u201cHere you go.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNow will you stop nagging daddy about ice cream?\u201d Harry asked.</p><p>She nodded with a grin. He put her down and I got to work, but before they left I listened to their conversation. </p><p>\u201cPut then on me, daddy.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhere would you like them?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOn my cheeks,\u201d she answered adorably.</p><p>\u201cYour cheeks?! That\u2019s quite an odd place to put stickers, don\u2019t you think?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll look pretty with them on my cheeks, daddy.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Harry laughed, shaking his head as he bent down to peel the stickers off of the white paper for her and put a sticker on each of her cheeks.</p><p>She grinned. </p><p>\u201c<i>Beautiful</i>,\u201d Harry laughed.</p><p>-</p><p><b>Harry\u2019s pov</b></p><p>Y/N wasn\u2019t at the clinic the day Annie got her chemical test. I asked why and they said she had a family emergency, and I found myself thinking about it more often than not. Does she have kids? A husband? Who exactly is her \u201cfamily\u201d and if there was an emergency, is she okay?</p><p>She was rather attractive and I noticed that immediately. She was effortlessly beautiful, seemingly make up free yet still sexy with her full lips, bright eyes, and full hips. Not to mention her full ass.</p><p>\u201cHello, Anne. How are you?\u201d She grinned at Anne who frowned.</p><p>\u201cNot good. My back has a lot of itchy.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d she pouted. </p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s been pretty bad\u2026\u201d I agreed.</p><p>\u201cOkay, well at least now we can take them off, yeah?\u201d She said sadly. \u201cDo you mind taking your shirt off for me?\u201d</p><p>Annie looked at me first for permission. I nodded, standing to be beside her. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d I helped her take her shirt off.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, I see why it was such a bother,\u201d Y/N frowned and seemed saddened at the sight of the hives on my daughters small back.</p><p>\u201cSeems like,\u201d Y/N looked down at her papers. \u201cPollen andddd\u2026dust mites. She\u2019s allergic to pollen and dust. Very allergic actually.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s never been allergic to any of that. Not even blueberries. Where is all of this coming from?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, Mr-uh, <i>Harry</i>, people develope allergies all the time. At any age. Typically we see it in teens but it\u2019s very common in young children as well. Normally, when it\u2019s present in teens it\u2019s more likely to go away than in young children, but it\u2019s possible that some if not all of her allergies will subside the older she gets,\u201d she spoke, and oddly her intelligence turned me on.</p><p>\u201cOh, okay..\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>Daddy</i>, I\u2019m itchy,\u201d Annie whined. </p><p>I gently scratched her back. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you some cream, love,\u201d Y/N said gently as she turned to the cabinets in the room. She rubbed some onto Annie\u2019s back gently. \u201cHow does that feel? Nice and cool?\u201d </p><p>Annie nodded. Y/N then blew onto where she\u2019d put the cream, her lips puckering and I\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t feel myself grow. Annie hummed at the feeling.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still itchy,\u201d she complained after a moment.</p><p>\u201cI know. You just have to remember not to touch it. It\u2019ll go away. Here, have some medicine,\u201d she poured Annie some of the grape Zyrtec she had prescribed her. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna make the itchy got away like <i>that</i>,\u201d Y/N snapped her fingers. </p><p>\u201cScratch my back,\u201d Anne whined to me. </p><p>So I did. However, Y/N objected.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d she reached foward and pulled down Anne\u2019s shirt. \u201cRub,\u201d she rubbed Anne\u2019s back up and down quickly. \u201cIt\u2019ll help the itch while not irritating the hives too much. Scratching will make it worse and harder for the medication to fight the hives.\u201d </p><p>I nodded as I rubbed Anne\u2019s back over her shirt rather than scratching her skin.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Harry, so the solution to her allergies is allergy shots. These are weekly shots-she will be receiving two-one for pollen and one for dust mites. At first they may cause her to breakout, but over time it is building up immunity to the things she is allergic to so that eventually, she may at least be able to tolerate pollen and dust, or even be completely immune to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery week? Will that affect her at all?\u201d </p><p>\u201cUhm, it may cause a bit of sleepiness but it won\u2019t be severe.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay, then. And it\u2019s proven to help?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s very affective actually. I did it becuase I also had allergies to dust mites and it helped me tremendously. All of my patients get really good results.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I smiled. The fact that she\u2019s so successful turns me on so much and I couldn\u2019t ignore it. \u201cSo I have to bring her here every week or is it possible for me to give her the shot at home?\u201d </p><p>\u201cUhm, no. It\u2019s takes a lot of preparing each day and it\u2019s very specific. You would have to bring her here every week. I can give you a minute to think about it, if you want?\u201d </p><p>\u201cEh\u2026it\u2019s just I don\u2019t have much time to be brining her\u2026I could have the nanny do it\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell it\u2019d have to be you since you\u2019re her father\u2026\u201d </p><p>I sighed as I ran my fingers through my hair. As I looked at my daughter who had a pained face because of her itchy back I didn\u2019t have anything else to think about. \u201cOkay. How soon can we start them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can start today actually, if you\u2019d like. I just have to go get the paperwork beforehand.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I nodded.                                                            <b><i>Y/N\u2019s pov</i></b></p><p>I had my nurse bring Harry the paperwork while I took care of my other two patients. Today was a slow day.</p><p>I knocked before entering Anne\u2019s room.</p><p>\u201cDid you finish or do you need a bit more time?\u201d I asked Harry.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all done, love,\u201d he handed me the papers.</p><p>\u201cOkay, perfect,\u201d I smiled as I took them. </p><p>\u201cYou guys can stay here while I go get the shots.\u201d </p><p>I returned quickly and Anne was crying on her father\u2019s lap.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Anne?\u201d I was concerned.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t like shots very much,\u201d Harry answered. </p><p>\u201cOh, these aren\u2019t regular shots like the ones you get at a doctor. They\u2019re much smaller and you can barely feel them. We give them to you in your arm, and you pick the area. Overtime we\u2019ll learn what spot on your arm doesn\u2019t hurt. Okay?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d Anne cried.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be really fast,\u201d I said. \u201cI promise. And when we\u2019re done I\u2019ll let you get two more stickers. How does that sound?\u201d </p><p>\u201c\u2026.okay\u2026.\u201d </p><p>Harry laughed, looking up at me as I smiled.</p><p>\u201cOkay, honey. Which arm do you want them on? Or we can do one each.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do one each. Yeah?\u201d Harry asked Anne who nodded.</p><p>\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d I cleaned an area on Anne\u2019s arm, near the back of her shoulder. \u201cSo Anne, sometimes when I squeeze the skin a little where I\u2019m going to give the shot it makes it less painful.

She&rsquo;s allergic to pollen and dust. Very allergic actually.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;But she&rsquo;s never been allergic to any of that. Not even blueberries. Where is all of this coming from?&rdquo; I asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, Mr-uh, <i>Harry</i>, people develope allergies all the time. At any age. Typically we see it in teens but it&rsquo;s very common in young children as well. Normally, when it&rsquo;s present in teens it&rsquo;s more likely to go away than in young children, but it&rsquo;s possible that some if not all of her allergies will subside the older she gets,&rdquo; she spoke, and oddly her intelligence turned me on.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, okay..&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Daddy</i>, I&rsquo;m itchy,&rdquo; Annie whined. </p><p>I gently scratched her back. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get you some cream, love,&rdquo; Y/N said gently as she turned to the cabinets in the room. She rubbed some onto Annie&rsquo;s back gently. &ldquo;How does that feel? Nice and cool?&rdquo; </p><p>Annie nodded. Y/N then blew onto where she&rsquo;d put the cream, her lips puckering and I&rsquo;d be lying if I said I didn&rsquo;t feel myself grow. Annie hummed at the feeling.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s still itchy,&rdquo; she complained after a moment.</p><p>&ldquo;I know. You just have to remember not to touch it. It&rsquo;ll go away. Here, have some medicine,&rdquo; she poured Annie some of the grape Zyrtec she had prescribed her. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s gonna make the itchy got away like <i>that</i>,&rdquo; Y/N snapped her fingers. </p><p>&ldquo;Scratch my back,&rdquo; Anne whined to me. </p><p>So I did. However, Y/N objected.</p><p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; she reached foward and pulled down Anne&rsquo;s shirt. &ldquo;Rub,&rdquo; she rubbed Anne&rsquo;s back up and down quickly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll help the itch while not irritating the hives too much. Scratching will make it worse and harder for the medication to fight the hives.&rdquo; </p><p>I nodded as I rubbed Anne&rsquo;s back over her shirt rather than scratching her skin.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, Harry, so the solution to her allergies is allergy shots. These are weekly shots-she will be receiving two-one for pollen and one for dust mites. At first they may cause her to breakout, but over time it is building up immunity to the things she is allergic to so that eventually, she may at least be able to tolerate pollen and dust, or even be completely immune to it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Every week? Will that affect her at all?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Uhm, it may cause a bit of sleepiness but it won&rsquo;t be severe.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Okay, then. And it&rsquo;s proven to help?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yes. It&rsquo;s very affective actually. I did it becuase I also had allergies to dust mites and it helped me tremendously. All of my patients get really good results.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; I smiled. The fact that she&rsquo;s so successful turns me on so much and I couldn&rsquo;t ignore it. &ldquo;So I have to bring her here every week or is it possible for me to give her the shot at home?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Uhm, no. It&rsquo;s takes a lot of preparing each day and it&rsquo;s very specific. You would have to bring her here every week. I can give you a minute to think about it, if you want?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Eh&hellip;it&rsquo;s just I don&rsquo;t have much time to be brining her&hellip;I could have the nanny do it&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well it&rsquo;d have to be you since you&rsquo;re her father&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>I sighed as I ran my fingers through my hair. As I looked at my daughter who had a pained face because of her itchy back I didn&rsquo;t have anything else to think about. &ldquo;Okay. How soon can we start them?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We can start today actually, if you&rsquo;d like. I just have to go get the paperwork beforehand.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; I nodded.                                                            <b><i>Y/N&rsquo;s pov</i></b></p><p>I had my nurse bring Harry the paperwork while I took care of my other two patients. Today was a slow day.</p><p>I knocked before entering Anne&rsquo;s room.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you finish or do you need a bit more time?&rdquo; I asked Harry.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all done, love,&rdquo; he handed me the papers.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, perfect,&rdquo; I smiled as I took them. </p><p>&ldquo;You guys can stay here while I go get the shots.&rdquo; </p><p>I returned quickly and Anne was crying on her father&rsquo;s lap.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, Anne?&rdquo; I was concerned.</p><p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t like shots very much,&rdquo; Harry answered. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, these aren&rsquo;t regular shots like the ones you get at a doctor. They&rsquo;re much smaller and you can barely feel them. We give them to you in your arm, and you pick the area. Overtime we&rsquo;ll learn what spot on your arm doesn&rsquo;t hurt. Okay?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m scared,&rdquo; Anne cried.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be really fast,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I promise. And when we&rsquo;re done I&rsquo;ll let you get two more stickers. How does that sound?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;.okay&hellip;.&rdquo; </p><p>Harry laughed, looking up at me as I smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, honey. Which arm do you want them on? Or we can do one each.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do one each. Yeah?&rdquo; Harry asked Anne who nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay&hellip;&rdquo; I cleaned an area on Anne&rsquo;s arm, near the back of her shoulder. &ldquo;So Anne, sometimes when I squeeze the skin a little where I&rsquo;m going to give the shot it makes it less painful. Would you like me to try that or no?&rdquo;</p><p>Anne nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, here&rsquo;s goes the first one, for pollen,&rdquo; I spoke as I gently squeezed Anne&rsquo;s skin then gave her the shot. </p><p>Anne was tearing up. &ldquo;Okay, do it,&rdquo; she whimpered, making Harry laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;You got the shot ages ago, Annie!&rdquo; Harry laughed, making her laugh as well as she wiped her tears.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, ready for the next one?&rdquo; I asked, and Anne nodded.</p><p><i><b>- <a href=\"https://and-im-okay-with-it.tumblr.com/post/175559495326/it-was-our-third-visit-for-annes-shots-i\">Next part&gt;&gt;</a>                        <a href=\"https://and-im-okay-with-it.tumblr.com/post/175259280741/masterlist-taking-requests\">Masterlist</a></b></i></p></p>",
