That doesn\u2019t happen everyday. And wow, what quote.\u00a0</p><p>Context first: the quotes come from the James Cameron\u2019s <i>Story of Science Fiction</i> book, which accompanies a four episodes, ehr, documentary series of the same name &ndash; I haven\u2019t watched the series or read the book and wouldn\u2019t have without that quote, but I\u2019ll be doing that in the next weeks. Both are quite recent, google tells me the series was release in April (2018) and the book in May. In all likelihood the quotes used in the book come from interviews conducted for the TV series.</p><p>As a disclaimer of sorts &ndash; \u201cLucas on future stories and how much they\u2019re planned\u201d covers a range of quotes that go from fully honest to intentionally misleading and chart many changes in the conception of that future through the years. Without anything corroborating or invalidating it it\u2019s hard to know where these new quotes fall. They also come from an interview not particularly focused on Lucas\u2019 would-have-been ST and conducted what, five years or so after he stopped working on it. Basically some fuzziness is to be expected, and imo it could hardly be more open to interpretation.</p><!-- more --><ul><li>I\u2019ve never seen the Whills mentioned within the context of the ST (beyond speculation of course), even less what little we\u2019ve been told of Lucas\u2019 plans for it &ndash; which, as the tweet noted, are pretty much only known through what other people have said, and can be resumed to: Luke would have been there as an aged master, and the protagonist would have been his student, a woman on her path to Jedi-hood, because Lucas had done two dudes already.\u00a0</li><ul><li>It\u2019s not really a discrepancy, since that premise is compatible with Whills-y happenings, but it\u2019s interesting it wasn\u2019t \n\never \n\nmentioned before. A few possible reasons: it\u2019s pretty obscure lore and wouldn\u2019t speak to much of the audience. It\u2019s definitely not where the ST is going, and the official narrative would rather stress the similarities between Lucas\u2019 early plans and the final product. It clashes against the Whills as conceived in the new canon and inspired by Lucas\u2019 older conceptions of them (<a href=\"https://whillshistory.blogspot.com/2017/05/the-whills-from-star-wars-prehistory-to.html\" target=\"_blank\">they changed</a>). It\u2019s never made it out of Lucas\u2019 head and onto paper, or only as obscure notes. It\u2019s what he would have done <i>now </i>that he thinks about it (again, very recent interviews), and not what he would have done <i>before </i>selling the franchise. It\u2019s really fucking weird as far as stories goes. It\u2019s kept in reserve for some future story.\u00a0</li></ul><li>\u201cmicrobiotic world\u201d &ndash; that\u2019s super interesting if very obscure. Microbiotic has to do with microbiomes, ie. microbial biomes. A biome is a geographically defined ensemble of ecosystems, characterized by its climate, flora, and fauna. It\u2019s not a static thing &ndash; it\u2019s a lot of variables with complex feedback relationships. A microbiome is basically the same thing but with microbial organisms and on a much, much smaller scale, like the insides of you. I don\u2019t know what Lucas meant by it, but I think we can cross a literal <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Voyage\" target=\"_blank\">Fantastic Voyage</a> off the list I. I\u2019m very curious to see other people think of it, but for now I lean towards it\u2019s metaphorical, and it\u2019s a tortuous way to talk about the unseen web of relationships between living things, which in the GFFA is infused with Meaning (the Force). The important thing, and you\u2019ll see I can even bring the balance into it, is that again, a\u00a0\u201cmicrobiotic world\u201d is not a static system &ndash; i\u2019ll try and illustrate with a biome, because same notion: let\u2019s say a given year you have, idk, less rain than average; that\u2019s going to affect vegetation growth, which in turn is going to affect animals. Herbivores will have less to eat and population numbers will be impacted, which will then impact carnivores. It\u2019s a lot more complicated, but the general idea is basically that if you change a variable, the others will be affected like ripples. It\u2019s a very strong system, very adaptable, <i>but </i>at some point if there\u2019s too much stress put on it, it can collapse which is&hellip; not good. Something something balance. And I can\u2019t not think about midi-chlorians, because they\u2019d very much be part of microbiomes in the GFFA, and because even metaphorically you can\u2019t really talk microbiome without talking symbiosis &ndash; which was a theme touched upon in TPM, partly through the midi-chlorians. [Insert conspiracy board picture]\u00a0</li><li>The Whills operating differently than ehr, regular beings works with what we knew of them already; it\u2019s always risky trying to nail down specifics wrt the Whills, but until now it seemed to be more of a\u00a0\u201canother plane of existence\u201d kind of deal rather than a\u00a0\u201cmicrobiotic world\u201d one, so that\u2019s interesting.\u00a0</li><li>The controlling the universe bit, on the other hand that\u2019s&hellip; mostly new. Though there was never much to learn about them,\u00a0 observers more than anything; incredibly powerful, operating on a whole other level of existence, ascended beings of a sort, pretty much beyond mortality, quite ineffable, and very much a narrative device. They were conceived as a framing device (the Journal of the Whills of the OT) and repurposed for the PT to stress the fact that Force ghostery was a Big Deal, and started as observers more than anything, an they aren\u2019t known to have directly intervened in the GFFA. I can\u2019t remember anything specifying that no, they don\u2019t intervene, ever, and imo there\u2019s grounds to speculate they\u2019ve got nothing against <i>indirect </i>action. And they were always supposed to be incredibly powerful, with an understanding and knowledge of the Force pretty much beyond that of the Jedi / any Force tradition in the GFFA. I don\u2019t think Lucas means <i>control </i>as in everything happens because of them and free will doesn\u2019t exist and neither does happenstance. Going back to the biome/microbiome and the concept of a complex web of relationships between living things that, if too stressed,\n\n can collapse&hellip; if the concept of the Whills wasn\u2019t to be completely reinvented, they could have easily fit in such a system, as entities both within and without, making sure that collapse doesn\u2019t happen by influencing events.\u00a0</li><li>Okay, next we learn they feed off the Force, and I always did love the\u00a0\u201cthe Force is parasitic\u201d kind of speculation, and I would so have been there for the version of the ST in which the Whills are some bad news eldritch beings, but&hellip; idk. It just doesn\u2019t feel very Lucas.

Basically some fuzziness is to be expected, and imo it could hardly be more open to interpretation.</p><ul><li>I&rsquo;ve never seen the Whills mentioned within the context of the ST (beyond speculation of course), even less what little we&rsquo;ve been told of Lucas&rsquo; plans for it &ndash; which, as the tweet noted, are pretty much only known through what other people have said, and can be resumed to: Luke would have been there as an aged master, and the protagonist would have been his student, a woman on her path to Jedi-hood, because Lucas had done two dudes already.&nbsp;</li><ul><li>It&rsquo;s not really a discrepancy, since that premise is compatible with Whills-y happenings, but it&rsquo;s interesting it wasn&rsquo;t \n\never \n\nmentioned before. A few possible reasons: it&rsquo;s pretty obscure lore and wouldn&rsquo;t speak to much of the audience. It&rsquo;s definitely not where the ST is going, and the official narrative would rather stress the similarities between Lucas&rsquo; early plans and the final product. It clashes against the Whills as conceived in the new canon and inspired by Lucas&rsquo; older conceptions of them (<a href=\"https://whillshistory.blogspot.com/2017/05/the-whills-from-star-wars-prehistory-to.html\" target=\"_blank\">they changed</a>). It&rsquo;s never made it out of Lucas&rsquo; head and onto paper, or only as obscure notes. It&rsquo;s what he would have done <i>now </i>that he thinks about it (again, very recent interviews), and not what he would have done <i>before </i>selling the franchise. It&rsquo;s really fucking weird as far as stories goes. It&rsquo;s kept in reserve for some future story.&nbsp;</li></ul><li>&ldquo;microbiotic world&rdquo; &ndash; that&rsquo;s super interesting if very obscure. Microbiotic has to do with microbiomes, ie. microbial biomes. A biome is a geographically defined ensemble of ecosystems, characterized by its climate, flora, and fauna. It&rsquo;s not a static thing &ndash; it&rsquo;s a lot of variables with complex feedback relationships. A microbiome is basically the same thing but with microbial organisms and on a much, much smaller scale, like the insides of you. I don&rsquo;t know what Lucas meant by it, but I think we can cross a literal <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Voyage\" target=\"_blank\">Fantastic Voyage</a> off the list I. I&rsquo;m very curious to see other people think of it, but for now I lean towards it&rsquo;s metaphorical, and it&rsquo;s a tortuous way to talk about the unseen web of relationships between living things, which in the GFFA is infused with Meaning (the Force). The important thing, and you&rsquo;ll see I can even bring the balance into it, is that again, a&nbsp;&ldquo;microbiotic world&rdquo; is not a static system &ndash; i&rsquo;ll try and illustrate with a biome, because same notion: let&rsquo;s say a given year you have, idk, less rain than average; that&rsquo;s going to affect vegetation growth, which in turn is going to affect animals. Herbivores will have less to eat and population numbers will be impacted, which will then impact carnivores. It&rsquo;s a lot more complicated, but the general idea is basically that if you change a variable, the others will be affected like ripples. It&rsquo;s a very strong system, very adaptable, <i>but </i>at some point if there&rsquo;s too much stress put on it, it can collapse which is&hellip; not good. Something something balance. And I can&rsquo;t not think about midi-chlorians, because they&rsquo;d very much be part of microbiomes in the GFFA, and because even metaphorically you can&rsquo;t really talk microbiome without talking symbiosis &ndash; which was a theme touched upon in TPM, partly through the midi-chlorians. [Insert conspiracy board picture]&nbsp;</li><li>The Whills operating differently than ehr, regular beings works with what we knew of them already; it&rsquo;s always risky trying to nail down specifics wrt the Whills, but until now it seemed to be more of a&nbsp;&ldquo;another plane of existence&rdquo; kind of deal rather than a&nbsp;&ldquo;microbiotic world&rdquo; one, so that&rsquo;s interesting.&nbsp;</li><li>The controlling the universe bit, on the other hand that&rsquo;s&hellip; mostly new. Though there was never much to learn about them,&nbsp; observers more than anything; incredibly powerful, operating on a whole other level of existence, ascended beings of a sort, pretty much beyond mortality, quite ineffable, and very much a narrative device. They were conceived as a framing device (the Journal of the Whills of the OT) and repurposed for the PT to stress the fact that Force ghostery was a Big Deal, and started as observers more than anything, an they aren&rsquo;t known to have directly intervened in the GFFA. I can&rsquo;t remember anything specifying that no, they don&rsquo;t intervene, ever, and imo there&rsquo;s grounds to speculate they&rsquo;ve got nothing against <i>indirect </i>action. And they were always supposed to be incredibly powerful, with an understanding and knowledge of the Force pretty much beyond that of the Jedi / any Force tradition in the GFFA. I don&rsquo;t think Lucas means <i>control </i>as in everything happens because of them and free will doesn&rsquo;t exist and neither does happenstance. Going back to the biome/microbiome and the concept of a complex web of relationships between living things that, if too stressed,\n\n can collapse&hellip; if the concept of the Whills wasn&rsquo;t to be completely reinvented, they could have easily fit in such a system, as entities both within and without, making sure that collapse doesn&rsquo;t happen by influencing events.&nbsp;</li><li>Okay, next we learn they feed off the Force, and I always did love the&nbsp;&ldquo;the Force is parasitic&rdquo; kind of speculation, and I would so have been there for the version of the ST in which the Whills are some bad news eldritch beings, but&hellip; idk. It just doesn&rsquo;t feel very Lucas. I do think his ST would have had its own identity and its share of&nbsp;&ldquo;what you thought was wrong&rdquo; moments, and it&rsquo;s true the Whills were pretty obscure as far as lore go so not the hardest thing to retcon, but still that&rsquo;s a pretty big departure. But again, it&rsquo;s pretty open to interpretation &ndash; is it a negative thing? or more of a natural kind of process? No way to know, at least until we&rsquo;re told more.&nbsp;</li><li>Tbh I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;d be much to tell anyway; Lucas had barely begun working on the ST when he sold the franchise, and whatever his initial notes and outline covered, it would have gone through many changes. I mean, the Whills were initially supposed to be in the OT, then they were supposed to be in the PT, and I think that&rsquo;s beautiful (and ironic) that apparently they were supposed to be in the ST at some point, but there&rsquo;s about no way to know if they&rsquo;d have made it to the final cut.&nbsp;</li><li>Thanks to the second quote, I can just hear a thousand voices screaming &ldquo;lucas did have a master plan!!&rdquo; and I wish that notion would have died off by now. That&rsquo;s about the nicest thing I have to say on the second quote.&nbsp;</li></ul></p>",

Both are quite recent, google tells me the series was release in April (2018) and the book in May. In all likelihood the quotes used in the book come from interviews conducted for the TV series.</p>\n<p>As a disclaimer of sorts &ndash; &ldquo;Lucas on future stories and how much they&rsquo;re planned&rdquo; covers a range of quotes that go from fully honest to intentionally misleading and chart many changes in the conception of that future through the years.

They also come from an interview not particularly focused on Lucas&rsquo; would-have-been ST and conducted what, five years or so after he stopped working on it.

                "content": "<p>\n<p>So, Solo: A Star Wars Story is eventually in theaters. It&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/solo-star-wars-story-review/\">fun</a>! It <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/box-office-preview-solo-headed-lowest-opening-disney-star-wars-movies-1114228\" target=\"_blank\">might not be blowing up the box office</a>, but tribes are still reading it in droves and when they do they&rsquo;re in for a really nice period.( Alden Ehrenreich is a fun, swaggering Han Solo; Donald Glover is a sexy, swaggering Lando Calrissian; Phoebe Waller-Bridge is a smartass, swaggering droid .) They&rsquo;re also in for at least one big-hearted surprise&ndash;and a few slightly smaller delights. But we&rsquo;ll get at all of that in a second. First we need to give tribes afraid of spoilers a chance to show themselves out. OK, everyone&rsquo;s been forewarned. From here on out it&rsquo;s merely WIRED writers and editors Brendan Nystedt, Jason Parham, and Angela Watercutter dissecting Solo in detail. Make like Chewie and join us.</p>\n<p>Angela Watercutter, Senior Associate Editor: Alright people, I&rsquo;m going to go out on a limb here( OK ,  not a crazy leg; like the type of limb some ambitious dads turned into a tree terrace, or put a swing on &hellip;): I liked Solo. Maybe that was the result of low-grade beliefs, maybe I just really adoration Glover&rsquo;s Lando&ndash;I dunno. I merely thought it was merriment. It&rsquo;s not going in my Top 5 Star Wars films, but I at least thought it was better than Rogue One.( Rotten Tomatoes disagrees with me here.
