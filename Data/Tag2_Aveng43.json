So why use six infinity stones at once? What if each stone was put into its own bracelet or ring. Six stones for six avengers. Each of them wears one and they all come together and snap at the same time.\u00a0</p><p>Of course this would make sense if the original six avengers were all alive. But since Natasha died to get the soul stone, I guess there would have to be some type of replacement (which i hate but stay with me here)</p><p>There could be this dramatic shot of the six avengers standing side by side, each of them wielding an infinity stone, then all snapping at once.\u00a0They combine their powers and wills and this way, not only can thanos and his army get dusted, but each avenger would be able to bring back what they lost! Thor could bring back Loki and the fallen asgardians, Hawkeye could bring back Nat, etc. And the best part? no one dies! no sacrifices! no trading lives!</p><p>And if the reason that the avengers <i>lost</i> in infinity was cause they were divided, then this ending would\u2019ve been perfect! Cause it would\u2019ve shown that when the avengers unite? when they work together? There\u2019s no fight that they can\u2019t win. And you can call that cheesy if you want but I think that\u2019s a far better message than the one that endgame sent.</p>",

While the scene they had was sweet, do you think Marvel dropped the ball with no reunion during the final battle?

None. Zip. Zero. For all we know, he and Peggy rescued Bucky and lived a long, happy, poly life together.

He\u2019s getting one right now - he\u2019s been getting one since the second he pulled Steve from the Potomac.\u00a0 He was given time and space to find himself between TWS and CACW, he was given even more time in Wakanda after CACW, and now he\u2019s got even MORE time after Endgame.</p><p>1b) Also, we have NO idea what Steve was up to in his alternate timeline life. None. Zip. Zero. For all we know, he and Peggy rescued Bucky and lived a long, happy, poly life together. Or they rescued Bucky and then Bucky went off to explore the world or went to work for the SSR or became a dentist in Pacoima. But, no matter WHAT Steve did when he went back in the past, it still changes NOTHING about Bucky\u2019s past, because it\u2019s already happened. You cannot change your own past. This was clearly explained in the film by Bruce and Nebula.<br></p><p>2) STEVE WAS ONLY GONE FOR FIVE SECONDS - Bucky did not have TIME to miss him.\u00a0 I am so sick of repeating this, but I guess I\u2019ll keep doing it until it sinks in.\u00a0 Steve grew old, yes, but he\u2019s not dead, and while HE was gone a long time, he was only away from Bucky and Sam and the rest of his friends for five seconds of their time. (And it\u2019s hilarious how I still have not heard a single Sam fan talk about what a betrayal it was that Steve left Sam. It\u2019s almost like Sam fans understand that he\u2019s a grown man who has a life outside Steve.)<br></p><p>3) Which brings me to my final point - Steve and Bucky\u2019s lives don\u2019t revolve around each other, and never have, not even in the MCU. They spent way more time apart than they ever did together. They\u2019re not some codependent siamese couple incapable of having separate lives. So yes, Steve could leave and go back to the past and live a rich, full life of his choosing and know that he\u2019ll still see his friends and get to tell them all about it, and know that they\u2019ll be happy for him.<br></p><p> Because that\u2019s what true friendship is - being happy and supportive of your friends, even when their paths take them away from you.<br></p>",

in <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i>.\u00a0 Unlike the other stones that were introduced as dangerous tools which could easily be shaped into weapons in the wrong hands, the Soul Stone was unique in the way the film left its functional role and potential decidedly unclear.\u00a0 Once you drop what or whoever it is that you love the most down the Red Skull\u2019s cliff on Vormir, the Soul Stone\u2019s yours, and&hellip; that\u2019s seemingly it.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-secrets-we-learned-from-the-avengers-infinity-war-1827975532\">the <i>Infinity War</i> directors\u2019 commentary</a>, the Russo Brothers explain how, even though the film doesn\u2019t explicitly state it, the MCU\u2019s Soul Stone has some of the abilities its comics counterpart is known for, like conjuring the \u201cspiritual representations\u201d of the dead on another plane of existence.\u00a0 In the time between <i>Infinity War</i> and <i>Endgame</i>, the Russos <a href=\"http://collider.com/infinity-war-soul-stone-red-skull-explained/\">further elaborated on the Soul Stone\u2019s powers</a> by explaining how Thanos actually wields it briefly after using the Power Stone during his fight against Doctor Strange:</p><blockquote><p>The Soul Stone obviously has the ability to manipulate your soul, the essence of who you are.\u00a0 One key moment where it\u2019s used is where Doctor Strange turns into multiple Stranges and then Thanos uses the Soul Stone to eradicate all the fake Stranges and momentarily shoves Strange out of his own body, and Strange has to pull himself back in.</p></blockquote><p>But as a plot device within <i>Infinity War</i> specifically, the Soul Stone was always meant to be the centerpiece of Thanos\u2019 personal story of great loss on his path to annihilating the universe.\u00a0 <i>Infinity War</i> was Thanos\u2019 movie, and at the moment when Thanos is forced to reckon with his willingness to kill the person he\u2019s always loved most, the Soul Stone embodies all of the heartbreak and pain that would befall anyone foolish enough to hunt for the gems.</p><p>That framing of the Soul Stone worked to better characterize Thanos as a person, but it still left a rather large number of questions about the stone itself, and what (if any) role it would play in <i>Endgame</i>.\u00a0 Given the stone\u2019s connections to the dead, it made sense that it might factor into how the universe\u2019s disappeared population might return to the land of the living, or perhaps provide a way for the <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/a-guide-to-marvels-death-who-is-so-much-more-than-than-1834282060?_ga=2.188802924.690457902.1557698034-2006100553.1554327702\">MCU take on Lady Death</a> to make her grand debut.</p><p>Whatever logical weirdness might have been associated with the Soul Stone \u2014 a fully-realized realm of the dead, zombies, Force ghosts, who knows \u2014 would have felt appropriate for <i>Endgame</i>\u2019s life or death stakes.\u00a0 That\u2019s what makes it so surprising and somewhat disappointing that ultimately, the orange rock didn\u2019t end up doing all that much in the movie, aside from giving Black Widow a reason to <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/avengers-endgames-women-deserved-more-1834388344?_ga=2.188802924.690457902.1557698034-2006100553.1554327702\">plummet to her fridging</a>.\u00a0 Like many of <i>Endgame</i>\u2019s other scenes set in the past, Black Widow and Hawkeye\u2019s journey to Vormir is meant to be a nod to a pivotal MCU moment leading up to Thanos\u2019 big Snap.</p><p>But rather than revealing anything new and fascinating about the world \u2014 the way Tony Stark\u2019s time in the past with his father did, or Thor\u2019s moment with his mother \u2014 the only thing we glean from the return to Vormir is that it\u2019s awfully lucky that people keep bringing their loved ones there with them.\u00a0 What happens if you travel all the way to Vormir and leave your beloved somewhere else?\u00a0 What if the thing you love most isn\u2019t a person or something that has a physical form?</p><p>When Thanos sees young Gamora again within the stone after his snap, she seems to be aware of just what her father\u2019s done, implying that the stone itself is aware of what\u2019s going on around it.\u00a0 But even that feels like small potatoes in terms of what the Soul Stone can do \u2014 compared to, say, the Reality Stone, which Thanos used to literally turn people into flesh ribbons.</p><p>The Soul Stone being the most conceptually complicated Infinity Stone is a nifty variable to work into the mix of things.\u00a0 But because so much of its true nature is only defined in vague subtext, there\u2019s a way that it ends up also feeling like the least interesting of the stones, because the most important thing it does is exist.\u00a0 Comparing the Soul Stone to Mati\u2019s Heart Ring from <i>Captain Planet</i> almost feels appropriate until you consider that on more than one occasion, Mati demonstrated a number of active psionic powers.</p><p>But now that Thanos has been defeated and the Infinity Stones returned to their rightful places in the past, it feels as if the Soul Stone\u2019s never going to have a chance to be handled like the same kind of MacGuffin its siblings were.\u00a0 That is, unless, it ends up being part of <a
