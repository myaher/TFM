Common vegetables, greens, berries, nuts, extra virgin olive oil, brown rice, chicken, fish, etc are pretty much just as nutritious and often <i>more </i>nutritious than the hip, trendy foods popping up on store shelves. The ingredients we are already familiar with will provide us a balanced and complete diet. Superfoods are usually called so because they are rare, so it must be good, right? Not often. It\u2019s all marketing.<br/><br/><b>2. </b>Gluten-free cookies are still cookies. They\u2019re not health foods. They\u2019re a great treat for someone with dietary restrictions. That\u2019s it. Organic Spaghetti-O\u2019s aren\u2019t better for you. Sugar is still sugar, even if it\u2019s honey or agave. It should be moderated in the same way as common table sugar. Coming out of cardboard packaging with green accents does not make it healthier than its big-brand equivalent. We all like treats time-to-time so there is still a valuable place for these items in the market, but don\u2019t be fooled when they are marketed as \u201chealth food\u201d items. <br/><br/><b>3. </b>Essential oils smell great and <i>some</i>\u00a0have<b> very simple </b>medicinal properties. They can relax you and help you unwind. Peppermint can even take the edge off an upset stomach but many vendors and distributors make grossly overstated and frankly criminal claims about the medical value of their blends. If it sounds too good to be true, it is. They should <b>never</b> be ingested or applied undiluted to the skin. It\u2019s fragrance. Most of us wouldn&rsquo;t drink perfume and those with sensitivities to fragrance still need to be cautious of perfumes and cosmetics with strong fragrance from EOs. They can also be poisonous to pets and children. Essential oils are a good home fragrance and aromatherapy option but they are not inert substances that can be used with reckless abandon. <br/><br/><b>4. </b>To continue. I\u2019ll be first to say that plants are extremely cool and can be beneficial medicines. <b>BUT&ndash;be careful. </b>Many<b>\u00a0</b>plants do have promising health benefits (that need more research FYI) but there are equally outrageous claims out there from the notoriously unregulated supplements industry. Any herbal supplement should be discussed with your doctor and cannot replace your doctor\u2019s medical expertise. Plants are still compounds. There is no such thing as \u201cchemical-free.\u201d <b>Natural is not a synonym for inert.</b> They can interact with prescription medications and negatively affect a medical condition you have. <br/><br/><b>5. </b>Natural and its variants is another meaningless marketing word. Natural is also not a synonym for healthy, just as is not a synonym for inert. It\u2019s cliche but cyanide is natural. Measles is natural. Slapping \u201cnatural\u201d on a package front is unregulated. The item can be just as intensely processed as another item from a well-known brand. Other food isn\u2019t fake.\u00a0<br/><br/><b>6.</b> Anyone selling a wrap, a \u201cfat blocker,\u201d a \u201ccarb inhibitor,\u201d a detox tea, an herbal tincture, or <i>whatever</i> is selling you snake oil or a laxative. No one needs to buy a \u201cproduct\u201d to get healthy and fit.<br/><br/><b>7. </b>Your body already knows how to detox. It\u2019s not dumb. It\u2019s not poorly designed. If you have normal renal and hepatic function, congratulations! &ndash;you\u2019re already on a detox. Drink enough water, eat your vegetables, go for a walk, and take a good shit. That\u2019s it. <b>Any detox product is just an expensive way to starve or have diarrhea. </b><br/><br/><b>8. </b>If it&rsquo;s coming from a package, do your research from the back of the box&ndash;not the front of the box. A food manufacturer can claim there is <b>0g Trans Fat</b> as long as there is less than .5g. Turn the label to the ingredients. If there is \u201cpartially hydrogenated oil,\u201d there is trans fat. A food manufacturer can slap <b>whole grain </b>on the label even if the first ingredient is \u201cenriched bleached flour.\u201d Read the ingredients. Items many of us try to limit intake of are making appearances in strange places.</p><p>Do your homework. Much of what entails food, health, fitness, and supplements are wildly unregulated. For the most part, they can print whatever they want and there is little to stop them from doing so. Be skeptical and examine if it\u2019s really effective, safe, and beneficial to put a substance into your body.</p><p>A lot of headaches can be avoided if you do most of your shopping on the outside aisles, but that doesn\u2019t mean everything on the inside is crap! We all enjoy a branded product or two. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that! But, it never hurts to be an informed consumer. There are good and honest products out there but there is sadly no shortage of companies trying to skim a hard-earned dollar off people making an honest effort to do things a little bit better.\u00a0</p><p>The food industry is a pretty screwed up circus where the brands preying on the anxieties and good questions people have about the origins of their food are often owned by the parent companies making products we call foul on. Continue to be skeptical and ask the same questions of any product, even when it comes in pretty compostable packages. <br/></p>",

This wasn\u2019t a lifestyle I wanted to maintain for the rest of my life. Sure, lowcarb I like, but with the amount of fat and such I was eating, for Keto to really do it\u2019s job, I needed to get into ketosis. And with the amount of times I ended up \u201ccheating\u201d I was never going to be in ketosis long enough for it to matter. And that just isn\u2019t sustainable for me.
