And the more he wants it, the more he panics and pulls back, because if he ever lets himself have it, if he ever lets himself love and be loved by people who aren&rsquo;t irredeemable, it might mean that<i> he&rsquo;s </i>not irredeemable either. And that would undermine his entire worldview.</p>",

href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/15440007\" target=\"_blank\">a ghost in my lungs</a>\u201d and kinda out for blood.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>I should NOT be allowed to write Caleb-centric fic at 2 AM anymore, huh?</i></p><p><b>Mirrors \u2013 Pvris</b></p><p><b>standing up right\nabove me</b></p><p>Caleb does not remember how he got here\u2014<i>here</i>, of all places, a sweet and handsome manor in the foothills,\nthe mountains purple and magnificent above the forest to one side, the last red\nand orange leaves of fall like fire around him. \nIt\u2019s beautiful, picturesque, the very image of a wealthy family\u2019s modest\ncountry retreat.</p><p>The doors, oak carved with a simple arabesque pattern dripping\ndown the frame like ivy, make sickness rise so hard and fast in Caleb\u2019s gut\nthat he digs in his heels without a thought.</p><p>\u201cHit him,\u201d a voice says, bored, and a kick out of nowhere\nsends Caleb crashing to his knees. \u00a0The\ncobbled path hurts, and he only realizes that his hands are chained behind him when\nhe tries to catch himself and instead lands shoulder-first on the stone. \u00a0The gag between his teeth silences his yelp\nof pain, keeps him from biting into his tongue on impact. \u00a0He\u2019s not sure if that\u2019s a blessing or not.</p><p>Lying on the stone, he tries to remember what happened. </p><p>The fight\u2014he remembers the fight, more of a good deed than\nanything else, when word came down of unsavory military recruitment tactics\nhappening in the rural townships south of Rexxentrum. \u00a0They\u2019d spent three days asking questions and\ngetting basically nothing before their usual stupid luck had them blundering\nstraight into trouble.</p><p><i>Real</i> trouble.</p><p>Caleb remembers the wizard, with her two bodyguards and her cold\nblue eyes and her graceful dancer\u2019s step. \nHe remembers the way her voice sounded when she said, \u201cIs that you, my\nfriend?\u201d</p><p>And then he raised his hand, his fingers going black as he\nsummoned the fire that had always served him so loyally, and she said\u2014</p><p>She <i>said</i>\u2014</p><p>His hand burned and she opened her mouth and her throat\nworked and she said\u2014</p><p>His memory goes black there, as swift and clean as if it was\ncut short with a blow of Yasha\u2019s sword. \nAll that remains is the crackle of fire, and the impression of heat on\nhis hands, and the bruises and cuts that he can feel, sprawled here on the stone\npath.</p><p>One has the distinctive feel of frostbite, as if he\u2019d been\nstabbed with a shaft of ice through his right biceps.</p><p><i>Oh gods,</i> Caleb\nthinks, and retches helplessly. \u00a0<i>Jester.</i></p><!-- more --><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a disgrace, Widogast,\u201d the voice says in disgusted\nZemnian.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do to me?\u201d Caleb demands, lunging up\u2014and being\nkicked again, in the ribs this time, to drive him back to the ground. \u00a0\u201cWhat\u2013\u201d</p><p><i>What did I do?</i></p><p>\u201cGet him up,\u201d Astrid orders, and Caleb is dragged ungently\nup to his feet, every muscle screaming in protest. \u00a0He doesn\u2019t fight it as they drag him inside. \u00a0He\u2019s too busy trying to catalogue the other\ninjuries on his body. \u00a0That gash to his\nthigh\u2014could that be from Yasha? \u00a0The\nsplash-burn on his shoulder must be Eldritch Blast, from Fjord, and the aching\nbruise that throbs over his ribs in time to his heartbeat\u2026Beau. \u00a0It has to be.</p><p><i>Please, gods, Archheart,\nif you ever gave a damn, let them be okay.</i> \nCaleb has that gutted, scraped-thin feeling of having burned through a\nlot of magic in a very short time. \u00a0All\nof it, maybe.</p><p>All of it, at\u2014who? \nHis friends?</p><p>His family, again?</p><p>He comes back to himself when he\u2019s more or less pushed down a\nflight of stairs into a familiar dungeon. \nIt\u2019s lit only by magical glowglasses, spaced between the cells down the\ncorridor. \u00a0They cannot account for the\nsmell of smoke.</p><p>\u201cPut him with the quiet one,\u201d Astrid says. \u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re a bit crowded, but don\u2019t worry, your\nroommate is very\u2026cooperative.\u201d \u00a0Then she\nhesitates. \u00a0Astrid, of all people, who\nwas always so sure and confident. \u00a0Who\ntook Caleb\u2019s mind from him with one word\u2014<i>what\nwas the word\u2014</i>and didn\u2019t think twice.</p><p>She walks up and rests a hand on his cheek, using her grip\non his jaw to force him to meet her eyes. \nCaleb learned to do that here, meet eyes. \u00a0If he was going to be the pride of the Empire,\nIkithon always said, Caleb had to look honest and reliable, diplomatic, and he\ncould just have dinner when he could look his teacher in the eye and ask\npolitely.</p><p>Astrid\u2019s eyes are still blue and clear and cold, and she eases\nher grip on Caleb\u2019s face a touch as he stares back at her. \u00a0She strokes his cheek, almost gentle.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Caleb,\u201d she says, still in Zemnian. \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ll be with us again, just as soon as you\u2019re\nbetter. \u00a0It\u2019ll be okay. \u00a0We\u2019re going to make it okay.\u201d</p><p>Caleb is frozen for a long moment, half in terror and half\nin shock. \u00a0He can\u2019t even articulate it\nbecause\u2014because he just wants her to stop <i>touching</i>\nhim, to stop <i>looking </i>at him. \u00a0Whatever she did, to take him away from\nhimself and drag him back here, it left a feeling of bone-deep contamination in\nits wake, as if every small crevice he\u2019s eked out clean of Ikithon\u2019s influence\nhas been dirtied all over again.</p><p>Then he hears Nott\u2019s voice, all the way back when they first\nmet, saying frankly, \u201cEveryone thinks they\u2019re real scary until they\u2019ve got goblin\nteeth in their leg.\u201d</p><p>Astrid runs her thumb over his chapped lower lip, idle and\npossessive, and Caleb opens his mouth and <i>bites</i>\nher as hard as he can.</p><p>It\u2019s worth the beating, to spit her own blood back at her,\nand for a moment all he can think is that Molly would be proud of him.</p><p>\u201cWidogast,\u201d Astrid pants, clutching her freely bleeding hand\nto her chest and looking down at him where he\u2019s all but hanging by the arms\nfrom the grip of her two guards. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve\nbeen waiting to have you back with us for twelve years, but I have to say I\u2019m\nlooking forward to making you pay for running, first. \u00a0Throw him in the cell. \u00a0He\u2019ll live.\u201d</p><p>Being mandhandled into the cell hurts so much that Caleb\ngoes away again, a little bit, in a much more familiar way than before. \u00a0He lands on the ground and drags in three\nslow breaths, just like he was trained to, and then rolls onto his back to take\nstock.</p><p>He\u2019s in rough shape, he decides. \u00a0He\u2019ll live, certainly, but he won\u2019t enjoy it much\nin this state. \u00a0At least one rib is\nbroken. \u00a0He thinks his ankle might be as\nwell, but he\u2019s having some numbness that should probably worry him even more.</p><p>Maybe, he thinks grimly, he could fracture that rib properly\nand punch a hole in his own lung to suffocate quietly through, before she comes\nback.</p><p>Because, of course, he\u2019s going to die here. \u00a0That was a given from the moment he saw the\ndoors again. \u00a0Even if the Nein decided to\ncome after him\u2014and <i>gods</i>, why <i>would</i> they, he\u2019s a monster, a rabid dog\nwho finally turned on them\u2014they would doubtless scout it and conclude that a\nhalf-decent wizard with a cat and homicidal tendencies isn\u2019t worth risking\ntheir necks for.</p><p>That\u2019s assuming they\u2019re all still alive.</p><p>Gods, he wishes he had his cat with him.</p><p>Caleb doesn\u2019t know how long he\u2019s been lying there, when he\nfeels the hand on his shoulder\u2014an exploratory sort of poke, as if seeing if he\u2019s\nbitten the metaphorical big one since rolling over. \u00a0He raises a hand feebly, trying to say <i>not dead yet</i> without trying to actually\nspeak. \u00a0Speaking seems a bit outside his capabilities\nright now.</p><p>His cellmate\u2014the \u2018quiet one\u2019, whatever that meant\u2014clears their\nthroat and says softly, \u201cWa-ter?\u201d</p><p>They sound rough and ragged, like they\u2019ve been silent a long\ntime, and they shape the word like someone learning a completely foreign tongue,\nhitting every consonant too hard and muddling the vowels. \u00a0</p><p>Caleb sits up so fast he feels something in his chest crunch,\nand narrowly misses crashing headfirst into a magnificently curled horn.</p><p>Kneeling over him is a tiefling with skin that shows lavender\nand scarred in the dim light, loose shirt maybe white once. \u00a0The eyes throw the light back, reflecting red\nall around, without a trace of pupil, and the hand being held up as if to warn\nCaleb off has\u2014oh, it has a tattoo, Caleb can see it curl around the wrist, a\nsnake, and on the neck, peacock feathers and a hidden red eye.</p><p>\u201cMollymauk?\u201d Caleb rasps.</p><p>He\u2019s feeling a little hysterical.\u00a0

Astrid orders, and Caleb is dragged ungently\nup to his feet, every muscle screaming in protest. &nbsp;He doesn&rsquo;t fight it as they drag him inside. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s too busy trying to catalogue the other\ninjuries on his body. &nbsp;That gash to his\nthigh&mdash;could that be from Yasha? &nbsp;The\nsplash-burn on his shoulder must be Eldritch Blast, from Fjord, and the aching\nbruise that throbs over his ribs in time to his heartbeat&hellip;Beau. &nbsp;It has to be.</p><p><i>Please, gods, Archheart,\nif you ever gave a damn, let them be okay.</i> \nCaleb has that gutted, scraped-thin feeling of having burned through a\nlot of magic in a very short time. &nbsp;All\nof it, maybe.</p><p>All of it, at&mdash;who? \nHis friends?</p><p>His family, again?</p><p>He comes back to himself when he&rsquo;s more or less pushed down a\nflight of stairs into a familiar dungeon. \nIt&rsquo;s lit only by magical glowglasses, spaced between the cells down the\ncorridor. &nbsp;They cannot account for the\nsmell of smoke.</p><p>&ldquo;Put him with the quiet one,&rdquo; Astrid says. &nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re a bit crowded, but don&rsquo;t worry, your\nroommate is very&hellip;cooperative.&rdquo; &nbsp;Then she\nhesitates. &nbsp;Astrid, of all people, who\nwas always so sure and confident. &nbsp;Who\ntook Caleb&rsquo;s mind from him with one word&mdash;<i>what\nwas the word&mdash;</i>and didn&rsquo;t think twice.</p><p>She walks up and rests a hand on his cheek, using her grip\non his jaw to force him to meet her eyes. \nCaleb learned to do that here, meet eyes. &nbsp;If he was going to be the pride of the Empire,\nIkithon always said, Caleb had to look honest and reliable, diplomatic, and he\ncould just have dinner when he could look his teacher in the eye and ask\npolitely.</p><p>Astrid&rsquo;s eyes are still blue and clear and cold, and she eases\nher grip on Caleb&rsquo;s face a touch as he stares back at her. &nbsp;She strokes his cheek, almost gentle.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Caleb,&rdquo; she says, still in Zemnian. &nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be with us again, just as soon as you&rsquo;re\nbetter. &nbsp;It&rsquo;ll be okay. &nbsp;We&rsquo;re going to make it okay.&rdquo;</p><p>Caleb is frozen for a long moment, half in terror and half\nin shock. &nbsp;He can&rsquo;t even articulate it\nbecause&mdash;because he just wants her to stop <i>touching</i>\nhim, to stop <i>looking </i>at him. &nbsp;Whatever she did, to take him away from\nhimself and drag him back here, it left a feeling of bone-deep contamination in\nits wake, as if every small crevice he&rsquo;s eked out clean of Ikithon&rsquo;s influence\nhas been dirtied all over again.</p><p>Then he hears Nott&rsquo;s voice, all the way back when they first\nmet, saying frankly, &ldquo;Everyone thinks they&rsquo;re real scary until they&rsquo;ve got goblin\nteeth in their leg.&rdquo;</p><p>Astrid runs her thumb over his chapped lower lip, idle and\npossessive, and Caleb opens his mouth and <i>bites</i>\nher as hard as he can.</p><p>It&rsquo;s worth the beating, to spit her own blood back at her,\nand for a moment all he can think is that Molly would be proud of him.</p><p>&ldquo;Widogast,&rdquo; Astrid pants, clutching her freely bleeding hand\nto her chest and looking down at him where he&rsquo;s all but hanging by the arms\nfrom the grip of her two guards. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve\nbeen waiting to have you back with us for twelve years, but I have to say I&rsquo;m\nlooking forward to making you pay for running, first. &nbsp;Throw him in the cell. &nbsp;He&rsquo;ll live.&rdquo;</p><p>Being mandhandled into the cell hurts so much that Caleb\ngoes away again, a little bit, in a much more familiar way than before. &nbsp;He lands on the ground and drags in three\nslow breaths, just like he was trained to, and then rolls onto his back to take\nstock.</p><p>He&rsquo;s in rough shape, he decides. &nbsp;He&rsquo;ll live, certainly, but he won&rsquo;t enjoy it much\nin this state. &nbsp;At least one rib is\nbroken. &nbsp;He thinks his ankle might be as\nwell, but he&rsquo;s having some numbness that should probably worry him even more.</p><p>Maybe, he thinks grimly, he could fracture that rib properly\nand punch a hole in his own lung to suffocate quietly through, before she comes\nback.</p><p>Because, of course, he&rsquo;s going to die here. &nbsp;That was a given from the moment he saw the\ndoors again. &nbsp;Even if the Nein decided to\ncome after him&mdash;and <i>gods</i>, why <i>would</i> they, he&rsquo;s a monster, a rabid dog\nwho finally turned on them&mdash;they would doubtless scout it and conclude that a\nhalf-decent wizard with a cat and homicidal tendencies isn&rsquo;t worth risking\ntheir necks for.</p><p>That&rsquo;s assuming they&rsquo;re all still alive.</p><p>Gods, he wishes he had his cat with him.</p><p>Caleb doesn&rsquo;t know how long he&rsquo;s been lying there, when he\nfeels the hand on his shoulder&mdash;an exploratory sort of poke, as if seeing if he&rsquo;s\nbitten the metaphorical big one since rolling over. &nbsp;He raises a hand feebly, trying to say <i>not dead yet</i> without trying to actually\nspeak. &nbsp;Speaking seems a bit outside his capabilities\nright now.</p><p>His cellmate&mdash;the &lsquo;quiet one&rsquo;, whatever that meant&mdash;clears their\nthroat and says softly, &ldquo;Wa-ter?&rdquo;</p><p>They sound rough and ragged, like they&rsquo;ve been silent a long\ntime, and they shape the word like someone learning a completely foreign tongue,\nhitting every consonant too hard and muddling the vowels. &nbsp;</p><p>Caleb sits up so fast he feels something in his chest crunch,\nand narrowly misses crashing headfirst into a magnificently curled horn.</p><p>Kneeling over him is a tiefling with skin that shows lavender\nand scarred in the dim light, loose shirt maybe white once. &nbsp;The eyes throw the light back, reflecting red\nall around, without a trace of pupil, and the hand being held up as if to warn\nCaleb off has&mdash;oh, it has a tattoo, Caleb can see it curl around the wrist, a\nsnake, and on the neck, peacock feathers and a hidden red eye.</p><p>&ldquo;Mollymauk?&rdquo;

They&rsquo;d get nervous fighting big things but it was fear and excitement they seemed to feel not dread and panic.  I don&rsquo;t know why, maybe it&rsquo;s because they lost molly and when the risk to lose another character frightens them.
