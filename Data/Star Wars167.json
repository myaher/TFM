You\u2019ve been working on it for so long and thinking about it for so long. That\u2019s one of the many reasons I try not to watch anything. To really absorb it, I feel like you\u2019ve got to watch it a lot to think that it\u2019s not you there doing it. To look at the story and not just all the mistakes you made. But I was very numb. It was a lot to take in.Then, I saw it again at the premiere. I had never sat in the audience of a premiere of a movie I was in before. Something like that, because I knew what was coming up, the Han scene, I was very sick to my stomach, very pale, cold, waiting for it just to be over. Then, the response was so nice. It was a very memorable, crazy night.",

                "content": "<p>Blinking\nconfusedly up at the smiling blond over him, Ben let the words rumble\naround in his head for a few moments before putting on his most\ncharming smile. &ldquo;I apologize but I thought the sun god himself had\ndecided to grace me with their presence with how golden you are.&rdquo;\nHe grinned roguishly up at the other.</p><p>Clearly\ntaken off guard for a moment the man who must be Anakin stared at him\nbefore laughing and helping Ben sit up with careful hands that\nlingered on his shoulders and Ben found that he wasn&rsquo;t adverse to\nthe touch, no indeed this young Adonis\nattention was quite flattering if he had to say such a thing.</p><p>And\nthen he realized he had fainted and flushed darkly, the color\nclashing horribly with his red hair as he peered at the other three\nwith an apologetic smile on his face. &ldquo;I am so sorry, I didn&rsquo;t\nmean t-&rdquo;</p><p>Yan\ncut in, his tone sharp but Ben felt that it was milder than earlier.\n&ldquo;Nonsense\nyoung man, you haven nothing to apologize for. I imagine its been a\nlong day for you and we&rsquo;re keeping you awake. I&rsquo;m sure you have\nsomeone waiting for you.&rdquo; He reached for his cup.</p><p>Once\nmore coloring even deeper and burning a bit in humiliation, Ben\nshrugged a bit before deciding on a verbal answer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to\nsay that there is no one waiting for me. I live alone and&hellip; well if\nI have family I wouldn&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; He admitted to them.</p><p>He\nfelt comfortable in admitting such at deeply rooted thing to these\npeople he had just meet, these strangers and yet Ben couldn&rsquo;t help\nbut share with them.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh?\nYou don&rsquo;t know?&rdquo; Qui-Gon questioned with a small frown, pouring a\nglass of water that he offered to Ben.</p><p>Taking\nthe glass while contemplating what to say, Ben decided that honesty\nwouldn&rsquo;t be amiss and for some reason he felt compelled to answer.\n&ldquo;I have memory loss you see,&rdquo; Ben informed then with\na small shrug, smiling sadly as he took a small sip of water to wet\nhis throat. &ldquo;I was found five years ago in a ditch and&hellip; well I\nhaven&rsquo;t remembered anything since then and instead just built a\nlife from scratch with what little I had.&rdquo; He laughed awkwardly,\nrubbing the back of his neck with a cup warmed hand as he sat his cup\ndown on the coffee table as all those pairs of blue eyes observed\nhim, all of them different in shade but all of them beautiful in\ntheir own way.</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;Oh you poor\nthing!&rdquo; Jocasta was on her feet, throwing her arms around Ben in a\nwarm hug with Anakin quickly snatching the glass out of his hand\nbefore Jocasta could make it spill and normally Ben had a tendency to\nflinch away from strangers but once more he felt like this had\nhappened before.</p><p>He felt warm&hellip; and\nsafe.</p><p>He wanted to lean\ninto the hug and not escape it like he normally wished to.</p><p>&lsquo;How\nstrange, I feel safe here&hellip;&rsquo; Ben swallowed heavily, tears pressing\nup in his eyes before he managed\nto get them under control and give Jocasta a misty smile when she\npulled back. &ldquo;Thank you, I&rsquo;m alright, honestly.&rdquo; He murmured\nand took the water\nfrom Anakin again to sip and cover his flustered expression.</p><p>He\nmissed the fond expressions over his head and the craving in Anakin&rsquo;s\nto just wrap his arms around him and never let go. \n</p><p>&ldquo;To\nbe honest it is late and I should go home, I do have an early morning\ntomorrow teaching a class,&rdquo; He noted, glancing at a round metal\nclock hanging on the wall before settling the glass down and standing\nup, giving them all a polite smile and a little bow. &ldquo;Thank you for\nhaving me over.&rdquo;</p><p>Jocasta\ninstantly bounced to take his arm, sliding it into the crook of her\narm as she escorted him to the door. &ldquo;Of course! Please do come\nagain, we would love your company any time Ben, as polite as you are\nyou simply must come over. Perhaps tuesday, for dinner?&rdquo; She\nchatted away.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah,\nwell&hellip;&rdquo; Ben blinked before smiling, giving in to her warm\ngrandmotherly smile. &ldquo;Well, that does sound nice.
