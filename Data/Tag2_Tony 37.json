Typically he would portal to the hall outside, knock on the door and wait to be let in, he does understand boundaries after all, but Pepper had sounded worried enough that he is willing to risk impoliteness to make sure Tony is alright.<br/></p><p>The lab is as astonishingly interesting as always, holograms hanging in the air all around the space, a dozen, two dozen, different projects all open and on the go at once. A smell of electricity and motor oil in the air, a half dozen machines in various stages of build scattered over different workbenches. The music, for once, is actually low, average person levels, and it\u2019s this that gives him pause as the portal whirs to a close behind him. \u201cTony?\u201d </p><p>Dum-E makes a whirring noise from his charging station, U lifting his arm-cam to look over his brother\u2019s \u2018head\u2019. They stay where they are, though. Stephen stands in the middle of the space, turning slowly in an effort to see where Tony could possibly - ah. Not good.</p><p>He hastily places the bags of cheese burgers and tray of coffee on the nearest clear worktop and moves to the far corner of the room where Tony - beautiful, marvelous, infuriating, hurting Tony - is curled into himself, back pressed hard against the wall, shoulders hunched and arms over his head, knees drawn up tight. Pressed himself into the smallest space he can, as if it will protect him from his own brain. </p><p>Stephen can hear his panicked breathing, muffled as it is by arms and knees, as he drops to his own just within reach, one hand lifted as if to touch. But he doesn\u2019t. He knows better.</p><p>\u201cStark?\u201d He waits a beat, \u201cTony?\u201d </p><p>Tony takes a deep breath, suddenly, and lifts his head. His eyes are red rimmed, wet and wide, panicked. Stephen has no idea what triggered it, but he\u2019s clearly coming down from a panic attack. </p><p>\u201cFuck\u2026 Strange? Why\u2026\u201d his voice is rough, raspy, like he\u2019s screamed somewhere in the last hour. A bad one, then. </p><p>Stephen smiles a little, keeps his voice low; \u201cLunch. Pepper\u2019s been worried, so I thought I\u2019d come down with some cheeseburgers for you.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s features scrunch a little. He drops his hands over his face - they tremble and twitch, almost as badly as Stephen\u2019s - and rubs vigorously, before dropping over his knees. His wrists look pale and delicate in the harsh light of the lab. \u201cI\u2026 could eat. Maybe. Cheese burgers?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He\u2019d gone immediately to cheese burgers when Pepper had contacted him, part intuition, part knowing Tony as well as he does at this point, part remembering his first press conference upon returning to the State\u2019s after Afghanistan. \u201cI thought you\u2019d appreciate a real American burger.\u201d </p><p>Tony snorts and Stephen pretends not to watch as he wipes at his eyes. His breathing is still a bit hard, but it\u2019s not as panicked and he takes that as a good sign. He doesn\u2019t move, though, perfectly content to wait for Tony, to let him decide when he\u2019s ready to get up. And, eventually, he does. </p><p>They\u2019re neither of them exactly young anymore, so regaining their feet after sitting on the floor comes with a forced chuckle of embarrassment as knees click and legs tingle as blood rushes back. He keeps his distance as they make their way to the workbench he had dropped lunch on, but Tony is still trembling a little, so he keeps a weather eye on him in case he stumbles. </p><p>Stephen pulls the bag open as Tony tugs a stool closer and slides onto it, his movements jerky and still a little uncoordinated. He tries not to stare as the mechanic drops his face into his hands again, elbows on the worktop as he releases a world weary sigh. He looks\u2026 defeated. His shoulders droop, his hands tremble, his skin is still pallid, almost clammy, he doesn\u2019t even move as Stephen places the food before him. He does move when he places the coffee within reach, however, one hand coming out to grasp the recyclable cup. </p><p>\u201cShit-\u201d Tony fumbles the grip and it is only Stephen\u2019s quick reflexes that saves the drink from spilling across the entire workbench. For a moment, they stay there, with Stephen\u2019s hand wrapped around Tony\u2019s wrapped around the cup and he just holds, gentle yet firm. His own hand is trembling, pretty much a given since the accident, but for all that his wasted fingers shake, they are still strong enough for this. <br/><br/>\u201c&hellip;thanks.\u201d Tony finally breathes, and Stephen carefully lets go. </p>",

Not good.</p><p>He hastily places the bags of cheese burgers and tray of coffee on the nearest clear worktop and moves to the far corner of the room where Tony - beautiful, marvelous, infuriating, hurting Tony - is curled into himself, back pressed hard against the wall, shoulders hunched and arms over his head, knees drawn up tight. Pressed himself into the smallest space he can, as if it will protect him from his own brain. </p><p>Stephen can hear his panicked breathing, muffled as it is by arms and knees, as he drops to his own just within reach, one hand lifted as if to touch. But he doesn\u2019t. He knows better.</p><p>\u201cStark?\u201d He waits a beat, \u201cTony?\u201d </p><p>Tony takes a deep breath, suddenly, and lifts his head. His eyes are red rimmed, wet and wide, panicked. Stephen has no idea what triggered it, but he\u2019s clearly coming down from a panic attack. </p><p>\u201cFuck\u2026 Strange? Why\u2026\u201d his voice is rough, raspy, like he\u2019s screamed somewhere in the last hour. A bad one, then. </p><p>Stephen smiles a little, keeps his voice low; \u201cLunch. Pepper\u2019s been worried, so I thought I\u2019d come down with some cheeseburgers for you.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s features scrunch a little. He drops his hands over his face - they tremble and twitch, almost as badly as Stephen\u2019s - and rubs vigorously, before dropping over his knees. His wrists look pale and delicate in the harsh light of the lab. \u201cI\u2026 could eat. Maybe. Cheese burgers?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He\u2019d gone immediately to cheese burgers when Pepper had contacted him, part intuition, part knowing Tony as well as he does at this point, part remembering his first press conference upon returning to the State\u2019s after Afghanistan. \u201cI thought you\u2019d appreciate a real American burger.\u201d </p><p>Tony snorts and Stephen pretends not to watch as he wipes at his eyes. His breathing is still a bit hard, but it\u2019s not as panicked and he takes that as a good sign. He doesn\u2019t move, though, perfectly content to wait for Tony, to let him decide when he\u2019s ready to get up. And, eventually, he does. </p><p>They\u2019re neither of them exactly young anymore, so regaining their feet after sitting on the floor comes with a forced chuckle of embarrassment as knees click and legs tingle as blood rushes back. He keeps his distance as they make their way to the workbench he had dropped lunch on, but Tony is still trembling a little, so he keeps a weather eye on him in case he stumbles. </p><p>Stephen pulls the bag open as Tony tugs a stool closer and slides onto it, his movements jerky and still a little uncoordinated. He tries not to stare as the mechanic drops his face into his hands again, elbows on the worktop as he releases a world weary sigh. He looks\u2026 defeated. His shoulders droop, his hands tremble, his skin is still pallid, almost clammy, he doesn\u2019t even move as Stephen places the food before him. He does move when he places the coffee within reach, however, one hand coming out to grasp the recyclable cup. </p><p>\u201cShit-\u201d Tony fumbles the grip and it is only Stephen\u2019s quick reflexes that saves the drink from spilling across the entire workbench. For a moment, they stay there, with Stephen\u2019s hand wrapped around Tony\u2019s wrapped around the cup and he just holds, gentle yet firm. His own hand is trembling, pretty much a given since the accident, but for all that his wasted fingers shake, they are still strong enough for this. <br><br>\u201c\u2026thanks.\u201d Tony finally breathes, and Stephen carefully lets go. </p>",

It made you whimper, you wanted more\u2026 so much more\u2026\u00a0</i><i>\u201cTony\u2026 Tony please. I need more.\u00a0 I need you all\u2026 \u201d you breathed out, tangling your gingers into his hair, pressing his face closer to your cunt. Sometimes the desire for him hurts. You feel like you can\u2019t have him enough. Moans were escaping your mouth, when you felt his lips and tongue teasing your soft skin down there\u2026\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cOh Tony\u2026\u201d\u00a0</i></p><!-- more --><p>***<br/><br/>\n\u201cMorning (Y/N),\u201d Tony wished you, when you walk into kitchen, to find something for breakfast. Whole team was already there, you knew they are having some big meeting today, about some situation in Pakistan they need to solve.</p><p>\u201cHey everyone,\u201d you smiles, sitting next to Nat, putting some cereals into bowl.</p><p>\u201cDid you sleep well?\u201d Bruce asked and you felt your cheeks gets little red, when you remembered your dream.\u00a0</p><p>\n\u201cYep, all good, thanks.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAny nightmares? Or beautiful dreams?\u201d Tony asked, looking into your eyes curiously.\u00a0It\u2019s bee three months since they saved you from crazy doctor in Russia, who was trying genetic experiments on humans.\u00a0</p><p>Since then you stayed living in their base. You had nowhere to go, your mom was dead and your dad\u2026 well, not a nice history.\u00a0Tony decided you will stay with them, they will help you find out, how to reverse the consequences of doctor Sevastyan experiments.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 nothing, dreamless night. Anyway\u2026 where are you leaving to Pakistan?\u201d You asked, trying to change the subject of the conversation. When they bring you here, you had terrible nightmares about your time in Russia, and Tony was the one, who was usually up all night. Many times, when you weren\u2019t able to sleep, you two were just talking in his lab.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThey are leaving in three hours,\u201d Tony said to you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThey? You not going?\u201d You asked.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWanna get rid of me?\u201d He smirked. \u201cHave tons of thing to do, they should take care of it\u2026 and If they fail, I\u2019ll go to save them,\u201d he laughed. Steve gave him one bad look, but other members of team were already used to his ego.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0***</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI was thinking\u2026 Wanna help me in lab today? I could really use some help.\u201d Tony was leaning against your door, arms crossed on his chest, looking at you reading a book.\u00a0\u201cYep! Why not,\u201d you smiled and stood up. You were wearing only shorts and tank top that you are usually sleeping in.\u00a0\u201cOkay, just come down when you will be ready,\u201d he smiled and walked away. You ran right after him. It was middle of summer so you had no intentions to change your clothes.\u00a0***<br/><br/>\n\u201cTony\u2026 I think I made a mistake in those calculations, can you look at it?\u201d You said, when your attempts to help him figured out to be a total nonsense.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSure, I\u2019ll help you, what would you do with out me? <i>You need me all,</i> don\u2019t you?\u201d He said with a grind on his face. Your whole body frozen. What did he just said?</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d You mumbled, cheeks all red, looking down into paper, trying to avoid eye contact with him.\u00a0We stood behind you, pressing his chest against your back. You felt his hot breath on your neck, when he was looking at to paper over you shoulder.\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cI said, that you need me\u2026 You need me all\u2026\u201d </i>he repeated the sentence, gently wrapping one hand around your waist.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 what?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201c(Y/N)\u2026 tell me\u2026 baby\u2026 how long you are not having nightmares anymore?\u201d He mumbled, and he turned your chair, so he could look into your eyes.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAbout a month maybe\u2026 Those medicaments from Bruce are really helping me and\u2026\u201d\u00a0 he didn\u2019t let you finish.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b>Shhhh, quiet baby, right now I really don\u2019t want to hear others guys name slipping your beautiful mouth.</b> So, yesterday\u2026 I went to check on you, as I am doing every night when you don\u2019t come to my lab. Just want to be sure you are not having any more nightmares and, well\u2026 what were you dreaming about (Y/N)?\u201d\u00a0You felt heat all over you body, you legs were shaking and you were sure you won\u2019t be able to speak properly. He heard. Tony Stark heard you are having dreams about him.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cI\u2026 well, we were\u2026 I was\u2026 hmm, not much really\u2026 I just\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShould I guess?\u201d He interrupted you again, leaning his head lower, his lips was only few millimeters from yours.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI think I touched you here, maybe?\u201d He whispered with a low husky voice and lightly stroked your breast hidden under thin top. You body reacted on him immediately, when he repeated his movement, he felt your nipples getting hard what made his smile even bigger.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAm I right babygirl?\u201d He mumbled, trying to force some kind of verbal reaction from you.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cNo\u2026 not exactly,\u201d you mumbled, what made his grin even bigger.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh\u2026 so\u2026 I was maybe here?\u201d He asked, moving his hands down on your tights opening your legs.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNever in my wildest drams tough what is hidden in my little baby.\u201d\u00a0His fingers found the way under your shorts really quickly, making him moan when he realized you are not wearing any panties.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he swore when he felt wetness between your legs. In one moment he was almost kissing you, and in the most second he lost his control and felt on his knees facing your wet pussy.\u00a0When you felt his fingers opening you for his tongue, you almost cried.\u00a0</p><p>You needed him so badly, that it was almost hurtful. You spend last few months hiding your attraction to this man, and now he was there, giving you everything you ever dreamed of.\u00a0He pushed one finger inside you add started to pump, while his tongue was still exploring your clitoris, making you moan his name again and again.\u00a0</p><p>You collapsed on table full of papers, not able to hold your body up anymore.

It took only few more moments when you reached your edge and curled your body ins strong orgasm Tony just gave you. You were enjoying every second of it, still feeling Tony\u2019s hands exploring your body.\u00a0After few minutes you opened your eyes.

Moans were escaping your mouth, when you felt his lips and tongue teasing your soft skin down there&hellip;&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Oh Tony&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;</i></p><p>***<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Morning (Y/N),&rdquo; Tony wished you, when you walk into kitchen, to find something for breakfast. Whole team was already there, you knew they are having some big meeting today, about some situation in Pakistan they need to solve.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey everyone,&rdquo; you smiles, sitting next to Nat, putting some cereals into bowl.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you sleep well?&rdquo; Bruce asked and you felt your cheeks gets little red, when you remembered your dream.&nbsp;</p><p>\n&ldquo;Yep, all good, thanks.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Any nightmares? Or beautiful dreams?&rdquo; Tony asked, looking into your eyes curiously.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s bee three months since they saved you from crazy doctor in Russia, who was trying genetic experiments on humans.&nbsp;</p><p>Since then you stayed living in their base. You had nowhere to go, your mom was dead and your dad&hellip; well, not a nice history.&nbsp;Tony decided you will stay with them, they will help you find out, how to reverse the consequences of doctor Sevastyan experiments.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip; nothing, dreamless night. Anyway&hellip; where are you leaving to Pakistan?&rdquo; You asked, trying to change the subject of the conversation. When they bring you here, you had terrible nightmares about your time in Russia, and Tony was the one, who was usually up all night. Many times, when you weren&rsquo;t able to sleep, you two were just talking in his lab.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;They are leaving in three hours,&rdquo; Tony said to you.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;They? You not going?&rdquo; You asked.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Wanna get rid of me?&rdquo; He smirked. &ldquo;Have tons of thing to do, they should take care of it&hellip; and If they fail, I&rsquo;ll go to save them,&rdquo; he laughed. Steve gave him one bad look, but other members of team were already used to his ego.</p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;***</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I was thinking&hellip; Wanna help me in lab today? I could really use some help.&rdquo; Tony was leaning against your door, arms crossed on his chest, looking at you reading a book.&nbsp;&ldquo;Yep! Why not,&rdquo; you smiled and stood up. You were wearing only shorts and tank top that you are usually sleeping in.&nbsp;&ldquo;Okay, just come down when you will be ready,&rdquo; he smiled and walked away. You ran right after him. It was middle of summer so you had no intentions to change your clothes.&nbsp;***<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Tony&hellip; I think I made a mistake in those calculations, can you look at it?&rdquo; You said, when your attempts to help him figured out to be a total nonsense.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure, I&rsquo;ll help you, what would you do with out me? <i>You need me all,</i> don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; He said with a grind on his face. Your whole body frozen. What did he just said?</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; You mumbled, cheeks all red, looking down into paper, trying to avoid eye contact with him.&nbsp;We stood behind you, pressing his chest against your back. You felt his hot breath on your neck, when he was looking at to paper over you shoulder.&nbsp;</p><p><i>&ldquo;I said, that you need me&hellip; You need me all&hellip;&rdquo; </i>he repeated the sentence, gently wrapping one hand around your waist.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip; what?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;(Y/N)&hellip; tell me&hellip; baby&hellip; how long you are not having nightmares anymore?&rdquo; He mumbled, and he turned your chair, so he could look into your eyes.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;About a month maybe&hellip; Those medicaments from Bruce are really helping me and&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp; he didn&rsquo;t let you finish.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;<b>Shhhh, quiet baby, right now I really don&rsquo;t want to hear others guys name slipping your beautiful mouth.</b> So, yesterday&hellip; I went to check on you, as I am doing every night when you don&rsquo;t come to my lab. Just want to be sure you are not having any more nightmares and, well&hellip; what were you dreaming about (Y/N)?&rdquo;&nbsp;You felt heat all over you body, you legs were shaking and you were sure you won&rsquo;t be able to speak properly. He heard. Tony Stark heard you are having dreams about him.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I&hellip; well, we were&hellip; I was&hellip; hmm, not much really&hellip; I just&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Should I guess?&rdquo; He interrupted you again, leaning his head lower, his lips was only few millimeters from yours.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I think I touched you here, maybe?&rdquo; He whispered with a low husky voice and lightly stroked your breast hidden under thin top. You body reacted on him immediately, when he repeated his movement, he felt your nipples getting hard what made his smile even bigger.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Am I right babygirl?&rdquo; He mumbled, trying to force some kind of verbal reaction from you.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;No&hellip; not exactly,&rdquo; you mumbled, what made his grin even bigger.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh&hellip; so&hellip; I was maybe here?&rdquo; He asked, moving his hands down on your tights opening your legs.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Never in my wildest drams tough what is hidden in my little baby.&rdquo;&nbsp;His fingers found the way under your shorts really quickly, making him moan when he realized you are not wearing any panties.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck,&rdquo; he swore when he felt wetness between your legs. In one moment he was almost kissing you, and in the most second he lost his control and felt on his knees facing your wet pussy.&nbsp;When you felt his fingers opening you for his tongue, you almost cried.&nbsp;</p><p>You needed him so badly, that it was almost hurtful. You spend last few months hiding your attraction to this man, and now he was there, giving you everything you ever dreamed of.&nbsp;He pushed one finger inside you add started to pump, while his tongue was still exploring your clitoris, making you moan his name again and again.&nbsp;</p><p>You collapsed on table full of papers, not able to hold your body up anymore.

        "body": "<h1>The True Fury Of A Mama Bear</h1><p>It was an itch he couldn&rsquo;t scratch.</p><p>His spider senses had been going off all week and it was making him restless. He taps his pen against his desk and his leg bounces as he constantly looks up from his notes and around the classroom in a paranoid frenzy. He had to calm down. It could be something as stupid as paparazzi. Except being adopted by Tony Stark&ndash;and of course Doctor Strange&ndash;after Aunt May&rsquo;s passing was old news, and they never made him this on edge.</p><p>Ned leans over when the teacher turns their back and whispers, &ldquo;Dude. What&rsquo;s wrong with you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;I feel like I&rsquo;m being watched.&rdquo;</p><p>They duck their heads when the teacher turns back to the class and the conversation is put on hold until after class when the two meet at Peter&rsquo;s locker.</p><p>&ldquo;Have you told Mr.Stark?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in Europe until Sunday.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh right. What about Dr. Strange?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter winces as he closes his locker. &ldquo;If I do that, I&rsquo;m convinced he&rsquo;ll wrap me in bubble wrap and lock me in my room.&rdquo;</p><p>Ned coughs to hide a laugh. &ldquo;How long have you been feeling like this?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;since Dad left?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A few days?! Not a few hours?! Peter you need to tell someone!&rdquo; His best friend gives him a worried look and Peter waves him off.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably nothing. Flash has set it off before.&rdquo;</p><p>Ned looks at him skeptically but nods and they part ways after their handshake. As he leaves through the doors, Peter puts his earphones in and starts his walk to the subway. Happy usually picked him up after school, but he had taken the day off and he wasn&rsquo;t about to let Stephen portal him home. That would just draw more attention to him that he didn&rsquo;t want, especially since the news of his adoption was finally starting to lose its appeal.</p><p>Pepper was doing a great job of keeping the media away. Sure, they got a little too brave one time and were waiting outside the school, so the teen had to wait inside until Happy and Tony cleared a path. One journalist got too brave and too close to Peter and was quickly corrected by Tony&rsquo;s fist.</p><p>Both Pepper and Stephen weren&rsquo;t very happy about that little stunt. The sorcerer was quicker to forgive though.</p><p>Halfway to the subway, Peter freezes when his senses dial up to eleven and he looks behind him when the feeling of being watched screams at him. He saw nothing out of the ordinary.</p><p>He turns to continue his trek to the subway when he suddenly feels a sudden jab in his neck, and a bag was thrown over his head. Oblivion took him before he could even think to fight back.</p><p>Or press his panic button.</p><p>___________________</p><p>Stephen frowns and checks his phone. Peter wasn&rsquo;t home yet and he didn&rsquo;t get any kind of message from him to inform the sorcerer of any last minute plans. No going home with Ned, no Decathlon meeting, no after school patrol&hellip;hell, no detention. An hour was too long for him to pick up a sandwich from Mr. Delmar as well.</p><p>&ldquo;FRIDAY, where&rsquo;s Peter?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;According to the tracker in his watch, he is approximately two blocks from the subway. He hasn&rsquo;t moved for 28 minutes.&rdquo;</p><p>That wasn&rsquo;t worrying at all.</p><p>&ldquo;Call him.&rdquo;</p><p>A few moments pass. &ldquo;No answer Doctor.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Should I notify the boss?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. Not yet. Check surveillance feed for Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>In the meantime, he hoped he would be able to find a strand of Peter&rsquo;s hair. It was likely the only chance he had of finding the teen if FRIDAY didn&rsquo;t find anything on cameras.</p><p>___________________</p><p>Peter woke feeling sluggish. Once he was aware enough and took in his surroundings, he realized he was chained to a chair bolted to the floor. He could easily break the chains, but whatever he was drugged with left him so weak he could barely hold his head up. So he took in whatever surroundings he could. Not that there was anything to see, he seemed to be in the basement of a large building and it was freezing. He wasn&rsquo;t sure if the temperature was intentional or not.</p><p>The door across from him swings open and slams against the wall, causing Peter to grimace from the noise. His hearing was still dialed to eleven and the rebounding door only added to the pounding headache he had. One of his captors probably hit him over the head for good measure. Bastards.</p><p>&ldquo;So Baby Stark is awake. I&rsquo;m kind of surprised. I thought you&rsquo;d be out for a couple more hours.&rdquo; A man strolls in with two others who stay by the door.</p><p>&ldquo;What can I say? I&rsquo;m an overachiever.&rdquo; Peter responds dryly.</p><p>That was apparently the wrong thing to say because his head suddenly snapped to the side when the man&rsquo;s fist connects with the opposite cheek. If the teen had a headache before, it was a full blown migraine now.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to do that kid. We just want some of Daddy&rsquo;s money.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter glares up at him. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s out of town.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh we know kid. Now he can&rsquo;t come rescue you. He'll\u00a0have to\u00a0pay for your safe return.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter bites his lip to hide a smile. They had no idea about Stephen and were probably too stupid to think about the rest of the Avengers. Doctor Strange was scary enough. He no doubt knew Peter was missing by now and was likely scrambling to find a strand of his hair, and having FRIDAY track him. He noticed the absence of his watch shortly after waking so he was hoping his kidnappers would make the mistake of sending a picture or video feed to Tony. That would be all the sorcerer supreme would need.</p><p>Sure enough, one of the guy&rsquo;s lackies pulls out his phone and holds it up in the teen&rsquo;s direction after dialing.</p><p>&ldquo;Stark.&rdquo; Tony answers after a few rings.</p><p>The lead man takes the phone and moves it closer to Peter. &ldquo;Mr. Stark. I have something of yours.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter looks up at the small screen with a bored expression and finds an annoyed one on Tony&rsquo;s face. Annoyance he knew was not directed at him but rather the morons who were actually moronic enough to kidnap his son. The genius takes in his son&rsquo;s physical health before sighing heavily.</p><p>&ldquo;Real fucking original. You okay kid?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just waiting for you to forward the picture to Mom.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Already done. Sit tight.&rdquo;</p><p>The man holding the phone looks back at his lackies with confusion and it filled Peter with glee. Mama Bear was coming and they had no idea what they were in for.</p><p>&ldquo;I thought you said Stark wasn&rsquo;t married!&rdquo;</p><p>One of the lackies cowers under his bosses glare. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not!&rdquo;</p><p>As if on cue, gold sparks flicker in the room before forming into a circle and Peter&rsquo;s captors take a bewildered step back. Stephen steps through with fire in his eyes and without a single word, conjures his whip. He didn&rsquo;t even leave enough time for the trio to process what was happening, and swiftly knocks down the two at the door. With his free hand, he blocks a punch from the leader with a magic shield, whispers to his cloak, and Levi wraps itself around the kidnapper&rsquo;s head.</p><p>&ldquo;Surprise asshole.&rdquo;</p><p>He goes down with a loud thud and Stephen takes the phone out of his hand. Tony chuckles\u00a0 from the other end. &ldquo;Finished already?&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen scowls. &ldquo;Not quite.&rdquo; He breaks the chains around Peter with his magic and hands the phone to the teen. &ldquo;Talk to your father until I&rsquo;m done.&rdquo;</p><p>The sorcerer turns his attention back to the three men as they move to their feet and Peter cringes when Stephen knocks them back down with his whip. He presses two fingers on each of the lackies foreheads, putting them to sleep, and grabs the leader by the throat as he looks at Peter.</p><p>&ldquo;Did he do anything?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just punched me.&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen raises an eyebrow and punches the final conscious captor, hiding a wince when his hand protests the action. When the third body falls to the ground, the sorcerer binds them with a rope before sending them through a separate portal that Peter assumed was a police station from the glimpse he got. Levi calmly takes its place on Stephen&rsquo;s shoulders after shivering out the rest of it&rsquo;s fury.</p><p>&ldquo;I think Mom is done.&rdquo; Peter says to Tony.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll notify the police. Let Mama Bear look you over and rest&hellip;and stay in the tower until I get home.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But-&rdquo; Peter starts to protest but both men give him a look. &ldquo;Fine.&rdquo;</p><p>He hands the phone back to Stephen who exchanges a few more words with Tony before hanging up and kneeling in front of Peter. He gently takes Peter&rsquo;s face in trembling hands and studies his injuries before waving a finger back and forth, asking him to follow it.</p><p>&ldquo;I can only see a bruise. Do you have any other pain?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter knew better than to lie to the doctor. He would see right through him anyway. &ldquo;I have a migraine&hellip;and I think I was drugged.&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen nods and helps the teen to his feet. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get you home and in bed. Your metabolism should burn the rest of the drug off in the next couple of hours.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter nods and follows Stephen through the portal back home and he sighs quietly when the doctor gently kneeds the base of his skull. It felt amazing and was doing wonders for his migraine. He wouldn&rsquo;t mind curling up to Stephen and letting him continue his massage instead of taking pain killers.</p><p>The sorcerer chuckles. &ldquo;Whatever you like Spiderling.&rdquo; Peter looks up at him in surprise. &ldquo;You said it out loud. Do you think you can eat something or does your head hurt too much?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Head hurts.&rdquo; Peter mutters.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p><p>Strange leads the boy to his room and lays with him on his bed, allowing the teen to snuggle up to him before massaging his neck again. Peter sighs happily against his collarbone and tense muscles slowly yield to Stephen&rsquo;s ministrations.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks for coming for me&hellip;&rdquo; The boy huffs out a laugh. &ldquo;You were really cool.&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen laughs. &ldquo;Always Spider-Baby.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not a baby.&rdquo; Was Peter&rsquo;s muffled response.</p><p>Before he could tease the boy, he felt more than he heard soft snores come from the body attached to his front.</p><p>&ldquo;Very convincing.&rdquo;</p>",

The sorcerer was quicker to forgive though.</p><p>Halfway to the subway, Peter freezes when his senses dial up to eleven and he looks behind him when the feeling of being watched screams at him. He saw nothing out of the ordinary.</p><p>He turns to continue his trek to the subway when he suddenly feels a sudden jab in his neck, and a bag was thrown over his head. Oblivion took him before he could even think to fight back.</p><p>Or press his panic button.</p><p>___________________</p><p>Stephen frowns and checks his phone. Peter wasn\u2019t home yet and he didn\u2019t get any kind of message from him to inform the sorcerer of any last minute plans. No going home with Ned, no Decathlon meeting, no after school patrol\u2026hell, no detention. An hour was too long for him to pick up a sandwich from Mr. Delmar as well.</p><p>\u201cFRIDAY, where\u2019s Peter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to the tracker in his watch, he is approximately two blocks from the subway. He hasn\u2019t moved for 28 minutes.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t worrying at all.</p><p>\u201cCall him.\u201d</p><p>A few moments pass. \u201cNo answer Doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I notify the boss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not yet. Check surveillance feed for Peter.\u201d</p><p>In the meantime, he hoped he would be able to find a strand of Peter\u2019s hair. It was likely the only chance he had of finding the teen if FRIDAY didn\u2019t find anything on cameras.</p><p>___________________</p><p>Peter woke feeling sluggish. Once he was aware enough and took in his surroundings, he realized he was chained to a chair bolted to the floor. He could easily break the chains, but whatever he was drugged with left him so weak he could barely hold his head up. So he took in whatever surroundings he could. Not that there was anything to see, he seemed to be in the basement of a large building and it was freezing. He wasn\u2019t sure if the temperature was intentional or not.</p><p>The door across from him swings open and slams against the wall, causing Peter to grimace from the noise. His hearing was still dialed to eleven and the rebounding door only added to the pounding headache he had. One of his captors probably hit him over the head for good measure. Bastards.</p><p>\u201cSo Baby Stark is awake. I\u2019m kind of surprised. I thought you\u2019d be out for a couple more hours.\u201d A man strolls in with two others who stay by the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I say? I\u2019m an overachiever.\u201d Peter responds dryly.</p><p>That was apparently the wrong thing to say because his head suddenly snapped to the side when the man\u2019s fist connects with the opposite cheek. If the teen had a headache before, it was a full blown migraine now.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to do that kid. We just want some of Daddy\u2019s money.\u201d</p><p>Peter glares up at him. \u201cHe\u2019s out of town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh we know kid. Now he can\u2019t come rescue you. He'll\u00a0have to\u00a0pay for your safe return.\u201d</p><p>Peter bites his lip to hide a smile. They had no idea about Stephen and were probably too stupid to think about the rest of the Avengers. Doctor Strange was scary enough. He no doubt knew Peter was missing by now and was likely scrambling to find a strand of his hair, and having FRIDAY track him. He noticed the absence of his watch shortly after waking so he was hoping his kidnappers would make the mistake of sending a picture or video feed to Tony. That would be all the sorcerer supreme would need.</p><p>Sure enough, one of the guy\u2019s lackies pulls out his phone and holds it up in the teen\u2019s direction after dialing.</p><p>\u201cStark.\u201d Tony answers after a few rings.</p><p>The lead man takes the phone and moves it closer to Peter. \u201cMr. Stark. I have something of yours.\u201d</p><p>Peter looks up at the small screen with a bored expression and finds an annoyed one on Tony\u2019s face. Annoyance he knew was not directed at him but rather the morons who were actually moronic enough to kidnap his son. The genius takes in his son\u2019s physical health before sighing heavily.</p><p>\u201cReal fucking original. You okay kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust waiting for you to forward the picture to Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready done. Sit tight.\u201d</p><p>The man holding the phone looks back at his lackies with confusion and it filled Peter with glee. Mama Bear was coming and they had no idea what they were in for.</p><p>\u201cI thought you said Stark wasn\u2019t married!\u201d</p><p>One of the lackies cowers under his bosses glare. \u201cHe\u2019s not!\u201d</p><p>As if on cue, gold sparks flicker in the room before forming into a circle and Peter\u2019s captors take a bewildered step back. Stephen steps through with fire in his eyes and without a single word, conjures his whip. He didn\u2019t even leave enough time for the trio to process what was happening, and swiftly knocks down the two at the door. With his free hand, he blocks a punch from the leader with a magic shield, whispers to his cloak, and Levi wraps itself around the kidnapper\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cSurprise asshole.\u201d</p><p>He goes down with a loud thud and Stephen takes the phone out of his hand. Tony chuckles\u00a0 from the other end. \u201cFinished already?\u201d</p><p>Stephen scowls. \u201cNot quite.\u201d He breaks the chains around Peter with his magic and hands the phone to the teen. \u201cTalk to your father until I\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>The sorcerer turns his attention back to the three men as they move to their feet and Peter cringes when Stephen knocks them back down with his whip. He presses two fingers on each of the lackies foreheads, putting them to sleep, and grabs the leader by the throat as he looks at Peter.</p><p>\u201cDid he do anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust punched me.\u201d</p><p>Stephen raises an eyebrow and punches the final conscious captor, hiding a wince when his hand protests the action. When the third body falls to the ground, the sorcerer binds them with a rope before sending them through a separate portal that Peter assumed was a police station from the glimpse he got. Levi calmly takes its place on Stephen\u2019s shoulders after shivering out the rest of it\u2019s fury.</p><p>\u201cI think Mom is done.\u201d Peter says to Tony.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll notify the police. Let Mama Bear look you over and rest\u2026and stay in the tower until I get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut-\u201d Peter starts to protest but both men give him a look. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>He hands the phone back to Stephen who exchanges a few more words with Tony before hanging up and kneeling in front of Peter. He gently takes Peter\u2019s face in trembling hands and studies his injuries before waving a finger back and forth, asking him to follow it.</p><p>\u201cI can only see a bruise. Do you have any other pain?\u201d</p><p>Peter knew better than to lie to the doctor. He would see right through him anyway. \u201cI have a migraine\u2026and I think I was drugged.\u201d</p><p>Stephen nods and helps the teen to his feet. \u201cWe\u2019ll get you home and in bed. Your metabolism should burn the rest of the drug off in the next couple of hours.\u201d</p><p>Peter nods and follows Stephen through the portal back home and he sighs quietly when the doctor gently kneeds the base of his skull. It felt amazing and was doing wonders for his migraine. He wouldn\u2019t mind curling up to Stephen and letting him continue his massage instead of taking pain killers.</p><p>The sorcerer chuckles. \u201cWhatever you like Spiderling.\u201d Peter looks up at him in surprise. \u201cYou said it out loud. Do you think you can eat something or does your head hurt too much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHead hurts.\u201d Peter mutters.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Strange leads the boy to his room and lays with him on his bed, allowing the teen to snuggle up to him before massaging his neck again. Peter sighs happily against his collarbone and tense muscles slowly yield to Stephen\u2019s ministrations.</p><p>\u201cHey\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for coming for me\u2026\u201d The boy huffs out a laugh. \u201cYou were really cool.\u201d</p><p>Stephen laughs. \u201cAlways Spider-Baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a baby.\u201d Was Peter\u2019s muffled response.</p><p>Before he could tease the boy, he felt more than he heard soft snores come from the body attached to his front.</p><p>\u201cVery convincing.\u201d</p></p>",

No going home with Ned, no Decathlon meeting, no after school patrol&hellip;hell, no detention. An hour was too long for him to pick up a sandwich from Mr. Delmar as well.</p><p>&ldquo;FRIDAY, where&rsquo;s Peter?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;According to the tracker in his watch, he is approximately two blocks from the subway. He hasn&rsquo;t moved for 28 minutes.&rdquo;</p><p>That wasn&rsquo;t worrying at all.</p><p>&ldquo;Call him.&rdquo;</p><p>A few moments pass. &ldquo;No answer Doctor.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Should I notify the boss?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. Not yet. Check surveillance feed for Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>In the meantime, he hoped he would be able to find a strand of Peter&rsquo;s hair. It was likely the only chance he had of finding the teen if FRIDAY didn&rsquo;t find anything on cameras.</p><p>___________________</p><p>Peter woke feeling sluggish. Once he was aware enough and took in his surroundings, he realized he was chained to a chair bolted to the floor. He could easily break the chains, but whatever he was drugged with left him so weak he could barely hold his head up. So he took in whatever surroundings he could. Not that there was anything to see, he seemed to be in the basement of a large building and it was freezing. He wasn&rsquo;t sure if the temperature was intentional or not.</p><p>The door across from him swings open and slams against the wall, causing Peter to grimace from the noise. His hearing was still dialed to eleven and the rebounding door only added to the pounding headache he had. One of his captors probably hit him over the head for good measure. Bastards.</p><p>&ldquo;So Baby Stark is awake. I&rsquo;m kind of surprised. I thought you&rsquo;d be out for a couple more hours.&rdquo; A man strolls in with two others who stay by the door.</p><p>&ldquo;What can I say? I&rsquo;m an overachiever.&rdquo; Peter responds dryly.</p><p>That was apparently the wrong thing to say because his head suddenly snapped to the side when the man&rsquo;s fist connects with the opposite cheek. If the teen had a headache before, it was a full blown migraine now.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to do that kid. We just want some of Daddy&rsquo;s money.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter glares up at him. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s out of town.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh we know kid. Now he can&rsquo;t come rescue you. He'll&nbsp;have to&nbsp;pay for your safe return.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter bites his lip to hide a smile. They had no idea about Stephen and were probably too stupid to think about the rest of the Avengers. Doctor Strange was scary enough. He no doubt knew Peter was missing by now and was likely scrambling to find a strand of his hair, and having FRIDAY track him. He noticed the absence of his watch shortly after waking so he was hoping his kidnappers would make the mistake of sending a picture or video feed to Tony. That would be all the sorcerer supreme would need.</p><p>Sure enough, one of the guy&rsquo;s lackies pulls out his phone and holds it up in the teen&rsquo;s direction after dialing.</p><p>&ldquo;Stark.&rdquo; Tony answers after a few rings.</p><p>The lead man takes the phone and moves it closer to Peter. &ldquo;Mr. Stark. I have something of yours.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter looks up at the small screen with a bored expression and finds an annoyed one on Tony&rsquo;s face. Annoyance he knew was not directed at him but rather the morons who were actually moronic enough to kidnap his son. The genius takes in his son&rsquo;s physical health before sighing heavily.</p><p>&ldquo;Real fucking original. You okay kid?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just waiting for you to forward the picture to Mom.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Already done. Sit tight.&rdquo;</p><p>The man holding the phone looks back at his lackies with confusion and it filled Peter with glee. Mama Bear was coming and they had no idea what they were in for.</p><p>&ldquo;I thought you said Stark wasn&rsquo;t married!&rdquo;</p><p>One of the lackies cowers under his bosses glare. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not!&rdquo;</p><p>As if on cue, gold sparks flicker in the room before forming into a circle and Peter&rsquo;s captors take a bewildered step back. Stephen steps through with fire in his eyes and without a single word, conjures his whip. He didn&rsquo;t even leave enough time for the trio to process what was happening, and swiftly knocks down the two at the door. With his free hand, he blocks a punch from the leader with a magic shield, whispers to his cloak, and Levi wraps itself around the kidnapper&rsquo;s head.</p><p>&ldquo;Surprise asshole.&rdquo;</p><p>He goes down with a loud thud and Stephen takes the phone out of his hand. Tony chuckles&nbsp; from the other end. &ldquo;Finished already?&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen scowls. &ldquo;Not quite.&rdquo; He breaks the chains around Peter with his magic and hands the phone to the teen. &ldquo;Talk to your father until I&rsquo;m done.&rdquo;</p><p>The sorcerer turns his attention back to the three men as they move to their feet and Peter cringes when Stephen knocks them back down with his whip. He presses two fingers on each of the lackies foreheads, putting them to sleep, and grabs the leader by the throat as he looks at Peter.</p><p>&ldquo;Did he do anything?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just punched me.&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen raises an eyebrow and punches the final conscious captor, hiding a wince when his hand protests the action. When the third body falls to the ground, the sorcerer binds them with a rope before sending them through a separate portal that Peter assumed was a police station from the glimpse he got. Levi calmly takes its place on Stephen&rsquo;s shoulders after shivering out the rest of it&rsquo;s fury.</p><p>&ldquo;I think Mom is done.&rdquo; Peter says to Tony.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll notify the police. Let Mama Bear look you over and rest&hellip;and stay in the tower until I get home.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But-&rdquo; Peter starts to protest but both men give him a look. &ldquo;Fine.&rdquo;</p><p>He hands the phone back to Stephen who exchanges a few more words with Tony before hanging up and kneeling in front of Peter. He gently takes Peter&rsquo;s face in trembling hands and studies his injuries before waving a finger back and forth, asking him to follow it.</p><p>&ldquo;I can only see a bruise. Do you have any other pain?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter knew better than to lie to the doctor. He would see right through him anyway. &ldquo;I have a migraine&hellip;and I think I was drugged.&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen nods and helps the teen to his feet. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get you home and in bed. Your metabolism should burn the rest of the drug off in the next couple of hours.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter nods and follows Stephen through the portal back home and he sighs quietly when the doctor gently kneeds the base of his skull. It felt amazing and was doing wonders for his migraine. He wouldn&rsquo;t mind curling up to Stephen and letting him continue his massage instead of taking pain killers.</p><p>The sorcerer chuckles. &ldquo;Whatever you like Spiderling.&rdquo; Peter looks up at him in surprise. &ldquo;You said it out loud. Do you think you can eat something or does your head hurt too much?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Head hurts.&rdquo; Peter mutters.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p><p>Strange leads the boy to his room and lays with him on his bed, allowing the teen to snuggle up to him before massaging his neck again. Peter sighs happily against his collarbone and tense muscles slowly yield to Stephen&rsquo;s ministrations.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks for coming for me&hellip;&rdquo; The boy huffs out a laugh. &ldquo;You were really cool.&rdquo;</p><p>Stephen laughs. &ldquo;Always Spider-Baby.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not a baby.&rdquo; Was Peter&rsquo;s muffled response.</p><p>Before he could tease the boy, he felt more than he heard soft snores come from the body attached to his front.</p><p>&ldquo;Very convincing.&rdquo;</p></p>",
