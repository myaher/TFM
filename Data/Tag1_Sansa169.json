        "question": "Hi Arya stan from before here. I don\u2019t hate Sansa I actually really like her character and started following her tag on tumblr and guess what it\u2019s super annoying most of the time to try and appreciate her when there\u2019s 1000+ blogs who can\u2019t just like her without hating Arya and Dany. Season 7 had shit writing for all of the characters so I get being angry at Arya for the things she did then because some of it was dumb I get it. I just find it really annoying that Sansa stans have spent the 1/2",
        "answer": "<p>Have spent the last week or so trashing Arya and Dany because of a 10 second clip that nothing happened in. Why do you guys want her to come for Dany and Arya? Why do you want to watch a show where they make women fight because it\u2019s fucking gross? I see no one comparing the male characters and preparing them to go against each other. I don\u2019t think Sansa is an idiot. Dany is an important ally against the white walkers and I hope they come to appreciate each other and work together. I hope she 2/3</p><p>I hope she protects Arya and they actually get along like her parents would\u2019ve wanted them to. The last thing I want to see is a season of Sansa passive aggressively berating everyone in the room just for the sake of her being a \u201cbad ass\u201d it\u2019s stupid and doesn\u2019t make any sense. Go watch the video where the writers discuss season 7 and you\u2019ll see that Sansa was still being manipulated by Petyr and did want to take power from Jon. Arya had a right not to trust her in the beginning. 3/3</p><p>________</p><p>What\u2019s so wrong about me having an opinion and expressing it? I can\u2019t stand S7 Arya and Daenerys in the show, and I have every right to express why. If you don\u2019t like that I do that, just block me or mute the anti arya stark and anti daenerys targaryen tags so none of that pops up in your efforts in finding someone who appreciates all three characters. I\u2019m sure there are people who love Sansa that think really fondly of Arya and Daenerys. I\u2019ve seen some of these people, and I even follow some of them. There\u2019s two Daenerys stans on twitter that I absolutely love, and their analysis on her character (especially the book version of her) is outstanding. There\u2019s a lot of Sansa stans as well who I see really appreciate the sisterhood between her and Arya, who have both of them as their favorite characters. All props to them. However, that\u2019s not me. I don\u2019t like these two characters (among many others) right now and I\u2019m not going to pretend to like them, or filter my opinions because of some stranger on tumblr. If I like them later on, then that\u2019s good, but we\u2019ll get there when we get there. I\u2019m here because I want to discuss the series in a candid manner, and how am I supposed to do that when whenever I talk about my negative feelings on a character, someone always complains on my blog about it. If you don\u2019t want to see that negativity, block the tag, or me. Yes, I fully agree that Season 7 has been really bad for most characters. Not all though. Cersei stood out to me as being magnificent in the past season. She clearly surpassed her father in any way you could think of. Jaime I still really enjoy and find quite compelling. Even though I wasn\u2019t satisfied with some elements in her story <strike>(aka. everything that has to do with Arya)</strike>, I really enjoyed Sansa and her story-line last season as well. Plus, there was Theon, who\u2019s character arc is turning out quite different from what I originally imagined. So there\u2019s that. I didn\u2019t like what was going on with pretty much everyone else, and I\u2019ll elaborate on that if I wish to.\u00a0</p><p>The thing is that Sansa stans have said nothing about Arya in relation to the new content that has been put out. Arya stans just want to insert themselves in an argument that they play absolutely no part in. This has nothing to do with Arya. Yes, I did make a post elaborating on my frustration of how much of an absolute monster she was <strike>(don\u2019t kill the messager, maisie williams said that first)</strike>\u00a0last season and how the show is literally going to ignore it, but when it comes to the actual trailer and any of my post about it, Arya wasn\u2019t even really on my mind. Nor was she on any of my mutuals mind either. That being said, let\u2019s talk about Daenerys for a moment. I criticize Daenerys because she\u2019s a tyrant, because she\u2019s an imperialist, because she has committed literal atrocities, because she has been neglectful of the former slaves in Essos, because she is pretty much slated to commit atrocities in Westoros as well. She is a threat that needs to be dealt with, in the same way that Cersei and the White Walkers are, and I don\u2019t even know how Daenerys stans manage to still ignore it when all of Emilia Clarke\u2019s interviews about this new season alludes to the fact that Daenerys is going to snap soon. Plus, for starters, when has Daenerys been a good ally to the North? She has been more of an inconvenience in the fight against the white walkers than everyone else combined. She gave them a literal dragon that destroyed the wall. Because of her actions and general incompetence, thousands of people are going to die. That\u2019s not forgetting that without Daenerys in the equation, all the seven kingdoms could have worked together to deal with the threat, but now Cersei is going to stab everyone in the back. So like\u2026Daenerys really needs to clean up her mess. Also, the idea that having two female characters be against each other is\u00a0\u2018\u2018fucking gross\u2019\u2018 is just weird. Y\u2019all didn\u2019t say the same thing when Daenerys and Cersei were fighting for the throne. Y\u2019all didn\u2019t say the same thing with Lysa was trying to murder Sansa. Y\u2019all didn\u2019t say the same thing when any of the male characters have expressed distaste with each other. There was a literal war of FIVE kings, but it\u2019s so terrible to suggest that two women who would have very valid reasons to not like each other, don\u2019t like each other. The trailer hints at that, all the casual fans are talking about it and articles that were written months beforehand even suggested this being an actual thing. This is not something that Sansa stans have created out of thin air. It\u2019s a legitimate plot point in the story, that you will just have to learn to accept one moment or the other because it\u2019s going to be an actual thing. And did you just say that you don\u2019t see people pining the male characters against each other? Cleganebowl? Did you forget about that? People have been hyping it up for years now. Daenerys has been a liability thus far, and has done absolutely nothing to earn the trust of anybody in the seven kingdoms, so I really don\u2019t see what Sansa has to like or respect about her, especially considering that she risked her life in order to take her ancestral home back and have it be independent again.</p><p>Honestly, Sansa and Arya are probably going to get along just fine next season. I don\u2019t mind that, because that\u2019s what I wanted in the first place last season, but that didn\u2019t happen. Now, the writers made me intensely dislike a character that I really enjoyed, and that makes me extremely sad when looking at how much they could have done with their relationship and Arya as a character. I don\u2019t really care that much about Arya in the books, but there\u2019s a lot more to her character, and I understand why people love her that much. I don\u2019t share the feeling, but I understand. Arya in the show is an empty vacuum of murder and sexism, and I\u2019m not going to pretend that I like it. I also don\u2019t want Sansa to be passive aggressive towards everyone. I hope Jaime pledges his allegiance to her, I hope we get more moments between her and Brienne, I hope they have more conversations between Jon and Sansa, hope we get more of her with Bran as well. I hope that we get to see her dynamic with all kinds of characters. Just because I pointed out that she clearly doesn\u2019t like Daenerys doesn\u2019t mean I want her to dislike everyone. Also, just because I want the show to recognize that Arya has lost herself, doesn\u2019t mean that I want Sansa to hate her. I want the problem to be addressed in the narrative, and fixed later on. Also, Sansa wasn\u2019t really manipulated by Littlefinger. He was incapable of making her do one thing. He told her to keep Brienne close yet Sansa sent her away. He tried to increase the divide between her and Arya, and she spotted his slipup and went to Bran to verify all the information with him. On the other hand, Arya was running around spying everyone at Winterfell like a little rat, and tormenting Sansa for being feminine every step of the way. The only one he did manage to manipulate was Arya. Plus, Sansa was literally offered to take Jon\u2019s spot <strike>(and if she did it, I would have cheered)</strike>\u00a0 but she refused the damn thing. Like, we seen the scene. Also, the fact that Sansa wanted power, but still pushed herself to the side to let Jon have and keep it just goes to show how much of a great and caring person she is. Sansa was an absolute queen this season and had not committed one wrong act and that\u2019s the facts. So nope, Arya did not have any right to torment her, or to make her fear for her life seeing as Sansa did nothing wrong. I even made a <a href=\"https://mygoodqueensansa.tumblr.com/post/176600265202/none-of-aryas-criticism-of-sansa-makes-any-sense\">post </a>a while back elaborating on that, so if you want to read it, you can.\u00a0</p>",

I hope Jaime pledges his allegiance to her, I hope we get more moments between her and Brienne, I hope they have more conversations between Jon and Sansa, hope we get more of her with Bran as well. I hope that we get to see her dynamic with all kinds of characters. Just because I pointed out that she clearly doesn\u2019t like Daenerys doesn\u2019t mean I want her to dislike everyone. Also, just because I want the show to recognize that Arya has lost herself, doesn\u2019t mean that I want Sansa to hate her. I want the problem to be addressed in the narrative, and fixed later on. Also, Sansa wasn\u2019t really manipulated by Littlefinger. He was incapable of making her do one thing. He told her to keep Brienne close yet Sansa sent her away. He tried to increase the divide between her and Arya, and she spotted his slipup and went to Bran to verify all the information with him. On the other hand, Arya was running around spying everyone at Winterfell like a little rat, and tormenting Sansa for being feminine every step of the way. The only one he did manage to manipulate was Arya. Plus, Sansa was literally offered to take Jon\u2019s spot <strike>(and if she did it, I would have cheered)</strike>\u00a0 but she refused the damn thing. Like, we seen the scene. Also, the fact that Sansa wanted power, but still pushed herself to the side to let Jon have and keep it just goes to show how much of a great and caring person she is. Sansa was an absolute queen this season and had not committed one wrong act and that\u2019s the facts. So nope, Arya did not have any right to torment her, or to make her fear for her life seeing as Sansa did nothing wrong. I even made a <a href=\"https://mygoodqueensansa.tumblr.com/post/176600265202/none-of-aryas-criticism-of-sansa-makes-any-sense\">post </a>a while back elaborating on that, so if you want to read it, you can.\u00a0</p>",

Why do you want to watch a show where they make women fight because it\u2019s fucking gross? I see no one comparing the male characters and preparing them to go against each other. I don\u2019t think Sansa is an idiot. Dany is an important ally against the white walkers and I hope they come to appreciate each other and work together. I hope she 2/3</p><p>I hope she protects Arya and they actually get along like her parents would\u2019ve wanted them to. The last thing I want to see is a season of Sansa passive aggressively berating everyone in the room just for the sake of her being a \u201cbad ass\u201d it\u2019s stupid and doesn\u2019t make any sense. Go watch the video where the writers discuss season 7 and you\u2019ll see that Sansa was still being manipulated by Petyr and did want to take power from Jon. Arya had a right not to trust her in the beginning. 3/3</p><p>________</p><p>What\u2019s so wrong about me having an opinion and expressing it? I can\u2019t stand S7 Arya and Daenerys in the show, and I have every right to express why. If you don\u2019t like that I do that, just block me or mute the anti arya stark and anti daenerys targaryen tags so none of that pops up in your efforts in finding someone who appreciates all three characters. I\u2019m sure there are people who love Sansa that think really fondly of Arya and Daenerys. I\u2019ve seen some of these people, and I even follow some of them. There\u2019s two Daenerys stans on twitter that I absolutely love, and their analysis on her character (especially the book version of her) is outstanding. There\u2019s a lot of Sansa stans as well who I see really appreciate the sisterhood between her and Arya, who have both of them as their favorite characters. All props to them. However, that\u2019s not me. I don\u2019t like these two characters (among many others) right now and I\u2019m not going to pretend to like them, or filter my opinions because of some stranger on tumblr. If I like them later on, then that\u2019s good, but we\u2019ll get there when we get there. I\u2019m here because I want to discuss the series in a candid manner, and how am I supposed to do that when whenever I talk about my negative feelings on a character, someone always complains on my blog about it. If you don\u2019t want to see that negativity, block the tag, or me. Yes, I fully agree that Season 7 has been really bad for most characters. Not all though. Cersei stood out to me as being magnificent in the past season. She clearly surpassed her father in any way you could think of. Jaime I still really enjoy and find quite compelling. Even though I wasn\u2019t satisfied with some elements in her story <strike>(aka. everything that has to do with Arya)</strike>, I really enjoyed Sansa and her story-line last season as well. Plus, there was Theon, who\u2019s character arc is turning out quite different from what I originally imagined. So there\u2019s that. I didn\u2019t like what was going on with pretty much everyone else, and I\u2019ll elaborate on that if I wish to.\u00a0</p><p>The thing is that Sansa stans have said nothing about Arya in relation to the new content that has been put out. Arya stans just want to insert themselves in an argument that they play absolutely no part in. This has nothing to do with Arya. Yes, I did make a post elaborating on my frustration of how much of an absolute monster she was <strike>(don\u2019t kill the messager, maisie williams said that first)</strike>\u00a0last season and how the show is literally going to ignore it, but when it comes to the actual trailer and any of my post about it, Arya wasn\u2019t even really on my mind. Nor was she on any of my mutuals mind either. That being said, let\u2019s talk about Daenerys for a moment. I criticize Daenerys because she\u2019s a tyrant, because she\u2019s an imperialist, because she has committed literal atrocities, because she has been neglectful of the former slaves in Essos, because she is pretty much slated to commit atrocities in Westoros as well. She is a threat that needs to be dealt with, in the same way that Cersei and the White Walkers are, and I don\u2019t even know how Daenerys stans manage to still ignore it when all of Emilia Clarke\u2019s interviews about this new season alludes to the fact that Daenerys is going to snap soon. Plus, for starters, when has Daenerys been a good ally to the North? She has been more of an inconvenience in the fight against the white walkers than everyone else combined. She gave them a literal dragon that destroyed the wall. Because of her actions and general incompetence, thousands of people are going to die. That\u2019s not forgetting that without Daenerys in the equation, all the seven kingdoms could have worked together to deal with the threat, but now Cersei is going to stab everyone in the back. So like\u2026Daenerys really needs to clean up her mess. Also, the idea that having two female characters be against each other is\u00a0\u2018\u2018fucking gross\u2019\u2018 is just weird. Y\u2019all didn\u2019t say the same thing when Daenerys and Cersei were fighting for the throne. Y\u2019all didn\u2019t say the same thing with Lysa was trying to murder Sansa. Y\u2019all didn\u2019t say the same thing when any of the male characters have expressed distaste with each other. There was a literal war of FIVE kings, but it\u2019s so terrible to suggest that two women who would have very valid reasons to not like each other, don\u2019t like each other. The trailer hints at that, all the casual fans are talking about it and articles that were written months beforehand even suggested this being an actual thing. This is not something that Sansa stans have created out of thin air. It\u2019s a legitimate plot point in the story, that you will just have to learn to accept one moment or the other because it\u2019s going to be an actual thing. And did you just say that you don\u2019t see people pining the male characters against each other? Cleganebowl? Did you forget about that? People have been hyping it up for years now. Daenerys has been a liability thus far, and has done absolutely nothing to earn the trust of anybody in the seven kingdoms, so I really don\u2019t see what Sansa has to like or respect about her, especially considering that she risked her life in order to take her ancestral home back and have it be independent again.</p><p>Honestly, Sansa and Arya are probably going to get along just fine next season. I don\u2019t mind that, because that\u2019s what I wanted in the first place last season, but that didn\u2019t happen. Now, the writers made me intensely dislike a character that I really enjoyed, and that makes me extremely sad when looking at how much they could have done with their relationship and Arya as a character. I don\u2019t really care that much about Arya in the books, but there\u2019s a lot more to her character, and I understand why people love her that much. I don\u2019t share the feeling, but I understand. Arya in the show is an empty vacuum of murder and sexism, and I\u2019m not going to pretend that I like it. I also don\u2019t want Sansa to be passive aggressive towards everyone.

In <a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/181846188337/a-ladys-armor-part-2\" target=\"_blank\">Part 2</a>, I discussed the textures on Sansa\u2019s costumes that contrast the severe cuts on her dresses. In this part, I mean to compare her costumes with that of Dany\u2019s and Cersei\u2019s in order to understand them better as they act as characters who visually look towards one another.\u00a0\u00a0</p><h2><b>A Comparison of Textures</b></h2><figure data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"2880\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0a80ea1ec25bc43965e2e6836560c7cc/tumblr_inline_pl2kzw2njY1u48vsz_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"2880\"/></figure><p>In season 7, colours were neutralised across the board as winter has come, characters\u2019 costumes started reflecting their deceased ancestors more and Sansa, Dany and Cersei\u2019s costumes had paralleling silhouettes.\u00a0The costumes were designed around the idea that these women were gearing up for war as all the main characters are finally in Westeros and winter having come. As Clapton mentions, there is kind of\u00a0\u201chardening\u201d resulting in their costumes looking like armors.\u00a0In such a season although there are differences to be spotted in those silhouettes, the textures and their progression through the season reveal and contextualise a lot more on their costumes.\u00a0\u00a0</p><!-- more --><p>Unlike Dany and Sansa whose costumes change a lot compared to season 6, Cersei\u2019s Tywin-esque black leather coronation dress with shoulder plates carries over to season 7. And one could say that through the season in terms of texture and silhouettes, her costumes through the most changes. All this while her colours of black and silver remain mostly constant with only a touch of gold peaking through some embroidery and beading. In a sense, Cersei has been wearing black in mourning since Joffrey\u2019s death in season 4, which was followed by Tywin\u2019s, Myrcella\u2019s and Tommen\u2019s later. So it\u2019s the hardening that was new, not the colour by itself, and of course the dominance of silver rather than gold.\u00a0<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"2880\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/784703893c8aa066a24da2964a50a742/tumblr_inline_pl2smi2RMx1u48vsz_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"2880\"/></figure><p> Compared to Sansa, Cersei\u2019s costumes have a far more severe look with more elaborate textures, her high collars and sharp and ostentatious accessories. It\u2019s all rather over the top. She wears leather (perforated or bumpy), silk, textured wool, metal and very narrow ribbed patterns. The black leather is inspired by Tywin who wore a similar jerkin like her coronation dress. Behind the perforations is a layer of brocade. Interestingly, even the other ribbed textured black leather dress references Casterly Rock in its elements looking like rocks and being slightly coated with gold and burgundy but this can go unnoticed.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"333\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2cfd7c8673c56940a96e56cb601f03b8/tumblr_inline_ppmvw9FoFe1u48vsz_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"333\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure><p>A recurring pattern through these costumes is they all reflect light and\u00a0\u201cshine\u201d and with the inclusion of armor-like pieces through heavy embroidery and beading or metallic renditions like shoulder plates and chainmail, they attract even more attention.

Then to <b>pare down the crown into just simple strokes that to me looked like a lion still,</b> that\u2019s what they\u2019re meant to be,<b> but without that sort of solid heraldic lion that she\u2019s usually worn</b>.

But more onto that later. Though Cersei\u2019s crown is predominantly silver, there are wisps of gold in it, which matters.</p><p>\u201c<i>I chose to make it in silver with just wisps of gold to try to show<b> her isolation, her mental disentangling from her family</b>. There is no reference to [her late husband, Robert] Baratheon; there is no need anymore. She doesn\u2019t have to try and prove a link. <b>The center of the crown is the lion sigil abstracted \u2014 its mane represents the Iron Throne, her desire</b>. <b>She has made it her own \u2014 she is reborn</b>.</i>\u201c - <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2016/06/cersei-lannister-crown-was-designed-to-show-her-isolation.html?mid=facebook_vulture\" target=\"_blank\">Clapton to Vulture</a></p><p>Although we see Cersei dressed in black dresses with extravagant beading and embroidery through the season, we also get moments in private where she wears those same dresses without them. Clapton had this done very intentionally to symbolise her mental state.\u00a0<br/></p><p><i>\u201c<b>She uses this beading [as] this sense of power but it\u2019s all quite brittle and it\u2019s all an adornment</b>. It\u2019s not part of the dress,\u201d Clapton explains. \u201cShe has a collar and she has these shoulder pieces, but<b> they\u2019re separate from the dress. Everything\u2019s removable</b> and I thought it was really important that her dress, the simple dress underneath is really uncluttered. <b>She\u2019s in mourning.

But you see a touch of gold creeping into her costumes sometimes and that hints the gold is waiting to come back.\u00a0</p><p>Fragility in this case doesn\u2019t just mean weak and vulnerable (although grief is a great part of it), but also unstable because she has lost almost everyone she has loved. She has no one (apart from Jaime) to protect and there is nothing to stop her from pulling the trigger on the world if she so wishes.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"4691\" data-orig-height=\"2937\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/26f7042591376bba1e2f48dbfae504d3/tumblr_inline_pl31m75mkH1u48vsz_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"4691\" data-orig-height=\"2937\"/></figure><p>When you compare Clapton\u2019s idea for Cersei\u2019s armor being brittle because it\u2019s removable, she does the opposite for Sansa.\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cAll the characters\u2019 costumes are a consequence of the journey and lifestyle,\u201d Clapton states, particularly referencing a favorite piece of hers \u2014 <b>Sansa\u2019s belt</b>. \u201cThis is her<b> taking back control of her body</b>. I designed it to <b>wrap around over her side-laced dress</b> to represent the <b>absolute removal of any possible physical touch</b>.

And little is removable, like her cloak or her Northern collar piece with direwolves. But the rest always stays on. The shoulder pads sewn onto the dress, the tightly laced belt and straps around her and her chain always being on are a big part of representing that armor.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"3006\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e9ad0e34ebc852b529be4870c54e0f2c/tumblr_inline_pl4o7s9jpB1u48vsz_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"3006\"/></figure><p>Unlike Cersei, her dress <i>is</i> her armor and there are no uncluttered layers beneath.

But like I\u2019ve mentioned before, she\u2019s binding herself so tight it\u2019s slightly oppressive to her own being.\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s interesting how where Cersei\u2019s dresses go more outward, Sansa\u2019s go more inward.\u00a0Cersei also uses a lot more volume in her skirts than Sansa does, showing especially in her coronation dress and her dress with spikes between embroidery. Although the fabric is silk and the texture is smooth, with her beading and structure of her skirts, it looks stiffer and unnerving.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"3200\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/97af30c353c6e75296ba00c62db3d900/tumblr_inline_pl1pkkriwx1u48vsz_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"3200\"/></figure><p>Even though its a smooth surface, the pleating is quite severe while being flamboyant around the waist and also has an armor like quality in a different way.\u00a0Yet despite this display of strength, Clapton was once again driven back to the beading catching light and glittering.\u00a0</p><p><i>Interviewer: The other costume in the exhibition that has gotten a lot of attention is Cersei\u2019s beaded black gown.</i></p><p><i>Clapton: For that<b> I really wanted her to be in black because it\u2019s what she\u2019s about at the moment.</b> But I knew she would go down into the cellar and it would be dark.<b> I just wanted those pieces to catch the light, the flames. </b>So it was quite excessive!</i><a href=\"https://blog.fidmmuseum.org/museum/2018/09/interview-with-game-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton.html\" target=\"_blank\">(FIDM Museum Exhibition)</a><br/></p><p>Thereby, even this dress while it appears strong is still a continuation of that brittleness.

So far most of Cersei\u2019s embellishment has been on her shoulders and neck and during the Dragonpit meeting, we see her wearing that slashing pattern representing a\u00a0\u201csting in the tail\u201d it on her back. Also we see her in\u00a0a black molded coat shaped like armor without any adornment while she wears a chainmail like dress underneath. More so, after she walks away and talks to Tyrion in the privacy of her room, she takes off her black coat and only wears her chainmail dress.\u00a0Generally, it\u2019s been the other way around through the season.\u00a0</p><p>But after he\u2019s gone and she confesses the truth to Jaime, she is back in one of her black dresses without any adornment. So that play of wearing the chainmail dress while Tyrion was there hinted that she was lying and putting up a front. In the scene where Jaime leaves, she also throws a black fur on, which hints winter in its true form is coming in snow to King\u2019s Landing. With Jaime gone, I imagine her armor is going to shift a bit from an outward show a bit - even if the design would again hint the price she has had to pay to get the throne.\u00a0</p><p>Given Dany\u2019s dress suits are shorter and worn over pants, they don\u2019t cover that much volume. But it\u2019s not that she doesn\u2019t have details of note and she does show off in her own way. A pattern that continues through the season is how red slowly keeps creeping up in her costumes - even after they recede.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"3072\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/cedf6a41eb7dd91289ec959ed2234d7e/tumblr_inline_pl1q4iwOl21u48vsz_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"3072\"/></figure><p><i>&ldquo;With Daenerys, there&rsquo;s a creeping of red within the scaling embroidery of her coat.

However, her silver \u201cchain of intent\u201d stays.\u00a0This highlights Cersei\u2019s beading and its symbolism of her brittleness as even Sansa moves away from it. Instead, Dany takes on a new dark grey side laced winter coat with cream coloured fur lining in the Field of Fire 2.0. The patterned texture on it is subtly bit scale like. Then she wears white and grey ribbed and quilted version of it for the wighthunt. In season 8, this white coat seems to take on more red lining in its ridges. You can see the progression of these costumes leading into one another.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"2315\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/65905848cf2b7cc7a03eaa3a79ef5faa/tumblr_inline_pl1q7xLJwC1u48vsz_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"2315\"/></figure><p>She also wears her pleated and scale-like red silk sash on her dresses on ceremonial occasions, like bidding Jorah and Jon goodbye and the Dragonpit meeting apart from meeting Jon in the throne room.

But where Dany is drawing from one animal at this point, Sansa does so from more than one - including wolves.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"5115\" data-orig-height=\"2711\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3054192caa09b479b77973965f39e9fc/tumblr_inline_pl291eneRv1u48vsz_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5115\" data-orig-height=\"2711\"/></figure><p>When you compare both their textures, Sansa\u2019s is deliberately more rugged around the edges to create the impression of white fur on the hems of cloth strips quilted on her. So while those feathers can look like (fish) scales in an armor, they can also look like fur trimmings.\u00a0This gets more pronounced when seen beside Dany and Cersei who have more refined textures.\u00a0 \u00a0<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"2622\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/074a85d6add6b051b3f67ed49421acf9/tumblr_inline_pl29258fjA1u48vsz_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"2622\"/></figure><p>Also where a lot of Dany\u2019s and Cersei\u2019s fabric and embellishment is symmetrical and Sansa\u2019s is too, hers is a bit more earthy. Take her stitching on the vertical lines of the Eyrie dress. It looks like a clean stitch from afar but up close, they look more like vine branches or thorns or maybe they\u2019re even representative of lacing again.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"2880\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a9bce638e9335802fef72514384c1bd4/tumblr_inline_pl2bycaUDH1u48vsz_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"2880\"/></figure><p>When Clapton talked about thinking about Sansa\u2019s frustration, I could see how these lines are were used to express that.\u00a0Her Eyrie dress is completely deconstructed and is reconstructed considering her disdain for Littlefinger while also using him as an ally they need.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Her minimised and orderly dress cut is contrasted by these stitching lines or the cloth strips\u2019 roughened hems or the feathers being a bit disarray. It looks handmade, especially up close, rather than custom made like Dany\u2019s and Cersei\u2019s costumes that have clean lines. And it\u2019s not because Sansa can\u2019t stitch better, but rather it reflects her feelings, her trauma, her change and where she is at right now. Because of this, there is still quite an intimate quality about her textures. It\u2019s not just for a show of strength like Cersei\u2019s beading and embroidery. Her stitching and quilting is for herself too.\u00a0</p><p>Dany\u2019s textures are still less rough and sharp than Cersei\u2019s. Apart from her sashes, her pleated fan-like skirt underneath is of a smoother texture as well. It\u2019s a carry over from time as queen in Meereen when she\u2019s not acting as a warrior queen but sitting the throne. Incidentally, Cersei wears another layer under as well, but again, it\u2019s not as thin or as fine as Dany\u2019s pleated skirt.\u00a0<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"5114\" data-orig-height=\"3398\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f1f227a8f03550ee656ebc041b1850b8/tumblr_inline_pl1qda4Hh01u48vsz_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5114\" data-orig-height=\"3398\"/></figure><p>It\u2019s worth noting that Sansa doesn\u2019t have a slit that reveals another skirt underneath - despite that being part of the Northern garb. It\u2019s another part of \u201cbinding herself against vulnerability\u201d. Like Sansa, Dany\u2019s armor is a fundamental part of every costume and she isn\u2019t shown taking off her armored layer and wearing a simpler layer by itself.\u00a0Even so, Dany\u2019s bodice is a lot more armoured from within than Sansa. Dany is a military leader after all.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>You can see in the way [Dany is] dressing that <b>she&rsquo;s almost assuming the power but not quite</b>. With <b>all the colors and the details and the essence </b>\u2014 <b>it just becomes stronger</b>. The width of the shoulders give her strength, the chain gives her strength.

Rather it makes her look more different. The narrow ribbed texture, lack of a belt and visible side flap of Dany\u2019s winter coat highlight their differences.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"3072\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4989dbfd6323c74e2406beeaf4de2787/tumblr_inline_pl1yzry8dS1u48vsz_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"3072\"/></figure><p>Interestingly, Sansa\u2019s \u201cfish swimming\u201d dress that doesn\u2019t have a bodice with horizontal lines undercutting its otherwise vertal lines (as in her Eyrie dress) should look more similar. But what undercuts it is the variety of textures (and complementary ones at that) and muted shades that Sansa wears and her tight lacing that masks their similarities. Moreover, with her furs on her shoulders, the dress\u2019 armor like shoulder tabs get masked.\u00a0<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"3072\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fd64f94f073681315f13dccd7034ecd5/tumblr_inline_pl1vzq5yUx1u48vsz_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"3072\"/></figure><p>Also, the choice to not use a cloak is interesting too because once again it distances Dany from not just Sansa\u2019s look but even Jon\u2019s wildling look - even when the colours are geared towards him.\u00a0It\u2019s fashioned out of Mance\u2019s coat of pelts that Jon\u2019s costume is inspired by on the mission and yet there\u2019s so much amiss about it.\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cLater, Dany\u2019s white fur coat also shows another connection to Northern people. \u201cI took reference from the Wildlings\u2019 attire, particularly the coat that is worn by Jon Snow which was in turn influenced by Mance Rayder,\u201d Clapton said. \u201c<b>I wanted to define Dany\u2019s shape by cutting into and shaping the fur.</b> Also, I was keen to create <b>a warrior look, a thing of beauty</b>.</i>\u201d - <a href=\"https://www.huffpostbrasil.com/entry/game-of-thrones-costume-designer-explains-danys-meaningful-outfits_us_59a4319fe4b06d67e33926b6?ec_carp=8265756527327536922\" target=\"_blank\">Huffpost</a></p><p>As pointed out before, her silhouette is defined by Viserys in this costume and it shows as she sports the side flap that characterises the Targaryen style, that she also wears the Field of Fire 2.0. Moreover, with her platinum blonde hair, she looks too white. So in front of her, he\u00a0looks like a wildling and she looks too queenly in pristine white and such angular cuts while Jon looks a lot more padded with a number of stitched up pelts of different\u00a0\u201cdirty\u201d colours like the men on his team. Though what does separate him from them (and Mance) is his cross strap, which again Dany doesn\u2019t wear. It\u2019s to tie Ned\u2019s brown fur around him and is a sign of his status as king.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"407\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4f2cb8f937dda32c173c58c3601730b8/tumblr_inline_pl2gr4vCww1u48vsz_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"407\"/></figure><p>Strangely because of Sansa\u2019s cross strap, belt and variety of warm dark colours, her costume complements Jon\u2019s a lot more than Dany\u2019s does - again despite the dresses having similar silhouettes. Even her grey against white, is too light a grey that she looks mostly white.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Of course, Sansa looks a lot more sophisticated but still within the orbit because she wears colours of black, brown and darker greys because of the number of textures she mixes as part of quilting her dress along with her belt with leather straps criss crossing around her. While her cuts are severe too, it\u2019s important to remember her dress is fashioned after the Night\u2019s Watch armor and her shoulder tabs echo that along with the Stark men\u2019s jerkin sleeves pointing downward (unlike Dany\u2019s that point upward) so there is still more roundness to it and it increases under a cloak with furs. Dany\u2019s costume (added with a dragon) stands out too much on its own because of how finely it\u2019s done and how uncluttered it is with only one silver chain of intent. It might be designed out of a similar material but they still look at odds with each other.\u00a0</p><p>Dany\u2019s winter coat doesn\u2019t look any more complementary when Jon wears his usual costume which consists of black, browns and greys and no white and a black cloak. I\u2019m bringing up her visual dissonance with Jon because it ties into Northern politics and identity and how Dany fits or doesn\u2019t fit into all of it.\u00a0</p><p>What\u2019s interesting about this white winter coat is that it doesn\u2019t remain as it was and season 8 promotion has footage featuring Dany in a similar white winter coat but with more red and that has a loaded meaning of Targaryen \u201cfire and blood\u201d considering Clapton withheld it for 6 seasons and only started teasing it in season 7 a bit.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"2815\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/aea808df4d01f56d405e736487faf345/tumblr_inline_pl1qk909mC1u48vsz_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"2815\"/></figure><p>\u201c<i>I think it\u2019s quite interesting that <b>we finally see her embracing her brother\u2019s ambition</b>,\u201d Clapton says. \u201c<b>What does that say?

The more she tries to fit in with her white fur coat in a sea of grey, blacks, browns and warm blues and with a red silk ascot that isn\u2019t how the Northern undershirt is tied, the more of an outsider she looks. Even when she wears white furs, she looks blatantly different. The white beading on white fur seems a bit much especially considering the silhouette. This again shows how much Dany is trying to merge her own identity and heritage with the Northern culture, and she\u2019s failing because they\u2019re at odds with each other - because of her actions in Westeros, her history and her heritage.\u00a0</p><p>Additionally from the EW cover, there is a hint of a red sash showing behind her winter coat. People might claim it resembles Sansa\u2019s white cloak from her wedding to Ramsay, but again, the silhouettes and even general material aren\u2019t the same as <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3sVGPVR6Ra7mnliy4eLYPg\" target=\"_blank\">@trinuviel</a> points out in their post.\u00a0A red sash on a fur coat looks quite flimsy because again the textures and silhouettes are at odds but as Clapton pointed out, it\u2019s a symbol of status and grandeur.</p><p>\u201c<i>The more she connects with her family the more she adopts them into her costume.

At the Dragonpit, she wears a black molded coat with short sleeves.

It\u2019s also longer, more rounded and shapely around her dress than Cersei\u2019s is. It\u2019s almost as if she has sewn the fur into her dress. Also where Cersei\u2019s is black, Sansa\u2019s is grey peppered with black, like Catelyn\u2019s. Also unlike Cersei, Sansa still wears her belt and chain necklace with her needle. Her armor is still on. It\u2019s always on.\u00a0</p><p>The cloak and furs are a big part of levelling out this severe structure and making it feel more organic at points. This is one of the reasons why Sansa\u2019s costume still looks complementary beside Jon\u2019s apart from her textures and her colours being black and dark grey complementing his black and brown a lot more than Dany\u2019s costumes.\u00a0<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"650\" data-orig-height=\"365\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b37b72cbed62a487dfffcd5e7d5af6cf/tumblr_inline_pl1qxiujfN1u48vsz_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"650\" data-orig-height=\"365\"/></figure><p>Where Sansa wore the palest blue amongst the Starks and a smaller grey fur on her cloak making her stand out and Jon wore a cream fur on his cloak in the back, they now wear grey and brown furs respectively taking after Catelyn and Ned\u2019s fur colours.\u00a0</p><p>Also silhouette wise, it hides the armor. This comes up in Littlefinger\u2019s trial, where Sansa wears her recurring grey cloak (now lined with fur on its hood) since she escaped King\u2019s Landing with his help. The way she wears it sideways is a bit like how Arya wears her cape in season 7.

Initially, I thought it was just poor designing but considering the themes I\u2019ve discovered while writing this post, I think it may be yet another symbol of her using it as her armor in a way that the grey cloak that has been used as a motif of her life as a hostage looks \u201chardened\u201d even when draped to her side because it\u2019s done in such a deliberate manner. It looks very controlled and seems like she has her walls up. Even after we see Sansa and Arya reconciling on the battlements, we don\u2019t see them closing the distance between them as Jon did with Sansa in season 6 finale. Sansa isn\u2019t free yet, because her demons go much further than physical ones.]</p><p>Dany and Cersei forgo this throughout, while Sansa only took off her cloak when Jon was still in Winterfell and even then, not always.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>Clapton noted that Sansa\u2019s (Sophie Turner) costumes contained <b>subtle references to her history, as well</b>. <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bow-down-sansa-stark-is-finally-a-player-in-the-game-of-thrones_us_596cf8cae4b0e983c0580cbf\" target=\"_blank\">After winning back Winterfell from her abusive husband and his army</a>,\u00a0Sansa\u2019s stiff, black <b>dress-and-cloak combinations have reflected \u201can idea of being wrapped, a sense of security, laced in, protected,</b>\u201d the costumer explained.</i>\u00a0<i>The cut of the costume was very fitted and severe but the <b>fabrics were soft, textured and quilted</b>.

It\u2019s not about her liking these people or that she wants to be like them, but collecting arsenal slowly and after all that abuse and exploitation that still informs her arc, she\u2019s trying to piece herself back together and armor herself with everything her enemies used against her apart from her family\u2019s influence. She subverts them by adding a needle, which Clapton fashioned after Arya\u2019s, to Littlefinger\u2019s chain, by wearing her Eyrie dress feathers but using it to cover her chest and wearing it against grey rather than black and wearing bold statements of Stark iconography showing what she identifies as despite the marriages she was forced into. It\u2019s like patchwork involved in quilting, like a collage. It\u2019s not all from one place but she\u2019s still trying to place it all together. It comes from a place of defence and fear of harm that will follow more than offence that people assume. A fear of loss of agency and control. And yet, she\u2019s still not at the end of the process. So the narrative does raise the question of\u00a0\u201cWhere is she going? Does she know where she is going? Will she falter?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Even <a href=\"http://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a10353135/game-of-thrones-sansa-stark-necklace/\" target=\"_blank\">Littlefinger has influenced Sansa</a>, in a way, with the decision of how she loops and wears things. <b>She&rsquo;s taken a lot of knowledge from bad people, and she&rsquo;s hopefully going to use it to good effect one day. </b>I try to always speak to that\u2014where have they come from and what have they been through.</i>&rdquo; - <a href=\"https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/news/a47144/game-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton-easter-eggs/\" target=\"_blank\">Michele Clapton, Elle</a><br/></p><p>She\u2019s a work in progress and she\u2019s not done with putting all the pieces together.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p><p>As I\u2019ve mentioned above the use of quilting is quite interesting interesting against Cersei\u2019s and Dany\u2019s beading. It shifts the mode of textures when she has used it in the past to express herself through recurring motifs her arc. It marks the fact that winter has come with its cold and preservation and sustenance is of utmost importance. It shifts the perception of what is necessary and what is too much as a lot of things are scaled down costume wise.\u00a0</p><p>Where Cersei\u2019s beading and use of sharp spikes is excessive, colours stand out for Dany a lot more because of red finally coming into her costume after 6 seasons and the way Clapton plays with the presence and absence of red, black, white and grey as she is the character who fluctuates the most in terms of colour in season 7.\u00a0Still her embroidery and beading, winter fur coat (that replicates dragon textures) and silky sash call a lot more attention than Sansa\u2019s costumes do - whether her fish swimming one or her Eyrie feathers one. She looks modest and conservative in comparison.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"4169\" data-orig-height=\"3809\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5f96cd512fbc56d65f6131c69fc8cc9d/tumblr_inline_pl1qswPDOW1u48vsz_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"4169\" data-orig-height=\"3809\"/></figure><p>This is partly because Sansa is the most stable in terms of her colour, wearing muted dark shades of grey, black and brown, and even textures, which as Clapton says are inspired by her mother\u2019s Northern ones. This is quite noteworthy considering Clapton uses her chain with the circle and needle to represent the dilemma of\u00a0\u201cWill she falter?\u201d that she parallels against Dany\u2019s\u00a0\u201cchain of intent\u201d.\u00a0<br/></p><p>But it makes sense considering she has gone through the journey of first being enamoured by and later betrayed by glamour and then using it to appease another abuser. That backfired and then it became an act of defiance and personal expression. It\u2019s about her sense of self and the loss of it.\u00a0</p><p>Ironically for being the Stark that looked the most different in pale blue and couldn\u2019t wait to leave home, after escaping Ramsay she sewed Jon and herself fur coats fashioned after Ned and Catelyn and even a deep blue dress influenced by her mother\u2019s colours and she embroidered with a huge direwolf stamped on her chest - like a Stark banner before she took back Winterfell with Jon. Now Sansa stands garbed mostly in greys embracing House Stark\u2019s colours while trying to find herself again. Now when a queen comes visiting Winterfell, she doesn\u2019t look at her with awe and excitement that she did for Cersei but apprehension and judgment for taking away the sovereignty of the North in exchange for aid. \u00a0\u00a0<br/></p><p>While clothing and sewing is still a very intimate act for her that connects her to her childhood, she is finally at a point where she understands the necessity of practicality like her mother did. Now as Lady of Winterfell, she is planning sustenance through and beyond the war as well as she prepares for food and making sure people stay warm, which neither Cersei nor Dany seem concerned with. She\u2019s framed as a queen in the making. And tested for it because of the enemies had to face on a very personal level. One has to remember that before season 7, showwise Sansa didn\u2019t have the agency to be in charge of handling matters without an abuser above her. Even in season 6, it was more of battle. So she does falter and still make points about the limitations, but she\u2019s learning in a different way.\u00a0</p><p>And yet because Sansa basically hides behind an armor so no one can get to her again, people misjudge her. This armor isn\u2019t just political. It\u2019s so deeply personal. But more onto that in the next part.\u00a0</p><p>(to be continued&hellip;)</p><p><b>A/N:</b> Sorry, this was long. There\u2019s just a lot of points that came up and I thought of breaking it down but I\u2019ve been having down with a constant headache for days because of a cold. Keeping it in my drafts only makes me add more stuff to it. So I thought I should get it out. I didn\u2019t cover the comparison of Sansa and Dany\u2019s chains as much as I wanted. I\u2019ll probably bring it up in my next post because it sort of extends into silhouettes in a sense.\u00a0</p>",

As Clapton mentions, there is kind of\u00a0\u201chardening\u201d resulting in their costumes looking like armors.\u00a0In such a season although there are differences to be spotted in those silhouettes, the textures and their progression through the season reveal and contextualise a lot more on their costumes.\u00a0\u00a0</p>[[MORE]]<p>Unlike Dany and Sansa whose costumes change a lot compared to season 6, Cersei\u2019s Tywin-esque black leather coronation dress with shoulder plates carries over to season 7. And one could say that through the season in terms of texture and silhouettes, her costumes through the most changes. All this while her colours of black and silver remain mostly constant with only a touch of gold peaking through some embroidery and beading. In a sense, Cersei has been wearing black in mourning since Joffrey\u2019s death in season 4, which was followed by Tywin\u2019s, Myrcella\u2019s and Tommen\u2019s later. So it\u2019s the hardening that was new, not the colour by itself, and of course the dominance of silver rather than gold.\u00a0<br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"2880\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/784703893c8aa066a24da2964a50a742/tumblr_inline_pl2smi2RMx1u48vsz_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"2880\"></figure><p> Compared to Sansa, Cersei\u2019s costumes have a far more severe look with more elaborate textures, her high collars and sharp and ostentatious accessories.

The black leather is inspired by Tywin who wore a similar jerkin like her coronation dress. Behind the perforations is a layer of brocade. Interestingly, even the other ribbed textured black leather dress references Casterly Rock in its elements looking like rocks and being slightly coated with gold and burgundy but this can go unnoticed.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"333\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2cfd7c8673c56940a96e56cb601f03b8/tumblr_inline_ppmvw9FoFe1u48vsz_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"333\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><p>A recurring pattern through these costumes is they all reflect light and\u00a0\u201cshine\u201d and with the inclusion of armor-like pieces through heavy embroidery and beading or metallic renditions like shoulder plates and chainmail, they attract even more attention.

Also we see her in\u00a0a black molded coat shaped like armor without any adornment while she wears a chainmail like dress underneath. More so, after she walks away and talks to Tyrion in the privacy of her room, she takes off her black coat and only wears her chainmail dress.\u00a0Generally, it\u2019s been the other way around through the season.\u00a0</p><p>But after he\u2019s gone and she confesses the truth to Jaime, she is back in one of her black dresses without any adornment. So that play of wearing the chainmail dress while Tyrion was there hinted that she was lying and putting up a front. In the scene where Jaime leaves, she also throws a black fur on, which hints winter in its true form is coming in snow to King\u2019s Landing. With Jaime gone, I imagine her armor is going to shift a bit from an outward show a bit - even if the design would again hint the price she has had to pay to get the throne.\u00a0</p><p>Given Dany\u2019s dress suits are shorter and worn over pants, they don\u2019t cover that much volume. But it\u2019s not that she doesn\u2019t have details of note and she does show off in her own way.

It looks handmade, especially up close, rather than custom made like Dany\u2019s and Cersei\u2019s costumes that have clean lines. And it\u2019s not because Sansa can\u2019t stitch better, but rather it reflects her feelings, her trauma, her change and where she is at right now. Because of this, there is still quite an intimate quality about her textures. It\u2019s not just for a show of strength like Cersei\u2019s beading and embroidery. Her stitching and quilting is for herself too.\u00a0</p><p>Dany\u2019s textures are still less rough and sharp than Cersei\u2019s. Apart from her sashes, her pleated fan-like skirt underneath is of a smoother texture as well. It\u2019s a carry over from time as queen in Meereen when she\u2019s not acting as a warrior queen but sitting the throne.

Rather it makes her look more different.

So in front of her, he\u00a0looks like a wildling and she looks too queenly in pristine white and such angular cuts while Jon looks a lot more padded with a number of stitched up pelts of different\u00a0\u201cdirty\u201d colours like the men on his team. Though what does separate him from them (and Mance) is his cross strap, which again Dany doesn\u2019t wear. It\u2019s to tie Ned\u2019s brown fur around him and is a sign of his status as king.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"407\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4f2cb8f937dda32c173c58c3601730b8/tumblr_inline_pl2gr4vCww1u48vsz_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"407\"></figure><p>Strangely because of Sansa\u2019s cross strap, belt and variety of warm dark colours, her costume complements Jon\u2019s a lot more than Dany\u2019s does - again despite the dresses having similar silhouettes. Even her grey against white, is too light a grey that she looks mostly white.\u00a0<br></p><p>Of course, Sansa looks a lot more sophisticated but still within the orbit because she wears colours of black, brown and darker greys because of the number of textures she mixes as part of quilting her dress along with her belt with leather straps criss crossing around her. While her cuts are severe too, it\u2019s important to remember her dress is fashioned after the Night\u2019s Watch armor and her shoulder tabs echo that along with the Stark men\u2019s jerkin sleeves pointing downward (unlike Dany\u2019s that point upward) so there is still more roundness to it and it increases under a cloak with furs. Dany\u2019s costume (added with a dragon) stands out too much on its own because of how finely it\u2019s done and how uncluttered it is with only one silver chain of intent. It might be designed out of a similar material but they still look at odds with each other.\u00a0</p><p>Dany\u2019s winter coat doesn\u2019t look any more complementary when Jon wears his usual costume which consists of black, browns and greys and no white and a black cloak. I\u2019m bringing up her visual dissonance with Jon because it ties into Northern politics and identity and how Dany fits or doesn\u2019t fit into all of it.\u00a0</p><p>What\u2019s interesting about this white winter coat is that it doesn\u2019t remain as it was and season 8 promotion has footage featuring Dany in a similar white winter coat but with more red and that has a loaded meaning of Targaryen \u201cfire and blood\u201d considering Clapton withheld it for 6 seasons and only started teasing it in season 7 a bit.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"2815\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/aea808df4d01f56d405e736487faf345/tumblr_inline_pl1qk909mC1u48vsz_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"2815\"></figure><p>\u201c<i>I think it\u2019s quite interesting that <b>we finally see her embracing her brother\u2019s ambition</b>,\u201d Clapton says. \u201c<b>What does that say?

The more she tries to fit in with her white fur coat in a sea of grey, blacks, browns and warm blues and with a red silk ascot that isn\u2019t how the Northern undershirt is tied, the more of an outsider she looks. Even when she wears white furs, she looks blatantly different. The white beading on white fur seems a bit much especially considering the silhouette. This again shows how much Dany is trying to merge her own identity and heritage with the Northern culture, and she\u2019s failing because they\u2019re at odds with each other - because of her actions in Westeros, her history and her heritage.\u00a0</p><p>Additionally from the EW cover, there is a hint of a red sash showing behind her winter coat. People might claim it resembles Sansa\u2019s white cloak from her wedding to Ramsay, but again, the silhouettes and even general material aren\u2019t the same as <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3sVGPVR6Ra7mnliy4eLYPg\" target=\"_blank\">@trinuviel</a> points out in their post.\u00a0A red sash on a fur coat looks quite flimsy because again the textures and silhouettes are at odds but as Clapton pointed out, it\u2019s a symbol of status and grandeur.</p><p>\u201c<i>The more she connects with her family the more she adopts them into her costume.

It\u2019s also longer, more rounded and shapely around her dress than Cersei\u2019s is. It\u2019s almost as if she has sewn the fur into her dress. Also where Cersei\u2019s is black, Sansa\u2019s is grey peppered with black, like Catelyn\u2019s. Also unlike Cersei, Sansa still wears her belt and chain necklace with her needle. Her armor is still on. It\u2019s always on.\u00a0</p><p>The cloak and furs are a big part of levelling out this severe structure and making it feel more organic at points. This is one of the reasons why Sansa\u2019s costume still looks complementary beside Jon\u2019s apart from her textures and her colours being black and dark grey complementing his black and brown a lot more than Dany\u2019s costumes.\u00a0<br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"650\" data-orig-height=\"365\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b37b72cbed62a487dfffcd5e7d5af6cf/tumblr_inline_pl1qxiujfN1u48vsz_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"650\" data-orig-height=\"365\"></figure><p>Where Sansa wore the palest blue amongst the Starks and a smaller grey fur on her cloak making her stand out and Jon wore a cream fur on his cloak in the back, they now wear grey and brown furs respectively taking after Catelyn and Ned\u2019s fur colours.\u00a0</p><p>Also silhouette wise, it hides the armor. This comes up in Littlefinger\u2019s trial, where Sansa wears her recurring grey cloak (now lined with fur on its hood) since she escaped King\u2019s Landing with his help. The way she wears it sideways is a bit like how Arya wears her cape in season 7.

Initially, I thought it was just poor designing but considering the themes I\u2019ve discovered while writing this post, I think it may be yet another symbol of her using it as her armor in a way that the grey cloak that has been used as a motif of her life as a hostage looks \u201chardened\u201d even when draped to her side because it\u2019s done in such a deliberate manner. It looks very controlled and seems like she has her walls up.

It\u2019s not about her liking these people or that she wants to be like them, but collecting arsenal slowly and after all that abuse and exploitation that still informs her arc, she\u2019s trying to piece herself back together and armor herself with everything her enemies used against her apart from her family\u2019s influence. She subverts them by adding a needle, which Clapton fashioned after Arya\u2019s, to Littlefinger\u2019s chain, by wearing her Eyrie dress feathers but using it to cover her chest and wearing it against grey rather than black and wearing bold statements of Stark iconography showing what she identifies as despite the marriages she was forced into. It\u2019s like patchwork involved in quilting, like a collage. It\u2019s not all from one place but she\u2019s still trying to place it all together. It comes from a place of defence and fear of harm that will follow more than offence that people assume. A fear of loss of agency and control. And yet, she\u2019s still not at the end of the process. So the narrative does raise the question of\u00a0\u201cWhere is she going? Does she know where she is going? Will she falter?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Even <a href=\"http://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a10353135/game-of-thrones-sansa-stark-necklace/\" target=\"_blank\">Littlefinger has influenced Sansa</a>, in a way, with the decision of how she loops and wears things. <b>She\u2019s taken a lot of knowledge from bad people, and she\u2019s hopefully going to use it to good effect one day. </b>I try to always speak to that\u2014where have they come from and what have they been through.</i>\u201d - <a href=\"https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/news/a47144/game-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton-easter-eggs/\" target=\"_blank\">Michele Clapton, Elle</a><br></p><p>She\u2019s a work in progress and she\u2019s not done with putting all the pieces together.\u00a0\u00a0<br></p><p>As I\u2019ve mentioned above the use of quilting is quite interesting interesting against Cersei\u2019s and Dany\u2019s beading. It shifts the mode of textures when she has used it in the past to express herself through recurring motifs her arc. It marks the fact that winter has come with its cold and preservation and sustenance is of utmost importance. It shifts the perception of what is necessary and what is too much as a lot of things are scaled down costume wise.\u00a0</p><p>Where Cersei\u2019s beading and use of sharp spikes is excessive, colours stand out for Dany a lot more because of red finally coming into her costume after 6 seasons and the way Clapton plays with the presence and absence of red, black, white and grey as she is the character who fluctuates the most in terms of colour in season 7.\u00a0Still her embroidery and beading, winter fur coat (that replicates dragon textures) and silky sash call a lot more attention than Sansa\u2019s costumes do - whether her fish swimming one or her Eyrie feathers one. She looks modest and conservative in comparison.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"4169\" data-orig-height=\"3809\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5f96cd512fbc56d65f6131c69fc8cc9d/tumblr_inline_pl1qswPDOW1u48vsz_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"4169\" data-orig-height=\"3809\"></figure><p>This is partly because Sansa is the most stable in terms of her colour, wearing muted dark shades of grey, black and brown, and even textures, which as Clapton says are inspired by her mother\u2019s Northern ones. This is quite noteworthy considering Clapton uses her chain with the circle and needle to represent the dilemma of\u00a0\u201cWill she falter?\u201d that she parallels against Dany\u2019s\u00a0\u201cchain of intent\u201d.\u00a0<br></p><p>But it makes sense considering she has gone through the journey of first being enamoured by and later betrayed by glamour and then using it to appease another abuser. That backfired and then it became an act of defiance and personal expression. It\u2019s about her sense of self and the loss of it.\u00a0</p><p>Ironically for being the Stark that looked the most different in pale blue and couldn\u2019t wait to leave home, after escaping Ramsay she sewed Jon and herself fur coats fashioned after Ned and Catelyn and even a deep blue dress influenced by her mother\u2019s colours and she embroidered with a huge direwolf stamped on her chest - like a Stark banner before she took back Winterfell with Jon. Now Sansa stands garbed mostly in greys embracing House Stark\u2019s colours while trying to find herself again. Now when a queen comes visiting Winterfell, she doesn\u2019t look at her with awe and excitement that she did for Cersei but apprehension and judgment for taking away the sovereignty of the North in exchange for aid. \u00a0\u00a0<br></p><p>While clothing and sewing is still a very intimate act for her that connects her to her childhood, she is finally at a point where she understands the necessity of practicality like her mother did. Now as Lady of Winterfell, she is planning sustenance through and beyond the war as well as she prepares for food and making sure people stay warm, which neither Cersei nor Dany seem concerned with. She\u2019s framed as a queen in the making. And tested for it because of the enemies had to face on a very personal level. One has to remember that before season 7, showwise Sansa didn\u2019t have the agency to be in charge of handling matters without an abuser above her. Even in season 6, it was more of battle. So she does falter and still make points about the limitations, but she\u2019s learning in a different way.\u00a0</p><p>And yet because Sansa basically hides behind an armor so no one can get to her again, people misjudge her. This armor isn\u2019t just political. It\u2019s so deeply personal. But more onto that in the next part.\u00a0</p><p>(to be continued\u2026)</p><p><b>A/N:</b> Sorry, this was long. There\u2019s just a lot of points that came up and I thought of breaking it down but I\u2019ve been having down with a constant headache for days because of a cold. Keeping it in my drafts only makes me add more stuff to it. So I thought I should get it out. I didn\u2019t cover the comparison of Sansa and Dany\u2019s chains as much as I wanted. I\u2019ll probably bring it up in my next post because it sort of extends into silhouettes in a sense.\u00a0</p>",

As Clapton mentions, there is kind of\u00a0\u201chardening\u201d resulting in their costumes looking like armors.\u00a0In such a season although there are differences to be spotted in those silhouettes, the textures and their progression through the season reveal and contextualise a lot more on their costumes.\u00a0\u00a0</p>[[MORE]]<p>Unlike Dany and Sansa whose costumes change a lot compared to season 6, Cersei\u2019s Tywin-esque black leather coronation dress with shoulder plates carries over to season 7. And one could say that through the season in terms of texture and silhouettes, her costumes through the most changes. All this while her colours of black and silver remain mostly constant with only a touch of gold peaking through some embroidery and beading. In a sense, Cersei has been wearing black in mourning since Joffrey\u2019s death in season 4, which was followed by Tywin\u2019s, Myrcella\u2019s and Tommen\u2019s later. So it\u2019s the hardening that was new, not the colour by itself, and of course the dominance of silver rather than gold.\u00a0<br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"2880\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/784703893c8aa066a24da2964a50a742/tumblr_inline_pl2smi2RMx1u48vsz_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"2880\"></figure><p> Compared to Sansa, Cersei\u2019s costumes have a far more severe look with more elaborate textures, her high collars and sharp and ostentatious accessories.

The black leather is inspired by Tywin who wore a similar jerkin like her coronation dress. Behind the perforations is a layer of brocade.

Also we see her in\u00a0a black molded coat shaped like armor without any adornment while she wears a chainmail like dress underneath. More so, after she walks away and talks to Tyrion in the privacy of her room, she takes off her black coat and only wears her chainmail dress.\u00a0Generally, it\u2019s been the other way around through the season.\u00a0</p><p>But after he\u2019s gone and she confesses the truth to Jaime, she is back in one of her black dresses without any adornment. So that play of wearing the chainmail dress while Tyrion was there hinted that she was lying and putting up a front. In the scene where Jaime leaves, she also throws a black fur on, which hints winter in its true form is coming in snow to King\u2019s Landing. With Jaime gone, I imagine her armor is going to shift a bit from an outward show a bit - even if the design would again hint the price she has had to pay to get the throne.\u00a0</p><p>Given Dany\u2019s dress suits are shorter and worn over pants, they don\u2019t cover that much volume. But it\u2019s not that she doesn\u2019t have details of note and she does show off in her own way.

It looks handmade, especially up close, rather than custom made like Dany\u2019s and Cersei\u2019s costumes that have clean lines. And it\u2019s not because Sansa can\u2019t stitch better, but rather it reflects her feelings, her trauma, her change and where she is at right now. Because of this, there is still quite an intimate quality about her textures. It\u2019s not just for a show of strength like Cersei\u2019s beading and embroidery. Her stitching and quilting is for herself too.\u00a0</p><p>Dany\u2019s textures are still less rough and sharp than Cersei\u2019s. Apart from her sashes, her pleated fan-like skirt underneath is of a smoother texture as well. It\u2019s a carry over from time as queen in Meereen when she\u2019s not acting as a warrior queen but sitting the throne. Incidentally, Cersei wears another layer under as well, but again, it\u2019s not as thin or as fine as Dany\u2019s pleated skirt.\u00a0<br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"5114\" data-orig-height=\"3398\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f1f227a8f03550ee656ebc041b1850b8/tumblr_inline_pl1qda4Hh01u48vsz_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5114\" data-orig-height=\"3398\"></figure><p>It\u2019s worth noting that Sansa doesn\u2019t have a slit that reveals another skirt underneath - despite that being part of the Northern garb.

Rather it makes her look more different. The narrow ribbed texture, lack of a belt and visible side flap of Dany\u2019s winter coat highlight their differences.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"3072\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4989dbfd6323c74e2406beeaf4de2787/tumblr_inline_pl1yzry8dS1u48vsz_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"3072\"></figure><p>Interestingly, Sansa\u2019s \u201cfish swimming\u201d dress that doesn\u2019t have a bodice with horizontal lines undercutting its otherwise vertal lines (as in her Eyrie dress) should look more similar.

Moreover, with her furs on her shoulders, the dress\u2019 armor like shoulder tabs get masked.\u00a0<br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"3072\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fd64f94f073681315f13dccd7034ecd5/tumblr_inline_pl1vzq5yUx1u48vsz_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"3072\"></figure><p>Also, the choice to not use a cloak is interesting too because once again it distances Dany from not just Sansa\u2019s look but even Jon\u2019s wildling look - even when the colours are geared towards him.\u00a0It\u2019s fashioned out of Mance\u2019s coat of pelts that Jon\u2019s costume is inspired by on the mission and yet there\u2019s so much amiss about it.\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cLater, Dany\u2019s white fur coat also shows another connection to Northern people. \u201cI took reference from the Wildlings\u2019 attire, particularly the coat that is worn by Jon Snow which was in turn influenced by Mance Rayder,\u201d Clapton said. \u201c<b>I wanted to define Dany\u2019s shape by cutting into and shaping the fur.</b> Also, I was keen to create <b>a warrior look, a thing of beauty</b>.</i>\u201d - <a href=\"https://www.huffpostbrasil.com/entry/game-of-thrones-costume-designer-explains-danys-meaningful-outfits_us_59a4319fe4b06d67e33926b6?ec_carp=8265756527327536922\" target=\"_blank\">Huffpost</a></p><p>As pointed out before, her silhouette is defined by Viserys in this costume and it shows as she sports the side flap that characterises the Targaryen style, that she also wears the Field of Fire 2.0. Moreover, with her platinum blonde hair, she looks too white. So in front of her, he\u00a0looks like a wildling and she looks too queenly in pristine white and such angular cuts while Jon looks a lot more padded with a number of stitched up pelts of different\u00a0\u201cdirty\u201d colours like the men on his team. Though what does separate him from them (and Mance) is his cross strap, which again Dany doesn\u2019t wear. It\u2019s to tie Ned\u2019s brown fur around him and is a sign of his status as king.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"407\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4f2cb8f937dda32c173c58c3601730b8/tumblr_inline_pl2gr4vCww1u48vsz_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"407\"></figure><p>Strangely because of Sansa\u2019s cross strap, belt and variety of warm dark colours, her costume complements Jon\u2019s a lot more than Dany\u2019s does - again despite the dresses having similar silhouettes. Even her grey against white, is too light a grey that she looks mostly white.\u00a0<br></p><p>Of course, Sansa looks a lot more sophisticated but still within the orbit because she wears colours of black, brown and darker greys because of the number of textures she mixes as part of quilting her dress along with her belt with leather straps criss crossing around her. While her cuts are severe too, it\u2019s important to remember her dress is fashioned after the Night\u2019s Watch armor and her shoulder tabs echo that along with the Stark men\u2019s jerkin sleeves pointing downward (unlike Dany\u2019s that point upward) so there is still more roundness to it and it increases under a cloak with furs. Dany\u2019s costume (added with a dragon) stands out too much on its own because of how finely it\u2019s done and how uncluttered it is with only one silver chain of intent. It might be designed out of a similar material but they still look at odds with each other.\u00a0</p><p>Dany\u2019s winter coat doesn\u2019t look any more complementary when Jon wears his usual costume which consists of black, browns and greys and no white and a black cloak. I\u2019m bringing up her visual dissonance with Jon because it ties into Northern politics and identity and how Dany fits or doesn\u2019t fit into all of it.\u00a0</p><p>What\u2019s interesting about this white winter coat is that it doesn\u2019t remain as it was and season 8 promotion has footage featuring Dany in a similar white winter coat but with more red and that has a loaded meaning of Targaryen \u201cfire and blood\u201d considering Clapton withheld it for 6 seasons and only started teasing it in season 7 a bit.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"2815\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/aea808df4d01f56d405e736487faf345/tumblr_inline_pl1qk909mC1u48vsz_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5120\" data-orig-height=\"2815\"></figure><p>\u201c<i>I think it\u2019s quite interesting that <b>we finally see her embracing her brother\u2019s ambition</b>,\u201d Clapton says. \u201c<b>What does that say?

Red starts replacing the grey in her 7x06 winter coat and as we know grey is House Stark\u2019s colour and the ribbed texture becomes even more pronounced with red linings between those layers of white fur. Her sleeves look like the silhouette of webbed wings like dragon\u2019s but also look like red bleeding into white.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"442\" data-orig-height=\"277\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ae8948033b063dae76e2d439521ee249/tumblr_inline_pl1ql8UHZT1u48vsz_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"442\" data-orig-height=\"277\"></figure><p>The scale-like beading comes back again in her season 8 costume similar to her 7x01 costume, except in white this time, which is an interesting choice since the receding of it pronounced Cersei\u2019s heavy beading even more, just as the neutralising of colour across the board emphasized the red creeping into Dany\u2019s costumes.\u00a0</p><p>As <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3sVGPVR6Ra7mnliy4eLYPg\" target=\"_blank\">@trinuviel</a> has <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/181842464629/a-bad-fit-some-thoughts-on-daenerys\" target=\"_blank\">written</a>, Dany costume shows how Dany\u2019s desire to win their approval. The more she tries to fit in with her white fur coat in a sea of grey, blacks, browns and warm blues and with a red silk ascot that isn\u2019t how the Northern undershirt is tied, the more of an outsider she looks. Even when she wears white furs, she looks blatantly different. The white beading on white fur seems a bit much especially considering the silhouette. This again shows how much Dany is trying to merge her own identity and heritage with the Northern culture, and she\u2019s failing because they\u2019re at odds with each other - because of her actions in Westeros, her history and her heritage.\u00a0</p><p>Additionally from the EW cover, there is a hint of a red sash showing behind her winter coat. People might claim it resembles Sansa\u2019s white cloak from her wedding to Ramsay, but again, the silhouettes and even general material aren\u2019t the same as <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3sVGPVR6Ra7mnliy4eLYPg\" target=\"_blank\">@trinuviel</a> points out in their post.\u00a0A red sash on a fur coat looks quite flimsy because again the textures and silhouettes are at odds but as Clapton pointed out, it\u2019s a symbol of status and grandeur.</p><p>\u201c<i>The more she connects with her family the more she adopts them into her costume.

It\u2019s also longer, more rounded and shapely around her dress than Cersei\u2019s is. It\u2019s almost as if she has sewn the fur into her dress. Also where Cersei\u2019s is black, Sansa\u2019s is grey peppered with black, like Catelyn\u2019s. Also unlike Cersei, Sansa still wears her belt and chain necklace with her needle. Her armor is still on. It\u2019s always on.\u00a0</p><p>The cloak and furs are a big part of levelling out this severe structure and making it feel more organic at points. This is one of the reasons why Sansa\u2019s costume still looks complementary beside Jon\u2019s apart from her textures and her colours being black and dark grey complementing his black and brown a lot more than Dany\u2019s costumes.\u00a0<br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"650\" data-orig-height=\"365\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b37b72cbed62a487dfffcd5e7d5af6cf/tumblr_inline_pl1qxiujfN1u48vsz_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"650\" data-orig-height=\"365\"></figure><p>Where Sansa wore the palest blue amongst the Starks and a smaller grey fur on her cloak making her stand out and Jon wore a cream fur on his cloak in the back, they now wear grey and brown furs respectively taking after Catelyn and Ned\u2019s fur colours.\u00a0</p><p>Also silhouette wise, it hides the armor. This comes up in Littlefinger\u2019s trial, where Sansa wears her recurring grey cloak (now lined with fur on its hood) since she escaped King\u2019s Landing with his help.

It looks very controlled and seems like she has her walls up.

It\u2019s not about her liking these people or that she wants to be like them, but collecting arsenal slowly and after all that abuse and exploitation that still informs her arc, she\u2019s trying to piece herself back together and armor herself with everything her enemies used against her apart from her family\u2019s influence. She subverts them by adding a needle, which Clapton fashioned after Arya\u2019s, to Littlefinger\u2019s chain, by wearing her Eyrie dress feathers but using it to cover her chest and wearing it against grey rather than black and wearing bold statements of Stark iconography showing what she identifies as despite the marriages she was forced into. It\u2019s like patchwork involved in quilting, like a collage. It\u2019s not all from one place but she\u2019s still trying to place it all together. It comes from a place of defence and fear of harm that will follow more than offence that people assume. A fear of loss of agency and control. And yet, she\u2019s still not at the end of the process. So the narrative does raise the question of\u00a0\u201cWhere is she going? Does she know where she is going?

It shifts the mode of textures when she has used it in the past to express herself through recurring motifs her arc. It marks the fact that winter has come with its cold and preservation and sustenance is of utmost importance. It shifts the perception of what is necessary and what is too much as a lot of things are scaled down costume wise.\u00a0</p><p>Where Cersei\u2019s beading and use of sharp spikes is excessive, colours stand out for Dany a lot more because of red finally coming into her costume after 6 seasons and the way Clapton plays with the presence and absence of red, black, white and grey as she is the character who fluctuates the most in terms of colour in season 7.\u00a0Still her embroidery and beading, winter fur coat (that replicates dragon textures) and silky sash call a lot more attention than Sansa\u2019s costumes do - whether her fish swimming one or her Eyrie feathers one. She looks modest and conservative in comparison.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"4169\" data-orig-height=\"3809\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5f96cd512fbc56d65f6131c69fc8cc9d/tumblr_inline_pl1qswPDOW1u48vsz_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"4169\" data-orig-height=\"3809\"></figure><p>This is partly because Sansa is the most stable in terms of her colour, wearing muted dark shades of grey, black and brown, and even textures, which as Clapton says are inspired by her mother\u2019s Northern ones. This is quite noteworthy considering Clapton uses her chain with the circle and needle to represent the dilemma of\u00a0\u201cWill she falter?\u201d that she parallels against Dany\u2019s\u00a0\u201cchain of intent\u201d.\u00a0<br></p><p>But it makes sense considering she has gone through the journey of first being enamoured by and later betrayed by glamour and then using it to appease another abuser. That backfired and then it became an act of defiance and personal expression. It\u2019s about her sense of self and the loss of it.\u00a0</p><p>Ironically for being the Stark that looked the most different in pale blue and couldn\u2019t wait to leave home, after escaping Ramsay she sewed Jon and herself fur coats fashioned after Ned and Catelyn and even a deep blue dress influenced by her mother\u2019s colours and she embroidered with a huge direwolf stamped on her chest - like a Stark banner before she took back Winterfell with Jon. Now Sansa stands garbed mostly in greys embracing House Stark\u2019s colours while trying to find herself again. Now when a queen comes visiting Winterfell, she doesn\u2019t look at her with awe and excitement that she did for Cersei but apprehension and judgment for taking away the sovereignty of the North in exchange for aid. \u00a0\u00a0<br></p><p>While clothing and sewing is still a very intimate act for her that connects her to her childhood, she is finally at a point where she understands the necessity of practicality like her mother did. Now as Lady of Winterfell, she is planning sustenance through and beyond the war as well as she prepares for food and making sure people stay warm, which neither Cersei nor Dany seem concerned with. She\u2019s framed as a queen in the making. And tested for it because of the enemies had to face on a very personal level. One has to remember that before season 7, showwise Sansa didn\u2019t have the agency to be in charge of handling matters without an abuser above her. Even in season 6, it was more of battle. So she does falter and still make points about the limitations, but she\u2019s learning in a different way.\u00a0</p><p>And yet because Sansa basically hides behind an armor so no one can get to her again, people misjudge her. This armor isn\u2019t just political. It\u2019s so deeply personal. But more onto that in the next part.\u00a0</p><p>(to be continued\u2026)</p><p><b>A/N:</b> Sorry, this was long. There\u2019s just a lot of points that came up and I thought of breaking it down but I\u2019ve been having down with a constant headache for days because of a cold.

As Clapton mentions, there is kind of&nbsp;&ldquo;hardening&rdquo; resulting in their costumes looking like armors.&nbsp;In such a season although there are differences to be spotted in those silhouettes, the textures and their progression through the season reveal and contextualise a lot more on their costumes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike Dany and Sansa whose costumes change a lot compared to season 6, Cersei&rsquo;s Tywin-esque black leather coronation dress with shoulder plates carries over to season 7. And one could say that through the season in terms of texture and silhouettes, her costumes through the most changes. All this while her colours of black and silver remain mostly constant with only a touch of gold peaking through some embroidery and beading. In a sense, Cersei has been wearing black in mourning since Joffrey&rsquo;s death in season 4, which was followed by Tywin&rsquo;s, Myrcella&rsquo;s and Tommen&rsquo;s later. So it&rsquo;s the hardening that was new, not the colour by itself, and of course the dominance of silver rather than gold.&nbsp;<br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/784703893c8aa066a24da2964a50a742/tumblr_inline_pl2smi2RMx1u48vsz_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p> Compared to Sansa, Cersei&rsquo;s costumes have a far more severe look with more elaborate textures, her high collars and sharp and ostentatious accessories. It&rsquo;s all rather over the top. She wears leather (perforated or bumpy), silk, textured wool, metal and very narrow ribbed patterns. The black leather is inspired by Tywin who wore a similar jerkin like her coronation dress. Behind the perforations is a layer of brocade. Interestingly, even the other ribbed textured black leather dress references Casterly Rock in its elements looking like rocks and being slightly coated with gold and burgundy but this can go unnoticed.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2cfd7c8673c56940a96e56cb601f03b8/tumblr_inline_ppmvw9FoFe1u48vsz_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>A recurring pattern through these costumes is they all reflect light and&nbsp;&ldquo;shine&rdquo; and with the inclusion of armor-like pieces through heavy embroidery and beading or metallic renditions like shoulder plates and chainmail, they attract even more attention.

More so, after she walks away and talks to Tyrion in the privacy of her room, she takes off her black coat and only wears her chainmail dress.&nbsp;Generally, it&rsquo;s been the other way around through the season.&nbsp;</p><p>But after he&rsquo;s gone and she confesses the truth to Jaime, she is back in one of her black dresses without any adornment. So that play of wearing the chainmail dress while Tyrion was there hinted that she was lying and putting up a front. In the scene where Jaime leaves, she also throws a black fur on, which hints winter in its true form is coming in snow to King&rsquo;s Landing. With Jaime gone, I imagine her armor is going to shift a bit from an outward show a bit - even if the design would again hint the price she has had to pay to get the throne.&nbsp;</p><p>Given Dany&rsquo;s dress suits are shorter and worn over pants, they don&rsquo;t cover that much volume. But it&rsquo;s not that she doesn&rsquo;t have details of note and she does show off in her own way. A pattern that continues through the season is how red slowly keeps creeping up in her costumes - even after they recede.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/cedf6a41eb7dd91289ec959ed2234d7e/tumblr_inline_pl1q4iwOl21u48vsz_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><i>&ldquo;With Daenerys, there&rsquo;s a creeping of red within the scaling embroidery of her coat.

However, her silver &ldquo;chain of intent&rdquo; stays.&nbsp;This highlights Cersei&rsquo;s beading and its symbolism of her brittleness as even Sansa moves away from it. Instead, Dany takes on a new dark grey side laced winter coat with cream coloured fur lining in the Field of Fire 2.0. The patterned texture on it is subtly bit scale like. Then she wears white and grey ribbed and quilted version of it for the wighthunt. In season 8, this white coat seems to take on more red lining in its ridges. You can see the progression of these costumes leading into one another.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/65905848cf2b7cc7a03eaa3a79ef5faa/tumblr_inline_pl1q7xLJwC1u48vsz_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>She also wears her pleated and scale-like red silk sash on her dresses on ceremonial occasions, like bidding Jorah and Jon goodbye and the Dragonpit meeting apart from meeting Jon in the throne room. The contrast between the silky pleated red sash against the rough ridge like textured dress coats also makes the red stand out even more.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/328e189d4428e577daeaf0c8829c9ad7/tumblr_inline_pl1qazvTlI1u48vsz_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>All her fabrics after she arrives at Dragonstone have reptilian/ridge like textures that evokes hints of dragon-like leathery textures.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d16bbdebc1e6112cb3c96e397d67ba34/tumblr_inline_pl1qcj5fBA1u48vsz_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>It&rsquo;s interesting to think about how given Clapton includes quite a bit of fish and bird/dragonfly/butterfly iconography in Sansa&rsquo;s costumes, both she and Dany somewhat have scale-like and wing-like iconography drawing from different animals. But where Dany is drawing from one animal at this point, Sansa does so from more than one - including wolves.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3054192caa09b479b77973965f39e9fc/tumblr_inline_pl291eneRv1u48vsz_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>When you compare both their textures, Sansa&rsquo;s is deliberately more rugged around the edges to create the impression of white fur on the hems of cloth strips quilted on her. So while those feathers can look like (fish) scales in an armor, they can also look like fur trimmings.&nbsp;This gets more pronounced when seen beside Dany and Cersei who have more refined textures.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/074a85d6add6b051b3f67ed49421acf9/tumblr_inline_pl29258fjA1u48vsz_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Also where a lot of Dany&rsquo;s and Cersei&rsquo;s fabric and embellishment is symmetrical and Sansa&rsquo;s is too, hers is a bit more earthy. Take her stitching on the vertical lines of the Eyrie dress. It looks like a clean stitch from afar but up close, they look more like vine branches or thorns or maybe they&rsquo;re even representative of lacing again.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a9bce638e9335802fef72514384c1bd4/tumblr_inline_pl2bycaUDH1u48vsz_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>When Clapton talked about thinking about Sansa&rsquo;s frustration, I could see how these lines are were used to express that.&nbsp;Her Eyrie dress is completely deconstructed and is reconstructed considering her disdain for Littlefinger while also using him as an ally they need.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Her minimised and orderly dress cut is contrasted by these stitching lines or the cloth strips&rsquo; roughened hems or the feathers being a bit disarray. It looks handmade, especially up close, rather than custom made like Dany&rsquo;s and Cersei&rsquo;s costumes that have clean lines. And it&rsquo;s not because Sansa can&rsquo;t stitch better, but rather it reflects her feelings, her trauma, her change and where she is at right now. Because of this, there is still quite an intimate quality about her textures. It&rsquo;s not just for a show of strength like Cersei&rsquo;s beading and embroidery. Her stitching and quilting is for herself too.&nbsp;</p><p>Dany&rsquo;s textures are still less rough and sharp than Cersei&rsquo;s. Apart from her sashes, her pleated fan-like skirt underneath is of a smoother texture as well. It&rsquo;s a carry over from time as queen in Meereen when she&rsquo;s not acting as a warrior queen but sitting the throne. Incidentally, Cersei wears another layer under as well, but again, it&rsquo;s not as thin or as fine as Dany&rsquo;s pleated skirt.&nbsp;<br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f1f227a8f03550ee656ebc041b1850b8/tumblr_inline_pl1qda4Hh01u48vsz_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that Sansa doesn&rsquo;t have a slit that reveals another skirt underneath - despite that being part of the Northern garb. It&rsquo;s another part of &ldquo;binding herself against vulnerability&rdquo;. Like Sansa, Dany&rsquo;s armor is a fundamental part of every costume and she isn&rsquo;t shown taking off her armored layer and wearing a simpler layer by itself.&nbsp;Even so, Dany&rsquo;s bodice is a lot more armoured from within than Sansa. Dany is a military leader after all.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>You can see in the way [Dany is] dressing that <b>she&rsquo;s almost assuming the power but not quite</b>. With <b>all the colors and the details and the essence </b>&mdash; <b>it just becomes stronger</b>. The width of the shoulders give her strength, the chain gives her strength. I tried to make the <b>cut of the costumes just slightly more like a uniform</b> and almost less feminine.

But she also hints that Cersei&rsquo;s Dragonpit look suggests a departure from them paralleling visually. Analysing the visually paralleling chains would take a post of its own, so I&rsquo;ll save that for later.&nbsp;</p><p>But despite their similar silhouettes, Dany&rsquo;s use of fur on her doesn&rsquo;t make her look more similar to Sansa. Rather it makes her look more different. The narrow ribbed texture, lack of a belt and visible side flap of Dany&rsquo;s winter coat highlight their differences.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4989dbfd6323c74e2406beeaf4de2787/tumblr_inline_pl1yzry8dS1u48vsz_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Interestingly, Sansa&rsquo;s &ldquo;fish swimming&rdquo; dress that doesn&rsquo;t have a bodice with horizontal lines undercutting its otherwise vertal lines (as in her Eyrie dress) should look more similar. But what undercuts it is the variety of textures (and complementary ones at that) and muted shades that Sansa wears and her tight lacing that masks their similarities. Moreover, with her furs on her shoulders, the dress&rsquo; armor like shoulder tabs get masked.&nbsp;<br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fd64f94f073681315f13dccd7034ecd5/tumblr_inline_pl1vzq5yUx1u48vsz_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Also, the choice to not use a cloak is interesting too because once again it distances Dany from not just Sansa&rsquo;s look but even Jon&rsquo;s wildling look - even when the colours are geared towards him.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s fashioned out of Mance&rsquo;s coat of pelts that Jon&rsquo;s costume is inspired by on the mission and yet there&rsquo;s so much amiss about it.&nbsp;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Later, Dany&rsquo;s white fur coat also shows another connection to Northern people. &ldquo;I took reference from the Wildlings&rsquo; attire, particularly the coat that is worn by Jon Snow which was in turn influenced by Mance Rayder,&rdquo; Clapton said. &ldquo;<b>I wanted to define Dany&rsquo;s shape by cutting into and shaping the fur.</b> Also, I was keen to create <b>a warrior look, a thing of beauty</b>.</i>&rdquo; - <a href=\"https://www.huffpostbrasil.com/entry/game-of-thrones-costume-designer-explains-danys-meaningful-outfits_us_59a4319fe4b06d67e33926b6?ec_carp=8265756527327536922\" target=\"_blank\">Huffpost</a></p><p>As pointed out before, her silhouette is defined by Viserys in this costume and it shows as she sports the side flap that characterises the Targaryen style, that she also wears the Field of Fire 2.0.

So in front of her, he&nbsp;looks like a wildling and she looks too queenly in pristine white and such angular cuts while Jon looks a lot more padded with a number of stitched up pelts of different&nbsp;&ldquo;dirty&rdquo; colours like the men on his team. Though what does separate him from them (and Mance) is his cross strap, which again Dany doesn&rsquo;t wear. It&rsquo;s to tie Ned&rsquo;s brown fur around him and is a sign of his status as king.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4f2cb8f937dda32c173c58c3601730b8/tumblr_inline_pl2gr4vCww1u48vsz_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Strangely because of Sansa&rsquo;s cross strap, belt and variety of warm dark colours, her costume complements Jon&rsquo;s a lot more than Dany&rsquo;s does - again despite the dresses having similar silhouettes. Even her grey against white, is too light a grey that she looks mostly white.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Of course, Sansa looks a lot more sophisticated but still within the orbit because she wears colours of black, brown and darker greys because of the number of textures she mixes as part of quilting her dress along with her belt with leather straps criss crossing around her. While her cuts are severe too, it&rsquo;s important to remember her dress is fashioned after the Night&rsquo;s Watch armor and her shoulder tabs echo that along with the Stark men&rsquo;s jerkin sleeves pointing downward (unlike Dany&rsquo;s that point upward) so there is still more roundness to it and it increases under a cloak with furs. Dany&rsquo;s costume (added with a dragon) stands out too much on its own because of how finely it&rsquo;s done and how uncluttered it is with only one silver chain of intent. It might be designed out of a similar material but they still look at odds with each other.&nbsp;</p><p>Dany&rsquo;s winter coat doesn&rsquo;t look any more complementary when Jon wears his usual costume which consists of black, browns and greys and no white and a black cloak. I&rsquo;m bringing up her visual dissonance with Jon because it ties into Northern politics and identity and how Dany fits or doesn&rsquo;t fit into all of it.&nbsp;</p><p>What&rsquo;s interesting about this white winter coat is that it doesn&rsquo;t remain as it was and season 8 promotion has footage featuring Dany in a similar white winter coat but with more red and that has a loaded meaning of Targaryen &ldquo;fire and blood&rdquo; considering Clapton withheld it for 6 seasons and only started teasing it in season 7 a bit.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/aea808df4d01f56d405e736487faf345/tumblr_inline_pl1qk909mC1u48vsz_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>&ldquo;<i>I think it&rsquo;s quite interesting that <b>we finally see her embracing her brother&rsquo;s ambition</b>,&rdquo; Clapton says. &ldquo;<b>What does that say?

Her sleeves look like the silhouette of webbed wings like dragon&rsquo;s but also look like red bleeding into white.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ae8948033b063dae76e2d439521ee249/tumblr_inline_pl1ql8UHZT1u48vsz_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>The scale-like beading comes back again in her season 8 costume similar to her 7x01 costume, except in white this time, which is an interesting choice since the receding of it pronounced Cersei&rsquo;s heavy beading even more, just as the neutralising of colour across the board emphasized the red creeping into Dany&rsquo;s costumes.&nbsp;</p><p>As <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3sVGPVR6Ra7mnliy4eLYPg\" target=\"_blank\">@trinuviel</a> has <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/181842464629/a-bad-fit-some-thoughts-on-daenerys\" target=\"_blank\">written</a>, Dany costume shows how Dany&rsquo;s desire to win their approval. The more she tries to fit in with her white fur coat in a sea of grey, blacks, browns and warm blues and with a red silk ascot that isn&rsquo;t how the Northern undershirt is tied, the more of an outsider she looks. Even when she wears white furs, she looks blatantly different. The white beading on white fur seems a bit much especially considering the silhouette. This again shows how much Dany is trying to merge her own identity and heritage with the Northern culture, and she&rsquo;s failing because they&rsquo;re at odds with each other - because of her actions in Westeros, her history and her heritage.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally from the EW cover, there is a hint of a red sash showing behind her winter coat. People might claim it resembles Sansa&rsquo;s white cloak from her wedding to Ramsay, but again, the silhouettes and even general material aren&rsquo;t the same as <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3sVGPVR6Ra7mnliy4eLYPg\" target=\"_blank\">@trinuviel</a> points out in their post.&nbsp;A red sash on a fur coat looks quite flimsy because again the textures and silhouettes are at odds but as Clapton pointed out, it&rsquo;s a symbol of status and grandeur.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>The more she connects with her family the more she adopts them into her costume.

At the Dragonpit, she wears a black molded coat with short sleeves. The shoulders look armored in how they&rsquo;re structured.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/42c6a10a2dcf97505831f460ee73a063/tumblr_inline_pl3xv7X0N31u48vsz_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>That said does wear a black fur on her shoulders.

It&rsquo;s also longer, more rounded and shapely around her dress than Cersei&rsquo;s is. It&rsquo;s almost as if she has sewn the fur into her dress. Also where Cersei&rsquo;s is black, Sansa&rsquo;s is grey peppered with black, like Catelyn&rsquo;s. Also unlike Cersei, Sansa still wears her belt and chain necklace with her needle. Her armor is still on. It&rsquo;s always on.&nbsp;</p><p>The cloak and furs are a big part of levelling out this severe structure and making it feel more organic at points. This is one of the reasons why Sansa&rsquo;s costume still looks complementary beside Jon&rsquo;s apart from her textures and her colours being black and dark grey complementing his black and brown a lot more than Dany&rsquo;s costumes.&nbsp;<br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b37b72cbed62a487dfffcd5e7d5af6cf/tumblr_inline_pl1qxiujfN1u48vsz_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Where Sansa wore the palest blue amongst the Starks and a smaller grey fur on her cloak making her stand out and Jon wore a cream fur on his cloak in the back, they now wear grey and brown furs respectively taking after Catelyn and Ned&rsquo;s fur colours.&nbsp;</p><p>Also silhouette wise, it hides the armor. This comes up in Littlefinger&rsquo;s trial, where Sansa wears her recurring grey cloak (now lined with fur on its hood) since she escaped King&rsquo;s Landing with his help. The way she wears it sideways is a bit like how Arya wears her cape in season 7. Under it, she also wears her dress with Eyrie feathers as she passes the judgment of his execution.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f4068c77c3d16c73a6e00d3ad3755915/tumblr_inline_plsuv3N2gh1u48vsz_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>[<b>Edit:</b> I&rsquo;ve thought about how this grey cloak looks a bit misfitted in how it covers Sansa&rsquo;s neck in Littlefinger&rsquo;s trial as she wears it to her side. Initially, I thought it was just poor designing but considering the themes I&rsquo;ve discovered while writing this post, I think it may be yet another symbol of her using it as her armor in a way that the grey cloak that has been used as a motif of her life as a hostage looks &ldquo;hardened&rdquo; even when draped to her side because it&rsquo;s done in such a deliberate manner. It looks very controlled and seems like she has her walls up. Even after we see Sansa and Arya reconciling on the battlements, we don&rsquo;t see them closing the distance between them as Jon did with Sansa in season 6 finale. Sansa isn&rsquo;t free yet, because her demons go much further than physical ones.]</p><p>Dany and Cersei forgo this throughout, while Sansa only took off her cloak when Jon was still in Winterfell and even then, not always.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Clapton noted that Sansa&rsquo;s (Sophie Turner) costumes contained <b>subtle references to her history, as well</b>. <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bow-down-sansa-stark-is-finally-a-player-in-the-game-of-thrones_us_596cf8cae4b0e983c0580cbf\" target=\"_blank\">After winning back Winterfell from her abusive husband and his army</a>,&nbsp;Sansa&rsquo;s stiff, black <b>dress-and-cloak combinations have reflected &ldquo;an idea of being wrapped, a sense of security, laced in, protected,</b>&rdquo; the costumer explained.</i>&nbsp;<i>The cut of the costume was very fitted and severe but the <b>fabrics were soft, textured and quilted</b>.

It shows most when she is put against Littlefinger who is dressed all in black - albeit with golden silks underneath.)</p><p>People jumped all over these references, but there&rsquo;s context to consider. It&rsquo;s not about her liking these people or that she wants to be like them, but collecting arsenal slowly and after all that abuse and exploitation that still informs her arc, she&rsquo;s trying to piece herself back together and armor herself with everything her enemies used against her apart from her family&rsquo;s influence. She subverts them by adding a needle, which Clapton fashioned after Arya&rsquo;s, to Littlefinger&rsquo;s chain, by wearing her Eyrie dress feathers but using it to cover her chest and wearing it against grey rather than black and wearing bold statements of Stark iconography showing what she identifies as despite the marriages she was forced into. It&rsquo;s like patchwork involved in quilting, like a collage. It&rsquo;s not all from one place but she&rsquo;s still trying to place it all together. It comes from a place of defence and fear of harm that will follow more than offence that people assume. A fear of loss of agency and control. And yet, she&rsquo;s still not at the end of the process. So the narrative does raise the question of&nbsp;&ldquo;Where is she going? Does she know where she is going? Will she falter?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Even <a href=\"http://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a10353135/game-of-thrones-sansa-stark-necklace/\" target=\"_blank\">Littlefinger has influenced Sansa</a>, in a way, with the decision of how she loops and wears things. <b>She&rsquo;s taken a lot of knowledge from bad people, and she&rsquo;s hopefully going to use it to good effect one day. </b>I try to always speak to that&mdash;where have they come from and what have they been through.</i>&rdquo; - <a href=\"https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/news/a47144/game-of-thrones-costume-designer-michele-clapton-easter-eggs/\" target=\"_blank\">Michele Clapton, Elle</a><br /></p><p>She&rsquo;s a work in progress and she&rsquo;s not done with putting all the pieces together.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>As I&rsquo;ve mentioned above the use of quilting is quite interesting interesting against Cersei&rsquo;s and Dany&rsquo;s beading. It shifts the mode of textures when she has used it in the past to express herself through recurring motifs her arc. It marks the fact that winter has come with its cold and preservation and sustenance is of utmost importance. It shifts the perception of what is necessary and what is too much as a lot of things are scaled down costume wise.&nbsp;</p><p>Where Cersei&rsquo;s beading and use of sharp spikes is excessive, colours stand out for Dany a lot more because of red finally coming into her costume after 6 seasons and the way Clapton plays with the presence and absence of red, black, white and grey as she is the character who fluctuates the most in terms of colour in season 7.&nbsp;Still her embroidery and beading, winter fur coat (that replicates dragon textures) and silky sash call a lot more attention than Sansa&rsquo;s costumes do - whether her fish swimming one or her Eyrie feathers one. She looks modest and conservative in comparison.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5f96cd512fbc56d65f6131c69fc8cc9d/tumblr_inline_pl1qswPDOW1u48vsz_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>This is partly because Sansa is the most stable in terms of her colour, wearing muted dark shades of grey, black and brown, and even textures, which as Clapton says are inspired by her mother&rsquo;s Northern ones. This is quite noteworthy considering Clapton uses her chain with the circle and needle to represent the dilemma of&nbsp;&ldquo;Will she falter?&rdquo; that she parallels against Dany&rsquo;s&nbsp;&ldquo;chain of intent&rdquo;.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>But it makes sense considering she has gone through the journey of first being enamoured by and later betrayed by glamour and then using it to appease another abuser. That backfired and then it became an act of defiance and personal expression. It&rsquo;s about her sense of self and the loss of it.&nbsp;</p><p>Ironically for being the Stark that looked the most different in pale blue and couldn&rsquo;t wait to leave home, after escaping Ramsay she sewed Jon and herself fur coats fashioned after Ned and Catelyn and even a deep blue dress influenced by her mother&rsquo;s colours and she embroidered with a huge direwolf stamped on her chest - like a Stark banner before she took back Winterfell with Jon. Now Sansa stands garbed mostly in greys embracing House Stark&rsquo;s colours while trying to find herself again. Now when a queen comes visiting Winterfell, she doesn&rsquo;t look at her with awe and excitement that she did for Cersei but apprehension and judgment for taking away the sovereignty of the North in exchange for aid. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>While clothing and sewing is still a very intimate act for her that connects her to her childhood, she is finally at a point where she understands the necessity of practicality like her mother did. Now as Lady of Winterfell, she is planning sustenance through and beyond the war as well as she prepares for food and making sure people stay warm, which neither Cersei nor Dany seem concerned with. She&rsquo;s framed as a queen in the making. And tested for it because of the enemies had to face on a very personal level. One has to remember that before season 7, showwise Sansa didn&rsquo;t have the agency to be in charge of handling matters without an abuser above her. Even in season 6, it was more of battle. So she does falter and still make points about the limitations, but she&rsquo;s learning in a different way.&nbsp;</p><p>And yet because Sansa basically hides behind an armor so no one can get to her again, people misjudge her. This armor isn&rsquo;t just political. It&rsquo;s so deeply personal. But more onto that in the next part.&nbsp;</p><p>(to be continued&hellip;)</p><p><b>A/N:</b> Sorry, this was long. There&rsquo;s just a lot of points that came up and I thought of breaking it down but I&rsquo;ve been having down with a constant headache for days because of a cold. Keeping it in my drafts only makes me add more stuff to it. So I thought I should get it out. I didn&rsquo;t cover the comparison of Sansa and Dany&rsquo;s chains as much as I wanted. I&rsquo;ll probably bring it up in my next post because it sort of extends into silhouettes in a sense.&nbsp;</p>",
