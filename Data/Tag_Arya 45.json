I just recently heard about Billie Eilish and am now obsessed with her and her music. Now, does this song really need an explanation as to why I added it to my playlist? I think not, but I\u2019m gonna give you one anyway. </p><p>If you are a Gendrya shipper (like me), then you know what color Gendry\u2019s eyes are&hellip;BLUE! Obvi, there have been mentions of his blue eyes as oceans in the books and tv shows (and almost every fanfic I have read). Now, I don\u2019t know if Eilish is referring to blue eyes in her song, but I\u2019m just gonna pretend that she is. </p><p>Okay, so I didn\u2019t just choose this song because it refers to blue eyes, I also chose it because I feel like it represents how Arya feels about Gendry. Hear me out. In Eilish\u2019s song, she sings \u201cI\u2019m scared\u201d and I truly believe that Arya is scared to be in love with Gendry and to live. She is scared of happiness because she hasn\u2019t had a lot of that. Gendry is life to her and that terrifies her. </p><p>Then there is a part in the song when she talks about the diamond mind, if you read the whole section of that part of the song, like the friendship that Arya and Gendry has before the dives into the relationship just speaks volumes! It\u2019s like she never has experienced anything like him and it just gives me feels!! </p><p>Anyway, tell me what you think and if you agree or not! I may put song #3 later today or tomorrow&hellip;don\u2019t know yet! </p><figure data-npf='{\"type\":\"audio\",\"provider\":\"spotify\",\"url\":\"https://open.spotify.com/track/7hDVYcQq6MxkdJGweuCtl9\",\"title\":\"ocean eyes\",\"artist\":\"Billie Eilish\",\"album\":\"dont smile at me\",\"poster\":[{\"url\":\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0ec10e2d8cbfba6c48714c57919b87e6/tumblr_prii5buXYD1r7zx88_540.jpg\",\"type\":\"image/jpeg\",\"width\":640,\"height\":640}],\"attribution\":{\"type\":\"app\",\"url\":\"https://open.spotify.com/track/7hDVYcQq6MxkdJGweuCtl9\",\"app_name\":\"spotify\",\"display_text\":\"Listen on Spotify\"}}'><iframe class=\"spotify_audio_player\" src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.spotify.com%2Ftrack%2F7hDVYcQq6MxkdJGweuCtl9&amp;view=coverart\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"500\" height=\"580\"></iframe></figure>",

I may put song #3 later today or tomorrow&hellip;don&rsquo;t know yet! </p><figure data-npf=\"{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;audio&quot;,&quot;provider&quot;:&quot;spotify&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/7hDVYcQq6MxkdJGweuCtl9&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;ocean eyes&quot;,&quot;artist&quot;:&quot;Billie Eilish&quot;,&quot;album&quot;:&quot;dont smile at me&quot;,&quot;poster&quot;:[{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://66.media.tumblr.com/0ec10e2d8cbfba6c48714c57919b87e6/tumblr_prii5buXYD1r7zx88_540.jpg&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:640,&quot;height&quot;:640}],&quot;attribution&quot;:{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;app&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/7hDVYcQq6MxkdJGweuCtl9&quot;,&quot;app_name&quot;:&quot;spotify&quot;,&quot;display_text&quot;:&quot;Listen on Spotify&quot;}}\"></figure></p>",

What was I even expecting, they always thought Theon\u2019s ~arc~ was about redemption! (And why does every character need to have an\u00a0\u201carc,\u201d anyway! That\u2019s a qualitative statement on what someone thinks character should be, not something that\u2019s inherent to character as a building block of the text!!!)</p><p>ANYWAY&hellip; YOUR ASK WAS NOT ABOUT THEON, SORRY ANON. I\u2019m honestly of a lot of different minds about Arya being the one to kill the Night King. Here are some of my self-contradictory reactions, in no particular order:</p><p>1. I have no reason to dislike this, and I am okay with it. Arya seems perfectly capable of having done this thing.</p><p>2. D&amp;D feel that it is their responsibility to overturn narrative tropes, which is why they decided not to have Jon kill the Night King; but D&amp;D also have never given any deeper thought as to <i>why\u00a0</i>certain narrative tropes should be overturned, or what exactly they are saying with the ways they overturn them. D&amp;D have considered audience shock to be an end in and of itself, and their storytelling decisions are made in bad faith. If Arya kills the Night King just so that the audience is surprised that it\u2019s her, is that a meaningful decision?</p><p>3. <i>THEON NEVER NEEDED YOUR REDEMPTION!!!!!</i></p><p>4. What is Arya, to me? I see her as primarily concerned with the southern plot of vengeance, political machinations, and human actors. Sure, she can absolutely also be a character who is entwined with the northern plot of winter, cataclysm, and supernatural actors. She isn\u2019t confined to one set of preoccupations. But did we see her make that move within the show? Wouldn\u2019t I have enjoyed this moment more if I knew more about Arya\u2019s own stance towards everything that\u2019s going on in the northern plot?</p><p>5. Would I have found it boring if Jon had been the one? Maybe. What wouldn\u2019t have I found boring? Can there be a satisfactory conclusion to this confrontation? Is it that there <i>can\u2019t</i>\u00a0be one, or that this medium is not equipped to provide us with one, or that D&amp;D are using this medium poorly?</p><p>6. The Witch-king of Angmar cannot be killed by a man because of the race- and gender-inflected way that we are socialized to think of linguistic categories; it\u2019s precisely because everyone is grouped under \u201cman\u201d that it\u2019s a delightful surprise to remember that women and hobbits exist as autonomous categories. So I guess that makes me ask myself, is Arya Stark a member of the subaltern? <i>Does</i>\u00a0her killing the Night King subvert tropes, or is she so physically capable, so unencumbered by social expectations, so respected as a combat participant that she is no less expected a killer of the Night King than Jon?</p><p>7. Well, of course she still has to put up with social expectations! Gendry wanted to make her a lady! But that\u2019s what was so bewildering to me about that scene&ndash; that it would even be possible to look a woman in the eye who just STABBED THE NIGHT KING TO DEATH and ask her if she wants to stay at home. Well, of course it\u2019s bewildering! Ideology has a bewilderingly capacious reach!</p><p>8. On the other hand, Arya can say no, and does. What is Arya, to me? Is it that she is an unexpected choice to kill the Night King because she is a woman? In what other ways are her experiences circumscribed by her womanhood? That\u2019s the point, you might say, she has never let womanhood circumscribe her experiences. But then why would her womanhood ever make her any less likely as the killer of the Night King?</p><p>9. <i>Is</i>\u00a0it that she\u2019s a woman? Is that what this is about? What, exactly, makes Arya the unexpected choice? Is it just that she isn\u2019t Jon? Is it that she\u2019s a slightly less major character than he is? On the tier list of people ranked by how likely they are to be the killer of the Night King, where does Arya fall? I don\u2019t know. Who did I think was going to do it? <i>I don\u2019t know</i>.</p><p>10. I do know that the showrunners have long been fascinated by Arya, and that hers is a particular kind of reaction to womanhood that these men respect because they think they understand it. Is that harsh? I think these men love that she\u2019s renounced gender. No, wait, I think they love that they\u2019ve written her as having renounced gender. I think what they enjoy is not that Arya has exposed gender as a performative construct, but that Arya is a woman who doesn\u2019t make a big deal out of being a woman, and thus provides a little respite from having to think about gender.</p><p>11. Is that harsh? Probably! But D&amp;D have been harsh in the telling of this story, so I think me complaining a little to myself behind a jump cut on my own meandering blog is not likely to upset that balance in the grand scheme of things. Ultimately I\u2019m much less irritated by Arya killing the Night King than at some of the possible reasons I surmise they chose her to kill the Night King.</p><p>12. But you know, though, Theon never needed anyone\u2019s redemption. I just want to reiterate that.</p>",

Wouldn\u2019t I have enjoyed this moment more if I knew more about Arya\u2019s own stance towards everything that\u2019s going on in the northern plot?</p><p>5. Would I have found it boring if Jon had been the one? Maybe. What wouldn\u2019t have I found boring? Can there be a satisfactory conclusion to this confrontation? Is it that there <i>can\u2019t</i>\u00a0be one, or that this medium is not equipped to provide us with one, or that D&amp;D are using this medium poorly?</p><p>6. The Witch-king of Angmar cannot be killed by a man because of the race- and gender-inflected way that we are socialized to think of linguistic categories; it\u2019s precisely because everyone is grouped under \u201cman\u201d that it\u2019s a delightful surprise to remember that women and hobbits exist as autonomous categories. So I guess that makes me ask myself, is Arya Stark a member of the subaltern? <i>Does</i>\u00a0her killing the Night King subvert tropes, or is she so physically capable, so unencumbered by social expectations, so respected as a combat participant that she is no less expected a killer of the Night King than Jon?</p><p>7. Well, of course she still has to put up with social expectations! Gendry wanted to make her a lady! But that\u2019s what was so bewildering to me about that scene\u2013 that it would even be possible to look a woman in the eye who just STABBED THE NIGHT KING TO DEATH and ask her if she wants to stay at home. Well, of course it\u2019s bewildering! Ideology has a bewilderingly capacious reach!</p><p>8. On the other hand, Arya can say no, and does. What is Arya, to me? Is it that she is an unexpected choice to kill the Night King because she is a woman? In what other ways are her experiences circumscribed by her womanhood? That\u2019s the point, you might say, she has never let womanhood circumscribe her experiences. But then why would her womanhood ever make her any less likely as the killer of the Night King?</p><p>9. <i>Is</i>\u00a0it that she\u2019s a woman? Is that what this is about? What, exactly, makes Arya the unexpected choice? Is it just that she isn\u2019t Jon? Is it that she\u2019s a slightly less major character than he is? On the tier list of people ranked by how likely they are to be the killer of the Night King, where does Arya fall? I don\u2019t know. Who did I think was going to do it? <i>I don\u2019t know</i>.</p><p>10. I do know that the showrunners have long been fascinated by Arya, and that hers is a particular kind of reaction to womanhood that these men respect because they think they understand it. Is that harsh? I think these men love that she\u2019s renounced gender. No, wait, I think they love that they\u2019ve written her as having renounced gender. I think what they enjoy is not that Arya has exposed gender as a performative construct, but that Arya is a woman who doesn\u2019t make a big deal out of being a woman, and thus provides a little respite from having to think about gender.</p><p>11. Is that harsh? Probably! But D&amp;D have been harsh in the telling of this story, so I think me complaining a little to myself behind a jump cut on my own meandering blog is not likely to upset that balance in the grand scheme of things. Ultimately I\u2019m much less irritated by Arya killing the Night King than at some of the possible reasons I surmise they chose her to kill the Night King.</p><p>12. But you know, though, Theon never needed anyone\u2019s redemption. I just want to reiterate that.</p>",
