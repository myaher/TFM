I used to dream I could.&rdquo;  </p><p>He listened in awe as she peeled away one more layer of the mystery of Daenerys Targaryen, stroking her hair while with unquestioned trust she told him of her husband&rsquo;s funeral pyre, and how she had knowlingly walked into the inferno, only to emerge unharmed, with three baby dragons.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a damn magical woman, you know that?&rdquo; he whispered against her forehead, placing a kiss there.</p><p>She shrugged. &ldquo;The blood of Old Valyria. There is power in that blood, but power isn&rsquo;t of my blood alone.&rdquo;  Her eyes fell pointedly upon his scarred chest, and his breath hitched. He still had not confessed to her what happened, how he received those scars, for each time he considered it, he felt the stabs of pain and betrayal anew.  Jon knew Daenerys was no fool. She had to know his wounds were mortal, yet he lived and breathed.  Mercifully, she had not asked him more about it. Perhaps he owed the truth to her, considering what she had just revealed to him, but before he could speak, she flipped him onto his back and sat astride his chest, leaning over him, her breasts dangling just out of reach of his mouth, her hair falling over her shoulders, the ends brushing his skin. &ldquo;Now, Jon Snow,&rdquo; she practically sang, &ldquo;tonight, you belong to me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I belong to you every night, until my last on this earth.&rdquo; The words had left him before he could consider their brevity.  Dany sat upright, the sultry smile dying from her lips, her expression inscrutable, and for a moment Jon was panicked. Did she not feel the same?  He was so certain she did.  The way she held him, the way she nested in his arms while they slept, the way she KNEW him, body and soul&hellip;.these were not intimacies shared with a mere bedwarmer.  But then he saw her eyes glisten, perhaps with welling tears, like he&rsquo;d seen when he woke to find her keeping watch at his bedside after they&rsquo;d departed The Wall. He lifted his hand to cup her cheek, and she leaned into that touch, closing her eyes and clasping her hand around his.</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;as I belong to you.&rdquo; </p><p>His heart leapt. He guided her head toward his and his lips found hers, kissing her sweetly, reverently, tenderly as he was wont to do. He could not help but treat her as though she were made of the most fragile glass, despite his darker desire to take her hard with abandon, the Dothraki way, as she called it.</p><p>&ldquo;So what does my Queen command of me?&rdquo; he murmured against her lips.  &ldquo;Shall I murder someone?  Perhaps remove Lord Tyrion&rsquo;s tongue, the gods save us all?&rdquo;</p><p>She chuckled. &ldquo;There will be no need to remove any tongues&hellip;though I trust you shall make good use of yours.&rdquo;</p><p>Her words ignited his blood which flowed straight to his cock. He would gladly spend the evening with his head between her thighs, feasting on her sweetness, reveling in what he could do to her.  It was no chore to him, to feel her writhe and buck beneath him as he licked and nipped and drew out her release. Sometimes, he would use his fingers in tandem with his tongue, nearly spilling himself when her tight walls would pulse hard around them.  He loved the mewling cries of his name on her lips.  He loved that when he finished, she always wanted his cock inside her, bringing her to the precipice again, then tipping her over the edge with him following shortly.</p><p>&ldquo;Shall we begin?&rdquo; he rasped, grazing her earlobe with his beard as he trailed a hand down the length of her torso to find her cunt.  She rolled her hips in response, then stilled.</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>She grasped his hand and pulled it away, lacing her fingers through his, and he was at a loss.</p><p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, My Lord.&rdquo; She stilled her hips and pierced his eyes with hers.  &ldquo;My command to you this night, is that you shall have your way with me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My way with you?&rdquo;  Jon Snow had never been the quickest, even he would admit that.  He preferred that people speak plainly, to state their intentions and get on with it.  If he hoped to keep pace with his Queen, he needed to get better at reading what was behind her words.  </p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  Daenerys dismounted him and he sat up.  She knelt before him and took his hands in hers.  &ldquo;You are a skilled lover, Jon Snow.  You are tender and considerate and proper, and no doubt my body was made for you and yours for me. But I sense&hellip;.&rdquo; he must have looked incredulous, for she placed a reassuring hand on his cheek before continuing, &ldquo;I sense that you have not given me all of yourself.  You are passionate but careful.  I don&rsquo;t want you to be careful.  I want you to take me. I want you to take what is yours, as I am yours.  However you&rsquo;d like, whatever you want, you needn&rsquo;t be afraid. I want you to lose yourself in me, forget that I am your Queen, and remember that I am your lover and my body is yours, if you want it.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon swallowed thickly, his cheeks reddening. A thousand wicked thoughts raced through his mind, things he wasn&rsquo;t even sure were physically possible.  His eyes darted around the cabin, which was dimming with the dying fire. Some of the things he wanted - one, in particular - he shook his head as if to dislodge the thought. What moments ago seemed promising and exciting now engulfed him with apprehension. He would not cause her pain, no matter what depravity he imagined. His knowledge of lovemaking was meager in comparison to things he&rsquo;d heard from some of his Night&rsquo;s Watch brothers, or the men in Winterfell who&rsquo;d visited Ros and her friends in the Winter Town brothels.  He knew there were ways - many more ways - for a woman and man to have a go at each other besides the man on top, or the woman on top, but in the end, the result was a cock inside of a cunt or a mouth or&hellip;..</p><p>He would not ask it of her.  He would not defile her in such a way.  She was a Queen, not a whore, no matter how much she may want to be treated as such for her own excitement.</p><p>&ldquo;What I want,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;is to know that I have pleased you. To know that it feels good for you to have me inside you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You want that, yes, and you have it,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;I do not need you to look after my honor.  For tonight, I am yours, to do with as you will.  So if your will is to sit there with a dumb look on your face as though I&rsquo;ve asked you to sew a new dress for me, then so be it, though I hope that is not your intention.&rdquo; She trailed a hand up his chest, leaned in and kissed him.</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip;I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; He knew she could be quick tempered, but when she shot off the bed and tied her robe tightly around her waist, he was still dismayed. </p><p>&ldquo;Very well, Jon Snow,&rdquo; she seethed.  &ldquo;I offered my body to you, and you have refused.  If the notion repels you so, perhaps tonight you should sleep in your own cabin.&rdquo;  </p><p>And now, he&rsquo;d done it. Not for the first time, he cursed his own sense of honor and propriety. And it wasn&rsquo;t just her anger; he could see in her face as she stalked over to the cabin door and opened it, that he&rsquo;d hurt her. Slowly, he slid from the bed and collected his discarded tunic, and made his way to the door.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to offend you&hellip;.&rdquo; Her eyes were blue steel and flame, and he could see her pulse pounding at the base of her neck, then his eyes slipped lower to her exposed collarbone, then lower to the delicate curve of her breasts beneath the silk robe.</p><p>Then why did you? Her eyes said what her voice could not muster.</p><p>Why was he so fucking thick? This beauty, this goddess, had offered herself to him freely, not just this night, but so long ago when she vowed that they would destroy the Night King and his army together.  She&rsquo;d asked him for nothing, and sacrificed everything, and she wanted him&hellip;.HIM, a nameless Northern bastard who never allowed himself to fathom claiming someone like her for his own, but here she was.</p><p>&ldquo;Go.&rdquo; She narrowed her eyes expectantly, gripping the door knob tighter, her knuckles whitening with the effort.</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; He curled his fingers hard around hers on the knob, urging the door closed, and lowered his head until their faces were but a breath apart. </p><p>&ldquo;You will obey your Queen Jon Snow,&rdquo; she said, though weakly. &ldquo;If you are so frightened of me, then leave.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t frighten me Daenerys.&rdquo;  He shifted his body, pressing hers against the door. He grasped her shoulders, slipping her robe from one, then the other, freeing her breasts, the hardened nipples betraying her desire for him. &ldquo;You drive me mad.&rdquo; Then he captured her mouth with a hard kiss, fumbling with the silky knot at her waist, her robe falling away and pooling at her ankles.  The intrusive garment removed, his hands seized her breasts as his lips worked over hers, moving hungrily along her jaw line and down the column of her neck. Her hands tangled in his hair for a moment, then moved down his chest to the waistband of his trousers, trying to undo the laces, but he pulled away and captured her wrists.  &ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jon,&rdquo; she panted, but he quieted her by claiming her mouth again. He released one wrist and urged a knee between her legs, parting her thighs to open her for him, and snaked his hand up her arm, over her breast, and then to her waiting entrance, where he stopped to toy with the sensitive nub there. Her back arched from the door like a cat, her legs trembling as she ground her womanhood against his hand. Her liquid desire coated his fingers, and his cock begged to burst forth from the imprisonment of his trousers and enter her roughly.  His length throbbed and his stones ached and  protested the delay.  Jon released Dany&rsquo;s other wrist and clumsily unlaced his trousers, taking only enough time to free his cock before hitching her legs around his waist and thrusting upward, pausing for only a second to collect himself and drop his head to her shoulder.  When he looked up again, her eyes were closed, her head thrown back in ecstasy, her lips swollen and parted and wanton.  Upward he thrust again, raising his hand to her jaw and forcing her head down to level her gaze to his.</p><p>&ldquo;Look at me,&rdquo; he ordered, and she bit her lip and nodded imperceptibly.  &ldquo;I need to see your face.&rdquo; Harder he thrust into her, her breasts jiggling with the force of it.  If she dared look away, he would still himself until she returned to him.  He pressed her closer against the door and angled her hips, giving the hands anchored at her waist room to explore. She used what leverage she could to meet his upward movements with downward ones, and his blood pumped fiercely as he felt the head of his cock collide with her womb.  With his right hand, he squeezed the flesh of her shapely ass, allowing one finger to work its way down the tight crease to settle just between her cunt and the tiny hole there.  He&rsquo;d discovered how sensitive that spot was when he took her with his mouth, and it seemed to arouse her just as much with his cock inside her.  &ldquo;I want to take you there,&rdquo; he admitted through heavy breaths, blood rushing to his face as he confessed his desire.  &ldquo;After you have me slick enough, I want you on your knees while I take your ass.&rdquo;</p><p>Her shaky breath at those wicked words nearly finished him, and he had to pause to collect himself. She keened in protest and he felt her walls purposefully tighten around his shaft.  &ldquo;Yes, Jon,&rdquo; was all she could muster, and then she came, forcefully and loudly, her head falling back against the ornate wooden door as she bucked and writhed.</p><p>Not yet, he thought, not yet, but he&rsquo;d lost control and couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to leave her long enough to reposition them for the salacious act. &ldquo;Dany!&rdquo; he yelped, and then his seed spurted forth, upward into her womb, and he had to call on every bit of his strength to hold them both upright while his heartbeat slowed.  His cock twitched within her as her walls milked every drop of his spent seed, then he released her legs and set her feet gently on the floor.  Scooping her into his arms, he carried her to the bed and arranged her there, freeing himself fully from his trousers and lying beside her, their breaths slowing finally to allow them to speak.</p><p><br/></p><h2>Continue to Part 3: <a href=\"https://reddragon1995.tumblr.com/post/178839218590/a-jonerys-one-shot-part-3\">https://reddragon1995.tumblr.com/post/178839218590/a-jonerys-one-shot-part-3</a></h2><p data-npf='{\"type\":\"link\",\"url\":\"https://reddragon1995.tumblr.com/post/178839218590/a-jonerys-one-shot-part-3\",\"display_url\":\"https://reddragon1995.tumblr.com/post/178839218590/a-jonerys-one-shot-part-3\",\"description\":\"Unburnt  A Jonerys One-Shot, Part 3 I wanted this to be one long post but I guess Tumblr has character limits!

So if your will is to sit there with a dumb look on your face as though I\u2019ve asked you to sew a new dress for me, then so be it, though I hope that is not your intention.\u201d She trailed a hand up his chest, leaned in and kissed him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026I can\u2019t.\u201d He knew she could be quick tempered, but when she shot off the bed and tied her robe tightly around her waist, he was still dismayed. </p><p>\u201cVery well, Jon Snow,\u201d she seethed.  \u201cI offered my body to you, and you have refused.  If the notion repels you so, perhaps tonight you should sleep in your own cabin.\u201d  </p><p>And now, he\u2019d done it. Not for the first time, he cursed his own sense of honor and propriety. And it wasn\u2019t just her anger; he could see in her face as she stalked over to the cabin door and opened it, that he\u2019d hurt her. Slowly, he slid from the bed and collected his discarded tunic, and made his way to the door.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to offend you\u2026.\u201d Her eyes were blue steel and flame, and he could see her pulse pounding at the base of her neck, then his eyes slipped lower to her exposed collarbone, then lower to the delicate curve of her breasts beneath the silk robe.</p><p>Then why did you? Her eyes said what her voice could not muster.</p><p>Why was he so fucking thick? This beauty, this goddess, had offered herself to him freely, not just this night, but so long ago when she vowed that they would destroy the Night King and his army together.  She\u2019d asked him for nothing, and sacrificed everything, and she wanted him\u2026.HIM, a nameless Northern bastard who never allowed himself to fathom claiming someone like her for his own, but here she was.</p><p>\u201cGo.\u201d She narrowed her eyes expectantly, gripping the door knob tighter, her knuckles whitening with the effort.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He curled his fingers hard around hers on the knob, urging the door closed, and lowered his head until their faces were but a breath apart. </p><p>\u201cYou will obey your Queen Jon Snow,\u201d she said, though weakly. \u201cIf you are so frightened of me, then leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t frighten me Daenerys.\u201d  He shifted his body, pressing hers against the door. He grasped her shoulders, slipping her robe from one, then the other, freeing her breasts, the hardened nipples betraying her desire for him. \u201cYou drive me mad.\u201d Then he captured her mouth with a hard kiss, fumbling with the silky knot at her waist, her robe falling away and pooling at her ankles.  The intrusive garment removed, his hands seized her breasts as his lips worked over hers, moving hungrily along her jaw line and down the column of her neck. Her hands tangled in his hair for a moment, then moved down his chest to the waistband of his trousers, trying to undo the laces, but he pulled away and captured her wrists.  \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJon,\u201d she panted, but he quieted her by claiming her mouth again. He released one wrist and urged a knee between her legs, parting her thighs to open her for him, and snaked his hand up her arm, over her breast, and then to her waiting entrance, where he stopped to toy with the sensitive nub there. Her back arched from the door like a cat, her legs trembling as she ground her womanhood against his hand. Her liquid desire coated his fingers, and his cock begged to burst forth from the imprisonment of his trousers and enter her roughly.  His length throbbed and his stones ached and  protested the delay.  Jon released Dany\u2019s other wrist and clumsily unlaced his trousers, taking only enough time to free his cock before hitching her legs around his waist and thrusting upward, pausing for only a second to collect himself and drop his head to her shoulder.  When he looked up again, her eyes were closed, her head thrown back in ecstasy, her lips swollen and parted and wanton.  Upward he thrust again, raising his hand to her jaw and forcing her head down to level her gaze to his.</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d he ordered, and she bit her lip and nodded imperceptibly.  \u201cI need to see your face.\u201d Harder he thrust into her, her breasts jiggling with the force of it.  If she dared look away, he would still himself until she returned to him.  He pressed her closer against the door and angled her hips, giving the hands anchored at her waist room to explore. She used what leverage she could to meet his upward movements with downward ones, and his blood pumped fiercely as he felt the head of his cock collide with her womb.  With his right hand, he squeezed the flesh of her shapely ass, allowing one finger to work its way down the tight crease to settle just between her cunt and the tiny hole there.  He\u2019d discovered how sensitive that spot was when he took her with his mouth, and it seemed to arouse her just as much with his cock inside her.  \u201cI want to take you there,\u201d he admitted through heavy breaths, blood rushing to his face as he confessed his desire.  \u201cAfter you have me slick enough, I want you on your knees while I take your ass.\u201d</p><p>Her shaky breath at those wicked words nearly finished him, and he had to pause to collect himself. She keened in protest and he felt her walls purposefully tighten around his shaft.  \u201cYes, Jon,\u201d was all she could muster, and then she came, forcefully and loudly, her head falling back against the ornate wooden door as she bucked and writhed.</p><p>Not yet, he thought, not yet, but he\u2019d lost control and couldn\u2019t bring himself to leave her long enough to reposition them for the salacious act. \u201cDany!\u201d he yelped, and then his seed spurted forth, upward into her womb, and he had to call on every bit of his strength to hold them both upright while his heartbeat slowed.  His cock twitched within her as her walls milked every drop of his spent seed, then he released her legs and set her feet gently on the floor.  Scooping her into his arms, he carried her to the bed and arranged her there, freeing himself fully from his trousers and lying beside her, their breaths slowing finally to allow them to speak.</p><p><br></p><h2>Continue to Part 3: <a href=\"https://reddragon1995.tumblr.com/post/178839218590/a-jonerys-one-shot-part-3\">https://reddragon1995.tumblr.com/post/178839218590/a-jonerys-one-shot-part-3</a></h2><p data-npf='{\"type\":\"link\",\"url\":\"https://reddragon1995.tumblr.com/post/178839218590/a-jonerys-one-shot-part-3\",\"display_url\":\"https://reddragon1995.tumblr.com/post/178839218590/a-jonerys-one-shot-part-3\",\"description\":\"Unburnt  A Jonerys One-Shot, Part 3 I wanted this to be one long post but I guess Tumblr has character limits!

A Tumblr exclusi</a></p><p>\u201cYou are, but\u2026\u201d</p><p>She cocked a teasing eyebrow. \u201cYou thought that Unburnt was a figure of speech.\u201d</p><p>Jon ran a hand through his raven black curls, shaking his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I thought.\u201d</p><p>Dany propped herself up on her elbows, her robe falling away, and instinctively he placed a hand on one breast, lightly kneading the plump mound.  \u201cWhat happened?\u201d he whispered.  \u201cHow did you know you could do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just knew.  I used to dream I could.\u201d  </p><p>He listened in awe as she peeled away one more layer of the mystery of Daenerys Targaryen, stroking her hair while with unquestioned trust she told him of her husband\u2019s funeral pyre, and how she had knowlingly walked into the inferno, only to emerge unharmed, with three baby dragons.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a damn magical woman, you know that?\u201d he whispered against her forehead, placing a kiss there.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cThe blood of Old Valyria. There is power in that blood, but power isn\u2019t of my blood alone.\u201d  Her eyes fell pointedly upon his scarred chest, and his breath hitched. He still had not confessed to her what happened, how he received those scars, for each time he considered it, he felt the stabs of pain and betrayal anew.  Jon knew Daenerys was no fool. She had to know his wounds were mortal, yet he lived and breathed.  Mercifully, she had not asked him more about it. Perhaps he owed the truth to her, considering what she had just revealed to him, but before he could speak, she flipped him onto his back and sat astride his chest, leaning over him, her breasts dangling just out of reach of his mouth, her hair falling over her shoulders, the ends brushing his skin. \u201cNow, Jon Snow,\u201d she practically sang, \u201ctonight, you belong to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI belong to you every night, until my last on this earth.\u201d The words had left him before he could consider their brevity.  Dany sat upright, the sultry smile dying from her lips, her expression inscrutable, and for a moment Jon was panicked. Did she not feel the same?  He was so certain she did.  The way she held him, the way she nested in his arms while they slept, the way she KNEW him, body and soul\u2026.these were not intimacies shared with a mere bedwarmer.  But then he saw her eyes glisten, perhaps with welling tears, like he\u2019d seen when he woke to find her keeping watch at his bedside after they\u2019d departed The Wall. He lifted his hand to cup her cheek, and she leaned into that touch, closing her eyes and clasping her hand around his.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she whispered, \u201cas I belong to you.\u201d </p><p>His heart leapt. He guided her head toward his and his lips found hers, kissing her sweetly, reverently, tenderly as he was wont to do. He could not help but treat her as though she were made of the most fragile glass, despite his darker desire to take her hard with abandon, the Dothraki way, as she called it.</p><p>\u201cSo what does my Queen command of me?\u201d he murmured against her lips.  \u201cShall I murder someone?  Perhaps remove Lord Tyrion\u2019s tongue, the gods save us all?\u201d</p><p>She chuckled. \u201cThere will be no need to remove any tongues\u2026though I trust you shall make good use of yours.\u201d</p><p>Her words ignited his blood which flowed straight to his cock. He would gladly spend the evening with his head between her thighs, feasting on her sweetness, reveling in what he could do to her.  It was no chore to him, to feel her writhe and buck beneath him as he licked and nipped and drew out her release. Sometimes, he would use his fingers in tandem with his tongue, nearly spilling himself when her tight walls would pulse hard around them.  He loved the mewling cries of his name on her lips.  He loved that when he finished, she always wanted his cock inside her, bringing her to the precipice again, then tipping her over the edge with him following shortly.</p><p>\u201cShall we begin?\u201d he rasped, grazing her earlobe with his beard as he trailed a hand down the length of her torso to find her cunt.  She rolled her hips in response, then stilled.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She grasped his hand and pulled it away, lacing her fingers through his, and he was at a loss.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, My Lord.\u201d She stilled her hips and pierced his eyes with hers.  \u201cMy command to you this night, is that you shall have your way with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy way with you?\u201d  Jon Snow had never been the quickest, even he would admit that.  He preferred that people speak plainly, to state their intentions and get on with it.  If he hoped to keep pace with his Queen, he needed to get better at reading what was behind her words.  </p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d  Daenerys dismounted him and he sat up.  She knelt before him and took his hands in hers.  \u201cYou are a skilled lover, Jon Snow.  You are tender and considerate and proper, and no doubt my body was made for you and yours for me. But I sense\u2026.\u201d he must have looked incredulous, for she placed a reassuring hand on his cheek before continuing, \u201cI sense that you have not given me all of yourself.  You are passionate but careful.  I don\u2019t want you to be careful.  I want you to take me. I want you to take what is yours, as I am yours.  However you\u2019d like, whatever you want, you needn\u2019t be afraid. I want you to lose yourself in me, forget that I am your Queen, and remember that I am your lover and my body is yours, if you want it.\u201d</p><p>Jon swallowed thickly, his cheeks reddening. A thousand wicked thoughts raced through his mind, things he wasn\u2019t even sure were physically possible.  His eyes darted around the cabin, which was dimming with the dying fire. Some of the things he wanted - one, in particular - he shook his head as if to dislodge the thought. What moments ago seemed promising and exciting now engulfed him with apprehension. He would not cause her pain, no matter what depravity he imagined. His knowledge of lovemaking was meager in comparison to things he\u2019d heard from some of his Night\u2019s Watch brothers, or the men in Winterfell who\u2019d visited Ros and her friends in the Winter Town brothels.  He knew there were ways - many more ways - for a woman and man to have a go at each other besides the man on top, or the woman on top, but in the end, the result was a cock inside of a cunt or a mouth or\u2026..</p><p>He would not ask it of her.  He would not defile her in such a way.  She was a Queen, not a whore, no matter how much she may want to be treated as such for her own excitement.</p><p>\u201cWhat I want,\u201d he murmured, \u201cis to know that I have pleased you. To know that it feels good for you to have me inside you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want that, yes, and you have it,\u201d she sighed. \u201cI do not need you to look after my honor.  For tonight, I am yours, to do with as you will.  So if your will is to sit there with a dumb look on your face as though I\u2019ve asked you to sew a new dress for me, then so be it, though I hope that is not your intention.\u201d She trailed a hand up his chest, leaned in and kissed him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026I can\u2019t.\u201d He knew she could be quick tempered, but when she shot off the bed and tied her robe tightly around her waist, he was still dismayed. </p><p>\u201cVery well, Jon Snow,\u201d she seethed.  \u201cI offered my body to you, and you have refused.  If the notion repels you so, perhaps tonight you should sleep in your own cabin.\u201d  </p><p>And now, he\u2019d done it. Not for the first time, he cursed his own sense of honor and propriety.

A Tumblr exclusi</a></p><p>&ldquo;You are, but&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>She cocked a teasing eyebrow. &ldquo;You thought that Unburnt was a figure of speech.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon ran a hand through his raven black curls, shaking his head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I thought.&rdquo;</p><p>Dany propped herself up on her elbows, her robe falling away, and instinctively he placed a hand on one breast, lightly kneading the plump mound.  &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; he whispered.  &ldquo;How did you know you could do that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I just knew.  I used to dream I could.&rdquo;  </p><p>He listened in awe as she peeled away one more layer of the mystery of Daenerys Targaryen, stroking her hair while with unquestioned trust she told him of her husband&rsquo;s funeral pyre, and how she had knowlingly walked into the inferno, only to emerge unharmed, with three baby dragons.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a damn magical woman, you know that?&rdquo; he whispered against her forehead, placing a kiss there.</p><p>She shrugged. &ldquo;The blood of Old Valyria. There is power in that blood, but power isn&rsquo;t of my blood alone.&rdquo;  Her eyes fell pointedly upon his scarred chest, and his breath hitched. He still had not confessed to her what happened, how he received those scars, for each time he considered it, he felt the stabs of pain and betrayal anew.  Jon knew Daenerys was no fool. She had to know his wounds were mortal, yet he lived and breathed.  Mercifully, she had not asked him more about it. Perhaps he owed the truth to her, considering what she had just revealed to him, but before he could speak, she flipped him onto his back and sat astride his chest, leaning over him, her breasts dangling just out of reach of his mouth, her hair falling over her shoulders, the ends brushing his skin. &ldquo;Now, Jon Snow,&rdquo; she practically sang, &ldquo;tonight, you belong to me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I belong to you every night, until my last on this earth.&rdquo; The words had left him before he could consider their brevity.  Dany sat upright, the sultry smile dying from her lips, her expression inscrutable, and for a moment Jon was panicked. Did she not feel the same?  He was so certain she did.  The way she held him, the way she nested in his arms while they slept, the way she KNEW him, body and soul&hellip;.these were not intimacies shared with a mere bedwarmer.  But then he saw her eyes glisten, perhaps with welling tears, like he&rsquo;d seen when he woke to find her keeping watch at his bedside after they&rsquo;d departed The Wall. He lifted his hand to cup her cheek, and she leaned into that touch, closing her eyes and clasping her hand around his.</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;as I belong to you.&rdquo; </p><p>His heart leapt. He guided her head toward his and his lips found hers, kissing her sweetly, reverently, tenderly as he was wont to do. He could not help but treat her as though she were made of the most fragile glass, despite his darker desire to take her hard with abandon, the Dothraki way, as she called it.</p><p>&ldquo;So what does my Queen command of me?&rdquo; he murmured against her lips.  &ldquo;Shall I murder someone?  Perhaps remove Lord Tyrion&rsquo;s tongue, the gods save us all?&rdquo;</p><p>She chuckled. &ldquo;There will be no need to remove any tongues&hellip;though I trust you shall make good use of yours.&rdquo;</p><p>Her words ignited his blood which flowed straight to his cock. He would gladly spend the evening with his head between her thighs, feasting on her sweetness, reveling in what he could do to her.  It was no chore to him, to feel her writhe and buck beneath him as he licked and nipped and drew out her release. Sometimes, he would use his fingers in tandem with his tongue, nearly spilling himself when her tight walls would pulse hard around them.  He loved the mewling cries of his name on her lips.  He loved that when he finished, she always wanted his cock inside her, bringing her to the precipice again, then tipping her over the edge with him following shortly.</p><p>&ldquo;Shall we begin?&rdquo; he rasped, grazing her earlobe with his beard as he trailed a hand down the length of her torso to find her cunt.  She rolled her hips in response, then stilled.</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>She grasped his hand and pulled it away, lacing her fingers through his, and he was at a loss.</p><p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, My Lord.&rdquo; She stilled her hips and pierced his eyes with hers.  &ldquo;My command to you this night, is that you shall have your way with me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My way with you?&rdquo;  Jon Snow had never been the quickest, even he would admit that.  He preferred that people speak plainly, to state their intentions and get on with it.  If he hoped to keep pace with his Queen, he needed to get better at reading what was behind her words.  </p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  Daenerys dismounted him and he sat up.  She knelt before him and took his hands in hers.  &ldquo;You are a skilled lover, Jon Snow.  You are tender and considerate and proper, and no doubt my body was made for you and yours for me. But I sense&hellip;.&rdquo; he must have looked incredulous, for she placed a reassuring hand on his cheek before continuing, &ldquo;I sense that you have not given me all of yourself.  You are passionate but careful.  I don&rsquo;t want you to be careful.  I want you to take me. I want you to take what is yours, as I am yours.  However you&rsquo;d like, whatever you want, you needn&rsquo;t be afraid. I want you to lose yourself in me, forget that I am your Queen, and remember that I am your lover and my body is yours, if you want it.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon swallowed thickly, his cheeks reddening. A thousand wicked thoughts raced through his mind, things he wasn&rsquo;t even sure were physically possible.  His eyes darted around the cabin, which was dimming with the dying fire. Some of the things he wanted - one, in particular - he shook his head as if to dislodge the thought. What moments ago seemed promising and exciting now engulfed him with apprehension. He would not cause her pain, no matter what depravity he imagined. His knowledge of lovemaking was meager in comparison to things he&rsquo;d heard from some of his Night&rsquo;s Watch brothers, or the men in Winterfell who&rsquo;d visited Ros and her friends in the Winter Town brothels.  He knew there were ways - many more ways - for a woman and man to have a go at each other besides the man on top, or the woman on top, but in the end, the result was a cock inside of a cunt or a mouth or&hellip;..</p><p>He would not ask it of her.  He would not defile her in such a way.  She was a Queen, not a whore, no matter how much she may want to be treated as such for her own excitement.</p><p>&ldquo;What I want,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;is to know that I have pleased you. To know that it feels good for you to have me inside you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You want that, yes, and you have it,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;I do not need you to look after my honor.  For tonight, I am yours, to do with as you will.  So if your will is to sit there with a dumb look on your face as though I&rsquo;ve asked you to sew a new dress for me, then so be it, though I hope that is not your intention.&rdquo; She trailed a hand up his chest, leaned in and kissed him.</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip;I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; He knew she could be quick tempered, but when she shot off the bed and tied her robe tightly around her waist, he was still dismayed. </p><p>&ldquo;Very well, Jon Snow,&rdquo; she seethed.  &ldquo;I offered my body to you, and you have refused.  If the notion repels you so, perhaps tonight you should sleep in your own cabin.&rdquo;  </p><p>And now, he&rsquo;d done it. Not for the first time, he cursed his own sense of honor and propriety. And it wasn&rsquo;t just her anger; he could see in her face as she stalked over to the cabin door and opened it, that he&rsquo;d hurt her. Slowly, he slid from the bed and collected his discarded tunic, and made his way to the door.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to offend you&hellip;.&rdquo; Her eyes were blue steel and flame, and he could see her pulse pounding at the base of her neck, then his eyes slipped lower to her exposed collarbone, then lower to the delicate curve of her breasts beneath the silk robe.</p><p>Then why did you? Her eyes said what her voice could not muster.</p><p>Why was he so fucking thick? This beauty, this goddess, had offered herself to him freely, not just this night, but so long ago when she vowed that they would destroy the Night King and his army together.  She&rsquo;d asked him for nothing, and sacrificed everything, and she wanted him&hellip;.HIM, a nameless Northern bastard who never allowed himself to fathom claiming someone like her for his own, but here she was.</p><p>&ldquo;Go.&rdquo; She narrowed her eyes expectantly, gripping the door knob tighter, her knuckles whitening with the effort.</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; He curled his fingers hard around hers on the knob, urging the door closed, and lowered his head until their faces were but a breath apart. </p><p>&ldquo;You will obey your Queen Jon Snow,&rdquo; she said, though weakly. &ldquo;If you are so frightened of me, then leave.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t frighten me Daenerys.&rdquo;  He shifted his body, pressing hers against the door. He grasped her shoulders, slipping her robe from one, then the other, freeing her breasts, the hardened nipples betraying her desire for him. &ldquo;You drive me mad.&rdquo; Then he captured her mouth with a hard kiss, fumbling with the silky knot at her waist, her robe falling away and pooling at her ankles.  The intrusive garment removed, his hands seized her breasts as his lips worked over hers, moving hungrily along her jaw line and down the column of her neck. Her hands tangled in his hair for a moment, then moved down his chest to the waistband of his trousers, trying to undo the laces, but he pulled away and captured her wrists.  &ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jon,&rdquo; she panted, but he quieted her by claiming her mouth again. He released one wrist and urged a knee between her legs, parting her thighs to open her for him, and snaked his hand up her arm, over her breast, and then to her waiting entrance, where he stopped to toy with the sensitive nub there. Her back arched from the door like a cat, her legs trembling as she ground her womanhood against his hand. Her liquid desire coated his fingers, and his cock begged to burst forth from the imprisonment of his trousers and enter her roughly.  His length throbbed and his stones ached and  protested the delay.  Jon released Dany&rsquo;s other wrist and clumsily unlaced his trousers, taking only enough time to free his cock before hitching her legs around his waist and thrusting upward, pausing for only a second to collect himself and drop his head to her shoulder.  When he looked up again, her eyes were closed, her head thrown back in ecstasy, her lips swollen and parted and wanton.  Upward he thrust again, raising his hand to her jaw and forcing her head down to level her gaze to his.</p><p>&ldquo;Look at me,&rdquo; he ordered, and she bit her lip and nodded imperceptibly.  &ldquo;I need to see your face.&rdquo; Harder he thrust into her, her breasts jiggling with the force of it.  If she dared look away, he would still himself until she returned to him.  He pressed her closer against the door and angled her hips, giving the hands anchored at her waist room to explore. She used what leverage she could to meet his upward movements with downward ones, and his blood pumped fiercely as he felt the head of his cock collide with her womb.  With his right hand, he squeezed the flesh of her shapely ass, allowing one finger to work its way down the tight crease to settle just between her cunt and the tiny hole there.  He&rsquo;d discovered how sensitive that spot was when he took her with his mouth, and it seemed to arouse her just as much with his cock inside her.  &ldquo;I want to take you there,&rdquo; he admitted through heavy breaths, blood rushing to his face as he confessed his desire.  &ldquo;After you have me slick enough, I want you on your knees while I take your ass.&rdquo;</p><p>Her shaky breath at those wicked words nearly finished him, and he had to pause to collect himself. She keened in protest and he felt her walls purposefully tighten around his shaft.  &ldquo;Yes, Jon,&rdquo; was all she could muster, and then she came, forcefully and loudly, her head falling back against the ornate wooden door as she bucked and writhed.</p><p>Not yet, he thought, not yet, but he&rsquo;d lost control and couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to leave her long enough to reposition them for the salacious act. &ldquo;Dany!&rdquo; he yelped, and then his seed spurted forth, upward into her womb, and he had to call on every bit of his strength to hold them both upright while his heartbeat slowed.  His cock twitched within her as her walls milked every drop of his spent seed, then he released her legs and set her feet gently on the floor.  Scooping her into his arms, he carried her to the bed and arranged her there, freeing himself fully from his trousers and lying beside her, their breaths slowing finally to allow them to speak.</p><p><br /></p><h2>Continue to Part 3: <a href=\"https://reddragon1995.tumblr.com/post/178839218590/a-jonerys-one-shot-part-3\">https://reddragon1995.tumblr.com/post/178839218590/a-jonerys-one-shot-part-3</a></h2><p data-npf=\"{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://reddragon1995.tumblr.com/post/178839218590/a-jonerys-one-shot-part-3&quot;,&quot;display_url&quot;:&quot;https://reddragon1995.tumblr.com/post/178839218590/a-jonerys-one-shot-part-3&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Unburnt  A Jonerys One-Shot, Part 3 I wanted this to be one long post but I guess Tumblr has character limits!
