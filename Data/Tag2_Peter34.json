What\u2019s hurting right now?\u201d</p><p>The question was obviously directed at Peter, but the boy looked like even opening his mouth would wear him out, so Tony answered instead.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s had a stomachache since yesterday, but it got significantly worse just now. Said it moved to his abdomen. Vomiting and a fever as well.\u201d</p><p>Bruce dropped his wrist and started feeling along Peter\u2019s neck for swollen lymph nodes. \u201cHow high is the fever?\u201d</p><p>\u201c102.3\u00b0 Fahrenheit, Dr. Banner.\u201d FRIDAY answered.</p><p>Tony\u2019s hand immediately went up to feel Peter\u2019s neck and he was met with a radiating heat coming from the boy\u2019s skin, slick with sweat.</p><p>\u201cYou said the pain moved?\u201d, Bruce asked and glanced at Tony for confirmation. \u201cWhere did the pain start, Peter? And where is it now?\u201d</p><p>The kid reluctantly loosed his hold around his stomach and moved a shaky hand to his upper abdomen. \u201cStarted here and\u2026\u201d, he pointed at his lower right side. \u201cWent there.\u201d</p><p>Bruce looked up at Tony, the worry now prominent on his features, and Tony\u2019s heart jumped in his throat.</p><p>\u201cAlright, can you lay on your back for me? I\u2019ll just to do a quick exam.\u201d</p><p>Tony helped Peter lay back, moving blankets and pillows out of the way so he would lay on a flat surface. When he wanted to offer Peter his hand to hold onto, Bruce stopped him.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that right now.\u201d he held his gaze for a moment and Tony eventually settled for running his hand through Peter\u2019s sweat-soaked curls instead.</p><p>Bruce started palpating Peter\u2019s abdomen, going downwards from his upper left side and keeping a close eye on the kid\u2019s facial expression. When he couldn\u2019t provoke a reaction, he did the same on his other side and Peter visibly flinched under Tony\u2019s touch when Bruce reached his right lower quadrant.</p><p>Bruce\u2019s hands hovered over Peter\u2019s stomach for a moment. \u201cPeter, I will push in now and I need you to let me know if you feel more pain when I push down or when I release, okay?\u201d Peter went absolutely rigid, but nodded anyway.</p><p>Tony crouched down next to the bed, one hand still tangled in the kid\u2019s hair and running his other up and down his arm in reassurance.</p><p>Bruce pushed down on Peter\u2019s stomach and the kid\u2019s breath stocked, pain evident on his features. Tony glanced at Bruce, who was keeping a close eye on Peter\u2019s facial expression and abruptly pulled his hands back.</p><p>Peter lounged forward, letting out a suppressed yell.</p><p>His hands immediately curled back around his abdomen, pulling his knees up to his chest again and he made a sound that sounded almost like a whimper.</p><p>Horrified, Tony pulled the boy\u2019s head against his shoulder, whispering comforting words into his hear while Peter curled up against him.</p><p>\u201cTony\u201d, he glanced up at Bruce, who was looking down at the boy with a concerned frown. \u201cWe should get him to the Medbay now. If this actually is appendicitis, we shouldn\u2019t waste more time than we have.\u201d</p><p>Tony felt his heart sink. Appendicitis. How did he not think of that sooner?</p><p>Suddenly, Peter let out a soft groan and Tony\u2019s attention immediately snapped back to the kid, still curled up miserably against Tony, face screwed up in agony.</p><p>\u201cCan I- Can I touch him?\u201d Tony\u2019s hands hovered over Peter\u2019s body, not sure where to place them.</p><p>\u201cYeah, just try to be gentle.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t be more gentle if he tried, lifting him up with one hand under his legs and the other behind his back, but Peter still flinched and Tony could see him bite his lip to stop himself from making a sound.</p><p>Involuntarily, Tony made a soft cooing noise, pulling the kid close to his chest. He met Bruce\u2019s eyes over Peters curls and nodded, telling him to lead the way.</p><p>Peter buried his head in Tony\u2019s neck while they made their way down to the Medbay, and Tony could feel the kid\u2019s skin burn hot against his own, breathing flat and labored and he tightened his hold.</p><p>Appendicitis wasn\u2019t something to tread lightly, a rupturing could lead to peritonitis and peritonitis was fatal if left untreated. He hadn\u2019t even considered for the kid to have anything worse than the stomach flu, even when Peter told him that the pain had shifted. If the kid ended up having to stay in the hospital even only one day longer than necessary it would be entirely Tony\u2019s fault and he already hated himself for it.</p><p>In the elevator, Bruce glanced over at his friend. \u201cStop that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Tony asked, eyes trained on the kid while he rubbed comforting circles into Peter\u2019s skin with his thumb.</p><p>\u201cEspecially in the first 24 hours, appendicitis is congruent with gastroenteritis. The stomach pain, the vomiting, the fever? It could have easily been the stomach flu as well, you had no way of knowing.\u201d he reminded Tony softly.</p><p>\u201cHe told me it shifted, Bruce\u201d, Tony muttered. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t think anything of it. And now look where we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn our way to the Medbay, exactly where we would have been if you called me 2 hours ago. Peter\u2019s gonna be fine. You\u2019re no medical doctor, Tony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither are you.\u201d</p><p>Bruce smirked lightly. \u201cWell, I was in Calcutta, wasn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>The elevator opened and Tony hurried out first, Bruce following close behind. </p><p>Peter had turned his head at the conversation, but Tony had thought him too out of it to follow it until he muttered a bleary \u201cNot yer fault, Mr Stark\u201d into his shirt.</p><p>Tony huffed lightly. This kid.</p><p>Apparently, Bruce had announced their arrival to medical, because there was an entire medical team on standby as soon as they reached the Medbay.</p><p>Helen Cho herself took Peter from them and Tony gently went to place him on the gurney, but the kid was holding on to his mentor and actually let out a whimper at the sudden loss of contact. Tony\u2019s heart clenched and he immediately took Peter\u2019s hand in his own, running his other hand through his hair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right here, kiddo, it\u2019s alright. You\u2019re gonna be alright.\u201d</p><p>True to his words, Tony stayed with Peter through the sonography to confirm his diagnosis and held his hand while the doctors inserted an IV, all while he kept stroking his hair and muttering comforting words he wouldn\u2019t remember later.</p><p>Not even half an hour later, they were prepping Peter for surgery.</p><p>The kid was considerably calmer after he\u2019d been given medication for the pain, but he could barely keep his eyes open even though he was making an remarkable effort.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright, underoos\u201d, he muttered, leaning over Peter so he would blend out the nurses running around them and keep the kid\u2019s eyes on him. He cupped Peter\u2019s face in his hand. \u201cYou go be lazy now, catch some shut-eye while Helen does her job, hm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. You\u2019re stayin\u2019 with me, right?\u201d Peter muttered, clearly out of it while he nuzzled into Tony\u2019s hand, blinking up at him owlishly.</p><p>Tony\u2019s face softened into a smile. \u201cYeah, kiddo. Sure am.\u201d</p><p><b>My very tiny, very cute taglist of very tiny, very cute people <i>(let me know if you want to be tagged for future works)</i>:</b> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/msso_u5wdayid8RPmp92cFA\">@baloobird</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0iCdcsEb01EpfuYf_RdKhQ\">@toomuchtoread33</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mS5US6BkfabqpTb4ij1wOBQ\">@fourleafchloe</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFW6CHhGVjqpQu42bZcpQFQ\">@gabesgoldwings</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVwPiBZc3eXCp9yxNzX0qUw\">@starbirks</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJAxF9e_BYEJWUGtrjifSYQ\">@yepokokfine</a> \u200b<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYiq-_1m_wf0NHssmGyuazw\">@thatmarvelstan</a> </p>",

When he couldn\u2019t provoke a reaction, he did the same on his other side and Peter visibly flinched under Tony\u2019s touch when Bruce reached his right lower quadrant.</p><p>Bruce\u2019s hands hovered over Peter\u2019s stomach for a moment. \u201cPeter, I will push in now and I need you to let me know if you feel more pain when I push down or when I release, okay?\u201d Peter went absolutely rigid, but nodded anyway.</p><p>Tony crouched down next to the bed, one hand still tangled in the kid\u2019s hair and running his other up and down his arm in reassurance.</p><p>Bruce pushed down on Peter\u2019s stomach and the kid\u2019s breath stocked, pain evident on his features. Tony glanced at Bruce, who was keeping a close eye on Peter\u2019s facial expression and abruptly pulled his hands back.</p><p>Peter lounged forward, letting out a suppressed yell.</p><p>His hands immediately curled back around his abdomen, pulling his knees up to his chest again and he made a sound that sounded almost like a whimper.</p><p>Horrified, Tony pulled the boy\u2019s head against his shoulder, whispering comforting words into his hear while Peter curled up against him.</p><p>\u201cTony\u201d, he glanced up at Bruce, who was looking down at the boy with a concerned frown. \u201cWe should get him to the Medbay now. If this actually is appendicitis, we shouldn\u2019t waste more time than we have.\u201d</p><p>Tony felt his heart sink. Appendicitis. How did he not think of that sooner?</p><p>Suddenly, Peter let out a soft groan and Tony\u2019s attention immediately snapped back to the kid, still curled up miserably against Tony, face screwed up in agony.</p><p>\u201cCan I- Can I touch him?\u201d Tony\u2019s hands hovered over Peter\u2019s body, not sure where to place them.</p><p>\u201cYeah, just try to be gentle.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t be more gentle if he tried, lifting him up with one hand under his legs and the other behind his back, but Peter still flinched and Tony could see him bite his lip to stop himself from making a sound.</p><p>Involuntarily, Tony made a soft cooing noise, pulling the kid close to his chest. He met Bruce\u2019s eyes over Peters curls and nodded, telling him to lead the way.</p><p>Peter buried his head in Tony\u2019s neck while they made their way down to the Medbay, and Tony could feel the kid\u2019s skin burn hot against his own, breathing flat and labored and he tightened his hold.</p><p>Appendicitis wasn\u2019t something to tread lightly, a rupturing could lead to peritonitis and peritonitis was fatal if left untreated. He hadn\u2019t even considered for the kid to have anything worse than the stomach flu, even when Peter told him that the pain had shifted. If the kid ended up having to stay in the hospital even only one day longer than necessary it would be entirely Tony\u2019s fault and he already hated himself for it.</p><p>In the elevator, Bruce glanced over at his friend. \u201cStop that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Tony asked, eyes trained on the kid while he rubbed comforting circles into Peter\u2019s skin with his thumb.</p><p>\u201cEspecially in the first 24 hours, appendicitis is congruent with gastroenteritis. The stomach pain, the vomiting, the fever? It could have easily been the stomach flu as well, you had no way of knowing.\u201d he reminded Tony softly.</p><p>\u201cHe told me it shifted, Bruce\u201d, Tony muttered. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t think anything of it. And now look where we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn our way to the Medbay, exactly where we would have been if you called me 2 hours ago. Peter\u2019s gonna be fine. You\u2019re no medical doctor, Tony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither are you.\u201d</p><p>Bruce smirked lightly. \u201cWell, I was in Calcutta, wasn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>The elevator opened and Tony hurried out first, Bruce following close behind. </p><p>Peter had turned his head at the conversation, but Tony had thought him too out of it to follow it until he muttered a bleary \u201cNot yer fault, Mr Stark\u201d into his shirt.</p><p>Tony huffed lightly. This kid.</p><p>Apparently, Bruce had announced their arrival to medical, because there was an entire medical team on standby as soon as they reached the Medbay.</p><p>Helen Cho herself took Peter from them and Tony gently went to place him on the gurney, but the kid was holding on to his mentor and actually let out a whimper at the sudden loss of contact. Tony\u2019s heart clenched and he immediately took Peter\u2019s hand in his own, running his other hand through his hair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right here, kiddo, it\u2019s alright. You\u2019re gonna be alright.\u201d</p><p>True to his words, Tony stayed with Peter through the sonography to confirm his diagnosis and held his hand while the doctors inserted an IV, all while he kept stroking his hair and muttering comforting words he wouldn\u2019t remember later.</p><p>Not even half an hour later, they were prepping Peter for surgery.</p><p>The kid was considerably calmer after he\u2019d been given medication for the pain, but he could barely keep his eyes open even though he was making an remarkable effort.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright, underoos\u201d, he muttered, leaning over Peter so he would blend out the nurses running around them and keep the kid\u2019s eyes on him. He cupped Peter\u2019s face in his hand. \u201cYou go be lazy now, catch some shut-eye while Helen does her job, hm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. You\u2019re stayin\u2019 with me, right?\u201d Peter muttered, clearly out of it while he nuzzled into Tony\u2019s hand, blinking up at him owlishly.</p><p>Tony\u2019s face softened into a smile. \u201cYeah, kiddo. Sure am.\u201d</p><p><b>My very tiny, very cute taglist of very tiny, very cute people <i>(let me know if you want to be tagged for future works)</i>:</b> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/msso_u5wdayid8RPmp92cFA\">@baloobird</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0iCdcsEb01EpfuYf_RdKhQ\">@toomuchtoread33</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mS5US6BkfabqpTb4ij1wOBQ\">@fourleafchloe</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFW6CHhGVjqpQu42bZcpQFQ\">@gabesgoldwings</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVwPiBZc3eXCp9yxNzX0qUw\">@starbirks</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJAxF9e_BYEJWUGtrjifSYQ\">@yepokokfine</a> \u200b<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYiq-_1m_wf0NHssmGyuazw\">@thatmarvelstan</a> </p></p>",

He hadn&rsquo;t even considered for the kid to have anything worse than the stomach flu, even when Peter told him that the pain had shifted. If the kid ended up having to stay in the hospital even only one day longer than necessary it would be entirely Tony&rsquo;s fault and he already hated himself for it.</p><p>In the elevator, Bruce glanced over at his friend. &ldquo;Stop that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; Tony asked, eyes trained on the kid while he rubbed comforting circles into Peter&rsquo;s skin with his thumb.</p><p>&ldquo;Especially in the first 24 hours, appendicitis is congruent with gastroenteritis. The stomach pain, the vomiting, the fever? It could have easily been the stomach flu as well, you had no way of knowing.&rdquo; he reminded Tony softly.</p><p>&ldquo;He told me it shifted, Bruce&rdquo;, Tony muttered. &ldquo;And I didn&rsquo;t think anything of it. And now look where we are.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;On our way to the Medbay, exactly where we would have been if you called me 2 hours ago. Peter&rsquo;s gonna be fine. You&rsquo;re no medical doctor, Tony.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Neither are you.&rdquo;</p><p>Bruce smirked lightly. &ldquo;Well, I was in Calcutta, wasn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p><p>The elevator opened and Tony hurried out first, Bruce following close behind. </p><p>Peter had turned his head at the conversation, but Tony had thought him too out of it to follow it until he muttered a bleary &ldquo;Not yer fault, Mr Stark&rdquo; into his shirt.</p><p>Tony huffed lightly. This kid.</p><p>Apparently, Bruce had announced their arrival to medical, because there was an entire medical team on standby as soon as they reached the Medbay.</p><p>Helen Cho herself took Peter from them and Tony gently went to place him on the gurney, but the kid was holding on to his mentor and actually let out a whimper at the sudden loss of contact. Tony&rsquo;s heart clenched and he immediately took Peter&rsquo;s hand in his own, running his other hand through his hair.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m right here, kiddo, it&rsquo;s alright. You&rsquo;re gonna be alright.&rdquo;</p><p>True to his words, Tony stayed with Peter through the sonography to confirm his diagnosis and held his hand while the doctors inserted an IV, all while he kept stroking his hair and muttering comforting words he wouldn&rsquo;t remember later.</p><p>Not even half an hour later, they were prepping Peter for surgery.</p><p>The kid was considerably calmer after he&rsquo;d been given medication for the pain, but he could barely keep his eyes open even though he was making an remarkable effort.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright, underoos&rdquo;, he muttered, leaning over Peter so he would blend out the nurses running around them and keep the kid&rsquo;s eyes on him. He cupped Peter&rsquo;s face in his hand. &ldquo;You go be lazy now, catch some shut-eye while Helen does her job, hm?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hmm. You&rsquo;re stayin&rsquo; with me, right?&rdquo; Peter muttered, clearly out of it while he nuzzled into Tony&rsquo;s hand, blinking up at him owlishly.</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s face softened into a smile. &ldquo;Yeah, kiddo. Sure am.&rdquo;</p><p><b>My very tiny, very cute taglist of very tiny, very cute people <i>(let me know if you want to be tagged for future works)</i>:</b> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msso_u5wdayid8RPmp92cFA\">@baloobird</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0iCdcsEb01EpfuYf_RdKhQ\">@toomuchtoread33</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mS5US6BkfabqpTb4ij1wOBQ\">@fourleafchloe</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFW6CHhGVjqpQu42bZcpQFQ\">@gabesgoldwings</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVwPiBZc3eXCp9yxNzX0qUw\">@starbirks</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJAxF9e_BYEJWUGtrjifSYQ\">@yepokokfine</a> &#8203;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYiq-_1m_wf0NHssmGyuazw\">@thatmarvelstan</a> </p></p>",

The cold, suffocating dark goes on forever and we are alone. Live our lives, lacking anything better to do. Devise reason later. Born from oblivion; bear children, hell-bound as ourselves, go into oblivion. There is nothing else. Existence is random. Has no pattern save what we imagine after staring at it for too long. No meaning save what we choose to impose. This rudderless world is not shaped by vague metaphysical forces. It is not God who kills the children. Not fate that butchers them or destiny that feeds them to the dogs. It\u2019s us. Only us. Streets stank of fire. The void breathed hard on my heart, turning its illusions to ice, shattering them. Was reborn then, free to scrawl own design on this morally blank world.\"\n<br>- - - Rorschach; Watchmen by Alan Moore",

Barry makes a\nconfused face, \u201cDoes he not like me or something?\u201d he asks you in a hushed\ntone.</p><p>\u201cUh I don\u2019t\nknow Barry, maybe he\u2019s having an off day? We don\u2019t really know him so it could\nbe anything, don\u2019t think too much into it.\u201d You reply, giving him a half smile\nas you turn to follow Nat who said she has something for you to change into.</p><p>Once you and\nNat are alone you decide to ask her why Peter is acting so weird towards Barry\nand you.</p><p>\u201cHere, I hope\nthose are okay.\u201d She says kindly, passing me a pair of black leggings and a t\nshirt. \u201cThank you, they\u2019re perfect, this suit can get a bit uncomfortable after\nwearing it for a long while.\u201d You say as you take the articles of clothing for\nher and going into the bathroom, she pointed out to change. Once, you were done\nyou went and sat next to her, ready to find out some stuff.</p><p>\u201cHey uh\u2026can I\nask you something?\u201d you question nervously. \u201cYeah sure, what\u2019s going on?\u201d she\nsmiles.</p><p>\u201cIs Peter\nokay? Because he seemed so be giving Barry the cold shoulder, but he doesn\u2019t\neven know him or us\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought Peter\nor Tony would\u2019ve mentioned something to you when they saw you\u2026\u201d she said with\nastonishment.</p><p>\u201cMentioned\nwhat?\u201d You early asked, moving closer to her.</p><p>\u201cY/N Stark\nwasn\u2019t just Tony\u2019s daughter. She was Peter\u2019s girlfriend too.\u201d She replied with\nher eyes fixated on yours. Looking into them to see any reaction and she does,\npain, hurt and sadness cloud your features. You finally understood.</p><p>Barry and you\nwalk in with your suits in hand, changed into normal clothes now. \u201cY/N, Barry,\nwho made your suits?\u201d Tony asks, rubbing his hands together.</p><p>\u201cOh, our\nfriend Cisco did actually.\u201d Barry says, giving Tony a toothy grin.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\ninteresting and they don\u2019t catch on fire when you run?\u201d he questions you two. </p><p>\u201cUh no, I\nthink they\u2019re made with a reinforced tripolymer, Cisco said that they protect\nus against abrasion and it\u2019s enormously heat-resistant.\u201d Barry answers.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\ninteresting\u2026\u201d Tony says as he and Barry start discussing the suits more, you\ntake this opportunity to slip away and speak to Peter.</p><p>\u201cHey Peter, can\nyou come here for a minute I need your help.\u201d You call out, making up some\nexcuse so you could talk to him in private.</p><p>\u201cUh yeah sure\u201d\nhe complies and follows you out the room.</p><p>Unsure of\nwhere to go, you obviously didn\u2019t think this through, Peter points towards a room\nyou\u2019re guessing is his. You simply nod and walk in, shutting the door as soon\nas he enters.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t\nyou tell me?\u2019 you question, a frown appearing on your face.</p><p>\u201cTell you what?\u201d\nHe shrugs.</p><p>\u201cAbout her Peter.\u201d\nYou say, crossing your arms.</p><p>\u201cI did. Don\u2019t\nyou remember?\u201d He says dryly.</p><p>\u201cPeter, I mean\nwhy didn\u2019t you tell me about you and her\u2026\u201d You sigh, sitting on the bed next to\nhim, making him face you.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you\nexpect me to say?\u201d he scoffs, \u201cYou look like my dead girlfriend and now I see\nyou with that guy and it hurts.\u201d He sneered; hands squeezed into fists as his eyes\nburned with tears welling up. </p><p>\u201cPeter\u2026Barry\nisn\u2019t-\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you\nexpect me to act huh? It\u2019s like watching the girl I love, love somebody else\nand not me!\u201d he lowers his head and you watch as the tears fall from his eyes,\nonto his hands.
