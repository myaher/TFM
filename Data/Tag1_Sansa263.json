        "body": "<p>This is for my baby <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlTfK4ggtX76l7s4JyOzNqg\">@octaviahales</a> who has been giving me the best prompts. Ah I loved writing this one. Hope you enjoy.\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p><i>Promise me, </i>the text message said.\u00a0</p><p>They ignored it, like always.\u00a0</p><p>Jon had been all bravado, but that was because he wasn\u2019t going to be the one to face her wrath. That would fall to him, which was why there was a small box of lavender donuts on his lap on top of the container holding the lemon pie he\u2019d picked up from Nan\u2019s for Sansa.\u00a0</p><p>His little sister had gone through another break-up. He had been assured by Ella that it was not the worst one by far - that one still haunted them all - instead this had been <i>mere </i>cheating.\u00a0</p><p>He had been assured that Ella <i>had </i>it. That she and Sansa were going to have a night in and that he and Jon were not needed <i>thank you very much</i> and that she would call them tomorrow to let them know the degree to which they needed to beat up Harry Hardyng but that until then they should sit tight because Sansa needed <i>affection </i>and <i>alcohol </i>and not to hear about all the ways in which Harry was a deadman and how he never deserved her and how they had all told her so (he\u2019d like to say she made them sound worse than they were but in truth, Ella was never wrong). She had, however, stipulated that Grey Wind and Ghost\u2019s presence was desired so she had picked them up from his and Jon\u2019s apartment an hour before on her way to pick-up pizza.\u00a0</p><p>Jon had simply scoffed at the text message from Ella, grabbing his coat and a bottle of Sansa\u2019s favorite wine that they always kept a case of, as well as his old Direwolves football sweatshirt that he always brought her on occasions such as this. After Ramsay Jon had suggested she keep the sweater after she spent a week straight wearing it, but Sansa had assured him that it would lose its magic that way and that he should hold onto it for safe keeping.\u00a0</p><p>Now, if you are wondering <i>why </i>exactly Sansa would have been dating someone else only to be<i> </i>in this position, when she had a man who always made sure to have her favorite wine, and had a dog that treated Sansa like she was his baby, and who would wrap her up in his arms the way she wrapped herself in his sweatshirt if she only asked him to, you would be in very good company.\u00a0</p><p>The answer, however, was sadly that <i>despite </i>the fact that Jon Snow had loved Sansa Stark ever since he met her after his first peewee football game at the tender age of eleven he had never actually <i>told </i>her so.\u00a0</p><p>Sansa had taken a little longer to realise her feelings for Jon. It was a whole week later in fact when they rode on the tilt-a-whirl together at the Winterfell Carnival and he\u2019d held her hand and hadn\u2019t told anyone that she\u2019d been afraid. She, of course, had never told him this either and so she found herself in a series of relationships that went from the very boring to the very terrifying.\u00a0</p><p>At the end of each of them Jon was always there. Along with him, but he was her big brother and had never been able to stand it when she was upset, and Ella, her best friend and the ultimate love of her life.\u00a0</p><p>By now there was a routine to things.</p><p>Ella always told them to be calm, and not charge in, with one exception, and they always ignored her.\u00a0</p><p>Jon was fearless when it came to Ella because she gave him a <i>pass </i>because even though Sansa didn\u2019t know that he was in love with her, Ella did, and she knew how much more acutely he felt each of these break-ups, because he knew that if he only had the chance that Sansa would never cry again. She would never be cheated on or talked down to, she would never have to wonder because he\u2019d tell her every day, that she was the one, the only one, that he was hers forever and if she\u2019d only tell him how, he would do everything in his power to make her happy. He\u2019d tell her every day, if he only could get the courage to tell her once.\u00a0</p><p>Robb, on the other hand, did not get a pass from Ella. She was all bark and no bite, and wasn\u2019t much bark, but even still he couldn\u2019t stand it when she looked at him with anything other than love in her eyes. Because the thing was, Jon was not the only man who\u2019d fallen in love at the tender age of eleven, the only difference was that Robb hadn\u2019t been able to stand it past the age of seventeen, when he\u2019d finally asked Ella to be his. The truth was, she very rarely looked at him with anything short of love, even when she was frustrated with him, because he had stolen her heart when he recovered her stolen kite and she had never once considered asking for it back.\u00a0</p><p>Even still, he felt safer with the lavender donuts in hand.\u00a0</p><!-- more --><p>They parked the car and walked in the lobby of the girls\u2019 apartment building, waving hello to Sid the night doorman and taking the elevator up to the penthouse apartment that Ella had been gifted to her upon her graduation from university.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo you smell that?,\u201d Jon asked as the elevator doors opened to the small vestibule.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSmells like -,\u201d Robb said, but stopped dead when he saw smoke coming from the door to the girls\u2019 apartment.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSeven hells,\u201d Jon groaned and Robb grabbed his key and let them into the apartment.\u00a0</p><p>They barrelled into the foyer only to find Sansa there, her hair in two pigtail braids, in yoga pants, a sports bra and fluffy slippers utilising a fire extinguisher against a flaming rubbish can.\u00a0</p><p>Robb was about to move forward to pull her back from the flames when Ella came running in wearing a thin white tank top and a pair of his boxers, her hair up in a high ponytail and what looked to be a purple face mask on. She was holding a large bowl of water and Ghost and Grey Wind were trailing her, the latter of whom had what seemed to be a singed dishtowel hanging out of his mouth.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat are you two doing here?,\u201d she demanded when she saw them. \u201cI said I had it under control!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis!??,\u201d Robb demanded back, \u201cThis is what you consider <i>under control!?</i>\u201d</p><p>Ella dumped the bowl of water on the flames which quickly petered out and gave him a <i>ta-da </i>expression.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBy the <i>gods</i>,\u201d Sansa said, doubling over. \u201cWe really should have seen this coming. I mean, this is <i>exactly </i>what happens on that episode of Friends when they do the cleanse\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cCleanse?,\u201d Jon asked, and Robb appreciated that his eyes stayed on her face, rather than her exposed skin.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cA boyfriend cleanse,\u201d Ella said matter-of-factly, as though this was something that normal people did all the time.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat in Seven Hells is a boyfriend cleanse?,\u201d Robb asked.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLook!,\u201d Sansa said, holding up her hand, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be all judgey I at least need to go put on a shirt first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat idea,\u201d Robb nodded.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou have a lot of opinions for someone who was<i> not invited</i>,\u201d Ella growled at him and he wondered if now was the right time to bring out the donuts.</p><p>\u201cWait uh\u2026,\u201d Jon said, reaching into his bag, \u201cI mean put on whatever you want, or don\u2019t,\u201d he said and Robb fixed him with a look, \u201cI mean\u2026 that\u2019s\u2026 just here\u2026\u201d</p><p>With that he offered his sweatshirt to her like it was a dirty tissue that might disgust her, but Sansa reached for it like it was an offering from the gods. She pulled it on and the hem fell to mid-thigh and the sleeves were far too long but she wrapped her arms around herself and he could practically see the knots in her back uncoiling.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo this cleanse?,\u201d Robb asked them, trying to keep his voice free from judgment.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBasically,\u201d Sansa said, \u201cElla thought it would be a good idea to burn a bunch of things that I still had from exes as a way of like\u2026recalibrating.\u201d</p><p>Robb and Jon looked at Ella and she put her hands on her hips and raised her eyebrows as though to say <i>well the only thing you two have ever done is punch her ex-boyfriends</i>. Robb would have protested but it was true and even he could admit that that did more to recalibrate his and Jon\u2019s feelings than Sansa\u2019s.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see what we\u2019ve got here,\u201d Jon said as though he were a detective, grabbing an umbrella and crouching down and picking up a scarf out of the bin with the tip of it, \u201cJoffrey,\u201d he picked out a singed photograph and said, \u201cDickon,\u201d and then picked out a grey t shirt.\u00a0</p><p>Robb stepped forward and snatched it up.\u00a0</p><p>He turned to Ella accusingly, \u201cIs this\u2026 is this my old Direwolves t shirt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI felt left out,\u201d Ella protested bashfully.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLeft out?,\u201d Robb asked with a grin.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t <i>have </i>any ex-boyfriends and unless you plan on keeping up this judgy stuff I don\u2019t think I <i>will </i>have any so\u2026,\u201d she mumbled.\u00a0</p><p>He stepped forward to kiss her until she forgave him but he stopped short when he saw how viscous the face mask was.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCan you take this gunk off your face so that I can kiss you?,\u201d he asked her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d Ella said with a grin, \u201cI\u2019ve got a better idea\u2026\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>Ten minutes later after all the windows had been cracked and Robb and Jon had been poured margaritas of their own, they all settled onto the sectional.\u00a0</p><p>Another episode of Friends was on and Ghost was splayed on Sansa while Grey Wind peered curiously over Ella\u2019s shoulder as she applied Robb\u2019s green face mask.\u00a0</p><p>The one Sansa had put on him was pink and had been nice and cool when she\u2019d applied it\u00a0 thoughtfully but was now starting to dry. His nose was itchy but she had smiled to herself the whole time she\u2019d put it on him and he\u2019d wear it all night if it made her giggle every time she looked over at him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCan you stop whining and just be a man for five minutes?,\u201d Ella asked Robb as he complained about the smell.\u00a0</p><p>He didn\u2019t like the smell of coconut but Ella had told him it was meant to <i>rejuvenate </i>tired skin and he\u2019d been working so many hours lately at the family company that he\u2019d acquiesced.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCome now, you know I can be a man for longer than that\u2026,\u201d Robb said with a grin, pulling her closer to him by her waist.</p><p>\u201cRobb!,\u201d she giggled and Jon groaned.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSeriously guys,\u201d Sansa said in agreement, \u201cNot to be <i>that </i>person but its not all that nice for you to flaunt your domestic bliss in front of my broken heart.\u201d</p><p>That reminded them all why they were there in the first place and Robb accepted the rest of his face mask in silence.\u00a0</p><p>Ella hopped up to wash her hands and turned to him, \u201cJon can you help me in the kitchen for a second?\u201d</p><p>Robb shrugged at him and he got up, scratching Ghost\u2019s head on the way.\u00a0</p><p>He walked into the kitchen to find Ella washing her hands of the face mask and he opened the pizza box on the counter and grabbed a slice.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me I shouldn\u2019t be here, little one,\u201d he warned her softly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d she promised, grabbing a dish towel and drying her hands.\u00a0</p><p>She hopped up on the counter and sighed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHarry\u2019s such a <i>fucking </i>ass. Do you know it\u2019s not even <i>Sansa </i>he\u2019s been cheating on? It\u2019s the girl he\u2019s been dating since before<i> </i>he <i>met</i> Sansa. <i>He made SANSA THE OTHER WOMAN!</i>,\u201d she raged.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe can hear you!,\u201d Sansa called from the living room, \u201cAND I PREFER THE TERM MISTRESS.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoted!,\u201d Ella called back to her and then gave him an <i>oh shit </i>expression that in spite of everything made him smile.</p><p>\u201cHarry\u2019s an ass,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cWe know this, we\u2019ve <i>always </i>known this. The only person who <i>didn\u2019t </i>is that beautiful girl sitting on the couch in there.\u201d</p><p>Ella nodded and reached her hand out. He handed her the slice of pizza and she took a small bite and handed it back to him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI think she did know,\u201d she whispered to him. He stepped closer to her and leaned his hip against the counter. \u201cI think she\u2019s known about all of them\u2026 I mean\u2026 not the specifics of course, she\u2019s too smart to put herself into\u2026 the point is\u2026 even if they had all just been nice boring guys like Dickon\u2026 I think she\u2019s always known that the relationships have been doomed from the start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why-,\u201d Jon started.</p><p>\u201cBecause of all the things you\u2019ve done to protect her, you\u2019ve never done the simplest one of all,\u201d Ella said, \u201cJust tell her, Jon. Just <i>tell </i>her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell her what?,\u201d Jon evaded.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cJonathan Elliot Snow so help me,\u201d she said with an annoyed sigh.\u00a0</p><p>He ran to the other side of the kitchen and grabbed the small box and walked back over to her, opening it, \u201cLavender donut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy favorite!,\u201d Ella exclaimed giddily. \u201cI take it all back you\u2019re the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything for you,\u201d he said.\u00a0</p><p>Robb may kill him but Ella was <i>way </i>more frightening.\u00a0</p><p>She bit into one and chewed thoughtfully, a contented smile on her face. She broke off a piece and handed it to him and he ate it slowly as well, buying time.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying she shouldn\u2019t just pull it together and tell you too,\u201d Ella said quietly, \u201cShe is a strong, beautiful woman and she should have confidence in that but she <i>doesn\u2019t</i>. And I don\u2019t pretend that any of this is your fault because it isn\u2019t, of <i>course </i>it isn\u2019t, but you are the <i>only</i> person who has the power to keep her from getting her heart broken again. The only one in the whole world. That means you basically have a superpower and its really foolish to withhold using a superpower when it can help someone else, someone that you <i>love. </i>Don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Jon looked at her and took the rest of the donut out of her hand and shoved it in his mouth. She smacked him on the arm but went into the box and grabbed out a piece of another and watched him. He tried manfully to get the bite down but there was just so much of it. She looked at him with a grin and that made him more determined so he swallowed it with a large, admittedly painful, gulp.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell done,\u201d she said with a nod.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he coughed. \u201cIsn\u2019t it\u2026 wrong? To like\u2026 swoop now?\u201d</p><p>That was part of the problem. Sansa was never single for long. It wasn\u2019t like she <i>got around </i>or anything, not that there was anything wrong with that, she was just a serial monogamist. The trouble was, all the guys she picked were total losers.\u00a0</p><p>Jon, in spite of threatening each and every one of them, was not the kind of guy to try to steal another man\u2019s girl, especially when he wasn\u2019t totally sure that she wanted him to. There were signs of course, that she <i>might</i>, but he forgot all about those whenever she showed up with another waste of space on her arm.\u00a0</p><p>Robb and Ella were adamant though that she loved him too and if anyone would know it would be them. They had, after all, known about him for as long as he could remember even though he\u2019d never come out and said it.\u00a0</p><p>Well never soberly anyway. He and Ella had a drunken sleepover once while the Starks were on a family vacation in Braavos and after she\u2019d plied him with whiskey he had confessed it to her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not suggesting you just go lunge at her,\u201d Ella told him with a roll of her eyes, then smiled impishly, \u201cThough if that\u2019s your move then I can keep Robb <i>very busy </i>while you do so -\u201c</p><p>\u201cGross,\u201d he cut in and she giggled.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBut maybe\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026 ask her to dinner? Take her for a walk? Casually mention that you\u2019ve been in love with her for most of your life and that you\u2019ll be in love with her for the rest of it and that it would be all together better if she would agree to be the mother of your children\u2026,\u201d Ella suggested.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cVery casual,\u201d Jon agreed.</p><p>Ella giggled and hopped off the counter, tugging his arm.\u00a0</p><p>They went back into the living room to find the two eldest Stark siblings reclined fully on the couch, chuckling at whatever Chandler was saying.</p><p>\u201cJon got me lavender donuts if you guys want some,\u201d Ella said to them as she went over to wear Robb was sitting and settled in front of him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow nice of him,\u201d Robb said with a glare for him as he let Ella in between his legs and pulled her back against his chest.\u00a0</p><p>Jon fought the urge to stick his tongue out at him and sat down next to Sansa and tugged one of her braids gently.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s lemon pie for you too,\u201d he said softly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Sansa said with a smile. Her smile fell and she looked at him skittishly, before hesitantly pressing her cheek to his shoulder, \u201cThanks for coming,\u201d she said sadly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019d keep me away,\u201d he told her, leaning his head on top of hers. She wrapped her arms around his and shifted so she leaned against him entirely. He breathed in her familiar smell of lilacs and fought the urge to kiss her head. He settled for saying, \u201cAnything for you, you know that.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t entirely sure that Ella was right. He wasn\u2019t sure that he had a superpower or anything. The only thing that he was certain of was that he loved Sansa Stark more than anything in this world, and that he wasn\u2019t sure he could watch her heart break once more.\u00a0</p><p>He looked over at Ella and nodded. <i>I\u2019ll do it</i>, he told her silently.\u00a0</p><p>She smiled at him, <i>Thank you. </i>And winked, <i>Got get \u2018em tiger.\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cCome on, Robb, let\u2019s go get that off your face,\u201d she said, gesturing to his face mask.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBut this is the-,\u201d Robb started.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo you want your skin to peel off?,\u201d Ella asked him curiously.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo!,\u201d Robb exclaimed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell then,\u201d Ella said and got off the couch and pulled Robb with her.\u00a0</p><p>They disappeared and Jon tried to focus on the television.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCan that\u2026 she was just kidding right?,\u201d he asked, touching his face to his own mask.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah you can just peel it off whenever, you\u2019re skin will stay put. Promise,\u201d Sansa said and he could hear her smile.\u00a0</p><p>He picked at the edges of the mask and pulled it off.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow do I look?,\u201d he asked her.\u00a0</p><p>She looked up at him and grinned, \u201c<i>Beautiful,</i>\u201d and then settled her head back against him.\u00a0</p><p>He took hold of her hand and pressed a solemn kiss to the back of it. She looked up at him with a question in those blue eyes of hers and he took a deep breath.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cJon?,\u201d she asked with a gulp.\u00a0</p><p>He was looking down at her with the most beautiful and caring pair of charcoal eyes she\u2019d ever known.\u00a0</p><p>It felt so right sitting here with him. He smelled so good and he felt like home and even though all she wanted was to gnaw on his jaw she could get past that and just accept him for what he was, one of the best friends she\u2019d ever had.\u00a0</p><p>He was the love of her life too, of that she was certain, but there was no reason for him to know that. It wasn\u2019t really any of his business.\u00a0</p><p>And then he\u2019d pressed a kiss to the back of her hand. His moustache had tickled her but all she really felt was the warm steady press of his lips, the slight exhale when he let her hand drop down again. Though he didn\u2019t release it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou look tired,\u201d he said sadly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh Jon,\u201d she said as breezily as she could muster, \u201cHave I taught you nothing about how to treat a girl? You can\u2019t just go telling a girl she looks tired, you might as well tell her she looks awful.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and sighed and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not your face, this face has never looked anything short of lovely,\u201d he released her hand now and pressed the pad of his thumb to the apple of her cheek and swiped along the bone softly. In all her life she wasn\u2019t sure that she\u2019d ever been touched so gently. It felt almost reverent. \u201cIt\u2019s your heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can see that?,\u201d she asked skeptically.\u00a0</p><p>If he could really see into her heart she knew there was only one thing that he\u2019d find.\u00a0</p><p>He nodded, \u201cI\u2019ve been seeing it for so long. Through every guy that didn\u2019t deserve you. I never feel so helpless as when we get the call or text from Ella saying that it\u2019s happened again.\u201d</p><p>Her face grew hot, \u201cYou make me sound so pathetic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!,\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cNo Sansa\u2026 You\u2019re not. Of course you\u2019re not. There\u2019s nothing braver than giving love a chance. And I\u2019ve been a coward for far too long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the bravest man I know,\u201d she shook her head.\u00a0</p><p>He was, he really was. The bravest and strongest, but the gentlest too. He had always been so gentle with her, and Ella and Arya too. Her father called him and Robb Northern Fools proudly, knowing they were following in his tradition.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIf that were true,\u201d Jon said, \u201cI would have said this some time ago. I would have told you on the tilt-a-whirl, when you wore your hair just like this,\u201d he said, and tugged her braid gently again, \u201cI would have told you before Joffrey, before Dickon, before\u2026,\u201d he said and she felt his whole body tense. She stroked his arm comfortingly, knowing that there was one man he\u2019d never name in her presence again. \u201cI would have told you every day since because it\u2019s been true every day since - I love you Sansa Stark. I love you and I have <i>been </i>loving you each moment since the first one. And I know. I know your heart is tired and if it\u2019s too soon then I\u2019ll wait, and it\u2019s a no, a no for good, then I\u2019ll never speak of it again but you will always have me, do you hear me? I\u2019m not going anywhere, but gods Sansa, if you just let me love you the way I want to I promi-\u201c</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she nodded.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay?,\u201d he asked incredulously.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou can love me,\u201d she said, \u201cThat would be alright with me.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled at her but there were tears in his eyes. There were tears in hers too so she closed them and leaned her face up towards him blindly.\u00a0</p><p>His lips met hers as though it were perfectly easy and she knew then that he had been right. Her heart had been tired. So tired, from trying to love people she was never meant to.\u00a0</p><p>All at once though, it woke up.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>Ella woke up sandwiched between Robb and Grey Wind. Robb was spooning her and she was spooning Grey Wind and they were both snoring.\u00a0</p><p>She rubbed Grey Wind\u2019s head and sat up, going into her bathroom to wash her face and brush her teeth, knowing the pair of them could sleep for hours yet.\u00a0</p><p>When she came back out, Robb was spooning Grey Wind, the dog looking like he had died and gone to the heaven of his choice.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCome back to bed,\u201d Robb urged her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she complained, \u201cThe third time last night nearly killed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kiss it better,\u201d he promised and she felt her resolve weakening.</p><p>\u201cCome on, I\u2019ll make you bacon instead,\u201d she said.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNot exactly a fair trade,\u201d Robb said, but he sat up anyway, pulling his shirt on.\u00a0</p><p>He padded into the bathroom and brushed his teeth as well and came out and pulled her to him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy do you look better in my boxers than I do?,\u201d he asked as he looked down at her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBecause you look better <i>out </i>of them,\u201d she said lustfully.\u00a0</p><p>He leaned down and kissed her hungrily, picking her up by her butt. Even though he had worn her out the night before she wrapped her arms around his neck and pressed herself against him, deepening the kiss.\u00a0</p><p>The palm of his other hand rested against her cheek, his fingers threading into her hair and she loved him so much she could burst.\u00a0</p><p>She was about to tell him so when she felt a paw on her arm. She looked down to see Grey Wind panting in their faces.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGo away buddy,\u201d Robb said but Grey Wind looked at him firmly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMy fault,\u201d she said, scratching Grey Wind\u2019s head, \u201cI said the <i>b </i>word.\u201d</p><p>She hopped down and dragged Robb out of her room. He wrapped his arms around her and kissed her neck on the walk to the kitchen and they stopped once or twice to make out because even though they\u2019d been together for eight years they had never really learned how to stop wanting to kiss one another.\u00a0</p><p>As they got closer to the kitchen, Ella could practically smell the bacon and was surprised when she walked in to find it already sizzling in the pan.\u00a0</p><p>That wasn\u2019t the only thing though because there was Sansa Stark wearing Jon\u2019s sweatshirt and seemingly nothing else while Jon stood there wearing an apron and a pair of his boxers and they were locked in what could only been considered a truly sloppy make-out.\u00a0</p><p>She reached behind her and shielded Robb\u2019s eyes as she cleared her throat.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cElla, it\u2019s a little late for that,\u201d Robb grumbled as Jon and Sansa broke apart.\u00a0</p><p>Sansa blushed and Jon grinned and Ella squealed and Robb groaned.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo you have enough for us?,\u201d Ella asked, hoping some food would settle Robb\u2019s stomach.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAlways, little one,\u201d Jon said with a grin, clearly too delirious with happiness to care much for his best friend\u2019s (and apparent future brother-in-law\u2019s) comfort.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cRobb why don\u2019t you set the table?,\u201d she suggested. \u201cJon\u2026 I think there is some champagne in the fridge in the laundry room? I think this calls for celebratory mimosas\u2026\u201d</p><p>They both went to do her bidding and she ran and jumped at Sansa, wrapping her legs around her the way she\u2019d just had her legs around Robb.\u00a0</p><p>Sansa hugged her back, the pair of them wiggling in excitement.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay so I know that you probably want to spend every minute with Jon right now, but you\u2019ll save me some time and tell me the whole story, right?,\u201d Ella asked her and hopped down.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOf course I will,\u201d Sansa said, using some tongs to flip the bacon. \u201cWait until I tell you about his superpower\u2026\u201d</p><p>Ella giggled, \u201cNo need. I\u2019m the one who discovered it.\u201d</p><p>Sansa turned to her and said, \u201cUm\u2026I fucking hope not because it involves his tongue and a part of your body that I truly pray he\u2019s never seen\u2026\u201d</p><p>Ella looked at her and Sansa looked so smugly satisfied that Ella couldn\u2019t help the scream that erupted her from her mouth. She wrapped Sansa in her arms again and they didn\u2019t break apart until Robb and Jon collided with each other coming into the kitchen.\u00a0</p><p>Robb held the fire extinguisher and Jon had taken off the apron and was wielding it like he might smother something with it.\u00a0</p><p>Her and Sansa giggled and rolled their eyes as Robb and Jon seemed to slowly understand that they were not in fact in danger.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAt ease, gentlemen,\u201d Sansa said with a grin.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019ve got it all under control,\u201d Ella agreed.\u00a0</p><p>Robb and Jon straightened up and soon there were champagne glasses taken out and no one cared that they didn\u2019t have any orange juice because they were too busy toasting to the new couple.\u00a0</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cYou should ignore my texts more often,\u201d she whispered to Robb as they did the dishes after breakfast.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll remind you that you said that,\u201d he told her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cJust make sure you take a page out of Jon\u2019s book and bring lavender donuts with you next time that you do,\u201d she suggested.\u00a0</p><p>Robb opened his mouth as if to protest, but she cut off whatever he was going to say with a kiss. He sunk into her the way he always did and it was all the sweeter knowing that their best friends\u2019 hearts were safe, the way he\u2019d always kept hers.\u00a0</p><p><i>And they say cleanses don\u2019t work\u2026</i></p>",

She, of course, had never told him this either and so she found herself in a series of relationships that went from the very boring to the very terrifying.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At the end of each of them Jon was always there.

She would never be cheated on or talked down to, she would never have to wonder because he&rsquo;d tell her every day, that she was the one, the only one, that he was hers forever and if she&rsquo;d only tell him how, he would do everything in his power to make her happy.

She was all bark and no bite, and wasn&rsquo;t much bark, but even still he couldn&rsquo;t stand it when she looked at him with anything other than love in her eyes. Because the thing was, Jon was not the only man who&rsquo;d fallen in love at the tender age of eleven, the only difference was that Robb hadn&rsquo;t been able to stand it past the age of seventeen, when he&rsquo;d finally asked Ella to be his. The truth was, she very rarely looked at him with anything short of love, even when she was frustrated with him, because he had stolen her heart when he recovered her stolen kite and she had never once considered asking for it back.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Even still, he felt safer with the lavender donuts in hand.&nbsp;</p>\n",

She, of course, had never told him this either and so she found herself in a series of relationships that went from the very boring to the very terrifying.\u00a0</p><p>At the end of each of them Jon was always there. Along with him, but he was her big brother and had never been able to stand it when she was upset, and Ella, her best friend and the ultimate love of her life.\u00a0</p><p>By now there was a routine to things.</p><p>Ella always told them to be calm, and not charge in, with one exception, and they always ignored her.\u00a0</p><p>Jon was fearless when it came to Ella because she gave him a <i>pass </i>because even though Sansa didn\u2019t know that he was in love with her, Ella did, and she knew how much more acutely he felt each of these break-ups, because he knew that if he only had the chance that Sansa would never cry again. She would never be cheated on or talked down to, she would never have to wonder because he\u2019d tell her every day, that she was the one, the only one, that he was hers forever and if she\u2019d only tell him how, he would do everything in his power to make her happy. He\u2019d tell her every day, if he only could get the courage to tell her once.\u00a0</p><p>Robb, on the other hand, did not get a pass from Ella. She was all bark and no bite, and wasn\u2019t much bark, but even still he couldn\u2019t stand it when she looked at him with anything other than love in her eyes. Because the thing was, Jon was not the only man who\u2019d fallen in love at the tender age of eleven, the only difference was that Robb hadn\u2019t been able to stand it past the age of seventeen, when he\u2019d finally asked Ella to be his. The truth was, she very rarely looked at him with anything short of love, even when she was frustrated with him, because he had stolen her heart when he recovered her stolen kite and she had never once considered asking for it back.\u00a0</p><p>Even still, he felt safer with the lavender donuts in hand.\u00a0</p>[[MORE]]<p>They parked the car and walked in the lobby of the girls\u2019 apartment building, waving hello to Sid the night doorman and taking the elevator up to the penthouse apartment that Ella had been gifted to her upon her graduation from university.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo you smell that?,\u201d Jon asked as the elevator doors opened to the small vestibule.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSmells like -,\u201d Robb said, but stopped dead when he saw smoke coming from the door to the girls\u2019 apartment.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSeven hells,\u201d Jon groaned and Robb grabbed his key and let them into the apartment.\u00a0</p><p>They barrelled into the foyer only to find Sansa there, her hair in two pigtail braids, in yoga pants, a sports bra and fluffy slippers utilising a fire extinguisher against a flaming rubbish can.\u00a0</p><p>Robb was about to move forward to pull her back from the flames when Ella came running in wearing a thin white tank top and a pair of his boxers, her hair up in a high ponytail and what looked to be a purple face mask on. She was holding a large bowl of water and Ghost and Grey Wind were trailing her, the latter of whom had what seemed to be a singed dishtowel hanging out of his mouth.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat are you two doing here?,\u201d she demanded when she saw them. \u201cI said I had it under control!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis!??,\u201d Robb demanded back, \u201cThis is what you consider <i>under control!?</i>\u201d</p><p>Ella dumped the bowl of water on the flames which quickly petered out and gave him a <i>ta-da </i>expression.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBy the <i>gods</i>,\u201d Sansa said, doubling over. \u201cWe really should have seen this coming. I mean, this is <i>exactly </i>what happens on that episode of Friends when they do the cleanse\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cCleanse?,\u201d Jon asked, and Robb appreciated that his eyes stayed on her face, rather than her exposed skin.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cA boyfriend cleanse,\u201d Ella said matter-of-factly, as though this was something that normal people did all the time.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat in Seven Hells is a boyfriend cleanse?,\u201d Robb asked.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLook!,\u201d Sansa said, holding up her hand, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be all judgey I at least need to go put on a shirt first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat idea,\u201d Robb nodded.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou have a lot of opinions for someone who was<i> not invited</i>,\u201d Ella growled at him and he wondered if now was the right time to bring out the donuts.</p><p>\u201cWait uh\u2026,\u201d Jon said, reaching into his bag, \u201cI mean put on whatever you want, or don\u2019t,\u201d he said and Robb fixed him with a look, \u201cI mean\u2026 that\u2019s\u2026 just here\u2026\u201d</p><p>With that he offered his sweatshirt to her like it was a dirty tissue that might disgust her, but Sansa reached for it like it was an offering from the gods. She pulled it on and the hem fell to mid-thigh and the sleeves were far too long but she wrapped her arms around herself and he could practically see the knots in her back uncoiling.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo this cleanse?,\u201d Robb asked them, trying to keep his voice free from judgment.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBasically,\u201d Sansa said, \u201cElla thought it would be a good idea to burn a bunch of things that I still had from exes as a way of like\u2026recalibrating.\u201d</p><p>Robb and Jon looked at Ella and she put her hands on her hips and raised her eyebrows as though to say <i>well the only thing you two have ever done is punch her ex-boyfriends</i>. Robb would have protested but it was true and even he could admit that that did more to recalibrate his and Jon\u2019s feelings than Sansa\u2019s.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see what we\u2019ve got here,\u201d Jon said as though he were a detective, grabbing an umbrella and crouching down and picking up a scarf out of the bin with the tip of it, \u201cJoffrey,\u201d he picked out a singed photograph and said, \u201cDickon,\u201d and then picked out a grey t shirt.\u00a0</p><p>Robb stepped forward and snatched it up.\u00a0</p><p>He turned to Ella accusingly, \u201cIs this\u2026 is this my old Direwolves t shirt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI felt left out,\u201d Ella protested bashfully.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLeft out?,\u201d Robb asked with a grin.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t <i>have </i>any ex-boyfriends and unless you plan on keeping up this judgy stuff I don\u2019t think I <i>will </i>have any so\u2026,\u201d she mumbled.\u00a0</p><p>He stepped forward to kiss her until she forgave him but he stopped short when he saw how viscous the face mask was.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCan you take this gunk off your face so that I can kiss you?,\u201d he asked her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d Ella said with a grin, \u201cI\u2019ve got a better idea\u2026\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>Ten minutes later after all the windows had been cracked and Robb and Jon had been poured margaritas of their own, they all settled onto the sectional.\u00a0</p><p>Another episode of Friends was on and Ghost was splayed on Sansa while Grey Wind peered curiously over Ella\u2019s shoulder as she applied Robb\u2019s green face mask.\u00a0</p><p>The one Sansa had put on him was pink and had been nice and cool when she\u2019d applied it\u00a0 thoughtfully but was now starting to dry. His nose was itchy but she had smiled to herself the whole time she\u2019d put it on him and he\u2019d wear it all night if it made her giggle every time she looked over at him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCan you stop whining and just be a man for five minutes?,\u201d Ella asked Robb as he complained about the smell.\u00a0</p><p>He didn\u2019t like the smell of coconut but Ella had told him it was meant to <i>rejuvenate </i>tired skin and he\u2019d been working so many hours lately at the family company that he\u2019d acquiesced.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCome now, you know I can be a man for longer than that\u2026,\u201d Robb said with a grin, pulling her closer to him by her waist.</p><p>\u201cRobb!,\u201d she giggled and Jon groaned.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSeriously guys,\u201d Sansa said in agreement, \u201cNot to be <i>that </i>person but its not all that nice for you to flaunt your domestic bliss in front of my broken heart.\u201d</p><p>That reminded them all why they were there in the first place and Robb accepted the rest of his face mask in silence.\u00a0</p><p>Ella hopped up to wash her hands and turned to him, \u201cJon can you help me in the kitchen for a second?\u201d</p><p>Robb shrugged at him and he got up, scratching Ghost\u2019s head on the way.\u00a0</p><p>He walked into the kitchen to find Ella washing her hands of the face mask and he opened the pizza box on the counter and grabbed a slice.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me I shouldn\u2019t be here, little one,\u201d he warned her softly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d she promised, grabbing a dish towel and drying her hands.\u00a0</p><p>She hopped up on the counter and sighed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHarry\u2019s such a <i>fucking </i>ass. Do you know it\u2019s not even <i>Sansa </i>he\u2019s been cheating on? It\u2019s the girl he\u2019s been dating since before<i> </i>he <i>met</i> Sansa. <i>He made SANSA THE OTHER WOMAN!</i>,\u201d she raged.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe can hear you!,\u201d Sansa called from the living room, \u201cAND I PREFER THE TERM MISTRESS.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoted!,\u201d Ella called back to her and then gave him an <i>oh shit </i>expression that in spite of everything made him smile.</p><p>\u201cHarry\u2019s an ass,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cWe know this, we\u2019ve <i>always </i>known this. The only person who <i>didn\u2019t </i>is that beautiful girl sitting on the couch in there.\u201d</p><p>Ella nodded and reached her hand out. He handed her the slice of pizza and she took a small bite and handed it back to him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI think she did know,\u201d she whispered to him. He stepped closer to her and leaned his hip against the counter. \u201cI think she\u2019s known about all of them\u2026 I mean\u2026 not the specifics of course, she\u2019s too smart to put herself into\u2026 the point is\u2026 even if they had all just been nice boring guys like Dickon\u2026 I think she\u2019s always known that the relationships have been doomed from the start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why-,\u201d Jon started.</p><p>\u201cBecause of all the things you\u2019ve done to protect her, you\u2019ve never done the simplest one of all,\u201d Ella said, \u201cJust tell her, Jon. Just <i>tell </i>her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell her what?,\u201d Jon evaded.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cJonathan Elliot Snow so help me,\u201d she said with an annoyed sigh.\u00a0</p><p>He ran to the other side of the kitchen and grabbed the small box and walked back over to her, opening it, \u201cLavender donut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy favorite!,\u201d Ella exclaimed giddily. \u201cI take it all back you\u2019re the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything for you,\u201d he said.\u00a0</p><p>Robb may kill him but Ella was <i>way </i>more frightening.\u00a0</p><p>She bit into one and chewed thoughtfully, a contented smile on her face. She broke off a piece and handed it to him and he ate it slowly as well, buying time.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying she shouldn\u2019t just pull it together and tell you too,\u201d Ella said quietly, \u201cShe is a strong, beautiful woman and she should have confidence in that but she <i>doesn\u2019t</i>. And I don\u2019t pretend that any of this is your fault because it isn\u2019t, of <i>course </i>it isn\u2019t, but you are the <i>only</i> person who has the power to keep her from getting her heart broken again. The only one in the whole world. That means you basically have a superpower and its really foolish to withhold using a superpower when it can help someone else, someone that you <i>love. </i>Don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Jon looked at her and took the rest of the donut out of her hand and shoved it in his mouth. She smacked him on the arm but went into the box and grabbed out a piece of another and watched him. He tried manfully to get the bite down but there was just so much of it. She looked at him with a grin and that made him more determined so he swallowed it with a large, admittedly painful, gulp.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell done,\u201d she said with a nod.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he coughed. \u201cIsn\u2019t it\u2026 wrong? To like\u2026 swoop now?\u201d</p><p>That was part of the problem. Sansa was never single for long. It wasn\u2019t like she <i>got around </i>or anything, not that there was anything wrong with that, she was just a serial monogamist. The trouble was, all the guys she picked were total losers.\u00a0</p><p>Jon, in spite of threatening each and every one of them, was not the kind of guy to try to steal another man\u2019s girl, especially when he wasn\u2019t totally sure that she wanted him to. There were signs of course, that she <i>might</i>, but he forgot all about those whenever she showed up with another waste of space on her arm.\u00a0</p><p>Robb and Ella were adamant though that she loved him too and if anyone would know it would be them. They had, after all, known about him for as long as he could remember even though he\u2019d never come out and said it.\u00a0</p><p>Well never soberly anyway. He and Ella had a drunken sleepover once while the Starks were on a family vacation in Braavos and after she\u2019d plied him with whiskey he had confessed it to her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not suggesting you just go lunge at her,\u201d Ella told him with a roll of her eyes, then smiled impishly, \u201cThough if that\u2019s your move then I can keep Robb <i>very busy </i>while you do so -\u201c</p><p>\u201cGross,\u201d he cut in and she giggled.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBut maybe\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026 ask her to dinner? Take her for a walk? Casually mention that you\u2019ve been in love with her for most of your life and that you\u2019ll be in love with her for the rest of it and that it would be all together better if she would agree to be the mother of your children\u2026,\u201d Ella suggested.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cVery casual,\u201d Jon agreed.</p><p>Ella giggled and hopped off the counter, tugging his arm.\u00a0</p><p>They went back into the living room to find the two eldest Stark siblings reclined fully on the couch, chuckling at whatever Chandler was saying.</p><p>\u201cJon got me lavender donuts if you guys want some,\u201d Ella said to them as she went over to wear Robb was sitting and settled in front of him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow nice of him,\u201d Robb said with a glare for him as he let Ella in between his legs and pulled her back against his chest.\u00a0</p><p>Jon fought the urge to stick his tongue out at him and sat down next to Sansa and tugged one of her braids gently.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s lemon pie for you too,\u201d he said softly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Sansa said with a smile. Her smile fell and she looked at him skittishly, before hesitantly pressing her cheek to his shoulder, \u201cThanks for coming,\u201d she said sadly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019d keep me away,\u201d he told her, leaning his head on top of hers. She wrapped her arms around his and shifted so she leaned against him entirely. He breathed in her familiar smell of lilacs and fought the urge to kiss her head. He settled for saying, \u201cAnything for you, you know that.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t entirely sure that Ella was right. He wasn\u2019t sure that he had a superpower or anything. The only thing that he was certain of was that he loved Sansa Stark more than anything in this world, and that he wasn\u2019t sure he could watch her heart break once more.\u00a0</p><p>He looked over at Ella and nodded. <i>I\u2019ll do it</i>, he told her silently.\u00a0</p><p>She smiled at him, <i>Thank you. </i>And winked, <i>Got get \u2018em tiger.\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cCome on, Robb, let\u2019s go get that off your face,\u201d she said, gesturing to his face mask.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBut this is the-,\u201d Robb started.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo you want your skin to peel off?,\u201d Ella asked him curiously.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo!,\u201d Robb exclaimed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell then,\u201d Ella said and got off the couch and pulled Robb with her.\u00a0</p><p>They disappeared and Jon tried to focus on the television.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCan that\u2026 she was just kidding right?,\u201d he asked, touching his face to his own mask.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah you can just peel it off whenever, you\u2019re skin will stay put. Promise,\u201d Sansa said and he could hear her smile.\u00a0</p><p>He picked at the edges of the mask and pulled it off.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow do I look?,\u201d he asked her.\u00a0</p><p>She looked up at him and grinned, \u201c<i>Beautiful,</i>\u201d and then settled her head back against him.\u00a0</p><p>He took hold of her hand and pressed a solemn kiss to the back of it. She looked up at him with a question in those blue eyes of hers and he took a deep breath.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cJon?,\u201d she asked with a gulp.\u00a0</p><p>He was looking down at her with the most beautiful and caring pair of charcoal eyes she\u2019d ever known.\u00a0</p><p>It felt so right sitting here with him. He smelled so good and he felt like home and even though all she wanted was to gnaw on his jaw she could get past that and just accept him for what he was, one of the best friends she\u2019d ever had.\u00a0</p><p>He was the love of her life too, of that she was certain, but there was no reason for him to know that. It wasn\u2019t really any of his business.\u00a0</p><p>And then he\u2019d pressed a kiss to the back of her hand. His moustache had tickled her but all she really felt was the warm steady press of his lips, the slight exhale when he let her hand drop down again. Though he didn\u2019t release it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou look tired,\u201d he said sadly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh Jon,\u201d she said as breezily as she could muster, \u201cHave I taught you nothing about how to treat a girl? You can\u2019t just go telling a girl she looks tired, you might as well tell her she looks awful.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and sighed and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not your face, this face has never looked anything short of lovely,\u201d he released her hand now and pressed the pad of his thumb to the apple of her cheek and swiped along the bone softly. In all her life she wasn\u2019t sure that she\u2019d ever been touched so gently. It felt almost reverent. \u201cIt\u2019s your heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can see that?,\u201d she asked skeptically.\u00a0</p><p>If he could really see into her heart she knew there was only one thing that he\u2019d find.\u00a0</p><p>He nodded, \u201cI\u2019ve been seeing it for so long. Through every guy that didn\u2019t deserve you. I never feel so helpless as when we get the call or text from Ella saying that it\u2019s happened again.\u201d</p><p>Her face grew hot, \u201cYou make me sound so pathetic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!,\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cNo Sansa\u2026 You\u2019re not. Of course you\u2019re not. There\u2019s nothing braver than giving love a chance. And I\u2019ve been a coward for far too long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the bravest man I know,\u201d she shook her head.\u00a0</p><p>He was, he really was. The bravest and strongest, but the gentlest too. He had always been so gentle with her, and Ella and Arya too. Her father called him and Robb Northern Fools proudly, knowing they were following in his tradition.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIf that were true,\u201d Jon said, \u201cI would have said this some time ago. I would have told you on the tilt-a-whirl, when you wore your hair just like this,\u201d he said, and tugged her braid gently again, \u201cI would have told you before Joffrey, before Dickon, before\u2026,\u201d he said and she felt his whole body tense. She stroked his arm comfortingly, knowing that there was one man he\u2019d never name in her presence again. \u201cI would have told you every day since because it\u2019s been true every day since - I love you Sansa Stark. I love you and I have <i>been </i>loving you each moment since the first one. And I know. I know your heart is tired and if it\u2019s too soon then I\u2019ll wait, and it\u2019s a no, a no for good, then I\u2019ll never speak of it again but you will always have me, do you hear me? I\u2019m not going anywhere, but gods Sansa, if you just let me love you the way I want to I promi-\u201c</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she nodded.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay?,\u201d he asked incredulously.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou can love me,\u201d she said, \u201cThat would be alright with me.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled at her but there were tears in his eyes. There were tears in hers too so she closed them and leaned her face up towards him blindly.\u00a0</p><p>His lips met hers as though it were perfectly easy and she knew then that he had been right. Her heart had been tired. So tired, from trying to love people she was never meant to.\u00a0</p><p>All at once though, it woke up.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>Ella woke up sandwiched between Robb and Grey Wind. Robb was spooning her and she was spooning Grey Wind and they were both snoring.\u00a0</p><p>She rubbed Grey Wind\u2019s head and sat up, going into her bathroom to wash her face and brush her teeth, knowing the pair of them could sleep for hours yet.\u00a0</p><p>When she came back out, Robb was spooning Grey Wind, the dog looking like he had died and gone to the heaven of his choice.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCome back to bed,\u201d Robb urged her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she complained, \u201cThe third time last night nearly killed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kiss it better,\u201d he promised and she felt her resolve weakening.</p><p>\u201cCome on, I\u2019ll make you bacon instead,\u201d she said.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNot exactly a fair trade,\u201d Robb said, but he sat up anyway, pulling his shirt on.\u00a0</p><p>He padded into the bathroom and brushed his teeth as well and came out and pulled her to him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy do you look better in my boxers than I do?,\u201d he asked as he looked down at her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBecause you look better <i>out </i>of them,\u201d she said lustfully.\u00a0</p><p>He leaned down and kissed her hungrily, picking her up by her butt. Even though he had worn her out the night before she wrapped her arms around his neck and pressed herself against him, deepening the kiss.\u00a0</p><p>The palm of his other hand rested against her cheek, his fingers threading into her hair and she loved him so much she could burst.\u00a0</p><p>She was about to tell him so when she felt a paw on her arm. She looked down to see Grey Wind panting in their faces.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGo away buddy,\u201d Robb said but Grey Wind looked at him firmly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMy fault,\u201d she said, scratching Grey Wind\u2019s head, \u201cI said the <i>b </i>word.\u201d</p><p>She hopped down and dragged Robb out of her room. He wrapped his arms around her and kissed her neck on the walk to the kitchen and they stopped once or twice to make out because even though they\u2019d been together for eight years they had never really learned how to stop wanting to kiss one another.\u00a0</p><p>As they got closer to the kitchen, Ella could practically smell the bacon and was surprised when she walked in to find it already sizzling in the pan.\u00a0</p><p>That wasn\u2019t the only thing though because there was Sansa Stark wearing Jon\u2019s sweatshirt and seemingly nothing else while Jon stood there wearing an apron and a pair of his boxers and they were locked in what could only been considered a truly sloppy make-out.\u00a0</p><p>She reached behind her and shielded Robb\u2019s eyes as she cleared her throat.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cElla, it\u2019s a little late for that,\u201d Robb grumbled as Jon and Sansa broke apart.\u00a0</p><p>Sansa blushed and Jon grinned and Ella squealed and Robb groaned.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo you have enough for us?,\u201d Ella asked, hoping some food would settle Robb\u2019s stomach.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAlways, little one,\u201d Jon said with a grin, clearly too delirious with happiness to care much for his best friend\u2019s (and apparent future brother-in-law\u2019s) comfort.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cRobb why don\u2019t you set the table?,\u201d she suggested. \u201cJon\u2026 I think there is some champagne in the fridge in the laundry room? I think this calls for celebratory mimosas\u2026\u201d</p><p>They both went to do her bidding and she ran and jumped at Sansa, wrapping her legs around her the way she\u2019d just had her legs around Robb.\u00a0</p><p>Sansa hugged her back, the pair of them wiggling in excitement.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay so I know that you probably want to spend every minute with Jon right now, but you\u2019ll save me some time and tell me the whole story, right?,\u201d Ella asked her and hopped down.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOf course I will,\u201d Sansa said, using some tongs to flip the bacon. \u201cWait until I tell you about his superpower\u2026\u201d</p><p>Ella giggled, \u201cNo need. I\u2019m the one who discovered it.\u201d</p><p>Sansa turned to her and said, \u201cUm\u2026I fucking hope not because it involves his tongue and a part of your body that I truly pray he\u2019s never seen\u2026\u201d</p><p>Ella looked at her and Sansa looked so smugly satisfied that Ella couldn\u2019t help the scream that erupted her from her mouth. She wrapped Sansa in her arms again and they didn\u2019t break apart until Robb and Jon collided with each other coming into the kitchen.\u00a0</p><p>Robb held the fire extinguisher and Jon had taken off the apron and was wielding it like he might smother something with it.\u00a0</p><p>Her and Sansa giggled and rolled their eyes as Robb and Jon seemed to slowly understand that they were not in fact in danger.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAt ease, gentlemen,\u201d Sansa said with a grin.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019ve got it all under control,\u201d Ella agreed.\u00a0</p><p>Robb and Jon straightened up and soon there were champagne glasses taken out and no one cared that they didn\u2019t have any orange juice because they were too busy toasting to the new couple.\u00a0</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cYou should ignore my texts more often,\u201d she whispered to Robb as they did the dishes after breakfast.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll remind you that you said that,\u201d he told her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cJust make sure you take a page out of Jon\u2019s book and bring lavender donuts with you next time that you do,\u201d she suggested.\u00a0</p><p>Robb opened his mouth as if to protest, but she cut off whatever he was going to say with a kiss. He sunk into her the way he always did and it was all the sweeter knowing that their best friends\u2019 hearts were safe, the way he\u2019d always kept hers.\u00a0</p><p><i>And they say cleanses don\u2019t work\u2026</i></p>",

Ah I loved writing this one. Hope you enjoy.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p><i>Promise me, </i>the text message said.\u00a0</p><p>They ignored it, like always.\u00a0</p><p>Jon had been all bravado, but that was because he wasn\u2019t going to be the one to face her wrath. That would fall to him, which was why there was a small box of lavender donuts on his lap on top of the container holding the lemon pie he\u2019d picked up from Nan\u2019s for Sansa.\u00a0</p><p>His little sister had gone through another break-up. He had been assured by Ella that it was not the worst one by far - that one still haunted them all - instead this had been <i>mere </i>cheating.\u00a0</p><p>He had been assured that Ella <i>had </i>it. That she and Sansa were going to have a night in and that he and Jon were not needed <i>thank you very much</i> and that she would call them tomorrow to let them know the degree to which they needed to beat up Harry Hardyng but that until then they should sit tight because Sansa needed <i>affection </i>and <i>alcohol </i>and not to hear about all the ways in which Harry was a deadman and how he never deserved her and how they had all told her so (he\u2019d like to say she made them sound worse than they were but in truth, Ella was never wrong). She had, however, stipulated that Grey Wind and Ghost\u2019s presence was desired so she had picked them up from his and Jon\u2019s apartment an hour before on her way to pick-up pizza.\u00a0</p><p>Jon had simply scoffed at the text message from Ella, grabbing his coat and a bottle of Sansa\u2019s favorite wine that they always kept a case of, as well as his old Direwolves football sweatshirt that he always brought her on occasions such as this. After Ramsay Jon had suggested she keep the sweater after she spent a week straight wearing it, but Sansa had assured him that it would lose its magic that way and that he should hold onto it for safe keeping.\u00a0</p><p>Now, if you are wondering <i>why </i>exactly Sansa would have been dating someone else only to be<i> </i>in this position, when she had a man who always made sure to have her favorite wine, and had a dog that treated Sansa like she was his baby, and who would wrap her up in his arms the way she wrapped herself in his sweatshirt if she only asked him to, you would be in very good company.\u00a0</p><p>The answer, however, was sadly that <i>despite </i>the fact that Jon Snow had loved Sansa Stark ever since he met her after his first peewee football game at the tender age of eleven he had never actually <i>told </i>her so.\u00a0</p><p>Sansa had taken a little longer to realise her feelings for Jon. It was a whole week later in fact when they rode on the tilt-a-whirl together at the Winterfell Carnival and he\u2019d held her hand and hadn\u2019t told anyone that she\u2019d been afraid. She, of course, had never told him this either and so she found herself in a series of relationships that went from the very boring to the very terrifying.\u00a0</p><p>At the end of each of them Jon was always there. Along with him, but he was her big brother and had never been able to stand it when she was upset, and Ella, her best friend and the ultimate love of her life.\u00a0</p><p>By now there was a routine to things.</p><p>Ella always told them to be calm, and not charge in, with one exception, and they always ignored her.\u00a0</p><p>Jon was fearless when it came to Ella because she gave him a <i>pass </i>because even though Sansa didn\u2019t know that he was in love with her, Ella did, and she knew how much more acutely he felt each of these break-ups, because he knew that if he only had the chance that Sansa would never cry again. She would never be cheated on or talked down to, she would never have to wonder because he\u2019d tell her every day, that she was the one, the only one, that he was hers forever and if she\u2019d only tell him how, he would do everything in his power to make her happy. He\u2019d tell her every day, if he only could get the courage to tell her once.\u00a0</p><p>Robb, on the other hand, did not get a pass from Ella. She was all bark and no bite, and wasn\u2019t much bark, but even still he couldn\u2019t stand it when she looked at him with anything other than love in her eyes. Because the thing was, Jon was not the only man who\u2019d fallen in love at the tender age of eleven, the only difference was that Robb hadn\u2019t been able to stand it past the age of seventeen, when he\u2019d finally asked Ella to be his. The truth was, she very rarely looked at him with anything short of love, even when she was frustrated with him, because he had stolen her heart when he recovered her stolen kite and she had never once considered asking for it back.\u00a0</p><p>Even still, he felt safer with the lavender donuts in hand.\u00a0</p>[[MORE]]<p>They parked the car and walked in the lobby of the girls\u2019 apartment building, waving hello to Sid the night doorman and taking the elevator up to the penthouse apartment that Ella had been gifted to her upon her graduation from university.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo you smell that?,\u201d Jon asked as the elevator doors opened to the small vestibule.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSmells like -,\u201d Robb said, but stopped dead when he saw smoke coming from the door to the girls\u2019 apartment.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSeven hells,\u201d Jon groaned and Robb grabbed his key and let them into the apartment.\u00a0</p><p>They barrelled into the foyer only to find Sansa there, her hair in two pigtail braids, in yoga pants, a sports bra and fluffy slippers utilising a fire extinguisher against a flaming rubbish can.\u00a0</p><p>Robb was about to move forward to pull her back from the flames when Ella came running in wearing a thin white tank top and a pair of his boxers, her hair up in a high ponytail and what looked to be a purple face mask on. She was holding a large bowl of water and Ghost and Grey Wind were trailing her, the latter of whom had what seemed to be a singed dishtowel hanging out of his mouth.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat are you two doing here?,\u201d she demanded when she saw them. \u201cI said I had it under control!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis!??,\u201d Robb demanded back, \u201cThis is what you consider <i>under control!?</i>\u201d</p><p>Ella dumped the bowl of water on the flames which quickly petered out and gave him a <i>ta-da </i>expression.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBy the <i>gods</i>,\u201d Sansa said, doubling over. \u201cWe really should have seen this coming. I mean, this is <i>exactly </i>what happens on that episode of Friends when they do the cleanse\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cCleanse?,\u201d Jon asked, and Robb appreciated that his eyes stayed on her face, rather than her exposed skin.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cA boyfriend cleanse,\u201d Ella said matter-of-factly, as though this was something that normal people did all the time.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat in Seven Hells is a boyfriend cleanse?,\u201d Robb asked.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLook!,\u201d Sansa said, holding up her hand, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be all judgey I at least need to go put on a shirt first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat idea,\u201d Robb nodded.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou have a lot of opinions for someone who was<i> not invited</i>,\u201d Ella growled at him and he wondered if now was the right time to bring out the donuts.</p><p>\u201cWait uh\u2026,\u201d Jon said, reaching into his bag, \u201cI mean put on whatever you want, or don\u2019t,\u201d he said and Robb fixed him with a look, \u201cI mean\u2026 that\u2019s\u2026 just here\u2026\u201d</p><p>With that he offered his sweatshirt to her like it was a dirty tissue that might disgust her, but Sansa reached for it like it was an offering from the gods. She pulled it on and the hem fell to mid-thigh and the sleeves were far too long but she wrapped her arms around herself and he could practically see the knots in her back uncoiling.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo this cleanse?,\u201d Robb asked them, trying to keep his voice free from judgment.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBasically,\u201d Sansa said, \u201cElla thought it would be a good idea to burn a bunch of things that I still had from exes as a way of like\u2026recalibrating.\u201d</p><p>Robb and Jon looked at Ella and she put her hands on her hips and raised her eyebrows as though to say <i>well the only thing you two have ever done is punch her ex-boyfriends</i>. Robb would have protested but it was true and even he could admit that that did more to recalibrate his and Jon\u2019s feelings than Sansa\u2019s.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see what we\u2019ve got here,\u201d Jon said as though he were a detective, grabbing an umbrella and crouching down and picking up a scarf out of the bin with the tip of it, \u201cJoffrey,\u201d he picked out a singed photograph and said, \u201cDickon,\u201d and then picked out a grey t shirt.\u00a0</p><p>Robb stepped forward and snatched it up.\u00a0</p><p>He turned to Ella accusingly, \u201cIs this\u2026 is this my old Direwolves t shirt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI felt left out,\u201d Ella protested bashfully.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLeft out?,\u201d Robb asked with a grin.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t <i>have </i>any ex-boyfriends and unless you plan on keeping up this judgy stuff I don\u2019t think I <i>will </i>have any so\u2026,\u201d she mumbled.\u00a0</p><p>He stepped forward to kiss her until she forgave him but he stopped short when he saw how viscous the face mask was.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCan you take this gunk off your face so that I can kiss you?,\u201d he asked her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d Ella said with a grin, \u201cI\u2019ve got a better idea\u2026\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>Ten minutes later after all the windows had been cracked and Robb and Jon had been poured margaritas of their own, they all settled onto the sectional.\u00a0</p><p>Another episode of Friends was on and Ghost was splayed on Sansa while Grey Wind peered curiously over Ella\u2019s shoulder as she applied Robb\u2019s green face mask.\u00a0</p><p>The one Sansa had put on him was pink and had been nice and cool when she\u2019d applied it\u00a0 thoughtfully but was now starting to dry. His nose was itchy but she had smiled to herself the whole time she\u2019d put it on him and he\u2019d wear it all night if it made her giggle every time she looked over at him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCan you stop whining and just be a man for five minutes?,\u201d Ella asked Robb as he complained about the smell.\u00a0</p><p>He didn\u2019t like the smell of coconut but Ella had told him it was meant to <i>rejuvenate </i>tired skin and he\u2019d been working so many hours lately at the family company that he\u2019d acquiesced.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCome now, you know I can be a man for longer than that\u2026,\u201d Robb said with a grin, pulling her closer to him by her waist.</p><p>\u201cRobb!,\u201d she giggled and Jon groaned.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSeriously guys,\u201d Sansa said in agreement, \u201cNot to be <i>that </i>person but its not all that nice for you to flaunt your domestic bliss in front of my broken heart.\u201d</p><p>That reminded them all why they were there in the first place and Robb accepted the rest of his face mask in silence.\u00a0</p><p>Ella hopped up to wash her hands and turned to him, \u201cJon can you help me in the kitchen for a second?\u201d</p><p>Robb shrugged at him and he got up, scratching Ghost\u2019s head on the way.\u00a0</p><p>He walked into the kitchen to find Ella washing her hands of the face mask and he opened the pizza box on the counter and grabbed a slice.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me I shouldn\u2019t be here, little one,\u201d he warned her softly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d she promised, grabbing a dish towel and drying her hands.\u00a0</p><p>She hopped up on the counter and sighed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHarry\u2019s such a <i>fucking </i>ass. Do you know it\u2019s not even <i>Sansa </i>he\u2019s been cheating on? It\u2019s the girl he\u2019s been dating since before<i> </i>he <i>met</i> Sansa. <i>He made SANSA THE OTHER WOMAN!</i>,\u201d she raged.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe can hear you!,\u201d Sansa called from the living room, \u201cAND I PREFER THE TERM MISTRESS.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoted!,\u201d Ella called back to her and then gave him an <i>oh shit </i>expression that in spite of everything made him smile.</p><p>\u201cHarry\u2019s an ass,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cWe know this, we\u2019ve <i>always </i>known this. The only person who <i>didn\u2019t </i>is that beautiful girl sitting on the couch in there.\u201d</p><p>Ella nodded and reached her hand out. He handed her the slice of pizza and she took a small bite and handed it back to him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI think she did know,\u201d she whispered to him. He stepped closer to her and leaned his hip against the counter. \u201cI think she\u2019s known about all of them\u2026 I mean\u2026 not the specifics of course, she\u2019s too smart to put herself into\u2026 the point is\u2026 even if they had all just been nice boring guys like Dickon\u2026 I think she\u2019s always known that the relationships have been doomed from the start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why-,\u201d Jon started.</p><p>\u201cBecause of all the things you\u2019ve done to protect her, you\u2019ve never done the simplest one of all,\u201d Ella said, \u201cJust tell her, Jon. Just <i>tell </i>her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell her what?,\u201d Jon evaded.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cJonathan Elliot Snow so help me,\u201d she said with an annoyed sigh.\u00a0</p><p>He ran to the other side of the kitchen and grabbed the small box and walked back over to her, opening it, \u201cLavender donut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy favorite!,\u201d Ella exclaimed giddily. \u201cI take it all back you\u2019re the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything for you,\u201d he said.\u00a0</p><p>Robb may kill him but Ella was <i>way </i>more frightening.\u00a0</p><p>She bit into one and chewed thoughtfully, a contented smile on her face. She broke off a piece and handed it to him and he ate it slowly as well, buying time.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying she shouldn\u2019t just pull it together and tell you too,\u201d Ella said quietly, \u201cShe is a strong, beautiful woman and she should have confidence in that but she <i>doesn\u2019t</i>. And I don\u2019t pretend that any of this is your fault because it isn\u2019t, of <i>course </i>it isn\u2019t, but you are the <i>only</i> person who has the power to keep her from getting her heart broken again. The only one in the whole world. That means you basically have a superpower and its really foolish to withhold using a superpower when it can help someone else, someone that you <i>love. </i>Don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Jon looked at her and took the rest of the donut out of her hand and shoved it in his mouth. She smacked him on the arm but went into the box and grabbed out a piece of another and watched him. He tried manfully to get the bite down but there was just so much of it. She looked at him with a grin and that made him more determined so he swallowed it with a large, admittedly painful, gulp.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell done,\u201d she said with a nod.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he coughed. \u201cIsn\u2019t it\u2026 wrong? To like\u2026 swoop now?\u201d</p><p>That was part of the problem. Sansa was never single for long. It wasn\u2019t like she <i>got around </i>or anything, not that there was anything wrong with that, she was just a serial monogamist. The trouble was, all the guys she picked were total losers.\u00a0</p><p>Jon, in spite of threatening each and every one of them, was not the kind of guy to try to steal another man\u2019s girl, especially when he wasn\u2019t totally sure that she wanted him to. There were signs of course, that she <i>might</i>, but he forgot all about those whenever she showed up with another waste of space on her arm.\u00a0</p><p>Robb and Ella were adamant though that she loved him too and if anyone would know it would be them. They had, after all, known about him for as long as he could remember even though he\u2019d never come out and said it.\u00a0</p><p>Well never soberly anyway. He and Ella had a drunken sleepover once while the Starks were on a family vacation in Braavos and after she\u2019d plied him with whiskey he had confessed it to her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not suggesting you just go lunge at her,\u201d Ella told him with a roll of her eyes, then smiled impishly, \u201cThough if that\u2019s your move then I can keep Robb <i>very busy </i>while you do so -\u201c</p><p>\u201cGross,\u201d he cut in and she giggled.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBut maybe\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026 ask her to dinner? Take her for a walk? Casually mention that you\u2019ve been in love with her for most of your life and that you\u2019ll be in love with her for the rest of it and that it would be all together better if she would agree to be the mother of your children\u2026,\u201d Ella suggested.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cVery casual,\u201d Jon agreed.</p><p>Ella giggled and hopped off the counter, tugging his arm.\u00a0</p><p>They went back into the living room to find the two eldest Stark siblings reclined fully on the couch, chuckling at whatever Chandler was saying.</p><p>\u201cJon got me lavender donuts if you guys want some,\u201d Ella said to them as she went over to wear Robb was sitting and settled in front of him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow nice of him,\u201d Robb said with a glare for him as he let Ella in between his legs and pulled her back against his chest.\u00a0</p><p>Jon fought the urge to stick his tongue out at him and sat down next to Sansa and tugged one of her braids gently.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s lemon pie for you too,\u201d he said softly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Sansa said with a smile. Her smile fell and she looked at him skittishly, before hesitantly pressing her cheek to his shoulder, \u201cThanks for coming,\u201d she said sadly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019d keep me away,\u201d he told her, leaning his head on top of hers. She wrapped her arms around his and shifted so she leaned against him entirely. He breathed in her familiar smell of lilacs and fought the urge to kiss her head. He settled for saying, \u201cAnything for you, you know that.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t entirely sure that Ella was right. He wasn\u2019t sure that he had a superpower or anything. The only thing that he was certain of was that he loved Sansa Stark more than anything in this world, and that he wasn\u2019t sure he could watch her heart break once more.\u00a0</p><p>He looked over at Ella and nodded. <i>I\u2019ll do it</i>, he told her silently.\u00a0</p><p>She smiled at him, <i>Thank you. </i>And winked, <i>Got get \u2018em tiger.\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cCome on, Robb, let\u2019s go get that off your face,\u201d she said, gesturing to his face mask.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBut this is the-,\u201d Robb started.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo you want your skin to peel off?,\u201d Ella asked him curiously.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo!,\u201d Robb exclaimed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell then,\u201d Ella said and got off the couch and pulled Robb with her.\u00a0</p><p>They disappeared and Jon tried to focus on the television.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCan that\u2026 she was just kidding right?,\u201d he asked, touching his face to his own mask.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah you can just peel it off whenever, you\u2019re skin will stay put. Promise,\u201d Sansa said and he could hear her smile.\u00a0</p><p>He picked at the edges of the mask and pulled it off.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow do I look?,\u201d he asked her.\u00a0</p><p>She looked up at him and grinned, \u201c<i>Beautiful,</i>\u201d and then settled her head back against him.\u00a0</p><p>He took hold of her hand and pressed a solemn kiss to the back of it. She looked up at him with a question in those blue eyes of hers and he took a deep breath.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cJon?,\u201d she asked with a gulp.\u00a0</p><p>He was looking down at her with the most beautiful and caring pair of charcoal eyes she\u2019d ever known.\u00a0</p><p>It felt so right sitting here with him. He smelled so good and he felt like home and even though all she wanted was to gnaw on his jaw she could get past that and just accept him for what he was, one of the best friends she\u2019d ever had.\u00a0</p><p>He was the love of her life too, of that she was certain, but there was no reason for him to know that. It wasn\u2019t really any of his business.\u00a0</p><p>And then he\u2019d pressed a kiss to the back of her hand. His moustache had tickled her but all she really felt was the warm steady press of his lips, the slight exhale when he let her hand drop down again. Though he didn\u2019t release it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou look tired,\u201d he said sadly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh Jon,\u201d she said as breezily as she could muster, \u201cHave I taught you nothing about how to treat a girl? You can\u2019t just go telling a girl she looks tired, you might as well tell her she looks awful.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and sighed and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not your face, this face has never looked anything short of lovely,\u201d he released her hand now and pressed the pad of his thumb to the apple of her cheek and swiped along the bone softly. In all her life she wasn\u2019t sure that she\u2019d ever been touched so gently. It felt almost reverent. \u201cIt\u2019s your heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can see that?,\u201d she asked skeptically.\u00a0</p><p>If he could really see into her heart she knew there was only one thing that he\u2019d find.\u00a0</p><p>He nodded, \u201cI\u2019ve been seeing it for so long. Through every guy that didn\u2019t deserve you. I never feel so helpless as when we get the call or text from Ella saying that it\u2019s happened again.\u201d</p><p>Her face grew hot, \u201cYou make me sound so pathetic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!,\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cNo Sansa\u2026 You\u2019re not. Of course you\u2019re not. There\u2019s nothing braver than giving love a chance. And I\u2019ve been a coward for far too long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the bravest man I know,\u201d she shook her head.\u00a0</p><p>He was, he really was. The bravest and strongest, but the gentlest too. He had always been so gentle with her, and Ella and Arya too. Her father called him and Robb Northern Fools proudly, knowing they were following in his tradition.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIf that were true,\u201d Jon said, \u201cI would have said this some time ago. I would have told you on the tilt-a-whirl, when you wore your hair just like this,\u201d he said, and tugged her braid gently again, \u201cI would have told you before Joffrey, before Dickon, before\u2026,\u201d he said and she felt his whole body tense. She stroked his arm comfortingly, knowing that there was one man he\u2019d never name in her presence again. \u201cI would have told you every day since because it\u2019s been true every day since - I love you Sansa Stark. I love you and I have <i>been </i>loving you each moment since the first one. And I know. I know your heart is tired and if it\u2019s too soon then I\u2019ll wait, and it\u2019s a no, a no for good, then I\u2019ll never speak of it again but you will always have me, do you hear me? I\u2019m not going anywhere, but gods Sansa, if you just let me love you the way I want to I promi-\u201c</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she nodded.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay?,\u201d he asked incredulously.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou can love me,\u201d she said, \u201cThat would be alright with me.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled at her but there were tears in his eyes. There were tears in hers too so she closed them and leaned her face up towards him blindly.\u00a0</p><p>His lips met hers as though it were perfectly easy and she knew then that he had been right. Her heart had been tired. So tired, from trying to love people she was never meant to.\u00a0</p><p>All at once though, it woke up.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>Ella woke up sandwiched between Robb and Grey Wind. Robb was spooning her and she was spooning Grey Wind and they were both snoring.\u00a0</p><p>She rubbed Grey Wind\u2019s head and sat up, going into her bathroom to wash her face and brush her teeth, knowing the pair of them could sleep for hours yet.\u00a0</p><p>When she came back out, Robb was spooning Grey Wind, the dog looking like he had died and gone to the heaven of his choice.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCome back to bed,\u201d Robb urged her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she complained, \u201cThe third time last night nearly killed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kiss it better,\u201d he promised and she felt her resolve weakening.</p><p>\u201cCome on, I\u2019ll make you bacon instead,\u201d she said.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNot exactly a fair trade,\u201d Robb said, but he sat up anyway, pulling his shirt on.\u00a0</p><p>He padded into the bathroom and brushed his teeth as well and came out and pulled her to him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy do you look better in my boxers than I do?,\u201d he asked as he looked down at her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBecause you look better <i>out </i>of them,\u201d she said lustfully.\u00a0</p><p>He leaned down and kissed her hungrily, picking her up by her butt. Even though he had worn her out the night before she wrapped her arms around his neck and pressed herself against him, deepening the kiss.\u00a0</p><p>The palm of his other hand rested against her cheek, his fingers threading into her hair and she loved him so much she could burst.\u00a0</p><p>She was about to tell him so when she felt a paw on her arm. She looked down to see Grey Wind panting in their faces.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGo away buddy,\u201d Robb said but Grey Wind looked at him firmly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMy fault,\u201d she said, scratching Grey Wind\u2019s head, \u201cI said the <i>b </i>word.\u201d</p><p>She hopped down and dragged Robb out of her room. He wrapped his arms around her and kissed her neck on the walk to the kitchen and they stopped once or twice to make out because even though they\u2019d been together for eight years they had never really learned how to stop wanting to kiss one another.\u00a0</p><p>As they got closer to the kitchen, Ella could practically smell the bacon and was surprised when she walked in to find it already sizzling in the pan.\u00a0</p><p>That wasn\u2019t the only thing though because there was Sansa Stark wearing Jon\u2019s sweatshirt and seemingly nothing else while Jon stood there wearing an apron and a pair of his boxers and they were locked in what could only been considered a truly sloppy make-out.\u00a0</p><p>She reached behind her and shielded Robb\u2019s eyes as she cleared her throat.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cElla, it\u2019s a little late for that,\u201d Robb grumbled as Jon and Sansa broke apart.\u00a0</p><p>Sansa blushed and Jon grinned and Ella squealed and Robb groaned.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo you have enough for us?,\u201d Ella asked, hoping some food would settle Robb\u2019s stomach.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAlways, little one,\u201d Jon said with a grin, clearly too delirious with happiness to care much for his best friend\u2019s (and apparent future brother-in-law\u2019s) comfort.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cRobb why don\u2019t you set the table?,\u201d she suggested. \u201cJon\u2026 I think there is some champagne in the fridge in the laundry room? I think this calls for celebratory mimosas\u2026\u201d</p><p>They both went to do her bidding and she ran and jumped at Sansa, wrapping her legs around her the way she\u2019d just had her legs around Robb.\u00a0</p><p>Sansa hugged her back, the pair of them wiggling in excitement.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay so I know that you probably want to spend every minute with Jon right now, but you\u2019ll save me some time and tell me the whole story, right?,\u201d Ella asked her and hopped down.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOf course I will,\u201d Sansa said, using some tongs to flip the bacon. \u201cWait until I tell you about his superpower\u2026\u201d</p><p>Ella giggled, \u201cNo need. I\u2019m the one who discovered it.\u201d</p><p>Sansa turned to her and said, \u201cUm\u2026I fucking hope not because it involves his tongue and a part of your body that I truly pray he\u2019s never seen\u2026\u201d</p><p>Ella looked at her and Sansa looked so smugly satisfied that Ella couldn\u2019t help the scream that erupted her from her mouth. She wrapped Sansa in her arms again and they didn\u2019t break apart until Robb and Jon collided with each other coming into the kitchen.\u00a0</p><p>Robb held the fire extinguisher and Jon had taken off the apron and was wielding it like he might smother something with it.\u00a0</p><p>Her and Sansa giggled and rolled their eyes as Robb and Jon seemed to slowly understand that they were not in fact in danger.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAt ease, gentlemen,\u201d Sansa said with a grin.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019ve got it all under control,\u201d Ella agreed.\u00a0</p><p>Robb and Jon straightened up and soon there were champagne glasses taken out and no one cared that they didn\u2019t have any orange juice because they were too busy toasting to the new couple.\u00a0</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cYou should ignore my texts more often,\u201d she whispered to Robb as they did the dishes after breakfast.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll remind you that you said that,\u201d he told her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cJust make sure you take a page out of Jon\u2019s book and bring lavender donuts with you next time that you do,\u201d she suggested.\u00a0</p><p>Robb opened his mouth as if to protest, but she cut off whatever he was going to say with a kiss. He sunk into her the way he always did and it was all the sweeter knowing that their best friends\u2019 hearts were safe, the way he\u2019d always kept hers.\u00a0</p><p><i>And they say cleanses don\u2019t work\u2026</i></p>",
                "content": "<p>This is for my baby <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlTfK4ggtX76l7s4JyOzNqg\">@octaviahales</a> who has been giving me the best prompts. Ah I loved writing this one. Hope you enjoy.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p><i>Promise me, </i>the text message said.&nbsp;</p><p>They ignored it, like always.&nbsp;</p><p>Jon had been all bravado, but that was because he wasn&rsquo;t going to be the one to face her wrath. That would fall to him, which was why there was a small box of lavender donuts on his lap on top of the container holding the lemon pie he&rsquo;d picked up from Nan&rsquo;s for Sansa.&nbsp;</p><p>His little sister had gone through another break-up. He had been assured by Ella that it was not the worst one by far - that one still haunted them all - instead this had been <i>mere </i>cheating.&nbsp;</p><p>He had been assured that Ella <i>had </i>it. That she and Sansa were going to have a night in and that he and Jon were not needed <i>thank you very much</i> and that she would call them tomorrow to let them know the degree to which they needed to beat up Harry Hardyng but that until then they should sit tight because Sansa needed <i>affection </i>and <i>alcohol </i>and not to hear about all the ways in which Harry was a deadman and how he never deserved her and how they had all told her so (he&rsquo;d like to say she made them sound worse than they were but in truth, Ella was never wrong). She had, however, stipulated that Grey Wind and Ghost&rsquo;s presence was desired so she had picked them up from his and Jon&rsquo;s apartment an hour before on her way to pick-up pizza.&nbsp;</p><p>Jon had simply scoffed at the text message from Ella, grabbing his coat and a bottle of Sansa&rsquo;s favorite wine that they always kept a case of, as well as his old Direwolves football sweatshirt that he always brought her on occasions such as this. After Ramsay Jon had suggested she keep the sweater after she spent a week straight wearing it, but Sansa had assured him that it would lose its magic that way and that he should hold onto it for safe keeping.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, if you are wondering <i>why </i>exactly Sansa would have been dating someone else only to be<i> </i>in this position, when she had a man who always made sure to have her favorite wine, and had a dog that treated Sansa like she was his baby, and who would wrap her up in his arms the way she wrapped herself in his sweatshirt if she only asked him to, you would be in very good company.&nbsp;</p><p>The answer, however, was sadly that <i>despite </i>the fact that Jon Snow had loved Sansa Stark ever since he met her after his first peewee football game at the tender age of eleven he had never actually <i>told </i>her so.&nbsp;</p><p>Sansa had taken a little longer to realise her feelings for Jon. It was a whole week later in fact when they rode on the tilt-a-whirl together at the Winterfell Carnival and he&rsquo;d held her hand and hadn&rsquo;t told anyone that she&rsquo;d been afraid. She, of course, had never told him this either and so she found herself in a series of relationships that went from the very boring to the very terrifying.&nbsp;</p><p>At the end of each of them Jon was always there. Along with him, but he was her big brother and had never been able to stand it when she was upset, and Ella, her best friend and the ultimate love of her life.&nbsp;</p><p>By now there was a routine to things.</p><p>Ella always told them to be calm, and not charge in, with one exception, and they always ignored her.&nbsp;</p><p>Jon was fearless when it came to Ella because she gave him a <i>pass </i>because even though Sansa didn&rsquo;t know that he was in love with her, Ella did, and she knew how much more acutely he felt each of these break-ups, because he knew that if he only had the chance that Sansa would never cry again. She would never be cheated on or talked down to, she would never have to wonder because he&rsquo;d tell her every day, that she was the one, the only one, that he was hers forever and if she&rsquo;d only tell him how, he would do everything in his power to make her happy. He&rsquo;d tell her every day, if he only could get the courage to tell her once.&nbsp;</p><p>Robb, on the other hand, did not get a pass from Ella. She was all bark and no bite, and wasn&rsquo;t much bark, but even still he couldn&rsquo;t stand it when she looked at him with anything other than love in her eyes. Because the thing was, Jon was not the only man who&rsquo;d fallen in love at the tender age of eleven, the only difference was that Robb hadn&rsquo;t been able to stand it past the age of seventeen, when he&rsquo;d finally asked Ella to be his. The truth was, she very rarely looked at him with anything short of love, even when she was frustrated with him, because he had stolen her heart when he recovered her stolen kite and she had never once considered asking for it back.&nbsp;</p><p>Even still, he felt safer with the lavender donuts in hand.&nbsp;</p><p>They parked the car and walked in the lobby of the girls&rsquo; apartment building, waving hello to Sid the night doorman and taking the elevator up to the penthouse apartment that Ella had been gifted to her upon her graduation from university.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you smell that?,&rdquo; Jon asked as the elevator doors opened to the small vestibule.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Smells like -,&rdquo; Robb said, but stopped dead when he saw smoke coming from the door to the girls&rsquo; apartment.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Seven hells,&rdquo; Jon groaned and Robb grabbed his key and let them into the apartment.&nbsp;</p><p>They barrelled into the foyer only to find Sansa there, her hair in two pigtail braids, in yoga pants, a sports bra and fluffy slippers utilising a fire extinguisher against a flaming rubbish can.&nbsp;</p><p>Robb was about to move forward to pull her back from the flames when Ella came running in wearing a thin white tank top and a pair of his boxers, her hair up in a high ponytail and what looked to be a purple face mask on. She was holding a large bowl of water and Ghost and Grey Wind were trailing her, the latter of whom had what seemed to be a singed dishtowel hanging out of his mouth.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What are you two doing here?,&rdquo; she demanded when she saw them. &ldquo;I said I had it under control!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This!??,&rdquo; Robb demanded back, &ldquo;This is what you consider <i>under control!?</i>&rdquo;</p><p>Ella dumped the bowl of water on the flames which quickly petered out and gave him a <i>ta-da </i>expression.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;By the <i>gods</i>,&rdquo; Sansa said, doubling over. &ldquo;We really should have seen this coming. I mean, this is <i>exactly </i>what happens on that episode of Friends when they do the cleanse&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cleanse?,&rdquo; Jon asked, and Robb appreciated that his eyes stayed on her face, rather than her exposed skin.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;A boyfriend cleanse,&rdquo; Ella said matter-of-factly, as though this was something that normal people did all the time.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What in Seven Hells is a boyfriend cleanse?,&rdquo; Robb asked.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Look!,&rdquo; Sansa said, holding up her hand, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to be all judgey I at least need to go put on a shirt first.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Great idea,&rdquo; Robb nodded.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You have a lot of opinions for someone who was<i> not invited</i>,&rdquo; Ella growled at him and he wondered if now was the right time to bring out the donuts.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait uh&hellip;,&rdquo; Jon said, reaching into his bag, &ldquo;I mean put on whatever you want, or don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said and Robb fixed him with a look, &ldquo;I mean&hellip; that&rsquo;s&hellip; just here&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>With that he offered his sweatshirt to her like it was a dirty tissue that might disgust her, but Sansa reached for it like it was an offering from the gods. She pulled it on and the hem fell to mid-thigh and the sleeves were far too long but she wrapped her arms around herself and he could practically see the knots in her back uncoiling.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;So this cleanse?,&rdquo; Robb asked them, trying to keep his voice free from judgment.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Basically,&rdquo; Sansa said, &ldquo;Ella thought it would be a good idea to burn a bunch of things that I still had from exes as a way of like&hellip;recalibrating.&rdquo;</p><p>Robb and Jon looked at Ella and she put her hands on her hips and raised her eyebrows as though to say <i>well the only thing you two have ever done is punch her ex-boyfriends</i>. Robb would have protested but it was true and even he could admit that that did more to recalibrate his and Jon&rsquo;s feelings than Sansa&rsquo;s.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what we&rsquo;ve got here,&rdquo; Jon said as though he were a detective, grabbing an umbrella and crouching down and picking up a scarf out of the bin with the tip of it, &ldquo;Joffrey,&rdquo; he picked out a singed photograph and said, &ldquo;Dickon,&rdquo; and then picked out a grey t shirt.&nbsp;</p><p>Robb stepped forward and snatched it up.&nbsp;</p><p>He turned to Ella accusingly, &ldquo;Is this&hellip; is this my old Direwolves t shirt?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I felt left out,&rdquo; Ella protested bashfully.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Left out?,&rdquo; Robb asked with a grin.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t <i>have </i>any ex-boyfriends and unless you plan on keeping up this judgy stuff I don&rsquo;t think I <i>will </i>have any so&hellip;,&rdquo; she mumbled.&nbsp;</p><p>He stepped forward to kiss her until she forgave him but he stopped short when he saw how viscous the face mask was.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Can you take this gunk off your face so that I can kiss you?,&rdquo; he asked her.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Actually,&rdquo; Ella said with a grin, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a better idea&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>***</p><p>Ten minutes later after all the windows had been cracked and Robb and Jon had been poured margaritas of their own, they all settled onto the sectional.&nbsp;</p><p>Another episode of Friends was on and Ghost was splayed on Sansa while Grey Wind peered curiously over Ella&rsquo;s shoulder as she applied Robb&rsquo;s green face mask.&nbsp;</p><p>The one Sansa had put on him was pink and had been nice and cool when she&rsquo;d applied it&nbsp; thoughtfully but was now starting to dry. His nose was itchy but she had smiled to herself the whole time she&rsquo;d put it on him and he&rsquo;d wear it all night if it made her giggle every time she looked over at him.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Can you stop whining and just be a man for five minutes?,&rdquo; Ella asked Robb as he complained about the smell.&nbsp;</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t like the smell of coconut but Ella had told him it was meant to <i>rejuvenate </i>tired skin and he&rsquo;d been working so many hours lately at the family company that he&rsquo;d acquiesced.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Come now, you know I can be a man for longer than that&hellip;,&rdquo; Robb said with a grin, pulling her closer to him by her waist.</p><p>&ldquo;Robb!,&rdquo; she giggled and Jon groaned.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Seriously guys,&rdquo; Sansa said in agreement, &ldquo;Not to be <i>that </i>person but its not all that nice for you to flaunt your domestic bliss in front of my broken heart.&rdquo;</p><p>That reminded them all why they were there in the first place and Robb accepted the rest of his face mask in silence.&nbsp;</p><p>Ella hopped up to wash her hands and turned to him, &ldquo;Jon can you help me in the kitchen for a second?&rdquo;</p><p>Robb shrugged at him and he got up, scratching Ghost&rsquo;s head on the way.&nbsp;</p><p>He walked into the kitchen to find Ella washing her hands of the face mask and he opened the pizza box on the counter and grabbed a slice.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me I shouldn&rsquo;t be here, little one,&rdquo; he warned her softly.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she promised, grabbing a dish towel and drying her hands.&nbsp;</p><p>She hopped up on the counter and sighed.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Harry&rsquo;s such a <i>fucking </i>ass. Do you know it&rsquo;s not even <i>Sansa </i>he&rsquo;s been cheating on? It&rsquo;s the girl he&rsquo;s been dating since before<i> </i>he <i>met</i> Sansa. <i>He made SANSA THE OTHER WOMAN!</i>,&rdquo; she raged.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;We can hear you!,&rdquo; Sansa called from the living room, &ldquo;AND I PREFER THE TERM MISTRESS.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Noted!,&rdquo; Ella called back to her and then gave him an <i>oh shit </i>expression that in spite of everything made him smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry&rsquo;s an ass,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;We know this, we&rsquo;ve <i>always </i>known this. The only person who <i>didn&rsquo;t </i>is that beautiful girl sitting on the couch in there.&rdquo;</p><p>Ella nodded and reached her hand out. He handed her the slice of pizza and she took a small bite and handed it back to him.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I think she did know,&rdquo; she whispered to him. He stepped closer to her and leaned his hip against the counter. &ldquo;I think she&rsquo;s known about all of them&hellip; I mean&hellip; not the specifics of course, she&rsquo;s too smart to put herself into&hellip; the point is&hellip; even if they had all just been nice boring guys like Dickon&hellip; I think she&rsquo;s always known that the relationships have been doomed from the start.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then why-,&rdquo; Jon started.</p><p>&ldquo;Because of all the things you&rsquo;ve done to protect her, you&rsquo;ve never done the simplest one of all,&rdquo; Ella said, &ldquo;Just tell her, Jon. Just <i>tell </i>her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tell her what?,&rdquo; Jon evaded.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Jonathan Elliot Snow so help me,&rdquo; she said with an annoyed sigh.&nbsp;</p><p>He ran to the other side of the kitchen and grabbed the small box and walked back over to her, opening it, &ldquo;Lavender donut?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My favorite!,&rdquo; Ella exclaimed giddily. &ldquo;I take it all back you&rsquo;re the best.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Anything for you,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;</p><p>Robb may kill him but Ella was <i>way </i>more frightening.&nbsp;</p><p>She bit into one and chewed thoughtfully, a contented smile on her face. She broke off a piece and handed it to him and he ate it slowly as well, buying time.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying she shouldn&rsquo;t just pull it together and tell you too,&rdquo; Ella said quietly, &ldquo;She is a strong, beautiful woman and she should have confidence in that but she <i>doesn&rsquo;t</i>. And I don&rsquo;t pretend that any of this is your fault because it isn&rsquo;t, of <i>course </i>it isn&rsquo;t, but you are the <i>only</i> person who has the power to keep her from getting her heart broken again. The only one in the whole world. That means you basically have a superpower and its really foolish to withhold using a superpower when it can help someone else, someone that you <i>love. </i>Don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</p><p>Jon looked at her and took the rest of the donut out of her hand and shoved it in his mouth. She smacked him on the arm but went into the box and grabbed out a piece of another and watched him. He tried manfully to get the bite down but there was just so much of it. She looked at him with a grin and that made him more determined so he swallowed it with a large, admittedly painful, gulp.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Well done,&rdquo; she said with a nod.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he coughed. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it&hellip; wrong? To like&hellip; swoop now?&rdquo;</p><p>That was part of the problem. Sansa was never single for long. It wasn&rsquo;t like she <i>got around </i>or anything, not that there was anything wrong with that, she was just a serial monogamist. The trouble was, all the guys she picked were total losers.&nbsp;</p><p>Jon, in spite of threatening each and every one of them, was not the kind of guy to try to steal another man&rsquo;s girl, especially when he wasn&rsquo;t totally sure that she wanted him to. There were signs of course, that she <i>might</i>, but he forgot all about those whenever she showed up with another waste of space on her arm.&nbsp;</p><p>Robb and Ella were adamant though that she loved him too and if anyone would know it would be them. They had, after all, known about him for as long as he could remember even though he&rsquo;d never come out and said it.&nbsp;</p><p>Well never soberly anyway. He and Ella had a drunken sleepover once while the Starks were on a family vacation in Braavos and after she&rsquo;d plied him with whiskey he had confessed it to her.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not suggesting you just go lunge at her,&rdquo; Ella told him with a roll of her eyes, then smiled impishly, &ldquo;Though if that&rsquo;s your move then I can keep Robb <i>very busy </i>while you do so -&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Gross,&rdquo; he cut in and she giggled.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;But maybe&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know&hellip; ask her to dinner? Take her for a walk? Casually mention that you&rsquo;ve been in love with her for most of your life and that you&rsquo;ll be in love with her for the rest of it and that it would be all together better if she would agree to be the mother of your children&hellip;,&rdquo; Ella suggested.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Very casual,&rdquo; Jon agreed.</p><p>Ella giggled and hopped off the counter, tugging his arm.&nbsp;</p><p>They went back into the living room to find the two eldest Stark siblings reclined fully on the couch, chuckling at whatever Chandler was saying.</p><p>&ldquo;Jon got me lavender donuts if you guys want some,&rdquo; Ella said to them as she went over to wear Robb was sitting and settled in front of him.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;How nice of him,&rdquo; Robb said with a glare for him as he let Ella in between his legs and pulled her back against his chest.&nbsp;</p><p>Jon fought the urge to stick his tongue out at him and sat down next to Sansa and tugged one of her braids gently.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s lemon pie for you too,&rdquo; he said softly.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Sansa said with a smile. Her smile fell and she looked at him skittishly, before hesitantly pressing her cheek to his shoulder, &ldquo;Thanks for coming,&rdquo; she said sadly.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing&rsquo;d keep me away,&rdquo; he told her, leaning his head on top of hers. She wrapped her arms around his and shifted so she leaned against him entirely. He breathed in her familiar smell of lilacs and fought the urge to kiss her head. He settled for saying, &ldquo;Anything for you, you know that.&rdquo;</p><p>He wasn&rsquo;t entirely sure that Ella was right. He wasn&rsquo;t sure that he had a superpower or anything. The only thing that he was certain of was that he loved Sansa Stark more than anything in this world, and that he wasn&rsquo;t sure he could watch her heart break once more.&nbsp;</p><p>He looked over at Ella and nodded. <i>I&rsquo;ll do it</i>, he told her silently.&nbsp;</p><p>She smiled at him, <i>Thank you. </i>And winked, <i>Got get &lsquo;em tiger.&nbsp;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Come on, Robb, let&rsquo;s go get that off your face,&rdquo; she said, gesturing to his face mask.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;But this is the-,&rdquo; Robb started.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want your skin to peel off?,&rdquo; Ella asked him curiously.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;No!,&rdquo; Robb exclaimed.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; Ella said and got off the couch and pulled Robb with her.&nbsp;</p><p>They disappeared and Jon tried to focus on the television.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Can that&hellip; she was just kidding right?,&rdquo; he asked, touching his face to his own mask.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah you can just peel it off whenever, you&rsquo;re skin will stay put. Promise,&rdquo; Sansa said and he could hear her smile.&nbsp;</p><p>He picked at the edges of the mask and pulled it off.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;How do I look?,&rdquo; he asked her.&nbsp;</p><p>She looked up at him and grinned, &ldquo;<i>Beautiful,</i>&rdquo; and then settled her head back against him.&nbsp;</p><p>He took hold of her hand and pressed a solemn kiss to the back of it. She looked up at him with a question in those blue eyes of hers and he took a deep breath.&nbsp;</p><p>***</p><p>&ldquo;Jon?,&rdquo; she asked with a gulp.&nbsp;</p><p>He was looking down at her with the most beautiful and caring pair of charcoal eyes she&rsquo;d ever known.&nbsp;</p><p>It felt so right sitting here with him. He smelled so good and he felt like home and even though all she wanted was to gnaw on his jaw she could get past that and just accept him for what he was, one of the best friends she&rsquo;d ever had.&nbsp;</p><p>He was the love of her life too, of that she was certain, but there was no reason for him to know that. It wasn&rsquo;t really any of his business.&nbsp;</p><p>And then he&rsquo;d pressed a kiss to the back of her hand. His moustache had tickled her but all she really felt was the warm steady press of his lips, the slight exhale when he let her hand drop down again. Though he didn&rsquo;t release it.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You look tired,&rdquo; he said sadly.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh Jon,&rdquo; she said as breezily as she could muster, &ldquo;Have I taught you nothing about how to treat a girl? You can&rsquo;t just go telling a girl she looks tired, you might as well tell her she looks awful.&rdquo;</p><p>He shook his head and sighed and said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your face, this face has never looked anything short of lovely,&rdquo; he released her hand now and pressed the pad of his thumb to the apple of her cheek and swiped along the bone softly. In all her life she wasn&rsquo;t sure that she&rsquo;d ever been touched so gently. It felt almost reverent. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your heart.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You can see that?,&rdquo; she asked skeptically.&nbsp;</p><p>If he could really see into her heart she knew there was only one thing that he&rsquo;d find.&nbsp;</p><p>He nodded, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been seeing it for so long. Through every guy that didn&rsquo;t deserve you. I never feel so helpless as when we get the call or text from Ella saying that it&rsquo;s happened again.&rdquo;</p><p>Her face grew hot, &ldquo;You make me sound so pathetic.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No!,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;No Sansa&hellip; You&rsquo;re not. Of course you&rsquo;re not. There&rsquo;s nothing braver than giving love a chance. And I&rsquo;ve been a coward for far too long.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the bravest man I know,&rdquo; she shook her head.&nbsp;</p><p>He was, he really was. The bravest and strongest, but the gentlest too. He had always been so gentle with her, and Ella and Arya too. Her father called him and Robb Northern Fools proudly, knowing they were following in his tradition.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;If that were true,&rdquo; Jon said, &ldquo;I would have said this some time ago. I would have told you on the tilt-a-whirl, when you wore your hair just like this,&rdquo; he said, and tugged her braid gently again, &ldquo;I would have told you before Joffrey, before Dickon, before&hellip;,&rdquo; he said and she felt his whole body tense. She stroked his arm comfortingly, knowing that there was one man he&rsquo;d never name in her presence again. &ldquo;I would have told you every day since because it&rsquo;s been true every day since - I love you Sansa Stark. I love you and I have <i>been </i>loving you each moment since the first one. And I know. I know your heart is tired and if it&rsquo;s too soon then I&rsquo;ll wait, and it&rsquo;s a no, a no for good, then I&rsquo;ll never speak of it again but you will always have me, do you hear me? I&rsquo;m not going anywhere, but gods Sansa, if you just let me love you the way I want to I promi-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; she nodded.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay?,&rdquo; he asked incredulously.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You can love me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;That would be alright with me.&rdquo;</p><p>He chuckled at her but there were tears in his eyes. There were tears in hers too so she closed them and leaned her face up towards him blindly.&nbsp;</p><p>His lips met hers as though it were perfectly easy and she knew then that he had been right. Her heart had been tired. So tired, from trying to love people she was never meant to.&nbsp;</p><p>All at once though, it woke up.&nbsp;</p><p>***</p><p>Ella woke up sandwiched between Robb and Grey Wind. Robb was spooning her and she was spooning Grey Wind and they were both snoring.&nbsp;</p><p>She rubbed Grey Wind&rsquo;s head and sat up, going into her bathroom to wash her face and brush her teeth, knowing the pair of them could sleep for hours yet.&nbsp;</p><p>When she came back out, Robb was spooning Grey Wind, the dog looking like he had died and gone to the heaven of his choice.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Come back to bed,&rdquo; Robb urged her.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she complained, &ldquo;The third time last night nearly killed me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll kiss it better,&rdquo; he promised and she felt her resolve weakening.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, I&rsquo;ll make you bacon instead,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Not exactly a fair trade,&rdquo; Robb said, but he sat up anyway, pulling his shirt on.&nbsp;</p><p>He padded into the bathroom and brushed his teeth as well and came out and pulled her to him.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Why do you look better in my boxers than I do?,&rdquo; he asked as he looked down at her.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Because you look better <i>out </i>of them,&rdquo; she said lustfully.&nbsp;</p><p>He leaned down and kissed her hungrily, picking her up by her butt. Even though he had worn her out the night before she wrapped her arms around his neck and pressed herself against him, deepening the kiss.&nbsp;</p><p>The palm of his other hand rested against her cheek, his fingers threading into her hair and she loved him so much she could burst.&nbsp;</p><p>She was about to tell him so when she felt a paw on her arm. She looked down to see Grey Wind panting in their faces.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Go away buddy,&rdquo; Robb said but Grey Wind looked at him firmly.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;My fault,&rdquo; she said, scratching Grey Wind&rsquo;s head, &ldquo;I said the <i>b </i>word.&rdquo;</p><p>She hopped down and dragged Robb out of her room. He wrapped his arms around her and kissed her neck on the walk to the kitchen and they stopped once or twice to make out because even though they&rsquo;d been together for eight years they had never really learned how to stop wanting to kiss one another.&nbsp;</p><p>As they got closer to the kitchen, Ella could practically smell the bacon and was surprised when she walked in to find it already sizzling in the pan.&nbsp;</p><p>That wasn&rsquo;t the only thing though because there was Sansa Stark wearing Jon&rsquo;s sweatshirt and seemingly nothing else while Jon stood there wearing an apron and a pair of his boxers and they were locked in what could only been considered a truly sloppy make-out.&nbsp;</p><p>She reached behind her and shielded Robb&rsquo;s eyes as she cleared her throat.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Ella, it&rsquo;s a little late for that,&rdquo; Robb grumbled as Jon and Sansa broke apart.&nbsp;</p><p>Sansa blushed and Jon grinned and Ella squealed and Robb groaned.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you have enough for us?,&rdquo; Ella asked, hoping some food would settle Robb&rsquo;s stomach.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Always, little one,&rdquo; Jon said with a grin, clearly too delirious with happiness to care much for his best friend&rsquo;s (and apparent future brother-in-law&rsquo;s) comfort.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Robb why don&rsquo;t you set the table?,&rdquo; she suggested. &ldquo;Jon&hellip; I think there is some champagne in the fridge in the laundry room? I think this calls for celebratory mimosas&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>They both went to do her bidding and she ran and jumped at Sansa, wrapping her legs around her the way she&rsquo;d just had her legs around Robb.&nbsp;</p><p>Sansa hugged her back, the pair of them wiggling in excitement.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay so I know that you probably want to spend every minute with Jon right now, but you&rsquo;ll save me some time and tell me the whole story, right?,&rdquo; Ella asked her and hopped down.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course I will,&rdquo; Sansa said, using some tongs to flip the bacon. &ldquo;Wait until I tell you about his superpower&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Ella giggled, &ldquo;No need. I&rsquo;m the one who discovered it.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa turned to her and said, &ldquo;Um&hellip;I fucking hope not because it involves his tongue and a part of your body that I truly pray he&rsquo;s never seen&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Ella looked at her and Sansa looked so smugly satisfied that Ella couldn&rsquo;t help the scream that erupted her from her mouth. She wrapped Sansa in her arms again and they didn&rsquo;t break apart until Robb and Jon collided with each other coming into the kitchen.&nbsp;</p><p>Robb held the fire extinguisher and Jon had taken off the apron and was wielding it like he might smother something with it.&nbsp;</p><p>Her and Sansa giggled and rolled their eyes as Robb and Jon seemed to slowly understand that they were not in fact in danger.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;At ease, gentlemen,&rdquo; Sansa said with a grin.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, we&rsquo;ve got it all under control,&rdquo; Ella agreed.&nbsp;</p><p>Robb and Jon straightened up and soon there were champagne glasses taken out and no one cared that they didn&rsquo;t have any orange juice because they were too busy toasting to the new couple.&nbsp;</p><p>*</p><p>&ldquo;You should ignore my texts more often,&rdquo; she whispered to Robb as they did the dishes after breakfast.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll remind you that you said that,&rdquo; he told her.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Just make sure you take a page out of Jon&rsquo;s book and bring lavender donuts with you next time that you do,&rdquo; she suggested.&nbsp;</p><p>Robb opened his mouth as if to protest, but she cut off whatever he was going to say with a kiss. He sunk into her the way he always did and it was all the sweeter knowing that their best friends&rsquo; hearts were safe, the way he&rsquo;d always kept hers.&nbsp;</p><p><i>And they say cleanses don&rsquo;t work&hellip;</i></p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p>This is for my baby <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mlTfK4ggtX76l7s4JyOzNqg\">@octaviahales</a> who has been giving me the best prompts. Ah I loved writing this one. Hope you enjoy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p><i>Promise me, </i>the text message said.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They ignored it, like always.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Jon had been all bravado, but that was because he wasn&rsquo;t going to be the one to face her wrath. That would fall to him, which was why there was a small box of lavender donuts on his lap on top of the container holding the lemon pie he&rsquo;d picked up from Nan&rsquo;s for Sansa.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>His little sister had gone through another break-up. He had been assured by Ella that it was not the worst one by far - that one still haunted them all - instead this had been <i>mere </i>cheating.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He had been assured that Ella <i>had </i>it. That she and Sansa were going to have a night in and that he and Jon were not needed <i>thank you very much</i> and that she would call them tomorrow to let them know the degree to which they needed to beat up Harry Hardyng but that until then they should sit tight because Sansa needed <i>affection </i>and <i>alcohol </i>and not to hear about all the ways in which Harry was a deadman and how he never deserved her and how they had all told her so (he&rsquo;d like to say she made them sound worse than they were but in truth, Ella was never wrong). She had, however, stipulated that Grey Wind and Ghost&rsquo;s presence was desired so she had picked them up from his and Jon&rsquo;s apartment an hour before on her way to pick-up pizza.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Jon had simply scoffed at the text message from Ella, grabbing his coat and a bottle of Sansa&rsquo;s favorite wine that they always kept a case of, as well as his old Direwolves football sweatshirt that he always brought her on occasions such as this. After Ramsay Jon had suggested she keep the sweater after she spent a week straight wearing it, but Sansa had assured him that it would lose its magic that way and that he should hold onto it for safe keeping.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Now, if you are wondering <i>why </i>exactly Sansa would have been dating someone else only to be<i> </i>in this position, when she had a man who always made sure to have her favorite wine, and had a dog that treated Sansa like she was his baby, and who would wrap her up in his arms the way she wrapped herself in his sweatshirt if she only asked him to, you would be in very good company.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The answer, however, was sadly that <i>despite </i>the fact that Jon Snow had loved Sansa Stark ever since he met her after his first peewee football game at the tender age of eleven he had never actually <i>told </i>her so.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sansa had taken a little longer to realise her feelings for Jon. It was a whole week later in fact when they rode on the tilt-a-whirl together at the Winterfell Carnival and he&rsquo;d held her hand and hadn&rsquo;t told anyone that she&rsquo;d been afraid. She, of course, had never told him this either and so she found herself in a series of relationships that went from the very boring to the very terrifying.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At the end of each of them Jon was always there. Along with him, but he was her big brother and had never been able to stand it when she was upset, and Ella, her best friend and the ultimate love of her life.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>By now there was a routine to things.</p>\n<p>Ella always told them to be calm, and not charge in, with one exception, and they always ignored her.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Jon was fearless when it came to Ella because she gave him a <i>pass </i>because even though Sansa didn&rsquo;t know that he was in love with her, Ella did, and she knew how much more acutely he felt each of these break-ups, because he knew that if he only had the chance that Sansa would never cry again. She would never be cheated on or talked down to, she would never have to wonder because he&rsquo;d tell her every day, that she was the one, the only one, that he was hers forever and if she&rsquo;d only tell him how, he would do everything in his power to make her happy. He&rsquo;d tell her every day, if he only could get the courage to tell her once.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Robb, on the other hand, did not get a pass from Ella. She was all bark and no bite, and wasn&rsquo;t much bark, but even still he couldn&rsquo;t stand it when she looked at him with anything other than love in her eyes. Because the thing was, Jon was not the only man who&rsquo;d fallen in love at the tender age of eleven, the only difference was that Robb hadn&rsquo;t been able to stand it past the age of seventeen, when he&rsquo;d finally asked Ella to be his. The truth was, she very rarely looked at him with anything short of love, even when she was frustrated with him, because he had stolen her heart when he recovered her stolen kite and she had never once considered asking for it back.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Even still, he felt safer with the lavender donuts in hand.&nbsp;</p>\n</p>",

Again, he wondered at how she was able to be thusly open with him, whereas she remained in her proverbial cage all day when in the presence of others.</p><p>&ldquo;Do what,&rdquo; he asked, though not in the form of a question.</p><p>Her insolence irritated him. Hells, her insolence intrigued him, too, but he wasn&rsquo;t going to tell her that. She was a conundrum, a puzzle left for him to figure out silently in his own time, without any input from her.</p><p>&ldquo;Scare away that squirrel,&rdquo; she said, her voice only slightly colored with irritation. &ldquo;I was feeding him&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aye, you were feeding him our food. Unwise, little bird. Stupid.&rdquo;</p><p>Her eyes flashed at him for a moment before she schooled them back into cold, blue, motionless pools.</p><p>&ldquo;A few crumbs wouldn&rsquo;t have mattered.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo;</p><p>Irritated now, Sandor lept at the opportunity to put her in her place - no less than what she deserved for keeping him off kilter that morning.</p><p>&ldquo;Then go ahead and feed all your fucking food to the animals. You&rsquo;ll get none of mine.&rdquo;</p><p>Then he turned, ignoring any reaction that might have come across her face at his words. He didn&rsquo;t need to be affected by her. Didn&rsquo;t need the hassle of an emotional female.</p><p>&hellip;</p><p>That didn&rsquo;t stop him from slowing his steps, however, and keeping them measured, and listening above them until he finally heard the soft pad of her footfalls behind him.</p>",

He\u2019s a lecher, he\u2019s a creep, he\u2019s a weird old man chasing a child. (I\u2019m reminded of the dismay of some shippers when a 40 something year old Hound was cast, as if the problem started there lol.) But to be fair, bar a small subset of shippers, most think of Littlefinger that way anyway, even those who enjoy his character for the great villain he is. (Or was, in the show\u2019s case. He lost the plot pretty quick there.)</p>\n\n<p>I don\u2019t know what the appeal is in shipping them when Sansa is just a kid and Littlefinger is a life ruining murderer, who likes to sell little girls into sexual slavery, trigger civil wars and has a hand in nearly all of Sansa\u2019s misfortune, starting from her father\u2019s murder. I suppose some people like the whole \u201cI hate everyone and everything\u2026 except you\u201d trope (which is prevalent in quite a few Sansa ships), which I\u2019d get if, you know, Littlefinger wasn\u2019t manipulating her and destroying her life, while preying on her since she was 11. Tbh Littlefinger truly loving Sansa in any way that matters is the biggest joke in the series, second only to him supposedly loving Cat (I don\u2019t think anyone has ever loved anyone less). I don\u2019t know that anyone can truly kid themselves that he\u2019s anything but the architect of all her misery and suffering.</p>\n\n<p>But it\u2019s gonna end in one way only, and that\u2019s Sansa taking all he\u2019s taught her to turn it on him and take him down (without the show\u2019s invented idiocy) for good. Their teacher-student sideplot is one of my favourites of the series and I know it\u2019s going to culminate in a magnificent end, with him getting exactly what he deserves and no room left to deny how pathetic and poisonous a man he is, or how truly depraved his infatuation with Sansa is.
