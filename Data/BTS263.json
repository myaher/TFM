It\u2019s not like he\u2019s going to stop making them, it\u2019s more like he\u2019ll feel a bit more stumped or his personal flare that he had with the first one could taper off. However, I think the more comfortable he gets with it or the more encouragement he has to express himself as naturally as possible the more his creativity can flow. Like, the reason the first GCF was so lovely and really touched everyone was because he did it without any critical thinking of his work, like he hadn\u2019t put anything out so there were no opinions to consider while he was making it, he was just putting his heart and soul into as he saw fit. He definitely did that as well with the others, but there is a noticeable concern now with needing things to be a bit more polished and pleasing for the viewer rather than just something that allows him to capture something that he finds meaningful and important.</p><p>As for his photography, I think it\u2019s the same with Taehyung where it\u2019s a bit more experimental and it\u2019s something that is more in line with a hobby. I think he genuinely does like video editing/filmmaking a bit more as he has more control over it and he can kind of express more of himself a little easier through that by adding more of his personal taste to it. Photography, when you\u2019re still in the beginning stages of learning\u00a0the ins and outs, can be a bit more technical, so I\u2019m sure he finds a little bit more freedom in making his short films. Plus that rampant sentimentality that he has can be used much better with videos where there are basically millions of photos in one go, lol.\u00a0</p>",

It\u2019s not like he\u2019s going to stop making them, it\u2019s more like he\u2019ll feel a bit more stumped or his personal flare that he had with the first one could taper off. However, I think the more comfortable he gets with it or the more encouragement he has to express himself as naturally as possible the more his creativity can flow. Like, the reason the first GCF was so lovely and really touched everyone was because he did it without any critical thinking of his work, like he hadn\u2019t put anything out so there were no opinions to consider while he was making it, he was just putting his heart and soul into as he saw fit.

I think he genuinely does like video editing/filmmaking a bit more as he has more control over it and he can kind of express more of himself a little easier through that by adding more of his personal taste to it. Photography, when you\u2019re still in the beginning stages of learning\u00a0the ins and outs, can be a bit more technical, so I\u2019m sure he finds a little bit more freedom in making his short films. Plus that rampant sentimentality that he has can be used much better with videos where there are basically millions of photos in one go, lol.\u00a0</p>",
