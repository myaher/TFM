        "body": "<p>So, here it is already, the next chapter of my longfic\u2026 Sansa and D\u00a0 meet for negotiations. Also on <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/8470255/chapters/42242552\">AO3</a>.</p><p><br/></p><p>Arya checked her knives multiple times. She felt safer with them. She was uneasy that Sansa had chosen Jaime as an escort. She didn\u2019t trust the Lannister, even if he went by the name of Tarth now. \u00a0</p><!-- more --><p>Sansa had told her, it might fall to her to avenge her if anything went wrong, and this thought was not helping her to calm down. \u00a0</p><p>She tried to shut out the noise of the courtyard around her and pictured a calm lake, undisturbed by any ripples on the water, a clear mirror to the clouds and trees above. She balanced on one foot, until she stopped shaking. \u00a0</p><p>She inhaled and let the brisk winter air clear her lungs. She did not look at the people that had assembled in the courtyard. She knew if she would really look at them, she might spot Gendry, and she had to hold on to her calmness. Even the thought of him made her cheeks burn. \u00a0</p><p>She mounted her horse. Ser Jaime and Sansa were in the saddle already. Arya looked at the sky. She did not want to look at the faces around her she knew would be miserable. She imagined a dragon flying there and felt small and vulnerable. She wondered why Bran had told Jon to scout on Rhaegal. She wished she could be sure that Bran was not moving them all on a giant board of cyvasse. </p><p>When the gate opened, Sansa urged her mount to a canter and Arya followed. Just on the other side of the field she could see three mounts, on one of them a figure smaller then the others that was probably Tyrion. Between their two parties a table had been placed, guarded by one Winterfell guard and one from Daenerys\u2019 side, just like Sansa had instructed. </p><p>Arya thought about the lake again, how the water would not be disturbed and drew deep breaths. At least I won\u2019t be expected to do the talking. \u2018I know you like to speak your mind, but I doubt Daenerys would like that. Let me do the negotiations. Even if you think she insults us, do not interfere.\u2019 </p><p>When they reached the table, they dismounted. Queen Daenerys\u2019 guard came over. He was a slender young man with light brown skin, but Arya did not doubt that he was a fighter. He gave a very short nod. Then he held out his hands. Jaime was the first to hand over his blade and Arya did the same. For good measure she reached down and added the knife from her boot. Sansa gave him her own small cutting knife and then showed her palms. The young man nodded. Just like Arya had predicted he did not search Sansa. The knife sewn into the folds of her skirts went unnoticed. Arya felt a bit better, more confident. </p><p>Their guard did the same with Queen Daenerys and her companions. Arya identified Daenerys immediately. She had the platinum hair of her family and was very beautiful, although she had a haunted look about her. One of her companions was Tyrion, just as Bran had predicted. He looked pale and wan, not the boisterous loud man, Arya had seen at Winterfell so many years ago. Their other companion was a pretty young girl with the curliest hair Arya had ever seen. Just like the young man her clothes did not seem to be appropriate for the snowy weather. Her nose was paler than the rest of her face and Arya suspected she was from a much warmer climate. </p><p>The two parties stood facing each other and everyone gave just short nods. Sansa made a sweeping gesture with her Hand. </p><p>\u201cPlease sit.\u201d </p><p>Daenerys frowned. \u201cIt should be my place to grant permission to sit. I am the Queen.\u201d </p><p>Sansa smiled and inclined her head. \u201cIf you want to.\u201d </p><p>Daenerys copied Sansa\u2019s gesture and they all sat down. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhere is my nephew?\u201d </p><p>\u201cKing Jon is scouting in the North. We expect another attack of the White Walkers soon.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOn the dragon he stole from me.\u201d </p><p>Arya clenched her jaw. She had not expected to be tempted so early to interrupt. Sansa\u2019s hand came down on her tigh, fast. Her sister did not look at her, but Arya could hear her again. \u2018Let me do the talking.\u2019 </p><p>Sansa smiled, and it didn\u2019t even look strained, her voice was soothing. </p><p>\u201cJon took Rhaegal in the hour of our greatest need. Without him you would have been met by an army of Undead, swelled in numbers by all the dead of Winterfell.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo, you acknowledge that you owe me? Without my dragon you would all be dead.\u201d </p><p>Arya concentrated on studying the pattern in the wood on the table. She had promised her sister not to lose her temper. One quick grab at Sansa\u2019s dress, retrieve the knife, bury it in her heart. She pressed the palm of her hand on her knee. </p><p>\u201cIf you would have agreed to come directly to fight the White Walkers, we might have defeated them already.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Sansa shrugged. \u201cYou must admit that it is of little use to discuss what might have been. I would rather talk about what will be.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI do have an army that outnumbers yours, I do have a dragon, while my nephew is not here.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI am sure Lord Royce has told you, that we have wildfire and catapults. Yes, you could destroy us, but you yourself might not survive it.\u201d </p><p>Arya saw that a shadow passed over Tyrion\u2019s face. Jaime narrowed his eyes, his left hand hovering over where usually his sword hang. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd you know that, or you would not be here talking with me.\u201d Sansa added. </p><p>\u201cIf we cannot undo the past and cannot fight on the field to decide if my nephew or I get the crown, what do you suggest?\u201d </p><p>\u201cFirst things first,\u201d Sansa said. \u201cWe have to defeat the Night King, and for this we should all fight on the side of the living.\u201d </p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cFor afterwards, I do have a suggestion: a Great Council. All the lords of the seven kingsdoms should convene and decide on the succession. This would guarantee a stable rule for the huge tasks that awaits us when spring comes. And there is precedent that Great Councils in the past solved the succession.\u201d </p><p>Arya looked at her sister. Like when Aegon IV was raised. Or was it the fifth Aegon? It had been the Aegon who appointed Duncan the Tall, Arya knew that. </p><p>\u201cAnd come spring how many of those lords will vote for my nephew?\u201d Daenerys asked. \u201cWhat about all the lords who have a connection to his lady wife?\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cIf you fight for your people, they will value you. You do have Tyrion and the West.\u201d Sansa pointed at Jaime. \u201cSer Jaime here publically announced that he forsakes any claim on Casterly Rock. Your hand is the Warden of the West.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>For the first time, Tyrion looked at Jaime, but could not meet his eyes for long. Arya wondered what troubled him. </p><p>\u201cAnd you might consider a marriage alliance with the Vale or the Reach.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Arya had to suppress a laugh. Sansa sounded almost as if she wanted to be helpful. </p><p>\u201cI am sure you are aware Jon does not really want the Iron Throne. He would be content with the North,\u201d Sansa finally added. </p><p>\u201cWould he? He married the woman with the best connections in the seven kingdoms. As queen of the seven kingdoms I should have had a say in your marriage.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou are not crowned yet.\u201d There was a slight strain in Sansa\u2019s voice, but Arya doubted anyone but her would have realised. </p><p>Daenerys waved her hand dismissively. \u201cThat is not important. I hold King\u2019s Landing. I will return there, but I wanted to see for myself, what my unruly nephew wants.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>It was quiet enough that Arya could hear a particularly loud intake of breath by Tyrion. The Lannister looked at the table, his shoulders looked strained, as if he pressed his hands together under the table. Ser Jaime was getting fidgety. He looked intensely at his brother. </p><p>\u201cJon wants Westeros free of the threat of the Undead.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd nothing more? I think we should be honest with each other. I might agree to a ceasefire to defeat the White Walkers, but you have to give me some surety. I would not believe any promise my nephew or you give. Not from the woman who adviced my nephew to play me. So, what have you to offer?\u201d </p><p>Sansa flushed, her cheeks were burning, but otherwise she stayed calm. </p><p>\u201cMy brother,\u201d Sansa answered. </p><p>For a moment Arya was confused. Bran, she is talking about Bran. </p><p>\u201cThat would be the last trueborn son of Eddard Stark?\u201d Daenerys asked. </p><p>Sansa nodded. </p><p>\u201cBut he renounced his claim to Winterfell, I don\u2019t see any advantage.\u201d Tyrion objected, talking for the first time since he had taken a seat. </p><p>Arya felt Sansa\u2019s hand come down on hers again. She hadn\u2019t even realised that her hand was already halfway to the knife hidden in Sansa\u2019s skirt. </p><p>Sansa smiled, a smile that did not reach her eyes. </p><p>\u201cNo rival claim to Winterfell, sure enough. You did not expect me to offer that. My brother is a seer. You can get a glimpse into the future.\u201d </p><p>\u201cA seer? Or a prophet? I\u2019ve seen enough of that\u201d Daenerys made too much of an effort to be dismissive of the idea, but Arya could hear that she was hooked. </p><p>\u201cI thought only priests of Rh\u2019llor supposedly can see the future in their flames.\u201d Tyrion mused. </p><p>\u201cBran was blessed by the old Gods. He doesn\u2019t study flames. He says, he sees threads of the possible future and he can work for the best result. Without him we would not have been able to defeat the White Walkers.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Arya noted that Sansa had left out some of the things Bran could do. </p><p>\u201cSo, he sees what might happen? Why would he show me the future?\u201d Daenerys wanted to know. </p><p>Sansa bowed her head, just a tiny bit and lowered her eyes. Her lashes threw a shadow on her cheeks. </p><p>\u201cYou are the last true Targaryen. He has seen you often. He says you have a destiny.\u201d </p><p>Arya could see that Daenerys held back not to show her interest too openly. </p><p>\u201cSo, we fight together against the White Walkers and agree to sort the succession out afterwards\u2026. Acmicably, of course. And as a token of good will you offer your brother and a view into the future.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd I offer clothing for your army, as far as we can help. There is also food for your dragon, as long as he stays out of Winterfell.\u201d </p><p>Daenerys looked at the young girl, who was not clothed fo the cold. </p><p>\u201cI think we have grounds for an understanding\u201d Daenerys finally said. </p><p>Arya wished she knew why she looked satisfied like a cat with a cream pot. What in seven hells is Bran\u2019s plan? She wants clothing and food, but she wants more to see into the future, why? </p><p>\u201cWe should take bread and salt to confirm this.\u201d Sansa said. On this cue, Jaime brought a basket with bread. \u00a0</p><p>It was only a small bread, and they finished it fast, but the formality was done. If she doesn\u2019t want to keep her word, bread is not going to change that. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come to Winterfell tomorrow. I expect a welcome fit for a queen.\u201d Daenerys said. </p><p>Daenerys stood up, so that she could look down on Sansa. </p><p>\u201cHe married you for your claim, didn\u2019t he? For your claim and the support from the North, to save his power. Did he even consummate the marriage?\u201d </p><p>Blood rushed to Sansa\u2019s face. Arya flexed her fingers. She ached for that knife. She was quite sure, that that had been aimed to unsettle Sansa. </p><p>For the third time, Sansa pressed her thigh under the table and Arya schooled her face. </p><p>Sansa stood as well, she did not answer the question, her gaze was lowered. Daenerys smiled. It was not a nice smile. </p><p>\u201cI see, you do not deign to answer. I guess you can wait some time until he touches you. Several men have told me, that they would not want to taste any other woman after they knew the mother of dragons.\u201d </p><p>Sansa\u2019s face went even darker, but she remained silent. Does she insinuate that Jon slept with her? Arya felt for her sister. Surely that was a mean remark. If Daenerys had wanted to throw Sansa of balance, she had succeeded, but Sansa pressed her lips together and remained silent. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cWinterfell will be prepared for you,\u201d Sansa said. Arya could barely hear a strain in her voice and Arya was very proud of her sister. </p><p>When they sat on their horses agan and were out of earshot, Arya felt it was safe to remark on the negotiation, but she decided to be quiet about Daenerys attempt to bait Sansa. </p><p>\u201cThat went better than I expected. I hope she keeps her promises.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI doubt it. She didn\u2019t keep her promise to Jon, although I doubt she see it that way.\u201d Sansa frowned. \u201cI really wish Bran wouldn\u2019t be so secretive and he would tell me why he thinks this is necessary. I am uneasy.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYour grace, what did she mean by that last remark?\u201d Ser Jaime asked. He looked at Sansa from the side his face looking troubled and concerned. </p><p>Sansa laughed, a clear sound that Arya did not expect. </p><p>\u201cThere is no need to fret, Ser Jaime,\u201d Sansa said. \u201cDaenerys thought that she could deal me a bad hand. But she told me nothing I did not know.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAre you telling me, Jon slept with Daenerys and you knew that?\u201d Ser Jaime asked. \u00a0</p><p>Arya was shocked. </p><p>\u201cThat was before Sam had told him about his parents, and he had contemplated a marriage alliance to commit Daenerys to our cause.\u201d </p><p>Arya tried to understand. \u201cYou seem more sanguine about this than mere moments ago.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI think your sister could put a mummer to shame with her acting. I was tempted to challenge Daenerys to a duel\u201d Jaime remarked. </p><p>\u201cThere is absolutely no need for that. She wanted to insult me and did not realise that her insult did not hit. If I have to act flustered so that she won\u2019t rain dragonfire on Winterfell, I will act flustered,\u201d Sansa told him. </p><p>\u201cMight I suggest something, your Grace?\u201d Jaime asked. </p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI think it would be wise, if you do nothing to enlighten Daenerys about the truth. I suggest you give her a chamber far away from your own.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Jaime Lannister grinned and had the audacity to even wink at Sansa. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou would not want Daenerys to hear\u2026. \u201c he interrupted himself. \u201c You would not want Danerys\u2019s sleep to be interrupted by strange noises.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>This time when Sansa blushed it was not an act, Arya was sure. What in seven hells is it with all this blushing! </p>",

Also on <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/8470255/chapters/42242552\">AO3</a>.</p><p><br></p><p>Arya checked her knives multiple times. She felt safer with them. She was uneasy that Sansa had chosen Jaime as an escort. She didn\u2019t trust the Lannister, even if he went by the name of Tarth now. \u00a0</p>[[MORE]]<p>Sansa had told her, it might fall to her to avenge her if anything went wrong, and this thought was not helping her to calm down. \u00a0</p><p>She tried to shut out the noise of the courtyard around her and pictured a calm lake, undisturbed by any ripples on the water, a clear mirror to the clouds and trees above. She balanced on one foot, until she stopped shaking. \u00a0</p><p>She inhaled and let the brisk winter air clear her lungs. She did not look at the people that had assembled in the courtyard. She knew if she would really look at them, she might spot Gendry, and she had to hold on to her calmness. Even the thought of him made her cheeks burn. \u00a0</p><p>She mounted her horse. Ser Jaime and Sansa were in the saddle already. Arya looked at the sky. She did not want to look at the faces around her she knew would be miserable. She imagined a dragon flying there and felt small and vulnerable. She wondered why Bran had told Jon to scout on Rhaegal. She wished she could be sure that Bran was not moving them all on a giant board of cyvasse. </p><p>When the gate opened, Sansa urged her mount to a canter and Arya followed. Just on the other side of the field she could see three mounts, on one of them a figure smaller then the others that was probably Tyrion. Between their two parties a table had been placed, guarded by one Winterfell guard and one from Daenerys\u2019 side, just like Sansa had instructed. </p><p>Arya thought about the lake again, how the water would not be disturbed and drew deep breaths. At least I won\u2019t be expected to do the talking. \u2018I know you like to speak your mind, but I doubt Daenerys would like that. Let me do the negotiations. Even if you think she insults us, do not interfere.\u2019 </p><p>When they reached the table, they dismounted. Queen Daenerys\u2019 guard came over. He was a slender young man with light brown skin, but Arya did not doubt that he was a fighter. He gave a very short nod. Then he held out his hands. Jaime was the first to hand over his blade and Arya did the same. For good measure she reached down and added the knife from her boot. Sansa gave him her own small cutting knife and then showed her palms. The young man nodded. Just like Arya had predicted he did not search Sansa. The knife sewn into the folds of her skirts went unnoticed. Arya felt a bit better, more confident. </p><p>Their guard did the same with Queen Daenerys and her companions. Arya identified Daenerys immediately. She had the platinum hair of her family and was very beautiful, although she had a haunted look about her. One of her companions was Tyrion, just as Bran had predicted. He looked pale and wan, not the boisterous loud man, Arya had seen at Winterfell so many years ago. Their other companion was a pretty young girl with the curliest hair Arya had ever seen. Just like the young man her clothes did not seem to be appropriate for the snowy weather. Her nose was paler than the rest of her face and Arya suspected she was from a much warmer climate. </p><p>The two parties stood facing each other and everyone gave just short nods. Sansa made a sweeping gesture with her Hand. </p><p>\u201cPlease sit.\u201d </p><p>Daenerys frowned. \u201cIt should be my place to grant permission to sit. I am the Queen.\u201d </p><p>Sansa smiled and inclined her head. \u201cIf you want to.\u201d </p><p>Daenerys copied Sansa\u2019s gesture and they all sat down. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhere is my nephew?\u201d </p><p>\u201cKing Jon is scouting in the North. We expect another attack of the White Walkers soon.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOn the dragon he stole from me.\u201d </p><p>Arya clenched her jaw. She had not expected to be tempted so early to interrupt. Sansa\u2019s hand came down on her tigh, fast. Her sister did not look at her, but Arya could hear her again. \u2018Let me do the talking.\u2019 </p><p>Sansa smiled, and it didn\u2019t even look strained, her voice was soothing. </p><p>\u201cJon took Rhaegal in the hour of our greatest need. Without him you would have been met by an army of Undead, swelled in numbers by all the dead of Winterfell.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo, you acknowledge that you owe me? Without my dragon you would all be dead.\u201d </p><p>Arya concentrated on studying the pattern in the wood on the table. She had promised her sister not to lose her temper. One quick grab at Sansa\u2019s dress, retrieve the knife, bury it in her heart. She pressed the palm of her hand on her knee. </p><p>\u201cIf you would have agreed to come directly to fight the White Walkers, we might have defeated them already.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Sansa shrugged. \u201cYou must admit that it is of little use to discuss what might have been. I would rather talk about what will be.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI do have an army that outnumbers yours, I do have a dragon, while my nephew is not here.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI am sure Lord Royce has told you, that we have wildfire and catapults. Yes, you could destroy us, but you yourself might not survive it.\u201d </p><p>Arya saw that a shadow passed over Tyrion\u2019s face. Jaime narrowed his eyes, his left hand hovering over where usually his sword hang. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd you know that, or you would not be here talking with me.\u201d Sansa added. </p><p>\u201cIf we cannot undo the past and cannot fight on the field to decide if my nephew or I get the crown, what do you suggest?\u201d </p><p>\u201cFirst things first,\u201d Sansa said. \u201cWe have to defeat the Night King, and for this we should all fight on the side of the living.\u201d </p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cFor afterwards, I do have a suggestion: a Great Council.

Also on <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/8470255/chapters/42242552\">AO3</a>.</p><p><br></p><p>Arya checked her knives multiple times. She felt safer with them. She was uneasy that Sansa had chosen Jaime as an escort. She didn\u2019t trust the Lannister, even if he went by the name of Tarth now. \u00a0</p>[[MORE]]<p>Sansa had told her, it might fall to her to avenge her if anything went wrong, and this thought was not helping her to calm down. \u00a0</p><p>She tried to shut out the noise of the courtyard around her and pictured a calm lake, undisturbed by any ripples on the water, a clear mirror to the clouds and trees above. She balanced on one foot, until she stopped shaking. \u00a0</p><p>She inhaled and let the brisk winter air clear her lungs. She did not look at the people that had assembled in the courtyard. She knew if she would really look at them, she might spot Gendry, and she had to hold on to her calmness. Even the thought of him made her cheeks burn. \u00a0</p><p>She mounted her horse. Ser Jaime and Sansa were in the saddle already. Arya looked at the sky. She did not want to look at the faces around her she knew would be miserable. She imagined a dragon flying there and felt small and vulnerable. She wondered why Bran had told Jon to scout on Rhaegal. She wished she could be sure that Bran was not moving them all on a giant board of cyvasse. </p><p>When the gate opened, Sansa urged her mount to a canter and Arya followed. Just on the other side of the field she could see three mounts, on one of them a figure smaller then the others that was probably Tyrion. Between their two parties a table had been placed, guarded by one Winterfell guard and one from Daenerys\u2019 side, just like Sansa had instructed. </p><p>Arya thought about the lake again, how the water would not be disturbed and drew deep breaths. At least I won\u2019t be expected to do the talking. \u2018I know you like to speak your mind, but I doubt Daenerys would like that. Let me do the negotiations. Even if you think she insults us, do not interfere.\u2019 </p><p>When they reached the table, they dismounted. Queen Daenerys\u2019 guard came over. He was a slender young man with light brown skin, but Arya did not doubt that he was a fighter. He gave a very short nod. Then he held out his hands. Jaime was the first to hand over his blade and Arya did the same. For good measure she reached down and added the knife from her boot. Sansa gave him her own small cutting knife and then showed her palms. The young man nodded. Just like Arya had predicted he did not search Sansa. The knife sewn into the folds of her skirts went unnoticed. Arya felt a bit better, more confident. </p><p>Their guard did the same with Queen Daenerys and her companions. Arya identified Daenerys immediately. She had the platinum hair of her family and was very beautiful, although she had a haunted look about her. One of her companions was Tyrion, just as Bran had predicted. He looked pale and wan, not the boisterous loud man, Arya had seen at Winterfell so many years ago. Their other companion was a pretty young girl with the curliest hair Arya had ever seen. Just like the young man her clothes did not seem to be appropriate for the snowy weather. Her nose was paler than the rest of her face and Arya suspected she was from a much warmer climate. </p><p>The two parties stood facing each other and everyone gave just short nods. Sansa made a sweeping gesture with her Hand. </p><p>\u201cPlease sit.\u201d </p><p>Daenerys frowned. \u201cIt should be my place to grant permission to sit. I am the Queen.\u201d </p><p>Sansa smiled and inclined her head. \u201cIf you want to.\u201d </p><p>Daenerys copied Sansa\u2019s gesture and they all sat down. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhere is my nephew?\u201d </p><p>\u201cKing Jon is scouting in the North. We expect another attack of the White Walkers soon.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOn the dragon he stole from me.\u201d </p><p>Arya clenched her jaw. She had not expected to be tempted so early to interrupt. Sansa\u2019s hand came down on her tigh, fast. Her sister did not look at her, but Arya could hear her again. \u2018Let me do the talking.\u2019 </p><p>Sansa smiled, and it didn\u2019t even look strained, her voice was soothing. </p><p>\u201cJon took Rhaegal in the hour of our greatest need. Without him you would have been met by an army of Undead, swelled in numbers by all the dead of Winterfell.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo, you acknowledge that you owe me? Without my dragon you would all be dead.\u201d </p><p>Arya concentrated on studying the pattern in the wood on the table. She had promised her sister not to lose her temper. One quick grab at Sansa\u2019s dress, retrieve the knife, bury it in her heart. She pressed the palm of her hand on her knee. </p><p>\u201cIf you would have agreed to come directly to fight the White Walkers, we might have defeated them already.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Sansa shrugged. \u201cYou must admit that it is of little use to discuss what might have been. I would rather talk about what will be.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI do have an army that outnumbers yours, I do have a dragon, while my nephew is not here.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI am sure Lord Royce has told you, that we have wildfire and catapults. Yes, you could destroy us, but you yourself might not survive it.\u201d </p><p>Arya saw that a shadow passed over Tyrion\u2019s face. Jaime narrowed his eyes, his left hand hovering over where usually his sword hang. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd you know that, or you would not be here talking with me.\u201d Sansa added. </p><p>\u201cIf we cannot undo the past and cannot fight on the field to decide if my nephew or I get the crown, what do you suggest?\u201d </p><p>\u201cFirst things first,\u201d Sansa said. \u201cWe have to defeat the Night King, and for this we should all fight on the side of the living.\u201d </p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cFor afterwards, I do have a suggestion: a Great Council. All the lords of the seven kingsdoms should convene and decide on the succession. This would guarantee a stable rule for the huge tasks that awaits us when spring comes. And there is precedent that Great Councils in the past solved the succession.\u201d </p><p>Arya looked at her sister. Like when Aegon IV was raised. Or was it the fifth Aegon? It had been the Aegon who appointed Duncan the Tall, Arya knew that. </p><p>\u201cAnd come spring how many of those lords will vote for my nephew?\u201d Daenerys asked. \u201cWhat about all the lords who have a connection to his lady wife?\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cIf you fight for your people, they will value you. You do have Tyrion and the West.\u201d Sansa pointed at Jaime. \u201cSer Jaime here publically announced that he forsakes any claim on Casterly Rock. Your hand is the Warden of the West.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>For the first time, Tyrion looked at Jaime, but could not meet his eyes for long. Arya wondered what troubled him. </p><p>\u201cAnd you might consider a marriage alliance with the Vale or the Reach.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Arya had to suppress a laugh. Sansa sounded almost as if she wanted to be helpful. </p><p>\u201cI am sure you are aware Jon does not really want the Iron Throne. He would be content with the North,\u201d Sansa finally added. </p><p>\u201cWould he? He married the woman with the best connections in the seven kingdoms. As queen of the seven kingdoms I should have had a say in your marriage.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou are not crowned yet.\u201d There was a slight strain in Sansa\u2019s voice, but Arya doubted anyone but her would have realised. </p><p>Daenerys waved her hand dismissively. \u201cThat is not important. I hold King\u2019s Landing. I will return there, but I wanted to see for myself, what my unruly nephew wants.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>It was quiet enough that Arya could hear a particularly loud intake of breath by Tyrion. The Lannister looked at the table, his shoulders looked strained, as if he pressed his hands together under the table. Ser Jaime was getting fidgety. He looked intensely at his brother. </p><p>\u201cJon wants Westeros free of the threat of the Undead.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd nothing more? I think we should be honest with each other. I might agree to a ceasefire to defeat the White Walkers, but you have to give me some surety. I would not believe any promise my nephew or you give. Not from the woman who adviced my nephew to play me. So, what have you to offer?\u201d </p><p>Sansa flushed, her cheeks were burning, but otherwise she stayed calm. </p><p>\u201cMy brother,\u201d Sansa answered. </p><p>For a moment Arya was confused. Bran, she is talking about Bran. </p><p>\u201cThat would be the last trueborn son of Eddard Stark?\u201d Daenerys asked. </p><p>Sansa nodded. </p><p>\u201cBut he renounced his claim to Winterfell, I don\u2019t see any advantage.\u201d Tyrion objected, talking for the first time since he had taken a seat. </p><p>Arya felt Sansa\u2019s hand come down on hers again. She hadn\u2019t even realised that her hand was already halfway to the knife hidden in Sansa\u2019s skirt. </p><p>Sansa smiled, a smile that did not reach her eyes. </p><p>\u201cNo rival claim to Winterfell, sure enough. You did not expect me to offer that. My brother is a seer. You can get a glimpse into the future.\u201d </p><p>\u201cA seer? Or a prophet? I\u2019ve seen enough of that\u201d Daenerys made too much of an effort to be dismissive of the idea, but Arya could hear that she was hooked. </p><p>\u201cI thought only priests of Rh\u2019llor supposedly can see the future in their flames.\u201d Tyrion mused. </p><p>\u201cBran was blessed by the old Gods. He doesn\u2019t study flames. He says, he sees threads of the possible future and he can work for the best result. Without him we would not have been able to defeat the White Walkers.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Arya noted that Sansa had left out some of the things Bran could do. </p><p>\u201cSo, he sees what might happen? Why would he show me the future?\u201d Daenerys wanted to know. </p><p>Sansa bowed her head, just a tiny bit and lowered her eyes. Her lashes threw a shadow on her cheeks. </p><p>\u201cYou are the last true Targaryen. He has seen you often. He says you have a destiny.\u201d </p><p>Arya could see that Daenerys held back not to show her interest too openly. </p><p>\u201cSo, we fight together against the White Walkers and agree to sort the succession out afterwards\u2026. Acmicably, of course. And as a token of good will you offer your brother and a view into the future.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd I offer clothing for your army, as far as we can help. There is also food for your dragon, as long as he stays out of Winterfell.\u201d </p><p>Daenerys looked at the young girl, who was not clothed fo the cold. </p><p>\u201cI think we have grounds for an understanding\u201d Daenerys finally said. </p><p>Arya wished she knew why she looked satisfied like a cat with a cream pot. What in seven hells is Bran\u2019s plan? She wants clothing and food, but she wants more to see into the future, why? </p><p>\u201cWe should take bread and salt to confirm this.\u201d Sansa said. On this cue, Jaime brought a basket with bread. \u00a0</p><p>It was only a small bread, and they finished it fast, but the formality was done. If she doesn\u2019t want to keep her word, bread is not going to change that. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come to Winterfell tomorrow. I expect a welcome fit for a queen.\u201d Daenerys said. </p><p>Daenerys stood up, so that she could look down on Sansa. </p><p>\u201cHe married you for your claim, didn\u2019t he? For your claim and the support from the North, to save his power. Did he even consummate the marriage?\u201d </p><p>Blood rushed to Sansa\u2019s face. Arya flexed her fingers. She ached for that knife. She was quite sure, that that had been aimed to unsettle Sansa. </p><p>For the third time, Sansa pressed her thigh under the table and Arya schooled her face. </p><p>Sansa stood as well, she did not answer the question, her gaze was lowered. Daenerys smiled. It was not a nice smile. </p><p>\u201cI see, you do not deign to answer. I guess you can wait some time until he touches you. Several men have told me, that they would not want to taste any other woman after they knew the mother of dragons.\u201d </p><p>Sansa\u2019s face went even darker, but she remained silent. Does she insinuate that Jon slept with her? Arya felt for her sister. Surely that was a mean remark. If Daenerys had wanted to throw Sansa of balance, she had succeeded, but Sansa pressed her lips together and remained silent. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cWinterfell will be prepared for you,\u201d Sansa said. Arya could barely hear a strain in her voice and Arya was very proud of her sister. </p><p>When they sat on their horses agan and were out of earshot, Arya felt it was safe to remark on the negotiation, but she decided to be quiet about Daenerys attempt to bait Sansa. </p><p>\u201cThat went better than I expected. I hope she keeps her promises.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI doubt it. She didn\u2019t keep her promise to Jon, although I doubt she see it that way.\u201d Sansa frowned. \u201cI really wish Bran wouldn\u2019t be so secretive and he would tell me why he thinks this is necessary. I am uneasy.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYour grace, what did she mean by that last remark?\u201d Ser Jaime asked. He looked at Sansa from the side his face looking troubled and concerned. </p><p>Sansa laughed, a clear sound that Arya did not expect. </p><p>\u201cThere is no need to fret, Ser Jaime,\u201d Sansa said. \u201cDaenerys thought that she could deal me a bad hand. But she told me nothing I did not know.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAre you telling me, Jon slept with Daenerys and you knew that?\u201d Ser Jaime asked. \u00a0</p><p>Arya was shocked. </p><p>\u201cThat was before Sam had told him about his parents, and he had contemplated a marriage alliance to commit Daenerys to our cause.\u201d </p><p>Arya tried to understand. \u201cYou seem more sanguine about this than mere moments ago.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI think your sister could put a mummer to shame with her acting. I was tempted to challenge Daenerys to a duel\u201d Jaime remarked. </p><p>\u201cThere is absolutely no need for that. She wanted to insult me and did not realise that her insult did not hit. If I have to act flustered so that she won\u2019t rain dragonfire on Winterfell, I will act flustered,\u201d Sansa told him. </p><p>\u201cMight I suggest something, your Grace?\u201d Jaime asked. </p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI think it would be wise, if you do nothing to enlighten Daenerys about the truth. I suggest you give her a chamber far away from your own.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Jaime Lannister grinned and had the audacity to even wink at Sansa. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou would not want Daenerys to hear\u2026. \u201c he interrupted himself. \u201c You would not want Danerys\u2019s sleep to be interrupted by strange noises.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>This time when Sansa blushed it was not an act, Arya was sure. What in seven hells is it with all this blushing! </p>",

Your hand is the Warden of the West.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>For the first time, Tyrion looked at Jaime, but could not meet his eyes for long. Arya wondered what troubled him. </p><p>&ldquo;And you might consider a marriage alliance with the Vale or the Reach.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>Arya had to suppress a laugh. Sansa sounded almost as if she wanted to be helpful. </p><p>&ldquo;I am sure you are aware Jon does not really want the Iron Throne. He would be content with the North,&rdquo; Sansa finally added. </p><p>&ldquo;Would he? He married the woman with the best connections in the seven kingdoms. As queen of the seven kingdoms I should have had a say in your marriage.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You are not crowned yet.&rdquo; There was a slight strain in Sansa&rsquo;s voice, but Arya doubted anyone but her would have realised. </p><p>Daenerys waved her hand dismissively. &ldquo;That is not important. I hold King&rsquo;s Landing. I will return there, but I wanted to see for myself, what my unruly nephew wants.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>It was quiet enough that Arya could hear a particularly loud intake of breath by Tyrion. The Lannister looked at the table, his shoulders looked strained, as if he pressed his hands together under the table. Ser Jaime was getting fidgety. He looked intensely at his brother. </p><p>&ldquo;Jon wants Westeros free of the threat of the Undead.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;And nothing more? I think we should be honest with each other. I might agree to a ceasefire to defeat the White Walkers, but you have to give me some surety. I would not believe any promise my nephew or you give. Not from the woman who adviced my nephew to play me. So, what have you to offer?&rdquo; </p><p>Sansa flushed, her cheeks were burning, but otherwise she stayed calm. </p><p>&ldquo;My brother,&rdquo; Sansa answered. </p><p>For a moment Arya was confused. Bran, she is talking about Bran. </p><p>&ldquo;That would be the last trueborn son of Eddard Stark?&rdquo; Daenerys asked. </p><p>Sansa nodded. </p><p>&ldquo;But he renounced his claim to Winterfell, I don&rsquo;t see any advantage.&rdquo; Tyrion objected, talking for the first time since he had taken a seat. </p><p>Arya felt Sansa&rsquo;s hand come down on hers again. She hadn&rsquo;t even realised that her hand was already halfway to the knife hidden in Sansa&rsquo;s skirt. </p><p>Sansa smiled, a smile that did not reach her eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;No rival claim to Winterfell, sure enough. You did not expect me to offer that. My brother is a seer. You can get a glimpse into the future.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;A seer? Or a prophet? I&rsquo;ve seen enough of that&rdquo; Daenerys made too much of an effort to be dismissive of the idea, but Arya could hear that she was hooked. </p><p>&ldquo;I thought only priests of Rh&rsquo;llor supposedly can see the future in their flames.&rdquo; Tyrion mused. </p><p>&ldquo;Bran was blessed by the old Gods. He doesn&rsquo;t study flames. He says, he sees threads of the possible future and he can work for the best result. Without him we would not have been able to defeat the White Walkers.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>Arya noted that Sansa had left out some of the things Bran could do. </p><p>&ldquo;So, he sees what might happen? Why would he show me the future?&rdquo; Daenerys wanted to know. </p><p>Sansa bowed her head, just a tiny bit and lowered her eyes. Her lashes threw a shadow on her cheeks. </p><p>&ldquo;You are the last true Targaryen. He has seen you often. He says you have a destiny.&rdquo; </p><p>Arya could see that Daenerys held back not to show her interest too openly. </p><p>&ldquo;So, we fight together against the White Walkers and agree to sort the succession out afterwards&hellip;. Acmicably, of course. And as a token of good will you offer your brother and a view into the future.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;And I offer clothing for your army, as far as we can help. There is also food for your dragon, as long as he stays out of Winterfell.&rdquo; </p><p>Daenerys looked at the young girl, who was not clothed fo the cold. </p><p>&ldquo;I think we have grounds for an understanding&rdquo; Daenerys finally said. </p><p>Arya wished she knew why she looked satisfied like a cat with a cream pot. What in seven hells is Bran&rsquo;s plan? She wants clothing and food, but she wants more to see into the future, why? </p><p>&ldquo;We should take bread and salt to confirm this.&rdquo; Sansa said. On this cue, Jaime brought a basket with bread. &nbsp;</p><p>It was only a small bread, and they finished it fast, but the formality was done. If she doesn&rsquo;t want to keep her word, bread is not going to change that. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come to Winterfell tomorrow. I expect a welcome fit for a queen.&rdquo; Daenerys said. </p><p>Daenerys stood up, so that she could look down on Sansa. </p><p>&ldquo;He married you for your claim, didn&rsquo;t he? For your claim and the support from the North, to save his power. Did he even consummate the marriage?&rdquo; </p><p>Blood rushed to Sansa&rsquo;s face. Arya flexed her fingers. She ached for that knife. She was quite sure, that that had been aimed to unsettle Sansa. </p><p>For the third time, Sansa pressed her thigh under the table and Arya schooled her face. </p><p>Sansa stood as well, she did not answer the question, her gaze was lowered. Daenerys smiled. It was not a nice smile. </p><p>&ldquo;I see, you do not deign to answer. I guess you can wait some time until he touches you. Several men have told me, that they would not want to taste any other woman after they knew the mother of dragons.&rdquo; </p><p>Sansa&rsquo;s face went even darker, but she remained silent. Does she insinuate that Jon slept with her? Arya felt for her sister. Surely that was a mean remark. If Daenerys had wanted to throw Sansa of balance, she had succeeded, but Sansa pressed her lips together and remained silent. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Winterfell will be prepared for you,&rdquo; Sansa said. Arya could barely hear a strain in her voice and Arya was very proud of her sister. </p><p>When they sat on their horses agan and were out of earshot, Arya felt it was safe to remark on the negotiation, but she decided to be quiet about Daenerys attempt to bait Sansa. </p><p>&ldquo;That went better than I expected. I hope she keeps her promises.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I doubt it. She didn&rsquo;t keep her promise to Jon, although I doubt she see it that way.&rdquo; Sansa frowned. &ldquo;I really wish Bran wouldn&rsquo;t be so secretive and he would tell me why he thinks this is necessary. I am uneasy.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Your grace, what did she mean by that last remark?&rdquo; Ser Jaime asked. He looked at Sansa from the side his face looking troubled and concerned. </p><p>Sansa laughed, a clear sound that Arya did not expect. </p><p>&ldquo;There is no need to fret, Ser Jaime,&rdquo; Sansa said. &ldquo;Daenerys thought that she could deal me a bad hand. But she told me nothing I did not know.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Are you telling me, Jon slept with Daenerys and you knew that?&rdquo; Ser Jaime asked. &nbsp;</p><p>Arya was shocked. </p><p>&ldquo;That was before Sam had told him about his parents, and he had contemplated a marriage alliance to commit Daenerys to our cause.&rdquo; </p><p>Arya tried to understand. &ldquo;You seem more sanguine about this than mere moments ago.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I think your sister could put a mummer to shame with her acting. I was tempted to challenge Daenerys to a duel&rdquo; Jaime remarked. </p><p>&ldquo;There is absolutely no need for that. She wanted to insult me and did not realise that her insult did not hit. If I have to act flustered so that she won&rsquo;t rain dragonfire on Winterfell, I will act flustered,&rdquo; Sansa told him. </p><p>&ldquo;Might I suggest something, your Grace?&rdquo; Jaime asked. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I think it would be wise, if you do nothing to enlighten Daenerys about the truth. I suggest you give her a chamber far away from your own.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>Jaime Lannister grinned and had the audacity to even wink at Sansa. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You would not want Daenerys to hear&hellip;. &ldquo; he interrupted himself. &ldquo; You would not want Danerys&rsquo;s sleep to be interrupted by strange noises.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>This time when Sansa blushed it was not an act, Arya was sure. What in seven hells is it with all this blushing! </p>",
