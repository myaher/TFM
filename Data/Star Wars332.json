Rather, he headed carefully towards the grille to the air vent, glancing both ways down the corridor as he did so. His hand slipped into his belt and brought out a small multitool.</p><p>Oh.</p><p><i>Blast it.</i></p><p>Ahsoka scurried backwards on her hands and knees, cool metal under her fingertips. The <i>squeak-squeak-squeak </i>of Anakin calmly unscrewing the grille she had been facing mere moments before accompanied the racing of her heart in her ears.\u00a0Ahsoka nearly bumped a fatal elbow into the walls more than once, but a tense half-minute later she had backed around a corner, just as the metallic\u00a0<i>tink</i> of the last screw coming loose echoed down the vent.</p><p>Hardly daring to breathe, Ahsoka pressed herself flat to the durasteel surface, pulling her Force-presence so close around her she felt like a neutron star, compressed in upon herself.</p><p>It occurred to her then that she hadn\u2019t the faintest idea of Anakin\u2019s route through the vent systems; he could be heading towards her, for all she knew.</p><p>There was a small <i>click - </i>Anakin must have replaced the grille - and then faint shuffling, that grew even softer after a moment.</p><p>Anakin was crawling away from her direction.</p><p>Closing her eyes in exhausted relief, Ahsoka let herself rest for a few moments - at least until she could be sure of moving without alerting Anakin to her presence.</p><p>And then, gulping in a careful breath, she crawled after him.</p><hr><p>As it turned out, she had forgotten one crucial thing about her lineage; the sheer amount of craziness.</p><p>The shaft-system opened to the ventral hull.</p><p>Ahsoka rounded the last corner and gasped as the sudden wind caught her hood and threw it back. A square of bright sunlight yawned open a half-metre from her fingers; below the gap, a sickening kilometre-long drop down to the floor of this mid-rim system\u2019s major\u00a0naval dockyard.</p><p>Anakin was nowhere to be seen. Which only meant-</p><p>Far, far below, a dark-cloaked figure slowly straightened from a crouch, dusted itself off, and then headed at a jaunty pace for the nearest exit.</p><p>Ahsoka curled her fingers over the edge of the vent exit, and swallowed.</p><p>It was-</p><p>-not impossible. Not impossible by far. She had <i>seen</i> Master Kenobi fall further and faster and still land cat-footed, lightsaber in hand, ready to fight. And as all evidence suggested, so could Anakin.</p><p>She just had to-</p><p>-focus. <i>Focus.</i></p><p>Ahsoka closed her eyes. Breathed in the Force.</p><p>It guided her hands to the opposite edge of the vent exit, curled her form through the gap until she hung by her fingertips, petite form swaying in the wind.</p><p>Then she made the mistake of opening her eyes.</p><p>The gaping maw of one of the Resolute\u2019s\u00a0ventral turbolaser arrays stared her in the face, as wide in diameter as a mid-sized transport, and she nearly lost her grip on the vent edge right there and then.</p><p>She stared right back, breath coming quickly and rapidly. It was all right, she knew - the turbolasers were powered down at dock, and she was not about to be vaporised by a plasma blast dozens of times her height.</p><p>Her fingers were starting to tremble. She couldn\u2019t hang there forever.</p><p>So Ahsoka closed her eyes again, and listened.</p><p><i>Now,</i> the Force told her.</p><p>She let go.</p><p>Her first instinct upon feeling gravity take hold of her stomach was to scream.</p><p>But then the Force whispered in her ear, and suddenly, although her eyes were closed and there was nothing around her except the roar of the wind, she knew what to do.</p><p>She curled into its currents, let the Force buoy up under her, and landed in a silent, sure-footed circle of dust.</p><p>It was another moment before she cracked her eyes open, squinted up at the star destroyer far above, and then back down at her own dusty hands.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d she murmured.\u00a0\u201cI did that.\u201d<br/></p><p>The Force was roaring in her ears and dancing in her veins.</p><p>She spun on a heel and raced after Anakin.</p><hr><!-- more --><p>Ahsoka found him in possibly the most unexpected of places one would find a Jedi Knight.</p><p>An illegal hover-racing circuit.</p><p>A half-dozen maglev pods shot past just as Ahsoka stepped into the stands, spewing hot ozone and oxidised tibanna smoke into the yelling crowds. there was nothing separating the shallow, dish-shaped racing course and the crowds themselves except for a makeshift barricade of metal wire. It all seemed horribly dangerous - given the speed with which the racers were hurling their hover-pods around the circuit, any mistake would lead to the pod skittering right off the maglev circuit entirely and careening into the audience, right through the flimsy fence.</p><p><i>\u201cAND THE KRAYT DRAGON TAKES THE LEAD ONCE AGAIN!\u201d</i> an amplified voice boomed out of an overhead speaker, so loud that each word slammed into Ahsoka\u2019s montrals like individual spikes.</p><p>She winced, took a few steps forward to put some distance between her and the speaker, and glimpsed the leading pod across the half-kilometre diameter of the racing circuit. Its pilot was a daredevil to be sure; the pod wound its path up and down the sides of the circuit walls, cutting off all pursuit routes like a bizzare, quick-minded sphere.</p><p>And then the massive overhead holo-screens projected a close-up of the pilot just as the pod executed a daring manoeuvre which nearly sent it off-circuit completely, and Ahsoka\u2019s jaw dropped.</p><p>Anakin. <i>Anakin </i>was piloting the leading pod.</p><p><i>\u201cAAAAND WE HAVE A WINNERRRR!\u201d</i><br/></p><p>The winning pod - Anakin\u2019s pod - opened at the top, and Anakin slid halfway out, white teeth glinting in the spotlights, gold-brown hair whipping about his face as he waved enthusiastically, even as his pod continued to slide at unimaginable speeds around the circuit.\u00a0He must have been steering with this feet. The crowd, if possible, went even wilder than before.</p><p>Anakin shot past, and Ahsoka, in all her shock, forgot to shield.</p><p>His head snapped towards her like a Krayt Dragon scenting unease on the wind.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Ahsoka winced, lowered her hood, and raised a hand in a hesitant wave.</p><p>A little while later - after the pods finally slowed in a screech of sparks that cascaded up over the lips of the circuit to burn the hands of any unexpecting viewer - Anakin found her in the crowd.</p><p>\u201cHey, Snips,\u201d he said. His expression was unreadable.</p><p>\u201cHey, Skyguy,\u201d Ahsoka replied, crossing her arms and raising an eyebrow, and Anakin\u2019s expression melted into one of sheepish resignation.<br/></p><p>\u201cSo you followed me, huh,\u201d he said.<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cOh. Uh-\u201d Anakin paused.\u00a0\u201cRight, I\u2019m supposed to tell you not to do that.\u201d<br/></p><p>Ahsoka blinked.\u00a0\u201cO\u2026kay?\u201d and then:\u00a0\u201cIs there going to be\u2026um\u2026a problem with this?\u201d</p><p>Anakin stared at her. Their master-padawan bond was at that slightly awkward stage where it had settled into a comfortable dynamic, but there were still moments where they encountered something new; disciplinary actions, for example.</p><p>\u201cUh.\u201d Anakin looked almost bewildered for a second. Ahsoka supposed he was highly unused to being in a position where <i>he</i> was the one to dole out discipline, and not the recipient.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t discipline you for this if you agree not to tell Obi-Wan,\u201d Anakin said, suddenly.\u00a0\u201cOr Rex. Or - anyone, really.\u201d<br/></p><p>Ahsoka found herself grinning.\u00a0\u201cSure.\u201d A thought occurred to her then, and her smile turned wicked.\u00a0\u201cTeach me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, hover racing?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Anakin stared at her for a moment, and then ever-so-slowly, his lips curved into a grin.\u00a0\u201cIt would be my pleasure, padawan.\u201d</p><p>Ahsoka rolled her eyes.\u00a0\u201cRight, Master. Showoff.\u201d</p><p>Anakin glared in fake indignation as he began leading the way. \u201cI do <i>not</i>-\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI<i> saw </i>you waving, Skyguy!\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cStop being so <i>snippy</i>, Snips!\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat were you doing, piloting with your feet?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYes, and I\u2019ll have you know that was\u00a0<i>extremely</i> challenging and required a very skilled hand-\u201d<br/></p><p>That afternoon passed in a technicolour blur of maglev racers and oil fumes and smoking tibanna, and sparks and laughs and eager hands on rattling control panel, and the Force stamping a lively tune to the joy-filled shouts of the crowd.</p><p>They returned oil-spattered and spark-singed in time for dinner in the mess hall, grinning from ear-to-ear.</p><p>Ahsoka kept her promise and stayed silent when Obi-Wan gave them both a once-over and raised an eyebrow; she went and cleaned up and dreamt of the gut-churning adrenaline of winning hover-pod races, instead.</p><p>It was not the first of Anakin Skywalker\u2019s secrets she kept; she did not speak when she put two and two together and came up with Padme Amidala Skywalker, nor did she speak of Mortis to the Council, when they enquired.</p><p>She did not reveal Anakin\u2019s name when she sensed him in Darth Vader, all those years after.</p><p>But always, even when the cloak on her shoulders became the white-spun cloth of the Whills and the lightsaber in her hand a circle-topped staff, she remembered always the shared laughter of youth, and the roar of the Force in her heart and in their training bond as she raced with Anakin Skywalker.</p><p><b>END</b></p><hr><p>I\u2019ve previously mentioned that method of\u00a0sneaking out of star destroyers in <i><a href=\"https://eirianerisdar.tumblr.com/post/156820935540/fic-title-idea-heart-of-kyber\">Heart of Kyber</a></i>.</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnBFoL6F6e3UZw4jPOqyxFA\">@barnaclebae</a> sorry for the lateness, but I hope this will suffice!</p><p><i><a href=\"http://eirianerisdar.tumblr.com/masterlist\">My fanfic masterlist</a></i></p><p><i><a href=\"https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3455012/Eirian-Erisdar\">FFN profile and stories</a></i></p>",

                "content_raw": "<p>Hey, sorry for the late response - I\u2019ve been busy this past week with A&amp;E attachments. This fits nicely into one of <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1o_ngF8O7CH31oX_Y97pVA\">@finish-the-clone-wars</a>\u2019s past Writing Wednesday TCW themes, <i>Breaking Tradition</i>. Since they\u2019ve put out a call there\u00a0to revisit past themes these next two weeks, I thought this would be a good opportunity to do so.</p><hr><h2><b>Not Your Average Apprenticeship</b></h2><p>Ahsoka Tano had been aware before the commencement of her apprenticeship that from a purely knowledge-based point of view, Anakin Skywalker was seen to be a bit of a rogue.</p><p>Clanmasters tended to speak of him in paradoxical terms; warning the younglings in their care not to follow in the steps of the decidedly troublemaking Jinn-Kenobi-Skywalker lineage, and then wax poetic about the sheer brilliance of Skywalker\u2019s lightsaber forms, and his razor-sharp grasp of command.</p><p>It was all a bit confusing, but then Anakin Skywalker became <i>Master</i> Skywalker, and then plain\u00a0<i>Anakin</i>, and then <i>Skyguy</i>.</p><p>And Ahsoka was Snips.</p><p>Skyguy and Snips, out to face the world, with a grumpy negotiator in tow.</p><p>Perhaps she should have had some inkling of the future irregularity of their master-apprentice bond when she and Anakin were shuffling in a box towards the enemy lines on Christophsis within an hour of their first meeting, but then she had been eager to prove herself worthy of being a padawan, and in her quiet anxiety about doing so she had not paused to consider how strange it all was. It worked well enough.</p><p>And then came the time a month into Ahsoka\u2019s apprenticeship when she decided that Anakin\u2019s regular disappearances whenever the <i>Resolute</i>\u00a0was docked had to be investigated.</p><p><i>That</i> incident firmly blew away any chance of her apprenticeship being that of normal tradition.</p><p>It began, as all these incidents often do, with a plan that almost went awry.</p><p>Ahsoka pulled her standard-issue Jedi cloak from her foot locker. It was rare she had use for it, but in this case she would have enough trouble hiding her Force-signature to care about picking another disguise.</p><p>Cloak secure, she leapt up into the air-vents opposite the entrance to Anakin\u2019s room, and waited, Force-signature furled tight around her diminutive form.</p><p>Patience was not one of her strongest qualities, Ahsoka knew; but she sprawled there with her hood over her head and the slats of the grille painting her skin in alternate stripes of light and shadow, and tried to stop her fingers from drumming restlessly against the durasteel wall. Any noise would be dead giveaway.</p><p>After an unbearable amount of time (or so it seemed, but was probably only an hour or so),\u00a0the door opened and out sauntered Anakin.</p><p>Ahsoka squinted through the grille. Anakin was dressed in his usual variant of dark tabards and robes, but there was a folded cloak under his arm and he had removed all armour; there was no Jedi starbird on his shoulder, nor gauntlets on his wrists.</p><p>Intent as she was on picking up clues from Anakin\u2019s appearance, Ahsoka almost missed the fact that Anakin did not continue down the corridor. Rather, he headed carefully towards the grille to the air vent, glancing both ways down the corridor as he did so. His hand slipped into his belt and brought out a small multitool.</p><p>Oh.</p><p><i>Blast it.</i></p><p>Ahsoka scurried backwards on her hands and knees, cool metal under her fingertips. The <i>squeak-squeak-squeak </i>of Anakin calmly unscrewing the grille she had been facing mere moments before accompanied the racing of her heart in her ears.\u00a0Ahsoka nearly bumped a fatal elbow into the walls more than once, but a tense half-minute later she had backed around a corner, just as the metallic\u00a0<i>tink</i> of the last screw coming loose echoed down the vent.</p><p>Hardly daring to breathe, Ahsoka pressed herself flat to the durasteel surface, pulling her Force-presence so close around her she felt like a neutron star, compressed in upon herself.</p><p>It occurred to her then that she hadn\u2019t the faintest idea of Anakin\u2019s route through the vent systems; he could be heading towards her, for all she knew.</p><p>There was a small <i>click - </i>Anakin must have replaced the grille - and then faint shuffling, that grew even softer after a moment.</p><p>Anakin was crawling away from her direction.</p><p>Closing her eyes in exhausted relief, Ahsoka let herself rest for a few moments - at least until she could be sure of moving without alerting Anakin to her presence.</p><p>And then, gulping in a careful breath, she crawled after him.</p><hr><p>As it turned out, she had forgotten one crucial thing about her lineage; the sheer amount of craziness.</p><p>The shaft-system opened to the ventral hull.</p><p>Ahsoka rounded the last corner and gasped as the sudden wind caught her hood and threw it back.

Rather, he headed carefully towards the grille to the air vent, glancing both ways down the corridor as he did so. His hand slipped into his belt and brought out a small multitool.</p><p>Oh.</p><p><i>Blast it.</i></p><p>Ahsoka scurried backwards on her hands and knees, cool metal under her fingertips. The <i>squeak-squeak-squeak </i>of Anakin calmly unscrewing the grille she had been facing mere moments before accompanied the racing of her heart in her ears.&nbsp;Ahsoka nearly bumped a fatal elbow into the walls more than once, but a tense half-minute later she had backed around a corner, just as the metallic&nbsp;<i>tink</i> of the last screw coming loose echoed down the vent.</p><p>Hardly daring to breathe, Ahsoka pressed herself flat to the durasteel surface, pulling her Force-presence so close around her she felt like a neutron star, compressed in upon herself.</p><p>It occurred to her then that she hadn&rsquo;t the faintest idea of Anakin&rsquo;s route through the vent systems; he could be heading towards her, for all she knew.</p><p>There was a small <i>click - </i>Anakin must have replaced the grille - and then faint shuffling, that grew even softer after a moment.</p><p>Anakin was crawling away from her direction.</p><p>Closing her eyes in exhausted relief, Ahsoka let herself rest for a few moments - at least until she could be sure of moving without alerting Anakin to her presence.</p><p>And then, gulping in a careful breath, she crawled after him.</p><hr /><p>As it turned out, she had forgotten one crucial thing about her lineage; the sheer amount of craziness.</p><p>The shaft-system opened to the ventral hull.</p><p>Ahsoka rounded the last corner and gasped as the sudden wind caught her hood and threw it back. A square of bright sunlight yawned open a half-metre from her fingers; below the gap, a sickening kilometre-long drop down to the floor of this mid-rim system&rsquo;s major&nbsp;naval dockyard.</p><p>Anakin was nowhere to be seen.

Not impossible by far. She had <i>seen</i> Master Kenobi fall further and faster and still land cat-footed, lightsaber in hand, ready to fight. And as all evidence suggested, so could Anakin.</p><p>She just had to-</p><p>-focus. <i>Focus.</i></p><p>Ahsoka closed her eyes. Breathed in the Force.</p><p>It guided her hands to the opposite edge of the vent exit, curled her form through the gap until she hung by her fingertips, petite form swaying in the wind.</p><p>Then she made the mistake of opening her eyes.</p><p>The gaping maw of one of the Resolute&rsquo;s&nbsp;ventral turbolaser arrays stared her in the face, as wide in diameter as a mid-sized transport, and she nearly lost her grip on the vent edge right there and then.</p><p>She stared right back, breath coming quickly and rapidly. It was all right, she knew - the turbolasers were powered down at dock, and she was not about to be vaporised by a plasma blast dozens of times her height.</p><p>Her fingers were starting to tremble. She couldn&rsquo;t hang there forever.</p><p>So Ahsoka closed her eyes again, and listened.</p><p><i>Now,</i> the Force told her.</p><p>She let go.</p><p>Her first instinct upon feeling gravity take hold of her stomach was to scream.</p><p>But then the Force whispered in her ear, and suddenly, although her eyes were closed and there was nothing around her except the roar of the wind, she knew what to do.</p><p>She curled into its currents, let the Force buoy up under her, and landed in a silent, sure-footed circle of dust.</p><p>It was another moment before she cracked her eyes open, squinted up at the star destroyer far above, and then back down at her own dusty hands.</p><p>&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; she murmured.&nbsp;&ldquo;I did that.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>The Force was roaring in her ears and dancing in her veins.</p><p>She spun on a heel and raced after Anakin.</p><hr /><p>Ahsoka found him in possibly the most unexpected of places one would find a Jedi Knight.</p><p>An illegal hover-racing circuit.</p><p>A half-dozen maglev pods shot past just as Ahsoka stepped into the stands, spewing hot ozone and oxidised tibanna smoke into the yelling crowds. there was nothing separating the shallow, dish-shaped racing course and the crowds themselves except for a makeshift barricade of metal wire. It all seemed horribly dangerous - given the speed with which the racers were hurling their hover-pods around the circuit, any mistake would lead to the pod skittering right off the maglev circuit entirely and careening into the audience, right through the flimsy fence.</p><p><i>&ldquo;AND THE KRAYT DRAGON TAKES THE LEAD ONCE AGAIN!&rdquo;</i> an amplified voice boomed out of an overhead speaker, so loud that each word slammed into Ahsoka&rsquo;s montrals like individual spikes.</p><p>She winced, took a few steps forward to put some distance between her and the speaker, and glimpsed the leading pod across the half-kilometre diameter of the racing circuit. Its pilot was a daredevil to be sure; the pod wound its path up and down the sides of the circuit walls, cutting off all pursuit routes like a bizzare, quick-minded sphere.</p><p>And then the massive overhead holo-screens projected a close-up of the pilot just as the pod executed a daring manoeuvre which nearly sent it off-circuit completely, and Ahsoka&rsquo;s jaw dropped.</p><p>Anakin. <i>Anakin </i>was piloting the leading pod.</p><p><i>&ldquo;AAAAND WE HAVE A WINNERRRR!&rdquo;</i><br /></p><p>The winning pod - Anakin&rsquo;s pod - opened at the top, and Anakin slid halfway out, white teeth glinting in the spotlights, gold-brown hair whipping about his face as he waved enthusiastically, even as his pod continued to slide at unimaginable speeds around the circuit.&nbsp;He must have been steering with this feet. The crowd, if possible, went even wilder than before.</p><p>Anakin shot past, and Ahsoka, in all her shock, forgot to shield.</p><p>His head snapped towards her like a Krayt Dragon scenting unease on the wind.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Ahsoka winced, lowered her hood, and raised a hand in a hesitant wave.</p><p>A little while later - after the pods finally slowed in a screech of sparks that cascaded up over the lips of the circuit to burn the hands of any unexpecting viewer - Anakin found her in the crowd.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Snips,&rdquo; he said. His expression was unreadable.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Skyguy,&rdquo; Ahsoka replied, crossing her arms and raising an eyebrow, and Anakin&rsquo;s expression melted into one of sheepish resignation.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;So you followed me, huh,&rdquo; he said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh. Uh-&rdquo; Anakin paused.&nbsp;&ldquo;Right, I&rsquo;m supposed to tell you not to do that.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Ahsoka blinked.&nbsp;&ldquo;O&hellip;kay?&rdquo; and then:&nbsp;&ldquo;Is there going to be&hellip;um&hellip;a problem with this?&rdquo;</p><p>Anakin stared at her. Their master-padawan bond was at that slightly awkward stage where it had settled into a comfortable dynamic, but there were still moments where they encountered something new; disciplinary actions, for example.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh.&rdquo; Anakin looked almost bewildered for a second. Ahsoka supposed he was highly unused to being in a position where <i>he</i> was the one to dole out discipline, and not the recipient.</p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t discipline you for this if you agree not to tell Obi-Wan,&rdquo; Anakin said, suddenly.&nbsp;&ldquo;Or Rex.
