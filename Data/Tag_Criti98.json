But Matt also seems to be making a point that war both hurts people you care about and offers opportunities to get what you want. If Yeza hadn\u2019t been captured, they might have gotten pulled into the war for Caleb\u2019s interest in Dunamancy, Beau\u2019s involvement with the Cobalt Soul, or their desire to protect Yasha from persecution. War challenges neutrality.</p><p>And then I started thinking about how\u00a0\u201cchallenging neutrality\u201d has actually become somewhat of a reoccurring theme throughout the campaign. I don\u2019t necessarily mean\u00a0\u201cneutral\u201d in the sense of character alignments, so much as a desire not to get involved, to look out for oneself and one\u2019s own goals, and to take a middle-of-the-road option when possible.\u00a0</p><p>Cause the group was initially pretty adamant that they don\u2019t want to work for anyone: they rejected offers from both mercenary groups and the army, for example. But while many of them were similarly reluctant to have anything to do with the Knights of Requital, the Mighty Nein became key to the revolutionaries\u2019 plan, and while they started working with the Gentleman largely because they needed protection after the Knights of Requital incident, he became an important employer. And later, even after Beau told Yussa that the Mighty Nein mostly protect each other, they decided to ally themselves with him, recognizing their need for someone powerful and knowledgeable. No adventuring group is an island, it seems. It\u2019s really hard to survive in this world without any kind of ties to powerful people.</p><p>And the most interesting thing is that you see this same theme with many of the individual members of the Mighty Nein! The most obvious are Nott and Caleb, of course, who began the campaign caring only about each other and their respective goals, but who have come to love their friends, to the point of Nott being willing to sacrifice her life for Jester and Caleb telling them some of his deepest secrets. Despite themselves, they\u2019ve come to care about others. Yasha is similar: she distances herself from the Mighty Nein after Molly\u2019s death in an attempt to shield herself from grief, but (after her god fights her) finds herself opening up to Jester and Caduceus.\u00a0</p><p>But you also have Fjord\u2019s relationship with Uk\u2019otoa (uk\u2019otoa, uk\u2019otoa). He initially approached his warlock situation with a combination of curiosity and (attempted) caution: he wanted to know what had happened to him and was willing to hear this eldritch monster out for all he had to say, but never wanted to hurt anyone and relied heavily on his friends for advice about his situation. In the spirit of neutrality, he opened 2/3rds of Uk\u2019otoa\u2019s seals: enough to gain power but keep the monster at bay. But now, with his patron threatening him, Fjord is increasingly unable to take the middle path, and is starting to look for ways to actively counter Uk\u2019otoa.</p><p>And Beau! Early Beau swore up and down that she was an asshole who didn\u2019t care about other people (even after getting herself arrested to give Toya a chance to escape after the circus incident), and her early character arc, similar to Nott and Caleb, was about realizing how much she cared about others and was willing to put her life on the line for them. But it\u2019s been even harder for Beau to admit she cares about politics beyond a vague, non-committal\u00a0\u201cfuck the man\u201d \u2014 see, once again, her insistence to Yussa that she wasn\u2019t aligned with anyone beyond her friends and lacked ideals. But now we\u2019ve seen an outraged Beau tell Dairon about the Cerberus Assembly\u2019s experiments, argue against Dairon\u2019s racism, and promise to\u00a0\u201cserve the purpose of a better world for those who cannot defend themselves.\u201d She\u2019s becoming more and more interested in actually changing the world around her and bringing down the corrupt.\u00a0</p><p>Jester and Caduceus are more complicated, because both of them have non-traditional morality systems: Jester\u2019s morality, as argued <a href=\"https://yfere.tumblr.com/post/181939247766/dont-turn-evil-to-me-jesters-morality\" target=\"_blank\">in this brilliant post</a> by <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAtj5VPGv4gVuj-hVHmSpaA\" target=\"_blank\">@yfere</a>, is based on the relationships between people as opposed to the ideas of\u00a0\u201cgood and evil,\u201d while Caduceus\u2019s morality relates more to balance and the understanding of nature. Unlike the rest of the Mighty Nein, who arguably seek neutrality to protect themselves, Jester and Caduceus\u2019s\u00a0\u201cmiddle of the road\u201d tendencies come at least partially from their faith and morality systems, and so might develop very differently. On the other hand, I think there\u2019s something to Jester\u2019s insistence in e56 that they don\u2019t work for the Empire and (arguably na\u00efve) assumption that that might in any way save them \u2014 I think she\u2019s only starting to understand politics after so long in one place.\u00a0</p><p>Anyways, it\u2019s just cool that this campaign has a bit of that theme going on!

I don\u2019t necessarily mean\u00a0\u201cneutral\u201d in the sense of character alignments, so much as a desire not to get involved, to look out for oneself and one\u2019s own goals, and to take a middle-of-the-road option when possible.\u00a0</p><p>Cause the group was initially pretty adamant that they don\u2019t want to work for anyone: they rejected offers from both mercenary groups and the army, for example. But while many of them were similarly reluctant to have anything to do with the Knights of Requital, the Mighty Nein became key to the revolutionaries\u2019 plan, and while they started working with the Gentleman largely because they needed protection after the Knights of Requital incident, he became an important employer. And later, even after Beau told Yussa that the Mighty Nein mostly protect each other, they decided to ally themselves with him, recognizing their need for someone powerful and knowledgeable. No adventuring group is an island, it seems. It\u2019s really hard to survive in this world without any kind of ties to powerful people.</p><p>And the most interesting thing is that you see this same theme with many of the individual members of the Mighty Nein! The most obvious are Nott and Caleb, of course, who began the campaign caring only about each other and their respective goals, but who have come to love their friends, to the point of Nott being willing to sacrifice her life for Jester and Caleb telling them some of his deepest secrets. Despite themselves, they\u2019ve come to care about others. Yasha is similar: she distances herself from the Mighty Nein after Molly\u2019s death in an attempt to shield herself from grief, but (after her god fights her) finds herself opening up to Jester and Caduceus.\u00a0</p><p>But you also have Fjord\u2019s relationship with Uk\u2019otoa (uk\u2019otoa, uk\u2019otoa). He initially approached his warlock situation with a combination of curiosity and (attempted) caution: he wanted to know what had happened to him and was willing to hear this eldritch monster out for all he had to say, but never wanted to hurt anyone and relied heavily on his friends for advice about his situation. In the spirit of neutrality, he opened 2/3rds of Uk\u2019otoa\u2019s seals: enough to gain power but keep the monster at bay. But now, with his patron threatening him, Fjord is increasingly unable to take the middle path, and is starting to look for ways to actively counter Uk\u2019otoa.</p><p>And Beau! Early Beau swore up and down that she was an asshole who didn\u2019t care about other people (even after getting herself arrested to give Toya a chance to escape after the circus incident), and her early character arc, similar to Nott and Caleb, was about realizing how much she cared about others and was willing to put her life on the line for them. But it\u2019s been even harder for Beau to admit she cares about politics beyond a vague, non-committal\u00a0\u201cfuck the man\u201d \u2014 see, once again, her insistence to Yussa that she wasn\u2019t aligned with anyone beyond her friends and lacked ideals. But now we\u2019ve seen an outraged Beau tell Dairon about the Cerberus Assembly\u2019s experiments, argue against Dairon\u2019s racism, and promise to\u00a0\u201cserve the purpose of a better world for those who cannot defend themselves.\u201d She\u2019s becoming more and more interested in actually changing the world around her and bringing down the corrupt.\u00a0</p><p>Jester and Caduceus are more complicated, because both of them have non-traditional morality systems: Jester\u2019s morality, as argued <a href=\"https://yfere.tumblr.com/post/181939247766/dont-turn-evil-to-me-jesters-morality\" target=\"_blank\">in this brilliant post</a> by <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAtj5VPGv4gVuj-hVHmSpaA\" target=\"_blank\">@yfere</a>, is based on the relationships between people as opposed to the ideas of\u00a0\u201cgood and evil,\u201d while Caduceus\u2019s morality relates more to balance and the understanding of nature. Unlike the rest of the Mighty Nein, who arguably seek neutrality to protect themselves, Jester and Caduceus\u2019s\u00a0\u201cmiddle of the road\u201d tendencies come at least partially from their faith and morality systems, and so might develop very differently. On the other hand, I think there\u2019s something to Jester\u2019s insistence in e56 that they don\u2019t work for the Empire and (arguably na\u00efve) assumption that that might in any way save them \u2014 I think she\u2019s only starting to understand politics after so long in one place.\u00a0</p><p>Anyways, it\u2019s just cool that this campaign has a bit of that theme going on! I guess it makes sense because the campaign so far has been so much about identity, and part of finding your identity is finding the things that you care about, that you\u2019re willing to align yourself with, that you\u2019ll work for or against. It\u2019s cool.\u00a0</p>",
                "content": "<p>So I was thinking about how it was sort of inevitable that, despite their attempts at neutrality, the Mighty Nein would eventually have to get involved in the war and make some kinds of alliances with the Empire, the Kryn, or both. People have been saying this for a long time, so it wasn&rsquo;t too surprising that it happened (although, of course, the way that it happened was surprising).&nbsp;</p><p>For one, the party is increasingly powerful and therefore noticeable to the warring states and both sides have a&nbsp;&ldquo;with us or against us&rdquo; kind of mentality, even for people (like Jester, Fjord, &amp; Caduceus) who don&rsquo;t come from either country. But Matt also seems to be making a point that war both hurts people you care about and offers opportunities to get what you want.
