Rickon hadn&rsquo;t been the only one to test her boyfriend&rsquo;s resolve; besides\ndealing with Margaery upon his arrival, he&rsquo;d had to meet both of her parents\nfor the first time just as they learned that the wedding venue wanted to charge\nanother $2,500 fee for the rush and Jeyne&rsquo;s parents were refusing to pay\nit\u2014leading to the question of whether there&rsquo;d be a wedding at all. After some\nheated telephone exchanges, Sansa was pretty sure her father had talked the\nvenue down to just charging a $1,000 late fee, but she was fairly certain that\nmoney was coming out of his own checkbook. </p><p>Arya blamed Robb for being so stupid and inconsiderate, and\nSansa tried her very best not to chime in when she started ranting about their\nolder brother and all the money he was costing their parents.

She\u2019d kept the\nsarcastic comments directed mainly to Sansa and Gendry.</p><p><br/>\n&ldquo;We&rsquo;re eloping,&rdquo; she&rsquo;d told Gendry the\nother day\u2014much to her boyfriend\u2019s surprise.<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; he&rsquo;d managed to choke out.<br/><br/>\n&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she&rsquo;d replied matter-of-factly.\n&ldquo;We can have a party afterwards.

After an hour and a half\nwhen they\u2019d come back inside, Dickon\u2019s fingers had been frozen, his lips blue.<br/><br/>\nShe sighed again. &ldquo;He has been a real\ntrooper.&rdquo; She leaned over to place her hand on Bran\u2019s shoulder. \u201cThanks\nfor inviting him to hang out with you and Gendry last night. I know he\nappreciated it.\u201d<br/><br/>\nAs Robb\u2019s stag night had been the week before\nand quite a 21-and-over event\u2014Sansa saw Theon the other day and wondered if he\nwas still hungover\u2014the night before had been a quiet one. Robb had spent the\nnight with Jeyne and her family, and Rickon luckily had been at a friend\u2019s\nhouse; Sansa suspected that had been her mother\u2019s doing, for which she was most\ngrateful.\u00a0<br/><br/>\nSansa and Arya were roped into helping their mom\nwith last-minute seating chart arrangements and making favors, and their father\nhad to work.<br/><br/>\nSo Bran has taken the initiative to order pizza\nand play video games with Dickon\u2014and invite Gendry, too, so there wouldn\u2019t be\nas much pressure to bond with the younger brother.<br/><br/>\n\u201cI like Dickon.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cYou do?\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cYeah, he knows a lot about the Westerosi\ncriminal code and how to evade certain charges on technicalities. I think those\ntalents will prove useful in the future, should Rickon reach 18.\u201d<br/><br/>\nSansa swallowed her laugh. \u201cI\u2019ll keep that in\nmind.\u201d She tapped her foot. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201c10:52.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cAnd what time were these supposed to be ready?\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cI think 10:45, but since Robb isn\u2019t here to\nsign for them&hellip;\u201d Robb was supposed to be here to meet them and help with\npicking up the tuxes, but there&rsquo;d been a minor catastrophe with the catering.\nThere\u2019d been minor catastrophes with everything, it seemed. This wedding, if it\nactually took place, would be a miracle.<br/><br/>\nSansa took a deep breath. \u201cAll right, you stay\nhere.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cTo get our tuxes.\u201d<br/><br/>\nSix minutes later, Sansa returned to the front\ncounter with a bag-laden shop worker hurrying behind her.\u00a0<br/><br/>\nShe gave Bran a smile as the man typed\neverything into the cash register.\u00a0<br/><br/>\n\u201cThere\u2019s nine bags\u201d Bran counted as the man went\nthrough them all. \u201cWe\u2019re only supposed to pick up eight tuxes.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cSomething caught my eye, and I\u2019m an excellent\nnegotiator,\u201d Sansa told her little brother with a wink.<br/><br/>\n\u201cEverything is in order, Miss Stark.\u201d<br/><br/>\n\u201cThank you so much, Illyrio. You\u2019ve been such a\nhelp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me help you to your car.\u201d</p><p>When everything was packed, Sansa shook the man\u2019s hand in\ngratitude and thanked him once more. </p><p>\u201cYou will look radiant, Miss Stark. I just know it.\u201d</p><p>Sansa grinned and waved goodbye. When she got behind the\ndriver\u2019s seat, Bran looked at her in confusion. \u201cI thought you told Mom you\nalready had a dress for the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Sansa replied. \u201cBut a very wise woman told me just\nthe other day that there\u2019s always time for a new dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if it doesn\u2019t fit? Did you even try it on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll fit,\u201d Sansa told him. \u201cDon\u2019t you fret, Bran. I have an\neye for these things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you get him to give it to you for free?\u201d</p><p>Sansa grinned. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing a little bit of persuasion\nand good manners can\u2019t accomplish.\u201d</p><p>Bran applauded softly. \u201cIf only Robb had you around to deal\nwith the caterers this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well, we all know that Robb can manage just fine on his\nown.\u201d Upon his silence, she turned to her younger brother and winked. </p><p>Tuxes in tow, they went to the florist next and then dropped\noff a check at the limousine shop. As they were leaving, Sansa\u2019s stomach\ngrumbled. \u201cDid you have a chance to look at the menu of the place we\u2019re going\ntonight\u2014it\u2019s a Dornish restaurant, right?\u201d</p><p>Bran sighed. \u201cOver-priced and needlessly pretentious. You can\u2019t\npick your side dish; they get automatically assigned. And of course all the\ngood meat options are paired with the worst vegetables.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes the vegetarian option at least look good? Sometimes\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not only vegetarian but also vegan and gluten-free. A\nmeal for all the difficult people.\u201d</p><p>Sansa frowned. \u201cWhy in the name of all the gods would we go\nthere then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom said it was close to the venue.\u201d</p><p>Sansa bit her tongue to avoid saying what she was thinking.\nHer stomach grumbled again. \u201cWe should eat now. At least we\u2019ll be able to get\none good meal in today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Ice Shack isn\u2019t too far from here,\u201d said Bran, grinning.\n\u201cWe could get milkshakes\u2014strawberry.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, she was 15, sitting in the Ice Shack parking\nlot, sipping on a strawberry milkshake and munching on fries in the front seat\nof Jon Snow\u2019s car.</p><p>But when she blinked, she was 21 again and in the driver\u2019s\nseat. \u201cAll that dairy won\u2019t be good right before we have to take so many\npictures. Why don\u2019t we stop and get some sandwiches to bring home? I\u2019m sure\neveryone is hungry there.\u201d</p><p>Bran accepted her excuse, and she drove toward the nearest\nsandwich shop.</p><p>\u201cThank you, little one,\u201d her father said when they returned with\nchores completed and lunch for everyone. \u201cWe would not survive this weekend\nwithout you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d Sansa said, though she was not so sure. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not find out,\u201d Ned muttered. \u201cGo on and get ready. The\nboys and I can take it from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. All\u2019s that left is getting things in the car and\ngetting everybody dressed up before we go set up at the church. Maybe see if\nyou can convince Arya\u2014\u201d</p><p>Sansa laughed. \u201cI\u2019ve never been able to convince Arya to do a\nsingle thing in my entire life. Do you really think this is the weekend when\nthat\u2019s going to change?\u201d</p><p>With his laughter ringing in the hall, she made her way\nupstairs and to the bathroom. There wasn\u2019t much time, but she desperately\nwanted a bath. It was going to be a long weekend; she needed to take the\nopportunities for quiet solitude when she could. </p><p>The bath worked, somewhat, to calm her down, but with each\nhour the rehearsal loomed closer, she could feel her pulse quicken. </p><p>Once dry and hair blown out, Sansa sat in front of her vanity\nmirror and applied her makeup as carefully as she could. Sansa was usually\npretty good at doing makeup, but she wanted to make sure that it looked\nabsolutely perfect. Before applying her lipstick, a rose pink shade, she\nslipped into her outfit for the evening: a dark teal silk dress with long\nsleeves and buttons down the front. </p><p>She hummed under her breath as she methodically braided her\nlong hair into a fish tail and then studied herself in the mirror.</p><p>\u201cYou are Sansa Stark of Winterfell. You are Ned and Cat\u2019s\ndaughter. You can do this,\u201d she whispered under her breath. Do what exactly, she\nwasn\u2019t sure. But saying it aloud made her feel like it was true. </p><p>As she was slipping into her heels, a knock sounded on her\ndoor. \u201cIt\u2019s open!\u201d she said as she tried to find where she\u2019d put her purse.</p><p>\u201cWow, Sansa, you look really pretty.\u201d</p><p>Sansa stopped searching for her purse and turned to smile at\nher little brother Rickon; his hair was wild, but he still looked so sweet in his\ngrey suit with the tie still undone.</p><p>\u201cThank you. C\u2019mere, I\u2019ll do up your tie for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried, but Bran\u2019s directions didn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay. I\u2019m very good at ties. Mom taught me how to do\nRobb\u2019s ties for him when we were your age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Rickon ask as he watched Sansa\u2019s fingers work the\nfabric. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t she teach him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Robb couldn\u2019t very well be trusted to do it himself,\ncould he?\u201d In truth, Cat had tried over and over again, but Robb had always\nbeen a bit hopeless at it. Sansa, whose fingers were nimble even then from\nknitting, was a much better student for it.</p><p>The joke made Rickon laugh, but his smiled turned to a frown.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe Robb\u2019s getting married.\u201d</p><p><i>Neither\ncan I</i>, Sansa thought. \u201cThere,\u201d she said instead as she patted the\ntie against his chest. She brought him over to her mirror to take a look. \u201cNow\ndon\u2019t you look handsome?\u201d</p><p>The compliment made him glow, but he tore his eyes away from his\nreflection to look at her instead. \u201cWill you dance with me at the wedding\ntomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I will. What a lucky girl I am; my dance card\nseems quite full. It is going to be one eventful wedding for sure.\u201d</p><p>Rickon\ninsisted on assisting Sansa down the stairs, even though she tried to assure\nhim that she didn\u2019t need any help walking in heels, even if they were stilettos.</p><p>\u201cThose\nare death traps, Sansa. No one should walk in those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d\nArya said as she squeezed past them. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not like you need to be any\ntaller anyway.\u201d</p><p>Arya\nhad kept her hair down, but the green dress she wore was quite pretty, even\nwhen offset by the combat boots Sansa had bought for her. </p><p>\u201cTall\ngirls can still wear heels,\u201d Sansa insisted. </p><p>\u201cThey\njust need the right date.\u201d Dickon had appeared at the bottom of the stairs. He\nlooked so good in his navy suit that Sansa let out a sigh. </p><p>\u201cYou\nlook beautiful,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cI\nalready told her that,\u201d Rickon told Dickon. </p><p>Dickon\nshrugged. \u201cBetter late than never, I guess. You ready?\u201d he asked as he handed Sansa\nher coat. \u201cI think your parents want us to meet them in the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d\nshe lied. \u201cLet me just grab some tissues for my purse. You go on ahead.\u201d</p><p>Arya\nfound Sansa, staring at the tissue box in the downstairs bathroom, and reached\nout to squeeze her hand. The look in her eyes told Sansa she knew exactly what\nwas making her older sister so nervous. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\njust a few words and then dinner,\u201d Arya whispered to her. \u201cYou\u2019ll get through\nit. Even with him there.\u201d</p><p>Sansa\nnodded and squeezed Arya\u2019s hand back. </p><p>Arya\nseemed unable to allow the tenderness of the moment to last any longer. \u201cC\u2019mon,\nlet\u2019s go get this over with. We\u2019re not only gaining a sister, we are hopefully\nlosing a brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArya!\u201d\nSansa hissed, despite letting out a short shout of laughter.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\ntell Mom I said that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nhave no manners whatsoever, Arya Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\nsomeone has to keep us entertained.\u201d</p><p>Sansa\nsighed and held her chin high as she made her way to the car. <i>You can do this.</i><br/><br/><br/></p>",

When she got behind the\ndriver\u2019s seat, Bran looked at her in confusion. \u201cI thought you told Mom you\nalready had a dress for the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Sansa replied. \u201cBut a very wise woman told me just\nthe other day that there\u2019s always time for a new dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if it doesn\u2019t fit? Did you even try it on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll fit,\u201d Sansa told him. \u201cDon\u2019t you fret, Bran. I have an\neye for these things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you get him to give it to you for free?\u201d</p><p>Sansa grinned. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing a little bit of persuasion\nand good manners can\u2019t accomplish.\u201d</p><p>Bran applauded softly. \u201cIf only Robb had you around to deal\nwith the caterers this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well, we all know that Robb can manage just fine on his\nown.\u201d Upon his silence, she turned to her younger brother and winked. </p><p>Tuxes in tow, they went to the florist next and then dropped\noff a check at the limousine shop. As they were leaving, Sansa\u2019s stomach\ngrumbled. \u201cDid you have a chance to look at the menu of the place we\u2019re going\ntonight\u2014it\u2019s a Dornish restaurant, right?\u201d</p><p>Bran sighed. \u201cOver-priced and needlessly pretentious. You can\u2019t\npick your side dish; they get automatically assigned. And of course all the\ngood meat options are paired with the worst vegetables.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes the vegetarian option at least look good? Sometimes\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not only vegetarian but also vegan and gluten-free. A\nmeal for all the difficult people.\u201d</p><p>Sansa frowned. \u201cWhy in the name of all the gods would we go\nthere then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom said it was close to the venue.\u201d</p><p>Sansa bit her tongue to avoid saying what she was thinking.\nHer stomach grumbled again. \u201cWe should eat now. At least we\u2019ll be able to get\none good meal in today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Ice Shack isn\u2019t too far from here,\u201d said Bran, grinning.\n\u201cWe could get milkshakes\u2014strawberry.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, she was 15, sitting in the Ice Shack parking\nlot, sipping on a strawberry milkshake and munching on fries in the front seat\nof Jon Snow\u2019s car.</p><p>But when she blinked, she was 21 again and in the driver\u2019s\nseat. \u201cAll that dairy won\u2019t be good right before we have to take so many\npictures. Why don\u2019t we stop and get some sandwiches to bring home? I\u2019m sure\neveryone is hungry there.\u201d</p><p>Bran accepted her excuse, and she drove toward the nearest\nsandwich shop.</p><p>\u201cThank you, little one,\u201d her father said when they returned with\nchores completed and lunch for everyone. \u201cWe would not survive this weekend\nwithout you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d Sansa said, though she was not so sure. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not find out,\u201d Ned muttered. \u201cGo on and get ready. The\nboys and I can take it from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. All\u2019s that left is getting things in the car and\ngetting everybody dressed up before we go set up at the church. Maybe see if\nyou can convince Arya\u2014\u201d</p><p>Sansa laughed. \u201cI\u2019ve never been able to convince Arya to do a\nsingle thing in my entire life. Do you really think this is the weekend when\nthat\u2019s going to change?\u201d</p><p>With his laughter ringing in the hall, she made her way\nupstairs and to the bathroom. There wasn\u2019t much time, but she desperately\nwanted a bath. It was going to be a long weekend; she needed to take the\nopportunities for quiet solitude when she could. </p><p>The bath worked, somewhat, to calm her down, but with each\nhour the rehearsal loomed closer, she could feel her pulse quicken. </p><p>Once dry and hair blown out, Sansa sat in front of her vanity\nmirror and applied her makeup as carefully as she could. Sansa was usually\npretty good at doing makeup, but she wanted to make sure that it looked\nabsolutely perfect. Before applying her lipstick, a rose pink shade, she\nslipped into her outfit for the evening: a dark teal silk dress with long\nsleeves and buttons down the front. </p><p>She hummed under her breath as she methodically braided her\nlong hair into a fish tail and then studied herself in the mirror.</p><p>\u201cYou are Sansa Stark of Winterfell. You are Ned and Cat\u2019s\ndaughter. You can do this,\u201d she whispered under her breath. Do what exactly, she\nwasn\u2019t sure. But saying it aloud made her feel like it was true. </p><p>As she was slipping into her heels, a knock sounded on her\ndoor. \u201cIt\u2019s open!\u201d she said as she tried to find where she\u2019d put her purse.</p><p>\u201cWow, Sansa, you look really pretty.\u201d</p><p>Sansa stopped searching for her purse and turned to smile at\nher little brother Rickon; his hair was wild, but he still looked so sweet in his\ngrey suit with the tie still undone.</p><p>\u201cThank you. C\u2019mere, I\u2019ll do up your tie for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried, but Bran\u2019s directions didn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay. I\u2019m very good at ties. Mom taught me how to do\nRobb\u2019s ties for him when we were your age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Rickon ask as he watched Sansa\u2019s fingers work the\nfabric. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t she teach him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Robb couldn\u2019t very well be trusted to do it himself,\ncould he?\u201d In truth, Cat had tried over and over again, but Robb had always\nbeen a bit hopeless at it. Sansa, whose fingers were nimble even then from\nknitting, was a much better student for it.</p><p>The joke made Rickon laugh, but his smiled turned to a frown.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe Robb\u2019s getting married.\u201d</p><p><i>Neither\ncan I</i>, Sansa thought. \u201cThere,\u201d she said instead as she patted the\ntie against his chest. She brought him over to her mirror to take a look. \u201cNow\ndon\u2019t you look handsome?\u201d</p><p>The compliment made him glow, but he tore his eyes away from his\nreflection to look at her instead. \u201cWill you dance with me at the wedding\ntomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I will. What a lucky girl I am; my dance card\nseems quite full. It is going to be one eventful wedding for sure.\u201d</p><p>Rickon\ninsisted on assisting Sansa down the stairs, even though she tried to assure\nhim that she didn\u2019t need any help walking in heels, even if they were stilettos.</p><p>\u201cThose\nare death traps, Sansa. No one should walk in those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d\nArya said as she squeezed past them. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not like you need to be any\ntaller anyway.\u201d</p><p>Arya\nhad kept her hair down, but the green dress she wore was quite pretty, even\nwhen offset by the combat boots Sansa had bought for her. </p><p>\u201cTall\ngirls can still wear heels,\u201d Sansa insisted. </p><p>\u201cThey\njust need the right date.\u201d Dickon had appeared at the bottom of the stairs. He\nlooked so good in his navy suit that Sansa let out a sigh. </p><p>\u201cYou\nlook beautiful,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cI\nalready told her that,\u201d Rickon told Dickon. </p><p>Dickon\nshrugged. \u201cBetter late than never, I guess. You ready?\u201d he asked as he handed Sansa\nher coat. \u201cI think your parents want us to meet them in the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d\nshe lied. \u201cLet me just grab some tissues for my purse. You go on ahead.\u201d</p><p>Arya\nfound Sansa, staring at the tissue box in the downstairs bathroom, and reached\nout to squeeze her hand. The look in her eyes told Sansa she knew exactly what\nwas making her older sister so nervous. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\njust a few words and then dinner,\u201d Arya whispered to her. \u201cYou\u2019ll get through\nit. Even with him there.\u201d</p><p>Sansa\nnodded and squeezed Arya\u2019s hand back. </p><p>Arya\nseemed unable to allow the tenderness of the moment to last any longer. \u201cC\u2019mon,\nlet\u2019s go get this over with. We\u2019re not only gaining a sister, we are hopefully\nlosing a brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArya!\u201d\nSansa hissed, despite letting out a short shout of laughter.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\ntell Mom I said that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nhave no manners whatsoever, Arya Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\nsomeone has to keep us entertained.\u201d</p><p>Sansa\nsighed and held her chin high as she made her way to the car. <i>You can do this.</i><br><br><br></p>",

Rickon hadn\u2019t been the only one to test her boyfriend\u2019s resolve; besides\ndealing with Margaery upon his arrival, he\u2019d had to meet both of her parents\nfor the first time just as they learned that the wedding venue wanted to charge\nanother $2,500 fee for the rush and Jeyne\u2019s parents were refusing to pay\nit\u2014leading to the question of whether there\u2019d be a wedding at all. After some\nheated telephone exchanges, Sansa was pretty sure her father had talked the\nvenue down to just charging a $1,000 late fee, but she was fairly certain that\nmoney was coming out of his own checkbook. </p><p>Arya blamed Robb for being so stupid and inconsiderate, and\nSansa tried her very best not to chime in when she started ranting about their\nolder brother and all the money he was costing their parents. But at least Arya\nwas trying not to complain too much in front of company. She\u2019d kept the\nsarcastic comments directed mainly to Sansa and Gendry.</p><p><br>\n\u201cWe\u2019re eloping,\u201d she\u2019d told Gendry the\nother day\u2014much to her boyfriend\u2019s surprise.<br><br>\n\u201cReally?\u201d he\u2019d managed to choke out.<br><br>\n\u201cYes,\u201d she\u2019d replied matter-of-factly.\n\u201cWe can have a party afterwards. Hotpie can make a cake because the best\npart is the cake. But I\u2019m not putting myself through all this garbage. This\nwedding crap is giving me hives. I won\u2019t go through this bullshit again. And\nI\u2019ll be wearing pants.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cWhatever you want,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got what I want.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cCake?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cNah, I\u2019ve got you thinking about marrying\nme,\u201d he preened.<br><br>\nThe whole exchange had actually been quite adorable\u2014to\nthe point Sansa had wished she had a camera\u2014until Arya sucker punched him.<br><br>\nPoor Dickon had missed the whole thing, though,\nbecause he\u2019d very nobly agreed to help her father shovel the driveway\u2014despite\nnot having much personal experience with deep snow. After an hour and a half\nwhen they\u2019d come back inside, Dickon\u2019s fingers had been frozen, his lips blue.<br><br>\nShe sighed again. \u201cHe has been a real\ntrooper.\u201d She leaned over to place her hand on Bran\u2019s shoulder. \u201cThanks\nfor inviting him to hang out with you and Gendry last night. I know he\nappreciated it.\u201d<br><br>\nAs Robb\u2019s stag night had been the week before\nand quite a 21-and-over event\u2014Sansa saw Theon the other day and wondered if he\nwas still hungover\u2014the night before had been a quiet one. Robb had spent the\nnight with Jeyne and her family, and Rickon luckily had been at a friend\u2019s\nhouse; Sansa suspected that had been her mother\u2019s doing, for which she was most\ngrateful.\u00a0<br><br>\nSansa and Arya were roped into helping their mom\nwith last-minute seating chart arrangements and making favors, and their father\nhad to work.<br><br>\nSo Bran has taken the initiative to order pizza\nand play video games with Dickon\u2014and invite Gendry, too, so there wouldn\u2019t be\nas much pressure to bond with the younger brother.<br><br>\n\u201cI like Dickon.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cYou do?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cYeah, he knows a lot about the Westerosi\ncriminal code and how to evade certain charges on technicalities. I think those\ntalents will prove useful in the future, should Rickon reach 18.\u201d<br><br>\nSansa swallowed her laugh. \u201cI\u2019ll keep that in\nmind.\u201d She tapped her foot. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201c10:52.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cAnd what time were these supposed to be ready?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cI think 10:45, but since Robb isn\u2019t here to\nsign for them\u2026\u201d Robb was supposed to be here to meet them and help with\npicking up the tuxes, but there\u2019d been a minor catastrophe with the catering.\nThere\u2019d been minor catastrophes with everything, it seemed. This wedding, if it\nactually took place, would be a miracle.<br><br>\nSansa took a deep breath. \u201cAll right, you stay\nhere.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cTo get our tuxes.\u201d<br><br>\nSix minutes later, Sansa returned to the front\ncounter with a bag-laden shop worker hurrying behind her.\u00a0<br><br>\nShe gave Bran a smile as the man typed\neverything into the cash register.\u00a0<br><br>\n\u201cThere\u2019s nine bags\u201d Bran counted as the man went\nthrough them all. \u201cWe\u2019re only supposed to pick up eight tuxes.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cSomething caught my eye, and I\u2019m an excellent\nnegotiator,\u201d Sansa told her little brother with a wink.<br><br>\n\u201cEverything is in order, Miss Stark.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cThank you so much, Illyrio. You\u2019ve been such a\nhelp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me help you to your car.\u201d</p><p>When everything was packed, Sansa shook the man\u2019s hand in\ngratitude and thanked him once more. </p><p>\u201cYou will look radiant, Miss Stark. I just know it.\u201d</p><p>Sansa grinned and waved goodbye. When she got behind the\ndriver\u2019s seat, Bran looked at her in confusion. \u201cI thought you told Mom you\nalready had a dress for the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Sansa replied. \u201cBut a very wise woman told me just\nthe other day that there\u2019s always time for a new dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if it doesn\u2019t fit? Did you even try it on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll fit,\u201d Sansa told him. \u201cDon\u2019t you fret, Bran. I have an\neye for these things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you get him to give it to you for free?\u201d</p><p>Sansa grinned. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing a little bit of persuasion\nand good manners can\u2019t accomplish.\u201d</p><p>Bran applauded softly. \u201cIf only Robb had you around to deal\nwith the caterers this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well, we all know that Robb can manage just fine on his\nown.\u201d Upon his silence, she turned to her younger brother and winked. </p><p>Tuxes in tow, they went to the florist next and then dropped\noff a check at the limousine shop. As they were leaving, Sansa\u2019s stomach\ngrumbled. \u201cDid you have a chance to look at the menu of the place we\u2019re going\ntonight\u2014it\u2019s a Dornish restaurant, right?\u201d</p><p>Bran sighed. \u201cOver-priced and needlessly pretentious. You can\u2019t\npick your side dish; they get automatically assigned. And of course all the\ngood meat options are paired with the worst vegetables.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes the vegetarian option at least look good? Sometimes\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not only vegetarian but also vegan and gluten-free. A\nmeal for all the difficult people.\u201d</p><p>Sansa frowned. \u201cWhy in the name of all the gods would we go\nthere then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom said it was close to the venue.\u201d</p><p>Sansa bit her tongue to avoid saying what she was thinking.\nHer stomach grumbled again. \u201cWe should eat now.

Why don\u2019t we stop and get some sandwiches to bring home? I\u2019m sure\neveryone is hungry there.\u201d</p><p>Bran accepted her excuse, and she drove toward the nearest\nsandwich shop.</p><p>\u201cThank you, little one,\u201d her father said when they returned with\nchores completed and lunch for everyone. \u201cWe would not survive this weekend\nwithout you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d Sansa said, though she was not so sure. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not find out,\u201d Ned muttered. \u201cGo on and get ready. The\nboys and I can take it from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. All\u2019s that left is getting things in the car and\ngetting everybody dressed up before we go set up at the church. Maybe see if\nyou can convince Arya\u2014\u201d</p><p>Sansa laughed. \u201cI\u2019ve never been able to convince Arya to do a\nsingle thing in my entire life. Do you really think this is the weekend when\nthat\u2019s going to change?\u201d</p><p>With his laughter ringing in the hall, she made her way\nupstairs and to the bathroom. There wasn\u2019t much time, but she desperately\nwanted a bath. It was going to be a long weekend; she needed to take the\nopportunities for quiet solitude when she could. </p><p>The bath worked, somewhat, to calm her down, but with each\nhour the rehearsal loomed closer, she could feel her pulse quicken. </p><p>Once dry and hair blown out, Sansa sat in front of her vanity\nmirror and applied her makeup as carefully as she could.

Before applying her lipstick, a rose pink shade, she\nslipped into her outfit for the evening: a dark teal silk dress with long\nsleeves and buttons down the front. </p><p>She hummed under her breath as she methodically braided her\nlong hair into a fish tail and then studied herself in the mirror.</p><p>\u201cYou are Sansa Stark of Winterfell. You are Ned and Cat\u2019s\ndaughter. You can do this,\u201d she whispered under her breath. Do what exactly, she\nwasn\u2019t sure. But saying it aloud made her feel like it was true. </p><p>As she was slipping into her heels, a knock sounded on her\ndoor. \u201cIt\u2019s open!\u201d she said as she tried to find where she\u2019d put her purse.</p><p>\u201cWow, Sansa, you look really pretty.\u201d</p><p>Sansa stopped searching for her purse and turned to smile at\nher little brother Rickon; his hair was wild, but he still looked so sweet in his\ngrey suit with the tie still undone.</p><p>\u201cThank you. C\u2019mere, I\u2019ll do up your tie for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried, but Bran\u2019s directions didn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay. I\u2019m very good at ties. Mom taught me how to do\nRobb\u2019s ties for him when we were your age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Rickon ask as he watched Sansa\u2019s fingers work the\nfabric. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t she teach him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Robb couldn\u2019t very well be trusted to do it himself,\ncould he?\u201d In truth, Cat had tried over and over again, but Robb had always\nbeen a bit hopeless at it. Sansa, whose fingers were nimble even then from\nknitting, was a much better student for it.</p><p>The joke made Rickon laugh, but his smiled turned to a frown.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe Robb\u2019s getting married.\u201d</p><p><i>Neither\ncan I</i>, Sansa thought. \u201cThere,\u201d she said instead as she patted the\ntie against his chest. She brought him over to her mirror to take a look. \u201cNow\ndon\u2019t you look handsome?\u201d</p><p>The compliment made him glow, but he tore his eyes away from his\nreflection to look at her instead. \u201cWill you dance with me at the wedding\ntomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I will. What a lucky girl I am; my dance card\nseems quite full. It is going to be one eventful wedding for sure.\u201d</p><p>Rickon\ninsisted on assisting Sansa down the stairs, even though she tried to assure\nhim that she didn\u2019t need any help walking in heels, even if they were stilettos.</p><p>\u201cThose\nare death traps, Sansa. No one should walk in those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d\nArya said as she squeezed past them. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not like you need to be any\ntaller anyway.\u201d</p><p>Arya\nhad kept her hair down, but the green dress she wore was quite pretty, even\nwhen offset by the combat boots Sansa had bought for her. </p><p>\u201cTall\ngirls can still wear heels,\u201d Sansa insisted. </p><p>\u201cThey\njust need the right date.\u201d Dickon had appeared at the bottom of the stairs. He\nlooked so good in his navy suit that Sansa let out a sigh. </p><p>\u201cYou\nlook beautiful,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cI\nalready told her that,\u201d Rickon told Dickon. </p><p>Dickon\nshrugged. \u201cBetter late than never, I guess. You ready?\u201d he asked as he handed Sansa\nher coat. \u201cI think your parents want us to meet them in the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d\nshe lied. \u201cLet me just grab some tissues for my purse. You go on ahead.\u201d</p><p>Arya\nfound Sansa, staring at the tissue box in the downstairs bathroom, and reached\nout to squeeze her hand. The look in her eyes told Sansa she knew exactly what\nwas making her older sister so nervous. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\njust a few words and then dinner,\u201d Arya whispered to her. \u201cYou\u2019ll get through\nit. Even with him there.\u201d</p><p>Sansa\nnodded and squeezed Arya\u2019s hand back. </p><p>Arya\nseemed unable to allow the tenderness of the moment to last any longer. \u201cC\u2019mon,\nlet\u2019s go get this over with. We\u2019re not only gaining a sister, we are hopefully\nlosing a brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArya!\u201d\nSansa hissed, despite letting out a short shout of laughter.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\ntell Mom I said that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nhave no manners whatsoever, Arya Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\nsomeone has to keep us entertained.\u201d</p><p>Sansa\nsighed and held her chin high as she made her way to the car. <i>You can do this.</i><br><br><br></p>",
                "content": "<p>\n\n&ldquo;I think your boyfriend must really like you,&rdquo; Bran told her the morning before the wedding as they waited for the shop owner to bring out the tuxes they were renting. <br /><br />Sansa couldn&rsquo;t help the smile tugging at her lips. &ldquo;Yeah, what makes you say that?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not once complained about Rickon.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>\n<br />\n&ldquo;Ugh, don&rsquo;t get me started.&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;One would think that the same dick joke\ntold again and again would lead to diminishing returns, but I&rsquo;m not sure our\nlittle brother understands the basics of economics&mdash;or comedy.&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Or manners,&rdquo; Sansa lamented with a\nsigh. Rickon hadn&rsquo;t been the only one to test her boyfriend&rsquo;s resolve; besides\ndealing with Margaery upon his arrival, he&rsquo;d had to meet both of her parents\nfor the first time just as they learned that the wedding venue wanted to charge\nanother $2,500 fee for the rush and Jeyne&rsquo;s parents were refusing to pay\nit&mdash;leading to the question of whether there&rsquo;d be a wedding at all. After some\nheated telephone exchanges, Sansa was pretty sure her father had talked the\nvenue down to just charging a $1,000 late fee, but she was fairly certain that\nmoney was coming out of his own checkbook. </p><p>Arya blamed Robb for being so stupid and inconsiderate, and\nSansa tried her very best not to chime in when she started ranting about their\nolder brother and all the money he was costing their parents. But at least Arya\nwas trying not to complain too much in front of company. She&rsquo;d kept the\nsarcastic comments directed mainly to Sansa and Gendry.</p><p><br />\n&ldquo;We&rsquo;re eloping,&rdquo; she&rsquo;d told Gendry the\nother day&mdash;much to her boyfriend&rsquo;s surprise.<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; he&rsquo;d managed to choke out.<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she&rsquo;d replied matter-of-factly.\n&ldquo;We can have a party afterwards. Hotpie can make a cake because the best\npart is the cake. But I&rsquo;m not putting myself through all this garbage. This\nwedding crap is giving me hives. I won&rsquo;t go through this bullshit again. And\nI&rsquo;ll be wearing pants.&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Whatever you want,&rdquo; he said.\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got what I want.&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Cake?&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Nah, I&rsquo;ve got you thinking about marrying\nme,&rdquo; he preened.<br /><br />\nThe whole exchange had actually been quite adorable&mdash;to\nthe point Sansa had wished she had a camera&mdash;until Arya sucker punched him.<br /><br />\nPoor Dickon had missed the whole thing, though,\nbecause he&rsquo;d very nobly agreed to help her father shovel the driveway&mdash;despite\nnot having much personal experience with deep snow. After an hour and a half\nwhen they&rsquo;d come back inside, Dickon&rsquo;s fingers had been frozen, his lips blue.<br /><br />\nShe sighed again. &ldquo;He has been a real\ntrooper.&rdquo; She leaned over to place her hand on Bran&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;Thanks\nfor inviting him to hang out with you and Gendry last night. I know he\nappreciated it.&rdquo;<br /><br />\nAs Robb&rsquo;s stag night had been the week before\nand quite a 21-and-over event&mdash;Sansa saw Theon the other day and wondered if he\nwas still hungover&mdash;the night before had been a quiet one. Robb had spent the\nnight with Jeyne and her family, and Rickon luckily had been at a friend&rsquo;s\nhouse; Sansa suspected that had been her mother&rsquo;s doing, for which she was most\ngrateful.&nbsp;<br /><br />\nSansa and Arya were roped into helping their mom\nwith last-minute seating chart arrangements and making favors, and their father\nhad to work.<br /><br />\nSo Bran has taken the initiative to order pizza\nand play video games with Dickon&mdash;and invite Gendry, too, so there wouldn&rsquo;t be\nas much pressure to bond with the younger brother.<br /><br />\n&ldquo;I like Dickon.&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;You do?&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Yeah, he knows a lot about the Westerosi\ncriminal code and how to evade certain charges on technicalities. I think those\ntalents will prove useful in the future, should Rickon reach 18.&rdquo;<br /><br />\nSansa swallowed her laugh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep that in\nmind.&rdquo; She tapped her foot. &ldquo;What time is it?&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;10:52.&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;And what time were these supposed to be ready?&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;I think 10:45, but since Robb isn&rsquo;t here to\nsign for them&hellip;&rdquo; Robb was supposed to be here to meet them and help with\npicking up the tuxes, but there&rsquo;d been a minor catastrophe with the catering.\nThere&rsquo;d been minor catastrophes with everything, it seemed. This wedding, if it\nactually took place, would be a miracle.<br /><br />\nSansa took a deep breath. &ldquo;All right, you stay\nhere.&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;To get our tuxes.&rdquo;<br /><br />\nSix minutes later, Sansa returned to the front\ncounter with a bag-laden shop worker hurrying behind her.&nbsp;<br /><br />\nShe gave Bran a smile as the man typed\neverything into the cash register.&nbsp;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nine bags&rdquo; Bran counted as the man went\nthrough them all. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re only supposed to pick up eight tuxes.&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Something caught my eye, and I&rsquo;m an excellent\nnegotiator,&rdquo; Sansa told her little brother with a wink.<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Everything is in order, Miss Stark.&rdquo;<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Thank you so much, Illyrio. You&rsquo;ve been such a\nhelp.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let me help you to your car.&rdquo;</p><p>When everything was packed, Sansa shook the man&rsquo;s hand in\ngratitude and thanked him once more. </p><p>&ldquo;You will look radiant, Miss Stark. I just know it.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa grinned and waved goodbye. When she got behind the\ndriver&rsquo;s seat, Bran looked at her in confusion. &ldquo;I thought you told Mom you\nalready had a dress for the wedding.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; Sansa replied. &ldquo;But a very wise woman told me just\nthe other day that there&rsquo;s always time for a new dress.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What if it doesn&rsquo;t fit? Did you even try it on?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll fit,&rdquo; Sansa told him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you fret, Bran. I have an\neye for these things.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How did you get him to give it to you for free?&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa grinned. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing a little bit of persuasion\nand good manners can&rsquo;t accomplish.&rdquo;</p><p>Bran applauded softly. &ldquo;If only Robb had you around to deal\nwith the caterers this morning.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, well, we all know that Robb can manage just fine on his\nown.&rdquo; Upon his silence, she turned to her younger brother and winked. </p><p>Tuxes in tow, they went to the florist next and then dropped\noff a check at the limousine shop. As they were leaving, Sansa&rsquo;s stomach\ngrumbled. &ldquo;Did you have a chance to look at the menu of the place we&rsquo;re going\ntonight&mdash;it&rsquo;s a Dornish restaurant, right?&rdquo;</p><p>Bran sighed. &ldquo;Over-priced and needlessly pretentious. You can&rsquo;t\npick your side dish; they get automatically assigned. And of course all the\ngood meat options are paired with the worst vegetables.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Does the vegetarian option at least look good? Sometimes&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not only vegetarian but also vegan and gluten-free. A\nmeal for all the difficult people.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa frowned. &ldquo;Why in the name of all the gods would we go\nthere then?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mom said it was close to the venue.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa bit her tongue to avoid saying what she was thinking.\nHer stomach grumbled again. &ldquo;We should eat now. At least we&rsquo;ll be able to get\none good meal in today.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The Ice Shack isn&rsquo;t too far from here,&rdquo; said Bran, grinning.\n&ldquo;We could get milkshakes&mdash;strawberry.&rdquo;</p><p>For a moment, she was 15, sitting in the Ice Shack parking\nlot, sipping on a strawberry milkshake and munching on fries in the front seat\nof Jon Snow&rsquo;s car.</p><p>But when she blinked, she was 21 again and in the driver&rsquo;s\nseat. &ldquo;All that dairy won&rsquo;t be good right before we have to take so many\npictures. Why don&rsquo;t we stop and get some sandwiches to bring home? I&rsquo;m sure\neveryone is hungry there.&rdquo;</p><p>Bran accepted her excuse, and she drove toward the nearest\nsandwich shop.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, little one,&rdquo; her father said when they returned with\nchores completed and lunch for everyone. &ldquo;We would not survive this weekend\nwithout you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not true,&rdquo; Sansa said, though she was not so sure. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not find out,&rdquo; Ned muttered. &ldquo;Go on and get ready. The\nboys and I can take it from here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You sure?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. All&rsquo;s that left is getting things in the car and\ngetting everybody dressed up before we go set up at the church. Maybe see if\nyou can convince Arya&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been able to convince Arya to do a\nsingle thing in my entire life. Do you really think this is the weekend when\nthat&rsquo;s going to change?&rdquo;</p><p>With his laughter ringing in the hall, she made her way\nupstairs and to the bathroom. There wasn&rsquo;t much time, but she desperately\nwanted a bath. It was going to be a long weekend; she needed to take the\nopportunities for quiet solitude when she could. </p><p>The bath worked, somewhat, to calm her down, but with each\nhour the rehearsal loomed closer, she could feel her pulse quicken. </p><p>Once dry and hair blown out, Sansa sat in front of her vanity\nmirror and applied her makeup as carefully as she could.

        "body": "<p>A lot of antis\ncomplain about Jonerys by saying that Jon and Dany are not equals, and by mocking\nJonerys shippers for thinking that they are. So I wanted talk about why I see\nJon and Dany as equals.</p><p>If we are going to\nconsider the amount of power that each one has, then yes, Jon and Dany are not\nequals, because Dany is much more powerful (I mean, of course, she has\ndragons!). Not only that, but Jon has bent the knee, which means that they\naren\u2019t equals in status anymore. But that\u2019s not what I think when I say they\nare equals. I see them as equals for several reasons:</p><p>1. When Jon and\nDany first meet, they are equal in status (even if not in power). Jon is a king\nand Dany is a queen. If it they had met at the beginning of the story, Viserys\nwould have considered Jon unworthy of even interacting with him and Dany for\nbeing a bastard. And Dany, being a girl, and an exiled and homeless princess,\nwouldn\u2019t ever be given a voice or power of her own. I believe that Jon and Dany\nwould still have treated each other with respect, because they are both decent\npeople, but the society and the people around them would have made it\nimpossible for them to ever build a relationship. But now, as king and queen,\nthey are both empowered, they command respect in a way that they never would in\nthe beginning of the story. So when they finally meet, they meet as equals. Both\nhave the same power to decide their own fates and the fates of their people,\nand to build this relationship if they choose to, unlike other times in which\nthey were forced into relationships.</p><p>2. Not only are\nthey equals in status when they meet, but their life stories are similar to each other. Jon\nand Dany both came from a place of powerlessness. Jon is a bastard and Dany was\nhomeless and poor, and both of them rose to power. They both used this power to\nchange society and help the oppressed. Both think their duties as rulers is to protect\ntheir people. And both had to deal with similar challenges: lack of food in the\nNight\u2019s Watch and in Meereen, making compromises for the sake of peace,\nsacrificing themselves for their people, fighting to reclaim their home,\nleading and uniting different groups of people, dealing with prejudice etc. And\nnow that they met, they are equals in experience. Dany is not an inexperienced\nlittle girl compared to Jon. Jon is not inexperienced compared to Dany. They\nare both seasoned rulers, equal in their capabilities. And this shared\nexperience is certainly one of the things that drew them to each other, what\nmakes them respect each other.</p><p>3. They respect\neach other. I know a lot of antis will say that Dany doesn\u2019t respect Jon\nbecause she doesn\u2019t call him a king in their first meeting, but that first\nmeeting is not really a good measure to see if Jon and Dany respect each other.\nDany obviously won\u2019t acknowledge that Jon is a king, because her own claim to\nWesteros depends on his kingship being invalid, and she is trying to intimidate\nJon into bending the knee. Jon, on the other hand, is not in his best behavior either,\nlike when he berates her and calls her a child for not believing in the Army of\nthe Dead. This is understandable on Jon\u2019s part because of the urgency of the\nsituation, but it\u2019s still an insulting thing to say to a queen. This first\nmeeting is a moment of conflicting interests and distrust, so I don\u2019t think\nusing only this scene is good enough to evaluate their relationship. But I\nthink that in all other scenes, we can see their respect for each other:</p><ul><li>Dany\napologizes for her father\u2019s crimes; she gives Jon dragonglass and men to mine\nwithout asking for anything in return; she discusses the Army of the Dead with\nhim, even if she doesn\u2019t believe it; she never calls him a bastard, and she\nstarts to call him a king after the first meeting; and she offers to help\ndestroy the Night King without asking Jon to bend the knee, because she realizes\nhow serious this is.</li><li>Jon,\non his part, recognizes her unwillingness to kill innocent people; he advises\nher when she asks for his help, without trying to tell her what to do; he recognizes\nthat her battle against the Lannister army is no different from his fight\nagainst the Boltons; and he bends the knee out of gratitude, because he recognizes\nthat giving her something in return is the honorable thing to do after all the\nhelp that Dany has offered and all the risk that she is taking to fight against\nthe dead (and he bends the knee because he wants to, not because Dany forced\nhim).<br/></li></ul><p>I really appreciate\ntheir how healthy and respectful their relationship is.</p><p>4. Lastly, they\nare equal in the narrative. None of them is narratively more important than the\nother. Dany is not a supporting character to Jon, and Jon is not a supporting\ncharacter to Dany. They are both the protagonists of their own stories. And\nthat is quite a refreshing thing, because in most romantic narratives, you will\nalways have one protagonist and one supporting character. I think it\u2019s quite\ninteresting that Jon and Dany break that rule.</p><p>In the end, I\ndon\u2019t think Jon and Dany need to have exactly the same amount of power to be equals.\nWhat matters to me is that their relationship is built in equality and respect.\nI also believe that if they survive and rule in the end, it will certainly be\nas equals. And that\u2019s amazing in itself, because Westeros would have, for the\nfirst time, a woman and a bastard as its rulers.</p>",

I know a lot of antis will say that Dany doesn\u2019t respect Jon\nbecause she doesn\u2019t call him a king in their first meeting, but that first\nmeeting is not really a good measure to see if Jon and Dany respect each other.\nDany obviously won\u2019t acknowledge that Jon is a king, because her own claim to\nWesteros depends on his kingship being invalid, and she is trying to intimidate\nJon into bending the knee. Jon, on the other hand, is not in his best behavior either,\nlike when he berates her and calls her a child for not believing in the Army of\nthe Dead. This is understandable on Jon\u2019s part because of the urgency of the\nsituation, but it\u2019s still an insulting thing to say to a queen. This first\nmeeting is a moment of conflicting interests and distrust, so I don\u2019t think\nusing only this scene is good enough to evaluate their relationship. But I\nthink that in all other scenes, we can see their respect for each other:</p><ul><li>Dany\napologizes for her father\u2019s crimes; she gives Jon dragonglass and men to mine\nwithout asking for anything in return; she discusses the Army of the Dead with\nhim, even if she doesn\u2019t believe it; she never calls him a bastard, and she\nstarts to call him a king after the first meeting; and she offers to help\ndestroy the Night King without asking Jon to bend the knee, because she realizes\nhow serious this is.</li><li>Jon,\non his part, recognizes her unwillingness to kill innocent people; he advises\nher when she asks for his help, without trying to tell her what to do; he recognizes\nthat her battle against the Lannister army is no different from his fight\nagainst the Boltons; and he bends the knee out of gratitude, because he recognizes\nthat giving her something in return is the honorable thing to do after all the\nhelp that Dany has offered and all the risk that she is taking to fight against\nthe dead (and he bends the knee because he wants to, not because Dany forced\nhim).<br></li></ul><p>I really appreciate\ntheir how healthy and respectful their relationship is.</p><p>4. Lastly, they\nare equal in the narrative. None of them is narratively more important than the\nother. Dany is not a supporting character to Jon, and Jon is not a supporting\ncharacter to Dany. They are both the protagonists of their own stories. And\nthat is quite a refreshing thing, because in most romantic narratives, you will\nalways have one protagonist and one supporting character. I think it\u2019s quite\ninteresting that Jon and Dany break that rule.</p><p>In the end, I\ndon\u2019t think Jon and Dany need to have exactly the same amount of power to be equals.\nWhat matters to me is that their relationship is built in equality and respect.\nI also believe that if they survive and rule in the end, it will certainly be\nas equals. And that\u2019s amazing in itself, because Westeros would have, for the\nfirst time, a woman and a bastard as its rulers.</p>",
                "content": "<p>A lot of antis\ncomplain about Jonerys by saying that Jon and Dany are not equals, and by mocking\nJonerys shippers for thinking that they are. So I wanted talk about why I see\nJon and Dany as equals.</p><p>If we are going to\nconsider the amount of power that each one has, then yes, Jon and Dany are not\nequals, because Dany is much more powerful (I mean, of course, she has\ndragons!). Not only that, but Jon has bent the knee, which means that they\naren&rsquo;t equals in status anymore. But that&rsquo;s not what I think when I say they\nare equals. I see them as equals for several reasons:</p><p>1. When Jon and\nDany first meet, they are equal in status (even if not in power). Jon is a king\nand Dany is a queen. If it they had met at the beginning of the story, Viserys\nwould have considered Jon unworthy of even interacting with him and Dany for\nbeing a bastard. And Dany, being a girl, and an exiled and homeless princess,\nwouldn&rsquo;t ever be given a voice or power of her own. I believe that Jon and Dany\nwould still have treated each other with respect, because they are both decent\npeople, but the society and the people around them would have made it\nimpossible for them to ever build a relationship. But now, as king and queen,\nthey are both empowered, they command respect in a way that they never would in\nthe beginning of the story. So when they finally meet, they meet as equals. Both\nhave the same power to decide their own fates and the fates of their people,\nand to build this relationship if they choose to, unlike other times in which\nthey were forced into relationships.</p><p>2. Not only are\nthey equals in status when they meet, but their life stories are similar to each other. Jon\nand Dany both came from a place of powerlessness. Jon is a bastard and Dany was\nhomeless and poor, and both of them rose to power. They both used this power to\nchange society and help the oppressed. Both think their duties as rulers is to protect\ntheir people. And both had to deal with similar challenges: lack of food in the\nNight&rsquo;s Watch and in Meereen, making compromises for the sake of peace,\nsacrificing themselves for their people, fighting to reclaim their home,\nleading and uniting different groups of people, dealing with prejudice etc. And\nnow that they met, they are equals in experience. Dany is not an inexperienced\nlittle girl compared to Jon. Jon is not inexperienced compared to Dany. They\nare both seasoned rulers, equal in their capabilities. And this shared\nexperience is certainly one of the things that drew them to each other, what\nmakes them respect each other.</p><p>3. They respect\neach other.
