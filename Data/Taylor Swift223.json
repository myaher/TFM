I have always respected and honored that Taylor Swift kept her political opinion to herself.  That is our right as citizens and we should\u2019ve never ever tried to assume what she thought or make conclusions to who and what she supports.  The people that assumed the worse did not know Taylor Swift and even though fans like me did know what Taylor stood for shouldn\u2019t have baggered her to voice it. It shouldn\u2019t matter if she\u2019s Jesus Christ or mother Mary themselves, we should not pressure celebrities to say their personal opinions.  She can be the person on stage and the same one in the voting booth, do we need to know that? She can still stand for everything she believes in and never speak a word. Actions are louder than words. I am glad she finally feels COMFORTABLE saying it and that she\u2019s saying it on her terms and will ever be grateful that she feels comfortable enough with our fan base to share this personal information with not only us but the world. Good for her! I myself have some artists where I\u2019m not too fond of them and their music and their political stance but I would never use their art against them. If you like someone\u2019s music and don\u2019t like their political opinion that\u2019s ok we don\u2019t need to like their political opinion to listen, see, appreciate, or like someone\u2019s art, music, work, etc.  I again never say anything about Donald Trump because that\u2019s how much power he truly has the attention he gets from his mouth.  I will continue to love Taylor\u2019s spirit, attitude towards things positivity, heart, soul and ART. Taylor did not say YOU NEED TO VOTE FOR THIS ONE. she is not Katy perry, Beyonc\u00e9, lady Gaga, Miley Cyrus (no offense to these artists or their fans I like and appreciate a few). No she did not try to brainwash you her opinion to persuade your vote.  I honor and praise that to the highest degree from ANY political stance.  She told us to get EDUCATED, REGISTER and PICK a candidate that aligns with OUR beliefs and morals. I feel that\u2019s a rare thing I see in celebrities these days they want their fans to have the same opinion or their not real fans and I feel some fans especially younger ones pick their idols because they have a fantasy of being like their idol.  That\u2019s not what having anyopinion is about. What Taylor wrote, That is not someone who got paid to say things, that\u2019s not telling someone you have to be this political party or you\u2019re a bigot/snow flake. Saying you don\u2019t have to be a political party just pick one that more aligns with your values because voting is important it really is.  Go Taylor Swift. Donald Trump, I\u2019m disappointed in your joke that died as it came out of your mouth. I\u2019m no snowflake but I\u2019m also no stinge either.  I still enjoy the artist I like despite political beliefs whether they\u2019re mine or not. I know your old but you don\u2019t need to fit the old fart cranky frank stereotype.  Good day y\u2019all love Taylor Swift and watch IDSB at the AMAs!</p>",

I will continue to love Taylor\u2019s spirit, attitude towards things positivity, heart, soul and ART. Taylor did not say YOU NEED TO VOTE FOR THIS ONE. she is not Katy perry, Beyonc\u00e9, lady Gaga, Miley Cyrus (no offense to these artists or their fans I like and appreciate a few). No she did not try to brainwash you her opinion to persuade your vote.  I honor and praise that to the highest degree from ANY political stance.  She told us to get EDUCATED, REGISTER and PICK a candidate that aligns with OUR beliefs and morals. I feel that\u2019s a rare thing I see in celebrities these days they want their fans to have the same opinion or their not real fans and I feel some fans especially younger ones pick their idols because they have a fantasy of being like their idol.  That\u2019s not what having anyopinion is about.

I have always respected and honored that Taylor Swift kept her political opinion to herself.  That is our right as citizens and we should\u2019ve never ever tried to assume what she thought or make conclusions to who and what she supports.  The people that assumed the worse did not know Taylor Swift and even though fans like me did know what Taylor stood for shouldn\u2019t have baggered her to voice it. It shouldn\u2019t matter if she\u2019s Jesus Christ or mother Mary themselves, we should not pressure celebrities to say their personal opinions.  She can be the person on stage and the same one in the voting booth, do we need to know that? She can still stand for everything she believes in and never speak a word. Actions are louder than words. I am glad she finally feels COMFORTABLE saying it and that she\u2019s saying it on her terms and will ever be grateful that she feels comfortable enough with our fan base to share this personal information with not only us but the world. Good for her! I myself have some artists where I\u2019m not too fond of them and their music and their political stance but I would never use their art against them. If you like someone\u2019s music and don\u2019t like their political opinion that\u2019s ok we don\u2019t need to like their political opinion to listen, see, appreciate, or like someone\u2019s art, music, work, etc.  I again never say anything about Donald Trump because that\u2019s how much power he truly has the attention he gets from his mouth.  I will continue to love Taylor\u2019s spirit, attitude towards things positivity, heart, soul and ART. Taylor did not say YOU NEED TO VOTE FOR THIS ONE. she is not Katy perry, Beyonc\u00e9, lady Gaga, Miley Cyrus (no offense to these artists or their fans I like and appreciate a few). No she did not try to brainwash you her opinion to persuade your vote.  I honor and praise that to the highest degree from ANY political stance.  She told us to get EDUCATED, REGISTER and PICK a candidate that aligns with OUR beliefs and morals. I feel that\u2019s a rare thing I see in celebrities these days they want their fans to have the same opinion or their not real fans and I feel some fans especially younger ones pick their idols because they have a fantasy of being like their idol.  That\u2019s not what having anyopinion is about. What Taylor wrote, That is not someone who got paid to say things, that\u2019s not telling someone you have to be this political party or you\u2019re a bigot/snow flake. Saying you don\u2019t have to be a political party just pick one that more aligns with your values because voting is important it really is.  Go Taylor Swift. Donald Trump, I\u2019m disappointed in your joke that died as it came out of your mouth. I\u2019m no snowflake but I\u2019m also no stinge either.  I still enjoy the artist I like despite political beliefs whether they\u2019re mine or not. I know your old but you don\u2019t need to fit the old fart cranky frank stereotype.  Good day y\u2019all love Taylor Swift and watch IDSB at the AMAs!</p>",
