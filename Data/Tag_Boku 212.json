        "answer": "<p>I\u2019m sorry this took so long, but I got really sucked into this request.\u00a0</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>Ever since the pro-heroes had taken your uncle down, you had a hard time fitting in anywhere. For you see your uncle was a villain well-known to the pro-heroes. ever since the took him they brought you into questioning. You told them everything that your uncle made you do. How your parents died in a car accident when you were just a kid. How you didn&rsquo;t know right from wrong because of your uncle. He made you into a villain without you giving you a choice. Of course, the people who were shocked to hear this, so they called in a pro-hero. They left the room and left you alone in the room. </p><p>Suddenly, you heard a knock on the door and in came Aizawa Shota.</p><p>You knew him because he was a hero your uncle fought with often. He sat down from across of you. He told you he had heard the story you had told from the guards interviewing you. You broke down with tears in your eyes and told him you just wanted a second chance. You felt him place a hand on your shoulder. You looked at him. He told you he would train you to become a hero. You were shocked and gave him a weak smile. </p><p>&ldquo; Thank you, &rdquo; you said. Finally, you were given the second chance you had dreamed. </p><p>Ever since that interview with Aizawa, you had been training with him every week since your powers were still a little out of control. But the more you trained with Aizawa, the more you improved by the day. </p><p>Then one fateful day&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;What!? &rdquo; you said shocked at what Aizawa said. </p><p>&ldquo; You will enroll at UA next week. &rdquo; Aizawa said. </p><p>&ldquo; A-Are you sure I&rsquo;m ready for that, what would the others think about me, &rdquo; you said and looked down at the floor. You suddenly felt Aizawa pat your head. You looked up at him. </p><p>&ldquo; You&rsquo;ll be okay. &rdquo; Was the only thing he said. </p><p>The day finally came, the day you would enroll in UA. You were following behind Aizawa to the classroom. Already you were getting some pretty weird looks, some even looked scared. You soon reached the classroom. You entered together with Aizawa, and almost immediately you could feel eyes on you. </p><p>&ldquo; Everyone sits down! This is y/n l/n, she will be your new classmate, treat her with respect. y/n you can take a seat next to Uraraka. Uraraka raises your hand. &rdquo; Aizawa said. You looked up and saw a girl with short hair raise her hand. You walked your way to her, and the corner of your eye you saw scared looked interested looks and even a guy giving you a glare. You sat down and looked at the girl next to you. You gave her a nervous smile. To your surprise, she actually smiled and waved back at you. Maybe this wasn&rsquo;t going to be so bad.</p><p>&ldquo; Let&rsquo;s begin. &rdquo; Aizawa said and started the lesson. </p><p>TIME SKIP</p><p>Soon the lesson was over and lunch began. You had no plan on going to the cafeteria, not feeling like you should expose yourself more than necessary. Suddenly you saw the girl you sit next to and two other guys approach you</p><p>&ldquo; HI my name is Uraraka Ochako! This is Midoriya and Iida, &rdquo; she said in a cheery voice. </p><p>&ldquo; Nice t-to meet y-you guys. &rdquo; You said stuttering because you were so nervous. </p><p>&ldquo; I wanted to ask you If you wanted to eat lunch with us? &rdquo; Uraraka asked which surprised you. </p><p>&ldquo; I- Um O-okay, &rdquo; you said stuttering. You picked up your lunch box and walked with them to the cafeteria. As you were walking to the cafeteria you got some glares and weird looks. </p><p>&ldquo; Are you okay y/n? &rdquo; Midoriya asked you since he noticed you were uncomfortable. </p><p>&ldquo; N-No I&rsquo;m okay thank you for asking. &rdquo; You said and gave him a weak smile. </p><p>&ldquo; If someone Is making you uncomfortable You should tell us. &rdquo; Iida said in a very serious tone. You smiled and looked at him. </p><p>&ldquo; Thank you, Iida, but I&rsquo;m okay. &rdquo; You said and gave him a smile. </p><p>Lunch came and went with any problems&hellip; At least not this time. </p><p>TIME SKIP - Months ahead. </p><p>After months of going to UA, you had gotten along with Uraraka, Midoriya, and Iida. You had told them the story about your uncle and how he had turned you into a villain. But after Aizawa had put you straight, you had gotten the second chance you had wished for. </p><p>Another thing was, that Midoriya was so curious about your quick, and how far you could stretch your limbs. </p><p>Another surprising thing was Iida confessed to you after a month since you first met. You said yes to being his girlfriend and you couldn&rsquo;t be happier. </p><p>But even though you had made many friends who saw past your past about you being a villain, you still had a lot of enemies. </p><p>Bakugou bullied and insulted you by calling you a villain, and soon other people caught on. People kept calling you a villain no matter how hard you worked to become a hero. </p><p>&ldquo; Once a villain, always a villain. &rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo; Villains can&rsquo;t turn into heroes, go back to the dump where they found you, villain. &rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo; You&rsquo;re a villain you don&rsquo;t belong here. &rdquo; </p><p>These were only some of the things that people said to you. Since you were trying to turn yourself into a good person you just held your tongue back and didn&rsquo;t say anything. </p><p>When you told Iida about this, he absolutely lost. He complained to the principal and the teachers of the students who had insulted and would even lecture them. </p><p>But one day you snapped&hellip;</p><p>You were being yelled at by Bakugou. But this time he went all out. Calling you names and grabbing the collar of your shirt. </p><p>&ldquo; We don&rsquo;t need villains like you, just go die. &rdquo; Bakugou said and let go of your collar and pushed you back. That made you snap. </p><p>&ldquo; I DIDN&rsquo;T HAVE A CHOICE YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE! &rdquo; you screamed at him. everyone even Bakugou was taken aback since this was the first time you had ever shouted at someone. </p><p>&ldquo; Do you know how it feels to manipulated and brainwashed to be something you never wanted to be! I was lucky to be given a second chance, but assholes like you are making it hard to even making it feel worth it! &rdquo; You said and stormed out the classroom. Since Iida wasn&rsquo;t that, Uraraka and Midoriya began to run after you. </p><p>You bumped into to someone but didn&rsquo;t look up and continued running away. </p><p>&ldquo; Y/N! &rdquo; you heard a familiar shout after you, but you didn&rsquo;t stop. </p><p>&ldquo; Iida! &rdquo; he heard someone shout from behind him. He saw Uraraka and Midoriya running towards him. </p><p>&ldquo; What happened to y/n!? &rdquo; he asked. Midoriya explained the scenario that had gone down between you and Bakugou. Both Uraraka and Midoriya could visibly see that Iida was becoming angrier and angrier by the second. All of a sudden, Iida pushed past both of them and walked angrily towards the classroom. </p><p>Iida immediately spotted Bakugou, and walked over to him and grabbed his collar and began shouting at him. </p><p>&ldquo; How dare you insulted y/n when she&rsquo;s trying to turn her life around after all she&rsquo;s been through! She deserves better than to be insulted and bullied by people like you! &rdquo; Iida shouted into Bakugou&rsquo;s face and then let him go and turned his head to look for you. Everyone in the class was visibly shocked because they have never seen Iida do something like that. \u00a0He looked everywhere but didn&rsquo;t have any luck finding you. </p><p>&ldquo; Iida! &rdquo; It was Uraraka. </p><p>&ldquo;Uraraka have you seen y/n. &rdquo; Iida asked her. </p><p>&ldquo; She&rsquo;s in the infirmary with recovery girl. &rdquo; Uraraka said. Iida didn&rsquo;t say anything and began to run towards the infirmary. Iida entered the infirmary, and the second he saw you he ran over to you and gave you the biggest hug. The moment Iida brought you into his embrace you broke down and hugged him back tightly. </p><p>&ldquo; Ssh It&rsquo;s okay It&rsquo;s okay. &rdquo; Iida said while stroking your hair. Suddenly you heard a knock on the door. You looked up and saw Aizawa standing in the door frame. You let go of Iida and Aizawa walked over to you. </p><p>&ldquo; I&rsquo;m sorry Aizawa-sensei, &rdquo; you said and didn&rsquo;t look at him. You could feel Iida squeeze your hand. </p><p>&ldquo; y/n I&rsquo;m not mad at you for what you did, but you need to control yourself. You&rsquo;ll meet more people like this in your future, so you&rsquo;ll have to be strong. &rdquo; Aizawa said. </p><p>&ldquo; I understand Aizawa-sensei, I will try to become stronger, &rdquo; you told him. </p><p>&ldquo; You both are excused for the rest of the day. Iida makes sure y/n gets home safely. &rdquo; Aizawa said before he left the infirmary. You looked at Aizawa and then looked at Iida. </p><p>&ldquo; Wait here y/n, I&rsquo;ll go get our bags. &rdquo; Iida said. You didn&rsquo;t say anything, you just gave him a nod. You waited until Iida came back with yours and his bag. Iida returned very quickly and gave you your bag. </p><p>When you walked in the hallway you could everyone looking at you. You grabbed Iida&rsquo;s sleeve. Iida looked at you and saw how uncomfortable you were and grabbed your hand and squeezed it. </p><p>You finally made it out of the school, and you could finally breathe. </p><p>&ldquo; Are you okay y/n? &rdquo; Iida asked you. </p><p>&ldquo; Yeah I&rsquo;m fine. Thank you so much, Iida, for being there for me, &rdquo; you said and leaned into him feeling completely safe with him. </p><p>&ldquo; I will always be there for you y/n. &rdquo; Iida said and wrapped his arms around you in a tight embrace. </p><p>&ldquo; I love you Iida. &rdquo; you smiled and hugged him tighter. </p><p>&ldquo; I love you too y/n now and forever. &rdquo; He said and kissed the top of your head. </p>",

For you see your uncle was a villain well-known to the pro-heroes. ever since the took him they brought you into questioning. You told them everything that your uncle made you do. How your parents died in a car accident when you were just a kid. How you didn\u2019t know right from wrong because of your uncle. He made you into a villain without you giving you a choice. Of course, the people who were shocked to hear this, so they called in a pro-hero. They left the room and left you alone in the room. </p><p>Suddenly, you heard a knock on the door and in came Aizawa Shota.</p><p>You knew him because he was a hero your uncle fought with often. He sat down from across of you. He told you he had heard the story you had told from the guards interviewing you. You broke down with tears in your eyes and told him you just wanted a second chance. You felt him place a hand on your shoulder. You looked at him. He told you he would train you to become a hero. You were shocked and gave him a weak smile. </p><p>\u201c Thank you, \u201d you said. Finally, you were given the second chance you had dreamed. </p><p>Ever since that interview with Aizawa, you had been training with him every week since your powers were still a little out of control. But the more you trained with Aizawa, the more you improved by the day. </p><p>Then one fateful day\u2026</p><p>\u201cWhat!? \u201d you said shocked at what Aizawa said. </p><p>\u201c You will enroll at UA next week. \u201d Aizawa said. </p><p>\u201c A-Are you sure I\u2019m ready for that, what would the others think about me, \u201d you said and looked down at the floor. You suddenly felt Aizawa pat your head. You looked up at him. </p><p>\u201c You\u2019ll be okay. \u201d Was the only thing he said. </p><p>The day finally came, the day you would enroll in UA. You were following behind Aizawa to the classroom. Already you were getting some pretty weird looks, some even looked scared. You soon reached the classroom. You entered together with Aizawa, and almost immediately you could feel eyes on you. </p><p>\u201c Everyone sits down! This is y/n l/n, she will be your new classmate, treat her with respect. y/n you can take a seat next to Uraraka. Uraraka raises your hand. \u201d Aizawa said. You looked up and saw a girl with short hair raise her hand. You walked your way to her, and the corner of your eye you saw scared looked interested looks and even a guy giving you a glare. You sat down and looked at the girl next to you. You gave her a nervous smile. To your surprise, she actually smiled and waved back at you. Maybe this wasn\u2019t going to be so bad.</p><p>\u201c Let\u2019s begin. \u201d Aizawa said and started the lesson. </p><p>TIME SKIP</p><p>Soon the lesson was over and lunch began. You had no plan on going to the cafeteria, not feeling like you should expose yourself more than necessary. Suddenly you saw the girl you sit next to and two other guys approach you</p><p>\u201c HI my name is Uraraka Ochako! This is Midoriya and Iida, \u201d she said in a cheery voice. </p><p>\u201c Nice t-to meet y-you guys. \u201d You said stuttering because you were so nervous. </p><p>\u201c I wanted to ask you If you wanted to eat lunch with us? \u201d Uraraka asked which surprised you. </p><p>\u201c I- Um O-okay, \u201d you said stuttering. You picked up your lunch box and walked with them to the cafeteria. As you were walking to the cafeteria you got some glares and weird looks. </p><p>\u201c Are you okay y/n? \u201d Midoriya asked you since he noticed you were uncomfortable. </p><p>\u201c N-No I\u2019m okay thank you for asking. \u201d You said and gave him a weak smile. </p><p>\u201c If someone Is making you uncomfortable You should tell us. \u201d Iida said in a very serious tone. You smiled and looked at him. </p><p>\u201c Thank you, Iida, but I\u2019m okay. \u201d You said and gave him a smile. </p><p>Lunch came and went with any problems\u2026 At least not this time. </p><p>TIME SKIP - Months ahead. </p><p>After months of going to UA, you had gotten along with Uraraka, Midoriya, and Iida. You had told them the story about your uncle and how he had turned you into a villain. But after Aizawa had put you straight, you had gotten the second chance you had wished for. </p><p>Another thing was, that Midoriya was so curious about your quick, and how far you could stretch your limbs. </p><p>Another surprising thing was Iida confessed to you after a month since you first met. You said yes to being his girlfriend and you couldn\u2019t be happier. </p><p>But even though you had made many friends who saw past your past about you being a villain, you still had a lot of enemies. </p><p>Bakugou bullied and insulted you by calling you a villain, and soon other people caught on. People kept calling you a villain no matter how hard you worked to become a hero. </p><p>\u201c Once a villain, always a villain. \u201d</p><p>\u201c Villains can\u2019t turn into heroes, go back to the dump where they found you, villain. \u201d</p><p>\u201c You\u2019re a villain you don\u2019t belong here. \u201d </p><p>These were only some of the things that people said to you. Since you were trying to turn yourself into a good person you just held your tongue back and didn\u2019t say anything. </p><p>When you told Iida about this, he absolutely lost. He complained to the principal and the teachers of the students who had insulted and would even lecture them. </p><p>But one day you snapped\u2026</p><p>You were being yelled at by Bakugou. But this time he went all out. Calling you names and grabbing the collar of your shirt. </p><p>\u201c We don\u2019t need villains like you, just go die. \u201d Bakugou said and let go of your collar and pushed you back. That made you snap. </p><p>\u201c I DIDN\u2019T HAVE A CHOICE YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE! \u201d you screamed at him. everyone even Bakugou was taken aback since this was the first time you had ever shouted at someone. </p><p>\u201c Do you know how it feels to manipulated and brainwashed to be something you never wanted to be! I was lucky to be given a second chance, but assholes like you are making it hard to even making it feel worth it! \u201d You said and stormed out the classroom. Since Iida wasn\u2019t that, Uraraka and Midoriya began to run after you. </p><p>You bumped into to someone but didn\u2019t look up and continued running away. </p><p>\u201c Y/N! \u201d you heard a familiar shout after you, but you didn\u2019t stop. </p><p>\u201c Iida! \u201d he heard someone shout from behind him. He saw Uraraka and Midoriya running towards him. </p><p>\u201c What happened to y/n!? \u201d he asked. Midoriya explained the scenario that had gone down between you and Bakugou. Both Uraraka and Midoriya could visibly see that Iida was becoming angrier and angrier by the second. All of a sudden, Iida pushed past both of them and walked angrily towards the classroom. </p><p>Iida immediately spotted Bakugou, and walked over to him and grabbed his collar and began shouting at him. </p><p>\u201c How dare you insulted y/n when she\u2019s trying to turn her life around after all she\u2019s been through! She deserves better than to be insulted and bullied by people like you! \u201d Iida shouted into Bakugou\u2019s face and then let him go and turned his head to look for you. Everyone in the class was visibly shocked because they have never seen Iida do something like that. \u00a0He looked everywhere but didn\u2019t have any luck finding you. </p><p>\u201c Iida! \u201d It was Uraraka. </p><p>\u201cUraraka have you seen y/n. \u201d Iida asked her. </p><p>\u201c She\u2019s in the infirmary with recovery girl. \u201d Uraraka said. Iida didn\u2019t say anything and began to run towards the infirmary. Iida entered the infirmary, and the second he saw you he ran over to you and gave you the biggest hug. The moment Iida brought you into his embrace you broke down and hugged him back tightly. </p><p>\u201c Ssh It\u2019s okay It\u2019s okay. \u201d Iida said while stroking your hair. Suddenly you heard a knock on the door. You looked up and saw Aizawa standing in the door frame. You let go of Iida and Aizawa walked over to you. </p><p>\u201c I\u2019m sorry Aizawa-sensei, \u201d you said and didn\u2019t look at him. You could feel Iida squeeze your hand. </p><p>\u201c y/n I\u2019m not mad at you for what you did, but you need to control yourself. You\u2019ll meet more people like this in your future, so you\u2019ll have to be strong. \u201d Aizawa said. </p><p>\u201c I understand Aizawa-sensei, I will try to become stronger, \u201d you told him. </p><p>\u201c You both are excused for the rest of the day. Iida makes sure y/n gets home safely. \u201d Aizawa said before he left the infirmary. You looked at Aizawa and then looked at Iida. </p><p>\u201c Wait here y/n, I\u2019ll go get our bags. \u201d Iida said. You didn\u2019t say anything, you just gave him a nod. You waited until Iida came back with yours and his bag. Iida returned very quickly and gave you your bag. </p><p>When you walked in the hallway you could everyone looking at you. You grabbed Iida\u2019s sleeve. Iida looked at you and saw how uncomfortable you were and grabbed your hand and squeezed it. </p><p>You finally made it out of the school, and you could finally breathe. </p><p>\u201c Are you okay y/n? \u201d Iida asked you. </p><p>\u201c Yeah I\u2019m fine. Thank you so much, Iida, for being there for me, \u201d you said and leaned into him feeling completely safe with him. </p><p>\u201c I will always be there for you y/n. \u201d Iida said and wrapped his arms around you in a tight embrace. </p><p>\u201c I love you Iida. \u201d you smiled and hugged him tighter. </p><p>\u201c I love you too y/n now and forever. \u201d He said and kissed the top of your head. </p>",
