Blood dried up under\nyour nose as your vision turned into darkness. </p><p><i>\u201cMy Lord! You must stop before we are caught.\u201d You giggled,\nlaughing as you ran around your room in a mere corset and linen pants. You were\nexposed to his indecent eyes, as a woman should never reveal her underwear to a\nman. But Jimin was just too greedy, so he snuck into your room to surprise you.\nYou ran up the stair case towards your small library, him following not far behind.\n</i></p><p><i>\u201cBut tis\u2019 fine if no one can catch us, for I must never take\nmy eyes off such beauty.\u201d His words made you blush at such provocative words that\nhe used. You watched with wicked eyes as he ran up the staircase, arms reaching\nout and captivating you. </i></p><!-- more --><p><i>He turned you in his arms, so you were now facing him, a\nsmile still present on both of your faces as you looked up to meet his eyes.\nHis piercing eyes, you had never seen such eyes before or such beauty. </i></p><p><i>\u201cMy Lord\u2026\u201d You breathed but didn\u2019t get to finish as he\npressed a finger to your lips softly, silencing you. Shaking his head as he muttered\na \u2018don\u2019t speak\u2019 and slowly leaned in. His lips getting closer and closer to\nyour own and you didn\u2019t take your eyes off his for a second. When his eyes\nbegan to close yours did too, a split second before his lips barely grazed your\nown. His bottom lip brushing over your top lip, your breath hitched in your\nthroat as you ached to just kiss him already. </i></p><p><i>When he finally pressed his lips to yours they were barely there\nfor a mere second before you pulled away at the sound of your lady in waiting\u2019s\nvoice as she came into your room. Her eyes were locked on the two of you, you\nslowly back away and out of Jimin\u2019s arms as he cleared his throat and straightened\nhimself out. </i></p><p><i>\u201cMy Lord was just leaving.\u201d You said, nodding your head as\nJimin took your sign and left. You wandered down the stairs after him and\ntowards your lady in waiting. She closed the doors after Jimin before turning to\nyou with a disappointed look and a sigh as she shook her head. \u201cWhat? So I was\nmessing around for a bit. I\u2019m allowed to play a little.\u201d You smirked as you\nturned to the mirror and looked at yourself as she began to prepare your gown\nfor tea. </i></p><p><i>\u201cM\u2019lady, do you think it is good for you to get close to him.\nAfter all he is very young and clearly filled with lust, playing with him will\nonly end in something bad for you both.\u201d You rolled your eyes with a small\nsmile on your face. </i></p><p><i>\u201cEmilia, do not fret. As my Lord will be handsomely rewarded\nand no hard shall come to him.\u201d You explained, taking in breathes each time she\ntightened your corset even more. </i></p><p><i>\u201cAnd the ritual?\u201d She asked, eyes meeting yours in the\nmirror. </i></p><p><i>\u201cAnd the ritual will not proceed, I will handle it.\u201d You\nsaid through gritted teeth before picking up the plush brush and powdering your\nnose softly. </i></p><p>Your eyes opened, slowly and barely at first. The light was blinding to your sore and weak eyes as they had been closed for a long time now. It was mid-day and you had been moved from the floor to a chair, your hands handcuffed behind it and your body tied to the chair.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFrig\u00f8re.\u201d you said, hoping that the rope would be removed, and the handcuffs would break but they failed to do so. You repeated the word over and over again. You looked around, why wasn\u2019t your magic working? You were saying the words but it\u2019s like your energy had been blocked. </p><p>\u201cTrust me it won\u2019t work. The cast I spell, try and see if you can recognize it. M\u00e5 lyst og loathe afbryde energi fra dig. That\u2019s right sweet heart, a little spell cast to put away your juice for a bit so I can really break you down.\u201d He said, walking closer to you so he was now right in your face. Taunting you. </p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t last much longer, and you know what else, neither will this body. Give up Jimin, because the old Y/N you knew\u2026she\u2019s not coming back.\u201d You spat before leaning back in your chair and looking away. You could feel how pale you were, you needed something to drink but you refused to give in. Jimin on the other hand is great at reading minds, he opened a bottle of water, holding it in front of your face. </p><p>You knew you needed it, and as much as you would love to just keep resisting you opened your lips and allowed him to give you water. You only got a quarter in when he pulled the bottle away. </p><p>\u201cNow, I want some answers. How do I get to purgatory?\u201d He demanded, you just chuckled, throwing your head back. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s funny. Do you also want to know if the Easter Bunny is real?\u201d You said with a smirk on your face. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not fucking around this time Y/N, I need to know. If you tell me I\u2019ll tell you\u2026about Anzia.\u201d This caught your interest. You wanted to know more about this girl, why she was so important to Jimin. Any way to find out about his weak spots you\u2019d gladly give away unhelpful information. </p><p>\u201cSo I tell you some measly information about a place that is impossible to even get to, and you\u2019ll tell me about this girl.\u201d You said, making sure he understood what he was getting himself into. </p><p>\u201cWell I guess it depends on how long you\u2019re awake for, I cursed your water with the same spell as before. So I\u2019d hurry if I were you, the clock is ticking.\u201d He clicked his tongue before flashing a smirk your way. </p><p>\u201cOkay! There\u2019s only one way to get there but even if you did there isn\u2019t any way of getting back. No soul ever returns to it\u2019s body once it lands in that place.\u201d You growled, Jimin continued to listen. \u201cYou need a witch.\u201d You stated as he nodded for you to go on. </p><p>\u201cYou need a white witch. And the process of getting there is crucial. You have to leave your body and go there, but if you\u2019re not back within seven hours\u2026you\u2019re dead.\u201d You said, slowly you can feel yourself starting to weaken. Feeling your veins protrude as the spell began taking its toll on you. </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a spell in my grimoire, it can help you. But you can only do it with a white witch, you need a witch with the spiritual connection to the other side and\u2014\u201d you paused, licking your lips as your body had really started to weaken now. Feeling your nose drip blood once again, Jimin wiping it away with his thumb. He knew the spell had started to weaken you, and that you wouldn\u2019t be able to say much more until you woke up again. \u00a0<br/></p><p><i>\u201cAnzia, would you finish getting ready. Dinner is being served.\u201d You pushed Jimin away from you, fixing up your dress as it had been pulled to reveal your shoulder to Jimin for him to linger his lips on.\u00a0</i><br/></p><p><i>\u201cYes mother, I\u2019ll be present within time.\u201d You said, trying not to make yourself sound as worked up as you were. When you finally fell into silence you turned to a smirking Jimin.\u00a0\u201cYou scoundrel! I was almost caught.\u201d You said, trying to fight back a smile as you threw a plush pillow at his laughing self. He moved back up to you, a smug grin on his face as he pressed his lips to yours but they did not stay.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou must attend to your guest downstairs. You shouldn\u2019t keep him waiting.\u201d You sighed, knowing that he was right. You hated that Jimin couldn\u2019t be the one chosen for you. But instead chosen to be betrothed to your sister.\u00a0<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cI will be seated downstairs in a short time, you must leave now to avoid suspicion though my love.\u201d You said, pushing him towards your door before pressing your lips to his one last time before he left. You sighed as you moved to your wardrobe, pulling a single lever and opening up the small space where you kept your herbs and such.\u00a0</i><br/></p><p><i>\u201cI need to do it tonight, if he wants me to be with him forever.\u201d You said to yourself as you held the dagger in your hands and eyed the detailed iron. You put it away and quickly fixed yourself before going downstairs and taking your place at the table. To your fiance, which wasn\u2019t where you wanted to be. You wanted to be further up the table with Jimin and for your sister to be somewhere else.\u00a0<br/></i></p><p><i>She didn\u2019t deserve Jimin, nor did she love Jimin as you did. You would do anything to be with him.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cAnzia and Harry plan to wed in just a couple of days, the whole kingdom is excited to be invited.\u201d Your mother boasted to the other women, distant cousins and aunts who have come to stay with you at the palace.\u00a0<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cYes well, who can blame them? Two soul mates, once at last together.\u201d Harry held your hand and raised it with his glass, waiting for you to do so. You felt your chest tighten and your eyes water at the thought of being stuck with him for the rest of your life. All for money and the throne.\u00a0<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cI don\u2019t seem to have a spoon for my soup, may you pass me your unused one Jimin?\u201d One of your ugly aunts asked, clearly eyeing him like he was a piece of meat. He handed it over to her and you watched as she leaned forward so he could see down her dress and her bosoms. You couldn\u2019t stand it, one minute she was shooting suggestive looks his way, the next she had fallen off her seat with half her face burnt off from the flame of the candle.\u00a0<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened, it\u2019s like it flared up in my face.\u201d Everyone went to her aid, all except Jimin who looked at you from his spot on the table. He didn\u2019t look happy though, he looked upset and angry that you would do such a thing. And he was. You stood up from the table and left, returning upstairs to your chambers where you wanted to be alone.\u00a0<br/></i></p><p><i>Jimin followed you in right behind you, angry and furious.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cHow could you, she did nothing to anger you!\u201d Jimin growled as he slammed your doors shut.\u00a0<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cShe was acting like a harlot, throwing her treasures in your face like it was something you desired. It already hurts to see you with my sister! Do not make me a fool for seeing you with another woman.\u201d You growled, feeling Jimin was stepping out of line here.\u00a0<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cI do not make you a fool, you already make yourself a fool believing this can go on. Well it can\u2019t, I won\u2019t watch as you toy with everyone because of your gifts over jealousy. It disgusts me.\u201d You just wanted him. You just wanted something for you and you only for once. All your life you grew up giving and sharing with your sister and it was never fair. She always got what you wanted.\u00a0<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cAnzia, I am giving you a choice. Either we end this now or we go tell our families. I cannot hide it or explain my absences\u00a0to your sister no longer.\u201d You knew it was time, it had to be tonight.\u00a0<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cWe have another choice, another way out of this. All you need to do&hellip;is trust me.\u201d Your hands caressed his face, his eyes sparkling as they stared straight into yours.\u00a0<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cI trust you.\u201d\u00a0<br/></i></p><p>\u201cHow do I know that I can trust your word?\u201d Jimin asked as he gave you more water, you felt so exhausted at this point.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou really think I would lie? I\u2019ve been stuck in this chair for hours now. I\u2019m starving, I need to feel energy again. I can get you my grimoire but I can\u2019t just give it to you. Of course though, you already knew that so you had planned something else already.\u201d You said, eyeing Jimin as he paced back and forth.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI can give you answers, I know you\u2019ve been seeing her. In your visions, Anzia. My first love.\u201d You were confused, you thought they were dreams or something, hallucinations. Unwanted thoughts. You nodded for him to go on, hold up his end of the deal.\u00a0\u201cIt was 1242 and I was betrothed to Anzia\u2019s sister, but I knew that Anzia was who I really wanted to be with.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cMy eldest daughter, Katya. She is very beautiful and smart, she knows seven languages, she can read and write and is an astounding horse rider.\u201d Queen Livia boasted as she pointed to he eldest daughter and looked at her with envy. Jimin nodded, giving a small smile.\u00a0\u201cAnd my other daughter, who is currently running late.\u201d Anzia was just finishing getting ready, she knew she was late. She could hear them outside as they pulled up.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>She ran downstairs in a hurry, everyone\u2019s attention on her. Katya rolling her eyes and Livia looking at her daughter with disappointment.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cAnzia! Please remember your vowels!\u201d Her mother shouted as Anzia was quickly to go back to walking calmly and keeping posture as she went and stood next to her sister.\u00a0<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cMy Lord, please pardon my youngest daughter\u2019s actions as she isn\u2019t exactly as proper as a woman should be.\u201d Livia apologised, there was never a time she could be proud of Anzia. She always found a way to make Anzia feel like the black sheep of the family while Anzia watched her sister be loved and adored by her family while she stood aside.\u00a0<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cPlease, call me Jimin. My Lord is very formal and I don\u2019t want to have to feel as if your girls need to think of me as anything higher than them.\u201d His eyes met Anzia\u2019s and he knew. He knew he wanted to be with her, she held more mystery and fire in her eyes than any other maiden before him had. Anzia\u2019s sister noticed Jimin staring and decided to steal his attention back.\u00a0<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cMy Lord, shall we enjoy a stroll through the garden? the fountain has just recently been built in.\u201d Katya was beautiful, smart and yes the perfect daughter. But she was always so envious of how charming her little sister could be, she was also very jealous of the men who always were attracted to Anzia. She always saw her little sister as someone immature, childish and a fool as she always wore her heart on her sleeve and that\u2019s how she easily got herself hurt.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>While Katya and Jimin enjoyed the nice walk around the garden, Anzia sat in her room watching from her balcony. She wanted him. He was so beautiful, so captivating. She felt an urge inside her to have him. She too was jealous, and filled with anger of how disrespected she is in her family. As she clenched her fists the peach roses began to crisp and fade into a disgusting dead colour. Closing in on themselves and petals falling off.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Anzia hated how her elder sister always came first, always had what she wanted. It wasn\u2019t fair.\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cBut how did you and her end up together? I mean it obviously was no cake walk if you were betrothed to her sister.\u201d You said, some reason captivated by the story.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cAnzia and I knew we had interest, of course at first we knew we should not act on our desires as we both had a role to play. She was very quiet and shy around me, but when I got her talking her laugh would fill my ears and her smile would light up the room like no other. She was absolutely beautiful in every way.\u201d Jimin went on, a small glint in his eye that really showed his love for Anzia.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhen did you first act?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p><i>\u201cDo not be alarmed m\u2019lady, tis just me.\u201d Jimin\u2019s presence made Anzia\u2019s heart race, she had been spending a lot of time hiding away from him. She felt that she might make a mistake or act on her desires if she were to be around him, just him. She was hiding away in this library, rearranging books to be where they belong.\u00a0</i><br/></p><p><i>\u201cMy Lord, so kind of you to join me in the library. I thought you\u2019d be tending to my sister\u2019s needs.\u201d She said, bowing her head as he entered and she greeted him.\u00a0<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cPlease m\u2019lady, call me by my name. I feel as if we are too caught up in maturity and we should be fools when together.\u201d The words made her heart jump, she had just been dying to call him by his name. Practicing\u00a0how she would say his name in private.\u00a0<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cYes, Jimin.\u201d He smiled when his name rolled off her tongue, it was like the name was made for her to say.\u00a0<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cCan I be of any assistance? I\u2019m sure it must be exhausting to be here all day long, I feel as if you try to avoid me and your sister.\u201d He chuckled, and he was completely right. Anzia kept quiet as she continued to shelf the books. Things went quiet quickly, Jimin handing her books as she would climb the ladder to put them in their place. This went on for a few minutes. They made little attempt to have a conversation, enjoying the silence between them on this fine afternoon.\u00a0<br/></i></p><p><i>That was until with a yelp Anzia\u2019s foot was misplaced and she slipped down the ladder, hand trying to grip onto something. Jimin was quickly to move to her aid, catching her in his arms as her face was only centimeters from hers. Both releasing heavy breaths as they stared into each other\u2019s eyes. It felt like, love at first sight almost.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou caught me.\u201d Was all she managed to mutter out to break the tension and silence.\u00a0<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cI always will.\u201d He mumbled back before inviting himself to press his lips against her own. At first she was surprised\u00a0and taken away by his forwardness, soon finding herself tangling her fingers in his locks and her nails scraping his scalp as she craved more of him. Her lips pressing harder and parting more and more before she had to pull herself away with every bit of energy she had in her. She looked shocked, not by his actions but by her own.\u00a0<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cI apologise my Lord, you see it is not okay for us to be alone like this. I hide myself away to keep me from doing those such things as they are not allowed. You\u2019re marrying Katya and that\u2019s how it should be.\u201d Anzia tried to get away but Jimin grabbed her wrist before she could leave. He refused to let her leave, not without saying his piece himself first.\u00a0<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cI know what you mean&hellip;it\u2019s hard for me too because I feel the same about you. I just wish there was some way for us to change this but there isn\u2019t, but we can keep it a secret.\u201d\u00a0<br/></i></p><p>\u201cShe was always worried we\u2019d be caught, until she started enchanting the food. I wasn\u2019t aware of her powers at first, I just always thought they turned a blind eye until the night she finally revealed everything to me.\u201d Jimin explained, seeing your body grow weak again as he grabbed the bottle of water and gave you some more. You pulled back when you wanted to stop, some of it dripping off you and onto the floor.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stand around talking about this, tell me more about how I\u2019m supposed to use your grimoire first. Then I\u2019ll go on.\u201d You sighed, just when you thought you had gotten him talking and gotten his mind off the stupid book.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cOnly the witch who was given or created that grimoire can use it. Or&hellip;\u201d You paused, you didn\u2019t want to tell him. You knew he would do it if you did and honestly the last thing you needed was your soul back.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat? Tell me, please. Tell me and I\u2019ll finish the story and let you go.\u201d Jimin begged, you weren\u2019t fond of this idea, what if he didn\u2019t keep his word? Then again Jimin was always full of surprises. You agreed, sighing as you realised you were about to tell him how to get your soul back.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou can contact my soul and get me to do the spell that way and that\u2019ll create a portal for you to go to purgatory.\u201d You rolled your eyes, Jimin nodded. Agreeing to do it even though it was crazy.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re such a fucking idiot, don\u2019t you get it!? No one comes back from purgatory, not completely.\u201d You said through gritted teeth and Jimin heard your words and let them float right out the other ear.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNow finish your story. Why am I seeing your past love? How are you still alive? Where is Anzia now?\u201d You growled, Jimin sighed as he sat down. Hands clamped together as he continued his story.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cAnzia had a plan for me, I wasn\u2019t aware about it until she brought me to her chambers&hellip;\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p><i>\u201cWe have another choice, another way out of this. All you need to do&hellip;is trust me.\u201d Her hands caressed his face, his eyes sparkling as they stared straight into hers. <br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cI trust you.\u201d He breathed, she took his hand and led her to the deepest and darkest part of the dungeon. A circle of candles lit in the center\u00a0of the cell, a book, markings painted with what looked to be blood and a knife.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cAnzia, what\u2019s going on?\u201d He asked a little worried, why did she have this stuff and what was she planning on doing.\u00a0<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cCome sit.\u201d She led him to the circle, sitting down with him across from her. She began to read out an inscription from her grimoire. Her hands reached out, grabbing Jimin\u2019s as she closed her eyes, focusing on using her energy.\u00a0<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cP\u00e5 denne d\u00f8delige nat giver lyset fra m\u00e5nen, m\u00f8rket fra graven og blodet fra de d\u00f8de et nyt liv til en sj\u00e6l.\u201c Jimin didn\u2019t know what she was saying but her voice was deep and she spoke fast, her hands disconnected as they reached down and pressed against her grimoire. And it was as if something in her snapped, her eyes shooting open and revealing cloudy white ones with no orbs. Jimin was worried, calling her name out quickly before he was interrupted by her words.\u00a0<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cAccepter mit offer af dig selv og bring evigheden til en anden sj\u00e6l!\u201c He watched as Anzia picked up the dagger, both hands gripping it tightly as he watched her raised her arms.\u00a0<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cAnzia! Anzia!\u201d He screamed, but it was too late. The ritual had been completely, the dagger plunged all the way inside of her and blood seeping through her gown as she fell onto her side. Jimin rushed to her aid, shaking her before pulling her into his arms. Brushing the hair off her face as tears left his eyes.\u00a0<br/></i></p><p><i>\u201cNo! Anzia! Anzia!\u201d\u00a0<br/></i></p><p>You couldn\u2019t take your eyes off Jimin, seeing the hurt and pain on his face.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe spell she cast, was black magic. And it was an immortal spell, for me. All it took was a sacrifice, but not only did she curse me to live out eternity, she stored her powers in me. Making me a warlock. I left the castle that night, fleeing and continuing to live out a new life. The 1920\u2032s were swinging for a reason, that was the night I met Lisa. I could feel her energy from outside the club, she looked stunning. I had to see her. She taught me so much, brought me out of practicing any black magic.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>And that was it. That was the story of Anzia. Holding up his end of the deal, Jimin moved over to the chair, untying your wrists and letting you go. You stood up, gaining back your balance and feeling in your legs.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Jimin.\u201d You said as your eyes met his, and for a second he swore he felt you genuinely meant it. That was until you picked up the book end and hit it hard against his head, watching his body go limp as he fell to the floor. You put the object back down before turning on your heel and walking out the doors.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t like to play fair.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p>",

You watched with wicked eyes as he ran up the staircase, arms reaching\nout and captivating you. </i></p>[[MORE]]<p><i>He turned you in his arms, so you were now facing him, a\nsmile still present on both of your faces as you looked up to meet his eyes.\nHis piercing eyes, you had never seen such eyes before or such beauty. </i></p><p><i>\u201cMy Lord\u2026\u201d You breathed but didn\u2019t get to finish as he\npressed a finger to your lips softly, silencing you. Shaking his head as he muttered\na \u2018don\u2019t speak\u2019 and slowly leaned in. His lips getting closer and closer to\nyour own and you didn\u2019t take your eyes off his for a second. When his eyes\nbegan to close yours did too, a split second before his lips barely grazed your\nown. His bottom lip brushing over your top lip, your breath hitched in your\nthroat as you ached to just kiss him already. </i></p><p><i>When he finally pressed his lips to yours they were barely there\nfor a mere second before you pulled away at the sound of your lady in waiting\u2019s\nvoice as she came into your room. Her eyes were locked on the two of you, you\nslowly back away and out of Jimin\u2019s arms as he cleared his throat and straightened\nhimself out. </i></p><p><i>\u201cMy Lord was just leaving.\u201d You said, nodding your head as\nJimin took your sign and left. You wandered down the stairs after him and\ntowards your lady in waiting. She closed the doors after Jimin before turning to\nyou with a disappointed look and a sigh as she shook her head. \u201cWhat? So I was\nmessing around for a bit. I\u2019m allowed to play a little.\u201d You smirked as you\nturned to the mirror and looked at yourself as she began to prepare your gown\nfor tea. </i></p><p><i>\u201cM\u2019lady, do you think it is good for you to get close to him.\nAfter all he is very young and clearly filled with lust, playing with him will\nonly end in something bad for you both.\u201d You rolled your eyes with a small\nsmile on your face. </i></p><p><i>\u201cEmilia, do not fret. As my Lord will be handsomely rewarded\nand no hard shall come to him.\u201d You explained, taking in breathes each time she\ntightened your corset even more. </i></p><p><i>\u201cAnd the ritual?\u201d She asked, eyes meeting yours in the\nmirror. </i></p><p><i>\u201cAnd the ritual will not proceed, I will handle it.\u201d You\nsaid through gritted teeth before picking up the plush brush and powdering your\nnose softly. </i></p><p>Your eyes opened, slowly and barely at first. The light was blinding to your sore and weak eyes as they had been closed for a long time now. It was mid-day and you had been moved from the floor to a chair, your hands handcuffed behind it and your body tied to the chair.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFrig\u00f8re.\u201d you said, hoping that the rope would be removed, and the handcuffs would break but they failed to do so. You repeated the word over and over again. You looked around, why wasn\u2019t your magic working? You were saying the words but it\u2019s like your energy had been blocked. </p><p>\u201cTrust me it won\u2019t work. The cast I spell, try and see if you can recognize it. M\u00e5 lyst og loathe afbryde energi fra dig. That\u2019s right sweet heart, a little spell cast to put away your juice for a bit so I can really break you down.\u201d He said, walking closer to you so he was now right in your face. Taunting you. </p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t last much longer, and you know what else, neither will this body. Give up Jimin, because the old Y/N you knew\u2026she\u2019s not coming back.\u201d You spat before leaning back in your chair and looking away. You could feel how pale you were, you needed something to drink but you refused to give in. Jimin on the other hand is great at reading minds, he opened a bottle of water, holding it in front of your face. </p><p>You knew you needed it, and as much as you would love to just keep resisting you opened your lips and allowed him to give you water. You only got a quarter in when he pulled the bottle away. </p><p>\u201cNow, I want some answers. How do I get to purgatory?\u201d He demanded, you just chuckled, throwing your head back. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s funny. Do you also want to know if the Easter Bunny is real?\u201d You said with a smirk on your face. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not fucking around this time Y/N, I need to know. If you tell me I\u2019ll tell you\u2026about Anzia.\u201d This caught your interest. You wanted to know more about this girl, why she was so important to Jimin. Any way to find out about his weak spots you\u2019d gladly give away unhelpful information. </p><p>\u201cSo I tell you some measly information about a place that is impossible to even get to, and you\u2019ll tell me about this girl.\u201d You said, making sure he understood what he was getting himself into. </p><p>\u201cWell I guess it depends on how long you\u2019re awake for, I cursed your water with the same spell as before. So I\u2019d hurry if I were you, the clock is ticking.\u201d He clicked his tongue before flashing a smirk your way. </p><p>\u201cOkay! There\u2019s only one way to get there but even if you did there isn\u2019t any way of getting back. No soul ever returns to it\u2019s body once it lands in that place.\u201d You growled, Jimin continued to listen. \u201cYou need a witch.\u201d You stated as he nodded for you to go on. </p><p>\u201cYou need a white witch. And the process of getting there is crucial. You have to leave your body and go there, but if you\u2019re not back within seven hours\u2026you\u2019re dead.\u201d You said, slowly you can feel yourself starting to weaken. Feeling your veins protrude as the spell began taking its toll on you. </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a spell in my grimoire, it can help you. But you can only do it with a white witch, you need a witch with the spiritual connection to the other side and\u2014\u201d you paused, licking your lips as your body had really started to weaken now. Feeling your nose drip blood once again, Jimin wiping it away with his thumb. He knew the spell had started to weaken you, and that you wouldn\u2019t be able to say much more until you woke up again. \u00a0<br></p><p><i>\u201cAnzia, would you finish getting ready. Dinner is being served.\u201d You pushed Jimin away from you, fixing up your dress as it had been pulled to reveal your shoulder to Jimin for him to linger his lips on.\u00a0</i><br></p><p><i>\u201cYes mother, I\u2019ll be present within time.\u201d You said, trying not to make yourself sound as worked up as you were. When you finally fell into silence you turned to a smirking Jimin.\u00a0\u201cYou scoundrel! I was almost caught.\u201d You said, trying to fight back a smile as you threw a plush pillow at his laughing self. He moved back up to you, a smug grin on his face as he pressed his lips to yours but they did not stay.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou must attend to your guest downstairs. You shouldn\u2019t keep him waiting.\u201d You sighed, knowing that he was right. You hated that Jimin couldn\u2019t be the one chosen for you. But instead chosen to be betrothed to your sister.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cI will be seated downstairs in a short time, you must leave now to avoid suspicion though my love.\u201d You said, pushing him towards your door before pressing your lips to his one last time before he left. You sighed as you moved to your wardrobe, pulling a single lever and opening up the small space where you kept your herbs and such.\u00a0</i><br></p><p><i>\u201cI need to do it tonight, if he wants me to be with him forever.\u201d You said to yourself as you held the dagger in your hands and eyed the detailed iron. You put it away and quickly fixed yourself before going downstairs and taking your place at the table. To your fiance, which wasn\u2019t where you wanted to be. You wanted to be further up the table with Jimin and for your sister to be somewhere else.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>She didn\u2019t deserve Jimin, nor did she love Jimin as you did. You would do anything to be with him.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cAnzia and Harry plan to wed in just a couple of days, the whole kingdom is excited to be invited.\u201d Your mother boasted to the other women, distant cousins and aunts who have come to stay with you at the palace.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cYes well, who can blame them? Two soul mates, once at last together.\u201d Harry held your hand and raised it with his glass, waiting for you to do so. You felt your chest tighten and your eyes water at the thought of being stuck with him for the rest of your life. All for money and the throne.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cI don\u2019t seem to have a spoon for my soup, may you pass me your unused one Jimin?\u201d One of your ugly aunts asked, clearly eyeing him like he was a piece of meat. He handed it over to her and you watched as she leaned forward so he could see down her dress and her bosoms. You couldn\u2019t stand it, one minute she was shooting suggestive looks his way, the next she had fallen off her seat with half her face burnt off from the flame of the candle.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened, it\u2019s like it flared up in my face.\u201d Everyone went to her aid, all except Jimin who looked at you from his spot on the table. He didn\u2019t look happy though, he looked upset and angry that you would do such a thing. And he was. You stood up from the table and left, returning upstairs to your chambers where you wanted to be alone.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>Jimin followed you in right behind you, angry and furious.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cHow could you, she did nothing to anger you!\u201d Jimin growled as he slammed your doors shut.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cShe was acting like a harlot, throwing her treasures in your face like it was something you desired. It already hurts to see you with my sister! Do not make me a fool for seeing you with another woman.\u201d You growled, feeling Jimin was stepping out of line here.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cI do not make you a fool, you already make yourself a fool believing this can go on. Well it can\u2019t, I won\u2019t watch as you toy with everyone because of your gifts over jealousy. It disgusts me.\u201d You just wanted him. You just wanted something for you and you only for once. All your life you grew up giving and sharing with your sister and it was never fair. She always got what you wanted.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cAnzia, I am giving you a choice. Either we end this now or we go tell our families. I cannot hide it or explain my absences\u00a0to your sister no longer.\u201d You knew it was time, it had to be tonight.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cWe have another choice, another way out of this. All you need to do\u2026is trust me.\u201d Your hands caressed his face, his eyes sparkling as they stared straight into yours.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cI trust you.\u201d\u00a0<br></i></p><p>\u201cHow do I know that I can trust your word?\u201d Jimin asked as he gave you more water, you felt so exhausted at this point.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou really think I would lie? I\u2019ve been stuck in this chair for hours now. I\u2019m starving, I need to feel energy again. I can get you my grimoire but I can\u2019t just give it to you. Of course though, you already knew that so you had planned something else already.\u201d You said, eyeing Jimin as he paced back and forth.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI can give you answers, I know you\u2019ve been seeing her. In your visions, Anzia. My first love.\u201d You were confused, you thought they were dreams or something, hallucinations. Unwanted thoughts. You nodded for him to go on, hold up his end of the deal.\u00a0\u201cIt was 1242 and I was betrothed to Anzia\u2019s sister, but I knew that Anzia was who I really wanted to be with.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cMy eldest daughter, Katya. She is very beautiful and smart, she knows seven languages, she can read and write and is an astounding horse rider.\u201d Queen Livia boasted as she pointed to he eldest daughter and looked at her with envy. Jimin nodded, giving a small smile.\u00a0\u201cAnd my other daughter, who is currently running late.\u201d Anzia was just finishing getting ready, she knew she was late. She could hear them outside as they pulled up.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>She ran downstairs in a hurry, everyone\u2019s attention on her. Katya rolling her eyes and Livia looking at her daughter with disappointment.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cAnzia! Please remember your vowels!\u201d Her mother shouted as Anzia was quickly to go back to walking calmly and keeping posture as she went and stood next to her sister.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cMy Lord, please pardon my youngest daughter\u2019s actions as she isn\u2019t exactly as proper as a woman should be.\u201d Livia apologised, there was never a time she could be proud of Anzia. She always found a way to make Anzia feel like the black sheep of the family while Anzia watched her sister be loved and adored by her family while she stood aside.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cPlease, call me Jimin. My Lord is very formal and I don\u2019t want to have to feel as if your girls need to think of me as anything higher than them.\u201d His eyes met Anzia\u2019s and he knew. He knew he wanted to be with her, she held more mystery and fire in her eyes than any other maiden before him had. Anzia\u2019s sister noticed Jimin staring and decided to steal his attention back.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cMy Lord, shall we enjoy a stroll through the garden? the fountain has just recently been built in.\u201d Katya was beautiful, smart and yes the perfect daughter. But she was always so envious of how charming her little sister could be, she was also very jealous of the men who always were attracted to Anzia. She always saw her little sister as someone immature, childish and a fool as she always wore her heart on her sleeve and that\u2019s how she easily got herself hurt.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>While Katya and Jimin enjoyed the nice walk around the garden, Anzia sat in her room watching from her balcony. She wanted him. He was so beautiful, so captivating. She felt an urge inside her to have him. She too was jealous, and filled with anger of how disrespected she is in her family. As she clenched her fists the peach roses began to crisp and fade into a disgusting dead colour. Closing in on themselves and petals falling off.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Anzia hated how her elder sister always came first, always had what she wanted. It wasn\u2019t fair.\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cBut how did you and her end up together? I mean it obviously was no cake walk if you were betrothed to her sister.\u201d You said, some reason captivated by the story.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAnzia and I knew we had interest, of course at first we knew we should not act on our desires as we both had a role to play. She was very quiet and shy around me, but when I got her talking her laugh would fill my ears and her smile would light up the room like no other. She was absolutely beautiful in every way.\u201d Jimin went on, a small glint in his eye that really showed his love for Anzia.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhen did you first act?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p><i>\u201cDo not be alarmed m\u2019lady, tis just me.\u201d Jimin\u2019s presence made Anzia\u2019s heart race, she had been spending a lot of time hiding away from him. She felt that she might make a mistake or act on her desires if she were to be around him, just him. She was hiding away in this library, rearranging books to be where they belong.\u00a0</i><br></p><p><i>\u201cMy Lord, so kind of you to join me in the library. I thought you\u2019d be tending to my sister\u2019s needs.\u201d She said, bowing her head as he entered and she greeted him.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cPlease m\u2019lady, call me by my name. I feel as if we are too caught up in maturity and we should be fools when together.\u201d The words made her heart jump, she had just been dying to call him by his name. Practicing\u00a0how she would say his name in private.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cYes, Jimin.\u201d He smiled when his name rolled off her tongue, it was like the name was made for her to say.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cCan I be of any assistance? I\u2019m sure it must be exhausting to be here all day long, I feel as if you try to avoid me and your sister.\u201d He chuckled, and he was completely right. Anzia kept quiet as she continued to shelf the books. Things went quiet quickly, Jimin handing her books as she would climb the ladder to put them in their place. This went on for a few minutes. They made little attempt to have a conversation, enjoying the silence between them on this fine afternoon.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>That was until with a yelp Anzia\u2019s foot was misplaced and she slipped down the ladder, hand trying to grip onto something. Jimin was quickly to move to her aid, catching her in his arms as her face was only centimeters from hers. Both releasing heavy breaths as they stared into each other\u2019s eyes. It felt like, love at first sight almost.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou caught me.\u201d Was all she managed to mutter out to break the tension and silence.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cI always will.\u201d He mumbled back before inviting himself to press his lips against her own. At first she was surprised\u00a0and taken away by his forwardness, soon finding herself tangling her fingers in his locks and her nails scraping his scalp as she craved more of him. Her lips pressing harder and parting more and more before she had to pull herself away with every bit of energy she had in her. She looked shocked, not by his actions but by her own.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cI apologise my Lord, you see it is not okay for us to be alone like this. I hide myself away to keep me from doing those such things as they are not allowed. You\u2019re marrying Katya and that\u2019s how it should be.\u201d Anzia tried to get away but Jimin grabbed her wrist before she could leave. He refused to let her leave, not without saying his piece himself first.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cI know what you mean\u2026it\u2019s hard for me too because I feel the same about you. I just wish there was some way for us to change this but there isn\u2019t, but we can keep it a secret.\u201d\u00a0<br></i></p><p>\u201cShe was always worried we\u2019d be caught, until she started enchanting the food. I wasn\u2019t aware of her powers at first, I just always thought they turned a blind eye until the night she finally revealed everything to me.\u201d Jimin explained, seeing your body grow weak again as he grabbed the bottle of water and gave you some more. You pulled back when you wanted to stop, some of it dripping off you and onto the floor.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stand around talking about this, tell me more about how I\u2019m supposed to use your grimoire first. Then I\u2019ll go on.\u201d You sighed, just when you thought you had gotten him talking and gotten his mind off the stupid book.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOnly the witch who was given or created that grimoire can use it. Or\u2026\u201d You paused, you didn\u2019t want to tell him. You knew he would do it if you did and honestly the last thing you needed was your soul back.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhat? Tell me, please. Tell me and I\u2019ll finish the story and let you go.\u201d Jimin begged, you weren\u2019t fond of this idea, what if he didn\u2019t keep his word? Then again Jimin was always full of surprises. You agreed, sighing as you realised you were about to tell him how to get your soul back.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou can contact my soul and get me to do the spell that way and that\u2019ll create a portal for you to go to purgatory.\u201d You rolled your eyes, Jimin nodded. Agreeing to do it even though it was crazy.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re such a fucking idiot, don\u2019t you get it!? No one comes back from purgatory, not completely.\u201d You said through gritted teeth and Jimin heard your words and let them float right out the other ear.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNow finish your story. Why am I seeing your past love? How are you still alive? Where is Anzia now?\u201d You growled, Jimin sighed as he sat down. Hands clamped together as he continued his story.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAnzia had a plan for me, I wasn\u2019t aware about it until she brought me to her chambers\u2026\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p><i>\u201cWe have another choice, another way out of this. All you need to do\u2026is trust me.\u201d Her hands caressed his face, his eyes sparkling as they stared straight into hers. <br></i></p><p><i>\u201cI trust you.\u201d He breathed, she took his hand and led her to the deepest and darkest part of the dungeon. A circle of candles lit in the center\u00a0of the cell, a book, markings painted with what looked to be blood and a knife.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cAnzia, what\u2019s going on?\u201d He asked a little worried, why did she have this stuff and what was she planning on doing.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cCome sit.\u201d She led him to the circle, sitting down with him across from her. She began to read out an inscription from her grimoire. Her hands reached out, grabbing Jimin\u2019s as she closed her eyes, focusing on using her energy.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cP\u00e5 denne d\u00f8delige nat giver lyset fra m\u00e5nen, m\u00f8rket fra graven og blodet fra de d\u00f8de et nyt liv til en sj\u00e6l.\u201c Jimin didn\u2019t know what she was saying but her voice was deep and she spoke fast, her hands disconnected as they reached down and pressed against her grimoire. And it was as if something in her snapped, her eyes shooting open and revealing cloudy white ones with no orbs. Jimin was worried, calling her name out quickly before he was interrupted by her words.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cAccepter mit offer af dig selv og bring evigheden til en anden sj\u00e6l!\u201c He watched as Anzia picked up the dagger, both hands gripping it tightly as he watched her raised her arms.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cAnzia! Anzia!\u201d He screamed, but it was too late. The ritual had been completely, the dagger plunged all the way inside of her and blood seeping through her gown as she fell onto her side. Jimin rushed to her aid, shaking her before pulling her into his arms. Brushing the hair off her face as tears left his eyes.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cNo! Anzia! Anzia!\u201d\u00a0<br></i></p><p>You couldn\u2019t take your eyes off Jimin, seeing the hurt and pain on his face.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe spell she cast, was black magic. And it was an immortal spell, for me. All it took was a sacrifice, but not only did she curse me to live out eternity, she stored her powers in me. Making me a warlock. I left the castle that night, fleeing and continuing to live out a new life. The 1920\u2032s were swinging for a reason, that was the night I met Lisa. I could feel her energy from outside the club, she looked stunning. I had to see her. She taught me so much, brought me out of practicing any black magic.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>And that was it. That was the story of Anzia. Holding up his end of the deal, Jimin moved over to the chair, untying your wrists and letting you go. You stood up, gaining back your balance and feeling in your legs.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Jimin.\u201d You said as your eyes met his, and for a second he swore he felt you genuinely meant it. That was until you picked up the book end and hit it hard against his head, watching his body go limp as he fell to the floor. You put the object back down before turning on your heel and walking out the doors.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t like to play fair.\u201d\u00a0<br></p>",

Blood dried up under\nyour nose as your vision turned into darkness. </p><p><i>\u201cMy Lord! You must stop before we are caught.\u201d You giggled,\nlaughing as you ran around your room in a mere corset and linen pants. You were\nexposed to his indecent eyes, as a woman should never reveal her underwear to a\nman. But Jimin was just too greedy, so he snuck into your room to surprise you.\nYou ran up the stair case towards your small library, him following not far behind.\n</i></p><p><i>\u201cBut tis\u2019 fine if no one can catch us, for I must never take\nmy eyes off such beauty.\u201d His words made you blush at such provocative words that\nhe used. You watched with wicked eyes as he ran up the staircase, arms reaching\nout and captivating you. </i></p>[[MORE]]<p><i>He turned you in his arms, so you were now facing him, a\nsmile still present on both of your faces as you looked up to meet his eyes.\nHis piercing eyes, you had never seen such eyes before or such beauty. </i></p><p><i>\u201cMy Lord\u2026\u201d You breathed but didn\u2019t get to finish as he\npressed a finger to your lips softly, silencing you. Shaking his head as he muttered\na \u2018don\u2019t speak\u2019 and slowly leaned in. His lips getting closer and closer to\nyour own and you didn\u2019t take your eyes off his for a second. When his eyes\nbegan to close yours did too, a split second before his lips barely grazed your\nown. His bottom lip brushing over your top lip, your breath hitched in your\nthroat as you ached to just kiss him already. </i></p><p><i>When he finally pressed his lips to yours they were barely there\nfor a mere second before you pulled away at the sound of your lady in waiting\u2019s\nvoice as she came into your room. Her eyes were locked on the two of you, you\nslowly back away and out of Jimin\u2019s arms as he cleared his throat and straightened\nhimself out. </i></p><p><i>\u201cMy Lord was just leaving.\u201d You said, nodding your head as\nJimin took your sign and left. You wandered down the stairs after him and\ntowards your lady in waiting. She closed the doors after Jimin before turning to\nyou with a disappointed look and a sigh as she shook her head. \u201cWhat? So I was\nmessing around for a bit. I\u2019m allowed to play a little.\u201d You smirked as you\nturned to the mirror and looked at yourself as she began to prepare your gown\nfor tea. </i></p><p><i>\u201cM\u2019lady, do you think it is good for you to get close to him.\nAfter all he is very young and clearly filled with lust, playing with him will\nonly end in something bad for you both.\u201d You rolled your eyes with a small\nsmile on your face. </i></p><p><i>\u201cEmilia, do not fret. As my Lord will be handsomely rewarded\nand no hard shall come to him.\u201d You explained, taking in breathes each time she\ntightened your corset even more. </i></p><p><i>\u201cAnd the ritual?\u201d She asked, eyes meeting yours in the\nmirror. </i></p><p><i>\u201cAnd the ritual will not proceed, I will handle it.\u201d You\nsaid through gritted teeth before picking up the plush brush and powdering your\nnose softly. </i></p><p>Your eyes opened, slowly and barely at first. The light was blinding to your sore and weak eyes as they had been closed for a long time now. It was mid-day and you had been moved from the floor to a chair, your hands handcuffed behind it and your body tied to the chair.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFrig\u00f8re.\u201d you said, hoping that the rope would be removed, and the handcuffs would break but they failed to do so. You repeated the word over and over again. You looked around, why wasn\u2019t your magic working? You were saying the words but it\u2019s like your energy had been blocked. </p><p>\u201cTrust me it won\u2019t work. The cast I spell, try and see if you can recognize it. M\u00e5 lyst og loathe afbryde energi fra dig. That\u2019s right sweet heart, a little spell cast to put away your juice for a bit so I can really break you down.\u201d He said, walking closer to you so he was now right in your face. Taunting you. </p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t last much longer, and you know what else, neither will this body. Give up Jimin, because the old Y/N you knew\u2026she\u2019s not coming back.\u201d You spat before leaning back in your chair and looking away. You could feel how pale you were, you needed something to drink but you refused to give in. Jimin on the other hand is great at reading minds, he opened a bottle of water, holding it in front of your face. </p><p>You knew you needed it, and as much as you would love to just keep resisting you opened your lips and allowed him to give you water. You only got a quarter in when he pulled the bottle away. </p><p>\u201cNow, I want some answers. How do I get to purgatory?\u201d He demanded, you just chuckled, throwing your head back. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s funny. Do you also want to know if the Easter Bunny is real?\u201d You said with a smirk on your face. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not fucking around this time Y/N, I need to know. If you tell me I\u2019ll tell you\u2026about Anzia.\u201d This caught your interest. You wanted to know more about this girl, why she was so important to Jimin. Any way to find out about his weak spots you\u2019d gladly give away unhelpful information. </p><p>\u201cSo I tell you some measly information about a place that is impossible to even get to, and you\u2019ll tell me about this girl.\u201d You said, making sure he understood what he was getting himself into. </p><p>\u201cWell I guess it depends on how long you\u2019re awake for, I cursed your water with the same spell as before. So I\u2019d hurry if I were you, the clock is ticking.\u201d He clicked his tongue before flashing a smirk your way. </p><p>\u201cOkay! There\u2019s only one way to get there but even if you did there isn\u2019t any way of getting back. No soul ever returns to it\u2019s body once it lands in that place.\u201d You growled, Jimin continued to listen. \u201cYou need a witch.\u201d You stated as he nodded for you to go on. </p><p>\u201cYou need a white witch. And the process of getting there is crucial. You have to leave your body and go there, but if you\u2019re not back within seven hours\u2026you\u2019re dead.\u201d You said, slowly you can feel yourself starting to weaken. Feeling your veins protrude as the spell began taking its toll on you. </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a spell in my grimoire, it can help you. But you can only do it with a white witch, you need a witch with the spiritual connection to the other side and\u2014\u201d you paused, licking your lips as your body had really started to weaken now. Feeling your nose drip blood once again, Jimin wiping it away with his thumb. He knew the spell had started to weaken you, and that you wouldn\u2019t be able to say much more until you woke up again. \u00a0<br></p><p><i>\u201cAnzia, would you finish getting ready. Dinner is being served.\u201d You pushed Jimin away from you, fixing up your dress as it had been pulled to reveal your shoulder to Jimin for him to linger his lips on.\u00a0</i><br></p><p><i>\u201cYes mother, I\u2019ll be present within time.\u201d You said, trying not to make yourself sound as worked up as you were. When you finally fell into silence you turned to a smirking Jimin.\u00a0\u201cYou scoundrel! I was almost caught.\u201d You said, trying to fight back a smile as you threw a plush pillow at his laughing self. He moved back up to you, a smug grin on his face as he pressed his lips to yours but they did not stay.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou must attend to your guest downstairs. You shouldn\u2019t keep him waiting.\u201d You sighed, knowing that he was right. You hated that Jimin couldn\u2019t be the one chosen for you. But instead chosen to be betrothed to your sister.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cI will be seated downstairs in a short time, you must leave now to avoid suspicion though my love.\u201d You said, pushing him towards your door before pressing your lips to his one last time before he left. You sighed as you moved to your wardrobe, pulling a single lever and opening up the small space where you kept your herbs and such.\u00a0</i><br></p><p><i>\u201cI need to do it tonight, if he wants me to be with him forever.\u201d You said to yourself as you held the dagger in your hands and eyed the detailed iron. You put it away and quickly fixed yourself before going downstairs and taking your place at the table. To your fiance, which wasn\u2019t where you wanted to be. You wanted to be further up the table with Jimin and for your sister to be somewhere else.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>She didn\u2019t deserve Jimin, nor did she love Jimin as you did. You would do anything to be with him.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cAnzia and Harry plan to wed in just a couple of days, the whole kingdom is excited to be invited.\u201d Your mother boasted to the other women, distant cousins and aunts who have come to stay with you at the palace.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cYes well, who can blame them? Two soul mates, once at last together.\u201d Harry held your hand and raised it with his glass, waiting for you to do so. You felt your chest tighten and your eyes water at the thought of being stuck with him for the rest of your life. All for money and the throne.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cI don\u2019t seem to have a spoon for my soup, may you pass me your unused one Jimin?\u201d One of your ugly aunts asked, clearly eyeing him like he was a piece of meat. He handed it over to her and you watched as she leaned forward so he could see down her dress and her bosoms. You couldn\u2019t stand it, one minute she was shooting suggestive looks his way, the next she had fallen off her seat with half her face burnt off from the flame of the candle.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened, it\u2019s like it flared up in my face.\u201d Everyone went to her aid, all except Jimin who looked at you from his spot on the table. He didn\u2019t look happy though, he looked upset and angry that you would do such a thing. And he was. You stood up from the table and left, returning upstairs to your chambers where you wanted to be alone.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>Jimin followed you in right behind you, angry and furious.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cHow could you, she did nothing to anger you!\u201d Jimin growled as he slammed your doors shut.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cShe was acting like a harlot, throwing her treasures in your face like it was something you desired. It already hurts to see you with my sister! Do not make me a fool for seeing you with another woman.\u201d You growled, feeling Jimin was stepping out of line here.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cI do not make you a fool, you already make yourself a fool believing this can go on. Well it can\u2019t, I won\u2019t watch as you toy with everyone because of your gifts over jealousy. It disgusts me.\u201d You just wanted him. You just wanted something for you and you only for once. All your life you grew up giving and sharing with your sister and it was never fair. She always got what you wanted.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cAnzia, I am giving you a choice. Either we end this now or we go tell our families. I cannot hide it or explain my absences\u00a0to your sister no longer.\u201d You knew it was time, it had to be tonight.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cWe have another choice, another way out of this. All you need to do\u2026is trust me.\u201d Your hands caressed his face, his eyes sparkling as they stared straight into yours.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cI trust you.\u201d\u00a0<br></i></p><p>\u201cHow do I know that I can trust your word?\u201d Jimin asked as he gave you more water, you felt so exhausted at this point.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou really think I would lie? I\u2019ve been stuck in this chair for hours now. I\u2019m starving, I need to feel energy again. I can get you my grimoire but I can\u2019t just give it to you. Of course though, you already knew that so you had planned something else already.\u201d You said, eyeing Jimin as he paced back and forth.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI can give you answers, I know you\u2019ve been seeing her. In your visions, Anzia. My first love.\u201d You were confused, you thought they were dreams or something, hallucinations. Unwanted thoughts. You nodded for him to go on, hold up his end of the deal.\u00a0\u201cIt was 1242 and I was betrothed to Anzia\u2019s sister, but I knew that Anzia was who I really wanted to be with.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cMy eldest daughter, Katya. She is very beautiful and smart, she knows seven languages, she can read and write and is an astounding horse rider.\u201d Queen Livia boasted as she pointed to he eldest daughter and looked at her with envy. Jimin nodded, giving a small smile.\u00a0\u201cAnd my other daughter, who is currently running late.\u201d Anzia was just finishing getting ready, she knew she was late. She could hear them outside as they pulled up.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>She ran downstairs in a hurry, everyone\u2019s attention on her. Katya rolling her eyes and Livia looking at her daughter with disappointment.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cAnzia! Please remember your vowels!\u201d Her mother shouted as Anzia was quickly to go back to walking calmly and keeping posture as she went and stood next to her sister.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cMy Lord, please pardon my youngest daughter\u2019s actions as she isn\u2019t exactly as proper as a woman should be.\u201d Livia apologised, there was never a time she could be proud of Anzia. She always found a way to make Anzia feel like the black sheep of the family while Anzia watched her sister be loved and adored by her family while she stood aside.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cPlease, call me Jimin. My Lord is very formal and I don\u2019t want to have to feel as if your girls need to think of me as anything higher than them.\u201d His eyes met Anzia\u2019s and he knew. He knew he wanted to be with her, she held more mystery and fire in her eyes than any other maiden before him had. Anzia\u2019s sister noticed Jimin staring and decided to steal his attention back.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cMy Lord, shall we enjoy a stroll through the garden? the fountain has just recently been built in.\u201d Katya was beautiful, smart and yes the perfect daughter. But she was always so envious of how charming her little sister could be, she was also very jealous of the men who always were attracted to Anzia. She always saw her little sister as someone immature, childish and a fool as she always wore her heart on her sleeve and that\u2019s how she easily got herself hurt.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>While Katya and Jimin enjoyed the nice walk around the garden, Anzia sat in her room watching from her balcony. She wanted him. He was so beautiful, so captivating. She felt an urge inside her to have him. She too was jealous, and filled with anger of how disrespected she is in her family. As she clenched her fists the peach roses began to crisp and fade into a disgusting dead colour. Closing in on themselves and petals falling off.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Anzia hated how her elder sister always came first, always had what she wanted. It wasn\u2019t fair.\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cBut how did you and her end up together? I mean it obviously was no cake walk if you were betrothed to her sister.\u201d You said, some reason captivated by the story.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAnzia and I knew we had interest, of course at first we knew we should not act on our desires as we both had a role to play. She was very quiet and shy around me, but when I got her talking her laugh would fill my ears and her smile would light up the room like no other. She was absolutely beautiful in every way.\u201d Jimin went on, a small glint in his eye that really showed his love for Anzia.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhen did you first act?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p><i>\u201cDo not be alarmed m\u2019lady, tis just me.\u201d Jimin\u2019s presence made Anzia\u2019s heart race, she had been spending a lot of time hiding away from him. She felt that she might make a mistake or act on her desires if she were to be around him, just him. She was hiding away in this library, rearranging books to be where they belong.\u00a0</i><br></p><p><i>\u201cMy Lord, so kind of you to join me in the library. I thought you\u2019d be tending to my sister\u2019s needs.\u201d She said, bowing her head as he entered and she greeted him.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cPlease m\u2019lady, call me by my name. I feel as if we are too caught up in maturity and we should be fools when together.\u201d The words made her heart jump, she had just been dying to call him by his name. Practicing\u00a0how she would say his name in private.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cYes, Jimin.\u201d He smiled when his name rolled off her tongue, it was like the name was made for her to say.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cCan I be of any assistance? I\u2019m sure it must be exhausting to be here all day long, I feel as if you try to avoid me and your sister.\u201d He chuckled, and he was completely right. Anzia kept quiet as she continued to shelf the books. Things went quiet quickly, Jimin handing her books as she would climb the ladder to put them in their place. This went on for a few minutes. They made little attempt to have a conversation, enjoying the silence between them on this fine afternoon.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>That was until with a yelp Anzia\u2019s foot was misplaced and she slipped down the ladder, hand trying to grip onto something. Jimin was quickly to move to her aid, catching her in his arms as her face was only centimeters from hers. Both releasing heavy breaths as they stared into each other\u2019s eyes. It felt like, love at first sight almost.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou caught me.\u201d Was all she managed to mutter out to break the tension and silence.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cI always will.\u201d He mumbled back before inviting himself to press his lips against her own. At first she was surprised\u00a0and taken away by his forwardness, soon finding herself tangling her fingers in his locks and her nails scraping his scalp as she craved more of him. Her lips pressing harder and parting more and more before she had to pull herself away with every bit of energy she had in her. She looked shocked, not by his actions but by her own.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cI apologise my Lord, you see it is not okay for us to be alone like this. I hide myself away to keep me from doing those such things as they are not allowed. You\u2019re marrying Katya and that\u2019s how it should be.\u201d Anzia tried to get away but Jimin grabbed her wrist before she could leave. He refused to let her leave, not without saying his piece himself first.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cI know what you mean\u2026it\u2019s hard for me too because I feel the same about you. I just wish there was some way for us to change this but there isn\u2019t, but we can keep it a secret.\u201d\u00a0<br></i></p><p>\u201cShe was always worried we\u2019d be caught, until she started enchanting the food. I wasn\u2019t aware of her powers at first, I just always thought they turned a blind eye until the night she finally revealed everything to me.\u201d Jimin explained, seeing your body grow weak again as he grabbed the bottle of water and gave you some more. You pulled back when you wanted to stop, some of it dripping off you and onto the floor.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stand around talking about this, tell me more about how I\u2019m supposed to use your grimoire first. Then I\u2019ll go on.\u201d You sighed, just when you thought you had gotten him talking and gotten his mind off the stupid book.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOnly the witch who was given or created that grimoire can use it. Or\u2026\u201d You paused, you didn\u2019t want to tell him. You knew he would do it if you did and honestly the last thing you needed was your soul back.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhat? Tell me, please. Tell me and I\u2019ll finish the story and let you go.\u201d Jimin begged, you weren\u2019t fond of this idea, what if he didn\u2019t keep his word? Then again Jimin was always full of surprises. You agreed, sighing as you realised you were about to tell him how to get your soul back.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou can contact my soul and get me to do the spell that way and that\u2019ll create a portal for you to go to purgatory.\u201d You rolled your eyes, Jimin nodded. Agreeing to do it even though it was crazy.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re such a fucking idiot, don\u2019t you get it!? No one comes back from purgatory, not completely.\u201d You said through gritted teeth and Jimin heard your words and let them float right out the other ear.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNow finish your story. Why am I seeing your past love? How are you still alive? Where is Anzia now?\u201d You growled, Jimin sighed as he sat down. Hands clamped together as he continued his story.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAnzia had a plan for me, I wasn\u2019t aware about it until she brought me to her chambers\u2026\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p><i>\u201cWe have another choice, another way out of this. All you need to do\u2026is trust me.\u201d Her hands caressed his face, his eyes sparkling as they stared straight into hers. <br></i></p><p><i>\u201cI trust you.\u201d He breathed, she took his hand and led her to the deepest and darkest part of the dungeon. A circle of candles lit in the center\u00a0of the cell, a book, markings painted with what looked to be blood and a knife.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cAnzia, what\u2019s going on?\u201d He asked a little worried, why did she have this stuff and what was she planning on doing.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cCome sit.\u201d She led him to the circle, sitting down with him across from her. She began to read out an inscription from her grimoire. Her hands reached out, grabbing Jimin\u2019s as she closed her eyes, focusing on using her energy.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cP\u00e5 denne d\u00f8delige nat giver lyset fra m\u00e5nen, m\u00f8rket fra graven og blodet fra de d\u00f8de et nyt liv til en sj\u00e6l.\u201c Jimin didn\u2019t know what she was saying but her voice was deep and she spoke fast, her hands disconnected as they reached down and pressed against her grimoire. And it was as if something in her snapped, her eyes shooting open and revealing cloudy white ones with no orbs. Jimin was worried, calling her name out quickly before he was interrupted by her words.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cAccepter mit offer af dig selv og bring evigheden til en anden sj\u00e6l!\u201c He watched as Anzia picked up the dagger, both hands gripping it tightly as he watched her raised her arms.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cAnzia! Anzia!\u201d He screamed, but it was too late. The ritual had been completely, the dagger plunged all the way inside of her and blood seeping through her gown as she fell onto her side. Jimin rushed to her aid, shaking her before pulling her into his arms. Brushing the hair off her face as tears left his eyes.\u00a0<br></i></p><p><i>\u201cNo! Anzia! Anzia!\u201d\u00a0<br></i></p><p>You couldn\u2019t take your eyes off Jimin, seeing the hurt and pain on his face.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe spell she cast, was black magic. And it was an immortal spell, for me. All it took was a sacrifice, but not only did she curse me to live out eternity, she stored her powers in me. Making me a warlock. I left the castle that night, fleeing and continuing to live out a new life. The 1920\u2032s were swinging for a reason, that was the night I met Lisa. I could feel her energy from outside the club, she looked stunning. I had to see her. She taught me so much, brought me out of practicing any black magic.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>And that was it. That was the story of Anzia. Holding up his end of the deal, Jimin moved over to the chair, untying your wrists and letting you go. You stood up, gaining back your balance and feeling in your legs.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Jimin.\u201d You said as your eyes met his, and for a second he swore he felt you genuinely meant it. That was until you picked up the book end and hit it hard against his head, watching his body go limp as he fell to the floor. You put the object back down before turning on your heel and walking out the doors.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t like to play fair.\u201d\u00a0<br></p>",

Blood dried up under\nyour nose as your vision turned into darkness. </p><p><i>&ldquo;My Lord! You must stop before we are caught.&rdquo; You giggled,\nlaughing as you ran around your room in a mere corset and linen pants. You were\nexposed to his indecent eyes, as a woman should never reveal her underwear to a\nman. But Jimin was just too greedy, so he snuck into your room to surprise you.\nYou ran up the stair case towards your small library, him following not far behind.\n</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;But tis&rsquo; fine if no one can catch us, for I must never take\nmy eyes off such beauty.&rdquo; His words made you blush at such provocative words that\nhe used. You watched with wicked eyes as he ran up the staircase, arms reaching\nout and captivating you. </i></p><p><i>He turned you in his arms, so you were now facing him, a\nsmile still present on both of your faces as you looked up to meet his eyes.\nHis piercing eyes, you had never seen such eyes before or such beauty. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;My Lord&hellip;&rdquo; You breathed but didn&rsquo;t get to finish as he\npressed a finger to your lips softly, silencing you. Shaking his head as he muttered\na &lsquo;don&rsquo;t speak&rsquo; and slowly leaned in. His lips getting closer and closer to\nyour own and you didn&rsquo;t take your eyes off his for a second. When his eyes\nbegan to close yours did too, a split second before his lips barely grazed your\nown. His bottom lip brushing over your top lip, your breath hitched in your\nthroat as you ached to just kiss him already. </i></p><p><i>When he finally pressed his lips to yours they were barely there\nfor a mere second before you pulled away at the sound of your lady in waiting&rsquo;s\nvoice as she came into your room. Her eyes were locked on the two of you, you\nslowly back away and out of Jimin&rsquo;s arms as he cleared his throat and straightened\nhimself out. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;My Lord was just leaving.&rdquo; You said, nodding your head as\nJimin took your sign and left. You wandered down the stairs after him and\ntowards your lady in waiting. She closed the doors after Jimin before turning to\nyou with a disappointed look and a sigh as she shook her head. &ldquo;What? So I was\nmessing around for a bit. I&rsquo;m allowed to play a little.&rdquo; You smirked as you\nturned to the mirror and looked at yourself as she began to prepare your gown\nfor tea. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;M&rsquo;lady, do you think it is good for you to get close to him.\nAfter all he is very young and clearly filled with lust, playing with him will\nonly end in something bad for you both.&rdquo; You rolled your eyes with a small\nsmile on your face. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Emilia, do not fret. As my Lord will be handsomely rewarded\nand no hard shall come to him.&rdquo; You explained, taking in breathes each time she\ntightened your corset even more. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;And the ritual?&rdquo; She asked, eyes meeting yours in the\nmirror. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;And the ritual will not proceed, I will handle it.&rdquo; You\nsaid through gritted teeth before picking up the plush brush and powdering your\nnose softly. </i></p><p>Your eyes opened, slowly and barely at first. The light was blinding to your sore and weak eyes as they had been closed for a long time now. It was mid-day and you had been moved from the floor to a chair, your hands handcuffed behind it and your body tied to the chair.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Frig&oslash;re.&rdquo; you said, hoping that the rope would be removed, and the handcuffs would break but they failed to do so. You repeated the word over and over again. You looked around, why wasn&rsquo;t your magic working? You were saying the words but it&rsquo;s like your energy had been blocked. </p><p>&ldquo;Trust me it won&rsquo;t work. The cast I spell, try and see if you can recognize it. M&aring; lyst og loathe afbryde energi fra dig. That&rsquo;s right sweet heart, a little spell cast to put away your juice for a bit so I can really break you down.&rdquo; He said, walking closer to you so he was now right in your face. Taunting you. </p><p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t last much longer, and you know what else, neither will this body. Give up Jimin, because the old Y/N you knew&hellip;she&rsquo;s not coming back.&rdquo; You spat before leaning back in your chair and looking away. You could feel how pale you were, you needed something to drink but you refused to give in. Jimin on the other hand is great at reading minds, he opened a bottle of water, holding it in front of your face. </p><p>You knew you needed it, and as much as you would love to just keep resisting you opened your lips and allowed him to give you water. You only got a quarter in when he pulled the bottle away. </p><p>&ldquo;Now, I want some answers. How do I get to purgatory?&rdquo; He demanded, you just chuckled, throwing your head back. </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s funny. Do you also want to know if the Easter Bunny is real?&rdquo; You said with a smirk on your face. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not fucking around this time Y/N, I need to know. If you tell me I&rsquo;ll tell you&hellip;about Anzia.&rdquo; This caught your interest. You wanted to know more about this girl, why she was so important to Jimin. Any way to find out about his weak spots you&rsquo;d gladly give away unhelpful information. </p><p>&ldquo;So I tell you some measly information about a place that is impossible to even get to, and you&rsquo;ll tell me about this girl.&rdquo; You said, making sure he understood what he was getting himself into. </p><p>&ldquo;Well I guess it depends on how long you&rsquo;re awake for, I cursed your water with the same spell as before. So I&rsquo;d hurry if I were you, the clock is ticking.&rdquo; He clicked his tongue before flashing a smirk your way. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay! There&rsquo;s only one way to get there but even if you did there isn&rsquo;t any way of getting back. No soul ever returns to it&rsquo;s body once it lands in that place.&rdquo; You growled, Jimin continued to listen. &ldquo;You need a witch.&rdquo; You stated as he nodded for you to go on. </p><p>&ldquo;You need a white witch. And the process of getting there is crucial. You have to leave your body and go there, but if you&rsquo;re not back within seven hours&hellip;you&rsquo;re dead.&rdquo; You said, slowly you can feel yourself starting to weaken. Feeling your veins protrude as the spell began taking its toll on you. </p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a spell in my grimoire, it can help you. But you can only do it with a white witch, you need a witch with the spiritual connection to the other side and&mdash;&rdquo; you paused, licking your lips as your body had really started to weaken now. Feeling your nose drip blood once again, Jimin wiping it away with his thumb. He knew the spell had started to weaken you, and that you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to say much more until you woke up again. &nbsp;<br /></p><p><i>&ldquo;Anzia, would you finish getting ready. Dinner is being served.&rdquo; You pushed Jimin away from you, fixing up your dress as it had been pulled to reveal your shoulder to Jimin for him to linger his lips on.&nbsp;</i><br /></p><p><i>&ldquo;Yes mother, I&rsquo;ll be present within time.&rdquo; You said, trying not to make yourself sound as worked up as you were. When you finally fell into silence you turned to a smirking Jimin.&nbsp;&ldquo;You scoundrel! I was almost caught.&rdquo; You said, trying to fight back a smile as you threw a plush pillow at his laughing self. He moved back up to you, a smug grin on his face as he pressed his lips to yours but they did not stay.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You must attend to your guest downstairs. You shouldn&rsquo;t keep him waiting.&rdquo; You sighed, knowing that he was right. You hated that Jimin couldn&rsquo;t be the one chosen for you. But instead chosen to be betrothed to your sister.&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I will be seated downstairs in a short time, you must leave now to avoid suspicion though my love.&rdquo; You said, pushing him towards your door before pressing your lips to his one last time before he left. You sighed as you moved to your wardrobe, pulling a single lever and opening up the small space where you kept your herbs and such.&nbsp;</i><br /></p><p><i>&ldquo;I need to do it tonight, if he wants me to be with him forever.&rdquo; You said to yourself as you held the dagger in your hands and eyed the detailed iron. You put it away and quickly fixed yourself before going downstairs and taking your place at the table. To your fiance, which wasn&rsquo;t where you wanted to be. You wanted to be further up the table with Jimin and for your sister to be somewhere else.&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p><i>She didn&rsquo;t deserve Jimin, nor did she love Jimin as you did. You would do anything to be with him.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Anzia and Harry plan to wed in just a couple of days, the whole kingdom is excited to be invited.&rdquo; Your mother boasted to the other women, distant cousins and aunts who have come to stay with you at the palace.&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Yes well, who can blame them? Two soul mates, once at last together.&rdquo; Harry held your hand and raised it with his glass, waiting for you to do so. You felt your chest tighten and your eyes water at the thought of being stuck with him for the rest of your life. All for money and the throne.&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t seem to have a spoon for my soup, may you pass me your unused one Jimin?&rdquo; One of your ugly aunts asked, clearly eyeing him like he was a piece of meat. He handed it over to her and you watched as she leaned forward so he could see down her dress and her bosoms. You couldn&rsquo;t stand it, one minute she was shooting suggestive looks his way, the next she had fallen off her seat with half her face burnt off from the flame of the candle.&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what happened, it&rsquo;s like it flared up in my face.&rdquo; Everyone went to her aid, all except Jimin who looked at you from his spot on the table. He didn&rsquo;t look happy though, he looked upset and angry that you would do such a thing. And he was. You stood up from the table and left, returning upstairs to your chambers where you wanted to be alone.&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p><i>Jimin followed you in right behind you, angry and furious.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;How could you, she did nothing to anger you!&rdquo; Jimin growled as he slammed your doors shut.&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;She was acting like a harlot, throwing her treasures in your face like it was something you desired. It already hurts to see you with my sister! Do not make me a fool for seeing you with another woman.&rdquo; You growled, feeling Jimin was stepping out of line here.&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I do not make you a fool, you already make yourself a fool believing this can go on. Well it can&rsquo;t, I won&rsquo;t watch as you toy with everyone because of your gifts over jealousy. It disgusts me.&rdquo; You just wanted him. You just wanted something for you and you only for once. All your life you grew up giving and sharing with your sister and it was never fair. She always got what you wanted.&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Anzia, I am giving you a choice. Either we end this now or we go tell our families. I cannot hide it or explain my absences&nbsp;to your sister no longer.&rdquo; You knew it was time, it had to be tonight.&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;We have another choice, another way out of this. All you need to do&hellip;is trust me.&rdquo; Your hands caressed his face, his eyes sparkling as they stared straight into yours.&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I trust you.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p>&ldquo;How do I know that I can trust your word?&rdquo; Jimin asked as he gave you more water, you felt so exhausted at this point.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You really think I would lie? I&rsquo;ve been stuck in this chair for hours now. I&rsquo;m starving, I need to feel energy again. I can get you my grimoire but I can&rsquo;t just give it to you. Of course though, you already knew that so you had planned something else already.&rdquo; You said, eyeing Jimin as he paced back and forth.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I can give you answers, I know you&rsquo;ve been seeing her. In your visions, Anzia. My first love.&rdquo; You were confused, you thought they were dreams or something, hallucinations. Unwanted thoughts. You nodded for him to go on, hold up his end of the deal.&nbsp;&ldquo;It was 1242 and I was betrothed to Anzia&rsquo;s sister, but I knew that Anzia was who I really wanted to be with.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;My eldest daughter, Katya. She is very beautiful and smart, she knows seven languages, she can read and write and is an astounding horse rider.&rdquo; Queen Livia boasted as she pointed to he eldest daughter and looked at her with envy. Jimin nodded, giving a small smile.&nbsp;&ldquo;And my other daughter, who is currently running late.&rdquo; Anzia was just finishing getting ready, she knew she was late. She could hear them outside as they pulled up.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>She ran downstairs in a hurry, everyone&rsquo;s attention on her. Katya rolling her eyes and Livia looking at her daughter with disappointment.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Anzia! Please remember your vowels!&rdquo; Her mother shouted as Anzia was quickly to go back to walking calmly and keeping posture as she went and stood next to her sister.&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;My Lord, please pardon my youngest daughter&rsquo;s actions as she isn&rsquo;t exactly as proper as a woman should be.&rdquo; Livia apologised, there was never a time she could be proud of Anzia. She always found a way to make Anzia feel like the black sheep of the family while Anzia watched her sister be loved and adored by her family while she stood aside.&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Please, call me Jimin. My Lord is very formal and I don&rsquo;t want to have to feel as if your girls need to think of me as anything higher than them.&rdquo; His eyes met Anzia&rsquo;s and he knew. He knew he wanted to be with her, she held more mystery and fire in her eyes than any other maiden before him had. Anzia&rsquo;s sister noticed Jimin staring and decided to steal his attention back.&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;My Lord, shall we enjoy a stroll through the garden? the fountain has just recently been built in.&rdquo; Katya was beautiful, smart and yes the perfect daughter. But she was always so envious of how charming her little sister could be, she was also very jealous of the men who always were attracted to Anzia. She always saw her little sister as someone immature, childish and a fool as she always wore her heart on her sleeve and that&rsquo;s how she easily got herself hurt.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>While Katya and Jimin enjoyed the nice walk around the garden, Anzia sat in her room watching from her balcony. She wanted him. He was so beautiful, so captivating. She felt an urge inside her to have him. She too was jealous, and filled with anger of how disrespected she is in her family. As she clenched her fists the peach roses began to crisp and fade into a disgusting dead colour. Closing in on themselves and petals falling off.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Anzia hated how her elder sister always came first, always had what she wanted. It wasn&rsquo;t fair.&nbsp;</i></p><p>&ldquo;But how did you and her end up together? I mean it obviously was no cake walk if you were betrothed to her sister.&rdquo; You said, some reason captivated by the story.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Anzia and I knew we had interest, of course at first we knew we should not act on our desires as we both had a role to play. She was very quiet and shy around me, but when I got her talking her laugh would fill my ears and her smile would light up the room like no other. She was absolutely beautiful in every way.&rdquo; Jimin went on, a small glint in his eye that really showed his love for Anzia.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;When did you first act?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p><i>&ldquo;Do not be alarmed m&rsquo;lady, tis just me.&rdquo; Jimin&rsquo;s presence made Anzia&rsquo;s heart race, she had been spending a lot of time hiding away from him. She felt that she might make a mistake or act on her desires if she were to be around him, just him. She was hiding away in this library, rearranging books to be where they belong.&nbsp;</i><br /></p><p><i>&ldquo;My Lord, so kind of you to join me in the library. I thought you&rsquo;d be tending to my sister&rsquo;s needs.&rdquo; She said, bowing her head as he entered and she greeted him.&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Please m&rsquo;lady, call me by my name. I feel as if we are too caught up in maturity and we should be fools when together.&rdquo; The words made her heart jump, she had just been dying to call him by his name. Practicing&nbsp;how she would say his name in private.&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Yes, Jimin.&rdquo; He smiled when his name rolled off her tongue, it was like the name was made for her to say.&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Can I be of any assistance? I&rsquo;m sure it must be exhausting to be here all day long, I feel as if you try to avoid me and your sister.&rdquo; He chuckled, and he was completely right. Anzia kept quiet as she continued to shelf the books. Things went quiet quickly, Jimin handing her books as she would climb the ladder to put them in their place. This went on for a few minutes. They made little attempt to have a conversation, enjoying the silence between them on this fine afternoon.&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p><i>That was until with a yelp Anzia&rsquo;s foot was misplaced and she slipped down the ladder, hand trying to grip onto something. Jimin was quickly to move to her aid, catching her in his arms as her face was only centimeters from hers. Both releasing heavy breaths as they stared into each other&rsquo;s eyes. It felt like, love at first sight almost.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You caught me.&rdquo; Was all she managed to mutter out to break the tension and silence.&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I always will.&rdquo; He mumbled back before inviting himself to press his lips against her own. At first she was surprised&nbsp;and taken away by his forwardness, soon finding herself tangling her fingers in his locks and her nails scraping his scalp as she craved more of him. Her lips pressing harder and parting more and more before she had to pull herself away with every bit of energy she had in her. She looked shocked, not by his actions but by her own.&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I apologise my Lord, you see it is not okay for us to be alone like this. I hide myself away to keep me from doing those such things as they are not allowed. You&rsquo;re marrying Katya and that&rsquo;s how it should be.&rdquo; Anzia tried to get away but Jimin grabbed her wrist before she could leave. He refused to let her leave, not without saying his piece himself first.&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I know what you mean&hellip;it&rsquo;s hard for me too because I feel the same about you. I just wish there was some way for us to change this but there isn&rsquo;t, but we can keep it a secret.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p>&ldquo;She was always worried we&rsquo;d be caught, until she started enchanting the food. I wasn&rsquo;t aware of her powers at first, I just always thought they turned a blind eye until the night she finally revealed everything to me.&rdquo; Jimin explained, seeing your body grow weak again as he grabbed the bottle of water and gave you some more. You pulled back when you wanted to stop, some of it dripping off you and onto the floor.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand around talking about this, tell me more about how I&rsquo;m supposed to use your grimoire first. Then I&rsquo;ll go on.&rdquo; You sighed, just when you thought you had gotten him talking and gotten his mind off the stupid book.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Only the witch who was given or created that grimoire can use it. Or&hellip;&rdquo; You paused, you didn&rsquo;t want to tell him. You knew he would do it if you did and honestly the last thing you needed was your soul back.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What? Tell me, please. Tell me and I&rsquo;ll finish the story and let you go.&rdquo; Jimin begged, you weren&rsquo;t fond of this idea, what if he didn&rsquo;t keep his word? Then again Jimin was always full of surprises. You agreed, sighing as you realised you were about to tell him how to get your soul back.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You can contact my soul and get me to do the spell that way and that&rsquo;ll create a portal for you to go to purgatory.&rdquo; You rolled your eyes, Jimin nodded. Agreeing to do it even though it was crazy.&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re such a fucking idiot, don&rsquo;t you get it!? No one comes back from purgatory, not completely.&rdquo; You said through gritted teeth and Jimin heard your words and let them float right out the other ear.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Now finish your story. Why am I seeing your past love? How are you still alive? Where is Anzia now?&rdquo; You growled, Jimin sighed as he sat down. Hands clamped together as he continued his story.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Anzia had a plan for me, I wasn&rsquo;t aware about it until she brought me to her chambers&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p><i>&ldquo;We have another choice, another way out of this. All you need to do&hellip;is trust me.&rdquo; Her hands caressed his face, his eyes sparkling as they stared straight into hers. <br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I trust you.&rdquo; He breathed, she took his hand and led her to the deepest and darkest part of the dungeon. A circle of candles lit in the center&nbsp;of the cell, a book, markings painted with what looked to be blood and a knife.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Anzia, what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; He asked a little worried, why did she have this stuff and what was she planning on doing.&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Come sit.&rdquo; She led him to the circle, sitting down with him across from her. She began to read out an inscription from her grimoire. Her hands reached out, grabbing Jimin&rsquo;s as she closed her eyes, focusing on using her energy.&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;P&aring; denne d&oslash;delige nat giver lyset fra m&aring;nen, m&oslash;rket fra graven og blodet fra de d&oslash;de et nyt liv til en sj&aelig;l.&ldquo; Jimin didn&rsquo;t know what she was saying but her voice was deep and she spoke fast, her hands disconnected as they reached down and pressed against her grimoire. And it was as if something in her snapped, her eyes shooting open and revealing cloudy white ones with no orbs. Jimin was worried, calling her name out quickly before he was interrupted by her words.&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Accepter mit offer af dig selv og bring evigheden til en anden sj&aelig;l!&ldquo; He watched as Anzia picked up the dagger, both hands gripping it tightly as he watched her raised her arms.&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Anzia! Anzia!&rdquo; He screamed, but it was too late. The ritual had been completely, the dagger plunged all the way inside of her and blood seeping through her gown as she fell onto her side. Jimin rushed to her aid, shaking her before pulling her into his arms. Brushing the hair off her face as tears left his eyes.&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;No! Anzia! Anzia!&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p>You couldn&rsquo;t take your eyes off Jimin, seeing the hurt and pain on his face.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;The spell she cast, was black magic. And it was an immortal spell, for me. All it took was a sacrifice, but not only did she curse me to live out eternity, she stored her powers in me. Making me a warlock. I left the castle that night, fleeing and continuing to live out a new life. The 1920&prime;s were swinging for a reason, that was the night I met Lisa. I could feel her energy from outside the club, she looked stunning. I had to see her. She taught me so much, brought me out of practicing any black magic.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>And that was it. That was the story of Anzia. Holding up his end of the deal, Jimin moved over to the chair, untying your wrists and letting you go. You stood up, gaining back your balance and feeling in your legs.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Jimin.&rdquo; You said as your eyes met his, and for a second he swore he felt you genuinely meant it. That was until you picked up the book end and hit it hard against his head, watching his body go limp as he fell to the floor. You put the object back down before turning on your heel and walking out the doors.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t like to play fair.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p>",

You felt the cold wind slowly kissing your exposed back as the windows of your room was left opened. The smell of antiseptic in your room meeting the unfamiliar smell of green grass outside, was probably one of the best thing you <i>owned</i> here.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good right?\u201d You gave her a smile. Nurse Kim has been taking care of you for the last 2 weeks. She probably knew you better than your mom who lives 4 stations away. The last thing you remembered before meeting her again, was collapsing in the bakery you are currently working in. </p><p>\u201cIs Seokjin\u00a0coming?\u201d her hands tied up your hair into a pony tail. You nodded as you adjust the hospital gown to cover your front chest down to your thigh. </p><p>\u201cHe texted me just now. I think he will be here any minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see him very often in the news, they are growing big,\u201d your lips formed another smile as you turned your head to see nurse Kim.</p><p><i>They sure are</i></p><!-- more --><p>Right after the conversation ended, you heard someone came into the room. </p><p>\u201cY/n! I\u2019M HERE-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYa! Why don\u2019t you tell me you are- na- na-\u201c Seokjin closed his eyes with his hand as you are basically half naked. The nurse laughed to his cute reaction and how red his cheeks were even though he tried so hard to also hide them behind his hand. </p><p>\u201cKnock the door, sir. I didn\u2019t hear any knocking just now.\u201d You chuckled at his silly reaction too.</p><p>\u201cCan you wait outside, love? I\u2019ll clean up and you can come in later.\u201d Seokjin nodded and turn around, leaving the room without saying anything. And everyone said he is 26.</p><p>Nurse Kim exited the room after telling you that she will be back after three hours for medication. You could hear Seokjin\u2019s and Nurse Kim\u2019s small talk from your room. It was not clear but you heard Seokjin\u2019s <i>thank you</i> in the end of the conversation.

You decided to turn on the TV to break the silence; it did not really help.</p><p>\u201cAre you bored?\u201d You asked him while eating your third piece of apple. </p><p>\u201cErm? No.\u201d He said short before taking another bite of a full apple. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you need to be here with me. But, please spend some time with the boys. I guess they-\u201c</p><p>\u201cWe have talked about this, Y/n.\u201d His eyes didn\u2019t shifted from the TV screen. You wanted him to have a life, not sitting in a boring hospital room 24/7, accompanying his sick girlfriend.</p><p>\u201cYou want to go outside?\u201d Seokjin suddenly asked; now his attention is on you. </p><p>\u201cBut it is raining.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He went outside and brought in a wheelchair, carried you from the bed and put you down slowly, he also carefully hung the IV on the metal stick provided.

I never did, I never do and I never will. But i do really miss <i>us</i>.\u201d That one last sentence was enough to break you down in tears.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jinnie.\u201d</p><p><i>Is this why he brought you outside? To hide his sadness, tears and pain? </i></p><p>You couldn\u2019t stand hearing his sad voice any further. You tried to stand and Seokjin\u2019s immediate reflex was to help you. You lost your balance right after standing and fell into his arms.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Seokjin a.\u201d You circled your arm around his waist, hiding your face on his oversized shirt.</p><p>You could also feel his arm tightening as a reply. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, y/n. You don\u2019t need to think about it.\u00a0I just-\u201c</p><p>\u201cHey, <i>shoo</i>, <i>shoo</i>, it\u2019s enough.\u201d</p><p>Funny how you could still feel his tears against your neck when it was raining at the same time. \u201cY/n, please get well soon, okay.\u201d</p><p>You still didn\u2019t answer him, afraid of making promise you won\u2019t be able to keep. </p><p>\u201cAnswer me, will you, love?\u201d</p><p>You loosen the hug, bringing both of your lips together. Short and assuring. It seems you too, miss <i>us</i>.</p><p>\u201cPlease, get well soon-\u201c </p><p>\u201cAnd until then, I\u2019ll wait.

You decided to turn on the TV to break the silence; it did not really help.</p><p>\u201cAre you bored?\u201d You asked him while eating your third piece of apple. </p><p>\u201cErm? No.\u201d He said short before taking another bite of a full apple. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you need to be here with me. But, please spend some time with the boys. I guess they-\u201c</p><p>\u201cWe have talked about this, Y/n.\u201d His eyes didn\u2019t shifted from the TV screen. You wanted him to have a life, not sitting in a boring hospital room 24/7, accompanying his sick girlfriend.</p><p>\u201cYou want to go outside?\u201d Seokjin suddenly asked; now his attention is on you. </p><p>\u201cBut it is raining.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He went outside and brought in a wheelchair, carried you from the bed and put you down slowly, he also carefully hung the IV on the metal stick provided. He pushed the wheelchair, one ward to another, until he reached the exit.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNurse Kim is gonne kill me, but I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>He pushed the wheelchair to the middle of the grass field which you could only see from your room a while ago. There you are, you and him, in the middle of the rain. </p><p>\u201cY/n.\u201d You could hear his voice shaking. </p><p>\u201cPlease-\u201c</p><p>\u201cPlease get well soon,\u201d you could just smile and give him no answer. </p><p>\u201cI am not bored. I never did, I never do and I never will. But i do really miss <i>us</i>.\u201d That one last sentence was enough to break you down in tears.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jinnie.\u201d</p><p><i>Is this why he brought you outside? To hide his sadness, tears and pain? </i></p><p>You couldn\u2019t stand hearing his sad voice any further. You tried to stand and Seokjin\u2019s immediate reflex was to help you. You lost your balance right after standing and fell into his arms.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Seokjin a.\u201d You circled your arm around his waist, hiding your face on his oversized shirt.</p><p>You could also feel his arm tightening as a reply. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, y/n. You don\u2019t need to think about it.\u00a0I just-\u201c</p><p>\u201cHey, <i>shoo</i>, <i>shoo</i>, it\u2019s enough.\u201d</p><p>Funny how you could still feel his tears against your neck when it was raining at the same time. \u201cY/n, please get well soon, okay.\u201d</p><p>You still didn\u2019t answer him, afraid of making promise you won\u2019t be able to keep. </p><p>\u201cAnswer me, will you, love?\u201d</p><p>You loosen the hug, bringing both of your lips together. Short and assuring. It seems you too, miss <i>us</i>.</p><p>\u201cPlease, get well soon-\u201c </p><p>\u201cAnd until then, I\u2019ll wait. Okay?\u201d</p><p>You see him on his eyes; and</p><p><i>smile </i>instead<i>; </i>seeing<i> us.\u00a0</i></p></p>",

You felt the cold wind slowly kissing your exposed back as the windows of your room was left opened. The smell of antiseptic in your room meeting the unfamiliar smell of green grass outside, was probably one of the best thing you <i>owned</i> here.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good right?&rdquo; You gave her a smile. Nurse Kim has been taking care of you for the last 2 weeks. She probably knew you better than your mom who lives 4 stations away. The last thing you remembered before meeting her again, was collapsing in the bakery you are currently working in. </p><p>&ldquo;Is Seokjin&nbsp;coming?&rdquo; her hands tied up your hair into a pony tail. You nodded as you adjust the hospital gown to cover your front chest down to your thigh. </p><p>&ldquo;He texted me just now. I think he will be here any minute.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I see him very often in the news, they are growing big,&rdquo; your lips formed another smile as you turned your head to see nurse Kim.</p><p><i>They sure are</i></p><p>Right after the conversation ended, you heard someone came into the room. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/n! I&rsquo;M HERE-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ya! Why don&rsquo;t you tell me you are- na- na-&ldquo; Seokjin closed his eyes with his hand as you are basically half naked. The nurse laughed to his cute reaction and how red his cheeks were even though he tried so hard to also hide them behind his hand. </p><p>&ldquo;Knock the door, sir. I didn&rsquo;t hear any knocking just now.&rdquo; You chuckled at his silly reaction too.</p><p>&ldquo;Can you wait outside, love? I&rsquo;ll clean up and you can come in later.&rdquo; Seokjin nodded and turn around, leaving the room without saying anything. And everyone said he is 26.</p><p>Nurse Kim exited the room after telling you that she will be back after three hours for medication. You could hear Seokjin&rsquo;s and Nurse Kim&rsquo;s small talk from your room. It was not clear but you heard Seokjin&rsquo;s <i>thank you</i> in the end of the conversation. Right after the <i>thank</i> <i>you</i>, you heard the squeaking sound of the door. </p><p>&ldquo;How are you today, princess?&rdquo; Seokjin walked towards you and left a kiss on your forehead, when his lips parted from your forehead you could see a sad smile formed on his lips; you know why. </p><p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s the fansign?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was good. Armies brought a lot of thing for you and many asked me where you are. You are stealing my spotlight, love.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your fault for making the relationship public. If we haven&rsquo;t gone public,&nbsp;people won&rsquo;t ask right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you are relieved, aren&rsquo;t you? You are really well accepted by them.&rdquo;</p><p>It was true. You are somehow shocked that you are accepted by many if not all armies out there. Their supports are also one of the reason you could keep on going. </p><p>&ldquo;Do you want to eat apple? I&rsquo;ll peel them.&rdquo; You nodded. Seokjin went to the sink and wash the knife before sitting next to you and peel the apples. There&rsquo;s a long silence between the two of you. </p><p>You paid close attention to his figure. How he was more than anything you could have ever wished for; <i>anyone</i> has ever wished for, and yet he chooses you. What does he have in that beautiful mind of his.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something in your mind?&rdquo;</p><p>His deep and sweet voice disturbed your attention and you shook you head. </p><p>&ldquo;Spit it out, love.&rdquo; You took a deep breath and sighed. He was peeling his second apple by that time.</p><p>&ldquo;You are beautiful, <i>oppa, </i>do you know that?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;That come out of no where?&rdquo; he chuckled. </p><p>&ldquo;It comes from my heart, silly.
