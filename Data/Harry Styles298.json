I felt much more pressured and aware of what I was putting in\nmy body and passing on to Nora. Albeit it was much, much easier when I didn\u2019t\nhave Harry two steps behind me reminding me that I couldn\u2019t eat whatever I set\nmy eyes on.</p><p>We always made our trips to the grocery store early in\nthe morning, when the aisles were dead and the only people lingering were the\nfew other early risers and the staff who looked like they wished they were\nstill at home in their warm beds. It made it easier so we weren\u2019t pictured by\nfans or any paparazzi. </p><!-- more --><p>My pregnancy was still a secret between us and our\nclosest friends and family. It was a surprise because I had been in the crowd at\nall of his European shows and there were a number of pictures being shared of\nme being there, curious as to why I was at so many shows and what was going on\nbetween us, but no one had commented on my belly. I had managed to hide it beneath\nloose dark shirts and cardigans and the dark arena also massively helped but\nthere was still that one perfectly timed picture where the bump was quite\nvisible and there were a few rumours that were quickly overshadowed by\nsomething Harry had done on stage that night.</p><p>Picking up a little tub of a cheese dip from the fridge I\nsmiled at the fond memory the spurted at the front of my mind.</p><p><i>Harry pulled the\ncold cheese dip from my hand and put it back into the fridge, vehemently\nignoring the glare I shot at him. \u201cYou can\u2019t eat that. It\u2019s bad for Nora.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Leaning forward I\npicked it back up and swerved away from Harry and his big hands as he tried to\ntake it from me again, a daring smirk stretching his beautiful pink lips. He\npressed himself up against my back, the warmth from his body somehow seeping\nthrough my jacket and against my skin. The heat reminded me of what he had\nwoken me up with only an hour ago and I felt my cheeks erupt with warmth.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cPut the cheese\ndown.\u201d He murmured into my ear, teeth nipping lightly as he squeezed my hips.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Ignoring the\nscolding heat of him I lifted the little tub of cheese up and put my finger on\none of the ingredients displayed on the packaging and held it up close to him\nso he could see it. \u201cPasteurised milk. It\u2019s fine.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cEvie,\u201d Harry\nfrowned against my ear and tried to grab it from me again but I twisted out of\nhis reach and clutched the cool cheese to my chest in protection. I wanted\ncheese and I was going to have it. \u201cIt\u2019s still not healthy.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m pregnant and\nhungry. Don\u2019t mess with my cheese.\u201d He shook his head and smiled loving at me,\nhand reaching out to take the cheese so he could put it in the trolley for me. </i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Shaking my head, I stuck my tongue out and kept walking up the aisle, one\nhand holding my cheese to my chest while the other caressed over my belly as\nNora started to kick. I heard Harry chuckle quietly. \u201cSwear I won\u2019t put it back\nEve\u2019s. Just don\u2019t want you to make it warm holding onto it.\u201d Pursing my lips, I\nturned to look back at him. His hand was still out, slowly I passed it over to\nhim, keeping my eyes on him till he dropped it into the baby seat of the\ntrolley where I could see it clearly. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky I love you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cWell I love\ncheese.\u201d I had almost gotten to the end of the aisle when Harry snuck up behind\nme his hands tickling my sides.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>I laughed hard,\ntrying to twist out of his hold but he just looped his arms around my waist completely\nto pull me into him, his lips silencing my laugh. He kissed me heavily, right\nin the middle of the grocery store despite his own words to keep PDA\nnon-existent, his hands sliding from my hips to cup my ass in his hands.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cI love you,\u201d he\nwhispered against my lips, still caressing them lightly with his own.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cI love you too,\nthough I think you made me pee a little.\u201d Harry laughed lightly and I crossed\nmy legs a little, trying to fight off laughing again.</i></p><p>I chuckled as I slipped the new tub of cheese into my\nbasket. Somehow Harry and I had become closer after the last few weekends. I\nthought that we were close before but somehow after one night, with love\ndeclarations and some great sex, we were like one. I couldn\u2019t explain but I had\nnever felt so right. My life had never felt so perfect and moving in the right\ndirection despite the little detour of Nora. I felt a way that I never had with\nLuke. I had never been even a fraction close to real love with Luke now that I\nknew what it was like to truly love Harry.</p><p>I sighed deeply as I continued up the aisles. Harry was\nleaving for a few weeks and I had already felt so lost just thinking about him going.\nHe was sat on my couch at home talking over some last-minute things with Jeff\nbut already I missed him so much. He was also a little annoyed that I wasn\u2019t\ngoing to go with him on the next two legs of the tour but Australia seemed a\nlittle too far away if something were to go wrong.</p><p>I would be fine without him. I had Anne and Gemma in\nLondon with me and Grace every few weeks when she flew back from New York, but\nthey didn\u2019t compare to Harry. Harry was always the one I talked to. For years\nhe was the one that I called first when I just needed to talk. Even when I was\nwith Luke I would rather talk to Harry. </p><p>When I got home for the hospital after my parents died I\nleft Luke asleep in my bed, snoring his head off while I snuck downstairs,\nHarry\u2019s number already dialled on my phone. I sat outside talking to him on my\nback deck until the sun rose behind the trees. Then I didn\u2019t think it was a bad\nthing but now I realised if it was Harry that he been in my bed that night and\nnot Luke, he wouldn\u2019t have fallen asleep, he would have stayed awake peppering\nmy neck with kisses and letting me talk until I fell asleep in his arms. </p><p>\u201cEvie,\u201d the voice was soft, the gentlest tone I had ever\nheard leave his mouth, but the single word was still laced with shock.</p><p>My chest tightened incredibly and I had to reach out my\nhand to steady myself on one of the shelves. I knew that voice, it was a voice\nthat I loved and still leaves me trembling at the sound. I took in a deep shaky\nbreath, fighting through the painful lump in my throat and turned to look at\nLuke standing a few feet away from me. </p><p>Luke was staring at my belly that was very prominent and\nstood out with the pink floral tunic that fell over it softly. He was breathing\nheavily, hand held out towards me, much like Harry\u2019s was a few days ago. Harry\u2019s\nhand was held out with a devilish smirk that met his eyes with a glint, it made\nme feel hot and bothered and ready to jump his bones. Luke\u2019s hand did the\nopposite. My heart was hammering against my chest as I looked down at his hand,\nhis jaw was tense and I could see behind his eyes that he was doing the math. </p><p>Finally, Luke looked up at me, soft ocean blue eyes\nmeeting mine. I couldn\u2019t figure out if he was upset or scared but I knew that I\nwas definitely the latter. \u201cYou\u2019re pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Luke\u2019s words knocked me out of the stupor I was in and I\ndropped the basket down to the floor with a clang drawing the eyes of everybody\nelse in the aisle. A had only come in for milk and it burst open as it slipped\nfrom the basket. My eyes stung with tears that I really didn\u2019t want to feel now\nas I stepped back to avoid the rapidly spreading puddle of milk. I dropped down\nto pick up the other things that I had in my basket but Luke stepped in the way\nand knocked my hands backwards quickly, picking up the items while a staff\nmember came over to help clean up the spill.</p><p>My breath was shaky as I stepped back away while Luke was\noccupied, apologising profusely to the staff member. I shouldn\u2019t have been\nwalking away from him but my legs were walking towards the door on instinct. I\nneeded to talk this through with him, he could be Nora\u2019s dad and although I\ndidn\u2019t like the idea of it I wouldn\u2019t keep Nora away from him. But I didn\u2019t\nwant to be dealing with this now or in the middle of a grocery store with all\nthe people around, it was lunch time and busier then when Harry and I normally popped\nin together. </p><p>My hands tightened into fists around the soft material of\nmy blouse as I fought the tears that were still lingering at the back of my\neyes, fighting to be set free. I was yet to have any tears slip out but I\nfought them back as well as I could have because I didn\u2019t want to cry over Luke\nanymore, I had shed to many tears for that man.</p><p>\u201cEvie, stop.\u201d Luke hurriedly caught up to me and gently\ngrabbed my arm and pulled me back. I spun into him, the big bump of my belly\nhitting his stomach and I jolted back away from as if he had thrown a glass of\nscolding water on me. Luke released my arm with my actions but his eyes were\nstill glued to my belly in a state of surprise. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you call me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to.\u201d My arms circled around my belly\nprotectively. Luke wouldn\u2019t hurt me, at least not physically but I felt like I\nwas about to have a massive anxiety attack at the front door of the grocery\nstore.</p><p>Luke raised his hand, pinching the bridge of his nose,\neyes squeezing shut. It was something I had seen Harry do since the beginning\nof the tour whenever Jeff said something to him and he was just too tired to\nproperly process it. There had always been a lot of similarities between Harry\nand Luke and I felt like they were hitting me hard and right in the face.</p><p>They were both always so soft and caring towards me. I\nhad felt so loved and safe with the both of them. They held me when I was sad\nand talked me through so many of my toughest times. No -matter how good Luke\nwas to me, Harry was always just one step ahead of him which was why I was more\ndrawn to talk to him and why Luke never really liked Harry.</p><p>\u201cI know I made a mistake Evie but please don\u2019t punish me\nlike this.\u201d He looked really hurt as his eyes moved over my belly. He stepped\ncloser to me, hand stretching out again but I stepped out of his reach, I\ndidn\u2019t want to feel his hands on my belly.</p><p>For the smallest second, I was glad that it was hurting\nhim I wanted him to feel pain. I had hurt for months after what he did to me\nand it was only recently that I had began to feel like I was getting over it\nand he barges back into my life and dares to play me as the bad guy in all this.\nSo, for one fraction of a second, I was extremely proud of the crack I saw in\nhis strong exterior because he deserved it.</p><p>It was only one small second that was ended with a hard\nkick to the bottom of my belly where my hand was sat. I shook my head from the\nthoughts, I just needed to move on from all this, lingering on my hatred of\nLuke was not moving on. \u201cI can\u2019t do this Luke. Not now, it\u2019s too much.\u201d</p><p>Turning away from Luke I walked to my car my hands\nshaking as I dug through my handbag to find my keys. Everybody was staring at\nme, eyes soft as I walked away from him, there stares were sympathetic and I\nwanted to curl up under the pressure of the looks, it couldn\u2019t have been as bad\nas what Luke felt with the few glares he was receiving. </p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t keep my baby away from me.\u201d Luke said strongly\nfrom behind me drawing all the eyes to him. Now everybody was glaring at him\nand they were whispering back and forth. I felt a little reassured to know he wouldn\u2019t\ndo anything to be with audience.</p><p>My steps faltered at the small threat that was laced\nthrough his voice. I felt sickness turning through my stomach which I hadn\u2019t\nfelt since my first trimester.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, I pushed the sickening feeling down\nas my hand finally found my keys and I got to the driver side door of my car. My\nhands were still trembling as I got into the driver\u2019s seat, all of me was trembling\nwith what just happened. Out of the corner of my eye I could see that Luke was\nstill stood near the entrance of the store and he was watching me closely.</p><p>Luke\u2019s eyes had usually looked at me so softly and with\nso much care but now his strong stare and tight jaw was intimidating. I felt as\nif I was on display in a museum under his blue eyes.</p><p>There were only a few things I had come to get, a quick\npop in and back out of the store but it almost felt like I had spent a year in\nbattle. That one five-minute interaction felt worse than the entire week after\nour break up. My heart was still beating erratically and Nora was moving like\ncrazy in my belly, the interaction had upset me so much she could feel it as\nwell.</p><p>My hands were still shaking terribly as I pulled into my garage\nnext to Harry\u2019s range rover but Nora\u2019s movements had calmed to gentle kicks and\npushes against my belly. I still hadn\u2019t cried yet but I could feel the tears\ndangerously persistent at the back of my eyes. Coming into the warmth and\nsafety of my house and hearing Harry, Grace and Jeff\u2019s voices talking without\nany worry a few rooms away made the dam that I had held back break loose.</p><p>The door to the garage slammed shut behind me and I jumped\na mile high at the sharp sound. I didn\u2019t feel right. I felt as if I was on\nanother planet completely and no matter what words I continuously told myself I\ncouldn\u2019t settle the nerves rattling through my chest and shaking through my\nhands. I couldn\u2019t stop my hands from shaking.</p><p>My bag slipped from my arm and to the warm wooden floors\nwith a gentle thud. Desperately my hand reached out to grab the nearest thing I\ncould get my fingers around so I didn\u2019t follow my bag into a scattered mess on\nthe floor.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so, so sorry. I couldn\u2019t tell who I was apologising\nto. Luke, Harry, Nora, my parents or even myself I could have apologised to all\nof them so I just kept repeating it. If I kept apologising then maybe\neverything would be okay. I needed everything to be okay because I couldn\u2019t\nbring Nora into a world like this.</p><p>\u201cEvie?\u201d Harry said from the other room. \u201cAre you home?\u201d\nHis voice both equally laced with worry and confusion.</p><p>I fought to get some words past my lips, anything, to acknowledge\nhim, anything I could get out so I could make him know that I\u2019m here. I wanted\nto hug myself into his chest and bury myself into the safety that he always provides\nme. But instead I was stuck in the entrance hall of my house chocking on my\nwords. The only sound I could properly get out was a strangled sob.</p><p>\u201cEvie,\u201d Harry repeated again this time the worry outweighing\nthe confusion ten times more.</p><p>I heard the sound of a guitar being sat down on a table\nthen the hurried footsteps of numerous people echoing against the wooden floor.\nMy blurred, stinging eyes saw Harry first, he muttered a quick \u2018shit\u2019 as he\nquickly crossed the room, arms already out stretched to catch me if I fell to\nthe floor. </p><p>The moment Harry was close enough I released my tight\nhold from around the doorframe and threw myself into his arms, mine locked\naround his neck and pulled myself against him and into his warmth as strongly\nas I could. My sobs were muffled against his black tour hoodie that smelt so\nstrongly of him, I took deep breathes of the intoxicating smell in, trying to\ncomfort myself.</p><p>Harry\u2019s hands slid over my hips, my belly, my back,\neverywhere, anywhere he could get his hands, he was massaging my skin. His warm\nexploring hands were looking for whatever was hurting me, trying to find a way\nto make it stop because he hated seeing me cry. But he couldn\u2019t stop the pain I\nfelt on the inside with just his hands.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, what hurts?\u201d He whispered into my ear,\npeppering soft kisses against my forehead as he tugged me as close as possible\nbut my belly was already pressed tightly against his and I couldn\u2019t get any\ncloser much to my dislike.</p><p>\u201cI want to do the paternity test now.\u201d My hands dug into\nhis hoodie with my words and I buried my face deeper into the material to let\nit soak up my tears.</p><p>Harry tensed with my words and I swear that I heard the\nstutter of his heartbeat underneath my ear despite the layers of warmth he had\non. He slipped his hand up to the back of my neck and gave it a soft squeeze as\nhe pressed a small kiss to the side of my head. </p><p>\u201cBreathe for me Evie.\u201d Harry\u2019s voice was tight as he to\ntried force as much sweetness as he could into the sound. He was angry. I could\nfeel it vibrating off him in scorching waves. I didn\u2019t even have to say Luke\u2019s\nname and he knew that must have been what had set me off. \u201cCome on breath. Nora\ncan\u2019t have her mummy so stressed out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants her.\u201d I whispered trying to get a decent amount\nof air into my lungs like he had said but I couldn\u2019t. I had to relax first\nbefore I could think of getting my breathing straight.</p><p>All I wanted was to be here for Nora, she was my main\npriority. I couldn\u2019t be here for her wholly if I was too caught up trying to\nmove on from Luke. I still hadn\u2019t entirely gotten over him the first time and\nnow he was coming smashing back into my life like a wrecking ball, destroying\nthe feeble walls I had built to protect myself.</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t take her from you Evie. Not anytime soon the\nbest he could do is get visitation, a few hours every week. They won\u2019t take a\nnewborn from her mother.\u201d My chest tightened at the words and I groaned into\nHarry\u2019s chest. I knew he was right but it wasn\u2019t what I wanted to hear right\nnow.</p><p>\u201cI want her to be yours.\u201d Drawing back, I looked up at\nhim, my eyes still blurred and nose a little sniffly. </p><p>Harry squeezed my neck again and smiled caringly. \u201cSo, do\nI Eve\u2019s. So do I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to be so angry with me when he finds out you\ncould be the father.\u201d I groaned and ran a hand over my forehead before\nburrowing back against his chest, my eyes flicking up to watch him from\nunderneath my wet lashes.</p><p>Luke never really liked Harry, almost despised him,\nbecause he always thought that he was flirting with me \u2013 which maybe he did a\nbit but that was beside the point. Whenever Harry was around Luke had an arm\naround my shoulders and was dragging me against his side, glaring over the top\nof my head in the direction of wherever Harry was stood. I couldn\u2019t blame Harry\nfor not liking Luke but over the last few months, I also couldn\u2019t blame Luke\nfor feeling threatened by Harry but I would have never betrayed my loyalty to\nLuke and went to Harry behind Luke\u2019s back while we were together. I would have\nnever cheated on him.</p><p>Harry\u2019s jaw ticked, hand tightening around my neck while\nthe other twitched over my hip. \u201cYou never cheated on him Evie. We didn\u2019t do\nanything until the two of you were broken up. He has no reason to be angry with\nyou after what he did to you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t want you to leave now.\u201d I whimpered.</p><p>It was only a few weeks until I had him back and could\ncuddle him close into my arms again but it felt like it was going to be an\neternity now. And when I did get him back it wouldn\u2019t be for long before I said\ngoodbye to him again for another few weeks. How did Anne send him off on his\nfirst tour and every tour after that, it was to hard to comprehend him leaving\neven if it was for a short time span. \u00a0</p><p>Harry sighed, his hands massaging up and down my back\nagain. \u201cWill facetime you every day. Want to see your belly grow.\u201d He kissed\nover my neck as his hands weaselled there way beneath my blouse and caressing\nover my hips. \u201cWe should go have a nice warm bath together to relax.\u201d</p><p>.-.-.-.</p><p>\u201cI bought something for Nora today.\u201d Harry said as he\nclimbed up onto the bed at my feet.</p><p>His hair was still wet from the bath and curling a bit\nmore around his ears but he looked warm in his tracksuit pants and a different\nhoodie because I had taken his tour hoodie. He had my bottle of moisturiser in\nhis hands and a white little box that was a mystery to me. Dropping the items\ndown he took my legs and slung them over his, scoching down so he was sat\nbetween them, his hands quickly pushing his hoodie up so he could see my bump. </p><p>I felt much better after the bath with Harry, he had put\nlavender oils in the warm water and it worked perfectly against all the hurt in\nmy muscles and the worry in my chest. Having Harry sat behind me was also a\ngreat help, his rough fingers dancing patterns in the bubble suds across my\nbelly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, eyeing the little box sat near my hip. I\nstill couldn\u2019t tell what the picture on it was. God he better not have gotten\nme a vibrator.</p><p>He smirked at me quickly before grabbing the box, as he opened\nit the contents fell out on the bed with a little rustle. It was two, little\ndiscs with a cord connected to them and I smiled at him realising what exactly\nit was that he had bought. Definitely not a vibrator. He had a cute little\nfrown on his face as he untangled the chords and read through the instructions\nquickly before throwing them to the side.</p><p>\u201cAdam was telling me he used to play music when Emi was\npregnant with Silver and Spike\u201d He said as he stuck the two little discs to\neither side of my belly. \u201cSo I went googleing and found these so Nora can\nlisten to me even when she\u2019s not joining us on tour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if she wants to listen to Lady Gaga. Maybe \u2018born\nthis way\u2019.\u201d I raised my eyebrows at him in jest as I watched him find his phone\nand plug the cord in to it. </p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019d be happy with her anyway she\u2019s born but she\nneeds to hear her daddy\u2019s voice.\u201d A big smile crossed my lips hearing him refer\nto himself as daddy, Nora\u2019s daddy.</p><p>The room was quiet until I heard the soft beginning\nguitar strums of sweet creature coming for the two little discs. The sound was muted\nand the little discs vibrated a little against my skin. Harry smiled at my\nbelly, hands caressing the sides of my protruding belly around the discs.</p><p>Dropping my hands down I linked my fingers with Harry\u2019s.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to miss you so much.\u201d</p><p>Harry smiled sadly fingers circling my belly while his thumb\nrun over the back of my hand. \u201cIs she kicking?\u201d he asked instead of\nacknowledging what I said. </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not kicking, but she\u2019s moving.\u201d She was rolling\naround a bit which she normally wasn\u2019t at this time of day. \u201cYou woke her up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to come with me? I can get\nyou a last-minute flight.\u201d He looked close to tears as he slumped down next to\nme, quickly cuddling me close, the soft muted sound of sweet creature still\nplaying through the little discs.</p><p>Harry flew out tomorrow and as much as I did want to go\nwith him I knew it wasn\u2019t practical even if I wasn\u2019t six months pregnant. Sighing\nI twisted so I could lean against his chest and get the weight off my back.\nHarry sighed as well and reached over to hold my belly again, he knew the\nanswer before he even asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he stretched out. \u201cI\u2019ll miss you too.\u201d</p>",

It made it easier so we weren\u2019t pictured by\nfans or any paparazzi. </p>[[MORE]]<p>My pregnancy was still a secret between us and our\nclosest friends and family. It was a surprise because I had been in the crowd at\nall of his European shows and there were a number of pictures being shared of\nme being there, curious as to why I was at so many shows and what was going on\nbetween us, but no one had commented on my belly. I had managed to hide it beneath\nloose dark shirts and cardigans and the dark arena also massively helped but\nthere was still that one perfectly timed picture where the bump was quite\nvisible and there were a few rumours that were quickly overshadowed by\nsomething Harry had done on stage that night.</p><p>Picking up a little tub of a cheese dip from the fridge I\nsmiled at the fond memory the spurted at the front of my mind.</p><p><i>Harry pulled the\ncold cheese dip from my hand and put it back into the fridge, vehemently\nignoring the glare I shot at him. \u201cYou can\u2019t eat that. It\u2019s bad for Nora.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Leaning forward I\npicked it back up and swerved away from Harry and his big hands as he tried to\ntake it from me again, a daring smirk stretching his beautiful pink lips. He\npressed himself up against my back, the warmth from his body somehow seeping\nthrough my jacket and against my skin. The heat reminded me of what he had\nwoken me up with only an hour ago and I felt my cheeks erupt with warmth.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cPut the cheese\ndown.\u201d He murmured into my ear, teeth nipping lightly as he squeezed my hips.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Ignoring the\nscolding heat of him I lifted the little tub of cheese up and put my finger on\none of the ingredients displayed on the packaging and held it up close to him\nso he could see it. \u201cPasteurised milk. It\u2019s fine.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cEvie,\u201d Harry\nfrowned against my ear and tried to grab it from me again but I twisted out of\nhis reach and clutched the cool cheese to my chest in protection. I wanted\ncheese and I was going to have it. \u201cIt\u2019s still not healthy.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m pregnant and\nhungry. Don\u2019t mess with my cheese.\u201d He shook his head and smiled loving at me,\nhand reaching out to take the cheese so he could put it in the trolley for me. </i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Shaking my head, I stuck my tongue out and kept walking up the aisle, one\nhand holding my cheese to my chest while the other caressed over my belly as\nNora started to kick. I heard Harry chuckle quietly. \u201cSwear I won\u2019t put it back\nEve\u2019s. Just don\u2019t want you to make it warm holding onto it.\u201d Pursing my lips, I\nturned to look back at him. His hand was still out, slowly I passed it over to\nhim, keeping my eyes on him till he dropped it into the baby seat of the\ntrolley where I could see it clearly. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky I love you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cWell I love\ncheese.\u201d I had almost gotten to the end of the aisle when Harry snuck up behind\nme his hands tickling my sides.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>I laughed hard,\ntrying to twist out of his hold but he just looped his arms around my waist completely\nto pull me into him, his lips silencing my laugh. He kissed me heavily, right\nin the middle of the grocery store despite his own words to keep PDA\nnon-existent, his hands sliding from my hips to cup my ass in his hands.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cI love you,\u201d he\nwhispered against my lips, still caressing them lightly with his own.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cI love you too,\nthough I think you made me pee a little.\u201d Harry laughed lightly and I crossed\nmy legs a little, trying to fight off laughing again.</i></p><p>I chuckled as I slipped the new tub of cheese into my\nbasket. Somehow Harry and I had become closer after the last few weekends. I\nthought that we were close before but somehow after one night, with love\ndeclarations and some great sex, we were like one. I couldn\u2019t explain but I had\nnever felt so right. My life had never felt so perfect and moving in the right\ndirection despite the little detour of Nora. I felt a way that I never had with\nLuke. I had never been even a fraction close to real love with Luke now that I\nknew what it was like to truly love Harry.</p><p>I sighed deeply as I continued up the aisles. Harry was\nleaving for a few weeks and I had already felt so lost just thinking about him going.\nHe was sat on my couch at home talking over some last-minute things with Jeff\nbut already I missed him so much. He was also a little annoyed that I wasn\u2019t\ngoing to go with him on the next two legs of the tour but Australia seemed a\nlittle too far away if something were to go wrong.</p><p>I would be fine without him. I had Anne and Gemma in\nLondon with me and Grace every few weeks when she flew back from New York, but\nthey didn\u2019t compare to Harry. Harry was always the one I talked to. For years\nhe was the one that I called first when I just needed to talk. Even when I was\nwith Luke I would rather talk to Harry. </p><p>When I got home for the hospital after my parents died I\nleft Luke asleep in my bed, snoring his head off while I snuck downstairs,\nHarry\u2019s number already dialled on my phone. I sat outside talking to him on my\nback deck until the sun rose behind the trees. Then I didn\u2019t think it was a bad\nthing but now I realised if it was Harry that he been in my bed that night and\nnot Luke, he wouldn\u2019t have fallen asleep, he would have stayed awake peppering\nmy neck with kisses and letting me talk until I fell asleep in his arms. </p><p>\u201cEvie,\u201d the voice was soft, the gentlest tone I had ever\nheard leave his mouth, but the single word was still laced with shock.</p><p>My chest tightened incredibly and I had to reach out my\nhand to steady myself on one of the shelves. I knew that voice, it was a voice\nthat I loved and still leaves me trembling at the sound. I took in a deep shaky\nbreath, fighting through the painful lump in my throat and turned to look at\nLuke standing a few feet away from me. </p><p>Luke was staring at my belly that was very prominent and\nstood out with the pink floral tunic that fell over it softly. He was breathing\nheavily, hand held out towards me, much like Harry\u2019s was a few days ago. Harry\u2019s\nhand was held out with a devilish smirk that met his eyes with a glint, it made\nme feel hot and bothered and ready to jump his bones. Luke\u2019s hand did the\nopposite. My heart was hammering against my chest as I looked down at his hand,\nhis jaw was tense and I could see behind his eyes that he was doing the math. </p><p>Finally, Luke looked up at me, soft ocean blue eyes\nmeeting mine. I couldn\u2019t figure out if he was upset or scared but I knew that I\nwas definitely the latter. \u201cYou\u2019re pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Luke\u2019s words knocked me out of the stupor I was in and I\ndropped the basket down to the floor with a clang drawing the eyes of everybody\nelse in the aisle. A had only come in for milk and it burst open as it slipped\nfrom the basket. My eyes stung with tears that I really didn\u2019t want to feel now\nas I stepped back to avoid the rapidly spreading puddle of milk. I dropped down\nto pick up the other things that I had in my basket but Luke stepped in the way\nand knocked my hands backwards quickly, picking up the items while a staff\nmember came over to help clean up the spill.</p><p>My breath was shaky as I stepped back away while Luke was\noccupied, apologising profusely to the staff member. I shouldn\u2019t have been\nwalking away from him but my legs were walking towards the door on instinct. I\nneeded to talk this through with him, he could be Nora\u2019s dad and although I\ndidn\u2019t like the idea of it I wouldn\u2019t keep Nora away from him. But I didn\u2019t\nwant to be dealing with this now or in the middle of a grocery store with all\nthe people around, it was lunch time and busier then when Harry and I normally popped\nin together. </p><p>My hands tightened into fists around the soft material of\nmy blouse as I fought the tears that were still lingering at the back of my\neyes, fighting to be set free. I was yet to have any tears slip out but I\nfought them back as well as I could have because I didn\u2019t want to cry over Luke\nanymore, I had shed to many tears for that man.</p><p>\u201cEvie, stop.\u201d Luke hurriedly caught up to me and gently\ngrabbed my arm and pulled me back. I spun into him, the big bump of my belly\nhitting his stomach and I jolted back away from as if he had thrown a glass of\nscolding water on me. Luke released my arm with my actions but his eyes were\nstill glued to my belly in a state of surprise. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you call me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to.\u201d My arms circled around my belly\nprotectively. Luke wouldn\u2019t hurt me, at least not physically but I felt like I\nwas about to have a massive anxiety attack at the front door of the grocery\nstore.</p><p>Luke raised his hand, pinching the bridge of his nose,\neyes squeezing shut. It was something I had seen Harry do since the beginning\nof the tour whenever Jeff said something to him and he was just too tired to\nproperly process it. There had always been a lot of similarities between Harry\nand Luke and I felt like they were hitting me hard and right in the face.</p><p>They were both always so soft and caring towards me. I\nhad felt so loved and safe with the both of them. They held me when I was sad\nand talked me through so many of my toughest times. No -matter how good Luke\nwas to me, Harry was always just one step ahead of him which was why I was more\ndrawn to talk to him and why Luke never really liked Harry.</p><p>\u201cI know I made a mistake Evie but please don\u2019t punish me\nlike this.\u201d He looked really hurt as his eyes moved over my belly. He stepped\ncloser to me, hand stretching out again but I stepped out of his reach, I\ndidn\u2019t want to feel his hands on my belly.</p><p>For the smallest second, I was glad that it was hurting\nhim I wanted him to feel pain. I had hurt for months after what he did to me\nand it was only recently that I had began to feel like I was getting over it\nand he barges back into my life and dares to play me as the bad guy in all this.\nSo, for one fraction of a second, I was extremely proud of the crack I saw in\nhis strong exterior because he deserved it.</p><p>It was only one small second that was ended with a hard\nkick to the bottom of my belly where my hand was sat. I shook my head from the\nthoughts, I just needed to move on from all this, lingering on my hatred of\nLuke was not moving on. \u201cI can\u2019t do this Luke. Not now, it\u2019s too much.\u201d</p><p>Turning away from Luke I walked to my car my hands\nshaking as I dug through my handbag to find my keys. Everybody was staring at\nme, eyes soft as I walked away from him, there stares were sympathetic and I\nwanted to curl up under the pressure of the looks, it couldn\u2019t have been as bad\nas what Luke felt with the few glares he was receiving. </p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t keep my baby away from me.\u201d Luke said strongly\nfrom behind me drawing all the eyes to him. Now everybody was glaring at him\nand they were whispering back and forth. I felt a little reassured to know he wouldn\u2019t\ndo anything to be with audience.</p><p>My steps faltered at the small threat that was laced\nthrough his voice. I felt sickness turning through my stomach which I hadn\u2019t\nfelt since my first trimester.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, I pushed the sickening feeling down\nas my hand finally found my keys and I got to the driver side door of my car. My\nhands were still trembling as I got into the driver\u2019s seat, all of me was trembling\nwith what just happened. Out of the corner of my eye I could see that Luke was\nstill stood near the entrance of the store and he was watching me closely.</p><p>Luke\u2019s eyes had usually looked at me so softly and with\nso much care but now his strong stare and tight jaw was intimidating. I felt as\nif I was on display in a museum under his blue eyes.</p><p>There were only a few things I had come to get, a quick\npop in and back out of the store but it almost felt like I had spent a year in\nbattle. That one five-minute interaction felt worse than the entire week after\nour break up. My heart was still beating erratically and Nora was moving like\ncrazy in my belly, the interaction had upset me so much she could feel it as\nwell.</p><p>My hands were still shaking terribly as I pulled into my garage\nnext to Harry\u2019s range rover but Nora\u2019s movements had calmed to gentle kicks and\npushes against my belly. I still hadn\u2019t cried yet but I could feel the tears\ndangerously persistent at the back of my eyes. Coming into the warmth and\nsafety of my house and hearing Harry, Grace and Jeff\u2019s voices talking without\nany worry a few rooms away made the dam that I had held back break loose.</p><p>The door to the garage slammed shut behind me and I jumped\na mile high at the sharp sound. I didn\u2019t feel right. I felt as if I was on\nanother planet completely and no matter what words I continuously told myself I\ncouldn\u2019t settle the nerves rattling through my chest and shaking through my\nhands. I couldn\u2019t stop my hands from shaking.</p><p>My bag slipped from my arm and to the warm wooden floors\nwith a gentle thud. Desperately my hand reached out to grab the nearest thing I\ncould get my fingers around so I didn\u2019t follow my bag into a scattered mess on\nthe floor.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so, so sorry. I couldn\u2019t tell who I was apologising\nto. Luke, Harry, Nora, my parents or even myself I could have apologised to all\nof them so I just kept repeating it. If I kept apologising then maybe\neverything would be okay. I needed everything to be okay because I couldn\u2019t\nbring Nora into a world like this.</p><p>\u201cEvie?\u201d Harry said from the other room. \u201cAre you home?\u201d\nHis voice both equally laced with worry and confusion.</p><p>I fought to get some words past my lips, anything, to acknowledge\nhim, anything I could get out so I could make him know that I\u2019m here. I wanted\nto hug myself into his chest and bury myself into the safety that he always provides\nme. But instead I was stuck in the entrance hall of my house chocking on my\nwords. The only sound I could properly get out was a strangled sob.</p><p>\u201cEvie,\u201d Harry repeated again this time the worry outweighing\nthe confusion ten times more.</p><p>I heard the sound of a guitar being sat down on a table\nthen the hurried footsteps of numerous people echoing against the wooden floor.\nMy blurred, stinging eyes saw Harry first, he muttered a quick \u2018shit\u2019 as he\nquickly crossed the room, arms already out stretched to catch me if I fell to\nthe floor. </p><p>The moment Harry was close enough I released my tight\nhold from around the doorframe and threw myself into his arms, mine locked\naround his neck and pulled myself against him and into his warmth as strongly\nas I could. My sobs were muffled against his black tour hoodie that smelt so\nstrongly of him, I took deep breathes of the intoxicating smell in, trying to\ncomfort myself.</p><p>Harry\u2019s hands slid over my hips, my belly, my back,\neverywhere, anywhere he could get his hands, he was massaging my skin. His warm\nexploring hands were looking for whatever was hurting me, trying to find a way\nto make it stop because he hated seeing me cry. But he couldn\u2019t stop the pain I\nfelt on the inside with just his hands.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, what hurts?\u201d He whispered into my ear,\npeppering soft kisses against my forehead as he tugged me as close as possible\nbut my belly was already pressed tightly against his and I couldn\u2019t get any\ncloser much to my dislike.</p><p>\u201cI want to do the paternity test now.\u201d My hands dug into\nhis hoodie with my words and I buried my face deeper into the material to let\nit soak up my tears.</p><p>Harry tensed with my words and I swear that I heard the\nstutter of his heartbeat underneath my ear despite the layers of warmth he had\non. He slipped his hand up to the back of my neck and gave it a soft squeeze as\nhe pressed a small kiss to the side of my head. </p><p>\u201cBreathe for me Evie.\u201d Harry\u2019s voice was tight as he to\ntried force as much sweetness as he could into the sound. He was angry. I could\nfeel it vibrating off him in scorching waves. I didn\u2019t even have to say Luke\u2019s\nname and he knew that must have been what had set me off. \u201cCome on breath. Nora\ncan\u2019t have her mummy so stressed out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants her.\u201d I whispered trying to get a decent amount\nof air into my lungs like he had said but I couldn\u2019t. I had to relax first\nbefore I could think of getting my breathing straight.</p><p>All I wanted was to be here for Nora, she was my main\npriority. I couldn\u2019t be here for her wholly if I was too caught up trying to\nmove on from Luke. I still hadn\u2019t entirely gotten over him the first time and\nnow he was coming smashing back into my life like a wrecking ball, destroying\nthe feeble walls I had built to protect myself.</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t take her from you Evie. Not anytime soon the\nbest he could do is get visitation, a few hours every week. They won\u2019t take a\nnewborn from her mother.\u201d My chest tightened at the words and I groaned into\nHarry\u2019s chest. I knew he was right but it wasn\u2019t what I wanted to hear right\nnow.</p><p>\u201cI want her to be yours.\u201d Drawing back, I looked up at\nhim, my eyes still blurred and nose a little sniffly. </p><p>Harry squeezed my neck again and smiled caringly. \u201cSo, do\nI Eve\u2019s. So do I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to be so angry with me when he finds out you\ncould be the father.\u201d I groaned and ran a hand over my forehead before\nburrowing back against his chest, my eyes flicking up to watch him from\nunderneath my wet lashes.</p><p>Luke never really liked Harry, almost despised him,\nbecause he always thought that he was flirting with me \u2013 which maybe he did a\nbit but that was beside the point. Whenever Harry was around Luke had an arm\naround my shoulders and was dragging me against his side, glaring over the top\nof my head in the direction of wherever Harry was stood. I couldn\u2019t blame Harry\nfor not liking Luke but over the last few months, I also couldn\u2019t blame Luke\nfor feeling threatened by Harry but I would have never betrayed my loyalty to\nLuke and went to Harry behind Luke\u2019s back while we were together. I would have\nnever cheated on him.</p><p>Harry\u2019s jaw ticked, hand tightening around my neck while\nthe other twitched over my hip. \u201cYou never cheated on him Evie. We didn\u2019t do\nanything until the two of you were broken up. He has no reason to be angry with\nyou after what he did to you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t want you to leave now.\u201d I whimpered.</p><p>It was only a few weeks until I had him back and could\ncuddle him close into my arms again but it felt like it was going to be an\neternity now. And when I did get him back it wouldn\u2019t be for long before I said\ngoodbye to him again for another few weeks. How did Anne send him off on his\nfirst tour and every tour after that, it was to hard to comprehend him leaving\neven if it was for a short time span. \u00a0</p><p>Harry sighed, his hands massaging up and down my back\nagain. \u201cWill facetime you every day. Want to see your belly grow.\u201d He kissed\nover my neck as his hands weaselled there way beneath my blouse and caressing\nover my hips. \u201cWe should go have a nice warm bath together to relax.\u201d</p><p>.-.-.-.</p><p>\u201cI bought something for Nora today.\u201d Harry said as he\nclimbed up onto the bed at my feet.</p><p>His hair was still wet from the bath and curling a bit\nmore around his ears but he looked warm in his tracksuit pants and a different\nhoodie because I had taken his tour hoodie. He had my bottle of moisturiser in\nhis hands and a white little box that was a mystery to me. Dropping the items\ndown he took my legs and slung them over his, scoching down so he was sat\nbetween them, his hands quickly pushing his hoodie up so he could see my bump. </p><p>I felt much better after the bath with Harry, he had put\nlavender oils in the warm water and it worked perfectly against all the hurt in\nmy muscles and the worry in my chest. Having Harry sat behind me was also a\ngreat help, his rough fingers dancing patterns in the bubble suds across my\nbelly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, eyeing the little box sat near my hip. I\nstill couldn\u2019t tell what the picture on it was. God he better not have gotten\nme a vibrator.</p><p>He smirked at me quickly before grabbing the box, as he opened\nit the contents fell out on the bed with a little rustle. It was two, little\ndiscs with a cord connected to them and I smiled at him realising what exactly\nit was that he had bought. Definitely not a vibrator. He had a cute little\nfrown on his face as he untangled the chords and read through the instructions\nquickly before throwing them to the side.</p><p>\u201cAdam was telling me he used to play music when Emi was\npregnant with Silver and Spike\u201d He said as he stuck the two little discs to\neither side of my belly. \u201cSo I went googleing and found these so Nora can\nlisten to me even when she\u2019s not joining us on tour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if she wants to listen to Lady Gaga. Maybe \u2018born\nthis way\u2019.\u201d I raised my eyebrows at him in jest as I watched him find his phone\nand plug the cord in to it. </p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019d be happy with her anyway she\u2019s born but she\nneeds to hear her daddy\u2019s voice.\u201d A big smile crossed my lips hearing him refer\nto himself as daddy, Nora\u2019s daddy.</p><p>The room was quiet until I heard the soft beginning\nguitar strums of sweet creature coming for the two little discs. The sound was muted\nand the little discs vibrated a little against my skin. Harry smiled at my\nbelly, hands caressing the sides of my protruding belly around the discs.</p><p>Dropping my hands down I linked my fingers with Harry\u2019s.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to miss you so much.\u201d</p><p>Harry smiled sadly fingers circling my belly while his thumb\nrun over the back of my hand. \u201cIs she kicking?\u201d he asked instead of\nacknowledging what I said. </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not kicking, but she\u2019s moving.\u201d She was rolling\naround a bit which she normally wasn\u2019t at this time of day. \u201cYou woke her up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to come with me? I can get\nyou a last-minute flight.\u201d He looked close to tears as he slumped down next to\nme, quickly cuddling me close, the soft muted sound of sweet creature still\nplaying through the little discs.</p><p>Harry flew out tomorrow and as much as I did want to go\nwith him I knew it wasn\u2019t practical even if I wasn\u2019t six months pregnant. Sighing\nI twisted so I could lean against his chest and get the weight off my back.\nHarry sighed as well and reached over to hold my belly again, he knew the\nanswer before he even asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he stretched out. \u201cI\u2019ll miss you too.\u201d</p></p>",

I felt much more pressured and aware of what I was putting in\nmy body and passing on to Nora. Albeit it was much, much easier when I didn\u2019t\nhave Harry two steps behind me reminding me that I couldn\u2019t eat whatever I set\nmy eyes on.</p><p>We always made our trips to the grocery store early in\nthe morning, when the aisles were dead and the only people lingering were the\nfew other early risers and the staff who looked like they wished they were\nstill at home in their warm beds. It made it easier so we weren\u2019t pictured by\nfans or any paparazzi. </p>[[MORE]]<p>My pregnancy was still a secret between us and our\nclosest friends and family. It was a surprise because I had been in the crowd at\nall of his European shows and there were a number of pictures being shared of\nme being there, curious as to why I was at so many shows and what was going on\nbetween us, but no one had commented on my belly. I had managed to hide it beneath\nloose dark shirts and cardigans and the dark arena also massively helped but\nthere was still that one perfectly timed picture where the bump was quite\nvisible and there were a few rumours that were quickly overshadowed by\nsomething Harry had done on stage that night.</p><p>Picking up a little tub of a cheese dip from the fridge I\nsmiled at the fond memory the spurted at the front of my mind.</p><p><i>Harry pulled the\ncold cheese dip from my hand and put it back into the fridge, vehemently\nignoring the glare I shot at him. \u201cYou can\u2019t eat that. It\u2019s bad for Nora.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Leaning forward I\npicked it back up and swerved away from Harry and his big hands as he tried to\ntake it from me again, a daring smirk stretching his beautiful pink lips. He\npressed himself up against my back, the warmth from his body somehow seeping\nthrough my jacket and against my skin. The heat reminded me of what he had\nwoken me up with only an hour ago and I felt my cheeks erupt with warmth.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cPut the cheese\ndown.\u201d He murmured into my ear, teeth nipping lightly as he squeezed my hips.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Ignoring the\nscolding heat of him I lifted the little tub of cheese up and put my finger on\none of the ingredients displayed on the packaging and held it up close to him\nso he could see it. \u201cPasteurised milk. It\u2019s fine.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cEvie,\u201d Harry\nfrowned against my ear and tried to grab it from me again but I twisted out of\nhis reach and clutched the cool cheese to my chest in protection. I wanted\ncheese and I was going to have it. \u201cIt\u2019s still not healthy.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m pregnant and\nhungry. Don\u2019t mess with my cheese.\u201d He shook his head and smiled loving at me,\nhand reaching out to take the cheese so he could put it in the trolley for me. </i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Shaking my head, I stuck my tongue out and kept walking up the aisle, one\nhand holding my cheese to my chest while the other caressed over my belly as\nNora started to kick. I heard Harry chuckle quietly. \u201cSwear I won\u2019t put it back\nEve\u2019s. Just don\u2019t want you to make it warm holding onto it.\u201d Pursing my lips, I\nturned to look back at him. His hand was still out, slowly I passed it over to\nhim, keeping my eyes on him till he dropped it into the baby seat of the\ntrolley where I could see it clearly. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky I love you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cWell I love\ncheese.\u201d I had almost gotten to the end of the aisle when Harry snuck up behind\nme his hands tickling my sides.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>I laughed hard,\ntrying to twist out of his hold but he just looped his arms around my waist completely\nto pull me into him, his lips silencing my laugh. He kissed me heavily, right\nin the middle of the grocery store despite his own words to keep PDA\nnon-existent, his hands sliding from my hips to cup my ass in his hands.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cI love you,\u201d he\nwhispered against my lips, still caressing them lightly with his own.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cI love you too,\nthough I think you made me pee a little.\u201d Harry laughed lightly and I crossed\nmy legs a little, trying to fight off laughing again.</i></p><p>I chuckled as I slipped the new tub of cheese into my\nbasket. Somehow Harry and I had become closer after the last few weekends. I\nthought that we were close before but somehow after one night, with love\ndeclarations and some great sex, we were like one. I couldn\u2019t explain but I had\nnever felt so right. My life had never felt so perfect and moving in the right\ndirection despite the little detour of Nora. I felt a way that I never had with\nLuke. I had never been even a fraction close to real love with Luke now that I\nknew what it was like to truly love Harry.</p><p>I sighed deeply as I continued up the aisles. Harry was\nleaving for a few weeks and I had already felt so lost just thinking about him going.\nHe was sat on my couch at home talking over some last-minute things with Jeff\nbut already I missed him so much. He was also a little annoyed that I wasn\u2019t\ngoing to go with him on the next two legs of the tour but Australia seemed a\nlittle too far away if something were to go wrong.</p><p>I would be fine without him. I had Anne and Gemma in\nLondon with me and Grace every few weeks when she flew back from New York, but\nthey didn\u2019t compare to Harry. Harry was always the one I talked to. For years\nhe was the one that I called first when I just needed to talk. Even when I was\nwith Luke I would rather talk to Harry. </p><p>When I got home for the hospital after my parents died I\nleft Luke asleep in my bed, snoring his head off while I snuck downstairs,\nHarry\u2019s number already dialled on my phone. I sat outside talking to him on my\nback deck until the sun rose behind the trees. Then I didn\u2019t think it was a bad\nthing but now I realised if it was Harry that he been in my bed that night and\nnot Luke, he wouldn\u2019t have fallen asleep, he would have stayed awake peppering\nmy neck with kisses and letting me talk until I fell asleep in his arms. </p><p>\u201cEvie,\u201d the voice was soft, the gentlest tone I had ever\nheard leave his mouth, but the single word was still laced with shock.</p><p>My chest tightened incredibly and I had to reach out my\nhand to steady myself on one of the shelves. I knew that voice, it was a voice\nthat I loved and still leaves me trembling at the sound. I took in a deep shaky\nbreath, fighting through the painful lump in my throat and turned to look at\nLuke standing a few feet away from me. </p><p>Luke was staring at my belly that was very prominent and\nstood out with the pink floral tunic that fell over it softly. He was breathing\nheavily, hand held out towards me, much like Harry\u2019s was a few days ago. Harry\u2019s\nhand was held out with a devilish smirk that met his eyes with a glint, it made\nme feel hot and bothered and ready to jump his bones. Luke\u2019s hand did the\nopposite. My heart was hammering against my chest as I looked down at his hand,\nhis jaw was tense and I could see behind his eyes that he was doing the math. </p><p>Finally, Luke looked up at me, soft ocean blue eyes\nmeeting mine. I couldn\u2019t figure out if he was upset or scared but I knew that I\nwas definitely the latter. \u201cYou\u2019re pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Luke\u2019s words knocked me out of the stupor I was in and I\ndropped the basket down to the floor with a clang drawing the eyes of everybody\nelse in the aisle. A had only come in for milk and it burst open as it slipped\nfrom the basket. My eyes stung with tears that I really didn\u2019t want to feel now\nas I stepped back to avoid the rapidly spreading puddle of milk. I dropped down\nto pick up the other things that I had in my basket but Luke stepped in the way\nand knocked my hands backwards quickly, picking up the items while a staff\nmember came over to help clean up the spill.</p><p>My breath was shaky as I stepped back away while Luke was\noccupied, apologising profusely to the staff member. I shouldn\u2019t have been\nwalking away from him but my legs were walking towards the door on instinct. I\nneeded to talk this through with him, he could be Nora\u2019s dad and although I\ndidn\u2019t like the idea of it I wouldn\u2019t keep Nora away from him. But I didn\u2019t\nwant to be dealing with this now or in the middle of a grocery store with all\nthe people around, it was lunch time and busier then when Harry and I normally popped\nin together. </p><p>My hands tightened into fists around the soft material of\nmy blouse as I fought the tears that were still lingering at the back of my\neyes, fighting to be set free. I was yet to have any tears slip out but I\nfought them back as well as I could have because I didn\u2019t want to cry over Luke\nanymore, I had shed to many tears for that man.</p><p>\u201cEvie, stop.\u201d Luke hurriedly caught up to me and gently\ngrabbed my arm and pulled me back. I spun into him, the big bump of my belly\nhitting his stomach and I jolted back away from as if he had thrown a glass of\nscolding water on me. Luke released my arm with my actions but his eyes were\nstill glued to my belly in a state of surprise. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you call me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to.\u201d My arms circled around my belly\nprotectively. Luke wouldn\u2019t hurt me, at least not physically but I felt like I\nwas about to have a massive anxiety attack at the front door of the grocery\nstore.</p><p>Luke raised his hand, pinching the bridge of his nose,\neyes squeezing shut. It was something I had seen Harry do since the beginning\nof the tour whenever Jeff said something to him and he was just too tired to\nproperly process it. There had always been a lot of similarities between Harry\nand Luke and I felt like they were hitting me hard and right in the face.</p><p>They were both always so soft and caring towards me. I\nhad felt so loved and safe with the both of them. They held me when I was sad\nand talked me through so many of my toughest times. No -matter how good Luke\nwas to me, Harry was always just one step ahead of him which was why I was more\ndrawn to talk to him and why Luke never really liked Harry.</p><p>\u201cI know I made a mistake Evie but please don\u2019t punish me\nlike this.\u201d He looked really hurt as his eyes moved over my belly. He stepped\ncloser to me, hand stretching out again but I stepped out of his reach, I\ndidn\u2019t want to feel his hands on my belly.</p><p>For the smallest second, I was glad that it was hurting\nhim I wanted him to feel pain. I had hurt for months after what he did to me\nand it was only recently that I had began to feel like I was getting over it\nand he barges back into my life and dares to play me as the bad guy in all this.\nSo, for one fraction of a second, I was extremely proud of the crack I saw in\nhis strong exterior because he deserved it.</p><p>It was only one small second that was ended with a hard\nkick to the bottom of my belly where my hand was sat. I shook my head from the\nthoughts, I just needed to move on from all this, lingering on my hatred of\nLuke was not moving on. \u201cI can\u2019t do this Luke. Not now, it\u2019s too much.\u201d</p><p>Turning away from Luke I walked to my car my hands\nshaking as I dug through my handbag to find my keys. Everybody was staring at\nme, eyes soft as I walked away from him, there stares were sympathetic and I\nwanted to curl up under the pressure of the looks, it couldn\u2019t have been as bad\nas what Luke felt with the few glares he was receiving. </p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t keep my baby away from me.\u201d Luke said strongly\nfrom behind me drawing all the eyes to him. Now everybody was glaring at him\nand they were whispering back and forth. I felt a little reassured to know he wouldn\u2019t\ndo anything to be with audience.</p><p>My steps faltered at the small threat that was laced\nthrough his voice. I felt sickness turning through my stomach which I hadn\u2019t\nfelt since my first trimester.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, I pushed the sickening feeling down\nas my hand finally found my keys and I got to the driver side door of my car. My\nhands were still trembling as I got into the driver\u2019s seat, all of me was trembling\nwith what just happened. Out of the corner of my eye I could see that Luke was\nstill stood near the entrance of the store and he was watching me closely.</p><p>Luke\u2019s eyes had usually looked at me so softly and with\nso much care but now his strong stare and tight jaw was intimidating. I felt as\nif I was on display in a museum under his blue eyes.</p><p>There were only a few things I had come to get, a quick\npop in and back out of the store but it almost felt like I had spent a year in\nbattle. That one five-minute interaction felt worse than the entire week after\nour break up. My heart was still beating erratically and Nora was moving like\ncrazy in my belly, the interaction had upset me so much she could feel it as\nwell.</p><p>My hands were still shaking terribly as I pulled into my garage\nnext to Harry\u2019s range rover but Nora\u2019s movements had calmed to gentle kicks and\npushes against my belly. I still hadn\u2019t cried yet but I could feel the tears\ndangerously persistent at the back of my eyes. Coming into the warmth and\nsafety of my house and hearing Harry, Grace and Jeff\u2019s voices talking without\nany worry a few rooms away made the dam that I had held back break loose.</p><p>The door to the garage slammed shut behind me and I jumped\na mile high at the sharp sound. I didn\u2019t feel right. I felt as if I was on\nanother planet completely and no matter what words I continuously told myself I\ncouldn\u2019t settle the nerves rattling through my chest and shaking through my\nhands. I couldn\u2019t stop my hands from shaking.</p><p>My bag slipped from my arm and to the warm wooden floors\nwith a gentle thud. Desperately my hand reached out to grab the nearest thing I\ncould get my fingers around so I didn\u2019t follow my bag into a scattered mess on\nthe floor.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so, so sorry. I couldn\u2019t tell who I was apologising\nto. Luke, Harry, Nora, my parents or even myself I could have apologised to all\nof them so I just kept repeating it. If I kept apologising then maybe\neverything would be okay. I needed everything to be okay because I couldn\u2019t\nbring Nora into a world like this.</p><p>\u201cEvie?\u201d Harry said from the other room. \u201cAre you home?\u201d\nHis voice both equally laced with worry and confusion.</p><p>I fought to get some words past my lips, anything, to acknowledge\nhim, anything I could get out so I could make him know that I\u2019m here. I wanted\nto hug myself into his chest and bury myself into the safety that he always provides\nme. But instead I was stuck in the entrance hall of my house chocking on my\nwords. The only sound I could properly get out was a strangled sob.</p><p>\u201cEvie,\u201d Harry repeated again this time the worry outweighing\nthe confusion ten times more.</p><p>I heard the sound of a guitar being sat down on a table\nthen the hurried footsteps of numerous people echoing against the wooden floor.\nMy blurred, stinging eyes saw Harry first, he muttered a quick \u2018shit\u2019 as he\nquickly crossed the room, arms already out stretched to catch me if I fell to\nthe floor. </p><p>The moment Harry was close enough I released my tight\nhold from around the doorframe and threw myself into his arms, mine locked\naround his neck and pulled myself against him and into his warmth as strongly\nas I could. My sobs were muffled against his black tour hoodie that smelt so\nstrongly of him, I took deep breathes of the intoxicating smell in, trying to\ncomfort myself.</p><p>Harry\u2019s hands slid over my hips, my belly, my back,\neverywhere, anywhere he could get his hands, he was massaging my skin. His warm\nexploring hands were looking for whatever was hurting me, trying to find a way\nto make it stop because he hated seeing me cry. But he couldn\u2019t stop the pain I\nfelt on the inside with just his hands.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, what hurts?\u201d He whispered into my ear,\npeppering soft kisses against my forehead as he tugged me as close as possible\nbut my belly was already pressed tightly against his and I couldn\u2019t get any\ncloser much to my dislike.</p><p>\u201cI want to do the paternity test now.\u201d My hands dug into\nhis hoodie with my words and I buried my face deeper into the material to let\nit soak up my tears.</p><p>Harry tensed with my words and I swear that I heard the\nstutter of his heartbeat underneath my ear despite the layers of warmth he had\non. He slipped his hand up to the back of my neck and gave it a soft squeeze as\nhe pressed a small kiss to the side of my head. </p><p>\u201cBreathe for me Evie.\u201d Harry\u2019s voice was tight as he to\ntried force as much sweetness as he could into the sound. He was angry. I could\nfeel it vibrating off him in scorching waves. I didn\u2019t even have to say Luke\u2019s\nname and he knew that must have been what had set me off. \u201cCome on breath. Nora\ncan\u2019t have her mummy so stressed out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants her.\u201d I whispered trying to get a decent amount\nof air into my lungs like he had said but I couldn\u2019t. I had to relax first\nbefore I could think of getting my breathing straight.</p><p>All I wanted was to be here for Nora, she was my main\npriority. I couldn\u2019t be here for her wholly if I was too caught up trying to\nmove on from Luke. I still hadn\u2019t entirely gotten over him the first time and\nnow he was coming smashing back into my life like a wrecking ball, destroying\nthe feeble walls I had built to protect myself.</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t take her from you Evie. Not anytime soon the\nbest he could do is get visitation, a few hours every week. They won\u2019t take a\nnewborn from her mother.\u201d My chest tightened at the words and I groaned into\nHarry\u2019s chest. I knew he was right but it wasn\u2019t what I wanted to hear right\nnow.</p><p>\u201cI want her to be yours.\u201d Drawing back, I looked up at\nhim, my eyes still blurred and nose a little sniffly. </p><p>Harry squeezed my neck again and smiled caringly. \u201cSo, do\nI Eve\u2019s. So do I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to be so angry with me when he finds out you\ncould be the father.\u201d I groaned and ran a hand over my forehead before\nburrowing back against his chest, my eyes flicking up to watch him from\nunderneath my wet lashes.</p><p>Luke never really liked Harry, almost despised him,\nbecause he always thought that he was flirting with me \u2013 which maybe he did a\nbit but that was beside the point. Whenever Harry was around Luke had an arm\naround my shoulders and was dragging me against his side, glaring over the top\nof my head in the direction of wherever Harry was stood. I couldn\u2019t blame Harry\nfor not liking Luke but over the last few months, I also couldn\u2019t blame Luke\nfor feeling threatened by Harry but I would have never betrayed my loyalty to\nLuke and went to Harry behind Luke\u2019s back while we were together. I would have\nnever cheated on him.</p><p>Harry\u2019s jaw ticked, hand tightening around my neck while\nthe other twitched over my hip. \u201cYou never cheated on him Evie. We didn\u2019t do\nanything until the two of you were broken up. He has no reason to be angry with\nyou after what he did to you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t want you to leave now.\u201d I whimpered.</p><p>It was only a few weeks until I had him back and could\ncuddle him close into my arms again but it felt like it was going to be an\neternity now. And when I did get him back it wouldn\u2019t be for long before I said\ngoodbye to him again for another few weeks. How did Anne send him off on his\nfirst tour and every tour after that, it was to hard to comprehend him leaving\neven if it was for a short time span. \u00a0</p><p>Harry sighed, his hands massaging up and down my back\nagain. \u201cWill facetime you every day. Want to see your belly grow.\u201d He kissed\nover my neck as his hands weaselled there way beneath my blouse and caressing\nover my hips. \u201cWe should go have a nice warm bath together to relax.\u201d</p><p>.-.-.-.</p><p>\u201cI bought something for Nora today.\u201d Harry said as he\nclimbed up onto the bed at my feet.</p><p>His hair was still wet from the bath and curling a bit\nmore around his ears but he looked warm in his tracksuit pants and a different\nhoodie because I had taken his tour hoodie. He had my bottle of moisturiser in\nhis hands and a white little box that was a mystery to me. Dropping the items\ndown he took my legs and slung them over his, scoching down so he was sat\nbetween them, his hands quickly pushing his hoodie up so he could see my bump. </p><p>I felt much better after the bath with Harry, he had put\nlavender oils in the warm water and it worked perfectly against all the hurt in\nmy muscles and the worry in my chest. Having Harry sat behind me was also a\ngreat help, his rough fingers dancing patterns in the bubble suds across my\nbelly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, eyeing the little box sat near my hip. I\nstill couldn\u2019t tell what the picture on it was. God he better not have gotten\nme a vibrator.</p><p>He smirked at me quickly before grabbing the box, as he opened\nit the contents fell out on the bed with a little rustle. It was two, little\ndiscs with a cord connected to them and I smiled at him realising what exactly\nit was that he had bought. Definitely not a vibrator. He had a cute little\nfrown on his face as he untangled the chords and read through the instructions\nquickly before throwing them to the side.</p><p>\u201cAdam was telling me he used to play music when Emi was\npregnant with Silver and Spike\u201d He said as he stuck the two little discs to\neither side of my belly. \u201cSo I went googleing and found these so Nora can\nlisten to me even when she\u2019s not joining us on tour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if she wants to listen to Lady Gaga. Maybe \u2018born\nthis way\u2019.\u201d I raised my eyebrows at him in jest as I watched him find his phone\nand plug the cord in to it. </p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019d be happy with her anyway she\u2019s born but she\nneeds to hear her daddy\u2019s voice.\u201d A big smile crossed my lips hearing him refer\nto himself as daddy, Nora\u2019s daddy.</p><p>The room was quiet until I heard the soft beginning\nguitar strums of sweet creature coming for the two little discs. The sound was muted\nand the little discs vibrated a little against my skin. Harry smiled at my\nbelly, hands caressing the sides of my protruding belly around the discs.</p><p>Dropping my hands down I linked my fingers with Harry\u2019s.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to miss you so much.\u201d</p><p>Harry smiled sadly fingers circling my belly while his thumb\nrun over the back of my hand. \u201cIs she kicking?\u201d he asked instead of\nacknowledging what I said. </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not kicking, but she\u2019s moving.\u201d She was rolling\naround a bit which she normally wasn\u2019t at this time of day. \u201cYou woke her up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to come with me? I can get\nyou a last-minute flight.\u201d He looked close to tears as he slumped down next to\nme, quickly cuddling me close, the soft muted sound of sweet creature still\nplaying through the little discs.</p><p>Harry flew out tomorrow and as much as I did want to go\nwith him I knew it wasn\u2019t practical even if I wasn\u2019t six months pregnant. Sighing\nI twisted so I could lean against his chest and get the weight off my back.\nHarry sighed as well and reached over to hold my belly again, he knew the\nanswer before he even asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he stretched out. \u201cI\u2019ll miss you too.\u201d</p></p>",

I felt much more pressured and aware of what I was putting in\nmy body and passing on to Nora. Albeit it was much, much easier when I didn&rsquo;t\nhave Harry two steps behind me reminding me that I couldn&rsquo;t eat whatever I set\nmy eyes on.</p><p>We always made our trips to the grocery store early in\nthe morning, when the aisles were dead and the only people lingering were the\nfew other early risers and the staff who looked like they wished they were\nstill at home in their warm beds. It made it easier so we weren&rsquo;t pictured by\nfans or any paparazzi. </p><p>My pregnancy was still a secret between us and our\nclosest friends and family. It was a surprise because I had been in the crowd at\nall of his European shows and there were a number of pictures being shared of\nme being there, curious as to why I was at so many shows and what was going on\nbetween us, but no one had commented on my belly. I had managed to hide it beneath\nloose dark shirts and cardigans and the dark arena also massively helped but\nthere was still that one perfectly timed picture where the bump was quite\nvisible and there were a few rumours that were quickly overshadowed by\nsomething Harry had done on stage that night.</p><p>Picking up a little tub of a cheese dip from the fridge I\nsmiled at the fond memory the spurted at the front of my mind.</p><p><i>Harry pulled the\ncold cheese dip from my hand and put it back into the fridge, vehemently\nignoring the glare I shot at him. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t eat that. It&rsquo;s bad for Nora.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Leaning forward I\npicked it back up and swerved away from Harry and his big hands as he tried to\ntake it from me again, a daring smirk stretching his beautiful pink lips. He\npressed himself up against my back, the warmth from his body somehow seeping\nthrough my jacket and against my skin. The heat reminded me of what he had\nwoken me up with only an hour ago and I felt my cheeks erupt with warmth.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Put the cheese\ndown.&rdquo; He murmured into my ear, teeth nipping lightly as he squeezed my hips.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Ignoring the\nscolding heat of him I lifted the little tub of cheese up and put my finger on\none of the ingredients displayed on the packaging and held it up close to him\nso he could see it. &ldquo;Pasteurised milk. It&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Evie,&rdquo; Harry\nfrowned against my ear and tried to grab it from me again but I twisted out of\nhis reach and clutched the cool cheese to my chest in protection. I wanted\ncheese and I was going to have it. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s still not healthy.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pregnant and\nhungry. Don&rsquo;t mess with my cheese.&rdquo; He shook his head and smiled loving at me,\nhand reaching out to take the cheese so he could put it in the trolley for me. </i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Shaking my head, I stuck my tongue out and kept walking up the aisle, one\nhand holding my cheese to my chest while the other caressed over my belly as\nNora started to kick. I heard Harry chuckle quietly. &ldquo;Swear I won&rsquo;t put it back\nEve&rsquo;s. Just don&rsquo;t want you to make it warm holding onto it.&rdquo; Pursing my lips, I\nturned to look back at him. His hand was still out, slowly I passed it over to\nhim, keeping my eyes on him till he dropped it into the baby seat of the\ntrolley where I could see it clearly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re lucky I love you.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Well I love\ncheese.&rdquo; I had almost gotten to the end of the aisle when Harry snuck up behind\nme his hands tickling my sides.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>I laughed hard,\ntrying to twist out of his hold but he just looped his arms around my waist completely\nto pull me into him, his lips silencing my laugh. He kissed me heavily, right\nin the middle of the grocery store despite his own words to keep PDA\nnon-existent, his hands sliding from my hips to cup my ass in his hands.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; he\nwhispered against my lips, still caressing them lightly with his own.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I love you too,\nthough I think you made me pee a little.&rdquo; Harry laughed lightly and I crossed\nmy legs a little, trying to fight off laughing again.</i></p><p>I chuckled as I slipped the new tub of cheese into my\nbasket. Somehow Harry and I had become closer after the last few weekends. I\nthought that we were close before but somehow after one night, with love\ndeclarations and some great sex, we were like one. I couldn&rsquo;t explain but I had\nnever felt so right. My life had never felt so perfect and moving in the right\ndirection despite the little detour of Nora. I felt a way that I never had with\nLuke. I had never been even a fraction close to real love with Luke now that I\nknew what it was like to truly love Harry.</p><p>I sighed deeply as I continued up the aisles. Harry was\nleaving for a few weeks and I had already felt so lost just thinking about him going.\nHe was sat on my couch at home talking over some last-minute things with Jeff\nbut already I missed him so much. He was also a little annoyed that I wasn&rsquo;t\ngoing to go with him on the next two legs of the tour but Australia seemed a\nlittle too far away if something were to go wrong.</p><p>I would be fine without him. I had Anne and Gemma in\nLondon with me and Grace every few weeks when she flew back from New York, but\nthey didn&rsquo;t compare to Harry. Harry was always the one I talked to. For years\nhe was the one that I called first when I just needed to talk. Even when I was\nwith Luke I would rather talk to Harry. </p><p>When I got home for the hospital after my parents died I\nleft Luke asleep in my bed, snoring his head off while I snuck downstairs,\nHarry&rsquo;s number already dialled on my phone. I sat outside talking to him on my\nback deck until the sun rose behind the trees. Then I didn&rsquo;t think it was a bad\nthing but now I realised if it was Harry that he been in my bed that night and\nnot Luke, he wouldn&rsquo;t have fallen asleep, he would have stayed awake peppering\nmy neck with kisses and letting me talk until I fell asleep in his arms. </p><p>&ldquo;Evie,&rdquo; the voice was soft, the gentlest tone I had ever\nheard leave his mouth, but the single word was still laced with shock.</p><p>My chest tightened incredibly and I had to reach out my\nhand to steady myself on one of the shelves. I knew that voice, it was a voice\nthat I loved and still leaves me trembling at the sound. I took in a deep shaky\nbreath, fighting through the painful lump in my throat and turned to look at\nLuke standing a few feet away from me. </p><p>Luke was staring at my belly that was very prominent and\nstood out with the pink floral tunic that fell over it softly. He was breathing\nheavily, hand held out towards me, much like Harry&rsquo;s was a few days ago. Harry&rsquo;s\nhand was held out with a devilish smirk that met his eyes with a glint, it made\nme feel hot and bothered and ready to jump his bones. Luke&rsquo;s hand did the\nopposite. My heart was hammering against my chest as I looked down at his hand,\nhis jaw was tense and I could see behind his eyes that he was doing the math. </p><p>Finally, Luke looked up at me, soft ocean blue eyes\nmeeting mine. I couldn&rsquo;t figure out if he was upset or scared but I knew that I\nwas definitely the latter. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re pregnant.&rdquo;</p><p>Luke&rsquo;s words knocked me out of the stupor I was in and I\ndropped the basket down to the floor with a clang drawing the eyes of everybody\nelse in the aisle. A had only come in for milk and it burst open as it slipped\nfrom the basket. My eyes stung with tears that I really didn&rsquo;t want to feel now\nas I stepped back to avoid the rapidly spreading puddle of milk. I dropped down\nto pick up the other things that I had in my basket but Luke stepped in the way\nand knocked my hands backwards quickly, picking up the items while a staff\nmember came over to help clean up the spill.</p><p>My breath was shaky as I stepped back away while Luke was\noccupied, apologising profusely to the staff member. I shouldn&rsquo;t have been\nwalking away from him but my legs were walking towards the door on instinct. I\nneeded to talk this through with him, he could be Nora&rsquo;s dad and although I\ndidn&rsquo;t like the idea of it I wouldn&rsquo;t keep Nora away from him. But I didn&rsquo;t\nwant to be dealing with this now or in the middle of a grocery store with all\nthe people around, it was lunch time and busier then when Harry and I normally popped\nin together. </p><p>My hands tightened into fists around the soft material of\nmy blouse as I fought the tears that were still lingering at the back of my\neyes, fighting to be set free. I was yet to have any tears slip out but I\nfought them back as well as I could have because I didn&rsquo;t want to cry over Luke\nanymore, I had shed to many tears for that man.</p><p>&ldquo;Evie, stop.&rdquo; Luke hurriedly caught up to me and gently\ngrabbed my arm and pulled me back. I spun into him, the big bump of my belly\nhitting his stomach and I jolted back away from as if he had thrown a glass of\nscolding water on me. Luke released my arm with my actions but his eyes were\nstill glued to my belly in a state of surprise. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you call me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo; My arms circled around my belly\nprotectively. Luke wouldn&rsquo;t hurt me, at least not physically but I felt like I\nwas about to have a massive anxiety attack at the front door of the grocery\nstore.</p><p>Luke raised his hand, pinching the bridge of his nose,\neyes squeezing shut. It was something I had seen Harry do since the beginning\nof the tour whenever Jeff said something to him and he was just too tired to\nproperly process it. There had always been a lot of similarities between Harry\nand Luke and I felt like they were hitting me hard and right in the face.</p><p>They were both always so soft and caring towards me. I\nhad felt so loved and safe with the both of them. They held me when I was sad\nand talked me through so many of my toughest times. No -matter how good Luke\nwas to me, Harry was always just one step ahead of him which was why I was more\ndrawn to talk to him and why Luke never really liked Harry.</p><p>&ldquo;I know I made a mistake Evie but please don&rsquo;t punish me\nlike this.&rdquo; He looked really hurt as his eyes moved over my belly. He stepped\ncloser to me, hand stretching out again but I stepped out of his reach, I\ndidn&rsquo;t want to feel his hands on my belly.</p><p>For the smallest second, I was glad that it was hurting\nhim I wanted him to feel pain. I had hurt for months after what he did to me\nand it was only recently that I had began to feel like I was getting over it\nand he barges back into my life and dares to play me as the bad guy in all this.\nSo, for one fraction of a second, I was extremely proud of the crack I saw in\nhis strong exterior because he deserved it.</p><p>It was only one small second that was ended with a hard\nkick to the bottom of my belly where my hand was sat. I shook my head from the\nthoughts, I just needed to move on from all this, lingering on my hatred of\nLuke was not moving on. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do this Luke. Not now, it&rsquo;s too much.&rdquo;</p><p>Turning away from Luke I walked to my car my hands\nshaking as I dug through my handbag to find my keys. Everybody was staring at\nme, eyes soft as I walked away from him, there stares were sympathetic and I\nwanted to curl up under the pressure of the looks, it couldn&rsquo;t have been as bad\nas what Luke felt with the few glares he was receiving. </p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t keep my baby away from me.&rdquo; Luke said strongly\nfrom behind me drawing all the eyes to him. Now everybody was glaring at him\nand they were whispering back and forth. I felt a little reassured to know he wouldn&rsquo;t\ndo anything to be with audience.</p><p>My steps faltered at the small threat that was laced\nthrough his voice. I felt sickness turning through my stomach which I hadn&rsquo;t\nfelt since my first trimester.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, I pushed the sickening feeling down\nas my hand finally found my keys and I got to the driver side door of my car. My\nhands were still trembling as I got into the driver&rsquo;s seat, all of me was trembling\nwith what just happened. Out of the corner of my eye I could see that Luke was\nstill stood near the entrance of the store and he was watching me closely.</p><p>Luke&rsquo;s eyes had usually looked at me so softly and with\nso much care but now his strong stare and tight jaw was intimidating. I felt as\nif I was on display in a museum under his blue eyes.</p><p>There were only a few things I had come to get, a quick\npop in and back out of the store but it almost felt like I had spent a year in\nbattle. That one five-minute interaction felt worse than the entire week after\nour break up. My heart was still beating erratically and Nora was moving like\ncrazy in my belly, the interaction had upset me so much she could feel it as\nwell.</p><p>My hands were still shaking terribly as I pulled into my garage\nnext to Harry&rsquo;s range rover but Nora&rsquo;s movements had calmed to gentle kicks and\npushes against my belly. I still hadn&rsquo;t cried yet but I could feel the tears\ndangerously persistent at the back of my eyes. Coming into the warmth and\nsafety of my house and hearing Harry, Grace and Jeff&rsquo;s voices talking without\nany worry a few rooms away made the dam that I had held back break loose.</p><p>The door to the garage slammed shut behind me and I jumped\na mile high at the sharp sound. I didn&rsquo;t feel right. I felt as if I was on\nanother planet completely and no matter what words I continuously told myself I\ncouldn&rsquo;t settle the nerves rattling through my chest and shaking through my\nhands. I couldn&rsquo;t stop my hands from shaking.</p><p>My bag slipped from my arm and to the warm wooden floors\nwith a gentle thud. Desperately my hand reached out to grab the nearest thing I\ncould get my fingers around so I didn&rsquo;t follow my bag into a scattered mess on\nthe floor.</p><p>I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m so, so sorry. I couldn&rsquo;t tell who I was apologising\nto. Luke, Harry, Nora, my parents or even myself I could have apologised to all\nof them so I just kept repeating it. If I kept apologising then maybe\neverything would be okay. I needed everything to be okay because I couldn&rsquo;t\nbring Nora into a world like this.</p><p>&ldquo;Evie?&rdquo; Harry said from the other room. &ldquo;Are you home?&rdquo;\nHis voice both equally laced with worry and confusion.</p><p>I fought to get some words past my lips, anything, to acknowledge\nhim, anything I could get out so I could make him know that I&rsquo;m here. I wanted\nto hug myself into his chest and bury myself into the safety that he always provides\nme. But instead I was stuck in the entrance hall of my house chocking on my\nwords. The only sound I could properly get out was a strangled sob.</p><p>&ldquo;Evie,&rdquo; Harry repeated again this time the worry outweighing\nthe confusion ten times more.</p><p>I heard the sound of a guitar being sat down on a table\nthen the hurried footsteps of numerous people echoing against the wooden floor.\nMy blurred, stinging eyes saw Harry first, he muttered a quick &lsquo;shit&rsquo; as he\nquickly crossed the room, arms already out stretched to catch me if I fell to\nthe floor. </p><p>The moment Harry was close enough I released my tight\nhold from around the doorframe and threw myself into his arms, mine locked\naround his neck and pulled myself against him and into his warmth as strongly\nas I could. My sobs were muffled against his black tour hoodie that smelt so\nstrongly of him, I took deep breathes of the intoxicating smell in, trying to\ncomfort myself.</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s hands slid over my hips, my belly, my back,\neverywhere, anywhere he could get his hands, he was massaging my skin. His warm\nexploring hands were looking for whatever was hurting me, trying to find a way\nto make it stop because he hated seeing me cry. But he couldn&rsquo;t stop the pain I\nfelt on the inside with just his hands.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, what hurts?&rdquo; He whispered into my ear,\npeppering soft kisses against my forehead as he tugged me as close as possible\nbut my belly was already pressed tightly against his and I couldn&rsquo;t get any\ncloser much to my dislike.</p><p>&ldquo;I want to do the paternity test now.&rdquo; My hands dug into\nhis hoodie with my words and I buried my face deeper into the material to let\nit soak up my tears.</p><p>Harry tensed with my words and I swear that I heard the\nstutter of his heartbeat underneath my ear despite the layers of warmth he had\non. He slipped his hand up to the back of my neck and gave it a soft squeeze as\nhe pressed a small kiss to the side of my head. </p><p>&ldquo;Breathe for me Evie.&rdquo; Harry&rsquo;s voice was tight as he to\ntried force as much sweetness as he could into the sound. He was angry. I could\nfeel it vibrating off him in scorching waves. I didn&rsquo;t even have to say Luke&rsquo;s\nname and he knew that must have been what had set me off. &ldquo;Come on breath. Nora\ncan&rsquo;t have her mummy so stressed out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He wants her.&rdquo; I whispered trying to get a decent amount\nof air into my lungs like he had said but I couldn&rsquo;t. I had to relax first\nbefore I could think of getting my breathing straight.</p><p>All I wanted was to be here for Nora, she was my main\npriority. I couldn&rsquo;t be here for her wholly if I was too caught up trying to\nmove on from Luke. I still hadn&rsquo;t entirely gotten over him the first time and\nnow he was coming smashing back into my life like a wrecking ball, destroying\nthe feeble walls I had built to protect myself.</p><p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t take her from you Evie. Not anytime soon the\nbest he could do is get visitation, a few hours every week. They won&rsquo;t take a\nnewborn from her mother.&rdquo; My chest tightened at the words and I groaned into\nHarry&rsquo;s chest. I knew he was right but it wasn&rsquo;t what I wanted to hear right\nnow.</p><p>&ldquo;I want her to be yours.&rdquo; Drawing back, I looked up at\nhim, my eyes still blurred and nose a little sniffly. </p><p>Harry squeezed my neck again and smiled caringly. &ldquo;So, do\nI Eve&rsquo;s. So do I.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to be so angry with me when he finds out you\ncould be the father.&rdquo; I groaned and ran a hand over my forehead before\nburrowing back against his chest, my eyes flicking up to watch him from\nunderneath my wet lashes.</p><p>Luke never really liked Harry, almost despised him,\nbecause he always thought that he was flirting with me &ndash; which maybe he did a\nbit but that was beside the point. Whenever Harry was around Luke had an arm\naround my shoulders and was dragging me against his side, glaring over the top\nof my head in the direction of wherever Harry was stood. I couldn&rsquo;t blame Harry\nfor not liking Luke but over the last few months, I also couldn&rsquo;t blame Luke\nfor feeling threatened by Harry but I would have never betrayed my loyalty to\nLuke and went to Harry behind Luke&rsquo;s back while we were together. I would have\nnever cheated on him.</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s jaw ticked, hand tightening around my neck while\nthe other twitched over my hip. &ldquo;You never cheated on him Evie. We didn&rsquo;t do\nanything until the two of you were broken up. He has no reason to be angry with\nyou after what he did to you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t want you to leave now.&rdquo; I whimpered.</p><p>It was only a few weeks until I had him back and could\ncuddle him close into my arms again but it felt like it was going to be an\neternity now. And when I did get him back it wouldn&rsquo;t be for long before I said\ngoodbye to him again for another few weeks. How did Anne send him off on his\nfirst tour and every tour after that, it was to hard to comprehend him leaving\neven if it was for a short time span. &nbsp;</p><p>Harry sighed, his hands massaging up and down my back\nagain. &ldquo;Will facetime you every day. Want to see your belly grow.&rdquo; He kissed\nover my neck as his hands weaselled there way beneath my blouse and caressing\nover my hips. &ldquo;We should go have a nice warm bath together to relax.&rdquo;</p><p>.-.-.-.</p><p>&ldquo;I bought something for Nora today.&rdquo; Harry said as he\nclimbed up onto the bed at my feet.</p><p>His hair was still wet from the bath and curling a bit\nmore around his ears but he looked warm in his tracksuit pants and a different\nhoodie because I had taken his tour hoodie. He had my bottle of moisturiser in\nhis hands and a white little box that was a mystery to me. Dropping the items\ndown he took my legs and slung them over his, scoching down so he was sat\nbetween them, his hands quickly pushing his hoodie up so he could see my bump. </p><p>I felt much better after the bath with Harry, he had put\nlavender oils in the warm water and it worked perfectly against all the hurt in\nmy muscles and the worry in my chest. Having Harry sat behind me was also a\ngreat help, his rough fingers dancing patterns in the bubble suds across my\nbelly.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; I asked, eyeing the little box sat near my hip. I\nstill couldn&rsquo;t tell what the picture on it was. God he better not have gotten\nme a vibrator.</p><p>He smirked at me quickly before grabbing the box, as he opened\nit the contents fell out on the bed with a little rustle. It was two, little\ndiscs with a cord connected to them and I smiled at him realising what exactly\nit was that he had bought. Definitely not a vibrator. He had a cute little\nfrown on his face as he untangled the chords and read through the instructions\nquickly before throwing them to the side.</p><p>&ldquo;Adam was telling me he used to play music when Emi was\npregnant with Silver and Spike&rdquo; He said as he stuck the two little discs to\neither side of my belly. &ldquo;So I went googleing and found these so Nora can\nlisten to me even when she&rsquo;s not joining us on tour.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What if she wants to listen to Lady Gaga. Maybe &lsquo;born\nthis way&rsquo;.&rdquo; I raised my eyebrows at him in jest as I watched him find his phone\nand plug the cord in to it. </p><p>&ldquo;Well I&rsquo;d be happy with her anyway she&rsquo;s born but she\nneeds to hear her daddy&rsquo;s voice.&rdquo; A big smile crossed my lips hearing him refer\nto himself as daddy, Nora&rsquo;s daddy.</p><p>The room was quiet until I heard the soft beginning\nguitar strums of sweet creature coming for the two little discs. The sound was muted\nand the little discs vibrated a little against my skin. Harry smiled at my\nbelly, hands caressing the sides of my protruding belly around the discs.</p><p>Dropping my hands down I linked my fingers with Harry&rsquo;s.\n&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to miss you so much.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry smiled sadly fingers circling my belly while his thumb\nrun over the back of my hand. &ldquo;Is she kicking?&rdquo; he asked instead of\nacknowledging what I said. </p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not kicking, but she&rsquo;s moving.&rdquo; She was rolling\naround a bit which she normally wasn&rsquo;t at this time of day. &ldquo;You woke her up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure you don&rsquo;t want to come with me? I can get\nyou a last-minute flight.&rdquo; He looked close to tears as he slumped down next to\nme, quickly cuddling me close, the soft muted sound of sweet creature still\nplaying through the little discs.</p><p>Harry flew out tomorrow and as much as I did want to go\nwith him I knew it wasn&rsquo;t practical even if I wasn&rsquo;t six months pregnant. Sighing\nI twisted so I could lean against his chest and get the weight off my back.\nHarry sighed as well and reached over to hold my belly again, he knew the\nanswer before he even asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he stretched out. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll miss you too.&rdquo;</p></p>",
