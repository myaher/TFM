He gave her a tight smile.</p>\n\n<p>Steve\u2019s first order was to get back to Wakanda, if the news was right, half of their team would reappear there.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI won\u2019t waste any time.\u201d Steve had promised Tony.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWakanda is the best equipped and Nebula will go to Titan, she\u2019ll bring everyone home. She\u2019ll bring your boy home.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The determination on Steve\u2019s face made Tony start to hope. Maybe he was right. Maybe he could get Peter back.</p>\n\n<p>The hope that flared up in his stomach proved to be too much excitement, he barely had time to move to the nearest bin before he threw up.</p>\n\n<p>Bruce knelt beside him, rubbing a gentle hand down his back, and grabbing him a water bottle from the fridge.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe jet\u2019s leaving in fifteen, Tony. Think you\u2019ll be up for it?\u201d Steve asked the man slumped on the floor, Pepper and Bruce either side. He gave a weak thumbs up, and a grimace.</p>\n\n<p>Pepper wiped the overgrown and untamed curls from Tony\u2019s eyes.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf any of this is getting too much, you tell me straight away, okay?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He nodded into her shoulder.</p>\n\n<p>Bruce and Pepper hauled him to his feet and Tony rolled his head towards Steve.</p>\n\n<p>Steve stood tall, chin tilted down and eyebrows ever so slightly raised, waiting for verbal confirmation.</p>\n\n<p>Tony\u2019s eyes flicked down, looking to see the boy who had been getting him through these past few months, his kid.</p>\n\n<p>Peter stood next to Steve, the lopsided grin Tony loved and missed so much on his face.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got this, now come get me.\u201d And with that he was gone, disappeared into nothing.</p>\n\n<p>Tony stood taller, locking eyes with Steve.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s go get our family back.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>-</p>\n\n<p>The ride was bumpy and it seemed to take forever. The jet was buzzing, full of nerves and anticipation, full of excitement.</p>\n\n<p>They were shown to the labs when they first arrived, wasting no time. Tony was silent, his stomach twisting and underneath his clothing, he was covered in sweat. It could be a trick, a trap.</p>\n\n<p>The only thing keeping him grounded was Pepper\u2019s hand clasped in his.</p>\n\n<p>And then he saw Bucky. James Buchanan Barnes. The man who killed his parents. The reason he was an orphan.</p>\n\n<p>And he walked forwards and practically collapsed into the mans arms.</p>\n\n<p>Bucky was the first victim of the snap, the first to fade away. And he was real.</p>\n\n<p>Tony felt the man breathe, his posture stiff although he didn\u2019t blame him. I\u2019m sure he\u2019d rather be hugging Steve than having this awkward encounter with the man who had tried to kill him a few years ago.</p>\n\n<p>Tony, however, couldn\u2019t quite seem to let go. He needed to know he was real, he was solid and wouldn\u2019t fade away. He\u2019d really come back and Tony could feel the unshed tears fill his eyes. He was so close to having Peter by his side. So close.</p>\n\n<p>Bucky looked at a loss of what to do over Tony\u2019s shoulder, matching the team\u2019s looks of utter bewilderment as the man clung to him.</p>\n\n<p>Bucky\u2019s face softened when Tony managed to stumble back a little, both sharing an intense stare when the solider realised how broken Tony looked.</p>\n\n<p>It wasn\u2019t a moment later as Tony took another step back that Steve almost took Bucky out with the ferocity of his hug.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou look like crap.\u201d Bucky smiled at his best friends tearful face.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYeah, well.\u201d Steve huffed out a breath.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt was the end of the world.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>-</p>\n\n<p>The next few hours were filled with ease, tearful laughter and, from the king, a promised feast when everyone was back safe.</p>\n\n<p>Tony just sat to the side, his leg bobbing up and down in angst. The waiting was almost torture, but that\u2019s all he could do, just wait. Pepper and Rhodey stayed by his side at all times, and although he wasn\u2019t fond of all the babying, he appreciated the company and their distractions.</p>\n\n<p>-</p>\n\n<p>All eyes were on Tony when the jet came into land. He\u2019d scrambled down to the pad when they\u2019d said the jet was coming into view, Rhodey at his side instantly as he\u2019d stumbled into the tables by his bedside.</p>\n\n<p>He stood on the pad now, legs wobbling and hands shaking. He\u2019d already had two panic attacks since being in Wakanda and he couldn\u2019t lose it now, not when he was so close.</p>\n\n<p>The wheels touched down and Tony flinched at the noise the barrier made as the door fell open. He could see Quill, Nebula and the others, then his breath hitched in his throat.</p>\n\n<p>Rhodey loosened his grip on his best friend as he took an unsteady step forward. He could see the tear tracks down Peter\u2019s face evidently, just as new ones started to fall.</p>\n\n<p>Tony\u2019s skin went cold, the hairs on his neck standing up and he swallowed to clear his rapidly drying up throat.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cPete.\u201d He whispered, knowing that the kid would hear him however loud he spoke.</p>\n\n<p>The group watched with aching hearts as the boy Tony had talked about for so long started to run towards him.</p>\n\n<p>Tony took a few more unstable steps until he fell hard on his knees. Peter reached him in seconds, skidding on his own knees into his mentor before being scooped up.</p>\n\n<p>Tony Stark sobbed. He clung his arms around Peter\u2019s back, almost clawing at the boy to keep him in his embrace.</p>\n\n<p>Peter was hugging his arms around Tony so tight it might even leave some bruises.</p>\n\n<p>Tony pulled back and Peter let out a loud whimper, Tony sniffing loudly to stem his crying, even if only for a moment.</p>\n\n<p>He held Peter\u2019s head in his hands, wiping away Peter\u2019s tears and his floppy hair from his eyes.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Tony blurted, taking in hurried gulps of air.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI never t-told you. I- I love you so, so much Peter.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He brushed his thumb over Peter\u2019s cheek and he smiled.</p>\n\n<p>He laughed then and Peter frowned, trying to stifle his own sobbing.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI haven\u2019t- haven\u2019t-\u201c</p>\n\n<p>Another sob wracked through his body and he pulled the boy back to his chest.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cGod I love you kid.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d Peter mumbled against his shoulder, nuzzling his head into the mans neck.</p>\n\n<p>Peter stayed snuggled into Tony\u2019s side, breathing in the man\u2019s scent. He was finally home. He felt Tony pull him in tighter every now and then, making sure this was really happening.</p>\n\n<p>Struggling to tear their eyes away from the pair, the Avengers slowly filtered out. Only a few stayed, waiting to herd both boys back to T\u2019challa\u2019s quarters when they were ready.</p>\n\n<p>Steve approached first when the boys finally stumbled to their feet.</p>\n\n<p>Steve smiled at Peter, sticking out his hand.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s an honour to finally meet you, Peter.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Peter swallowed and twitched out a small smile, face still wet with tears.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cLikewise.\u201d Peter took a couple of steps towards Steve to shake his hand, the loss of contact making Tony shiver. His throat closed up suddenly, hands beginning to shake. He let out a small whine deep in the back of his throat, hands reaching out and pulling the kid back in. Steve took a few steps backwards.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s- it\u2019s alright Mr Stark. I- I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI know, I know.\u201d Tony muttered more to himself than anyone.</p>\n\n<p>Rhodey placed a hand on Tony\u2019s back for a moment.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we head up to Shuri\u2019s labs, Tony.\u201d He spoke softly to the man that was burrowing his face into Peter\u2019s curls.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe can have Peter checked out, make certain everything is okay.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He took a step back when Tony didn\u2019t reply straight away, treating him like a wounded animal and trying not to spook him.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d They heard him mumble.</p>\n\n<p>Steve and Rhodey walked close behind Tony and Peter, Steve watching the pair closely. Tony\u2019s arm was slung around the kid\u2019s middle, keeping him close as if he would lose him again if they lost touch. Pepper and one of T\u2019Challa\u2019s guards lead in front, making their way through to Shuri\u2019s space.</p>\n\n<p>Peter was checked over quickly, Tony almost kicking up a fuss when they told him to wait outside for a moment.</p>\n\n<p>Peter rounded the corner only a few minutes later, bounding into the welcoming arms of his mentor, promising he was fine. Shuri wanted to keep everyone who had been affected by the snap under observation for one night, just to be cautious.</p>\n\n<p>And later that night, when Pepper awoke to find she was alone, she padded down to the medical room, a lump in her throat until she let out a breath of air and smiled.</p>\n\n<p>Tony was in Peter\u2019s medical bed, the boy curled up around his side with Tony\u2019s hand still rested in his hair, both sound asleep.</p>\n\n<p>She leaned against the doorway for a moment before heading back to bed.</p>\n\n<p>A warm breeze pushed its way through her open window and Pepper sighed. It was finally over. The Avengers have won.</p>\n\n<p>-</p>",

He clung his arms around Peter\u2019s back, almost clawing at the boy to keep him in his embrace.</p>\n\n<p>Peter was hugging his arms around Tony so tight it might even leave some bruises.</p>\n\n<p>Tony pulled back and Peter let out a loud whimper, Tony sniffing loudly to stem his crying, even if only for a moment.</p>\n\n<p>He held Peter\u2019s head in his hands, wiping away Peter\u2019s tears and his floppy hair from his eyes.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Tony blurted, taking in hurried gulps of air.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI never t-told you. I- I love you so, so much Peter.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He brushed his thumb over Peter\u2019s cheek and he smiled.</p>\n\n<p>He laughed then and Peter frowned, trying to stifle his own sobbing.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI haven\u2019t- haven\u2019t-\u201c</p>\n\n<p>Another sob wracked through his body and he pulled the boy back to his chest.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cGod I love you kid.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d Peter mumbled against his shoulder, nuzzling his head into the mans neck.</p>\n\n<p>Peter stayed snuggled into Tony\u2019s side, breathing in the man\u2019s scent. He was finally home. He felt Tony pull him in tighter every now and then, making sure this was really happening.</p>\n\n<p>Struggling to tear their eyes away from the pair, the Avengers slowly filtered out. Only a few stayed, waiting to herd both boys back to T\u2019challa\u2019s quarters when they were ready.</p>\n\n<p>Steve approached first when the boys finally stumbled to their feet.</p>\n\n<p>Steve smiled at Peter, sticking out his hand.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s an honour to finally meet you, Peter.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Peter swallowed and twitched out a small smile, face still wet with tears.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cLikewise.\u201d Peter took a couple of steps towards Steve to shake his hand, the loss of contact making Tony shiver. His throat closed up suddenly, hands beginning to shake. He let out a small whine deep in the back of his throat, hands reaching out and pulling the kid back in. Steve took a few steps backwards.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s- it\u2019s alright Mr Stark. I- I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI know, I know.\u201d Tony muttered more to himself than anyone.</p>\n\n<p>Rhodey placed a hand on Tony\u2019s back for a moment.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we head up to Shuri\u2019s labs, Tony.\u201d He spoke softly to the man that was burrowing his face into Peter\u2019s curls.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe can have Peter checked out, make certain everything is okay.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He took a step back when Tony didn\u2019t reply straight away, treating him like a wounded animal and trying not to spook him.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d They heard him mumble.</p>\n\n<p>Steve and Rhodey walked close behind Tony and Peter, Steve watching the pair closely. Tony\u2019s arm was slung around the kid\u2019s middle, keeping him close as if he would lose him again if they lost touch. Pepper and one of T\u2019Challa\u2019s guards lead in front, making their way through to Shuri\u2019s space.</p>\n\n<p>Peter was checked over quickly, Tony almost kicking up a fuss when they told him to wait outside for a moment.</p>\n\n<p>Peter rounded the corner only a few minutes later, bounding into the welcoming arms of his mentor, promising he was fine. Shuri wanted to keep everyone who had been affected by the snap under observation for one night, just to be cautious.</p>\n\n<p>And later that night, when Pepper awoke to find she was alone, she padded down to the medical room, a lump in her throat until she let out a breath of air and smiled.</p>\n\n<p>Tony was in Peter\u2019s medical bed, the boy curled up around his side with Tony\u2019s hand still rested in his hair, both sound asleep.</p>\n\n<p>She leaned against the doorway for a moment before heading back to bed.</p>\n\n<p>A warm breeze pushed its way through her open window and Pepper sighed. It was finally over. The Avengers have won.</p>\n\n<p>-</p>",

Maybe he could get Peter back.</p>\n\n<p>The hope that flared up in his stomach proved to be too much excitement, he barely had time to move to the nearest bin before he threw up.</p>\n\n<p>Bruce knelt beside him, rubbing a gentle hand down his back, and grabbing him a water bottle from the fridge.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe jet\u2019s leaving in fifteen, Tony.

The jet was buzzing, full of nerves and anticipation, full of excitement.</p>\n\n<p>They were shown to the labs when they first arrived, wasting no time. Tony was silent, his stomach twisting and underneath his clothing, he was covered in sweat. It could be a trick, a trap.</p>\n\n<p>The only thing keeping him grounded was Pepper\u2019s hand clasped in his.</p>\n\n<p>And then he saw Bucky. James Buchanan Barnes. The man who killed his parents. The reason he was an orphan.</p>\n\n<p>And he walked forwards and practically collapsed into the mans arms.</p>\n\n<p>Bucky was the first victim of the snap, the first to fade away. And he was real.</p>\n\n<p>Tony felt the man breathe, his posture stiff although he didn\u2019t blame him. I\u2019m sure he\u2019d rather be hugging Steve than having this awkward encounter with the man who had tried to kill him a few years ago.</p>\n\n<p>Tony, however, couldn\u2019t quite seem to let go. He needed to know he was real, he was solid and wouldn\u2019t fade away. He\u2019d really come back and Tony could feel the unshed tears fill his eyes. He was so close to having Peter by his side. So close.</p>\n\n<p>Bucky looked at a loss of what to do over Tony\u2019s shoulder, matching the team\u2019s looks of utter bewilderment as the man clung to him.</p>\n\n<p>Bucky\u2019s face softened when Tony managed to stumble back a little, both sharing an intense stare when the solider realised how broken Tony looked.</p>\n\n<p>It wasn\u2019t a moment later as Tony took another step back that Steve almost took Bucky out with the ferocity of his hug.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou look like crap.\u201d Bucky smiled at his best friends tearful face.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYeah, well.\u201d Steve huffed out a breath.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt was the end of the world.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>-</p>\n\n<p>The next few hours were filled with ease, tearful laughter and, from the king, a promised feast when everyone was back safe.</p>\n\n<p>Tony just sat to the side, his leg bobbing up and down in angst. The waiting was almost torture, but that\u2019s all he could do, just wait. Pepper and Rhodey stayed by his side at all times, and although he wasn\u2019t fond of all the babying, he appreciated the company and their distractions.</p>\n\n<p>-</p>\n\n<p>All eyes were on Tony when the jet came into land. He\u2019d scrambled down to the pad when they\u2019d said the jet was coming into view, Rhodey at his side instantly as he\u2019d stumbled into the tables by his bedside.</p>\n\n<p>He stood on the pad now, legs wobbling and hands shaking. He\u2019d already had two panic attacks since being in Wakanda and he couldn\u2019t lose it now, not when he was so close.</p>\n\n<p>The wheels touched down and Tony flinched at the noise the barrier made as the door fell open.

I- I love you so, so much Peter.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>He brushed his thumb over Peter&rsquo;s cheek and he smiled.</p>\n\n<p>He laughed then and Peter frowned, trying to stifle his own sobbing.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t- haven&rsquo;t-&ldquo;</p>\n\n<p>Another sob wracked through his body and he pulled the boy back to his chest.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;God I love you kid.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I love you too.&rdquo; Peter mumbled against his shoulder, nuzzling his head into the mans neck.</p>\n\n<p>Peter stayed snuggled into Tony&rsquo;s side, breathing in the man&rsquo;s scent. He was finally home. He felt Tony pull him in tighter every now and then, making sure this was really happening.</p>\n\n<p>Struggling to tear their eyes away from the pair, the Avengers slowly filtered out. Only a few stayed, waiting to herd both boys back to T&rsquo;challa&rsquo;s quarters when they were ready.</p>\n\n<p>Steve approached first when the boys finally stumbled to their feet.</p>\n\n<p>Steve smiled at Peter, sticking out his hand.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an honour to finally meet you, Peter.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Peter swallowed and twitched out a small smile, face still wet with tears.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Likewise.&rdquo; Peter took a couple of steps towards Steve to shake his hand, the loss of contact making Tony shiver. His throat closed up suddenly, hands beginning to shake. He let out a small whine deep in the back of his throat, hands reaching out and pulling the kid back in. Steve took a few steps backwards.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Hey, it&rsquo;s- it&rsquo;s alright Mr Stark. I- I&rsquo;m not going anywhere.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I know, I know.&rdquo; Tony muttered more to himself than anyone.</p>\n\n<p>Rhodey placed a hand on Tony&rsquo;s back for a moment.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we head up to Shuri&rsquo;s labs, Tony.&rdquo; He spoke softly to the man that was burrowing his face into Peter&rsquo;s curls.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We can have Peter checked out, make certain everything is okay.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>He took a step back when Tony didn&rsquo;t reply straight away, treating him like a wounded animal and trying not to spook him.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; They heard him mumble.</p>\n\n<p>Steve and Rhodey walked close behind Tony and Peter, Steve watching the pair closely. Tony&rsquo;s arm was slung around the kid&rsquo;s middle, keeping him close as if he would lose him again if they lost touch. Pepper and one of T&rsquo;Challa&rsquo;s guards lead in front, making their way through to Shuri&rsquo;s space.</p>\n\n<p>Peter was checked over quickly, Tony almost kicking up a fuss when they told him to wait outside for a moment.</p>\n\n<p>Peter rounded the corner only a few minutes later, bounding into the welcoming arms of his mentor, promising he was fine. Shuri wanted to keep everyone who had been affected by the snap under observation for one night, just to be cautious.</p>\n\n<p>And later that night, when Pepper awoke to find she was alone, she padded down to the medical room, a lump in her throat until she let out a breath of air and smiled.</p>\n\n<p>Tony was in Peter&rsquo;s medical bed, the boy curled up around his side with Tony&rsquo;s hand still rested in his hair, both sound asleep.</p>\n\n<p>She leaned against the doorway for a moment before heading back to bed.</p>\n\n<p>A warm breeze pushed its way through her open window and Pepper sighed. It was finally over. The Avengers have won.</p>\n\n<p>-</p>",

Hey, hey, hey calm down buddy. It&rsquo;s ok. Everything is going to be ok.&rdquo; Tony says softly.</p><p>Peter looks up at him with wide, tearful eyes. &ldquo;Wh-Why? Why would you try that?!

That sounds kind of cute.&ldquo; Natasha admits.</p><p>Tony nods with a slight smile. Peter smiles and pulls out little boxes with the Disney store logo on it out of his pockets. &quot;Open &lsquo;em!&rdquo; He says excitedly.</p><p>T'Challa opens his first and pulls out a silver necklace with a cute little creature on it then a ring with the word &ldquo;Ohana&rdquo; engraved on the ring. The group slip them on and smile. &ldquo;S-So&hellip;can we be a family?&rdquo; Peter asks softly.</p><p>&ldquo;Dibs on being the mama bear!&rdquo; Natasha quickly says.</p><p>Rhodey and Tony groan in disappointment making Vision, T'Challa and Peter laugh.

The press conference is in five minutes and it takes us ten to get there from here!&rdquo; She growls. </p><p>Yelping Tony follows along.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>&ldquo;Is it true that you are only pleading for a pardon because you feel guilty for the war!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are the rumors true about you calling it quits for the Avengers over a little spat?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you going to date Captain again like our readers believe you will?!&rdquo;</p><p>Tony felt his heart hammering in his chest until it nearly stopped when a group of people walk in with plastic Captain America shields in hand. Panting he grips his chest when phantom paian struck him. It was becoming too much again.</p><p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t all of you just shut the hell up?! Happy can you get that group out of here?!&rdquo;</p><p>Looking up he sees a angry Peter, Rhodey and Natasha up front while T'Challa and Vision were trying to get his attention. &ldquo;All of you get the fuck out!&rdquo; Rhodey yells.</p><p>After getting Tony to the penthouse Peter never left his side. &ldquo;Why&hellip;why did you guys help me?&rdquo; He whispers. </p><p>&ldquo;Because family also means being there for on another.&rdquo; Peter replies. &ldquo;As long as you have us we&rsquo;ll never left you face something scary by yourself ever again.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony felt tears fill his eyes as he held his &ldquo;son&rdquo; close to him. Smiling Peter gently shushes him. &ldquo;Mr. Stark does have a heart and it&rsquo;s little and broken. But still good. Yeah. Still good.&rdquo; Peter says softly.* &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll help with the broken heart.
