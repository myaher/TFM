In the reflection behind you, you could see Tony lazily lying across the bed, watching your every movement.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he asked,<br/>\u201cI have to go and see him today.\u201d even far away you could see Tony tense when you mentioned him. \u201cI need to tell him.\u201d Tony got off of the bed and moved to stand behind you, his hands wrapping around your stomach.<br/>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to. I would be a great father.\u201d he smiled. </p><p>\tIt had only been just over a month since you had started to date Tony. You didn\u2019t want to tell him about the baby at first, but it came out so quickly. Tony\u2019s reaction shocked you. He immediately took to the father role. Wanting nothing more than be a dad to your unborn child. You weren\u2019t complaining, he treated you like a queen and protected you like one too.<br/>\u201cHe deserves to know.\u201d you argued softly, leaning into Tony\u2019s muscled chest, his arc reactor glowly gently.<br/>\u201cI should come with you. In case he gets violent.\u201d<br/>\u201cHe\u2019s never been before and I doubt he will be now. He was an asshole not an abuser.\u201d the look on Tony\u2019s face said he wasn\u2019t giving up easily.<br/>\u201cYou can wait outside in the car.\u201d you offered the compromise. Tony slowly nodded.</p><p>\tYou had safely made it to his house in Tony\u2019s private car with a driver. You had stood on his porch as he answered the door and told him straight.

much</li><li>everyone else just stares</li><li>except for Natasha, who suddenly has a knife in her hand</li><li>Stephen is not impressed</li><li>he listens to Peter\u2019s story and believes him immediately</li><li>\u201cIn the last year I have seen many things that shouldn\u2019t be possible, things nobody will believe if I told them.

How did you get there?\u201d<br></li><li>Peter\u2019s head snaps towards the confused voice and he takes everything in</li><li>it\u2019s silent for several seconds, confusion lacing the air like a heavy gas</li><li>and then it dawns on Peter and he is jumping to his feet, gasping, trembling, his voice breaking on held back tears and sobs, his head swivelling left and right</li><li>he stumbles over his words, not knowing what to say, how to explain, but he knows he needs to do it fast, because the wizard <i>sent him back to this particular moment and it\u2019s obvious what he has to do</i></li><li>the Avengers can\u2019t break up</li><li>they can\u2019t</li><li>and so he blurts out the first thing that comes to mind</li><li>\u201cThanos is coming and we are all going to\u2014to d\u2014die, <i>oh god</i>, and you can\u2019t fight, <i>you can\u2019t</i>, the universe needs the Avengers to protect it, <i>please</i>, you can\u2019t break up, please, <i>pleasepleaseplease</i>!\u201d<br></li><li>he chokes on his words, tears rolling down his faces, sobs clogging his throat, and he is breaking apart, his lanky teenage form shaking and he is so, so scared</li><li>\u201cP\u2014Please, Mr. Stark, you have to <i>believe</i> me!\u201d<br></li><li>and the adults keep staring in confusion and nobody knows what to say, because there is a <i>child</i> in the middle of their battle, <i>begging</i> them to reconcile, obviously scared out of his mind</li><li>Tony is the first one to react</li><li>his face plate flops back and reveals his worried expression</li><li>with hands in front of him, he slowly walks to Peter and grabs him at the shoulders, not really knowing how to calm this kid, who\u2019s obviously drifting quickly into a panic attack</li><li>Peter flinches at the touch</li><li>but when he sees who it is, he lets go and just throws his arms around Tony, everything a bit awkward, because the suit is so bulky</li><li>Tony is confused</li><li><i>very</i> confused</li><li>\u201cOkay, Underoos, what\u2019s going on?\u201d<br></li><li>Peter stumbles over his words again, because he is scared that Cap and his friend with the metal arm will run off, like they did last time, but he needs them to stay right here, needs them to work this out, needs the Avengers to stay together</li><li>as fast as he can he recalls what happened, from the time he saw the spaceship, to saving the wizard, to meeting the Guardians, to fighting Thanos, to being sent back in time by the Time Stone</li><li>and then his mask snaps into place, making Tony\u2019s eyes widen in surprise</li><li>Peter doesn\u2019t know if he is hiding</li><li>he totally is</li><li>and the mask helps</li><li>when he wraps his arms around himself, he hears Tony say,\u00a0\u201cI believe you.\u201d</li><li>he is so relieved that he starts to cry again, his body shaking, his knees buckling under his weight</li><li>Tony catches him, of course</li><li>and nobody leaves</li><li>\u201cWhy do you believe him?\u201d<br></li><li>and Tony explains</li><li>because Peter is wearing a suit that Tony didn\u2019t make and he was wearing a different one just minutes ago</li><li>because this suit is obviously based on nanites and Tony hasn\u2019t had the chance to explore this kind of armour yet</li><li>because <i>Thanos has been in his head since the Battle of New York</i></li><li>and because how could this kid make up something like <i>this</i>?</li><li>Peter is so relieved that Tony believes him, because he needs Tony to believe him, to help him, to set everything right</li><li>because, Peter knows, Tony fixes things</li><li>he can fix this too</li><li>Peter is exhausted</li><li>so he lets the adults talk everything out</li><li>they seem to come to a conclusion</li><li>and it doesn\u2019t end in Cap and his friend leaving</li><li>Peter has to suppress a sob at this realisation</li><li>the Avengers will mend things between them</li><li>and then they will find a way to defeat Thanos</li><li>Peter is sure of it</li><li>\u201cWe need to find the wizard,\u201d he says, because this is important and they have to find him<br></li><li>because the wizard knows more about everything that\u2019s going on</li><li>Tony asks for the name</li><li>\u201cHe said his name is Doctor Strange, but I think that\u2019s his made-up name, because he is a superhero, too?\u201d<br></li><li>the mask vanishes again and shows Peter\u2019s hopeless and scared face, big brown eyes staring at Tony, because the man will know what to do and Peter realises for the first time, since he jumped out of the bus, that he is just a child</li><li>and he needs an adult to make everything alright again</li><li>while they take the Quinjet back to New York (\u201dHappy will get your stuff, kid\u201d), Tony lets FRIDAY search for every Doctor Strange in the world</li><li>ironically she only finds one</li><li>when they land in New York, Peter stays at the Compound until Happy comes back in the private jet with his stuff</li><li>because May doesn\u2019t expect him back so soon</li><li>the adults deal with the Accords and the UN and Tony is busy</li><li>when Peter has his stuff back, he has to go about his everyday life</li><li>because he is fourteen and he has to go to school and do teenage stuff and Tony would be livid if he didn\u2019t</li><li>life goes on for Peter</li><li>but Thanos is still in his head and he worries</li><li>at least he already knows his stuff for classes and doesn\u2019t have to learn so much</li><li>when Tony tells him he found Strange, Peter doesn\u2019t waste any time and comes to the Compound right after school</li><li>together they go to Metro General Hospital</li><li>because Tony thinks that Peter needs to tell the story</li><li>when they arrive, they are directed to an office</li><li>but it\u2019s not Strange\u2019s, but one of a Doctor Christine Palmer</li><li>they tell her about Peter\u2019s time travel in confidence</li><li>somehow she believes them</li><li>Christine, in turn, tells them about Stephen\u2019s accident and how he tried to get his hands to work again</li><li>and how he just vanished from the face of the earth</li><li>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mr. Stark, but \u2026 I don\u2019t know where he is.\u201d<br></li><li>Peter\u2019s shoulders slump and his throat is clogged with emotions, tears barely held at bay</li><li>they need to find Stephen</li><li>desperately</li><li>so Tony does everything he can and tracks his movements to Kathmandu</li><li>he even goes as far as to fly there himself</li><li>he comes back empty handed</li><li>it\u2019s only when Stephen stumbles into Metro General, deathly injured, that Christine calls Tony</li><li>but Stephen is gone before he can make it there</li><li>the next time he pops up, the Ancient One dies</li><li>this time Tony catches him, before he can leave the hospital</li><li>Tony just wishes that he has the kid with him</li><li>but before he can talk to Stephen in length, the man brushes him off and leaves, talking about defending their reality</li><li>Tony has no choice but to let him go</li><li>portals are a nifty thing</li><li>they can do nothing but wait for Stephen to turn up again</li><li>Peter is a nervous mess, getting closer to a breakdown with each passing
