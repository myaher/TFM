I was in the mood to write fluff after 3x15 so this happened.</p><p><b>Summary:</b></p><p>Cyrus watched as the boy\u2019s eyes scanned the board for a moment, before widening slightly. \u201cHey - they have a \u2018limited time only\u2019 discount for couples!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>His eyebrows furrowed slightly in confusion at that, and he looked up at the sign before looking back over at TJ. \u201cOkay&hellip;and?\u201d\u00a0</p><p><b>~</b></p><p>Or the the one where Cyrus and TJ pretend to be a couple so they can get a discount on movie tickets. What could possibly go wrong?</p><p><b>Word count:\u00a0\n\n</b>3786\n\n</p><p><b>~</b></p><p><b><i>(Keep reading for the fic, AO3 link in the reblog)</i></b></p><!-- more --><p>\u201cHey, underdog!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus, who had been somewhat preoccupied with attempting to pry\nopen in locker, spun around his surprise.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTJ! How\u2019s it going?\u201d he asked, voice slightly higher than he\nwould\u2019ve liked.\u00a0</p><p>He was going for nonchalance, but when Cyrus reached out to\nplace a hand against his locker he missed completely and ended up stumbling to\nthe side slightly.\u00a0</p><p><i>Yikes.</i></p><p>TJ just smiled though, shoving his hands in his pockets. \u201cI was\nwondering if you wanted to hang out tomorrow?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 face still felt warm as he leant back against the metal,\ntaking a few long moments to consider the offer. TJ gave his arm a playful shove,\nsmiling when the boy began to laugh.</p><p>\u201cNo TJ, I definitely\u00a0<i>don\u2019t</i>\u00a0wanna\nhang out with you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He gasped. \u201cFine then! I<i>\u00a0</i>guess I\u2019ll\ngo.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ made to walk away, but Cyrus pushed himself off of the locker\nand grabbed his arm, still smiling.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo wait don\u2019t go! I\u2019m sorry!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The boy glanced down at their arms, expression softening\nslightly. \u201cHow would you feel about seeing a movie with me?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus reluctantly dropped his hand, forgetting for a brief\nmoment how exactly to form words. When he looked up his face was ridiculously\nclose to TJ\u2019s, and that had him panicking and taking a step back.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat sounds fun,\u201d he managed, \u201cwhat time?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUm&hellip;\u201d TJ paused for a moment, face reddening slightly, \u201cwell\nthere\u2019s a new horror playing tomorrow at 7?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201c7 is good!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d TJ nodded, giving Cyrus a small smile. \u201cI\u2019ll text you\nthe rest of the details this afternoon.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He glanced over Cyrus\u2019 shoulder at his locker, before letting\nout an amused huff. \u201cNeed help with that?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cPsh, no&hellip;okay, maybe.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus stepped aside, allowing TJ to move forward and reach for\nthe top of the locker door, prying it open after a few small tugs. He watched\nwith an embarrassed smile as the boy stepped back again, giving his shoulder a\npat.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSee you, Cy.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ was off after that, swallowed up by the crowds moving between\nclasses. He let out a\u00a0 love-sick sounding sigh, adjusting his shirt as\nturned back to his locker and grabbed his books. Not even the pouring rain\noutside could dampen his mood at that moment.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou did it again,\u201d came Buffy\u2019s voice from behind him.</p><p>Cyrus turned around again, an eyebrow raised in question. \u201cDid\nwhat again?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>She gave the boy an exasperated look before adjusted her shirt,\ntugging at the fabric in an exaggerated fashion. Cyrus let out a huff and\nturned back to his locker.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>Buffy began rustling around in her pockets for a moment, before\npulling out a small piece of paper. She shoved it into Cyrus\u2019 hands.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s a flowchart, then.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The boy looked over it for a moment, shaking his head in\ndisbelief.</p><p><i>Cyrus talks to TJ -&gt; TJ does something \u2018cute\u2019 and/or walks\naway -&gt; Cyrus nervously adjusts his shirt (because he\u2019s in love)\u00a0</i></p><p>He laughed slightly and turned back to the girl, handing her the\npaper. \u201cI adjust my shirt all the time,\u00a0<i>not</i>\u00a0just\naround TJ.<i>\u00a0</i>And<i>\u00a0</i>I\u2019m not in love with him!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Buffy just nodded, pressing her lips together as she pocketed\nthe paper again. She gave the boy a sympathetic pat on the back, unable to keep\nherself from smiling. \u201cOkay, Cyrus.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes. \u201cHow\u2019s Marty going, again?\u201d</p><p>Buffy\u2019s eyes widened for a split second. \u201cOkay, well I have\nplaces to be now. Bye!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus watched in amusement as the girl headed off in the\nopposite direction, before closing his locker and making his way towards\nMath.\u00a0</p><p>~</p><p>\u201cCyruses first,\u201d said TJ as he held the glass door open.\u00a0</p><p>The boy couldn\u2019t help but smile, walking through into the\ndarkened cinema lobby. It was late evening and the sun was on the verge of\nsetting, bringing shadows with it. As dusk approached, he and TJ had made their\nway to their local shopping mall.\u00a0</p><p>The large lights above their heads were dimmed, and with each\nstep towards the counter, the room seemed to grow darker. There was soft light\nemanating from the screen displaying the various movies that were playing,\nilluminating their face as they came to a halt.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re early,\u201d Cyrus pointed out.</p><p>TJ shrugged and nodded. \u201cNo harm in getting tickets now though,\nI guess.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus watched as the boy\u2019s eyes scanned the board for a moment,\nbefore widening slightly. \u201cHey - they have a \u2018limited time only\u2019 discount for\ncouples!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>His eyebrows furrowed slightly in confusion at that, and he\nlooked up at the sign before looking back over at TJ. \u201cOkay&hellip;and?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ looked nervous all of a sudden, the pink dusting his cheeks\nonly barely visible in the dimly lit lobby. \u201cWell&hellip;its ten dollars,\u201d he\ncontinued, \u201cthat\u2019s uh&hellip;pretty significant.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus laughed uncertainly, not entirely sure where the boy was\ntaking this. \u201cMay I remind you that we\u2019re not a couple?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ bit his lip, and Cyrus\u2019 traitorous heart skipped a beat. He\nhesitated for a moment before speaking again, voice cracking slightly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>They were already garnering a few looks from the people queuing\nup for tickets as they stood there, staring up at the board, but Cyrus couldn\u2019t\nfind it within himself to care at that moment. He glanced over at TJ again,\neyebrows raised.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe uh&hellip;the guy at the counter doesn\u2019t know that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 eyes widened. He looked over at TJ in alarm. \u201cAre you saying&hellip;?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe could pretend,\u201d the boy rushed out nervously. \u201cOr&hellip;or not!\nEither way is fine, but you know&hellip;10 dollars is dollars.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus contemplated the idea for a moment, still in slight\ndisbelief that TJ would suggest such a thing. Everything within him was\npractically screaming at him that this was an awful idea, and that\u2019d it\u2019d only\nend up hurting him to have a taste of what he could never have. He supposed\nthat was logical, but really, since when were things\u00a0<i>ever</i>\u00a0logical\nwhen it came to TJ?\u00a0</p><p>He hesitated for a moment longer before giving a quick, nervous\nnod. \u201cOkay. Let\u2019s do it.\u201d</p><p>TJ took in a sharp breath. \u201cOkay! Cool.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>They stood there for a moment, unsure of what exactly to do. A\ncertain tension had appeared in the air around them, and Cyrus could feel his\nstomach tying itself into knots.\u00a0</p><p>TJ turned to face him. \u201cCan I um&hellip;Can I-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou can do whatever you want,\u201d Cyrus assured him. \u201cExcept kiss\nme. That\u2019s off the table.\u201d</p><p><i>Yeah, because you\u2019re afraid you\u2019d like it too much,</i>\u00a0his\nbrain supplied unhelpfully.\u00a0</p><p>He brushed aside the thought and focused on breathing normally\nas TJ wrapped an arm around his shoulders and gently pulled him in.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay, you\u2019re gonna have to act like you\u2019re super into me. Think\nyou can do that?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus laughed nervously. \u201cUm&hellip;yeah. I can do that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>They headed over to join the queue, marked out by small metal\npoles and velvet red ropes. There were only a few people in front of them, and\nnone of them seemed to pay them much mind now. The entry to the theatres was to\ntheir left, and the entrance they\u2019d come from was to their right, with windows\ndisplaying the setting sun.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBrave of you to suggest a horror movie,\u201d Cyrus teased.\n\u201cConsidering that last time you had your face buried in a pillow half the\ntime.\u201d</p><p>TJ huffed. \u201cOkay,\u00a0<i>half</i>\u00a0the\ntime is an overstatement.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt really isn\u2019t!\u201d Cyrus laughed.</p><p>\u201cIt really is!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>A wide smile was lighting TJ\u2019s face up now, and Cyrus felt his\nheart skip a beat. His gaze travelled from the plain white he was wearing, to\nthe (unfairly adorable) basketball necklace around his neck, to his green eyes,\nand the way they sparkled. For a moment, he began to doubt if this fake\nrelationship thing was such a good idea after all. Not that it had been in the\nfirst place.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019ll be there to protect you from the dolls,\u201d Cyrus\nassured playfully, laughing slightly when TJ just rolled his eyes.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou really think you\u2019d win against a possessed demon\ndoll?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNope! For some strange reason, I think I\u2019d survive longer than\nyou though.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s probably true. My first instinct would be\nto hide under the covers.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAh, yes - it\u2019s a well-known fact that you\u2019re invincible under\nthe covers,\u201d Cyrus said, nodding wisely.\u00a0</p><p>TJ opened his mouth to respond, but they were called over at\nthat moment by a tired-looking guy behind the front counter. Cyrus felt the\nboy\u2019s grip on him tighten ever so slightly as they made their way over.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUm, a couple for the Annabelle movie, please,\u201d TJ told\nhim.\u00a0</p><p>The guy didn\u2019t bat an eye at the request, although his gaze did\nbriefly flicker from TJ to the arm he had wrapped around Cyrus.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be fifteen dollars, thanks.\u201d</p><p>TJ grabbed his wallet from his pocket before Cyrus could,\nplacing the cash down on the counter.\u00a0</p><p>Once they\u2019d successfully gotten their tickets, along with two\nraspberry slushies, they made their way over to a cushy-looking seat by the\nentrance to their cinema, waiting for the double doors to open. It was even\ndarker in this section of the building, with the faint glow from the door\nnumbers illuminating the people that walked past. TJ still had an arm thrown\nover his shoulders for safe measure, and Cyrus was\u00a0<i>still</i>\u00a0forgetting\nhow to breathe every now and again.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to pay,\u201d Cyrus murmured after a moment.</p><p>TJ smiled. \u201cHey, it\u2019s what boyfriends do, right?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus had to look away to hide the blush on his face. This whole\nfake relationship thing was\u00a0<i>already</i>\u00a0getting\nto him and it had only been about ten minutes. A glance down at his phone\nconfirmed they had about ten\u00a0<i>more</i>\u00a0minutes\nto waste before the doors would open, so, after some hesitation, he gently\nrested his head on the boy\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>TJ took another sharp inhale, before moving his arm to Cyrus\u2019\nwaist and drawing him in.</p><p>\u201cHow um&hellip;how was your biology test yesterday?\u201d he asked\nsoftly.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus smiled. He\u2019d spent an embarrassing amount of time texting\nTJ his worries about that particular test.</p><p>He looked up at the boy, whose face was being illuminated\nfaintly, and couldn\u2019t help but pause for a moment to take him in. His features\nlooked soft in this lighting, and Cyrus had another brief thought that\u00a0<i>yeah,\nmaybe this really wasn\u2019t something his heart could take. Why had he even agreed\nto this in the first place?\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cCyrus?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh! Right, sorry, um, it was okay! There was one question that\nI had no idea but um&hellip;the rest were pretty good.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He placed his head back on TJ\u2019s shoulder, and his heart leapt\nwhen the boy began to gently trace circles into his arm with his thumb.\u00a0</p><p><i>Shit.\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cHow was maths?\u201d he asked quickly.\u00a0</p><p>TJ\u2019s actions paused for a moment, before starting up again. \u201cIt\nwas okay&hellip;I hope.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus nodded, tilting his head to look up at the boy again just\nas TJ was looking down.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked suddenly.\u00a0</p><p>The question took Cyrus slightly aback. \u201cYeah,\u201d he responded\nquickly, \u201cwhy wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ hesitated. \u201cIt\u2019s just&hellip;you feel kind of tense. We probably\ndon\u2019t have to keep acting like a couple now that we have tickets-\u201c</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Cyrus assured him. \u201cI don\u2019t mind. I\u2019m just&hellip;always\na little tense.\u201d</p><p>TJ nodded, resuming the patterns he was tracing into Cyrus\u2019 arm.\nThe boy took a deep breath in an attempt to calm himself slightly, doing his\nbest to relax into TJ\u2019s side.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just until we\u2019re out of his sight,\u201d TJ said, looking\ntowards the guy that had sold them their tickets.</p><p>Cyrus nodded, pausing for a moment before blurting \u201cdid I tell\nyou that I held a python over the weekend?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ looked down at him in alarm, looking vaguely impressed\ndespite his obvious shock. \u201cWhat the hell? Where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the local wildlife sanctuary. I have photos to prove it,\u201d\nCyrus told him proudly, taking his phone from his pocket and bringing up his\ncamera roll.\u00a0</p><p>TJ looked down at them for a moment, before laughing slightly.\n\u201cYou look so small!\u201d\u00a0</p><p><i>That</i>\u00a0earnt him a playful shove.</p><p>\u201cNot\u00a0<i>that</i>\u00a0small!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The boy just smiled. \u201cCyrus the snake wrangler. I never thought\nI\u2019d see the day.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI know, right? I thought my experiences with snakes would be\nlimited to documentaries my whole life.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>When the double doors in front of them swung open after a few\nmoments, and a staff member announced that they were allowed to head inside, TJ\nremoved his arm from Cyrus\u2019 shoulders and stood up, sending him a small smile.\nSomething about his expression almost seemed\u00a0<i>disappointed</i>, but\nthere was a very high chance that Cyrus was just getting his hopes up.\u00a0</p><p>The lights were on in the theatre as commercials played, meaning\nit was relatively easy for the pair to find their spots amongst the rows of\ncushy red seats and sit down, slushies in the cup holders beside them. They\nended up having seats towards the back of the theatre, almost all the way up\nthe stairs.</p><p>TJ looked over at him with a smile. \u201cReady to get\nspooked?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus raised an eyebrow. \u201cBy commercials?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ let out an amused huff. \u201cYeah, sure - by commercials.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCommercials\u00a0<i>are</i>\u00a0kind\nof scary,\u201d Cyrus shrugged, \u201cthey can have subliminal messages and stuff.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ glanced up at the screen, where a McDonald&rsquo;s advertisement\nwas playing. \u201cThink we\u2019ll be influenced to buy Mcdonald\u2019s after this?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNot if we fight against it!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ laughed, taking a small sip of his slushie. \u201cCan\u2019t be that\nhard, right?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The pair continued to chatter as the commercials played and\npeople gradually filtered inside, taking their respective seats. Surprisingly,\nthey still seemed to have the row to themselves as the lights dimmed and the\nroom darkened, indicating that the movie was about to start playing.\u00a0</p><p>His phone lit up with a notification as he was reaching down to\nturn it off.\u00a0</p><p><b>Andi:\u00a0</b>how\u2019s your movie date with TJ going? ;)\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus could feel himself blushing as he read over it, sending\nback a quick \u2018aNDI it\u2019s not a date!!\u2019 before turning it to silent and pocketing\nit.</p><p>He looked over at TJ, biting his lip slightly.\u00a0<i>Why\ndid he have to be so cute?\u00a0</i></p><p>The opening credits began rolling then, so he settled back into\nhis seat.</p><p>Throughout the movie, TJ (as expected) repeatedly brought his\nhands up to shield his face whenever he thought a jump scare was coming. Cyrus\nhad seen his fair share of horror movies at this point from hanging out with\nBuffy, so he was\u00a0<i>slightly</i>\u00a0less terrified than the other boy seemed\nto be.\u00a0</p><p>At one point, when the characters were all deciding what their\ncourse of action would be, TJ placed a hand on the armrest next to Cyrus\u2019. He\ndidn\u2019t think anything of it at first, keeping his hand rested beside the boy\u2019s,\nbut his heart leapt when he felt their hands brush. He shifted in his seat,\nchancing a glance over at TJ, only to find that his gaze was fixated intently\non the screen. Almost\u00a0<i>too</i>\u00a0intently, if you\nasked Cyrus.\u00a0</p><p>He took a deep breath, before thinking\u00a0<i>\u2018Screw\nit,\u2019\u00a0</i>and moving his hand closer ever so slightly. The movement had\nbeen subtle, but TJ seemed to pick up on it if the faint smile on his lips was\nanything to go by.</p><p><i>What were they even doing?\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cYou know we don\u2019t have to act like a couple anymore, right?\u201d he\nwhispered.\u00a0</p><p>TJ hesitated. \u201cI know,\u201d he whispered back, barely meeting Cyrus\u2019\ngaze.</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 took in a sharp breath. He officially\u00a0<i>wasn\u2019t</i>\u00a0paying\nattention to the movie anymore.</p><p>He looked over at TJ, not even aiming for subtly this time. The\nlight from the screen was the only thing illuminating his face, so the only\ntime he could fully take the boy in was when there was a scene with good\nlighting. This happened to be one of those, funnily enough.</p><p>TJ glanced over him, and a smile ghosted over his lips. \u201cWhat\u2019s\nup?\u201d he asked casually.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus was on the verge of losing it, so he decided against\nsaying anything. Instead, he attempted to shift his focus to the movie again.\nJust when he began to feel comfortable with their hands brushing the way they\nwere, TJ gently placed his on top of Cyrus\u2019.\u00a0</p><p>A glance over at the boy confirmed his gaze was still on the\nscreen, but his mind seemed to be elsewhere because he didn\u2019t look scared at all.\nIn fact - he seemed\u00a0<i>nervous</i>\u00a0more\nthan anything.</p><p>Cyrus took a deep breath and somehow managed to muster up the\ncourage to turn his hand over. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw TJ smile,\nand he felt the boy intertwine their fingers.\u00a0</p><p><i>Holy shit. He was holding hands with TJ.\u00a0</i></p><p>He eventually managed to focus on the movie again, but his heart\nwas still racing. Whenever there was a jump scare he\u2019d feel TJ\u2019s grip tighten,\nand he would give the boy a reassuring squeeze. It began to feel\u00a0<i>natural</i>\u00a0after\na while, which was surprising to say the least.\u00a0</p><p>When the lights came on again the end of the movie, flooding the\nroom, Cyrus hesitantly pulled his hand away from TJ\u2019s grip and stood up. The\nboy followed suit, looking anywhere but him as they grabbed their slushie cups\nand made their way towards the exit.\u00a0</p><p>They didn\u2019t exchange a single word as they made their way\nthrough the darkened lobby. Cyrus looked over at him as they stepped out into\nthe cool evening air.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d he asked, cutting to the chase.</p><p>TJ sighed, running a hand through his hair. \u201cI don\u2019t\nknow&hellip;whatever you want it to be?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus gave him a hesitant look. \u201cI mean&hellip;we held hands. That\u2019s\nusually a couple thing, right?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ shoved his hands in his pockets. \u201cRight,\u201d he confirmed.</p><p>When he didn\u2019t say anything anymore, Cyrus let out a small sigh.\nThe sky had fully darkened by now, with only a few larger stars visible, and a\ncold breeze was beginning to set in. He tugged on his hoodie, shivering\nslightly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat um&hellip;what do you want it to be?\u201d he eventually settled on\nsaying.\u00a0</p><p>TJ glanced over at him, taking a few moments to think about it\nas they crossed the parking lot. various coloured lights from traffic signals\nand storefronts lit up the street they were on, with cars passing by, clearly\non their way home. The street lamps above them cast shadows across TJ\u2019s face,\nbut Cyrus could clearly see that he looked nervous.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d the boy said eventually, voice soft.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus nodded and looked away, trying hard to conceal his\ndisappointment. Silence fell for a few moments as they began to make their way\nback to TJ\u2019s house.</p><p>\u201cAre you cold?\u201d TJ asked, out of the blue.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus looked down at his hands, which had become numb from the\nicy winds, then back up at TJ.\u00a0</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYeah, kind of.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ hesitated, before shrugging off the coat he\u2019d brought along\nwith him. Cyrus opened his mouth to protest, but before he could TJ was placing\nit over his shoulders with a smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine, I promise.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus bit his lip, before giving in with a small, amused sigh. \u201cOkay.\nThanks.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The coat smelt faintly of TJ\u2019s cologne, and somehow that in\nitself had Cyrus feeling slightly giddy. He placed his hands in the pockets,\ngiving TJ a confused smile when the boy began glancing over at him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he said, looking down bashfully.\u00a0</p><p>He hesitated for a moment longer, Cyrus still watching on in\nconfusion.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou uh&hellip;you look cute.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus\u00a0<i>really</i>\u00a0wasn\u2019t\nsure how much more of this boy his heart could handle.\u00a0</p><p>He smiled, hoping desperately that the streetlamps wouldn\u2019t\nexpose the blush on his face. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Silence fell between them again, but somehow it didn\u2019t feel so\ntense this time. They were walking a lot closer than they had previously by the\ntime they reached TJ\u2019s house, approaching the front gate.</p><p>\u201cWait - um - Cyrus.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus turned around, confusion written all over his face. TJ had\nstopped walking, and he was stood there nervously now, fidgeting with the hem\nof his shirt. His hair was wind-swept and his gaze was hesitant, flicking\nbetween Cyrus and the ground.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI like you,\u201d he rushed out, \u201cif that wasn\u2019t obvious already. I\nwanna be together. If - if you want that too, obviously.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus smiled and tipped his head slightly to the side. \u201cI like\nyou too,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>For a few moments neither of them said anything, then Cyrus was\ntaking a step back towards the house.</p><p>\u201cCould we take this inside? I\u2019m still kind of freezing.\u201d</p><p>TJ laughed slightly and nodded, moving forward to hold open the\ngate for Cyrus. They both left their shoes by the front door, making their way\ndown the warmly-lit hallway towards TJ\u2019s bedroom.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re home, Ambs!\u201d TJ called, to which he received a muffled\n\u201cthanks for the announcement, TJ!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He rolled his eyes, sending Cyrus an exasperated glance as they\nentered his room. Moonlight was filtering in through his blinds, falling onto\nthe boy\u2019s bed covers in strips. From the looks of things, the room had clearly\nbeen tidied beforehand. Varying statues were placed in an orderly fashion on\ntop of his wardrobe, and his stationery was packed away neatly in the small\nboxes on his desk.\u00a0</p><p>TJ sat down on his bed, looking up at Cyrus with a smile.\n\u201cSo&hellip;you like me?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus smiled, moving to sit down beside him. \u201cI thought it was\nobvious,\u201d he teased.</p><p>\u201cNot to me,\u201d TJ responded, looking down at the boy.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus leaned into TJ\u2019s side, wrapping an arm around his waist.\n\u201cWas that discount thing part of a genius plan, or what?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ laughed. \u201cNo - I really\u00a0<i>did</i>\u00a0want\nthat discount. This,\u201d he paused for a moment to gesture between them, \u201cwas\njust&hellip;a very welcome side effect.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus smiled down at his lap, before looking up hesitantly to\nmeet TJ\u2019s gaze. He swallowed, feeling a small army of butterflies begin to fill\nhis stomach. TJ\u2019s eyes not-so-subtly left his, flickering down to his\nlips.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIs kissing still off the tables?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>Cyrus huffed out a laugh. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ shrugged. \u201cYes?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The boy rolled his eyes, smiling fondly as he pulled TJ in. \u201cNo.\nIt\u2019s not. You can kiss me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>A smile came to TJ\u2019s lips, and he leaned down to do exactly\nthat.</p>",

How\u2019s it going?\u201d he asked, voice slightly higher than he\nwould\u2019ve liked.\u00a0</p><p>He was going for nonchalance, but when Cyrus reached out to\nplace a hand against his locker he missed completely and ended up stumbling to\nthe side slightly.\u00a0</p><p><i>Yikes.</i></p><p>TJ just smiled though, shoving his hands in his pockets. \u201cI was\nwondering if you wanted to hang out tomorrow?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 face still felt warm as he leant back against the metal,\ntaking a few long moments to consider the offer. TJ gave his arm a playful shove,\nsmiling when the boy began to laugh.</p><p>\u201cNo TJ, I definitely\u00a0<i>don\u2019t</i>\u00a0wanna\nhang out with you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He gasped. \u201cFine then! I<i>\u00a0</i>guess I\u2019ll\ngo.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ made to walk away, but Cyrus pushed himself off of the locker\nand grabbed his arm, still smiling.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo wait don\u2019t go! I\u2019m sorry!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The boy glanced down at their arms, expression softening\nslightly. \u201cHow would you feel about seeing a movie with me?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus reluctantly dropped his hand, forgetting for a brief\nmoment how exactly to form words. When he looked up his face was ridiculously\nclose to TJ\u2019s, and that had him panicking and taking a step back.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat sounds fun,\u201d he managed, \u201cwhat time?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUm\u2026\u201d TJ paused for a moment, face reddening slightly, \u201cwell\nthere\u2019s a new horror playing tomorrow at 7?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201c7 is good!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d TJ nodded, giving Cyrus a small smile. \u201cI\u2019ll text you\nthe rest of the details this afternoon.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He glanced over Cyrus\u2019 shoulder at his locker, before letting\nout an amused huff. \u201cNeed help with that?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cPsh, no\u2026okay, maybe.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus stepped aside, allowing TJ to move forward and reach for\nthe top of the locker door, prying it open after a few small tugs. He watched\nwith an embarrassed smile as the boy stepped back again, giving his shoulder a\npat.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSee you, Cy.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ was off after that, swallowed up by the crowds moving between\nclasses. He let out a\u00a0 love-sick sounding sigh, adjusting his shirt as\nturned back to his locker and grabbed his books. Not even the pouring rain\noutside could dampen his mood at that moment.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou did it again,\u201d came Buffy\u2019s voice from behind him.</p><p>Cyrus turned around again, an eyebrow raised in question. \u201cDid\nwhat again?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>She gave the boy an exasperated look before adjusted her shirt,\ntugging at the fabric in an exaggerated fashion. Cyrus let out a huff and\nturned back to his locker.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>Buffy began rustling around in her pockets for a moment, before\npulling out a small piece of paper. She shoved it into Cyrus\u2019 hands.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s a flowchart, then.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The boy looked over it for a moment, shaking his head in\ndisbelief.</p><p><i>Cyrus talks to TJ -&gt; TJ does something \u2018cute\u2019 and/or walks\naway -&gt; Cyrus nervously adjusts his shirt (because he\u2019s in love)\u00a0</i></p><p>He laughed slightly and turned back to the girl, handing her the\npaper. \u201cI adjust my shirt all the time,\u00a0<i>not</i>\u00a0just\naround TJ.<i>\u00a0</i>And<i>\u00a0</i>I\u2019m not in love with him!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Buffy just nodded, pressing her lips together as she pocketed\nthe paper again. She gave the boy a sympathetic pat on the back, unable to keep\nherself from smiling. \u201cOkay, Cyrus.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes. \u201cHow\u2019s Marty going, again?\u201d</p><p>Buffy\u2019s eyes widened for a split second. \u201cOkay, well I have\nplaces to be now. Bye!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus watched in amusement as the girl headed off in the\nopposite direction, before closing his locker and making his way towards\nMath.\u00a0</p><p>~</p><p>\u201cCyruses first,\u201d said TJ as he held the glass door open.\u00a0</p><p>The boy couldn\u2019t help but smile, walking through into the\ndarkened cinema lobby. It was late evening and the sun was on the verge of\nsetting, bringing shadows with it. As dusk approached, he and TJ had made their\nway to their local shopping mall.\u00a0</p><p>The large lights above their heads were dimmed, and with each\nstep towards the counter, the room seemed to grow darker. There was soft light\nemanating from the screen displaying the various movies that were playing,\nilluminating their face as they came to a halt.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re early,\u201d Cyrus pointed out.</p><p>TJ shrugged and nodded. \u201cNo harm in getting tickets now though,\nI guess.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus watched as the boy\u2019s eyes scanned the board for a moment,\nbefore widening slightly. \u201cHey - they have a \u2018limited time only\u2019 discount for\ncouples!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>His eyebrows furrowed slightly in confusion at that, and he\nlooked up at the sign before looking back over at TJ. \u201cOkay\u2026and?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ looked nervous all of a sudden, the pink dusting his cheeks\nonly barely visible in the dimly lit lobby. \u201cWell\u2026its ten dollars,\u201d he\ncontinued, \u201cthat\u2019s uh\u2026pretty significant.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus laughed uncertainly, not entirely sure where the boy was\ntaking this. \u201cMay I remind you that we\u2019re not a couple?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ bit his lip, and Cyrus\u2019 traitorous heart skipped a beat. He\nhesitated for a moment before speaking again, voice cracking slightly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>They were already garnering a few looks from the people queuing\nup for tickets as they stood there, staring up at the board, but Cyrus couldn\u2019t\nfind it within himself to care at that moment. He glanced over at TJ again,\neyebrows raised.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe uh\u2026the guy at the counter doesn\u2019t know that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 eyes widened. He looked over at TJ in alarm. \u201cAre you saying\u2026?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe could pretend,\u201d the boy rushed out nervously. \u201cOr\u2026or not!\nEither way is fine, but you know\u202610 dollars is dollars.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus contemplated the idea for a moment, still in slight\ndisbelief that TJ would suggest such a thing. Everything within him was\npractically screaming at him that this was an awful idea, and that\u2019d it\u2019d only\nend up hurting him to have a taste of what he could never have. He supposed\nthat was logical, but really, since when were things\u00a0<i>ever</i>\u00a0logical\nwhen it came to TJ?\u00a0</p><p>He hesitated for a moment longer before giving a quick, nervous\nnod. \u201cOkay. Let\u2019s do it.\u201d</p><p>TJ took in a sharp breath. \u201cOkay! Cool.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>They stood there for a moment, unsure of what exactly to do. A\ncertain tension had appeared in the air around them, and Cyrus could feel his\nstomach tying itself into knots.\u00a0</p><p>TJ turned to face him. \u201cCan I um\u2026Can I-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou can do whatever you want,\u201d Cyrus assured him. \u201cExcept kiss\nme. That\u2019s off the table.\u201d</p><p><i>Yeah, because you\u2019re afraid you\u2019d like it too much,</i>\u00a0his\nbrain supplied unhelpfully.\u00a0</p><p>He brushed aside the thought and focused on breathing normally\nas TJ wrapped an arm around his shoulders and gently pulled him in.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay, you\u2019re gonna have to act like you\u2019re super into me. Think\nyou can do that?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus laughed nervously. \u201cUm\u2026yeah. I can do that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>They headed over to join the queue, marked out by small metal\npoles and velvet red ropes. There were only a few people in front of them, and\nnone of them seemed to pay them much mind now. The entry to the theatres was to\ntheir left, and the entrance they\u2019d come from was to their right, with windows\ndisplaying the setting sun.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBrave of you to suggest a horror movie,\u201d Cyrus teased.\n\u201cConsidering that last time you had your face buried in a pillow half the\ntime.\u201d</p><p>TJ huffed. \u201cOkay,\u00a0<i>half</i>\u00a0the\ntime is an overstatement.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt really isn\u2019t!\u201d Cyrus laughed.</p><p>\u201cIt really is!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>A wide smile was lighting TJ\u2019s face up now, and Cyrus felt his\nheart skip a beat. His gaze travelled from the plain white he was wearing, to\nthe (unfairly adorable) basketball necklace around his neck, to his green eyes,\nand the way they sparkled. For a moment, he began to doubt if this fake\nrelationship thing was such a good idea after all. Not that it had been in the\nfirst place.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019ll be there to protect you from the dolls,\u201d Cyrus\nassured playfully, laughing slightly when TJ just rolled his eyes.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou really think you\u2019d win against a possessed demon\ndoll?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNope! For some strange reason, I think I\u2019d survive longer than\nyou though.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s probably true. My first instinct would be\nto hide under the covers.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAh, yes - it\u2019s a well-known fact that you\u2019re invincible under\nthe covers,\u201d Cyrus said, nodding wisely.\u00a0</p><p>TJ opened his mouth to respond, but they were called over at\nthat moment by a tired-looking guy behind the front counter. Cyrus felt the\nboy\u2019s grip on him tighten ever so slightly as they made their way over.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUm, a couple for the Annabelle movie, please,\u201d TJ told\nhim.\u00a0</p><p>The guy didn\u2019t bat an eye at the request, although his gaze did\nbriefly flicker from TJ to the arm he had wrapped around Cyrus.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be fifteen dollars, thanks.\u201d</p><p>TJ grabbed his wallet from his pocket before Cyrus could,\nplacing the cash down on the counter.\u00a0</p><p>Once they\u2019d successfully gotten their tickets, along with two\nraspberry slushies, they made their way over to a cushy-looking seat by the\nentrance to their cinema, waiting for the double doors to open. It was even\ndarker in this section of the building, with the faint glow from the door\nnumbers illuminating the people that walked past. TJ still had an arm thrown\nover his shoulders for safe measure, and Cyrus was\u00a0<i>still</i>\u00a0forgetting\nhow to breathe every now and again.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to pay,\u201d Cyrus murmured after a moment.</p><p>TJ smiled. \u201cHey, it\u2019s what boyfriends do, right?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus had to look away to hide the blush on his face. This whole\nfake relationship thing was\u00a0<i>already</i>\u00a0getting\nto him and it had only been about ten minutes. A glance down at his phone\nconfirmed they had about ten\u00a0<i>more</i>\u00a0minutes\nto waste before the doors would open, so, after some hesitation, he gently\nrested his head on the boy\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>TJ took another sharp inhale, before moving his arm to Cyrus\u2019\nwaist and drawing him in.</p><p>\u201cHow um\u2026how was your biology test yesterday?\u201d he asked\nsoftly.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus smiled. He\u2019d spent an embarrassing amount of time texting\nTJ his worries about that particular test.</p><p>He looked up at the boy, whose face was being illuminated\nfaintly, and couldn\u2019t help but pause for a moment to take him in. His features\nlooked soft in this lighting, and Cyrus had another brief thought that\u00a0<i>yeah,\nmaybe this really wasn\u2019t something his heart could take. Why had he even agreed\nto this in the first place?\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cCyrus?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh! Right, sorry, um, it was okay! There was one question that\nI had no idea but um\u2026the rest were pretty good.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He placed his head back on TJ\u2019s shoulder, and his heart leapt\nwhen the boy began to gently trace circles into his arm with his thumb.\u00a0</p><p><i>Shit.\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cHow was maths?\u201d he asked quickly.\u00a0</p><p>TJ\u2019s actions paused for a moment, before starting up again. \u201cIt\nwas okay\u2026I hope.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus nodded, tilting his head to look up at the boy again just\nas TJ was looking down.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked suddenly.\u00a0</p><p>The question took Cyrus slightly aback. \u201cYeah,\u201d he responded\nquickly, \u201cwhy wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ hesitated. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026you feel kind of tense. We probably\ndon\u2019t have to keep acting like a couple now that we have tickets-\u201c</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Cyrus assured him. \u201cI don\u2019t mind. I\u2019m just\u2026always\na little tense.\u201d</p><p>TJ nodded, resuming the patterns he was tracing into Cyrus\u2019 arm.\nThe boy took a deep breath in an attempt to calm himself slightly, doing his\nbest to relax into TJ\u2019s side.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just until we\u2019re out of his sight,\u201d TJ said, looking\ntowards the guy that had sold them their tickets.</p><p>Cyrus nodded, pausing for a moment before blurting \u201cdid I tell\nyou that I held a python over the weekend?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ looked down at him in alarm, looking vaguely impressed\ndespite his obvious shock. \u201cWhat the hell? Where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the local wildlife sanctuary. I have photos to prove it,\u201d\nCyrus told him proudly, taking his phone from his pocket and bringing up his\ncamera roll.\u00a0</p><p>TJ looked down at them for a moment, before laughing slightly.\n\u201cYou look so small!\u201d\u00a0</p><p><i>That</i>\u00a0earnt him a playful shove.</p><p>\u201cNot\u00a0<i>that</i>\u00a0small!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The boy just smiled. \u201cCyrus the snake wrangler. I never thought\nI\u2019d see the day.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI know, right? I thought my experiences with snakes would be\nlimited to documentaries my whole life.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>When the double doors in front of them swung open after a few\nmoments, and a staff member announced that they were allowed to head inside, TJ\nremoved his arm from Cyrus\u2019 shoulders and stood up, sending him a small smile.\nSomething about his expression almost seemed\u00a0<i>disappointed</i>, but\nthere was a very high chance that Cyrus was just getting his hopes up.\u00a0</p><p>The lights were on in the theatre as commercials played, meaning\nit was relatively easy for the pair to find their spots amongst the rows of\ncushy red seats and sit down, slushies in the cup holders beside them. They\nended up having seats towards the back of the theatre, almost all the way up\nthe stairs.</p><p>TJ looked over at him with a smile. \u201cReady to get\nspooked?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus raised an eyebrow. \u201cBy commercials?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ let out an amused huff. \u201cYeah, sure - by commercials.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCommercials\u00a0<i>are</i>\u00a0kind\nof scary,\u201d Cyrus shrugged, \u201cthey can have subliminal messages and stuff.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ glanced up at the screen, where a McDonald\u2019s advertisement\nwas playing. \u201cThink we\u2019ll be influenced to buy Mcdonald\u2019s after this?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNot if we fight against it!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ laughed, taking a small sip of his slushie. \u201cCan\u2019t be that\nhard, right?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The pair continued to chatter as the commercials played and\npeople gradually filtered inside, taking their respective seats. Surprisingly,\nthey still seemed to have the row to themselves as the lights dimmed and the\nroom darkened, indicating that the movie was about to start playing.\u00a0</p><p>His phone lit up with a notification as he was reaching down to\nturn it off.\u00a0</p><p><b>Andi:\u00a0</b>how\u2019s your movie date with TJ going? ;)\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus could feel himself blushing as he read over it, sending\nback a quick \u2018aNDI it\u2019s not a date!!\u2019 before turning it to silent and pocketing\nit.</p><p>He looked over at TJ, biting his lip slightly.\u00a0<i>Why\ndid he have to be so cute?\u00a0</i></p><p>The opening credits began rolling then, so he settled back into\nhis seat.</p><p>Throughout the movie, TJ (as expected) repeatedly brought his\nhands up to shield his face whenever he thought a jump scare was coming. Cyrus\nhad seen his fair share of horror movies at this point from hanging out with\nBuffy, so he was\u00a0<i>slightly</i>\u00a0less terrified than the other boy seemed\nto be.\u00a0</p><p>At one point, when the characters were all deciding what their\ncourse of action would be, TJ placed a hand on the armrest next to Cyrus\u2019. He\ndidn\u2019t think anything of it at first, keeping his hand rested beside the boy\u2019s,\nbut his heart leapt when he felt their hands brush. He shifted in his seat,\nchancing a glance over at TJ, only to find that his gaze was fixated intently\non the screen. Almost\u00a0<i>too</i>\u00a0intently, if you\nasked Cyrus.\u00a0</p><p>He took a deep breath, before thinking\u00a0<i>\u2018Screw\nit,\u2019\u00a0</i>and moving his hand closer ever so slightly. The movement had\nbeen subtle, but TJ seemed to pick up on it if the faint smile on his lips was\nanything to go by.</p><p><i>What were they even doing?\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cYou know we don\u2019t have to act like a couple anymore, right?\u201d he\nwhispered.\u00a0</p><p>TJ hesitated. \u201cI know,\u201d he whispered back, barely meeting Cyrus\u2019\ngaze.</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 took in a sharp breath. He officially\u00a0<i>wasn\u2019t</i>\u00a0paying\nattention to the movie anymore.</p><p>He looked over at TJ, not even aiming for subtly this time. The\nlight from the screen was the only thing illuminating his face, so the only\ntime he could fully take the boy in was when there was a scene with good\nlighting. This happened to be one of those, funnily enough.</p><p>TJ glanced over him, and a smile ghosted over his lips. \u201cWhat\u2019s\nup?\u201d he asked casually.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus was on the verge of losing it, so he decided against\nsaying anything. Instead, he attempted to shift his focus to the movie again.\nJust when he began to feel comfortable with their hands brushing the way they\nwere, TJ gently placed his on top of Cyrus\u2019.\u00a0</p><p>A glance over at the boy confirmed his gaze was still on the\nscreen, but his mind seemed to be elsewhere because he didn\u2019t look scared at all.\nIn fact - he seemed\u00a0<i>nervous</i>\u00a0more\nthan anything.</p><p>Cyrus took a deep breath and somehow managed to muster up the\ncourage to turn his hand over. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw TJ smile,\nand he felt the boy intertwine their fingers.\u00a0</p><p><i>Holy shit. He was holding hands with TJ.\u00a0</i></p><p>He eventually managed to focus on the movie again, but his heart\nwas still racing. Whenever there was a jump scare he\u2019d feel TJ\u2019s grip tighten,\nand he would give the boy a reassuring squeeze. It began to feel\u00a0<i>natural</i>\u00a0after\na while, which was surprising to say the least.\u00a0</p><p>When the lights came on again the end of the movie, flooding the\nroom, Cyrus hesitantly pulled his hand away from TJ\u2019s grip and stood up. The\nboy followed suit, looking anywhere but him as they grabbed their slushie cups\nand made their way towards the exit.\u00a0</p><p>They didn\u2019t exchange a single word as they made their way\nthrough the darkened lobby. Cyrus looked over at him as they stepped out into\nthe cool evening air.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d he asked, cutting to the chase.</p><p>TJ sighed, running a hand through his hair. \u201cI don\u2019t\nknow\u2026whatever you want it to be?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus gave him a hesitant look. \u201cI mean\u2026we held hands. That\u2019s\nusually a couple thing, right?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ shoved his hands in his pockets. \u201cRight,\u201d he confirmed.</p><p>When he didn\u2019t say anything anymore, Cyrus let out a small sigh.\nThe sky had fully darkened by now, with only a few larger stars visible, and a\ncold breeze was beginning to set in. He tugged on his hoodie, shivering\nslightly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat um\u2026what do you want it to be?\u201d he eventually settled on\nsaying.\u00a0</p><p>TJ glanced over at him, taking a few moments to think about it\nas they crossed the parking lot. various coloured lights from traffic signals\nand storefronts lit up the street they were on, with cars passing by, clearly\non their way home. The street lamps above them cast shadows across TJ\u2019s face,\nbut Cyrus could clearly see that he looked nervous.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d the boy said eventually, voice soft.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus nodded and looked away, trying hard to conceal his\ndisappointment. Silence fell for a few moments as they began to make their way\nback to TJ\u2019s house.</p><p>\u201cAre you cold?\u201d TJ asked, out of the blue.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus looked down at his hands, which had become numb from the\nicy winds, then back up at TJ.\u00a0</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYeah, kind of.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ hesitated, before shrugging off the coat he\u2019d brought along\nwith him. Cyrus opened his mouth to protest, but before he could TJ was placing\nit over his shoulders with a smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine, I promise.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus bit his lip, before giving in with a small, amused sigh. \u201cOkay.\nThanks.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The coat smelt faintly of TJ\u2019s cologne, and somehow that in\nitself had Cyrus feeling slightly giddy. He placed his hands in the pockets,\ngiving TJ a confused smile when the boy began glancing over at him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he said, looking down bashfully.\u00a0</p><p>He hesitated for a moment longer, Cyrus still watching on in\nconfusion.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou uh\u2026you look cute.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus\u00a0<i>really</i>\u00a0wasn\u2019t\nsure how much more of this boy his heart could handle.\u00a0</p><p>He smiled, hoping desperately that the streetlamps wouldn\u2019t\nexpose the blush on his face. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Silence fell between them again, but somehow it didn\u2019t feel so\ntense this time. They were walking a lot closer than they had previously by the\ntime they reached TJ\u2019s house, approaching the front gate.</p><p>\u201cWait - um - Cyrus.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus turned around, confusion written all over his face. TJ had\nstopped walking, and he was stood there nervously now, fidgeting with the hem\nof his shirt. His hair was wind-swept and his gaze was hesitant, flicking\nbetween Cyrus and the ground.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI like you,\u201d he rushed out, \u201cif that wasn\u2019t obvious already. I\nwanna be together. If - if you want that too, obviously.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus smiled and tipped his head slightly to the side. \u201cI like\nyou too,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>For a few moments neither of them said anything, then Cyrus was\ntaking a step back towards the house.</p><p>\u201cCould we take this inside? I\u2019m still kind of freezing.\u201d</p><p>TJ laughed slightly and nodded, moving forward to hold open the\ngate for Cyrus. They both left their shoes by the front door, making their way\ndown the warmly-lit hallway towards TJ\u2019s bedroom.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re home, Ambs!\u201d TJ called, to which he received a muffled\n\u201cthanks for the announcement, TJ!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He rolled his eyes, sending Cyrus an exasperated glance as they\nentered his room. Moonlight was filtering in through his blinds, falling onto\nthe boy\u2019s bed covers in strips. From the looks of things, the room had clearly\nbeen tidied beforehand. Varying statues were placed in an orderly fashion on\ntop of his wardrobe, and his stationery was packed away neatly in the small\nboxes on his desk.\u00a0</p><p>TJ sat down on his bed, looking up at Cyrus with a smile.\n\u201cSo\u2026you like me?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus smiled, moving to sit down beside him. \u201cI thought it was\nobvious,\u201d he teased.</p><p>\u201cNot to me,\u201d TJ responded, looking down at the boy.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus leaned into TJ\u2019s side, wrapping an arm around his waist.\n\u201cWas that discount thing part of a genius plan, or what?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ laughed. \u201cNo - I really\u00a0<i>did</i>\u00a0want\nthat discount. This,\u201d he paused for a moment to gesture between them, \u201cwas\njust\u2026a very welcome side effect.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus smiled down at his lap, before looking up hesitantly to\nmeet TJ\u2019s gaze. He swallowed, feeling a small army of butterflies begin to fill\nhis stomach. TJ\u2019s eyes not-so-subtly left his, flickering down to his\nlips.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIs kissing still off the tables?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>Cyrus huffed out a laugh. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ shrugged. \u201cYes?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The boy rolled his eyes, smiling fondly as he pulled TJ in. \u201cNo.\nIt\u2019s not. You can kiss me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>A smile came to TJ\u2019s lips, and he leaned down to do exactly\nthat.</p>",

How\u2019s it going?\u201d he asked, voice slightly higher than he\nwould\u2019ve liked.\u00a0</p><p>He was going for nonchalance, but when Cyrus reached out to\nplace a hand against his locker he missed completely and ended up stumbling to\nthe side slightly.\u00a0</p><p><i>Yikes.</i></p><p>TJ just smiled though, shoving his hands in his pockets. \u201cI was\nwondering if you wanted to hang out tomorrow?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 face still felt warm as he leant back against the metal,\ntaking a few long moments to consider the offer. TJ gave his arm a playful shove,\nsmiling when the boy began to laugh.</p><p>\u201cNo TJ, I definitely\u00a0<i>don\u2019t</i>\u00a0wanna\nhang out with you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He gasped. \u201cFine then!

I\u2019m sorry!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The boy glanced down at their arms, expression softening\nslightly. \u201cHow would you feel about seeing a movie with me?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus reluctantly dropped his hand, forgetting for a brief\nmoment how exactly to form words. When he looked up his face was ridiculously\nclose to TJ\u2019s, and that had him panicking and taking a step back.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat sounds fun,\u201d he managed, \u201cwhat time?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUm\u2026\u201d TJ paused for a moment, face reddening slightly, \u201cwell\nthere\u2019s a new horror playing tomorrow at 7?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201c7 is good!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d TJ nodded, giving Cyrus a small smile. \u201cI\u2019ll text you\nthe rest of the details this afternoon.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He glanced over Cyrus\u2019 shoulder at his locker, before letting\nout an amused huff. \u201cNeed help with that?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cPsh, no\u2026okay, maybe.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus stepped aside, allowing TJ to move forward and reach for\nthe top of the locker door, prying it open after a few small tugs. He watched\nwith an embarrassed smile as the boy stepped back again, giving his shoulder a\npat.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSee you, Cy.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ was off after that, swallowed up by the crowds moving between\nclasses. He let out a\u00a0 love-sick sounding sigh, adjusting his shirt as\nturned back to his locker and grabbed his books. Not even the pouring rain\noutside could dampen his mood at that moment.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou did it again,\u201d came Buffy\u2019s voice from behind him.</p><p>Cyrus turned around again, an eyebrow raised in question. \u201cDid\nwhat again?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>She gave the boy an exasperated look before adjusted her shirt,\ntugging at the fabric in an exaggerated fashion. Cyrus let out a huff and\nturned back to his locker.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>Buffy began rustling around in her pockets for a moment, before\npulling out a small piece of paper. She shoved it into Cyrus\u2019 hands.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s a flowchart, then.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The boy looked over it for a moment, shaking his head in\ndisbelief.</p><p><i>Cyrus talks to TJ -&gt; TJ does something \u2018cute\u2019 and/or walks\naway -&gt; Cyrus nervously adjusts his shirt (because he\u2019s in love)\u00a0</i></p><p>He laughed slightly and turned back to the girl, handing her the\npaper. \u201cI adjust my shirt all the time,\u00a0<i>not</i>\u00a0just\naround TJ.<i>\u00a0</i>And<i>\u00a0</i>I\u2019m not in love with him!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Buffy just nodded, pressing her lips together as she pocketed\nthe paper again. She gave the boy a sympathetic pat on the back, unable to keep\nherself from smiling. \u201cOkay, Cyrus.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes. \u201cHow\u2019s Marty going, again?\u201d</p><p>Buffy\u2019s eyes widened for a split second. \u201cOkay, well I have\nplaces to be now. Bye!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus watched in amusement as the girl headed off in the\nopposite direction, before closing his locker and making his way towards\nMath.\u00a0</p><p>~</p><p>\u201cCyruses first,\u201d said TJ as he held the glass door open.\u00a0</p><p>The boy couldn\u2019t help but smile, walking through into the\ndarkened cinema lobby. It was late evening and the sun was on the verge of\nsetting, bringing shadows with it. As dusk approached, he and TJ had made their\nway to their local shopping mall.\u00a0</p><p>The large lights above their heads were dimmed, and with each\nstep towards the counter, the room seemed to grow darker. There was soft light\nemanating from the screen displaying the various movies that were playing,\nilluminating their face as they came to a halt.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re early,\u201d Cyrus pointed out.</p><p>TJ shrugged and nodded. \u201cNo harm in getting tickets now though,\nI guess.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus watched as the boy\u2019s eyes scanned the board for a moment,\nbefore widening slightly. \u201cHey - they have a \u2018limited time only\u2019 discount for\ncouples!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>His eyebrows furrowed slightly in confusion at that, and he\nlooked up at the sign before looking back over at TJ. \u201cOkay\u2026and?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ looked nervous all of a sudden, the pink dusting his cheeks\nonly barely visible in the dimly lit lobby. \u201cWell\u2026its ten dollars,\u201d he\ncontinued, \u201cthat\u2019s uh\u2026pretty significant.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus laughed uncertainly, not entirely sure where the boy was\ntaking this. \u201cMay I remind you that we\u2019re not a couple?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ bit his lip, and Cyrus\u2019 traitorous heart skipped a beat. He\nhesitated for a moment before speaking again, voice cracking slightly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>They were already garnering a few looks from the people queuing\nup for tickets as they stood there, staring up at the board, but Cyrus couldn\u2019t\nfind it within himself to care at that moment. He glanced over at TJ again,\neyebrows raised.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe uh\u2026the guy at the counter doesn\u2019t know that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 eyes widened. He looked over at TJ in alarm. \u201cAre you saying\u2026?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe could pretend,\u201d the boy rushed out nervously. \u201cOr\u2026or not!\nEither way is fine, but you know\u202610 dollars is dollars.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus contemplated the idea for a moment, still in slight\ndisbelief that TJ would suggest such a thing. Everything within him was\npractically screaming at him that this was an awful idea, and that\u2019d it\u2019d only\nend up hurting him to have a taste of what he could never have. He supposed\nthat was logical, but really, since when were things\u00a0<i>ever</i>\u00a0logical\nwhen it came to TJ?\u00a0</p><p>He hesitated for a moment longer before giving a quick, nervous\nnod. \u201cOkay. Let\u2019s do it.\u201d</p><p>TJ took in a sharp breath. \u201cOkay! Cool.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>They stood there for a moment, unsure of what exactly to do. A\ncertain tension had appeared in the air around them, and Cyrus could feel his\nstomach tying itself into knots.\u00a0</p><p>TJ turned to face him. \u201cCan I um\u2026Can I-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou can do whatever you want,\u201d Cyrus assured him. \u201cExcept kiss\nme. That\u2019s off the table.\u201d</p><p><i>Yeah, because you\u2019re afraid you\u2019d like it too much,</i>\u00a0his\nbrain supplied unhelpfully.\u00a0</p><p>He brushed aside the thought and focused on breathing normally\nas TJ wrapped an arm around his shoulders and gently pulled him in.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay, you\u2019re gonna have to act like you\u2019re super into me. Think\nyou can do that?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus laughed nervously. \u201cUm\u2026yeah. I can do that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>They headed over to join the queue, marked out by small metal\npoles and velvet red ropes. There were only a few people in front of them, and\nnone of them seemed to pay them much mind now. The entry to the theatres was to\ntheir left, and the entrance they\u2019d come from was to their right, with windows\ndisplaying the setting sun.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBrave of you to suggest a horror movie,\u201d Cyrus teased.\n\u201cConsidering that last time you had your face buried in a pillow half the\ntime.\u201d</p><p>TJ huffed. \u201cOkay,\u00a0<i>half</i>\u00a0the\ntime is an overstatement.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt really isn\u2019t!\u201d Cyrus laughed.</p><p>\u201cIt really is!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>A wide smile was lighting TJ\u2019s face up now, and Cyrus felt his\nheart skip a beat. His gaze travelled from the plain white he was wearing, to\nthe (unfairly adorable) basketball necklace around his neck, to his green eyes,\nand the way they sparkled. For a moment, he began to doubt if this fake\nrelationship thing was such a good idea after all. Not that it had been in the\nfirst place.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019ll be there to protect you from the dolls,\u201d Cyrus\nassured playfully, laughing slightly when TJ just rolled his eyes.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou really think you\u2019d win against a possessed demon\ndoll?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNope! For some strange reason, I think I\u2019d survive longer than\nyou though.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s probably true. My first instinct would be\nto hide under the covers.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAh, yes - it\u2019s a well-known fact that you\u2019re invincible under\nthe covers,\u201d Cyrus said, nodding wisely.\u00a0</p><p>TJ opened his mouth to respond, but they were called over at\nthat moment by a tired-looking guy behind the front counter. Cyrus felt the\nboy\u2019s grip on him tighten ever so slightly as they made their way over.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUm, a couple for the Annabelle movie, please,\u201d TJ told\nhim.\u00a0</p><p>The guy didn\u2019t bat an eye at the request, although his gaze did\nbriefly flicker from TJ to the arm he had wrapped around Cyrus.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be fifteen dollars, thanks.\u201d</p><p>TJ grabbed his wallet from his pocket before Cyrus could,\nplacing the cash down on the counter.\u00a0</p><p>Once they\u2019d successfully gotten their tickets, along with two\nraspberry slushies, they made their way over to a cushy-looking seat by the\nentrance to their cinema, waiting for the double doors to open. It was even\ndarker in this section of the building, with the faint glow from the door\nnumbers illuminating the people that walked past. TJ still had an arm thrown\nover his shoulders for safe measure, and Cyrus was\u00a0<i>still</i>\u00a0forgetting\nhow to breathe every now and again.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to pay,\u201d Cyrus murmured after a moment.</p><p>TJ smiled. \u201cHey, it\u2019s what boyfriends do, right?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus had to look away to hide the blush on his face. This whole\nfake relationship thing was\u00a0<i>already</i>\u00a0getting\nto him and it had only been about ten minutes. A glance down at his phone\nconfirmed they had about ten\u00a0<i>more</i>\u00a0minutes\nto waste before the doors would open, so, after some hesitation, he gently\nrested his head on the boy\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>TJ took another sharp inhale, before moving his arm to Cyrus\u2019\nwaist and drawing him in.</p><p>\u201cHow um\u2026how was your biology test yesterday?\u201d he asked\nsoftly.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus smiled. He\u2019d spent an embarrassing amount of time texting\nTJ his worries about that particular test.</p><p>He looked up at the boy, whose face was being illuminated\nfaintly, and couldn\u2019t help but pause for a moment to take him in. His features\nlooked soft in this lighting, and Cyrus had another brief thought that\u00a0<i>yeah,\nmaybe this really wasn\u2019t something his heart could take. Why had he even agreed\nto this in the first place?\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cCyrus?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh! Right, sorry, um, it was okay! There was one question that\nI had no idea but um\u2026the rest were pretty good.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He placed his head back on TJ\u2019s shoulder, and his heart leapt\nwhen the boy began to gently trace circles into his arm with his thumb.\u00a0</p><p><i>Shit.\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cHow was maths?\u201d he asked quickly.\u00a0</p><p>TJ\u2019s actions paused for a moment, before starting up again. \u201cIt\nwas okay\u2026I hope.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus nodded, tilting his head to look up at the boy again just\nas TJ was looking down.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked suddenly.\u00a0</p><p>The question took Cyrus slightly aback. \u201cYeah,\u201d he responded\nquickly, \u201cwhy wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ hesitated. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026you feel kind of tense. We probably\ndon\u2019t have to keep acting like a couple now that we have tickets-\u201c</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Cyrus assured him. \u201cI don\u2019t mind. I\u2019m just\u2026always\na little tense.\u201d</p><p>TJ nodded, resuming the patterns he was tracing into Cyrus\u2019 arm.\nThe boy took a deep breath in an attempt to calm himself slightly, doing his\nbest to relax into TJ\u2019s side.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just until we\u2019re out of his sight,\u201d TJ said, looking\ntowards the guy that had sold them their tickets.</p><p>Cyrus nodded, pausing for a moment before blurting \u201cdid I tell\nyou that I held a python over the weekend?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ looked down at him in alarm, looking vaguely impressed\ndespite his obvious shock. \u201cWhat the hell? Where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the local wildlife sanctuary. I have photos to prove it,\u201d\nCyrus told him proudly, taking his phone from his pocket and bringing up his\ncamera roll.\u00a0</p><p>TJ looked down at them for a moment, before laughing slightly.\n\u201cYou look so small!\u201d\u00a0</p><p><i>That</i>\u00a0earnt him a playful shove.</p><p>\u201cNot\u00a0<i>that</i>\u00a0small!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The boy just smiled. \u201cCyrus the snake wrangler. I never thought\nI\u2019d see the day.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI know, right? I thought my experiences with snakes would be\nlimited to documentaries my whole life.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>When the double doors in front of them swung open after a few\nmoments, and a staff member announced that they were allowed to head inside, TJ\nremoved his arm from Cyrus\u2019 shoulders and stood up, sending him a small smile.\nSomething about his expression almost seemed\u00a0<i>disappointed</i>, but\nthere was a very high chance that Cyrus was just getting his hopes up.\u00a0</p><p>The lights were on in the theatre as commercials played, meaning\nit was relatively easy for the pair to find their spots amongst the rows of\ncushy red seats and sit down, slushies in the cup holders beside them. They\nended up having seats towards the back of the theatre, almost all the way up\nthe stairs.</p><p>TJ looked over at him with a smile. \u201cReady to get\nspooked?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus raised an eyebrow. \u201cBy commercials?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ let out an amused huff. \u201cYeah, sure - by commercials.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCommercials\u00a0<i>are</i>\u00a0kind\nof scary,\u201d Cyrus shrugged, \u201cthey can have subliminal messages and stuff.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ glanced up at the screen, where a McDonald\u2019s advertisement\nwas playing. \u201cThink we\u2019ll be influenced to buy Mcdonald\u2019s after this?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNot if we fight against it!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ laughed, taking a small sip of his slushie. \u201cCan\u2019t be that\nhard, right?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The pair continued to chatter as the commercials played and\npeople gradually filtered inside, taking their respective seats. Surprisingly,\nthey still seemed to have the row to themselves as the lights dimmed and the\nroom darkened, indicating that the movie was about to start playing.\u00a0</p><p>His phone lit up with a notification as he was reaching down to\nturn it off.\u00a0</p><p><b>Andi:\u00a0</b>how\u2019s your movie date with TJ going? ;)\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus could feel himself blushing as he read over it, sending\nback a quick \u2018aNDI it\u2019s not a date!!\u2019 before turning it to silent and pocketing\nit.</p><p>He looked over at TJ, biting his lip slightly.\u00a0<i>Why\ndid he have to be so cute?\u00a0</i></p><p>The opening credits began rolling then, so he settled back into\nhis seat.</p><p>Throughout the movie, TJ (as expected) repeatedly brought his\nhands up to shield his face whenever he thought a jump scare was coming. Cyrus\nhad seen his fair share of horror movies at this point from hanging out with\nBuffy, so he was\u00a0<i>slightly</i>\u00a0less terrified than the other boy seemed\nto be.\u00a0</p><p>At one point, when the characters were all deciding what their\ncourse of action would be, TJ placed a hand on the armrest next to Cyrus\u2019. He\ndidn\u2019t think anything of it at first, keeping his hand rested beside the boy\u2019s,\nbut his heart leapt when he felt their hands brush. He shifted in his seat,\nchancing a glance over at TJ, only to find that his gaze was fixated intently\non the screen. Almost\u00a0<i>too</i>\u00a0intently, if you\nasked Cyrus.\u00a0</p><p>He took a deep breath, before thinking\u00a0<i>\u2018Screw\nit,\u2019\u00a0</i>and moving his hand closer ever so slightly. The movement had\nbeen subtle, but TJ seemed to pick up on it if the faint smile on his lips was\nanything to go by.</p><p><i>What were they even doing?\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cYou know we don\u2019t have to act like a couple anymore, right?\u201d he\nwhispered.\u00a0</p><p>TJ hesitated. \u201cI know,\u201d he whispered back, barely meeting Cyrus\u2019\ngaze.</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 took in a sharp breath. He officially\u00a0<i>wasn\u2019t</i>\u00a0paying\nattention to the movie anymore.</p><p>He looked over at TJ, not even aiming for subtly this time. The\nlight from the screen was the only thing illuminating his face, so the only\ntime he could fully take the boy in was when there was a scene with good\nlighting. This happened to be one of those, funnily enough.</p><p>TJ glanced over him, and a smile ghosted over his lips. \u201cWhat\u2019s\nup?\u201d he asked casually.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus was on the verge of losing it, so he decided against\nsaying anything. Instead, he attempted to shift his focus to the movie again.\nJust when he began to feel comfortable with their hands brushing the way they\nwere, TJ gently placed his on top of Cyrus\u2019.\u00a0</p><p>A glance over at the boy confirmed his gaze was still on the\nscreen, but his mind seemed to be elsewhere because he didn\u2019t look scared at all.\nIn fact - he seemed\u00a0<i>nervous</i>\u00a0more\nthan anything.</p><p>Cyrus took a deep breath and somehow managed to muster up the\ncourage to turn his hand over. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw TJ smile,\nand he felt the boy intertwine their fingers.\u00a0</p><p><i>Holy shit. He was holding hands with TJ.\u00a0</i></p><p>He eventually managed to focus on the movie again, but his heart\nwas still racing. Whenever there was a jump scare he\u2019d feel TJ\u2019s grip tighten,\nand he would give the boy a reassuring squeeze. It began to feel\u00a0<i>natural</i>\u00a0after\na while, which was surprising to say the least.\u00a0</p><p>When the lights came on again the end of the movie, flooding the\nroom, Cyrus hesitantly pulled his hand away from TJ\u2019s grip and stood up. The\nboy followed suit, looking anywhere but him as they grabbed their slushie cups\nand made their way towards the exit.\u00a0</p><p>They didn\u2019t exchange a single word as they made their way\nthrough the darkened lobby. Cyrus looked over at him as they stepped out into\nthe cool evening air.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d he asked, cutting to the chase.</p><p>TJ sighed, running a hand through his hair. \u201cI don\u2019t\nknow\u2026whatever you want it to be?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus gave him a hesitant look. \u201cI mean\u2026we held hands. That\u2019s\nusually a couple thing, right?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ shoved his hands in his pockets. \u201cRight,\u201d he confirmed.</p><p>When he didn\u2019t say anything anymore, Cyrus let out a small sigh.\nThe sky had fully darkened by now, with only a few larger stars visible, and a\ncold breeze was beginning to set in. He tugged on his hoodie, shivering\nslightly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat um\u2026what do you want it to be?\u201d he eventually settled on\nsaying.\u00a0</p><p>TJ glanced over at him, taking a few moments to think about it\nas they crossed the parking lot. various coloured lights from traffic signals\nand storefronts lit up the street they were on, with cars passing by, clearly\non their way home. The street lamps above them cast shadows across TJ\u2019s face,\nbut Cyrus could clearly see that he looked nervous.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d the boy said eventually, voice soft.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus nodded and looked away, trying hard to conceal his\ndisappointment. Silence fell for a few moments as they began to make their way\nback to TJ\u2019s house.</p><p>\u201cAre you cold?\u201d TJ asked, out of the blue.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus looked down at his hands, which had become numb from the\nicy winds, then back up at TJ.\u00a0</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYeah, kind of.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ hesitated, before shrugging off the coat he\u2019d brought along\nwith him. Cyrus opened his mouth to protest, but before he could TJ was placing\nit over his shoulders with a smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine, I promise.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus bit his lip, before giving in with a small, amused sigh. \u201cOkay.\nThanks.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The coat smelt faintly of TJ\u2019s cologne, and somehow that in\nitself had Cyrus feeling slightly giddy. He placed his hands in the pockets,\ngiving TJ a confused smile when the boy began glancing over at him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he said, looking down bashfully.\u00a0</p><p>He hesitated for a moment longer, Cyrus still watching on in\nconfusion.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou uh\u2026you look cute.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus\u00a0<i>really</i>\u00a0wasn\u2019t\nsure how much more of this boy his heart could handle.\u00a0</p><p>He smiled, hoping desperately that the streetlamps wouldn\u2019t\nexpose the blush on his face. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Silence fell between them again, but somehow it didn\u2019t feel so\ntense this time. They were walking a lot closer than they had previously by the\ntime they reached TJ\u2019s house, approaching the front gate.</p><p>\u201cWait - um - Cyrus.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus turned around, confusion written all over his face. TJ had\nstopped walking, and he was stood there nervously now, fidgeting with the hem\nof his shirt. His hair was wind-swept and his gaze was hesitant, flicking\nbetween Cyrus and the ground.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI like you,\u201d he rushed out, \u201cif that wasn\u2019t obvious already. I\nwanna be together. If - if you want that too, obviously.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus smiled and tipped his head slightly to the side. \u201cI like\nyou too,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>For a few moments neither of them said anything, then Cyrus was\ntaking a step back towards the house.</p><p>\u201cCould we take this inside? I\u2019m still kind of freezing.\u201d</p><p>TJ laughed slightly and nodded, moving forward to hold open the\ngate for Cyrus. They both left their shoes by the front door, making their way\ndown the warmly-lit hallway towards TJ\u2019s bedroom.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re home, Ambs!\u201d TJ called, to which he received a muffled\n\u201cthanks for the announcement, TJ!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He rolled his eyes, sending Cyrus an exasperated glance as they\nentered his room. Moonlight was filtering in through his blinds, falling onto\nthe boy\u2019s bed covers in strips. From the looks of things, the room had clearly\nbeen tidied beforehand. Varying statues were placed in an orderly fashion on\ntop of his wardrobe, and his stationery was packed away neatly in the small\nboxes on his desk.\u00a0</p><p>TJ sat down on his bed, looking up at Cyrus with a smile.\n\u201cSo\u2026you like me?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus smiled, moving to sit down beside him. \u201cI thought it was\nobvious,\u201d he teased.</p><p>\u201cNot to me,\u201d TJ responded, looking down at the boy.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus leaned into TJ\u2019s side, wrapping an arm around his waist.\n\u201cWas that discount thing part of a genius plan, or what?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ laughed. \u201cNo - I really\u00a0<i>did</i>\u00a0want\nthat discount. This,\u201d he paused for a moment to gesture between them, \u201cwas\njust\u2026a very welcome side effect.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus smiled down at his lap, before looking up hesitantly to\nmeet TJ\u2019s gaze. He swallowed, feeling a small army of butterflies begin to fill\nhis stomach. TJ\u2019s eyes not-so-subtly left his, flickering down to his\nlips.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIs kissing still off the tables?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>Cyrus huffed out a laugh. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>TJ shrugged. \u201cYes?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The boy rolled his eyes, smiling fondly as he pulled TJ in. \u201cNo.\nIt\u2019s not. You can kiss me.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>A smile came to TJ\u2019s lips, and he leaned down to do exactly\nthat.</p>",

Bye!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus watched in amusement as the girl headed off in the\nopposite direction, before closing his locker and making his way towards\nMath.&nbsp;</p><p>~</p><p>&ldquo;Cyruses first,&rdquo; said TJ as he held the glass door open.&nbsp;</p><p>The boy couldn&rsquo;t help but smile, walking through into the\ndarkened cinema lobby. It was late evening and the sun was on the verge of\nsetting, bringing shadows with it. As dusk approached, he and TJ had made their\nway to their local shopping mall.&nbsp;</p><p>The large lights above their heads were dimmed, and with each\nstep towards the counter, the room seemed to grow darker. There was soft light\nemanating from the screen displaying the various movies that were playing,\nilluminating their face as they came to a halt.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re early,&rdquo; Cyrus pointed out.</p><p>TJ shrugged and nodded. &ldquo;No harm in getting tickets now though,\nI guess.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus watched as the boy&rsquo;s eyes scanned the board for a moment,\nbefore widening slightly. &ldquo;Hey - they have a &lsquo;limited time only&rsquo; discount for\ncouples!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>His eyebrows furrowed slightly in confusion at that, and he\nlooked up at the sign before looking back over at TJ. &ldquo;Okay&hellip;and?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>TJ looked nervous all of a sudden, the pink dusting his cheeks\nonly barely visible in the dimly lit lobby. &ldquo;Well&hellip;its ten dollars,&rdquo; he\ncontinued, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s uh&hellip;pretty significant.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus laughed uncertainly, not entirely sure where the boy was\ntaking this. &ldquo;May I remind you that we&rsquo;re not a couple?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>TJ bit his lip, and Cyrus&rsquo; traitorous heart skipped a beat. He\nhesitated for a moment before speaking again, voice cracking slightly.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>They were already garnering a few looks from the people queuing\nup for tickets as they stood there, staring up at the board, but Cyrus couldn&rsquo;t\nfind it within himself to care at that moment. He glanced over at TJ again,\neyebrows raised.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;The uh&hellip;the guy at the counter doesn&rsquo;t know that.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus&rsquo; eyes widened. He looked over at TJ in alarm. &ldquo;Are you saying&hellip;?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;We could pretend,&rdquo; the boy rushed out nervously. &ldquo;Or&hellip;or not!\nEither way is fine, but you know&hellip;10 dollars is dollars.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus contemplated the idea for a moment, still in slight\ndisbelief that TJ would suggest such a thing. Everything within him was\npractically screaming at him that this was an awful idea, and that&rsquo;d it&rsquo;d only\nend up hurting him to have a taste of what he could never have. He supposed\nthat was logical, but really, since when were things&nbsp;<i>ever</i>&nbsp;logical\nwhen it came to TJ?&nbsp;</p><p>He hesitated for a moment longer before giving a quick, nervous\nnod. &ldquo;Okay. Let&rsquo;s do it.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ took in a sharp breath. &ldquo;Okay! Cool.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>They stood there for a moment, unsure of what exactly to do. A\ncertain tension had appeared in the air around them, and Cyrus could feel his\nstomach tying itself into knots.&nbsp;</p><p>TJ turned to face him. &ldquo;Can I um&hellip;Can I-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You can do whatever you want,&rdquo; Cyrus assured him. &ldquo;Except kiss\nme. That&rsquo;s off the table.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Yeah, because you&rsquo;re afraid you&rsquo;d like it too much,</i>&nbsp;his\nbrain supplied unhelpfully.&nbsp;</p><p>He brushed aside the thought and focused on breathing normally\nas TJ wrapped an arm around his shoulders and gently pulled him in.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, you&rsquo;re gonna have to act like you&rsquo;re super into me. Think\nyou can do that?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus laughed nervously. &ldquo;Um&hellip;yeah. I can do that.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>They headed over to join the queue, marked out by small metal\npoles and velvet red ropes. There were only a few people in front of them, and\nnone of them seemed to pay them much mind now. The entry to the theatres was to\ntheir left, and the entrance they&rsquo;d come from was to their right, with windows\ndisplaying the setting sun.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Brave of you to suggest a horror movie,&rdquo; Cyrus teased.\n&ldquo;Considering that last time you had your face buried in a pillow half the\ntime.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ huffed. &ldquo;Okay,&nbsp;<i>half</i>&nbsp;the\ntime is an overstatement.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It really isn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Cyrus laughed.</p><p>&ldquo;It really is!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>A wide smile was lighting TJ&rsquo;s face up now, and Cyrus felt his\nheart skip a beat. His gaze travelled from the plain white he was wearing, to\nthe (unfairly adorable) basketball necklace around his neck, to his green eyes,\nand the way they sparkled. For a moment, he began to doubt if this fake\nrelationship thing was such a good idea after all. Not that it had been in the\nfirst place.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, I&rsquo;ll be there to protect you from the dolls,&rdquo; Cyrus\nassured playfully, laughing slightly when TJ just rolled his eyes.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You really think you&rsquo;d win against a possessed demon\ndoll?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Nope! For some strange reason, I think I&rsquo;d survive longer than\nyou though.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>TJ shrugged. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s probably true. My first instinct would be\nto hide under the covers.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, yes - it&rsquo;s a well-known fact that you&rsquo;re invincible under\nthe covers,&rdquo; Cyrus said, nodding wisely.&nbsp;</p><p>TJ opened his mouth to respond, but they were called over at\nthat moment by a tired-looking guy behind the front counter. Cyrus felt the\nboy&rsquo;s grip on him tighten ever so slightly as they made their way over.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Um, a couple for the Annabelle movie, please,&rdquo; TJ told\nhim.&nbsp;</p><p>The guy didn&rsquo;t bat an eye at the request, although his gaze did\nbriefly flicker from TJ to the arm he had wrapped around Cyrus.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be fifteen dollars, thanks.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ grabbed his wallet from his pocket before Cyrus could,\nplacing the cash down on the counter.&nbsp;</p><p>Once they&rsquo;d successfully gotten their tickets, along with two\nraspberry slushies, they made their way over to a cushy-looking seat by the\nentrance to their cinema, waiting for the double doors to open. It was even\ndarker in this section of the building, with the faint glow from the door\nnumbers illuminating the people that walked past. TJ still had an arm thrown\nover his shoulders for safe measure, and Cyrus was&nbsp;<i>still</i>&nbsp;forgetting\nhow to breathe every now and again.</p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t have to pay,&rdquo; Cyrus murmured after a moment.</p><p>TJ smiled. &ldquo;Hey, it&rsquo;s what boyfriends do, right?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus had to look away to hide the blush on his face. This whole\nfake relationship thing was&nbsp;<i>already</i>&nbsp;getting\nto him and it had only been about ten minutes. A glance down at his phone\nconfirmed they had about ten&nbsp;<i>more</i>&nbsp;minutes\nto waste before the doors would open, so, after some hesitation, he gently\nrested his head on the boy&rsquo;s shoulder.</p><p>TJ took another sharp inhale, before moving his arm to Cyrus&rsquo;\nwaist and drawing him in.</p><p>&ldquo;How um&hellip;how was your biology test yesterday?&rdquo; he asked\nsoftly.&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus smiled. He&rsquo;d spent an embarrassing amount of time texting\nTJ his worries about that particular test.</p><p>He looked up at the boy, whose face was being illuminated\nfaintly, and couldn&rsquo;t help but pause for a moment to take him in. His features\nlooked soft in this lighting, and Cyrus had another brief thought that&nbsp;<i>yeah,\nmaybe this really wasn&rsquo;t something his heart could take. Why had he even agreed\nto this in the first place?&nbsp;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Cyrus?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! Right, sorry, um, it was okay! There was one question that\nI had no idea but um&hellip;the rest were pretty good.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>He placed his head back on TJ&rsquo;s shoulder, and his heart leapt\nwhen the boy began to gently trace circles into his arm with his thumb.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Shit.&nbsp;</i></p><p>&ldquo;How was maths?&rdquo; he asked quickly.&nbsp;</p><p>TJ&rsquo;s actions paused for a moment, before starting up again. &ldquo;It\nwas okay&hellip;I hope.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus nodded, tilting his head to look up at the boy again just\nas TJ was looking down.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; he asked suddenly.&nbsp;</p><p>The question took Cyrus slightly aback. &ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he responded\nquickly, &ldquo;why wouldn&rsquo;t I be?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>TJ hesitated. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just&hellip;you feel kind of tense. We probably\ndon&rsquo;t have to keep acting like a couple now that we have tickets-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; Cyrus assured him. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind. I&rsquo;m just&hellip;always\na little tense.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ nodded, resuming the patterns he was tracing into Cyrus&rsquo; arm.\nThe boy took a deep breath in an attempt to calm himself slightly, doing his\nbest to relax into TJ&rsquo;s side.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just until we&rsquo;re out of his sight,&rdquo; TJ said, looking\ntowards the guy that had sold them their tickets.</p><p>Cyrus nodded, pausing for a moment before blurting &ldquo;did I tell\nyou that I held a python over the weekend?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>TJ looked down at him in alarm, looking vaguely impressed\ndespite his obvious shock. &ldquo;What the hell? Where?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;At the local wildlife sanctuary. I have photos to prove it,&rdquo;\nCyrus told him proudly, taking his phone from his pocket and bringing up his\ncamera roll.&nbsp;</p><p>TJ looked down at them for a moment, before laughing slightly.\n&ldquo;You look so small!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p><i>That</i>&nbsp;earnt him a playful shove.</p><p>&ldquo;Not&nbsp;<i>that</i>&nbsp;small!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>The boy just smiled. &ldquo;Cyrus the snake wrangler. I never thought\nI&rsquo;d see the day.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I know, right? I thought my experiences with snakes would be\nlimited to documentaries my whole life.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>When the double doors in front of them swung open after a few\nmoments, and a staff member announced that they were allowed to head inside, TJ\nremoved his arm from Cyrus&rsquo; shoulders and stood up, sending him a small smile.\nSomething about his expression almost seemed&nbsp;<i>disappointed</i>, but\nthere was a very high chance that Cyrus was just getting his hopes up.&nbsp;</p><p>The lights were on in the theatre as commercials played, meaning\nit was relatively easy for the pair to find their spots amongst the rows of\ncushy red seats and sit down, slushies in the cup holders beside them. They\nended up having seats towards the back of the theatre, almost all the way up\nthe stairs.</p><p>TJ looked over at him with a smile. &ldquo;Ready to get\nspooked?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus raised an eyebrow. &ldquo;By commercials?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>TJ let out an amused huff. &ldquo;Yeah, sure - by commercials.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Commercials&nbsp;<i>are</i>&nbsp;kind\nof scary,&rdquo; Cyrus shrugged, &ldquo;they can have subliminal messages and stuff.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>TJ glanced up at the screen, where a McDonald&rsquo;s advertisement\nwas playing. &ldquo;Think we&rsquo;ll be influenced to buy Mcdonald&rsquo;s after this?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Not if we fight against it!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>TJ laughed, taking a small sip of his slushie. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be that\nhard, right?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>The pair continued to chatter as the commercials played and\npeople gradually filtered inside, taking their respective seats. Surprisingly,\nthey still seemed to have the row to themselves as the lights dimmed and the\nroom darkened, indicating that the movie was about to start playing.&nbsp;</p><p>His phone lit up with a notification as he was reaching down to\nturn it off.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Andi:&nbsp;</b>how&rsquo;s your movie date with TJ going? ;)&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus could feel himself blushing as he read over it, sending\nback a quick &lsquo;aNDI it&rsquo;s not a date!!&rsquo; before turning it to silent and pocketing\nit.</p><p>He looked over at TJ, biting his lip slightly.&nbsp;<i>Why\ndid he have to be so cute?&nbsp;</i></p><p>The opening credits began rolling then, so he settled back into\nhis seat.</p><p>Throughout the movie, TJ (as expected) repeatedly brought his\nhands up to shield his face whenever he thought a jump scare was coming. Cyrus\nhad seen his fair share of horror movies at this point from hanging out with\nBuffy, so he was&nbsp;<i>slightly</i>&nbsp;less terrified than the other boy seemed\nto be.&nbsp;</p><p>At one point, when the characters were all deciding what their\ncourse of action would be, TJ placed a hand on the armrest next to Cyrus&rsquo;. He\ndidn&rsquo;t think anything of it at first, keeping his hand rested beside the boy&rsquo;s,\nbut his heart leapt when he felt their hands brush. He shifted in his seat,\nchancing a glance over at TJ, only to find that his gaze was fixated intently\non the screen. Almost&nbsp;<i>too</i>&nbsp;intently, if you\nasked Cyrus.&nbsp;</p><p>He took a deep breath, before thinking&nbsp;<i>&lsquo;Screw\nit,&rsquo;&nbsp;</i>and moving his hand closer ever so slightly. The movement had\nbeen subtle, but TJ seemed to pick up on it if the faint smile on his lips was\nanything to go by.</p><p><i>What were they even doing?&nbsp;</i></p><p>&ldquo;You know we don&rsquo;t have to act like a couple anymore, right?&rdquo; he\nwhispered.&nbsp;</p><p>TJ hesitated. &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he whispered back, barely meeting Cyrus&rsquo;\ngaze.</p><p>Cyrus&rsquo; took in a sharp breath. He officially&nbsp;<i>wasn&rsquo;t</i>&nbsp;paying\nattention to the movie anymore.</p><p>He looked over at TJ, not even aiming for subtly this time. The\nlight from the screen was the only thing illuminating his face, so the only\ntime he could fully take the boy in was when there was a scene with good\nlighting. This happened to be one of those, funnily enough.</p><p>TJ glanced over him, and a smile ghosted over his lips. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s\nup?&rdquo; he asked casually.&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus was on the verge of losing it, so he decided against\nsaying anything. Instead, he attempted to shift his focus to the movie again.\nJust when he began to feel comfortable with their hands brushing the way they\nwere, TJ gently placed his on top of Cyrus&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p><p>A glance over at the boy confirmed his gaze was still on the\nscreen, but his mind seemed to be elsewhere because he didn&rsquo;t look scared at all.\nIn fact - he seemed&nbsp;<i>nervous</i>&nbsp;more\nthan anything.</p><p>Cyrus took a deep breath and somehow managed to muster up the\ncourage to turn his hand over. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw TJ smile,\nand he felt the boy intertwine their fingers.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Holy shit. He was holding hands with TJ.&nbsp;</i></p><p>He eventually managed to focus on the movie again, but his heart\nwas still racing. Whenever there was a jump scare he&rsquo;d feel TJ&rsquo;s grip tighten,\nand he would give the boy a reassuring squeeze. It began to feel&nbsp;<i>natural</i>&nbsp;after\na while, which was surprising to say the least.&nbsp;</p><p>When the lights came on again the end of the movie, flooding the\nroom, Cyrus hesitantly pulled his hand away from TJ&rsquo;s grip and stood up. The\nboy followed suit, looking anywhere but him as they grabbed their slushie cups\nand made their way towards the exit.&nbsp;</p><p>They didn&rsquo;t exchange a single word as they made their way\nthrough the darkened lobby. Cyrus looked over at him as they stepped out into\nthe cool evening air.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; he asked, cutting to the chase.</p><p>TJ sighed, running a hand through his hair. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t\nknow&hellip;whatever you want it to be?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus gave him a hesitant look. &ldquo;I mean&hellip;we held hands. That&rsquo;s\nusually a couple thing, right?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>TJ shoved his hands in his pockets. &ldquo;Right,&rdquo; he confirmed.</p><p>When he didn&rsquo;t say anything anymore, Cyrus let out a small sigh.\nThe sky had fully darkened by now, with only a few larger stars visible, and a\ncold breeze was beginning to set in. He tugged on his hoodie, shivering\nslightly.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What um&hellip;what do you want it to be?&rdquo; he eventually settled on\nsaying.&nbsp;</p><p>TJ glanced over at him, taking a few moments to think about it\nas they crossed the parking lot. various coloured lights from traffic signals\nand storefronts lit up the street they were on, with cars passing by, clearly\non their way home. The street lamps above them cast shadows across TJ&rsquo;s face,\nbut Cyrus could clearly see that he looked nervous.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; the boy said eventually, voice soft.&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus nodded and looked away, trying hard to conceal his\ndisappointment. Silence fell for a few moments as they began to make their way\nback to TJ&rsquo;s house.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you cold?&rdquo; TJ asked, out of the blue.&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus looked down at his hands, which had become numb from the\nicy winds, then back up at TJ.&nbsp;</p><p>He shrugged. &ldquo;Yeah, kind of.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>TJ hesitated, before shrugging off the coat he&rsquo;d brought along\nwith him. Cyrus opened his mouth to protest, but before he could TJ was placing\nit over his shoulders with a smile.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be fine, I promise.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus bit his lip, before giving in with a small, amused sigh. &ldquo;Okay.\nThanks.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>The coat smelt faintly of TJ&rsquo;s cologne, and somehow that in\nitself had Cyrus feeling slightly giddy. He placed his hands in the pockets,\ngiving TJ a confused smile when the boy began glancing over at him.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he said, looking down bashfully.&nbsp;</p><p>He hesitated for a moment longer, Cyrus still watching on in\nconfusion.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You uh&hellip;you look cute.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus&nbsp;<i>really</i>&nbsp;wasn&rsquo;t\nsure how much more of this boy his heart could handle.&nbsp;</p><p>He smiled, hoping desperately that the streetlamps wouldn&rsquo;t\nexpose the blush on his face. &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</p><p>Silence fell between them again, but somehow it didn&rsquo;t feel so\ntense this time. They were walking a lot closer than they had previously by the\ntime they reached TJ&rsquo;s house, approaching the front gate.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait - um - Cyrus.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus turned around, confusion written all over his face. TJ had\nstopped walking, and he was stood there nervously now, fidgeting with the hem\nof his shirt. His hair was wind-swept and his gaze was hesitant, flicking\nbetween Cyrus and the ground.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I like you,&rdquo; he rushed out, &ldquo;if that wasn&rsquo;t obvious already. I\nwanna be together. If - if you want that too, obviously.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus smiled and tipped his head slightly to the side. &ldquo;I like\nyou too,&rdquo; he said softly.</p><p>For a few moments neither of them said anything, then Cyrus was\ntaking a step back towards the house.</p><p>&ldquo;Could we take this inside? I&rsquo;m still kind of freezing.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ laughed slightly and nodded, moving forward to hold open the\ngate for Cyrus. They both left their shoes by the front door, making their way\ndown the warmly-lit hallway towards TJ&rsquo;s bedroom.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re home, Ambs!&rdquo; TJ called, to which he received a muffled\n&ldquo;thanks for the announcement, TJ!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>He rolled his eyes, sending Cyrus an exasperated glance as they\nentered his room. Moonlight was filtering in through his blinds, falling onto\nthe boy&rsquo;s bed covers in strips. From the looks of things, the room had clearly\nbeen tidied beforehand. Varying statues were placed in an orderly fashion on\ntop of his wardrobe, and his stationery was packed away neatly in the small\nboxes on his desk.&nbsp;</p><p>TJ sat down on his bed, looking up at Cyrus with a smile.\n&ldquo;So&hellip;you like me?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus smiled, moving to sit down beside him. &ldquo;I thought it was\nobvious,&rdquo; he teased.</p><p>&ldquo;Not to me,&rdquo; TJ responded, looking down at the boy.&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus leaned into TJ&rsquo;s side, wrapping an arm around his waist.\n&ldquo;Was that discount thing part of a genius plan, or what?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>TJ laughed. &ldquo;No - I really&nbsp;<i>did</i>&nbsp;want\nthat discount. This,&rdquo; he paused for a moment to gesture between them, &ldquo;was\njust&hellip;a very welcome side effect.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus smiled down at his lap, before looking up hesitantly to\nmeet TJ&rsquo;s gaze. He swallowed, feeling a small army of butterflies begin to fill\nhis stomach. TJ&rsquo;s eyes not-so-subtly left his, flickering down to his\nlips.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Is kissing still off the tables?&rdquo; he asked softly.</p><p>Cyrus huffed out a laugh. &ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>TJ shrugged. &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>The boy rolled his eyes, smiling fondly as he pulled TJ in. &ldquo;No.\nIt&rsquo;s not. You can kiss me.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>A smile came to TJ&rsquo;s lips, and he leaned down to do exactly\nthat.</p>",

He was exhausted by his heart, as every step he took was marked by a small fragment of it breaking off. He couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to care anymore, and that was the scariest part. </p><p>Cyrus was used to feeling jealous, that burning, twisting vine that would creep around his heart, squeezing it everytime he saw Andi and Jonah together back in 7th grade. That&rsquo;s what he had expected to feel while seeing TJ and Kira together. And he did feel it at first, but soon enough, it numbed. Now every time he saw them, he just felt empty. And it wasn&rsquo;t like he could go to the swings to calm down anymore, the memory of seeing the two have so much fun in their spot, <i><b>their</b></i> safe place, he couldn&rsquo;t see the swingset again. </p><p><i>TJ didn&rsquo;t need him around anymore, he held onto Cyrus after the gun incident as he was between friends, but now he&rsquo;d found the perfect friend for him. </i>Cyrus tried to shake the thought out of his head but he knew it was true, that Kira had officially replaced him as the only person TJ could talk to. And he was happy for them. If happy was a dull ache everytime he looked across the courtyard at them. </p><p>A knocking on his door startled him out of his thoughts. Rubbing his eyes, he pushed himself off the bed and opened the door to see his mother standing there. </p><p>&ldquo;Cy, honey, Amber just came by and she asked if you&rsquo;re there. What should I tell her?&rdquo; His mom asked softly, smiling gently. She didn&rsquo;t really know what had happened, but she could sense Cyrus&rsquo; exhaustion, and recognised that he just wanted to be left alone. &ldquo;I could tell her some other time?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No no, it&rsquo;s okay, mom. I&rsquo;ll go down,&rdquo; Cyrus said quietly, forcing himself to get up and walk down the stairs. Amber was sitting in the waiting room outside his mother&rsquo;s office, wringing her hands, her back facing the door. Cyrus sighed, and walked into the room. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey Amber,&rdquo; He said, causing her to turn around, and Cyrus stopped short. </p><p>Amber&rsquo;s eyes were red and puffy, tears stains on her cheeks. Honestly, he hasn&rsquo;t seen Amber look this bad in a while, the last time being near the end of 7th grade, when she had first broken down to him about everything at home. Since then, she had kept her tears deep down inside, not letting it show. Until now. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for just turning up without warning, Cyrus, but I really really needed to talk to someone,&rdquo; Amber said, her voice hoarse. &ldquo;And I trust you a lot.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus gave a small smile, sitting down beside her as he grabbed her hand and squeezed it. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Jonah,&rdquo; She said softly, her voice barely louder than a whisper. She sniffed, holding up the back of her hand to her nose. </p><p>Cyrus just looked at her comfortingly, listening patiently. Amber looked up at the ceiling, taking a deep breath through her mouth. </p><p>&ldquo;We had gone go carting the other day, on a date. And, I decided to tell him, that, that I loved him, you know? How could telling someone you love them go bad?&rdquo; She said with a sad laugh. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have done that. He just, freaked out, and walked away. I thought that he needed time, to tell me anything. Whether he felt the same or not, just for him to say anything. But, the next day, he came up and acted like nothing had happened, like everything was normal. And he went back to not texting me back much, not calling. I just, I don&rsquo;t know what I should have done instead.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Amber, maybe that&rsquo;s Jonah&rsquo;s way of saying that he isn&rsquo;t sure and needs time?&rdquo; Cyrus suggested, looking at her. &ldquo;I mean, saying &lsquo;I love you&rsquo;re is a huge thing and it probably caught him off guard. He probably just needs to think it through. But you&rsquo;re still together right?&rdquo;</p><p>At that, Amber looked up at Cyrus, a tear rolling down her cheek. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it, though. This is worse than normal. He really isn&rsquo;t talking to me as much over text or call, but when we meet, he acts as if nothing is wrong. I can&rsquo;t do it anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Cyrus asked, confused. </p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t hang out or talk to him for a while, I don&rsquo;t know how long. But I just can&rsquo;t do it. I need to stop talking to him, it&rsquo;s the best thing,&rdquo; Amber said, nodding to herself. Cyrus shook his head. </p><p>&ldquo;Amber, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s very healthy,&rdquo; Cyrus started but Amber shook her head vigorously, grabbing Cyrus&rsquo; hand. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if it&rsquo;s healthy or not,&rdquo; She said, her voice desperate. &ldquo;But, here&rsquo;s the thing. I am always the one to text or call, always trying to reach out. And I was always there for him. And I thought he felt the same way about me that I did about him. But, the truth is that, he doesn&rsquo;t want me, or need me. So, what&rsquo;s the point, right?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus was quiet, leaning back in his seat. Because everything Amber had just said hit him in a way it hadnt before. And from the nunbing emptiness of his mind, a sharp twinge of pain came up, cutting his heart. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; He whispered, deep in thought. Amber furrowed her eyebrows, confused by Cyrus&rsquo; sudden change in behavior. But soon, he shook his head, and turned back to Amber, as they continued to talk about everything and anything. </p><p>Amber left after an hour or so, and she and Cyrus clung to each other, grateful for the other just being there. After she left, Cyrus went back up to his room, Amber&rsquo;s words echoing in his mind. He forced himself to think of TJ and Kira at the swings, thinking about how TJ no longer needed him as a friend, as a crutch. He had lived out his usefulness. That&rsquo;s what he thought. </p><p>But TJ was acting like everything was okay, like nothing had happened, like Cyrus and him were okay and normal. And every time that was reminded to him, Cyrus could feel his heart twist more. </p><p><i>Like now</i>, he thought to himself, as he lay on his bed, and picked up the phone he had left there to see many text messages from TJ, many still coming in. Cyrus looked at the notifications, sighing sadly. He knew what he had to do. </p><p>The messages were still coming in, each looking more and more concerned. Cyrus opened TJ&rsquo;s contact on the phone, ignoring the pinging notifications. Seeing the picture of the two of them hugging, one Buffy had taken for them at Adrenaline City after Cyrus had finally won something at the stalls, he felt himself wanting to stop, to go no further, to switch off his phone. </p><p>But he didn&rsquo;t. </p><p>Cyrus took a deep breath, and, without any prompting from Buffy or Andi, pressed 'Block number&rsquo;.</p><p>~~~~~~</p><p><i>All complaints can be registered @ me lol</i></p>",

That\u2019s what he had expected to feel while seeing TJ and Kira together. And he did feel it at first, but soon enough, it numbed. Now every time he saw them, he just felt empty. And it wasn\u2019t like he could go to the swings to calm down anymore, the memory of seeing the two have so much fun in their spot, <i><b>their</b></i> safe place, he couldn\u2019t see the swingset again. </p><p><i>TJ didn\u2019t need him around anymore, he held onto Cyrus after the gun incident as he was between friends, but now he\u2019d found the perfect friend for him. </i>Cyrus tried to shake the thought out of his head but he knew it was true, that Kira had officially replaced him as the only person TJ could talk to. And he was happy for them. If happy was a dull ache everytime he looked across the courtyard at them. </p><p>A knocking on his door startled him out of his thoughts. Rubbing his eyes, he pushed himself off the bed and opened the door to see his mother standing there. </p><p>\u201cCy, honey, Amber just came by and she asked if you\u2019re there. What should I tell her?\u201d His mom asked softly, smiling gently. She didn\u2019t really know what had happened, but she could sense Cyrus\u2019 exhaustion, and recognised that he just wanted to be left alone. \u201cI could tell her some other time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo no, it\u2019s okay, mom. I\u2019ll go down,\u201d Cyrus said quietly, forcing himself to get up and walk down the stairs. Amber was sitting in the waiting room outside his mother\u2019s office, wringing her hands, her back facing the door. Cyrus sighed, and walked into the room. </p><p>\u201cHey Amber,\u201d He said, causing her to turn around, and Cyrus stopped short. </p><p>Amber\u2019s eyes were red and puffy, tears stains on her cheeks. Honestly, he hasn\u2019t seen Amber look this bad in a while, the last time being near the end of 7th grade, when she had first broken down to him about everything at home. Since then, she had kept her tears deep down inside, not letting it show. Until now. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for just turning up without warning, Cyrus, but I really really needed to talk to someone,\u201d Amber said, her voice hoarse. \u201cAnd I trust you a lot.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus gave a small smile, sitting down beside her as he grabbed her hand and squeezed it. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Jonah,\u201d She said softly, her voice barely louder than a whisper. She sniffed, holding up the back of her hand to her nose. </p><p>Cyrus just looked at her comfortingly, listening patiently. Amber looked up at the ceiling, taking a deep breath through her mouth. </p><p>\u201cWe had gone go carting the other day, on a date. And, I decided to tell him, that, that I loved him, you know? How could telling someone you love them go bad?\u201d She said with a sad laugh. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have done that. He just, freaked out, and walked away. I thought that he needed time, to tell me anything. Whether he felt the same or not, just for him to say anything. But, the next day, he came up and acted like nothing had happened, like everything was normal. And he went back to not texting me back much, not calling. I just, I don\u2019t know what I should have done instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmber, maybe that\u2019s Jonah\u2019s way of saying that he isn\u2019t sure and needs time?\u201d Cyrus suggested, looking at her. \u201cI mean, saying \u2018I love you\u2019re is a huge thing and it probably caught him off guard. He probably just needs to think it through. But you\u2019re still together right?\u201d</p><p>At that, Amber looked up at Cyrus, a tear rolling down her cheek. \u201cThat\u2019s just it, though. This is worse than normal. He really isn\u2019t talking to me as much over text or call, but when we meet, he acts as if nothing is wrong. I can\u2019t do it anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Cyrus asked, confused. </p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t hang out or talk to him for a while, I don\u2019t know how long. But I just can\u2019t do it. I need to stop talking to him, it\u2019s the best thing,\u201d Amber said, nodding to herself. Cyrus shook his head. </p><p>\u201cAmber, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s very healthy,\u201d Cyrus started but Amber shook her head vigorously, grabbing Cyrus\u2019 hand. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if it\u2019s healthy or not,\u201d She said, her voice desperate. \u201cBut, here\u2019s the thing. I am always the one to text or call, always trying to reach out. And I was always there for him. And I thought he felt the same way about me that I did about him. But, the truth is that, he doesn\u2019t want me, or need me. So, what\u2019s the point, right?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus was quiet, leaning back in his seat. Because everything Amber had just said hit him in a way it hadnt before. And from the nunbing emptiness of his mind, a sharp twinge of pain came up, cutting his heart. </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d He whispered, deep in thought. Amber furrowed her eyebrows, confused by Cyrus\u2019 sudden change in behavior. But soon, he shook his head, and turned back to Amber, as they continued to talk about everything and anything. </p><p>Amber left after an hour or so, and she and Cyrus clung to each other, grateful for the other just being there. After she left, Cyrus went back up to his room, Amber\u2019s words echoing in his mind. He forced himself to think of TJ and Kira at the swings, thinking about how TJ no longer needed him as a friend, as a crutch. He had lived out his usefulness. That\u2019s what he thought. </p><p>But TJ was acting like everything was okay, like nothing had happened, like Cyrus and him were okay and normal. And every time that was reminded to him, Cyrus could feel his heart twist more. </p><p><i>Like now</i>, he thought to himself, as he lay on his bed, and picked up the phone he had left there to see many text messages from TJ, many still coming in. Cyrus looked at the notifications, sighing sadly. He knew what he had to do. </p><p>The messages were still coming in, each looking more and more concerned. Cyrus opened TJ\u2019s contact on the phone, ignoring the pinging notifications. Seeing the picture of the two of them hugging, one Buffy had taken for them at Adrenaline City after Cyrus had finally won something at the stalls, he felt himself wanting to stop, to go no further, to switch off his phone. </p><p>But he didn\u2019t. </p><p>Cyrus took a deep breath, and, without any prompting from Buffy or Andi, pressed 'Block number\u2019.</p><p>~~~~~~</p><p><i>All complaints can be registered @ me lol</i></p></p>",

It\u2019s the end of the world, Buff, you\u2019re really gonna hold on to some petty grudge?\u201d Andi retorted.</p><p>Cyrus turned his head around while he continued walking in front of them. \u201cI can hear you, by the way, and I\u2019m still talking to him, too. It was his idea to meet up, anyway, not mine. I\u2019m trying to let it go, why can\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Buffy just sighed and not-so-subtly rolled her eyes. \u201cAt least Kira isn\u2019t here,\u201d she said, maybe a little louder than intended.</p><p>\u201cI know, right? Thank god she\u2019s finally not clinging on to me,\u201d TJ joined in on the complaining, while Amber laughed next to him.</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 eyebrows furrowed. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, I-uh, I\u2019ll just talk to you about it later?\u201d TJ stuttered out.</p><p>Cyrus squinted but nodded, as they arrived at the lake. Luckily enough, there was barely anyone there. Everyone was probably with their families, at least that\u2019s why all jobs had been closed down. (For the last time.)</p><p>They all sat down on the grass, the cooling ground soothing them all just the slightest bit. \u201cYou can kinda see it,\u201d Jonah said, looking up at the stars.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Andi asked, squinting.</p><p>\u201cSee the little star bigger than the rest of them? That\u2019s it, I think,\u201d he replied, pointing at the asteroid.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s gonna kill us, then,\u201d TJ mumbled.</p><p>\u201cI guess it all never really mattered, huh?\u201d Amber chimed in after a few moments.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Jonah asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, I mean, no matter how good we all were, no matter how much we all tried to do our best at things, we <i>still</i> are gonna end up not doing the best we ever could\u2019ve done. We don\u2019t get to live. It\u2019s over,\u201d she ranted.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. I mean, the world still sucks, what with all the climate issues, and bigotry and everything everywhere, but it doesn\u2019t matter now, I guess. It\u2019s all gonna be gone,\u201d Andi added on.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Buffy joined in, snapping them all out of their stupor, \u201cyeah, that all might be true. But up to this point, we\u2019ve been living our lives the best we could, right? Regardless of circumstances, we were all getting to a pretty great place, right? And we still have a little under six hours to do almost anything we\u2019ve ever wanted with no consequences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo consequences&hellip; that\u2019s it!\u201d Cyrus exclaimed, standing up. \u201cWe are not gonna just sit here and wallow in self-pity. We\u2019re gonna celebrate the lives we <i>did</i> lead and party the hardest that anyone ever has!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure that\u2019s a good idea?\u201d Buffy asked, standing up next to him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m up for it,\u201d TJ added, also standing, thus making the rest of the group get up in agreement.</p><p>\u201cSo, how are we doing this, then?\u201d</p><p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p><p>Four boxes of fireworks, two carts of food, and three raided department stores later, the group decided to head to the park for their party. (They didn\u2019t want to ruin the peacefulness of the lake, probably one of the last calm places still around.)</p><p>\u201cHey, none of our parents are here, right?\u201d Amber called out.</p><p>\u201cNo, why?\u201d Andi replied, connecting her phone to a bluetooth speaker.</p><p>\u201cAmber, you\u2019ve got to be kidding me,\u201d TJ could be heard scolding her, as she stood holding up a small box of beers. \u201cYou realize we\u2019re all only 16, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou all are, I\u2019m not,\u201d she replied, sitting down on the grass. \u201cWe\u2019re all dying today, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a horrible idea,\u201d he muttered, making his way over to Buffy and Cyrus.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got a point, Teej,\u201d Cyrus gestured over to her.</p><p>\u201cCyrus!\u201d Buffy exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cWhat? We haven\u2019t lived, and like you said, we\u2019ve got six hours to do whatever we want,\u201d he said, walking over to Amber.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant and you know it!\u201d Buffy called after him, but he dismissed her with a wave of his hand. She rolled her eyes, looking to TJ. \u201cHow\u2019ve you been? You\u2019ve been awfully distant for the past year and a half,\u201d she questioned, the ever-sarcastic tone to her voice evident.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been okay,\u201d TJ answered, ignoring her sardonic comment. \u201cCyrus and I\u2019ve been back on speaking terms for a few months, so I\u2019ve been better lately.\u201d</p><p>Buffy quirked an eyebrow. \u201cYou know, he never did tell us quite what happened on Costume Day. Why\u2019d you ditch?\u201d she asked, grabbing a soda from a nearby cooler.</p><p>TJ hesitated. \u201cI didn\u2019t actually tell him the whole story, so that makes sense.\u201d</p><p>Buffy rolled her eyes. \u201cSounds about right. Leave it to you to half-ass an apology to someone who means a lot to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I had a good reason,\u201d TJ defended.</p><p>She crossed her arms, soda forgotten. \u201cAnd what would that be?\u201d</p><p>Tj sighed, then whispered, \u201cIf I tell you, you have to promise not to tell anyone else. Including Cyrus. Amber is the only one who knows about it, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Buffy replied, but it came out more like a question as TJ grabbed her wrist and brought her over to sit down at the picnic table nearby.</p><p>TJ starts, taking a deep breath, \u201cThe day before Costume Day, Kira came up to me and asked if I wanted to do a costume with her, but I turned her down. Three times, actually, she kept persisting with it. Finally, she goes, \u2018So you\u2019d rather do a costume with Cyrus than with me? Have fun with that.\u2019 She said it like something was wrong with it, like she was implying that&hellip; that it was bad I would want to do a costume with a boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh&hellip; my god. What a bitch,\u201d Buffy gritted through her teeth.</p><p>\u201cYeah.

It&rsquo;s the end of the world, Buff, you&rsquo;re really gonna hold on to some petty grudge?&rdquo; Andi retorted.</p><p>Cyrus turned his head around while he continued walking in front of them. &ldquo;I can hear you, by the way, and I&rsquo;m still talking to him, too. It was his idea to meet up, anyway, not mine. I&rsquo;m trying to let it go, why can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>Buffy just sighed and not-so-subtly rolled her eyes. &ldquo;At least Kira isn&rsquo;t here,&rdquo; she said, maybe a little louder than intended.</p><p>&ldquo;I know, right? Thank god she&rsquo;s finally not clinging on to me,&rdquo; TJ joined in on the complaining, while Amber laughed next to him.</p><p>Cyrus&rsquo; eyebrows furrowed. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, I-uh, I&rsquo;ll just talk to you about it later?&rdquo; TJ stuttered out.</p><p>Cyrus squinted but nodded, as they arrived at the lake. Luckily enough, there was barely anyone there. Everyone was probably with their families, at least that&rsquo;s why all jobs had been closed down. (For the last time.)</p><p>They all sat down on the grass, the cooling ground soothing them all just the slightest bit. &ldquo;You can kinda see it,&rdquo; Jonah said, looking up at the stars.</p><p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; Andi asked, squinting.</p><p>&ldquo;See the little star bigger than the rest of them? That&rsquo;s it, I think,&rdquo; he replied, pointing at the asteroid.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s gonna kill us, then,&rdquo; TJ mumbled.</p><p>&ldquo;I guess it all never really mattered, huh?&rdquo; Amber chimed in after a few moments.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Jonah asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I mean, no matter how good we all were, no matter how much we all tried to do our best at things, we <i>still</i> are gonna end up not doing the best we ever could&rsquo;ve done. We don&rsquo;t get to live. It&rsquo;s over,&rdquo; she ranted.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. I mean, the world still sucks, what with all the climate issues, and bigotry and everything everywhere, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter now, I guess. It&rsquo;s all gonna be gone,&rdquo; Andi added on.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; Buffy joined in, snapping them all out of their stupor, &ldquo;yeah, that all might be true. But up to this point, we&rsquo;ve been living our lives the best we could, right? Regardless of circumstances, we were all getting to a pretty great place, right? And we still have a little under six hours to do almost anything we&rsquo;ve ever wanted with no consequences.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No consequences&hellip; that&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; Cyrus exclaimed, standing up. &ldquo;We are not gonna just sit here and wallow in self-pity. We&rsquo;re gonna celebrate the lives we <i>did</i> lead and party the hardest that anyone ever has!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure that&rsquo;s a good idea?&rdquo; Buffy asked, standing up next to him.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m up for it,&rdquo; TJ added, also standing, thus making the rest of the group get up in agreement.</p><p>&ldquo;So, how are we doing this, then?&rdquo;</p><p>&bull;&bull;&bull;</p><p>Four boxes of fireworks, two carts of food, and three raided department stores later, the group decided to head to the park for their party. (They didn&rsquo;t want to ruin the peacefulness of the lake, probably one of the last calm places still around.)</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, none of our parents are here, right?&rdquo; Amber called out.</p><p>&ldquo;No, why?&rdquo; Andi replied, connecting her phone to a bluetooth speaker.</p><p>&ldquo;Amber, you&rsquo;ve got to be kidding me,&rdquo; TJ could be heard scolding her, as she stood holding up a small box of beers. &ldquo;You realize we&rsquo;re all only 16, right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You all are, I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; she replied, sitting down on the grass. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all dying today, anyway.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This is a horrible idea,&rdquo; he muttered, making his way over to Buffy and Cyrus.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s got a point, Teej,&rdquo; Cyrus gestured over to her.</p><p>&ldquo;Cyrus!&rdquo; Buffy exclaimed.</p><p>&ldquo;What? We haven&rsquo;t lived, and like you said, we&rsquo;ve got six hours to do whatever we want,&rdquo; he said, walking over to Amber.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what I meant and you know it!&rdquo; Buffy called after him, but he dismissed her with a wave of his hand. She rolled her eyes, looking to TJ. &ldquo;How&rsquo;ve you been? You&rsquo;ve been awfully distant for the past year and a half,&rdquo; she questioned, the ever-sarcastic tone to her voice evident.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been okay,&rdquo; TJ answered, ignoring her sardonic comment. &ldquo;Cyrus and I&rsquo;ve been back on speaking terms for a few months, so I&rsquo;ve been better lately.&rdquo;</p><p>Buffy quirked an eyebrow. &ldquo;You know, he never did tell us quite what happened on Costume Day. Why&rsquo;d you ditch?&rdquo; she asked, grabbing a soda from a nearby cooler.</p><p>TJ hesitated. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t actually tell him the whole story, so that makes sense.&rdquo;</p><p>Buffy rolled her eyes. &ldquo;Sounds about right. Leave it to you to half-ass an apology to someone who means a lot to you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, I had a good reason,&rdquo; TJ defended.</p><p>She crossed her arms, soda forgotten. &ldquo;And what would that be?&rdquo;</p><p>Tj sighed, then whispered, &ldquo;If I tell you, you have to promise not to tell anyone else. Including Cyrus. Amber is the only one who knows about it, okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Buffy replied, but it came out more like a question as TJ grabbed her wrist and brought her over to sit down at the picnic table nearby.</p><p>TJ starts, taking a deep breath, &ldquo;The day before Costume Day, Kira came up to me and asked if I wanted to do a costume with her, but I turned her down. Three times, actually, she kept persisting with it. Finally, she goes, &lsquo;So you&rsquo;d rather do a costume with Cyrus than with me? Have fun with that.&rsquo; She said it like something was wrong with it, like she was implying that&hellip; that it was bad I would want to do a costume with a boy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh&hellip; my god. What a bitch,&rdquo; Buffy gritted through her teeth.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. She kept manipulating me every time I&rsquo;d want to talk to him or any of you guys, saying that people could tell, so eventually, over the course of the past two years, she became somewhat of a safety blanket since no one would, you know, suspect anything if I was with her,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;So, basically, I fucked everything up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; Buffy said, strong and sure, but then again, when wasn&rsquo;t she?
