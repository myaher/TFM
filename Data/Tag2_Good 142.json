He does his best to pick out the\nimportant, relevant parts, but the adverts are distracting and he\nhasn\u2019t figured out how to consistently identify them yet. Computers\nwere all well and good, but Aziraphale hasn\u2019t yet made up his mind\nabout this internet business, or this touch-screen business\u2014or\neven the Apple business\u2014but\nhe did like a few of the puzzle game apps.</p><p>\u201cMm-hmm,\u201d\nsays Crowley, using his index finger to scroll through the website\u2019s\nimage gallery. \u201cIt\u2019s a <i>calendar</i> contest. You vote on the\npicture you most want to see included. It\u2019s all submission based.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds\nsimple enough,\u201d says Aziraphale, in the way people do when they\ndon\u2019t want to admit they\u2019re not sure they grasp the concept\nentirely.
