The preparations, the stress, the rehearsals, the pep talk, all of it. </p><p>Every night of your brother telling you about this \u201cincredible woman named Meghan\u201d led up to him standing in front of the mirror with your hands on his shoulders as he breathed out, nervous but ready to marry the love of his life, </p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d </p><p>He nodded, smiling at you through the mirror before letting out a chuckle, \u201cI am. I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>The moments of you listening to your brothers talk to you about the women they love in their lives and you pestering them with questions about the feeling you had only ever read about, led to you sitting beside your father, sneaking glances at Harry who sat at the front with other friends, his eyes always already set on you. </p><p>\u201cYou really need to leave.\u201d You giggled as Harry peppered your face with kisses as you both stood hidden behind a wall before you left with Meghan. </p><p>\u201cI will, I will,\u201d Harry said absentmindedly, smiling down at you, \u201cMissed you all day.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI missed you, too,\u201d You smiled, \u201cMeghan is so nervous. Poor woman listed all possibilities of anything going wrong in under a minute when I asked her if she was okay.\u201d </p><p>\u201cShe is getting her wedding very publicly viewed,\u201d Harry shrugged, \u201cI can imagine some of her thoughts. But,\u201d </p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d You repeated as you stressed on the word, wrapping your arms around his neck.</p><p>\u201cBut her and your brother are in love with each other like mad so no matter what, it\u2019ll be worth it at the end.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAhh,\u201d You chuckled, throwing your head back a little and closing your eyes, \u201cThe words of a songwriter.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh hush,\u201d Harry nudged your forehead with his, \u201cI should go.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo should I.\u201d You replied, leaning up to peck his lips, \u201cI\u2019ll see you in a bit.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSee you in a bit, Princess.\u201d He teased, leaning down to press his lips to yours in kiss.</p><p><br/></p><p>And when you walked inside the chapel, holding Charlotte\u2019s hand as you walked behind Meghan and your bouquet of flowers with the other, a wide grin on your face as your eyes fell on your brother who stood waiting for his bride before you glanced at William who gave you a smile and a discreet nod of support. But God, when you saw Harry standing along everyone else who had their eyes on Meghan, his on you, you knew it. You knew all about the love you heard about. </p><p>With his eyes on you, a smile on his face as he gave you a quick thumbs up which made you giggle and look down at the ground as you walked, looking back at him to see him grinning with his eyebrows raised at you, \u201cBeautiful.\u201d He mouthed. </p><p>You helped Charlotte go up the step, stealing one last look at Harry before linking arms with your father after he walked Meghan to your brother, walking with him towards your seat as you listened to the melodies, smoothening down your dress before looking at your brother and his to-be wife as you stood. </p><p>\u201cHe looks happy.\u201d Your father leaned towards you to whisper. You looked at him with a smile and nodded, looking back at your brother. </p><p>When the harmonies were nearing an end, you looked behind you at your grandmother who instantly looked down at you, mirroring your grin quickly before giving you a nod and looking back at Harry. </p><p>\u201cGod is love, and those who live in love live in God and God lives in them.\u201d </p><p>You sat down, having a clear look at Harry who sat on the opposite side of you beside Serena Williams, looking at your brother and Meghan. </p><p>As you all stood to sing the Lord of All Hopefulness, you felt Harry\u2019s eyes on you as you both began singing, Harry smirking as he did as he looked at you with his head tilted. You caught yourself mid giggle, looking back down at your book. </p><p>As you all finished the hymn, everyone\u2019s eyes were on the couple as the archbishop spoke. </p><p>\u201cHarry, will you take Meghan to be your wife? Will you love her, comfort her, honour and protect her, and, forsaking all others, be faithful to her as long as you both shall live?\u201d </p><p>At this point, you were shamelessly letting your tears run as you grinned, watching you brother respond, \u201cI will.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMeghan, will you take Harry to be your husband? Will you love him, comfort him, honour and protect him, and, forsaking all others, be faithful to him as long as you both shall live?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh God.\u201d You whispered under your breath as you sniffled, wiping your tears.</p><p>\u201cWill you, the families and friends of Harry and Meghan, support and uphold them in their marriage now and in the years to come?\u201d</p><p>Your eyes were set on your boyfriend of 6 months as you all replied, \u201cWe will.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>//</p><p><br/></p><p>Your hands were around Harry\u2019s arm as you waved to the public in your evening dress, well aware of the fact that you were confirming your relationship as Harry stood beside you in his burgundy suit. He closed the passenger seat door, his hand moving to be placed on your back as yours mirrored his but wrapped your arm around his waist, looking down at your dress. </p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s stuck in my heel.\u201d You said, looking down at it and moving your foot to find it wrapped around the heel. </p><p>Being himself, Harry kneeled down, took your dress away from your heel and smoothened the dress for you before standing back up, \u201cAlright?\u201d </p><p>You hummed and nodded, smiling as you gave him a quick peck on his lips, \u201cThank you.\u201d </p><p>His smile sufficed as a reply, tugging you closer to himself as you began walking towards Frogmore House among other guests who definitely eyed you and Harry together. \u201cI think everyone might be staring too much because of how breathtaking you look right now.\u201d Harry leaned closer, whispering in your ear as his eyes remained on the gates. </p><p>He was aware of the blush on your face and the small giggle you stifled, despite you rolling your eyes jokingly at him and looking away, \u201cI mean it!\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a sap.\u201d You teased him, bumping your hip with his before waving to someone who waved at you.</p><p>\u201cFor youuuuuu.\u201d Harry nuzzled his face in your cheek, making you let out a small squeal before swatting his chest as you laughed. </p><p><br/></p><p>//</p><p><br/></p><p>You cleared your throat as you were standing, everyone\u2019s eyes on you with smiles on their faces and eagerness, waiting for your speech that everyone just knew would have them tearing up. </p><p>You looked at your brother and his wife, \u201cIt honestly feels like just yesterday Har was telling me about this incredible woman he met. I was so excited for him,\u201d You chuckled, \u201cIt might sound clich\u00e9 but he already looked in love to me and I knew, in that moment, how much of a wonderful woman Meghan was. </p><p>When I met Meghan, I knew why my brother was completely head over heels for her. She\u2019s smart, absolutely intelligent and so beautiful and it didn\u2019t take long for me to feel proud of Har. </p><p>And when I think about Har getting married, it makes me feel so old. I remember the good old rebellion days,\u201d You chuckled as everyone laughed knowingly, your brother hiding his face in his hands as he laughed, \u201cYou went through some tragically cool days. </p><p>Harry, thank you for always being there for me. For being someone I can always go to, no matter how much you annoy me sometimes. </p><p>Meghan, thank you for somehow agreeing to marry him,\u201d You joked as you cringed, \u201cAnd welcome to the family. To Harry and Meghan.\u201d You raised your glass up, grinning as everyone repeated in unison. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making me cry, Tiny!\u201d Your brother shouted before laughing as he wiped his cheek before giving you a smile and putting one hand to his heart, \u201cThank you. I love you.\u201d He mouthed.</p><p>You felt Harry\u2019s arm around your waist, making you lean on him as he wrapped both arms around you, \u201cThat was beautiful.\u201d </p><p>You looked at him with a bashful smile, slightly tipsy, \u201cWhy thank you.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>//</p><p><br/></p><p>As everyone got on their feet to dance again, that was Harry\u2019s cue to hold your hand and drag you out of your seat, tugging you closer towards where everyone was letting loose, \u201cCome on now!\u201d Harry grinned as he turned to look at you, holding your hands as he reached back before pulling you closer to him. It wasn\u2019t a secret that most people were drunk, Harry included as he danced with Eddie and Emma before pulling you closer to him, slow dancing to the upbeat song. Your hands were around his neck, letting him guide you through the swaying without caring about the song. </p><p>Harry\u2019s arms were around your waist, face nuzzled in your neck as your hands moved to his hair. He pressed a kiss to your neck before lifting his head up, slowly kissing your cheek, \u201cYou look so fucking beautiful right now and-\u201c </p><p>Harry closed his eyes, moving to peck your lips before pulling away, only to kiss you again and again, \u201cAnd I\u2019m so fucking in love with you.\u201d </p><p><br/></p><p>//</p><p><br/></p><p>You couldn\u2019t get drunk after that. You couldn\u2019t risk not remembering that moment. With Harry sleeping peacefully in your bed, his head leaning on yours and his arm around you, the sun coming up wasn\u2019t enough to get you to sleep nor wipe the smile off your face as you played with his hair. You didn\u2019t say it back. It wasn\u2019t that it wasn\u2019t mutual \u2014 it was. God, it definitely was. But you couldn\u2019t do it like that, not when he was drunk or asleep. </p><p>When you managed to get some sleep, waking up at 11 to Harry coming out of the bathroom arms above his head as he clipped back his hair with one of your clips, a grin making its way on his face once he caught sight of your eyes. \u201cGood morning, Smalls.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou know that was a zombie\u2019s name in some movie, right?\u201d You asked sleepily as you stretched in bed.</p><p>\u201cYou also know I call you that because you\u2019re simply small, right?\u201d Harry teased back, coming to lie on your bed and kissing your cheek, \u201cThank you for leaving Advil beside me.\u201d</p><p>You hummed, giving his scalp a quick scratch before getting up, \u201cNo problem, H,\u201d You walked inside your bathroom before closing the door to do your business, opening it once you were brushing your teeth to find Harry outside, \u201cYou were very drunk last night,\u201d You managed to say with foam in your mouth, \u201cSaid some stuff.\u201d You hinted, rinsing your mouth.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Harry smirked, leaning on the door, \u201cWhat did I say?\u201d </p><p>You shrugged as you put your facial wash, massaging your face with it, \u201cI don\u2019t know. Just- Some stuff. You know,\u201d You washed your face before looking at him as you dried your hands in a towel, \u201cDrunk stuff.\u201d </p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d He asked, watching you put your hair up in a ponytail, \u201cBecause I remember telling you that I\u2019m so fucking in love with you.\u201d At your movement halting, Harry straightened himself from his posture, approaching you. \u201cI remember that.\u201d </p><p>You tried to contain your grin as you blushed, looking at him through the mirror before turning, Harry wrapping his arms around your shoulders as you leaned your chin on his chest, \u201cDo you now?\u201d</p><p>He hummed, letting his hands fall to your back, \u201cI do. I remember it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt? What\u2019s it?\u201d You asked gently with a smile, wrapping your arms around his waist, \u201cWhat do you remember?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI remember,\u201d Harry\u2019s voice went low and gentle as he spoke slowly, \u201cTelling you,\u201d He raised an eyebrow before swaying the both of you in your place, \u201cI\u2019m in love with you.\u201d </p><p>If anything, Harry fell more in love when you giggled and hid your face in his chest, tightening your grasp on him, \u201cOh God.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, throwing his head back, \u201cCome ooooon, look at me.\u201d </p><p>You looked up at him, moving your hands to cup his face and squishing his cheeks together which you really wished was photographed in that moment, \u201cAnd I\u2019m in love with you, Styles.\u201d </p><p><br/></p><p>//</p><p><br/></p><p><i><b>w e l l how fucking clich\u00e9 and fluff-dripping was this? </b></i></p>",

The preparations, the stress, the rehearsals, the pep talk, all of it. </p><p>Every night of your brother telling you about this \u201cincredible woman named Meghan\u201d led up to him standing in front of the mirror with your hands on his shoulders as he breathed out, nervous but ready to marry the love of his life, </p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d </p><p>He nodded, smiling at you through the mirror before letting out a chuckle, \u201cI am. I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>The moments of you listening to your brothers talk to you about the women they love in their lives and you pestering them with questions about the feeling you had only ever read about, led to you sitting beside your father, sneaking glances at Harry who sat at the front with other friends, his eyes always already set on you. </p><p>\u201cYou really need to leave.\u201d You giggled as Harry peppered your face with kisses as you both stood hidden behind a wall before you left with Meghan. </p><p>\u201cI will, I will,\u201d Harry said absentmindedly, smiling down at you, \u201cMissed you all day.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI missed you, too,\u201d You smiled, \u201cMeghan is so nervous. Poor woman listed all possibilities of anything going wrong in under a minute when I asked her if she was okay.\u201d </p><p>\u201cShe is getting her wedding very publicly viewed,\u201d Harry shrugged, \u201cI can imagine some of her thoughts. But,\u201d </p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d You repeated as you stressed on the word, wrapping your arms around his neck.</p><p>\u201cBut her and your brother are in love with each other like mad so no matter what, it\u2019ll be worth it at the end.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAhh,\u201d You chuckled, throwing your head back a little and closing your eyes, \u201cThe words of a songwriter.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh hush,\u201d Harry nudged your forehead with his, \u201cI should go.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo should I.\u201d You replied, leaning up to peck his lips, \u201cI\u2019ll see you in a bit.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSee you in a bit, Princess.\u201d He teased, leaning down to press his lips to yours in kiss.</p><p><br></p><p>And when you walked inside the chapel, holding Charlotte\u2019s hand as you walked behind Meghan and your bouquet of flowers with the other, a wide grin on your face as your eyes fell on your brother who stood waiting for his bride before you glanced at William who gave you a smile and a discreet nod of support. But God, when you saw Harry standing along everyone else who had their eyes on Meghan, his on you, you knew it. You knew all about the love you heard about. </p><p>With his eyes on you, a smile on his face as he gave you a quick thumbs up which made you giggle and look down at the ground as you walked, looking back at him to see him grinning with his eyebrows raised at you, \u201cBeautiful.\u201d He mouthed. </p><p>You helped Charlotte go up the step, stealing one last look at Harry before linking arms with your father after he walked Meghan to your brother, walking with him towards your seat as you listened to the melodies, smoothening down your dress before looking at your brother and his to-be wife as you stood. </p><p>\u201cHe looks happy.\u201d Your father leaned towards you to whisper. You looked at him with a smile and nodded, looking back at your brother. </p><p>When the harmonies were nearing an end, you looked behind you at your grandmother who instantly looked down at you, mirroring your grin quickly before giving you a nod and looking back at Harry. </p><p>\u201cGod is love, and those who live in love live in God and God lives in them.\u201d </p><p>You sat down, having a clear look at Harry who sat on the opposite side of you beside Serena Williams, looking at your brother and Meghan. </p><p>As you all stood to sing the Lord of All Hopefulness, you felt Harry\u2019s eyes on you as you both began singing, Harry smirking as he did as he looked at you with his head tilted. You caught yourself mid giggle, looking back down at your book. </p><p>As you all finished the hymn, everyone\u2019s eyes were on the couple as the archbishop spoke. </p><p>\u201cHarry, will you take Meghan to be your wife? Will you love her, comfort her, honour and protect her, and, forsaking all others, be faithful to her as long as you both shall live?\u201d </p><p>At this point, you were shamelessly letting your tears run as you grinned, watching you brother respond, \u201cI will.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMeghan, will you take Harry to be your husband? Will you love him, comfort him, honour and protect him, and, forsaking all others, be faithful to him as long as you both shall live?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh God.\u201d You whispered under your breath as you sniffled, wiping your tears.</p><p>\u201cWill you, the families and friends of Harry and Meghan, support and uphold them in their marriage now and in the years to come?\u201d</p><p>Your eyes were set on your boyfriend of 6 months as you all replied, \u201cWe will.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>//</p><p><br></p><p>Your hands were around Harry\u2019s arm as you waved to the public in your evening dress, well aware of the fact that you were confirming your relationship as Harry stood beside you in his burgundy suit. He closed the passenger seat door, his hand moving to be placed on your back as yours mirrored his but wrapped your arm around his waist, looking down at your dress. </p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s stuck in my heel.\u201d You said, looking down at it and moving your foot to find it wrapped around the heel. </p><p>Being himself, Harry kneeled down, took your dress away from your heel and smoothened the dress for you before standing back up, \u201cAlright?\u201d </p><p>You hummed and nodded, smiling as you gave him a quick peck on his lips, \u201cThank you.\u201d </p><p>His smile sufficed as a reply, tugging you closer to himself as you began walking towards Frogmore House among other guests who definitely eyed you and Harry together. \u201cI think everyone might be staring too much because of how breathtaking you look right now.\u201d Harry leaned closer, whispering in your ear as his eyes remained on the gates. </p><p>He was aware of the blush on your face and the small giggle you stifled, despite you rolling your eyes jokingly at him and looking away, \u201cI mean it!\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a sap.\u201d You teased him, bumping your hip with his before waving to someone who waved at you.</p><p>\u201cFor youuuuuu.\u201d Harry nuzzled his face in your cheek, making you let out a small squeal before swatting his chest as you laughed. </p><p><br></p><p>//</p><p><br></p><p>You cleared your throat as you were standing, everyone\u2019s eyes on you with smiles on their faces and eagerness, waiting for your speech that everyone just knew would have them tearing up. </p><p>You looked at your brother and his wife, \u201cIt honestly feels like just yesterday Har was telling me about this incredible woman he met. I was so excited for him,\u201d You chuckled, \u201cIt might sound clich\u00e9 but he already looked in love to me and I knew, in that moment, how much of a wonderful woman Meghan was. </p><p>When I met Meghan, I knew why my brother was completely head over heels for her. She\u2019s smart, absolutely intelligent and so beautiful and it didn\u2019t take long for me to feel proud of Har. </p><p>And when I think about Har getting married, it makes me feel so old. I remember the good old rebellion days,\u201d You chuckled as everyone laughed knowingly, your brother hiding his face in his hands as he laughed, \u201cYou went through some tragically cool days. </p><p>Harry, thank you for always being there for me. For being someone I can always go to, no matter how much you annoy me sometimes. </p><p>Meghan, thank you for somehow agreeing to marry him,\u201d You joked as you cringed, \u201cAnd welcome to the family. To Harry and Meghan.\u201d You raised your glass up, grinning as everyone repeated in unison. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making me cry, Tiny!\u201d Your brother shouted before laughing as he wiped his cheek before giving you a smile and putting one hand to his heart, \u201cThank you. I love you.\u201d He mouthed.</p><p>You felt Harry\u2019s arm around your waist, making you lean on him as he wrapped both arms around you, \u201cThat was beautiful.\u201d </p><p>You looked at him with a bashful smile, slightly tipsy, \u201cWhy thank you.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>//</p><p><br></p><p>As everyone got on their feet to dance again, that was Harry\u2019s cue to hold your hand and drag you out of your seat, tugging you closer towards where everyone was letting loose, \u201cCome on now!\u201d Harry grinned as he turned to look at you, holding your hands as he reached back before pulling you closer to him. It wasn\u2019t a secret that most people were drunk, Harry included as he danced with Eddie and Emma before pulling you closer to him, slow dancing to the upbeat song. Your hands were around his neck, letting him guide you through the swaying without caring about the song. </p><p>Harry\u2019s arms were around your waist, face nuzzled in your neck as your hands moved to his hair. He pressed a kiss to your neck before lifting his head up, slowly kissing your cheek, \u201cYou look so fucking beautiful right now and-\u201c </p><p>Harry closed his eyes, moving to peck your lips before pulling away, only to kiss you again and again, \u201cAnd I\u2019m so fucking in love with you.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>//</p><p><br></p><p>You couldn\u2019t get drunk after that. You couldn\u2019t risk not remembering that moment. With Harry sleeping peacefully in your bed, his head leaning on yours and his arm around you, the sun coming up wasn\u2019t enough to get you to sleep nor wipe the smile off your face as you played with his hair. You didn\u2019t say it back. It wasn\u2019t that it wasn\u2019t mutual \u2014 it was. God, it definitely was.

He closed the passenger seat door, his hand moving to be placed on your back as yours mirrored his but wrapped your arm around his waist, looking down at your dress. </p><p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s stuck in my heel.&rdquo; You said, looking down at it and moving your foot to find it wrapped around the heel. </p><p>Being himself, Harry kneeled down, took your dress away from your heel and smoothened the dress for you before standing back up, &ldquo;Alright?&rdquo; </p><p>You hummed and nodded, smiling as you gave him a quick peck on his lips, &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; </p><p>His smile sufficed as a reply, tugging you closer to himself as you began walking towards Frogmore House among other guests who definitely eyed you and Harry together. &ldquo;I think everyone might be staring too much because of how breathtaking you look right now.&rdquo; Harry leaned closer, whispering in your ear as his eyes remained on the gates. </p><p>He was aware of the blush on your face and the small giggle you stifled, despite you rolling your eyes jokingly at him and looking away, &ldquo;I mean it!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re such a sap.&rdquo; You teased him, bumping your hip with his before waving to someone who waved at you.</p><p>&ldquo;For youuuuuu.&rdquo; Harry nuzzled his face in your cheek, making you let out a small squeal before swatting his chest as you laughed. </p><p><br /></p><p>//</p><p><br /></p><p>You cleared your throat as you were standing, everyone&rsquo;s eyes on you with smiles on their faces and eagerness, waiting for your speech that everyone just knew would have them tearing up. </p><p>You looked at your brother and his wife, &ldquo;It honestly feels like just yesterday Har was telling me about this incredible woman he met. I was so excited for him,&rdquo; You chuckled, &ldquo;It might sound clich&eacute; but he already looked in love to me and I knew, in that moment, how much of a wonderful woman Meghan was. </p><p>When I met Meghan, I knew why my brother was completely head over heels for her. She&rsquo;s smart, absolutely intelligent and so beautiful and it didn&rsquo;t take long for me to feel proud of Har. </p><p>And when I think about Har getting married, it makes me feel so old. I remember the good old rebellion days,&rdquo; You chuckled as everyone laughed knowingly, your brother hiding his face in his hands as he laughed, &ldquo;You went through some tragically cool days. </p><p>Harry, thank you for always being there for me. For being someone I can always go to, no matter how much you annoy me sometimes. </p><p>Meghan, thank you for somehow agreeing to marry him,&rdquo; You joked as you cringed, &ldquo;And welcome to the family. To Harry and Meghan.&rdquo; You raised your glass up, grinning as everyone repeated in unison. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re making me cry, Tiny!&rdquo; Your brother shouted before laughing as he wiped his cheek before giving you a smile and putting one hand to his heart, &ldquo;Thank you. I love you.&rdquo; He mouthed.</p><p>You felt Harry&rsquo;s arm around your waist, making you lean on him as he wrapped both arms around you, &ldquo;That was beautiful.&rdquo; </p><p>You looked at him with a bashful smile, slightly tipsy, &ldquo;Why thank you.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>//</p><p><br /></p><p>As everyone got on their feet to dance again, that was Harry&rsquo;s cue to hold your hand and drag you out of your seat, tugging you closer towards where everyone was letting loose, &ldquo;Come on now!&rdquo; Harry grinned as he turned to look at you, holding your hands as he reached back before pulling you closer to him. It wasn&rsquo;t a secret that most people were drunk, Harry included as he danced with Eddie and Emma before pulling you closer to him, slow dancing to the upbeat song. Your hands were around his neck, letting him guide you through the swaying without caring about the song. </p><p>Harry&rsquo;s arms were around your waist, face nuzzled in your neck as your hands moved to his hair. He pressed a kiss to your neck before lifting his head up, slowly kissing your cheek, &ldquo;You look so fucking beautiful right now and-&ldquo; </p><p>Harry closed his eyes, moving to peck your lips before pulling away, only to kiss you again and again, &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m so fucking in love with you.&rdquo; </p><p><br /></p><p>//</p><p><br /></p><p>You couldn&rsquo;t get drunk after that. You couldn&rsquo;t risk not remembering that moment. With Harry sleeping peacefully in your bed, his head leaning on yours and his arm around you, the sun coming up wasn&rsquo;t enough to get you to sleep nor wipe the smile off your face as you played with his hair. You didn&rsquo;t say it back. It wasn&rsquo;t that it wasn&rsquo;t mutual &mdash; it was. God, it definitely was. But you couldn&rsquo;t do it like that, not when he was drunk or asleep. </p><p>When you managed to get some sleep, waking up at 11 to Harry coming out of the bathroom arms above his head as he clipped back his hair with one of your clips, a grin making its way on his face once he caught sight of your eyes. &ldquo;Good morning, Smalls.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You know that was a zombie&rsquo;s name in some movie, right?&rdquo; You asked sleepily as you stretched in bed.</p><p>&ldquo;You also know I call you that because you&rsquo;re simply small, right?&rdquo; Harry teased back, coming to lie on your bed and kissing your cheek, &ldquo;Thank you for leaving Advil beside me.&rdquo;</p><p>You hummed, giving his scalp a quick scratch before getting up, &ldquo;No problem, H,&rdquo; You walked inside your bathroom before closing the door to do your business, opening it once you were brushing your teeth to find Harry outside, &ldquo;You were very drunk last night,&rdquo; You managed to say with foam in your mouth, &ldquo;Said some stuff.&rdquo; You hinted, rinsing your mouth.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; Harry smirked, leaning on the door, &ldquo;What did I say?&rdquo; </p><p>You shrugged as you put your facial wash, massaging your face with it, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Just- Some stuff. You know,&rdquo; You washed your face before looking at him as you dried your hands in a towel, &ldquo;Drunk stuff.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Like what?&rdquo; He asked, watching you put your hair up in a ponytail, &ldquo;Because I remember telling you that I&rsquo;m so fucking in love with you.&rdquo; At your movement halting, Harry straightened himself from his posture, approaching you. &ldquo;I remember that.&rdquo; </p><p>You tried to contain your grin as you blushed, looking at him through the mirror before turning, Harry wrapping his arms around your shoulders as you leaned your chin on his chest, &ldquo;Do you now?&rdquo;</p><p>He hummed, letting his hands fall to your back, &ldquo;I do. I remember it.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It? What&rsquo;s it?&rdquo; You asked gently with a smile, wrapping your arms around his waist, &ldquo;What do you remember?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; Harry&rsquo;s voice went low and gentle as he spoke slowly, &ldquo;Telling you,&rdquo; He raised an eyebrow before swaying the both of you in your place, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in love with you.&rdquo; </p><p>If anything, Harry fell more in love when you giggled and hid your face in his chest, tightening your grasp on him, &ldquo;Oh God.&rdquo;</p><p>He laughed, throwing his head back, &ldquo;Come ooooon, look at me.&rdquo; </p><p>You looked up at him, moving your hands to cup his face and squishing his cheeks together which you really wished was photographed in that moment, &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m in love with you, Styles.&rdquo; </p><p><br /></p><p>//</p><p><br /></p><p><i><b>w e l l how fucking clich&eacute; and fluff-dripping was this? </b></i></p></p>",

Does she need to tone it down?</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to prepare dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you, love, i ate at work\u201d She nodded, not knowing what to say.<br/></p><p>\u201cSo\u2026 Should we?\u201d he asked her in an oddly nonchalant voice.<br/></p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou know the por-\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, yeah, of course\u201d</p><p>He set the laptop on the table in front of the couch she\u2019s sitting on, he opened an allegedly\u00a0\u2018trusted\u2019 website. The suggested videos were pretty much all of a guy fucking a tied up girl, but one video in particular is of a girl riding a tied, blindfolded guy. At this point Harry was sub for a grand total of 11 times in their 3 year relationship.</p><p>\u201cWhich one do you want? or do you want something specific?\u201d He asked scanning the screen.<br/></p><p>\u201cHow about this one?\u201d She pointed to the one where the guy\u2019s a sub.<br/></p><p>\u201c\u2026Okay\u201d He reluctantly pressed on the video, he knew what she was getting at.</p><p>The video started straight to the action. The guy was naked, blindfolded, and tied up, his legs were spread, his cock was erect. Enters the girl who wearing a set of purple and black lingerie, she\u2019s wearing a black lace mask and her blonde wavy hair lands on her mid-back.</p><p>She sat next to him and slowly, but teasingly pumped his cock. She was teasing him, something she always wished to do to Harry, but couldn\u2019t because even when Harry\u2019s a sub he\u2019s still kind of a Dom. She wishes that one time, just once he\u2019d let her have her way with him.</p><p>Harry was beginning to tense up, she lifts her head from his shoulder and looked down at his crotch to see Styles Jr. (Kill me now) is excited, she took matters into her own hand began to unbutton his pants.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing, Princess?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just getting you off, baby\u201d<br/></p><p>She lowered his boxers and started pumping his cock, she was thriving on his moans and whimpers and his occasional curse word.</p><p>\u201cNo, baby, watch it.\u201d she told him with a certain authority, foreign to her tongue, when she noticed him close him eyes in pure bliss. He forced his eyes open to please her, this was the 12th time he was a sub and he doesn\u2019t even know it yet.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m close- Oh god\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cCome for me, baby\u201d after a few slow pumps and her thumb sliding over his slit occasionally, he came and was now sitting with his eyes closed trying to regulate his breathing and come down from his high, but before he could, Y/N was riding his soft cock, her moans were tuning out his whimpers that expressed he\u2019s in pain.<br/></p><p>\u201cPlease, it\u2019s too sensitive\u201d He muttered barely audible, even to someone who\u2019s a few centimeters away from him, such as Y/N.</p><p>For a second there, he forgot he had options, he forgot about the safe word. He didn\u2019t know whether it\u2019s just for Y/N or for subs in general, but he was so pained he really didn\u2019t care whether he had the right to say it or not, he just did.</p><p>\u201cRed\u201d<br/></p><p>Her actions were brought to an abrupt stop.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, baby?\u201d She asked, concerned as she wiped his tears that began falling just a few seconds after she pulled out.<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah, i\u2019m sorry, it was just sensitive, i didn\u2019t get a chance to come down from my high\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry.

HARRY IS MY NEW WEAKNESS, FUCK YOU GUYS!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p><b>Thanks for requesting.</b></p><p><b>A/N: This story is not purposed to make anyone uncomfortable or uneasy or to make light of serious problems, it&rsquo;s simply for entertainment. Intercourse is a very&nbsp;delicate subject and just because the male party is the one expressing pain doesn&rsquo;t make the situation&nbsp;any less serious. Your discretion is advised.</b></p><p>Today Y/N and Harry planned on watching porn together, to take some notes although they are 2 extremely kinky people, nonetheless, they wanted to try it.</p><p>She was waiting for Harry to comeback from the studio because they agreed to this together, but also because Harry&rsquo;s kind of the expert in choosing porn. It wasn&rsquo;t that she&rsquo;s never watched porn or anything, it&rsquo;s just that she didn&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;d like the ones she chose.</p><p>At around 6 PM Harry entered the house, greeting her with a kiss on her lips and a&nbsp;&lsquo;How are you, love?&rsquo; he climbed the stairs, presumably to change to more comfortable clothes, but Y/N was wondering if he forgot about this, they did plans this six to ten days ago.</p><p>When he descended down the stairs, the first thing she noticed was his now wet hair and he&rsquo;s carrying his laptop, he probably took a shower, what if he didn&rsquo;t forget, but he just isn&rsquo;t as eager as she is? Does she need to tone it down?</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want me to prepare dinner?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, thank you, love, i ate at work&rdquo; She nodded, not knowing what to say.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;So&hellip; Should we?&rdquo; he asked her in an oddly nonchalant voice.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You know the por-&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh, yeah, yeah, of course&rdquo;</p><p>He set the laptop on the table in front of the couch she&rsquo;s sitting on, he opened an allegedly&nbsp;&lsquo;trusted&rsquo; website. The suggested videos were pretty much all of a guy fucking a tied up girl, but one video in particular is of a girl riding a tied, blindfolded guy. At this point Harry was sub for a grand total of 11 times in their 3 year relationship.</p><p>&ldquo;Which one do you want? or do you want something specific?&rdquo; He asked scanning the screen.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;How about this one?&rdquo; She pointed to the one where the guy&rsquo;s a sub.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;Okay&rdquo; He reluctantly pressed on the video, he knew what she was getting at.</p><p>The video started straight to the action. The guy was naked, blindfolded, and tied up, his legs were spread, his cock was erect. Enters the girl who wearing a set of purple and black lingerie, she&rsquo;s wearing a black lace mask and her blonde wavy hair lands on her mid-back.</p><p>She sat next to him and slowly, but teasingly pumped his cock. She was teasing him, something she always wished to do to Harry, but couldn&rsquo;t because even when Harry&rsquo;s a sub he&rsquo;s still kind of a Dom. She wishes that one time, just once he&rsquo;d let her have her way with him.</p><p>Harry was beginning to tense up, she lifts her head from his shoulder and looked down at his crotch to see Styles Jr. (Kill me now) is excited, she took matters into her own hand began to unbutton his pants.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you think you&rsquo;re doing, Princess?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just getting you off, baby&rdquo;<br /></p><p>She lowered his boxers and started pumping his cock, she was thriving on his moans and whimpers and his occasional curse word.</p><p>&ldquo;No, baby, watch it.&rdquo; she told him with a certain authority, foreign to her tongue, when she noticed him close him eyes in pure bliss.
