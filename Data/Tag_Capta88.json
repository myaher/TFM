        "body": "<p>I watched Captain Marvel the\nmorning of writing this and to make things clear: <b>I liked it</b>. It was fun, I enjoyed her character (which I\u2019ll expand\non earlier) and best of all it wasn\u2019t in-your-face feminist propaganda. I call\nmyself apolitical, the \u201ca-\u201c prefix meaning \u201cnot\u201d so I am \u201cnot political\u201d. I\u2019m\nnot a feminist because there is modern baggage behind that word and there are\nvery few labels that I actually subscribe to. The ones I do usually have the \u201ca-\u201c\nprefix, so that probably says a lot about me.</p><p> \u00a0\nI hate that I have to bring this up but people, including people whose\nopinions I generally respect, can\u2019t see past the politics of a situation. I\u2019m\nnot <i>not</i> a feminist because I don\u2019t\nbelieve in the cause; I do. I\u2019m not some kind of red pill manist or whatever they\nare called, because I\u2019m comfortable in myself. I\u2019m apolitical because I see the\ncontent first and the agenda second. And Captain Marvel has good content. </p><p> \u00a0\nYes there are issues. I wouldn\u2019t be me if I didn\u2019t find problems with\nfiction. Where did Mar-vell get the Tesseract after Stark found it in the sea?\nWhy did only Carol get powers from the explosion and not the others who were\nthere? And it most definitely had the Marvel Cinematic Universe\u2019s villain\nproblem.</p><p>To make it clear this article is\nnot about the film, it\u2019s about people whose reviews repeatedly talk about the\nfreaking patriarchy. Such as yes, Jude Law\u2019s character is revealed to be a part\nof the conspiracy to suppress her true self. As a man he is clearly oppressing\nour female hero-</p><p> \u00a0\nOr maybe he\u2019s just a bad guy. You know, the bad guy. The villain. And we\nall know that if he had been a woman instead then the same people would claim\nthere were too many women in the film thus feminist agenda. You know what has\ntoo many female characters? The Supergirl television show. But if you were to\nswitch everybody\u2019s sexes then it would look like an ordinary male-lead show.\nYou could consider that as them pushing a bit too hard, but it is not only\nunderstandable but is also far from the worst part of that show.</p><p>So, our antagonist is suppressing\nthe powers of our hero. Maybe that\u2019s because as we see in the final part of the\nstory (what is known as the Falling Action and is when the heroes turn things\naround) she is practically unstoppable. Maybe it\u2019s because they are trying to\nuse her. Maybe it\u2019s because he shot her out of the sky six years ago and is\nresponsible for the death of the person she admires most and is possibly the\nperson who wiped her memory. Maybe it\u2019s not patriarchy but assholery. </p><p> \u00a0\nI started watching one review that said it was bad because it didn\u2019t\nfollow the Hero\u2019s Journey, an old method of story-telling that he claimed is\nessential to a good story (which it isn\u2019t, especially in our post-modern age)\nand while it seemed to follow it at the beginning it quickly departed. How?\nWell the mentor character (Jude Law again) wasn\u2019t actually a mentor character,\nhe just pretended to be one. Except he was a mentor, but the twist (admittedly\na predictable one) was that he was a villain. And if you think that doesn\u2019t\ncount, then look at it this way: he\u2019s training her to be a bad guy too. So he\u2019s\nstill a mentor.</p><p> \u00a0\nAnd he claimed that there was no \u201ccall to action\u201d, which is the reason\nwhy the hero ventures out to adventure, saying that she was just \u201csent on a\nmission\u201d. And yes, that wasn\u2019t a call to action (except maybe in the most\nliteral sense), the call to action comes later when she discovered hints about\nher past <i>and</i> found out that\neverything was in danger if she, the only person in the position to do so,\ndidn\u2019t help; by which I mean she was the only member of her organisation on\nEarth for the next day. If galactic danger and self-discovery aren\u2019t calls to\naction then just what is it that motivates most stories?</p><p> \u00a0\nSo clearly this guy wanted to dislike the film. I stopped watching less\nthan half way through his video after he said patriarchy for the fifth time.\nLike, shut up about it already.</p><p>The next complaint that I\u2019m going\nto cover is that apparently only boys like comics and so a strong female\ncharacter is off-putting? I\u2019m not sure, this guy confused me. Yes, comics were\n(and possibly still are; I don\u2019t check demographics) aimed at young teenage boys,\nhence the silly action and terrifyingly bombastic female figures (like\nseriously, those proportions would be fatal). But you know what I like? To use\nmy own terminology, capable characters.</p><p> \u00a0\nI don\u2019t use \u201cstrong\u201d as an adjective without purpose because it has\nconnotations of physical power, which isn\u2019t what is meant by \u201cstrong female\ncharacters\u201d. I use capable because I feel it is a better fit. Carol Danvers is\ncapable, strong and generally badass anyway. Why? Well for one thing, she\nalways gets back up. You know, that thing that Captain America always does?\nThat is important to his character? She does it too, and it is hinted at all\nthroughout the film so it isn\u2019t just some cheap \u201cdrama\u201d for the climax.</p><p> \u00a0\nI\u2019m going to go full nerd here and talk about anime. My favourite\ncharacters in the action genre have always been those who stand back up. They\nget beaten down (physically or mentally) and force themselves back up. It\u2019s\ncheesy as all hell and it is done in anime better than I usually see in western\ncomics or films and stuff. It\u2019s cool, it\u2019s dramatic and it works really well at\ngetting you to root for the hero.</p><p> \u00a0\nMany people probably know of Dragon Ball Z and we see it in Goku, the\nhero of that series. I\u2019d also like to point out that when it comes to raw\npower, the Dragon Ball fighters are similar yet stronger than Captain Marvel. A\ncharacter in the series who is less frequently called \u201cstrong\u201d is Bulma. She\nisn\u2019t a fighter and she doesn\u2019t have all of the superpowers of Goku or the\nothers, but she\u2019s a scientist who often provides support. More than that\nthough, she never lets her lack of planet-destroying power prevent her from\nstanding side by side with the fighters. Heck, she stands up to literal gods\nwhen they piss her off. </p><p> \u00a0\nShe is what I think of as a capable female character, because she can\u2019t\nkick ass but that doesn\u2019t make her weak.</p><p>Growing up, Carol Danvers is\nobviously what we call a \u201ctomboy\u201d. She wants to do what the boys do and she\npushes herself to do so, despite being condescended to regularly for it. She\nliterally gets knocked down, she falls and she (again literally) crashes and\nshe gets back up.

A woman can be emotionally\nmanipulated only to pick herself back up. And because they aren\u2019t masculine\nactions, seeing a female character do so isn\u2019t at all feminism. It\u2019s just a\nperson doing what a person does.</p><p>So, what else? Well there are\ncomplaints about her character being \u201csnarky\u201d or her being a bad loser (she is\nbeaten in a sparring match and lashes out). Except I loved seeing her cocky\nmannerisms (which are common in male action heroes) and her obvious pleasure to\nbe doing something, because it\u2019s pretty clear that they haven\u2019t let her do\nanything but train for the last six years. And this isn\u2019t patriarchy again, she\nis in a military group with strict guidelines on when you are ready to go into\nthe field (plus as we know, they are scared of her power). </p><p> \u00a0\nShe was bored, she was restless. She\u2019s a character who obviously like to\nact, being held back. That\u2019s why she lashed out; she was frustrated and angry at\nnot doing anything and yes, it could be seen as a flaw. But it\u2019s a humanising\nand understandable flaw if you just try to empathise with her instead of\nlooking for things to dislike. And one last point, Jude Law\u2019s character said\nthat if she couldn\u2019t control her power then she\u2019d have to visit the Supreme\nIntelligence(SI), who is a sort of commanding officer (I don\u2019t know the\nterminology). So what does Danvers do? She uses it. It is not a stretch at all\nto suppose that she may have intentionally lashed out so that she could confront\nthe SI. Plus, they are all something that we see again and again in male action\nheroes.</p><p> \u00a0\nYes, I keep comparing her to male action heroes and that\u2019s because she\nis also an action hero. They will have similar traits regardless of sex or\ngender. She is confident and willing to have a laugh and it is great to see.</p><p> \u00a0\nAnd finally, and this may come across badly but hear me out first, I\nloved seeing her smile. I don\u2019t mean that in the \u201cgive us a smile, love\u201d, but\nin the \u201cshe\u2019s excited\u201d way. I love to see people excited and when she\u2019s about\nto go on a mission or when she\u2019s figuring out her powers towards the end, she\nis clearly having fun.</p><p> \u00a0\nI\u2019d love to see that in a male character too, it doesn\u2019t matter. Seeing\naction heroes excited to do what they do, is great. Again, that\u2019s something we\nsee a lot in anime so it\u2019s no surprise that I like seeing it here.</p><p>This has run longer than I intended\nso, to conclude: Captain Marvel is an action hero who is frustrated from doing\nnothing for six years and when she gets the chance, she acts. She is driven,\nher power is suppressed and she is oh-so clearly a good person.

I\u2019m apolitical because I see the\ncontent first and the agenda second. And Captain Marvel has good content. </p><p> \u00a0\nYes there are issues. I wouldn\u2019t be me if I didn\u2019t find problems with\nfiction. Where did Mar-vell get the Tesseract after Stark found it in the sea?\nWhy did only Carol get powers from the explosion and not the others who were\nthere? And it most definitely had the Marvel Cinematic Universe\u2019s villain\nproblem.</p><p>To make it clear this article is\nnot about the film, it\u2019s about people whose reviews repeatedly talk about the\nfreaking patriarchy. Such as yes, Jude Law\u2019s character is revealed to be a part\nof the conspiracy to suppress her true self. As a man he is clearly oppressing\nour female hero-</p><p> \u00a0\nOr maybe he\u2019s just a bad guy. You know, the bad guy. The villain. And we\nall know that if he had been a woman instead then the same people would claim\nthere were too many women in the film thus feminist agenda. You know what has\ntoo many female characters? The Supergirl television show. But if you were to\nswitch everybody\u2019s sexes then it would look like an ordinary male-lead show.\nYou could consider that as them pushing a bit too hard, but it is not only\nunderstandable but is also far from the worst part of that show.</p><p>So, our antagonist is suppressing\nthe powers of our hero. Maybe that\u2019s because as we see in the final part of the\nstory (what is known as the Falling Action and is when the heroes turn things\naround) she is practically unstoppable. Maybe it\u2019s because they are trying to\nuse her. Maybe it\u2019s because he shot her out of the sky six years ago and is\nresponsible for the death of the person she admires most and is possibly the\nperson who wiped her memory. Maybe it\u2019s not patriarchy but assholery. </p><p> \u00a0\nI started watching one review that said it was bad because it didn\u2019t\nfollow the Hero\u2019s Journey, an old method of story-telling that he claimed is\nessential to a good story (which it isn\u2019t, especially in our post-modern age)\nand while it seemed to follow it at the beginning it quickly departed. How?\nWell the mentor character (Jude Law again) wasn\u2019t actually a mentor character,\nhe just pretended to be one. Except he was a mentor, but the twist (admittedly\na predictable one) was that he was a villain. And if you think that doesn\u2019t\ncount, then look at it this way: he\u2019s training her to be a bad guy too. So he\u2019s\nstill a mentor.</p><p> \u00a0\nAnd he claimed that there was no \u201ccall to action\u201d, which is the reason\nwhy the hero ventures out to adventure, saying that she was just \u201csent on a\nmission\u201d.

If galactic danger and self-discovery aren\u2019t calls to\naction then just what is it that motivates most stories?</p><p> \u00a0\nSo clearly this guy wanted to dislike the film. I stopped watching less\nthan half way through his video after he said patriarchy for the fifth time.\nLike, shut up about it already.</p><p>The next complaint that I\u2019m going\nto cover is that apparently only boys like comics and so a strong female\ncharacter is off-putting? I\u2019m not sure, this guy confused me. Yes, comics were\n(and possibly still are; I don\u2019t check demographics) aimed at young teenage boys,\nhence the silly action and terrifyingly bombastic female figures (like\nseriously, those proportions would be fatal). But you know what I like? To use\nmy own terminology, capable characters.</p><p> \u00a0\nI don\u2019t use \u201cstrong\u201d as an adjective without purpose because it has\nconnotations of physical power, which isn\u2019t what is meant by \u201cstrong female\ncharacters\u201d. I use capable because I feel it is a better fit. Carol Danvers is\ncapable, strong and generally badass anyway. Why? Well for one thing, she\nalways gets back up. You know, that thing that Captain America always does?\nThat is important to his character? She does it too, and it is hinted at all\nthroughout the film so it isn\u2019t just some cheap \u201cdrama\u201d for the climax.</p><p> \u00a0\nI\u2019m going to go full nerd here and talk about anime. My favourite\ncharacters in the action genre have always been those who stand back up. They\nget beaten down (physically or mentally) and force themselves back up. It\u2019s\ncheesy as all hell and it is done in anime better than I usually see in western\ncomics or films and stuff. It\u2019s cool, it\u2019s dramatic and it works really well at\ngetting you to root for the hero.</p><p> \u00a0\nMany people probably know of Dragon Ball Z and we see it in Goku, the\nhero of that series. I\u2019d also like to point out that when it comes to raw\npower, the Dragon Ball fighters are similar yet stronger than Captain Marvel. A\ncharacter in the series who is less frequently called \u201cstrong\u201d is Bulma. She\nisn\u2019t a fighter and she doesn\u2019t have all of the superpowers of Goku or the\nothers, but she\u2019s a scientist who often provides support.

                "content": "<p>I watched Captain Marvel the\nmorning of writing this and to make things clear: <b>I liked it</b>. It was fun, I enjoyed her character (which I&rsquo;ll expand\non earlier) and best of all it wasn&rsquo;t in-your-face feminist propaganda. I call\nmyself apolitical, the &ldquo;a-&ldquo; prefix meaning &ldquo;not&rdquo; so I am &ldquo;not political&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m\nnot a feminist because there is modern baggage behind that word and there are\nvery few labels that I actually subscribe to. The ones I do usually have the &ldquo;a-&ldquo;\nprefix, so that probably says a lot about me.</p><p> &nbsp;\nI hate that I have to bring this up but people, including people whose\nopinions I generally respect, can&rsquo;t see past the politics of a situation. I&rsquo;m\nnot <i>not</i> a feminist because I don&rsquo;t\nbelieve in the cause; I do. I&rsquo;m not some kind of red pill manist or whatever they\nare called, because I&rsquo;m comfortable in myself. I&rsquo;m apolitical because I see the\ncontent first and the agenda second. And Captain Marvel has good content. </p><p> &nbsp;\nYes there are issues. I wouldn&rsquo;t be me if I didn&rsquo;t find problems with\nfiction. Where did Mar-vell get the Tesseract after Stark found it in the sea?\nWhy did only Carol get powers from the explosion and not the others who were\nthere? And it most definitely had the Marvel Cinematic Universe&rsquo;s villain\nproblem.</p><p>To make it clear this article is\nnot about the film, it&rsquo;s about people whose reviews repeatedly talk about the\nfreaking patriarchy. Such as yes, Jude Law&rsquo;s character is revealed to be a part\nof the conspiracy to suppress her true self. As a man he is clearly oppressing\nour female hero-</p><p> &nbsp;\nOr maybe he&rsquo;s just a bad guy. You know, the bad guy. The villain. And we\nall know that if he had been a woman instead then the same people would claim\nthere were too many women in the film thus feminist agenda. You know what has\ntoo many female characters? The Supergirl television show. But if you were to\nswitch everybody&rsquo;s sexes then it would look like an ordinary male-lead show.\nYou could consider that as them pushing a bit too hard, but it is not only\nunderstandable but is also far from the worst part of that show.</p><p>So, our antagonist is suppressing\nthe powers of our hero. Maybe that&rsquo;s because as we see in the final part of the\nstory (what is known as the Falling Action and is when the heroes turn things\naround) she is practically unstoppable. Maybe it&rsquo;s because they are trying to\nuse her. Maybe it&rsquo;s because he shot her out of the sky six years ago and is\nresponsible for the death of the person she admires most and is possibly the\nperson who wiped her memory. Maybe it&rsquo;s not patriarchy but assholery. </p><p> &nbsp;\nI started watching one review that said it was bad because it didn&rsquo;t\nfollow the Hero&rsquo;s Journey, an old method of story-telling that he claimed is\nessential to a good story (which it isn&rsquo;t, especially in our post-modern age)\nand while it seemed to follow it at the beginning it quickly departed. How?\nWell the mentor character (Jude Law again) wasn&rsquo;t actually a mentor character,\nhe just pretended to be one. Except he was a mentor, but the twist (admittedly\na predictable one) was that he was a villain. And if you think that doesn&rsquo;t\ncount, then look at it this way: he&rsquo;s training her to be a bad guy too. So he&rsquo;s\nstill a mentor.</p><p> &nbsp;\nAnd he claimed that there was no &ldquo;call to action&rdquo;, which is the reason\nwhy the hero ventures out to adventure, saying that she was just &ldquo;sent on a\nmission&rdquo;. And yes, that wasn&rsquo;t a call to action (except maybe in the most\nliteral sense), the call to action comes later when she discovered hints about\nher past <i>and</i> found out that\neverything was in danger if she, the only person in the position to do so,\ndidn&rsquo;t help; by which I mean she was the only member of her organisation on\nEarth for the next day. If galactic danger and self-discovery aren&rsquo;t calls to\naction then just what is it that motivates most stories?</p><p> &nbsp;\nSo clearly this guy wanted to dislike the film. I stopped watching less\nthan half way through his video after he said patriarchy for the fifth time.\nLike, shut up about it already.</p><p>The next complaint that I&rsquo;m going\nto cover is that apparently only boys like comics and so a strong female\ncharacter is off-putting? I&rsquo;m not sure, this guy confused me. Yes, comics were\n(and possibly still are; I don&rsquo;t check demographics) aimed at young teenage boys,\nhence the silly action and terrifyingly bombastic female figures (like\nseriously, those proportions would be fatal). But you know what I like? To use\nmy own terminology, capable characters.</p><p> &nbsp;\nI don&rsquo;t use &ldquo;strong&rdquo; as an adjective without purpose because it has\nconnotations of physical power, which isn&rsquo;t what is meant by &ldquo;strong female\ncharacters&rdquo;. I use capable because I feel it is a better fit. Carol Danvers is\ncapable, strong and generally badass anyway. Why? Well for one thing, she\nalways gets back up. You know, that thing that Captain America always does?\nThat is important to his character? She does it too, and it is hinted at all\nthroughout the film so it isn&rsquo;t just some cheap &ldquo;drama&rdquo; for the climax.</p><p> &nbsp;\nI&rsquo;m going to go full nerd here and talk about anime. My favourite\ncharacters in the action genre have always been those who stand back up. They\nget beaten down (physically or mentally) and force themselves back up. It&rsquo;s\ncheesy as all hell and it is done in anime better than I usually see in western\ncomics or films and stuff. It&rsquo;s cool, it&rsquo;s dramatic and it works really well at\ngetting you to root for the hero.</p><p> &nbsp;\nMany people probably know of Dragon Ball Z and we see it in Goku, the\nhero of that series. I&rsquo;d also like to point out that when it comes to raw\npower, the Dragon Ball fighters are similar yet stronger than Captain Marvel. A\ncharacter in the series who is less frequently called &ldquo;strong&rdquo; is Bulma. She\nisn&rsquo;t a fighter and she doesn&rsquo;t have all of the superpowers of Goku or the\nothers, but she&rsquo;s a scientist who often provides support. More than that\nthough, she never lets her lack of planet-destroying power prevent her from\nstanding side by side with the fighters. Heck, she stands up to literal gods\nwhen they piss her off. </p><p> &nbsp;\nShe is what I think of as a capable female character, because she can&rsquo;t\nkick ass but that doesn&rsquo;t make her weak.</p><p>Growing up, Carol Danvers is\nobviously what we call a &ldquo;tomboy&rdquo;. She wants to do what the boys do and she\npushes herself to do so, despite being condescended to regularly for it. She\nliterally gets knocked down, she falls and she (again literally) crashes and\nshe gets back up. Even more impressive for me is that she is mentally and\nemotionally shaken, but stands up again to protect others and to regain control\nof her life.</p><p> &nbsp;\nAnd there is nothing in that above paragraph that is uniquely masculine.\n</p><p> &nbsp;\nA girl can fall over and stand back up. A woman can be emotionally\nmanipulated only to pick herself back up. And because they aren&rsquo;t masculine\nactions, seeing a female character do so isn&rsquo;t at all feminism. It&rsquo;s just a\nperson doing what a person does.</p><p>So, what else? Well there are\ncomplaints about her character being &ldquo;snarky&rdquo; or her being a bad loser (she is\nbeaten in a sparring match and lashes out). Except I loved seeing her cocky\nmannerisms (which are common in male action heroes) and her obvious pleasure to\nbe doing something, because it&rsquo;s pretty clear that they haven&rsquo;t let her do\nanything but train for the last six years. And this isn&rsquo;t patriarchy again, she\nis in a military group with strict guidelines on when you are ready to go into\nthe field (plus as we know, they are scared of her power). </p><p> &nbsp;\nShe was bored, she was restless. She&rsquo;s a character who obviously like to\nact, being held back. That&rsquo;s why she lashed out; she was frustrated and angry at\nnot doing anything and yes, it could be seen as a flaw. But it&rsquo;s a humanising\nand understandable flaw if you just try to empathise with her instead of\nlooking for things to dislike. And one last point, Jude Law&rsquo;s character said\nthat if she couldn&rsquo;t control her power then she&rsquo;d have to visit the Supreme\nIntelligence(SI), who is a sort of commanding officer (I don&rsquo;t know the\nterminology). So what does Danvers do? She uses it. It is not a stretch at all\nto suppose that she may have intentionally lashed out so that she could confront\nthe SI. Plus, they are all something that we see again and again in male action\nheroes.</p><p> &nbsp;\nYes, I keep comparing her to male action heroes and that&rsquo;s because she\nis also an action hero. They will have similar traits regardless of sex or\ngender. She is confident and willing to have a laugh and it is great to see.</p><p> &nbsp;\nAnd finally, and this may come across badly but hear me out first, I\nloved seeing her smile. I don&rsquo;t mean that in the &ldquo;give us a smile, love&rdquo;, but\nin the &ldquo;she&rsquo;s excited&rdquo; way. I love to see people excited and when she&rsquo;s about\nto go on a mission or when she&rsquo;s figuring out her powers towards the end, she\nis clearly having fun.</p><p> &nbsp;\nI&rsquo;d love to see that in a male character too, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.
