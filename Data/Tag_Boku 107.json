Unknown to them that their child mourned for the loss of an entire world she would never return to.</p><p>But the world never wants for the sake of one person, so life moved on. Saki quietly let go of her fading past and with trembling chubby fingers grasped on to her new world.</p><p>Saki upon reconciling with her new life, reflected upon her actions the past few weeks and had flushed red upon realizing how troubled her new parents were with her constant wailing and had resolved herself to be a good child for them. Partly out of guilt, the chestnut haired child mused, as her new mother combed through her slowly growing locks.</p><p><i>I stole the life of the child you should have had. Its the least I should do.</i></p><p>So the girl tried to love and fell to love. She adored her kind and comforting new family and life slowly fell into place for the old soul. Saki adapted and watched as three seasons passed.</p><p>It was on a bright spring day that Life decided to kick the girl into the curb again.</p><p>Sitting in front of the television and absentmindedly watching the children\u2019s anime playing across the scene, Saki squished the soft plush bunny between her fingers as she tried to practice her finger\u2019s coordination. Listening to the anime, the girl scrunched her nose as she tried to make sense of the Kanji being used.</p><p>The broken sound of ceramic and yelp of pain broke the child out of her musing.</p><p>\u201cMama?!\u201d</p><p>Scrambling to her feet, the toddler stumbled over her two feet to reach the source of the noise and when she reached the kitchen her jaw dropped. The floor was littered with jagged porcelain and her mothers fingers cut and bleeding profusely.</p><p>\u201cAra? Saki if you come closer you will get hurt.\u201d Saki\u2019s mom had a serene smile as she clutched her fingers close to her chest. At the time, Saki faced pinched at how air-headed her mother had to be to wave off what obviously had to be a painful injury.</p><p>\u201cBut!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo buts! besides this is nothing.\u201d</p><p>The older woman had gently admonished the child but as she her cild\u2019s distress she giggled before she held out her hands and to the toddler\u2019s astonishment the wounds slowly but surely <i>closed up on their own</i>.</p><p><i>\u2026 I\u2019m pretty sure wounds don\u2019t heal that quickly.</i></p><p>Saki\u2019s head tilted to the side and she mimed a fish as she tried to make sense of the phenomenon that she just witnessed. Long enough for her father who had come down from the second floor to see what had caused the ruckus and chuckle at his child\u2019s reaction.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s shocked you so much my little blossom?\u201d Saki\u2019s father had a wry grin on his lips as he bundled her up in his warm arms.</p><p>\u201cI was showing her my Quirk. I think this is the first time she has ever seen it Dear.\u201d </p><p><i>A sense of foreboding, a jogged memory from her fogged past.</i></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because there hasn\u2019t been a need for her to see your Quirk Honey.\u201d</p><p><i>Recognition from a past long gone. Children in a school gifted with the supernatural.</i></p><p>\u201cTrue, minor regeneration isn\u2019t something I can show so easily. But anyway, Dear could you please?\u201d</p><p><i>A forest ablaze in blue flames. Children collapsed on the floor as a pink gas embraced their forms. Their peers bleeding as they braced themselves against the darkness.</i></p><p>\u201cOf course Honey!\u201d</p><p>The porcelain pieces started to float and was lifted gently before displaced into the trash. The child paling as the pieces in her memory clicked into place. She vaguely remembered her Mom giggling as she poked my cheek to snap me out of my shock.</p><p><i>Two boys anxiously watching the large Television screen. The Symbol of Peace, weary and injured but standing tall. Fulfilled in his duty and pointing to the camera.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re next.\u201d</i></p><p>The evidence was standing in from of her and yet the child could only remember her dropping stomach as she pieced together where she was reborn into. A world only thought to be fiction but was now her reality.</p><p><i>Oh god i\u2019m in a world where the supernatural is the absolute normal.</i></p><p>Unknown to her parents, Saki panicked at the revelation but her denial at where she was dropped into abated after she considered the facts for a while. </p><p>Her parents had very minor quirks, her mother had a minor regeneration quirk while her father had a minor telekinesis quirk. Given that, it was likely that I would manifest a minor version of either of their quirks or a minor combined version of their quirk.</p><p>Which meant that Saki would not be pressured to become a Hero.</p><p>At that, Saki sighed in relief. </p><p>She did not want society to force her to risk her life for others when she did not have the mental or physical strength to do so. The vague reminder of her death made Saki shiver uncontrollably and she was glad she did not have to face that again for as long as possible.</p><p>The tiny girl was content to be the norm in the world of the extraordinary.</p><p>But Life does not cater to the whims of a single person, and once again threw her to the wolves.</p><p>Come her fourth birthday, and Saki was slow to show any signs of a quirk. When she fell and bruised her arms, they healed at a normal rate. When Saki focused on an object, it did not levitate.</p><p>Nothing out of the ordinary changed.</p><p>As expected, despite how lighthearted her parents usually are, they were quite worried to realize how late their child\u2019s quirk was coming in. So hand in hand, Saki was taken to the hospital for a check up.</p><p>Saki learned two things that day.</p><p>She did not have double joint, so she did have a quirk.</p><p>Just\u2026 not quite a visible one.</p><p>At first, the doctors considered that she might have a dormant quirk that required certain stimulation to activate. So she went through testing and physical activities to try to activate the quirk. </p><p>However, the tests came out negative so it was assumed that Saki did not have a dormant quirk but instead an invisible quirk.</p><p>An invisible quirk was as its name implied, a passive quirk that is constantly active but is so minor that it basically doesn\u2019t seem to be visible.</p><p>So after the results were presented and her parents reassured, her parents brought her back home. Saki was still loved and cared for the same as before. Her home life remained the warm heaven that it was.</p><p>But of course, things never go that smoothly outside her haven.</p><p>Returning to kindergarten with no quirk to show off quickly made the tiny girl the class pariah. The kids assumed if she could not show a quirk meant that she was quirkless and suddenly she was not \u2018good enough\u2019 to the everyone. Saki had not changed, and in a world where you had to show off some ability and have nothing to show for, you were punished for it in the form of isolation and bullying.</p><p><i>Children were innocent. They had no concept of what was right and what was wrong. They only acted according to what other said was \u2018right\u2019. The product of a society molding them to their image. </i></p><p><i>It was childlike. It was pure. It was cruel.</i></p><p>The Manga did not elaborate on how bad this quirk obsessed society could be to the quirkless. Often, Saki was tugged in two extremes, either bullied for being \u2018useless\u2019 or treated with the kid gloves for being too \u2018fragile\u2019.</p><p>In the quiet night and hidden underneath the covers, Saki had considered how amazing Midoriya was. To endure when society deemed his dream just a dream. To still reach for what was considered the impossible.</p><p>Midoriya had determination in spades. And Saki had none in contrast.</p><p>However, life was not \u2018bad\u2019. While Saki could not escape the stigma that was being considered \u2018quirkless\u2019 she could avoid some of the problems that came her way.</p><p>She never responded to taunts-the sharp barbs thrown her way to bring her down for the short enjoyment of the few-and bullies eventually considered a worthless \u2018target\u2019 and soon left her alone. Her belongings safe from the grubby hands of children who did not understand enough.</p><p>No one bothered her after a while, but at the same time she had no one outside her family.</p><p>Her family worried, her kind parents fretting in the night under the darkness. They whispered their fear of their sole child left with no companions. All the while the old soul hid behind the door and her gaze was trained to the floor before slowly walking back to her room.</p><p>Saki dealt with things the best way she could. It helped that as an introvert she became tired of social interaction quickly and retired to herself. In a sense, Saki was free of responsibility and pressure. Free of society who judged for Quirk and not the person behind it.</p><p>Free to choose whatever path may walk.</p><p>Looking at the bright side, Saki was glad she was reborn in this world. If she had been reborn in Naruto or One Piece, her uselessness was a dead end in the making. So she dealt with life and moved on.</p><p><i>She ignored the pitiful looks of their neighbors. The awful whispers of condolences to her parents for bearing a \u2018Quirkless\u2019 child. Her parents tight smiles and clenched fists. </i></p><p><i>She ignored the malicious giggles in her school halls. The teachers glancing at her once before looking away. The obvious boundary between her and everyone else.</i></p><p><i>She welcomed the warm hugs, the cheerful laughter, the kind words inside her home. She was safe and sound inside and that was enough.</i></p><p>Then in the beginning of her third year of middle school, Life threw a curveball on her way.</p><p>In the early morning of a cheerful spring day, where the sakura petals floated down gently, Saki had picked up a glass of milk and sipped on it as she turned on the news. </p><p>What greeted her was the amazing video of a blonde being strangled by sludge and a green haired boy running to save him.</p><p>She immediately choked and spat out her milk.</p><p>Saki was aware of what era she was in. While she was unclear of where in the timeline she stood she knew she was in the era before All Might\u2019s retirement. She still saw All Might on the news after all. She had hoped that she was a decade before the plot started. Unfortunately, she was not that lucky and with the news showcasing the Protagonist and his Rival she was given a clear indication of when exactly she was in the Timeline.</p><p>So it was with vengeance that she decidedly tried to avoid any interaction of the plot.</p><p>She immediately threw out any high school application that had hero courses and settled for an average school that was within walking distance of her home. She vigilantly followed the news and avoided areas where hero and villain fights occurred with more effort than before.</p><p>Cowardly? Perhaps. But Saki was well aware of her position in this society. She had no ability, no backing and was not prepared mentally or physically to face any sort of danger and deal with the consequences.</p><p>People\u2019s lives were at stake, this was a reality she lived in for more than a decade now. This was no fantasy to play Hero and become a Mary Sue and save the day. One wrong step and the whole structure would crumble like a stack of cards. </p><p>So she refused to be involved and destroy the carefully scripted events that is Fate and started High school in an average non-hero school that had no relation to U.A. at all.</p><p>That did not mean that she would completely ignore the turn of events. The petite girl obsessively kept up with the news and took stock of the report of the USJ incident. It was the first time she saw Class A outside of pen and paper but that brief debut of heroes in training came and went.</p><p>She properly saw the class during the airing of the UA Sports festival and watching the event on the news made Saki breath heavily.</p><p><i>They are so young. So young and the world is going to throw them the gauntlet.</i></p><p><i>They don\u2019t deserve any of that.</i></p><p>The revelation made Saki\u2019s stomach turn and she had to resist the urge to grab the remote and close the tv. She refused to hide under her sheets as she stood riveted to the screen.</p><p>Her nails dug into the palm of her hands as she took it in. </p><p>Shinsou\u2019s slouched posture straightening as he took his first step to his dream. Uraraka, her body littered with bruises, burning determination in her gaze as she took her stand against Bakugo. Midoriya, as he broke finger after finger to save Todoroki.</p><p>At the end of it all Saki was trembling. Her mother, her kind and gentle mother glanced at her state and that night she was handed her favorite food to chew on.</p><p>That night as Saki laid under the covers, fingers clutching the fabric of her old and worn plushy, she contemplated the future. She was in the same year as the kids who would one day bear the future of Japan on their shoulders and she trembled.</p><p>But Life does not wait for one person and the world moves on.</p><p>Time moved on, she views the Hero Killer on the news and huffed in amusement at the white lie provided of the incident. The disgruntled look of the Pro Hero Endeavor as he reported the incident on the news was something she would remember for a while. She also contemplated the viral video that was floating on the web for a while. The blurry but unmistakable figure of Stain who declared his intent against the UA kids and heroes.</p><p>The clock was ticking and Saki was so very aware of the impending end of an era. The end of All Might\u2019s days as a hero.</p><p>Soon enough, the chirping of the crickets announced the arrival of summer and alongside the heat waves was the rising dread of what is to come.</p><p>It was with those emotions that Life decided to stop giving Saki the illusion that she had a choice anymore and threw her head first into the chaos.</p><p>On a night like any other, where the streets were filled with buzz and life, Saki had been given an errand from her parents and was walking on the crowded streets. Opening the news on her phone, she froze as she saw the iconic news conference being aired. </p><p><b><i>Murphy\u2019s Law: When things can go wrong, it will go wrong.</i></b></p><p>There was no warning.</p><p>A loud sound, the cacophony of screams.</p><p>The concrete building, large enough to dwarf her overshadowed her form.</p><p><i>nononoNONONONO</i><b><i>NONONO!</i></b></p><p><i>Idon\u2019twANTTODIEAG</i><b><i>A-</i></b></p><p><b><i>\u2026</i></b></p><p><b><i>\u2026</i></b></p><p><b><i>\u2026</i></b></p><p><b><i>When a pebble is dropped, it needs not to take any action.

I was no miracle.</b></p><p><b>I was a mistake in the making with no way out of this mess.</b></p><blockquote><p>When you die, you expect that to be the end.</p><p>No restart.</p><p>No continue.</p><p>Just\u2026 The End.</p><p>Realistically speaking, there is no magic or ritual or some fantastical reason to give one person out of the hundreds and thousands of people who desperately desire that second chance that slim possibility.</p><p>God?</p><p>Why would any heavenly (or demonic) being bother with an average joe?</p><p>A continue button?</p><p>Life is not a game so no such thing.</p><p>Some cosmic change in the universe?</p><p>It\u2019s possible but what are the chances. Way too astronomical to be true.</p><p>So when her life ended oh so abruptly, Saki thought that was it.</p><p>But like almost every cliche come to life, she woke up again in a new world with that \u2018amazing\u2019 second chance.</p><p>Normally, one would expect that reincarnated person to rejoice. They got another go at life, what was there to complain about? To do so would mean that they are a spoiled brat who did not understand what god given opportunity they were given.</p><p>But Saki understood something very intimately. It was that she was happy, content and fulfilled in her past life. She did not need to have all that ripped away from her and told to restart in this new reality.</p><p>Her stern but loving family?</p><p>They were now just whips in smoke that she could no longer grasp in her hand.</p><p>Her many hours put into her hard earned degree? </p><p>Falling through her fingers like sand as her memories began to blur.</p><p>Her culture and identity?</p><p>It was gone in the abyss and now she had been blanked out like a white canvas for others to fulfill.</p><p>Safe to say, Saki hated her new beginning with a vengeance that she did not think she had the capacity for.</p><p>For many weeks, her new parents blustered around and worried frantically as their newborn child constantly screamed and wailed as she rejected her new reality. Unknown to them that their child mourned for the loss of an entire world she would never return to.</p><p>But the world never wants for the sake of one person, so life moved on. Saki quietly let go of her fading past and with trembling chubby fingers grasped on to her new world.</p><p>Saki upon reconciling with her new life, reflected upon her actions the past few weeks and had flushed red upon realizing how troubled her new parents were with her constant wailing and had resolved herself to be a good child for them. Partly out of guilt, the chestnut haired child mused, as her new mother combed through her slowly growing locks.</p><p><i>I stole the life of the child you should have had. Its the least I should do.</i></p><p>So the girl tried to love and fell to love. She adored her kind and comforting new family and life slowly fell into place for the old soul. Saki adapted and watched as three seasons passed.</p><p>It was on a bright spring day that Life decided to kick the girl into the curb again.</p><p>Sitting in front of the television and absentmindedly watching the children\u2019s anime playing across the scene, Saki squished the soft plush bunny between her fingers as she tried to practice her finger\u2019s coordination. Listening to the anime, the girl scrunched her nose as she tried to make sense of the Kanji being used.</p><p>The broken sound of ceramic and yelp of pain broke the child out of her musing.</p><p>\u201cMama?!\u201d</p><p>Scrambling to her feet, the toddler stumbled over her two feet to reach the source of the noise and when she reached the kitchen her jaw dropped. The floor was littered with jagged porcelain and her mothers fingers cut and bleeding profusely.</p><p>\u201cAra? Saki if you come closer you will get hurt.\u201d Saki\u2019s mom had a serene smile as she clutched her fingers close to her chest. At the time, Saki faced pinched at how air-headed her mother had to be to wave off what obviously had to be a painful injury.</p><p>\u201cBut!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo buts! besides this is nothing.\u201d</p><p>The older woman had gently admonished the child but as she her cild\u2019s distress she giggled before she held out her hands and to the toddler\u2019s astonishment the wounds slowly but surely <i>closed up on their own</i>.</p><p><i>\u2026 I\u2019m pretty sure wounds don\u2019t heal that quickly.</i></p><p>Saki\u2019s head tilted to the side and she mimed a fish as she tried to make sense of the phenomenon that she just witnessed. Long enough for her father who had come down from the second floor to see what had caused the ruckus and chuckle at his child\u2019s reaction.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s shocked you so much my little blossom?\u201d Saki\u2019s father had a wry grin on his lips as he bundled her up in his warm arms.</p><p>\u201cI was showing her my Quirk. I think this is the first time she has ever seen it Dear.\u201d </p><p><i>A sense of foreboding, a jogged memory from her fogged past.</i></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because there hasn\u2019t been a need for her to see your Quirk Honey.\u201d</p><p><i>Recognition from a past long gone. Children in a school gifted with the supernatural.</i></p><p>\u201cTrue, minor regeneration isn\u2019t something I can show so easily. But anyway, Dear could you please?\u201d</p><p><i>A forest ablaze in blue flames. Children collapsed on the floor as a pink gas embraced their forms. Their peers bleeding as they braced themselves against the darkness.</i></p><p>\u201cOf course Honey!\u201d</p><p>The porcelain pieces started to float and was lifted gently before displaced into the trash. The child paling as the pieces in her memory clicked into place. She vaguely remembered her Mom giggling as she poked my cheek to snap me out of my shock.</p><p><i>Two boys anxiously watching the large Television screen. The Symbol of Peace, weary and injured but standing tall. Fulfilled in his duty and pointing to the camera.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re next.\u201d</i></p><p>The evidence was standing in from of her and yet the child could only remember her dropping stomach as she pieced together where she was reborn into. A world only thought to be fiction but was now her reality.</p><p><i>Oh god i\u2019m in a world where the supernatural is the absolute normal.</i></p><p>Unknown to her parents, Saki panicked at the revelation but her denial at where she was dropped into abated after she considered the facts for a while. </p><p>Her parents had very minor quirks, her mother had a minor regeneration quirk while her father had a minor telekinesis quirk. Given that, it was likely that I would manifest a minor version of either of their quirks or a minor combined version of their quirk.</p><p>Which meant that Saki would not be pressured to become a Hero.</p><p>At that, Saki sighed in relief. </p><p>She did not want society to force her to risk her life for others when she did not have the mental or physical strength to do so. The vague reminder of her death made Saki shiver uncontrollably and she was glad she did not have to face that again for as long as possible.</p><p>The tiny girl was content to be the norm in the world of the extraordinary.</p><p>But Life does not cater to the whims of a single person, and once again threw her to the wolves.</p><p>Come her fourth birthday, and Saki was slow to show any signs of a quirk. When she fell and bruised her arms, they healed at a normal rate. When Saki focused on an object, it did not levitate.</p><p>Nothing out of the ordinary changed.</p><p>As expected, despite how lighthearted her parents usually are, they were quite worried to realize how late their child\u2019s quirk was coming in. So hand in hand, Saki was taken to the hospital for a check up.</p><p>Saki learned two things that day.</p><p>She did not have double joint, so she did have a quirk.</p><p>Just\u2026 not quite a visible one.</p><p>At first, the doctors considered that she might have a dormant quirk that required certain stimulation to activate. So she went through testing and physical activities to try to activate the quirk. </p><p>However, the tests came out negative so it was assumed that Saki did not have a dormant quirk but instead an invisible quirk.</p><p>An invisible quirk was as its name implied, a passive quirk that is constantly active but is so minor that it basically doesn\u2019t seem to be visible.</p><p>So after the results were presented and her parents reassured, her parents brought her back home. Saki was still loved and cared for the same as before. Her home life remained the warm heaven that it was.</p><p>But of course, things never go that smoothly outside her haven.</p><p>Returning to kindergarten with no quirk to show off quickly made the tiny girl the class pariah. The kids assumed if she could not show a quirk meant that she was quirkless and suddenly she was not \u2018good enough\u2019 to the everyone. Saki had not changed, and in a world where you had to show off some ability and have nothing to show for, you were punished for it in the form of isolation and bullying.</p><p><i>Children were innocent. They had no concept of what was right and what was wrong. They only acted according to what other said was \u2018right\u2019. The product of a society molding them to their image. </i></p><p><i>It was childlike. It was pure. It was cruel.</i></p><p>The Manga did not elaborate on how bad this quirk obsessed society could be to the quirkless. Often, Saki was tugged in two extremes, either bullied for being \u2018useless\u2019 or treated with the kid gloves for being too \u2018fragile\u2019.</p><p>In the quiet night and hidden underneath the covers, Saki had considered how amazing Midoriya was. To endure when society deemed his dream just a dream. To still reach for what was considered the impossible.</p><p>Midoriya had determination in spades. And Saki had none in contrast.</p><p>However, life was not \u2018bad\u2019. While Saki could not escape the stigma that was being considered \u2018quirkless\u2019 she could avoid some of the problems that came her way.</p><p>She never responded to taunts-the sharp barbs thrown her way to bring her down for the short enjoyment of the few-and bullies eventually considered a worthless \u2018target\u2019 and soon left her alone. Her belongings safe from the grubby hands of children who did not understand enough.</p><p>No one bothered her after a while, but at the same time she had no one outside her family.</p><p>Her family worried, her kind parents fretting in the night under the darkness. They whispered their fear of their sole child left with no companions. All the while the old soul hid behind the door and her gaze was trained to the floor before slowly walking back to her room.</p><p>Saki dealt with things the best way she could. It helped that as an introvert she became tired of social interaction quickly and retired to herself. In a sense, Saki was free of responsibility and pressure. Free of society who judged for Quirk and not the person behind it.</p><p>Free to choose whatever path may walk.</p><p>Looking at the bright side, Saki was glad she was reborn in this world. If she had been reborn in Naruto or One Piece, her uselessness was a dead end in the making. So she dealt with life and moved on.</p><p><i>She ignored the pitiful looks of their neighbors. The awful whispers of condolences to her parents for bearing a \u2018Quirkless\u2019 child. Her parents tight smiles and clenched fists. </i></p><p><i>She ignored the malicious giggles in her school halls. The teachers glancing at her once before looking away. The obvious boundary between her and everyone else.</i></p><p><i>She welcomed the warm hugs, the cheerful laughter, the kind words inside her home. She was safe and sound inside and that was enough.</i></p><p>Then in the beginning of her third year of middle school, Life threw a curveball on her way.</p><p>In the early morning of a cheerful spring day, where the sakura petals floated down gently, Saki had picked up a glass of milk and sipped on it as she turned on the news. </p><p>What greeted her was the amazing video of a blonde being strangled by sludge and a green haired boy running to save him.</p><p>She immediately choked and spat out her milk.</p><p>Saki was aware of what era she was in. While she was unclear of where in the timeline she stood she knew she was in the era before All Might\u2019s retirement. She still saw All Might on the news after all. She had hoped that she was a decade before the plot started. Unfortunately, she was not that lucky and with the news showcasing the Protagonist and his Rival she was given a clear indication of when exactly she was in the Timeline.</p><p>So it was with vengeance that she decidedly tried to avoid any interaction of the plot.</p><p>She immediately threw out any high school application that had hero courses and settled for an average school that was within walking distance of her home. She vigilantly followed the news and avoided areas where hero and villain fights occurred with more effort than before.</p><p>Cowardly? Perhaps. But Saki was well aware of her position in this society. She had no ability, no backing and was not prepared mentally or physically to face any sort of danger and deal with the consequences.</p><p>People\u2019s lives were at stake, this was a reality she lived in for more than a decade now. This was no fantasy to play Hero and become a Mary Sue and save the day. One wrong step and the whole structure would crumble like a stack of cards. </p><p>So she refused to be involved and destroy the carefully scripted events that is Fate and started High school in an average non-hero school that had no relation to U.A. at all.</p><p>That did not mean that she would completely ignore the turn of events. The petite girl obsessively kept up with the news and took stock of the report of the USJ incident. It was the first time she saw Class A outside of pen and paper but that brief debut of heroes in training came and went.</p><p>She properly saw the class during the airing of the UA Sports festival and watching the event on the news made Saki breath heavily.</p><p><i>They are so young. So young and the world is going to throw them the gauntlet.</i></p><p><i>They don\u2019t deserve any of that.</i></p><p>The revelation made Saki\u2019s stomach turn and she had to resist the urge to grab the remote and close the tv. She refused to hide under her sheets as she stood riveted to the screen.</p><p>Her nails dug into the palm of her hands as she took it in. </p><p>Shinsou\u2019s slouched posture straightening as he took his first step to his dream. Uraraka, her body littered with bruises, burning determination in her gaze as she took her stand against Bakugo. Midoriya, as he broke finger after finger to save Todoroki.</p><p>At the end of it all Saki was trembling. Her mother, her kind and gentle mother glanced at her state and that night she was handed her favorite food to chew on.</p><p>That night as Saki laid under the covers, fingers clutching the fabric of her old and worn plushy, she contemplated the future. She was in the same year as the kids who would one day bear the future of Japan on their shoulders and she trembled.</p><p>But Life does not wait for one person and the world moves on.</p><p>Time moved on, she views the Hero Killer on the news and huffed in amusement at the white lie provided of the incident.

A world only thought to be fiction but was now her reality.</p><p><i>Oh god i&rsquo;m in a world where the supernatural is the absolute normal.</i></p><p>Unknown to her parents, Saki panicked at the revelation but her denial at where she was dropped into abated after she considered the facts for a while. </p><p>Her parents had very minor quirks, her mother had a minor regeneration quirk while her father had a minor telekinesis quirk. Given that, it was likely that I would manifest a minor version of either of their quirks or a minor combined version of their quirk.</p><p>Which meant that Saki would not be pressured to become a Hero.</p><p>At that, Saki sighed in relief. </p><p>She did not want society to force her to risk her life for others when she did not have the mental or physical strength to do so. The vague reminder of her death made Saki shiver uncontrollably and she was glad she did not have to face that again for as long as possible.</p><p>The tiny girl was content to be the norm in the world of the extraordinary.</p><p>But Life does not cater to the whims of a single person, and once again threw her to the wolves.</p><p>Come her fourth birthday, and Saki was slow to show any signs of a quirk. When she fell and bruised her arms, they healed at a normal rate. When Saki focused on an object, it did not levitate.</p><p>Nothing out of the ordinary changed.</p><p>As expected, despite how lighthearted her parents usually are, they were quite worried to realize how late their child&rsquo;s quirk was coming in. So hand in hand, Saki was taken to the hospital for a check up.</p><p>Saki learned two things that day.</p><p>She did not have double joint, so she did have a quirk.</p><p>Just&hellip; not quite a visible one.</p><p>At first, the doctors considered that she might have a dormant quirk that required certain stimulation to activate. So she went through testing and physical activities to try to activate the quirk. </p><p>However, the tests came out negative so it was assumed that Saki did not have a dormant quirk but instead an invisible quirk.</p><p>An invisible quirk was as its name implied, a passive quirk that is constantly active but is so minor that it basically doesn&rsquo;t seem to be visible.</p><p>So after the results were presented and her parents reassured, her parents brought her back home. Saki was still loved and cared for the same as before. Her home life remained the warm heaven that it was.</p><p>But of course, things never go that smoothly outside her haven.</p><p>Returning to kindergarten with no quirk to show off quickly made the tiny girl the class pariah. The kids assumed if she could not show a quirk meant that she was quirkless and suddenly she was not &lsquo;good enough&rsquo; to the everyone. Saki had not changed, and in a world where you had to show off some ability and have nothing to show for, you were punished for it in the form of isolation and bullying.</p><p><i>Children were innocent. They had no concept of what was right and what was wrong. They only acted according to what other said was &lsquo;right&rsquo;. The product of a society molding them to their image. </i></p><p><i>It was childlike. It was pure. It was cruel.</i></p><p>The Manga did not elaborate on how bad this quirk obsessed society could be to the quirkless. Often, Saki was tugged in two extremes, either bullied for being &lsquo;useless&rsquo; or treated with the kid gloves for being too &lsquo;fragile&rsquo;.</p><p>In the quiet night and hidden underneath the covers, Saki had considered how amazing Midoriya was. To endure when society deemed his dream just a dream. To still reach for what was considered the impossible.</p><p>Midoriya had determination in spades. And Saki had none in contrast.</p><p>However, life was not &lsquo;bad&rsquo;. While Saki could not escape the stigma that was being considered &lsquo;quirkless&rsquo; she could avoid some of the problems that came her way.</p><p>She never responded to taunts-the sharp barbs thrown her way to bring her down for the short enjoyment of the few-and bullies eventually considered a worthless &lsquo;target&rsquo; and soon left her alone. Her belongings safe from the grubby hands of children who did not understand enough.</p><p>No one bothered her after a while, but at the same time she had no one outside her family.</p><p>Her family worried, her kind parents fretting in the night under the darkness. They whispered their fear of their sole child left with no companions. All the while the old soul hid behind the door and her gaze was trained to the floor before slowly walking back to her room.</p><p>Saki dealt with things the best way she could. It helped that as an introvert she became tired of social interaction quickly and retired to herself. In a sense, Saki was free of responsibility and pressure. Free of society who judged for Quirk and not the person behind it.</p><p>Free to choose whatever path may walk.</p><p>Looking at the bright side, Saki was glad she was reborn in this world. If she had been reborn in Naruto or One Piece, her uselessness was a dead end in the making. So she dealt with life and moved on.</p><p><i>She ignored the pitiful looks of their neighbors. The awful whispers of condolences to her parents for bearing a &lsquo;Quirkless&rsquo; child. Her parents tight smiles and clenched fists. </i></p><p><i>She ignored the malicious giggles in her school halls. The teachers glancing at her once before looking away. The obvious boundary between her and everyone else.</i></p><p><i>She welcomed the warm hugs, the cheerful laughter, the kind words inside her home. She was safe and sound inside and that was enough.</i></p><p>Then in the beginning of her third year of middle school, Life threw a curveball on her way.</p><p>In the early morning of a cheerful spring day, where the sakura petals floated down gently, Saki had picked up a glass of milk and sipped on it as she turned on the news. </p><p>What greeted her was the amazing video of a blonde being strangled by sludge and a green haired boy running to save him.</p><p>She immediately choked and spat out her milk.</p><p>Saki was aware of what era she was in. While she was unclear of where in the timeline she stood she knew she was in the era before All Might&rsquo;s retirement. She still saw All Might on the news after all. She had hoped that she was a decade before the plot started. Unfortunately, she was not that lucky and with the news showcasing the Protagonist and his Rival she was given a clear indication of when exactly she was in the Timeline.</p><p>So it was with vengeance that she decidedly tried to avoid any interaction of the plot.</p><p>She immediately threw out any high school application that had hero courses and settled for an average school that was within walking distance of her home. She vigilantly followed the news and avoided areas where hero and villain fights occurred with more effort than before.</p><p>Cowardly? Perhaps. But Saki was well aware of her position in this society. She had no ability, no backing and was not prepared mentally or physically to face any sort of danger and deal with the consequences.</p><p>People&rsquo;s lives were at stake, this was a reality she lived in for more than a decade now. This was no fantasy to play Hero and become a Mary Sue and save the day. One wrong step and the whole structure would crumble like a stack of cards. </p><p>So she refused to be involved and destroy the carefully scripted events that is Fate and started High school in an average non-hero school that had no relation to U.A. at all.</p><p>That did not mean that she would completely ignore the turn of events. The petite girl obsessively kept up with the news and took stock of the report of the USJ incident. It was the first time she saw Class A outside of pen and paper but that brief debut of heroes in training came and went.</p><p>She properly saw the class during the airing of the UA Sports festival and watching the event on the news made Saki breath heavily.</p><p><i>They are so young. So young and the world is going to throw them the gauntlet.</i></p><p><i>They don&rsquo;t deserve any of that.</i></p><p>The revelation made Saki&rsquo;s stomach turn and she had to resist the urge to grab the remote and close the tv. She refused to hide under her sheets as she stood riveted to the screen.</p><p>Her nails dug into the palm of her hands as she took it in. </p><p>Shinsou&rsquo;s slouched posture straightening as he took his first step to his dream. Uraraka, her body littered with bruises, burning determination in her gaze as she took her stand against Bakugo. Midoriya, as he broke finger after finger to save Todoroki.</p><p>At the end of it all Saki was trembling. Her mother, her kind and gentle mother glanced at her state and that night she was handed her favorite food to chew on.</p><p>That night as Saki laid under the covers, fingers clutching the fabric of her old and worn plushy, she contemplated the future. She was in the same year as the kids who would one day bear the future of Japan on their shoulders and she trembled.</p><p>But Life does not wait for one person and the world moves on.</p><p>Time moved on, she views the Hero Killer on the news and huffed in amusement at the white lie provided of the incident. The disgruntled look of the Pro Hero Endeavor as he reported the incident on the news was something she would remember for a while. She also contemplated the viral video that was floating on the web for a while. The blurry but unmistakable figure of Stain who declared his intent against the UA kids and heroes.</p><p>The clock was ticking and Saki was so very aware of the impending end of an era. The end of All Might&rsquo;s days as a hero.</p><p>Soon enough, the chirping of the crickets announced the arrival of summer and alongside the heat waves was the rising dread of what is to come.</p><p>It was with those emotions that Life decided to stop giving Saki the illusion that she had a choice anymore and threw her head first into the chaos.</p><p>On a night like any other, where the streets were filled with buzz and life, Saki had been given an errand from her parents and was walking on the crowded streets. Opening the news on her phone, she froze as she saw the iconic news conference being aired. </p><p><b><i>Murphy&rsquo;s Law: When things can go wrong, it will go wrong.</i></b></p><p>There was no warning.</p><p>A loud sound, the cacophony of screams.</p><p>The concrete building, large enough to dwarf her overshadowed her form.</p><p><i>nononoNONONONO</i><b><i>NONONO!</i></b></p><p><i>Idon&rsquo;twANTTODIEAG</i><b><i>A-</i></b></p><p><b><i>&hellip;</i></b></p><p><b><i>&hellip;</i></b></p><p><b><i>&hellip;</i></b></p><p><b><i>When a pebble is dropped, it needs not to take any action.
