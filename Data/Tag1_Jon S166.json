He had tan skin that matched yours and his eyes were a light blue.</p><p>\u201cI like your pin.\u201d You said through gritted teeth, holding Lucia who seemed to be unhappy with everything that was going on. She hadn\u2019t slept in the night, instead she was fussy the entire time. She hadn\u2019t taken a nap in hours. Even when she had been fed she seemed unhappy.</p><p>\u201cOh, it&rsquo;s a broach. Although&hellip; I suppose they\u2019re the same thing.\u201d</p><p>You looked up at him from your daughter and shook your head. \u201cYou can\u2019t claim her. She looks nothing like you.\u201d You stated painfully pushing the dark hair off of her forehead as she seemed to grimace in pain.</p><p>\u201cNo. But I do know she can\u2019t live as a bastard her entire life-\u201c</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not a bastard!\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>She was, you knew she was. You hated to admit it. You had so often associated bastards with being the children of the women in brothels who didn\u2019t love the fathers of their children. Until you met Jon, you knew his mother couldn\u2019t have been some woman in a brothel. He had something about him that gave the feeling that both sides of his family were highborn. </p><p>Your daughter was born out of the last night you ever spoke to Jon. She was a product of love that you didn\u2019t know how to explain. You\u2019d loved Jon so much you didn\u2019t have words. Often times to awestruck that he\u2019d loved you for you to even be able to comprehend anything else going on around you.</p><p>Loras looked at you and sighed. What was he getting himself into? He was marrying you. A woman who\u2019d been given life by Cersei Lannister. Cersei Lannister who was nothing but a lion. Which had rubbed off on you.</p><p>\u201cLet me claim her. She will be Lucia of house Tyrell, first of her name. She will be wardeness of the south and lady of high garden one day. She\u2019ll wear green and blue silk dresses, he hair curled and done up like a southerner. This is the best option for both of us.\u201d</p><p>You looked ahead at the flowers that surrounded you. How could this be the best option. Of course you&rsquo;d heard the rumors that Loras didn\u2019t like women. It was a well known rumor. But him claiming Lucia as his heir made you upset.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><hr><p><br/></p><p>\u201cSansa\u2019s to marry my uncle! My mother and grandfather are the most controlling people I have ever met!\u201d</p><p>Miza sighed as she bounced Lucia who had begun to cry a few minutes ago.</p><p>\u201cPrincess, I\u2019m sure that they think this is for the best.\u201d She tried to reason.</p><p>You were throwing dresses into your trunk, however many you could. The purple ones, the yellow ones, you began to throw in Lucia\u2019s outfits that Miza and you had made together. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be Lady Y/N of house Tyrell! I don\u2019t want Luci to be Lucia of house Tyrell!\u201d You complained.</p><p>The wedding was to take place in High Garden. No one you knew would be there, everyone was his family. Yours had to stay here. Sansa was to stay here and if Loras didn\u2019t claim Lucia as his own to Joffrey today, she would also have to stay here.</p><p>Hearing a knock at the door you groaned and stomped over to the door opening it. Those damn hinges squeaking louder than a fork against a dinner plate.</p><p>When Loras came into view he had a smile. \u201cPrincess Y/N. May I come in?\u201d </p><p>You moved aside for him to walk in, but closed the door quick enough to keep the guards out. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d You asked impatiently. The crying of your daughter putting you on edge.</p><p>He held up a letter and opened it and began to read aloud</p><p>\u201cI, King Joffrey Baratheon, first of his name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, and Protector of the realm, hereby name Lucia Storm, Lucia Tyrell, from this day until her last day.\u201d</p><p>He looked at you to the child in Miza\u2019s arms who was still crying. </p><p>\u201cSo. She\u2019s your child now.\u201d You stated walking over to Miza and taking Lucia from her. </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the heir to High Garden when I die.\u201d</p><p>Scoffing you shook your head resting her on your hip and held eye contact with him. \u201cYou need a son to carry on your family name. She\u2019ll one day marry some high lord you decided to sell her off to in exchange for something of lesser value than herself, and she\u2019ll become Lucia something of another land.\u201d</p><p>He placed the letter on your bed and grabbed one of the dresses you had thrown onto the bed in an attempt to get it into the trunk. He walked over to the opened side of the trunk and folded it neatly before placing it inside the box.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s your daughter. You gave her something no one else could have. You gave her life. Carried her inside of yourself for nine months no matter how wrong someone would think it was. If anyone chooses who she marries, it will be you.\u201d He said before walking over to you and gently taking the crying little girl into his own arms.<br/></p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not mine. We both know that very well. But she holds my name now. So I will call her my daughter. I will raise her as my own as long as you allow me. I will never betray your trust.\u201d</p><p>You looked as Lucia fussed in his arms as well and rested her head on his shoulder. This may be the only way you could keep Joffrey from hurting her.

She looks nothing like you.&rdquo; You stated painfully pushing the dark hair off of her forehead as she seemed to grimace in pain.</p><p>&ldquo;No. But I do know she can&rsquo;t live as a bastard her entire life-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not a bastard!&rdquo;</p><p>She was, you knew she was. You hated to admit it. You had so often associated bastards with being the children of the women in brothels who didn&rsquo;t love the fathers of their children. Until you met Jon, you knew his mother couldn&rsquo;t have been some woman in a brothel. He had something about him that gave the feeling that both sides of his family were highborn. </p><p>Your daughter was born out of the last night you ever spoke to Jon. She was a product of love that you didn&rsquo;t know how to explain. You&rsquo;d loved Jon so much you didn&rsquo;t have words. Often times to awestruck that he&rsquo;d loved you for you to even be able to comprehend anything else going on around you.</p><p>Loras looked at you and sighed. What was he getting himself into? He was marrying you. A woman who&rsquo;d been given life by Cersei Lannister. Cersei Lannister who was nothing but a lion. Which had rubbed off on you.</p><p>&ldquo;Let me claim her. She will be Lucia of house Tyrell, first of her name. She will be wardeness of the south and lady of high garden one day. She&rsquo;ll wear green and blue silk dresses, he hair curled and done up like a southerner. This is the best option for both of us.&rdquo;</p><p>You looked ahead at the flowers that surrounded you. How could this be the best option. Of course you&rsquo;d heard the rumors that Loras didn&rsquo;t like women. It was a well known rumor. But him claiming Lucia as his heir made you upset.</p><p>&ldquo;Fine.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Sansa&rsquo;s to marry my uncle! My mother and grandfather are the most controlling people I have ever met!&rdquo;</p><p>Miza sighed as she bounced Lucia who had begun to cry a few minutes ago.</p><p>&ldquo;Princess, I&rsquo;m sure that they think this is for the best.&rdquo; She tried to reason.</p><p>You were throwing dresses into your trunk, however many you could. The purple ones, the yellow ones, you began to throw in Lucia&rsquo;s outfits that Miza and you had made together. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be Lady Y/N of house Tyrell! I don&rsquo;t want Luci to be Lucia of house Tyrell!&rdquo; You complained.</p><p>The wedding was to take place in High Garden. No one you knew would be there, everyone was his family. Yours had to stay here. Sansa was to stay here and if Loras didn&rsquo;t claim Lucia as his own to Joffrey today, she would also have to stay here.</p><p>Hearing a knock at the door you groaned and stomped over to the door opening it. Those damn hinges squeaking louder than a fork against a dinner plate.</p><p>When Loras came into view he had a smile. &ldquo;Princess Y/N. May I come in?&rdquo; </p><p>You moved aside for him to walk in, but closed the door quick enough to keep the guards out. &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; You asked impatiently. The crying of your daughter putting you on edge.</p><p>He held up a letter and opened it and began to read aloud</p><p>&ldquo;I, King Joffrey Baratheon, first of his name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, and Protector of the realm, hereby name Lucia Storm, Lucia Tyrell, from this day until her last day.&rdquo;</p><p>He looked at you to the child in Miza&rsquo;s arms who was still crying. </p><p>&ldquo;So. She&rsquo;s your child now.&rdquo; You stated walking over to Miza and taking Lucia from her. </p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s the heir to High Garden when I die.&rdquo;</p><p>Scoffing you shook your head resting her on your hip and held eye contact with him. &ldquo;You need a son to carry on your family name. She&rsquo;ll one day marry some high lord you decided to sell her off to in exchange for something of lesser value than herself, and she&rsquo;ll become Lucia something of another land.&rdquo;</p><p>He placed the letter on your bed and grabbed one of the dresses you had thrown onto the bed in an attempt to get it into the trunk. He walked over to the opened side of the trunk and folded it neatly before placing it inside the box.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s your daughter. You gave her something no one else could have. You gave her life. Carried her inside of yourself for nine months no matter how wrong someone would think it was. If anyone chooses who she marries, it will be you.&rdquo; He said before walking over to you and gently taking the crying little girl into his own arms.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not mine. We both know that very well. But she holds my name now. So I will call her my daughter. I will raise her as my own as long as you allow me. I will never betray your trust.&rdquo;</p><p>You looked as Lucia fussed in his arms as well and rested her head on his shoulder. This may be the only way you could keep Joffrey from hurting her. From using that damn crossbow on her. </p><p>&ldquo;You may do whatever you would like with your life, even in our marriage. But if you ever break your promise about my daughter. I will kill you and I will burn your body on a steak in front of your family to watch. As a lesson that no one hurts my baby girl.&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded and looked at Lucia &ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s a good thing I&rsquo;ll never hurt her.&rdquo; He responded handing her back to you and heading for the door grabbing the handle to walk out. </p><p>&ldquo;And Loras!.&rdquo; You said loudly.</p><p>He stopped dead in his tracks and looked at you as you held the fussy baby. </p><p>&ldquo;Remember. I will burn you if you hurt her.&ldquo;</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@disneyprincessbuffyannesummers</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2Brpm_sNm4JG48MCv5LWYw\" target=\"_blank\">@siennarothenburg</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzBlNV0PDM4SXm6Ym1PSJAw\" target=\"_blank\">@cevanstann</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m57PumL3XTHKMbhaLBCDM6Q\" target=\"_blank\">@nighthood13</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrQghx2HTRQWATopqUw0s2w\" target=\"_blank\">@qhbr2013</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mA_-qHoQbaPG0d8C94bexmA\" target=\"_blank\">@celestial-melancholy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/majsdnQ_JnelNmwA-W4FunA\" target=\"_blank\">@boredbrit</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAeRnp4q0NBV8t7q1b6qpVw\" target=\"_blank\">@falling-stars-never-cry</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ms0BdTYfmHt42bvH5n-1KJw\" target=\"_blank\">@vxidnik</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mY2iDPZFAYSCyrTHvpHNOmQ\" target=\"_blank\">@awkwxrdmarauders</a> @<a href=\"https://strangerthingsholland.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Strangerthingsholland</a></p></p>",
