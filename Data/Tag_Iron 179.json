I don\u2019t want to repeat that. he still doesn\u2019t shut up about me waking him up at 2 in the morning.\u201d</p><p>it was true, tony groused about it every time peter nagged him about his lack of sleep - (\u201clast time I tried to get a good night of sleep you woke me up for a scratch, kid.\u201d)</p><p>peter knew tony was just deflecting so peter wouldn\u2019t mention his insomnia anymore. if he knew peter was actually injured he would definitely insist peter report to him, but peter still felt bad. </p><p>karen sounded exasperated, \u201cyou know he\u2019d want you to report this. my scans are telling me that your cut has a high probability of getting infected.\u201d</p><p>peter winced, that was exactly what he was afraid of - the knife that had cut him had been rusty. still, he reflected, checking the shallow wound, it didn\u2019t look bad, and it definitely didn\u2019t look worth calling mr. stark about.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he said with finality, pulling off his mask before karen could retort. he felt kind of bad about it but he had an ap chem midterm to prepare for and making a big deal out of the injury would cut down on his study time. he would just bandage it before bed.</p><p>after about an hour peter was reasonably confident in his chemistry knowledge, and so he put away his books and prepared for bed, slipping into the bathroom to bandage the cut.</p><p>he shouldn\u2019t have gotten it at all but he\u2019d been being careless during a mugging. he\u2019d totally forgot to check the man for other weapons after disarming him of his gun and webbing him up. luckily his spider sense had whirled with warning and allowed him time to dodge the knife attack, preventing anything life threatening, but it had still grazed him.</p><p>he checked the cut as he put on the bandage - it was just a shallow flesh wound, cut along his side but the skin around it looked red and inflamed, and intense heat seemed to radiate from it.</p><p>peter dismissed it uneasily, reasoning that if there was really something wrong his spidey sense would tell him.</p><p>still, he felt weirdly heavy and tired as he tunneled under the covers and his cut pulsed painfully. he drifted off into an uncomfortable sleep, pestered by nightmares of fire curling up his side.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>he woke up late, groggy and strangely exhausted despite his relatively long night of sleep. his joints ached, and when he stood his whole body protested, his muscles tight and sore.</p><p>he almost collapsed back into bed before remembering his chemistry midterm. he glanced at his watch - he was already 10 minutes late. crap.</p><p>he threw on pants and a midtown sweater and practically tumbled out the door, throwing a hasty good bye to may as he went. he\u2019d meant to check the bandage in the morning but in his rush he forgot.</p><p>he ran practically the whole way to school and, despite his abilities, he was sweaty and out of breath when he finally arrived. the bell rang just as he collapsed into the desk beside ned, and his teacher gave him an unimpressed look.</p><p>\u201cnice of you to join us mr. parker.\u201d</p><p>peter just managed a weak smile back.</p><p>\u201cdude, what\u2019s up with you?\u201d ned asked in a whisper, appraising his disheveled look and flushed cheeks as their teacher went over the instructions for the test.</p><p>\u201cI just woke up late and had to run to make it here,\u201d peter panted. </p><p>\u201cusually you could run a marathon without breaking a sweat,\u201d ned pointed out.</p><p>peter just shot him a look, turning back to the front of the room. but, after ned pointed it out, he realized he was right - peter hadn\u2019t been this out of breath since before the bite, and that was including all his patrols and training with tony. those training sessions could get intense. </p><p>his side pulsed painfully as if as a reminder and peter let out a grunt. shoot, he\u2019d totally forgotten about that.</p><p>ned looked over at him, concerned, but the tests were being distributed and peter didn\u2019t want to get him in trouble so he just shook his head.</p><p><i>I\u2019m fine</i>, he mouthed. </p><p>ned looked doubtful but turned to the test anyways.</p><p>peter\u2019s side was burning so badly he could hardly concentrate on the test - he had to focus all his energy on not groaning aloud with pain. he held it in - if he made some kind of weird noise in the silent classroom he would never live it down. </p><p>worse still, peter was beginning to feel as if he was enveloped in a foggy haze. his head was unbearably heavy and it required strength to simply keep himself upright. heat was radiating from his skin, no longer just concentrated by his wound, and he realized that he probably had a very high fever. he forced himself to concentrate.</p><p>he went through the test as quickly as possible,  barely reading as he circled answers and flipped through the pages. usually peter liked to take his time with each question and then go back to check but he didn\u2019t have the energy. as soon as he finished he slumped across his desk.</p><p>he felt flash glare at him from across the room and knew that if he looked up he\u2019d probably mouth <i>show off</i> or something, but peter couldn\u2019t be bothered. </p><p>his throat felt dry and suddenly he was so cold he was shivering violently. he needed another jacket or something but he couldn\u2019t force himself to move. the lights were too bright and his head was pounding, so he clenched his eyes closed tightly. he felt like he was experiencing a sensory overload but that wasn\u2019t quite right. it was something else.</p><p>ned was whispering beside him, his voice high with concern but peter couldn\u2019t bother to make it out. </p><p>he vaguely thought, <i>this isn\u2019t right</i>, before slipping into unconsciousness.</p><p><i>the vulture was swooping at him, claws outstretched and a grin curling across his face. peter knew he couldn\u2019t escape. he tried to run but his feet wouldn\u2019t move. </i></p><p>everything was too bright, too loud. he was convulsing, his body jerking without his control.</p><p><i>the claws dug into him, pressing him down and he couldn\u2019t breathe. suddenly the claws were bricks and he was trapped beneath the wreckage of a fallen building, buried alive. he called out but no one heard him, no one was listening. </i></p><p>his classmates were there, staring, as he yelled out. too many people were touching him. he tried to focus beyond the bright lights and he saw ned kneeling next to him crying. mj stood back, her face tight with concern. he tried to tell them he was fine but he couldn\u2019t speak.</p><p><i>his desperate yells changed into a single piercing sound, a gun discharging. he ran forward as ben fell but he couldn\u2019t catch him. he slipped on the blood and it was everywhere, over everything. </i></p><p>there was another voice, sharp, commanding. the yelling and touching stopped. peter could\u2019ve smiled with relief but he was still so tired. someone else was touching him, carrying him. but he didn\u2019t feel overwhelmed anymore, he felt safe. </p><p><i>his uncle smiled at him and peter knew he was going to tell him it was okay, but it wasn\u2019t. it wasn\u2019t at all. peter couldn\u2019t save him. but when ben spoke the voice wasn\u2019t his.</i></p><p>\u201chold on kid.\u201d</p><p>ben\u2019s face swam in front of him, set into a grim look of determination. distantly peter knew this wasn\u2019t how ben looked when he died. he had looked more calm, more soft, more tired. he had accepted his fate, and held peter\u2019s hand the whole time. he didn\u2019t look this steely - there was nothing left to fight.</p><p>\u201cben?\u201d peter asked softly.</p><p>ben froze, looking down at him.</p><p>\u201cpete.\u201d his voice was low, he sounded almost scared. he didn\u2019t sound quite right, but that was okay. he was still warm, familiar.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d peter whispered hoarsely, tears burning his vision, \u201cI couldn\u2019t save you.\u201d</p><p>when ben looked at him, he seemed pained.</p><p>\u201cno peter. it wasn\u2019t your fault, okay?\u201d his voice was so sad, \u201cit\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p><i>it\u2019s okay.</i></p><p>that was exactly what ben had said the first time. he still forgave him. peter felt relief bloom inside of him. it was okay.</p><p>\u201cokay.\u201d</p><p>he felt himself sink against ben, letting himself be comforted. ben was still talking but peter couldn\u2019t hear, and as he drifted off he saw ben\u2019s features begin to twist and distort, melting away. </p><p>like it was all a dream.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>peter woke up in the all too familiar medbay of stark towers. he tried to remember how he got there but he was too tired. he felt weirdly nostalgic and sad. </p><p>tony was in a chair beside his bed. he didn\u2019t seem to notice peter was awake yet.</p><p>\u201cmr. stark?\u201d</p><p>tony gave a slight jump, before turning to peter and giving him a smile, \u201cpete? finally, I\u2019ve been waiting all day. I thought you would never wake up.\u201d</p><p>despite his light words, he seemed sad.</p><p>\u201cwhat happened?\u201d peter struggled to remember, \u201cI had a chemistry test and then I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cwell first of all, from now on karen\u2019s alerting me of all your injuries, no matter what,\u201d tony said sternly, \u201cthen I\u2019ll decide if they\u2019re bad enough for you to come in. no arguments.\u201d</p><p>peter didn\u2019t even try. he was finally starting to piece everything, remembering his cut, \u201cohhh.\u201d</p><p>he looked down pulling up his shirt to look at his side. there was a fresh bandage. </p><p>tony was still watching him, \u201clong story short is that your cut got infected, and your spidey healing made it way worse. you went to school with 106.3 fever, which would\u2019ve killed any normal human by the way. you passed out and had a seizure after your chemistry test.\u201d</p><p>he was struggling to keep his anger out of his voice, \u201cpeter you\u2019re literally a child genius, can you tell me why you couldn\u2019t miss one chemistry test?\u201d</p><p>peter flushed, and then just gave a shrug, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>tony sighed, exasperated, \u201cyou\u2019re going to be the death of me kid.\u201d</p><p>when he saw peter still looking down, he amended in a softer voice, \u201cjust report injuries and don\u2019t stretch yourself kid.\u201d</p><p>peter nodded, \u201cokay.\u201d</p><p>\u201canyways,\u201d tony continued, \u201cyour friend ned noticed the cut on your side and called me, which was good because normal paramedics wouldn\u2019t know what to do with your accelerated healing. I flew over and took you with me and then my people helped you. that\u2019s basically it.\u201d</p><p>tony was avoiding his eyes. peter still felt like he was missing something. he had a sense that mr. stark was avoiding telling him something.</p><p>he also had a memory tugging at the edge of his mind, like he had experienced something amazing but now it was gone.</p><p>\u201cthat\u2019s it?\u201d he persisted.</p><p>tony sighed before continuing, \u201cpeter when I was carrying you out, you were all delirious with fever dreams and hallucinating or whatever.\u201d</p><p>he paused, \u201cyou called me ben.\u201d</p><p>\u201coh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cand you apologized for not being able to save him.\u201d</p><p>peter\u2019s eyes were burning, now that tony was telling him he could vaguely remember it. looking up at ben again had felt like a miracle. </p><p>\u201cpeter, look at me.\u201d</p><p>peter looked up reluctantly, tears rimming his eyes. tony seemed impossibly sad, and he was looking directly into his eyes. peter hastily wiped away the tears.</p><p>\u201cit wasn\u2019t your fault,\u201d tony said gently, \u201cI know what it\u2019s like to blame yourself for senseless tragedies, to feel responsible. believe me, I know.\u201d</p><p>peter didn\u2019t question it, tony held his guilt in the  lines of his face, the weariness in his eyes, the greying of his hair. he held his guilt deep in his soul and it showed all over him.</p><p>\u201cI promise you what happened to ben wasn\u2019t your fault peter. I saw the footage. there was nothing you could\u2019ve done, okay?\u201d </p><p>peter didn\u2019t even try to hide the tears streaming down his face. he nodded, and managed to choke out, \u201cokay.\u201d</p><p>then tony did something unusual, he reached across the bed and pulled peter into a hug. peter returned it, grasping him like he was the only thing left in the world. he smelled like musk and grease, and he felt strong and steady. safe.</p><p>peter couldn\u2019t even bother being embarrassed, he was too drained, too relieved.</p><p>\u201ctony?\u201d he said pulling back, deciding to say it before he chickened out, \u201cI don\u2019t think it was like a random accident that I called you ben.\u201d </p><p>tony looked at him, bidding him on and he continued, \u201cyou remind me of him a little. I don\u2019t know you both make me feel safe I guess.\u201d </p><p>he was blushing but tony seemed to understand. his eyes looked like they were glistening a little but peter couldn\u2019t tell for sure. </p><p>\u201cthanks peter.\u201d there was a lot hidden in those two little words. </p><p>\u201cyou really carried me out in front of everyone?\u201d peter asked, changing the subject. tony nodded with a laugh and peter let out a horrified groan.</p><p>tony grinned, \u201cI helped your street cred kid, why are you complaining? by the way, ned texted you - you got 100 on the test. good job, kid-genius.\u201d</p><p>his eyes were sparkling and peter could detect something a little like pride, and maybe something else too. </p><p>\u201cthanks mr. stark.\u201d</p>",

I don\u2019t want to repeat that. he still doesn\u2019t shut up about me waking him up at 2 in the morning.\u201d</p><p>it was true, tony groused about it every time peter nagged him about his lack of sleep - (\u201clast time I tried to get a good night of sleep you woke me up for a scratch, kid.\u201d)</p><p>peter knew tony was just deflecting so peter wouldn\u2019t mention his insomnia anymore. if he knew peter was actually injured he would definitely insist peter report to him, but peter still felt bad. </p><p>karen sounded exasperated, \u201cyou know he\u2019d want you to report this. my scans are telling me that your cut has a high probability of getting infected.\u201d</p><p>peter winced, that was exactly what he was afraid of - the knife that had cut him had been rusty. still, he reflected, checking the shallow wound, it didn\u2019t look bad, and it definitely didn\u2019t look worth calling mr. stark about.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he said with finality, pulling off his mask before karen could retort. he felt kind of bad about it but he had an ap chem midterm to prepare for and making a big deal out of the injury would cut down on his study time. he would just bandage it before bed.</p><p>after about an hour peter was reasonably confident in his chemistry knowledge, and so he put away his books and prepared for bed, slipping into the bathroom to bandage the cut.</p><p>he shouldn\u2019t have gotten it at all but he\u2019d been being careless during a mugging. he\u2019d totally forgot to check the man for other weapons after disarming him of his gun and webbing him up. luckily his spider sense had whirled with warning and allowed him time to dodge the knife attack, preventing anything life threatening, but it had still grazed him.</p><p>he checked the cut as he put on the bandage - it was just a shallow flesh wound, cut along his side but the skin around it looked red and inflamed, and intense heat seemed to radiate from it.</p><p>peter dismissed it uneasily, reasoning that if there was really something wrong his spidey sense would tell him.</p><p>still, he felt weirdly heavy and tired as he tunneled under the covers and his cut pulsed painfully. he drifted off into an uncomfortable sleep, pestered by nightmares of fire curling up his side.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>he woke up late, groggy and strangely exhausted despite his relatively long night of sleep. his joints ached, and when he stood his whole body protested, his muscles tight and sore.</p><p>he almost collapsed back into bed before remembering his chemistry midterm. he glanced at his watch - he was already 10 minutes late. crap.</p><p>he threw on pants and a midtown sweater and practically tumbled out the door, throwing a hasty good bye to may as he went. he\u2019d meant to check the bandage in the morning but in his rush he forgot.</p><p>he ran practically the whole way to school and, despite his abilities, he was sweaty and out of breath when he finally arrived. the bell rang just as he collapsed into the desk beside ned, and his teacher gave him an unimpressed look.</p><p>\u201cnice of you to join us mr. parker.\u201d</p><p>peter just managed a weak smile back.</p><p>\u201cdude, what\u2019s up with you?\u201d ned asked in a whisper, appraising his disheveled look and flushed cheeks as their teacher went over the instructions for the test.</p><p>\u201cI just woke up late and had to run to make it here,\u201d peter panted. </p><p>\u201cusually you could run a marathon without breaking a sweat,\u201d ned pointed out.</p><p>peter just shot him a look, turning back to the front of the room. but, after ned pointed it out, he realized he was right - peter hadn\u2019t been this out of breath since before the bite, and that was including all his patrols and training with tony. those training sessions could get intense. </p><p>his side pulsed painfully as if as a reminder and peter let out a grunt. shoot, he\u2019d totally forgotten about that.</p><p>ned looked over at him, concerned, but the tests were being distributed and peter didn\u2019t want to get him in trouble so he just shook his head.</p><p><i>I\u2019m fine</i>, he mouthed. </p><p>ned looked doubtful but turned to the test anyways.</p><p>peter\u2019s side was burning so badly he could hardly concentrate on the test - he had to focus all his energy on not groaning aloud with pain. he held it in - if he made some kind of weird noise in the silent classroom he would never live it down. </p><p>worse still, peter was beginning to feel as if he was enveloped in a foggy haze. his head was unbearably heavy and it required strength to simply keep himself upright. heat was radiating from his skin, no longer just concentrated by his wound, and he realized that he probably had a very high fever. he forced himself to concentrate.</p><p>he went through the test as quickly as possible,  barely reading as he circled answers and flipped through the pages. usually peter liked to take his time with each question and then go back to check but he didn\u2019t have the energy. as soon as he finished he slumped across his desk.</p><p>he felt flash glare at him from across the room and knew that if he looked up he\u2019d probably mouth <i>show off</i> or something, but peter couldn\u2019t be bothered. </p><p>his throat felt dry and suddenly he was so cold he was shivering violently. he needed another jacket or something but he couldn\u2019t force himself to move. the lights were too bright and his head was pounding, so he clenched his eyes closed tightly. he felt like he was experiencing a sensory overload but that wasn\u2019t quite right. it was something else.</p><p>ned was whispering beside him, his voice high with concern but peter couldn\u2019t bother to make it out. </p><p>he vaguely thought, <i>this isn\u2019t right</i>, before slipping into unconsciousness.</p><p><i>the vulture was swooping at him, claws outstretched and a grin curling across his face. peter knew he couldn\u2019t escape. he tried to run but his feet wouldn\u2019t move. </i></p><p>everything was too bright, too loud. he was convulsing, his body jerking without his control.</p><p><i>the claws dug into him, pressing him down and he couldn\u2019t breathe. suddenly the claws were bricks and he was trapped beneath the wreckage of a fallen building, buried alive. he called out but no one heard him, no one was listening. </i></p><p>his classmates were there, staring, as he yelled out. too many people were touching him. he tried to focus beyond the bright lights and he saw ned kneeling next to him crying. mj stood back, her face tight with concern. he tried to tell them he was fine but he couldn\u2019t speak.</p><p><i>his desperate yells changed into a single piercing sound, a gun discharging. he ran forward as ben fell but he couldn\u2019t catch him. he slipped on the blood and it was everywhere, over everything. </i></p><p>there was another voice, sharp, commanding. the yelling and touching stopped. peter could\u2019ve smiled with relief but he was still so tired. someone else was touching him, carrying him. but he didn\u2019t feel overwhelmed anymore, he felt safe. </p><p><i>his uncle smiled at him and peter knew he was going to tell him it was okay, but it wasn\u2019t. it wasn\u2019t at all. peter couldn\u2019t save him. but when ben spoke the voice wasn\u2019t his.</i></p><p>\u201chold on kid.\u201d</p><p>ben\u2019s face swam in front of him, set into a grim look of determination. distantly peter knew this wasn\u2019t how ben looked when he died. he had looked more calm, more soft, more tired. he had accepted his fate, and held peter\u2019s hand the whole time. he didn\u2019t look this steely -

                "content": "<p><h1>fever:</h1><h2>whump prompt 8</h2><p>peter let out a low grunt as he scaled the side of his apartment, creeping to his bedroom window.</p><p>&ldquo;peter are you sure you don&rsquo;t want me to contact mr. stark?&rdquo; karen asked for the third time, and if peter wasn&rsquo;t mistaken she sounded disapproving.</p><p>&ldquo;yes I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; peter insisted as he lowered himself through the window, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to bother him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;he told you to contact him any time you got severely injured,&rdquo; karen reminded him, &ldquo;I doubt this would bother him.&rdquo;</p><p>peter groaned, &ldquo;karen I&rsquo;m fine. this isn&rsquo;t severe - it&rsquo;s just a cut. besides, remember last time you insisted we call him and by the time he arrived it already was healed? I don&rsquo;t want to repeat that. he still doesn&rsquo;t shut up about me waking him up at 2 in the morning.&rdquo;</p><p>it was true, tony groused about it every time peter nagged him about his lack of sleep - (&ldquo;last time I tried to get a good night of sleep you woke me up for a scratch, kid.&rdquo;)</p><p>peter knew tony was just deflecting so peter wouldn&rsquo;t mention his insomnia anymore. if he knew peter was actually injured he would definitely insist peter report to him, but peter still felt bad. </p><p>karen sounded exasperated, &ldquo;you know he&rsquo;d want you to report this. my scans are telling me that your cut has a high probability of getting infected.&rdquo;</p><p>peter winced, that was exactly what he was afraid of - the knife that had cut him had been rusty. still, he reflected, checking the shallow wound, it didn&rsquo;t look bad, and it definitely didn&rsquo;t look worth calling mr. stark about.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; he said with finality, pulling off his mask before karen could retort. he felt kind of bad about it but he had an ap chem midterm to prepare for and making a big deal out of the injury would cut down on his study time. he would just bandage it before bed.</p><p>after about an hour peter was reasonably confident in his chemistry knowledge, and so he put away his books and prepared for bed, slipping into the bathroom to bandage the cut.</p><p>he shouldn&rsquo;t have gotten it at all but he&rsquo;d been being careless during a mugging. he&rsquo;d totally forgot to check the man for other weapons after disarming him of his gun and webbing him up. luckily his spider sense had whirled with warning and allowed him time to dodge the knife attack, preventing anything life threatening, but it had still grazed him.</p><p>he checked the cut as he put on the bandage - it was just a shallow flesh wound, cut along his side but the skin around it looked red and inflamed, and intense heat seemed to radiate from it.</p><p>peter dismissed it uneasily, reasoning that if there was really something wrong his spidey sense would tell him.</p><p>still, he felt weirdly heavy and tired as he tunneled under the covers and his cut pulsed painfully. he drifted off into an uncomfortable sleep, pestered by nightmares of fire curling up his side.</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>he woke up late, groggy and strangely exhausted despite his relatively long night of sleep. his joints ached, and when he stood his whole body protested, his muscles tight and sore.</p><p>he almost collapsed back into bed before remembering his chemistry midterm. he glanced at his watch - he was already 10 minutes late. crap.</p><p>he threw on pants and a midtown sweater and practically tumbled out the door, throwing a hasty good bye to may as he went. he&rsquo;d meant to check the bandage in the morning but in his rush he forgot.</p><p>he ran practically the whole way to school and, despite his abilities, he was sweaty and out of breath when he finally arrived. the bell rang just as he collapsed into the desk beside ned, and his teacher gave him an unimpressed look.</p><p>&ldquo;nice of you to join us mr. parker.&rdquo;</p><p>peter just managed a weak smile back.</p><p>&ldquo;dude, what&rsquo;s up with you?&rdquo; ned asked in a whisper, appraising his disheveled look and flushed cheeks as their teacher went over the instructions for the test.</p><p>&ldquo;I just woke up late and had to run to make it here,&rdquo; peter panted. </p><p>&ldquo;usually you could run a marathon without breaking a sweat,&rdquo; ned pointed out.</p><p>peter just shot him a look, turning back to the front of the room. but, after ned pointed it out, he realized he was right - peter hadn&rsquo;t been this out of breath since before the bite, and that was including all his patrols and training with tony. those training sessions could get intense. </p><p>his side pulsed painfully as if as a reminder and peter let out a grunt. shoot, he&rsquo;d totally forgotten about that.</p><p>ned looked over at him, concerned, but the tests were being distributed and peter didn&rsquo;t want to get him in trouble so he just shook his head.</p><p><i>I&rsquo;m fine</i>, he mouthed. </p><p>ned looked doubtful but turned to the test anyways.</p><p>peter&rsquo;s side was burning so badly he could hardly concentrate on the test - he had to focus all his energy on not groaning aloud with pain. he held it in - if he made some kind of weird noise in the silent classroom he would never live it down. </p><p>worse still, peter was beginning to feel as if he was enveloped in a foggy haze. his head was unbearably heavy and it required strength to simply keep himself upright. heat was radiating from his skin, no longer just concentrated by his wound, and he realized that he probably had a very high fever. he forced himself to concentrate.</p><p>he went through the test as quickly as possible,  barely reading as he circled answers and flipped through the pages. usually peter liked to take his time with each question and then go back to check but he didn&rsquo;t have the energy. as soon as he finished he slumped across his desk.</p><p>he felt flash glare at him from across the room and knew that if he looked up he&rsquo;d probably mouth <i>show off</i> or something, but peter couldn&rsquo;t be bothered. </p><p>his throat felt dry and suddenly he was so cold he was shivering violently. he needed another jacket or something but he couldn&rsquo;t force himself to move. the lights were too bright and his head was pounding, so he clenched his eyes closed tightly. he felt like he was experiencing a sensory overload but that wasn&rsquo;t quite right. it was something else.</p><p>ned was whispering beside him, his voice high with concern but peter couldn&rsquo;t bother to make it out. </p><p>he vaguely thought, <i>this isn&rsquo;t right</i>, before slipping into unconsciousness.</p><p><i>the vulture was swooping at him, claws outstretched and a grin curling across his face. peter knew he couldn&rsquo;t escape. he tried to run but his feet wouldn&rsquo;t move. </i></p><p>everything was too bright, too loud. he was convulsing, his body jerking without his control.</p><p><i>the claws dug into him, pressing him down and he couldn&rsquo;t breathe. suddenly the claws were bricks and he was trapped beneath the wreckage of a fallen building, buried alive. he called out but no one heard him, no one was listening. </i></p><p>his classmates were there, staring, as he yelled out. too many people were touching him. he tried to focus beyond the bright lights and he saw ned kneeling next to him crying. mj stood back, her face tight with concern. he tried to tell them he was fine but he couldn&rsquo;t speak.</p><p><i>his desperate yells changed into a single piercing sound, a gun discharging. he ran forward as ben fell but he couldn&rsquo;t catch him. he slipped on the blood and it was everywhere, over everything. </i></p><p>there was another voice, sharp, commanding. the yelling and touching stopped. peter could&rsquo;ve smiled with relief but he was still so tired. someone else was touching him, carrying him. but he didn&rsquo;t feel overwhelmed anymore, he felt safe. </p><p><i>his uncle smiled at him and peter knew he was going to tell him it was okay, but it wasn&rsquo;t. it wasn&rsquo;t at all. peter couldn&rsquo;t save him. but when ben spoke the voice wasn&rsquo;t his.</i></p><p>&ldquo;hold on kid.&rdquo;</p><p>ben&rsquo;s face swam in front of him, set into a grim look of determination. distantly peter knew this wasn&rsquo;t how ben looked when he died. he had looked more calm, more soft, more tired. he had accepted his fate, and held peter&rsquo;s hand the whole time. he didn&rsquo;t look this steely - there was nothing left to fight.</p><p>&ldquo;ben?&rdquo; peter asked softly.</p><p>ben froze, looking down at him.</p><p>&ldquo;pete.&rdquo; his voice was low, he sounded almost scared. he didn&rsquo;t sound quite right, but that was okay. he was still warm, familiar.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; peter whispered hoarsely, tears burning his vision, &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t save you.&rdquo;</p><p>when ben looked at him, he seemed pained.</p><p>&ldquo;no peter. it wasn&rsquo;t your fault, okay?&rdquo; his voice was so sad, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo;</p><p><i>it&rsquo;s okay.</i></p><p>that was exactly what ben had said the first time. he still forgave him. peter felt relief bloom inside of him. it was okay.</p><p>&ldquo;okay.&rdquo;</p><p>he felt himself sink against ben, letting himself be comforted. ben was still talking but peter couldn&rsquo;t hear, and as he drifted off he saw ben&rsquo;s features begin to twist and distort, melting away. </p><p>like it was all a dream.</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>peter woke up in the all too familiar medbay of stark towers. he tried to remember how he got there but he was too tired. he felt weirdly nostalgic and sad. </p><p>tony was in a chair beside his bed. he didn&rsquo;t seem to notice peter was awake yet.</p><p>&ldquo;mr. stark?&rdquo;</p><p>tony gave a slight jump, before turning to peter and giving him a smile, &ldquo;pete? finally, I&rsquo;ve been waiting all day. I thought you would never wake up.&rdquo;</p><p>despite his light words, he seemed sad.</p><p>&ldquo;what happened?&rdquo; peter struggled to remember, &ldquo;I had a chemistry test and then I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;well first of all, from now on karen&rsquo;s alerting me of all your injuries, no matter what,&rdquo; tony said sternly, &ldquo;then I&rsquo;ll decide if they&rsquo;re bad enough for you to come in. no arguments.&rdquo;</p><p>peter didn&rsquo;t even try. he was finally starting to piece everything, remembering his cut, &ldquo;ohhh.&rdquo;</p><p>he looked down pulling up his shirt to look at his side. there was a fresh bandage. </p><p>tony was still watching him, &ldquo;long story short is that your cut got infected, and your spidey healing made it way worse. you went to school with 106.3 fever, which would&rsquo;ve killed any normal human by the way. you passed out and had a seizure after your chemistry test.&rdquo;</p><p>he was struggling to keep his anger out of his voice, &ldquo;peter you&rsquo;re literally a child genius, can you tell me why you couldn&rsquo;t miss one chemistry test?&rdquo;</p><p>peter flushed, and then just gave a shrug, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p><p>tony sighed, exasperated, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re going to be the death of me kid.&rdquo;</p><p>when he saw peter still looking down, he amended in a softer voice, &ldquo;just report injuries and don&rsquo;t stretch yourself kid.&rdquo;</p><p>peter nodded, &ldquo;okay.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;anyways,&rdquo; tony continued, &ldquo;your friend ned noticed the cut on your side and called me, which was good because normal paramedics wouldn&rsquo;t know what to do with your accelerated healing.

        "answer": "<p>1. Tony owns this restaurant, called <i>The Iron Man</i>. It\u2019s high-end, of course, has several stars. And Tony himself is the chef cook. He is good and he knows it and it plays into his public persona of being arrogant about his success. Stephen is a food critic and Tony is a thorn in his side. That\u2019s why he decides to pay a visit to <i>The Iron Man</i>. He is very much aware of his own influence and his scathing reviews which label him as the toughest cookie in the business.</p><p>2. The problem with two egos of this size is, that they will clash sooner or later. Not in a big boom, but through thinly veiled insults, dealt with calm smiles. Pepper informs Tony immediately about Stephen\u2019s presence in his restaurant and Tony makes sure to bring him his order himself. (\u2019Ah, Mr. Stark, gracing me with your presence? What an honour.\u2019\u2014\u2019Well, need to make sure that my biggest fan gets the best service.\u2019)</p><p>3. Stephen was prepared to find the smallest thing that\u2019s wrong with Tony\u2019s cooking to rip him apart. It would bring him great pleasure to bring the Iron Cook to his knees. But he just can\u2019t seem to find any fault in his order, everything tastes exquisite. He would never admit to it, but it somehow tastes like home.</p><p>4. Out of his depth he marches into the kitchen, only to be greeted by a brightly smiling Tony Stark. (\u2019Now, usually our guests stay out of the kitchen, but I\u2019ll make an exception for you, Mr. Strange. Let me show you around!\u2019) Stephen is seething, but he masks his fury and nods, swallowing every response he has to Tony\u2019s shit-eating grin. Tony relishes in bringing the Gourmet Wizard to his knees, as Stephen has always found something that wasn\u2019t to his liking.</p><p>5. In the end Stephen begrudgingly admits that Tony\u2019s food is the best he has ever tasted, including his mother\u2019s. His critique shows it and Tony is pleased by the result. So pleased that he does everything to get into contact with Stephen again. (\u2019This time I will cook just for you. How about 7 p.m. on Friday at my apartment?\u2019\u2014\u2019\u2026 Fine. But only if you make that fantastic asparagus cream soup.\u2019)</p>",
