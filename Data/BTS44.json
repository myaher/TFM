So I won&rsquo;t feel stupid when he, you know, <i>breaks up with me</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>If</i> he breaks up with you.&rdquo; Only now that Jimin pointed it out do you become painfully aware of your choice of words. &ldquo;Which he <i>won&rsquo;t</i>, obviously. Or he would have talked about it to either Namjoon or me. I think we can both agree that Yoongi is not too big on sharing his feelings, but he surely would never make such a drastic choice without consulting his closest friends first.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know that.&rdquo; There is an undeniable quiver in your voice which you are sure does not go unnoticed by Jimin. </p><p>&ldquo;You are right, I <i>don&rsquo;t</i>,&rdquo; he admits, his voice as tender as his warm Koala hugs. You could really use one of those now. \u201dBut what I <i>do</i> know is that, no matter what, I&rsquo;ll be here for you. So don&rsquo;t be too scared, Y/nnie. You&rsquo;ll get through this.&ldquo; </p><p>&quot;We&rsquo;ll see &hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>You almost jump out of your skin at the sudden sound of the doorbell ringing, announcing Yoongi&rsquo;s dreaded arrival. </p><p>&ldquo;Was that the door?&rdquo; Jimin asks. </p><p>\u201cYes. I&rsquo;ve gotta go.&ldquo; </p><p>With these words, you end the call and grab your purse before running off to answer the door to your small studio apartment. </p><p>You were expecting him. Nonetheless, your heart stumbles at the sight of no other than Min Yoongi standing in the dimly lit hallway of your apartment building, eyes lowered to the ground, hands clasped behind his back when you open the door. He looks thin, his cheeks hollow. </p><p>&quot;Hey,&rdquo; he greets you, the reluctant half-smile tugging at the corner of his mouth knocking the air straight out of your lungs.</p><p>&ldquo;H-Hey.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;We should get going while the weather is still agreeable. The sun&rsquo;s out, but the forecast predicted rain showers later today.&rdquo; </p><p>Without waiting for your response or reaction, Yoongi turns his back on you and starts making his way down the stairs to the street door. Quickly, you slip into your shoes and follow him, making sure not to run to preserve at least <i>some</i> of your dignity. </p><p>Seriously, who does he think he <i>is</i>? Only messaging you one day ahead, letting you know that you <i>have</i> to meet, not even inquiring whether or not the chosen time and place would even be <i>convenient</i> for you. As if you have nothing better to do than sit around and wait for him all day when he rarely ever deemed it necessary to call you \u2013 or pick up <i>your</i> calls \u2013 these past few months. </p><p>&ldquo;Yoongi, wait!&rdquo; you call after him, struggling to keep up with his smart pace once you are out in the street, only now realizing that you left your jacket hanging by your door, having been completely thrown off by Yoongi&rsquo;s baffling behavior. </p><p>But he doesn&rsquo;t even slow down for a second. Both hands buried in his jacket pockets, black hood and baseball cap drawn deep down into his face, concealing it from your view, Yoongi keeps striding on, even mending his pace. Until he stops cold in his step and turns around, so unexpectedly you collide with his toned chest. </p><p>&ldquo;What the <i>hell</i>, Yoongi!?\u201d </p><p>&quot;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; he mutters, avoiding your gaze as he gently grabs you by your elbows to hold you at arm&rsquo;s length. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I thought I could do this, but I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Do <i>what</i>, Yoongi? You&rsquo;re starting to freak me out.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Then stop <i>apologizing</i> and tell me what the hell is going on!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m \u2013 I don&rsquo;t <i>know</i>. Could we maybe just take a walk for now?&rdquo; </p><p>You know Yoongi well enough to recognize the fear in his eyes. No. Not just <i>fear</i>. Sheer <i>panic</i>. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; you nod. \u201cOkay. Let&rsquo;s walk.&ldquo; </p><p>And so you do. Walk. In perfect silence for minutes on end, side by side, each occupied with your own thoughts as you wander through the empty back streets of Seoul under the setting sun, circling your block a good half a dozen times before Yoongi looks at you for the first time. You feign ignorance, but you can feel his gaze settling on your side profile. </p><p>&quot;Y/n. You&rsquo;re only wearing a sweatshirt,&rdquo; he suddenly remarks, slowing down. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cold, you should take my jacket,&ldquo; he then states, already taking off his coat.</p><p>&quot;And then <i>what</i>?&rdquo; you scoff, coming to a halt a few feet ahead of him. \u201cThen <i>you&rsquo;ll</i> be cold. What good will that do? Your voice is worth millions, as I recall it. Do you really think I can afford to get you sick? Besides, I&rsquo;m fine. And it&rsquo;s my fault, after all. <i>I</i> left my jacket. I should have been ready when you came to pick me up. And it&rsquo;s not like this is the first time I&rsquo;m cold. I can deal. I&rsquo;m no damsel in distress.&ldquo; </p><p>Your head held up high, you turn back around and continue walking. To your surprise, however, you can hear a low chuckle coming from behind you where Yoongi is still standing, unmoving. </p><p>&rdquo;<i>What</i>?&ldquo; you demand to know the cause for his amusement.</p><p>&quot;I just forgot how stubborn you are, that\u2019s all,\u201d he grins, his expression strangely affectionate, considering the previous course of this meeting. &quot;You&rsquo;re so adorable when you get angry.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not <i>angry</i>,&rdquo; you groan. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes, you are. At yourself. For being such a dumbass.&rdquo; </p><p>At this point, he&rsquo;s just asking for trouble. When you turn back towards him, Yoongi&rsquo;s eyes are sparkling with mischief, peeking at you out from under the brim of his cap. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>really</i>?&rdquo; you wonder, slowly meandering towards him, head tilted to one side, eying him intently. Still smiling, Yoongi mirrors your gesture, licking his lips, getting ready to play. &ldquo;So, you can see right through me, huh?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I <i>can</i>,&rdquo; he boldly states, not even hesitating for a second. </p><p>&ldquo;Well, then I&rsquo;m clearly at a disadvantage here. Because I can&rsquo;t figure out what the hell is going on here, Yoongi.&rdquo; Standing in front of him now, you pause, the tension between your bodies palpable, the silence so heavy you could cut it with a knife. &ldquo;And what the <i>fuck</i> you want from me.&rdquo; </p><p>Suddenly, Yoongi&rsquo;s glance darkens, a cold shadow falling over his soft features. </p><p>&ldquo;Initially, I came here to \u2013&rdquo; He can&rsquo;t seem to bring himself to finish the sentence. </p><p>&ldquo;To <i>break up</i> with me,&rdquo; you do it for him. </p><p> His eyes grow wide with surprise. </p><p>&ldquo;You <i>knew</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I had a feeling.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I see. That&rsquo;s something I always admired about you, you know. Your intuition. Your empathy. I think those are fairly attractive qualities.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;So?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So <i>what</i>?&rdquo; he echoes.</p><p>&ldquo;Why <i>didn&rsquo;t</i> you? Break up with me? Or \u2013 Are you \u2013\u201c</p><p>&quot;No,&rdquo; he shakes his head. &ldquo;Oh, no. I&rsquo;m not gonna break up with you, Y/n. Not <i>today</i>, anyway.&rdquo; He pauses. &ldquo;Come to think of it, I don&rsquo;t particularly like today.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, me neither,&rdquo; you agree, reaching out to take Yoongi&rsquo;s cold hands into your own, your gaze still locked with his as your heart is overflowing with relief. &ldquo;I mean, wouldn&rsquo;t it be a terribly <i>cold</i> day to kill our love? So grey and dreary? Let&rsquo;s wait till spring, maybe, when it&rsquo;s warmer, and the cherry trees are in full bloom, and break up then, if you still want to. Until then, let&rsquo;s agree not to make any rash decisions. Instead, let&rsquo;s just see how we feel about us <i>then</i>, and keep this up for a little while longer. Because I have a feeling, we&rsquo;d be fools for giving up now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, fools, indeed.&rdquo; </p><p>For a few seconds, you merely look at Yoongi, drinking up the familiar sight of his features. His feline eyes with their brown orbs, deep and dark like infinite wells of pain, wisdom, loneliness, and immeasurable beauty; the softly rounded tip of his nose, reddened by the brisk winter breeze; his pink lips, slightly pursed, in their natural state of a pout. All this makes up the man you love. All this, and <i>so</i> much more that will never be perceptible to the untrained eye. But you, <i>you</i> could always see beyond the fa\u00e7ade, glimpse the man behind the mask. A man afraid of loss, of rejection and, most of all, of his own shortcomings. </p><p>&ldquo;For now, let&rsquo;s just be us,&rdquo; you whisper as you get up on your tiptoes and let go of Yoongi&rsquo;s hands to cup his cheeks with your palms. &ldquo;Because, whatever we are, it&rsquo;s <i>good</i>.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Yoongi says, slowly nodding his head, his voice low and his gaze so intense, you can feel your soul melting away, running towards him. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I ever told you this.\u201d Now, his arms close around your waist, pulling you to his chest. &quot;But I&rsquo;ve never felt this safe with anybody else before, Y/n. And it&rsquo;s <i>scary</i>. <i>Hella</i> scary. And with all the distance, I just \u2013 I got in my head. And I know I&rsquo;m not always easy. And heaven knows I&rsquo;ve made things harder on us than they should have been. This relationship was work from its very beginning. And I blamed it on my profession. The truth, however, is that I was making <i>excuses</i>. Because I was scared <i>shitless</i>. Afraid of allowing this to grow, of getting hurt. <i>Again</i>. So I wanted to take the easy way out before it would be too late, actually having convinced myself that it would be what&rsquo;s best for <i>you</i>. But I was wrong. This is great, and you are the best thing that ever happened to me. Well, the best <i>person</i>, anyway. And I don&rsquo;t want to lose you, Y/n.&rdquo; </p><p>Smiling through tears, you wrap your arms around Yoongi&rsquo;s neck and draw yourself up to his height. </p><p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad you came to that conclusion.\u201d You rest your forehead against his. &quot;But what made you think I would have just let your bullshit <i>pass</i>, hmm?&rdquo; </p><p>Your words elicit a stifled laugh from him. </p><p>&ldquo;What? Did you actually believe I would have just let you go like this?&rdquo; You recline in his embrace to get a better look at his face. &ldquo;Well, Min Yoongi, brace yourself. Because I&rsquo;m not gonna let you fuck this up, you hear me? As long as there&rsquo;s still some life left in this relationship, I&rsquo;m gonna fight for us. So, get ready to get bruised.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Brave words for a girl that bruises like a peach.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I have sensitive skin. So what? Are you implying I&rsquo;m a weakling?&rdquo; </p><p>Without warning, you jump up to enclose Yoongi&rsquo;s waist with your legs. He stumbles backwards but manages to keep his balance.</p><p>&ldquo;I would <i>never</i> suggest anything of that sort,&rdquo; he then smiles. &ldquo;My little fighter.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Little</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did I mention you&rsquo;re adorable?&rdquo; Yoongi cooes, a smug smirk lingering on his rosy lips. </p><p>&ldquo;Cut it out!&rdquo; you warn him. &ldquo;Or I&rsquo;m going to <i>punch</i> you \u2013&rdquo;</p><p>Slowly, you lower your face towards his. You&rsquo;re so close now, you can feel Yoongi&rsquo;s warm breath brushing past your skin. </p><p>&ldquo;\u2013 in the <i>mouth</i> with my <i>own</i> mouth, <i>softly</i>. Because I love you. And I&rsquo;ve been wanting to kiss you for months.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So shut up and <i>do</i> it already.&rdquo; </p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"251\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"jjungcooks:rhsQaa-P2v0wCqEDHsk54A:Z83DUe2ZNHbhX\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8e007186ff0d541e522ce0aa3d420a84/tumblr_pb5e4anlA11w73e04o1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"251\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"1494\" data-orig-height=\"11\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/768411c134657b8af4566b0ca3c1156e/tumblr_inline_pppgkxQt2u1vslk3d_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1494\" data-orig-height=\"11\"/></figure><p>I know I haven\u2019t posted writing in a while, so I really hope you enjoyed this.\u00a0</p><p><i>Much love, Ana</i> \ud83d\udc96</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1494\" data-orig-height=\"11\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/768411c134657b8af4566b0ca3c1156e/tumblr_inline_pppglc2gC41vslk3d_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1494\" data-orig-height=\"11\"/></figure><p><i>None of the GIFs used are mine.

You could really use one of those now. \u201dBut what I <i>do</i> know is that, no matter what, I\u2019ll be here for you. So don\u2019t be too scared, Y/nnie. You\u2019ll get through this.\u201c </p><p>\"We\u2019ll see \u2026\u201d </p><p>You almost jump out of your skin at the sudden sound of the doorbell ringing, announcing Yoongi\u2019s dreaded arrival. </p><p>\u201cWas that the door?\u201d Jimin asks. </p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019ve gotta go.\u201c </p><p>With these words, you end the call and grab your purse before running off to answer the door to your small studio apartment. </p><p>You were expecting him. Nonetheless, your heart stumbles at the sight of no other than Min Yoongi standing in the dimly lit hallway of your apartment building, eyes lowered to the ground, hands clasped behind his back when you open the door. He looks thin, his cheeks hollow. </p><p>\"Hey,\u201d he greets you, the reluctant half-smile tugging at the corner of his mouth knocking the air straight out of your lungs.</p><p>\u201cH-Hey.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe should get going while the weather is still agreeable. The sun\u2019s out, but the forecast predicted rain showers later today.\u201d </p><p>Without waiting for your response or reaction, Yoongi turns his back on you and starts making his way down the stairs to the street door. Quickly, you slip into your shoes and follow him, making sure not to run to preserve at least <i>some</i> of your dignity. </p><p>Seriously, who does he think he <i>is</i>? Only messaging you one day ahead, letting you know that you <i>have</i> to meet, not even inquiring whether or not the chosen time and place would even be <i>convenient</i> for you. As if you have nothing better to do than sit around and wait for him all day when he rarely ever deemed it necessary to call you \u2013 or pick up <i>your</i> calls \u2013 these past few months. </p><p>\u201cYoongi, wait!\u201d you call after him, struggling to keep up with his smart pace once you are out in the street, only now realizing that you left your jacket hanging by your door, having been completely thrown off by Yoongi\u2019s baffling behavior. </p><p>But he doesn\u2019t even slow down for a second. Both hands buried in his jacket pockets, black hood and baseball cap drawn deep down into his face, concealing it from your view, Yoongi keeps striding on, even mending his pace. Until he stops cold in his step and turns around, so unexpectedly you collide with his toned chest. </p><p>\u201cWhat the <i>hell</i>, Yoongi!?\u201d </p><p>\"I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he mutters, avoiding your gaze as he gently grabs you by your elbows to hold you at arm\u2019s length. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I thought I could do this, but I can\u2019t.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDo <i>what</i>, Yoongi? You\u2019re starting to freak me out.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThen stop <i>apologizing</i> and tell me what the hell is going on!\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m \u2013 I don\u2019t <i>know</i>. Could we maybe just take a walk for now?\u201d </p><p>You know Yoongi well enough to recognize the fear in his eyes. No. Not just <i>fear</i>. Sheer <i>panic</i>. </p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d you nod. \u201cOkay. Let\u2019s walk.\u201c </p><p>And so you do. Walk. In perfect silence for minutes on end, side by side, each occupied with your own thoughts as you wander through the empty back streets of Seoul under the setting sun, circling your block a good half a dozen times before Yoongi looks at you for the first time. You feign ignorance, but you can feel his gaze settling on your side profile. </p><p>\"Y/n. You\u2019re only wearing a sweatshirt,\u201d he suddenly remarks, slowing down. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cold, you should take my jacket,\u201c he then states, already taking off his coat.</p><p>\"And then <i>what</i>?\u201d you scoff, coming to a halt a few feet ahead of him. \u201cThen <i>you\u2019ll</i> be cold. What good will that do? Your voice is worth millions, as I recall it. Do you really think I can afford to get you sick? Besides, I\u2019m fine. And it\u2019s my fault, after all. <i>I</i> left my jacket. I should have been ready when you came to pick me up. And it\u2019s not like this is the first time I\u2019m cold. I can deal. I\u2019m no damsel in distress.\u201c </p><p>Your head held up high, you turn back around and continue walking. To your surprise, however, you can hear a low chuckle coming from behind you where Yoongi is still standing, unmoving. </p><p>\u201d<i>What</i>?\u201c you demand to know the cause for his amusement.</p><p>\"I just forgot how stubborn you are, that\u2019s all,\u201d he grins, his expression strangely affectionate, considering the previous course of this meeting. \"You\u2019re so adorable when you get angry.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not <i>angry</i>,\u201d you groan. </p><p>\u201cYes, you are. At yourself. For being such a dumbass.\u201d </p><p>At this point, he\u2019s just asking for trouble. When you turn back towards him, Yoongi\u2019s eyes are sparkling with mischief, peeking at you out from under the brim of his cap. </p><p>\u201cOh, <i>really</i>?\u201d you wonder, slowly meandering towards him, head tilted to one side, eying him intently. Still smiling, Yoongi mirrors your gesture, licking his lips, getting ready to play. \u201cSo, you can see right through me, huh?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes, I <i>can</i>,\u201d he boldly states, not even hesitating for a second. </p><p>\u201cWell, then I\u2019m clearly at a disadvantage here. Because I can\u2019t figure out what the hell is going on here, Yoongi.\u201d Standing in front of him now, you pause, the tension between your bodies palpable, the silence so heavy you could cut it with a knife. \u201cAnd what the <i>fuck</i> you want from me.\u201d </p><p>Suddenly, Yoongi\u2019s glance darkens, a cold shadow falling over his soft features. </p><p>\u201cInitially, I came here to \u2013\u201d He can\u2019t seem to bring himself to finish the sentence. </p><p>\u201cTo <i>break up</i> with me,\u201d you do it for him. </p><p> His eyes grow wide with surprise. </p><p>\u201cYou <i>knew</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a feeling.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI see. That\u2019s something I always admired about you, you know. Your intuition. Your empathy. I think those are fairly attractive qualities.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo <i>what</i>?\u201d he echoes.</p><p>\u201cWhy <i>didn\u2019t</i> you? Break up with me? Or \u2013 Are you \u2013\u201c</p><p>\"No,\u201d he shakes his head. \u201cOh, no. I\u2019m not gonna break up with you, Y/n. Not <i>today</i>, anyway.\u201d He pauses. \u201cCome to think of it, I don\u2019t particularly like today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, me neither,\u201d you agree, reaching out to take Yoongi\u2019s cold hands into your own, your gaze still locked with his as your heart is overflowing with relief. \u201cI mean, wouldn\u2019t it be a terribly <i>cold</i> day to kill our love? So grey and dreary? Let\u2019s wait till spring, maybe, when it\u2019s warmer, and the cherry trees are in full bloom, and break up then, if you still want to. Until then, let\u2019s agree not to make any rash decisions. Instead, let\u2019s just see how we feel about us <i>then</i>, and keep this up for a little while longer. Because I have a feeling, we\u2019d be fools for giving up now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, fools, indeed.\u201d </p><p>For a few seconds, you merely look at Yoongi, drinking up the familiar sight of his features. His feline eyes with their brown orbs, deep and dark like infinite wells of pain, wisdom, loneliness, and immeasurable beauty; the softly rounded tip of his nose, reddened by the brisk winter breeze; his pink lips, slightly pursed, in their natural state of a pout. All this makes up the man you love. All this, and <i>so</i> much more that will never be perceptible to the untrained eye. But you, <i>you</i> could always see beyond the fa\u00e7ade, glimpse the man behind the mask. A man afraid of loss, of rejection and, most of all, of his own shortcomings. </p><p>\u201cFor now, let\u2019s just be us,\u201d you whisper as you get up on your tiptoes and let go of Yoongi\u2019s hands to cup his cheeks with your palms. \u201cBecause, whatever we are, it\u2019s <i>good</i>.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Yoongi says, slowly nodding his head, his voice low and his gaze so intense, you can feel your soul melting away, running towards him. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I ever told you this.\u201d Now, his arms close around your waist, pulling you to his chest. \"But I\u2019ve never felt this safe with anybody else before, Y/n. And it\u2019s <i>scary</i>. <i>Hella</i> scary. And with all the distance, I just \u2013 I got in my head. And I know I\u2019m not always easy. And heaven knows I\u2019ve made things harder on us than they should have been. This relationship was work from its very beginning. And I blamed it on my profession. The truth, however, is that I was making <i>excuses</i>. Because I was scared <i>shitless</i>. Afraid of allowing this to grow, of getting hurt. <i>Again</i>. So I wanted to take the easy way out before it would be too late, actually having convinced myself that it would be what\u2019s best for <i>you</i>. But I was wrong. This is great, and you are the best thing that ever happened to me. Well, the best <i>person</i>, anyway. And I don\u2019t want to lose you, Y/n.\u201d </p><p>Smiling through tears, you wrap your arms around Yoongi\u2019s neck and draw yourself up to his height. </p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad you came to that conclusion.\u201d You rest your forehead against his. \"But what made you think I would have just let your bullshit <i>pass</i>, hmm?\u201d </p><p>Your words elicit a stifled laugh from him. </p><p>\u201cWhat? Did you actually believe I would have just let you go like this?\u201d You recline in his embrace to get a better look at his face. \u201cWell, Min Yoongi, brace yourself. Because I\u2019m not gonna let you fuck this up, you hear me? As long as there\u2019s still some life left in this relationship, I\u2019m gonna fight for us. So, get ready to get bruised.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBrave words for a girl that bruises like a peach.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI have sensitive skin. So what? Are you implying I\u2019m a weakling?\u201d </p><p>Without warning, you jump up to enclose Yoongi\u2019s waist with your legs. He stumbles backwards but manages to keep his balance.</p><p>\u201cI would <i>never</i> suggest anything of that sort,\u201d he then smiles. \u201cMy little fighter.\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>Little</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I mention you\u2019re adorable?\u201d Yoongi cooes, a smug smirk lingering on his rosy lips. </p><p>\u201cCut it out!\u201d you warn him. \u201cOr I\u2019m going to <i>punch</i> you \u2013\u201d</p><p>Slowly, you lower your face towards his. You\u2019re so close now, you can feel Yoongi\u2019s warm breath brushing past your skin. </p><p>\u201c\u2013 in the <i>mouth</i> with my <i>own</i> mouth, <i>softly</i>. Because I love you. And I\u2019ve been wanting to kiss you for months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo shut up and <i>do</i> it already.\u201d </p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"251\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"jjungcooks:rhsQaa-P2v0wCqEDHsk54A:Z83DUe2ZNHbhX\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8e007186ff0d541e522ce0aa3d420a84/tumblr_pb5e4anlA11w73e04o1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"251\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"1494\" data-orig-height=\"11\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/768411c134657b8af4566b0ca3c1156e/tumblr_inline_pppgkxQt2u1vslk3d_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1494\" data-orig-height=\"11\"></figure><p>I know I haven\u2019t posted writing in a while, so I really hope you enjoyed this.\u00a0</p><p><i>Much love, Ana</i> \ud83d\udc96</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1494\" data-orig-height=\"11\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/768411c134657b8af4566b0ca3c1156e/tumblr_inline_pppglc2gC41vslk3d_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1494\" data-orig-height=\"11\"></figure><p><i>None of the GIFs used are mine.

Quickly, you slip into your shoes and follow him, making sure not to run to preserve at least <i>some</i> of your dignity. </p><p>Seriously, who does he think he <i>is</i>? Only messaging you one day ahead, letting you know that you <i>have</i> to meet, not even inquiring whether or not the chosen time and place would even be <i>convenient</i> for you. As if you have nothing better to do than sit around and wait for him all day when he rarely ever deemed it necessary to call you \u2013 or pick up <i>your</i> calls \u2013 these past few months. </p><p>\u201cYoongi, wait!\u201d you call after him, struggling to keep up with his smart pace once you are out in the street, only now realizing that you left your jacket hanging by your door, having been completely thrown off by Yoongi\u2019s baffling behavior. </p><p>But he doesn\u2019t even slow down for a second. Both hands buried in his jacket pockets, black hood and baseball cap drawn deep down into his face, concealing it from your view, Yoongi keeps striding on, even mending his pace. Until he stops cold in his step and turns around, so unexpectedly you collide with his toned chest. </p><p>\u201cWhat the <i>hell</i>, Yoongi!?\u201d </p><p>\"I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he mutters, avoiding your gaze as he gently grabs you by your elbows to hold you at arm\u2019s length. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I thought I could do this, but I can\u2019t.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDo <i>what</i>, Yoongi? You\u2019re starting to freak me out.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThen stop <i>apologizing</i> and tell me what the hell is going on!\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m \u2013 I don\u2019t <i>know</i>. Could we maybe just take a walk for now?\u201d </p><p>You know Yoongi well enough to recognize the fear in his eyes. No. Not just <i>fear</i>. Sheer <i>panic</i>. </p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d you nod. \u201cOkay. Let\u2019s walk.\u201c </p><p>And so you do. Walk. In perfect silence for minutes on end, side by side, each occupied with your own thoughts as you wander through the empty back streets of Seoul under the setting sun, circling your block a good half a dozen times before Yoongi looks at you for the first time. You feign ignorance, but you can feel his gaze settling on your side profile. </p><p>\"Y/n. You\u2019re only wearing a sweatshirt,\u201d he suddenly remarks, slowing down. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cold, you should take my jacket,\u201c he then states, already taking off his coat.</p><p>\"And then <i>what</i>?\u201d you scoff, coming to a halt a few feet ahead of him. \u201cThen <i>you\u2019ll</i> be cold. What good will that do? Your voice is worth millions, as I recall it. Do you really think I can afford to get you sick? Besides, I\u2019m fine. And it\u2019s my fault, after all. <i>I</i> left my jacket. I should have been ready when you came to pick me up. And it\u2019s not like this is the first time I\u2019m cold. I can deal. I\u2019m no damsel in distress.\u201c </p><p>Your head held up high, you turn back around and continue walking. To your surprise, however, you can hear a low chuckle coming from behind you where Yoongi is still standing, unmoving. </p><p>\u201d<i>What</i>?\u201c you demand to know the cause for his amusement.</p><p>\"I just forgot how stubborn you are, that\u2019s all,\u201d he grins, his expression strangely affectionate, considering the previous course of this meeting. \"You\u2019re so adorable when you get angry.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not <i>angry</i>,\u201d you groan. </p><p>\u201cYes, you are. At yourself. For being such a dumbass.\u201d </p><p>At this point, he\u2019s just asking for trouble. When you turn back towards him, Yoongi\u2019s eyes are sparkling with mischief, peeking at you out from under the brim of his cap. </p><p>\u201cOh, <i>really</i>?\u201d you wonder, slowly meandering towards him, head tilted to one side, eying him intently. Still smiling, Yoongi mirrors your gesture, licking his lips, getting ready to play. \u201cSo, you can see right through me, huh?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes, I <i>can</i>,\u201d he boldly states, not even hesitating for a second. </p><p>\u201cWell, then I\u2019m clearly at a disadvantage here. Because I can\u2019t figure out what the hell is going on here, Yoongi.\u201d Standing in front of him now, you pause, the tension between your bodies palpable, the silence so heavy you could cut it with a knife. \u201cAnd what the <i>fuck</i> you want from me.\u201d </p><p>Suddenly, Yoongi\u2019s glance darkens, a cold shadow falling over his soft features. </p><p>\u201cInitially, I came here to \u2013\u201d He can\u2019t seem to bring himself to finish the sentence. </p><p>\u201cTo <i>break up</i> with me,\u201d you do it for him. </p><p> His eyes grow wide with surprise. </p><p>\u201cYou <i>knew</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a feeling.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI see. That\u2019s something I always admired about you, you know. Your intuition. Your empathy. I think those are fairly attractive qualities.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo <i>what</i>?\u201d he echoes.</p><p>\u201cWhy <i>didn\u2019t</i> you? Break up with me? Or \u2013 Are you \u2013\u201c</p><p>\"No,\u201d he shakes his head. \u201cOh, no. I\u2019m not gonna break up with you, Y/n. Not <i>today</i>, anyway.\u201d He pauses. \u201cCome to think of it, I don\u2019t particularly like today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, me neither,\u201d you agree, reaching out to take Yoongi\u2019s cold hands into your own, your gaze still locked with his as your heart is overflowing with relief. \u201cI mean, wouldn\u2019t it be a terribly <i>cold</i> day to kill our love? So grey and dreary? Let\u2019s wait till spring, maybe, when it\u2019s warmer, and the cherry trees are in full bloom, and break up then, if you still want to. Until then, let\u2019s agree not to make any rash decisions. Instead, let\u2019s just see how we feel about us <i>then</i>, and keep this up for a little while longer. Because I have a feeling, we\u2019d be fools for giving up now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, fools, indeed.\u201d </p><p>For a few seconds, you merely look at Yoongi, drinking up the familiar sight of his features. His feline eyes with their brown orbs, deep and dark like infinite wells of pain, wisdom, loneliness, and immeasurable beauty; the softly rounded tip of his nose, reddened by the brisk winter breeze; his pink lips, slightly pursed, in their natural state of a pout. All this makes up the man you love. All this, and <i>so</i> much more that will never be perceptible to the untrained eye. But you, <i>you</i> could always see beyond the fa\u00e7ade, glimpse the man behind the mask. A man afraid of loss, of rejection and, most of all, of his own shortcomings. </p><p>\u201cFor now, let\u2019s just be us,\u201d you whisper as you get up on your tiptoes and let go of Yoongi\u2019s hands to cup his cheeks with your palms. \u201cBecause, whatever we are, it\u2019s <i>good</i>.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Yoongi says, slowly nodding his head, his voice low and his gaze so intense, you can feel your soul melting away, running towards him. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I ever told you this.\u201d Now, his arms close around your waist, pulling you to his chest. \"But I\u2019ve never felt this safe with anybody else before, Y/n. And it\u2019s <i>scary</i>. <i>Hella</i> scary. And with all the distance, I just \u2013 I got in my head. And I know I\u2019m not always easy. And heaven knows I\u2019ve made things harder on us than they should have been. This relationship was work from its very beginning. And I blamed it on my profession. The truth, however, is that I was making <i>excuses</i>. Because I was scared <i>shitless</i>. Afraid of allowing this to grow, of getting hurt. <i>Again</i>. So I wanted to take the easy way out before it would be too late, actually having convinced myself that it would be what\u2019s best for <i>you</i>. But I was wrong. This is great, and you are the best thing that ever happened to me. Well, the best <i>person</i>, anyway. And I don\u2019t want to lose you, Y/n.\u201d </p><p>Smiling through tears, you wrap your arms around Yoongi\u2019s neck and draw yourself up to his height. </p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad you came to that conclusion.\u201d You rest your forehead against his. \"But what made you think I would have just let your bullshit <i>pass</i>, hmm?\u201d </p><p>Your words elicit a stifled laugh from him. </p><p>\u201cWhat? Did you actually believe I would have just let you go like this?\u201d You recline in his embrace to get a better look at his face. \u201cWell, Min Yoongi, brace yourself. Because I\u2019m not gonna let you fuck this up, you hear me? As long as there\u2019s still some life left in this relationship, I\u2019m gonna fight for us. So, get ready to get bruised.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBrave words for a girl that bruises like a peach.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI have sensitive skin. So what? Are you implying I\u2019m a weakling?\u201d </p><p>Without warning, you jump up to enclose Yoongi\u2019s waist with your legs. He stumbles backwards but manages to keep his balance.</p><p>\u201cI would <i>never</i> suggest anything of that sort,\u201d he then smiles. \u201cMy little fighter.\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>Little</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I mention you\u2019re adorable?\u201d Yoongi cooes, a smug smirk lingering on his rosy lips. </p><p>\u201cCut it out!\u201d you warn him. \u201cOr I\u2019m going to <i>punch</i> you \u2013\u201d</p><p>Slowly, you lower your face towards his.

So I wanted to take the easy way out before it would be too late, actually having convinced myself that it would be what&rsquo;s best for <i>you</i>. But I was wrong. This is great, and you are the best thing that ever happened to me. Well, the best <i>person</i>, anyway.

Did you actually believe I would have just let you go like this?&rdquo; You recline in his embrace to get a better look at his face. &ldquo;Well, Min Yoongi, brace yourself. Because I&rsquo;m not gonna let you fuck this up, you hear me? As long as there&rsquo;s still some life left in this relationship, I&rsquo;m gonna fight for us. So, get ready to get bruised.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Brave words for a girl that bruises like a peach.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I have sensitive skin. So what? Are you implying I&rsquo;m a weakling?&rdquo; </p><p>Without warning, you jump up to enclose Yoongi&rsquo;s waist with your legs. He stumbles backwards but manages to keep his balance.</p><p>&ldquo;I would <i>never</i> suggest anything of that sort,&rdquo; he then smiles. &ldquo;My little fighter.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Little</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did I mention you&rsquo;re adorable?&rdquo; Yoongi cooes, a smug smirk lingering on his rosy lips. </p><p>&ldquo;Cut it out!&rdquo; you warn him. &ldquo;Or I&rsquo;m going to <i>punch</i> you &ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>Slowly, you lower your face towards his. You&rsquo;re so close now, you can feel Yoongi&rsquo;s warm breath brushing past your skin. </p><p>&ldquo;&ndash; in the <i>mouth</i> with my <i>own</i> mouth, <i>softly</i>. Because I love you.

My parents were able to send most of my belongings within a few days and thanks to Jackson who helped me lift all my boxes of clothes and my computer etc. the move went really fast.</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m going to have to ask you to pay rent soon since you basically live here\u201d I say as I plop myself onto the kitchen isle.<br/></p><p>\u201cYea and you know I basically pay rent since I buy and cook food for you\u201d Jackson says as he opens the fridge and grabs a few eggs.<br/></p><p>\u201cFine&hellip;\u201d I say as I rip open a pack of cookies he just bought.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t take this the wrong way, cause I love having you over, but why do you hang out here so much?\u201d I quickly continue to make sure I don\u2019t offend him,\u00a0\u201cI mean I\u2019m sure your apartment is a lot nicer than this one&hellip;\u201d</p><p>He tilts his head and stays quiet for a while. Silence between us isn\u2019t awkward, it\u2019s actually never been awkward either. Since we\u2019ve been hanging out almost constantly for the past few days he feels like an old friend.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just happy to not be alone\u201d he finally says as he puts a fried egg on top of the beautifully made bibimbap that he whipped up on my request.\u00a0\u201cmy apartment <i>is</i> a lot nicer than yours,\u201d he smirks as he hands me the bowl,\u00a0\u201cbut it also gets really lonely.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you have people over then?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cCause the small amount of friends I do have are either not in Shanghai, way too busy or both\u201d He says as he starts to dig in,\u00a0\u201cAnd I\u2019m trying to hang out with you as much as possible before that happens to you aswell. Now eat\u201d<br/></p><p>I don\u2019t really know what to say, so I just stuff my face instead. Halfway through our meal my phone starts to ring, it\u2019s Kris.</p><p>\u201cHey\u201d I pick up.<br/></p><p>\u201cHey, can you come to the studio today? Me and Louis have been brainstorming all week and we think we know how to get your name out there\u201d He says exitedly.<br/></p><p>\u201cUmm, wow ok yea totally, you mean today as in now?\u201d I answer looking at Jackson for approval. It feels a little weird to just leave after he basically told me all his friends except me are super busy all the time.\u00a0</p><p>He smiles warmly and nods,\u00a0\u201cGo\u201d.</p><p>\u201cYea as soon as possible!\u201d I hear Louis say in the backgroud.<br/></p><p>\u201cOk I\u2019m on my way!\u201d I shove the last bit of food in my mouth and run around gathering my keys, wallet and headphones. I stumble and fall as I put my shoes on and Jackson just laughs at me, still eating in peace.<br/></p><p>\u201cWish me luck! Don\u2019t forget to lock the door when you leave!\u201d I remind Jackson and close the door behind me.</p><p>Arriving at the building where the studio is located I see the same receptionist who was a bitch to me and Jess when we were here last. Reluctantly I walk up to the desk, not looking forward to her attitude and definitaly not her ruining a most likely very special day.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe 41 floo-\u201d I get interrupted by her and the two other receptionist standing up and bowing.\u00a0\u201cfloor&hellip;?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cGood afternoon miss, the elevator is here in a few seconds\u201d she says politely, her hand gesturing to the elevators as a guard opens the gate.<br/></p><p>Her kindness surprises me and all I can respond is a mumbled\u00a0\u201cT- Thank you\u201d as I move on the the elevators.</p><p>Reaching the 41st floor, Kris\u2019 labels offices and studios, I greet the\u00a0receptionist and walk down the hallway to studio 1, knocking before I enter. Kris and Louis are sitting by the mixing board, their backs facing me, working on some song I\u2019ve never heard before. I guess they didn\u2019t notice me coming in with the loud music playing. I walk up right behind them and watch what they\u2019re doing.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice\u201d I say as the music stops.<br/></p><p>They both jump off their seats, \u201cWhat th- You scared the living shit out of me!\u201d Kris says as Louis holds his chest and breathes out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry but I had to!\u201d I laugh as I replay their terrified faces in my head.<br/></p><p>\u201cAnyways&hellip;\u201d Kris sits back down,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m glad you like it cause it\u2019s for you!\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWell I thought R&amp;B and jazz would go great with your voice so Louis whipped up some samples.\u201d Kris says as he started to play another song.</p><p>The beats are absolutely incredible, super detailed and high quality. The music fills my head and I get the same feeling as the first time I ever sung in this studio. I close my eyes and the humming just escapes me.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cRecord\u201d Kris says quietly as Louis picks his phone up and starts to record.<br/></p><p>After 40 seconds or so the sample ends and I snap back to reality.</p><p>\u201cI think you just made your first song\u201d Kris chuckles,\u00a0\u201cThat was suprisingly easy&hellip; and fast\u201d<br/></p><p>Louis just stares at me memerized.\u00a0\u201cAnd that just&hellip; comes to you? Like naturally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm&hellip; It\u2019s more like an urge to let it out. I don\u2019t think about it, I just sing whatever feels good\u201d</p><p>Louis nods wide-eyed and turns back to the monitors.\u00a0\u201cWell we can listen to some more samples and the ones you like we can make into full songs. You write music too?</p><p>\u201cYea\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWell damn, then we can get started already tonight, everything we need is in this studio!\u201d Louis claps his hands together in exitement.<br/></p><p>\u201cNow for promoting, I have some ideas\u201d Kris says as he pulls me to the large couch on the other side of the room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fiming a music video for my new song in two days and I thought maybe you could be in it?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAre you serious??\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWe needed to cast a girl anyways and I thought this would be a great teaser for you. We could keep your identity unknown and have people curious about who you are, then right before we release your song we make sure your face is everywhere so everybody is talking about\u00a0\u2018the mystery girl\u2019 you know?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI love that\u201d I say so exited I can\u2019t sit still.<br/></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll also try to get some famous music people in Asia to post your face on their social media\u201d He says as he start to look for something in the pile of papers on the table.</p><p>Well I know atleast one person who\u2019d help out with that, I think to myself.</p><p>\u201cSo these are some concept pictures my director sent me\u201d Kris says as he shows me some printed photos. One picture shows a foggy room lit up with a bunch of purple neon lights on the wall, another a white 1966 mustang convertible on a lavender field, the third picture a pool lit up purple with pink rosepetals and glitter on the surface.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing the theme is purple?\u201d I chuckle,\u00a0\u201cAre these like photos for inspiration or&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo they are all taken from the set\u201d He answers as he shows me even more aesthetic scenery.\u00a0\u201cThese are going to be backgrounds in the video\u201d<br/></p><p>I almost choke, and I thought they were photoshopped or taken from Instagram or something.</p><p>\u201cYour telling me you\u2019ll be in a lavenderfield in a 1966 mustang\u201d I blink at Kris.<br/></p><p>\u201cIf you agree you\u2019ll be there too\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m totally down.\u201d I say as I keep looking through the pictures, in awe that some of these places even exist.</p><p>Kris and I start talking more in detail about the music video and how they are going to promote me to the world and later all three of us start to work on music. I pick the samples I like the most and as Kris and Louis start to mess around with the beat I write a few test verses.</p><p>A few hours pass and we order dinner to eat while we work, same thing when the clock strikes 12 and Louis demands a midnight snack. Time flies by and we\u2019ve somehow managed to lay down the basic structure of three different songs.</p><p>\u201cGuys I think it\u2019s time we go home and sleep\u201d Kris yawns.<br/></p><p>I look at my phone, 4am&hellip; I didn\u2019t really notice how tired I was until Kris started yawning like crazy next to me.</p><p>\u201cYea I could use some sleep&hellip;\u201d I yawn back.<br/></p><p>\u201cOh come on guys we just got the flow!\u201d Louis protests, having just as much energy as 12 hours ago.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWe can continue tomorrow\u201d Kris stands up an grabs his jacket.\u00a0\u201c(Y/N) you need a ride?\u201d<br/></p><p>My apartment is actually a 20 minute walk away, like Kevin said it has a crazy convenient location, but I\u2019m not sure I want to walk 20 minutes alone at 4am in the morning.</p><p>\u201cYes please\u201d I stand up as well to get my things.<br/></p><p>Louis throws a little hissyfit about us ruining\u00a0\u201cthe flow\u201d but soon gives up and follow us out and down to the garage. I\u2019m not surprised to see a bunch of fancy and expensive cars when the elevator doors open. I follow Kris and Louis to an area where the spots are reserved and Kris starts walking toward a beautiful silver Porsche.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWow&hellip;\u201d I\u2019ve loved Porsches ever since I was a little girl. My dad enjoys racing, and with his favorite car being Porches, it automatically becamee mine aswell.\u00a0\u201cMy dream car is a 911 Carrera\u201d I say as I walk around the car in awe.<br/></p><p>\u201cWell sadly this is just a Turbo\u201d Kris unlocks the car.<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>Just a Turbo</i>\u201d Louis mocks and unlocks the car beside it, a black Maserati GranTurismo.<br/></p><p>\u201cYour kidding\u201d I can\u2019t help but gawk over that car aswell.<br/></p><p>\u201cNow if you\u2019d rather ride with me you could.\u201d Louis smirks at me and then Kris.</p><p>\u201cSorry Louis but this baby always comes first\u201d I chuckle.<br/></p><p>\u201cAww~\u201d Kris puts his hand on his chest.<br/></p><p>\u201cShe meant the car\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cUh, I- I know\u201d Kris tries to save himself but fails completely.\u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s just go\u201d He opens the car door for me like a gentleman, then gets in himself.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so tired I feel like I could fall asleep anywhere\u201d Kris says as he starts the car and start to drive.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t?\u201d I hold onto the roof handle,\u00a0\u201cI want to live\u201d<br/></p><p>Kris laughs and starts to speed down the road,\u00a0 thankfully the roads are totally empty, there\u2019s not a soul for miles. He managed to get me from the studio to my apartment complex in three minutes, probably could\u2019ve gone faster if it weren\u2019t for a red light.</p><p>\u201cWan\u2019t me to escort you up?\u201d Kris says as he stops right outside the doors to my buildning<br/></p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll manage\u201d I laugh and open the\u00a0 car door to get out.<br/></p><p>\u201cBe at the studio tomorrow at 12, k?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYes sir\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>I close the car door behind me and hear him speed off again as I enter the building. I was longing for my bed which made the elevator ride feel like a million years. So close but yet so far&hellip; After an agonizing minute I finally reached my floor. While trying to unlock my front door I notice that it\u2019s unlocked.</p><p>\u201cDamn it Jackson\u201d I say quietly to myself. The one thing I asked him to do was to lock the door when he left. This is so unsafe!<br/></p><p>I open the door, happy to see that I haven\u2019t been burglurized, and walk in. I take off my shoes and jacket and go straight to the bedroom, ready to just fall onto the bed and sleep.\u00a0</p><p>To my surprise, I find a grown man on my bed.\u00a0</p><p>I sigh, I\u2019m exhausted and all I want is to just bury myself in my fluffy duvet, but I can\u2019t help smiling at how peaceful Jackson looks. Not wanting to disturb him I grab a pillow from the bed and occupy the couch instead. Thankfully I\u2019m way too tired to care about it not being the most comfy and slowly but surely drift off into dreamland.</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cRise and shine you sloth\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cHmpf\u201d I roll over. For a split second I think that I\u2019m about to roll off the couch, but I\u2019m actually met with more soft surface. I open my eyes slowly, annoyed by the light coming through the windows.</p><p>\u201cDid you move me to the bed?\u201d I ask Jackson who hands me my black fluffy robe.<br/></p><p>\u201cYea I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t wake up, I might have banged your head against the doorframe\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cSeriously?!\u201d I touch my head to feel for a bumb or bruise.<br/></p><p>Jackson laughs.\u00a0\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>I shiver as I feel the cold breeze from the air-con hit my skin and put my robe on. After,\u00a0 wrapping myself in a nearby blanket.</p><p>\u201cCold?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cNo kidding&hellip;\u201d I press the off button on the air-con controller.<br/></p><p>\u201cLucky for you I made soup\u201d Jackson skips out happily into the kitchen.<br/></p><p>As if on queue the smell of chicken soup hits my nose.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s basically lunch since it\u2019s 1am but you came back so late I thought I\u2019d let you sleep\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cThanks\u201d I smile and pat his shoulder, grabbing a bowl.\u00a0\u201cI must say I was surprised to see you sleeping in my bed this morning\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cSorry&hellip;\u201d he said looking flustered,\u00a0\u201cI had a rough night yesterday so I really didn\u2019t feel like going back to my apartment&hellip; Sorry for stealing your bed.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ok\u201d Now I feel quilty for questioning him. Obviously I don\u2019t have anything against Jackson Wang sleeping in my apartment, I was just curious as to why.\u00a0\u201cIs it something you want to talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really\u201d He said, eyes fixed on his bowl of soup. \u201cI want to but-\u201d He stopped himself from saying more,\u00a0\u201cNah forget it.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean you want to?\u201d I couldn\u2019t help myself.\u00a0</p><p>He sighed, put his spoon down and held his head in his hands.\u00a0\u201cI want to talk about it but I can\u2019t.\u201d He mumbles , so quiet I can barely hear him.</p><p>My phone starts buzzing and the screen shows that Kris is calling. SHIT I was suppose to be at the studio an hour ago! I peek at Jackson who looks as distressed as ever. I can\u2019t just leave him like this?</p><p>\u201cHey Kris&hellip;\u201d I answer the phone. I ready myself for a tell-off but I\u2019m stunned when I hear him speak<br/></p><p>\u201cHeyy\u201d He answers with a deeper and raspier voice than usual. Damn I\u2019m a real sucker for guys and their morning voices.<br/></p><p>\u201cJust woke up too huh?\u201d I say and I can\u2019t help but blush as he speaks.<br/></p><p>\u201cYea&hellip; 12 was wishful thinking. How about we grab dinner tonight and go to the studio after?\u201d I hear him yawn.<br/></p><p>\u201cSounds good, text me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do\u201d</p><p>We hang up and Jackson still has his head down. It\u2019s obvious that the boy needs someone to talk to.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou can go I\u2019ll be fine&hellip;\u201d He says as mumbly and quiet as before.<br/></p><p>\u201cJackson I\u2019m not going until you talk to me.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get it, I can\u2019t\u201d He says a little louder this time.<br/></p><p>\u201cWell then atleast eat.\u201d I push his bowl toward him.\u00a0\u201cOr do I need to feed you?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t respond but with a little grunt he picks his spoon back up and starts to eat.</p><p>We sit in silence until he\u2019s finished. The frustrated look on his face doesn\u2019t disappear but as time passes it starts to look more sad. When we\u2019re both done he stands up and takes our bowls to the sink. I however move to the couch where I wrap myself in yet another blanket.</p><p>\u201cAre you still cold?\u201d Jackson asks.<br/></p><p>\u201cNo\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWhy the blankets then?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m settling into the couch, cause I have a feeling <i>we </i>are going to be here for a while\u201d I say as I pat the space beside me on the couch.<br/></p><p>Jackson sighs again.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re not going to let this go are you?\u201d.</p><p>I shake my head and pat the couch again.</p><p>He walks over and plops down beside me.\u00a0\u201cYou have to promise me to not tell anybody.\u201d He looks me dead in the eyes, more serious than I\u2019ve ever seen him before.</p><p>\u201cOk&hellip;\u201d I say, now afraid of what\u2019s to come.<br/></p><p>\u201cSay that you promise!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI promise\u201d<br/></p><p>He takes a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about my girlfriend.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>Girlfriend?!</i>\u201d<br/></p>",

Since we\u2019ve been hanging out almost constantly for the past few days he feels like an old friend.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just happy to not be alone\u201d he finally says as he puts a fried egg on top of the beautifully made bibimbap that he whipped up on my request.\u00a0\u201cmy apartment <i>is</i> a lot nicer than yours,\u201d he smirks as he hands me the bowl,\u00a0\u201cbut it also gets really lonely.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you have people over then?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cCause the small amount of friends I do have are either not in Shanghai, way too busy or both\u201d He says as he starts to dig in,\u00a0\u201cAnd I\u2019m trying to hang out with you as much as possible before that happens to you aswell. Now eat\u201d<br></p><p>I don\u2019t really know what to say, so I just stuff my face instead. Halfway through our meal my phone starts to ring, it\u2019s Kris.</p><p>\u201cHey\u201d I pick up.<br></p><p>\u201cHey, can you come to the studio today? Me and Louis have been brainstorming all week and we think we know how to get your name out there\u201d He says exitedly.<br></p><p>\u201cUmm, wow ok yea totally, you mean today as in now?\u201d I answer looking at Jackson for approval. It feels a little weird to just leave after he basically told me all his friends except me are super busy all the time.\u00a0</p><p>He smiles warmly and nods,\u00a0\u201cGo\u201d.</p><p>\u201cYea as soon as possible!\u201d I hear Louis say in the backgroud.<br></p><p>\u201cOk I\u2019m on my way!\u201d I shove the last bit of food in my mouth and run around gathering my keys, wallet and headphones. I stumble and fall as I put my shoes on and Jackson just laughs at me, still eating in peace.<br></p><p>\u201cWish me luck! Don\u2019t forget to lock the door when you leave!\u201d I remind Jackson and close the door behind me.</p><p>Arriving at the building where the studio is located I see the same receptionist who was a bitch to me and Jess when we were here last. Reluctantly I walk up to the desk, not looking forward to her attitude and definitaly not her ruining a most likely very special day.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe 41 floo-\u201d I get interrupted by her and the two other receptionist standing up and bowing.\u00a0\u201cfloor\u2026?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cGood afternoon miss, the elevator is here in a few seconds\u201d she says politely, her hand gesturing to the elevators as a guard opens the gate.<br></p><p>Her kindness surprises me and all I can respond is a mumbled\u00a0\u201cT- Thank you\u201d as I move on the the elevators.</p><p>Reaching the 41st floor, Kris\u2019 labels offices and studios, I greet the\u00a0receptionist and walk down the hallway to studio 1, knocking before I enter. Kris and Louis are sitting by the mixing board, their backs facing me, working on some song I\u2019ve never heard before. I guess they didn\u2019t notice me coming in with the loud music playing. I walk up right behind them and watch what they\u2019re doing.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice\u201d I say as the music stops.<br></p><p>They both jump off their seats, \u201cWhat th- You scared the living shit out of me!\u201d Kris says as Louis holds his chest and breathes out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry but I had to!\u201d I laugh as I replay their terrified faces in my head.<br></p><p>\u201cAnyways\u2026\u201d Kris sits back down,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m glad you like it cause it\u2019s for you!\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWell I thought R&amp;B and jazz would go great with your voice so Louis whipped up some samples.\u201d Kris says as he started to play another song.</p><p>The beats are absolutely incredible, super detailed and high quality. The music fills my head and I get the same feeling as the first time I ever sung in this studio. I close my eyes and the humming just escapes me.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cRecord\u201d Kris says quietly as Louis picks his phone up and starts to record.<br></p><p>After 40 seconds or so the sample ends and I snap back to reality.</p><p>\u201cI think you just made your first song\u201d Kris chuckles,\u00a0\u201cThat was suprisingly easy\u2026 and fast\u201d<br></p><p>Louis just stares at me memerized.\u00a0\u201cAnd that just\u2026 comes to you? Like naturally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm\u2026 It\u2019s more like an urge to let it out. I don\u2019t think about it, I just sing whatever feels good\u201d</p><p>Louis nods wide-eyed and turns back to the monitors.\u00a0\u201cWell we can listen to some more samples and the ones you like we can make into full songs. You write music too?</p><p>\u201cYea\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWell damn, then we can get started already tonight, everything we need is in this studio!\u201d Louis claps his hands together in exitement.<br></p><p>\u201cNow for promoting, I have some ideas\u201d Kris says as he pulls me to the large couch on the other side of the room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fiming a music video for my new song in two days and I thought maybe you could be in it?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAre you serious??\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWe needed to cast a girl anyways and I thought this would be a great teaser for you. We could keep your identity unknown and have people curious about who you are, then right before we release your song we make sure your face is everywhere so everybody is talking about\u00a0\u2018the mystery girl\u2019 you know?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI love that\u201d I say so exited I can\u2019t sit still.<br></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll also try to get some famous music people in Asia to post your face on their social media\u201d He says as he start to look for something in the pile of papers on the table.</p><p>Well I know atleast one person who\u2019d help out with that, I think to myself.</p><p>\u201cSo these are some concept pictures my director sent me\u201d Kris says as he shows me some printed photos. One picture shows a foggy room lit up with a bunch of purple neon lights on the wall, another a white 1966 mustang convertible on a lavender field, the third picture a pool lit up purple with pink rosepetals and glitter on the surface.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing the theme is purple?\u201d I chuckle,\u00a0\u201cAre these like photos for inspiration or\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo they are all taken from the set\u201d He answers as he shows me even more aesthetic scenery.\u00a0\u201cThese are going to be backgrounds in the video\u201d<br></p><p>I almost choke, and I thought they were photoshopped or taken from Instagram or something.</p><p>\u201cYour telling me you\u2019ll be in a lavenderfield in a 1966 mustang\u201d I blink at Kris.<br></p><p>\u201cIf you agree you\u2019ll be there too\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m totally down.\u201d I say as I keep looking through the pictures, in awe that some of these places even exist.</p><p>Kris and I start talking more in detail about the music video and how they are going to promote me to the world and later all three of us start to work on music. I pick the samples I like the most and as Kris and Louis start to mess around with the beat I write a few test verses.</p><p>A few hours pass and we order dinner to eat while we work, same thing when the clock strikes 12 and Louis demands a midnight snack. Time flies by and we\u2019ve somehow managed to lay down the basic structure of three different songs.</p><p>\u201cGuys I think it\u2019s time we go home and sleep\u201d Kris yawns.<br></p><p>I look at my phone, 4am\u2026 I didn\u2019t really notice how tired I was until Kris started yawning like crazy next to me.</p><p>\u201cYea I could use some sleep\u2026\u201d I yawn back.<br></p><p>\u201cOh come on guys we just got the flow!\u201d Louis protests, having just as much energy as 12 hours ago.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWe can continue tomorrow\u201d Kris stands up an grabs his jacket.\u00a0\u201c(Y/N) you need a ride?\u201d<br></p><p>My apartment is actually a 20 minute walk away, like Kevin said it has a crazy convenient location, but I\u2019m not sure I want to walk 20 minutes alone at 4am in the morning.</p><p>\u201cYes please\u201d I stand up as well to get my things.<br></p><p>Louis throws a little hissyfit about us ruining\u00a0\u201cthe flow\u201d but soon gives up and follow us out and down to the garage. I\u2019m not surprised to see a bunch of fancy and expensive cars when the elevator doors open. I follow Kris and Louis to an area where the spots are reserved and Kris starts walking toward a beautiful silver Porsche.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWow\u2026\u201d I\u2019ve loved Porsches ever since I was a little girl. My dad enjoys racing, and with his favorite car being Porches, it automatically becamee mine aswell.\u00a0\u201cMy dream car is a 911 Carrera\u201d I say as I walk around the car in awe.<br></p><p>\u201cWell sadly this is just a Turbo\u201d Kris unlocks the car.<br></p><p>\u201c<i>Just a Turbo</i>\u201d Louis mocks and unlocks the car beside it, a black Maserati GranTurismo.<br></p><p>\u201cYour kidding\u201d I can\u2019t help but gawk over that car aswell.<br></p><p>\u201cNow if you\u2019d rather ride with me you could.\u201d Louis smirks at me and then Kris.</p><p>\u201cSorry Louis but this baby always comes first\u201d I chuckle.<br></p><p>\u201cAww~\u201d Kris puts his hand on his chest.<br></p><p>\u201cShe meant the car\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cUh, I- I know\u201d Kris tries to save himself but fails completely.\u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s just go\u201d He opens the car door for me like a gentleman, then gets in himself.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so tired I feel like I could fall asleep anywhere\u201d Kris says as he starts the car and start to drive.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t?\u201d I hold onto the roof handle,\u00a0\u201cI want to live\u201d<br></p><p>Kris laughs and starts to speed down the road,\u00a0 thankfully the roads are totally empty, there\u2019s not a soul for miles. He managed to get me from the studio to my apartment complex in three minutes, probably could\u2019ve gone faster if it weren\u2019t for a red light.</p><p>\u201cWan\u2019t me to escort you up?\u201d Kris says as he stops right outside the doors to my buildning<br></p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll manage\u201d I laugh and open the\u00a0 car door to get out.<br></p><p>\u201cBe at the studio tomorrow at 12, k?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYes sir\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>I close the car door behind me and hear him speed off again as I enter the building. I was longing for my bed which made the elevator ride feel like a million years. So close but yet so far\u2026 After an agonizing minute I finally reached my floor. While trying to unlock my front door I notice that it\u2019s unlocked.</p><p>\u201cDamn it Jackson\u201d I say quietly to myself. The one thing I asked him to do was to lock the door when he left. This is so unsafe!<br></p><p>I open the door, happy to see that I haven\u2019t been burglurized, and walk in. I take off my shoes and jacket and go straight to the bedroom, ready to just fall onto the bed and sleep.\u00a0</p><p>To my surprise, I find a grown man on my bed.\u00a0</p><p>I sigh, I\u2019m exhausted and all I want is to just bury myself in my fluffy duvet, but I can\u2019t help smiling at how peaceful Jackson looks. Not wanting to disturb him I grab a pillow from the bed and occupy the couch instead. Thankfully I\u2019m way too tired to care about it not being the most comfy and slowly but surely drift off into dreamland.</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cRise and shine you sloth\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHmpf\u201d I roll over. For a split second I think that I\u2019m about to roll off the couch, but I\u2019m actually met with more soft surface. I open my eyes slowly, annoyed by the light coming through the windows.</p><p>\u201cDid you move me to the bed?\u201d I ask Jackson who hands me my black fluffy robe.<br></p><p>\u201cYea I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t wake up, I might have banged your head against the doorframe\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cSeriously?!\u201d I touch my head to feel for a bumb or bruise.<br></p><p>Jackson laughs.\u00a0\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>I shiver as I feel the cold breeze from the air-con hit my skin and put my robe on. After,\u00a0 wrapping myself in a nearby blanket.</p><p>\u201cCold?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNo kidding\u2026\u201d I press the off button on the air-con controller.<br></p><p>\u201cLucky for you I made soup\u201d Jackson skips out happily into the kitchen.<br></p><p>As if on queue the smell of chicken soup hits my nose.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s basically lunch since it\u2019s 1am but you came back so late I thought I\u2019d let you sleep\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThanks\u201d I smile and pat his shoulder, grabbing a bowl.\u00a0\u201cI must say I was surprised to see you sleeping in my bed this morning\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSorry\u2026\u201d he said looking flustered,\u00a0\u201cI had a rough night yesterday so I really didn\u2019t feel like going back to my apartment\u2026 Sorry for stealing your bed.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ok\u201d Now I feel quilty for questioning him. Obviously I don\u2019t have anything against Jackson Wang sleeping in my apartment, I was just curious as to why.\u00a0\u201cIs it something you want to talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really\u201d He said, eyes fixed on his bowl of soup. \u201cI want to but-\u201d He stopped himself from saying more,\u00a0\u201cNah forget it.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean you want to?\u201d I couldn\u2019t help myself.\u00a0</p><p>He sighed, put his spoon down and held his head in his hands.\u00a0\u201cI want to talk about it but I can\u2019t.\u201d He mumbles , so quiet I can barely hear him.</p><p>My phone starts buzzing and the screen shows that Kris is calling. SHIT I was suppose to be at the studio an hour ago! I peek at Jackson who looks as distressed as ever. I can\u2019t just leave him like this?</p><p>\u201cHey Kris\u2026\u201d I answer the phone. I ready myself for a tell-off but I\u2019m stunned when I hear him speak<br></p><p>\u201cHeyy\u201d He answers with a deeper and raspier voice than usual. Damn I\u2019m a real sucker for guys and their morning voices.<br></p><p>\u201cJust woke up too huh?\u201d I say and I can\u2019t help but blush as he speaks.<br></p><p>\u201cYea\u2026 12 was wishful thinking. How about we grab dinner tonight and go to the studio after?\u201d I hear him yawn.<br></p><p>\u201cSounds good, text me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do\u201d</p><p>We hang up and Jackson still has his head down. It\u2019s obvious that the boy needs someone to talk to.<br></p><p>\u201cYou can go I\u2019ll be fine\u2026\u201d He says as mumbly and quiet as before.<br></p><p>\u201cJackson I\u2019m not going until you talk to me.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get it, I can\u2019t\u201d He says a little louder this time.<br></p><p>\u201cWell then atleast eat.\u201d I push his bowl toward him.\u00a0\u201cOr do I need to feed you?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t respond but with a little grunt he picks his spoon back up and starts to eat.</p><p>We sit in silence until he\u2019s finished. The frustrated look on his face doesn\u2019t disappear but as time passes it starts to look more sad. When we\u2019re both done he stands up and takes our bowls to the sink. I however move to the couch where I wrap myself in yet another blanket.</p><p>\u201cAre you still cold?\u201d Jackson asks.<br></p><p>\u201cNo\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhy the blankets then?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m settling into the couch, cause I have a feeling <i>we </i>are going to be here for a while\u201d I say as I pat the space beside me on the couch.<br></p><p>Jackson sighs again.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re not going to let this go are you?\u201d.</p><p>I shake my head and pat the couch again.</p><p>He walks over and plops down beside me.\u00a0\u201cYou have to promise me to not tell anybody.\u201d He looks me dead in the eyes, more serious than I\u2019ve ever seen him before.</p><p>\u201cOk\u2026\u201d I say, now afraid of what\u2019s to come.<br></p><p>\u201cSay that you promise!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI promise\u201d<br></p><p>He takes a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about my girlfriend.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201c<i>Girlfriend?!</i>\u201d<br></p></p>",

Since we\u2019ve been hanging out almost constantly for the past few days he feels like an old friend.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just happy to not be alone\u201d he finally says as he puts a fried egg on top of the beautifully made bibimbap that he whipped up on my request.\u00a0\u201cmy apartment <i>is</i> a lot nicer than yours,\u201d he smirks as he hands me the bowl,\u00a0\u201cbut it also gets really lonely.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you have people over then?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cCause the small amount of friends I do have are either not in Shanghai, way too busy or both\u201d He says as he starts to dig in,\u00a0\u201cAnd I\u2019m trying to hang out with you as much as possible before that happens to you aswell. Now eat\u201d<br></p><p>I don\u2019t really know what to say, so I just stuff my face instead. Halfway through our meal my phone starts to ring, it\u2019s Kris.</p><p>\u201cHey\u201d I pick up.<br></p><p>\u201cHey, can you come to the studio today? Me and Louis have been brainstorming all week and we think we know how to get your name out there\u201d He says exitedly.<br></p><p>\u201cUmm, wow ok yea totally, you mean today as in now?\u201d I answer looking at Jackson for approval.

I stumble and fall as I put my shoes on and Jackson just laughs at me, still eating in peace.<br></p><p>\u201cWish me luck! Don\u2019t forget to lock the door when you leave!\u201d I remind Jackson and close the door behind me.</p><p>Arriving at the building where the studio is located I see the same receptionist who was a bitch to me and Jess when we were here last. Reluctantly I walk up to the desk, not looking forward to her attitude and definitaly not her ruining a most likely very special day.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe 41 floo-\u201d I get interrupted by her and the two other receptionist standing up and bowing.\u00a0\u201cfloor\u2026?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cGood afternoon miss, the elevator is here in a few seconds\u201d she says politely, her hand gesturing to the elevators as a guard opens the gate.<br></p><p>Her kindness surprises me and all I can respond is a mumbled\u00a0\u201cT- Thank you\u201d as I move on the the elevators.</p><p>Reaching the 41st floor, Kris\u2019 labels offices and studios, I greet the\u00a0receptionist and walk down the hallway to studio 1, knocking before I enter. Kris and Louis are sitting by the mixing board, their backs facing me, working on some song I\u2019ve never heard before. I guess they didn\u2019t notice me coming in with the loud music playing. I walk up right behind them and watch what they\u2019re doing.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice\u201d I say as the music stops.<br></p><p>They both jump off their seats, \u201cWhat th- You scared the living shit out of me!\u201d Kris says as Louis holds his chest and breathes out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry but I had to!\u201d I laugh as I replay their terrified faces in my head.<br></p><p>\u201cAnyways\u2026\u201d Kris sits back down,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m glad you like it cause it\u2019s for you!\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWell I thought R&amp;B and jazz would go great with your voice so Louis whipped up some samples.\u201d Kris says as he started to play another song.</p><p>The beats are absolutely incredible, super detailed and high quality. The music fills my head and I get the same feeling as the first time I ever sung in this studio. I close my eyes and the humming just escapes me.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cRecord\u201d Kris says quietly as Louis picks his phone up and starts to record.<br></p><p>After 40 seconds or so the sample ends and I snap back to reality.</p><p>\u201cI think you just made your first song\u201d Kris chuckles,\u00a0\u201cThat was suprisingly easy\u2026 and fast\u201d<br></p><p>Louis just stares at me memerized.\u00a0\u201cAnd that just\u2026 comes to you? Like naturally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm\u2026 It\u2019s more like an urge to let it out. I don\u2019t think about it, I just sing whatever feels good\u201d</p><p>Louis nods wide-eyed and turns back to the monitors.\u00a0\u201cWell we can listen to some more samples and the ones you like we can make into full songs. You write music too?</p><p>\u201cYea\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWell damn, then we can get started already tonight, everything we need is in this studio!\u201d Louis claps his hands together in exitement.<br></p><p>\u201cNow for promoting, I have some ideas\u201d Kris says as he pulls me to the large couch on the other side of the room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fiming a music video for my new song in two days and I thought maybe you could be in it?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAre you serious??\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWe needed to cast a girl anyways and I thought this would be a great teaser for you. We could keep your identity unknown and have people curious about who you are, then right before we release your song we make sure your face is everywhere so everybody is talking about\u00a0\u2018the mystery girl\u2019 you know?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI love that\u201d I say so exited I can\u2019t sit still.<br></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll also try to get some famous music people in Asia to post your face on their social media\u201d He says as he start to look for something in the pile of papers on the table.</p><p>Well I know atleast one person who\u2019d help out with that, I think to myself.</p><p>\u201cSo these are some concept pictures my director sent me\u201d Kris says as he shows me some printed photos. One picture shows a foggy room lit up with a bunch of purple neon lights on the wall, another a white 1966 mustang convertible on a lavender field, the third picture a pool lit up purple with pink rosepetals and glitter on the surface.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing the theme is purple?\u201d I chuckle,\u00a0\u201cAre these like photos for inspiration or\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo they are all taken from the set\u201d He answers as he shows me even more aesthetic scenery.\u00a0\u201cThese are going to be backgrounds in the video\u201d<br></p><p>I almost choke, and I thought they were photoshopped or taken from Instagram or something.</p><p>\u201cYour telling me you\u2019ll be in a lavenderfield in a 1966 mustang\u201d I blink at Kris.<br></p><p>\u201cIf you agree you\u2019ll be there too\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m totally down.\u201d I say as I keep looking through the pictures, in awe that some of these places even exist.</p><p>Kris and I start talking more in detail about the music video and how they are going to promote me to the world and later all three of us start to work on music. I pick the samples I like the most and as Kris and Louis start to mess around with the beat I write a few test verses.</p><p>A few hours pass and we order dinner to eat while we work, same thing when the clock strikes 12 and Louis demands a midnight snack. Time flies by and we\u2019ve somehow managed to lay down the basic structure of three different songs.</p><p>\u201cGuys I think it\u2019s time we go home and sleep\u201d Kris yawns.<br></p><p>I look at my phone, 4am\u2026 I didn\u2019t really notice how tired I was until Kris started yawning like crazy next to me.</p><p>\u201cYea I could use some sleep\u2026\u201d I yawn back.<br></p><p>\u201cOh come on guys we just got the flow!\u201d Louis protests, having just as much energy as 12 hours ago.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWe can continue tomorrow\u201d Kris stands up an grabs his jacket.\u00a0\u201c(Y/N) you need a ride?\u201d<br></p><p>My apartment is actually a 20 minute walk away, like Kevin said it has a crazy convenient location, but I\u2019m not sure I want to walk 20 minutes alone at 4am in the morning.</p><p>\u201cYes please\u201d I stand up as well to get my things.<br></p><p>Louis throws a little hissyfit about us ruining\u00a0\u201cthe flow\u201d but soon gives up and follow us out and down to the garage. I\u2019m not surprised to see a bunch of fancy and expensive cars when the elevator doors open. I follow Kris and Louis to an area where the spots are reserved and Kris starts walking toward a beautiful silver Porsche.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWow\u2026\u201d I\u2019ve loved Porsches ever since I was a little girl. My dad enjoys racing, and with his favorite car being Porches, it automatically becamee mine aswell.\u00a0\u201cMy dream car is a 911 Carrera\u201d I say as I walk around the car in awe.<br></p><p>\u201cWell sadly this is just a Turbo\u201d Kris unlocks the car.<br></p><p>\u201c<i>Just a Turbo</i>\u201d Louis mocks and unlocks the car beside it, a black Maserati GranTurismo.<br></p><p>\u201cYour kidding\u201d I can\u2019t help but gawk over that car aswell.<br></p><p>\u201cNow if you\u2019d rather ride with me you could.\u201d Louis smirks at me and then Kris.</p><p>\u201cSorry Louis but this baby always comes first\u201d I chuckle.<br></p><p>\u201cAww~\u201d Kris puts his hand on his chest.<br></p><p>\u201cShe meant the car\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cUh, I- I know\u201d Kris tries to save himself but fails completely.\u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s just go\u201d He opens the car door for me like a gentleman, then gets in himself.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so tired I feel like I could fall asleep anywhere\u201d Kris says as he starts the car and start to drive.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t?\u201d I hold onto the roof handle,\u00a0\u201cI want to live\u201d<br></p><p>Kris laughs and starts to speed down the road,\u00a0 thankfully the roads are totally empty, there\u2019s not a soul for miles. He managed to get me from the studio to my apartment complex in three minutes, probably could\u2019ve gone faster if it weren\u2019t for a red light.</p><p>\u201cWan\u2019t me to escort you up?\u201d Kris says as he stops right outside the doors to my buildning<br></p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll manage\u201d I laugh and open the\u00a0 car door to get out.<br></p><p>\u201cBe at the studio tomorrow at 12, k?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYes sir\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>I close the car door behind me and hear him speed off again as I enter the building. I was longing for my bed which made the elevator ride feel like a million years. So close but yet so far\u2026 After an agonizing minute I finally reached my floor. While trying to unlock my front door I notice that it\u2019s unlocked.</p><p>\u201cDamn it Jackson\u201d I say quietly to myself. The one thing I asked him to do was to lock the door when he left. This is so unsafe!<br></p><p>I open the door, happy to see that I haven\u2019t been burglurized, and walk in. I take off my shoes and jacket and go straight to the bedroom, ready to just fall onto the bed and sleep.\u00a0</p><p>To my surprise, I find a grown man on my bed.\u00a0</p><p>I sigh, I\u2019m exhausted and all I want is to just bury myself in my fluffy duvet, but I can\u2019t help smiling at how peaceful Jackson looks. Not wanting to disturb him I grab a pillow from the bed and occupy the couch instead. Thankfully I\u2019m way too tired to care about it not being the most comfy and slowly but surely drift off into dreamland.</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cRise and shine you sloth\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cHmpf\u201d I roll over. For a split second I think that I\u2019m about to roll off the couch, but I\u2019m actually met with more soft surface. I open my eyes slowly, annoyed by the light coming through the windows.</p><p>\u201cDid you move me to the bed?\u201d I ask Jackson who hands me my black fluffy robe.<br></p><p>\u201cYea I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t wake up, I might have banged your head against the doorframe\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cSeriously?!\u201d I touch my head to feel for a bumb or bruise.<br></p><p>Jackson laughs.\u00a0\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>I shiver as I feel the cold breeze from the air-con hit my skin and put my robe on. After,\u00a0 wrapping myself in a nearby blanket.</p><p>\u201cCold?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNo kidding\u2026\u201d I press the off button on the air-con controller.<br></p><p>\u201cLucky for you I made soup\u201d Jackson skips out happily into the kitchen.<br></p><p>As if on queue the smell of chicken soup hits my nose.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s basically lunch since it\u2019s 1am but you came back so late I thought I\u2019d let you sleep\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThanks\u201d I smile and pat his shoulder, grabbing a bowl.\u00a0\u201cI must say I was surprised to see you sleeping in my bed this morning\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSorry\u2026\u201d he said looking flustered,\u00a0\u201cI had a rough night yesterday so I really didn\u2019t feel like going back to my apartment\u2026 Sorry for stealing your bed.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ok\u201d Now I feel quilty for questioning him. Obviously I don\u2019t have anything against Jackson Wang sleeping in my apartment, I was just curious as to why.\u00a0\u201cIs it something you want to talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really\u201d He said, eyes fixed on his bowl of soup. \u201cI want to but-\u201d He stopped himself from saying more,\u00a0\u201cNah forget it.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean you want to?\u201d I couldn\u2019t help myself.\u00a0</p><p>He sighed, put his spoon down and held his head in his hands.\u00a0\u201cI want to talk about it but I can\u2019t.\u201d He mumbles , so quiet I can barely hear him.</p><p>My phone starts buzzing and the screen shows that Kris is calling. SHIT I was suppose to be at the studio an hour ago! I peek at Jackson who looks as distressed as ever. I can\u2019t just leave him like this?</p><p>\u201cHey Kris\u2026\u201d I answer the phone. I ready myself for a tell-off but I\u2019m stunned when I hear him speak<br></p><p>\u201cHeyy\u201d He answers with a deeper and raspier voice than usual. Damn I\u2019m a real sucker for guys and their morning voices.<br></p><p>\u201cJust woke up too huh?\u201d I say and I can\u2019t help but blush as he speaks.<br></p><p>\u201cYea\u2026 12 was wishful thinking. How about we grab dinner tonight and go to the studio after?\u201d I hear him yawn.<br></p><p>\u201cSounds good, text me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do\u201d</p><p>We hang up and Jackson still has his head down. It\u2019s obvious that the boy needs someone to talk to.<br></p><p>\u201cYou can go I\u2019ll be fine\u2026\u201d He says as mumbly and quiet as before.<br></p><p>\u201cJackson I\u2019m not going until you talk to me.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get it, I can\u2019t\u201d He says a little louder this time.<br></p><p>\u201cWell then atleast eat.\u201d I push his bowl toward him.\u00a0\u201cOr do I need to feed you?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t respond but with a little grunt he picks his spoon back up and starts to eat.</p><p>We sit in silence until he\u2019s finished. The frustrated look on his face doesn\u2019t disappear but as time passes it starts to look more sad. When we\u2019re both done he stands up and takes our bowls to the sink. I however move to the couch where I wrap myself in yet another blanket.</p><p>\u201cAre you still cold?\u201d Jackson asks.<br></p><p>\u201cNo\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhy the blankets then?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m settling into the couch, cause I have a feeling <i>we </i>are going to be here for a while\u201d I say as I pat the space beside me on the couch.<br></p><p>Jackson sighs again.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re not going to let this go are you?\u201d.</p><p>I shake my head and pat the couch again.</p><p>He walks over and plops down beside me.\u00a0\u201cYou have to promise me to not tell anybody.\u201d He looks me dead in the eyes, more serious than I\u2019ve ever seen him before.</p><p>\u201cOk\u2026\u201d I say, now afraid of what\u2019s to come.<br></p><p>\u201cSay that you promise!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI promise\u201d<br></p><p>He takes a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about my girlfriend.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201c<i>Girlfriend?!</i>\u201d<br></p></p>",

You write music too?</p><p>&ldquo;Yea&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well damn, then we can get started already tonight, everything we need is in this studio!&rdquo; Louis claps his hands together in exitement.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Now for promoting, I have some ideas&rdquo; Kris says as he pulls me to the large couch on the other side of the room.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fiming a music video for my new song in two days and I thought maybe you could be in it?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Are you serious??&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;We needed to cast a girl anyways and I thought this would be a great teaser for you. We could keep your identity unknown and have people curious about who you are, then right before we release your song we make sure your face is everywhere so everybody is talking about&nbsp;&lsquo;the mystery girl&rsquo; you know?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I love that&rdquo; I say so exited I can&rsquo;t sit still.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll also try to get some famous music people in Asia to post your face on their social media&rdquo; He says as he start to look for something in the pile of papers on the table.</p><p>Well I know atleast one person who&rsquo;d help out with that, I think to myself.</p><p>&ldquo;So these are some concept pictures my director sent me&rdquo; Kris says as he shows me some printed photos. One picture shows a foggy room lit up with a bunch of purple neon lights on the wall, another a white 1966 mustang convertible on a lavender field, the third picture a pool lit up purple with pink rosepetals and glitter on the surface.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m guessing the theme is purple?&rdquo; I chuckle,&nbsp;&ldquo;Are these like photos for inspiration or&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No they are all taken from the set&rdquo; He answers as he shows me even more aesthetic scenery.&nbsp;&ldquo;These are going to be backgrounds in the video&rdquo;<br /></p><p>I almost choke, and I thought they were photoshopped or taken from Instagram or something.</p><p>&ldquo;Your telling me you&rsquo;ll be in a lavenderfield in a 1966 mustang&rdquo; I blink at Kris.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;If you agree you&rsquo;ll be there too&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m totally down.&rdquo; I say as I keep looking through the pictures, in awe that some of these places even exist.</p><p>Kris and I start talking more in detail about the music video and how they are going to promote me to the world and later all three of us start to work on music. I pick the samples I like the most and as Kris and Louis start to mess around with the beat I write a few test verses.</p><p>A few hours pass and we order dinner to eat while we work, same thing when the clock strikes 12 and Louis demands a midnight snack. Time flies by and we&rsquo;ve somehow managed to lay down the basic structure of three different songs.</p><p>&ldquo;Guys I think it&rsquo;s time we go home and sleep&rdquo; Kris yawns.<br /></p><p>I look at my phone, 4am&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t really notice how tired I was until Kris started yawning like crazy next to me.</p><p>&ldquo;Yea I could use some sleep&hellip;&rdquo; I yawn back.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh come on guys we just got the flow!&rdquo; Louis protests, having just as much energy as 12 hours ago.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;We can continue tomorrow&rdquo; Kris stands up an grabs his jacket.&nbsp;&ldquo;(Y/N) you need a ride?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>My apartment is actually a 20 minute walk away, like Kevin said it has a crazy convenient location, but I&rsquo;m not sure I want to walk 20 minutes alone at 4am in the morning.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes please&rdquo; I stand up as well to get my things.<br /></p><p>Louis throws a little hissyfit about us ruining&nbsp;&ldquo;the flow&rdquo; but soon gives up and follow us out and down to the garage. I&rsquo;m not surprised to see a bunch of fancy and expensive cars when the elevator doors open. I follow Kris and Louis to an area where the spots are reserved and Kris starts walking toward a beautiful silver Porsche.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Wow&hellip;&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve loved Porsches ever since I was a little girl. My dad enjoys racing, and with his favorite car being Porches, it automatically becamee mine aswell.&nbsp;&ldquo;My dream car is a 911 Carrera&rdquo; I say as I walk around the car in awe.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well sadly this is just a Turbo&rdquo; Kris unlocks the car.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>Just a Turbo</i>&rdquo; Louis mocks and unlocks the car beside it, a black Maserati GranTurismo.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Your kidding&rdquo; I can&rsquo;t help but gawk over that car aswell.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Now if you&rsquo;d rather ride with me you could.&rdquo; Louis smirks at me and then Kris.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry Louis but this baby always comes first&rdquo; I chuckle.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Aww~&rdquo; Kris puts his hand on his chest.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;She meant the car&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Uh, I- I know&rdquo; Kris tries to save himself but fails completely.&nbsp;&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just go&rdquo; He opens the car door for me like a gentleman, then gets in himself.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so tired I feel like I could fall asleep anywhere&rdquo; Kris says as he starts the car and start to drive.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t?&rdquo; I hold onto the roof handle,&nbsp;&ldquo;I want to live&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Kris laughs and starts to speed down the road,&nbsp; thankfully the roads are totally empty, there&rsquo;s not a soul for miles. He managed to get me from the studio to my apartment complex in three minutes, probably could&rsquo;ve gone faster if it weren&rsquo;t for a red light.</p><p>&ldquo;Wan&rsquo;t me to escort you up?&rdquo; Kris says as he stops right outside the doors to my buildning<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll manage&rdquo; I laugh and open the&nbsp; car door to get out.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Be at the studio tomorrow at 12, k?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yes sir&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>I close the car door behind me and hear him speed off again as I enter the building. I was longing for my bed which made the elevator ride feel like a million years. So close but yet so far&hellip; After an agonizing minute I finally reached my floor. While trying to unlock my front door I notice that it&rsquo;s unlocked.</p><p>&ldquo;Damn it Jackson&rdquo; I say quietly to myself. The one thing I asked him to do was to lock the door when he left. This is so unsafe!<br /></p><p>I open the door, happy to see that I haven&rsquo;t been burglurized, and walk in. I take off my shoes and jacket and go straight to the bedroom, ready to just fall onto the bed and sleep.&nbsp;</p><p>To my surprise, I find a grown man on my bed.&nbsp;</p><p>I sigh, I&rsquo;m exhausted and all I want is to just bury myself in my fluffy duvet, but I can&rsquo;t help smiling at how peaceful Jackson looks. Not wanting to disturb him I grab a pillow from the bed and occupy the couch instead. Thankfully I&rsquo;m way too tired to care about it not being the most comfy and slowly but surely drift off into dreamland.</p><p>-</p><p>&ldquo;Rise and shine you sloth&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hmpf&rdquo; I roll over. For a split second I think that I&rsquo;m about to roll off the couch, but I&rsquo;m actually met with more soft surface. I open my eyes slowly, annoyed by the light coming through the windows.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you move me to the bed?&rdquo; I ask Jackson who hands me my black fluffy robe.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yea I&rsquo;m surprised you didn&rsquo;t wake up, I might have banged your head against the doorframe&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Seriously?!&rdquo; I touch my head to feel for a bumb or bruise.<br /></p><p>Jackson laughs.&nbsp;&ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo;</p><p>I shiver as I feel the cold breeze from the air-con hit my skin and put my robe on. After,&nbsp; wrapping myself in a nearby blanket.</p><p>&ldquo;Cold?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No kidding&hellip;&rdquo; I press the off button on the air-con controller.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Lucky for you I made soup&rdquo; Jackson skips out happily into the kitchen.<br /></p><p>As if on queue the smell of chicken soup hits my nose.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s basically lunch since it&rsquo;s 1am but you came back so late I thought I&rsquo;d let you sleep&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Thanks&rdquo; I smile and pat his shoulder, grabbing a bowl.&nbsp;&ldquo;I must say I was surprised to see you sleeping in my bed this morning&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Sorry&hellip;&rdquo; he said looking flustered,&nbsp;&ldquo;I had a rough night yesterday so I really didn&rsquo;t feel like going back to my apartment&hellip; Sorry for stealing your bed.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ok&rdquo; Now I feel quilty for questioning him. Obviously I don&rsquo;t have anything against Jackson Wang sleeping in my apartment, I was just curious as to why.&nbsp;&ldquo;Is it something you want to talk about?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not really&rdquo; He said, eyes fixed on his bowl of soup. &ldquo;I want to but-&rdquo; He stopped himself from saying more,&nbsp;&ldquo;Nah forget it.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean you want to?&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t help myself.&nbsp;</p><p>He sighed, put his spoon down and held his head in his hands.&nbsp;&ldquo;I want to talk about it but I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; He mumbles , so quiet I can barely hear him.</p><p>My phone starts buzzing and the screen shows that Kris is calling. SHIT I was suppose to be at the studio an hour ago! I peek at Jackson who looks as distressed as ever. I can&rsquo;t just leave him like this?</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Kris&hellip;&rdquo; I answer the phone. I ready myself for a tell-off but I&rsquo;m stunned when I hear him speak<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Heyy&rdquo; He answers with a deeper and raspier voice than usual. Damn I&rsquo;m a real sucker for guys and their morning voices.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Just woke up too huh?&rdquo; I say and I can&rsquo;t help but blush as he speaks.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yea&hellip; 12 was wishful thinking. How about we grab dinner tonight and go to the studio after?&rdquo; I hear him yawn.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Sounds good, text me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Will do&rdquo;</p><p>We hang up and Jackson still has his head down. It&rsquo;s obvious that the boy needs someone to talk to.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You can go I&rsquo;ll be fine&hellip;&rdquo; He says as mumbly and quiet as before.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Jackson I&rsquo;m not going until you talk to me.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t get it, I can&rsquo;t&rdquo; He says a little louder this time.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well then atleast eat.&rdquo; I push his bowl toward him.&nbsp;&ldquo;Or do I need to feed you?&rdquo;</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t respond but with a little grunt he picks his spoon back up and starts to eat.</p><p>We sit in silence until he&rsquo;s finished. The frustrated look on his face doesn&rsquo;t disappear but as time passes it starts to look more sad. When we&rsquo;re both done he stands up and takes our bowls to the sink. I however move to the couch where I wrap myself in yet another blanket.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you still cold?&rdquo; Jackson asks.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Why the blankets then?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m settling into the couch, cause I have a feeling <i>we </i>are going to be here for a while&rdquo; I say as I pat the space beside me on the couch.<br /></p><p>Jackson sighs again.&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to let this go are you?&rdquo;.</p><p>I shake my head and pat the couch again.</p><p>He walks over and plops down beside me.&nbsp;&ldquo;You have to promise me to not tell anybody.&rdquo; He looks me dead in the eyes, more serious than I&rsquo;ve ever seen him before.</p><p>&ldquo;Ok&hellip;&rdquo; I say, now afraid of what&rsquo;s to come.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Say that you promise!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I promise&rdquo;<br /></p><p>He takes a deep breath.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about my girlfriend.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>Girlfriend?!</i>&rdquo;<br /></p></p>",
