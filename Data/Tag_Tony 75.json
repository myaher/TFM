Bullets fly everywhere and one in particular hits Steve, again you keep smiling. </p><p>Tony swoops in and flies you both to the quinjet.</p><p>\u201cWhat happend?\u201d Bruce asks as he runs up next to Steve who lays on the ground. \u201cHe\u2019s shot. He needs help now!\u201d Tony orders and Bruce starts to work his magic. \u201cWe\u2019re losing him!\u201d\u2019Bruce shouts, all the avengers stare in shock as Steve Rogers heart is failing. You arrive in the compound and everyone runs with Steve to the operation room to be saved immediately. You stay back in the quinjet, because you still can\u2019t walk. </p><p>You sit and smile, it\u2019s the only thing you know. \u201cMiss should I call someone to get you\u201d FRIDAY\u2019s voice enters the silence. \u201cOh no that won\u2019t be necessary, I will just need a wheelchair that\u2019s all\u201d you answer and to your wish a wheelchair is automatically rolled towards you.

It\u2019s my fault that this happend and that\u2019s why I made my decision. I will be leaving the avengers and go wherever. I\u2019m a hazard for this team a danger in the plans. Emotionally unstable and physically incapable. So this is goodbye to a great soldier but most importantly a man with strong morals and a loving family and me, a no good little bitch.\u201d you let your smile go for the first time today, your true colours are shown and they are grey. </p><p>You\u2019re dead inside and that was the cause of the dead of Steve. If it wasn\u2019t for you he would still be alive and it hurts that you\u2019ll have to live with that, you don\u2019t know how long you\u2019ll be able to do that.
