The night sky enveloped the both of you and you had only starlight to guide you. </p><p>&ldquo;Maybe&rdquo; you responded.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you not want to?&rdquo;  He asked, quirking an eyebrow, rolling over to face you.</p><p>&ldquo;Of  course I do! I just don&rsquo;t understand how it would be possible since you&rsquo;re only a figment of my imagination..&rdquo; you said as you fidgeted with the grass, pulling a few blades out.</p><p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m real! We&rsquo;ve met before. The first time I saw you was in a similar space as this. You would understand if you&rsquo;d just see me again! I promise I&rsquo;ll explain everything!&rdquo; The man had said.</p><p>When you woke up, your chest was heaving up and down and you had broken into a cold sweat. You found yourself buried under Iron Man themed covers and in a room decorated with the character. It wouldn&rsquo;t require a genius to understand that you were in Jungkook&rsquo;s room. In Jungkook&rsquo;s bed. <i>What happened between the two of you? Why were you in his bed?  </i>You couldn&rsquo;t remember. </p><p>You noticed him being sat beside you and stared blankly at him for a few moments. <i>Was he here the entire time? Did he just come here? How did you not notice?</i> </p><p>The said boy had worry etched all over his handsome face. You reach out to touch him, to make sure that he&rsquo;s real and you&rsquo;re not imagining him. <i>God, you honestly can&rsquo;t seem to remember much of anything.</i> You brushed your fingers against his bicep to snap him amd yourself out of whatever daze you both were in and that&rsquo;s when he looked at you with his wide doe eyes.

It had been two months since Taehyung had proposed, two months of your two-year old daughter asking to see you ring every five minutes and then throwing a tantrum when she couldn\u2019t wear it. She was obsessed. Tae and the rest of BTS were about to embark on the second leg of their tour, worries rushing through his mind that he won\u2019t be by your side when you needed him, hoping to god nothing would go wrong while he was away. </p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d you asked him, glancing over to Tae sat in the driver\u2019s seat, although, he was facing the opposite direction, glancing outside of the window. \u201cWhat if something happens?\u201d he mumbled as he bit his thumb nail, voice thick with worry. \u201cTae, don\u2019t be silly\u201d you whined, rubbing his thigh comfortingly, \u201cWhat makes you think that?\u201d you questioned, still rubbing his thigh, waiting patiently to hear his concerns. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I guess I\u2019m just frightened because I don\u2019t know what to expect, I\u2019ve never done this before\u201d he spoke, eventually turning around to face you, palm rubbing over your stomach soothingly, \u201cI\u2019m just scared that I won\u2019t be there when you need me the most and it terrifies me. What if something happens and your alone with Gi?\u201d he quizzed you, biting his gum anxiously, hand still glued to your bump protectively. \u201cTaehyung listen to me\u201d you whispered, index finger lifting his chin, his eyes meeting your own, \u201cWe\u2019ll be okay, I promise\u201d you reassured him, pressing a kiss to his lips softly. \u201cBut if it isn\u2019t you\u2019d ring me?\u201d he spoke, bottom lip curling slightly. Shaking your head, you couldn\u2019t help but let out a laugh, \u201cNo Taehyung, I wouldn\u2019t ring you if I had a concern about our unborn child\u201d you teased, tickling his waist playfully. A huge laugh escaped him due to your tickling, his hands prizing yours away from his body, the pair of you sat laughing at one another. </p><p>\u201cY/N\u201d he whined, making you let go of his hands so his own could cup your face, both of you smiling to one another lovingly. His thumb brushed over your cheek a few times before he pressed a kiss to you lips, \u201cI mean it, you will ring me with any concerns, won\u2019t you?\u201d he asked again, needing to feel reassured once more. \u201cI promise\u201d you repeated, rubbing your stomach due to the sensation of your child kicking into your ribs, the feeling making your face switch slightly. Grinning, he stared down at your bump, palm resting next to your own, both feeling the life inside of you. \u201cFor both y/n, that means Gi too\u201d he confirmed, kissing your temple once before sitting upright in his seat, igniting the engine, \u201cMy two babies\u201d he whispered, smiling to himself before pulling away, eventually driving to your appointment. </p><p>As you confirmed your name and date of birth to the receptionist, Taehyung\u2019s phone began to ring, to which he went outside to answer, he didn\u2019t want most the waiting room to hear his conversation. You disappeared into the toilet to do your usual urine sample, returning to the waiting room to see Taehyung sat there, he too must have returned from his phone call. With a sigh you sat down, clutching the sample in your hand. You couldn\u2019t help but think of Jimin whenever you visited the hospital for your appointment, hoping to god that the walls didn\u2019t remember the memories of the two of you. \u201cAll okay?\u201d you asked Taehyung, rubbing your chest subtly, you were sick of heartburn. \u201cYeah, it was just Jungkook asking if Gi can have some pizza\u201d he laughed whilst shaking his head, that\u2019s where she was for the day, Uncle Jungkook, or as Gi would say, \u201cUnc Kook\u201d. \u201cDid you say yes?\u201d you asked him, raising an eyebrow to him, Taehyung was normally the stricter parent when it came to meal times. \u201cI did\u201d he replied, pretending to be shocked at his own words, his actions making you roll your eyes sarcastically. </p><p>\u201cMiss Forename/Surname\u201d called the sonographer, eyes darting around the room in hopes to locate the lady he was calling for. Smiling, you stood up from your seat and headed towards the door that was being held opened for you, Taehyung following your lead. You shuffled onto the bed, pulling up your jumper and pulling your trousers and pants down marginally. \u201cOkay then, how have we been y/n? Have we been feeling lots of movement from baby?\u201d asked the sonographer whilst he applied the cold lubricant onto your stomach, the feeling making your shiver slightly. \u201cI\u2019ve been good lately, a lot better than I was in the earlier stages and yes, lots of movement\u201d you informed him, laying your head back comfortably. \u201cGood, that\u2019s what I like to hear\u201d he smiled as he gently placed the probe onto the lower part of your stomach, \u201cGoing to the toilet okay?\u201d he asked, eyes scurrying on the screen wanting to get the best view of your baby. Taehyung took his moment to hold your hand, pressing a soft kiss to your palm, lips remained pressed to it. \u201cYes\u201d you laughed as Taehyung wiggled his eyebrows. \u201cWell, I can assure the both of you that your child is looking very healthy, you\u2019re doing a great job\u201d the sonographer revealed as he examined the screen, Taehyungs sigh with relief made the both of you laugh, \u201cFeeling stressed Daddy?\u201d joked the sonographer as he turned the screen to face the pair of you, the view of your baby in clear sight. \u201cI did until I saw that\u201d Taehyung admitted, a sense of pride and unconditional love washing over him as he looked at his child moving on the screen. \u201cHe\u2019s doing really well, measuring perfectly\u201d chirped the sonographer, face dropping when he saw both yours and Taehyung\u2019s reactions. \u201cA boy?\u201d you asked, voice almost a whisper, lump forming in your throat, \u201cWe\u2019re having a boy?\u201d you confirmed, squeezing Tae\u2019s hand harder than before. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I thought you knew\u201d he apologised, hand covering his mouth with shock, feeling instantly guilty due to his mistake. \u201cDon\u2019t be\u201d Taehyung reassured, kissing your hand once more as his eyes filled with tears, \u201cWe\u2019re having a son and our little girl will have a baby brother\u2026that\u2019s all that matters\u201d. </p><p>You arrived to Jungkook\u2019s apartment, waiting patiently after Taehyung had rang the bell. The thick wooden door opened, Jungkook appearing, Gi attached to his hip. \u201cHi Ma and Da\u201d Gi squealed, cuddling herself into Jungkooks neck, pretending to act shy, the three of you rolling your eyes at her antics. \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of watching Nemo\u201d Jungkook told you and Tae, sitting himself and Gi into the corner of his sofa comfortably once more, blanket placed over the two of them. At times, you weren\u2019t sure who was the biggest baby, her or JK. So there the four of you sat for the next 45 minutes, watching Finding Nemo. \u201cHow was the appointment by the way?\u201d Jungkook asked, eyes still glued to the tv as he played with Gi\u2019s hair, rubbing some of it between his hands so it stood straight into the air, making it look as though she an antenna. \u201cEverything is looking healthy\u201d Taehyung announced to his friend, a look of pride taking over his face, \u201cWe also have some news\u201d he mumbled, hand rubbing over your bump soothingly, \u201cWe\u2019re having a boy\u201d. Even though Jungkook was still heavily invested into the film, his face beamed with happiness, grin spreading across his face, \u201cI am so happy for you both\u201d he laughed, glancing to you slightly, \u201cYour glowing y/n, both of you are\u201d. </p><p>As the film progressed, Gi became more and more devoted to the story, realising what was happening to Nemo. \u201cDa\u201d she whined, standing up from Jungkook and removing herself from the blanket, crawling across the sofa to her father. \u201cWhat is it baby?\u201d Taehyung asked, laughing slightly to her current mood. \u201cNemo\u201d she cried, tears beginning to fall down her face, head cuddled into his neck. \u201cBaby, look, his daddy is there\u201d Taehyung whispered in her ear as he rubbed her back, feeling her cry against him, \u201cHis daddy is there to make it all better, just like me\u201d. Halting her cries with a sniff she turned to face the screen, watching intently as Nemo and his father joked around with one another at the end of the film, showing a happy ending. \u201cSee, everyone is happy now, so please don\u2019t be sad baby\u201d he mumbled, wiping the tears from her cheeks. She nodded, sniffing hard once more. \u201cCome here\u201d Taehyung spoke, gathering his sleeve before wiping away the snot from her face. \u201cLovely\u201d Jungkook joked, pulling a face as he watched Tae wipe it away with his jumper sleeve. Although, Taehyung wasn\u2019t fazed, as long as his baby girl was okay, he didn\u2019t care. \u201cShall we go home?\u201d you whispered, stroking her cheek with your thumb, \u201cMaybe daddy will make his Udon noodles?\u201d you teased, raising your eyebrow to Taehyung. \u201cIf it\u2019ll make my girls happy\u201d he remarked as he rolled his eyes, he couldn\u2019t pretend, it was obvious he\u2019d do anything to see his family. </p><p>Taehyung was due to leave for tour in the early hours of the morning, a car was scheduled to come and pick him up around 3am to head to the airport, first stop was Japan. The three of you had had a family night, favourite meal cooked and games were played, the three of you laughing to your hearts content. Gi was currently dancing around the front room, it was clear it was in her genes. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about getting her lessons\u201d you stated, watching her prance around angelically, \u201cI think she\u2019d do well\u201d. Taehyung smiled as he watched her in awe, his hand clasping yours, \u201cShe takes after Jimin that\u2019s for sure\u201d he joked, placing a kiss to your shoulder, \u201cI still can\u2019t believe how much she looks like him\u201d. You hummed as a reply, not wanting to think about it. \u201cI wonder who he\u2019ll look like\u201d you commented, glancing down to your bump, movement visible through your t-shirt. \u201cYou I hope\u201d Taehyung mumbled, pressing a kiss to your shoulder, \u201cGigi, who do you think your baby brother will look like?\u201d Taehyung asked her, smirking as he waited for her reply. She turned around to face the pair of you, smiling cheekily, \u201cME\u201d she shouted, running towards Tae and diving onto him, causing him to groan as she hit his \u2018sensitive area\u2019. \u201cCareful\u201d you told Gi, trying your hardest not to laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s a good job you\u2019re already pregnant, I think Gi may have just ruined the chances of anymore\u201d he joked, face twisting due to the pain he was feeling. You had told her over dinner that she was going to have a baby brother, she took it better than you thought, she had just grinned and tucked into her noodles, maybe she was too young to understand. </p><p>Eventually, Gi had fallen asleep. Normally, she would have been taken to bed earlier in the evening. However, due to Taehyung leaving for the tour, you both decided to spend time as a family, wanting to spend every minute together before he left. She was cuddled into your side, head resting slightly on your bump. She had placed her ear and cheek against your stomach before she had fallen asleep, curious to feel or hear her baby brother. It was the first time she had felt him kick, the feeling causing her to squeal out with happiness, laugh echoing amongst the living room. You brushed your fingers through her hair, looking down at her in awe. \u201cI love her so much Tae\u201d you mumbled, smiling to yourself, \u201cNever felt love like it\u201d. His nose brushed your ear, smiling subtly, \u201cCouldn\u2019t agree more\u201d he whispered, a kiss pressed below your ear. \u201cI\u2019m going to take her up to bed\u201d you said while attempting to feel her off yourself, \u201cHere, I\u2019ll take her\u201d Taehyung offered, whisking her up in one swift and easy motion, in all honesty you were glad, it was proving difficult to carry her with such a huge bump. \u201cNight baby\u201d you mumbled, kissing her mouth that was agape, \u201cMama loves you so much\u201d. He waited until you were finished saying goodnight before he headed up the stairs, ready to tuck her into bed. You knew why he wanted to take her to bed himself, he wanted to make sure she was asleep and safe, he\u2019d be leaving her behind for a few weeks, it was a comfort to him to know that he had put her to bed before he left, it had become a tradition. </p><p>You waited in the bedroom patiently for Taehyung whilst he said goodnight to his daughter. You sat against the headboard, pillows puffed up on both sides, lamps illuminating the bedroom with a soft glow. Moments later, the door creaked open to reveal your fianc\u00e9, shutting the door behind him. \u201cShe\u2019s flat out\u201d he laughed, pulling the covers back before removing his clothes, leaving himself in just his boxers. He was one for sleeping naked, however, since Gi had occasionally snuck into the bed, he thought it was best to sleep in his boxers, just in case there was a surprise intruder. \u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked as he slipped under the duvet, head relaxingly placed against the headboard staring over to you. \u201cI have something for you\u201d you blurted out, ignoring his previous question. \u201cLike what?\u201d he questioned, head still resting comfortably. \u201cHere\u201d you spoke, handing him an A4 envelope. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked, sitting up straight, confused yet intrigued to what the manila envelope held. \u201cOpen it and you\u2019ll find out\u201d you laughed, hitting his foot with your own, your actions causing a small laugh to escape him. The envelope was torn open, anticipation building inside of you as he pulled out various pieces of white paper. He began to read the documents for a few moments, before realising what it was that you had given him. </p><p>\u201cIs this real?\u201d he asked, tears forming in his eyes, \u201cPlease tell me this isn\u2019t a joke?\u201d he cried, hand covering his mouth as he broke down crying. \u201cIt\u2019s for real\u201d you cried, a single tear falling down your cheek. \u201cShe\u2019s going to be mine, officially?\u201d he confirmed, cheeks soaked with his tears, although he was crying, a smile couldn\u2019t help but appear at the thought of Gi officially becoming his daughter, it was adoption papers, you wanted her to be his, to take the same name as her father. \u201cY/N\u201d he cried, putting the papers to one side, tucking his head into your neck, seeking comfort, \u201cShe\u2019s going to be mine\u201d. You cradled him into your neck, one arm rubbing his back whilst the other played with his hair. Kissing his forehead, you smiled against it, a tear dripping onto his nose, \u201cThank you for being her father\u201d you whispered, \u201cShe\u2019ll always be yours\u201d. He smiled against your neck, hand rubbing over you bump, pride building inside of him. Soon his family would be complete, the phrase \u2018The Kims\u2019 spinning around his head, making him laugh slightly. \u201cThank you is all I can manage right now\u201d he confessed, cries still escaping him. So, there you both laid, cuddled into one another lovingly, knowing all too well this would be the last night for a while that he\u2019d be able to hold you. </p><p>-</p><p>The following morning Taehyung buckled himself into the seat of the jet that was taking them to Japan. \u201cHow was your night?\u201d Jungkook asked, yawning after he spoke, it was clear he\u2019d been gaming for most of the night. \u201cI have some news actually\u201d he spoke, glancing to his fellow members, \u201cY/N has given me the adoption rights to Gi, I\u2019ll officially be her father\u2026she\u2019ll be a Kim\u201d he grinned, tears forming once more. Namjoon clapped his hands together for Tae, squeezing his leg firmly, \u201cThat\u2019s great news Tae, honestly, I can\u2019t tell you how happy that makes me, well, all of us I assume\u201d he joked, smiling to him kindly. \u201cAnother Kim\u201d Jin added, him too grinning, \u201cWe\u2019re taking over the world\u201d. The seven of them laughed at Jin\u2019s remark, obviously Jin himself found it the funniest. \u201cWe\u2019re all so pleased for you Tae\u201d Jimin commented, a warming smile radiating as he looked to Tae, who was to his right, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you so happy\u201d. Taehyung plonked his head onto Jimin\u2019s shoulder comfortingly as he clicked the lock button on his phone to see the time, a picture of you and Gi evident as his wallpaper. \u201cThank you\u201d Tae whispered to Jimin as smiled down at his phone. </p><p>For Taehyung didn\u2019t notice the smile on Jimin\u2019s face as he too looked at said photo. It was clear how much Gi was like him, the sight breaking his heart into two, if only Taehyung knew the truth. He knew it was time to accept that both you and Gi would never be his, he was ready to let go. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"270\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4ceaa574bd204e0dd068aebc653e5596/tumblr_inline_prekuaj3pS1wvzgav_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"270\" data-orig-width=\"540\"/></figure>",

It had been two months since Taehyung had proposed, two months of your two-year old daughter asking to see you ring every five minutes and then throwing a tantrum when she couldn\u2019t wear it. She was obsessed. Tae and the rest of BTS were about to embark on the second leg of their tour, worries rushing through his mind that he won\u2019t be by your side when you needed him, hoping to god nothing would go wrong while he was away. </p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d you asked him, glancing over to Tae sat in the driver\u2019s seat, although, he was facing the opposite direction, glancing outside of the window. \u201cWhat if something happens?\u201d he mumbled as he bit his thumb nail, voice thick with worry. \u201cTae, don\u2019t be silly\u201d you whined, rubbing his thigh comfortingly, \u201cWhat makes you think that?\u201d you questioned, still rubbing his thigh, waiting patiently to hear his concerns. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I guess I\u2019m just frightened because I don\u2019t know what to expect, I\u2019ve never done this before\u201d he spoke, eventually turning around to face you, palm rubbing over your stomach soothingly, \u201cI\u2019m just scared that I won\u2019t be there when you need me the most and it terrifies me. What if something happens and your alone with Gi?\u201d he quizzed you, biting his gum anxiously, hand still glued to your bump protectively. \u201cTaehyung listen to me\u201d you whispered, index finger lifting his chin, his eyes meeting your own, \u201cWe\u2019ll be okay, I promise\u201d you reassured him, pressing a kiss to his lips softly. \u201cBut if it isn\u2019t you\u2019d ring me?\u201d he spoke, bottom lip curling slightly. Shaking your head, you couldn\u2019t help but let out a laugh, \u201cNo Taehyung, I wouldn\u2019t ring you if I had a concern about our unborn child\u201d you teased, tickling his waist playfully. A huge laugh escaped him due to your tickling, his hands prizing yours away from his body, the pair of you sat laughing at one another. </p><p>\u201cY/N\u201d he whined, making you let go of his hands so his own could cup your face, both of you smiling to one another lovingly. His thumb brushed over your cheek a few times before he pressed a kiss to you lips, \u201cI mean it, you will ring me with any concerns, won\u2019t you?\u201d he asked again, needing to feel reassured once more. \u201cI promise\u201d you repeated, rubbing your stomach due to the sensation of your child kicking into your ribs, the feeling making your face switch slightly. Grinning, he stared down at your bump, palm resting next to your own, both feeling the life inside of you. \u201cFor both y/n, that means Gi too\u201d he confirmed, kissing your temple once before sitting upright in his seat, igniting the engine, \u201cMy two babies\u201d he whispered, smiling to himself before pulling away, eventually driving to your appointment. </p><p>As you confirmed your name and date of birth to the receptionist, Taehyung\u2019s phone began to ring, to which he went outside to answer, he didn\u2019t want most the waiting room to hear his conversation. You disappeared into the toilet to do your usual urine sample, returning to the waiting room to see Taehyung sat there, he too must have returned from his phone call. With a sigh you sat down, clutching the sample in your hand. You couldn\u2019t help but think of Jimin whenever you visited the hospital for your appointment, hoping to god that the walls didn\u2019t remember the memories of the two of you. \u201cAll okay?\u201d you asked Taehyung, rubbing your chest subtly, you were sick of heartburn. \u201cYeah, it was just Jungkook asking if Gi can have some pizza\u201d he laughed whilst shaking his head, that\u2019s where she was for the day, Uncle Jungkook, or as Gi would say, \u201cUnc Kook\u201d. \u201cDid you say yes?\u201d you asked him, raising an eyebrow to him, Taehyung was normally the stricter parent when it came to meal times. \u201cI did\u201d he replied, pretending to be shocked at his own words, his actions making you roll your eyes sarcastically. </p><p>\u201cMiss Forename/Surname\u201d called the sonographer, eyes darting around the room in hopes to locate the lady he was calling for. Smiling, you stood up from your seat and headed towards the door that was being held opened for you, Taehyung following your lead. You shuffled onto the bed, pulling up your jumper and pulling your trousers and pants down marginally. \u201cOkay then, how have we been y/n? Have we been feeling lots of movement from baby?\u201d asked the sonographer whilst he applied the cold lubricant onto your stomach, the feeling making your shiver slightly. \u201cI\u2019ve been good lately, a lot better than I was in the earlier stages and yes, lots of movement\u201d you informed him, laying your head back comfortably. \u201cGood, that\u2019s what I like to hear\u201d he smiled as he gently placed the probe onto the lower part of your stomach, \u201cGoing to the toilet okay?\u201d he asked, eyes scurrying on the screen wanting to get the best view of your baby. Taehyung took his moment to hold your hand, pressing a soft kiss to your palm, lips remained pressed to it. \u201cYes\u201d you laughed as Taehyung wiggled his eyebrows. \u201cWell, I can assure the both of you that your child is looking very healthy, you\u2019re doing a great job\u201d the sonographer revealed as he examined the screen, Taehyungs sigh with relief made the both of you laugh, \u201cFeeling stressed Daddy?\u201d joked the sonographer as he turned the screen to face the pair of you, the view of your baby in clear sight. \u201cI did until I saw that\u201d Taehyung admitted, a sense of pride and unconditional love washing over him as he looked at his child moving on the screen. \u201cHe\u2019s doing really well, measuring perfectly\u201d chirped the sonographer, face dropping when he saw both yours and Taehyung\u2019s reactions. \u201cA boy?\u201d you asked, voice almost a whisper, lump forming in your throat, \u201cWe\u2019re having a boy?\u201d you confirmed, squeezing Tae\u2019s hand harder than before. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I thought you knew\u201d he apologised, hand covering his mouth with shock, feeling instantly guilty due to his mistake. \u201cDon\u2019t be\u201d Taehyung reassured, kissing your hand once more as his eyes filled with tears, \u201cWe\u2019re having a son and our little girl will have a baby brother\u2026that\u2019s all that matters\u201d. </p><p>You arrived to Jungkook\u2019s apartment, waiting patiently after Taehyung had rang the bell. The thick wooden door opened, Jungkook appearing, Gi attached to his hip. \u201cHi Ma and Da\u201d Gi squealed, cuddling herself into Jungkooks neck, pretending to act shy, the three of you rolling your eyes at her antics. \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of watching Nemo\u201d Jungkook told you and Tae, sitting himself and Gi into the corner of his sofa comfortably once more, blanket placed over the two of them. At times, you weren\u2019t sure who was the biggest baby, her or JK. So there the four of you sat for the next 45 minutes, watching Finding Nemo. \u201cHow was the appointment by the way?\u201d Jungkook asked, eyes still glued to the tv as he played with Gi\u2019s hair, rubbing some of it between his hands so it stood straight into the air, making it look as though she an antenna. \u201cEverything is looking healthy\u201d Taehyung announced to his friend, a look of pride taking over his face, \u201cWe also have some news\u201d he mumbled, hand rubbing over your bump soothingly, \u201cWe\u2019re having a boy\u201d. Even though Jungkook was still heavily invested into the film, his face beamed with happiness, grin spreading across his face, \u201cI am so happy for you both\u201d he laughed, glancing to you slightly, \u201cYour glowing y/n, both of you are\u201d. </p><p>As the film progressed, Gi became more and more devoted to the story, realising what was happening to Nemo. \u201cDa\u201d she whined, standing up from Jungkook and removing herself from the blanket, crawling across the sofa to her father. \u201cWhat is it baby?\u201d Taehyung asked, laughing slightly to her current mood. \u201cNemo\u201d she cried, tears beginning to fall down her face, head cuddled into his neck. \u201cBaby, look, his daddy is there\u201d Taehyung whispered in her ear as he rubbed her back, feeling her cry against him, \u201cHis daddy is there to make it all better, just like me\u201d. Halting her cries with a sniff she turned to face the screen, watching intently as Nemo and his father joked around with one another at the end of the film, showing a happy ending. \u201cSee, everyone is happy now, so please don\u2019t be sad baby\u201d he mumbled, wiping the tears from her cheeks. She nodded, sniffing hard once more. \u201cCome here\u201d Taehyung spoke, gathering his sleeve before wiping away the snot from her face. \u201cLovely\u201d Jungkook joked, pulling a face as he watched Tae wipe it away with his jumper sleeve. Although, Taehyung wasn\u2019t fazed, as long as his baby girl was okay, he didn\u2019t care. \u201cShall we go home?\u201d you whispered, stroking her cheek with your thumb, \u201cMaybe daddy will make his Udon noodles?\u201d you teased, raising your eyebrow to Taehyung. \u201cIf it\u2019ll make my girls happy\u201d he remarked as he rolled his eyes, he couldn\u2019t pretend, it was obvious he\u2019d do anything to see his family. </p><p>Taehyung was due to leave for tour in the early hours of the morning, a car was scheduled to come and pick him up around 3am to head to the airport, first stop was Japan. The three of you had had a family night, favourite meal cooked and games were played, the three of you laughing to your hearts content. Gi was currently dancing around the front room, it was clear it was in her genes. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about getting her lessons\u201d you stated, watching her prance around angelically, \u201cI think she\u2019d do well\u201d. Taehyung smiled as he watched her in awe, his hand clasping yours, \u201cShe takes after Jimin that\u2019s for sure\u201d he joked, placing a kiss to your shoulder, \u201cI still can\u2019t believe how much she looks like him\u201d. You hummed as a reply, not wanting to think about it. \u201cI wonder who he\u2019ll look like\u201d you commented, glancing down to your bump, movement visible through your t-shirt. \u201cYou I hope\u201d Taehyung mumbled, pressing a kiss to your shoulder, \u201cGigi, who do you think your baby brother will look like?\u201d Taehyung asked her, smirking as he waited for her reply. She turned around to face the pair of you, smiling cheekily, \u201cME\u201d she shouted, running towards Tae and diving onto him, causing him to groan as she hit his \u2018sensitive area\u2019. \u201cCareful\u201d you told Gi, trying your hardest not to laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s a good job you\u2019re already pregnant, I think Gi may have just ruined the chances of anymore\u201d he joked, face twisting due to the pain he was feeling. You had told her over dinner that she was going to have a baby brother, she took it better than you thought, she had just grinned and tucked into her noodles, maybe she was too young to understand. </p><p>Eventually, Gi had fallen asleep. Normally, she would have been taken to bed earlier in the evening. However, due to Taehyung leaving for the tour, you both decided to spend time as a family, wanting to spend every minute together before he left. She was cuddled into your side, head resting slightly on your bump. She had placed her ear and cheek against your stomach before she had fallen asleep, curious to feel or hear her baby brother. It was the first time she had felt him kick, the feeling causing her to squeal out with happiness, laugh echoing amongst the living room. You brushed your fingers through her hair, looking down at her in awe. \u201cI love her so much Tae\u201d you mumbled, smiling to yourself, \u201cNever felt love like it\u201d. His nose brushed your ear, smiling subtly, \u201cCouldn\u2019t agree more\u201d he whispered, a kiss pressed below your ear. \u201cI\u2019m going to take her up to bed\u201d you said while attempting to feel her off yourself, \u201cHere, I\u2019ll take her\u201d Taehyung offered, whisking her up in one swift and easy motion, in all honesty you were glad, it was proving difficult to carry her with such a huge bump. \u201cNight baby\u201d you mumbled, kissing her mouth that was agape, \u201cMama loves you so much\u201d. He waited until you were finished saying goodnight before he headed up the stairs, ready to tuck her into bed. You knew why he wanted to take her to bed himself, he wanted to make sure she was asleep and safe, he\u2019d be leaving her behind for a few weeks, it was a comfort to him to know that he had put her to bed before he left, it had become a tradition. </p><p>You waited in the bedroom patiently for Taehyung whilst he said goodnight to his daughter. You sat against the headboard, pillows puffed up on both sides, lamps illuminating the bedroom with a soft glow. Moments later, the door creaked open to reveal your fianc\u00e9, shutting the door behind him. \u201cShe\u2019s flat out\u201d he laughed, pulling the covers back before removing his clothes, leaving himself in just his boxers. He was one for sleeping naked, however, since Gi had occasionally snuck into the bed, he thought it was best to sleep in his boxers, just in case there was a surprise intruder. \u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked as he slipped under the duvet, head relaxingly placed against the headboard staring over to you. \u201cI have something for you\u201d you blurted out, ignoring his previous question. \u201cLike what?\u201d he questioned, head still resting comfortably. \u201cHere\u201d you spoke, handing him an A4 envelope. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked, sitting up straight, confused yet intrigued to what the manila envelope held. \u201cOpen it and you\u2019ll find out\u201d you laughed, hitting his foot with your own, your actions causing a small laugh to escape him. The envelope was torn open, anticipation building inside of you as he pulled out various pieces of white paper. He began to read the documents for a few moments, before realising what it was that you had given him. </p><p>\u201cIs this real?\u201d he asked, tears forming in his eyes, \u201cPlease tell me this isn\u2019t a joke?\u201d he cried, hand covering his mouth as he broke down crying. \u201cIt\u2019s for real\u201d you cried, a single tear falling down your cheek. \u201cShe\u2019s going to be mine, officially?\u201d he confirmed, cheeks soaked with his tears, although he was crying, a smile couldn\u2019t help but appear at the thought of Gi officially becoming his daughter, it was adoption papers, you wanted her to be his, to take the same name as her father. \u201cY/N\u201d he cried, putting the papers to one side, tucking his head into your neck, seeking comfort, \u201cShe\u2019s going to be mine\u201d. You cradled him into your neck, one arm rubbing his back whilst the other played with his hair. Kissing his forehead, you smiled against it, a tear dripping onto his nose, \u201cThank you for being her father\u201d you whispered, \u201cShe\u2019ll always be yours\u201d. He smiled against your neck, hand rubbing over you bump, pride building inside of him. Soon his family would be complete, the phrase \u2018The Kims\u2019 spinning around his head, making him laugh slightly. \u201cThank you is all I can manage right now\u201d he confessed, cries still escaping him. So, there you both laid, cuddled into one another lovingly, knowing all too well this would be the last night for a while that he\u2019d be able to hold you. </p><p>-</p><p>The following morning Taehyung buckled himself into the seat of the jet that was taking them to Japan. \u201cHow was your night?\u201d Jungkook asked, yawning after he spoke, it was clear he\u2019d been gaming for most of the night. \u201cI have some news actually\u201d he spoke, glancing to his fellow members, \u201cY/N has given me the adoption rights to Gi, I\u2019ll officially be her father\u2026she\u2019ll be a Kim\u201d he grinned, tears forming once more. Namjoon clapped his hands together for Tae, squeezing his leg firmly, \u201cThat\u2019s great news Tae, honestly, I can\u2019t tell you how happy that makes me, well, all of us I assume\u201d he joked, smiling to him kindly. \u201cAnother Kim\u201d Jin added, him too grinning, \u201cWe\u2019re taking over the world\u201d. The seven of them laughed at Jin\u2019s remark, obviously Jin himself found it the funniest. \u201cWe\u2019re all so pleased for you Tae\u201d Jimin commented, a warming smile radiating as he looked to Tae, who was to his right, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you so happy\u201d. Taehyung plonked his head onto Jimin\u2019s shoulder comfortingly as he clicked the lock button on his phone to see the time, a picture of you and Gi evident as his wallpaper. \u201cThank you\u201d Tae whispered to Jimin as smiled down at his phone. </p><p>For Taehyung didn\u2019t notice the smile on Jimin\u2019s face as he too looked at said photo. It was clear how much Gi was like him, the sight breaking his heart into two, if only Taehyung knew the truth. He knew it was time to accept that both you and Gi would never be his, he was ready to let go. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"270\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4ceaa574bd204e0dd068aebc653e5596/tumblr_inline_prekuaj3pS1wvzgav_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"270\" data-orig-width=\"540\"></figure></p>",

It had been two months since Taehyung had proposed, two months of your two-year old daughter asking to see you ring every five minutes and then throwing a tantrum when she couldn\u2019t wear it. She was obsessed. Tae and the rest of BTS were about to embark on the second leg of their tour, worries rushing through his mind that he won\u2019t be by your side when you needed him, hoping to god nothing would go wrong while he was away. </p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d you asked him, glancing over to Tae sat in the driver\u2019s seat, although, he was facing the opposite direction, glancing outside of the window. \u201cWhat if something happens?\u201d he mumbled as he bit his thumb nail, voice thick with worry. \u201cTae, don\u2019t be silly\u201d you whined, rubbing his thigh comfortingly, \u201cWhat makes you think that?\u201d you questioned, still rubbing his thigh, waiting patiently to hear his concerns. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I guess I\u2019m just frightened because I don\u2019t know what to expect, I\u2019ve never done this before\u201d he spoke, eventually turning around to face you, palm rubbing over your stomach soothingly, \u201cI\u2019m just scared that I won\u2019t be there when you need me the most and it terrifies me. What if something happens and your alone with Gi?\u201d he quizzed you, biting his gum anxiously, hand still glued to your bump protectively. \u201cTaehyung listen to me\u201d you whispered, index finger lifting his chin, his eyes meeting your own, \u201cWe\u2019ll be okay, I promise\u201d you reassured him, pressing a kiss to his lips softly. \u201cBut if it isn\u2019t you\u2019d ring me?\u201d he spoke, bottom lip curling slightly. Shaking your head, you couldn\u2019t help but let out a laugh, \u201cNo Taehyung, I wouldn\u2019t ring you if I had a concern about our unborn child\u201d you teased, tickling his waist playfully. A huge laugh escaped him due to your tickling, his hands prizing yours away from his body, the pair of you sat laughing at one another. </p><p>\u201cY/N\u201d he whined, making you let go of his hands so his own could cup your face, both of you smiling to one another lovingly. His thumb brushed over your cheek a few times before he pressed a kiss to you lips, \u201cI mean it, you will ring me with any concerns, won\u2019t you?\u201d he asked again, needing to feel reassured once more. \u201cI promise\u201d you repeated, rubbing your stomach due to the sensation of your child kicking into your ribs, the feeling making your face switch slightly. Grinning, he stared down at your bump, palm resting next to your own, both feeling the life inside of you. \u201cFor both y/n, that means Gi too\u201d he confirmed, kissing your temple once before sitting upright in his seat, igniting the engine, \u201cMy two babies\u201d he whispered, smiling to himself before pulling away, eventually driving to your appointment. </p><p>As you confirmed your name and date of birth to the receptionist, Taehyung\u2019s phone began to ring, to which he went outside to answer, he didn\u2019t want most the waiting room to hear his conversation. You disappeared into the toilet to do your usual urine sample, returning to the waiting room to see Taehyung sat there, he too must have returned from his phone call. With a sigh you sat down, clutching the sample in your hand. You couldn\u2019t help but think of Jimin whenever you visited the hospital for your appointment, hoping to god that the walls didn\u2019t remember the memories of the two of you. \u201cAll okay?\u201d you asked Taehyung, rubbing your chest subtly, you were sick of heartburn. \u201cYeah, it was just Jungkook asking if Gi can have some pizza\u201d he laughed whilst shaking his head, that\u2019s where she was for the day, Uncle Jungkook, or as Gi would say, \u201cUnc Kook\u201d. \u201cDid you say yes?\u201d you asked him, raising an eyebrow to him, Taehyung was normally the stricter parent when it came to meal times. \u201cI did\u201d he replied, pretending to be shocked at his own words, his actions making you roll your eyes sarcastically. </p><p>\u201cMiss Forename/Surname\u201d called the sonographer, eyes darting around the room in hopes to locate the lady he was calling for. Smiling, you stood up from your seat and headed towards the door that was being held opened for you, Taehyung following your lead. You shuffled onto the bed, pulling up your jumper and pulling your trousers and pants down marginally. \u201cOkay then, how have we been y/n? Have we been feeling lots of movement from baby?\u201d asked the sonographer whilst he applied the cold lubricant onto your stomach, the feeling making your shiver slightly. \u201cI\u2019ve been good lately, a lot better than I was in the earlier stages and yes, lots of movement\u201d you informed him, laying your head back comfortably. \u201cGood, that\u2019s what I like to hear\u201d he smiled as he gently placed the probe onto the lower part of your stomach, \u201cGoing to the toilet okay?\u201d he asked, eyes scurrying on the screen wanting to get the best view of your baby. Taehyung took his moment to hold your hand, pressing a soft kiss to your palm, lips remained pressed to it. \u201cYes\u201d you laughed as Taehyung wiggled his eyebrows. \u201cWell, I can assure the both of you that your child is looking very healthy, you\u2019re doing a great job\u201d the sonographer revealed as he examined the screen, Taehyungs sigh with relief made the both of you laugh, \u201cFeeling stressed Daddy?\u201d joked the sonographer as he turned the screen to face the pair of you, the view of your baby in clear sight. \u201cI did until I saw that\u201d Taehyung admitted, a sense of pride and unconditional love washing over him as he looked at his child moving on the screen. \u201cHe\u2019s doing really well, measuring perfectly\u201d chirped the sonographer, face dropping when he saw both yours and Taehyung\u2019s reactions. \u201cA boy?\u201d you asked, voice almost a whisper, lump forming in your throat, \u201cWe\u2019re having a boy?\u201d you confirmed, squeezing Tae\u2019s hand harder than before. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I thought you knew\u201d he apologised, hand covering his mouth with shock, feeling instantly guilty due to his mistake. \u201cDon\u2019t be\u201d Taehyung reassured, kissing your hand once more as his eyes filled with tears, \u201cWe\u2019re having a son and our little girl will have a baby brother\u2026that\u2019s all that matters\u201d. </p><p>You arrived to Jungkook\u2019s apartment, waiting patiently after Taehyung had rang the bell. The thick wooden door opened, Jungkook appearing, Gi attached to his hip. \u201cHi Ma and Da\u201d Gi squealed, cuddling herself into Jungkooks neck, pretending to act shy, the three of you rolling your eyes at her antics. \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of watching Nemo\u201d Jungkook told you and Tae, sitting himself and Gi into the corner of his sofa comfortably once more, blanket placed over the two of them. At times, you weren\u2019t sure who was the biggest baby, her or JK. So there the four of you sat for the next 45 minutes, watching Finding Nemo. \u201cHow was the appointment by the way?\u201d Jungkook asked, eyes still glued to the tv as he played with Gi\u2019s hair, rubbing some of it between his hands so it stood straight into the air, making it look as though she an antenna. \u201cEverything is looking healthy\u201d Taehyung announced to his friend, a look of pride taking over his face, \u201cWe also have some news\u201d he mumbled, hand rubbing over your bump soothingly, \u201cWe\u2019re having a boy\u201d. Even though Jungkook was still heavily invested into the film, his face beamed with happiness, grin spreading across his face, \u201cI am so happy for you both\u201d he laughed, glancing to you slightly, \u201cYour glowing y/n, both of you are\u201d. </p><p>As the film progressed, Gi became more and more devoted to the story, realising what was happening to Nemo. \u201cDa\u201d she whined, standing up from Jungkook and removing herself from the blanket, crawling across the sofa to her father. \u201cWhat is it baby?\u201d Taehyung asked, laughing slightly to her current mood. \u201cNemo\u201d she cried, tears beginning to fall down her face, head cuddled into his neck. \u201cBaby, look, his daddy is there\u201d Taehyung whispered in her ear as he rubbed her back, feeling her cry against him, \u201cHis daddy is there to make it all better, just like me\u201d. Halting her cries with a sniff she turned to face the screen, watching intently as Nemo and his father joked around with one another at the end of the film, showing a happy ending. \u201cSee, everyone is happy now, so please don\u2019t be sad baby\u201d he mumbled, wiping the tears from her cheeks. She nodded, sniffing hard once more. \u201cCome here\u201d Taehyung spoke, gathering his sleeve before wiping away the snot from her face. \u201cLovely\u201d Jungkook joked, pulling a face as he watched Tae wipe it away with his jumper sleeve. Although, Taehyung wasn\u2019t fazed, as long as his baby girl was okay, he didn\u2019t care. \u201cShall we go home?\u201d you whispered, stroking her cheek with your thumb, \u201cMaybe daddy will make his Udon noodles?\u201d you teased, raising your eyebrow to Taehyung. \u201cIf it\u2019ll make my girls happy\u201d he remarked as he rolled his eyes, he couldn\u2019t pretend, it was obvious he\u2019d do anything to see his family. </p><p>Taehyung was due to leave for tour in the early hours of the morning, a car was scheduled to come and pick him up around 3am to head to the airport, first stop was Japan. The three of you had had a family night, favourite meal cooked and games were played, the three of you laughing to your hearts content. Gi was currently dancing around the front room, it was clear it was in her genes. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about getting her lessons\u201d you stated, watching her prance around angelically, \u201cI think she\u2019d do well\u201d. Taehyung smiled as he watched her in awe, his hand clasping yours, \u201cShe takes after Jimin that\u2019s for sure\u201d he joked, placing a kiss to your shoulder, \u201cI still can\u2019t believe how much she looks like him\u201d. You hummed as a reply, not wanting to think about it. \u201cI wonder who he\u2019ll look like\u201d you commented, glancing down to your bump, movement visible through your t-shirt. \u201cYou I hope\u201d Taehyung mumbled, pressing a kiss to your shoulder, \u201cGigi, who do you think your baby brother will look like?\u201d Taehyung asked her, smirking as he waited for her reply. She turned around to face the pair of you, smiling cheekily, \u201cME\u201d she shouted, running towards Tae and diving onto him, causing him to groan as she hit his \u2018sensitive area\u2019. \u201cCareful\u201d you told Gi, trying your hardest not to laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s a good job you\u2019re already pregnant, I think Gi may have just ruined the chances of anymore\u201d he joked, face twisting due to the pain he was feeling. You had told her over dinner that she was going to have a baby brother, she took it better than you thought, she had just grinned and tucked into her noodles, maybe she was too young to understand. </p><p>Eventually, Gi had fallen asleep. Normally, she would have been taken to bed earlier in the evening. However, due to Taehyung leaving for the tour, you both decided to spend time as a family, wanting to spend every minute together before he left. She was cuddled into your side, head resting slightly on your bump. She had placed her ear and cheek against your stomach before she had fallen asleep, curious to feel or hear her baby brother. It was the first time she had felt him kick, the feeling causing her to squeal out with happiness, laugh echoing amongst the living room. You brushed your fingers through her hair, looking down at her in awe. \u201cI love her so much Tae\u201d you mumbled, smiling to yourself, \u201cNever felt love like it\u201d. His nose brushed your ear, smiling subtly, \u201cCouldn\u2019t agree more\u201d he whispered, a kiss pressed below your ear. \u201cI\u2019m going to take her up to bed\u201d you said while attempting to feel her off yourself, \u201cHere, I\u2019ll take her\u201d Taehyung offered, whisking her up in one swift and easy motion, in all honesty you were glad, it was proving difficult to carry her with such a huge bump. \u201cNight baby\u201d you mumbled, kissing her mouth that was agape, \u201cMama loves you so much\u201d. He waited until you were finished saying goodnight before he headed up the stairs, ready to tuck her into bed. You knew why he wanted to take her to bed himself, he wanted to make sure she was asleep and safe, he\u2019d be leaving her behind for a few weeks, it was a comfort to him to know that he had put her to bed before he left, it had become a tradition. </p><p>You waited in the bedroom patiently for Taehyung whilst he said goodnight to his daughter. You sat against the headboard, pillows puffed up on both sides, lamps illuminating the bedroom with a soft glow. Moments later, the door creaked open to reveal your fianc\u00e9, shutting the door behind him. \u201cShe\u2019s flat out\u201d he laughed, pulling the covers back before removing his clothes, leaving himself in just his boxers. He was one for sleeping naked, however, since Gi had occasionally snuck into the bed, he thought it was best to sleep in his boxers, just in case there was a surprise intruder. \u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked as he slipped under the duvet, head relaxingly placed against the headboard staring over to you. \u201cI have something for you\u201d you blurted out, ignoring his previous question. \u201cLike what?\u201d he questioned, head still resting comfortably. \u201cHere\u201d you spoke, handing him an A4 envelope. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked, sitting up straight, confused yet intrigued to what the manila envelope held. \u201cOpen it and you\u2019ll find out\u201d you laughed, hitting his foot with your own, your actions causing a small laugh to escape him. The envelope was torn open, anticipation building inside of you as he pulled out various pieces of white paper. He began to read the documents for a few moments, before realising what it was that you had given him. </p><p>\u201cIs this real?\u201d he asked, tears forming in his eyes, \u201cPlease tell me this isn\u2019t a joke?\u201d he cried, hand covering his mouth as he broke down crying. \u201cIt\u2019s for real\u201d you cried, a single tear falling down your cheek. \u201cShe\u2019s going to be mine, officially?\u201d he confirmed, cheeks soaked with his tears, although he was crying, a smile couldn\u2019t help but appear at the thought of Gi officially becoming his daughter, it was adoption papers, you wanted her to be his, to take the same name as her father. \u201cY/N\u201d he cried, putting the papers to one side, tucking his head into your neck, seeking comfort, \u201cShe\u2019s going to be mine\u201d. You cradled him into your neck, one arm rubbing his back whilst the other played with his hair. Kissing his forehead, you smiled against it, a tear dripping onto his nose, \u201cThank you for being her father\u201d you whispered, \u201cShe\u2019ll always be yours\u201d. He smiled against your neck, hand rubbing over you bump, pride building inside of him. Soon his family would be complete, the phrase \u2018The Kims\u2019 spinning around his head, making him laugh slightly. \u201cThank you is all I can manage right now\u201d he confessed, cries still escaping him. So, there you both laid, cuddled into one another lovingly, knowing all too well this would be the last night for a while that he\u2019d be able to hold you. </p><p>-</p><p>The following morning Taehyung buckled himself into the seat of the jet that was taking them to Japan. \u201cHow was your night?\u201d Jungkook asked, yawning after he spoke, it was clear he\u2019d been gaming for most of the night. \u201cI have some news actually\u201d he spoke, glancing to his fellow members, \u201cY/N has given me the adoption rights to Gi, I\u2019ll officially be her father\u2026she\u2019ll be a Kim\u201d he grinned, tears forming once more. Namjoon clapped his hands together for Tae, squeezing his leg firmly, \u201cThat\u2019s great news Tae, honestly, I can\u2019t tell you how happy that makes me, well, all of us I assume\u201d he joked, smiling to him kindly. \u201cAnother Kim\u201d Jin added, him too grinning, \u201cWe\u2019re taking over the world\u201d. The seven of them laughed at Jin\u2019s remark, obviously Jin himself found it the funniest. \u201cWe\u2019re all so pleased for you Tae\u201d Jimin commented, a warming smile radiating as he looked to Tae, who was to his right, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you so happy\u201d. Taehyung plonked his head onto Jimin\u2019s shoulder comfortingly as he clicked the lock button on his phone to see the time, a picture of you and Gi evident as his wallpaper. \u201cThank you\u201d Tae whispered to Jimin as smiled down at his phone. </p><p>For Taehyung didn\u2019t notice the smile on Jimin\u2019s face as he too looked at said photo. It was clear how much Gi was like him, the sight breaking his heart into two, if only Taehyung knew the truth. He knew it was time to accept that both you and Gi would never be his, he was ready to let go. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"270\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4ceaa574bd204e0dd068aebc653e5596/tumblr_inline_prekuaj3pS1wvzgav_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"270\" data-orig-width=\"540\"></figure></p>",

It had been two months since Taehyung had proposed, two months of your two-year old daughter asking to see you ring every five minutes and then throwing a tantrum when she couldn&rsquo;t wear it. She was obsessed. Tae and the rest of BTS were about to embark on the second leg of their tour, worries rushing through his mind that he won&rsquo;t be by your side when you needed him, hoping to god nothing would go wrong while he was away. </p><p>&ldquo;Ready?&rdquo; you asked him, glancing over to Tae sat in the driver&rsquo;s seat, although, he was facing the opposite direction, glancing outside of the window. &ldquo;What if something happens?&rdquo; he mumbled as he bit his thumb nail, voice thick with worry. &ldquo;Tae, don&rsquo;t be silly&rdquo; you whined, rubbing his thigh comfortingly, &ldquo;What makes you think that?&rdquo; you questioned, still rubbing his thigh, waiting patiently to hear his concerns. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I guess I&rsquo;m just frightened because I don&rsquo;t know what to expect, I&rsquo;ve never done this before&rdquo; he spoke, eventually turning around to face you, palm rubbing over your stomach soothingly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just scared that I won&rsquo;t be there when you need me the most and it terrifies me. What if something happens and your alone with Gi?&rdquo; he quizzed you, biting his gum anxiously, hand still glued to your bump protectively. &ldquo;Taehyung listen to me&rdquo; you whispered, index finger lifting his chin, his eyes meeting your own, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be okay, I promise&rdquo; you reassured him, pressing a kiss to his lips softly. &ldquo;But if it isn&rsquo;t you&rsquo;d ring me?&rdquo; he spoke, bottom lip curling slightly. Shaking your head, you couldn&rsquo;t help but let out a laugh, &ldquo;No Taehyung, I wouldn&rsquo;t ring you if I had a concern about our unborn child&rdquo; you teased, tickling his waist playfully. A huge laugh escaped him due to your tickling, his hands prizing yours away from his body, the pair of you sat laughing at one another. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N&rdquo; he whined, making you let go of his hands so his own could cup your face, both of you smiling to one another lovingly. His thumb brushed over your cheek a few times before he pressed a kiss to you lips, &ldquo;I mean it, you will ring me with any concerns, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he asked again, needing to feel reassured once more. &ldquo;I promise&rdquo; you repeated, rubbing your stomach due to the sensation of your child kicking into your ribs, the feeling making your face switch slightly. Grinning, he stared down at your bump, palm resting next to your own, both feeling the life inside of you. &ldquo;For both y/n, that means Gi too&rdquo; he confirmed, kissing your temple once before sitting upright in his seat, igniting the engine, &ldquo;My two babies&rdquo; he whispered, smiling to himself before pulling away, eventually driving to your appointment. </p><p>As you confirmed your name and date of birth to the receptionist, Taehyung&rsquo;s phone began to ring, to which he went outside to answer, he didn&rsquo;t want most the waiting room to hear his conversation. You disappeared into the toilet to do your usual urine sample, returning to the waiting room to see Taehyung sat there, he too must have returned from his phone call. With a sigh you sat down, clutching the sample in your hand. You couldn&rsquo;t help but think of Jimin whenever you visited the hospital for your appointment, hoping to god that the walls didn&rsquo;t remember the memories of the two of you. &ldquo;All okay?&rdquo; you asked Taehyung, rubbing your chest subtly, you were sick of heartburn. &ldquo;Yeah, it was just Jungkook asking if Gi can have some pizza&rdquo; he laughed whilst shaking his head, that&rsquo;s where she was for the day, Uncle Jungkook, or as Gi would say, &ldquo;Unc Kook&rdquo;. &ldquo;Did you say yes?&rdquo; you asked him, raising an eyebrow to him, Taehyung was normally the stricter parent when it came to meal times. &ldquo;I did&rdquo; he replied, pretending to be shocked at his own words, his actions making you roll your eyes sarcastically. </p><p>&ldquo;Miss Forename/Surname&rdquo; called the sonographer, eyes darting around the room in hopes to locate the lady he was calling for. Smiling, you stood up from your seat and headed towards the door that was being held opened for you, Taehyung following your lead. You shuffled onto the bed, pulling up your jumper and pulling your trousers and pants down marginally. &ldquo;Okay then, how have we been y/n? Have we been feeling lots of movement from baby?&rdquo; asked the sonographer whilst he applied the cold lubricant onto your stomach, the feeling making your shiver slightly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been good lately, a lot better than I was in the earlier stages and yes, lots of movement&rdquo; you informed him, laying your head back comfortably. &ldquo;Good, that&rsquo;s what I like to hear&rdquo; he smiled as he gently placed the probe onto the lower part of your stomach, &ldquo;Going to the toilet okay?&rdquo; he asked, eyes scurrying on the screen wanting to get the best view of your baby. Taehyung took his moment to hold your hand, pressing a soft kiss to your palm, lips remained pressed to it. &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; you laughed as Taehyung wiggled his eyebrows. &ldquo;Well, I can assure the both of you that your child is looking very healthy, you&rsquo;re doing a great job&rdquo; the sonographer revealed as he examined the screen, Taehyungs sigh with relief made the both of you laugh, &ldquo;Feeling stressed Daddy?&rdquo; joked the sonographer as he turned the screen to face the pair of you, the view of your baby in clear sight. &ldquo;I did until I saw that&rdquo; Taehyung admitted, a sense of pride and unconditional love washing over him as he looked at his child moving on the screen. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s doing really well, measuring perfectly&rdquo; chirped the sonographer, face dropping when he saw both yours and Taehyung&rsquo;s reactions. &ldquo;A boy?&rdquo; you asked, voice almost a whisper, lump forming in your throat, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re having a boy?&rdquo; you confirmed, squeezing Tae&rsquo;s hand harder than before. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry, I thought you knew&rdquo; he apologised, hand covering his mouth with shock, feeling instantly guilty due to his mistake. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be&rdquo; Taehyung reassured, kissing your hand once more as his eyes filled with tears, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re having a son and our little girl will have a baby brother&hellip;that&rsquo;s all that matters&rdquo;. </p><p>You arrived to Jungkook&rsquo;s apartment, waiting patiently after Taehyung had rang the bell. The thick wooden door opened, Jungkook appearing, Gi attached to his hip. &ldquo;Hi Ma and Da&rdquo; Gi squealed, cuddling herself into Jungkooks neck, pretending to act shy, the three of you rolling your eyes at her antics. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re in the middle of watching Nemo&rdquo; Jungkook told you and Tae, sitting himself and Gi into the corner of his sofa comfortably once more, blanket placed over the two of them. At times, you weren&rsquo;t sure who was the biggest baby, her or JK. So there the four of you sat for the next 45 minutes, watching Finding Nemo. &ldquo;How was the appointment by the way?&rdquo; Jungkook asked, eyes still glued to the tv as he played with Gi&rsquo;s hair, rubbing some of it between his hands so it stood straight into the air, making it look as though she an antenna. &ldquo;Everything is looking healthy&rdquo; Taehyung announced to his friend, a look of pride taking over his face, &ldquo;We also have some news&rdquo; he mumbled, hand rubbing over your bump soothingly, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re having a boy&rdquo;. Even though Jungkook was still heavily invested into the film, his face beamed with happiness, grin spreading across his face, &ldquo;I am so happy for you both&rdquo; he laughed, glancing to you slightly, &ldquo;Your glowing y/n, both of you are&rdquo;. </p><p>As the film progressed, Gi became more and more devoted to the story, realising what was happening to Nemo. &ldquo;Da&rdquo; she whined, standing up from Jungkook and removing herself from the blanket, crawling across the sofa to her father. &ldquo;What is it baby?&rdquo; Taehyung asked, laughing slightly to her current mood. &ldquo;Nemo&rdquo; she cried, tears beginning to fall down her face, head cuddled into his neck. &ldquo;Baby, look, his daddy is there&rdquo; Taehyung whispered in her ear as he rubbed her back, feeling her cry against him, &ldquo;His daddy is there to make it all better, just like me&rdquo;. Halting her cries with a sniff she turned to face the screen, watching intently as Nemo and his father joked around with one another at the end of the film, showing a happy ending. &ldquo;See, everyone is happy now, so please don&rsquo;t be sad baby&rdquo; he mumbled, wiping the tears from her cheeks. She nodded, sniffing hard once more. &ldquo;Come here&rdquo; Taehyung spoke, gathering his sleeve before wiping away the snot from her face. &ldquo;Lovely&rdquo; Jungkook joked, pulling a face as he watched Tae wipe it away with his jumper sleeve. Although, Taehyung wasn&rsquo;t fazed, as long as his baby girl was okay, he didn&rsquo;t care. &ldquo;Shall we go home?&rdquo; you whispered, stroking her cheek with your thumb, &ldquo;Maybe daddy will make his Udon noodles?&rdquo; you teased, raising your eyebrow to Taehyung. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;ll make my girls happy&rdquo; he remarked as he rolled his eyes, he couldn&rsquo;t pretend, it was obvious he&rsquo;d do anything to see his family. </p><p>Taehyung was due to leave for tour in the early hours of the morning, a car was scheduled to come and pick him up around 3am to head to the airport, first stop was Japan. The three of you had had a family night, favourite meal cooked and games were played, the three of you laughing to your hearts content. Gi was currently dancing around the front room, it was clear it was in her genes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking about getting her lessons&rdquo; you stated, watching her prance around angelically, &ldquo;I think she&rsquo;d do well&rdquo;. Taehyung smiled as he watched her in awe, his hand clasping yours, &ldquo;She takes after Jimin that&rsquo;s for sure&rdquo; he joked, placing a kiss to your shoulder, &ldquo;I still can&rsquo;t believe how much she looks like him&rdquo;. You hummed as a reply, not wanting to think about it. &ldquo;I wonder who he&rsquo;ll look like&rdquo; you commented, glancing down to your bump, movement visible through your t-shirt. &ldquo;You I hope&rdquo; Taehyung mumbled, pressing a kiss to your shoulder, &ldquo;Gigi, who do you think your baby brother will look like?&rdquo; Taehyung asked her, smirking as he waited for her reply. She turned around to face the pair of you, smiling cheekily, &ldquo;ME&rdquo; she shouted, running towards Tae and diving onto him, causing him to groan as she hit his &lsquo;sensitive area&rsquo;. &ldquo;Careful&rdquo; you told Gi, trying your hardest not to laugh. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good job you&rsquo;re already pregnant, I think Gi may have just ruined the chances of anymore&rdquo; he joked, face twisting due to the pain he was feeling. You had told her over dinner that she was going to have a baby brother, she took it better than you thought, she had just grinned and tucked into her noodles, maybe she was too young to understand. </p><p>Eventually, Gi had fallen asleep. Normally, she would have been taken to bed earlier in the evening. However, due to Taehyung leaving for the tour, you both decided to spend time as a family, wanting to spend every minute together before he left. She was cuddled into your side, head resting slightly on your bump. She had placed her ear and cheek against your stomach before she had fallen asleep, curious to feel or hear her baby brother. It was the first time she had felt him kick, the feeling causing her to squeal out with happiness, laugh echoing amongst the living room. You brushed your fingers through her hair, looking down at her in awe. &ldquo;I love her so much Tae&rdquo; you mumbled, smiling to yourself, &ldquo;Never felt love like it&rdquo;. His nose brushed your ear, smiling subtly, &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t agree more&rdquo; he whispered, a kiss pressed below your ear. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take her up to bed&rdquo; you said while attempting to feel her off yourself, &ldquo;Here, I&rsquo;ll take her&rdquo; Taehyung offered, whisking her up in one swift and easy motion, in all honesty you were glad, it was proving difficult to carry her with such a huge bump. &ldquo;Night baby&rdquo; you mumbled, kissing her mouth that was agape, &ldquo;Mama loves you so much&rdquo;. He waited until you were finished saying goodnight before he headed up the stairs, ready to tuck her into bed. You knew why he wanted to take her to bed himself, he wanted to make sure she was asleep and safe, he&rsquo;d be leaving her behind for a few weeks, it was a comfort to him to know that he had put her to bed before he left, it had become a tradition. </p><p>You waited in the bedroom patiently for Taehyung whilst he said goodnight to his daughter. You sat against the headboard, pillows puffed up on both sides, lamps illuminating the bedroom with a soft glow. Moments later, the door creaked open to reveal your fianc&eacute;, shutting the door behind him. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s flat out&rdquo; he laughed, pulling the covers back before removing his clothes, leaving himself in just his boxers. He was one for sleeping naked, however, since Gi had occasionally snuck into the bed, he thought it was best to sleep in his boxers, just in case there was a surprise intruder. &ldquo;You okay?&rdquo; he asked as he slipped under the duvet, head relaxingly placed against the headboard staring over to you. &ldquo;I have something for you&rdquo; you blurted out, ignoring his previous question. &ldquo;Like what?&rdquo; he questioned, head still resting comfortably. &ldquo;Here&rdquo; you spoke, handing him an A4 envelope. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked, sitting up straight, confused yet intrigued to what the manila envelope held. &ldquo;Open it and you&rsquo;ll find out&rdquo; you laughed, hitting his foot with your own, your actions causing a small laugh to escape him. The envelope was torn open, anticipation building inside of you as he pulled out various pieces of white paper. He began to read the documents for a few moments, before realising what it was that you had given him. </p><p>&ldquo;Is this real?&rdquo; he asked, tears forming in his eyes, &ldquo;Please tell me this isn&rsquo;t a joke?&rdquo; he cried, hand covering his mouth as he broke down crying. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s for real&rdquo; you cried, a single tear falling down your cheek. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s going to be mine, officially?&rdquo; he confirmed, cheeks soaked with his tears, although he was crying, a smile couldn&rsquo;t help but appear at the thought of Gi officially becoming his daughter, it was adoption papers, you wanted her to be his, to take the same name as her father. &ldquo;Y/N&rdquo; he cried, putting the papers to one side, tucking his head into your neck, seeking comfort, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s going to be mine&rdquo;. You cradled him into your neck, one arm rubbing his back whilst the other played with his hair. Kissing his forehead, you smiled against it, a tear dripping onto his nose, &ldquo;Thank you for being her father&rdquo; you whispered, &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll always be yours&rdquo;. He smiled against your neck, hand rubbing over you bump, pride building inside of him. Soon his family would be complete, the phrase &lsquo;The Kims&rsquo; spinning around his head, making him laugh slightly. &ldquo;Thank you is all I can manage right now&rdquo; he confessed, cries still escaping him. So, there you both laid, cuddled into one another lovingly, knowing all too well this would be the last night for a while that he&rsquo;d be able to hold you. </p><p>-</p><p>The following morning Taehyung buckled himself into the seat of the jet that was taking them to Japan. &ldquo;How was your night?&rdquo; Jungkook asked, yawning after he spoke, it was clear he&rsquo;d been gaming for most of the night. &ldquo;I have some news actually&rdquo; he spoke, glancing to his fellow members, &ldquo;Y/N has given me the adoption rights to Gi, I&rsquo;ll officially be her father&hellip;she&rsquo;ll be a Kim&rdquo; he grinned, tears forming once more. Namjoon clapped his hands together for Tae, squeezing his leg firmly, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s great news Tae, honestly, I can&rsquo;t tell you how happy that makes me, well, all of us I assume&rdquo; he joked, smiling to him kindly. &ldquo;Another Kim&rdquo; Jin added, him too grinning, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re taking over the world&rdquo;. The seven of them laughed at Jin&rsquo;s remark, obviously Jin himself found it the funniest. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all so pleased for you Tae&rdquo; Jimin commented, a warming smile radiating as he looked to Tae, who was to his right, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice to see you so happy&rdquo;. Taehyung plonked his head onto Jimin&rsquo;s shoulder comfortingly as he clicked the lock button on his phone to see the time, a picture of you and Gi evident as his wallpaper. &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; Tae whispered to Jimin as smiled down at his phone. </p><p>For Taehyung didn&rsquo;t notice the smile on Jimin&rsquo;s face as he too looked at said photo. It was clear how much Gi was like him, the sight breaking his heart into two, if only Taehyung knew the truth. He knew it was time to accept that both you and Gi would never be his, he was ready to let go. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4ceaa574bd204e0dd068aebc653e5596/tumblr_inline_prekuaj3pS1wvzgav_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure></p>",
