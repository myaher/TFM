That it only takes a small group to create the perspective that a race is rotten and evil. That the first men, and children will hold what the walkers are by using what a fraction of them did.

Telling him that he and his people do not deserve to live in isolation the way his father wants. He grows to believe this. The first pure is now a teen. Growing his own thoughts and ideas.

Fought back, himself. It was not new to him. But one day. It was not just the small group of rebels that they were used to. This was an army. The greatest army created. Meant for one specific reason- to wipe the walkers out. The teen fought back, but there were too many. He watched the ones he loved be slaughtered. The people he loved and cared for killed for no reason. His people that sought isolation for peace were not even given that. They were hunted.

And we assume that that&rsquo;s what happened. White walkers are robots designed to attack humans&hellip;.But what if that&rsquo;s not what happened. What if the first walker was in fact a Stark and what if the &ldquo;spell&rdquo;, or what have you, that the children gave him wasn&rsquo;t enough. What if the first walker, a Stark, refused to just be a puppet that attacked his own people. That the children were not all that powerful since they were defeated eventually. And what if he wasn&rsquo;t this all powerful being we see in the night king. He&rsquo;s stronger, sure. But can be killed by any weapon. He&rsquo;s a stronger human that looks like a walker, basically. He resists the children and decides to live in isolation rather than attack his own people. He is a Stark and they love their honor don&rsquo;t they?. But eventually the children try their ritual on others. Some do what the first did. Refuse. So the children go after&hellip; less than the noble, and these people, born from tragedy and seek revenge LOVE their new strength, and that&rsquo;s when they start attacking humanity, and eventually their makers. Through the new walkers they have conjured their, and the first men&rsquo;s, own doom. BUT the very first walker fights these new walkers back. He doesn&rsquo;t fight them to end them, but to help them. Helps them to understand that they are puppets to the children. That they are better than being strings to the others. Some walkers he must kill. Some believe what he is saying and join his side&hellip;. But some.. They follow as well, but with motivations to eventually go back and kill every person they can.. The first walker, now the leader of a tribe of walkers has a child. The first pure white walker. His father and mother preach, while their circumstances are terrible, not all of humanity is bad. That it only takes a small group to create the perspective that a race is rotten and evil. That the first men, and children will hold what the walkers are by using what a fraction of them did. Not what the whole of them are. That the first men will not approve of their existence. They warn their son not to use his new found power for harm. For that will prove their point. For they bring the winter. Through this pure born&rsquo;s childhood he discovers how strong his powers can actually be&hellip; He&rsquo;s stronger than the rest.
