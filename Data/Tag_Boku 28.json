He\u2019ll probably flinch away and, quite honestly, ask, \u201cwhat the fuck are you doing?\u201d with wide eyes. Part of him wants to threaten to murder you but then his heart is doing this weird ass thing and his hands kinda feel like jelly and\u2026maybe that was nice?</p><p>\ud83c\udfaeOnce he gets accustomed to being cuddled he\u2019s such a <i>brat</i> about it. He wants you to constantly be touching him at the hideout in some way and will borderline throw fits if you don\u2019t. Obviously he matures with time, but Shigaraki is still such a kid I cannot express that enough.</p><p>\ud83c\udfaeOh, I\u2019m sorry, did\u2026did you just gently touch his hand? Without flinching and looking terrified as you did it? Oh lord he\u2019s gonna have a heart attack<strike> damn can\u2019t believe you just murdered him like that.</strike></p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \ud83c\udfaeDepending on the situation and if he was able to predict that\u2019s where you were going to gently brush your hand against he won\u2019t flinch and will probably just <i>stare</i> at you. Whether it\u2019s creepy or endearing is up to you, but honestly he is just kinda\u2026awe struck, or maybe possibly thinks you\u2019re stupid, but\u2026his heart\u2019s doing that thing again and he\u2019s panicking.</p><p>\ud83c\udfaeHe gets really lonely without you. He\u2019ll never say it, but it\u2019s so obvious and plain to see. Aside from Kurogiri you were about the only person he could actually talk to, and besides, if you managed to stick around long enough you would both be way closer than that. He\u2019d just kinda seem <i>lost</i>, shuffling around, not entirely sure on what to be doing. Dare say it, you might\u2019ve been his <i>player 2</i>. That\u2019s right, not an NPC, not some team member to be sacrificed, his partner in crime.</p><p>\ud83c\udfaeYou can\u2019t hold hands for obvious reasons, but he will always be holding your pinky. Before you his hands were nothing more than a grim reminder of past events and weapons, but having the chance to feel your skin against his, even if it\u2019s just on one finger, while you grin brightly as he does so makes his chest tighten.\u00a0</p><p>\ud83c\udfaeWhenever you kiss him he always has and will always continue to just get really quiet for a moment. You never really question it or ask why, but Shigaraki genuinely just can\u2019t get used to such a sign of affection. He was deprived of it for his entire life, and suddenly there\u2019s you there, showering him with it. He can\u2019t wrap his head around it. <i>Why </i>were you so nice to him?

This current LOV arc is giving us insight on each of these Villains we&rsquo;ve come to love over the last 200+ chapters. However, there had actually been very little background detail on these characters. Shigaraki and Twice were the two we knew the most about, and even then it wasn&rsquo;t as much as we acted like it was. Horikoshi wouldn&rsquo;t be doing an entire arc that frames the LOV as the Heros if he didn&rsquo;t have a huge overall plot reason.</p><p>The new guys (whatever they&rsquo;re called) are far more organized and more powerful than the LOV. By most standards, they are the superior villain group. The whole yakuza Villains were also far more organized and advanced than the LOV. The more villain groups we meet, the more we see the LOV pale in comparison. Yet, the LOV are the central villain group. Why is this? Why is there an entire main villain group instead of just All for One and Shigaraki? Each of the members of LOV could have easily been introduced as one off Villains. But they aren&rsquo;t. They are shown as a league.</p><p>A big part of Bnha is the relationships/dynamics between character and then also the hero society they live in. Class 1A is a league of their own, we see all the time the lasting relationships Deku builds. The dynamics that make the whole series. It&rsquo;s important. Because relationship dynamics are the classic trope of what makes a hero so strong. If someone has the ability to care for others, has something worth losing, it makes them stronger. So - Hori has made it so that the main Villains also experience this.</p><p>This is a group of characters who are hated by the Bnha society. Be it that their quirk isn&rsquo;t strong enough of their quirk isn&rsquo;t socially acceptable, society hates them. Thus they hate society, as it&rsquo;s society that took everything away from them. Then as they found each other, they found people that can be themselves with. A group that accepts them, even if society doesn&rsquo;t. The LOV is joked to be a League of Friendship, and that&rsquo;s not very far off. We see Twice getting over his trauma to save Toga, someone who means a lot to him. We see him go to save everyone, all who he considers friends. There&rsquo;s that one guy who is like the mom of the group, there&rsquo;s been a multitude of times where they save each other. Saving being something not associated with evil. The LOV may be the underdogs to other Villains, but it&rsquo;s because they are the heros of their own story. I have a theory that one day Shigaraki will stand up to All for One, and then truly become the real villain of the story. But he&rsquo;ll be able to do it because he has the LOV backing him up. All for One is NOT protected by the league of friendship dynamics, in fact, he&rsquo;s also the villain to their storyline.</p><p>This current story arc is slowly confirming this theory of mine, and when they defeat this new group who&rsquo;s goal is to exaggerate the parts of society that has demonized/ostracized them, it&rsquo;ll prove exactly what I&rsquo;m fearing. </p><p>So in summation of this haphazard theory, I think the LOV will be the ones to take down All for One, and then become a far worse final villain for Deku and Co. They may be the underdogs of the world, but they are heros of their side of the story.</p><p>Because in the end, there is nothing scarier than a Villain who does have something to lose. </p>",

Horikoshi wouldn&rsquo;t be doing an entire arc that frames the LOV as the Heros if he didn&rsquo;t have a huge overall plot reason.</p><p>The new guys (whatever they&rsquo;re called) are far more organized and more powerful than the LOV. By most standards, they are the superior villain group. The whole yakuza Villains were also far more organized and advanced than the LOV. The more villain groups we meet, the more we see the LOV pale in comparison. Yet, the LOV are the central villain group. Why is this? Why is there an entire main villain group instead of just All for One and Shigaraki? Each of the members of LOV could have easily been introduced as one off Villains. But they aren&rsquo;t. They are shown as a league.</p><p>A big part of Bnha is the relationships/dynamics between character and then also the hero society they live in. Class 1A is a league of their own, we see all the time the lasting relationships Deku builds. The dynamics that make the whole series. It&rsquo;s important. Because relationship dynamics are the classic trope of what makes a hero so strong. If someone has the ability to care for others, has something worth losing, it makes them stronger. So - Hori has made it so that the main Villains also experience this.</p><p>This is a group of characters who are hated by the Bnha society. Be it that their quirk isn&rsquo;t strong enough of their quirk isn&rsquo;t socially acceptable, society hates them. Thus they hate society, as it&rsquo;s society that took everything away from them. Then as they found each other, they found people that can be themselves with. A group that accepts them, even if society doesn&rsquo;t. The LOV is joked to be a League of Friendship, and that&rsquo;s not very far off. We see Twice getting over his trauma to save Toga, someone who means a lot to him. We see him go to save everyone, all who he considers friends. There&rsquo;s that one guy who is like the mom of the group, there&rsquo;s been a multitude of times where they save each other. Saving being something not associated with evil. The LOV may be the underdogs to other Villains, but it&rsquo;s because they are the heros of their own story. I have a theory that one day Shigaraki will stand up to All for One, and then truly become the real villain of the story. But he&rsquo;ll be able to do it because he has the LOV backing him up. All for One is NOT protected by the league of friendship dynamics, in fact, he&rsquo;s also the villain to their storyline.</p><p>This current story arc is slowly confirming this theory of mine, and when they defeat this new group who&rsquo;s goal is to exaggerate the parts of society that has demonized/ostracized them, it&rsquo;ll prove exactly what I&rsquo;m fearing. </p><p>So in summation of this haphazard theory, I think the LOV will be the ones to take down All for One, and then become a far worse final villain for Deku and Co. They may be the underdogs of the world, but they are heros of their side of the story.</p><p>Because in the end, there is nothing scarier than a Villain who does have something to lose. </p></p>",
