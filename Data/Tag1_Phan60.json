It apparently took investigators nearly two weeks to find every piece of his body but were more shocked that Dan and Phil had made it out alive. Phil suffered two broken ribs and a fractured shoulder and some head trauma, but nothing life-threatening. Dan suffered minor head trauma and a broken hand. But they were alive.</p><p>Both boys were commended for their bravery by the MI6 and the FBI and awarded medals in honour of their work of completely exterminate all members of the terrorist groups Ferns Gala and HARNIS. When investigators found the three other bodies under the rubble, still inside the crushed Van, the men were identified to be the remaining members of HARNIS that have been underground for months, uncharted. </p><p>Fast forward two years, Dan and Phil continued to work for MI6, undergoing missions together after their recovery together. They were hesitant at first but realised they loved working together and didn&rsquo;t want to retire just yet. </p><p>Until now.</p><p>\u201cGoing back to Paris for our last mission\u2026 how ironic\u201d Dan laughs as he throws his bags back into the familiar Jet he\u2019s learned to Love. </p><p>\u201cit is a bit, isn\u2019t it? But what a way to end our careers\u201d Phil replies, sitting down in one of the seats. Dan smiles and sits in Phil&rsquo;s lap. </p><p>\u201cretirement at 22 and 24 sounds nice. I can\u2019t believe MI6 is paying us for the rest of our lives\u201d Dan whispers, kissing Phil&rsquo;s cheek. </p><p>\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t think you ever really realised how much you were making from one mission, let alone 28\u201d Phil laughs, grinning as he kisses Dan&rsquo;s lips warmly.</p><p>\u201cbeing a billionaire to-be-retired spy is fun\u201d Dan giggles as he kisses Phil back. </p><p>The past two years have been filled with incredible adventures. It took them all over the world. Such as Tokyo Japan to poison members of the Yakuza, Sydney Australia to arrest members of a massive heist, Ibiza Spain to murder a DJ with a plan of drugging club goers with a smoke machine, Jumping out of a helicopter over top of international waters to stop a cargo ship from delivering some of the most copious amounts of drugs from Colombia to California- and lots more.</p><p>\u201cwheres the briefcase?\u201d Dan asks. Phil looks around for their bags and spots it on the seats next to them. He pulls it over and hands it to Dan. </p><p>Dan unlocks the case and pulls the paper out.</p><p><br/>Objective: an unknown terrorist group is planning to blow up the top of the Eiffel Tower where all satellites are located. If they succeed, it will stop France from having radio and Television contact. You must prevent them before they do so.</p><p>New identity/s: none needed. </p><p>Location: Paris, France. Up to the Eiffel Tower at 23:00 on level 3.</p><p>Good luck, and Thank You 009 and 011 for your service with MI6.</p><p>Dan smiles at the last sentence, leaning back into Phil and humming as Phil presses soft kisses to his neck.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to miss feeling dangerous with you. But I\u2019m excited to retire with you\u201d Dan moves his head to the side, so Phil has more access to his neck. Phil chuckles and nibbles at his skin.</p><p>\u201cme too\u201d Phil whispers, trailing his lips back up to Dan&rsquo;s lips, capturing him in another addictive kiss. </p><p>The jet arrives an hour before their mission, the dark sky and warm air welcoming them to the city. A pickup car was waiting for them to take them back to the very hotel they stayed in together the first day they met. </p><p>\u201cI still think this is the nicest hotel we have stayed at, by far\u201d Dan giggles as he drops his bags on the ground and opens the balcony door, stepping out and looking around. He instantly spots the Eiffel Tower in the darkness, lit up in all its glory. </p><p>\u201cwe have 30 minutes to get ready\u201d Phil checks his watch before unzipping the suit bags. Inside are classic tuxedos, going back to their roots of classy attire and Sophisticated agents. </p><p>\u201cooo these look nice! Are these the suits we wore in Iceland?\u201d Dan asks, picking his own up and admiring the fabric.</p><p>\u201cno, these are brand new apparently\u201d Phil replies, kicking off his shoes and beginning to undo his shirt, letting the fabric stay on his shoulders with his chest exposed as he gets the dress shirt out to put on. Dan walks over to him and runs his hands up his chest.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe this will be it\u2026\u201d Dan mumbles, running his fingertips over the scar on Phil&rsquo;s chest from when he had broken his ribs. Phil brings his hands up to hold Dan\u2019s, rubbing his thumb over the scar on Dan\u2019s wrist.</p><p>\u201csame\u2026\u201d Phil kisses Dan&rsquo;s hands softly, and Dan smiles gently, a blush burning on his cheeks. \u201cbut come on, we need to get ready. We wouldn\u2019t want people to destroy the top of the Eiffel Tower.\u201d</p><p>The boys get dressed into the suits, both looking smart and classy with Dan wearing a red bowtie and Phil wearing Blue. Phil&rsquo;s hair is swept back with his glasses on, while Dan brushes his hair out to make the curls look fluffier and softer, and his cheekbones eventuated with some highlighter. After the trip to Vegas, Dan has discovered he loves makeup, even if it\u2019s simple like a little glitter.</p><p>finally, they stash their guns and knives up their pants and in their blazer pockets before they leave the hotel and begin walking.</p><p>\u201cgod, it&rsquo;s cold\u2026\u201d Dan whispers, rubbing his chilly arms. Phil chuckles and wraps his arm around Dan&rsquo;s body to hold him close. </p><p>\u201cwe will be there shortly, but it will be colder up the top\u201d Phil explains. Dan sighs but nods, snuggling his face closer to Phil as they keep walking. </p><p>They pass many cafe\u2019s and restraints, somehow open at a quarter to 12 at night before they arrive at the checkpoint. </p><p>\u201chow do we get in with the weapons?\u201d Dan asks. Phil leads them over to one of the legs of the Tower, a sandstone base with a security door is hidden away behind trees and shrub. Both boys sneak over to the door, with Phil pulling out a keycard and unlocking the door. They slide inside before heading up in one of the empty elevators, going all the way up to level 3.</p><p>It takes a while for the elevator to arrive, but as soon as it does, they walk out onto the empty deck and look around.</p><p>\u201cdo you see them?\u201d Dan asks quietly, checking behind him and all around them. Phil rubs his arm.</p><p>\u201cno, I don\u2019t\u201d Phil replies as they head further into the deck, to the middle on a ledge.</p><p>\u201cWow, Paris looks gorgeous from up here\u2026\u201d Dan admires the glistening city. Phil smiles and carefully intertwines their fingers. </p><p>\u201cthere\u2019s no threat by the way\u201d Phil replies suddenly. Dan&rsquo;s head snaps to look at Phil in confusion.</p><p>\u201cw-what do you mean? L-like no one is coming, or it was a false alarm or-\u201c Phil laughs at how clueless Dan is acting. </p><p>\u201cQ made it up\u201d Phil chuckles.</p><p>\u201cw-what? Why?\u201d Dan asks. Phil smiles and steps away from Dan for a moment, reaching into his blazer pocket. </p><p>\u201cso I could do this, do what you deserved two years ago, the night we met.\u201d Phil suddenly gets down on one knee, pulling out a small velvet box from his pocket and presenting it to Dan. Dan looks at it confused until it finally clicks in his head what&rsquo;s going on.</p><p>\u201cI want to live the rest of my life with you. You are who I adore the most in life and the only person I\u2019d risk my life to protect, again. Maybe we met in a really inconvenient way, but it doesn&rsquo;t make me treasure you less. We nearly died two years ago, and I\u2019ve been so terrified that you or I would get hurt again, and I\u2019d never get to do this for you. But I love you, I love you with every ounce of my being that it hurts me\u201d Phil flips open the box and reveals the beautiful diamond ring. </p><p>\u201cDaniel James Howell, will you Marry me, and do me the honour of becoming my husband?\u201d Phil asks, tears in his eyes as he looks up at the tears pouring from Dan\u2019s. Dan doesn\u2019t know how to respond, scared he might say the wrong thing, so he nods with a weak smile.</p><p>\u201cyes, oh my god Phil, Yes,\u201d Dan says shakily, trying so hard for his voice not to break. Phil grins with his tearful eyes leaking before slipping the ring onto his finger and standing up, pulling Dan close and attaching their lips in one of the rawest, closest and passionate kisses just as it becomes midnight, and the Eiffel Tower lights up like a million fireflies around them. </p><p>\u201cit took you long enough\u201d Dan jokes when they pull away, Phil laughs and twists Dan around so he was leaning in his arms and Phil leans down to kiss him again, both grinning as they can&rsquo;t get enough of each other. </p><p>their wedding day couldn&rsquo;t come sooner.</p>",

But what a way to end our careers\u201d Phil replies, sitting down in one of the seats. Dan smiles and sits in Phil\u2019s lap. </p><p>\u201cretirement at 22 and 24 sounds nice. I can\u2019t believe MI6 is paying us for the rest of our lives\u201d Dan whispers, kissing Phil\u2019s cheek. </p><p>\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t think you ever really realised how much you were making from one mission, let alone 28\u201d Phil laughs, grinning as he kisses Dan\u2019s lips warmly.</p><p>\u201cbeing a billionaire to-be-retired spy is fun\u201d Dan giggles as he kisses Phil back. </p><p>The past two years have been filled with incredible adventures. It took them all over the world. Such as Tokyo Japan to poison members of the Yakuza, Sydney Australia to arrest members of a massive heist, Ibiza Spain to murder a DJ with a plan of drugging club goers with a smoke machine, Jumping out of a helicopter over top of international waters to stop a cargo ship from delivering some of the most copious amounts of drugs from Colombia to California- and lots more.</p><p>\u201cwheres the briefcase?\u201d Dan asks.

Up to the Eiffel Tower at 23:00 on level 3.</p><p>Good luck, and Thank You 009 and 011 for your service with MI6.</p><p>Dan smiles at the last sentence, leaning back into Phil and humming as Phil presses soft kisses to his neck.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to miss feeling dangerous with you. But I\u2019m excited to retire with you\u201d Dan moves his head to the side, so Phil has more access to his neck. Phil chuckles and nibbles at his skin.</p><p>\u201cme too\u201d Phil whispers, trailing his lips back up to Dan\u2019s lips, capturing him in another addictive kiss. </p><p>The jet arrives an hour before their mission, the dark sky and warm air welcoming them to the city. A pickup car was waiting for them to take them back to the very hotel they stayed in together the first day they met. </p><p>\u201cI still think this is the nicest hotel we have stayed at, by far\u201d Dan giggles as he drops his bags on the ground and opens the balcony door, stepping out and looking around. He instantly spots the Eiffel Tower in the darkness, lit up in all its glory. </p><p>\u201cwe have 30 minutes to get ready\u201d Phil checks his watch before unzipping the suit bags. Inside are classic tuxedos, going back to their roots of classy attire and Sophisticated agents. </p><p>\u201cooo these look nice! Are these the suits we wore in Iceland?\u201d Dan asks, picking his own up and admiring the fabric.</p><p>\u201cno, these are brand new apparently\u201d Phil replies, kicking off his shoes and beginning to undo his shirt, letting the fabric stay on his shoulders with his chest exposed as he gets the dress shirt out to put on. Dan walks over to him and runs his hands up his chest.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe this will be it\u2026\u201d Dan mumbles, running his fingertips over the scar on Phil\u2019s chest from when he had broken his ribs. Phil brings his hands up to hold Dan\u2019s, rubbing his thumb over the scar on Dan\u2019s wrist.</p><p>\u201csame\u2026\u201d Phil kisses Dan\u2019s hands softly, and Dan smiles gently, a blush burning on his cheeks. \u201cbut come on, we need to get ready. We wouldn\u2019t want people to destroy the top of the Eiffel Tower.\u201d</p><p>The boys get dressed into the suits, both looking smart and classy with Dan wearing a red bowtie and Phil wearing Blue. Phil\u2019s hair is swept back with his glasses on, while Dan brushes his hair out to make the curls look fluffier and softer, and his cheekbones eventuated with some highlighter. After the trip to Vegas, Dan has discovered he loves makeup, even if it\u2019s simple like a little glitter.</p><p>finally, they stash their guns and knives up their pants and in their blazer pockets before they leave the hotel and begin walking.</p><p>\u201cgod, it\u2019s cold\u2026\u201d Dan whispers, rubbing his chilly arms. Phil chuckles and wraps his arm around Dan\u2019s body to hold him close. </p><p>\u201cwe will be there shortly, but it will be colder up the top\u201d Phil explains. Dan sighs but nods, snuggling his face closer to Phil as they keep walking. </p><p>They pass many cafe\u2019s and restraints, somehow open at a quarter to 12 at night before they arrive at the checkpoint. </p><p>\u201chow do we get in with the weapons?\u201d Dan asks. Phil leads them over to one of the legs of the Tower, a sandstone base with a security door is hidden away behind trees and shrub. Both boys sneak over to the door, with Phil pulling out a keycard and unlocking the door. They slide inside before heading up in one of the empty elevators, going all the way up to level 3.</p><p>It takes a while for the elevator to arrive, but as soon as it does, they walk out onto the empty deck and look around.</p><p>\u201cdo you see them?\u201d Dan asks quietly, checking behind him and all around them. Phil rubs his arm.</p><p>\u201cno, I don\u2019t\u201d Phil replies as they head further into the deck, to the middle on a ledge.</p><p>\u201cWow, Paris looks gorgeous from up here\u2026\u201d Dan admires the glistening city. Phil smiles and carefully intertwines their fingers. </p><p>\u201cthere\u2019s no threat by the way\u201d Phil replies suddenly.
