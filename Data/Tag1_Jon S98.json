Considering a significant portion of Jon&rsquo;s story is marked by Jon compromising both his own honor and feeling conflicted in his duties, I&rsquo;m not sure she could be much far from the truth.</p><p>There are tons of passages of Jon questioning his own honor&hellip;but what&rsquo;s one of the central&nbsp;&ldquo;questions&rdquo; of the series? It&rsquo;s the question of what you would do when faced with a choice between love and honor. Love is framed as incompatible with Honor and Duty. So where does Jon stand on love?</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fdacc2ccd20ae943ba6f87bd448eba55/tumblr_inline_pos8fw5ebd1v4fp6z_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Jon thinks frequently about Ygritte. He thinks about what he could do to win Val&rsquo;s love, if he chose. He expresses love for his family back home time and time again.&nbsp;</p><p>Jon is even faced with the idea that Love as being incompatible with Honor and Duty by one of the wisest people in the series&hellip;and Jon has fundamentally different thoughts on the matter altogether:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8277cc694cb69e3df9895048bd471703/tumblr_inline_pos8jrO5zv1v4fp6z_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Though Jon wanted to be respectful, he didn&rsquo;t agree in his heart that Love was such a bad thing. To Jon, sacrificing certain portions of his honor and maybe interpreting his duties unconventionally can be worth it if it&rsquo;s in service of protecting people&hellip;and how else can the instinct of&nbsp;&ldquo;protection&rdquo; be characterized other than an act of&nbsp;&ldquo;love&rdquo; at its root?<br /></p><p>What gives Jon such an advantage over people who he must deal with (some having massive power advantages like Mance and Stannis) is their constant inability to properly assess Jon&rsquo;s thought processes and how he often is practicing his own forms of manipulation while they assume he is carbon copy of the honorable and constantly truth Ned Stark; itself a big misnomer knowing the huge lies Ned told the world.</p><p>This is what makes Jon one of the most interesting and misunderstood characters in the series to me. It&rsquo;s not that he&rsquo;s the perfect hero. He&rsquo;s not. He schemes because he must. Kills when he must. Lies when he must. But it&rsquo;s not in pursuit of power or greed. He does what he needs to do to protect people. He loves his family. He&rsquo;s constantly measuring his responses and managing egos. He&rsquo;s Ned&rsquo;s foolish honorable bastard to one person - and a scheming traitorous criminal to another.&nbsp;</p><p>All the while other characters miss the mark and fail to understand what really guides Jon Snow.&nbsp;</p><p>Mel&rsquo;s assertions (which are taken as canonically true by a lot of people) perfectly illustrate this misunderstanding.</p>",
