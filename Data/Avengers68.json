You have grown up hating the idea of marriage, only to be married to the Prince of Braydal, and the future King, Thomas Holland. The both of you are very unwilling partners, and that seems to be the only thing you have in common. It isn\u2019t until things start to crumble around you that you realize there might be more to the cold prince than you thought.</p><p>| <a href=\"https://something-fanfiction-ie.tumblr.com/post/175163145025/daughters-to-wed-prologue-pairing-princetom\">Prologue</a> | <a href=\"https://something-fanfiction-ie.tumblr.com/post/175295469115/daughters-to-wed-one-pairing-princetom-holland\">One</a> | <a href=\"https://something-fanfiction-ie.tumblr.com/post/178302776405/daughters-to-wed-two\">Two</a> | <a href=\"https://something-fanfiction-ie.tumblr.com/post/179477387560/daughters-to-wed-three\">Three</a></p><p>___</p><p>The world froze.</p><p>Time no longer existed as Tom felt a warm liquid soak into his clothing. Blood, in pools this large, was less the bright red it was commonly associated with, and more of a blackish color. His heart felt as if it were beating in slow motion as he tried to push himself up from the carriage floor.</p><p>The crowd outside the carriage was chaos, as men ushered their wives and children into what they deemed as safe places, people screamed, shoes clattered against cobblestone, and horses reared.</p><p>Tom could not focus on anything other than the blood. There was so much blood. Never in his life had he ever seen so much blood. Even, at twelve, when he busted his head on a tree branch goofing around in the woods with Harrison, there had been blood down the side of his face and all over his shirt.</p><p>It felt as if the entire bottom of the carriage had been painted in this iron-smelling, black-red substance. His clothing was heavy with the stuff, seeping through the several layers that he wore. The stench of iron was so thick, that he could taste it in his mouth.</p><p>This moment, just after the gunshot, these few seconds of the young prince sitting in blood, sliding through it to get himself into a sitting position as the people around him went crazy with hysteria, would haunt his nightmares until the day he died.</p><p>Two more gunshots rang loudly over the buzzing of the parade attendees, cutting through the thick cloud muddling Tom\u2019s mind. This time it had been the royal police as they took the shooter to the ground. His hands were secured to his back as a few people weakly cheered.\u00a0</p><p>Meanwhile, Tom had realized that the blood soaking into and through his clothes was your blood. You were splayed out on the floor, staring up at the sky with a blank stare that shook your husband to his very core. It hadn\u2019t even taken a moment from the second he saw you for him to catapult into action.\u00a0</p><p>Shoving his way up to the Coachman\u2019s seat, Tom looked a little bit like a mad man. He was covered in blood, his eyes wild and his hair a mess as he snatched the reins from the unoccupied bench. The coachman had fled to safety beneath the carriage, which was one of the only things that kept Tom from whipping the leather against the mares\u2019 backs and riding back toward the palace.</p><p>\u201cGET OUT FROM UNDERNEATH!\u201d Tom screamed, kicking the wooden front and drawing the attention of the scared onlookers. The coachman scrambled out from the side, splayed out on his back next to the curb of the stone roadway. His lips moved in a stutter, but noise didn\u2019t come out until the Prince snapped the reins and began to maneuver his way through the crowd and the stalled parade.</p><p>\u201cYOUR HIGHNESS!\u201d He yelled, but Tom didn\u2019t stop.</p><p>Even when he got to the palace, the carriage careened into the dirt in front of the steps, kicking up rocks and dust in its violent wake. The horses were still moving when Tom jumped off the side, rolling with the momentum. Jagged rocks scraped through the fabric of his blood soaked clothing. The doors of the palace opened behind him, but he didn\u2019t notice the voices being thrown at his back, all he could think was to get to you.</p><p>Scrambling back onto his feet, a task much easier said than done in his state of mind, Tom threw himself against the carriage door and yanked it open.</p><p>You were as pale, unblinking, and your chest barely moved as you lay helplessly on the floor. Half clambering into the carriage, Tom pulled you into his arms and tried not look back at the puddle of blood collected where you had been. You let out a small gasp as Tom settled back on the ground, which lit a small hope in his heart.</p><p>Just maybe you would be okay.</p><p>Maids and butlers and what appeared to be the entire palace staff had flooded outside and gathered around the both of you. Through the ringing in his ears and the cloud over his head, Tom yelled for them to send for a doctor, a nurse, anything!</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d He pleaded, holding you in his arms, clutching you to his chest as if it would keep your soul from leaving your body.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"85\" data-orig-width=\"640\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8237a8e19a032702e6c7ad61d2bbd1d4/tumblr_pocgp4vwdH1sq4031_640.png\" data-orig-height=\"85\" data-orig-width=\"640\"/></figure><p>\u201cYou, my dear, are very drunk.\u201d Tom looked up into the dark brown eyes of one of his closest friends. He stood in a doorway, the world spinning around him and the only thing to keep him anchored was the wall. Stumbling forward in a drunken stupor, he fell into the long and warm embrace of Lady Coleman.</p><p>Zendaya carried his weight with ease, half carrying and half dragging him through the hall to her sitting room. Once there, she gently coaxed him onto a plush velvet green armchair just in front of a well-lit hearth. Heat came out in waves that warmed his chilled bones. He was drenched in rainwater after the long walk from the tavern to Zendaya\u2019s home. It was nights like this that Tom refused guards and fancy clothes and carriages and, apparently, cloaks. One guard followed him the whole night, poor man. Zendaya was almost positive that all the prince\u2019s guard played rock-paper-scissors or drew straws when it came to deciding who would go out with Tom on his bender. </p><p>Tom has been out drinking, alone, at a tavern close to his friend\u2019s studio flat just outside of the Capital. Zendaya, while technically married to a wealthy man, lived alone. In all the years Tom and Zendaya have known each other, Tom has never met her husband. Rumor had it that he was a gay man and she had no intention to seriously marry at the time. After the wedding, her husband left to travel the world and she stayed, taking up a career in the arts. She was a wonderful dancer and an even better actress. In fact, Tom and Zendaya had actually met after one of her performances just a few years ago.</p><p>At the beginning of their friendship, there had been many rumors that they had become lovers and that the young prince intended to make her his mistress after his wedding. In reality, while Tom was very attracted to her, she was very beautiful, she was also married. There was also the matter of his betrothal, and the small fact that she had made it very clear that she had no need of a man.</p><p>\u201cMy life is good because my husband is never home, what makes you think I want to ruin that by having you, or any other man, in my bed?\u201d Had been her exact words. So, they stayed friends.</p><p>\u201cGod, I hope so, I\u2019ve been drinking for hours.\u201d He raked a hand through his wet curls, which were weighed down with water which dripped from the ends. He stared at the flames in the fireplace as they reached for the top of the chimney. Each lick of orange curved and danced in its brick home, moving in such a captivating manner that for a moment, Tom could see why people were so attracted to pyromania. </p><p>Zendaya shot him a look, walking to the liquor table tucked into the corner of the room, grabbed a glass, and filled it with water. When she walked back over to her very intoxicated friend, she put the glass into his line of sight with a sigh. Snapping to attention, Tom was eye to eye with the glass of water, nodding his appreciation as he took the cup from her outstretched hand.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been married less than a month Tom, usually husbands don\u2019t drink themselves into a stupor until the second wedding anniversary.\u201d Zendaya sat in a chair opposite her guest, looking very regal and proper in her cream nightgown and silk floral dressing robes. She had managed to stuff her hair into a sloppy French twist with a hair pin or two before she had rushed to answer the pounding at her front door. Tom\u2019s lips twitched in amusement when he realized that, even in night clothing, Zendaya looked like the royal in this room, and not him.</p><p>There was a pause as Tom sipped at his water and Zendaya waited, her ankles crossed and her hands folded neatly into her lap. When Tom set his empty cup on the arm of his chair, he launched into a drunken rant on the inner workings of his month-old marriage. Zendaya tried not to think of how wet he was making her furniture as he complained. </p><p>\u201cI cannot stand to be married to her another day! I cannot take it. She has my whole family, and Harrison, and Tessa, wrapped around her finger and I have no idea how. Actually, that\u2019s a lie, I know how she\u2019s done it. She is just as clever as her scheming father!\u201d Tom pointed a drunken finger at nothing in particular. At this point, it felt like he was talking more to himself than to her.</p><p>After about an hour of nodding her head and \u2018Oh yes, I understand\u2019, Tom had slowed down and looked like he was about to fall over in his seat. Zendaya coaxed him to his feet and basically carried his drunken dead weight into her guest room. It took a lot longer than normal as he poked at paintings and pictures framed on the wall. She tried not to feel too bad when he fell into the door jamb so hard that his shoulder would most definitely be bruised. By the time they made it into the room and over to the bed, Zendaya almost cried with relief. Tom was asleep before his body even hit the mattress. Poking her head outside, she quickly informed the royal guard that Tom would be sleeping in her guest bedroom and he was welcome to come inside to keep watch from there.</p><p>The guard followed her inside without any surprise. This was not unusual behavior for the young prince. This was the seventh time Tom had slept in her guest bedroom since the beginning of his marriage. Always drunk, always disheveled, always complaining.</p><p>Zendaya waved goodnight to the guard and then found her way to her own bed where she fell asleep quickly.</p><p>The next morning, Zendaya was surprised to see Tom still in her home. He stood behind the chair he sat in last night, which was still damp given how utterly soaked Tom had been. The fire in the fireplace was out thanks to her maid who had left just after Zendaya had gone to sleep. She always woke up before the maid, Anne, made it back in the morning. Normally it wouldn\u2019t be a problem, but it had been raining for the last week and with the rain came a cold.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re up early.\u201d She said as she entered the room.</p><p>\u201cAs are you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was not the one absolutely pissed last night, either.\u201d She teased, going to sit in the chair she had jokingly deemed as her \u2018Tom-help\u2019 chair given that she always sat in this chair when Tom came to talk to her. No one asked her about it, and she had never told anyone of the nickname she had given the armchair, but it had the name nonetheless. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about that.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAs you should be.\u201d Tom tried, and failed, to fix his clothes a bit. While no longer wet, they were wrinkled from drying on his sleeping body over the last few hours. His hair, having also dried while Tom slept, was a mess of wild chestnut curls. And there, on the top of his right cheek was a print of the pillow or his shirt sleeve or something. He looked very childlike and innocent, causing a twisting feeling in Zendaya\u2019s heart.</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to apologize. This won\u2019t happen again. Thank you, Zendaya.\u201d Now that Tom had slept, drunkenly ranted, and sobered up, he wasn\u2019t giving away anything. Zendaya stood, giving her prince a quick curtsy just before he turned to leave. The guard stood at her doorway, holding a cloak that she hadn\u2019t seen last night but would have been tremendously useful. He held it out for Tom as he neared the exit, taking the cloak and covering himself with it.</p><p>Then, just before he left, Zendaya called out to him. After every visit, she had kept her mouth shut and refused to ask the one question she had been dying to ask. The only thing that had kept her form asking was propriety, but she could no longer keep quiet. Propriety be damned after the seven nights she\u2019d had, housing a drunk prince after he complained about his marriage for an hour or so.</p><p>Tom turned around, the hood of his cloak still down, his eyebrows raised in response.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you\u00a0<i>really</i>\u00a0hate her so much?\u201d</p><p>The question seemed to take Tom by surprise. All this time he had been telling Zendaya how much he hated you. He had been telling Harrison how much he hated you. He had been telling his family how much he hated you, had been telling himself how much he hated you, and somehow Zendaya had known it was bullshit. For a second, Tom was surprised that there could be any other reason to hate you besides the ones he had already given her. He had hated you since that day he saw you in the meadow with your brother. </p><p>And yet, the answer was immediate and painfully honest. It almost stole his breath away as he realized for the first time in a month of marriage, and years of engagement, what he truly felt. Why he chose to be this open with Zendaya but nobody else close to him was beyond any sound logic, but here he was. Laying his heart out for her to see in all it\u2019s odd, complex, and vulnerable glory.</p><p>He grabbed the fabric where his hood met the rest of his cloak and looked her dead in the eyes.</p><p>\u201cBecause I think I love her.\u201d Tom popped the hood over his head and pushed open the door. Zendaya stood in the hallway, mouth slightly agape and eyebrows raised. She almost didn\u2019t believe her own ears. Sure, all this time she knew Tom had been lying about why he hated you, but never had she thought that was the answer. Harrison wouldn\u2019t have been as shocked. He had been saying that Tom secretly loved you since day one. Zendaya, on the other hand, was shocked.</p><p>Shocked, but smiling.</p>",

Like, L O T S. And Tom gets really drunk. And I think like one curse word?</p><p><b>Word Count</b>: 2 ,461</p><p><b>Summary</b>: You are the daughter of a man infamous for having many children, only to marry them off in an effort to climb the social ladder and gain more riches. You have grown up hating the idea of marriage, only to be married to the Prince of Braydal, and the future King, Thomas Holland. The both of you are very unwilling partners, and that seems to be the only thing you have in common. It isn\u2019t until things start to crumble around you that you realize there might be more to the cold prince than you thought.</p><p>| <a href=\"https://something-fanfiction-ie.tumblr.com/post/175163145025/daughters-to-wed-prologue-pairing-princetom\">Prologue</a> | <a href=\"https://something-fanfiction-ie.tumblr.com/post/175295469115/daughters-to-wed-one-pairing-princetom-holland\">One</a> | <a href=\"https://something-fanfiction-ie.tumblr.com/post/178302776405/daughters-to-wed-two\">Two</a> | <a href=\"https://something-fanfiction-ie.tumblr.com/post/179477387560/daughters-to-wed-three\">Three</a></p><p>___</p><p>The world froze.</p><p>Time no longer existed as Tom felt a warm liquid soak into his clothing. Blood, in pools this large, was less the bright red it was commonly associated with, and more of a blackish color. His heart felt as if it were beating in slow motion as he tried to push himself up from the carriage floor.</p><p>The crowd outside the carriage was chaos, as men ushered their wives and children into what they deemed as safe places, people screamed, shoes clattered against cobblestone, and horses reared.</p><p>Tom could not focus on anything other than the blood. There was so much blood. Never in his life had he ever seen so much blood. Even, at twelve, when he busted his head on a tree branch goofing around in the woods with Harrison, there had been blood down the side of his face and all over his shirt.</p><p>It felt as if the entire bottom of the carriage had been painted in this iron-smelling, black-red substance. His clothing was heavy with the stuff, seeping through the several layers that he wore. The stench of iron was so thick, that he could taste it in his mouth.</p><p>This moment, just after the gunshot, these few seconds of the young prince sitting in blood, sliding through it to get himself into a sitting position as the people around him went crazy with hysteria, would haunt his nightmares until the day he died.</p><p>Two more gunshots rang loudly over the buzzing of the parade attendees, cutting through the thick cloud muddling Tom\u2019s mind. This time it had been the royal police as they took the shooter to the ground. His hands were secured to his back as a few people weakly cheered.\u00a0</p><p>Meanwhile, Tom had realized that the blood soaking into and through his clothes was your blood. You were splayed out on the floor, staring up at the sky with a blank stare that shook your husband to his very core. It hadn\u2019t even taken a moment from the second he saw you for him to catapult into action.\u00a0</p><p>Shoving his way up to the Coachman\u2019s seat, Tom looked a little bit like a mad man. He was covered in blood, his eyes wild and his hair a mess as he snatched the reins from the unoccupied bench. The coachman had fled to safety beneath the carriage, which was one of the only things that kept Tom from whipping the leather against the mares\u2019 backs and riding back toward the palace.</p><p>\u201cGET OUT FROM UNDERNEATH!\u201d Tom screamed, kicking the wooden front and drawing the attention of the scared onlookers. The coachman scrambled out from the side, splayed out on his back next to the curb of the stone roadway. His lips moved in a stutter, but noise didn\u2019t come out until the Prince snapped the reins and began to maneuver his way through the crowd and the stalled parade.</p><p>\u201cYOUR HIGHNESS!\u201d He yelled, but Tom didn\u2019t stop.</p><p>Even when he got to the palace, the carriage careened into the dirt in front of the steps, kicking up rocks and dust in its violent wake. The horses were still moving when Tom jumped off the side, rolling with the momentum. Jagged rocks scraped through the fabric of his blood soaked clothing. The doors of the palace opened behind him, but he didn\u2019t notice the voices being thrown at his back, all he could think was to get to you.</p><p>Scrambling back onto his feet, a task much easier said than done in his state of mind, Tom threw himself against the carriage door and yanked it open.</p><p>You were as pale, unblinking, and your chest barely moved as you lay helplessly on the floor. Half clambering into the carriage, Tom pulled you into his arms and tried not look back at the puddle of blood collected where you had been. You let out a small gasp as Tom settled back on the ground, which lit a small hope in his heart.</p><p>Just maybe you would be okay.</p><p>Maids and butlers and what appeared to be the entire palace staff had flooded outside and gathered around the both of you. Through the ringing in his ears and the cloud over his head, Tom yelled for them to send for a doctor, a nurse, anything!</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d He pleaded, holding you in his arms, clutching you to his chest as if it would keep your soul from leaving your body.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"85\" data-orig-width=\"640\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8237a8e19a032702e6c7ad61d2bbd1d4/tumblr_pocgp4vwdH1sq4031_640.png\" data-orig-height=\"85\" data-orig-width=\"640\"></figure><p>\u201cYou, my dear, are very drunk.\u201d Tom looked up into the dark brown eyes of one of his closest friends. He stood in a doorway, the world spinning around him and the only thing to keep him anchored was the wall. Stumbling forward in a drunken stupor, he fell into the long and warm embrace of Lady Coleman.</p><p>Zendaya carried his weight with ease, half carrying and half dragging him through the hall to her sitting room. Once there, she gently coaxed him onto a plush velvet green armchair just in front of a well-lit hearth. Heat came out in waves that warmed his chilled bones.

Blood, in pools this large, was less the bright red it was commonly associated with, and more of a blackish color. His heart felt as if it were beating in slow motion as he tried to push himself up from the carriage floor.</p><p>The crowd outside the carriage was chaos, as men ushered their wives and children into what they deemed as safe places, people screamed, shoes clattered against cobblestone, and horses reared.</p><p>Tom could not focus on anything other than the blood. There was so much blood. Never in his life had he ever seen so much blood. Even, at twelve, when he busted his head on a tree branch goofing around in the woods with Harrison, there had been blood down the side of his face and all over his shirt.</p><p>It felt as if the entire bottom of the carriage had been painted in this iron-smelling, black-red substance. His clothing was heavy with the stuff, seeping through the several layers that he wore. The stench of iron was so thick, that he could taste it in his mouth.</p><p>This moment, just after the gunshot, these few seconds of the young prince sitting in blood, sliding through it to get himself into a sitting position as the people around him went crazy with hysteria, would haunt his nightmares until the day he died.</p><p>Two more gunshots rang loudly over the buzzing of the parade attendees, cutting through the thick cloud muddling Tom\u2019s mind. This time it had been the royal police as they took the shooter to the ground. His hands were secured to his back as a few people weakly cheered.\u00a0</p><p>Meanwhile, Tom had realized that the blood soaking into and through his clothes was your blood. You were splayed out on the floor, staring up at the sky with a blank stare that shook your husband to his very core. It hadn\u2019t even taken a moment from the second he saw you for him to catapult into action.\u00a0</p><p>Shoving his way up to the Coachman\u2019s seat, Tom looked a little bit like a mad man. He was covered in blood, his eyes wild and his hair a mess as he snatched the reins from the unoccupied bench. The coachman had fled to safety beneath the carriage, which was one of the only things that kept Tom from whipping the leather against the mares\u2019 backs and riding back toward the palace.</p><p>\u201cGET OUT FROM UNDERNEATH!\u201d Tom screamed, kicking the wooden front and drawing the attention of the scared onlookers. The coachman scrambled out from the side, splayed out on his back next to the curb of the stone roadway. His lips moved in a stutter, but noise didn\u2019t come out until the Prince snapped the reins and began to maneuver his way through the crowd and the stalled parade.</p><p>\u201cYOUR HIGHNESS!\u201d He yelled, but Tom didn\u2019t stop.</p><p>Even when he got to the palace, the carriage careened into the dirt in front of the steps, kicking up rocks and dust in its violent wake. The horses were still moving when Tom jumped off the side, rolling with the momentum. Jagged rocks scraped through the fabric of his blood soaked clothing. The doors of the palace opened behind him, but he didn\u2019t notice the voices being thrown at his back, all he could think was to get to you.</p><p>Scrambling back onto his feet, a task much easier said than done in his state of mind, Tom threw himself against the carriage door and yanked it open.</p><p>You were as pale, unblinking, and your chest barely moved as you lay helplessly on the floor. Half clambering into the carriage, Tom pulled you into his arms and tried not look back at the puddle of blood collected where you had been. You let out a small gasp as Tom settled back on the ground, which lit a small hope in his heart.</p><p>Just maybe you would be okay.</p><p>Maids and butlers and what appeared to be the entire palace staff had flooded outside and gathered around the both of you. Through the ringing in his ears and the cloud over his head, Tom yelled for them to send for a doctor, a nurse, anything!</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d He pleaded, holding you in his arms, clutching you to his chest as if it would keep your soul from leaving your body.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"85\" data-orig-width=\"640\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8237a8e19a032702e6c7ad61d2bbd1d4/tumblr_pocgp4vwdH1sq4031_640.png\" data-orig-height=\"85\" data-orig-width=\"640\"></figure><p>\u201cYou, my dear, are very drunk.\u201d Tom looked up into the dark brown eyes of one of his closest friends. He stood in a doorway, the world spinning around him and the only thing to keep him anchored was the wall. Stumbling forward in a drunken stupor, he fell into the long and warm embrace of Lady Coleman.</p><p>Zendaya carried his weight with ease, half carrying and half dragging him through the hall to her sitting room. Once there, she gently coaxed him onto a plush velvet green armchair just in front of a well-lit hearth. Heat came out in waves that warmed his chilled bones. He was drenched in rainwater after the long walk from the tavern to Zendaya\u2019s home. It was nights like this that Tom refused guards and fancy clothes and carriages and, apparently, cloaks. One guard followed him the whole night, poor man. Zendaya was almost positive that all the prince\u2019s guard played rock-paper-scissors or drew straws when it came to deciding who would go out with Tom on his bender. </p><p>Tom has been out drinking, alone, at a tavern close to his friend\u2019s studio flat just outside of the Capital. Zendaya, while technically married to a wealthy man, lived alone. In all the years Tom and Zendaya have known each other, Tom has never met her husband. Rumor had it that he was a gay man and she had no intention to seriously marry at the time. After the wedding, her husband left to travel the world and she stayed, taking up a career in the arts. She was a wonderful dancer and an even better actress. In fact, Tom and Zendaya had actually met after one of her performances just a few years ago.</p><p>At the beginning of their friendship, there had been many rumors that they had become lovers and that the young prince intended to make her his mistress after his wedding. In reality, while Tom was very attracted to her, she was very beautiful, she was also married. There was also the matter of his betrothal, and the small fact that she had made it very clear that she had no need of a man.</p><p>\u201cMy life is good because my husband is never home, what makes you think I want to ruin that by having you, or any other man, in my bed?\u201d Had been her exact words. So, they stayed friends.</p><p>\u201cGod, I hope so, I\u2019ve been drinking for hours.\u201d He raked a hand through his wet curls, which were weighed down with water which dripped from the ends. He stared at the flames in the fireplace as they reached for the top of the chimney. Each lick of orange curved and danced in its brick home, moving in such a captivating manner that for a moment, Tom could see why people were so attracted to pyromania. </p><p>Zendaya shot him a look, walking to the liquor table tucked into the corner of the room, grabbed a glass, and filled it with water. When she walked back over to her very intoxicated friend, she put the glass into his line of sight with a sigh. Snapping to attention, Tom was eye to eye with the glass of water, nodding his appreciation as he took the cup from her outstretched hand.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been married less than a month Tom, usually husbands don\u2019t drink themselves into a stupor until the second wedding anniversary.\u201d Zendaya sat in a chair opposite her guest, looking very regal and proper in her cream nightgown and silk floral dressing robes. She had managed to stuff her hair into a sloppy French twist with a hair pin or two before she had rushed to answer the pounding at her front door. Tom\u2019s lips twitched in amusement when he realized that, even in night clothing, Zendaya looked like the royal in this room, and not him.</p><p>There was a pause as Tom sipped at his water and Zendaya waited, her ankles crossed and her hands folded neatly into her lap. When Tom set his empty cup on the arm of his chair, he launched into a drunken rant on the inner workings of his month-old marriage. Zendaya tried not to think of how wet he was making her furniture as he complained. </p><p>\u201cI cannot stand to be married to her another day! I cannot take it. She has my whole family, and Harrison, and Tessa, wrapped around her finger and I have no idea how. Actually, that\u2019s a lie, I know how she\u2019s done it. She is just as clever as her scheming father!\u201d Tom pointed a drunken finger at nothing in particular. At this point, it felt like he was talking more to himself than to her.</p><p>After about an hour of nodding her head and \u2018Oh yes, I understand\u2019, Tom had slowed down and looked like he was about to fall over in his seat. Zendaya coaxed him to his feet and basically carried his drunken dead weight into her guest room. It took a lot longer than normal as he poked at paintings and pictures framed on the wall. She tried not to feel too bad when he fell into the door jamb so hard that his shoulder would most definitely be bruised. By the time they made it into the room and over to the bed, Zendaya almost cried with relief. Tom was asleep before his body even hit the mattress. Poking her head outside, she quickly informed the royal guard that Tom would be sleeping in her guest bedroom and he was welcome to come inside to keep watch from there.</p><p>The guard followed her inside without any surprise. This was not unusual behavior for the young prince. This was the seventh time Tom had slept in her guest bedroom since the beginning of his marriage. Always drunk, always disheveled, always complaining.</p><p>Zendaya waved goodnight to the guard and then found her way to her own bed where she fell asleep quickly.</p><p>The next morning, Zendaya was surprised to see Tom still in her home. He stood behind the chair he sat in last night, which was still damp given how utterly soaked Tom had been. The fire in the fireplace was out thanks to her maid who had left just after Zendaya had gone to sleep. She always woke up before the maid, Anne, made it back in the morning. Normally it wouldn\u2019t be a problem, but it had been raining for the last week and with the rain came a cold.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re up early.\u201d She said as she entered the room.</p><p>\u201cAs are you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was not the one absolutely pissed last night, either.\u201d She teased, going to sit in the chair she had jokingly deemed as her \u2018Tom-help\u2019 chair given that she always sat in this chair when Tom came to talk to her. No one asked her about it, and she had never told anyone of the nickname she had given the armchair, but it had the name nonetheless. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about that.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAs you should be.\u201d Tom tried, and failed, to fix his clothes a bit. While no longer wet, they were wrinkled from drying on his sleeping body over the last few hours. His hair, having also dried while Tom slept, was a mess of wild chestnut curls. And there, on the top of his right cheek was a print of the pillow or his shirt sleeve or something. He looked very childlike and innocent, causing a twisting feeling in Zendaya\u2019s heart.</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to apologize. This won\u2019t happen again. Thank you, Zendaya.\u201d Now that Tom had slept, drunkenly ranted, and sobered up, he wasn\u2019t giving away anything. Zendaya stood, giving her prince a quick curtsy just before he turned to leave. The guard stood at her doorway, holding a cloak that she hadn\u2019t seen last night but would have been tremendously useful. He held it out for Tom as he neared the exit, taking the cloak and covering himself with it.</p><p>Then, just before he left, Zendaya called out to him. After every visit, she had kept her mouth shut and refused to ask the one question she had been dying to ask. The only thing that had kept her form asking was propriety, but she could no longer keep quiet. Propriety be damned after the seven nights she\u2019d had, housing a drunk prince after he complained about his marriage for an hour or so.</p><p>Tom turned around, the hood of his cloak still down, his eyebrows raised in response.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you\u00a0<i>really</i>\u00a0hate her so much?\u201d</p><p>The question seemed to take Tom by surprise. All this time he had been telling Zendaya how much he hated you. He had been telling Harrison how much he hated you. He had been telling his family how much he hated you, had been telling himself how much he hated you, and somehow Zendaya had known it was bullshit. For a second, Tom was surprised that there could be any other reason to hate you besides the ones he had already given her. He had hated you since that day he saw you in the meadow with your brother. </p><p>And yet, the answer was immediate and painfully honest. It almost stole his breath away as he realized for the first time in a month of marriage, and years of engagement, what he truly felt. Why he chose to be this open with Zendaya but nobody else close to him was beyond any sound logic, but here he was. Laying his heart out for her to see in all it\u2019s odd, complex, and vulnerable glory.</p><p>He grabbed the fabric where his hood met the rest of his cloak and looked her dead in the eyes.</p><p>\u201cBecause I think I love her.\u201d Tom popped the hood over his head and pushed open the door. Zendaya stood in the hallway, mouth slightly agape and eyebrows raised. She almost didn\u2019t believe her own ears. Sure, all this time she knew Tom had been lying about why he hated you, but never had she thought that was the answer. Harrison wouldn\u2019t have been as shocked. He had been saying that Tom secretly loved you since day one. Zendaya, on the other hand, was shocked.</p><p>Shocked, but smiling.</p></p>",

Sure, all this time she knew Tom had been lying about why he hated you, but never had she thought that was the answer. Harrison wouldn&rsquo;t have been as shocked. He had been saying that Tom secretly loved you since day one. Zendaya, on the other hand, was shocked.</p><p>Shocked, but smiling.</p></p>",

Harry wrapped an arm around my shoulders. As people greeted us with Lei\u2019s. We got to our Airbnb and it was huge and the view was beautiful. The waves hit the shore lightly. The sun was hot as it hit my face as I was admiring the view. </p><p>\u201c I\u2019m about to say this now! No science,school and no homework talk while we\u2019re in vacaction.\u201d I announced to all of them. I pulled peter aside.</p><p>\u201c no spiderman unless it\u2019s extremely necessary.\u201d I quietly say to him. </p><p>\u201c I know I was thinking of that too.\u201d </p><p>We were sitting at beach as some of us sunbathed and the others were in the water.  </p><p>\u201c hey Alexandria can you like provide some shade over here.\u201d Ned said from his chair. </p><p>\u201c Ned I can\u2019t control the shadows and unless you want the whole tree on you then I cant do much sorry.\u201d </p><p>I looked over at Harry and noticed that he was sleeping. I think. Hard to tell with his sunglasses on. I sat up and had the great idea of splashing him with water. I layed back down and acted like I knew nothing. I saw him come up to me. He was soaked. </p><p>\u201c I knew it was you. Unless water somehow now flys.\u201d </p><p>\u201c Me?! Never&hellip;\u201d I tried so hard to keep from bursting out of laughter. As he had an eyebrow raised waiting for me to admit it. </p><p>\u201c you\u2019re a bad liar you know that.\u201d He said as he laughed and picked me up and then jumped into the water together. </p><p>\u201c you look amazing in that bikini.\u201d  He said with a smirk as he put a strand of hair behind my ear. </p><p>\u201c and you look amazing in that bathing suit.\u201d I told him. </p><p>\u201c yours would look better on my floor.\u201d He said with a cocky smile. I just smiled and pretended that I was about to kiss him before I pushed him into the water.  </p><p>The rest of the day we enjoyed the sun as we played volleyball. Which they made a power free zone.Unfair.  At night we watched movies as we ate junk food. The day after went out to the town looking like total tourist. As we stopped to look at the stores and stopped to get snacks that the street vendors would sell. </p><p>We did a whole bunch of activity\u2019s while we were here. Not letting a day go to waste. We went snorkling. We hiked behind waterfalls. And went to a Luau. Michelle , Gwen and I made a bet against the boys which they lost making them dance the hula  just like the dancers did. It was a very funny view as they attempted to keep up. </p><p>\u201c okay look this is how you were supposed to do it.\u201d I told Harry as I attempted to hula dance. He couldn\u2019t help but laugh as watched me fail. We were out on a date watching the sun go down by the water. </p><p>\u201c I totally rock I think I should become a professional hula dancer.\u201d </p><p>\u201c I would love to see that.\u201d He said joking around. </p><p>\u201c I\u2019m serious I\u2019m quitting the avengers to become a hula dancer.\u201d We just bursted out laughing as I finished the sentence. I sat by him as I leaned my head on his shoulder as he wrapped his around my shoulder. As we watched the sun go down. The waves very lightly hitting the shore. </p><p>\u201c I could stay here forever.\u201d I quietly told him.</p><p>\u201c I could too.\u201d </p><p>We both watched the sunset enjoying each other\u2019s company. I wish the moments lasted forever. Seeing everyone laugh, smile, and have fun. I wish that my Dad was here too. He for sure needs a long vacation. I know he would enjoy it. These moments are the moments I cherish. Because I know that they don\u2019t last. </p><p>~</p><p>I was eating breakfast with Gwen as we waited  for the others to get up. </p><p>\u201c I do have to say that Peter is very cute.\u201d She quietly said just in case the others heard her. </p><p>\u201c you think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201c yea he is no wonder you liked him before.\u201d </p><p>\u201c hmm well if wasn\u2019t talking with Mj i would totally love for you guys to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201c yea I know.\u201d </p><p>\u201c Guys! It\u2019s snowing!\u201d Ned yelled as he came out of his room. Gwen and I got up from our seats and ran to the balcony. </p><p>\u201c what the hell.\u201d I mumbled. The rest came out looking confused at the sudden change of weather. We turned on the news to know more of what was going on but there was nothing. It didn\u2019t show that it was snowing. All the doors suddenly burst open as the cold snow air came inside. </p><p>\u201c is this a blizzard?\u201d Harry asked. </p><p>Peter and I looked at eachother knowing what was happening. We went outside to see better of what was going on. As I was outside I was suddenly thrown across the beach with snowy wind. </p><p><i>What the fuck</i>. </p><p>I got up and saw a man in suit. He came to me and tried to grab me with what seemed to be an ice slide? But before he got me I melted it with fire. As he got up again I used the wind to get the sand and sent him flying into the water. I raised the water up creating a big wave out of it and then swirling it around him. Trapping him inside. But he turned it into ice and sent it flying me way . I got out of the way as I melted it. He came to me with ice and had his phone camera pointing at me. </p><p>\u201c we\u2019re live why don\u2019t you say hi to your father.\u201d He said. I just looked at him confused. </p><p><i>Who is this man?</i></p><p>\u201c you made me life hell by taking everything From me so now I\u2019m going take everything from you.\u201d He continued saying to the phone. He tried blasting me with ice but I used my fire and melted it but he kept blasting it. Causing us to be playing some sort of tug of war with our powers. It started to get me tired and angry so I used both hands and blasted him with fire sending him flying across. He got back up and went for his phone. </p><p>\u201c what is your deal?\u201d I asked. </p><p>\u201c of course your dad hasn\u2019t told you about me. My name is Gregor Shapanka. But my friends call me Blizzard.\u201d </p><p>\u201c doesn\u2019t seem like you have many because Ive never heard of you.\u201d </p><p>He laughed a little. Before he tried to attack me again. </p><p>\u201c enough!! of this Cat and mouse game!! Say bye to your daughter tony.\u201d He then threw his phone and started creating a bigger blizzard. </p><p>\u201c Alexandria! The suit! Destroy his suit!\u201d I heard Gwen say in the distance. </p><p>I floated up and raised my hands as the clouds became dark and my eyes turned white. The thunder now being heard in the sky.</p><p>\u201c like you said enough of this game!\u201d I then used a lightening strike and shot it at his suit. He instantly fell causing the blizzard to stop. </p><p>I got down to the ground my eyes turning their normal brown as the clouds disappeared. I went to the Blizzard guy and saw as his suit was smoking. He groaned in pain as he slowly sat up. I surrounded him with fire so he wouldn\u2019t be able to leave before they could take him away. </p><p>My dad then called asking if I was okay. I had to reassure him that I was and that It was really nothing. He wanted to come but I told him that I got everything under control. </p><p>We all went back home still a little shocked at the recent events. </p><p>\u201c how did you know about the suit?\u201d Peter asked Gwen. </p><p>\u201c it was easy. His suit was bulky and every time he would use his power it would glow from his hands.\u201d </p><p>\u201c thank you for that.\u201d I told her. </p><p>\u201c it was nothing just helping out.\u201d </p><p>\u201c well this wasn\u2019t a bad last morning here.\u201d Ned said.</p><p>\u201c right.\u201d Harry agreed. </p><p>We all just laughed at what Ned had said. It was true it wasn\u2019t that bad. It was kind of cool. This was going to be day to remember. </p><p><br/></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/69341351aa60cd4c41999cebdaf54750/tumblr_pochhe5R6Z1wxit6k_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"/></figure><p>( A/N- yet another fancast.

I surrounded him with fire so he wouldn\u2019t be able to leave before they could take him away. </p><p>My dad then called asking if I was okay. I had to reassure him that I was and that It was really nothing.

Harry wrapped an arm around my shoulders. As people greeted us with Lei&rsquo;s. We got to our Airbnb and it was huge and the view was beautiful. The waves hit the shore lightly. The sun was hot as it hit my face as I was admiring the view. </p><p>&ldquo; I&rsquo;m about to say this now! No science,school and no homework talk while we&rsquo;re in vacaction.&rdquo; I announced to all of them. I pulled peter aside.</p><p>&ldquo; no spiderman unless it&rsquo;s extremely necessary.&rdquo; I quietly say to him. </p><p>&ldquo; I know I was thinking of that too.&rdquo; </p><p>We were sitting at beach as some of us sunbathed and the others were in the water.  </p><p>&ldquo; hey Alexandria can you like provide some shade over here.&rdquo; Ned said from his chair. </p><p>&ldquo; Ned I can&rsquo;t control the shadows and unless you want the whole tree on you then I cant do much sorry.&rdquo; </p><p>I looked over at Harry and noticed that he was sleeping. I think. Hard to tell with his sunglasses on. I sat up and had the great idea of splashing him with water. I layed back down and acted like I knew nothing. I saw him come up to me. He was soaked. </p><p>&ldquo; I knew it was you. Unless water somehow now flys.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo; Me?! Never&hellip;&rdquo; I tried so hard to keep from bursting out of laughter. As he had an eyebrow raised waiting for me to admit it. </p><p>&ldquo; you&rsquo;re a bad liar you know that.&rdquo; He said as he laughed and picked me up and then jumped into the water together. </p><p>&ldquo; you look amazing in that bikini.&rdquo;  He said with a smirk as he put a strand of hair behind my ear. </p><p>&ldquo; and you look amazing in that bathing suit.&rdquo; I told him. </p><p>&ldquo; yours would look better on my floor.&rdquo; He said with a cocky smile. I just smiled and pretended that I was about to kiss him before I pushed him into the water.  </p><p>The rest of the day we enjoyed the sun as we played volleyball. Which they made a power free zone.Unfair.  At night we watched movies as we ate junk food. The day after went out to the town looking like total tourist. As we stopped to look at the stores and stopped to get snacks that the street vendors would sell. </p><p>We did a whole bunch of activity&rsquo;s while we were here. Not letting a day go to waste. We went snorkling. We hiked behind waterfalls. And went to a Luau. Michelle , Gwen and I made a bet against the boys which they lost making them dance the hula  just like the dancers did. It was a very funny view as they attempted to keep up. </p><p>&ldquo; okay look this is how you were supposed to do it.&rdquo; I told Harry as I attempted to hula dance. He couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh as watched me fail. We were out on a date watching the sun go down by the water. </p><p>&ldquo; I totally rock I think I should become a professional hula dancer.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo; I would love to see that.&rdquo; He said joking around. </p><p>&ldquo; I&rsquo;m serious I&rsquo;m quitting the avengers to become a hula dancer.&rdquo; We just bursted out laughing as I finished the sentence. I sat by him as I leaned my head on his shoulder as he wrapped his around my shoulder. As we watched the sun go down. The waves very lightly hitting the shore. </p><p>&ldquo; I could stay here forever.&rdquo; I quietly told him.</p><p>&ldquo; I could too.&rdquo; </p><p>We both watched the sunset enjoying each other&rsquo;s company. I wish the moments lasted forever. Seeing everyone laugh, smile, and have fun. I wish that my Dad was here too. He for sure needs a long vacation. I know he would enjoy it. These moments are the moments I cherish. Because I know that they don&rsquo;t last. </p><p>~</p><p>I was eating breakfast with Gwen as we waited  for the others to get up. </p><p>&ldquo; I do have to say that Peter is very cute.&rdquo; She quietly said just in case the others heard her. </p><p>&ldquo; you think so?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo; yea he is no wonder you liked him before.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo; hmm well if wasn&rsquo;t talking with Mj i would totally love for you guys to talk.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo; yea I know.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo; Guys! It&rsquo;s snowing!&rdquo; Ned yelled as he came out of his room. Gwen and I got up from our seats and ran to the balcony. </p><p>&ldquo; what the hell.&rdquo; I mumbled. The rest came out looking confused at the sudden change of weather. We turned on the news to know more of what was going on but there was nothing. It didn&rsquo;t show that it was snowing. All the doors suddenly burst open as the cold snow air came inside. </p><p>&ldquo; is this a blizzard?&rdquo; Harry asked. </p><p>Peter and I looked at eachother knowing what was happening. We went outside to see better of what was going on. As I was outside I was suddenly thrown across the beach with snowy wind. </p><p><i>What the fuck</i>. </p><p>I got up and saw a man in suit. He came to me and tried to grab me with what seemed to be an ice slide? But before he got me I melted it with fire. As he got up again I used the wind to get the sand and sent him flying into the water. I raised the water up creating a big wave out of it and then swirling it around him. Trapping him inside. But he turned it into ice and sent it flying me way . I got out of the way as I melted it. He came to me with ice and had his phone camera pointing at me. </p><p>&ldquo; we&rsquo;re live why don&rsquo;t you say hi to your father.&rdquo; He said. I just looked at him confused. </p><p><i>Who is this man?</i></p><p>&ldquo; you made me life hell by taking everything From me so now I&rsquo;m going take everything from you.&rdquo; He continued saying to the phone. He tried blasting me with ice but I used my fire and melted it but he kept blasting it. Causing us to be playing some sort of tug of war with our powers. It started to get me tired and angry so I used both hands and blasted him with fire sending him flying across. He got back up and went for his phone. </p><p>&ldquo; what is your deal?&rdquo; I asked. </p><p>&ldquo; of course your dad hasn&rsquo;t told you about me. My name is Gregor Shapanka. But my friends call me Blizzard.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo; doesn&rsquo;t seem like you have many because Ive never heard of you.&rdquo; </p><p>He laughed a little. Before he tried to attack me again. </p><p>&ldquo; enough!! of this Cat and mouse game!! Say bye to your daughter tony.&rdquo; He then threw his phone and started creating a bigger blizzard. </p><p>&ldquo; Alexandria! The suit! Destroy his suit!&rdquo; I heard Gwen say in the distance. </p><p>I floated up and raised my hands as the clouds became dark and my eyes turned white. The thunder now being heard in the sky.</p><p>&ldquo; like you said enough of this game!&rdquo; I then used a lightening strike and shot it at his suit. He instantly fell causing the blizzard to stop. </p><p>I got down to the ground my eyes turning their normal brown as the clouds disappeared. I went to the Blizzard guy and saw as his suit was smoking. He groaned in pain as he slowly sat up. I surrounded him with fire so he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to leave before they could take him away. </p><p>My dad then called asking if I was okay. I had to reassure him that I was and that It was really nothing. He wanted to come but I told him that I got everything under control. </p><p>We all went back home still a little shocked at the recent events. </p><p>&ldquo; how did you know about the suit?&rdquo; Peter asked Gwen. </p><p>&ldquo; it was easy.
