        "body": "<p>Although having lost his rider, Drogon remains galvanized by the fury of the fight against his dragon brother. Viserion closes his mouth on the left wing of Drogon and the two flying creatures start an aerial balet and fall faster and faster, towards the red dungeon.<br/>From the throne room, Brienne, Bronn, and Sandor, through a window, perceive with horror the imminent arrival of the two dragons towards them, and hasten to leave the throne room, while carrying with them the body of Jaime.<br/>In the anarchic melee, Drogon in a momentum manages to bite and close his jaws on the neck of Viserion, and tightening more and more, literally tries to tear his brother&rsquo;s head off. Seeing the impact more and more imminent, the Night King jumps from Viserion and lands on his feet on the cobblestones of a street, in the middle of the carnage orchestrated by his own troops. Biting each other, Drogon and Viserion, in a last breath of common flames, collide with the roof of the throne room and destroy a large part of it. In the impact, Drogon managed to pull off Viserion&rsquo;s head, killing him once and for all, but the big dragon suffered terribly from the shock and moans weakly in the middle of the rubble.<br/>*********<br/>Daenerys survived her fall, dampened by the providencial presence of a big canvas from a shopkeeper&rsquo;s stall in a commercial street. Yet sounded, she watched helplessly and horrified the fall of the two dragons in the red dungeon, which plunges her back a brief moment in her vision of the hall of the destroyed iron throne room.<br/>Slightly limping, the queen of dragons roam among the streets, contemplating the chaos around her. In order to better protect herself, she seizes an abandoned sword on the ground. In the midst of cries, she suddenly hears a familiar voice.<br/>_ &ldquo;Khaleesi!&rdquo;<br/>Jorah appears, repeling a few wights in his path, and ends up joining the young queen, more than happy to see him. A wight, however, disrupts the reunion by jumping on Jorah, but Daenerys kills him by piercing his skull with the weapon picked up earlier. Jorah thanks Daenerys and brings her in the direction of the port.<br/>On his side, the Night King makes his way in the streets and armed with his sword of ice, massacres all the inhabitants and the soldiers within his reach, while continuing to raise the dead with his terrible power. That&rsquo;s when he comes face to face with Ser Jorah and Daenerys. Immediately, Jorah works to protect his queen and blocks the first sword&rsquo;s blow of the terrible ice king. Jorah in turn tries a riposte, but is easily countered by the monster. Daenerys refuses to see her friend risk his life alone and tries to attack the Night King by the side with her sword. But by his superhuman reflexes, the king of the walkers blocks with one hand the blade of the young queen and looks at her with his sharp blue eye. With a simple gesture, he pushes her back with incredible violence, making her fall to the ground. Seeing this, Jorah tries a final stab, but the Night King avoids it again, passing behind Jorah and with his ice sword, strikes the Andal knight&rsquo;s back all the way up and down, leaving him a deep bloody slash. Daenerys lets out a scream as Jorah, hit hard, falls to one knee on the ground, under the impassive gaze of the Night King. Daenerys rushes to Ser Jorah, and with the energy of desperation, manages to raise him up and take him with her in the opposite direction.<br/>The Night King begins to follow them to finish them, but soon he seems to give up and turns his cold eyes towards the partially destroyed red dungeon. Drogon does not seem to have recovered from the fall. The Night King then begins his decided march towards the red dungeon to finish Drogon himself and make him his new undead dragon.<br/>*********<br/>For their part, Daenerys, supporting her friend knight as much as possible, continues to advance as fast as possible in the middle of the chaotic streets. Everywhere around them, the cries of the living and the howling of zombies resound, as do the incessant sounds of slaughter. Daenerys and Jorah are forced to make a detour through an alleyway to find the street in front of them suddenly being invaded by the undead, raging on the Lannister soldiers and the inhabitants present. A giant, with a huge wooden mass, hammered relentlessly in front of him, striking and throwing several Lannister soldiers into the air or against the walls of the houses. Daenerys and Jorah manage to sneak into the alley without the giant noticing their presence and the latter, uttering a bestial roar, continues his slaughter.<br/>_ &ldquo;Khaleesi &hellip;&rdquo; manages to articulate Jorah in an impetus of conscience &ldquo;&hellip; I am only slowing you down &hellip; leave me here &hellip; save your life &hellip;&rdquo;<br/>_ &ldquo;That&rsquo;s out of the question &hellip;&rdquo; Daenerys answers firmly, close to tears &ldquo;&hellip; what kind of queen would I be if I don&rsquo;t defend my friends?!&rdquo;<br/>But at the exit of the alley, the young khaleesi is suddenly seized to the throat by the white and cold hand of a white walker, who lifts her off the ground like a feather and stares at her his monstrous blue eyes. Paralyzed by the monster&rsquo;s iron grip, Daenerys can only shake her legs.<br/>_ &ldquo;Khaleesi!&rdquo; screams Jorah in despair and despite the serious wound and blood loss, rushes to the white walker to hit him with his sword. But the white walker also catches the Andal knight by the throat, and slowly begins to strangle his two victims with his cold hands. Feeling his throat tightly, Jorah can not move. Feeling her breath cut, Daenerys looks at Jorah&rsquo;s sword, still in his hand. With great effort, Daenerys manages to take her friend&rsquo;s Valyrian steel sword, and with a desperate blow, pierces the belly of the white walker with it. The monster freezes, collapsing into thousands of pieces of ice that spread on the ground while Daenerys and Jorah fall to the ground, coughing hard and rubbing their throats. After being able to get up, Daenerys returns her sword to Jorah and continues to support him to walk.<br/>*********<br/>From the Dragonpit, Bran enters a new trance and his spirit takes possession of Drogon. For him, out of the question that another dragon does not become the slave of the Night King. Now possessed by the spirit of the three-eyed raven, Drogon stands up and flies away from the ruins of the castle. The Night King seeing this, seizes another of his javelins of ice and throws it with all his might towards the dragon, but the latter manages to avoid it justly.<br/>From the sky, Bran can see the gigantic shadow that he spreads over the streets of King&rsquo;s Landing, bringing him back to another vision he had had before. In the skin of the dragon, Bran begins to blow the fire, to kill as many wights as possible. Unfortunately, many civilians and living soldiers are also carried away in the torrents of fire, the sensibility having become a foreign feeling for Bran.<br/>*********<br/>In the streets of the capital in total chaos, Jon, Arya and Gendry continue to run as far as possible, making their way between the wights trying to catch them. Jon is once again using Longclaw, shooting down three wights one after the other, while Arya uses her agility to take down the undead backwards and Gendry, armed with his hammer, deals with hitting those who are trying to grip his friends back. But suddenly, a wight, larger than the others catches Arya, stayed further back, by surprise and his hands comes to seize her by the throat and lift. Arya is horrified to the highest degree. Hodor! It&rsquo;s Hodor, blue-eyed and grunting like an animal that just catched her and tries to strangle her. How can that be? What is he doing here? Arya struggles, and is forced to pierce Hodor&rsquo;s eye with her dagger, killing him instantly and finally allowing him to find eternal rest. She ends up joining Jon and Gendry, taking a last look over her shoulder.<br/>*********<br/>For their part, Tyrion and Davos, followed by a large number of civilians, finally cross the path of Daenerys and Jorah at the corner of a street. Davos comes to help Daenerys to bring the Andal knight in a bad state and having lost a lot of blood. They manage to reach the port, where are already the ships of the ironborn fleet, now under the control of Yara, open their doors and allow the first survivors to get on board. Once on board, Jorah is taken care of and Daenerys finds Yara.<br/>_ &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pleasure to meet you again, my queen &hellip;.. what are we doing now?&rdquo; asks the ironborn lady.<br/>_ &ldquo;Take all the survivors to Dragonstone, they will be safe there.&rdquo; the Queen of the Dragon answers without hesitation, which Yara accepts and continues to give orders to the sailors. From the ships, the archers cover the embarkation of the refugees by firing on the wights that are trying to approach.<br/>**********<br/>Always in the streets of the ravaged city, but approaching more and more of the port, Sandor, Bronn and Brienne end up being joined by Jon, Arya and Gendry, and the two groups only forming one continues its frantic race for their survival. Behind them, a horde of more and more wights is formed and chases them. Unfortunately, following a leg injury inflicted by a creature, Gendry is lagging behind and begins to weaken dangerously. Sandor then lifts him and puts him like a potato bag on his shoulder and starts running again. Gendry thanks him, what Sandor responds with a &ldquo;raah shut up, otherwise I leave you here!&rdquo;<br/>But more than the wights, white walkers also begin to appear from nearby streets and head towards the group of fugitives. Even worse, Jon sees the Night King in person among them. In the sky, Drogon, still under the influence of Bran, is forced to stay at a distance so as not to wipe another javelin throw that could work this time. In the city, the last troops of Lannister soldiers finally give way under the immeasurable pressure of the undead. In order to gain precious seconds for their king in the north, the North soldiers who accompanied the commando form a small dam against the wights, but are quickly submerged and massacred by the creatures, under the eyes of Jon, helpless. In the background, the Night King continues to advance confidently, darting his gaze on the young king of the north.<br/>Jon&rsquo;s group finally reached the port, under the reassured eyes of their friends to see them arrive, but also the horror of seeing the hordes of dead approaching them. Under Yara&rsquo;s command, the iron-born archers, from the ships, continue to rain their arrows at the nearest undead to give the survivors time to board. Tyrion turned pale with terror at the sight of Brienne carrying Jaime&rsquo;s inert body, which she carefully placed on the deck, and turning her desolate look towards the dwarf, shakes her head nonchalantly, confirming the death of the knight to her little one brother, who could not help but burst into tears. Once on board, Jon sees Daenerys, herself near Ser Jorah seriously injured. The young king from the north joins his beloved and both share a strong embrace and a short kiss. Once the entire group boarded safely, the bridges are immediately removed, blocking access to the dead. A visibly more stubborn wight, however, manages to pounce and cling to the ship&rsquo;s rail, trying to get on board. Yara advances and with a violent blow of ax, decapses the undead which falls then with the water. Without further ado, the order is given and the ships begin to move progressively away from the wharves, under the observation of the Night King and his troops.<br/>*********<br/>After having invaded almost all the districts of the capital, the army of the dead had advanced towards the doors of the red dungeon. Two giants knocked down the gates forcefully, allowing the dead troops to now spread through the high walled quarters of King&rsquo;s Landing.<br/>**********<br/>Under the city, in the secret warehouse, Varys slices his veins with a knife, letting his blood flow freely and full with the powerful magic he once received from R'hllor himself through the ritual. The blood flows on the ground while the master spy collapses little by little, feeling the life leaving him. Putting her hands in the still fresh blood, Melisandre draws a new source of power. Fixing her gaze on the hundreds of jars of wildfire, she begins to recite an incantation in old Valyrian. With the blood of Varys and the presence of a dragon above King&rsquo;s Landing, the strength of wildfire is increased tenfold. Following the incantation, all the jars simultaneously detonate, triggering a cataclysmic explosion, pulverizing the priestess and the master spy who die together in this magic fire. The explosion is spreading rapidly through the underground and is dangerously close to the surface.<br/>At the Dragonpit, Drogon, still possessed by Bran, flies away and moves as far as possible, carrying Samwell on his back, himself holding the body of Bran still in trance, to shelter them.<br/>From the ships now far away from the city, all watch with astonishment and horror the devastating explosion, like a volcano erupting, swallowing the entire city in its envelope of green flames. The red dungeon, the city, the dragonpit, everything is covered by the flames, as well as the inhabitants and soldiers who could not escape in time, but also the entire army of the dead, the white walkers, and of course, the Night King.<br/>On the deck of the flagship commanded by Yara, the survivors: Daenerys, Jon, Arya, Sandor, Brienne, Gendry, Davos, Tyrion, Bronn and Jorah, the latter being very hurt and unable to stand without help, contemplate powerless the total destruction of the capital of the seven kingdoms, the giant column of flames rising to the sky.<br/>But in the middle of the steaming ruins of the capital, a pile of rubble shakes slightly and a pale blue hand emerges, attached to an arm and a body surrounded by an icy blue halo, slowly emerging and standing on his feet &hellip;.. in his monstrous blue eyes are reflected the silhouettes of the ships fleeing off &hellip;. the eyes of the sole survivor of the explosion &hellip;. The Night King.<br/></p>",

Once on board, Jorah is taken care of and Daenerys finds Yara.<br>_ \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you again, my queen \u2026.. what are we doing now?\u201d asks the ironborn lady.<br>_ \u201cTake all the survivors to Dragonstone, they will be safe there.\u201d the Queen of the Dragon answers without hesitation, which Yara accepts and continues to give orders to the sailors. From the ships, the archers cover the embarkation of the refugees by firing on the wights that are trying to approach.<br>**********<br>Always in the streets of the ravaged city, but approaching more and more of the port, Sandor, Bronn and Brienne end up being joined by Jon, Arya and Gendry, and the two groups only forming one continues its frantic race for their survival. Behind them, a horde of more and more wights is formed and chases them. Unfortunately, following a leg injury inflicted by a creature, Gendry is lagging behind and begins to weaken dangerously. Sandor then lifts him and puts him like a potato bag on his shoulder and starts running again. Gendry thanks him, what Sandor responds with a \u201craah shut up, otherwise I leave you here!\u201d<br>But more than the wights, white walkers also begin to appear from nearby streets and head towards the group of fugitives. Even worse, Jon sees the Night King in person among them. In the sky, Drogon, still under the influence of Bran, is forced to stay at a distance so as not to wipe another javelin throw that could work this time. In the city, the last troops of Lannister soldiers finally give way under the immeasurable pressure of the undead. In order to gain precious seconds for their king in the north, the North soldiers who accompanied the commando form a small dam against the wights, but are quickly submerged and massacred by the creatures, under the eyes of Jon, helpless. In the background, the Night King continues to advance confidently, darting his gaze on the young king of the north.<br>Jon\u2019s group finally reached the port, under the reassured eyes of their friends to see them arrive, but also the horror of seeing the hordes of dead approaching them. Under Yara\u2019s command, the iron-born archers, from the ships, continue to rain their arrows at the nearest undead to give the survivors time to board. Tyrion turned pale with terror at the sight of Brienne carrying Jaime\u2019s inert body, which she carefully placed on the deck, and turning her desolate look towards the dwarf, shakes her head nonchalantly, confirming the death of the knight to her little one brother, who could not help but burst into tears. Once on board, Jon sees Daenerys, herself near Ser Jorah seriously injured. The young king from the north joins his beloved and both share a strong embrace and a short kiss. Once the entire group boarded safely, the bridges are immediately removed, blocking access to the dead. A visibly more stubborn wight, however, manages to pounce and cling to the ship\u2019s rail, trying to get on board. Yara advances and with a violent blow of ax, decapses the undead which falls then with the water. Without further ado, the order is given and the ships begin to move progressively away from the wharves, under the observation of the Night King and his troops.<br>*********<br>After having invaded almost all the districts of the capital, the army of the dead had advanced towards the doors of the red dungeon. Two giants knocked down the gates forcefully, allowing the dead troops to now spread through the high walled quarters of King\u2019s Landing.<br>**********<br>Under the city, in the secret warehouse, Varys slices his veins with a knife, letting his blood flow freely and full with the powerful magic he once received from R'hllor himself through the ritual. The blood flows on the ground while the master spy collapses little by little, feeling the life leaving him. Putting her hands in the still fresh blood, Melisandre draws a new source of power. Fixing her gaze on the hundreds of jars of wildfire, she begins to recite an incantation in old Valyrian. With the blood of Varys and the presence of a dragon above King\u2019s Landing, the strength of wildfire is increased tenfold. Following the incantation, all the jars simultaneously detonate, triggering a cataclysmic explosion, pulverizing the priestess and the master spy who die together in this magic fire. The explosion is spreading rapidly through the underground and is dangerously close to the surface.<br>At the Dragonpit, Drogon, still possessed by Bran, flies away and moves as far as possible, carrying Samwell on his back, himself holding the body of Bran still in trance, to shelter them.<br>From the ships now far away from the city, all watch with astonishment and horror the devastating explosion, like a volcano erupting, swallowing the entire city in its envelope of green flames. The red dungeon, the city, the dragonpit, everything is covered by the flames, as well as the inhabitants and soldiers who could not escape in time, but also the entire army of the dead, the white walkers, and of course, the Night King.<br>On the deck of the flagship commanded by Yara, the survivors: Daenerys, Jon, Arya, Sandor, Brienne, Gendry, Davos, Tyrion, Bronn and Jorah, the latter being very hurt and unable to stand without help, contemplate powerless the total destruction of the capital of the seven kingdoms, the giant column of flames rising to the sky.<br>But in the middle of the steaming ruins of the capital, a pile of rubble shakes slightly and a pale blue hand emerges, attached to an arm and a body surrounded by an icy blue halo, slowly emerging and standing on his feet \u2026.. in his monstrous blue eyes are reflected the silhouettes of the ships fleeing off \u2026. the eyes of the sole survivor of the explosion \u2026.

Viserion closes his mouth on the left wing of Drogon and the two flying creatures start an aerial balet and fall faster and faster, towards the red dungeon.<br>From the throne room, Brienne, Bronn, and Sandor, through a window, perceive with horror the imminent arrival of the two dragons towards them, and hasten to leave the throne room, while carrying with them the body of Jaime.<br>In the anarchic melee, Drogon in a momentum manages to bite and close his jaws on the neck of Viserion, and tightening more and more, literally tries to tear his brother\u2019s head off. Seeing the impact more and more imminent, the Night King jumps from Viserion and lands on his feet on the cobblestones of a street, in the middle of the carnage orchestrated by his own troops. Biting each other, Drogon and Viserion, in a last breath of common flames, collide with the roof of the throne room and destroy a large part of it. In the impact, Drogon managed to pull off Viserion\u2019s head, killing him once and for all, but the big dragon suffered terribly from the shock and moans weakly in the middle of the rubble.<br>*********<br>Daenerys survived her fall, dampened by the providencial presence of a big canvas from a shopkeeper\u2019s stall in a commercial street. Yet sounded, she watched helplessly and horrified the fall of the two dragons in the red dungeon, which plunges her back a brief moment in her vision of the hall of the destroyed iron throne room.<br>Slightly limping, the queen of dragons roam among the streets, contemplating the chaos around her. In order to better protect herself, she seizes an abandoned sword on the ground. In the midst of cries, she suddenly hears a familiar voice.<br>_ \u201cKhaleesi!\u201d<br>Jorah appears, repeling a few wights in his path, and ends up joining the young queen, more than happy to see him. A wight, however, disrupts the reunion by jumping on Jorah, but Daenerys kills him by piercing his skull with the weapon picked up earlier. Jorah thanks Daenerys and brings her in the direction of the port.<br>On his side, the Night King makes his way in the streets and armed with his sword of ice, massacres all the inhabitants and the soldiers within his reach, while continuing to raise the dead with his terrible power. That\u2019s when he comes face to face with Ser Jorah and Daenerys. Immediately, Jorah works to protect his queen and blocks the first sword\u2019s blow of the terrible ice king. Jorah in turn tries a riposte, but is easily countered by the monster. Daenerys refuses to see her friend risk his life alone and tries to attack the Night King by the side with her sword. But by his superhuman reflexes, the king of the walkers blocks with one hand the blade of the young queen and looks at her with his sharp blue eye. With a simple gesture, he pushes her back with incredible violence, making her fall to the ground. Seeing this, Jorah tries a final stab, but the Night King avoids it again, passing behind Jorah and with his ice sword, strikes the Andal knight\u2019s back all the way up and down, leaving him a deep bloody slash. Daenerys lets out a scream as Jorah, hit hard, falls to one knee on the ground, under the impassive gaze of the Night King. Daenerys rushes to Ser Jorah, and with the energy of desperation, manages to raise him up and take him with her in the opposite direction.<br>The Night King begins to follow them to finish them, but soon he seems to give up and turns his cold eyes towards the partially destroyed red dungeon. Drogon does not seem to have recovered from the fall. The Night King then begins his decided march towards the red dungeon to finish Drogon himself and make him his new undead dragon.<br>*********<br>For their part, Daenerys, supporting her friend knight as much as possible, continues to advance as fast as possible in the middle of the chaotic streets. Everywhere around them, the cries of the living and the howling of zombies resound, as do the incessant sounds of slaughter. Daenerys and Jorah are forced to make a detour through an alleyway to find the street in front of them suddenly being invaded by the undead, raging on the Lannister soldiers and the inhabitants present. A giant, with a huge wooden mass, hammered relentlessly in front of him, striking and throwing several Lannister soldiers into the air or against the walls of the houses. Daenerys and Jorah manage to sneak into the alley without the giant noticing their presence and the latter, uttering a bestial roar, continues his slaughter.<br>_ \u201cKhaleesi \u2026\u201d manages to articulate Jorah in an impetus of conscience \u201c\u2026 I am only slowing you down \u2026 leave me here \u2026 save your life \u2026\u201d<br>_ \u201cThat\u2019s out of the question \u2026\u201d Daenerys answers firmly, close to tears \u201c\u2026 what kind of queen would I be if I don\u2019t defend my friends?!\u201d<br>But at the exit of the alley, the young khaleesi is suddenly seized to the throat by the white and cold hand of a white walker, who lifts her off the ground like a feather and stares at her his monstrous blue eyes. Paralyzed by the monster\u2019s iron grip, Daenerys can only shake her legs.<br>_ \u201cKhaleesi!\u201d screams Jorah in despair and despite the serious wound and blood loss, rushes to the white walker to hit him with his sword. But the white walker also catches the Andal knight by the throat, and slowly begins to strangle his two victims with his cold hands. Feeling his throat tightly, Jorah can not move. Feeling her breath cut, Daenerys looks at Jorah\u2019s sword, still in his hand. With great effort, Daenerys manages to take her friend\u2019s Valyrian steel sword, and with a desperate blow, pierces the belly of the white walker with it. The monster freezes, collapsing into thousands of pieces of ice that spread on the ground while Daenerys and Jorah fall to the ground, coughing hard and rubbing their throats. After being able to get up, Daenerys returns her sword to Jorah and continues to support him to walk.<br>*********<br>From the Dragonpit, Bran enters a new trance and his spirit takes possession of Drogon. For him, out of the question that another dragon does not become the slave of the Night King. Now possessed by the spirit of the three-eyed raven, Drogon stands up and flies away from the ruins of the castle. The Night King seeing this, seizes another of his javelins of ice and throws it with all his might towards the dragon, but the latter manages to avoid it justly.<br>From the sky, Bran can see the gigantic shadow that he spreads over the streets of King\u2019s Landing, bringing him back to another vision he had had before. In the skin of the dragon, Bran begins to blow the fire, to kill as many wights as possible. Unfortunately, many civilians and living soldiers are also carried away in the torrents of fire, the sensibility having become a foreign feeling for Bran.<br>*********<br>In the streets of the capital in total chaos, Jon, Arya and Gendry continue to run as far as possible, making their way between the wights trying to catch them. Jon is once again using Longclaw, shooting down three wights one after the other, while Arya uses her agility to take down the undead backwards and Gendry, armed with his hammer, deals with hitting those who are trying to grip his friends back. But suddenly, a wight, larger than the others catches Arya, stayed further back, by surprise and his hands comes to seize her by the throat and lift. Arya is horrified to the highest degree. Hodor! It\u2019s Hodor, blue-eyed and grunting like an animal that just catched her and tries to strangle her. How can that be? What is he doing here? Arya struggles, and is forced to pierce Hodor\u2019s eye with her dagger, killing him instantly and finally allowing him to find eternal rest. She ends up joining Jon and Gendry, taking a last look over her shoulder.<br>*********<br>For their part, Tyrion and Davos, followed by a large number of civilians, finally cross the path of Daenerys and Jorah at the corner of a street. Davos comes to help Daenerys to bring the Andal knight in a bad state and having lost a lot of blood. They manage to reach the port, where are already the ships of the ironborn fleet, now under the control of Yara, open their doors and allow the first survivors to get on board. Once on board, Jorah is taken care of and Daenerys finds Yara.<br>_ \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you again, my queen \u2026.. what are we doing now?\u201d asks the ironborn lady.<br>_ \u201cTake all the survivors to Dragonstone, they will be safe there.\u201d the Queen of the Dragon answers without hesitation, which Yara accepts and continues to give orders to the sailors.

She ends up joining Jon and Gendry, taking a last look over her shoulder.<br />*********<br />For their part, Tyrion and Davos, followed by a large number of civilians, finally cross the path of Daenerys and Jorah at the corner of a street. Davos comes to help Daenerys to bring the Andal knight in a bad state and having lost a lot of blood. They manage to reach the port, where are already the ships of the ironborn fleet, now under the control of Yara, open their doors and allow the first survivors to get on board. Once on board, Jorah is taken care of and Daenerys finds Yara.<br />_ &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pleasure to meet you again, my queen &hellip;.. what are we doing now?&rdquo; asks the ironborn lady.<br />_ &ldquo;Take all the survivors to Dragonstone, they will be safe there.&rdquo; the Queen of the Dragon answers without hesitation, which Yara accepts and continues to give orders to the sailors. From the ships, the archers cover the embarkation of the refugees by firing on the wights that are trying to approach.<br />**********<br />Always in the streets of the ravaged city, but approaching more and more of the port, Sandor, Bronn and Brienne end up being joined by Jon, Arya and Gendry, and the two groups only forming one continues its frantic race for their survival. Behind them, a horde of more and more wights is formed and chases them. Unfortunately, following a leg injury inflicted by a creature, Gendry is lagging behind and begins to weaken dangerously. Sandor then lifts him and puts him like a potato bag on his shoulder and starts running again. Gendry thanks him, what Sandor responds with a &ldquo;raah shut up, otherwise I leave you here!&rdquo;<br />But more than the wights, white walkers also begin to appear from nearby streets and head towards the group of fugitives. Even worse, Jon sees the Night King in person among them. In the sky, Drogon, still under the influence of Bran, is forced to stay at a distance so as not to wipe another javelin throw that could work this time. In the city, the last troops of Lannister soldiers finally give way under the immeasurable pressure of the undead. In order to gain precious seconds for their king in the north, the North soldiers who accompanied the commando form a small dam against the wights, but are quickly submerged and massacred by the creatures, under the eyes of Jon, helpless. In the background, the Night King continues to advance confidently, darting his gaze on the young king of the north.<br />Jon&rsquo;s group finally reached the port, under the reassured eyes of their friends to see them arrive, but also the horror of seeing the hordes of dead approaching them. Under Yara&rsquo;s command, the iron-born archers, from the ships, continue to rain their arrows at the nearest undead to give the survivors time to board. Tyrion turned pale with terror at the sight of Brienne carrying Jaime&rsquo;s inert body, which she carefully placed on the deck, and turning her desolate look towards the dwarf, shakes her head nonchalantly, confirming the death of the knight to her little one brother, who could not help but burst into tears. Once on board, Jon sees Daenerys, herself near Ser Jorah seriously injured. The young king from the north joins his beloved and both share a strong embrace and a short kiss. Once the entire group boarded safely, the bridges are immediately removed, blocking access to the dead. A visibly more stubborn wight, however, manages to pounce and cling to the ship&rsquo;s rail, trying to get on board. Yara advances and with a violent blow of ax, decapses the undead which falls then with the water. Without further ado, the order is given and the ships begin to move progressively away from the wharves, under the observation of the Night King and his troops.<br />*********<br />After having invaded almost all the districts of the capital, the army of the dead had advanced towards the doors of the red dungeon. Two giants knocked down the gates forcefully, allowing the dead troops to now spread through the high walled quarters of King&rsquo;s Landing.<br />**********<br />Under the city, in the secret warehouse, Varys slices his veins with a knife, letting his blood flow freely and full with the powerful magic he once received from R'hllor himself through the ritual. The blood flows on the ground while the master spy collapses little by little, feeling the life leaving him. Putting her hands in the still fresh blood, Melisandre draws a new source of power. Fixing her gaze on the hundreds of jars of wildfire, she begins to recite an incantation in old Valyrian. With the blood of Varys and the presence of a dragon above King&rsquo;s Landing, the strength of wildfire is increased tenfold. Following the incantation, all the jars simultaneously detonate, triggering a cataclysmic explosion, pulverizing the priestess and the master spy who die together in this magic fire. The explosion is spreading rapidly through the underground and is dangerously close to the surface.<br />At the Dragonpit, Drogon, still possessed by Bran, flies away and moves as far as possible, carrying Samwell on his back, himself holding the body of Bran still in trance, to shelter them.<br />From the ships now far away from the city, all watch with astonishment and horror the devastating explosion, like a volcano erupting, swallowing the entire city in its envelope of green flames. The red dungeon, the city, the dragonpit, everything is covered by the flames, as well as the inhabitants and soldiers who could not escape in time, but also the entire army of the dead, the white walkers, and of course, the Night King.<br />On the deck of the flagship commanded by Yara, the survivors: Daenerys, Jon, Arya, Sandor, Brienne, Gendry, Davos, Tyrion, Bronn and Jorah, the latter being very hurt and unable to stand without help, contemplate powerless the total destruction of the capital of the seven kingdoms, the giant column of flames rising to the sky.<br />But in the middle of the steaming ruins of the capital, a pile of rubble shakes slightly and a pale blue hand emerges, attached to an arm and a body surrounded by an icy blue halo, slowly emerging and standing on his feet &hellip;.. in his monstrous blue eyes are reflected the silhouettes of the ships fleeing off &hellip;. the eyes of the sole survivor of the explosion &hellip;. The Night King.<br /></p>",

If you believed, not just that women in power can be abusive, but that all women in power are abusive, not just that some women internalize tyrannical ideas of power, but that the very desire to wield power makes women tyrannical \u2014 not just that the world contains Cerseis, but that any woman becomes a Cersei by virtue of leading \u2014 then it would completely make sense that, the very second a female character obtained her world\u2019s highest position of authority, she would PMS and have a meltdown and get hysterical and lash out and otherwise prove herself not only unfit to lead, but dangerously so. In other words, this would make sense to you if you did not see Daenerys making a decision, but a woman making a decision, and if this were the kind of decision you expected women to make.",

        "text": "<p>That\u2019s a major change that only seems minimally and abruptly motivated by the need to justify what she and her final dragon do to King\u2019s Landing in \u201cThe Bells.\u201d Until now, Daenerys has been surrounded by characters with unwavering faith in her ability to rule: Missandei, Grey Worm, Jorah, Tyrion, Varys, Ser Barristan Selmy. They frequently witnessed what her dragons could do on her orders and didn\u2019t flinch. Neither did the audience because the characters were cueing them that Daenerys\u2019 behavior was largely necessary \u2014 sometimes harsh, but a proper response to a harsh world.</p>\n\n<p>Daenerys has made aggressive, murderous decisions, but they\u2019ve consistently been aimed at people designated as evil and / or a direct threat to her. Season 4 does begin to reckon with the danger of her dragons, as Drogon kills a 4-year-old child. She also orders all the Great Masters of Meereen to be crucified as vengeance for the slave children they murdered in the same way, only to learn that at least one of her victims was secretly working to free slaves. But the reckoning for that mistake is minimal, just a way of establishing her feelings of guilt and the weight of power.</p>\n\n<p>Had the show continued into a slow progression of having Daenerys\u2019 victims be more and more sympathetic, perhaps her actions at King\u2019s Landing would have been less jarring. But the leap to finding those victims sympathetic and helpless is also abrupt. The King\u2019s Landing residents are the same people who cheered when season 1 protagonist Ned Stark was beheaded. The crowds there attempted to rape Sansa, and they tormented Cersei during her walk of shame. They\u2019ve been portrayed as ignorant, vicious, cruel, and easily manipulated. Game of Thrones hasn\u2019t exactly been conditioning its viewers to mourn their deaths. But \u201cThe Bells\u201d focuses on their vulnerability and helplessness, turning Daenerys\u2019 attack into the behavior of a vengeance-crazed tyrant.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The burning of King\u2019s Landing symbolizes a final line Daenerys has crossed, and it seems like the obvious climax her story was building toward. Since season 1, she\u2019s been power-hungry, with a penchant for burning people alive, among the other painful punishments she\u2019s doled out to victims, like the godswife Mirri Maz Duur and the merchant prince Xaro Xhoan Daxos. She\u2019s displayed a long proclivity toward severity, and King\u2019s Landing was the climax, especially after watching her adviser Missandei be killed on its walls.</p>\n\n<p>But as much as the viewer debates around Daenerys\u2019 actions claim her heel-turn was internal, the real change was in the way the show portrayed her \u2014 as a distant, unapproachable, incomprehensible figure \u2014 and the way Tyrion, Jon, and Arya, the show\u2019s most popular remaining characters, were shown responding to her with shock, terror, and disgust. It was an external shift in how the show sees her, not an internal one. Theories differ on whether the final episode will make any effort to redeem her, or if it will just show her as a monster, but the other characters\u2019 reaction to her as a villain may suggest the answer.</p>",
