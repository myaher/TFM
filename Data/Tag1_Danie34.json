This is one of the most plausible reasons, and it is that&hellip;Dan and Phil are simply starting a new era~ They have mentioned several times that new things are coming, and that they aren\u2019t leaving anytime soon~ Think of it like a show where Season 1 has ended, and they\u2019re in the process of making Season 2~</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>2. Interactive Introverts~ Remember that world tour that the both of them did FOR their audience, themed ALL AROUND their audience, and giving the people what they want? They\u2019ve given us so much&hellip;now we are letting them have what they want~ They don\u2019t owe us anything~ </p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>3. This reason is for those who believe Dan and Phil are in a relationship. There is no reason to believe they\u2019ve split up. Why would Dan have taken Phil\u2019s merch pictures if one of them had just moved out and left? Taking photos of someone is, inmany ways, very very affectionate~ Capturing the beauty of the one you love~ And just because they don\u2019t go everywhere together, it doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re over. Do you go everywhere all the time with your S.O.? Didn\u2019t think so. Did I mention Phil still mentions Dan in his videos? Why would he mention someone he was trying to forget? It only makes sense that they\u2019re doing fine~ Or better yet, they\u2019re happier than ever because they\u2019re living more life off camera and for themselves~ </p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>4. This is to all who believe the \u201cDan and Phil\u201d branding is dead, and that they will no longer collaborate. Now tell me&hellip;did they say DanAndPhilGAMES was done? Nope~! They went on hiatus. Now I know they ended Dan vs. Phil, PINOF, Baking ( for now ), the 7 second challenge app&hellip;etc. But do you know what they said or mentioned after every one of   those cancellations? That there are NEW THINGS COMING~ TRY NEW THINGS~ Don\u2019t forget that~!! This is the NEW ERA of Dan and Phil~! Get excited~! \u201cNow, onto the future\u201d~</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>5. Now&hellip;to everyone not liking the \u201clack of communication\u201d. I\u2019ll make this simple&hellip;Dan is on hiatus. As is the gaming channel. Dan isn\u2019t really using the internet, which is FINE. Did you know that people can live without telling everyone what they\u2019re doing? That\u2019s what Dan is doing~ He doesn\u2019t \u201cowe us an explanation\u201d. If anything, we owe him the support~ And&hellip;why is everyone harassing Phil with questions? Yes, he\u2019s the closest person to Dan, but is it his choice to talk about what Dan is doing? No, it\u2019s Dan\u2019s. Phil doesn\u2019t need to say anything. He\u2019s being an ANGEL giving us all this content, and everyone is overlooking that. Phil is probably frequently talking with Dan behind the scenes, and helping him out. Now that\u2019s a personal thing&hellip;and he doesn\u2019t need to tell us anything about his interactions with Dan. They\u2019re living more privately and that\u2019s nothing but good~ Good for them~ : )</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>6. Phil\u2019s content is JUST AS AMAZING, or even BETTER THAN IT USED TO BE~ It\u2019s only grown with his personality and interests, and he STILL LOVES WHAT HE DOES~ He would post much less, and with very little smiles and laughs if he didn\u2019t love his job~ The only reason people believe he \u201cdoesn\u2019t like making vids\u201d anymore is because he isn\u2019t answering the questions they want him to answer, and for some reason they see that as him being ignorant or defensive? He doesn\u2019t have to answer those questions, and he doesn\u2019t owe us those answers either. We owe him support and smiles~ I personally have been frickin LOVING Phil\u2019s recent content~! He is such a sunshine and a blessing~! Do you know how much he has been giving us, and how well he\u2019s been supporting us during this hiatus~? He is working HARD~! And if that doesn\u2019t mean he loves his fans then I don\u2019t know what does~ Don\u2019t use your want for \u201ccommunication\u201d as an excuse to not like Phil\u2019s content~ He\u2019s only changed for the better, and he isn\u2019t going anywhere~</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>7. Another point on Dan and his hiatus: him and Phil had been going NONSTOP the whole of 2018. In the mukbang, Dan DID talk about why he hadn\u2019t posted yet. The algorithm, where he wants to go with his content, him growing as a person&hellip;etc. And do you NOT remember that he still struggles with depression? When depressed, motivation is nonexistent. If that is yet ANOTHER thing happening, it\u2019s building up along with his other reasons, and making it harder for him to come back. Now do you think implying he is \u201cdead\u201d, and attacking him with constant question is gong to help that? Just remember that Dan is a human being, and has the right to take as long as he wants. Just because he\u2019s working on himself doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s leaving. Don\u2019t lose hope in Dan. He\u2019s got some big, amazing things coming~ Remember the writers retreat he attended~? Yeah, that\u2019s a thing~! Another reason it may be taking him longer, a GOOD reason~! I just know he has big things planned, and when he comes back&hellip;we should welcome him with open arms~ No complaints about \u201chow long he was gone\u201d or the \u201clack of communication\u201d, but cheers and support~ Love and excitement~ :\u2019)</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>8. There are so many other reasons, but I will make this my final point because I don\u2019t want to drag this thread on too long. Dan and Phil..they care for their fans so much~ most likely more than any other YouTubers~ I know barely anyone who has gone on 2 tours for their audience, with so much work and love put into them~ I know barely anyone who has been so helpful, honest, genuine, and supportive to their audience~ Live shows in which they give someone advice or help someone out~ Hugging a fan crying outside that they didn\u2019t even know~ ( this actually happened it was so v v precious~ ) Innumerable meet and greets, with the same amount of easygoing energy and kindness each time~ Eating pizza for over 30 minutes ranting about how much they loved doing tour for their audience~ Making their tour into a film edited by them, for all those who couldn\u2019t come to the tour~ Supporting mental health charities, and even being an ambassador~ ( Dan~ ) Writing a book about how much they loved their journey with each other and their audience~ So many other things~ Everyone&hellip;don\u2019t forget or dismiss all they\u2019ve done for us. All they may have done for you personally. Making you happy~ Helping you through hard times in your life~ Keeping you from your crippling depression or easing your anxiety~ Helping you stay strong through those tough times~ Making you laugh and smile when it seemed near impossible~</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'><span class=\"npf_color_joey\">D</span><span class=\"npf_color_monica\">a</span><span class=\"npf_color_ross\">n</span> and <span class=\"npf_color_rachel\">P</span><span style=\"color: #7c5cff\">h</span><span class=\"npf_color_niles\">i</span><span class=\"npf_color_joey\">l</span> gave us their <span class=\"npf_color_rachel\">w</span><span class=\"npf_color_ross\">o</span><span class=\"npf_color_rachel\">r</span><span class=\"npf_color_ross\">l</span><span class=\"npf_color_rachel\">d</span>&hellip;</p><p class=\"npf_quirky\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"quirky\"}'>don\u2019t you think <span style=\"color: #7c5cff\">we</span> owe them that too~? \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc95</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"420\" data-orig-width=\"555\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/df38ca338c72bf988bd0d073df7d0732/tumblr_ps2vyzCPWB1wayw2l_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"420\" data-orig-width=\"555\"/></figure><div class=\"npf_row\"><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"960\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e4ce057ecc7ab6cf84adad9bff84f920/tumblr_ps2vyzJQvO1wayw2l_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"960\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"960\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b69a2e34803a0020d64c7f1895ceda54/tumblr_ps2vz0l0ss1wayw2l_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"960\"/></figure></div><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"746\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f88f08cf695a5567ad326a534825f0e7/tumblr_ps2vz1Zy221wayw2l_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"746\"/></figure>",

This is one of the most plausible reasons, and it is that\u2026Dan and Phil are simply starting a new era~ They have mentioned several times that new things are coming, and that they aren\u2019t leaving anytime soon~ Think of it like a show where Season 1 has ended, and they\u2019re in the process of making Season 2~</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>2. Interactive Introverts~ Remember that world tour that the both of them did FOR their audience, themed ALL AROUND their audience, and giving the people what they want?

This reason is for those who believe Dan and Phil are in a relationship. There is no reason to believe they\u2019ve split up. Why would Dan have taken Phil\u2019s merch pictures if one of them had just moved out and left? Taking photos of someone is, inmany ways, very very affectionate~ Capturing the beauty of the one you love~ And just because they don\u2019t go everywhere together, it doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re over. Do you go everywhere all the time with your S.O.? Didn\u2019t think so. Did I mention Phil still mentions Dan in his videos? Why would he mention someone he was trying to forget? It only makes sense that they\u2019re doing fine~ Or better yet, they\u2019re happier than ever because they\u2019re living more life off camera and for themselves~ </p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>4. This is to all who believe the \u201cDan and Phil\u201d branding is dead, and that they will no longer collaborate. Now tell me\u2026did they say DanAndPhilGAMES was done? Nope~! They went on hiatus. Now I know they ended Dan vs. Phil, PINOF, Baking ( for now ), the 7 second challenge app\u2026etc. But do you know what they said or mentioned after every one of   those cancellations? That there are NEW THINGS COMING~ TRY NEW THINGS~ Don\u2019t forget that~!! This is the NEW ERA of Dan and Phil~! Get excited~! \u201cNow, onto the future\u201d~</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>5. Now\u2026to everyone not liking the \u201clack of communication\u201d. I\u2019ll make this simple\u2026Dan is on hiatus. As is the gaming channel. Dan isn\u2019t really using the internet, which is FINE. Did you know that people can live without telling everyone what they\u2019re doing? That\u2019s what Dan is doing~ He doesn\u2019t \u201cowe us an explanation\u201d. If anything, we owe him the support~ And\u2026why is everyone harassing Phil with questions? Yes, he\u2019s the closest person to Dan, but is it his choice to talk about what Dan is doing? No, it\u2019s Dan\u2019s. Phil doesn\u2019t need to say anything. He\u2019s being an ANGEL giving us all this content, and everyone is overlooking that. Phil is probably frequently talking with Dan behind the scenes, and helping him out. Now that\u2019s a personal thing\u2026and he doesn\u2019t need to tell us anything about his interactions with Dan. They\u2019re living more privately and that\u2019s nothing but good~ Good for them~ : )</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>6. Phil\u2019s content is JUST AS AMAZING, or even BETTER THAN IT USED TO BE~ It\u2019s only grown with his personality and interests, and he STILL LOVES WHAT HE DOES~ He would post much less, and with very little smiles and laughs if he didn\u2019t love his job~ The only reason people believe he \u201cdoesn\u2019t like making vids\u201d anymore is because he isn\u2019t answering the questions they want him to answer, and for some reason they see that as him being ignorant or defensive? He doesn\u2019t have to answer those questions, and he doesn\u2019t owe us those answers either. We owe him support and smiles~ I personally have been frickin LOVING Phil\u2019s recent content~! He is such a sunshine and a blessing~! Do you know how much he has been giving us, and how well he\u2019s been supporting us during this hiatus~? He is working HARD~! And if that doesn\u2019t mean he loves his fans then I don\u2019t know what does~ Don\u2019t use your want for \u201ccommunication\u201d as an excuse to not like Phil\u2019s content~ He\u2019s only changed for the better, and he isn\u2019t going anywhere~</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>7. Another point on Dan and his hiatus: him and Phil had been going NONSTOP the whole of 2018. In the mukbang, Dan DID talk about why he hadn\u2019t posted yet. The algorithm, where he wants to go with his content, him growing as a person\u2026etc. And do you NOT remember that he still struggles with depression? When depressed, motivation is nonexistent. If that is yet ANOTHER thing happening, it\u2019s building up along with his other reasons, and making it harder for him to come back. Now do you think implying he is \u201cdead\u201d, and attacking him with constant question is gong to help that? Just remember that Dan is a human being, and has the right to take as long as he wants. Just because he\u2019s working on himself doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s leaving. Don\u2019t lose hope in Dan. He\u2019s got some big, amazing things coming~ Remember the writers retreat he attended~? Yeah, that\u2019s a thing~! Another reason it may be taking him longer, a GOOD reason~! I just know he has big things planned, and when he comes back\u2026we should welcome him with open arms~ No complaints about \u201chow long he was gone\u201d or the \u201clack of communication\u201d, but cheers and support~ Love and excitement~ :\u2019)</p><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"chat\"}'>8.
