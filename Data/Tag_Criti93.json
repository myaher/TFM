That was before the facade even needed to be put up. It obviously made them really uncomfortable already. But then there friends use them. Belittle them. Dehumanize them. It really seemed like trust was abused</p><p>Especially since the two couldnt fight back. Both physically and because they&rsquo;d blow their cover.

Again. So cover was not blown. </p><p>And now. To the backgrounds. Beau has a deep problem with authority. Seeing power as something that twists and changes people for the worst. This likely proved her point and will just deepen her hate for authority. These people who she trusted to have power over her for a moment abused it immediately. And she&rsquo;s already felt pretty usless most of her home life. Plus being forcibly dragged away by monks. Like. Holy fuck. I really think this will fuck her up</p><p>And Caleb. Canonly he has been tourtered and abused by people he admirred. People have constantly abused there power of Caleb. Which is why I think Caleb dosent like to be seen as a leader. He was in a postion of powerlessness over most of his life and still likely feels that way now. Then people he trusts do it again. Fuck with the power he gave them for a facade. He still cares about them. Shown through trying to keep them alive afterwords. But i still think this will fuck up his connection to them. And Nott is usually extremely supportive and now is suddenly the bully. That cant be easy</p><p>I still love Fjord and Jester and Nott. But i think this will deeply fuck up the bond between the nien. </p><p>I hope Liam and Marisha bring it into the story.
