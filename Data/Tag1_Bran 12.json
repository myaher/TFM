They even ignored some of the horrible things he did - namely his treatment of Hodor and how at some point canon!Bran is either going to have to look at what he did to Hodor, using and treating him like an animal and learn and redeem himself from that.

Also, a ruler doesn\u2019t have to be given a moniker at the beginning of their reign. Sure Aslan can call the Pevensies\u00a0\u201cThe Magnificent\u201d and\u00a0\u201cThe Valiant\u201d because he\u2019s furry Jesus but irl and ITB monikers usually come after some accomplishment and can change because of events.\u00a0</p><p>There\u2019s just so much awful stuff out there and a lot of it is directed towards characters that are disabled (Bran mostly but also minor characters like Lollys or Doran) or gender non-conforming (Brienne, Arya, Meera, Ygritte, Asha/Yara, Osha, Loras - because many LGBT+ people don\u2019t conform to gender norms) [sidenote: I\u2019ve seen too many posts from Sansa stans focusing on how each GNC woman, mostly Brienne, Arya, and Meera, should be a guard and that\u2019s a \u2018happy\u2019 ending for that woman; we\u2019re ignoring my rant about show!Brienne\u2019s ending], and at characters who break with gender norms but I\u2019m not sure they\u2019d be considered GNC (Dany, Bran again, Edmure - which leads to the examination of how a lot of the hate that\u2019s directed at Edmure, connected to the show\u2019s horrible treatment of him, has to do with his failing to measure up to the violent masculinity that\u2019s expected). It really shows a lot about the biases of fans, of the writers and production crew (not to mention some of the things the actors have said but I don\u2019t take anything they say seriously).</p><p>Bran deserved more focus and more screentime especially time in which he was allowed to express himself and have real conversations with people. He\u2019s kind and sensitive and had big dreams that got crushed (friendly reminder that it was Bran whose dream was to be a knight while Arya wanted an administrative role such as king\u2019s councilor) and he\u2019s angry about it and all of that was just brushed over and eventually erased. They even ignored some of the horrible things he did - namely his treatment of Hodor and how at some point canon!Bran is either going to have to look at what he did to Hodor, using and treating him like an animal and learn and redeem himself from that. To D&amp;D Bran wasn\u2019t even a person, he was just erased into a plot information machine that only worked 30% of the time and then they handed him a kingdom because it would\u00a0\u201csubvert expectations\u201d.</p>",
