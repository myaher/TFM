Look, Daddy! His stomach is bulging!\u201d And just like that, the boy is settled into his little headspace. </p><p>\ud83e\udd66 Peter hates green vegetables. Carrots, tomatoes, cucumber, potatoes and cauliflower he can do just fine and even requests those sometimes for a snack. Broccoli, spinach, peas and salad he will not eat without a fuss. Tony will try to avoid the foods that his little one doesn\u2019t like, but he has to eat some now and then to stay strong and healthy. And Peter will eat them, but only if his Daddy feeds him and makes airplane noises as he does it. </p><p>\ud83d\udc50\ud83c\udffb When Peter wants attention and closeness, he will pretend to fall asleep on the sofa. Eventually, Tony will see his boy curled up and breathing softly and with a fond smile on his face, moves to pick him up and bring him to bed. However, Peter can\u2019t hold back his giggles and grins and Tony sees quickly that he was pretending all along. They go to bed after all, but in the master bedroom, and Peter gets the cuddles he needs. </p><p>\ud83c\udfbc What if Peter was deaf? Tony would learn sign language in 48 hours, less even and have all his employees and anyone that might interact with his boy learn it too. He would also work night and day on a device that could restore Peter\u2019s hearing (if it was possible). The first thing Peter ever hears is his Daddy calling him \u201dmy baby boy\u201d. The boy is stunned and just bursts into tears of utter joy. </p><p>\ud83d\udc09 Peter is obsessed with the Netflix show \u2019The Dragon Prince\u2019. He has seen it all over a dozen times and Tony is going just a little bit insane. The boy knows all the lines and recreates scenes with his stuffies and friends all the time. His obsession has also lead to some tears, however, when his Daddy had to break the sad news to him that dragons don\u2019t exist in real life. </p><p>\ud83d\udd0e Sometimes Peter just gets bored, even with the tons of toys that any little could only dream of having.

Your eyes snapped open, you vision was blurry and you heard a ringing. Soon your eyes focused on the man in front of you. \u201cIt\u2019s about damn fucking time.\u201d He said roughly, moving away to the door to talk to someone. </p><p>Your eyes adjusted to the dull light and that\u2019s when you could make out the person sitting in front of you, also tied down to the chair. </p><p>\u201cTony?\u201d Your voice was scratched but he heard you.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d Tony coughed harshly, spitting blood out of his mouth. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d </p><p>\u201cAlways. Are you?\u201d You asked worriedly. Tony let out a half-hearted laugh.</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d You tried wiggling out of the restraints, but they only seemed to tighten the more you struggled. \u201cStop moving, they\u2019ll only get tighter.\u201d Tony said. </p><p>\u201cWhat? No we can\u2019t just stay here!\u201d You whisper yell, trying not to get the attention of the guy by the door. </p><p>\u201cWell the more you struggle the worse it will get, just calm down.\u201d Tony told you calmly, knowing if his words were harsh you\u2019d panic.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t- I can\u2019t use my powers-\u201c Your panicking.</p><p>\u201cThe cuffs are like the ones I have, they cut your powers.\u201d Tony says.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do-your bleeding?!\u201d You say panicked, your eye catching the gash on his arm. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, we\u2019re fine.\u201d He tells you.</p><p>\u201cWhat?! Your fucking bleeding-\u201c Your sentence is cut off by a slap across your face. </p><p>\u201cDONT FUCKING TOUCH HER!\u201d Tony yelled as he struggled in the restraints. The man turned around facing Tony.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I say about talking?\u201d The man said with a smirk. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck, I said don\u2019t fucking touch her!\u201d Tony yelled, words laced with anger. You moved your jaw, shaking off the pain. </p><p>\u201cYour not one to make the calls here, Mr. Stark.\u201d The man said as he held Tony\u2019s face in his hand.  Tony struggled in his grip, but the man didn\u2019t budge. </p><p>\u201cLeave him alone!\u201d You yelled, making the man smile mischievously. </p><p>\u201cOh, your much like your father.\u201d He said making his way to you. Tony felt his blood boil the closer the man got to you. The mans fingers caressed your cheek, you moved your head away from his hand in disgust. \u201cSo pretty.\u201d </p><p>\u201cLeave her ALONE!\u201d Tony yelled, but before he could say anything more, the man held his hand up and in seconds another man that you hadn\u2019t noticed before, came behind Tony, wrapping a restraint around his mouth. Tony yelled more but his voice was muffled. </p><p>\u201cSilence him.\u201d The man in front of you said, the other man responded by hitting him against the head. Tony winced in pain, and shut up. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s pretty protective over you, ain\u2019t he.\u201d The man said his face coming closer to you.</p><p>\u201cYou needa mint.\u201d You said, as your nose scrunched up. The man laughed, but slapped you across the face once again, this time making your cheek bleed. </p><p>\u201cYou should learn to keep that pretty mouth shut.\u201d You opened and closed your mouth checking if your jaw was fine. After the man saw you were silent he moved away from you going over to the second man. </p><p>\u201cWhat are we gonna do now?\u201d The second man said. </p><p>\u201cWe wait for <i>Him, </i>he\u2019s on his way.\u201d The other answered. </p><p>Tony looked at you, eyes wide. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d You mouthed to him, he nodded. But he knew you were far from fine.</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a week, and you still haven\u2019t found anything?\u201d Steve asked Bruce frustrated.</p><p>\u201cNo I\u2019m working on it.\u201d Bruce said typing on the multiple screens. Steve paced around the room, rubbing his face. Nat stood up from her spot.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find them, don\u2019t worry.\u201d Nat said softly. Steve looked up at Nat the frustration building up.\u201dcmere.\u201d Nat said opening her arms for Steve, which he gladly took.</p><p><i>-two weeks and a half later</i></p><p>\u201cSteve I\u2019ve got something.\u201d Bruce said as she turned the screen so Steve could see. \u201cIts the security tapes, the truck left the city, it\u2019s all the way up in Maine-\u201c Bruce said but was cut of by Peter.</p><p>\u201cThen what are we waiting for!\u201d Peter was sitting by Bruce his fifth coffee in hand.</p><p>\u201cHold on Pete, you need to rest.\u201d Steve said putting an arm on Peters shoulder, but Peter just pushed him away.</p><p>\u201cWhat?! I\u2019m fine-\u201c Peter was actually fine. When he heard the bomb he ran down to the lab to find the guys taking you away and when he yelled one guy had shot him with a taser. But he was fine now. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to take you, we don\u2019t know what\u2019s out there and if Tony finds out we took you to something we didn\u2019t know-\u201c Peters eyes were wide.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going whether you like it or not, I\u2019m the only one here who\u2019s seen how they look and I\u2019m not going to just sit here and do nothing!\u201d Peter felt his blood boil, his fists clenching. Steve looked back at the rest of the team to see what they think.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a kid anymore, he can handle it.\u201d Sam said shrugging. Steve turned back to Peter, looking over him. If he had to be honest, they were right Peter isn\u2019t a kid anymore.</p><p>\u201cFine, but your staying with us, don\u2019t go off on your own.\u201d Steve said sternly. Peter nodded frantically.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Steve patted his shoulder once more and turned back to the team. </p><p>\u201cSuit up!\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>You woke up once again, this time after passing out four times. Both you and Tony were covered in blood, bruises and deep gashes littered your bodies. You held back the tears, not wanting to show weakness. And you knew if you broke down, that Tony would too. The only reason he\u2019s still breathing right now is for you. </p><p>\u201cScrew. You.\u201d You said spitting your blood in the mans face. The man yelled again, punching your gut this time. You groaned in pain, arching forward. </p><p>\u201cLeave her alone.\u201d Tony groaned, it was getting harder and harder for him to speak. Unlike you, Tony was human, he didn\u2019t have any super strength or fast healing, it was getting worse. The man got up fixing his shirt. He traded spots with the other man. And well let\u2019s put it in a not so gory way, he had a sharp knife.\u00a0</p><p>You screamed out in pain, Tony closing his eyes shut as the tears fell from the sides of his eyes. He couldn\u2019t bare to look at you being tortured. After some time the screams died down and both men walked out of the room. Tony finally opened his eyes to find you once again, fainted and laying your head to the side.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He whispered between sobs.\u00a0</p><p><i>Next day</i></p><p>You don\u2019t know how much blood you\u2019ve lost, but you know it\u2019s a lot considering how light-headed your are, and the passing out. The two men walked back into the room, but they\u2019re facial expressions were different then before.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re down to our last straw, tell us the codes!\u201d The man yelled at you both.</p><p>\u201cYou mind keeping your voice a little down, my head kinda hurts.\u201d You teased with a stupid smirk. Tony shook his head at you, letting out a sigh when he saw the man charge over to you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t-\u201d Tony was cut off when the man held his hand up. He leaned down, his face inches away from yours.</p><p>\u201cYou think your funny, don\u2019t you?\u201d He said seriously. You shrugged giving him a sly smirk.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to think.\u201d The man turned around looking at his buddy, then back to you. A humorless laugh leaving his lips. You were expecting him to slap, punch, kick anything, but no, all he did was put a hand up. Before you know it, two people walk in, faces covered in masks. Both men go to Tony untying him and taking him away.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhere are you taking him!\u201d You yelled as Tony tried to fight them off, but the amount of blood he lost making him more weak.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve stayed quiet.\u201d He said, walking out of the room and leaving you alone.\u00a0</p><p>The next few hours were quiet, but then you heard a sharp yell. Your head picked up, you heard it again and again. Tony. You winced hearing his cries and screams. You felt the tears running down your cheek. <i>It\u2019s your fault, it\u2019s your fault. There hurting him.</i>\u00a0You heard various noises, but they all ended in his screams. And that\u2019s when you lost it.\u00a0</p><p>You cried more and more, your heart clenching every time you heard his screams and before you know it your hands were heating up. With one more cry the restraints came burning off and you fell to the ground. You cried more, until your head finally came back. You stood up, holding the chair for balance. You took a few deep breaths, trying to calm yourself. But soon enough, you were back, lighting your hands with energy and blasting the steel door open.\u00a0</p><p>You walked down the hallway, soon hearing footsteps running in your direction. You didn\u2019t bother, when you saw the familiar suits you blasted them, taking your time to let the energy enter there bodies and blow them from the inside out. You had no mercy and you didn\u2019t care. The more you walked, the clearer his screams became, but then they ended. You stopped in your tracks, your heartbeat quickening. You ran to the door you heard him last.\u00a0</p><p>You burned a hole in the door, entering the dark room. The moment yours eyes scanned over the room, your heart broke. They had Tony wrapped up, standing up, as two men beat him and tortured him with <i>tools</i>. Tony wasn\u2019t moving. You shook your head. <i>He\u2019s not dead. no no. </i>The men came charging towards you. You took each one of them, dropping them to the ground and pressing a hand on there chests burning the energy through there body. the only thing you could hear was your heart beat.\u00a0</p><p>You ran to Tony, burning off the restraints, his body falling on you, you held him, laying him on the floor. He rested on you as you cried.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTony, please, please wake up.\u201d You were choking on sobs. Your hand stroking his bloody face. You leaned your forehead down on his as your tears fell on him.\u00a0\u201cD-daddy, w-wake up, I need you. I need you.\u201d You couldn\u2019t feel anything, only the shattering of your heart.\u00a0\u201cplease.\u201d Your body shook, letting all the feeling in.\u00a0</p><p>-</p><p>The team split up, taking different parts of the building.\u00a0</p><p>By the time they all got in, they heard blasting and screams. Steve, Nat and Peter made their way through the buildings. After taking down most of the soliders, they went to each room, looking for you and Tony.\u00a0</p><p>Not long after, Peter turned a corner to hear your cries. He ran quickly and stopped in his tracks when he saw you clutching Tony\u2019s body.\u00a0\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He heard you cry. Steve and Nat stopped next to Peter, both their hearts dropping.\u00a0</p><p>Peter didn\u2019t waste time running to you. Your eyes shot up, locking with Peter. Peter sat on the other side of Tony, his hand on his chest.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cKaren check his vitals.\u201d You continued to stroke Tonys hair, as you waited.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s alive, his heart beat is very slow though. We need to get him back to the compound.\u201d He said quickly looking up at Steve. Steve nodded going over to Tony.\u00a0You looked up eyes wide. Steve struggled to get your grip off of Tony, you didn\u2019t even know, he needed to get in the quinjet, but you couldn\u2019t let go.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/n let go.\u201d Steve said, but your eyes only teared up more.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, I can\u2019t.\u201d You cried, shaking your head\u00a0\u2018no\u2019. Steve looked over your figure. You were broken, you were truly holding on with all your strength.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d Steve looked at Peter, nodding his head to you. Peter nodded coming behind you, tugging your hands out of the grip. You cried louder when you lost contact with Tony. Steve picked Tony up, as Peter held you back.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to be fine. Your fine. We\u2019re here.\u201d Peter whispered in your ear, as you cried. You continued to cry, until Peter picked you up and carried you to the quinjet.\u00a0</p><p>You cried more when you saw Tony being hooked up to multiple wire on the jet. Peter made you turn away, and soon enough the crying was too much and you fell asleep.\u00a0</p><p>-<i>three days later</i></p><p>You groaned as you started to wake up, not in a hard chair, but a comfortable bed. Your eyes fluttered open, the sunlight\u2019s streaking in through the window. Your eyes landed on Peter who was fastly asleep. head on your bed, hand holding yours. You brought your hand up, rubbing it smoothly through his curls. </p><p>Peter groaned, yawning as he picked up his head. When he finally opened his eyes, it seemed like you could finally breathe. \u201cHey.\u201d You whisper, smiling brightly at him. Peter doesn\u2019t waste time, leaning into your body and capturing your lips. You smiled into the kiss, cupping his cheek. Peter pulled away resting his head on yours.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d He whispered back. </p><p>After the doctors ran a few more check ups on you, and made sure you were ok to leave the room. You had Peter take you to Tony\u2019s room. </p><p>Your heart clutched when you entered the room seeing Tony hooked up to machines, his breathing steady. </p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t woken up yet.\u201d Peter tells you softly. You nod, moving over to the seat by the bed. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just-I\u2019m  just gonna sit with him.\u201d You say softly. Peter nods bending down to kiss the top of your head. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be outside if you need anything. You give Peter a warm smile, turning back to Tony. You let your hand take his, smoothing your thumb on the back of his hand. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d You whisper, leaning your head against the bed, a few tears escaping. </p><p>-</p><p>You spent the next couple of weeks by his side, only getting up to use the bathroom. Either Peter or Steve would come by to give you some food, but you\u2019d only have a bite or two. You spent most of your time talking to Tony, well you hope he could hear you, or you\u2019d just be talking to yourself. You were trying your best to keep it together. There were a few nights where you\u2019d cry because it was driving you crazy. You could feel yourself slipping off the edge, but Peter kept you up, and so did the rest of the time. But even that wasn\u2019t enough. You don\u2019t notice how much you depend on a person, until you loose them.\u00a0</p><p>-</p><p>You were once again, sleeping by Tony\u2019s side, resting your head on the bed, hand softly placed on top of his. It was the middle of the night and Steve had tried once again to get you to sleep in your room, but you refused.\u00a0</p><p>Tony felt himself stir awake, his eyes slowly opening, still feeling the weight of them however. His eyes scanning the dark room, tilting his head a little, then landing on you. He felt his heart ease, <i>you were alive</i>. Tony couldn\u2019t hold back the smile and the tears prickling his eyes. His hand came out from under yours, softly caressing your cheek, you sighing in your sleep.\u00a0</p><p>You began to wake up, you became a pretty light sleeper after the incident. You groaned tiredly, opening your eyes softly. As soon as you caught a glimpse of Tony with his eyes open, yours shot open. Your head picking up. You felt the weight on your heart being lifted. Tony smiled when he saw your content face.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey kid.\u201d He said softly. You broke down, letting the tears coat your cheeks as you flung your arms around his waist resting your on his shoulder. Tony let the tears run down his cheek as well, rubbing your back.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDad.\u201d You felt the words leaving your lips easily, not forced or strangled. They were right.\u00a0\u201cYour awake.\u201d You sniffled, as Tony picked your head up, wiping the tears from your cheeks.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d You let out a soft laugh, followed by more tears.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d You cried as Tony pulled you back in.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry. Your fine. I\u2019m fine. Your not alone.\u201d You clutched Tony\u2019s shirt as you held him closely.\u00a0\u201cI love you y/n, your my baby. You\u2019ll always be my baby.\u201d Tony said softly, as your cries eased.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLove you too Dad.\u201d You replied. Tony felt his heart leap when he heard the three letter word leave your lips. You finally said it, you accepted it and he was going to be there. He was going to be the best father out there, because your his daughter and he\u2019d be damned if he lets you live your life on your own. And your okay with letting him. </p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>A/N: Finally finished the series. Hope you guys liked it and I\u2019m so thankful for the feedback.

Your eyes snapped open, you vision was blurry and you heard a ringing. Soon your eyes focused on the man in front of you. \u201cIt\u2019s about damn fucking time.\u201d He said roughly, moving away to the door to talk to someone. </p><p>Your eyes adjusted to the dull light and that\u2019s when you could make out the person sitting in front of you, also tied down to the chair. </p><p>\u201cTony?\u201d Your voice was scratched but he heard you.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d Tony coughed harshly, spitting blood out of his mouth. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d </p><p>\u201cAlways. Are you?\u201d You asked worriedly. Tony let out a half-hearted laugh.</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d You tried wiggling out of the restraints, but they only seemed to tighten the more you struggled. \u201cStop moving, they\u2019ll only get tighter.\u201d Tony said. </p><p>\u201cWhat? No we can\u2019t just stay here!\u201d You whisper yell, trying not to get the attention of the guy by the door. </p><p>\u201cWell the more you struggle the worse it will get, just calm down.\u201d Tony told you calmly, knowing if his words were harsh you\u2019d panic.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t- I can\u2019t use my powers-\u201c Your panicking.</p><p>\u201cThe cuffs are like the ones I have, they cut your powers.\u201d Tony says.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do-your bleeding?!\u201d You say panicked, your eye catching the gash on his arm. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, we\u2019re fine.\u201d He tells you.</p><p>\u201cWhat?! Your fucking bleeding-\u201c Your sentence is cut off by a slap across your face. </p><p>\u201cDONT FUCKING TOUCH HER!\u201d Tony yelled as he struggled in the restraints. The man turned around facing Tony.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I say about talking?\u201d The man said with a smirk. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck, I said don\u2019t fucking touch her!\u201d Tony yelled, words laced with anger. You moved your jaw, shaking off the pain. </p><p>\u201cYour not one to make the calls here, Mr. Stark.\u201d The man said as he held Tony\u2019s face in his hand.  Tony struggled in his grip, but the man didn\u2019t budge. </p><p>\u201cLeave him alone!\u201d You yelled, making the man smile mischievously. </p><p>\u201cOh, your much like your father.\u201d He said making his way to you. Tony felt his blood boil the closer the man got to you. The mans fingers caressed your cheek, you moved your head away from his hand in disgust. \u201cSo pretty.\u201d </p><p>\u201cLeave her ALONE!\u201d Tony yelled, but before he could say anything more, the man held his hand up and in seconds another man that you hadn\u2019t noticed before, came behind Tony, wrapping a restraint around his mouth. Tony yelled more but his voice was muffled. </p><p>\u201cSilence him.\u201d The man in front of you said, the other man responded by hitting him against the head. Tony winced in pain, and shut up. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s pretty protective over you, ain\u2019t he.\u201d The man said his face coming closer to you.</p><p>\u201cYou needa mint.\u201d You said, as your nose scrunched up. The man laughed, but slapped you across the face once again, this time making your cheek bleed. </p><p>\u201cYou should learn to keep that pretty mouth shut.\u201d You opened and closed your mouth checking if your jaw was fine. After the man saw you were silent he moved away from you going over to the second man. </p><p>\u201cWhat are we gonna do now?\u201d The second man said. </p><p>\u201cWe wait for <i>Him, </i>he\u2019s on his way.\u201d The other answered. </p><p>Tony looked at you, eyes wide. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d You mouthed to him, he nodded. But he knew you were far from fine.</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a week, and you still haven\u2019t found anything?\u201d Steve asked Bruce frustrated.</p><p>\u201cNo I\u2019m working on it.\u201d Bruce said typing on the multiple screens. Steve paced around the room, rubbing his face. Nat stood up from her spot.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find them, don\u2019t worry.\u201d Nat said softly. Steve looked up at Nat the frustration building up.\u201dcmere.\u201d Nat said opening her arms for Steve, which he gladly took.</p><p><i>-two weeks and a half later</i></p><p>\u201cSteve I\u2019ve got something.\u201d Bruce said as she turned the screen so Steve could see. \u201cIts the security tapes, the truck left the city, it\u2019s all the way up in Maine-\u201c Bruce said but was cut of by Peter.</p><p>\u201cThen what are we waiting for!\u201d Peter was sitting by Bruce his fifth coffee in hand.</p><p>\u201cHold on Pete, you need to rest.\u201d Steve said putting an arm on Peters shoulder, but Peter just pushed him away.</p><p>\u201cWhat?! I\u2019m fine-\u201c Peter was actually fine. When he heard the bomb he ran down to the lab to find the guys taking you away and when he yelled one guy had shot him with a taser. But he was fine now. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to take you, we don\u2019t know what\u2019s out there and if Tony finds out we took you to something we didn\u2019t know-\u201c Peters eyes were wide.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going whether you like it or not, I\u2019m the only one here who\u2019s seen how they look and I\u2019m not going to just sit here and do nothing!\u201d Peter felt his blood boil, his fists clenching. Steve looked back at the rest of the team to see what they think.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a kid anymore, he can handle it.\u201d Sam said shrugging. Steve turned back to Peter, looking over him. If he had to be honest, they were right Peter isn\u2019t a kid anymore.</p><p>\u201cFine, but your staying with us, don\u2019t go off on your own.\u201d Steve said sternly. Peter nodded frantically.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Steve patted his shoulder once more and turned back to the team. </p><p>\u201cSuit up!\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>You woke up once again, this time after passing out four times. Both you and Tony were covered in blood, bruises and deep gashes littered your bodies. You held back the tears, not wanting to show weakness. And you knew if you broke down, that Tony would too. The only reason he\u2019s still breathing right now is for you. </p><p>\u201cScrew. You.\u201d You said spitting your blood in the mans face. The man yelled again, punching your gut this time. You groaned in pain, arching forward. </p><p>\u201cLeave her alone.\u201d Tony groaned, it was getting harder and harder for him to speak. Unlike you, Tony was human, he didn\u2019t have any super strength or fast healing, it was getting worse. The man got up fixing his shirt. He traded spots with the other man. And well let\u2019s put it in a not so gory way, he had a sharp knife.\u00a0</p><p>You screamed out in pain, Tony closing his eyes shut as the tears fell from the sides of his eyes. He couldn\u2019t bare to look at you being tortured. After some time the screams died down and both men walked out of the room. Tony finally opened his eyes to find you once again, fainted and laying your head to the side.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He whispered between sobs.\u00a0</p><p><i>Next day</i></p><p>You don\u2019t know how much blood you\u2019ve lost, but you know it\u2019s a lot considering how light-headed your are, and the passing out. The two men walked back into the room, but they\u2019re facial expressions were different then before.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re down to our last straw, tell us the codes!\u201d The man yelled at you both.</p><p>\u201cYou mind keeping your voice a little down, my head kinda hurts.\u201d You teased with a stupid smirk. Tony shook his head at you, letting out a sigh when he saw the man charge over to you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t-\u201d Tony was cut off when the man held his hand up. He leaned down, his face inches away from yours.</p><p>\u201cYou think your funny, don\u2019t you?\u201d He said seriously. You shrugged giving him a sly smirk.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to think.\u201d The man turned around looking at his buddy, then back to you. A humorless laugh leaving his lips. You were expecting him to slap, punch, kick anything, but no, all he did was put a hand up. Before you know it, two people walk in, faces covered in masks. Both men go to Tony untying him and taking him away.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhere are you taking him!\u201d You yelled as Tony tried to fight them off, but the amount of blood he lost making him more weak.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve stayed quiet.\u201d He said, walking out of the room and leaving you alone.\u00a0</p><p>The next few hours were quiet, but then you heard a sharp yell. Your head picked up, you heard it again and again. Tony. You winced hearing his cries and screams. You felt the tears running down your cheek. <i>It\u2019s your fault, it\u2019s your fault. There hurting him.</i>\u00a0You heard various noises, but they all ended in his screams. And that\u2019s when you lost it.\u00a0</p><p>You cried more and more, your heart clenching every time you heard his screams and before you know it your hands were heating up. With one more cry the restraints came burning off and you fell to the ground. You cried more, until your head finally came back. You stood up, holding the chair for balance. You took a few deep breaths, trying to calm yourself. But soon enough, you were back, lighting your hands with energy and blasting the steel door open.\u00a0</p><p>You walked down the hallway, soon hearing footsteps running in your direction. You didn\u2019t bother, when you saw the familiar suits you blasted them, taking your time to let the energy enter there bodies and blow them from the inside out. You had no mercy and you didn\u2019t care. The more you walked, the clearer his screams became, but then they ended. You stopped in your tracks, your heartbeat quickening. You ran to the door you heard him last.\u00a0</p><p>You burned a hole in the door, entering the dark room. The moment yours eyes scanned over the room, your heart broke. They had Tony wrapped up, standing up, as two men beat him and tortured him with <i>tools</i>. Tony wasn\u2019t moving. You shook your head. <i>He\u2019s not dead. no no. </i>The men came charging towards you. You took each one of them, dropping them to the ground and pressing a hand on there chests burning the energy through there body. the only thing you could hear was your heart beat.\u00a0</p><p>You ran to Tony, burning off the restraints, his body falling on you, you held him, laying him on the floor. He rested on you as you cried.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTony, please, please wake up.\u201d You were choking on sobs. Your hand stroking his bloody face. You leaned your forehead down on his as your tears fell on him.\u00a0\u201cD-daddy, w-wake up, I need you. I need you.\u201d You couldn\u2019t feel anything, only the shattering of your heart.\u00a0\u201cplease.\u201d Your body shook, letting all the feeling in.\u00a0</p><p>-</p><p>The team split up, taking different parts of the building.\u00a0</p><p>By the time they all got in, they heard blasting and screams. Steve, Nat and Peter made their way through the buildings. After taking down most of the soliders, they went to each room, looking for you and Tony.\u00a0</p><p>Not long after, Peter turned a corner to hear your cries. He ran quickly and stopped in his tracks when he saw you clutching Tony\u2019s body.\u00a0\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He heard you cry. Steve and Nat stopped next to Peter, both their hearts dropping.\u00a0</p><p>Peter didn\u2019t waste time running to you. Your eyes shot up, locking with Peter. Peter sat on the other side of Tony, his hand on his chest.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cKaren check his vitals.\u201d You continued to stroke Tonys hair, as you waited.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s alive, his heart beat is very slow though. We need to get him back to the compound.\u201d He said quickly looking up at Steve. Steve nodded going over to Tony.\u00a0You looked up eyes wide. Steve struggled to get your grip off of Tony, you didn\u2019t even know, he needed to get in the quinjet, but you couldn\u2019t let go.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/n let go.\u201d Steve said, but your eyes only teared up more.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, I can\u2019t.\u201d You cried, shaking your head\u00a0\u2018no\u2019. Steve looked over your figure. You were broken, you were truly holding on with all your strength.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d Steve looked at Peter, nodding his head to you. Peter nodded coming behind you, tugging your hands out of the grip. You cried louder when you lost contact with Tony. Steve picked Tony up, as Peter held you back.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to be fine. Your fine. We\u2019re here.\u201d Peter whispered in your ear, as you cried. You continued to cry, until Peter picked you up and carried you to the quinjet.\u00a0</p><p>You cried more when you saw Tony being hooked up to multiple wire on the jet. Peter made you turn away, and soon enough the crying was too much and you fell asleep.\u00a0</p><p>-<i>three days later</i></p><p>You groaned as you started to wake up, not in a hard chair, but a comfortable bed. Your eyes fluttered open, the sunlight\u2019s streaking in through the window. Your eyes landed on Peter who was fastly asleep. head on your bed, hand holding yours. You brought your hand up, rubbing it smoothly through his curls. </p><p>Peter groaned, yawning as he picked up his head. When he finally opened his eyes, it seemed like you could finally breathe. \u201cHey.\u201d You whisper, smiling brightly at him. Peter doesn\u2019t waste time, leaning into your body and capturing your lips. You smiled into the kiss, cupping his cheek. Peter pulled away resting his head on yours.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d He whispered back. </p><p>After the doctors ran a few more check ups on you, and made sure you were ok to leave the room. You had Peter take you to Tony\u2019s room. </p><p>Your heart clutched when you entered the room seeing Tony hooked up to machines, his breathing steady. </p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t woken up yet.\u201d Peter tells you softly. You nod, moving over to the seat by the bed. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just-I\u2019m  just gonna sit with him.\u201d You say softly. Peter nods bending down to kiss the top of your head. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be outside if you need anything. You give Peter a warm smile, turning back to Tony. You let your hand take his, smoothing your thumb on the back of his hand. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d You whisper, leaning your head against the bed, a few tears escaping. </p><p>-</p><p>You spent the next couple of weeks by his side, only getting up to use the bathroom. Either Peter or Steve would come by to give you some food, but you\u2019d only have a bite or two. You spent most of your time talking to Tony, well you hope he could hear you, or you\u2019d just be talking to yourself. You were trying your best to keep it together. There were a few nights where you\u2019d cry because it was driving you crazy. You could feel yourself slipping off the edge, but Peter kept you up, and so did the rest of the time. But even that wasn\u2019t enough. You don\u2019t notice how much you depend on a person, until you loose them.\u00a0</p><p>-</p><p>You were once again, sleeping by Tony\u2019s side, resting your head on the bed, hand softly placed on top of his. It was the middle of the night and Steve had tried once again to get you to sleep in your room, but you refused.\u00a0</p><p>Tony felt himself stir awake, his eyes slowly opening, still feeling the weight of them however. His eyes scanning the dark room, tilting his head a little, then landing on you. He felt his heart ease, <i>you were alive</i>. Tony couldn\u2019t hold back the smile and the tears prickling his eyes. His hand came out from under yours, softly caressing your cheek, you sighing in your sleep.\u00a0</p><p>You began to wake up, you became a pretty light sleeper after the incident. You groaned tiredly, opening your eyes softly. As soon as you caught a glimpse of Tony with his eyes open, yours shot open. Your head picking up. You felt the weight on your heart being lifted. Tony smiled when he saw your content face.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey kid.\u201d He said softly. You broke down, letting the tears coat your cheeks as you flung your arms around his waist resting your on his shoulder. Tony let the tears run down his cheek as well, rubbing your back.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDad.\u201d You felt the words leaving your lips easily, not forced or strangled. They were right.\u00a0\u201cYour awake.\u201d You sniffled, as Tony picked your head up, wiping the tears from your cheeks.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d You let out a soft laugh, followed by more tears.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d You cried as Tony pulled you back in.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry. Your fine. I\u2019m fine. Your not alone.\u201d You clutched Tony\u2019s shirt as you held him closely.\u00a0\u201cI love you y/n, your my baby. You\u2019ll always be my baby.\u201d Tony said softly, as your cries eased.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLove you too Dad.\u201d You replied. Tony felt his heart leap when he heard the three letter word leave your lips. You finally said it, you accepted it and he was going to be there. He was going to be the best father out there, because your his daughter and he\u2019d be damned if he lets you live your life on your own. And your okay with letting him. </p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>A/N: Finally finished the series. Hope you guys liked it and I\u2019m so thankful for the feedback.

Her path going in a different direction.</p><p><b>Warning</b>: Language, angst, fluff, violence,</p><p><b>Word count</b>: 3K</p><p><b>A/N: </b>Guys I feel so bad, legit I kept procrastinating this last part. But I finally finished the series, and I think I might start a new one but Tom Holland. I\u2019m just so happy for those of you who actually read this series and enjoy it. Thanks for sticking with me :)</p><figure data-orig-width=\"250\" data-orig-height=\"338\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e638d34f5ce86cf6d1ec0cb792b2a992/tumblr_inline_pn1u0rPLDj1woenma_250.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"250\" data-orig-height=\"338\"></figure><p>\u201cWake up!\u201d You heard someone yell then you felt ice water hit your face. Your eyes snapped open, you vision was blurry and you heard a ringing. Soon your eyes focused on the man in front of you. \u201cIt\u2019s about damn fucking time.\u201d He said roughly, moving away to the door to talk to someone. </p><p>Your eyes adjusted to the dull light and that\u2019s when you could make out the person sitting in front of you, also tied down to the chair. </p><p>\u201cTony?\u201d Your voice was scratched but he heard you.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d Tony coughed harshly, spitting blood out of his mouth. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d </p><p>\u201cAlways. Are you?\u201d You asked worriedly. Tony let out a half-hearted laugh.</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d You tried wiggling out of the restraints, but they only seemed to tighten the more you struggled. \u201cStop moving, they\u2019ll only get tighter.\u201d Tony said. </p><p>\u201cWhat? No we can\u2019t just stay here!\u201d You whisper yell, trying not to get the attention of the guy by the door. </p><p>\u201cWell the more you struggle the worse it will get, just calm down.\u201d Tony told you calmly, knowing if his words were harsh you\u2019d panic.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t- I can\u2019t use my powers-\u201c Your panicking.</p><p>\u201cThe cuffs are like the ones I have, they cut your powers.\u201d Tony says.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do-your bleeding?!\u201d You say panicked, your eye catching the gash on his arm. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, we\u2019re fine.\u201d He tells you.</p><p>\u201cWhat?! Your fucking bleeding-\u201c Your sentence is cut off by a slap across your face. </p><p>\u201cDONT FUCKING TOUCH HER!\u201d Tony yelled as he struggled in the restraints. The man turned around facing Tony.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I say about talking?\u201d The man said with a smirk. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck, I said don\u2019t fucking touch her!\u201d Tony yelled, words laced with anger. You moved your jaw, shaking off the pain. </p><p>\u201cYour not one to make the calls here, Mr. Stark.\u201d The man said as he held Tony\u2019s face in his hand.  Tony struggled in his grip, but the man didn\u2019t budge. </p><p>\u201cLeave him alone!\u201d You yelled, making the man smile mischievously. </p><p>\u201cOh, your much like your father.\u201d He said making his way to you. Tony felt his blood boil the closer the man got to you. The mans fingers caressed your cheek, you moved your head away from his hand in disgust. \u201cSo pretty.\u201d </p><p>\u201cLeave her ALONE!\u201d Tony yelled, but before he could say anything more, the man held his hand up and in seconds another man that you hadn\u2019t noticed before, came behind Tony, wrapping a restraint around his mouth. Tony yelled more but his voice was muffled. </p><p>\u201cSilence him.\u201d The man in front of you said, the other man responded by hitting him against the head. Tony winced in pain, and shut up. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s pretty protective over you, ain\u2019t he.\u201d The man said his face coming closer to you.</p><p>\u201cYou needa mint.\u201d You said, as your nose scrunched up. The man laughed, but slapped you across the face once again, this time making your cheek bleed. </p><p>\u201cYou should learn to keep that pretty mouth shut.\u201d You opened and closed your mouth checking if your jaw was fine. After the man saw you were silent he moved away from you going over to the second man. </p><p>\u201cWhat are we gonna do now?\u201d The second man said. </p><p>\u201cWe wait for <i>Him, </i>he\u2019s on his way.\u201d The other answered. </p><p>Tony looked at you, eyes wide. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d You mouthed to him, he nodded. But he knew you were far from fine.</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a week, and you still haven\u2019t found anything?\u201d Steve asked Bruce frustrated.</p><p>\u201cNo I\u2019m working on it.\u201d Bruce said typing on the multiple screens. Steve paced around the room, rubbing his face. Nat stood up from her spot.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find them, don\u2019t worry.\u201d Nat said softly. Steve looked up at Nat the frustration building up.\u201dcmere.\u201d Nat said opening her arms for Steve, which he gladly took.</p><p><i>-two weeks and a half later</i></p><p>\u201cSteve I\u2019ve got something.\u201d Bruce said as she turned the screen so Steve could see. \u201cIts the security tapes, the truck left the city, it\u2019s all the way up in Maine-\u201c Bruce said but was cut of by Peter.</p><p>\u201cThen what are we waiting for!\u201d Peter was sitting by Bruce his fifth coffee in hand.</p><p>\u201cHold on Pete, you need to rest.\u201d Steve said putting an arm on Peters shoulder, but Peter just pushed him away.</p><p>\u201cWhat?! I\u2019m fine-\u201c Peter was actually fine. When he heard the bomb he ran down to the lab to find the guys taking you away and when he yelled one guy had shot him with a taser. But he was fine now. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to take you, we don\u2019t know what\u2019s out there and if Tony finds out we took you to something we didn\u2019t know-\u201c Peters eyes were wide.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going whether you like it or not, I\u2019m the only one here who\u2019s seen how they look and I\u2019m not going to just sit here and do nothing!\u201d Peter felt his blood boil, his fists clenching. Steve looked back at the rest of the team to see what they think.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a kid anymore, he can handle it.\u201d Sam said shrugging. Steve turned back to Peter, looking over him. If he had to be honest, they were right Peter isn\u2019t a kid anymore.</p><p>\u201cFine, but your staying with us, don\u2019t go off on your own.\u201d Steve said sternly. Peter nodded frantically.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Steve patted his shoulder once more and turned back to the team. </p><p>\u201cSuit up!\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>You woke up once again, this time after passing out four times. Both you and Tony were covered in blood, bruises and deep gashes littered your bodies. You held back the tears, not wanting to show weakness. And you knew if you broke down, that Tony would too. The only reason he\u2019s still breathing right now is for you. </p><p>\u201cScrew. You.\u201d You said spitting your blood in the mans face. The man yelled again, punching your gut this time. You groaned in pain, arching forward. </p><p>\u201cLeave her alone.\u201d Tony groaned, it was getting harder and harder for him to speak. Unlike you, Tony was human, he didn\u2019t have any super strength or fast healing, it was getting worse. The man got up fixing his shirt. He traded spots with the other man. And well let\u2019s put it in a not so gory way, he had a sharp knife.\u00a0</p><p>You screamed out in pain, Tony closing his eyes shut as the tears fell from the sides of his eyes. He couldn\u2019t bare to look at you being tortured. After some time the screams died down and both men walked out of the room. Tony finally opened his eyes to find you once again, fainted and laying your head to the side.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He whispered between sobs.\u00a0</p><p><i>Next day</i></p><p>You don\u2019t know how much blood you\u2019ve lost, but you know it\u2019s a lot considering how light-headed your are, and the passing out. The two men walked back into the room, but they\u2019re facial expressions were different then before.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re down to our last straw, tell us the codes!\u201d The man yelled at you both.</p><p>\u201cYou mind keeping your voice a little down, my head kinda hurts.\u201d You teased with a stupid smirk. Tony shook his head at you, letting out a sigh when he saw the man charge over to you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t-\u201d Tony was cut off when the man held his hand up. He leaned down, his face inches away from yours.</p><p>\u201cYou think your funny, don\u2019t you?\u201d He said seriously. You shrugged giving him a sly smirk.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to think.\u201d The man turned around looking at his buddy, then back to you. A humorless laugh leaving his lips. You were expecting him to slap, punch, kick anything, but no, all he did was put a hand up. Before you know it, two people walk in, faces covered in masks. Both men go to Tony untying him and taking him away.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhere are you taking him!\u201d You yelled as Tony tried to fight them off, but the amount of blood he lost making him more weak.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve stayed quiet.\u201d He said, walking out of the room and leaving you alone.\u00a0</p><p>The next few hours were quiet, but then you heard a sharp yell. Your head picked up, you heard it again and again. Tony. You winced hearing his cries and screams. You felt the tears running down your cheek. <i>It\u2019s your fault, it\u2019s your fault. There hurting him.</i>\u00a0You heard various noises, but they all ended in his screams. And that\u2019s when you lost it.\u00a0</p><p>You cried more and more, your heart clenching every time you heard his screams and before you know it your hands were heating up. With one more cry the restraints came burning off and you fell to the ground. You cried more, until your head finally came back. You stood up, holding the chair for balance. You took a few deep breaths, trying to calm yourself. But soon enough, you were back, lighting your hands with energy and blasting the steel door open.\u00a0</p><p>You walked down the hallway, soon hearing footsteps running in your direction. You didn\u2019t bother, when you saw the familiar suits you blasted them, taking your time to let the energy enter there bodies and blow them from the inside out. You had no mercy and you didn\u2019t care. The more you walked, the clearer his screams became, but then they ended. You stopped in your tracks, your heartbeat quickening. You ran to the door you heard him last.\u00a0</p><p>You burned a hole in the door, entering the dark room. The moment yours eyes scanned over the room, your heart broke. They had Tony wrapped up, standing up, as two men beat him and tortured him with <i>tools</i>. Tony wasn\u2019t moving. You shook your head. <i>He\u2019s not dead. no no. </i>The men came charging towards you. You took each one of them, dropping them to the ground and pressing a hand on there chests burning the energy through there body. the only thing you could hear was your heart beat.\u00a0</p><p>You ran to Tony, burning off the restraints, his body falling on you, you held him, laying him on the floor. He rested on you as you cried.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTony, please, please wake up.\u201d You were choking on sobs. Your hand stroking his bloody face. You leaned your forehead down on his as your tears fell on him.\u00a0\u201cD-daddy, w-wake up, I need you. I need you.\u201d You couldn\u2019t feel anything, only the shattering of your heart.\u00a0\u201cplease.\u201d Your body shook, letting all the feeling in.\u00a0</p><p>-</p><p>The team split up, taking different parts of the building.\u00a0</p><p>By the time they all got in, they heard blasting and screams. Steve, Nat and Peter made their way through the buildings. After taking down most of the soliders, they went to each room, looking for you and Tony.\u00a0</p><p>Not long after, Peter turned a corner to hear your cries. He ran quickly and stopped in his tracks when he saw you clutching Tony\u2019s body.\u00a0\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He heard you cry. Steve and Nat stopped next to Peter, both their hearts dropping.\u00a0</p><p>Peter didn\u2019t waste time running to you. Your eyes shot up, locking with Peter. Peter sat on the other side of Tony, his hand on his chest.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cKaren check his vitals.\u201d You continued to stroke Tonys hair, as you waited.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s alive, his heart beat is very slow though. We need to get him back to the compound.\u201d He said quickly looking up at Steve. Steve nodded going over to Tony.\u00a0You looked up eyes wide. Steve struggled to get your grip off of Tony, you didn\u2019t even know, he needed to get in the quinjet, but you couldn\u2019t let go.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/n let go.\u201d Steve said, but your eyes only teared up more.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, I can\u2019t.\u201d You cried, shaking your head\u00a0\u2018no\u2019. Steve looked over your figure. You were broken, you were truly holding on with all your strength.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d Steve looked at Peter, nodding his head to you. Peter nodded coming behind you, tugging your hands out of the grip. You cried louder when you lost contact with Tony. Steve picked Tony up, as Peter held you back.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to be fine. Your fine. We\u2019re here.\u201d Peter whispered in your ear, as you cried. You continued to cry, until Peter picked you up and carried you to the quinjet.\u00a0</p><p>You cried more when you saw Tony being hooked up to multiple wire on the jet. Peter made you turn away, and soon enough the crying was too much and you fell asleep.\u00a0</p><p>-<i>three days later</i></p><p>You groaned as you started to wake up, not in a hard chair, but a comfortable bed. Your eyes fluttered open, the sunlight\u2019s streaking in through the window. Your eyes landed on Peter who was fastly asleep. head on your bed, hand holding yours. You brought your hand up, rubbing it smoothly through his curls. </p><p>Peter groaned, yawning as he picked up his head. When he finally opened his eyes, it seemed like you could finally breathe. \u201cHey.\u201d You whisper, smiling brightly at him. Peter doesn\u2019t waste time, leaning into your body and capturing your lips. You smiled into the kiss, cupping his cheek. Peter pulled away resting his head on yours.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d He whispered back. </p><p>After the doctors ran a few more check ups on you, and made sure you were ok to leave the room. You had Peter take you to Tony\u2019s room. </p><p>Your heart clutched when you entered the room seeing Tony hooked up to machines, his breathing steady. </p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t woken up yet.\u201d Peter tells you softly. You nod, moving over to the seat by the bed. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just-I\u2019m  just gonna sit with him.\u201d You say softly. Peter nods bending down to kiss the top of your head. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be outside if you need anything. You give Peter a warm smile, turning back to Tony. You let your hand take his, smoothing your thumb on the back of his hand. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d You whisper, leaning your head against the bed, a few tears escaping. </p><p>-</p><p>You spent the next couple of weeks by his side, only getting up to use the bathroom. Either Peter or Steve would come by to give you some food, but you\u2019d only have a bite or two. You spent most of your time talking to Tony, well you hope he could hear you, or you\u2019d just be talking to yourself. You were trying your best to keep it together. There were a few nights where you\u2019d cry because it was driving you crazy. You could feel yourself slipping off the edge, but Peter kept you up, and so did the rest of the time. But even that wasn\u2019t enough. You don\u2019t notice how much you depend on a person, until you loose them.\u00a0</p><p>-</p><p>You were once again, sleeping by Tony\u2019s side, resting your head on the bed, hand softly placed on top of his. It was the middle of the night and Steve had tried once again to get you to sleep in your room, but you refused.\u00a0</p><p>Tony felt himself stir awake, his eyes slowly opening, still feeling the weight of them however. His eyes scanning the dark room, tilting his head a little, then landing on you. He felt his heart ease, <i>you were alive</i>. Tony couldn\u2019t hold back the smile and the tears prickling his eyes. His hand came out from under yours, softly caressing your cheek, you sighing in your sleep.\u00a0</p><p>You began to wake up, you became a pretty light sleeper after the incident. You groaned tiredly, opening your eyes softly. As soon as you caught a glimpse of Tony with his eyes open, yours shot open. Your head picking up. You felt the weight on your heart being lifted. Tony smiled when he saw your content face.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey kid.\u201d He said softly. You broke down, letting the tears coat your cheeks as you flung your arms around his waist resting your on his shoulder. Tony let the tears run down his cheek as well, rubbing your back.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDad.\u201d You felt the words leaving your lips easily, not forced or strangled. They were right.\u00a0\u201cYour awake.\u201d You sniffled, as Tony picked your head up, wiping the tears from your cheeks.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d You let out a soft laugh, followed by more tears.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d You cried as Tony pulled you back in.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry. Your fine. I\u2019m fine. Your not alone.\u201d You clutched Tony\u2019s shirt as you held him closely.\u00a0\u201cI love you y/n, your my baby. You\u2019ll always be my baby.\u201d Tony said softly, as your cries eased.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cLove you too Dad.\u201d You replied. Tony felt his heart leap when he heard the three letter word leave your lips. You finally said it, you accepted it and he was going to be there. He was going to be the best father out there, because your his daughter and he\u2019d be damned if he lets you live your life on your own. And your okay with letting him. </p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>A/N: Finally finished the series. Hope you guys liked it and I\u2019m so thankful for the feedback.

Your eyes snapped open, you vision was blurry and you heard a ringing. Soon your eyes focused on the man in front of you. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about damn fucking time.&rdquo; He said roughly, moving away to the door to talk to someone. </p><p>Your eyes adjusted to the dull light and that&rsquo;s when you could make out the person sitting in front of you, also tied down to the chair. </p><p>&ldquo;Tony?&rdquo; Your voice was scratched but he heard you.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me.&rdquo; Tony coughed harshly, spitting blood out of his mouth. &ldquo;Are you alright?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Always. Are you?&rdquo; You asked worriedly. Tony let out a half-hearted laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;Always.&rdquo; You tried wiggling out of the restraints, but they only seemed to tighten the more you struggled. &ldquo;Stop moving, they&rsquo;ll only get tighter.&rdquo; Tony said. </p><p>&ldquo;What? No we can&rsquo;t just stay here!&rdquo; You whisper yell, trying not to get the attention of the guy by the door. </p><p>&ldquo;Well the more you struggle the worse it will get, just calm down.&rdquo; Tony told you calmly, knowing if his words were harsh you&rsquo;d panic.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t- I can&rsquo;t use my powers-&ldquo; Your panicking.</p><p>&ldquo;The cuffs are like the ones I have, they cut your powers.&rdquo; Tony says.</p><p>&ldquo;What are we going to do-your bleeding?!&rdquo; You say panicked, your eye catching the gash on his arm. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, we&rsquo;re fine.&rdquo; He tells you.</p><p>&ldquo;What?! Your fucking bleeding-&ldquo; Your sentence is cut off by a slap across your face. </p><p>&ldquo;DONT FUCKING TOUCH HER!&rdquo; Tony yelled as he struggled in the restraints. The man turned around facing Tony.</p><p>&ldquo;What did I say about talking?&rdquo; The man said with a smirk. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t give a fuck, I said don&rsquo;t fucking touch her!&rdquo; Tony yelled, words laced with anger. You moved your jaw, shaking off the pain. </p><p>&ldquo;Your not one to make the calls here, Mr. Stark.&rdquo; The man said as he held Tony&rsquo;s face in his hand.  Tony struggled in his grip, but the man didn&rsquo;t budge. </p><p>&ldquo;Leave him alone!&rdquo; You yelled, making the man smile mischievously. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, your much like your father.&rdquo; He said making his way to you. Tony felt his blood boil the closer the man got to you. The mans fingers caressed your cheek, you moved your head away from his hand in disgust. &ldquo;So pretty.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Leave her ALONE!&rdquo; Tony yelled, but before he could say anything more, the man held his hand up and in seconds another man that you hadn&rsquo;t noticed before, came behind Tony, wrapping a restraint around his mouth. Tony yelled more but his voice was muffled. </p><p>&ldquo;Silence him.&rdquo; The man in front of you said, the other man responded by hitting him against the head. Tony winced in pain, and shut up. </p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s pretty protective over you, ain&rsquo;t he.&rdquo; The man said his face coming closer to you.</p><p>&ldquo;You needa mint.&rdquo; You said, as your nose scrunched up. The man laughed, but slapped you across the face once again, this time making your cheek bleed. </p><p>&ldquo;You should learn to keep that pretty mouth shut.&rdquo; You opened and closed your mouth checking if your jaw was fine. After the man saw you were silent he moved away from you going over to the second man. </p><p>&ldquo;What are we gonna do now?&rdquo; The second man said. </p><p>&ldquo;We wait for <i>Him, </i>he&rsquo;s on his way.&rdquo; The other answered. </p><p>Tony looked at you, eyes wide. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo; You mouthed to him, he nodded. But he knew you were far from fine.</p><p>-</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a week, and you still haven&rsquo;t found anything?&rdquo; Steve asked Bruce frustrated.</p><p>&ldquo;No I&rsquo;m working on it.&rdquo; Bruce said typing on the multiple screens. Steve paced around the room, rubbing his face. Nat stood up from her spot.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find them, don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo; Nat said softly. Steve looked up at Nat the frustration building up.&rdquo;cmere.&rdquo; Nat said opening her arms for Steve, which he gladly took.</p><p><i>-two weeks and a half later</i></p><p>&ldquo;Steve I&rsquo;ve got something.&rdquo; Bruce said as she turned the screen so Steve could see. &ldquo;Its the security tapes, the truck left the city, it&rsquo;s all the way up in Maine-&ldquo; Bruce said but was cut of by Peter.</p><p>&ldquo;Then what are we waiting for!&rdquo; Peter was sitting by Bruce his fifth coffee in hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Hold on Pete, you need to rest.&rdquo; Steve said putting an arm on Peters shoulder, but Peter just pushed him away.</p><p>&ldquo;What?! I&rsquo;m fine-&ldquo; Peter was actually fine. When he heard the bomb he ran down to the lab to find the guys taking you away and when he yelled one guy had shot him with a taser. But he was fine now. </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going to take you, we don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s out there and if Tony finds out we took you to something we didn&rsquo;t know-&ldquo; Peters eyes were wide.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going whether you like it or not, I&rsquo;m the only one here who&rsquo;s seen how they look and I&rsquo;m not going to just sit here and do nothing!&rdquo; Peter felt his blood boil, his fists clenching. Steve looked back at the rest of the team to see what they think.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not a kid anymore, he can handle it.&rdquo; Sam said shrugging. Steve turned back to Peter, looking over him. If he had to be honest, they were right Peter isn&rsquo;t a kid anymore.</p><p>&ldquo;Fine, but your staying with us, don&rsquo;t go off on your own.&rdquo; Steve said sternly. Peter nodded frantically.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; Steve patted his shoulder once more and turned back to the team. </p><p>&ldquo;Suit up!&rdquo;</p><p>-</p><p>You woke up once again, this time after passing out four times. Both you and Tony were covered in blood, bruises and deep gashes littered your bodies. You held back the tears, not wanting to show weakness. And you knew if you broke down, that Tony would too. The only reason he&rsquo;s still breathing right now is for you. </p><p>&ldquo;Screw. You.&rdquo; You said spitting your blood in the mans face. The man yelled again, punching your gut this time. You groaned in pain, arching forward. </p><p>&ldquo;Leave her alone.&rdquo; Tony groaned, it was getting harder and harder for him to speak. Unlike you, Tony was human, he didn&rsquo;t have any super strength or fast healing, it was getting worse. The man got up fixing his shirt. He traded spots with the other man. And well let&rsquo;s put it in a not so gory way, he had a sharp knife.&nbsp;</p><p>You screamed out in pain, Tony closing his eyes shut as the tears fell from the sides of his eyes. He couldn&rsquo;t bare to look at you being tortured. After some time the screams died down and both men walked out of the room. Tony finally opened his eyes to find you once again, fainted and laying your head to the side.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; He whispered between sobs.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Next day</i></p><p>You don&rsquo;t know how much blood you&rsquo;ve lost, but you know it&rsquo;s a lot considering how light-headed your are, and the passing out. The two men walked back into the room, but they&rsquo;re facial expressions were different then before.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re down to our last straw, tell us the codes!&rdquo; The man yelled at you both.</p><p>&ldquo;You mind keeping your voice a little down, my head kinda hurts.&rdquo; You teased with a stupid smirk. Tony shook his head at you, letting out a sigh when he saw the man charge over to you.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t-&rdquo; Tony was cut off when the man held his hand up. He leaned down, his face inches away from yours.</p><p>&ldquo;You think your funny, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; He said seriously. You shrugged giving him a sly smirk.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to think.&rdquo; The man turned around looking at his buddy, then back to you. A humorless laugh leaving his lips. You were expecting him to slap, punch, kick anything, but no, all he did was put a hand up. Before you know it, two people walk in, faces covered in masks. Both men go to Tony untying him and taking him away.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Where are you taking him!&rdquo; You yelled as Tony tried to fight them off, but the amount of blood he lost making him more weak.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You should&rsquo;ve stayed quiet.&rdquo; He said, walking out of the room and leaving you alone.&nbsp;</p><p>The next few hours were quiet, but then you heard a sharp yell. Your head picked up, you heard it again and again. Tony. You winced hearing his cries and screams. You felt the tears running down your cheek. <i>It&rsquo;s your fault, it&rsquo;s your fault. There hurting him.</i>&nbsp;You heard various noises, but they all ended in his screams. And that&rsquo;s when you lost it.&nbsp;</p><p>You cried more and more, your heart clenching every time you heard his screams and before you know it your hands were heating up. With one more cry the restraints came burning off and you fell to the ground. You cried more, until your head finally came back. You stood up, holding the chair for balance. You took a few deep breaths, trying to calm yourself. But soon enough, you were back, lighting your hands with energy and blasting the steel door open.&nbsp;</p><p>You walked down the hallway, soon hearing footsteps running in your direction. You didn&rsquo;t bother, when you saw the familiar suits you blasted them, taking your time to let the energy enter there bodies and blow them from the inside out. You had no mercy and you didn&rsquo;t care. The more you walked, the clearer his screams became, but then they ended. You stopped in your tracks, your heartbeat quickening. You ran to the door you heard him last.&nbsp;</p><p>You burned a hole in the door, entering the dark room. The moment yours eyes scanned over the room, your heart broke. They had Tony wrapped up, standing up, as two men beat him and tortured him with <i>tools</i>. Tony wasn&rsquo;t moving. You shook your head. <i>He&rsquo;s not dead. no no. </i>The men came charging towards you. You took each one of them, dropping them to the ground and pressing a hand on there chests burning the energy through there body. the only thing you could hear was your heart beat.&nbsp;</p><p>You ran to Tony, burning off the restraints, his body falling on you, you held him, laying him on the floor. He rested on you as you cried.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony, please, please wake up.&rdquo; You were choking on sobs. Your hand stroking his bloody face. You leaned your forehead down on his as your tears fell on him.&nbsp;&ldquo;D-daddy, w-wake up, I need you. I need you.&rdquo; You couldn&rsquo;t feel anything, only the shattering of your heart.&nbsp;&ldquo;please.&rdquo; Your body shook, letting all the feeling in.&nbsp;</p><p>-</p><p>The team split up, taking different parts of the building.&nbsp;</p><p>By the time they all got in, they heard blasting and screams. Steve, Nat and Peter made their way through the buildings. After taking down most of the soliders, they went to each room, looking for you and Tony.&nbsp;</p><p>Not long after, Peter turned a corner to hear your cries. He ran quickly and stopped in his tracks when he saw you clutching Tony&rsquo;s body.&nbsp;&ldquo;I-I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; He heard you cry. Steve and Nat stopped next to Peter, both their hearts dropping.&nbsp;</p><p>Peter didn&rsquo;t waste time running to you. Your eyes shot up, locking with Peter. Peter sat on the other side of Tony, his hand on his chest.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Karen check his vitals.&rdquo; You continued to stroke Tonys hair, as you waited.&nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s alive, his heart beat is very slow though. We need to get him back to the compound.&rdquo; He said quickly looking up at Steve. Steve nodded going over to Tony.&nbsp;You looked up eyes wide. Steve struggled to get your grip off of Tony, you didn&rsquo;t even know, he needed to get in the quinjet, but you couldn&rsquo;t let go.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/n let go.&rdquo; Steve said, but your eyes only teared up more.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; You cried, shaking your head&nbsp;&lsquo;no&rsquo;. Steve looked over your figure. You were broken, you were truly holding on with all your strength.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Peter.&rdquo; Steve looked at Peter, nodding his head to you. Peter nodded coming behind you, tugging your hands out of the grip. You cried louder when you lost contact with Tony. Steve picked Tony up, as Peter held you back.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to be fine. Your fine. We&rsquo;re here.&rdquo; Peter whispered in your ear, as you cried. You continued to cry, until Peter picked you up and carried you to the quinjet.&nbsp;</p><p>You cried more when you saw Tony being hooked up to multiple wire on the jet. Peter made you turn away, and soon enough the crying was too much and you fell asleep.&nbsp;</p><p>-<i>three days later</i></p><p>You groaned as you started to wake up, not in a hard chair, but a comfortable bed. Your eyes fluttered open, the sunlight&rsquo;s streaking in through the window. Your eyes landed on Peter who was fastly asleep. head on your bed, hand holding yours. You brought your hand up, rubbing it smoothly through his curls. </p><p>Peter groaned, yawning as he picked up his head. When he finally opened his eyes, it seemed like you could finally breathe. &ldquo;Hey.&rdquo; You whisper, smiling brightly at him. Peter doesn&rsquo;t waste time, leaning into your body and capturing your lips. You smiled into the kiss, cupping his cheek. Peter pulled away resting his head on yours.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey.&rdquo; He whispered back. </p><p>After the doctors ran a few more check ups on you, and made sure you were ok to leave the room. You had Peter take you to Tony&rsquo;s room. </p><p>Your heart clutched when you entered the room seeing Tony hooked up to machines, his breathing steady. </p><p>&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t woken up yet.&rdquo; Peter tells you softly. You nod, moving over to the seat by the bed. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just-I&rsquo;m  just gonna sit with him.&rdquo; You say softly. Peter nods bending down to kiss the top of your head. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be outside if you need anything. You give Peter a warm smile, turning back to Tony. You let your hand take his, smoothing your thumb on the back of his hand. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; You whisper, leaning your head against the bed, a few tears escaping. </p><p>-</p><p>You spent the next couple of weeks by his side, only getting up to use the bathroom. Either Peter or Steve would come by to give you some food, but you&rsquo;d only have a bite or two. You spent most of your time talking to Tony, well you hope he could hear you, or you&rsquo;d just be talking to yourself. You were trying your best to keep it together. There were a few nights where you&rsquo;d cry because it was driving you crazy. You could feel yourself slipping off the edge, but Peter kept you up, and so did the rest of the time. But even that wasn&rsquo;t enough. You don&rsquo;t notice how much you depend on a person, until you loose them.&nbsp;</p><p>-</p><p>You were once again, sleeping by Tony&rsquo;s side, resting your head on the bed, hand softly placed on top of his. It was the middle of the night and Steve had tried once again to get you to sleep in your room, but you refused.&nbsp;</p><p>Tony felt himself stir awake, his eyes slowly opening, still feeling the weight of them however. His eyes scanning the dark room, tilting his head a little, then landing on you. He felt his heart ease, <i>you were alive</i>. Tony couldn&rsquo;t hold back the smile and the tears prickling his eyes. His hand came out from under yours, softly caressing your cheek, you sighing in your sleep.&nbsp;</p><p>You began to wake up, you became a pretty light sleeper after the incident. You groaned tiredly, opening your eyes softly. As soon as you caught a glimpse of Tony with his eyes open, yours shot open. Your head picking up. You felt the weight on your heart being lifted. Tony smiled when he saw your content face.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey kid.&rdquo; He said softly. You broke down, letting the tears coat your cheeks as you flung your arms around his waist resting your on his shoulder. Tony let the tears run down his cheek as well, rubbing your back.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Dad.&rdquo; You felt the words leaving your lips easily, not forced or strangled. They were right.&nbsp;&ldquo;Your awake.&rdquo; You sniffled, as Tony picked your head up, wiping the tears from your cheeks.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo; You let out a soft laugh, followed by more tears.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; You cried as Tony pulled you back in.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be sorry. Your fine. I&rsquo;m fine. Your not alone.&rdquo; You clutched Tony&rsquo;s shirt as you held him closely.&nbsp;&ldquo;I love you y/n, your my baby. You&rsquo;ll always be my baby.&rdquo; Tony said softly, as your cries eased.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Love you too Dad.&rdquo; You replied. Tony felt his heart leap when he heard the three letter word leave your lips. You finally said it, you accepted it and he was going to be there. He was going to be the best father out there, because your his daughter and he&rsquo;d be damned if he lets you live your life on your own. And your okay with letting him. </p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>-</p><p>A/N: Finally finished the series. Hope you guys liked it and I&rsquo;m so thankful for the feedback.
