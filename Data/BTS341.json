He could find the tiniest positive thing in any moment, every word. And he made sure everyone around him always had a smile on their faces. He just radiated energy and naturally, all his friends loved him for it.</p><p>The days when his cloud of happiness left him were few and far between. A grumpy mood after an all-nighter or a new hair colour not turning out how he wanted it to were nothing to cry about.</p><p>Today, thought, Taehyung wasn\u2019t in the best mood. He was tired, and grumpy, and did he mention tired? It was one of those rare days when his sunny personality needed to recharge, and it seemed like fate, or God, or whoever is in charge of those things, was trying their best to help him.</p><p>Nobody could keep the frown on their face if their soulmate was the sweetest person in the world.</p><p>&ldquo;Jimin-hyung, wait for me!&rdquo; Taehyung yelled after his best friend, jogging to catch up to the pink-haired boy. He swung his backpack over his shoulder as he slowed down next to him, the other not bothering to glance up from his phone.</p><p>Taehyung leaned in to sneak a glance at Jimin&rsquo;s phone screen.</p><p>&ldquo;Is Yoongi-hyung joining us for coffee later?&rdquo; he asked with a smile, already thinking of the coconut latt\u00e9 he&rsquo;s become addicted to in the past few months.</p><p>Jimin typed out a reply and put away his phone, finally meeting the other&rsquo;s eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes he is, his lecture ends early today so he&rsquo;ll wait for us there.&rdquo;</p><p>Taehyung nodded once, skipping ahead in the direction of the lecture hall the two were headed to. He stopped a few feet away, waiting for his (&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not short, I\u2019m travel sized!\u201d) tiny friend. Making exaggerated serious faces, both of them saluted each other, mentally preparing themselves for the two-hours-long battle against sleep in the most boring and useless class of the week.</p><p>History.</p><p>When they arrived at the coffee shop where Jimin&rsquo;s other half was waiting, they weren&rsquo;t even trying to pretend they haven\u2019t just woken up. To be perfectly honest, they didn&rsquo;t last five minutes before leaning into each other in their seats at the back of the lecture hall and falling asleep. They were art majors, what do they need history for?</p><p>The bell above the door chimed softly as they entered, a wonderful smell of fresh coffee and sweets engulfing them. While Taehyung stopped to look at the pastries that were on sale that day - they always made them fresh, and never the same thing two days in a row - Jimin made a beeline to their usual spot in the back corner. Taehyung smiled softly as he watched Jimin kiss the blond boy already sitting there, looking half-asleep but content like a cat with a full belly.</p><p>He turned back to the counter to finally choose something for himself - and for the lovebirds, unless he wanted to share his cake with them - and almost jumped in surprise.</p><p>&quot;Hyung! I didn&rsquo;t know you were working today!&rdquo; He exclaimed, smiling brightly at his friend behind the counter. </p><p>&ldquo;Our new worker called in sick this morning, I couldn&rsquo;t leave one person baking, making coffee and serving the customers, now could I?&rdquo; Seokjin absentmindedly straightened his neon pink apron, brushing some flour off his chest. Then he set three plates down on the counter and asked Taehyung what he&rsquo;d like.</p><p>&ldquo;Carrot cake for the grumpy cat, caramel latte and chocolate cake for Chim and I&rsquo;ll have&hellip;&rdquo; he trailed off, looking for his favourite but not seeing it anywhere. Seokjin smirked and moved to put the cakes on plates, leaning closer to Tae to stage-whisper to him.</p><p>&ldquo;Strawberry jam squares are out of the oven in two minutes. Sleeping beauty came in, ordered his black-but-disgustingly-sweet coffee, took one look at the cake display and asked me if I could make some for you, and I have to quote, &lsquo;the kid has been counting the days until your vacation ended.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>Taehyung&rsquo;s mouth drooled a little at the mention of freshly bakes strawberry pastries. He quickly thanked his friend, not forgetting to order a coconut latte for himself, took the plates for his friends and went to sit down on the couch opposite them. Jimin took his chocolate cake, thanking him with his mouth already full, while Yoongi mumbled that he &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t even like sweets but thanks anyway.&rdquo; Why he was even trying was beyond him, literally everyone and their mum knew he put sugar in pretty much everything and had a whole cupboard in his kitchen dedicated to sweets. </p><p>After a while, Jin&rsquo;s co-worker, Minhyuk, brought them their coffee and Taehyung&rsquo;s strawberry squares. There were three on his plate, as if Seokjin knew he would have asked for more anyway. Feeling touched by the gesture, he smiled and took a bite. He had to stifle a moan at how good the still-warm pastry was, the creamy filling complemented by soft but crunchy dough. Seokjin was truly a god in the kitchen (and according to Namjoon - as they have heard too many times, sadly - in the bedroom too). </p><p>It was quiet for a while as they refilled their sugar and caffeine, the couple occasionally kissing or feeding each other. Taehyung wasn&rsquo;t sure what was sweeter, them or the heavenly creation on his plate. The two were one of those perfect couples that either made people jealous or gave them diabetes, but Taehyung knew their story was much more complicated than it looked. They became friends after Hoseok accidentally added Jimin to their group chat, and they spent moths just texting and calling. When Jimin confessed he liked the older slightly more than a friend should, Yoongi panicked and locked himself in his studio. Jimin blackmailed Namjoon into letting him in, and well&hellip;the second Yoongi heard his voice and felt the burning on his arm, he realised he didn&rsquo;t have to be afraid, that his heart knew they belonged together even before they met. </p><p>Looking at them now, Taehyung knew he didn&rsquo;t have to worry about finding his soulmate. Whoever he was meant to be with, they would eventually find him. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey Tae,&rdquo; he was interrupted by Jimin&rsquo;s voice, &ldquo;are you going to that party this weekend?&rdquo;</p><p>Tyehyung shook his head. &ldquo;I have to finish this essay, I still have like 4,000 words to go and I don&rsquo;t want to have to do that hungover.&rdquo;</p><p>Jimin nodded in understanding, looking slightly disappointed that his best friend wouldn&rsquo;t be coming, but since his boyfriend would be there he didn&rsquo;t try to persuade him.</p><p>Taehyung was going to lose his mind sooner than previously thought.</p><p>it&rsquo;s his fault, really, having procrastinated until literally the last weekend before his deadline, and for forcing himself to finish it in one go (it increases the quality when written as one string of thoughts, or so he tried to tell himself) so here he was, at 11am on a Saturday, after 5 hours of sleep, ready to murder the first person who so much as looked too loudly at him.</p><p>He burrowed himself further into his hoodie, walking the familiar path to Seokjin&rsquo;s cafe. He really needed coffee and sugar, and after last night he damn well deserved it.</p><p>He opened the door, breathing in the familiar smell he&rsquo;s come to accustom to quiet evenings spent with friends. He smiles a little, the aroma of coffee and sugary goodness already easing the headache that has taken up residence behind his forehead ((or in his temples or sth help)). He waves at Seokjin sitting behind a table cuddled up to a tall guy with ashy hair, enjoying his break with his boyfriend. </p><p>Taehyung walked up to the counter, thankful to see there were no other customers waiting. Before he could even open his mouth, Minhyuk was ringing his order up on the register, hand out for him to drop his money in. He smiled empathetically at Taehyung and he noded gratefully, knowing the other student noticed what state he was in and was trying to save him any human interaction he could. He went to sit in his favourite seat as he waited for his order, opening his backack to see if he left the book he&rsquo;s been reading in it.</p><p>He sighed happily as his hand came into contact with the smooth cover, taking out the red book and opening it at the page where he thankfully put the bookmark. It took him just seconds to get back into the story, tuning out the world around him. Despite that, he did notice his drink and cake being set down on the table in front of him, and the stranger in an apron standing next to him. He set down his book and grabbed the coffee so quickly he almost spilled it, taking a sip and moaning silently at the taste.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you so much.&rdquo;</p><p>It took a second for his brain to register what he said, and he could feel his cheeks getting red as he tried to stutter out an explanation.</p><p>&ldquo;F-for the coffee I mean, I was dying and it&rsquo;s so fucking good it&rsquo;s exactly how I like it this is literally the best thing I&rsquo;ve had all week I&hellip;yeah.&rdquo; He tried to avoid looking at the barista by picking up his book again and shoving his face into it.</p><p>He did, however, hear what the boy said, perfectly clear. </p><p>&ldquo;'I love you, thorns and all.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>Taehyung looked up and gaped at the boy, his mouth hanging open a bit, as he feelt the warm tingling on his left wrist. Holy. Shit.</p><p>&ldquo;Um,&rdquo; the unknown barista looked down shyly, &ldquo;y-you know, it&rsquo;s a quote, I saw you reading A Court of Thorns and Roses and I thought it was so cool that someone was reading my favourite book, and I wanted to ask you about it, and that&rsquo;s my favourite quote and I um,&rdquo; he stopped himself, cheeks as red as his shirt and slightly out of breath. Taehyung was kind of having a heart attack.</p><p>&ldquo;What.&rdquo; Taehyung kind of wanted to slap himself for that. He blamed his sleep-deprived brain.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really sorry I-&rdquo; The other boy stopped mid-sentence as realisation dawned on him. He pulled up the left sleeve of his shirt and gasped, eyes big as saucers flicking up to meet Taehyung&rsquo;s. Taehyung was just glad he wasn&rsquo;t the only one looking seconds from death. He does have to admit the other looked very cute when he&rsquo;s flustered.</p><p>He looked down on his own wrist and felt warmth expand in his chest. He ran a finger over the messy letters, the cheesy love confession, while not meant for him, made his heart skip a beat. He looked up in time to see the boy wave at Minhyuk before sitting down in front of him.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on break, if you want to talk?&rdquo; The question came out shy and uncertain and Taehyung wanted to coo at him. When he saw the expression on his face, he realised his tired brain must have lost all filters because he apparently did just that.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, sorry, I&rsquo;m just really tired I stayed up until morning working on my paper and this is my first cup of coffee today and my brain isn&rsquo;t working right now.&rdquo; He put his book on the table between them and picked up his coffee instead. </p><p>&ldquo;It\u2019s okay, it\u2019s cute really. I&rsquo;m Jungkook, by the way.&rdquo; Jungkook smiled at him, his teeth making him look like a bunny.</p><p>&ldquo;Taehyung, photography major.&rdquo; He replied, taking another sip from his cup. Jungkook&rsquo;s eyes widened at that, his wide, toothy grin reminding Taehyung of a bunny.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, are you Jimin&rsquo;s friend? The Taehyung? The one who won that contest last year?&rdquo; Taehyung was really surprised by the boy&rsquo;s words, looking down at his hands. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, guess that&rsquo;s me&hellip;oh my god wait what did he tell you I&rsquo;ll kill him.&rdquo; Jungkook laughed at how flustered Taehyung looked, and the sight of him took Taehyung&rsquo;s breath away.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; Jungkook said after he calmed down a bit, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all good things.&rdquo; </p><p>Taehyung seriously doubted that, but decided his best friend&rsquo;s death could wait. He did have to right the opinion this literal angel had on him.</p>",

He set down his book and grabbed the coffee so quickly he almost spilled it, taking a sip and moaning silently at the taste.</p><p>\u201cI love you so much.\u201d</p><p>It took a second for his brain to register what he said, and he could feel his cheeks getting red as he tried to stutter out an explanation.</p><p>\u201cF-for the coffee I mean, I was dying and it\u2019s so fucking good it\u2019s exactly how I like it this is literally the best thing I\u2019ve had all week I\u2026yeah.\u201d He tried to avoid looking at the barista by picking up his book again and shoving his face into it.</p><p>He did, however, hear what the boy said, perfectly clear. </p><p>\u201c'I love you, thorns and all.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Taehyung looked up and gaped at the boy, his mouth hanging open a bit, as he feelt the warm tingling on his left wrist. Holy. Shit.</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d the unknown barista looked down shyly, \u201cy-you know, it\u2019s a quote, I saw you reading A Court of Thorns and Roses and I thought it was so cool that someone was reading my favourite book, and I wanted to ask you about it, and that\u2019s my favourite quote and I um,\u201d he stopped himself, cheeks as red as his shirt and slightly out of breath. Taehyung was kind of having a heart attack.</p><p>\u201cWhat.\u201d Taehyung kind of wanted to slap himself for that. He blamed his sleep-deprived brain.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry I-\u201d The other boy stopped mid-sentence as realisation dawned on him. He pulled up the left sleeve of his shirt and gasped, eyes big as saucers flicking up to meet Taehyung\u2019s. Taehyung was just glad he wasn\u2019t the only one looking seconds from death. He does have to admit the other looked very cute when he\u2019s flustered.</p><p>He looked down on his own wrist and felt warmth expand in his chest. He ran a finger over the messy letters, the cheesy love confession, while not meant for him, made his heart skip a beat. He looked up in time to see the boy wave at Minhyuk before sitting down in front of him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on break, if you want to talk?\u201d The question came out shy and uncertain and Taehyung wanted to coo at him. When he saw the expression on his face, he realised his tired brain must have lost all filters because he apparently did just that.</p><p>\u201cSorry, sorry, I\u2019m just really tired I stayed up until morning working on my paper and this is my first cup of coffee today and my brain isn\u2019t working right now.\u201d He put his book on the table between them and picked up his coffee instead. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s cute really. I\u2019m Jungkook, by the way.\u201d Jungkook smiled at him, his teeth making him look like a bunny.</p><p>\u201cTaehyung, photography major.\u201d He replied, taking another sip from his cup. Jungkook\u2019s eyes widened at that, his wide, toothy grin reminding Taehyung of a bunny.</p><p>\u201cWait, are you Jimin\u2019s friend? The Taehyung? The one who won that contest last year?\u201d Taehyung was really surprised by the boy\u2019s words, looking down at his hands. </p><p>\u201cYeah, guess that\u2019s me\u2026oh my god wait what did he tell you I\u2019ll kill him.\u201d Jungkook laughed at how flustered Taehyung looked, and the sight of him took Taehyung\u2019s breath away.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Jungkook said after he calmed down a bit, \u201cit\u2019s all good things.\u201d </p><p>Taehyung seriously doubted that, but decided his best friend\u2019s death could wait. He did have to right the opinion this literal angel had on him.</p>",

He could find the tiniest positive thing in any moment, every word. And he made sure everyone around him always had a smile on their faces. He just radiated energy and naturally, all his friends loved him for it.</p><p>The days when his cloud of happiness left him were few and far between. A grumpy mood after an all-nighter or a new hair colour not turning out how he wanted it to were nothing to cry about.</p><p>Today, thought, Taehyung wasn\u2019t in the best mood. He was tired, and grumpy, and did he mention tired? It was one of those rare days when his sunny personality needed to recharge, and it seemed like fate, or God, or whoever is in charge of those things, was trying their best to help him.</p><p>Nobody could keep the frown on their face if their soulmate was the sweetest person in the world.</p><p>\u201cJimin-hyung, wait for me!\u201d Taehyung yelled after his best friend, jogging to catch up to the pink-haired boy. He swung his backpack over his shoulder as he slowed down next to him, the other not bothering to glance up from his phone.</p><p>Taehyung leaned in to sneak a glance at Jimin\u2019s phone screen.</p><p>\u201cIs Yoongi-hyung joining us for coffee later?\u201d he asked with a smile, already thinking of the coconut latt\u00e9 he\u2019s become addicted to in the past few months.</p><p>Jimin typed out a reply and put away his phone, finally meeting the other\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cYes he is, his lecture ends early today so he\u2019ll wait for us there.\u201d</p><p>Taehyung nodded once, skipping ahead in the direction of the lecture hall the two were headed to. He stopped a few feet away, waiting for his (\u201cI\u2019m not short, I\u2019m travel sized!\u201d) tiny friend. Making exaggerated serious faces, both of them saluted each other, mentally preparing themselves for the two-hours-long battle against sleep in the most boring and useless class of the week.</p><p>History.</p><p>When they arrived at the coffee shop where Jimin\u2019s other half was waiting, they weren\u2019t even trying to pretend they haven\u2019t just woken up. To be perfectly honest, they didn\u2019t last five minutes before leaning into each other in their seats at the back of the lecture hall and falling asleep. They were art majors, what do they need history for?</p><p>The bell above the door chimed softly as they entered, a wonderful smell of fresh coffee and sweets engulfing them. While Taehyung stopped to look at the pastries that were on sale that day - they always made them fresh, and never the same thing two days in a row - Jimin made a beeline to their usual spot in the back corner. Taehyung smiled softly as he watched Jimin kiss the blond boy already sitting there, looking half-asleep but content like a cat with a full belly.</p><p>He turned back to the counter to finally choose something for himself - and for the lovebirds, unless he wanted to share his cake with them - and almost jumped in surprise.</p><p>\"Hyung! I didn\u2019t know you were working today!\u201d He exclaimed, smiling brightly at his friend behind the counter. </p><p>\u201cOur new worker called in sick this morning, I couldn\u2019t leave one person baking, making coffee and serving the customers, now could I?\u201d Seokjin absentmindedly straightened his neon pink apron, brushing some flour off his chest. Then he set three plates down on the counter and asked Taehyung what he\u2019d like.</p><p>\u201cCarrot cake for the grumpy cat, caramel latte and chocolate cake for Chim and I\u2019ll have\u2026\u201d he trailed off, looking for his favourite but not seeing it anywhere. Seokjin smirked and moved to put the cakes on plates, leaning closer to Tae to stage-whisper to him.</p><p>\u201cStrawberry jam squares are out of the oven in two minutes. Sleeping beauty came in, ordered his black-but-disgustingly-sweet coffee, took one look at the cake display and asked me if I could make some for you, and I have to quote, \u2018the kid has been counting the days until your vacation ended.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Taehyung\u2019s mouth drooled a little at the mention of freshly bakes strawberry pastries. He quickly thanked his friend, not forgetting to order a coconut latte for himself, took the plates for his friends and went to sit down on the couch opposite them. Jimin took his chocolate cake, thanking him with his mouth already full, while Yoongi mumbled that he \u201cdidn\u2019t even like sweets but thanks anyway.\u201d Why he was even trying was beyond him, literally everyone and their mum knew he put sugar in pretty much everything and had a whole cupboard in his kitchen dedicated to sweets. </p><p>After a while, Jin\u2019s co-worker, Minhyuk, brought them their coffee and Taehyung\u2019s strawberry squares. There were three on his plate, as if Seokjin knew he would have asked for more anyway. Feeling touched by the gesture, he smiled and took a bite. He had to stifle a moan at how good the still-warm pastry was, the creamy filling complemented by soft but crunchy dough. Seokjin was truly a god in the kitchen (and according to Namjoon - as they have heard too many times, sadly - in the bedroom too). </p><p>It was quiet for a while as they refilled their sugar and caffeine, the couple occasionally kissing or feeding each other. Taehyung wasn\u2019t sure what was sweeter, them or the heavenly creation on his plate. The two were one of those perfect couples that either made people jealous or gave them diabetes, but Taehyung knew their story was much more complicated than it looked. They became friends after Hoseok accidentally added Jimin to their group chat, and they spent moths just texting and calling. When Jimin confessed he liked the older slightly more than a friend should, Yoongi panicked and locked himself in his studio. Jimin blackmailed Namjoon into letting him in, and well\u2026the second Yoongi heard his voice and felt the burning on his arm, he realised he didn\u2019t have to be afraid, that his heart knew they belonged together even before they met. </p><p>Looking at them now, Taehyung knew he didn\u2019t have to worry about finding his soulmate. Whoever he was meant to be with, they would eventually find him. </p><p>\u201cHey Tae,\u201d he was interrupted by Jimin\u2019s voice, \u201care you going to that party this weekend?\u201d</p><p>Tyehyung shook his head. \u201cI have to finish this essay, I still have like 4,000 words to go and I don\u2019t want to have to do that hungover.\u201d</p><p>Jimin nodded in understanding, looking slightly disappointed that his best friend wouldn\u2019t be coming, but since his boyfriend would be there he didn\u2019t try to persuade him.</p><p>Taehyung was going to lose his mind sooner than previously thought.</p><p>it\u2019s his fault, really, having procrastinated until literally the last weekend before his deadline, and for forcing himself to finish it in one go (it increases the quality when written as one string of thoughts, or so he tried to tell himself) so here he was, at 11am on a Saturday, after 5 hours of sleep, ready to murder the first person who so much as looked too loudly at him.</p><p>He burrowed himself further into his hoodie, walking the familiar path to Seokjin\u2019s cafe. He really needed coffee and sugar, and after last night he damn well deserved it.</p><p>He opened the door, breathing in the familiar smell he\u2019s come to accustom to quiet evenings spent with friends. He smiles a little, the aroma of coffee and sugary goodness already easing the headache that has taken up residence behind his forehead ((or in his temples or sth help)). He waves at Seokjin sitting behind a table cuddled up to a tall guy with ashy hair, enjoying his break with his boyfriend. </p><p>Taehyung walked up to the counter, thankful to see there were no other customers waiting. Before he could even open his mouth, Minhyuk was ringing his order up on the register, hand out for him to drop his money in. He smiled empathetically at Taehyung and he noded gratefully, knowing the other student noticed what state he was in and was trying to save him any human interaction he could. He went to sit in his favourite seat as he waited for his order, opening his backack to see if he left the book he\u2019s been reading in it.</p><p>He sighed happily as his hand came into contact with the smooth cover, taking out the red book and opening it at the page where he thankfully put the bookmark. It took him just seconds to get back into the story, tuning out the world around him. Despite that, he did notice his drink and cake being set down on the table in front of him, and the stranger in an apron standing next to him. He set down his book and grabbed the coffee so quickly he almost spilled it, taking a sip and moaning silently at the taste.</p><p>\u201cI love you so much.\u201d</p><p>It took a second for his brain to register what he said, and he could feel his cheeks getting red as he tried to stutter out an explanation.</p><p>\u201cF-for the coffee I mean, I was dying and it\u2019s so fucking good it\u2019s exactly how I like it this is literally the best thing I\u2019ve had all week I\u2026yeah.\u201d He tried to avoid looking at the barista by picking up his book again and shoving his face into it.</p><p>He did, however, hear what the boy said, perfectly clear. </p><p>\u201c'I love you, thorns and all.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Taehyung looked up and gaped at the boy, his mouth hanging open a bit, as he feelt the warm tingling on his left wrist.

He waves at Seokjin sitting behind a table cuddled up to a tall guy with ashy hair, enjoying his break with his boyfriend. </p><p>Taehyung walked up to the counter, thankful to see there were no other customers waiting. Before he could even open his mouth, Minhyuk was ringing his order up on the register, hand out for him to drop his money in. He smiled empathetically at Taehyung and he noded gratefully, knowing the other student noticed what state he was in and was trying to save him any human interaction he could. He went to sit in his favourite seat as he waited for his order, opening his backack to see if he left the book he&rsquo;s been reading in it.</p><p>He sighed happily as his hand came into contact with the smooth cover, taking out the red book and opening it at the page where he thankfully put the bookmark. It took him just seconds to get back into the story, tuning out the world around him. Despite that, he did notice his drink and cake being set down on the table in front of him, and the stranger in an apron standing next to him. He set down his book and grabbed the coffee so quickly he almost spilled it, taking a sip and moaning silently at the taste.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you so much.&rdquo;</p><p>It took a second for his brain to register what he said, and he could feel his cheeks getting red as he tried to stutter out an explanation.</p><p>&ldquo;F-for the coffee I mean, I was dying and it&rsquo;s so fucking good it&rsquo;s exactly how I like it this is literally the best thing I&rsquo;ve had all week I&hellip;yeah.&rdquo; He tried to avoid looking at the barista by picking up his book again and shoving his face into it.</p><p>He did, however, hear what the boy said, perfectly clear. </p><p>&ldquo;'I love you, thorns and all.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>Taehyung looked up and gaped at the boy, his mouth hanging open a bit, as he feelt the warm tingling on his left wrist. Holy. Shit.</p><p>&ldquo;Um,&rdquo; the unknown barista looked down shyly, &ldquo;y-you know, it&rsquo;s a quote, I saw you reading A Court of Thorns and Roses and I thought it was so cool that someone was reading my favourite book, and I wanted to ask you about it, and that&rsquo;s my favourite quote and I um,&rdquo; he stopped himself, cheeks as red as his shirt and slightly out of breath. Taehyung was kind of having a heart attack.</p><p>&ldquo;What.&rdquo; Taehyung kind of wanted to slap himself for that. He blamed his sleep-deprived brain.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really sorry I-&rdquo; The other boy stopped mid-sentence as realisation dawned on him. He pulled up the left sleeve of his shirt and gasped, eyes big as saucers flicking up to meet Taehyung&rsquo;s. Taehyung was just glad he wasn&rsquo;t the only one looking seconds from death. He does have to admit the other looked very cute when he&rsquo;s flustered.</p><p>He looked down on his own wrist and felt warmth expand in his chest. He ran a finger over the messy letters, the cheesy love confession, while not meant for him, made his heart skip a beat. He looked up in time to see the boy wave at Minhyuk before sitting down in front of him.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on break, if you want to talk?&rdquo; The question came out shy and uncertain and Taehyung wanted to coo at him. When he saw the expression on his face, he realised his tired brain must have lost all filters because he apparently did just that.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, sorry, I&rsquo;m just really tired I stayed up until morning working on my paper and this is my first cup of coffee today and my brain isn&rsquo;t working right now.&rdquo; He put his book on the table between them and picked up his coffee instead. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, it&rsquo;s cute really. I&rsquo;m Jungkook, by the way.&rdquo; Jungkook smiled at him, his teeth making him look like a bunny.</p><p>&ldquo;Taehyung, photography major.&rdquo; He replied, taking another sip from his cup. Jungkook&rsquo;s eyes widened at that, his wide, toothy grin reminding Taehyung of a bunny.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, are you Jimin&rsquo;s friend? The Taehyung? The one who won that contest last year?&rdquo; Taehyung was really surprised by the boy&rsquo;s words, looking down at his hands. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, guess that&rsquo;s me&hellip;oh my god wait what did he tell you I&rsquo;ll kill him.&rdquo; Jungkook laughed at how flustered Taehyung looked, and the sight of him took Taehyung&rsquo;s breath away.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; Jungkook said after he calmed down a bit, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all good things.&rdquo; </p><p>Taehyung seriously doubted that, but decided his best friend&rsquo;s death could wait. He did have to right the opinion this literal angel had on him.</p>",

Yoongi had always loved kissing your freckles.

Well, things would have been easier if your boyfriend stayed with you all the time but you understand.</p><p>It was easily one of your worst days ever. You recently moved in with your boyfriend in his apartment in Seoul and were still looking for a job apt for your calibre but since so far you found none, you were still looking for job openings. The past week was not half as lifeless as today, in particular, is. As your boyfriend was not at home, unlike the past week when you two would end up watching dramas or would go out on dates. Even when you did nothing when at home, you still felt satisfaction linger in the air with merely his presence. Today that he had to go to work, you felt painfully lonely. Lazing around in your room, you end up texting your boyfriend.</p><p><b>You:</b> Taetae</p><p><b>5:33 pm</b></p><p><b>You: </b>TAETAE!</p><p><b>5:33 pm</b></p><p>When you see no response in the next 5 minutes, you decide to dial his number and give him an earful when your phone vibrates.</p><p><b>Taetae:</b> OMG WHAT\u2019S WRONG? ALL CAPS?</p><p><b>5:38 pm</b></p><p><b>You: </b>You took too long to respond. I was about to put up posters \u201cMy boyfriend is missing\u201d in a few minutes.</p><p><b>5:39 pm</b></p><p><b>Taetae:</b> But it took me only 5 minutes! :( Y/N! What\u2019s wrong? </p><p><b>5:40pm</b></p><p><b>Taetae:</b> You sound different.</p><p><b>5:40pm</b></p><p><b>You:</b> I&rsquo;m bored. </p><p><b>5:41 pm</b></p><p><b>You: </b>There is no job that suits me well.</p><p><b>5:41 pm </b></p><p><b>You: </b>And there is nothing much to do at home too.</p><p><b>5:42 pm</b></p><p><b>Taetae:</b> Oh. :(</p><p><b>5:42 pm </b></p><p><b>Taetae:</b> I can&rsquo;t leave yet. :( </p><p><b>5:42 pm</b></p><p><b>Taetae:</b> I&rsquo;m stuck with some important work babe. </p><p><b>5:43 pm</b></p><p><b>Taetae:</b> I\u2019ll try and come as soon as I can okay?</p><p><b>5:43 pm</b></p><p><b>You:</b> I miss you :(</p><p><b>5:44pm</b></p><p>You put your phone aside. With your favourite playlist on, you start looking for articles online for job openings on your laptop. You mark three offers which seem to meet your standards. before you know it\u2019s already 7 in the evening. You crawl out of your cosy couch to cook some dinner for your dearest boyfriend and yourself. Though you still were desperate to be blessed by his presence as soon as possible, keeping yourself busy helped distract you from the emptiness of the huge apartment that you shared with him. You decide to make him some jjajangmyeon, it was a dish you were most confident about. You tie your hair into a bun and ready the ingredients. You check your phone one more time to check if Taehyung had left yet. Only to your dismay, as you find out that he is going to be late. Despite the fact that you are not to be mistaken to be as a person who is obsessive when in a relationship, granted, you were passionate but never obsessive, this behaviour was out of your character and was alien to you, it was new to Taehyung too but you hoped he understood you considering you were free right now, you unconsciously kept seeking him for comfort. </p><p>Its something you have loved about Taehyung, he has always been a loving boyfriend. And despite your long distance relationship he always understood your sentiments very well.</p><p>Your love story was pretty cliche, but the kind of cliche that everyone loved. You met Taehyung online, well, accidentally. You were stalking your crush, Min Yoongi, a Daegu heartthrob. You were going through his Instagram when you noticed his picture with his close friends. You went to the tagged accounts searching for more pictures of the man you crushed oh, so hard on. And so you stumbled upon two accounts which revolved only around Yoongi and his friends, an account called Taeguboi and Jimichim. While you were scrolling through Taeguboi&rsquo;s 1657 posts, you may or may not have liked a 65 weeks old picture. Yes, it spelt disaster. Taehyung didn&rsquo;t waste any second to catch your act of stalking. </p><p><i>*Someone slid into your DMs*</i></p><p><b>Taeguboi:</b> You were stalking me!</p><p><b>Taeguboi:</b> I always wanted a stalker friend!!</p><p><b>Taeguboi: </b>Do you want to be friends with me??</p><p><b>You: </b>Excuse me!? I wasn&rsquo;t stalking you. My little sister was playing with my phone and hence accidentally liked your picture. </p><p><b>Taeguboi:</b> Aha, you&rsquo;re not a bright liar.</p><p><b>Taeguboi:</b> Do you like me? Or do you like Yoongi hyung? </p><p><b>You: </b>No I don&rsquo;t like you!</p><p><b>Taeguboi:</b> :( that&rsquo;s very mean. </p><p><b>Taeguboi: </b>Wait so you like Yoongi hyung? Oh </p><p><b>Taeguboi:</b> YOU ACTUALLY DO FOLLOW HIM WAIT, YOU DONT FOLLOW ME SO YOU ACTUALLY DO LOVE HYUNG OMG.</p><p><b>You:</b> Oh wow, we don&rsquo;t even know each other and you already know. </p><p><b>Taeguboi: </b>Aw, don&rsquo;t worry I won&rsquo;t tell him.</p><p><b>Taeguboi:</b> my name is Taehyung. I&rsquo;m Yoongi&rsquo;s friend. I can help you set up with him! It&rsquo;ll be fun!</p><p>I&rsquo;ll set you up he said, it&rsquo;ll be fun, he said but what you two didn&rsquo;t know was how the events would turn and you two would be the ones falling in love instead. Albeit you two were hesitant to make a move, one of you had to. Spoiler, he did.</p><p>&lsquo;Oh great, now it&rsquo;s thundering! This day couldn&rsquo;t get any worse, could it?&rsquo;</p><p>You have grown up hating thunderstorm. Well, no one likes it, but you had grown phobic when it came to a thunderstorm. This just makes you miss Taehyung all the more. You serve some jjajangmyeon for yourself and shut all the windows and doors before sitting in your room. You turn on the TV and watch whatever comes on. You were dozing off to your dreamland when you were brought to consciousness by shuffling at the entrance of your abode. You move to the source to find a cute Taehyung, trying his hardest not to make noise whilst he sneaks into the apartment. Its only 9 pm and you thought he was gonna be home later at night.</p><p>&ldquo;Tae?\u201d you startled the boy with his name. </p><p>\u201cOh no, I was hoping to scare you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were gonna be late?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was but I missed you so much that I finished my work as fast as I could and came home running.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m glad you did. I already had my supper. I made jjajangmyeon. Go get fresh I\u2019ll heat it up for you.\u201d</p><p>While you were busy serving the food again, you fail to take note of Tae and his eyes that bore into the food. He wore a simple grey tee and his black sweatpants, looking as attractive as always. </p><p>\u201cSo how was your day at work?\u201d you inquire.</p><p>\u201cIt was so stressful today! I can&rsquo;t even get started on it. My boss seriously is so annoying at times. I made the presentation about the stats of the company in the past month and- why are you looking at me like that?\u201d He stops with a cheeky grin on his face.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, go on, what did he do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so he- oh my gosh you&rsquo;re looking at me so cutely, why are you looking at me like this!\u201d an evident blush forms on his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cWhat!? I&rsquo;m not doing anything. Although I must say, I really missed you the whole day, since I had nothing to do and you were missing everything seemed so dull and gloomy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAww, come here\u201d he held you in your arms, dotingly. One thing that you\u2019ve learned about taehyung is that he loves to cuddle. You wriggle closer to him. </p><p>&quot;I couldn\u2019t help but think about you the whole day at work. I&rsquo;m sorry, everything\u2019s new for you and I can\u2019t even stay home to keep you company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon&rsquo;t apologize! I understand. I&rsquo;m sorry for acting irrationally in the evening.\u201d</p><p>He pulls you closer and whispers, &quot;I know there&rsquo;s a lot on your shoulders, we&rsquo;ll get through this, don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;</p><p>Before you realise a warm feeling fills your heart, there&rsquo;s a lot you need to figure out though in his arms like this, the inconvenience seems insignificant. And so you close your eyes and drift to your dreamland with your boyfriend, leaving this stormy night behind. </p>",

You recently moved in with your boyfriend in his apartment in Seoul and were still looking for a job apt for your calibre but since so far you found none, you were still looking for job openings. The past week was not half as lifeless as today, in particular, is. As your boyfriend was not at home, unlike the past week when you two would end up watching dramas or would go out on dates. Even when you did nothing when at home, you still felt satisfaction linger in the air with merely his presence. Today that he had to go to work, you felt painfully lonely.

With your favourite playlist on, you start looking for articles online for job openings on your laptop. You mark three offers which seem to meet your standards. before you know it\u2019s already 7 in the evening. You crawl out of your cosy couch to cook some dinner for your dearest boyfriend and yourself. Though you still were desperate to be blessed by his presence as soon as possible, keeping yourself busy helped distract you from the emptiness of the huge apartment that you shared with him. You decide to make him some jjajangmyeon, it was a dish you were most confident about. You tie your hair into a bun and ready the ingredients. You check your phone one more time to check if Taehyung had left yet. Only to your dismay, as you find out that he is going to be late. Despite the fact that you are not to be mistaken to be as a person who is obsessive when in a relationship, granted, you were passionate but never obsessive, this behaviour was out of your character and was alien to you, it was new to Taehyung too but you hoped he understood you considering you were free right now, you unconsciously kept seeking him for comfort. </p><p>Its something you have loved about Taehyung, he has always been a loving boyfriend. And despite your long distance relationship he always understood your sentiments very well.</p><p>Your love story was pretty cliche, but the kind of cliche that everyone loved. You met Taehyung online, well, accidentally. You were stalking your crush, Min Yoongi, a Daegu heartthrob. You were going through his Instagram when you noticed his picture with his close friends. You went to the tagged accounts searching for more pictures of the man you crushed oh, so hard on. And so you stumbled upon two accounts which revolved only around Yoongi and his friends, an account called Taeguboi and Jimichim. While you were scrolling through Taeguboi\u2019s 1657 posts, you may or may not have liked a 65 weeks old picture. Yes, it spelt disaster. Taehyung didn\u2019t waste any second to catch your act of stalking. </p><p><i>*Someone slid into your DMs*</i></p><p><b>Taeguboi:</b> You were stalking me!</p><p><b>Taeguboi:</b> I always wanted a stalker friend!!</p><p><b>Taeguboi: </b>Do you want to be friends with me??</p><p><b>You: </b>Excuse me!? I wasn\u2019t stalking you. My little sister was playing with my phone and hence accidentally liked your picture. </p><p><b>Taeguboi:</b> Aha, you\u2019re not a bright liar.</p><p><b>Taeguboi:</b> Do you like me? Or do you like Yoongi hyung? </p><p><b>You: </b>No I don\u2019t like you!</p><p><b>Taeguboi:</b> :( that\u2019s very mean. </p><p><b>Taeguboi: </b>Wait so you like Yoongi hyung? Oh </p><p><b>Taeguboi:</b> YOU ACTUALLY DO FOLLOW HIM WAIT, YOU DONT FOLLOW ME SO YOU ACTUALLY DO LOVE HYUNG OMG.</p><p><b>You:</b> Oh wow, we don\u2019t even know each other and you already know. </p><p><b>Taeguboi: </b>Aw, don\u2019t worry I won\u2019t tell him.</p><p><b>Taeguboi:</b> my name is Taehyung. I\u2019m Yoongi\u2019s friend. I can help you set up with him! It\u2019ll be fun!</p><p>I\u2019ll set you up he said, it\u2019ll be fun, he said but what you two didn\u2019t know was how the events would turn and you two would be the ones falling in love instead. Albeit you two were hesitant to make a move, one of you had to. Spoiler, he did.</p><p>\u2018Oh great, now it\u2019s thundering! This day couldn\u2019t get any worse, could it?\u2019</p><p>You have grown up hating thunderstorm. Well, no one likes it, but you had grown phobic when it came to a thunderstorm. This just makes you miss Taehyung all the more. You serve some jjajangmyeon for yourself and shut all the windows and doors before sitting in your room. You turn on the TV and watch whatever comes on. You were dozing off to your dreamland when you were brought to consciousness by shuffling at the entrance of your abode. You move to the source to find a cute Taehyung, trying his hardest not to make noise whilst he sneaks into the apartment. Its only 9 pm and you thought he was gonna be home later at night.</p><p>\u201cTae?\u201d you startled the boy with his name. </p><p>\u201cOh no, I was hoping to scare you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were gonna be late?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was but I missed you so much that I finished my work as fast as I could and came home running.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you did. I already had my supper. I made jjajangmyeon. Go get fresh I\u2019ll heat it up for you.\u201d</p><p>While you were busy serving the food again, you fail to take note of Tae and his eyes that bore into the food. He wore a simple grey tee and his black sweatpants, looking as attractive as always. </p><p>\u201cSo how was your day at work?\u201d you inquire.</p><p>\u201cIt was so stressful today! I can\u2019t even get started on it. My boss seriously is so annoying at times. I made the presentation about the stats of the company in the past month and- why are you looking at me like that?\u201d He stops with a cheeky grin on his face.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, go on, what did he do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so he- oh my gosh you\u2019re looking at me so cutely, why are you looking at me like this!\u201d an evident blush forms on his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cWhat!? I\u2019m not doing anything. Although I must say, I really missed you the whole day, since I had nothing to do and you were missing everything seemed so dull and gloomy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAww, come here\u201d he held you in your arms, dotingly. One thing that you\u2019ve learned about taehyung is that he loves to cuddle. You wriggle closer to him. </p><p>\"I couldn\u2019t help but think about you the whole day at work. I\u2019m sorry, everything\u2019s new for you and I can\u2019t even stay home to keep you company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize! I understand. I\u2019m sorry for acting irrationally in the evening.\u201d</p><p>He pulls you closer and whispers, \"I know there\u2019s a lot on your shoulders, we\u2019ll get through this, don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>Before you realise a warm feeling fills your heart, there\u2019s a lot you need to figure out though in his arms like this, the inconvenience seems insignificant. And so you close your eyes and drift to your dreamland with your boyfriend, leaving this stormy night behind. </p></p>",

In just a matter of three years, a lot had happened as they struggled to stabilize a relationship between them. Whenever things looked like they were okay, <i>shit happened </i>and of course, there was this giant obstacle of <i>him</i> being close to everything related to emotions and what they brought to him. <i>Mostly her. </i>He started thinking about her like he did every morning before he left the bed. Her light brown hair, brown eyes that always reflected some kind of emotions, usually there was soft coldness which <i>he loved. </i>The images of her body flooded to his mind, the way how her body tensed up during a fight and when he was around, <i>how it relaxed when he touched her.</i> </p><p>He smiled with the picture he had in his mind as he was lying down in the dark room.</p><p>The picture of <i>her.</i> </p><p>He turned around with a loud grunt and grabbed his phone. 8.30 AM.</p><p>He had barely any sleep and he scrunched up his nose with the annoyance, mainly because <i>she</i> did not text him <i>\u2018Gm.\u2019 </i>that morning.<i> </i>It seemed simple, but it was their way of saying, <i>\u2018I just woke up and it\u2019s so early.\u2019 </i>It was Wednesday so she was probably already down at the gym, training hand to hand combat. He stood up with another grunt and changed to his regular clothes, a high collared almost tight black shirt with long sleeves and not-so-tight-but-tight pants to match the darkness of his looks.</p><p>Soon, Four walked his way to the training room to find no one there which was awkward because she <i>should</i> be there so he opened the panel over his right sleeve to see where she was from the GPS. By then, he was pouting with almost anger.</p><p><i>She did not appear to be in the PHASe facilities. </i></p><p><i>\u2018What the fuck?\u2019 </i></p><p>He rushed to their briefing room in a haze, suspecting something was up. He should have known something had happened the moment he did not get his morning text. <i>How could he be so blind? </i></p><p>He stopped at the door upon hearing the voices of the members. Four walked inside.</p><p>The moment he walked in, every single voice stopped talking. With five pairs of eyes on him, he rolled his eyes and made his way to them. There was almost a dead silence inside, it was almost nightmarish. Four\u2019s almost black eyes ran over each and every single one of them.</p><p><i>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d </i></p><p>With the low, threatening voice of his members tensed up. All except Nine. So Four stepped closer to him and with each step, others could have sworn that the room was colder and the silence grew to be disturbing, almost uneasy. Nine seemed not sure if he should talk or not and the moment his mouth opened up and closed with no words coming out, Four pushed him to the wall. Hard.</p><p>\u201cTALK, NINE!\u201d</p><p>Holding his arm, Nine kept his calmness and stepped closer once again. Instead of answering, he simply pressed a few invisible keys to open a few camera footages while Six gave Four a handkerchief, signaling for him to open. When he did, he saw <i>her</i> GPS implant.</p><p>\u201cWe spotted a few images all around Olympia and it looks like the Magician took her. They removed her implant so we could not track her.\u201d Nine started and Four once again moved to attack him but failed, crashing into a body. Six. The only person he could not be affected by his coldness.</p><p>He grunted.</p><p>\u201c<i>However,</i>\u201d Six held him tight. \u201cWe know her location from the comm and what we need right now is you to be calm until we get to her. Can you do that?\u201d</p><p>Another grunt came, this one was quite hostile.</p><p><i>\u201cCan you, Yoongi?\u201d </i></p><p>He nodded, acting abrasive.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Her eyes shuttered open to a dark room with dim lights. The air was stuffy and almost heavy. After having difficulty breathing for a few moments, she started taking short breaths which seemed to be working for her. She did not try to move, she could already feel the metal restraints around her wrists as well as the metal table she was on. But that wasn\u2019t the worst. <i>She was fucking cold. </i>Wherever she was, it was certainly unwelcoming and almost frosty. The more her mind became clear, the more she realized how badly her outfit was torn, her hood was off and her usual waist scarf was thrown aside. She wanted to groan and grunt as loud as she could but could not risk someone coming in but that did not seem to be working when the usual silhouette with red fox mask entered the room.</p><p>Then, Seven started laughing, catching her kidnapper unguarded.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d The voice asked her.</p><p>Seven just kept laughing, resulting with the Magician tilting her head to the side with annoyance. She slowly took her black jacket off and walked closer to her with the knife with a red handle. A knife Seven did not realize.</p><p>She realized it when Magician pressed it down on her throat.</p><p><i>\u201cI said what is it.\u201d</i></p><p>Seven locked her eyes with hers that looked like a fox\u2019s eyes. Contact lenses.</p><p>\u201cIt is <i>so</i> hilarious that you are so competitive that you want to take me out to get a lead on Four.\u201d</p><p>She could have sworn that she spotted a smile behind the mask and when she was about to talk, Magician pressed the knife over her lips.</p><p><i>\u201cSsh, now.\u201d </i></p><p>She started running the knife around and over the torn spots over her body. She still had her head tilted to the side, apparently very focused on Seven\u2019s body. The knife traveled all around, her arms, abdomen, and legs until it stopped on her abdomen.</p><p>\u201cYou have made pretty valid points, dear Seven. But not enough. I do not plan on hurting Four, you see..\u201d She pressed the blade in, causing Seven to groan loudly and watching the blood run down in a thin line. \u201c<i>I plan on destroying him.\u201d </i></p><p>\u201cYou will never suc\u2014\u201c Seven\u2019s words were cut by another cut on her arm, this time deeper. She held herself back not to scream.</p><p><i>\u201cWhat did I say?\u201d </i>Upon Seven not giving her an answer, the blade was pushed deeper. <i>\u201cANSWER!\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cD-don\u2019t.. Talk..\u201d She gritted her teeth.</p><p><i>\u201cExactly.\u201d </i></p><p>Magician pulled the blade up, resulting with Seven panting deeply. She was a total psycho and Seven knew that the only way she was ever going to survive this was to go to her happy place. <i>Which was Yoongi. </i>She pictured his laugh, his endless cuddles, and pouts. His little pouts always made her day along with the small things he did sometimes, like little fish buns stolen from the cafeteria that was presented to her by him as breakfast. It made her happy.</p><p>That is why it hurt even more when Magician\u2019s blade dug deep in her right thigh.</p><p>She screamed.</p><p>Didn\u2019t open her eyes.</p><p>Another stroke came, again on her abdomen.</p><p>She remembered <i>Yoongi</i>. The days they spent an entire day in bed, days they trained together and he lost on purpose so that she would fall on top of him, days she\u2014</p><p>Her thoughts were cut off with the blade digging in deeper and her loud scream.</p><p><i>\u201cF-Four..\u201d </i></p><p>Her eyes were teary, she missed him. She missed him more than anything in that moment, so much that it hurt. Maybe hurt too much. Or was it the blade? All she knew was that she was burning all over. She felt the warm liquid leaving her body, making her dizzy. <i>Where was he?</i></p><p>What she did not know at that moment was that Six, Nine and Four was right behind the large metal door that kept Magician and herself locked in.</p><p>She screamed one last time before a loud crash that caused Seven to open her eyes, this time with agony. Her vision was a blur but she still could differentiate the silhouettes, at least she could Magicians.</p><p><i>\u201cFour..\u201d </i>She tried again, hoping he was there.</p><p>She did not hear an answer.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>She was alone.</p><p>She shuttered her eyes close tightly once more with the feeling of isolation and loneliness.</p><p>Four barely made his way to her and immediately, he opened the locks of the restrains.</p><p><i>\u201cY/N..\u201d </i></p><p>She was hurt and it broke his heart, he felt the sorrow and dread she experienced. With her finally in his arms, he felt exhausted but Four lifted her body, pressing it tightly against his.</p><p><i>\u201cI got you..

The more her mind became clear, the more she realized how badly her outfit was torn, her hood was off and her usual waist scarf was thrown aside. She wanted to groan and grunt as loud as she could but could not risk someone coming in but that did not seem to be working when the usual silhouette with red fox mask entered the room.</p><p>Then, Seven started laughing, catching her kidnapper unguarded.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d The voice asked her.</p><p>Seven just kept laughing, resulting with the Magician tilting her head to the side with annoyance. She slowly took her black jacket off and walked closer to her with the knife with a red handle. A knife Seven did not realize.</p><p>She realized it when Magician pressed it down on her throat.</p><p><i>\u201cI said what is it.\u201d</i></p><p>Seven locked her eyes with hers that looked like a fox\u2019s eyes. Contact lenses.</p><p>\u201cIt is <i>so</i> hilarious that you are so competitive that you want to take me out to get a lead on Four.\u201d</p><p>She could have sworn that she spotted a smile behind the mask and when she was about to talk, Magician pressed the knife over her lips.</p><p><i>\u201cSsh, now.\u201d </i></p><p>She started running the knife around and over the torn spots over her body. She still had her head tilted to the side, apparently very focused on Seven\u2019s body. The knife traveled all around, her arms, abdomen, and legs until it stopped on her abdomen.</p><p>\u201cYou have made pretty valid points, dear Seven. But not enough. I do not plan on hurting Four, you see..\u201d She pressed the blade in, causing Seven to groan loudly and watching the blood run down in a thin line. \u201c<i>I plan on destroying him.\u201d </i></p><p>\u201cYou will never suc\u2014\u201c Seven\u2019s words were cut by another cut on her arm, this time deeper. She held herself back not to scream.</p><p><i>\u201cWhat did I say?\u201d </i>Upon Seven not giving her an answer, the blade was pushed deeper. <i>\u201cANSWER!\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cD-don\u2019t..

She was a total psycho and Seven knew that the only way she was ever going to survive this was to go to her happy place. <i>Which was Yoongi. </i>She pictured his laugh, his endless cuddles, and pouts. His little pouts always made her day along with the small things he did sometimes, like little fish buns stolen from the cafeteria that was presented to her by him as breakfast. It made her happy.</p><p>That is why it hurt even more when Magician\u2019s blade dug deep in her right thigh.</p><p>She screamed.</p><p>Didn\u2019t open her eyes.</p><p>Another stroke came, again on her abdomen.</p><p>She remembered <i>Yoongi</i>.

She missed him more than anything in that moment, so much that it hurt. Maybe hurt too much. Or was it the blade? All she knew was that she was burning all over. She felt the warm liquid leaving her body, making her dizzy. <i>Where was he?</i></p><p>What she did not know at that moment was that Six, Nine and Four was right behind the large metal door that kept Magician and herself locked in.</p><p>She screamed one last time before a loud crash that caused Seven to open her eyes, this time with agony.

                "content": "<p>It was the year of 2080, three years after her arrival and almost everything was still the same, except <i>them</i>. In just a matter of three years, a lot had happened as they struggled to stabilize a relationship between them. Whenever things looked like they were okay, <i>shit happened </i>and of course, there was this giant obstacle of <i>him</i> being close to everything related to emotions and what they brought to him. <i>Mostly her. </i>He started thinking about her like he did every morning before he left the bed. Her light brown hair, brown eyes that always reflected some kind of emotions, usually there was soft coldness which <i>he loved. </i>The images of her body flooded to his mind, the way how her body tensed up during a fight and when he was around, <i>how it relaxed when he touched her.</i> </p><p>He smiled with the picture he had in his mind as he was lying down in the dark room.</p><p>The picture of <i>her.</i> </p><p>He turned around with a loud grunt and grabbed his phone. 8.30 AM.</p><p>He had barely any sleep and he scrunched up his nose with the annoyance, mainly because <i>she</i> did not text him <i>&lsquo;Gm.&rsquo; </i>that morning.<i> </i>It seemed simple, but it was their way of saying, <i>&lsquo;I just woke up and it&rsquo;s so early.&rsquo; </i>It was Wednesday so she was probably already down at the gym, training hand to hand combat. He stood up with another grunt and changed to his regular clothes, a high collared almost tight black shirt with long sleeves and not-so-tight-but-tight pants to match the darkness of his looks.</p><p>Soon, Four walked his way to the training room to find no one there which was awkward because she <i>should</i> be there so he opened the panel over his right sleeve to see where she was from the GPS. By then, he was pouting with almost anger.</p><p><i>She did not appear to be in the PHASe facilities. </i></p><p><i>&lsquo;What the fuck?&rsquo; </i></p><p>He rushed to their briefing room in a haze, suspecting something was up. He should have known something had happened the moment he did not get his morning text. <i>How could he be so blind? </i></p><p>He stopped at the door upon hearing the voices of the members. Four walked inside.</p><p>The moment he walked in, every single voice stopped talking. With five pairs of eyes on him, he rolled his eyes and made his way to them. There was almost a dead silence inside, it was almost nightmarish. Four&rsquo;s almost black eyes ran over each and every single one of them.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo; </i></p><p>With the low, threatening voice of his members tensed up. All except Nine. So Four stepped closer to him and with each step, others could have sworn that the room was colder and the silence grew to be disturbing, almost uneasy. Nine seemed not sure if he should talk or not and the moment his mouth opened up and closed with no words coming out, Four pushed him to the wall. Hard.</p><p>&ldquo;TALK, NINE!&rdquo;</p><p>Holding his arm, Nine kept his calmness and stepped closer once again. Instead of answering, he simply pressed a few invisible keys to open a few camera footages while Six gave Four a handkerchief, signaling for him to open. When he did, he saw <i>her</i> GPS implant.</p><p>&ldquo;We spotted a few images all around Olympia and it looks like the Magician took her. They removed her implant so we could not track her.&rdquo; Nine started and Four once again moved to attack him but failed, crashing into a body. Six. The only person he could not be affected by his coldness.</p><p>He grunted.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>However,</i>&rdquo; Six held him tight. &ldquo;We know her location from the comm and what we need right now is you to be calm until we get to her. Can you do that?&rdquo;</p><p>Another grunt came, this one was quite hostile.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Can you, Yoongi?&rdquo; </i></p><p>He nodded, acting abrasive.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>Her eyes shuttered open to a dark room with dim lights. The air was stuffy and almost heavy. After having difficulty breathing for a few moments, she started taking short breaths which seemed to be working for her. She did not try to move, she could already feel the metal restraints around her wrists as well as the metal table she was on. But that wasn&rsquo;t the worst. <i>She was fucking cold. </i>Wherever she was, it was certainly unwelcoming and almost frosty.
