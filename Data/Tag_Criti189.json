Overall the exchange had the same energy as my parents getting me a coffeemaker for Christmas, and I\u2019m like,\u00a0\u201cOkay, you were obviously thinking of me when you got this, but&hellip;I don\u2019t want it&hellip;\u201d</p><p>+1 to Fjord/Caleb because Fjord is also tuned into getting Caleb Paper and Food and even made an undead specter in a severely misguided attempt to take the scouting burden off of Frumpkin. Caleb does not know what the proper reaction is to this. Is he supposed to be grateful? Disturbed? Awkward thumbs up it is.</p><p>Possible +0 (or +2? Hard to tell) because Caleb is still suffering from Fjord-related guilt on multiple levels, only compounded by Nott\u2019s insistence that Caleb stop him before he goes evil. ((Because you did so well at that last time, huh, Caleb? Because you\u2019ve aided and abetted every questionable decision this poor man has made, haven\u2019t you, Caleb? Because thinking about Fjord instead of Nott nearly lost you Nott the other day, didn\u2019t it Caleb?)) He\u2019s just weakly doubling down on the\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re calling the shots\u201d mantra at this point, but he is clearly Suffering</p><p>-20 to Fjord/Jester, because in spite of Fjord trying very hard to patch things up and explain himself, Jester just Does Not Believe he has any feelings of any kind for her anymore. She remains upset over his dangerous impulsiveness, and things only get worse once he starts snapping at Jester to fix sails instead of get tea.</p><p>+30 to Jester/Beau.
