        "body": "<h2>Are Jon and Sansa plotting together?</h2><h2>Could it be possible that political Jon is part of a hidden plot orchestrated by Jon and Sansa? I see this potentially being a major twist in the upcoming season.</h2><p>As I understand it, the consensus is that Jon started playing the game on his own a while after he had arrived Dragonstone. I believe that the political Jon scheme was forged earlier in Winterfell by both Jon and Sansa working together. Earlier I wrote a post that goes more into depth on this, <a href=\"https://northsky7.tumblr.com/post/181820833331/politicaljonsa\">here </a>(although my ideas have matured somewhat since writing it).</p><p>I am also seriously starting to believe that by the time Jon gets back to Winterfell, Sansa already knows about R+L=J and that she will use this knowledge to stay ahead of the game. But first, consider this:</p><p><b>A potential hidden scheming plot between Jon and Sansa</b></p><p>The issue that first triggered my tinfoil theory on the possibility of Jon and Sansa plotting together, was Sansa\u2019s behavior before Jon left for Dragonstone. Up until then, she has learned from the best players in the game, utilizing these lessons in order to survive. Then the show led us to believe that she does the exact opposite, just letting Jon leave for Dragonstone knowing he doesn\u2019t have a solid game plan or backup plans if everything turns to shit? Why would she take such a passive approach when Jon\u2019s life, Winterfell and the North is at risk? If Jon fails his mission, this will no doubt put her own safety and future at risk. It makes no sense to me. Especially when she knows how reckless he can be. Jon\u2019s\u00a0plan to fight Ramsay in\u00a0BotB despite having fewer men proved to her that Jon is a massive risk taker. Jon went ahead with the battle knowing his chances of winning were slim. And that is why Sansa mobilized the army of the Vale; because she knew he needed her help to win.\u00a0With that in mind, taking\u00a0into account her journey and struggles, I believe there is no way that she would let him go without sharing her political knowledge with him and strategizing with him, thereby strengthening his chances of success. By working together and trusting each other (foreshadowed in S6), they could have developed a solid game plan and contingency plans that would ensure (his survival and) a successful mission.\u00a0</p><p>Just to clarify, I believe Sansa was blind-sighted by Jon\u2019s decision to leave when he announced this at the meeting with the NL. However, I think there was an important off-screen conversation between the two of them after that meeting or perhaps the night before he left. And even though I think Jon can play the game on his own, I suspect that political Jon might be part of an overall joint strategy planned by them both.</p><p>The show <b>tells</b> us that Sansa and Jon are innocent, honorable and na\u00efve with a strong moral code (much like their father/uncle). On the other hand, their actions <b>show</b> us a different, darker side to them. Both Sansa and Jon have played the game in order to survive, although seemingly with their moral compass intact. But now, as KitN and Lady of Winterfell, they both know the stakes are much higher. They are undoubtedly players in the big game now, a game where you win or die. I believe the letters they received from both Cersei and Daenerys made that clear to them beyond a doubt. And they need each other to make it through this. I think that was the point D&amp;D was trying to get across when Jon and Sansa were butting heads. After the BotB I also think Jon saw that they can be stronger when working together as a pack, instead of him acting on his own as a lone wolf. And Tyrion\u2019s comment to Jon, that Sansa is a lot smarter than she lets on, could be foreshadowing Sansa\u2019s role in Jon\u2019s game.</p><p>In terms of them plotting and strategizing, I believe their journeys so far have taught them that in order to survive they must play the game, and they must play it better than their opponents. And the only way to do that is to think and act like their enemies, skills that I believe both Jon and Sansa have mastered (exemplified by Jon vs the Wildlings and Sansa vs Littlefinger). So why would it be any different when Jon goes to Dragonstone when the stakes are even higher? The only logical answer in my mind is that when Jon goes south he goes well prepared for potential scenarios in his meeting with Daenerys, with Sansa\u2019s support and guidance \u2013 and that he is prepared to do whatever it takes to protect their family and their people, no matter the cost to their pride or honor.</p><p><b>So what is the game plan?</b></p><p>Hypothetically, say that Jon and Sansa are plotting together, what would their game plan be? Based on Jon\u2019s skills as a military man/strategist and Sansa\u2019s skills as a politician, I could imagine it being something like this&hellip;</p><p>Phase 1: present the dire facts of the situation (the army of the dead is coming for us all), reason with Daenerys and appeal her to make the honorable choice; urge her to put her plans of conquering Westeros on hold to help save the world. In other words, use the Stark utilitarian approach where the best course of action is that which benefits the greater good. Meanwhile as a contingency plan (keeping the political game in mind), gather intelligence to learn what you can about your opponent (strengths and weaknesses), in case a change of tactics becomes necessary.</p><p>Phase 2: initiated once it is clear that Daenerys will not see reason. At this point use all means necessary to achieve a successful mission - the ends justifying the means. In other words, play the Machiavellian game that Sansa has learned from her \u00abmentors\u00bb. The <b>ends</b> being: keep Jon alive when dealing with the Dragon Queen, protect House Stark, Winterfell and the North, and hopefully save the people of Westeros from extinction. The <b>means</b> being: using manipulation, playing on Daenerys\u2019 weaknesses \u2013 whatever it takes to get her on-board and invested in the fight against the dead in the North. This is where political Jon comes into effect. As Jon discovers that Daenerys\u2019 weakness is, in fact, her infatuation with him, he uses this to his advantage by sleeping with her and submitting to her - getting her emotionally invested.\u00a0</p><p>Working and plotting together would certainly give Jon and Sansa a strategic advantage in the game, enabling them to be one step ahead of their opponents. I believe Sansa is a crucial player in this regard. While Jon plays the game in Dragonstone, on-screen Sansa prepares Winterfell for the Great War. Off-screen Sansa, on the other hand, could be lobbying the NL, secretly building alliances and strengthening Jon and Sansa\u2019s position for when the Dragon Queen arrives Winterfell. While \u201cfighting every battle in her mind\u201d and considering \u201cevery possible series of events happening all at once\u201d, she could be preparing for various scenarios that could arise once Daenerys arrives Winterfell. She could be making strategic plans on how to handle potentially dangerous situations with Daenerys. And if the assumptions by\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m61FcucyaOKFkj0gFLKRgJA\">@thelawyerthatwaspromised</a>\u00a0are correct, that Jon and Sansa have been in communication more than once during his time in Dragonstone (I can\u2019t find the\u00a0actual post, sorry),\u00a0intelligence and insider information from Jon on Camp Dany would help Sansa in this effort.</p><p>So how would R+L=J play a part in this? Here is where it gets really interesting. After reading this <a href=\"https://fortunatelylori.tumblr.com/post/182300833591/coming-into-season-8-jonsa-will-have-old-tension\">post </a>by <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfOiG9or7QPmdyNhTSD9Ftw\">@fortunatelylori</a>, it dawned on me. What if Bran has told Sansa who Jon really is? That would certainly change the rules of the game for Sansa, especially considering:</p><ol><li>She knows that she is the Key to the North.\u00a0</li><li>She knows that Daenerys wants the North.</li><li>She knows Tyrion is coming\u00a0to the North and that Daenerys might possibly demand that their marriage is consummated, thereby gaining control of Winterfell and the northernmost Kingdom through Tyrion.\u00a0</li><li>She knows that at some point Camp Dany will find out about political Jon.</li><li>She knows that once it is revealed that Jon is the rightful heir to the Iron Throne, Daenerys will most likely change her status from friend to enemy.\u00a0</li></ol><p>Although I cannot speculate on the details of Sansa\u2019s strategies in Winterfell just yet, I do think\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfOiG9or7QPmdyNhTSD9Ftw\">@fortunatelylori</a> is definitely on to something in regards to Tyrion. In her post, she argued that Jon and Sansa could secretly marry to prevent Sansa from having to meet Daenerys\u2019 demands of reinstating her marriage to Tyrion. I definitely think the marriage issue will come up considering marriage is a key part of her narrative. But I also believe there is a possibility that Jon and Sansa could secretly marry <b><i>before </i></b>Daenerys even raises the issue, as a result of Sansa\u2019s beforehand knowledge of R+L=J.\u00a0</p><p>So basically my theory rests on the assumption that Jon and Sansa trust each other and are strategizing together, Jon relying heavily on Sansa\u2019s help and support; which he will most certainly need when he comes back to Winterfell. In S8, I believe much of her arc will be about utilizing all the lessons she has learned, enabling her with the capability to calculate the moves of her opponents and adjusting the Starks\u2019 moves accordingly, therefore being one step ahead of the game. A skill I think she has mastered after having been \u201cmentored\u201d by the best schemers in the game. The irony perhaps being that the schemers, who sought out to abuse and manipulate Sansa, are outsmarted by their victim as a result of them unknowingly passing on the rules and tactics of the game on to her.

I see this potentially being a major twist in the upcoming season.</h2><p>As I understand it, the consensus is that Jon started playing the game on his own a while after he had arrived Dragonstone. I believe that the political Jon scheme was forged earlier in Winterfell by both Jon and Sansa working together. Earlier I wrote a post that goes more into depth on this, <a href=\"https://northsky7.tumblr.com/post/181820833331/politicaljonsa\">here </a>(although my ideas have matured somewhat since writing it).</p><p>I am also seriously starting to believe that by the time Jon gets back to Winterfell, Sansa already knows about R+L=J and that she will use this knowledge to stay ahead of the game. But first, consider this:</p><p><b>A potential hidden scheming plot between Jon and Sansa</b></p><p>The issue that first triggered my tinfoil theory on the possibility of Jon and Sansa plotting together, was Sansa\u2019s behavior before Jon left for Dragonstone. Up until then, she has learned from the best players in the game, utilizing these lessons in order to survive. Then the show led us to believe that she does the exact opposite, just letting Jon leave for Dragonstone knowing he doesn\u2019t have a solid game plan or backup plans if everything turns to shit? Why would she take such a passive approach when Jon\u2019s life, Winterfell and the North is at risk? If Jon fails his mission, this will no doubt put her own safety and future at risk. It makes no sense to me. Especially when she knows how reckless he can be. Jon\u2019s\u00a0plan to fight Ramsay in\u00a0BotB despite having fewer men proved to her that Jon is a massive risk taker. Jon went ahead with the battle knowing his chances of winning were slim. And that is why Sansa mobilized the army of the Vale; because she knew he needed her help to win.\u00a0With that in mind, taking\u00a0into account her journey and struggles, I believe there is no way that she would let him go without sharing her political knowledge with him and strategizing with him, thereby strengthening his chances of success. By working together and trusting each other (foreshadowed in S6), they could have developed a solid game plan and contingency plans that would ensure (his survival and) a successful mission.\u00a0</p><p>Just to clarify, I believe Sansa was blind-sighted by Jon\u2019s decision to leave when he announced this at the meeting with the NL. However, I think there was an important off-screen conversation between the two of them after that meeting or perhaps the night before he left. And even though I think Jon can play the game on his own, I suspect that political Jon might be part of an overall joint strategy planned by them both.</p><p>The show <b>tells</b> us that Sansa and Jon are innocent, honorable and na\u00efve with a strong moral code (much like their father/uncle). On the other hand, their actions <b>show</b> us a different, darker side to them. Both Sansa and Jon have played the game in order to survive, although seemingly with their moral compass intact. But now, as KitN and Lady of Winterfell, they both know the stakes are much higher. They are undoubtedly players in the big game now, a game where you win or die. I believe the letters they received from both Cersei and Daenerys made that clear to them beyond a doubt. And they need each other to make it through this. I think that was the point D&amp;D was trying to get across when Jon and Sansa were butting heads. After the BotB I also think Jon saw that they can be stronger when working together as a pack, instead of him acting on his own as a lone wolf. And Tyrion\u2019s comment to Jon, that Sansa is a lot smarter than she lets on, could be foreshadowing Sansa\u2019s role in Jon\u2019s game.</p><p>In terms of them plotting and strategizing, I believe their journeys so far have taught them that in order to survive they must play the game, and they must play it better than their opponents. And the only way to do that is to think and act like their enemies, skills that I believe both Jon and Sansa have mastered (exemplified by Jon vs the Wildlings and Sansa vs Littlefinger). So why would it be any different when Jon goes to Dragonstone when the stakes are even higher? The only logical answer in my mind is that when Jon goes south he goes well prepared for potential scenarios in his meeting with Daenerys, with Sansa\u2019s support and guidance \u2013 and that he is prepared to do whatever it takes to protect their family and their people, no matter the cost to their pride or honor.</p><p><b>So what is the game plan?</b></p><p>Hypothetically, say that Jon and Sansa are plotting together, what would their game plan be? Based on Jon\u2019s skills as a military man/strategist and Sansa\u2019s skills as a politician, I could imagine it being something like this\u2026</p><p>Phase 1: present the dire facts of the situation (the army of the dead is coming for us all), reason with Daenerys and appeal her to make the honorable choice; urge her to put her plans of conquering Westeros on hold to help save the world. In other words, use the Stark utilitarian approach where the best course of action is that which benefits the greater good. Meanwhile as a contingency plan (keeping the political game in mind), gather intelligence to learn what you can about your opponent (strengths and weaknesses), in case a change of tactics becomes necessary.</p><p>Phase 2: initiated once it is clear that Daenerys will not see reason. At this point use all means necessary to achieve a successful mission - the ends justifying the means. In other words, play the Machiavellian game that Sansa has learned from her \u00abmentors\u00bb. The <b>ends</b> being: keep Jon alive when dealing with the Dragon Queen, protect House Stark, Winterfell and the North, and hopefully save the people of Westeros from extinction. The <b>means</b> being: using manipulation, playing on Daenerys\u2019 weaknesses \u2013 whatever it takes to get her on-board and invested in the fight against the dead in the North. This is where political Jon comes into effect. As Jon discovers that Daenerys\u2019 weakness is, in fact, her infatuation with him, he uses this to his advantage by sleeping with her and submitting to her - getting her emotionally invested.\u00a0</p><p>Working and plotting together would certainly give Jon and Sansa a strategic advantage in the game, enabling them to be one step ahead of their opponents. I believe Sansa is a crucial player in this regard. While Jon plays the game in Dragonstone, on-screen Sansa prepares Winterfell for the Great War. Off-screen Sansa, on the other hand, could be lobbying the NL, secretly building alliances and strengthening Jon and Sansa\u2019s position for when the Dragon Queen arrives Winterfell. While \u201cfighting every battle in her mind\u201d and considering \u201cevery possible series of events happening all at once\u201d, she could be preparing for various scenarios that could arise once Daenerys arrives Winterfell. She could be making strategic plans on how to handle potentially dangerous situations with Daenerys. And if the assumptions by\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m61FcucyaOKFkj0gFLKRgJA\">@thelawyerthatwaspromised</a>\u00a0are correct, that Jon and Sansa have been in communication more than once during his time in Dragonstone (I can\u2019t find the\u00a0actual post, sorry),\u00a0intelligence and insider information from Jon on Camp Dany would help Sansa in this effort.</p><p>So how would R+L=J play a part in this? Here is where it gets really interesting. After reading this <a href=\"https://fortunatelylori.tumblr.com/post/182300833591/coming-into-season-8-jonsa-will-have-old-tension\">post </a>by <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfOiG9or7QPmdyNhTSD9Ftw\">@fortunatelylori</a>, it dawned on me. What if Bran has told Sansa who Jon really is? That would certainly change the rules of the game for Sansa, especially considering:</p><ol><li>She knows that she is the Key to the North.\u00a0</li><li>She knows that Daenerys wants the North.</li><li>She knows Tyrion is coming\u00a0to the North and that Daenerys might possibly demand that their marriage is consummated, thereby gaining control of Winterfell and the northernmost Kingdom through Tyrion.\u00a0</li><li>She knows that at some point Camp Dany will find out about political Jon.</li><li>She knows that once it is revealed that Jon is the rightful heir to the Iron Throne, Daenerys will most likely change her status from friend to enemy.\u00a0</li></ol><p>Although I cannot speculate on the details of Sansa\u2019s strategies in Winterfell just yet, I do think\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfOiG9or7QPmdyNhTSD9Ftw\">@fortunatelylori</a> is definitely on to something in regards to Tyrion. In her post, she argued that Jon and Sansa could secretly marry to prevent Sansa from having to meet Daenerys\u2019 demands of reinstating her marriage to Tyrion. I definitely think the marriage issue will come up considering marriage is a key part of her narrative. But I also believe there is a possibility that Jon and Sansa could secretly marry <b><i>before </i></b>Daenerys even raises the issue, as a result of Sansa\u2019s beforehand knowledge of R+L=J.\u00a0</p><p>So basically my theory rests on the assumption that Jon and Sansa trust each other and are strategizing together, Jon relying heavily on Sansa\u2019s help and support; which he will most certainly need when he comes back to Winterfell. In S8, I believe much of her arc will be about utilizing all the lessons she has learned, enabling her with the capability to calculate the moves of her opponents and adjusting the Starks\u2019 moves accordingly, therefore being one step ahead of the game. A skill I think she has mastered after having been \u201cmentored\u201d by the best schemers in the game. The irony perhaps being that the schemers, who sought out to abuse and manipulate Sansa, are outsmarted by their victim as a result of them unknowingly passing on the rules and tactics of the game on to her. And I think this could be one of the biggest twists in the show, considering her character development, going from a naive stupid girl (which she herself has claimed to be on several occasions) to becoming a mastermind player in the Game of Thrones.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>I know my tinfoil theory has flaws and holes that have yet to be explored, but I hope it makes some kind of sense.</p></p>",

Based on Jon&rsquo;s skills as a military man/strategist and Sansa&rsquo;s skills as a politician, I could imagine it being something like this&hellip;</p><p>Phase 1: present the dire facts of the situation (the army of the dead is coming for us all), reason with Daenerys and appeal her to make the honorable choice; urge her to put her plans of conquering Westeros on hold to help save the world. In other words, use the Stark utilitarian approach where the best course of action is that which benefits the greater good. Meanwhile as a contingency plan (keeping the political game in mind), gather intelligence to learn what you can about your opponent (strengths and weaknesses), in case a change of tactics becomes necessary.</p><p>Phase 2: initiated once it is clear that Daenerys will not see reason. At this point use all means necessary to achieve a successful mission - the ends justifying the means. In other words, play the Machiavellian game that Sansa has learned from her &laquo;mentors&raquo;. The <b>ends</b> being: keep Jon alive when dealing with the Dragon Queen, protect House Stark, Winterfell and the North, and hopefully save the people of Westeros from extinction. The <b>means</b> being: using manipulation, playing on Daenerys&rsquo; weaknesses &ndash; whatever it takes to get her on-board and invested in the fight against the dead in the North. This is where political Jon comes into effect. As Jon discovers that Daenerys&rsquo; weakness is, in fact, her infatuation with him, he uses this to his advantage by sleeping with her and submitting to her - getting her emotionally invested.&nbsp;</p><p>Working and plotting together would certainly give Jon and Sansa a strategic advantage in the game, enabling them to be one step ahead of their opponents. I believe Sansa is a crucial player in this regard. While Jon plays the game in Dragonstone, on-screen Sansa prepares Winterfell for the Great War. Off-screen Sansa, on the other hand, could be lobbying the NL, secretly building alliances and strengthening Jon and Sansa&rsquo;s position for when the Dragon Queen arrives Winterfell. While &ldquo;fighting every battle in her mind&rdquo; and considering &ldquo;every possible series of events happening all at once&rdquo;, she could be preparing for various scenarios that could arise once Daenerys arrives Winterfell. She could be making strategic plans on how to handle potentially dangerous situations with Daenerys. And if the assumptions by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m61FcucyaOKFkj0gFLKRgJA\">@thelawyerthatwaspromised</a>&nbsp;are correct, that Jon and Sansa have been in communication more than once during his time in Dragonstone (I can&rsquo;t find the&nbsp;actual post, sorry),&nbsp;intelligence and insider information from Jon on Camp Dany would help Sansa in this effort.</p><p>So how would R+L=J play a part in this? Here is where it gets really interesting. After reading this <a href=\"https://fortunatelylori.tumblr.com/post/182300833591/coming-into-season-8-jonsa-will-have-old-tension\">post </a>by <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfOiG9or7QPmdyNhTSD9Ftw\">@fortunatelylori</a>, it dawned on me. What if Bran has told Sansa who Jon really is? That would certainly change the rules of the game for Sansa, especially considering:</p><ol><li>She knows that she is the Key to the North.&nbsp;</li><li>She knows that Daenerys wants the North.</li><li>She knows Tyrion is coming&nbsp;to the North and that Daenerys might possibly demand that their marriage is consummated, thereby gaining control of Winterfell and the northernmost Kingdom through Tyrion.&nbsp;</li><li>She knows that at some point Camp Dany will find out about political Jon.</li><li>She knows that once it is revealed that Jon is the rightful heir to the Iron Throne, Daenerys will most likely change her status from friend to enemy.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>Although I cannot speculate on the details of Sansa&rsquo;s strategies in Winterfell just yet, I do think&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfOiG9or7QPmdyNhTSD9Ftw\">@fortunatelylori</a> is definitely on to something in regards to Tyrion. In her post, she argued that Jon and Sansa could secretly marry to prevent Sansa from having to meet Daenerys&rsquo; demands of reinstating her marriage to Tyrion. I definitely think the marriage issue will come up considering marriage is a key part of her narrative. But I also believe there is a possibility that Jon and Sansa could secretly marry <b><i>before </i></b>Daenerys even raises the issue, as a result of Sansa&rsquo;s beforehand knowledge of R+L=J.&nbsp;</p><p>So basically my theory rests on the assumption that Jon and Sansa trust each other and are strategizing together, Jon relying heavily on Sansa&rsquo;s help and support; which he will most certainly need when he comes back to Winterfell. In S8, I believe much of her arc will be about utilizing all the lessons she has learned, enabling her with the capability to calculate the moves of her opponents and adjusting the Starks&rsquo; moves accordingly, therefore being one step ahead of the game. A skill I think she has mastered after having been &ldquo;mentored&rdquo; by the best schemers in the game. The irony perhaps being that the schemers, who sought out to abuse and manipulate Sansa, are outsmarted by their victim as a result of them unknowingly passing on the rules and tactics of the game on to her. And I think this could be one of the biggest twists in the show, considering her character development, going from a naive stupid girl (which she herself has claimed to be on several occasions) to becoming a mastermind player in the Game of Thrones.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I know my tinfoil theory has flaws and holes that have yet to be explored, but I hope it makes some kind of sense.</p></p>",

And you went down with an audible thud.</p><p>\u201cA slave ship.\u201d Jorah pointed out to an empty space of water near by. No doubt there was a ship there, but how could he tell it was a slave ship.</p><p>\u201cWhy are the anchored?\u201d You asked looking to the older man.</p><p>His eyes were watching the ship intently as it just floated there in the water like all ships do.</p><p>\u201cThey probably came ashore for\u2014\u201c</p><p>You heard a sword scraping against the metal lips of it\u2019s sheath as it was drawn \u201cWater.\u201d A man finished in a deep voice. His accent was thick and heavy, one you\u2019d never heard before. You grabbed onto your dress, almost subconsciously trying to pull it closer to yourself.</p><!-- more --><p>Turning your head you saw a group of five men holding their sword like weapons. To short to be a sword. To long to be a dagger. </p><p>You stood along with Jorah and looked at them. You\u2019d never seen people like them before. So much cloth and utilities around their waist attached to their belt. If you didn\u2019t know any better, you\u2019d say they were pirates. Well&hellip; Slavers and Pirates were&hellip; similar in some ways.</p><p>They\u2019d taken you to the shore, where their boats sat that would take them back to the ship. You sat on your knees next to Tyrion and Jorah. In a line of sorts.</p><p><br/></p><hr><p><br/></p><p>\u201cGot a lot of fight in you, huh?\u201d</p><p>You let out a angered huff as the captor hit Jorah once more. This trip was turning more and more into an adventure. You needed a nap, you needed to actually see and verify your daughter was alright. </p><p>Jorah fell to the ground and the captor who assumed was also the captain of the ship turned to walk a little ways away.</p><p>\u201cSalt mines?\u201d He asked one of his men, standing by his side eyeing Jorah and then looking to your Uncle and to you before looking back at Jorah.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that or a galley slave.\u201d He confirmed \u201cHe looks strong enough.\u201d</p><p>The captor then looked to your uncle again and an unimpressed look crossed his face. Most people looked down upon dwarfs. Though, you never understood why. Tyrion was a very clever man.</p><p>\u201cWorthless.\u201d His comrade spoke. Your brows furrowed at his decision but you didn\u2019t argue. You didn\u2019t want to take any chances with him. He could decide to cut your tongue out if he found you to be too mouthy</p><p>\u201cCut his throat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!\u201d Tyrion repeated in a panic his hands going up defensively as you subconsciously positioned yourself to bolt up and attack if you needed to. You hadn\u2019t realized you\u2019d done it until one of the slavers came over and shoved you down onto the dirt.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s discuss this!\u201d Tyrion continued</p><p>\u201cAnd then chop off his cock. We\u2019ll sell it for a fortune. A Edward\u2019s cock has magic powers\u201d He stated.</p><p>What was it with these people. Did people east of Westerns just have a fascination with dwarfs? </p><p>The captor began to walk away to the boats, and the man he had been talking to took out his weapon and walked towards Tyrion</p><p>\u201cWait! Wait! Wait! You can\u2019t just hand a dry cock to a merchant and expect him to pay for it!\u201d</p><p>You had been pushed over next to Jorah back on your knees to be back in the original position you\u2019d been in. The man had brought his weapon to Tyrion\u2019s neck but seemed to be waiting for his commander\u2019s orders.</p><p>\u201cHe has to know it came from a dwarf! And how could he know unless he sees the dwarf?\u201d</p><p>Tyrion\u2019s head had been turned back to the man who\u2019s dagger was against his throat. The man using the sword to make him look back at him.</p><p>\u201cIt will be a dwarf-sized cock.\u201d He responded </p><p>\u201cGuess again.\u201d </p><p>Ew. Tyrion looked the man dead in the eye while you made a face. The slaver looked to the commander waiting for what he had to say. You could hear the sound of a canteen being plugged up again from behind you right before he spoke</p><p>\u201cThe dwarf lives until we find a cock merchant.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion let out an audible sigh of relief, that for the millionth time in his life has spared it.</p><p>\u201cWhat of the girl?\u201d The man asked walking over to you and lifting your chin with the dagger to look at him. You glared at him and let a huff out through your nose.</p><p>\u201cWhore house?\u201d He questioned</p><p>\u201cNo. She\u2019s had children. She\u2019ll go with the man.\u201d He stated </p><p>You turned your head to look at the commander as he eyed you up and down. \u201cHow would you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old are you?\u201d He asked</p><p>You didn\u2019t want to answer. But you knew you had to</p><p>\u201cEighteen. Almost nineteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo eighteen year old has the hips of a mother, unless they are a mother.\u201d You shrugged slightly and made an impressed face. He wasn\u2019t wrong. Before you\u2019d had Lucia your hips where slender, and maybe because of how small you were when you had her, only being 15 when you had fallen pregnant and 16 when you gave birth, your hips had widened noticeably. </p><p>One of the men picked you up by your upper arms and took you to one of the paddle boats pushing you to step into it. Carefully you stepped in and sat down messing with the extra length of rope around your wrists</p><p>\u201cQueen Daenerys has outlawed slavery.\u201d Jorah said almost like a demand</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re bound for Volantis, not Slaver\u2019s Bay. Besides, reopened the fighting pits. I\u2019ve never heard of free men fighting in the pits.\u201d The commander responded</p><p>\u201cI have.\u201d You interupted.</p><p>He looked at you and rose a brow at what you\u2019d said. You\u2019d only seen a fight in a pit once. And it wasn\u2019t pretty</p><p>\u201cIt was a trial.\u201d You responded. He only rolled his eyes and looked back at your uncle and Jorah </p><p>\u201cThe fighting pits in Meereen? You\u2019re in luck, then! You\u2019re about to be rich! You are looking at one of the great warriors in the seven kingdoms.\u201d Tyrion said. Jorah. Her Jorah Mormont of Bear Island. During this whole debacle you\u2019d forgotten that Jorah had once been a talented fighter.</p><p>\u201cHim? He\u2019s got to be sixty years old.\u201d He responded </p><p>\u201cSure, he\u2019s a bit long in the tooth, a bit withered, been in the sun too long.\u201d </p><p>You gave Tyrion a look, of all the things he could say he was choosing that? He was just confirming that fact that Jorah was an older man.</p><p>\u201cWe can all see that. But he is a veteran of 100 battles. They wrote songs about him!\u201d</p><p>The commander put his foot up on the bow of the boat and gestured for his men to bring Jorah closer</p><p>\u201cThat true?\u201d</p><p>Jorah just looked like he was struggling to nod before he was able to and once again Tyrion began to wiggle you all out of your deaths.</p><p>\u201cHe won the tournament at Lannisport. Unseating Ser Jaime Lannister himself.\u201d</p><p>The commander began laughing at Tyrion putting his foot down and standing up straight and Tyrion face dropped while you and Jorah looked on at the interaction you never thought you\u2019d see.</p><p>\u201cThe Kingslayer!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJousting. You\u2019re talking about jousting A fancy game for fancy lads. The men who fight in the pits of Merreen will swallow him whole.\u201d</p><p>&ldquo;I killed a Dothraki bloodrider in single combat.\u201d </p><p>You looked to Jorah amazed. Cause if it was true, he had to be the best. The Dothraki were some of the fiercest fighters anyone\u2019s ever seen. </p><p>The commander got off of the boat you were sitting in and walked over to Jorah and stood less than a foot away from his face.</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no lie. His name was Qotho. He was bloodrider to Khal Drogo. Take me to Slaver\u2019s Bay, put a sword in my hand, I\u2019ll prove my worth.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><hr><p><br/></p><p>\u201cThis one\u2019s a Westerosi knight\u201d </p><p>You closed your eyes as the chains put a weight on your wrists and your neck. Some men from Meereen standing in front in a small crowd, as the commander and Jorah stood on a pathetic looking wooden stage. The last time you saw a stage someone was killed.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s from an ancient house trained in sword and lance. He fought beside the stag King Robert \u00a0on the far side of the Narrow Sea. He was first through the breach during the Siege of Spike, slaughtering fifty men with his flaming sword. He killed the great Khal Drogo in single combat. Betrayed by his woman he sold himself into slavery to repay his debts. Biding begins at 12 gold honors.\u201d</p><p>The small crowd began murmuring as you and Tyrion stood side by side watching as the men in bright blue, green and white discussed it to themselves </p><p>\u201cTwenty\u201d One man offered taking out a bag of coins and throwing it to the commander who swiftly caught it and began pulling Jorah to the the man who you assumed was his new \u2018master\u2019\u201d</p><p>The man began to take Jorah away, dragging him by the chains he was attached to.</p><p>\u201cWait! You have to buy us as well!\u201d Tyrion yelled trying to run forward, the man behind you both grabbing onto his chain and yanking him back as best he could.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d The buyer asked shrugging his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all a team. She\u2019s a great fighter too.\u201d Tyrion said pointing to you. </p><p>Your eyes went wide as you glared at the top of his head your hands balling into fists. The crowd laughed. Yes, because how would a woman know how to fight?</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s funny. You have to give him that\u201d The commander said with a smile after he was done laughing himself.</p><p>Tyrion looked at you as the man kept trying to pull Tyrion\u2019s chain. And you decided to prove his point. With your quick movements you turned and grabbed Tyrion\u2019s chain yanking the man forward so hard he fell to the ground with a loud thud, you and Tyrion both began to hit him. Not that you wanted to hurt the poor boy. You just needed out so you could find Varys and Lucia.</p><p>The man smiled slightly with a hesitant nod as he walked forward to the commander once more and handed him more gold \u201cYou\u2019re right. He\u2019s funny.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><hr><p><br/></p><p>They\u2019d given you your sword. The gave you armor for a man, not for a woman. The armor was that of what you\u2019d seen Ned wearing the day he was killed. Small plates of armor placed closely together and surrounded by leather to make it into a vest of sorts. You\u2019d put your hair up with a ribbon they\u2019d given you. Your golden hair coming down in waves, something Tyrion said looked like a waterfall as it was put in the ponytail.</p><p>You wore chainmail on your arms and had your sword sharpened by Jorah. Of course you\u2019d never been taught how to sharpen your own sword. But you held the golden hilt, thumb on the large jewel that sat on the rain-guard of the sword.</p><p>This sword would be used in battle today. A sword that had never seen it. Not once. And at a point in time it used to be part of a larger sword which saw many battles during Robert\u2019s Rebellion. A large sword that had been held by Ned Stark. And then once split into two, held by Joffrey Baratheon and Jaime Lannister. Then Joffrey died. And Jaime gave his sword to Brienne of Tarth. And Varys told the sword out of Joffrey\u2019s crypt for you. </p><p>You could hear the fighting of the first few who had gone out. The sound of steel hitting steel and the sound of men grunting as they were killed by their opponents. </p><p>You were snapped out of your thoughts when Jorah came running back from the entrance. He didn\u2019t speak a word, but he grabbed his sword and helmet. And you being how you were, grabbed your own as Tyrion asked what you were doing.</p><p>But you followed him. And when he opened the door to the fighting pits you followed him out. You could see the blood in the sand and the dead men laying on the ground in a pool of their own blood.</p><p>The man who had bought you three tried to stop you, grabbing unto the back of Jorah\u2019s vest, but you kept going. Walking towards the fight. You didn\u2019t want to die and you\u2019d been damned if you never saw your little girl because you died in a fighting pit. </p><p>What was it Arya had said? About what she said to the god of death every day?</p><p>Not Today.</p><p>You would remember that everyday. Every time you walked through he staircase you and Arya had made your escape from. The very staircase where she pointed her sword at you defensively. She was younger than you, and you had learned from her. </p><p>You had a grip on your sword as you went in helmet securely on your head as you went up to a man who was beating in the skull of another with a rock. With the flat of your sword you knocked him out, the amount of force creating an open wound on the side of his bald head. </p><p>You could hear people react to what you had done, but you couldn\u2019t hear it. All you could hear was the small voice of the little girl you\u2019d given birth to. You\u2019d followed Jorah blindly the past four weeks. You hadn\u2019t seen Lucia in a month and you\u2019d never been parted from her for longer than an hour before. </p><p>You could hear Jorah behind you taking out a few opponents of his own as he came across them. And it was then you heard the gate opening and closing again. You knew more fighters from inside the tunnel had come out. You two had more competition but you could handle it, you knew you could.</p><p>Grabbing the back of one of the men\u2019s vests, you pulled him back and pulled his arm over your should with so much force you could hear the sound of his shoulder dislocating and his forearm breaking in half.</p><p>Jorah had taken on a man who had a wreaking ball easily, and then took on another, as did you. You avoided killing any of them. You refused to. This wasn\u2019t life or death. They weren\u2019t the type to get up after being bested by a woman.</p><p>However you had gotten pulled back this time. A man holding a dagger to your throat. You had moved instinctively and his blade had been shoved up to your face and dug into your jaw and went diagonally to your ear. </p><p>You could feel the blood start to run down your cheek, but the adrenaline had stifled the pain of the large, deep cut. You turned and again with the flat of your sword hit him upside the head knocking him clean out</p><p>Looking around, everyone was down on the ground. The ones you and Jorah had taken, still alive and breathing, but not dead. Severely injured, but not dead.</p><p>You looked at Jorah as walked forward to the platform for a woman stood. Her dress was a smooth white fabric, a cape around her shoulders and showing off a nice medal chest piece which was attached to her cape. It was in the shape of two dragon wings, and three dragon heads protruding from the center. She had long silver hair that was done up in an extravagant style, something you\u2019d never seen in King\u2019s Landing.</p><p>Daenerys Targaryen.</p><p>You slowly approached her, only a few feet behind Jorah as the unsullied by her side held up their spears and got closer with their shields up closer.</p><p>Jorah removed his helmet to reveal to her his face to her. You left yours on. She wouldn\u2019t recognize you. All she\u2019d see was a small golden haired girl who was shorter than herself. A small golden haired girl who apparently had the hips of a mother.</p><p>Daenerys\u2019s face softened as she looked at him, and then once again harden. Just as fast as it had softened </p><p>\u201cGet him out of my sight.\u201d</p><p>Jorah looked like he was about to start begging her. And he did. His head held high as looked up to her </p><p>\u201cKhaleesi, please. I just need a moment of your time.\u201d</p><p>Two guards grabbed onto Jorah\u2019s arms and they pushed you aside as if you were another object. In the way</p><p>\u201cI brought you a gift!\u201d Jorah yelled out as the guards where taking him away. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true!\u201d</p><p>Tyrion had walked out, the chains that had attached him to the wall&hellip; Still attached to his wrists, but not to the wall. Someone had broken him free from staying by the wall.</p><p>The mother of dragons looked over to see the dwarf Lannister walking behind Jorah and next to you.</p><p>\u201cHe has.\u201d You finished </p><p>\u201cAnd who are you\u201d She asked her dark brows furrowing in confusion, anger and frustration. </p><p>\u201cWe are the gift.\u201d Tyrion responded holding up his chains for her to see. She still looked confused as she looked from your uncle to you and back and forth in a cycle.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, Your Grace.\u201d You greeted with a warm smile. And a nod.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Y/N Baratheon, he is Tyrion Lannister\u201d</p><p><br/></p><hr><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@disneyprincessbuffyannesummers</a>@siennarothenburg <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m57PumL3XTHKMbhaLBCDM6Q\" target=\"_blank\">@nighthood13</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzBlNV0PDM4SXm6Ym1PSJAw\" target=\"_blank\">@cevanstann</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/majsdnQ_JnelNmwA-W4FunA\" target=\"_blank\">@boredbrit</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mA_-qHoQbaPG0d8C94bexmA\" target=\"_blank\">@celestial-melancholy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrQghx2HTRQWATopqUw0s2w\" target=\"_blank\">@qhbr2013</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAeRnp4q0NBV8t7q1b6qpVw\" target=\"_blank\">@falling-stars-never-cry</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ms0BdTYfmHt42bvH5n-1KJw\" target=\"_blank\">@vxidnik</a>@<a href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/dashboard/blog/strangerthingsholland\" target=\"_blank\">strangerthingholland</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mY2iDPZFAYSCyrTHvpHNOmQ\" target=\"_blank\">@awkwxrdmarauders</a>@tovloveliampayne <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmBZJJPECktMOQurgslNATQ\" target=\"_blank\">@veggidinosaurnuggets</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBWKqX0a6Xkb1gctJJJDd1g\" target=\"_blank\">@-thatgirloverthere-</a>@<a href=\"http://shieldgallovershieldgallover.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">shieldgallover</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQcJ41Q73x6-KoyP-pxsiLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@starkbelova</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9cgOoG0Hpcm0odEGY0N9og\" target=\"_blank\">@lightbeautysblog</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mN3t6WpcWC8Luy-RdOQ5m1w\" target=\"_blank\">@sillyoldbeleh</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSjd3anGyRbLn0ViSUPR1bA\" target=\"_blank\">@emilielskov</a>@<a href=\"https://kayylluhh.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">kayylluhh</a>@<a href=\"https://honey-honey-boy.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">honey-honey-boy</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxYekjWCnH24z0QwoMRqFtg\" target=\"_blank\">@superbuckytrash</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkPX9bTS4_RT9JziquUBgpg\" target=\"_blank\">@camu-winchester</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mY4tTcT1E_AqqiXU7UO0rUQ\" target=\"_blank\">@roger-bang-the-drum</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWMLSsKXRwPp1UkfyaHeR2g\" target=\"_blank\">@rebel4fandom</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mg_AhM9FpeAUfhk1vcPXwQQ\" target=\"_blank\">@thegirlwithoutaname87</a>\u00a0@megafandomfangirl<br/></p>",

You needed a nap, you needed to actually see and verify your daughter was alright. </p><p>Jorah fell to the ground and the captor who assumed was also the captain of the ship turned to walk a little ways away.</p><p>\u201cSalt mines?\u201d He asked one of his men, standing by his side eyeing Jorah and then looking to your Uncle and to you before looking back at Jorah.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that or a galley slave.\u201d He confirmed \u201cHe looks strong enough.\u201d</p><p>The captor then looked to your uncle again and an unimpressed look crossed his face. Most people looked down upon dwarfs. Though, you never understood why. Tyrion was a very clever man.</p><p>\u201cWorthless.\u201d His comrade spoke. Your brows furrowed at his decision but you didn\u2019t argue. You didn\u2019t want to take any chances with him. He could decide to cut your tongue out if he found you to be too mouthy</p><p>\u201cCut his throat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!\u201d Tyrion repeated in a panic his hands going up defensively as you subconsciously positioned yourself to bolt up and attack if you needed to. You hadn\u2019t realized you\u2019d done it until one of the slavers came over and shoved you down onto the dirt.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s discuss this!\u201d Tyrion continued</p><p>\u201cAnd then chop off his cock. We\u2019ll sell it for a fortune. A Edward\u2019s cock has magic powers\u201d He stated.</p><p>What was it with these people. Did people east of Westerns just have a fascination with dwarfs? </p><p>The captor began to walk away to the boats, and the man he had been talking to took out his weapon and walked towards Tyrion</p><p>\u201cWait! Wait! Wait! You can\u2019t just hand a dry cock to a merchant and expect him to pay for it!\u201d</p><p>You had been pushed over next to Jorah back on your knees to be back in the original position you\u2019d been in. The man had brought his weapon to Tyrion\u2019s neck but seemed to be waiting for his commander\u2019s orders.</p><p>\u201cHe has to know it came from a dwarf! And how could he know unless he sees the dwarf?\u201d</p><p>Tyrion\u2019s head had been turned back to the man who\u2019s dagger was against his throat. The man using the sword to make him look back at him.</p><p>\u201cIt will be a dwarf-sized cock.\u201d He responded </p><p>\u201cGuess again.\u201d </p><p>Ew. Tyrion looked the man dead in the eye while you made a face. The slaver looked to the commander waiting for what he had to say. You could hear the sound of a canteen being plugged up again from behind you right before he spoke</p><p>\u201cThe dwarf lives until we find a cock merchant.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion let out an audible sigh of relief, that for the millionth time in his life has spared it.</p><p>\u201cWhat of the girl?\u201d The man asked walking over to you and lifting your chin with the dagger to look at him. You glared at him and let a huff out through your nose.</p><p>\u201cWhore house?\u201d He questioned</p><p>\u201cNo. She\u2019s had children. She\u2019ll go with the man.\u201d He stated </p><p>You turned your head to look at the commander as he eyed you up and down. \u201cHow would you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old are you?\u201d He asked</p><p>You didn\u2019t want to answer. But you knew you had to</p><p>\u201cEighteen. Almost nineteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo eighteen year old has the hips of a mother, unless they are a mother.\u201d You shrugged slightly and made an impressed face. He wasn\u2019t wrong. Before you\u2019d had Lucia your hips where slender, and maybe because of how small you were when you had her, only being 15 when you had fallen pregnant and 16 when you gave birth, your hips had widened noticeably. </p><p>One of the men picked you up by your upper arms and took you to one of the paddle boats pushing you to step into it. Carefully you stepped in and sat down messing with the extra length of rope around your wrists</p><p>\u201cQueen Daenerys has outlawed slavery.\u201d Jorah said almost like a demand</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re bound for Volantis, not Slaver\u2019s Bay. Besides, reopened the fighting pits. I\u2019ve never heard of free men fighting in the pits.\u201d The commander responded</p><p>\u201cI have.\u201d You interupted.</p><p>He looked at you and rose a brow at what you\u2019d said. You\u2019d only seen a fight in a pit once. And it wasn\u2019t pretty</p><p>\u201cIt was a trial.\u201d You responded. He only rolled his eyes and looked back at your uncle and Jorah </p><p>\u201cThe fighting pits in Meereen? You\u2019re in luck, then! You\u2019re about to be rich! You are looking at one of the great warriors in the seven kingdoms.\u201d Tyrion said. Jorah. Her Jorah Mormont of Bear Island. During this whole debacle you\u2019d forgotten that Jorah had once been a talented fighter.</p><p>\u201cHim? He\u2019s got to be sixty years old.\u201d He responded </p><p>\u201cSure, he\u2019s a bit long in the tooth, a bit withered, been in the sun too long.\u201d </p><p>You gave Tyrion a look, of all the things he could say he was choosing that? He was just confirming that fact that Jorah was an older man.</p><p>\u201cWe can all see that. But he is a veteran of 100 battles. They wrote songs about him!\u201d</p><p>The commander put his foot up on the bow of the boat and gestured for his men to bring Jorah closer</p><p>\u201cThat true?\u201d</p><p>Jorah just looked like he was struggling to nod before he was able to and once again Tyrion began to wiggle you all out of your deaths.</p><p>\u201cHe won the tournament at Lannisport. Unseating Ser Jaime Lannister himself.\u201d</p><p>The commander began laughing at Tyrion putting his foot down and standing up straight and Tyrion face dropped while you and Jorah looked on at the interaction you never thought you\u2019d see.</p><p>\u201cThe Kingslayer!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJousting. You\u2019re talking about jousting A fancy game for fancy lads. The men who fight in the pits of Merreen will swallow him whole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI killed a Dothraki bloodrider in single combat.\u201d </p><p>You looked to Jorah amazed. Cause if it was true, he had to be the best. The Dothraki were some of the fiercest fighters anyone\u2019s ever seen. </p><p>The commander got off of the boat you were sitting in and walked over to Jorah and stood less than a foot away from his face.</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no lie. His name was Qotho. He was bloodrider to Khal Drogo. Take me to Slaver\u2019s Bay, put a sword in my hand, I\u2019ll prove my worth.\u201d</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>\u201cThis one\u2019s a Westerosi knight\u201d </p><p>You closed your eyes as the chains put a weight on your wrists and your neck. Some men from Meereen standing in front in a small crowd, as the commander and Jorah stood on a pathetic looking wooden stage. The last time you saw a stage someone was killed.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s from an ancient house trained in sword and lance. He fought beside the stag King Robert \u00a0on the far side of the Narrow Sea. He was first through the breach during the Siege of Spike, slaughtering fifty men with his flaming sword. He killed the great Khal Drogo in single combat. Betrayed by his woman he sold himself into slavery to repay his debts. Biding begins at 12 gold honors.\u201d</p><p>The small crowd began murmuring as you and Tyrion stood side by side watching as the men in bright blue, green and white discussed it to themselves </p><p>\u201cTwenty\u201d One man offered taking out a bag of coins and throwing it to the commander who swiftly caught it and began pulling Jorah to the the man who you assumed was his new \u2018master\u2019\u201d</p><p>The man began to take Jorah away, dragging him by the chains he was attached to.</p><p>\u201cWait! You have to buy us as well!\u201d Tyrion yelled trying to run forward, the man behind you both grabbing onto his chain and yanking him back as best he could.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d The buyer asked shrugging his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all a team. She\u2019s a great fighter too.\u201d Tyrion said pointing to you. </p><p>Your eyes went wide as you glared at the top of his head your hands balling into fists. The crowd laughed. Yes, because how would a woman know how to fight?</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s funny. You have to give him that\u201d The commander said with a smile after he was done laughing himself.</p><p>Tyrion looked at you as the man kept trying to pull Tyrion\u2019s chain. And you decided to prove his point. With your quick movements you turned and grabbed Tyrion\u2019s chain yanking the man forward so hard he fell to the ground with a loud thud, you and Tyrion both began to hit him. Not that you wanted to hurt the poor boy. You just needed out so you could find Varys and Lucia.</p><p>The man smiled slightly with a hesitant nod as he walked forward to the commander once more and handed him more gold \u201cYou\u2019re right. He\u2019s funny.\u201d</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>They\u2019d given you your sword. The gave you armor for a man, not for a woman. The armor was that of what you\u2019d seen Ned wearing the day he was killed. Small plates of armor placed closely together and surrounded by leather to make it into a vest of sorts. You\u2019d put your hair up with a ribbon they\u2019d given you. Your golden hair coming down in waves, something Tyrion said looked like a waterfall as it was put in the ponytail.</p><p>You wore chainmail on your arms and had your sword sharpened by Jorah. Of course you\u2019d never been taught how to sharpen your own sword. But you held the golden hilt, thumb on the large jewel that sat on the rain-guard of the sword.</p><p>This sword would be used in battle today. A sword that had never seen it. Not once. And at a point in time it used to be part of a larger sword which saw many battles during Robert\u2019s Rebellion. A large sword that had been held by Ned Stark. And then once split into two, held by Joffrey Baratheon and Jaime Lannister. Then Joffrey died. And Jaime gave his sword to Brienne of Tarth. And Varys told the sword out of Joffrey\u2019s crypt for you. </p><p>You could hear the fighting of the first few who had gone out. The sound of steel hitting steel and the sound of men grunting as they were killed by their opponents. </p><p>You were snapped out of your thoughts when Jorah came running back from the entrance. He didn\u2019t speak a word, but he grabbed his sword and helmet. And you being how you were, grabbed your own as Tyrion asked what you were doing.</p><p>But you followed him. And when he opened the door to the fighting pits you followed him out. You could see the blood in the sand and the dead men laying on the ground in a pool of their own blood.</p><p>The man who had bought you three tried to stop you, grabbing unto the back of Jorah\u2019s vest, but you kept going. Walking towards the fight. You didn\u2019t want to die and you\u2019d been damned if you never saw your little girl because you died in a fighting pit. </p><p>What was it Arya had said? About what she said to the god of death every day?</p><p>Not Today.</p><p>You would remember that everyday. Every time you walked through he staircase you and Arya had made your escape from. The very staircase where she pointed her sword at you defensively. She was younger than you, and you had learned from her. </p><p>You had a grip on your sword as you went in helmet securely on your head as you went up to a man who was beating in the skull of another with a rock. With the flat of your sword you knocked him out, the amount of force creating an open wound on the side of his bald head. </p><p>You could hear people react to what you had done, but you couldn\u2019t hear it. All you could hear was the small voice of the little girl you\u2019d given birth to. You\u2019d followed Jorah blindly the past four weeks. You hadn\u2019t seen Lucia in a month and you\u2019d never been parted from her for longer than an hour before. </p><p>You could hear Jorah behind you taking out a few opponents of his own as he came across them. And it was then you heard the gate opening and closing again. You knew more fighters from inside the tunnel had come out. You two had more competition but you could handle it, you knew you could.</p><p>Grabbing the back of one of the men\u2019s vests, you pulled him back and pulled his arm over your should with so much force you could hear the sound of his shoulder dislocating and his forearm breaking in half.</p><p>Jorah had taken on a man who had a wreaking ball easily, and then took on another, as did you. You avoided killing any of them. You refused to. This wasn\u2019t life or death. They weren\u2019t the type to get up after being bested by a woman.</p><p>However you had gotten pulled back this time. A man holding a dagger to your throat. You had moved instinctively and his blade had been shoved up to your face and dug into your jaw and went diagonally to your ear. </p><p>You could feel the blood start to run down your cheek, but the adrenaline had stifled the pain of the large, deep cut. You turned and again with the flat of your sword hit him upside the head knocking him clean out</p><p>Looking around, everyone was down on the ground. The ones you and Jorah had taken, still alive and breathing, but not dead. Severely injured, but not dead.</p><p>You looked at Jorah as walked forward to the platform for a woman stood. Her dress was a smooth white fabric, a cape around her shoulders and showing off a nice medal chest piece which was attached to her cape. It was in the shape of two dragon wings, and three dragon heads protruding from the center. She had long silver hair that was done up in an extravagant style, something you\u2019d never seen in King\u2019s Landing.</p><p>Daenerys Targaryen.</p><p>You slowly approached her, only a few feet behind Jorah as the unsullied by her side held up their spears and got closer with their shields up closer.</p><p>Jorah removed his helmet to reveal to her his face to her. You left yours on. She wouldn\u2019t recognize you. All she\u2019d see was a small golden haired girl who was shorter than herself. A small golden haired girl who apparently had the hips of a mother.</p><p>Daenerys\u2019s face softened as she looked at him, and then once again harden. Just as fast as it had softened </p><p>\u201cGet him out of my sight.\u201d</p><p>Jorah looked like he was about to start begging her. And he did. His head held high as looked up to her </p><p>\u201cKhaleesi, please. I just need a moment of your time.\u201d</p><p>Two guards grabbed onto Jorah\u2019s arms and they pushed you aside as if you were another object. In the way</p><p>\u201cI brought you a gift!\u201d Jorah yelled out as the guards where taking him away. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true!\u201d</p><p>Tyrion had walked out, the chains that had attached him to the wall\u2026 Still attached to his wrists, but not to the wall. Someone had broken him free from staying by the wall.</p><p>The mother of dragons looked over to see the dwarf Lannister walking behind Jorah and next to you.</p><p>\u201cHe has.\u201d You finished </p><p>\u201cAnd who are you\u201d She asked her dark brows furrowing in confusion, anger and frustration. </p><p>\u201cWe are the gift.\u201d Tyrion responded holding up his chains for her to see. She still looked confused as she looked from your uncle to you and back and forth in a cycle.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, Your Grace.\u201d You greeted with a warm smile. And a nod.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Y/N Baratheon, he is Tyrion Lannister\u201d</p><p><br></p><hr><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@disneyprincessbuffyannesummers</a>@siennarothenburg <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m57PumL3XTHKMbhaLBCDM6Q\" target=\"_blank\">@nighthood13</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzBlNV0PDM4SXm6Ym1PSJAw\" target=\"_blank\">@cevanstann</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/majsdnQ_JnelNmwA-W4FunA\" target=\"_blank\">@boredbrit</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mA_-qHoQbaPG0d8C94bexmA\" target=\"_blank\">@celestial-melancholy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrQghx2HTRQWATopqUw0s2w\" target=\"_blank\">@qhbr2013</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAeRnp4q0NBV8t7q1b6qpVw\" target=\"_blank\">@falling-stars-never-cry</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ms0BdTYfmHt42bvH5n-1KJw\" target=\"_blank\">@vxidnik</a>@<a href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/dashboard/blog/strangerthingsholland\" target=\"_blank\">strangerthingholland</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mY2iDPZFAYSCyrTHvpHNOmQ\" target=\"_blank\">@awkwxrdmarauders</a>@tovloveliampayne <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmBZJJPECktMOQurgslNATQ\" target=\"_blank\">@veggidinosaurnuggets</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBWKqX0a6Xkb1gctJJJDd1g\" target=\"_blank\">@-thatgirloverthere-</a>@<a href=\"http://shieldgallovershieldgallover.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">shieldgallover</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQcJ41Q73x6-KoyP-pxsiLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@starkbelova</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9cgOoG0Hpcm0odEGY0N9og\" target=\"_blank\">@lightbeautysblog</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mN3t6WpcWC8Luy-RdOQ5m1w\" target=\"_blank\">@sillyoldbeleh</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSjd3anGyRbLn0ViSUPR1bA\" target=\"_blank\">@emilielskov</a>@<a href=\"https://kayylluhh.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">kayylluhh</a>@<a href=\"https://honey-honey-boy.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">honey-honey-boy</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxYekjWCnH24z0QwoMRqFtg\" target=\"_blank\">@superbuckytrash</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkPX9bTS4_RT9JziquUBgpg\" target=\"_blank\">@camu-winchester</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mY4tTcT1E_AqqiXU7UO0rUQ\" target=\"_blank\">@roger-bang-the-drum</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWMLSsKXRwPp1UkfyaHeR2g\" target=\"_blank\">@rebel4fandom</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mg_AhM9FpeAUfhk1vcPXwQQ\" target=\"_blank\">@thegirlwithoutaname87</a>\u00a0@megafandomfangirl<br></p></p>",

No doubt there was a ship there, but how could he tell it was a slave ship.</p><p>\u201cWhy are the anchored?\u201d You asked looking to the older man.</p><p>His eyes were watching the ship intently as it just floated there in the water like all ships do.</p><p>\u201cThey probably came ashore for\u2014\u201c</p><p>You heard a sword scraping against the metal lips of it\u2019s sheath as it was drawn \u201cWater.\u201d A man finished in a deep voice. His accent was thick and heavy, one you\u2019d never heard before. You grabbed onto your dress, almost subconsciously trying to pull it closer to yourself.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Turning your head you saw a group of five men holding their sword like weapons. To short to be a sword. To long to be a dagger. </p><p>You stood along with Jorah and looked at them. You\u2019d never seen people like them before. So much cloth and utilities around their waist attached to their belt. If you didn\u2019t know any better, you\u2019d say they were pirates. Well\u2026 Slavers and Pirates were\u2026 similar in some ways.</p><p>They\u2019d taken you to the shore, where their boats sat that would take them back to the ship. You sat on your knees next to Tyrion and Jorah. In a line of sorts.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>\u201cGot a lot of fight in you, huh?\u201d</p><p>You let out a angered huff as the captor hit Jorah once more.

Wait!\u201d Tyrion repeated in a panic his hands going up defensively as you subconsciously positioned yourself to bolt up and attack if you needed to. You hadn\u2019t realized you\u2019d done it until one of the slavers came over and shoved you down onto the dirt.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s discuss this!\u201d Tyrion continued</p><p>\u201cAnd then chop off his cock. We\u2019ll sell it for a fortune. A Edward\u2019s cock has magic powers\u201d He stated.</p><p>What was it with these people. Did people east of Westerns just have a fascination with dwarfs? </p><p>The captor began to walk away to the boats, and the man he had been talking to took out his weapon and walked towards Tyrion</p><p>\u201cWait! Wait! Wait! You can\u2019t just hand a dry cock to a merchant and expect him to pay for it!\u201d</p><p>You had been pushed over next to Jorah back on your knees to be back in the original position you\u2019d been in. The man had brought his weapon to Tyrion\u2019s neck but seemed to be waiting for his commander\u2019s orders.</p><p>\u201cHe has to know it came from a dwarf! And how could he know unless he sees the dwarf?\u201d</p><p>Tyrion\u2019s head had been turned back to the man who\u2019s dagger was against his throat. The man using the sword to make him look back at him.</p><p>\u201cIt will be a dwarf-sized cock.\u201d He responded </p><p>\u201cGuess again.\u201d </p><p>Ew. Tyrion looked the man dead in the eye while you made a face. The slaver looked to the commander waiting for what he had to say. You could hear the sound of a canteen being plugged up again from behind you right before he spoke</p><p>\u201cThe dwarf lives until we find a cock merchant.\u201d</p><p>Tyrion let out an audible sigh of relief, that for the millionth time in his life has spared it.</p><p>\u201cWhat of the girl?\u201d The man asked walking over to you and lifting your chin with the dagger to look at him. You glared at him and let a huff out through your nose.</p><p>\u201cWhore house?\u201d He questioned</p><p>\u201cNo. She\u2019s had children. She\u2019ll go with the man.\u201d He stated </p><p>You turned your head to look at the commander as he eyed you up and down. \u201cHow would you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old are you?\u201d He asked</p><p>You didn\u2019t want to answer. But you knew you had to</p><p>\u201cEighteen. Almost nineteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo eighteen year old has the hips of a mother, unless they are a mother.\u201d You shrugged slightly and made an impressed face. He wasn\u2019t wrong. Before you\u2019d had Lucia your hips where slender, and maybe because of how small you were when you had her, only being 15 when you had fallen pregnant and 16 when you gave birth, your hips had widened noticeably. </p><p>One of the men picked you up by your upper arms and took you to one of the paddle boats pushing you to step into it. Carefully you stepped in and sat down messing with the extra length of rope around your wrists</p><p>\u201cQueen Daenerys has outlawed slavery.\u201d Jorah said almost like a demand</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re bound for Volantis, not Slaver\u2019s Bay. Besides, reopened the fighting pits. I\u2019ve never heard of free men fighting in the pits.\u201d The commander responded</p><p>\u201cI have.\u201d You interupted.</p><p>He looked at you and rose a brow at what you\u2019d said. You\u2019d only seen a fight in a pit once. And it wasn\u2019t pretty</p><p>\u201cIt was a trial.\u201d You responded. He only rolled his eyes and looked back at your uncle and Jorah </p><p>\u201cThe fighting pits in Meereen? You\u2019re in luck, then! You\u2019re about to be rich! You are looking at one of the great warriors in the seven kingdoms.\u201d Tyrion said. Jorah. Her Jorah Mormont of Bear Island. During this whole debacle you\u2019d forgotten that Jorah had once been a talented fighter.</p><p>\u201cHim? He\u2019s got to be sixty years old.\u201d He responded </p><p>\u201cSure, he\u2019s a bit long in the tooth, a bit withered, been in the sun too long.\u201d </p><p>You gave Tyrion a look, of all the things he could say he was choosing that? He was just confirming that fact that Jorah was an older man.</p><p>\u201cWe can all see that. But he is a veteran of 100 battles. They wrote songs about him!\u201d</p><p>The commander put his foot up on the bow of the boat and gestured for his men to bring Jorah closer</p><p>\u201cThat true?\u201d</p><p>Jorah just looked like he was struggling to nod before he was able to and once again Tyrion began to wiggle you all out of your deaths.</p><p>\u201cHe won the tournament at Lannisport. Unseating Ser Jaime Lannister himself.\u201d</p><p>The commander began laughing at Tyrion putting his foot down and standing up straight and Tyrion face dropped while you and Jorah looked on at the interaction you never thought you\u2019d see.</p><p>\u201cThe Kingslayer!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJousting. You\u2019re talking about jousting A fancy game for fancy lads. The men who fight in the pits of Merreen will swallow him whole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI killed a Dothraki bloodrider in single combat.\u201d </p><p>You looked to Jorah amazed. Cause if it was true, he had to be the best. The Dothraki were some of the fiercest fighters anyone\u2019s ever seen. </p><p>The commander got off of the boat you were sitting in and walked over to Jorah and stood less than a foot away from his face.</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no lie. His name was Qotho. He was bloodrider to Khal Drogo. Take me to Slaver\u2019s Bay, put a sword in my hand, I\u2019ll prove my worth.\u201d</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>\u201cThis one\u2019s a Westerosi knight\u201d </p><p>You closed your eyes as the chains put a weight on your wrists and your neck. Some men from Meereen standing in front in a small crowd, as the commander and Jorah stood on a pathetic looking wooden stage. The last time you saw a stage someone was killed.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s from an ancient house trained in sword and lance. He fought beside the stag King Robert \u00a0on the far side of the Narrow Sea. He was first through the breach during the Siege of Spike, slaughtering fifty men with his flaming sword. He killed the great Khal Drogo in single combat. Betrayed by his woman he sold himself into slavery to repay his debts. Biding begins at 12 gold honors.\u201d</p><p>The small crowd began murmuring as you and Tyrion stood side by side watching as the men in bright blue, green and white discussed it to themselves </p><p>\u201cTwenty\u201d One man offered taking out a bag of coins and throwing it to the commander who swiftly caught it and began pulling Jorah to the the man who you assumed was his new \u2018master\u2019\u201d</p><p>The man began to take Jorah away, dragging him by the chains he was attached to.</p><p>\u201cWait! You have to buy us as well!\u201d Tyrion yelled trying to run forward, the man behind you both grabbing onto his chain and yanking him back as best he could.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d The buyer asked shrugging his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all a team. She\u2019s a great fighter too.\u201d Tyrion said pointing to you. </p><p>Your eyes went wide as you glared at the top of his head your hands balling into fists. The crowd laughed. Yes, because how would a woman know how to fight?</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s funny. You have to give him that\u201d The commander said with a smile after he was done laughing himself.</p><p>Tyrion looked at you as the man kept trying to pull Tyrion\u2019s chain. And you decided to prove his point. With your quick movements you turned and grabbed Tyrion\u2019s chain yanking the man forward so hard he fell to the ground with a loud thud, you and Tyrion both began to hit him. Not that you wanted to hurt the poor boy. You just needed out so you could find Varys and Lucia.</p><p>The man smiled slightly with a hesitant nod as he walked forward to the commander once more and handed him more gold \u201cYou\u2019re right. He\u2019s funny.\u201d</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>They\u2019d given you your sword. The gave you armor for a man, not for a woman. The armor was that of what you\u2019d seen Ned wearing the day he was killed. Small plates of armor placed closely together and surrounded by leather to make it into a vest of sorts. You\u2019d put your hair up with a ribbon they\u2019d given you. Your golden hair coming down in waves, something Tyrion said looked like a waterfall as it was put in the ponytail.</p><p>You wore chainmail on your arms and had your sword sharpened by Jorah. Of course you\u2019d never been taught how to sharpen your own sword. But you held the golden hilt, thumb on the large jewel that sat on the rain-guard of the sword.</p><p>This sword would be used in battle today. A sword that had never seen it. Not once. And at a point in time it used to be part of a larger sword which saw many battles during Robert\u2019s Rebellion. A large sword that had been held by Ned Stark. And then once split into two, held by Joffrey Baratheon and Jaime Lannister. Then Joffrey died. And Jaime gave his sword to Brienne of Tarth. And Varys told the sword out of Joffrey\u2019s crypt for you. </p><p>You could hear the fighting of the first few who had gone out. The sound of steel hitting steel and the sound of men grunting as they were killed by their opponents. </p><p>You were snapped out of your thoughts when Jorah came running back from the entrance. He didn\u2019t speak a word, but he grabbed his sword and helmet. And you being how you were, grabbed your own as Tyrion asked what you were doing.</p><p>But you followed him. And when he opened the door to the fighting pits you followed him out. You could see the blood in the sand and the dead men laying on the ground in a pool of their own blood.</p><p>The man who had bought you three tried to stop you, grabbing unto the back of Jorah\u2019s vest, but you kept going. Walking towards the fight. You didn\u2019t want to die and you\u2019d been damned if you never saw your little girl because you died in a fighting pit. </p><p>What was it Arya had said? About what she said to the god of death every day?</p><p>Not Today.</p><p>You would remember that everyday. Every time you walked through he staircase you and Arya had made your escape from. The very staircase where she pointed her sword at you defensively. She was younger than you, and you had learned from her. </p><p>You had a grip on your sword as you went in helmet securely on your head as you went up to a man who was beating in the skull of another with a rock. With the flat of your sword you knocked him out, the amount of force creating an open wound on the side of his bald head. </p><p>You could hear people react to what you had done, but you couldn\u2019t hear it. All you could hear was the small voice of the little girl you\u2019d given birth to. You\u2019d followed Jorah blindly the past four weeks. You hadn\u2019t seen Lucia in a month and you\u2019d never been parted from her for longer than an hour before. </p><p>You could hear Jorah behind you taking out a few opponents of his own as he came across them. And it was then you heard the gate opening and closing again. You knew more fighters from inside the tunnel had come out. You two had more competition but you could handle it, you knew you could.</p><p>Grabbing the back of one of the men\u2019s vests, you pulled him back and pulled his arm over your should with so much force you could hear the sound of his shoulder dislocating and his forearm breaking in half.</p><p>Jorah had taken on a man who had a wreaking ball easily, and then took on another, as did you. You avoided killing any of them. You refused to. This wasn\u2019t life or death. They weren\u2019t the type to get up after being bested by a woman.</p><p>However you had gotten pulled back this time. A man holding a dagger to your throat. You had moved instinctively and his blade had been shoved up to your face and dug into your jaw and went diagonally to your ear. </p><p>You could feel the blood start to run down your cheek, but the adrenaline had stifled the pain of the large, deep cut. You turned and again with the flat of your sword hit him upside the head knocking him clean out</p><p>Looking around, everyone was down on the ground. The ones you and Jorah had taken, still alive and breathing, but not dead. Severely injured, but not dead.</p><p>You looked at Jorah as walked forward to the platform for a woman stood. Her dress was a smooth white fabric, a cape around her shoulders and showing off a nice medal chest piece which was attached to her cape. It was in the shape of two dragon wings, and three dragon heads protruding from the center. She had long silver hair that was done up in an extravagant style, something you\u2019d never seen in King\u2019s Landing.</p><p>Daenerys Targaryen.</p><p>You slowly approached her, only a few feet behind Jorah as the unsullied by her side held up their spears and got closer with their shields up closer.</p><p>Jorah removed his helmet to reveal to her his face to her. You left yours on. She wouldn\u2019t recognize you. All she\u2019d see was a small golden haired girl who was shorter than herself. A small golden haired girl who apparently had the hips of a mother.</p><p>Daenerys\u2019s face softened as she looked at him, and then once again harden. Just as fast as it had softened </p><p>\u201cGet him out of my sight.\u201d</p><p>Jorah looked like he was about to start begging her. And he did. His head held high as looked up to her </p><p>\u201cKhaleesi, please. I just need a moment of your time.\u201d</p><p>Two guards grabbed onto Jorah\u2019s arms and they pushed you aside as if you were another object. In the way</p><p>\u201cI brought you a gift!\u201d Jorah yelled out as the guards where taking him away. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true!\u201d</p><p>Tyrion had walked out, the chains that had attached him to the wall\u2026 Still attached to his wrists, but not to the wall. Someone had broken him free from staying by the wall.</p><p>The mother of dragons looked over to see the dwarf Lannister walking behind Jorah and next to you.</p><p>\u201cHe has.\u201d You finished </p><p>\u201cAnd who are you\u201d She asked her dark brows furrowing in confusion, anger and frustration. </p><p>\u201cWe are the gift.\u201d Tyrion responded holding up his chains for her to see. She still looked confused as she looked from your uncle to you and back and forth in a cycle.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, Your Grace.\u201d You greeted with a warm smile. And a nod.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Y/N Baratheon, he is Tyrion Lannister\u201d</p><p><br></p><hr><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@disneyprincessbuffyannesummers</a>@siennarothenburg <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m57PumL3XTHKMbhaLBCDM6Q\" target=\"_blank\">@nighthood13</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzBlNV0PDM4SXm6Ym1PSJAw\" target=\"_blank\">@cevanstann</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/majsdnQ_JnelNmwA-W4FunA\" target=\"_blank\">@boredbrit</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mA_-qHoQbaPG0d8C94bexmA\" target=\"_blank\">@celestial-melancholy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrQghx2HTRQWATopqUw0s2w\" target=\"_blank\">@qhbr2013</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAeRnp4q0NBV8t7q1b6qpVw\" target=\"_blank\">@falling-stars-never-cry</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ms0BdTYfmHt42bvH5n-1KJw\" target=\"_blank\">@vxidnik</a>@<a href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/dashboard/blog/strangerthingsholland\" target=\"_blank\">strangerthingholland</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mY2iDPZFAYSCyrTHvpHNOmQ\" target=\"_blank\">@awkwxrdmarauders</a>@tovloveliampayne <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmBZJJPECktMOQurgslNATQ\" target=\"_blank\">@veggidinosaurnuggets</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBWKqX0a6Xkb1gctJJJDd1g\" target=\"_blank\">@-thatgirloverthere-</a>@<a href=\"http://shieldgallovershieldgallover.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">shieldgallover</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQcJ41Q73x6-KoyP-pxsiLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@starkbelova</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9cgOoG0Hpcm0odEGY0N9og\" target=\"_blank\">@lightbeautysblog</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mN3t6WpcWC8Luy-RdOQ5m1w\" target=\"_blank\">@sillyoldbeleh</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSjd3anGyRbLn0ViSUPR1bA\" target=\"_blank\">@emilielskov</a>@<a href=\"https://kayylluhh.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">kayylluhh</a>@<a href=\"https://honey-honey-boy.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">honey-honey-boy</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxYekjWCnH24z0QwoMRqFtg\" target=\"_blank\">@superbuckytrash</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkPX9bTS4_RT9JziquUBgpg\" target=\"_blank\">@camu-winchester</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mY4tTcT1E_AqqiXU7UO0rUQ\" target=\"_blank\">@roger-bang-the-drum</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWMLSsKXRwPp1UkfyaHeR2g\" target=\"_blank\">@rebel4fandom</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mg_AhM9FpeAUfhk1vcPXwQQ\" target=\"_blank\">@thegirlwithoutaname87</a>\u00a0@megafandomfangirl<br></p></p>",

And you went down with an audible thud.</p><p>&ldquo;A slave ship.&rdquo; Jorah pointed out to an empty space of water near by. No doubt there was a ship there, but how could he tell it was a slave ship.</p><p>&ldquo;Why are the anchored?&rdquo; You asked looking to the older man.</p><p>His eyes were watching the ship intently as it just floated there in the water like all ships do.</p><p>&ldquo;They probably came ashore for&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p>You heard a sword scraping against the metal lips of it&rsquo;s sheath as it was drawn &ldquo;Water.&rdquo; A man finished in a deep voice. His accent was thick and heavy, one you&rsquo;d never heard before. You grabbed onto your dress, almost subconsciously trying to pull it closer to yourself.</p><p>Turning your head you saw a group of five men holding their sword like weapons. To short to be a sword. To long to be a dagger. </p><p>You stood along with Jorah and looked at them. You&rsquo;d never seen people like them before. So much cloth and utilities around their waist attached to their belt. If you didn&rsquo;t know any better, you&rsquo;d say they were pirates. Well&hellip; Slavers and Pirates were&hellip; similar in some ways.</p><p>They&rsquo;d taken you to the shore, where their boats sat that would take them back to the ship. You sat on your knees next to Tyrion and Jorah. In a line of sorts.</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Got a lot of fight in you, huh?&rdquo;</p><p>You let out a angered huff as the captor hit Jorah once more. This trip was turning more and more into an adventure. You needed a nap, you needed to actually see and verify your daughter was alright. </p><p>Jorah fell to the ground and the captor who assumed was also the captain of the ship turned to walk a little ways away.</p><p>&ldquo;Salt mines?&rdquo; He asked one of his men, standing by his side eyeing Jorah and then looking to your Uncle and to you before looking back at Jorah.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, that or a galley slave.&rdquo; He confirmed &ldquo;He looks strong enough.&rdquo;</p><p>The captor then looked to your uncle again and an unimpressed look crossed his face. Most people looked down upon dwarfs. Though, you never understood why. Tyrion was a very clever man.</p><p>&ldquo;Worthless.&rdquo; His comrade spoke. Your brows furrowed at his decision but you didn&rsquo;t argue. You didn&rsquo;t want to take any chances with him. He could decide to cut your tongue out if he found you to be too mouthy</p><p>&ldquo;Cut his throat.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!&rdquo; Tyrion repeated in a panic his hands going up defensively as you subconsciously positioned yourself to bolt up and attack if you needed to. You hadn&rsquo;t realized you&rsquo;d done it until one of the slavers came over and shoved you down onto the dirt.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s discuss this!&rdquo; Tyrion continued</p><p>&ldquo;And then chop off his cock. We&rsquo;ll sell it for a fortune. A Edward&rsquo;s cock has magic powers&rdquo; He stated.</p><p>What was it with these people. Did people east of Westerns just have a fascination with dwarfs? </p><p>The captor began to walk away to the boats, and the man he had been talking to took out his weapon and walked towards Tyrion</p><p>&ldquo;Wait! Wait! Wait! You can&rsquo;t just hand a dry cock to a merchant and expect him to pay for it!&rdquo;</p><p>You had been pushed over next to Jorah back on your knees to be back in the original position you&rsquo;d been in. The man had brought his weapon to Tyrion&rsquo;s neck but seemed to be waiting for his commander&rsquo;s orders.</p><p>&ldquo;He has to know it came from a dwarf!

You glared at him and let a huff out through your nose.</p><p>&ldquo;Whore house?&rdquo; He questioned</p><p>&ldquo;No. She&rsquo;s had children. She&rsquo;ll go with the man.&rdquo; He stated </p><p>You turned your head to look at the commander as he eyed you up and down. &ldquo;How would you know that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo; He asked</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t want to answer.

He fought beside the stag King Robert &nbsp;on the far side of the Narrow Sea. He was first through the breach during the Siege of Spike, slaughtering fifty men with his flaming sword. He killed the great Khal Drogo in single combat. Betrayed by his woman he sold himself into slavery to repay his debts. Biding begins at 12 gold honors.&rdquo;</p><p>The small crowd began murmuring as you and Tyrion stood side by side watching as the men in bright blue, green and white discussed it to themselves </p><p>&ldquo;Twenty&rdquo; One man offered taking out a bag of coins and throwing it to the commander who swiftly caught it and began pulling Jorah to the the man who you assumed was his new &lsquo;master&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>The man began to take Jorah away, dragging him by the chains he was attached to.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait! You have to buy us as well!&rdquo; Tyrion yelled trying to run forward, the man behind you both grabbing onto his chain and yanking him back as best he could.</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; The buyer asked shrugging his shoulders.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all a team. She&rsquo;s a great fighter too.&rdquo; Tyrion said pointing to you. </p><p>Your eyes went wide as you glared at the top of his head your hands balling into fists. The crowd laughed. Yes, because how would a woman know how to fight?</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s funny. You have to give him that&rdquo; The commander said with a smile after he was done laughing himself.</p><p>Tyrion looked at you as the man kept trying to pull Tyrion&rsquo;s chain. And you decided to prove his point. With your quick movements you turned and grabbed Tyrion&rsquo;s chain yanking the man forward so hard he fell to the ground with a loud thud, you and Tyrion both began to hit him. Not that you wanted to hurt the poor boy. You just needed out so you could find Varys and Lucia.</p><p>The man smiled slightly with a hesitant nod as he walked forward to the commander once more and handed him more gold &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. He&rsquo;s funny.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p>They&rsquo;d given you your sword. The gave you armor for a man, not for a woman. The armor was that of what you&rsquo;d seen Ned wearing the day he was killed. Small plates of armor placed closely together and surrounded by leather to make it into a vest of sorts. You&rsquo;d put your hair up with a ribbon they&rsquo;d given you. Your golden hair coming down in waves, something Tyrion said looked like a waterfall as it was put in the ponytail.</p><p>You wore chainmail on your arms and had your sword sharpened by Jorah. Of course you&rsquo;d never been taught how to sharpen your own sword. But you held the golden hilt, thumb on the large jewel that sat on the rain-guard of the sword.</p><p>This sword would be used in battle today. A sword that had never seen it. Not once. And at a point in time it used to be part of a larger sword which saw many battles during Robert&rsquo;s Rebellion. A large sword that had been held by Ned Stark. And then once split into two, held by Joffrey Baratheon and Jaime Lannister. Then Joffrey died. And Jaime gave his sword to Brienne of Tarth. And Varys told the sword out of Joffrey&rsquo;s crypt for you. </p><p>You could hear the fighting of the first few who had gone out. The sound of steel hitting steel and the sound of men grunting as they were killed by their opponents. </p><p>You were snapped out of your thoughts when Jorah came running back from the entrance. He didn&rsquo;t speak a word, but he grabbed his sword and helmet. And you being how you were, grabbed your own as Tyrion asked what you were doing.</p><p>But you followed him. And when he opened the door to the fighting pits you followed him out. You could see the blood in the sand and the dead men laying on the ground in a pool of their own blood.</p><p>The man who had bought you three tried to stop you, grabbing unto the back of Jorah&rsquo;s vest, but you kept going. Walking towards the fight. You didn&rsquo;t want to die and you&rsquo;d been damned if you never saw your little girl because you died in a fighting pit. </p><p>What was it Arya had said? About what she said to the god of death every day?</p><p>Not Today.</p><p>You would remember that everyday. Every time you walked through he staircase you and Arya had made your escape from. The very staircase where she pointed her sword at you defensively. She was younger than you, and you had learned from her. </p><p>You had a grip on your sword as you went in helmet securely on your head as you went up to a man who was beating in the skull of another with a rock. With the flat of your sword you knocked him out, the amount of force creating an open wound on the side of his bald head. </p><p>You could hear people react to what you had done, but you couldn&rsquo;t hear it. All you could hear was the small voice of the little girl you&rsquo;d given birth to. You&rsquo;d followed Jorah blindly the past four weeks. You hadn&rsquo;t seen Lucia in a month and you&rsquo;d never been parted from her for longer than an hour before. </p><p>You could hear Jorah behind you taking out a few opponents of his own as he came across them. And it was then you heard the gate opening and closing again. You knew more fighters from inside the tunnel had come out. You two had more competition but you could handle it, you knew you could.</p><p>Grabbing the back of one of the men&rsquo;s vests, you pulled him back and pulled his arm over your should with so much force you could hear the sound of his shoulder dislocating and his forearm breaking in half.</p><p>Jorah had taken on a man who had a wreaking ball easily, and then took on another, as did you. You avoided killing any of them. You refused to. This wasn&rsquo;t life or death. They weren&rsquo;t the type to get up after being bested by a woman.</p><p>However you had gotten pulled back this time. A man holding a dagger to your throat. You had moved instinctively and his blade had been shoved up to your face and dug into your jaw and went diagonally to your ear. </p><p>You could feel the blood start to run down your cheek, but the adrenaline had stifled the pain of the large, deep cut. You turned and again with the flat of your sword hit him upside the head knocking him clean out</p><p>Looking around, everyone was down on the ground. The ones you and Jorah had taken, still alive and breathing, but not dead. Severely injured, but not dead.</p><p>You looked at Jorah as walked forward to the platform for a woman stood. Her dress was a smooth white fabric, a cape around her shoulders and showing off a nice medal chest piece which was attached to her cape. It was in the shape of two dragon wings, and three dragon heads protruding from the center. She had long silver hair that was done up in an extravagant style, something you&rsquo;d never seen in King&rsquo;s Landing.</p><p>Daenerys Targaryen.</p><p>You slowly approached her, only a few feet behind Jorah as the unsullied by her side held up their spears and got closer with their shields up closer.</p><p>Jorah removed his helmet to reveal to her his face to her. You left yours on. She wouldn&rsquo;t recognize you. All she&rsquo;d see was a small golden haired girl who was shorter than herself. A small golden haired girl who apparently had the hips of a mother.</p><p>Daenerys&rsquo;s face softened as she looked at him, and then once again harden. Just as fast as it had softened </p><p>&ldquo;Get him out of my sight.&rdquo;</p><p>Jorah looked like he was about to start begging her. And he did. His head held high as looked up to her </p><p>&ldquo;Khaleesi, please. I just need a moment of your time.&rdquo;</p><p>Two guards grabbed onto Jorah&rsquo;s arms and they pushed you aside as if you were another object. In the way</p><p>&ldquo;I brought you a gift!&rdquo; Jorah yelled out as the guards where taking him away. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true!&rdquo;</p><p>Tyrion had walked out, the chains that had attached him to the wall&hellip; Still attached to his wrists, but not to the wall. Someone had broken him free from staying by the wall.</p><p>The mother of dragons looked over to see the dwarf Lannister walking behind Jorah and next to you.</p><p>&ldquo;He has.&rdquo; You finished </p><p>&ldquo;And who are you&rdquo; She asked her dark brows furrowing in confusion, anger and frustration. </p><p>&ldquo;We are the gift.&rdquo; Tyrion responded holding up his chains for her to see. She still looked confused as she looked from your uncle to you and back and forth in a cycle.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pleasure to meet you, Your Grace.&rdquo; You greeted with a warm smile. And a nod.</p><p>&ldquo;My name is Y/N Baratheon, he is Tyrion Lannister&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@disneyprincessbuffyannesummers</a>@siennarothenburg <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m57PumL3XTHKMbhaLBCDM6Q\" target=\"_blank\">@nighthood13</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzBlNV0PDM4SXm6Ym1PSJAw\" target=\"_blank\">@cevanstann</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/majsdnQ_JnelNmwA-W4FunA\" target=\"_blank\">@boredbrit</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mA_-qHoQbaPG0d8C94bexmA\" target=\"_blank\">@celestial-melancholy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrQghx2HTRQWATopqUw0s2w\" target=\"_blank\">@qhbr2013</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAeRnp4q0NBV8t7q1b6qpVw\" target=\"_blank\">@falling-stars-never-cry</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ms0BdTYfmHt42bvH5n-1KJw\" target=\"_blank\">@vxidnik</a>@<a href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/dashboard/blog/strangerthingsholland\" target=\"_blank\">strangerthingholland</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mY2iDPZFAYSCyrTHvpHNOmQ\" target=\"_blank\">@awkwxrdmarauders</a>@tovloveliampayne <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmBZJJPECktMOQurgslNATQ\" target=\"_blank\">@veggidinosaurnuggets</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBWKqX0a6Xkb1gctJJJDd1g\" target=\"_blank\">@-thatgirloverthere-</a>@<a href=\"http://shieldgallovershieldgallover.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">shieldgallover</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQcJ41Q73x6-KoyP-pxsiLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@starkbelova</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9cgOoG0Hpcm0odEGY0N9og\" target=\"_blank\">@lightbeautysblog</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mN3t6WpcWC8Luy-RdOQ5m1w\" target=\"_blank\">@sillyoldbeleh</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSjd3anGyRbLn0ViSUPR1bA\" target=\"_blank\">@emilielskov</a>@<a href=\"https://kayylluhh.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">kayylluhh</a>@<a href=\"https://honey-honey-boy.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">honey-honey-boy</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mxYekjWCnH24z0QwoMRqFtg\" target=\"_blank\">@superbuckytrash</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkPX9bTS4_RT9JziquUBgpg\" target=\"_blank\">@camu-winchester</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mY4tTcT1E_AqqiXU7UO0rUQ\" target=\"_blank\">@roger-bang-the-drum</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWMLSsKXRwPp1UkfyaHeR2g\" target=\"_blank\">@rebel4fandom</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mg_AhM9FpeAUfhk1vcPXwQQ\" target=\"_blank\">@thegirlwithoutaname87</a>&nbsp;@megafandomfangirl<br /></p></p>",
