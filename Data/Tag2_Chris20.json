You glanced at him over your laptop screen, noticing how oblivious he was.</p><p>You tried to ignore him, you had deadlines to meet and he was serving as a serious distraction. Since he\u2019d finished filming <i>End Game</i>, he had decided to take time off work to regroup and figure out the rest of his career trajectory. This was only day four that he\u2019d been back home. You\u2019d left for work in the morning, agreeing to meet for dinner later but he\u2019d turned up to your studio with Dodger in tow, which to be fair was a nice surprise and a welcomed sight.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, could your t-shirt get any tighter?\u201d you teased him as he hugged you.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just showing off in front of Nora,\u201d he said, waving to her in her corner of the studio space. \u201cThis is your favourite t-shirt,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have plenty of spares,\u201d you gestured to your rails, set up and ready for your two clients whom you were fitting that afternoon for their upcoming press events.</p><p>\u201cFunny, I could always take it off if you prefer,\u201d</p><p>\u201cBehave,\u201d you scolded. \u201cSit in one place today please, and don\u2019t touch anything,\u201d</p><p>That had lasted over thirty minutes before he got restless and started trying to lull you both into conversation, when that hadn\u2019t proved to be successful, he picked up the cushion next to him on the couch. You kissed your teeth softly, careful to not give him the satisfaction he wanted as the cushion made impact with your shoulder.</p><p>\u201cEntertain meeeee,\u201d he whined. \u201cI\u2019m bored,\u201d</p><p>You ignored him, continued typing at your laptop.</p><p>\u201cBabe,\u201d he sung, repeatedly until it got annoying.</p><p>\u201cChris! What?\u201d you snapped.</p><p>Nora snickered from across the room, burying her face in work. Chris smiled, satisfied that he had garnered someone\u2019s attention at the very least.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m bored,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working,\u201d you rolled your eyes. \u201cTake your little friend and go home, or go play frisbee in the park,\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe just did that,\u201d Chris shared.</p><p>\u201cOkay, go home and nap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the worst \u2018<i>bring your boyfriend to work day,\u2019</i> EVER!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t invite you,\u201d you chuckled, reminding him. \u201cYou and your little friend-\u201c</p><p>\u201cHis name\u2019s Dodger,\u201d he rolled his eyes as if you didn\u2019t know the name of the dog you\u2019d spent the last year and a half with.</p><p>\u201cYou and your little friend-\u201c</p><p>\u201cDodger,\u201d</p><p>You paused, \u201cYou two were cute the first five minutes you got here, now you\u2019re just annoying,\u201d</p><p>Chris gasped dramatically, clutching his left boob and looked at Dodger who was minding his own business staring out of the window.</p><p>\u201cThat is rude, not in front of Dodger,\u201d</p><p>\u201cEspecially Dodger,\u201d you deadpanned, he gasped again. \u201cChris, he almost chewed three pairs of Manolo\u2019s for my clients. Can you go somewhere when I\u2019m fitting my clients soon please? They\u2019ll be here soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m friends with your clients,\u201d he shrugged.</p><p>\u201cYeah but you get in the way and start offering your styling input,\u201d you said playfully.</p><p>\u201cNora, is she rude to you like this?\u201d Chris frowned, looking across the room at your assistant who had managed to control her laughter at your petulant fight.</p><p>\u201cNora, don\u2019t entertain him,\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo comment,\u201d she chimed in, both arms raised. </p><p>\u201cFine, I\u2019ll get out of the way. Nora, wanna go grab lunch with me and Dodger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay thank you, we had lunch before you came,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you sashimi?\u201d Chris grinned as he bribed her.</p><p>You didn\u2019t mind the rapport he had with your assistant, it was quite adorable actually.</p><p>Nora\u2019s face lit up, ignoring your curious glance to see if she would sell out so easily.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a great idea, why don\u2019t you and Dodger go get sushi and bring it back here?\u201d you said to Chris, eyes lighting up as if it was the best decision ever. \u201cNora stays,\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, only if Nora\u2019s coming with me,\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d</p><p>\u201cChris, no,\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N, yes,\u201d</p><p>\u201cNora\u2019s working,\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAlright, Nora, you can go home early today - y\u2019heard the lady, I\u2019m going to take over-\u201d<br/></p><p>You sighed heavily, \u201cMy goodness, you are unbearable today. What do you want from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want your attention,\u201d he whined unashamedly. </p><p>\u201cYou had it for the last five minutes, you\u2019ve worn,\u201d you laughed.</p><p>He considered it, before his lips curled into a smile, \u201cThat\u2019s true, but unwarranted attention,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get a coffee,\u201d Nora stood up, grabbing her card wallet and keys. Her head starting to throb the more she listened to the never-ending argument. \u201cWant anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChris, why don\u2019t you go with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no thank you, I wanna stay here,\u201d he said innocently as if he hadn\u2019t been making a fuss two minutes ago.</p><p>Nora shook her head and left, you looked at Chris from your desk and cut your eyes at him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re annoying,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m bored,\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start,\u201d you barely looked up from the laptop. \u201cTell you what, help me organise this rail for my first fitting, since you want to be a stylist so bad,\u201d</p><p>He stood up so eagerly and Dodger ran over, curious about the sudden movement. You joined him at the rail, and pointed to the boxes of shoes on the floor.</p><p>\u201cIf you can unbox these, and organise them under the rail in height order, boots first, then heels to flats - that would be great,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do that,\u201d he said and got to it, whilst you focused on arranging your second rail.</p><p>Unfortunately for you, Chris\u2019 assignment lasted only five minutes before he was annoying you again, touching every single item of clothing on the rail and making hit-or-miss comments.</p><p>\u201cOkay! Here, can you take these outside into the recycling bin?\u201d you piled boxes in his arms. </p><p>You helped him with the door, Dodger in tow, you smiled to yourself knowingly. As soon as they crossed the threshold, you quickly shut it and locked yourself in and started laughing at the smooth victory. </p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d he whined on the other side of the door.</p><p>\u201cTake Dodger home, pick up steak to cook for dinner, and some wine. See you there,\u201d you instructed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wanna go home,\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye Chris,\u201d</p><p>There was silence for two seconds, \u201cC\u2019mon Dodger, let\u2019s go eat out. She can make her own dinner when she gets home,\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you,\u201d you called out laughing.</p><p>Finally content, you sat at your desk and were able to concentrate without worrying about Dodger ripping your clients samples, or Chris in your ear craving for attention.</p><p>You\u2019d had a reasonable few minutes of peace, almost forgetting the drama Chris had caused, until you heard keys turn in the door minutes later, Nora\u2019s voice alerting you of her return as she hummed on the other side of the door.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re back,\u201d Chris\u2019 distinctive voice announced, you saw Dodger and Nora first.</p><p>\u201cNora!\u201d You groaned, looking at her and then Chris. Then back to her again.</p><p>\u201cHe said he locked himself out,\u201d she shrugged, an apologetic look plastered across her face.</p><p>Chris met your gaze, sucking you in with his most apologetic puppy dog look. Yet it was so sexy. It confused you how a man of his stature was such a conflicting combination of things.

This was only day four that he&rsquo;d been back home. You&rsquo;d left for work in the morning, agreeing to meet for dinner later but he&rsquo;d turned up to your studio with Dodger in tow, which to be fair was a nice surprise and a welcomed sight.</p><p>&ldquo;Whoa, could your t-shirt get any tighter?&rdquo; you teased him as he hugged you.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just showing off in front of Nora,&rdquo; he said, waving to her in her corner of the studio space. &ldquo;This is your favourite t-shirt,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have plenty of spares,&rdquo; you gestured to your rails, set up and ready for your two clients whom you were fitting that afternoon for their upcoming press events.</p><p>&ldquo;Funny, I could always take it off if you prefer,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Behave,&rdquo; you scolded. &ldquo;Sit in one place today please, and don&rsquo;t touch anything,&rdquo;</p><p>That had lasted over thirty minutes before he got restless and started trying to lull you both into conversation, when that hadn&rsquo;t proved to be successful, he picked up the cushion next to him on the couch. You kissed your teeth softly, careful to not give him the satisfaction he wanted as the cushion made impact with your shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;Entertain meeeee,&rdquo; he whined. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m bored,&rdquo;</p><p>You ignored him, continued typing at your laptop.</p><p>&ldquo;Babe,&rdquo; he sung, repeatedly until it got annoying.</p><p>&ldquo;Chris! What?&rdquo; you snapped.</p><p>Nora snickered from across the room, burying her face in work. Chris smiled, satisfied that he had garnered someone&rsquo;s attention at the very least.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m bored,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m working,&rdquo; you rolled your eyes. &ldquo;Take your little friend and go home, or go play frisbee in the park,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We just did that,&rdquo; Chris shared.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, go home and nap?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This is the worst &lsquo;<i>bring your boyfriend to work day,&rsquo;</i> EVER!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t invite you,&rdquo; you chuckled, reminding him. &ldquo;You and your little friend-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;His name&rsquo;s Dodger,&rdquo; he rolled his eyes as if you didn&rsquo;t know the name of the dog you&rsquo;d spent the last year and a half with.</p><p>&ldquo;You and your little friend-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dodger,&rdquo;</p><p>You paused, &ldquo;You two were cute the first five minutes you got here, now you&rsquo;re just annoying,&rdquo;</p><p>Chris gasped dramatically, clutching his left boob and looked at Dodger who was minding his own business staring out of the window.</p><p>&ldquo;That is rude, not in front of Dodger,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Especially Dodger,&rdquo; you deadpanned, he gasped again. &ldquo;Chris, he almost chewed three pairs of Manolo&rsquo;s for my clients. Can you go somewhere when I&rsquo;m fitting my clients soon please? They&rsquo;ll be here soon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m friends with your clients,&rdquo; he shrugged.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah but you get in the way and start offering your styling input,&rdquo; you said playfully.</p><p>&ldquo;Nora, is she rude to you like this?&rdquo; Chris frowned, looking across the room at your assistant who had managed to control her laughter at your petulant fight.</p><p>&ldquo;Nora, don&rsquo;t entertain him,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No comment,&rdquo; she chimed in, both arms raised. </p><p>&ldquo;Fine, I&rsquo;ll get out of the way. Nora, wanna go grab lunch with me and Dodger?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m okay thank you, we had lunch before you came,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get you sashimi?&rdquo; Chris grinned as he bribed her.</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t mind the rapport he had with your assistant, it was quite adorable actually.</p><p>Nora&rsquo;s face lit up, ignoring your curious glance to see if she would sell out so easily.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a great idea, why don&rsquo;t you and Dodger go get sushi and bring it back here?&rdquo; you said to Chris, eyes lighting up as if it was the best decision ever. &ldquo;Nora stays,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, only if Nora&rsquo;s coming with me,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Chris, no,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, yes,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nora&rsquo;s working,&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Alright, Nora, you can go home early today - y&rsquo;heard the lady, I&rsquo;m going to take over-&rdquo;<br /></p><p>You sighed heavily, &ldquo;My goodness, you are unbearable today. What do you want from me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I just want your attention,&rdquo; he whined unashamedly. </p><p>&ldquo;You had it for the last five minutes, you&rsquo;ve worn,&rdquo; you laughed.</p><p>He considered it, before his lips curled into a smile, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, but unwarranted attention,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get a coffee,&rdquo; Nora stood up, grabbing her card wallet and keys. Her head starting to throb the more she listened to the never-ending argument. &ldquo;Want anything?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Chris, why don&rsquo;t you go with her?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh no thank you, I wanna stay here,&rdquo; he said innocently as if he hadn&rsquo;t been making a fuss two minutes ago.</p><p>Nora shook her head and left, you looked at Chris from your desk and cut your eyes at him.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re annoying,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m bored,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t start,&rdquo; you barely looked up from the laptop. &ldquo;Tell you what, help me organise this rail for my first fitting, since you want to be a stylist so bad,&rdquo;</p><p>He stood up so eagerly and Dodger ran over, curious about the sudden movement. You joined him at the rail, and pointed to the boxes of shoes on the floor.</p><p>&ldquo;If you can unbox these, and organise them under the rail in height order, boots first, then heels to flats - that would be great,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can do that,&rdquo; he said and got to it, whilst you focused on arranging your second rail.</p><p>Unfortunately for you, Chris&rsquo; assignment lasted only five minutes before he was annoying you again, touching every single item of clothing on the rail and making hit-or-miss comments.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay! Here, can you take these outside into the recycling bin?&rdquo; you piled boxes in his arms. </p><p>You helped him with the door, Dodger in tow, you smiled to yourself knowingly. As soon as they crossed the threshold, you quickly shut it and locked yourself in and started laughing at the smooth victory. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N?&rdquo; he whined on the other side of the door.</p><p>&ldquo;Take Dodger home, pick up steak to cook for dinner, and some wine. See you there,&rdquo; you instructed.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wanna go home,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bye Chris,&rdquo;</p><p>There was silence for two seconds, &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon Dodger, let&rsquo;s go eat out. She can make her own dinner when she gets home,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Love you,&rdquo; you called out laughing.</p><p>Finally content, you sat at your desk and were able to concentrate without worrying about Dodger ripping your clients samples, or Chris in your ear craving for attention.</p><p>You&rsquo;d had a reasonable few minutes of peace, almost forgetting the drama Chris had caused, until you heard keys turn in the door minutes later, Nora&rsquo;s voice alerting you of her return as she hummed on the other side of the door.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re back,&rdquo; Chris&rsquo; distinctive voice announced, you saw Dodger and Nora first.</p><p>&ldquo;Nora!&rdquo; You groaned, looking at her and then Chris. Then back to her again.</p><p>&ldquo;He said he locked himself out,&rdquo; she shrugged, an apologetic look plastered across her face.</p><p>Chris met your gaze, sucking you in with his most apologetic puppy dog look. Yet it was so sexy. It confused you how a man of his stature was such a conflicting combination of things. You just sighed at him.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait until you go back to work, I&rsquo;ll turn up to set and make the most noise,&rdquo; you warned him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to be so impossible,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be quiet, I promise,&rdquo; he said, tip-toeing past Nora and Dodger to the couch.</p><p>He stayed true to his word as he sat there silently, scrolled on his phone; huffed and puffed, then lay on his back before he finally dozed off.</p></p>",

A few actors are standing around, drinking various alcohol. You walk over and greet Robert before walking over to Sebastian, Chris Evans, and Anthony mackie. </p><p>You make small talk, and ask about if any of them were nervous for the premier. After about 15 minutes dinner was ready to be served. You sit down with Sebastian on your left, and Scarlett on your right. </p><p>While dinner was being served and everyone started eating. You conversed with some of the other cast members.

One\u2019s a new face and one\u2019s an old friend.\u00a0</p><p><b>Pairings: </b>Chris Evans x OFC x Sebastian Stan</p><p>\u201cAnd\u2026 cut!\u201d I hear the director\u2019s voice and a huge grin crept on my face. I was standing in front of Chris Evans, as Steve Rogers, sitting on his motorcycle. He was smiling brightly at me as I removed my black fingerless leather gloves. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all for today, everyone. That\u2019s a wrap! Thank you very much!\u201d The director announced. Everyone around us started on thanking each other and hugging each other for a successful shoot but I kept still on my stance. </p><p>\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d I smirked at him. He got off his motorcycle and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cSeems like you\u2019re forgetting something,\u201d He replied and took off his brown leather jacket. I furrowed my eyebrows in response. <i>What did I forget? The hell is he talking about?</i> He placed his hand softly on my shoulder and leaned in to my ear. \u201cIt\u2019s the last day of filming and you owe me a date.\u201d</p><p>My eyes grew wide as I watched him walk away from me. My assistant handed me a bottle of water and guided me back to my trailer. I was silent until I plopped myself at the couch. </p><p>\u201cOkay, you\u2019ve been extremely silent\u2026 What did Mr. America tell you?\u201d Joelle, my assistant and my best friend, sat down beside me. She raised her perfectly shaped eyebrows at me as she awaited my response.</p><p>\u201cRemember when we started filming and Chris wouldn\u2019t stop bugging me \u2013 asking me to go out with him?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, and being the idiot that you are, you kept saying no.\u201d She sassed at me.</p><p>\u201cWell I told him that once we wrapped the movie, I\u2019ll go to one date with him,\u201d I held up one finger to emphasize my point. \u201cAnd apparently I forgot that today is the last day.\u201d A huge smile formed on Joelle\u2019s face and she started cheering and pulling me up the couch. </p><p>\u201cBitch! Finally!!! You\u2019re going on a date with another man!\u201d She said as she dragged me to my makeup chair across the couch. Right on time, my makeup artist Brett, came in my trailer and Joelle instantly beamed at him. \u201cGuess what, B? Our girl\u2019s finally going on a date!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh Lord, finally you got over your stupid ex!\u201d Brett overdramatically exclaimed being the diva that he is. I just smiled and shook my head as I started to get myself out of my black denim jacket. I\u2019ve been single for a couple of months now and the last man I ever dated was my childhood lover, Peter. He was my first love and we first dated when I was 16 though we had an on and off relationship when I started studying in New York. Then when we were both 22, we got back together and after 3 years he asked me to marry him. \u00a0Though it all ended when I found him with a girl in our hotel room just a few months after the engagement. </p><p>\u201cLooks like Mr. America\u2019s excited.\u201d Joelle handed me my phone with a text notification from Chris.</p><p><b><i>I know you\u2019re tired today, take a rest and we\u2019ll have our date tomorrow. I\u2019ll pick you up at 7pm?</i></b></p><p>I smiled at his text and immediately typed my response. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b><i>So considerate of you, Evans. Alright, see you tomorrow at 7. </i></b><b><i>\ud83d\ude0a</i></b></p><p>I spent my night lazily, I watched whatever was on the TV and I slept until noon. I checked my phone and there was a message from Joelle and my mother. I checked my mom\u2019s message first, it was the typical \u201cHow are you, honey?\u201d and I just replied that I just finished filming yesterday. Then, I checked Joelle\u2019s message.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b><i>Mr. America wants to give you something, text me if you\u2019re awake.</i></b></p><p>I replied and in just a few minutes, I heard my door knocking. I threw on a robe over my pajamas a.k.a an old oversized t-shirt and answered the door. A huge bouquet of red roses greeted me with Joelle behind it. \u201cGood morning, pancake!\u201d she cheered and let herself in then placed the roses on the table. \u201cI know you\u2019re not a fan of flowers but you gotta give the guy some props, this is amazing.\u201d She said as she admired the flowers. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Jo. It seems like he puts a lot of effort for just one date.\u201d I said as I touched some of the petals of the roses. \u201cYou know it has only been 6 months.\u201d </p><p>\u201cCome on, Alison. Nobody\u2019s keeping track.\u201d She placed her hands on her waist and looked straight at me. \u201cJust have fun, Ali. Nothing\u2019s \u2013 wait. I though you already moved on?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI have,\u201d I replied. \u201cIt\u2019s just I\u2019m afraid \u2013 God, I\u2019m gonna sound like a pussy \u2013 I\u2019m afraid to get hurt.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAli, stop being negative.\u201d Joelle cooed. \u201cGive this a chance and if it all turns to shit, you can make an album out of it.\u201d She teased and I can\u2019t help but to giggle. Joelle and Brett helped me to get ready for my date with Chris. I wore a short emerald green bodycon dress and black pumps. At exactly 7pm, Chris picked me up and we went straight to the car waiting for us in front of the hotel. </p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019ve said this a couple of times, but you look so fucking great.\u201d Chris giggled and rubbed his face as he turned red. I covered my face with my palms as I felt my cheeks fire up. </p><p>\u201cWell you look great as well,\u201d I placed a hand on his knee and I admired his navy blue suit. The car ride to the restaurant was fun. We talked about the basic things you talk about when you\u2019re in a date. Where are you from? How many siblings do you have? Just the getting to know basics. When we arrived at the restaurant we were seated a little far away from the people. It was a little too fancy for my liking but hey, so far, I\u2019m having a good time. </p><p>\u201cSo, you went to Julliard?\u201d Chris asked with a smirk as he took a sip of his drink.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but my twin brother studied at Rutgers.\u201d I replied. </p><p>\u201cWhy is that? He didn\u2019t get in?\u201d He asked then took a bite of his steak. </p><p>\u201cNah, he was qualified to get in just didn\u2019t like some of the snobby people there. I had more patience than him.\u201d I joked and he chuckled in response as he cuts another piece of his steak. \u201cActually, he went there with a person you know.\u201d </p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d he raised his eyebrow and placed the piece of meat in his mouth. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSebastian Stan.\u201d I answered and he looked at me completely frozen.  \u00a0</p>",

My assistant handed me a bottle of water and guided me back to my trailer. I was silent until I plopped myself at the couch. </p><p>\u201cOkay, you\u2019ve been extremely silent\u2026 What did Mr. America tell you?\u201d Joelle, my assistant and my best friend, sat down beside me. She raised her perfectly shaped eyebrows at me as she awaited my response.</p><p>\u201cRemember when we started filming and Chris wouldn\u2019t stop bugging me \u2013 asking me to go out with him?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, and being the idiot that you are, you kept saying no.\u201d She sassed at me.</p><p>\u201cWell I told him that once we wrapped the movie, I\u2019ll go to one date with him,\u201d I held up one finger to emphasize my point. \u201cAnd apparently I forgot that today is the last day.\u201d A huge smile formed on Joelle\u2019s face and she started cheering and pulling me up the couch. </p><p>\u201cBitch! Finally!!! You\u2019re going on a date with another man!\u201d She said as she dragged me to my makeup chair across the couch. Right on time, my makeup artist Brett, came in my trailer and Joelle instantly beamed at him. \u201cGuess what, B? Our girl\u2019s finally going on a date!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh Lord, finally you got over your stupid ex!\u201d Brett overdramatically exclaimed being the diva that he is. I just smiled and shook my head as I started to get myself out of my black denim jacket. I\u2019ve been single for a couple of months now and the last man I ever dated was my childhood lover, Peter. He was my first love and we first dated when I was 16 though we had an on and off relationship when I started studying in New York. Then when we were both 22, we got back together and after 3 years he asked me to marry him. \u00a0Though it all ended when I found him with a girl in our hotel room just a few months after the engagement. </p><p>\u201cLooks like Mr. America\u2019s excited.\u201d Joelle handed me my phone with a text notification from Chris.</p><p><b><i>I know you\u2019re tired today, take a rest and we\u2019ll have our date tomorrow. I\u2019ll pick you up at 7pm?</i></b></p><p>I smiled at his text and immediately typed my response. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b><i>So considerate of you, Evans. Alright, see you tomorrow at 7. </i></b><b><i>\ud83d\ude0a</i></b></p><p>I spent my night lazily, I watched whatever was on the TV and I slept until noon. I checked my phone and there was a message from Joelle and my mother. I checked my mom\u2019s message first, it was the typical \u201cHow are you, honey?\u201d and I just replied that I just finished filming yesterday. Then, I checked Joelle\u2019s message.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b><i>Mr. America wants to give you something, text me if you\u2019re awake.</i></b></p><p>I replied and in just a few minutes, I heard my door knocking. I threw on a robe over my pajamas a.k.a an old oversized t-shirt and answered the door. A huge bouquet of red roses greeted me with Joelle behind it. \u201cGood morning, pancake!\u201d she cheered and let herself in then placed the roses on the table. \u201cI know you\u2019re not a fan of flowers but you gotta give the guy some props, this is amazing.\u201d She said as she admired the flowers. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Jo. It seems like he puts a lot of effort for just one date.\u201d I said as I touched some of the petals of the roses. \u201cYou know it has only been 6 months.\u201d </p><p>\u201cCome on, Alison. Nobody\u2019s keeping track.\u201d She placed her hands on her waist and looked straight at me. \u201cJust have fun, Ali. Nothing\u2019s \u2013 wait. I though you already moved on?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI have,\u201d I replied. \u201cIt\u2019s just I\u2019m afraid \u2013 God, I\u2019m gonna sound like a pussy \u2013 I\u2019m afraid to get hurt.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAli, stop being negative.\u201d Joelle cooed. \u201cGive this a chance and if it all turns to shit, you can make an album out of it.\u201d She teased and I can\u2019t help but to giggle. Joelle and Brett helped me to get ready for my date with Chris. I wore a short emerald green bodycon dress and black pumps. At exactly 7pm, Chris picked me up and we went straight to the car waiting for us in front of the hotel. </p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019ve said this a couple of times, but you look so fucking great.\u201d Chris giggled and rubbed his face as he turned red. I covered my face with my palms as I felt my cheeks fire up. </p><p>\u201cWell you look great as well,\u201d I placed a hand on his knee and I admired his navy blue suit. The car ride to the restaurant was fun. We talked about the basic things you talk about when you\u2019re in a date. Where are you from? How many siblings do you have? Just the getting to know basics. When we arrived at the restaurant we were seated a little far away from the people. It was a little too fancy for my liking but hey, so far, I\u2019m having a good time. </p><p>\u201cSo, you went to Julliard?\u201d Chris asked with a smirk as he took a sip of his drink.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but my twin brother studied at Rutgers.\u201d I replied. </p><p>\u201cWhy is that? He didn\u2019t get in?\u201d He asked then took a bite of his steak. </p><p>\u201cNah, he was qualified to get in just didn\u2019t like some of the snobby people there. I had more patience than him.\u201d I joked and he chuckled in response as he cuts another piece of his steak. \u201cActually, he went there with a person you know.\u201d </p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d he raised his eyebrow and placed the piece of meat in his mouth. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSebastian Stan.\u201d I answered and he looked at me completely frozen.  \u00a0</p></p>",

He was smiling brightly at me as I removed my black fingerless leather gloves. </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all for today, everyone. That&rsquo;s a wrap! Thank you very much!&rdquo; The director announced. Everyone around us started on thanking each other and hugging each other for a successful shoot but I kept still on my stance. </p><p>&ldquo;Why are you looking at me like that?&rdquo; I smirked at him. He got off his motorcycle and shook his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Seems like you&rsquo;re forgetting something,&rdquo; He replied and took off his brown leather jacket.
