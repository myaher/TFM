        "body": "<p>Summary: <i>Phil runs a hotel owned by his family, and Dan is one of the employees who works for him. Unfortunately, it\u2019s a bad day for Dan as he works one of their busiest days at the hotel. But, the day ends with an unexpected surprise.</i></p><p>Genre: AU, Fluff</p><p>Word Count: 1,568</p><!-- more --><p>Normally, Dan loves his job working at the hotel owned by Phil Lester. He\u2019s been working here for over two years now. His job is to basically make sure that everything is cleaned and working, and reporting back to Phil Lester after he\u2019s done a run through of the entire hotel.<br/></p><p>Today, however, has just been a bad day for Dan. The hotel is busy for some reason. There\u2019s two parties going on at once which means there are little kids running around everywhere and breaking things, and Dan has to deal with angry parents even though it\u2019s Phil who should be dealing with that stuff.</p><p>\u201cThere you are!\u201d</p><p>Dan groans as soon as he hears Phil\u2019s voice. It\u2019s the first time all day that he\u2019s been able to sit down and actually rest for a bit without dealing with any angry hotel guests, and of course Phil has to ruin that. Dan also didn\u2019t want to be seen by Phil, especially because he knows that he\u2019s going to get yelled at for slacking on the job, with Phil being the perfectionist that he is.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing up here, Dan? Oh, sorry, are you on your break?\u201d Phil asks as he walks up to Dan, who\u2019s currently sitting cross-legged on the floor with his head in his hands..</p><p>\u201cMy break isn\u2019t for another hour,\u201d Dan mumbles, rubbing his forehead.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you sitting down?\u201d Phil asks, blinking a few times. \u201cToday\u2019s a busy day, and there\u2019s a lot to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I don\u2019t know that, Phil?\u201d Dan asks, finally looking up at Phil. \u201cI\u2019ve had to deal with those annoying little brats all day and angry parents. I\u2019m exhausted and it\u2019s barely twelve in the afternoon! Not to mention, I\u2019ve got a headache coming on, but that doesn\u2019t matter. You\u2019ve come to tell me you need something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes\u2026 but, why didn\u2019t you tell me that you have a headache?\u201d Phil asks.</p><p>\u201cBecause we\u2019re busy,\u201d Dan replies, blinking a few times. \u201cI know how much of a perfectionist you are, and I didn\u2019t\u2026 I didn\u2019t want to make you upset or anything for slacking on the job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan, stop. I may be a perfectionist but I care about my employees. You should have told me sooner, okay? I want you to be able to come to me if you don\u2019t feel well. Come with me. We have something for that headache of yours at the front desk,\u201d Phil says, helping Dan up from the floor.</p><p>Dan stands there for a second before finally following Phil.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know we had this at the front desk,\u201d Dan says as Phil pulls out some tylenol from the drawer.</p><p>\u201cReally? Did no one tell you?\u201d Phil asks, raising his eyebrows as he looks at Dan. \u201cWe have all kinds of stuff for employees at the front desk. All you have to do is walk up and ask whoever\u2019s working at the time and they\u2019ll give you what you need, with reason. Hell, we even have tampons up here for the woman.\u201d</p><p>Dan can\u2019t help but laugh, though he instantly regrets it when his head starts pounding again. Dan whines, and quickly grabs a hold of his head. \u201cFuck, that hurts. Don\u2019t make me laugh,\u201d</p><p>Phil chuckles and shakes his head at Dan. \u201cSorry,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, do you work here?\u201d</p><p>Dan blinks a few times as he looks over and sees a not-so-happy older woman. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a bone to pick with you-\u201d she begins.</p><p>Dan closes his eyes, trying to keep himself composed. He just can\u2019t get a break today, and at this point\u2026 all he really wants to do right now is just break down and let all of his frustration out. Usually Dan is never like this, especially towards their guests. He\u2019s usually smiley and cheerful. Today is just a bad day.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am, excuse me. He\u2019s actually going on his break right now,\u201d Phil says, handing Dan the tylenol as well as a bottle of water. \u201cPJ\u2019s just now coming in so I\u2019ll have him deal with guests, Dan. Take your break, go to your room for about an hour and then come back down. Let me know when you\u2019re back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to take an hour break? But, we\u2019re so busy today,\u201d Dan frowns as he looks up at Phil.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it handled, alright?\u201d Phil assures him. \u201cNow, go\u2026\u201d He gently shoos Dan away, smiling. Phil turns and looks at the woman who\u2019s impatiently waiting. \u201cSorry about that. What\u2019s the problem, ma\u2019am?\u201d</p><p>As Dan is walking up to his room, he passes PJ. \u201cOh, hey. Good luck down there,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cBusy day today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a madhouse down there,\u201d Dan says. \u201cTwo birthday parties. Screaming children. Angry parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. We\u2019re just a hotel. We\u2019re not even popular!\u201d PJ complains as he continues walking.</p><p>Dan smiles a little to himself, before finally making it to his bedroom. Finally. Peace and quiet time.</p><p>Dan\u2019s hour goes by way too quickly, and before he knows it, he\u2019s thrown back into the madness, but luckily Phil pulls him aside before he has to deal with anymore angry guests.</p><p>\u201cI thought I was supposed to come find you when I was done with my break?\u201d Dan asks.</p><p>\u201cUh, sorry. But, I want you to do a run through of the hotel,\u201d Phil tells him.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? Isn\u2019t it a little early for that?\u201d Dan asks, raising his eyebrows at Phil.</p><p>\u201cDan, you\u2019ve been working hard all morning and dealing with guests. I want you to actually be able to do what you\u2019re supposed to be doing. Besides, PJ\u2019s been handling the guests since your break,\u201d Phil says.</p><p>Dan smiles and then shakes his head. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand how that man has so much patience, even when he\u2019s being yelled at by an angry mum he still is so kind and polite,\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u2019why I hired him,\u201d Phil chuckles. \u201cBy the way, what\u2019s your favorite type of pizza?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh,\u201d Dan blinks a few times. \u201cThat\u2019s an odd question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d Phil laughs. \u201cCome on, just answer the simple question. Favorite pizza?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Phil. Pizza is pizza. I\u2019ll eat any type of pizza, honestly. Why are you asking?\u201d Dan asks.</p><p>\u201cNo reason. Just, trust me. Shout if you need anything,\u201d Phil smiles at Dan before walking away.</p><p>Dan raises his eyebrows as he watches Phil before turning around and continuing down the hallway, and then he runs into Louise. \u201cHey, Lou. Didn\u2019t know you were working today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, did you just see Phil? Did he ask you what your favorite pizza is too?\u201d Louise asks.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Dan nods. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with that? Is he planning something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord knows with that man,\u201d Louise says before walking into one of the rooms.</p><p>It\u2019s around 5pm when Dan finally understands why Phil was asking his employees their favorite pizzas, because he wanted to order everyone dinner to make up for their unusual busy day.</p><p>\u201cYou really shouldn\u2019t have done this Phil,\u201d Dan says as he stands with Phil in the break room with the other employees. \u201cWe\u2019re just doing our jobs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But, we usually aren\u2019t that busy, and everybody did such a wonderful job today,\u201d Phil says. \u201cThose birthday parties really threw us off guard, but still\u2026 my employees took care of everything,\u201d</p><p>Dan smiles. \u201cYeah, we really have a nice team here, don\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell yeah we do, and I\u2019m so proud of everyone here,\u201d Phil smiles as he looks around, before looking back at Dan. \u201cI\u2019m glad you decided to come. I wanted to ask you something.\u201d</p><p>Dan freezes, before looking up at Phil. \u201cOh no. You\u2019re going to fire me, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Phil\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cNo, God no. Of course I\u2019m not firing you! You\u2019re one of our best. Christ, Dan.\u201d He sighs softly. \u201cI wanted to ask if, maybe\u2026 you\u2019d like to hang out with me sometime? Outside of work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean, like\u2026 uh, a <i>date</i>?\u201d Dan asks, biting his lip nervously.</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s okay with you? If not, we can\u2026 totally just hang out as friends,\u201d Phil says.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m perfectly fine with it being a date. I just thought that was like, against the rules or something?\u201d Dan asks. \u201cYou know, employees dating their bosses?\u201d</p><p>Phil chuckles. \u201cWell, that\u2019s not a rule here. I\u2019d just\u2026 really like to hang out with you outside of work,\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Y-Yeah, that would be\u2026 that would be awesome,\u201d Dan smiles, unable to stop himself from blushing. Phil Lester is asking him out on a date, which is something he never expected to happen, but he\u2019s happy that it did happen, especially when he\u2019s always secretly had a crush on Phil.</p><p>\u201cGreat, it\u2019s a date! I\u2019ll text you later then?\u201d Phil asks.</p><p>\u201cYes, definitely\u2026\u201d Dan nods quickly. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to our date, Phil.\u201d</p><p>Phil smiles at Dan. \u201cYeah. I-I should go talk to the other employees,\u201d he says, before shyly walking away.</p><p>\u201cDid I just hear what I think I heard?\u201d</p><p>Dan blinks a few times as he looks over, and sighs when he sees Louise. \u201cWere you eavesdropping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t eavesdropping,\u201d Louise quickly defends herself. \u201cI just happened to walk by when I heard none other than Phil Lester ask you out on a date, and you said yes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Lou,\u201d Dan mumbles, looking down as his cheeks turn even redder.</p>",

But, the day ends with an unexpected surprise.</i></p><p>Genre: AU, Fluff</p><p>Word Count: 1,568</p>[[MORE]]<p>Normally, Dan loves his job working at the hotel owned by Phil Lester. He\u2019s been working here for over two years now. His job is to basically make sure that everything is cleaned and working, and reporting back to Phil Lester after he\u2019s done a run through of the entire hotel.<br></p><p>Today, however, has just been a bad day for Dan. The hotel is busy for some reason. There\u2019s two parties going on at once which means there are little kids running around everywhere and breaking things, and Dan has to deal with angry parents even though it\u2019s Phil who should be dealing with that stuff.</p><p>\u201cThere you are!\u201d</p><p>Dan groans as soon as he hears Phil\u2019s voice. It\u2019s the first time all day that he\u2019s been able to sit down and actually rest for a bit without dealing with any angry hotel guests, and of course Phil has to ruin that. Dan also didn\u2019t want to be seen by Phil, especially because he knows that he\u2019s going to get yelled at for slacking on the job, with Phil being the perfectionist that he is.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing up here, Dan? Oh, sorry, are you on your break?\u201d Phil asks as he walks up to Dan, who\u2019s currently sitting cross-legged on the floor with his head in his hands..</p><p>\u201cMy break isn\u2019t for another hour,\u201d Dan mumbles, rubbing his forehead.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you sitting down?\u201d Phil asks, blinking a few times. \u201cToday\u2019s a busy day, and there\u2019s a lot to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I don\u2019t know that, Phil?\u201d Dan asks, finally looking up at Phil. \u201cI\u2019ve had to deal with those annoying little brats all day and angry parents. I\u2019m exhausted and it\u2019s barely twelve in the afternoon! Not to mention, I\u2019ve got a headache coming on, but that doesn\u2019t matter. You\u2019ve come to tell me you need something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes\u2026 but, why didn\u2019t you tell me that you have a headache?\u201d Phil asks.</p><p>\u201cBecause we\u2019re busy,\u201d Dan replies, blinking a few times. \u201cI know how much of a perfectionist you are, and I didn\u2019t\u2026 I didn\u2019t want to make you upset or anything for slacking on the job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan, stop. I may be a perfectionist but I care about my employees. You should have told me sooner, okay? I want you to be able to come to me if you don\u2019t feel well. Come with me. We have something for that headache of yours at the front desk,\u201d Phil says, helping Dan up from the floor.</p><p>Dan stands there for a second before finally following Phil.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know we had this at the front desk,\u201d Dan says as Phil pulls out some tylenol from the drawer.</p><p>\u201cReally? Did no one tell you?\u201d Phil asks, raising his eyebrows as he looks at Dan. \u201cWe have all kinds of stuff for employees at the front desk. All you have to do is walk up and ask whoever\u2019s working at the time and they\u2019ll give you what you need, with reason. Hell, we even have tampons up here for the woman.\u201d</p><p>Dan can\u2019t help but laugh, though he instantly regrets it when his head starts pounding again. Dan whines, and quickly grabs a hold of his head. \u201cFuck, that hurts. Don\u2019t make me laugh,\u201d</p><p>Phil chuckles and shakes his head at Dan. \u201cSorry,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, do you work here?\u201d</p><p>Dan blinks a few times as he looks over and sees a not-so-happy older woman. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a bone to pick with you-\u201d she begins.</p><p>Dan closes his eyes, trying to keep himself composed. He just can\u2019t get a break today, and at this point\u2026 all he really wants to do right now is just break down and let all of his frustration out. Usually Dan is never like this, especially towards their guests. He\u2019s usually smiley and cheerful. Today is just a bad day.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am, excuse me. He\u2019s actually going on his break right now,\u201d Phil says, handing Dan the tylenol as well as a bottle of water. \u201cPJ\u2019s just now coming in so I\u2019ll have him deal with guests, Dan. Take your break, go to your room for about an hour and then come back down. Let me know when you\u2019re back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to take an hour break? But, we\u2019re so busy today,\u201d Dan frowns as he looks up at Phil.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it handled, alright?\u201d Phil assures him. \u201cNow, go\u2026\u201d He gently shoos Dan away, smiling. Phil turns and looks at the woman who\u2019s impatiently waiting. \u201cSorry about that. What\u2019s the problem, ma\u2019am?\u201d</p><p>As Dan is walking up to his room, he passes PJ. \u201cOh, hey. Good luck down there,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cBusy day today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a madhouse down there,\u201d Dan says. \u201cTwo birthday parties. Screaming children.

I may be a perfectionist but I care about my employees. You should have told me sooner, okay? I want you to be able to come to me if you don\u2019t feel well. Come with me. We have something for that headache of yours at the front desk,\u201d Phil says, helping Dan up from the floor.</p><p>Dan stands there for a second before finally following Phil.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know we had this at the front desk,\u201d Dan says as Phil pulls out some tylenol from the drawer.</p><p>\u201cReally? Did no one tell you?\u201d Phil asks, raising his eyebrows as he looks at Dan. \u201cWe have all kinds of stuff for employees at the front desk. All you have to do is walk up and ask whoever\u2019s working at the time and they\u2019ll give you what you need, with reason. Hell, we even have tampons up here for the woman.\u201d</p><p>Dan can\u2019t help but laugh, though he instantly regrets it when his head starts pounding again. Dan whines, and quickly grabs a hold of his head. \u201cFuck, that hurts. Don\u2019t make me laugh,\u201d</p><p>Phil chuckles and shakes his head at Dan. \u201cSorry,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, do you work here?\u201d</p><p>Dan blinks a few times as he looks over and sees a not-so-happy older woman. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a bone to pick with you-\u201d she begins.</p><p>Dan closes his eyes, trying to keep himself composed. He just can\u2019t get a break today, and at this point\u2026 all he really wants to do right now is just break down and let all of his frustration out. Usually Dan is never like this, especially towards their guests. He\u2019s usually smiley and cheerful. Today is just a bad day.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am, excuse me. He\u2019s actually going on his break right now,\u201d Phil says, handing Dan the tylenol as well as a bottle of water. \u201cPJ\u2019s just now coming in so I\u2019ll have him deal with guests, Dan. Take your break, go to your room for about an hour and then come back down. Let me know when you\u2019re back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to take an hour break? But, we\u2019re so busy today,\u201d Dan frowns as he looks up at Phil.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it handled, alright?\u201d Phil assures him. \u201cNow, go\u2026\u201d He gently shoos Dan away, smiling. Phil turns and looks at the woman who\u2019s impatiently waiting. \u201cSorry about that. What\u2019s the problem, ma\u2019am?\u201d</p><p>As Dan is walking up to his room, he passes PJ. \u201cOh, hey. Good luck down there,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cBusy day today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a madhouse down there,\u201d Dan says. \u201cTwo birthday parties. Screaming children. Angry parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. We\u2019re just a hotel. We\u2019re not even popular!\u201d PJ complains as he continues walking.</p><p>Dan smiles a little to himself, before finally making it to his bedroom. Finally. Peace and quiet time.</p><p>Dan\u2019s hour goes by way too quickly, and before he knows it, he\u2019s thrown back into the madness, but luckily Phil pulls him aside before he has to deal with anymore angry guests.</p><p>\u201cI thought I was supposed to come find you when I was done with my break?\u201d Dan asks.</p><p>\u201cUh, sorry. But, I want you to do a run through of the hotel,\u201d Phil tells him.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? Isn\u2019t it a little early for that?\u201d Dan asks, raising his eyebrows at Phil.</p><p>\u201cDan, you\u2019ve been working hard all morning and dealing with guests. I want you to actually be able to do what you\u2019re supposed to be doing. Besides, PJ\u2019s been handling the guests since your break,\u201d Phil says.</p><p>Dan smiles and then shakes his head. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand how that man has so much patience, even when he\u2019s being yelled at by an angry mum he still is so kind and polite,\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u2019why I hired him,\u201d Phil chuckles. \u201cBy the way, what\u2019s your favorite type of pizza?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh,\u201d Dan blinks a few times. \u201cThat\u2019s an odd question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d Phil laughs. \u201cCome on, just answer the simple question. Favorite pizza?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Phil. Pizza is pizza. I\u2019ll eat any type of pizza, honestly. Why are you asking?\u201d Dan asks.</p><p>\u201cNo reason. Just, trust me. Shout if you need anything,\u201d Phil smiles at Dan before walking away.</p><p>Dan raises his eyebrows as he watches Phil before turning around and continuing down the hallway, and then he runs into Louise. \u201cHey, Lou. Didn\u2019t know you were working today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, did you just see Phil? Did he ask you what your favorite pizza is too?\u201d Louise asks.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Dan nods. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with that? Is he planning something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord knows with that man,\u201d Louise says before walking into one of the rooms.</p><p>It\u2019s around 5pm when Dan finally understands why Phil was asking his employees their favorite pizzas, because he wanted to order everyone dinner to make up for their unusual busy day.</p><p>\u201cYou really shouldn\u2019t have done this Phil,\u201d Dan says as he stands with Phil in the break room with the other employees. \u201cWe\u2019re just doing our jobs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But, we usually aren\u2019t that busy, and everybody did such a wonderful job today,\u201d Phil says. \u201cThose birthday parties really threw us off guard, but still\u2026 my employees took care of everything,\u201d</p><p>Dan smiles. \u201cYeah, we really have a nice team here, don\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell yeah we do, and I\u2019m so proud of everyone here,\u201d Phil smiles as he looks around, before looking back at Dan. \u201cI\u2019m glad you decided to come. I wanted to ask you something.\u201d</p><p>Dan freezes, before looking up at Phil. \u201cOh no. You\u2019re going to fire me, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Phil\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cNo, God no. Of course I\u2019m not firing you! You\u2019re one of our best. Christ, Dan.\u201d He sighs softly. \u201cI wanted to ask if, maybe\u2026 you\u2019d like to hang out with me sometime? Outside of work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean, like\u2026 uh, a <i>date</i>?\u201d Dan asks, biting his lip nervously.</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s okay with you? If not, we can\u2026 totally just hang out as friends,\u201d Phil says.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m perfectly fine with it being a date. I just thought that was like, against the rules or something?\u201d Dan asks. \u201cYou know, employees dating their bosses?\u201d</p><p>Phil chuckles. \u201cWell, that\u2019s not a rule here. I\u2019d just\u2026 really like to hang out with you outside of work,\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Y-Yeah, that would be\u2026 that would be awesome,\u201d Dan smiles, unable to stop himself from blushing. Phil Lester is asking him out on a date, which is something he never expected to happen, but he\u2019s happy that it did happen, especially when he\u2019s always secretly had a crush on Phil.</p><p>\u201cGreat, it\u2019s a date! I\u2019ll text you later then?\u201d Phil asks.</p><p>\u201cYes, definitely\u2026\u201d Dan nods quickly. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to our date, Phil.\u201d</p><p>Phil smiles at Dan. \u201cYeah. I-I should go talk to the other employees,\u201d he says, before shyly walking away.</p><p>\u201cDid I just hear what I think I heard?\u201d</p><p>Dan blinks a few times as he looks over, and sighs when he sees Louise. \u201cWere you eavesdropping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t eavesdropping,\u201d Louise quickly defends herself. \u201cI just happened to walk by when I heard none other than Phil Lester ask you out on a date, and you said yes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Lou,\u201d Dan mumbles, looking down as his cheeks turn even redder.</p>",

He&rsquo;s been working here for over two years now. His job is to basically make sure that everything is cleaned and working, and reporting back to Phil Lester after he&rsquo;s done a run through of the entire hotel.<br /></p><p>Today, however, has just been a bad day for Dan. The hotel is busy for some reason. There&rsquo;s two parties going on at once which means there are little kids running around everywhere and breaking things, and Dan has to deal with angry parents even though it&rsquo;s Phil who should be dealing with that stuff.</p><p>&ldquo;There you are!&rdquo;</p><p>Dan groans as soon as he hears Phil&rsquo;s voice. It&rsquo;s the first time all day that he&rsquo;s been able to sit down and actually rest for a bit without dealing with any angry hotel guests, and of course Phil has to ruin that. Dan also didn&rsquo;t want to be seen by Phil, especially because he knows that he&rsquo;s going to get yelled at for slacking on the job, with Phil being the perfectionist that he is.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing up here, Dan? Oh, sorry, are you on your break?&rdquo; Phil asks as he walks up to Dan, who&rsquo;s currently sitting cross-legged on the floor with his head in his hands..</p><p>&ldquo;My break isn&rsquo;t for another hour,&rdquo; Dan mumbles, rubbing his forehead.</p><p>&ldquo;Why are you sitting down?&rdquo; Phil asks, blinking a few times. &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s a busy day, and there&rsquo;s a lot to do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Like I don&rsquo;t know that, Phil?&rdquo; Dan asks, finally looking up at Phil. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had to deal with those annoying little brats all day and angry parents.

You know one that won\u2019t let him take 3 whole months off so he can do nothing. I\u2019m not hating on him but these youtubers don\u2019t know how easy they have it. They should try working a real job and then let\u2019s see how much they want to complain about how hard it is to sit in front of a camera and play video games or talk about memes and get a ton of money for it.",
        "answer": "<p>I agree with this statement regarding YouTubers. I think it\u2019s probably not so cut and dry and easy for Dan to just determine what he wants from YouTube going forward because it involves making a lot of big decisions that will effect himself and others, but generally when YouTubers whine about their jobs or try to get their audience to pity them (not saying this is what Dan\u2019s doing), especially when they do it while pedaling merch, it make me roll my eyes. I have an irl friend who is pretty successful in the entertainment industry and they don\u2019t just get long periods of time off or have the flexibility that YouTubers do. Like the rest of us, that person has to meet deadlines and balance multiple projects continuously. All the jobs I have had have involved even less flexibility. It concerns me when some of them seem to take advantage of their young audiences and make them feel like they need to be spending their parents money or their favorites will be poor, when those same favorites are probably making more than their parents. I think the whole parasocial relationship aspect of YouTube is really interesting, but also really dangerous as there can be a big imbalance of power. If Dan started trying to get his audience to pity him or, for example, put membership on his channel while not offering regular content, I would stop supporting him immediately, but to be honest, I think most of the unhealthy attitudes I see come from the phandom itself and members policing other members. </p>",
