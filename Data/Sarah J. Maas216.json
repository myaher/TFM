        "body": "<p>I believe I am what the kids call shook. Or what they used to call shook. I am shook none the less.\u00a0</p><p>Chaol has been my favorite male character in this series since book 1. Obviously, favorite character is Manon, because Manon. But I do really love Chaol. So I am shocked that it has taken me this long to actually read this book. KoA is literally out today, those are the lengths to which I have procrastinated. <br/>I really loved this book, totally made up for Chaol being MIA from Empire of Storms. It added to much to the world of Throne of Glass.\u00a0</p><p>And it continued in what I see as the pattern of Sarah J Maas listening to the criticisms of her books and instead of commenting upon them she seems to just make the corrections (or try, I don&rsquo;t want to claim she has done perfectly here but I do think you can see the changes in her books). Sarah, you don&rsquo;t have enough people of color, responds by adding more main players in her series that are people of color and this book is like 98% people of color. Not enough wlw, making an effort there, this can obviously still be improved on but I&rsquo;m not sure we want a SJM wlw sex scene, idk if she could do that well. Maybe. Speaking of sex scenes this book HAD NO CRINGY SEX SCENES! So hopefully that was listening. Also, this book could have been horribly abelist, or it could have been low key abelist with the magic preventing disability but I think this was managed well in this book. I am not a person who uses a wheelchair or a cane so I will probably look into reactions from those people. Also she is obivously a bit into some toxic masculinity things but I felt like she sort of didn\u2019t have issues with this that I saw in this book. But obivously I could have overlooked things. Don\u2019t hate me internet I am figuring things out. Obviously, I can critique her work, but I also love her work. People can do both.</p><p>The plot really gives depth to the issues faced in this series. This book is absolutely required reading for the series, you receive vital information about the world in this book.\u00a0</p><p>I love Nesryn. I was MASSIVELY disappointed that &lt;spoiler&gt; her and Chaol were not going to work out romantically. &lt;/spoiler&gt; But I ended up loving how this whole situation worked out. I like sobbed because of Nesryn&rsquo;s storyline multiple times. It was fantastic.\u00a0</p><p>I love Yrene. She is a wonderful kind character.

I am shook none the less.\u00a0</p><p>Chaol has been my favorite male character in this series since book 1. Obviously, favorite character is Manon, because Manon. But I do really love Chaol. So I am shocked that it has taken me this long to actually read this book.

It added to much to the world of Throne of Glass.\u00a0</p><p>And it continued in what I see as the pattern of Sarah J Maas listening to the criticisms of her books and instead of commenting upon them she seems to just make the corrections (or try, I don\u2019t want to claim she has done perfectly here but I do think you can see the changes in her books). Sarah, you don\u2019t have enough people of color, responds by adding more main players in her series that are people of color and this book is like 98% people of color. Not enough wlw, making an effort there, this can obviously still be improved on but I\u2019m not sure we want a SJM wlw sex scene, idk if she could do that well. Maybe. Speaking of sex scenes this book HAD NO CRINGY SEX SCENES! So hopefully that was listening. Also, this book could have been horribly abelist, or it could have been low key abelist with the magic preventing disability but I think this was managed well in this book. I am not a person who uses a wheelchair or a cane so I will probably look into reactions from those people. Also she is obivously a bit into some toxic masculinity things but I felt like she sort of didn\u2019t have issues with this that I saw in this book. But obivously I could have overlooked things. Don\u2019t hate me internet I am figuring things out. Obviously, I can critique her work, but I also love her work.

There were multiple times where I was biting my nails, due to Maas&rsquo; atmospheric writing and beautifully crafted tension. Also, due to this book leaving behind Aelin and focusing more on Chaol, Nesryn, and Yrene, a lot fo the repetitive phrases and words weren&rsquo;t used!

I was prepared to push through this book and get it over with, but it actually ended up being one of my favorites, and changing my mind about Chaol. His growth in <i>Tower of Dawn</i> is amazing. He became a character I could respect and like over these 600+ pages. Due to the events of the <i>Queen of Shadows</i>(I won&rsquo;t spoil what events), obviously Chaol has a lot of work to do, and this book really emphasizes the mental and psychological aspect of said work. I was afraid of how they would deal with what happened to him, but I was very happy with the result. <br/><b>Nesyrn</b> was another interesting and complex character, who in the previous books I liked but didn&rsquo;t feel a connection toward. This book changed that and made me really love her. She is strong, both physically and mentally, and very admirable. She is also very caring and dedicated to her biological family, not just the protagonists, something that isn&rsquo;t really a trait in many other characters in this series (mostly because their families are dead, but still). <b>Yrene </b>is our third main character of this book.

There were multiple times where I was biting my nails, due to Maas\u2019 atmospheric writing and beautifully crafted tension.

I didn\u2019t like <b>Chaol</b>, I never really did, and I didn\u2019t want an entire book focusing on him instead of Aelin (especially after the ending of <i>Empire of Storms</i>!) I was prepared to push through this book and get it over with, but it actually ended up being one of my favorites, and changing my mind about Chaol. His growth in <i>Tower of Dawn</i> is amazing. He became a character I could respect and like over these 600+ pages. Due to the events of the <i>Queen of Shadows</i>(I won\u2019t spoil what events), obviously Chaol has a lot of work to do, and this book really emphasizes the mental and psychological aspect of said work. I was afraid of how they would deal with what happened to him, but I was very happy with the result. <br><b>Nesyrn</b> was another interesting and complex character, who in the previous books I liked but didn\u2019t feel a connection toward. This book changed that and made me really love her. She is strong, both physically and mentally, and very admirable. She is also very caring and dedicated to her biological family, not just the protagonists, something that isn\u2019t really a trait in many other characters in this series (mostly because their families are dead, but still). <b>Yrene </b>is our third main character of this book. You might remember her from <i>The Assassin\u2019s Blade</i>. I loved seeing her again and watching her journey.<br><i>Tower of Dawn</i> also introduced multiple <b>new characters</b>, from the children of the Khagan to the healers at the Torre. Each character introduced added their own flair to the story and I\u2019m excited to see what Maas is going to have them do next (especially Sartaq and Hasar). With these new characters, there was a lot of<b> added representation</b> that I felt was desperately needed in this series. Almost all of the side characters were POC and there was more LGBT representation that I really appreciated.
