Come feel!&rdquo; <br/></p><p>&ldquo;Yay!&rdquo; Andi said, \nhurrying to the couch. Bex was now eight months pregnant, and although \nAndi still had moments of doubt now and then, they were far and few \nbetween. She was warming up to the idea of having a little sister, and \nactually looking forward to the day she would arrive.</p><!-- more --><p>Bex felt her stomach \nwith her own hand, then guided Andi&rsquo;s hand to where to movement was, \npressing it against her. &ldquo;Right there. Do you feel it?&rdquo;</p><p>Andi&rsquo;s eyes widened when\n the baby rewarded her with a hard kick. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so cool,&rdquo; she breathed.\n &ldquo;I know there&rsquo;s a baby in there. But wow&hellip; there&rsquo;s a whole real person\n in there.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she grinned, squeezing Andi with her free hand.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe I used \nto be small enough to fit in there,&rdquo; Andi said, laying her head against \nher mother, her hand still resting on her belly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so weird to think\n about.&rdquo;</p><p>Bex patted her baby bump. &ldquo;Yup. This is the original Andi Shack.&rdquo;</p><p>Andi laughed. &ldquo;So, are we going to call the baby &lsquo;the baby&rsquo; forever, or have you guys picked a name yet?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good question,&rdquo; Bex said, patting Andi&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking, Andi&hellip; and I think you should get to name her.&rdquo;</p><p>Andi looked up, surprised, &ldquo;Me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah! Why not?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;&rdquo; she fretted. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lot of pressure. You and dad should choose the name.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Bex asked. &ldquo;I \ntrust you. You&rsquo;re creative, and you have good taste. I want you to be a \npart of your sister&rsquo;s life every step of the way. Like I said, she&rsquo;s \nyour baby too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d be doing me a favor. Your father wants to name the baby Hendrix.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Hendrix?&rdquo;</i> Andi wrinkled her nose.</p><p>&ldquo;As in Jimi. Please save our baby from embarrassment, Andi,&rdquo; she teased. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid his second choice will be Ringo.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, can I think about the name for a while?&rdquo; she asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Bex nodded. &ldquo;Mull it over as long as you need. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll love whatever you pick.&rdquo;</p><p>Suddenly Bex&rsquo;s face paled, and she leaned forward, squeezing her eyes shut, as her abdomen clenched with pain.<br/></p><p>&ldquo;Mom, are you okay?&rdquo; Andi asked, sitting up. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Her heartbeat sped up with worry. She lay her hand on her shoulder.<br/></p><p>Bex took a deep breath \nthrough her mouth. Her chest felt a little tight, as if she couldn&rsquo;t get\n enough air. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, Andi. Don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;<br/></p><p>Andi frowned. &ldquo;Do you need a drink of water? Or do you want me to rub your back, or something?&rdquo;<br/></p><p>Bex nodded, her eyes stinging. She arched her back trying to relieve the pressure. &ldquo;Water would be good. Thanks.&rdquo;</p><p>Andi hurried to the \nkitchen and filled a glass, then rushed back to give it to her mom. She \nsat down, rubbing Bex&rsquo;s back in slow circles, trying to sooth her.<br/></p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, Andiman.&rdquo; Bex \ntook a sip, trying to calm herself, without alarming Andi any more than \nshe already had. But even as the pain eased and disappeared, she wished \nBowie were home.</p><p>When the pain returned a\n few minutes later, though, she knew she couldn&rsquo;t ignore it. &ldquo;Andi, call\n your dad,&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;I think the baby&rsquo;s coming.&rdquo; <br/></p><p>*****<br/></p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Shnoo,&rdquo; Ham said, \nsitting down next to Andi. Bowie had called him and Celia to come to the\n hospital. He&rsquo;d volunteered to sit with Andi in the emergency room \nwaiting room, while his wife and son-in-law were with Bex.<br/></p><p>Andi looked up at her grandfather. &ldquo;Hey Pops.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s my girl?&rdquo; he asked, studying her sad face. &ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo;</p><p>Andi shook her head. \n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just worried about mom. It&rsquo;s too soon for the baby to come. What if\n something happens to them?&rdquo; Her eyes filled with tears. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m scared.&rdquo; \nEven though she hadn&rsquo;t been thrilled about getting a new sister before, \nshe would be devastated if anything happened to her. And she would be \ncompletely broken if anything happened to Bex. She wouldn&rsquo;t want to go \non without either of them.</p><p>Ham wrapped his arm \naround her shoulders and hugged her. &ldquo;Your mom is going to be okay, \nhoney. I know she is. Bex has always had a will of her own. She&rsquo;s a \nfighter.&rdquo; He kissed the side of her head. &ldquo;So don&rsquo;t you worry. It might \nnot even be anything serious at all.&rdquo;<br/></p><p>Andi rested her head against Ham&rsquo;s arm. Her grandfather could always comfort her when she was afraid. &ldquo;Thanks Pops.&rdquo; <br/></p><p>Finally, after what felt like hours, Bowie came back to the waiting room. Andi sat up straight. &ldquo;What happened? Where&rsquo;s mom?&rdquo; <br/></p><p>Bowie sat down next to \nAndi. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s going to be fine, baby,&rdquo; he assured her, giving her a hug. \n&ldquo;She&rsquo;s okay. It was just Braxton Hicks.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Andi asked shakily. &ldquo;Is the baby okay?&rdquo;<br/></p><p>&ldquo;The baby is fine,&rdquo; he \nnodded. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just her body practicing for real labor. It&rsquo;s perfectly \nnormal. She had to use the bathroom, but she&rsquo;ll be out in a minute.&rdquo; He \nlooked back at the doorway. &ldquo;In fact, here she comes now.&rdquo;</p><p>Bex walked into the \nwaiting room with Cece holding her by the arm. She seemed perfectly \nhealthy. Andi exhaled a deep sigh of relief. &ldquo;Mom!&rdquo; she cried. She \njumped up to hug Bex as if she&rsquo;d never let her go.<br/></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I scared you, kiddo,&rdquo; Bex said, taking her daughter&rsquo;s face between her hands. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; Andi told her, burying her face in her shoulder. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just glad you&rsquo;re okay.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not only okay, I&rsquo;m starving!&rdquo; Bex smiled, tousling Andi&rsquo;s hair. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s up for pizza?&rdquo;</p><p>****</p><p>Andi and her parents \nwere just picking up their take-out pizza when Andi&rsquo;s cell phone rang. \nShe looked at the screen. It was Amber. Why would Amber be calling her? \n&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo; she said, answering the call.</p><p>&ldquo;Andi,&rdquo; Amber said. Her voice had an odd edge to it. &ldquo;Is Avery at your house?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not at home,&rdquo; Andi told her. &ldquo;We had to take my mom to the emergency room, and we&rsquo;re getting dinner. Why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t find her anywhere,&rdquo; Amber explained in a rush. &ldquo;I thought she might have went to visit you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m on my way home,&rdquo; Andi replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure she didn&rsquo;t go far. I&rsquo;ll help you find her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Please hurry,&rdquo; Amber said, before hanging up.<br/></p><p>Andi ended the call and turned to her mom and dad. &ldquo;I have to get home.

Do you feel it?\u201d</p><p>Andi\u2019s eyes widened when\n the baby rewarded her with a hard kick. \u201cThat\u2019s so cool,\u201d she breathed.\n \u201cI know there\u2019s a baby in there. But wow\u2026 there\u2019s a whole real person\n in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she grinned, squeezing Andi with her free hand.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I used \nto be small enough to fit in there,\u201d Andi said, laying her head against \nher mother, her hand still resting on her belly. \u201cIt\u2019s so weird to think\n about.\u201d</p><p>Bex patted her baby bump. \u201cYup. This is the original Andi Shack.\u201d</p><p>Andi laughed. \u201cSo, are we going to call the baby \u2018the baby\u2019 forever, or have you guys picked a name yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good question,\u201d Bex said, patting Andi\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking, Andi\u2026 and I think you should get to name her.\u201d</p><p>Andi looked up, surprised, \u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah! Why not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d she fretted. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of pressure. You and dad should choose the name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Bex asked. \u201cI \ntrust you. You\u2019re creative, and you have good taste. I want you to be a \npart of your sister\u2019s life every step of the way. Like I said, she\u2019s \nyour baby too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides,\u201d she added. \u201cYou\u2019d be doing me a favor. Your father wants to name the baby Hendrix.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cHendrix?\u201d</i> Andi wrinkled her nose.</p><p>\u201cAs in Jimi. Please save our baby from embarrassment, Andi,\u201d she teased. \u201cI\u2019m afraid his second choice will be Ringo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, can I think about the name for a while?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Bex nodded. \u201cMull it over as long as you need. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll love whatever you pick.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly Bex\u2019s face paled, and she leaned forward, squeezing her eyes shut, as her abdomen clenched with pain.<br></p><p>\u201cMom, are you okay?\u201d Andi asked, sitting up. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Her heartbeat sped up with worry. She lay her hand on her shoulder.<br></p><p>Bex took a deep breath \nthrough her mouth. Her chest felt a little tight, as if she couldn\u2019t get\n enough air. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Andi. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d<br></p><p>Andi frowned. \u201cDo you need a drink of water? Or do you want me to rub your back, or something?\u201d<br></p><p>Bex nodded, her eyes stinging. She arched her back trying to relieve the pressure. \u201cWater would be good. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>Andi hurried to the \nkitchen and filled a glass, then rushed back to give it to her mom. She \nsat down, rubbing Bex\u2019s back in slow circles, trying to sooth her.<br></p><p>\u201cThanks, Andiman.\u201d Bex \ntook a sip, trying to calm herself, without alarming Andi any more than \nshe already had. But even as the pain eased and disappeared, she wished \nBowie were home.</p><p>When the pain returned a\n few minutes later, though, she knew she couldn\u2019t ignore it. \u201cAndi, call\n your dad,\u201d she gasped. \u201cI think the baby\u2019s coming.\u201d <br></p><p>*****<br></p><p>\u201cHey, Shnoo,\u201d Ham said, \nsitting down next to Andi. Bowie had called him and Celia to come to the\n hospital. He\u2019d volunteered to sit with Andi in the emergency room \nwaiting room, while his wife and son-in-law were with Bex.<br></p><p>Andi looked up at her grandfather. \u201cHey Pops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s my girl?\u201d he asked, studying her sad face. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>Andi shook her head. \n\u201cI\u2019m just worried about mom. It\u2019s too soon for the baby to come. What if\n something happens to them?\u201d Her eyes filled with tears. \u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201d \nEven though she hadn\u2019t been thrilled about getting a new sister before, \nshe would be devastated if anything happened to her. And she would be \ncompletely broken if anything happened to Bex. She wouldn\u2019t want to go \non without either of them.</p><p>Ham wrapped his arm \naround her shoulders and hugged her. \u201cYour mom is going to be okay, \nhoney. I know she is. Bex has always had a will of her own. She\u2019s a \nfighter.\u201d He kissed the side of her head. \u201cSo don\u2019t you worry. It might \nnot even be anything serious at all.\u201d<br></p><p>Andi rested her head against Ham\u2019s arm. Her grandfather could always comfort her when she was afraid. \u201cThanks Pops.\u201d <br></p><p>Finally, after what felt like hours, Bowie came back to the waiting room. Andi sat up straight. \u201cWhat happened? Where\u2019s mom?\u201d <br></p><p>Bowie sat down next to \nAndi. \u201cShe\u2019s going to be fine, baby,\u201d he assured her, giving her a hug. \n\u201cShe\u2019s okay. It was just Braxton Hicks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Andi asked shakily. \u201cIs the baby okay?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThe baby is fine,\u201d he \nnodded. \u201cIt\u2019s just her body practicing for real labor. It\u2019s perfectly \nnormal. She had to use the bathroom, but she\u2019ll be out in a minute.\u201d He \nlooked back at the doorway. \u201cIn fact, here she comes now.\u201d</p><p>Bex walked into the \nwaiting room with Cece holding her by the arm. She seemed perfectly \nhealthy. Andi exhaled a deep sigh of relief. \u201cMom!\u201d she cried. She \njumped up to hug Bex as if she\u2019d never let her go.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I scared you, kiddo,\u201d Bex said, taking her daughter\u2019s face between her hands. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d Andi told her, burying her face in her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m just glad you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not only okay, I\u2019m starving!\u201d Bex smiled, tousling Andi\u2019s hair. \u201cWho\u2019s up for pizza?\u201d</p><p>****</p><p>Andi and her parents \nwere just picking up their take-out pizza when Andi\u2019s cell phone rang. \nShe looked at the screen. It was Amber. Why would Amber be calling her? \n\u201cHello?\u201d she said, answering the call.</p><p>\u201cAndi,\u201d Amber said. Her voice had an odd edge to it. \u201cIs Avery at your house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not at home,\u201d Andi told her. \u201cWe had to take my mom to the emergency room, and we\u2019re getting dinner. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t find her anywhere,\u201d Amber explained in a rush. \u201cI thought she might have went to visit you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m on my way home,\u201d Andi replied. \u201cI\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t go far. I\u2019ll help you find her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease hurry,\u201d Amber said, before hanging up.<br></p><p>Andi ended the call and turned to her mom and dad. \u201cI have to get home. Amber can\u2019t find Avery.\u201d<br></p>",
