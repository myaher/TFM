BUT&hellip;. the part where all the women gather up on the battlefield really was so good for me</li><li>i was surprised at the end that cap gave the shield to sam and not bucky bc thats what we all thought. good for sam tho he deserves that</li><li>HOWEVER i thought that scene was hella weird with bucky like \u201cgo ahead sam&hellip;\u201d like he wasnt friends with steve??? like he was really his best friend since childhood and everything and he was like oh you just go like you know you can BOTH go talk to him right???</li><li>cap really was just. so sexy in this. the hammer. the lightning. the scene in the elevator where he says heil hydra??? HES SO DAMN SMART AND HOT PLEASE!!! LET ME GET AT AMERICAS ASS!!!</li><li>also. i got REAL heated during the time travel talk for two reasons:</li><li>one: bruce was acting like he knew the rules of how time travel worked and what they should/shouldnt do. the whole POINT was that they werent sure how it would turn out like HUH</li><li>two: they really named off like 30 time travel movies. and they didnt include 13 going on 30. come ON that would have been funny. and you cant tell me that it would be a paradox bc of mark ruffalo bc in those 30 movies and the huge cast of the mcu theres no way there isnt any crossover of actors</li><li>and because we all hated it: joe russo you really should choke you want us all to suck your dick bc gAy rEpREseNtATiOn1!!! but your cameo was just bad</li><li>also idk i just thought it was really funny during tonys funeral that the kid from iron man 2 or whatever was just like. there. like i dont remember what he looks like i had to think back so hard like who the FUCK is this random dude</li><li>and his funeral was also funny bc everyone is dressed normally then it gets to okoye in her bomb ass slit top dress and i was like REALLY GET IT QUEEN!! fucking THEN carol is in her pantsuit and im like YES!!! BE THE FUCKIN HOTTIES AT THIS FUNERAL!!! GET IT GIRLS!!!</li></ul><p>okay i think im done for now lmao if you read that all you are entitled to all of my possessions when i die</p>",
