I&rsquo;ve been having a bit of trouble with writers block recently so hopefully this will satisfy you guys until I can get something a bit longer out!\u00a0</p><p><b><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/15631536\" target=\"_blank\">Read it on AO3</a></b></p><p>-</p><p>Phil didn\u2019t mind being the third wheel typically. He knew that he wasn\u2019t nearly as loud as his friends were when it came to conversation. He was much more of a listener than a talker, sometimes not really knowing what kinds of words to say that could possibly explain his plethora of thoughts. </p><p>He didn\u2019t mind being the third wheel, because being the third wheel didn\u2019t mean that his friends didn\u2019t care for him or wanted to purposefully leave him out. He knew for a fact that his friends loved him just as much as he loved them, that they would probably die for him if they had to. In fact, his two best friends, Gabii and Maggie, had declared him as their very own Lesbian Father for putting up with public displays of affection and for not holding it against them when they accidentally ignored him in favour of each other\u2019s company. \n\n</p><p>So yeah. Phil didn\u2019t mind. He was glad he could be a lesbian father. It felt <i>right</i> in a way that things often didn\u2019t. He liked to proudly stand to the side, applauding Gabii and Maggie as they kissed in public, occasionally telling onlookers that those were <i>his</i> gays. Right there! Being all happy and shit! He loved his gays.</p><!-- more --><p>However, there were moments that it absolutely <i>sucked</i> being a single, adoptive father of two. </p><p>For example, it really sucked when people were stuck in their heteronormative ways and thought that <i>he</i> was the one dating one of the girls and not the other way around. It really sucked when people asked him how the hot threesomes were. But most importantly, it really sucked when the three of them went to an amusement park together and Phil had to ride by himself on the majority of the rides because he only had two friends and he wasn\u2019t that dick bag who would dare to tear apart a good couple of gays. </p><p>\u201cSorry, Phil,\u201d Maggie whined, pouting her cherry red lip at him. She tightened her arm around Gabii\u2019s waist despite the fact that they were both horribly sweaty from being outside. \u201cI really hate making you ride with someone random.\u201d</p><p>Phil shrugged his shoulders and ran a hand through his hair, grimacing at the wetness on his forehead. He could feel his face practically baking in the sun and had no doubt that he was going to have a hideous sunburn on his face, the imprint of sunglasses perfectly atop his nose. \u201cIt\u2019s really not a big deal,\u201d he assured his friends. And it wasn\u2019t a big deal. He was just antisocial. \u201cHaving to ride with a random person here and there doesn\u2019t make the amusement park any less fun, I promise.\u201d </p><p>They were currently in line for one of the biggest roller coasters in the park, one with a giant drop and twists and turns. Phil was also pretty sure that it went upside down as well, despite the fact that Gabii had assured him that it didn\u2019t. He was a pretty big wimp when it came to rides, but normally he could hold it in. His nerves were running thin from the last roller coaster, though, something that went from zero to one hundred in like three seconds or something horrible like that. Phil typically didn\u2019t feel like crying after a ride, but that one was on thin fucking ice.</p><p>\u201cWe need to set you up with someone,\u201d Gabii sighed. Her eyeliner was smudged at the corners of her eyes, like it was trying to melt off of her face. There was a black streak on her cheek. Nobody told her. \u201cA roller coaster buddy. Kind of like a friend with benefits except the benefit is just riding roller coasters with you.\u201d</p><p>Phil snorted and Maggie kissed Gabii\u2019s cheek, smiling widely and murmuring a soft, \u201cyou\u2019re so smart babe, that\u2019s exactly what it\u2019s like.\u201d</p><p>They lined up in the queue, only a ride or two away from their imminent deaths, Phil holding back for a moment as he scanned his eyes over the crowd. He always hated this part, the searching that came with a third wheel, trying to find someone who would ride with him. He knew that he didn\u2019t <i>have</i> to find someone to ride with him, that he could go alone, but Phil was a giant wimp and would probably shit himself otherwise, so he did what he had to do.</p><p>There was a group behind them, talking loudly about dogs, and Phil could get behind that. He ran his eyes over them, tried to figure out if there was an odd one out. He counted the number of people in his head, noting that there were five people there - uneven, more friends than Phil could ever hope for. One of the guys\u2019, one with curly brown hair and dimples that lasted for days, seemed to be observing the rest of the conversation with a fond smile. He put in a word here and there, something about how he would die for any dog, but otherwise kept to himself. </p><p>Phil pounced before he could talk himself out of it.  </p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d he started, and to his dismay, the man\u2019s entire group of friends quieted and turned their eyes to him. He shuffled uncomfortably under their gazes, feeling Gabii and Maggie staring at him as well. So many eyes on him made his heart pound and his palms sweat, especially when he had a moment of terrible realisation that the guy he was asking was actually <i>extremely attractive</i> and Phil was just standing there like a string bean.</p><p>The man seemed surprised, a bit on the confused side, and his dimples caved in as he gave Phil a hesitant but kind smile. \u201cHi?\u201d he asked, and even though they were the same height, Phil felt as though he were towering over him. </p><p>Phil took in a deep breath, ignoring everyone else around him as he focused his question on the man. Just a simple question, that\u2019s all it was. And then he could be done, they could ride the stupid coaster together, and then Phil would never have to see him again. Simple. So why the hell did he feel like he was going to puke out all the candy floss he\u2019d eaten thirty minutes beforehand? Digging his nails into his thigh, Phil told himself to suck it up and opened his extremely dry mouth. \u201cI don\u2019t have enough friends so I was wondering if you wanted to ride the coaster with me?\u201d </p><p>Normally the silence wasn\u2019t this deafening, and it was with a dawning horror that Phil understood the words that had just come out of his mouth. He wasn\u2019t exactly the most smooth person in the world, especially around attractive guys that made Phil absolutely sure of his sexuality, but normally he had more game than <i>this</i>. Normally he didn\u2019t make it sound like he was the biggest loser in the world with no friends. \n\n</p><p>Good going, Phil. He told himself that he was never going to ride the coaster with anyone ever again and would just succumb to his fate of being a lone rider. </p><p>But then the guy was smiling, letting out a loud laugh, and nodding his head. A strand of curly hair fell into his eyes and he brushed it away with long fingers. Oh dear, Phil had always been a sucker for long fingers. Literally and figuratively. \u201cSure, why not?\u201d he said and came to stand next to Phil in line. </p><p>They chatted a little bit as they waited for their turn, just a quick exchange of pleasantries so they could know who they were going to be riding with. His name was Dan and he was twenty, a whole four years younger than Phil. Dan took this to his advantage and kept making jokes about how Phil was actually his dad in disguise. As soon as the words \u2018roller coaster daddy\u2019 came out of Dan\u2019s mouth, Phil knew he\u2019d made a dire mistake.</p><p>But there was no going back now because it was their turn to get on the coaster, and Phil could practically feel his entire body turn into gel. His hands were shaking as he buckled himself in, despite Dan\u2019s friendly chatter, and he couldn\u2019t focus on any of the words that were spouting from Dan\u2019s mouth right then. One of Dan\u2019s friends, a male with terrible bright orange hair, was talking animatedly to his friend about how this exact ride had stopped working before, leaving the riders upside down for thirty minutes before they finally fixed it. \n\n</p><p>The only thing Phil was thinking was that he was going to die. All because he couldn\u2019t turn Gabii or Maggie down when they gave him those puppy dog eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, dude?\u201d Dan asked casually as a worker started checking everyone\u2019s belts. Dan\u2019s eyes were warm and concerned, probably noting the way that Phil had suddenly turned quiet and subdued. Or maybe he had noticed the shivers wracking Phil\u2019s entire body. \n\n</p><p>Phil tried to let out a nonchalant laugh, but it came out squeaky. \u201cFine! Totally fine, nothing to see here,\u201d he choked out. </p><p>An announcement came over the speakers for everyone to keep their hands and feet inside of the death trap, and Dan was telling Phil that he didn\u2019t <i>have</i> to ride it if he was scared. Except, just as Phil was debating getting off, the coaster lurched forward and Phil\u2019s head slammed against the seat. \n\n</p><p>He may have blacked out for a second, but he can\u2019t be completely sure, because when he came to, he was still on the coaster, screams coming out of his mouth as they got tossed around. Dan was making a high-pitched giggly screeching noise next to him that sounded suspiciously like a hyena and Phil was going to <i>die</i>, he was absolutely sure of it.</p><p>He barely noticed as he reached out and grabbed Dan\u2019s hand in his own, as though he were attempting to gain back a semblance of hope for his survival. Dan didn\u2019t complain, or maybe the action was just lost in the disarray of the ride, and instead just let Phil clutch his hand like it was his absolute last life line. His hand was sweaty in his own, but warm, and he squeezed Phil\u2019s hand back so tightly that Phil was sure his hand was going to break. </p><p>But it was nice and it grounded him just a tiny bit as they skid to a sudden halt, the coaster slowing down as the ride came to an end. </p><p>Phil was alive, he wasn\u2019t dead, although it certainly felt like he was. His lungs were practically screeching for air and his neck was hurting, his head was spinning, and Dan looked like a wind-blown angel with an actual halo sitting next to him. \n\n</p><p>He got off the ride with the help of Dan, who he hadn\u2019t been able to let go of just yet. Maybe once the shock of the ride wore off, he would realise that he\u2019s being embarrassing, but Dan was patient with him, helping him out of the death trip and leading him down the ramp and towards where their friends were waiting for them. \n\n</p><p>Phil briefly noticed that Gabii and Maggie were fitting right into Dan\u2019s little group, talking and giggling with them like they\u2019d known each other their entire lives. He was starting to calm down, just a little bit. Enough to focus on the warm steadiness of Dan\u2019s hand in his, how he was gently speaking in his ear about how Phil had been so brave on the ride and how he could sit out with Phil on the next ride if he needed him to. </p><p>Dan, a complete stranger. Holding his hand and comforting Phil in a way that old friends do. Phil was maybe, possibly a lot gay. </p><p>Their friends all gave them a knowing look as they joined the group, eyes flickering down to their entwined hands, but otherwise they didn\u2019t say anything. They began to walk, chattering about the other rides they wanted to go on, and it seemed entirely like Dan\u2019s group had adopted Phil\u2019s with little to no complaint. </p><p>When Phil could finally breathe again, he moved to slip his hand out of Dan\u2019s grip, but Dan only tightened his fingers, making it so that Phil couldn\u2019t just yet. The grip was still loose enough that Phil could break away if he wanted to, but Phil wasn\u2019t dumb and he recognised a suggestion when he saw one. \n\n</p><p>A blush that wasn\u2019t from the sun painted over Phil\u2019s cheekbones and he ducked his head, embarrassed. \u201cThank you,\u201d he started shyly. \u201cFor, you know, all this.\u201d He squeezed Dan\u2019s hand to show what he meant, and Dan seemed to have no plans to let go of him just yet. \n\nYeah, Phil was super fucking gay.</p><p>\u201cI really didn\u2019t mind at all,\u201d Dan told him softly. \u201cYou have nice hands.\u201d</p><p>Phil snorted. \u201cThat\u2019s quite the pick-up line there, Dan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell is it working?\u201d \n\n</p><p>Phil took in Dan\u2019s broad smile, the dimples in his cheek, the freckles dancing across his nose. \u201cYeah,\u201d he admitted. \u201cYeah, it is.\u201d</p><p>Their friends stopped ahead of them and they turned their attention to the ride they\u2019d come to a stop in front of. All of Phil\u2019s blood drained from his face at the sight of <i>The Destroyer</i>, yet another coaster that went upside down. The screams from the riders sounded like a murder scene from a horror movie. \n\n</p><p>\u201cYou wanna ride this one, guys?\u201d One of Dan\u2019s friends called back to them.</p><p>Dan looked at Phil and his face softened into a smile, one that was just a little bit shy and a lot of fond. His thumb stroked the back of Phil\u2019s hand, causing a shiver to run up Phil\u2019s back. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to sit this one out,\u201d Dan replied.</p>",

He loved his gays.</p>[[MORE]]<p>However, there were moments that it absolutely <i>sucked</i> being a single, adoptive father of two. </p><p>For example, it really sucked when people were stuck in their heteronormative ways and thought that <i>he</i> was the one dating one of the girls and not the other way around. It really sucked when people asked him how the hot threesomes were. But most importantly, it really sucked when the three of them went to an amusement park together and Phil had to ride by himself on the majority of the rides because he only had two friends and he wasn\u2019t that dick bag who would dare to tear apart a good couple of gays. </p><p>\u201cSorry, Phil,\u201d Maggie whined, pouting her cherry red lip at him. She tightened her arm around Gabii\u2019s waist despite the fact that they were both horribly sweaty from being outside. \u201cI really hate making you ride with someone random.\u201d</p><p>Phil shrugged his shoulders and ran a hand through his hair, grimacing at the wetness on his forehead. He could feel his face practically baking in the sun and had no doubt that he was going to have a hideous sunburn on his face, the imprint of sunglasses perfectly atop his nose. \u201cIt\u2019s really not a big deal,\u201d he assured his friends. And it wasn\u2019t a big deal. He was just antisocial. \u201cHaving to ride with a random person here and there doesn\u2019t make the amusement park any less fun, I promise.\u201d </p><p>They were currently in line for one of the biggest roller coasters in the park, one with a giant drop and twists and turns. Phil was also pretty sure that it went upside down as well, despite the fact that Gabii had assured him that it didn\u2019t. He was a pretty big wimp when it came to rides, but normally he could hold it in. His nerves were running thin from the last roller coaster, though, something that went from zero to one hundred in like three seconds or something horrible like that. Phil typically didn\u2019t feel like crying after a ride, but that one was on thin fucking ice.</p><p>\u201cWe need to set you up with someone,\u201d Gabii sighed. Her eyeliner was smudged at the corners of her eyes, like it was trying to melt off of her face. There was a black streak on her cheek. Nobody told her. \u201cA roller coaster buddy. Kind of like a friend with benefits except the benefit is just riding roller coasters with you.\u201d</p><p>Phil snorted and Maggie kissed Gabii\u2019s cheek, smiling widely and murmuring a soft, \u201cyou\u2019re so smart babe, that\u2019s exactly what it\u2019s like.\u201d</p><p>They lined up in the queue, only a ride or two away from their imminent deaths, Phil holding back for a moment as he scanned his eyes over the crowd. He always hated this part, the searching that came with a third wheel, trying to find someone who would ride with him. He knew that he didn\u2019t <i>have</i> to find someone to ride with him, that he could go alone, but Phil was a giant wimp and would probably shit himself otherwise, so he did what he had to do.</p><p>There was a group behind them, talking loudly about dogs, and Phil could get behind that. He ran his eyes over them, tried to figure out if there was an odd one out. He counted the number of people in his head, noting that there were five people there - uneven, more friends than Phil could ever hope for. One of the guys\u2019, one with curly brown hair and dimples that lasted for days, seemed to be observing the rest of the conversation with a fond smile. He put in a word here and there, something about how he would die for any dog, but otherwise kept to himself. </p><p>Phil pounced before he could talk himself out of it.  </p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d he started, and to his dismay, the man\u2019s entire group of friends quieted and turned their eyes to him. He shuffled uncomfortably under their gazes, feeling Gabii and Maggie staring at him as well.

He knew that he wasn\u2019t nearly as loud as his friends were when it came to conversation. He was much more of a listener than a talker, sometimes not really knowing what kinds of words to say that could possibly explain his plethora of thoughts. </p><p>He didn\u2019t mind being the third wheel, because being the third wheel didn\u2019t mean that his friends didn\u2019t care for him or wanted to purposefully leave him out. He knew for a fact that his friends loved him just as much as he loved them, that they would probably die for him if they had to. In fact, his two best friends, Gabii and Maggie, had declared him as their very own Lesbian Father for putting up with public displays of affection and for not holding it against them when they accidentally ignored him in favour of each other\u2019s company. \n\n</p><p>So yeah. Phil didn\u2019t mind. He was glad he could be a lesbian father. It felt <i>right</i> in a way that things often didn\u2019t. He liked to proudly stand to the side, applauding Gabii and Maggie as they kissed in public, occasionally telling onlookers that those were <i>his</i> gays. Right there! Being all happy and shit! He loved his gays.</p>[[MORE]]<p>However, there were moments that it absolutely <i>sucked</i> being a single, adoptive father of two. </p><p>For example, it really sucked when people were stuck in their heteronormative ways and thought that <i>he</i> was the one dating one of the girls and not the other way around. It really sucked when people asked him how the hot threesomes were. But most importantly, it really sucked when the three of them went to an amusement park together and Phil had to ride by himself on the majority of the rides because he only had two friends and he wasn\u2019t that dick bag who would dare to tear apart a good couple of gays. </p><p>\u201cSorry, Phil,\u201d Maggie whined, pouting her cherry red lip at him. She tightened her arm around Gabii\u2019s waist despite the fact that they were both horribly sweaty from being outside. \u201cI really hate making you ride with someone random.\u201d</p><p>Phil shrugged his shoulders and ran a hand through his hair, grimacing at the wetness on his forehead. He could feel his face practically baking in the sun and had no doubt that he was going to have a hideous sunburn on his face, the imprint of sunglasses perfectly atop his nose. \u201cIt\u2019s really not a big deal,\u201d he assured his friends. And it wasn\u2019t a big deal. He was just antisocial. \u201cHaving to ride with a random person here and there doesn\u2019t make the amusement park any less fun, I promise.\u201d </p><p>They were currently in line for one of the biggest roller coasters in the park, one with a giant drop and twists and turns. Phil was also pretty sure that it went upside down as well, despite the fact that Gabii had assured him that it didn\u2019t. He was a pretty big wimp when it came to rides, but normally he could hold it in. His nerves were running thin from the last roller coaster, though, something that went from zero to one hundred in like three seconds or something horrible like that. Phil typically didn\u2019t feel like crying after a ride, but that one was on thin fucking ice.</p><p>\u201cWe need to set you up with someone,\u201d Gabii sighed. Her eyeliner was smudged at the corners of her eyes, like it was trying to melt off of her face. There was a black streak on her cheek. Nobody told her. \u201cA roller coaster buddy. Kind of like a friend with benefits except the benefit is just riding roller coasters with you.\u201d</p><p>Phil snorted and Maggie kissed Gabii\u2019s cheek, smiling widely and murmuring a soft, \u201cyou\u2019re so smart babe, that\u2019s exactly what it\u2019s like.\u201d</p><p>They lined up in the queue, only a ride or two away from their imminent deaths, Phil holding back for a moment as he scanned his eyes over the crowd. He always hated this part, the searching that came with a third wheel, trying to find someone who would ride with him. He knew that he didn\u2019t <i>have</i> to find someone to ride with him, that he could go alone, but Phil was a giant wimp and would probably shit himself otherwise, so he did what he had to do.</p><p>There was a group behind them, talking loudly about dogs, and Phil could get behind that. He ran his eyes over them, tried to figure out if there was an odd one out. He counted the number of people in his head, noting that there were five people there - uneven, more friends than Phil could ever hope for. One of the guys\u2019, one with curly brown hair and dimples that lasted for days, seemed to be observing the rest of the conversation with a fond smile. He put in a word here and there, something about how he would die for any dog, but otherwise kept to himself. </p><p>Phil pounced before he could talk himself out of it.  </p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d he started, and to his dismay, the man\u2019s entire group of friends quieted and turned their eyes to him. He shuffled uncomfortably under their gazes, feeling Gabii and Maggie staring at him as well. So many eyes on him made his heart pound and his palms sweat, especially when he had a moment of terrible realisation that the guy he was asking was actually <i>extremely attractive</i> and Phil was just standing there like a string bean.</p><p>The man seemed surprised, a bit on the confused side, and his dimples caved in as he gave Phil a hesitant but kind smile. \u201cHi?\u201d he asked, and even though they were the same height, Phil felt as though he were towering over him. </p><p>Phil took in a deep breath, ignoring everyone else around him as he focused his question on the man. Just a simple question, that\u2019s all it was. And then he could be done, they could ride the stupid coaster together, and then Phil would never have to see him again. Simple. So why the hell did he feel like he was going to puke out all the candy floss he\u2019d eaten thirty minutes beforehand? Digging his nails into his thigh, Phil told himself to suck it up and opened his extremely dry mouth. \u201cI don\u2019t have enough friends so I was wondering if you wanted to ride the coaster with me?\u201d </p><p>Normally the silence wasn\u2019t this deafening, and it was with a dawning horror that Phil understood the words that had just come out of his mouth. He wasn\u2019t exactly the most smooth person in the world, especially around attractive guys that made Phil absolutely sure of his sexuality, but normally he had more game than <i>this</i>. Normally he didn\u2019t make it sound like he was the biggest loser in the world with no friends. \n\n</p><p>Good going, Phil. He told himself that he was never going to ride the coaster with anyone ever again and would just succumb to his fate of being a lone rider. </p><p>But then the guy was smiling, letting out a loud laugh, and nodding his head. A strand of curly hair fell into his eyes and he brushed it away with long fingers. Oh dear, Phil had always been a sucker for long fingers. Literally and figuratively. \u201cSure, why not?\u201d he said and came to stand next to Phil in line. </p><p>They chatted a little bit as they waited for their turn, just a quick exchange of pleasantries so they could know who they were going to be riding with. His name was Dan and he was twenty, a whole four years younger than Phil. Dan took this to his advantage and kept making jokes about how Phil was actually his dad in disguise. As soon as the words \u2018roller coaster daddy\u2019 came out of Dan\u2019s mouth, Phil knew he\u2019d made a dire mistake.</p><p>But there was no going back now because it was their turn to get on the coaster, and Phil could practically feel his entire body turn into gel. His hands were shaking as he buckled himself in, despite Dan\u2019s friendly chatter, and he couldn\u2019t focus on any of the words that were spouting from Dan\u2019s mouth right then. One of Dan\u2019s friends, a male with terrible bright orange hair, was talking animatedly to his friend about how this exact ride had stopped working before, leaving the riders upside down for thirty minutes before they finally fixed it. \n\n</p><p>The only thing Phil was thinking was that he was going to die. All because he couldn\u2019t turn Gabii or Maggie down when they gave him those puppy dog eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, dude?\u201d Dan asked casually as a worker started checking everyone\u2019s belts. Dan\u2019s eyes were warm and concerned, probably noting the way that Phil had suddenly turned quiet and subdued. Or maybe he had noticed the shivers wracking Phil\u2019s entire body. \n\n</p><p>Phil tried to let out a nonchalant laugh, but it came out squeaky. \u201cFine! Totally fine, nothing to see here,\u201d he choked out. </p><p>An announcement came over the speakers for everyone to keep their hands and feet inside of the death trap, and Dan was telling Phil that he didn\u2019t <i>have</i> to ride it if he was scared. Except, just as Phil was debating getting off, the coaster lurched forward and Phil\u2019s head slammed against the seat. \n\n</p><p>He may have blacked out for a second, but he can\u2019t be completely sure, because when he came to, he was still on the coaster, screams coming out of his mouth as they got tossed around. Dan was making a high-pitched giggly screeching noise next to him that sounded suspiciously like a hyena and Phil was going to <i>die</i>, he was absolutely sure of it.</p><p>He barely noticed as he reached out and grabbed Dan\u2019s hand in his own, as though he were attempting to gain back a semblance of hope for his survival. Dan didn\u2019t complain, or maybe the action was just lost in the disarray of the ride, and instead just let Phil clutch his hand like it was his absolute last life line. His hand was sweaty in his own, but warm, and he squeezed Phil\u2019s hand back so tightly that Phil was sure his hand was going to break. </p><p>But it was nice and it grounded him just a tiny bit as they skid to a sudden halt, the coaster slowing down as the ride came to an end. </p><p>Phil was alive, he wasn\u2019t dead, although it certainly felt like he was. His lungs were practically screeching for air and his neck was hurting, his head was spinning, and Dan looked like a wind-blown angel with an actual halo sitting next to him. \n\n</p><p>He got off the ride with the help of Dan, who he hadn\u2019t been able to let go of just yet. Maybe once the shock of the ride wore off, he would realise that he\u2019s being embarrassing, but Dan was patient with him, helping him out of the death trip and leading him down the ramp and towards where their friends were waiting for them. \n\n</p><p>Phil briefly noticed that Gabii and Maggie were fitting right into Dan\u2019s little group, talking and giggling with them like they\u2019d known each other their entire lives. He was starting to calm down, just a little bit. Enough to focus on the warm steadiness of Dan\u2019s hand in his, how he was gently speaking in his ear about how Phil had been so brave on the ride and how he could sit out with Phil on the next ride if he needed him to. </p><p>Dan, a complete stranger. Holding his hand and comforting Phil in a way that old friends do. Phil was maybe, possibly a lot gay. </p><p>Their friends all gave them a knowing look as they joined the group, eyes flickering down to their entwined hands, but otherwise they didn\u2019t say anything. They began to walk, chattering about the other rides they wanted to go on, and it seemed entirely like Dan\u2019s group had adopted Phil\u2019s with little to no complaint. </p><p>When Phil could finally breathe again, he moved to slip his hand out of Dan\u2019s grip, but Dan only tightened his fingers, making it so that Phil couldn\u2019t just yet. The grip was still loose enough that Phil could break away if he wanted to, but Phil wasn\u2019t dumb and he recognised a suggestion when he saw one. \n\n</p><p>A blush that wasn\u2019t from the sun painted over Phil\u2019s cheekbones and he ducked his head, embarrassed. \u201cThank you,\u201d he started shyly. \u201cFor, you know, all this.\u201d He squeezed Dan\u2019s hand to show what he meant, and Dan seemed to have no plans to let go of him just yet. \n\nYeah, Phil was super fucking gay.</p><p>\u201cI really didn\u2019t mind at all,\u201d Dan told him softly. \u201cYou have nice hands.\u201d</p><p>Phil snorted. \u201cThat\u2019s quite the pick-up line there, Dan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell is it working?\u201d \n\n</p><p>Phil took in Dan\u2019s broad smile, the dimples in his cheek, the freckles dancing across his nose. \u201cYeah,\u201d he admitted. \u201cYeah, it is.\u201d</p><p>Their friends stopped ahead of them and they turned their attention to the ride they\u2019d come to a stop in front of. All of Phil\u2019s blood drained from his face at the sight of <i>The Destroyer</i>, yet another coaster that went upside down. The screams from the riders sounded like a murder scene from a horror movie. \n\n</p><p>\u201cYou wanna ride this one, guys?\u201d One of Dan\u2019s friends called back to them.</p><p>Dan looked at Phil and his face softened into a smile, one that was just a little bit shy and a lot of fond. His thumb stroked the back of Phil\u2019s hand, causing a shiver to run up Phil\u2019s back. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to sit this one out,\u201d Dan replied.</p>",

He was much more of a listener than a talker, sometimes not really knowing what kinds of words to say that could possibly explain his plethora of thoughts. </p>\n<p>He didn&rsquo;t mind being the third wheel, because being the third wheel didn&rsquo;t mean that his friends didn&rsquo;t care for him or wanted to purposefully leave him out. He knew for a fact that his friends loved him just as much as he loved them, that they would probably die for him if they had to. In fact, his two best friends, Gabii and Maggie, had declared him as their very own Lesbian Father for putting up with public displays of affection and for not holding it against them when they accidentally ignored him in favour of each other&rsquo;s company. \n\n</p>\n<p>So yeah. Phil didn&rsquo;t mind. He was glad he could be a lesbian father. It felt <i>right</i> in a way that things often didn&rsquo;t. He liked to proudly stand to the side, applauding Gabii and Maggie as they kissed in public, occasionally telling onlookers that those were <i>his</i> gays. Right there! Being all happy and shit! He loved his gays.</p>\n</p>",
