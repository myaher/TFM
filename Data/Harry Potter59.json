The man in charge mumbled something about there not being enough resources to help everyone, when Minerva released her wrath on him. </p><p>But she was also horrified when she asked the Slytherins why they&rsquo;d never said anything about it, and most of them answered, <i>we didn&rsquo;t expect anyone cared about us enough to incude us. We&rsquo;ve been used to doing everything on our own for years. </i></p><p>Meanwhile Hermione had designed a rotationg schedule with a spot for everyone who cared for Draco, so they all got a chance to talk to him through the churtains. </p><p>Pansy cried in Harry&rsquo;s arms after two days of no movement. Harry cried along with her. </p><p>That was when Narcissa came in. Banished from the UK, it had taken a lot of time to finally get her to Hogwarts. Once she did, she wasted no time using all the old, ancient and highly illegal spells she knew to break down the barriers around her son. She didn&rsquo;t care the spell use could put her in Azkaban. </p><p>She did care about what would happen once she broke through the walls. Her son was not to be moved, but calmed down and fed first. No one was dragging him anywhere, he deserved more respect than that.  </p><p>The spells and chants were draining her magic and physical energy. One of the healers saw the rate at which it was going and begged her to stop, to not risk her life for this when not everything else had been tried yet. </p><p>Narcissa didn&rsquo;t listen (she did marry the healer 2 years later, but that is a different story). She kept casting and casting until all the barriers were gone and she could collapse in peace. </p><p>Pansy was on the bed in an instant, wrapping herself around her best friend and whispering calming words to him. It looked like Draco was awake, but very very far away. The healers in the room cast discrete nurishing spells on him, but didn&rsquo;t interfere. </p><p>After a few minutes, Pansy turned to Harry. </p><p>&ldquo;Come here.&rdquo; She beconed him over. He obeyed. &ldquo;Cast a protection spell. Your magic is more powerful, he&rsquo;ll find it calming. Please.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry did as he was told. Then Pansy made him sit on the other side of Draco, and together they held him. Slowly, he was becoming more aware of things, softly talking about his dreams, his fears. </p><p>He was terribly embarrased by it all when he found out what had happened. Terribly concerned about his mum. Draco was a mess the following days, moving in and out of hospital to visit mind healers and his recovering mother. </p><p>He never slept alone anymore. Like it was the most natural thing in the world, Harry and Pansy joined him in bed every night, holding him, giving him the feeling of savety that he couldn&rsquo;t give himself. </p><p>After graduation, they, Ron, Hermione, Theo, Dean, Seamus, Neville and Luna and quite some others collectively moved to Grimmauld Place. Over the years some of them moved out, to start a business, a family, a marriage. </p><p>One very emotional night even Pansy told Harry and Draco she was leaving, moving in with her girlfriend Millicent. </p><p>Draco had a panic attack that night. The same one that nearly killed him in 8th year, only this time Harry was there to calm him down right away. Because it wasn&rsquo;t true everyone was leaving him. Harry would never leave him. Harry loved him. </p><p>&ldquo;You do?&rdquo; The surpirise in Draco&rsquo;s voice was heartbreaking. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes of course you silly man. I&rsquo;ve loved you for decades.&rdquo; </p><p>And that&rsquo;s how Harry and Draco, at the age of 34, finally shared their first kiss. </p>",
