Martin decidiu acabar a saga. O final da s\u00e9rie ser\u00e1 da autoria dos co-criadores e co-roteiristas de Game of Thrones, David Benioff e D.B. Weiss.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p> Na pr\u00e9via, podemos ver que Arya Stark est\u00e1 de volta \u00e0 Porto Real depois de fugir da destrui\u00e7\u00e3o causada por Daenerys Targaryen. Tamb\u00e9m podemos ver que Tyrion claramente n\u00e3o est\u00e1 feliz com o modo que Dany comandou a invas\u00e3o. Ser\u00e1 que ele finalmente acredita em Varys, sobre Dany ter enlouquecido e agora ir\u00e1 tentar tir\u00e1-la do poder?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ser\u00e1 que Dany, de fato, enlouqueceu? S\u00f3 saberemos ap\u00f3s assistir o sexto epis\u00f3dio.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"1320\" height=\"743\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qyBPzUe3hNI?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\"></iframe>\n</div></figure><h3>O que significa Dracarys em Game of Thrones?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Dracarys, em antigo valiriano, significa como \u201cfogo do drag\u00e3o\u201d. \u00c9 um comando que Daenerys usa toda vez que ela quer que seus drag\u00f5es cuspam fogo.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>O que significa Game of Thrones?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Game of Thrones</strong> significa Jogo dos Tronos, mas foi traduzido para Guerra dos Tronos quando os livros que inspiraram a s\u00e9rie, As Cr\u00f4nicas de Gelo e Fogo, foram lan\u00e7ados no Brasil.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Os livros escritos por George R.R. Martin foram usados para criar a s\u00e9rie de fantasia da HBO, lan\u00e7ada em 2011.  A s\u00e9rie fant\u00e1stica fala sobre o reino de Westeros, um pa\u00eds medieval dividido em sete reinos, nos quais diferentes fam\u00edlias dominam suas pr\u00f3prias terras.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\" data-orig-height=\"933\" data-orig-width=\"1320\" data-orig-src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.showmetech.com.br/wp-content/uploads//2019/05/GAME-OF-THRONES-S8-EP-4-PRE-AIR-IMAGES-1.jpg?w=1320&amp;ssl=1\"><img data-attachment-id=\"233644\" data-permalink=\"https://www.showmetech.com.br/game-of-thrones-o-que-aconteceu-4o-episodio/game-of-thrones-s8-ep-4-pre-air-images-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.showmetech.com.br/wp-content/uploads//2019/05/GAME-OF-THRONES-S8-EP-4-PRE-AIR-IMAGES-1.jpg?fit=2969%2C2100&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2969,2100\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"' data-image-title=\"GAME OF THRONES S8 EP 4 PRE AIR IMAGES (1)\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Dany planeja os pr\u00f3ximos passos para conquistar o Trono de Ferro.&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.showmetech.com.br/wp-content/uploads//2019/05/GAME-OF-THRONES-S8-EP-4-PRE-AIR-IMAGES-1.jpg?fit=320%2C190&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.showmetech.com.br/wp-content/uploads//2019/05/GAME-OF-THRONES-S8-EP-4-PRE-AIR-IMAGES-1.jpg?fit=720%2C509&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/027dbe4de162c75b7cb307289a7760ee/tumblr_inline_prq2uwJz7h1tr5lp6_540.jpg\" alt=\"Cena do quarto epis\u00f3dio da oitava temporada de Game of Thrones.\" class=\"wp-image-233644\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.showmetech.com.br/wp-content/uploads//2019/05/GAME-OF-THRONES-S8-EP-4-PRE-AIR-IMAGES-1.jpg?w=2969&amp;ssl=1 2969w, https://i1.wp.com/www.showmetech.com.br/wp-content/uploads//2019/05/GAME-OF-THRONES-S8-EP-4-PRE-AIR-IMAGES-1.jpg?resize=768%2C543&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.showmetech.com.br/wp-content/uploads//2019/05/GAME-OF-THRONES-S8-EP-4-PRE-AIR-IMAGES-1.jpg?resize=720%2C509&amp;ssl=1 720w, https://i2.wp.com/www.showmetech.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GAME-OF-THRONES-S8-EP-4-PRE-AIR-IMAGES-1.jpg?w=2640&amp;ssl=1 2640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1320px) 100vw, 1320px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" data-orig-height=\"933\" data-orig-width=\"1320\" data-orig-src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.showmetech.com.br/wp-content/uploads//2019/05/GAME-OF-THRONES-S8-EP-4-PRE-AIR-IMAGES-1.jpg?w=1320&amp;ssl=1\"><figcaption>Dany planeja os pr\u00f3ximos passos para conquistar o Trono de Ferro.</figcaption></figure><p>Essas fam\u00edlias lutam contra si desde que o antigo reinado da fam\u00edlia Targaryen foi exterminado.

Pouco antes de conseguir, Sandor Clegane consegue enfiar a adaga na cabe\u00e7a dele, mas n\u00e3o \u00e9 o suficiente: Gregor continua vivo.

Eu acho que \u00e9 um ponto de refer\u00eancia interessante para a personagem. E tamb\u00e9m vendo Jon depois do banquete, quando vemos como a situa\u00e7\u00e3o afetou ela.

As facadas n\u00e3o surtem efeito, ent\u00e3o a Montanha tenta matar Sandor da mesma maneira que matou Oberyn Martell. Pouco antes de conseguir, Sandor Clegane consegue enfiar a adaga na cabe\u00e7a dele, mas n\u00e3o \u00e9 o suficiente: Gregor continua vivo.

Se os filhos dele morrerem, a\u00ed sim o Trono passa para seus irm\u00e3os: Viserys e, depois, para Daenerys.

Martin decidiu acabar a saga. O final da s&eacute;rie ser&aacute; da autoria dos co-criadores e co-roteiristas de Game of Thrones, David Benioff e D.B. Weiss.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p> Na pr&eacute;via, podemos ver que Arya Stark est&aacute; de volta &agrave; Porto Real depois de fugir da destrui&ccedil;&atilde;o causada por Daenerys Targaryen. Tamb&eacute;m podemos ver que Tyrion claramente n&atilde;o est&aacute; feliz com o modo que Dany comandou a invas&atilde;o. Ser&aacute; que ele finalmente acredita em Varys, sobre Dany ter enlouquecido e agora ir&aacute; tentar tir&aacute;-la do poder?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ser&aacute; que Dany, de fato, enlouqueceu? S&oacute; saberemos ap&oacute;s assistir o sexto epis&oacute;dio.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<p><a href=\"#\"><img src=\"https://assets.tumblr.com/images/inline_placeholder.png\" width=\"18\" height=\"14\"/></a></p>\n</figure><h3>O que significa Dracarys em Game of Thrones?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Dracarys, em antigo valiriano, significa como &ldquo;fogo do drag&atilde;o&rdquo;. &Eacute; um comando que Daenerys usa toda vez que ela quer que seus drag&otilde;es cuspam fogo.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>O que significa Game of Thrones?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Game of Thrones</strong> significa Jogo dos Tronos, mas foi traduzido para Guerra dos Tronos quando os livros que inspiraram a s&eacute;rie, As Cr&ocirc;nicas de Gelo e Fogo, foram lan&ccedil;ados no Brasil.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Os livros escritos por George R.R. Martin foram usados para criar a s&eacute;rie de fantasia da HBO, lan&ccedil;ada em 2011.  A s&eacute;rie fant&aacute;stica fala sobre o reino de Westeros, um pa&iacute;s medieval dividido em sete reinos, nos quais diferentes fam&iacute;lias dominam suas pr&oacute;prias terras.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/027dbe4de162c75b7cb307289a7760ee/tumblr_inline_prq2uwJz7h1tr5lp6_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/>Dany planeja os pr&oacute;ximos passos para conquistar o Trono de Ferro.</figure><p>Essas fam&iacute;lias lutam contra si desde que o antigo reinado da fam&iacute;lia Targaryen foi exterminado. O objetivo: o Trono de Ferro e poder reinar os Sete Reinos. Por isso a s&eacute;rie se chama Game of Thrones, porque &ldquo;no jogo dos tronos, voc&ecirc; ganha ou voc&ecirc; morre&rdquo;.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>O que aconteceu com a Montanha em Game of Thrones?</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4>*cont&eacute;m spoilers sobre o quinto epis&oacute;dio da oitava temporada*</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>No quinto epis&oacute;dio, tivemos o desfecho da briga entre os irm&atilde;os Clegane e que resultou na morte de Sor Gregor Clegane, a Montanha. Quando Daenerys ataca Porto Real, C&atilde;o de Ca&ccedil;a consegue chegar at&eacute; a Fortaleza Vermelha e encontrar o irm&atilde;o, que est&aacute; escoltando Cersei para fora do perigo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Depois de matar os outros guardas, Sandor Clegane luta contra o irm&atilde;o, que deixou Cersei de lado. Cersei escapa e, no castelo, finalmente reencontra Jaime. Enquanto isso, Sandor Clegane consegue enfiar a espada na Montanha, mas isso n&atilde;o para Gregor, que arranca a espada de dentro de seu est&ocirc;mago e come&ccedil;a a jogar o irm&atilde;o com for&ccedil;a contra as escadas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sor Gregor bate v&aacute;rias e v&aacute;rias vezes em Sandor Clegane, ele ent&atilde;o tira uma faca do cinto e apunhala a Montanha repetidamente. As facadas n&atilde;o surtem efeito, ent&atilde;o a Montanha tenta matar Sandor da mesma maneira que matou Oberyn Martell. Pouco antes de conseguir, Sandor Clegane consegue enfiar a adaga na cabe&ccedil;a dele, mas n&atilde;o &eacute; o suficiente: Gregor continua vivo. C&atilde;o de Ca&ccedil;a ent&atilde;o agarra o irm&atilde;o e se joga da torre com ele.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/45c744b7ca42b37a9d0ac92ffa604e94/tumblr_inline_prq2uwnYzp1tr5lp6_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/>Os irm&atilde;os Clegane se enfrentaram no pen&uacute;ltimo epis&oacute;dio.</figure><h3>Onde assistir a Game of Thrones?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>O &uacute;ltimo epis&oacute;dio de Game of Thrones ir&aacute; ao ar &agrave;s 22h de domingo e poder&aacute; ser assistido pela sua TV a cabo no canal da HBO.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Outra op&ccedil;&atilde;o &eacute; assinar a&nbsp;<strong>HBO GO</strong>, o servi&ccedil;o de streaming dos produtos da empresa.

Durante a s&eacute;rie, vemos os drag&otilde;es crescerem, principalmente&nbsp;<strong>Drogon</strong>, o drag&atilde;o preto e vermelho nomeado em homenagem ao seu marido morto.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/35b9bd2606425421f9f61a8aa65f4c73/tumblr_inline_prq2uxtMQF1tr5lp6_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rhaegal</strong>, nomeado em homenagem ao irm&atilde;o morto de Dany,&nbsp;<em>Rhaegar</em>, &eacute; o drag&atilde;o verde e bronzeado. &Eacute; o menorzinho dos tr&ecirc;s, e fica preso quando Drogon foge. Na sexta temporada, ap&oacute;s Dany desaparecer tamb&eacute;m, Rhaegal &eacute; libertado por&nbsp;<strong>Tyrion Lannister</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>J&aacute; na s&eacute;tima, ele come&ccedil;a a desenvolver uma amizade com<strong>&nbsp;Jon Snow</strong>, que o cavalga na oitava temporada. Vale lembrar que o drag&atilde;o recebeu o nome em homenagem ao pai de Jon. No entanto, Rhaegal morreu no quarto epis&oacute;dio da oitava temporada ao ser atingido pelos escorpi&otilde;es da Frota de Ferro de Euron Greyjoy.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ce0fd3eb2e498caf3d0b12066ed6fbae/tumblr_inline_prq2uyrDOB1tr5lp6_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>J&aacute; o terceiro drag&atilde;o &eacute;&nbsp;<strong>Viserion</strong>, nomeado em homenagem ao Viserys Targaryen. Ele &eacute; branco e o mais tranquilo dos drag&otilde;es de Dany, mas morre pelas m&atilde;os do Rei da Noite na s&eacute;tima temporada da s&eacute;rie.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Quantos epis&oacute;dios vai ter a oitava temporada de GoT?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A oitava temporada de Game of Thrones vai ter apenas 6 epis&oacute;dios. Mas a dura&ccedil;&atilde;o n&atilde;o deixou a desejar: o primeiro epis&oacute;dio teve 54 minutos, enquanto o segundo teve 58 minutos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>O terceiro epis&oacute;dio &eacute; o mais longo da temporada: possui 82 minutos, ou 1 hora e 22 minutos. J&aacute; o quarto possui 78 minutos, enquanto o quinto e o sexto possuem 80 minutos cada.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Onde fica o trono de ferro?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>O Trono de Ferro fica na Fortaleza Vermelha, em Porto Real.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Principais perguntas sobre a Daenerys Targaryen, nesta semana</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>O que Daenerys &eacute; de Jon Snow?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Daenerys &eacute; irm&atilde; do pai de Jon, Rhaegar Targaryen &ndash; portanto, ela &eacute; tia dele.O que acontece com Daenerys Targaryen nos livros?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Por que Daenerys merece o trono?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Porque Daenerys &eacute; a &uacute;ltima da linhagem dos Targaryen, que ocupavam o Trono de Ferro antes de Robert Baratheon usurpar a coroa de Rhaegar Targaryen.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Quem &eacute; o herdeiro oficial do trono de ferro?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>O herdeiro do Trono de Ferro, antes de Robert Baratheon matar Aerys, o Louco, e usurpar a coroa, era Rhaegar Targaryen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>O pr&iacute;ncipe era o mais velho. Seu irm&atilde;o do meio era Viserys Targaryen e sua irm&atilde; mais nova, Daenerys Targaryen. Rhaegar foi casado com Elia Martell, em uma alian&ccedil;a com Dorne. Os dois tiveram dois filhos, mas tanto Elia quanto as crian&ccedil;as foram mortos pela Montanha, Sor Gregor Clegane.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Como Rhaegar deveria ser o rei, os filhos dele s&atilde;o os herdeiros do Trono de Ferro. Se os filhos dele morrerem, a&iacute; sim o Trono passa para seus irm&atilde;os: Viserys e, depois, para Daenerys. Como Viserys foi morto por uma coroa de ouro feita por Khal Drogo, Dany se tornou a verdadeira herdeira do Trono de Ferro.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7c9456679485c30cccbcdfc6a825137d/tumblr_inline_prq2uzEfWD1tr5lp6_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>No entanto, Jon Snow &eacute; um filho bastardo de Rhaegar Targaryen &ndash; o que o colocaria como herdeiro direto do verdadeiro rei que deveria reinar depois de Aerys. No entanto, repito: Jon &eacute; um bastardo, o que faz com que o direito dele a terras e castelos seja negado. Por isso, ele n&atilde;o &eacute; o leg&iacute;timo herdeiro do Trono de Ferro e Dany, sim. Mas ainda assim, Jon Snow possui, sim, um direito pelo Trono, por ter sangue Targaryen. Se ele decidisse disputar o Trono, &eacute; esperado que o povo tome seu lado, mas, legitimamente, o direito &eacute; de Dany.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>O que Daenerys diz quando o drag&atilde;o lan&ccedil;a fogo?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Daenerys grita &ldquo;dracarys!&rdquo; toda vez que ela quer que Drogon cuspa fogo. A palavra &eacute; da l&iacute;ngua valiriana, que significa &ldquo;fogo do drag&atilde;o&rdquo;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dany adotou esse comando porque a fam&iacute;lia Targaryen veio da antiga Val&iacute;ria com os drag&otilde;es &ndash; portanto, os animais obedecem aos comandos quando ditos na l&iacute;ngua de sua terra natal. &Eacute; tipo aquela coisa de que falar alem&atilde;o para alguns c&atilde;es de da Alemanha resulta em maior obedi&ecirc;ncia, sabe?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>O que o diretor de Game of Thrones fala sobre Daenerys?</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4>*cont&eacute;m spoilers sobre o quinto epis&oacute;dio da oitava temporada*</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Devido aos acontecimentos do <a href=\"https://www.showmetech.com.br/game-of-thrones-quinto-ep-8a-temporada/\">quinto epis&oacute;dio</a> da oitava temporada de Game of Thrones, muitos f&atilde;s criticaram as a&ccedil;&otilde;es de Daenerys, que sempre pareceu uma rainha justa e defensora dos inocentes, mas que agora queimou milhares de habitantes de Porto Real.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>O diretor David Nutter, respons&aacute;vel por epis&oacute;dios como o do Casamento Vermelho, comentou sobre a atitude que pareceu repentina para os f&atilde;s da s&eacute;rie em uma entrevista para o <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/06/arts/television/game-of-thrones-david-nutter.html\">The New York Times</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A personagem dela come&ccedil;a a sentir que est&aacute; isolada. Percebendo que Jorah n&atilde;o est&aacute; mais l&aacute;. O momento que ela escuta Tormund falando sobre como Jon &eacute; um rei porque ele subiu em um drag&atilde;o e lutou em um drag&atilde;o, enquanto ela fez isso muitas vezes e n&atilde;o foi reconhecida por isso. Eu acho que &eacute; um ponto de refer&ecirc;ncia interessante para a personagem. E tamb&eacute;m vendo Jon depois do banquete, quando vemos como a situa&ccedil;&atilde;o afetou ela. Eu acho que no final daquela sequ&ecirc;ncia, ela tem um sentido real de determina&ccedil;&atilde;o que &eacute; t&atilde;o importante e poderoso.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Mas quem realmente deu  mais informa&ccedil;&otilde;es sobre como e por que Dany tomou aquela decis&atilde;o, foi um dos criadores da s&eacute;rie, D.B. Weiss. No v&iacute;deo que mostra os bastidores do epis&oacute;dio, ele explicou o que motivou Dany a fazer o que fez.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;N&atilde;o acho que ela planejou o que ela acabou fazendo. Quando ela v&ecirc; a Fortaleza Vermelha, que para ela &eacute; o lar que sua fam&iacute;lia construiu quando eles chegaram h&aacute; 300 anos, &eacute; nesse momento, nas Muralhas de Porto Real quando ela est&aacute; vendo tudo que lhe foi tirado, que ela toma a decis&atilde;o de fazer daquilo algo pessoal.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<p><a href=\"#\"><img src=\"https://assets.tumblr.com/images/inline_placeholder.png\" width=\"18\" height=\"14\"/></a></p>\n</figure><h3>A Daenerys teve um filho com Drogo?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sim, ela teve. Mas a hist&oacute;ria &eacute; mais complicada que isso: Dany estava gr&aacute;vida de Drogo quando o Khal foi ferido.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>O ferimento era pouco, mas Dany implorou para que Khal Drogo deixasse uma bruxa/curandeira cuidar dele. Essa bruxa foi salva por Dany de um estupro, ap&oacute;s o khalasar invadir uma cidade. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ap&oacute;s a mulher tratar do Khal, a ferida de Drogo infeccionou e ele foi piorando cada vez mais, fazendo com que ele fique a beira da morte. At&eacute; que ela sugeriu uma magia de sangue: eles matariam um cavalo para que a vida do animal fosse trocada pela vida de Drogo. No entanto, o feiti&ccedil;o usa a vida do beb&ecirc; de Dany para trazer Drogo de volta.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e5ce65e7c925acc3f6a1956ae9bf64a5/tumblr_inline_prq2v03mvA1tr5lp6_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>A bruxa fez parecer que era um ato de gratid&atilde;o, mas era, na verdade, uma maldi&ccedil;&atilde;o que ela estava jogando em Khal Drogo por causa da destrui&ccedil;&atilde;o que o khalasar j&aacute; tinha feito na cidade natal dela &ndash; al&eacute;m de ter visto todos quem conhecia morrer em sua frente, ela j&aacute; tinha sido estuprada por outros dothraki antes de Dany encontr&aacute;-la.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>O que aconteceu com o filho de Daenerys Targaryen?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ele foi morto ainda no &uacute;tero de Dany pela bruxa que usou a vida do beb&ecirc; para trazer Khal Drogo de volta &ndash; mas o feiti&ccedil;o n&atilde;o tinha o objetivo de traz&ecirc;-lo de volta e sim deix&aacute;-lo em estado vegetal, al&eacute;m de matar o garanh&atilde;o que iria cavalgar o mundo (o filho de Dany e Drogo).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Quando nasceu, o beb&ecirc; tinha pele de morcego e vermes correndo atrav&eacute;s dos ossos.

Jaime still does it all for love. Jon is going to do it, for love. But Jaime is freed of consequences for that as is Jon. And in both instances, those women are pit against each other to fuel a conflict inside the man. Cersei and Brienne. Sansa and Daenerys. </p>\n\n<p>Look at the five (5) total women standing who do anything of note. </p>\n\n<p>1 Arya, a girl with a healthy dose of break the cutie cause she&rsquo;s a little girl so of course it\u2019s gotta be there, otherwise framed as a daughter (Ned, Sandor) then turned into a murder machine because yes it is cool but you also stripped her of any other identity - she is the only one allowed to have the possibility of a real romance in the end (strictly because she has denied femininity altogether) but still ends up being a set piece in a man&rsquo;s story, or a denial of power in another man&rsquo;s story (Jon v NK, though I truly love it being her the one to do it, and I genuinely think it can serve aryas story as she has trained to kill death for years&hellip;we are also denied any real conversation between she and Jon about either his resurrection, her training/their time apart, her killing of the nk&hellip; in the end she\u2019s very hollow as a character) </p>\n\n<p>2 sansa, pitted against (3) daenerys for Jon&rsquo;s affections, his time and his trust, as if he cannot simultaneously have a loving relationship with two important women in his life because they for some reason hate each other. she justifies her rape her pain the terrors she has endured FOR being a woman (joffrey Ramsay LF they all use their male power over her, theons pain is projected through hers for his sake)&hellip;she relents to being a caricature of cersei and lf combined, these ppl who have taught her through their own exploitation of her&hellip;. as if embracing the system was a good way to take this young woman survivor\u2019s storyline</p>\n\n<p>3 daenerys pitted against (2) Sansa as if two women with power must necessarily fight over a man with power they both share affection for as a means of demonstrating that actually HIS power is the most important and it&rsquo;s his validation towards them that could possibly secure their power so ofc they need to be antagonistic in order to survive this shit world where a woman without power is nothing but exploitable..she is a woman abused/betrayed by all the men she has loved and welcomed into her life but then she is shown to be a bad person for having the audacity to not revel and adore her own abuse???? This will be why she is denied happiness, but sansa has a storyline that allows her to move on</p>\n\n<p>4 cersei, pitted against (5) brienne for Jaime&rsquo;s affections, his motivations and his sexual love..and ultimately in the end her power - what has set her up as a force to be reckoned with, her crown, her lack of a need for a man in her presence, of overcoming their hold on her&hellip;exactly what ppl use to justify that she&rsquo;s a cold hard bitch of a women&hellip;is taken from her. She dies crying for her womanhood (her yet undeveloped child) and weeps and begs for Jaime&rsquo;s presence. Don&rsquo;t worry the hero will make it all better (and he is a hero for it while she is stripped of her being).. cersei is given so much clout and so much of a reputation yet when she finally has her power you see her do nothing, fuck all, she exercises nothing but restraint and while this is tactically sound for her (re: the long night I mean) in general\u2026why?? In the end I guess she didn\u2019t care. All she wanted was to die in jaime\u2019s arms to a ceiling falling crying about a baby</p>\n\n<p>5 brienne pitted against (4) cersei for the sake of telling a tale of one woman fearing the manipulation of another woman onto her partner. She is a prop for Jaime&rsquo;s redemption. She is the height of loyalty noble intentions and just causes, demonstrated time and time again. Of course Jaime being validated by this woman is what can allow him to feel honourable again, because she&rsquo;s honour itself. But she needs to be cast aside so that he might deny another woman her strength, which she has found on her own and demanded the world recognise them for it. </p>\n\n<p>But again, core, in the end, the final act: 1 serves a paternal narrative/denial of conclusion to the male hero narrative/a love narrative only as a girl denying she&rsquo;s a woman 2 &amp; 3&hellip;.serve a conflict as two opposing women in a man&rsquo;s life 4 &amp; 5&hellip;serve a conflict as two opposing women in a man&rsquo;s life. And he gets to have it both ways. Meanwhile, they both die character deaths. I mean like legit this is such woman hating nonsense </p>\n\n<p>In the end everyone in Daenerys\u2019 initial war council with Yara Greyjoy, Olenna Tyrell, Ellaria Sand and herself, this collection of powerful women\u2026 they&rsquo;re all going to be dead.

Jaime still does it all for love. Jon is going to do it, for love. But Jaime is freed of consequences for that as is Jon. And in both instances, those women are pit against each other to fuel a conflict inside the man. Cersei and Brienne. Sansa and Daenerys. </p>\n\n<p>Look at the five (5) total women standing who do anything of note. </p>\n\n<p>1 Arya, a girl with a healthy dose of break the cutie cause she\u2019s a little girl so of course it\u2019s gotta be there, otherwise framed as a daughter (Ned, Sandor) then turned into a murder machine because yes it is cool but you also stripped her of any other identity - she is the only one allowed to have the possibility of a real romance in the end (strictly because she has denied femininity altogether) but still ends up being a set piece in a man\u2019s story, or a denial of power in another man\u2019s story (Jon v NK, though I truly love it being her the one to do it, and I genuinely think it can serve aryas story as she has trained to kill death for years\u2026we are also denied any real conversation between she and Jon about either his resurrection, her training/their time apart, her killing of the nk\u2026 in the end she\u2019s very hollow as a character) </p>\n\n<p>2 sansa, pitted against (3) daenerys for Jon\u2019s affections, his time and his trust, as if he cannot simultaneously have a loving relationship with two important women in his life because they for some reason hate each other. she justifies her rape her pain the terrors she has endured FOR being a woman (joffrey Ramsay LF they all use their male power over her, theons pain is projected through hers for his sake)\u2026she relents to being a caricature of cersei and lf combined, these ppl who have taught her through their own exploitation of her\u2026. as if embracing the system was a good way to take this young woman survivor\u2019s storyline</p>\n\n<p>3 daenerys pitted against (2) Sansa as if two women with power must necessarily fight over a man with power they both share affection for as a means of demonstrating that actually HIS power is the most important and it\u2019s his validation towards them that could possibly secure their power so ofc they need to be antagonistic in order to survive this shit world where a woman without power is nothing but exploitable..she is a woman abused/betrayed by all the men she has loved and welcomed into her life but then she is shown to be a bad person for having the audacity to not revel and adore her own abuse???? This will be why she is denied happiness, but sansa has a storyline that allows her to move on</p>\n\n<p>4 cersei, pitted against (5) brienne for Jaime\u2019s affections, his motivations and his sexual love..and ultimately in the end her power - what has set her up as a force to be reckoned with, her crown, her lack of a need for a man in her presence, of overcoming their hold on her\u2026exactly what ppl use to justify that she\u2019s a cold hard bitch of a women\u2026is taken from her. She dies crying for her womanhood (her yet undeveloped child) and weeps and begs for Jaime\u2019s presence. Don\u2019t worry the hero will make it all better (and he is a hero for it while she is stripped of her being).. cersei is given so much clout and so much of a reputation yet when she finally has her power you see her do nothing, fuck all, she exercises nothing but restraint and while this is tactically sound for her (re: the long night I mean) in general\u2026why?? In the end I guess she didn\u2019t care. All she wanted was to die in jaime\u2019s arms to a ceiling falling crying about a baby</p>\n\n<p>5 brienne pitted against (4) cersei for the sake of telling a tale of one woman fearing the manipulation of another woman onto her partner. She is a prop for Jaime\u2019s redemption. She is the height of loyalty noble intentions and just causes, demonstrated time and time again. Of course Jaime being validated by this woman is what can allow him to feel honourable again, because she\u2019s honour itself. But she needs to be cast aside so that he might deny another woman her strength, which she has found on her own and demanded the world recognise them for it. </p>\n\n<p>But again, core, in the end, the final act: 1 serves a paternal narrative/denial of conclusion to the male hero narrative/a love narrative only as a girl denying she\u2019s a woman 2 &amp; 3\u2026.serve a conflict as two opposing women in a man\u2019s life 4 &amp; 5\u2026serve a conflict as two opposing women in a man\u2019s life.

Sansa and Daenerys. </p>\n\n<p>Look at the five (5) total women standing who do anything of note. </p>\n\n<p>1 Arya, a girl with a healthy dose of break the cutie cause she&rsquo;s a little girl so of course it&rsquo;s gotta be there, otherwise framed as a daughter (Ned, Sandor) then turned into a murder machine because yes it is cool but you also stripped her of any other identity - she is the only one allowed to have the possibility of a real romance in the end (strictly because she has denied femininity altogether) but still ends up being a set piece in a man&rsquo;s story, or a denial of power in another man&rsquo;s story (Jon v NK, though I truly love it being her the one to do it, and I genuinely think it can serve aryas story as she has trained to kill death for years&hellip;we are also denied any real conversation between she and Jon about either his resurrection, her training/their time apart, her killing of the nk&hellip; in the end she&rsquo;s very hollow as a character) </p>\n\n<p>2 sansa, pitted against (3) daenerys for Jon&rsquo;s affections, his time and his trust, as if he cannot simultaneously have a loving relationship with two important women in his life because they for some reason hate each other. she justifies her rape her pain the terrors she has endured FOR being a woman (joffrey Ramsay LF they all use their male power over her, theons pain is projected through hers for his sake)&hellip;she relents to being a caricature of cersei and lf combined, these ppl who have taught her through their own exploitation of her&hellip;. as if embracing the system was a good way to take this young woman survivor&rsquo;s storyline</p>\n\n<p>3 daenerys pitted against (2) Sansa as if two women with power must necessarily fight over a man with power they both share affection for as a means of demonstrating that actually HIS power is the most important and it&rsquo;s his validation towards them that could possibly secure their power so ofc they need to be antagonistic in order to survive this shit world where a woman without power is nothing but exploitable..she is a woman abused/betrayed by all the men she has loved and welcomed into her life but then she is shown to be a bad person for having the audacity to not revel and adore her own abuse???? This will be why she is denied happiness, but sansa has a storyline that allows her to move on</p>\n\n<p>4 cersei, pitted against (5) brienne for Jaime&rsquo;s affections, his motivations and his sexual love..and ultimately in the end her power - what has set her up as a force to be reckoned with, her crown, her lack of a need for a man in her presence, of overcoming their hold on her&hellip;exactly what ppl use to justify that she&rsquo;s a cold hard bitch of a women&hellip;is taken from her. She dies crying for her womanhood (her yet undeveloped child) and weeps and begs for Jaime&rsquo;s presence. Don&rsquo;t worry the hero will make it all better (and he is a hero for it while she is stripped of her being).. cersei is given so much clout and so much of a reputation yet when she finally has her power you see her do nothing, fuck all, she exercises nothing but restraint and while this is tactically sound for her (re: the long night I mean) in general&hellip;why?? In the end I guess she didn&rsquo;t care. All she wanted was to die in jaime&rsquo;s arms to a ceiling falling crying about a baby</p>\n\n<p>5 brienne pitted against (4) cersei for the sake of telling a tale of one woman fearing the manipulation of another woman onto her partner. She is a prop for Jaime&rsquo;s redemption. She is the height of loyalty noble intentions and just causes, demonstrated time and time again. Of course Jaime being validated by this woman is what can allow him to feel honourable again, because she&rsquo;s honour itself. But she needs to be cast aside so that he might deny another woman her strength, which she has found on her own and demanded the world recognise them for it. </p>\n\n<p>But again, core, in the end, the final act: 1 serves a paternal narrative/denial of conclusion to the male hero narrative/a love narrative only as a girl denying she&rsquo;s a woman 2 &amp; 3&hellip;.serve a conflict as two opposing women in a man&rsquo;s life 4 &amp; 5&hellip;serve a conflict as two opposing women in a man&rsquo;s life. And he gets to have it both ways. Meanwhile, they both die character deaths. I mean like legit this is such woman hating nonsense </p>\n\n<p>In the end everyone in Daenerys&rsquo; initial war council with Yara Greyjoy, Olenna Tyrell, Ellaria Sand and herself, this collection of powerful women&hellip; they&rsquo;re all going to be dead. What&rsquo;s the point of showing this? They MAKE a point to show it, big shots like wow look at all these women in one room we sure are great storytellers and great men for making this story happen!! and then.. to not come through on any of that.. not only that but you don&rsquo;t make up for it elsewhere, it&rsquo;s not like there&rsquo;s women in other areas like.. Cersei also gets what&rsquo;s coming to her so then you have just Arya and Sansa and again Arya is the explicit denial of feminine identity, Sansa is someone who is destroyed because of it she&rsquo;s treated so terribly by men because she embodies it and so then she says it&rsquo;s actually weakness and I no longer need to identify this way so she has the ability to be in power (as does arya the further she denies femininity) </p>\n\n<p>The whole thing really just kind of seems to be about torture porn whether that&rsquo;s actual literal in terms of like Theon or symbolic as it is with the women (and literal :/)</p>\n\n<p>Slight side note you deny Daenerys the kill of the man who destroyed her child ( we all know he shouldn&rsquo;t have been able to kill Rhaegal tho..) and you give that instead to Jaime so that he can kill the guy who&rsquo;s been boning his sister (you also take this kill from Yara, whose crown he stole and who he captured and assaulted, whose father he killed&hellip;whose brother he mocked..). You also give Jaime Olenna who killed Cersei&rsquo;s son (and his but we all know Cersei is the one Going Bonkers over it)..It&rsquo;s like, this is a pattern of behaviour: men getting retribution, women punished for it. Bad storytelling, boring storytellers<br /><br />\nJon and Jaime are the real Points to the story. Sansa goes through turmoil to prove herself right to Jon, who leads with his heart (she will have a gotcha I told u so re: daenerys, yet if she hadn&rsquo;t been through horrors she would likely trust her the same as jon). Arya is given so much raw power yet no personal identity, she takes Jon&rsquo;s kill (not Jaime&rsquo;s cause he decides she&rsquo;s not worth it, but I bet she might otherwise eye roll) but doesn&rsquo;t do much else. Daenerys has an entire arc building her up as this grand hero, so worthy of our love and respect, just so that we can have our male hero take her out as the final villain&hellip;her heroism and her trials only make her fall that much worse (and oh so hard for jon!). Cersei does despicable things in the name of her family&hellip;Jaime also does, hence his redemption arc. But he is allowed to have those actions be seen with sympathy from us the audience, and he is ultimately allowed to renege on all of it&hellip;all because the true villain is Cersei, if not for her Jaime could be a hero outside of her clutches yet she is so powerfully evil that he must return to this horrible woman before dying. Brienne is his redemption made flesh: she is the catalyst for his change (and always verbally backs him to boot), she is honour incarnate and he desperately needs it&hellip;but in the end, her pain is simply a side effect of trusting a man to escape another more evil woman&rsquo;s grasp</p>\n\n<p>Jon ends a hero, a tragic hero fallen into despair by taking the life of the woman he loves, who no longer sees purpose in this world but for his one true talent: guarding this realm of men, of people whose happiness he fights for without a hope that he might be worthy of some in turn.  Jaime ends an antihero, a fallen hero who journeys for years to show his worth as a man and how honourable and noble he always has been, but who just can&rsquo;t give it up for love. Jon is the man who does his duty when it&rsquo;s in contention with his love, while Jaime is the one who chooses love. He gets to die happy, without a care over the other woman he left behind&hellip; Jon meanwhile gets to be miserable because his woman had the gall to take an action against him, against his HONOUR, so like&hellip;you know he had to do it to her!</p>\n\n<p>The women characters are so interesting but instead you make them simply expressions of the male hero&rsquo;s stories. It&rsquo;s boring, sad, tired, lacklustre and all around unsatisfying. The most satisfying routes for both Jon and Jaime instead involve them forming harmonious unions with the two women who manage to share their sense of justice/power/morality, who also just happen to have a lot of individual power themselves. Just like&hellip;let men stand at women&rsquo;s sides. As equals but as seconds&hellip;like&hellip;once. Let it happen&hellip;once</p>",

        "body": "<h1>Why did Daenerys burn Kings Landing?</h1><p>This is currently a hot topic of debate in the GOT fandom and I myself have struggled to understand or explain Daenerys\u2019 actions in \u201cThe Bells\u201d. Despite the <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fgameofthrones%2Fcomments%2Fbo7l4u%2Fspoilers_all_of_the_foreshadowing_that_lead_up_to%2F&amp;t=NTk3YWEwOGI1NTA1NDNhODlkYTViYzFjZWI0NjMxNDQxMmE0MTVmYiw1YTUyZTdjMjcxMmM1M2Y5MzU0NDBjMDI1MGY4N2IzNThiOTA3Zjhj\" target=\"_blank\">foreshadowing and signs</a> Daenerys was taking a dark turn, there\u2019s no escaping the fact that the arc is lacking in adequate build-up and development. However, I think that on closer examination Dany\u2019s motivations and reasons for burning Kings Landing can be found, regardless of how nonsensical they may seem.\u00a0</p><p><b>Disclaimer:</b> This is a critical analysis of Daenerys. I don\u2019t defend Dany and I don\u2019t condemn her, I just try to understand from a writing and character perspective why she would decide to burn Kings Landing. However, hardcore Dany stans may not want to read this.</p><p>The explanations we\u2019ve been given from D&amp;D and Emilia shed a little light on the reasons behind it, but still feel thin in attempting to fully justify and explain her actions.\u00a0</p><p>Here is what D&amp;D have said about Daenerys\u2019 decision to burn Kings Landing during <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D5W8j6wOvxuo&amp;t=ZDc1OTFhOGYzMGJjMWU1NWJmNTcwNGY3Mzk4ZGM3MGZiNmVkMjcwZCw1MTBhYjg1YzRmOTEwMDRmMzVhYTExNDkyN2VkMzM2YmVkNGViOTY5\" target=\"_blank\">Inside the Episode</a>:</p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"quote\"}'>\u201cI think when she said\u00a0\u2018let it be fear\u2019 she\u2019s resigning herself to the fact that she may have to get things done in a way that isn\u2019t pleasant. And she may have to get things done in a way that is horrible to a lot of people.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe chose violence. A Targaryen choosing violence is a pretty terryfying thing.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThere is something kind of chilling about the way Dany has responded to the death of her enemies. And if circumstances had been different, I don\u2019t think this side of Dany would\u2019ve ever come out. If Cersei hadn\u2019t of betrayed her, if Cersei hadn\u2019t executed Missandei, if Jon hadn\u2019t told her the truth. If all of these things had happened in any different way then I don\u2019t think we\u2019d be seeing this side of Daenerys Targaryen.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she decided ahead of time that she was going to do what she did. And then she sees the Red Keep, which is to her the home that her family built when they first came over to this country 300 years ago. It\u2019s in that moment on the walls of Kings Landing when she\u2019s looking at that symbol of everything that is taken from her that she makes the decision to make this personal.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>And this is what <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DySND3BnRM00&amp;t=N2IwZTM1MzAzMDg3NWY3MmQwZmViYmM4NTA2NDZlNzQ1ZTE1YmUwYixhZWI1ODdjZDM5ZjY5NmEwYWFiZTMwM2EyNzk1Y2M5MjAxNzdiOWY4\" target=\"_blank\">Emilia has said</a>:\u00a0</p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"quote\"}'>\u201cIt\u2019s so natural for a person to resort to anger and that\u2019s exactly where she goes. It\u2019s there, it has always been there. It\u2019s what has drove her throughout everything. Here comes that familiar feeling of anger and she doesn\u2019t do anything to choke that. She lives in it. It\u2019s this feeling that you could call Targaryen craziness, or you could give it all of these names that it doesn\u2019t deserve because it\u2019s just grief. It\u2019s hurt and she has this ability to make this hurt feel a little bit less for a minute. And here she is, sitting on this ridge, and there\u2019s the emotion and there\u2019s the feeling, and the feeling is to fucking kill her. When you feel that much failure, disappointment, shame, hurt, and lost love, there\u2019s only so much pain that you can handle before you snap.\u201d  </p><p>D&amp;D and Emilia seem to emphasise Dany\u2019s emotional state in her decision to burn Kings Landing. It\u2019s because she\u2019s been betrayed (Varys, Tyrion and Jon), experienced great loss (Jorah, Rhaegal, Missandei and Jon, to an extent), and she\u2019s grieving and angry. The problem is that no matter how grief-stricken or how intense Dany\u2019s emotional state may be, it\u2019s not enough to explain such a ruthless and cruel act of cold blooded mass murder. I could accept this as an explanation<i> if </i>she had started to burn Kings Landing and then realised she was making a huge mistake and stopped. But the fact that she systematically burned the city to the ground without hesitating or showing any signs of surrendering means that her emotional state can\u2019t explain it.\u00a0</p><p>What I feel is more plausible is this idea of <b>fear versus love</b>. Throughout season 8 there\u2019s been a lot of emphasis on showing that Daenerys is unloved by the people in Westeros. She arrives in Winterfell to a very cold welcome and is pleased when the people cower and scream in fear when her dragons fly by. This is the first hint of her choosing fear over love. As the episodes progress we see this theme more and more. When Theon arrives in Winterfell and pledges to fight for Sansa, the scene is deliberately framed to show Dany\u2019s reaction to seeing Sansa receive such a heartfelt proclamation of devotion and loyalty (this is even more emotive for Dany since Theon is technically <i>her</i> ally, not Sansa\u2019s). It only reminds Daenerys that since arriving in Westeros she hasn\u2019t recieved that kind of treatment.\u00a0After the Battle of Winterfell, Daenerys sits by herself and watches as Jon is surrounded by people talking and laughing with him and listens as Tormund cheers him on as a\u00a0\u201cking\u201d. Later on, she confronts Jon and explicitly expresses how she feels that she has no love in Westeros:\u00a0</p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"quote\"}'>\u201c[&hellip;] I saw them gathered around you. I saw the way they looked at you. I know that look. So many people have looked at me that way, but never here. Never on this side of the sea.\u201d</p><p>Again we saw this in episode 5:\u00a0</p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"quote\"}'>Far more people in Westeros love you than love me. I don&rsquo;t have love here.</p><p>But what\u2019s significant here is that we have an addition to what she says:\u00a0\u201c<b>I only have fear.</b>\u201d Daenerys has come to realise that in the absence of love from the people, her power rests solely in fear. This beckons back to an earlier conversation Dany had with Tyrion in 7x06:\u00a0</p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"quote\"}'>Daenerys: Which war was won without deceit and mass murder?\u00a0</p><p>Tyrion: Yes, you&rsquo;ll need to be ruthless if you&rsquo;re going to win the throne. You need to inspire a degree of fear. But fear is all Cersei has. It&rsquo;s all my father had, and Joffrey. It makes their power brittle because everyone beneath them longs to see them dead.\u00a0</p><p>Daenerys: Aegon Targaryen got quite a long way on fear.</p><p>Olenna also told Daenerys in 7x02:\u00a0</p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"quote\"}'>\u201cCommoners and nobles are all children really. They won\u2019t obey you unless they fear you.\u201d  </p><p>Dany is clearly aware that fear carries a certain amount of power. In the past the amount of love she\u2019s received from the people she\u2019s conquered and that have pledged themselves to her, means that she\u2019s never had to resort to acting based on fear alone. However, season 8 pushes her to that place. Not only is she in a place that is cold and unwelcoming to her, but she loses most of the remaining people she has that do love her - Jorah, Missandei, Rhaegal, Jon and thousands of Unsullied and Dothraki.\u00a0</p><p>Jon plays a particularly significant role in this because he is the one person throughout the season that has been characterised as loving her.</p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"quote\"}'>Did you bend the knee to save the North or because you love her? (8x01)</p><p>He loves you, you know that. (8x02)<br/><br/>He loves our queen. (8x04)<br/><br/> I love you. (8x05)</p><p>We see how Daenerys leans on Jon for support throughout the season in the absence of the support of the people. She seeks his approval, his loyalty and comfort as the only person in Westeros (excluding her advisers) that holds affection for her. In 8x05, in particular, she needs Jon\u2019s love and devotion more than she ever has. He tells her he loves her, yet when she tries to kiss him, he resists and that\u2019s when she says,\u00a0<b>\u201cLet it be fear.\u201d</b></p><p>That final scene between Jon and Dany is more significant than it\u2019s been given credit for and there\u2019s the reason it\u2019s the last scene we get of Dany before she launches the attack on Kings Landing. Jon is the last scrap of love that she has left. She feels completely alone and unloved, and in that moment she just needs to know that she has at least one person that loves her. When Jon is unable to give her what she needs, she realises that she doesn\u2019t even have the love of the man she loves. Without that all she has left is fear and in that moment she decides to act on it and take what she\u2019s been wanting since the second she arrived in Westeros.\u00a0</p><p>That one line,\u00a0\u201cLet it be fear\u201d is what I believe leads Dany to burn Kings Landing. If you rewatch the scene where<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DZ3UWJ2sS2LU&amp;t=MzQwNzIzZGRjYWRjYzEzOGYwMjc0NDRhNTMxZGM2NjUxMDk5ZTgwYyxhYjUxZTEzNWRiMWY5OTczZGE1ZWYxNGQ3ODcyZGE5OGEzMDFjYmU4\" target=\"_blank\">\u00a0Dany is sitting on the walls of Kings Landing as the bells ring</a>, you\u2019ll notice that when Drogon takes to the air they\u2019re flying directly for the Red Keep. We get a reaction shot from Tyrion as he realises his sister is about to die and Cersei is shown standing at the balcony watching Drogon fly right towards her.   As Emilia rightfully said, in this moment all Daenerys is thinking is\u00a0\u201c<i>I want to fucking kill her</i>\u201d. It\u2019s what we\u2019d expect from Dany in this situation. Even with the city\u2019s surrender, it still makes sense that she\u2019d want to kill Cersei to get revenge for all that Cersei has done to her and make sure she\u2019s eliminated for good. Dany only starts burning the civilians <i>after</i> she sees them running and screaming. Once again, this reaffirms that all Daenerys has fear. Instead of the people of Kings Landing falling to their knees and praising their rightful queen for saving them from Cersei\u2019s tyranny, they cower and run in fear. So in that moment she reacts in frustration and anger, and becomes exactly what the people assume she is - a monster that is there to burn their homes and murder them just as Cersei told them she was.\u00a0</p><p>On top of this, there is the bombardment of emotions Dany\u2019s experiencing that D&amp;D and Emilia describe. She sees the Red Keep which is a literal symbol and reminder of the traumas and struggles she\u2019s faced since birth as a result of what was taken from her family. Missandei\u2019s last word \u201c<b>Dracarys</b>\u201d echoes in her ears and she wants revenge for all that has been taken from her. She unleashes all the pent up rage she\u2019s felt every time Sansa has sniped at her or a northerner has turned their nose up at her. Maybe Dany is even thinking in the back of her mind that causing this type of destruction and instilling this kind of fear will solve the last remaining problem she has - Jon\u2019s claim to the Iron Throne. Perhaps she thinks she can force Jon into complete submission by showing the lengths she\u2019ll go to to get what is hers. Perhaps it serves as a lesson to Tyrion that if he chooses to betray her and support Jon\u2019s claim as Varys did, that she will burn him alive. This is the difficulty with shows - regardless of how talented Emilia is as an actress (and may I just say she\u2019s absolutely <i>slayed</i> this season) we have a very limited insight into the inner-workings of Dany\u2019s mind. We don\u2019t know what she\u2019s thinking or how she\u2019s feeling we can only guess and make assumptions. </p><p>Dany burning Kings Landing may on the surface seem completely out of character and contradictory to her development, but there\u2019s <i>a lot </i>of<i>\u00a0</i>things that can explain why she did it that go way beyond\u00a0\u201cshe\u2019s the Mad Queen\u201d or\u00a0\u201cshe\u2019s grieving.\u201d I actually think that some underestimate just how much Daenerys has been emotionally and mentally destroyed this season. If she had surrendered the second those bells rang, what would\u2019ve happened next? She would\u2019ve returned to her one remaining adviser, Tyrion, who has consistently made poor decisions that have resulted in great losses for her, who has betrayed her and\u00a0 lacks faith in her. She would\u2019ve returned to the man she loves who has consistently rejected her and who poses a very real threat to her claim to the Throne. Logically, it might not make sense, but it\u2019s not hard to understand why in the absence of love and in a place of complete isolation, hurt and rage, she would feel that destruction is the only solution. D&amp;D suck at explaining their own writing, but they got one part right - she decided to make it personal. It wasn\u2019t just about getting revenge on Cersei. Daenerys projected blame onto <i>everybody </i>in Kings Landing for every terrible thing that has ever happened to her and decided to use them as cannon fodder in her quest for vengeance, justice and emotional release.\u00a0</p><p>It doesn\u2019t justify her actions, nothing can ever justify it, however, I think it does go some way in explaining her actions. Hopefully, this post has been more insightful than the crap D&amp;D have given us in explaining this sudden change in trajectory for Dany. As I said at the start, there\u2019s only so much any of us can make sense of Dany\u2019s actions because regardless of the foreshadowing, it is incredibly rushed and forced. But my interpretation is that whether we like it or not this is what we have been given and despite how rushed it was, it does make narrative sense. Dany burning Kings Landing goes way beyond grief or madness. She has been pushed to the very limits of her endurance and in the absence of love she has embraced fear, which wields great power. Grief-stricken, betrayed, vengeful and enraged, she chose to bring death and destruction to the people she feels have rejected her and the city that symbolises all that was taken from her family which resulted in her being raised in exile and enduring all the traumas and struggles she\u2019s endured throughout her life.\u00a0</p><p>As a final note, I\u2019d recommend anyone interested in Dany\u2019s season 8 arc to <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D2mlNyqhnc1M&amp;t=NDVlZmQ5MjNiNjM2NTQ2YTJmMjY1YTcyNzljOTZkMGE2YjM3ODM4YSw5N2YxYWMwNTgzYTcxZGMxNGVmODdjZjU4ZTFiNjI1NGI5ZGFhY2U1\" target=\"_blank\">watch this brilliant analysis</a>, which really sums up all of my feelings in a more articulate way than I\u2019m able to.</p>",

And then she sees the Red Keep, which is to her the home that her family built when they first came over to this country 300 years ago. It\u2019s in that moment on the walls of Kings Landing when she\u2019s looking at that symbol of everything that is taken from her that she makes the decision to make this personal.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>And this is what <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DySND3BnRM00&amp;t=N2IwZTM1MzAzMDg3NWY3MmQwZmViYmM4NTA2NDZlNzQ1ZTE1YmUwYixhZWI1ODdjZDM5ZjY5NmEwYWFiZTMwM2EyNzk1Y2M5MjAxNzdiOWY4\" target=\"_blank\">Emilia has said</a>:\u00a0</p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"quote\"}'>\u201cIt\u2019s so natural for a person to resort to anger and that\u2019s exactly where she goes. It\u2019s there, it has always been there. It\u2019s what has drove her throughout everything. Here comes that familiar feeling of anger and she doesn\u2019t do anything to choke that. She lives in it. It\u2019s this feeling that you could call Targaryen craziness, or you could give it all of these names that it doesn\u2019t deserve because it\u2019s just grief. It\u2019s hurt and she has this ability to make this hurt feel a little bit less for a minute. And here she is, sitting on this ridge, and there\u2019s the emotion and there\u2019s the feeling, and the feeling is to fucking kill her. When you feel that much failure, disappointment, shame, hurt, and lost love, there\u2019s only so much pain that you can handle before you snap.\u201d  </p><p>D&amp;D and Emilia seem to emphasise Dany\u2019s emotional state in her decision to burn Kings Landing. It\u2019s because she\u2019s been betrayed (Varys, Tyrion and Jon), experienced great loss (Jorah, Rhaegal, Missandei and Jon, to an extent), and she\u2019s grieving and angry. The problem is that no matter how grief-stricken or how intense Dany\u2019s emotional state may be, it\u2019s not enough to explain such a ruthless and cruel act of cold blooded mass murder. I could accept this as an explanation<i> if </i>she had started to burn Kings Landing and then realised she was making a huge mistake and stopped. But the fact that she systematically burned the city to the ground without hesitating or showing any signs of surrendering means that her emotional state can\u2019t explain it.\u00a0</p><p>What I feel is more plausible is this idea of <b>fear versus love</b>. Throughout season 8 there\u2019s been a lot of emphasis on showing that Daenerys is unloved by the people in Westeros. She arrives in Winterfell to a very cold welcome and is pleased when the people cower and scream in fear when her dragons fly by. This is the first hint of her choosing fear over love. As the episodes progress we see this theme more and more. When Theon arrives in Winterfell and pledges to fight for Sansa, the scene is deliberately framed to show Dany\u2019s reaction to seeing Sansa receive such a heartfelt proclamation of devotion and loyalty (this is even more emotive for Dany since Theon is technically <i>her</i> ally, not Sansa\u2019s). It only reminds Daenerys that since arriving in Westeros she hasn\u2019t recieved that kind of treatment.\u00a0After the Battle of Winterfell, Daenerys sits by herself and watches as Jon is surrounded by people talking and laughing with him and listens as Tormund cheers him on as a\u00a0\u201cking\u201d. Later on, she confronts Jon and explicitly expresses how she feels that she has no love in Westeros:\u00a0</p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"quote\"}'>\u201c[\u2026] I saw them gathered around you. I saw the way they looked at you. I know that look. So many people have looked at me that way, but never here. Never on this side of the sea.\u201d</p><p>Again we saw this in episode 5:\u00a0</p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"quote\"}'>Far more people in Westeros love you than love me. I don\u2019t have love here.</p><p>But what\u2019s significant here is that we have an addition to what she says:\u00a0\u201c<b>I only have fear.</b>\u201d Daenerys has come to realise that in the absence of love from the people, her power rests solely in fear. This beckons back to an earlier conversation Dany had with Tyrion in 7x06:\u00a0</p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"quote\"}'>Daenerys: Which war was won without deceit and mass murder?\u00a0</p><p>Tyrion: Yes, you\u2019ll need to be ruthless if you\u2019re going to win the throne. You need to inspire a degree of fear. But fear is all Cersei has. It\u2019s all my father had, and Joffrey. It makes their power brittle because everyone beneath them longs to see them dead.\u00a0</p><p>Daenerys: Aegon Targaryen got quite a long way on fear.</p><p>Olenna also told Daenerys in 7x02:\u00a0</p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"quote\"}'>\u201cCommoners and nobles are all children really. They won\u2019t obey you unless they fear you.\u201d  </p><p>Dany is clearly aware that fear carries a certain amount of power. In the past the amount of love she\u2019s received from the people she\u2019s conquered and that have pledged themselves to her, means that she\u2019s never had to resort to acting based on fear alone. However, season 8 pushes her to that place. Not only is she in a place that is cold and unwelcoming to her, but she loses most of the remaining people she has that do love her - Jorah, Missandei, Rhaegal, Jon and thousands of Unsullied and Dothraki.\u00a0</p><p>Jon plays a particularly significant role in this because he is the one person throughout the season that has been characterised as loving her.</p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"quote\"}'>Did you bend the knee to save the North or because you love her? (8x01)</p><p>He loves you, you know that. (8x02)<br><br>He loves our queen. (8x04)<br><br> I love you. (8x05)</p><p>We see how Daenerys leans on Jon for support throughout the season in the absence of the support of the people. She seeks his approval, his loyalty and comfort as the only person in Westeros (excluding her advisers) that holds affection for her. In 8x05, in particular, she needs Jon\u2019s love and devotion more than she ever has. He tells her he loves her, yet when she tries to kiss him, he resists and that\u2019s when she says,\u00a0<b>\u201cLet it be fear.\u201d</b></p><p>That final scene between Jon and Dany is more significant than it\u2019s been given credit for and there\u2019s the reason it\u2019s the last scene we get of Dany before she launches the attack on Kings Landing. Jon is the last scrap of love that she has left. She feels completely alone and unloved, and in that moment she just needs to know that she has at least one person that loves her. When Jon is unable to give her what she needs, she realises that she doesn\u2019t even have the love of the man she loves. Without that all she has left is fear and in that moment she decides to act on it and take what she\u2019s been wanting since the second she arrived in Westeros.\u00a0</p><p>That one line,\u00a0\u201cLet it be fear\u201d is what I believe leads Dany to burn Kings Landing. If you rewatch the scene where<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DZ3UWJ2sS2LU&amp;t=MzQwNzIzZGRjYWRjYzEzOGYwMjc0NDRhNTMxZGM2NjUxMDk5ZTgwYyxhYjUxZTEzNWRiMWY5OTczZGE1ZWYxNGQ3ODcyZGE5OGEzMDFjYmU4\" target=\"_blank\">\u00a0Dany is sitting on the walls of Kings Landing as the bells ring</a>, you\u2019ll notice that when Drogon takes to the air they\u2019re flying directly for the Red Keep. We get a reaction shot from Tyrion as he realises his sister is about to die and Cersei is shown standing at the balcony watching Drogon fly right towards her.   As Emilia rightfully said, in this moment all Daenerys is thinking is\u00a0\u201c<i>I want to fucking kill her</i>\u201d. It\u2019s what we\u2019d expect from Dany in this situation. Even with the city\u2019s surrender, it still makes sense that she\u2019d want to kill Cersei to get revenge for all that Cersei has done to her and make sure she\u2019s eliminated for good. Dany only starts burning the civilians <i>after</i> she sees them running and screaming. Once again, this reaffirms that all Daenerys has fear. Instead of the people of Kings Landing falling to their knees and praising their rightful queen for saving them from Cersei\u2019s tyranny, they cower and run in fear. So in that moment she reacts in frustration and anger, and becomes exactly what the people assume she is - a monster that is there to burn their homes and murder them just as Cersei told them she was.\u00a0</p><p>On top of this, there is the bombardment of emotions Dany\u2019s experiencing that D&amp;D and Emilia describe. She sees the Red Keep which is a literal symbol and reminder of the traumas and struggles she\u2019s faced since birth as a result of what was taken from her family. Missandei\u2019s last word \u201c<b>Dracarys</b>\u201d echoes in her ears and she wants revenge for all that has been taken from her. She unleashes all the pent up rage she\u2019s felt every time Sansa has sniped at her or a northerner has turned their nose up at her. Maybe Dany is even thinking in the back of her mind that causing this type of destruction and instilling this kind of fear will solve the last remaining problem she has - Jon\u2019s claim to the Iron Throne. Perhaps she thinks she can force Jon into complete submission by showing the lengths she\u2019ll go to to get what is hers. Perhaps it serves as a lesson to Tyrion that if he chooses to betray her and support Jon\u2019s claim as Varys did, that she will burn him alive. This is the difficulty with shows - regardless of how talented Emilia is as an actress (and may I just say she\u2019s absolutely <i>slayed</i> this season) we have a very limited insight into the inner-workings of Dany\u2019s mind. We don\u2019t know what she\u2019s thinking or how she\u2019s feeling we can only guess and make assumptions. </p><p>Dany burning Kings Landing may on the surface seem completely out of character and contradictory to her development, but there\u2019s <i>a lot </i>of<i>\u00a0</i>things that can explain why she did it that go way beyond\u00a0\u201cshe\u2019s the Mad Queen\u201d or\u00a0\u201cshe\u2019s grieving.\u201d I actually think that some underestimate just how much Daenerys has been emotionally and mentally destroyed this season. If she had surrendered the second those bells rang, what would\u2019ve happened next? She would\u2019ve returned to her one remaining adviser, Tyrion, who has consistently made poor decisions that have resulted in great losses for her, who has betrayed her and\u00a0 lacks faith in her. She would\u2019ve returned to the man she loves who has consistently rejected her and who poses a very real threat to her claim to the Throne. Logically, it might not make sense, but it\u2019s not hard to understand why in the absence of love and in a place of complete isolation, hurt and rage, she would feel that destruction is the only solution. D&amp;D suck at explaining their own writing, but they got one part right - she decided to make it personal. It wasn\u2019t just about getting revenge on Cersei. Daenerys projected blame onto <i>everybody </i>in Kings Landing for every terrible thing that has ever happened to her and decided to use them as cannon fodder in her quest for vengeance, justice and emotional release.\u00a0</p><p>It doesn\u2019t justify her actions, nothing can ever justify it, however, I think it does go some way in explaining her actions.

It\u2019s there, it has always been there. It\u2019s what has drove her throughout everything. Here comes that familiar feeling of anger and she doesn\u2019t do anything to choke that. She lives in it. It\u2019s this feeling that you could call Targaryen craziness, or you could give it all of these names that it doesn\u2019t deserve because it\u2019s just grief. It\u2019s hurt and she has this ability to make this hurt feel a little bit less for a minute. And here she is, sitting on this ridge, and there\u2019s the emotion and there\u2019s the feeling, and the feeling is to fucking kill her. When you feel that much failure, disappointment, shame, hurt, and lost love, there\u2019s only so much pain that you can handle before you snap.\u201d  </p><p>D&amp;D and Emilia seem to emphasise Dany\u2019s emotional state in her decision to burn Kings Landing. It\u2019s because she\u2019s been betrayed (Varys, Tyrion and Jon), experienced great loss (Jorah, Rhaegal, Missandei and Jon, to an extent), and she\u2019s grieving and angry. The problem is that no matter how grief-stricken or how intense Dany\u2019s emotional state may be, it\u2019s not enough to explain such a ruthless and cruel act of cold blooded mass murder. I could accept this as an explanation<i> if </i>she had started to burn Kings Landing and then realised she was making a huge mistake and stopped. But the fact that she systematically burned the city to the ground without hesitating or showing any signs of surrendering means that her emotional state can\u2019t explain it.\u00a0</p><p>What I feel is more plausible is this idea of <b>fear versus love</b>. Throughout season 8 there\u2019s been a lot of emphasis on showing that Daenerys is unloved by the people in Westeros. She arrives in Winterfell to a very cold welcome and is pleased when the people cower and scream in fear when her dragons fly by. This is the first hint of her choosing fear over love. As the episodes progress we see this theme more and more. When Theon arrives in Winterfell and pledges to fight for Sansa, the scene is deliberately framed to show Dany\u2019s reaction to seeing Sansa receive such a heartfelt proclamation of devotion and loyalty (this is even more emotive for Dany since Theon is technically <i>her</i> ally, not Sansa\u2019s). It only reminds Daenerys that since arriving in Westeros she hasn\u2019t recieved that kind of treatment.\u00a0After the Battle of Winterfell, Daenerys sits by herself and watches as Jon is surrounded by people talking and laughing with him and listens as Tormund cheers him on as a\u00a0\u201cking\u201d. Later on, she confronts Jon and explicitly expresses how she feels that she has no love in Westeros:\u00a0</p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"quote\"}'>\u201c[\u2026] I saw them gathered around you. I saw the way they looked at you. I know that look. So many people have looked at me that way, but never here. Never on this side of the sea.\u201d</p><p>Again we saw this in episode 5:\u00a0</p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"quote\"}'>Far more people in Westeros love you than love me. I don\u2019t have love here.</p><p>But what\u2019s significant here is that we have an addition to what she says:\u00a0\u201c<b>I only have fear.</b>\u201d Daenerys has come to realise that in the absence of love from the people, her power rests solely in fear. This beckons back to an earlier conversation Dany had with Tyrion in 7x06:\u00a0</p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"quote\"}'>Daenerys: Which war was won without deceit and mass murder?\u00a0</p><p>Tyrion: Yes, you\u2019ll need to be ruthless if you\u2019re going to win the throne. You need to inspire a degree of fear. But fear is all Cersei has. It\u2019s all my father had, and Joffrey. It makes their power brittle because everyone beneath them longs to see them dead.\u00a0</p><p>Daenerys: Aegon Targaryen got quite a long way on fear.</p><p>Olenna also told Daenerys in 7x02:\u00a0</p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"quote\"}'>\u201cCommoners and nobles are all children really. They won\u2019t obey you unless they fear you.\u201d  </p><p>Dany is clearly aware that fear carries a certain amount of power. In the past the amount of love she\u2019s received from the people she\u2019s conquered and that have pledged themselves to her, means that she\u2019s never had to resort to acting based on fear alone. However, season 8 pushes her to that place. Not only is she in a place that is cold and unwelcoming to her, but she loses most of the remaining people she has that do love her - Jorah, Missandei, Rhaegal, Jon and thousands of Unsullied and Dothraki.\u00a0</p><p>Jon plays a particularly significant role in this because he is the one person throughout the season that has been characterised as loving her.</p><p class=\"npf_quote\" data-npf='{\"subtype\":\"quote\"}'>Did you bend the knee to save the North or because you love her? (8x01)</p><p>He loves you, you know that. (8x02)<br><br>He loves our queen. (8x04)<br><br> I love you. (8x05)</p><p>We see how Daenerys leans on Jon for support throughout the season in the absence of the support of the people. She seeks his approval, his loyalty and comfort as the only person in Westeros (excluding her advisers) that holds affection for her. In 8x05, in particular, she needs Jon\u2019s love and devotion more than she ever has. He tells her he loves her, yet when she tries to kiss him, he resists and that\u2019s when she says,\u00a0<b>\u201cLet it be fear.\u201d</b></p><p>That final scene between Jon and Dany is more significant than it\u2019s been given credit for and there\u2019s the reason it\u2019s the last scene we get of Dany before she launches the attack on Kings Landing. Jon is the last scrap of love that she has left. She feels completely alone and unloved, and in that moment she just needs to know that she has at least one person that loves her. When Jon is unable to give her what she needs, she realises that she doesn\u2019t even have the love of the man she loves. Without that all she has left is fear and in that moment she decides to act on it and take what she\u2019s been wanting since the second she arrived in Westeros.\u00a0</p><p>That one line,\u00a0\u201cLet it be fear\u201d is what I believe leads Dany to burn Kings Landing. If you rewatch the scene where<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DZ3UWJ2sS2LU&amp;t=MzQwNzIzZGRjYWRjYzEzOGYwMjc0NDRhNTMxZGM2NjUxMDk5ZTgwYyxhYjUxZTEzNWRiMWY5OTczZGE1ZWYxNGQ3ODcyZGE5OGEzMDFjYmU4\" target=\"_blank\">\u00a0Dany is sitting on the walls of Kings Landing as the bells ring</a>, you\u2019ll notice that when Drogon takes to the air they\u2019re flying directly for the Red Keep. We get a reaction shot from Tyrion as he realises his sister is about to die and Cersei is shown standing at the balcony watching Drogon fly right towards her.   As Emilia rightfully said, in this moment all Daenerys is thinking is\u00a0\u201c<i>I want to fucking kill her</i>\u201d. It\u2019s what we\u2019d expect from Dany in this situation. Even with the city\u2019s surrender, it still makes sense that she\u2019d want to kill Cersei to get revenge for all that Cersei has done to her and make sure she\u2019s eliminated for good. Dany only starts burning the civilians <i>after</i> she sees them running and screaming. Once again, this reaffirms that all Daenerys has fear. Instead of the people of Kings Landing falling to their knees and praising their rightful queen for saving them from Cersei\u2019s tyranny, they cower and run in fear. So in that moment she reacts in frustration and anger, and becomes exactly what the people assume she is - a monster that is there to burn their homes and murder them just as Cersei told them she was.\u00a0</p><p>On top of this, there is the bombardment of emotions Dany\u2019s experiencing that D&amp;D and Emilia describe. She sees the Red Keep which is a literal symbol and reminder of the traumas and struggles she\u2019s faced since birth as a result of what was taken from her family. Missandei\u2019s last word \u201c<b>Dracarys</b>\u201d echoes in her ears and she wants revenge for all that has been taken from her. She unleashes all the pent up rage she\u2019s felt every time Sansa has sniped at her or a northerner has turned their nose up at her. Maybe Dany is even thinking in the back of her mind that causing this type of destruction and instilling this kind of fear will solve the last remaining problem she has - Jon\u2019s claim to the Iron Throne. Perhaps she thinks she can force Jon into complete submission by showing the lengths she\u2019ll go to to get what is hers. Perhaps it serves as a lesson to Tyrion that if he chooses to betray her and support Jon\u2019s claim as Varys did, that she will burn him alive. This is the difficulty with shows - regardless of how talented Emilia is as an actress (and may I just say she\u2019s absolutely <i>slayed</i> this season) we have a very limited insight into the inner-workings of Dany\u2019s mind. We don\u2019t know what she\u2019s thinking or how she\u2019s feeling we can only guess and make assumptions. </p><p>Dany burning Kings Landing may on the surface seem completely out of character and contradictory to her development, but there\u2019s <i>a lot </i>of<i>\u00a0</i>things that can explain why she did it that go way beyond\u00a0\u201cshe\u2019s the Mad Queen\u201d or\u00a0\u201cshe\u2019s grieving.\u201d I actually think that some underestimate just how much Daenerys has been emotionally and mentally destroyed this season. If she had surrendered the second those bells rang, what would\u2019ve happened next? She would\u2019ve returned to her one remaining adviser, Tyrion, who has consistently made poor decisions that have resulted in great losses for her, who has betrayed her and\u00a0 lacks faith in her. She would\u2019ve returned to the man she loves who has consistently rejected her and who poses a very real threat to her claim to the Throne. Logically, it might not make sense, but it\u2019s not hard to understand why in the absence of love and in a place of complete isolation, hurt and rage, she would feel that destruction is the only solution. D&amp;D suck at explaining their own writing, but they got one part right - she decided to make it personal. It wasn\u2019t just about getting revenge on Cersei. Daenerys projected blame onto <i>everybody </i>in Kings Landing for every terrible thing that has ever happened to her and decided to use them as cannon fodder in her quest for vengeance, justice and emotional release.\u00a0</p><p>It doesn\u2019t justify her actions, nothing can ever justify it, however, I think it does go some way in explaining her actions. Hopefully, this post has been more insightful than the crap D&amp;D have given us in explaining this sudden change in trajectory for Dany. As I said at the start, there\u2019s only so much any of us can make sense of Dany\u2019s actions because regardless of the foreshadowing, it is incredibly rushed and forced. But my interpretation is that whether we like it or not this is what we have been given and despite how rushed it was, it does make narrative sense. Dany burning Kings Landing goes way beyond grief or madness. She has been pushed to the very limits of her endurance and in the absence of love she has embraced fear, which wields great power. Grief-stricken, betrayed, vengeful and enraged, she chose to bring death and destruction to the people she feels have rejected her and the city that symbolises all that was taken from her family which resulted in her being raised in exile and enduring all the traumas and struggles she\u2019s endured throughout her life.\u00a0</p><p>As a final note, I\u2019d recommend anyone interested in Dany\u2019s season 8 arc to <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D2mlNyqhnc1M&amp;t=NDVlZmQ5MjNiNjM2NTQ2YTJmMjY1YTcyNzljOTZkMGE2YjM3ODM4YSw5N2YxYWMwNTgzYTcxZGMxNGVmODdjZjU4ZTFiNjI1NGI5ZGFhY2U1\" target=\"_blank\">watch this brilliant analysis</a>, which really sums up all of my feelings in a more articulate way than I\u2019m able to.</p></p>",

Grief-stricken, betrayed, vengeful and enraged, she chose to bring death and destruction to the people she feels have rejected her and the city that symbolises all that was taken from her family which resulted in her being raised in exile and enduring all the traumas and struggles she&rsquo;s endured throughout her life.&nbsp;</p><p>As a final note, I&rsquo;d recommend anyone interested in Dany&rsquo;s season 8 arc to <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D2mlNyqhnc1M&amp;t=NDVlZmQ5MjNiNjM2NTQ2YTJmMjY1YTcyNzljOTZkMGE2YjM3ODM4YSw5N2YxYWMwNTgzYTcxZGMxNGVmODdjZjU4ZTFiNjI1NGI5ZGFhY2U1\" target=\"_blank\">watch this brilliant analysis</a>, which really sums up all of my feelings in a more articulate way than I&rsquo;m able to.</p></p>",
