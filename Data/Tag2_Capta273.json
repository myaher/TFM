This was definitely great for the two love birds considering what they&rsquo;ve been through. The sun shines in on the two. Laura slowly woke up from the sun in her eyes. She remembered why she lay there on Peter&rsquo;s chest as he slept. A smile crept up on her face. Laura looked around and saw the clothes scattered on the floor and felt the cool air nipping at her bare shoulders.</p><p>They&rsquo;re naked bodies cuddling for warmth. Every time the two have sex it gets better and better. Last night was probably the best out of the 3 times they&rsquo;ve had sex. Well, after last night 5 times. </p><p>The first round had just gotten done when May walked in with dinner. It worked up their appetite. The second round was more loving. It was something like out of a movie where the moonlight lit everything up and they fell asleep in each other&rsquo;s arms.</p><p>Laura looked up and admired the sleeping boy who looked so peaceful. To wake him up she moved up and kissed him. A few seconds later she felt him kiss back indicating he&rsquo;s awake. &ldquo;Morning beautiful.&rdquo; He said all groggy. </p><p>It made Laura giggled and kiss him again. &ldquo;Morning Spider-Man.&rdquo; They hugged until Peter pulled away registering something. An eyebrow lifted and then he chuckled. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right we fell asleep like this. I really hope May didn&rsquo;t see us like this.&rdquo; He chuckled. </p><p>&ldquo;Even if she did she doesn&rsquo;t care as long as we&rsquo;re using protection. Shit! Give me a second. It may look like I&rsquo;m in pain.&rdquo; As sexy as Laura looked to Peter with her boobs hanging and ass out, he was completely confused as to why she was bent over and looking like she is having a period cramp. </p><p>&ldquo;There we go.&rdquo; She said standing straight and then moving to find clothes. &ldquo;Um babe, what was that?&rdquo; Peter asked completely skeeved out. &ldquo;Killing what could&rsquo;ve potentially been our baby.&rdquo; Peter had the weirdest look. </p><p>&ldquo;My body produces spermicide like I&rsquo;ve told you. Don&rsquo;t worry your little swimmers didn&rsquo;t get to my egg yet.&rdquo; Peter just chuckled. He&rsquo;s never going to get used to it. They both get dressed again and head to the kitchen. </p><p>May left food for them to heat up. They sat at the counter eating their delicious breakfast. &ldquo;Peter, I want to tell you all about my past today.&rdquo; Laura finished a bite. &ldquo;Love, you don&rsquo;t have to. I love you no matter what.&rdquo; He leaned over kissing her forehead. </p><p>&ldquo;You deserve to know everything. I know everything about you and you know just a little bit of me. I want to tell you.&rdquo; It&rsquo;ll be hard for her but he deserves to know. After they ate, they migrated to the couch. Laura snuggled into Peter&rsquo;s arms. </p><p>Every time she does he thinks &ldquo;this is where you belong.&rdquo; She buried her face in his chest and he felt her kiss him. &ldquo;Peter?&rdquo; She asked innocently. &ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; He looked down. </p><p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t made the traditional way with sex. I was made in a test tube and put into a surrogate mother, yeah it&rsquo;s like the way most women who can&rsquo;t have kids go but I&rsquo;m different. My real name isn&rsquo;t Laura Kinney or Laura Howlett. My real name is X-23. I&rsquo;m really a test subject that succeeded after 23 tries.&rdquo;</p><p>She paused to see Peter&rsquo;s reaction. He started to chuckle. &ldquo;Babe you&rsquo;re Laura. Not X-23. I don&rsquo;t care if you fight me on this one.&rdquo; Laura chuckled and leaned up to kiss him. &ldquo;And this is one of the reasons why I love you. Anyway into the deeper stuff. After I killed my mom-&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Wait you killed your own mom?&rdquo; Peter asked concerned. &ldquo;Yeah I did. You know that stuff you saw me in, it was in my system at the time. I obviously wasn&rsquo;t myself and they used me to kill her. They were furious when she figured out who they were and took off with me.&rdquo; Laura sighed.</p><p>Peter kissed the top of her head and she continued. &ldquo;After that I found Professor X who, at the time, was in his 70s. It was crazy.&rdquo; Laura went on to tell Peter about the future with Professor X and her dad. She also mentioned that she was captured it was still the future. </p><p>&ldquo;Eventually there was a breach. Earth had something weird going on and there were breaches everywhere. I walked into on and landed in the backyard of the school. Right in Salem, New York. It was so weird seeing how young my dad is and Professor X.&rdquo; Laura paused again.</p><p>Peter couldn&rsquo;t help be love Laura more. She&rsquo;s a strong, independent but vulnerable girl. Her opening up just made her beauty glow 10 Times more. </p><p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re here. I&rsquo;m in love with Spider-Man, which I do know your fate, well maybe not because in the future I never dated you because that would&rsquo;ve been illegal. Now that you&rsquo;re with me maybe things have changed. Oh and you&rsquo;re the best&rdquo; She paused switching to where she&rsquo;s straddling him. </p><p>&ldquo;Partner I&rsquo;ve ever had in bed.&rdquo; She nipped at his ear. &ldquo;Laura are you sure you can handle another round? I thought I did you in good last night.&rdquo; Peter tried not to moan. Dear god did she have quite the libido.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m self healing remember babe?&rdquo; He huffed trying to keep his composure. &ldquo;Yeah I forgot that too. Before we do anything I want to say something.&rdquo; Laura paused sitting up to hear what he has to say. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you told me everything. I do think differently of you but not in a bad way. It just makes me realize even more how amazing you are. I love you no matter how fucked up you are or no matter how much I am.&rdquo; Peter leaned in to kiss her. </p><p>They shared their most loving kiss so far until Laura pushed things further. Peter has zero clue if it&rsquo;s him who&rsquo;s making her this horny (it&rsquo;s highly likely) or that bad serum but he doesn&rsquo;t care. He&rsquo;s loving it.</p>",

                "content": "<p>Chapter 32: </p><p>Tony told the school that the students were on a trip so they could actually relax and not get penalized for it. This was definitely great for the two love birds considering what they&rsquo;ve been through. The sun shines in on the two. Laura slowly woke up from the sun in her eyes. She remembered why she lay there on Peter&rsquo;s chest as he slept. A smile crept up on her face. Laura looked around and saw the clothes scattered on the floor and felt the cool air nipping at her bare shoulders.</p><p>They&rsquo;re naked bodies cuddling for warmth. Every time the two have sex it gets better and better. Last night was probably the best out of the 3 times they&rsquo;ve had sex. Well, after last night 5 times. </p><p>The first round had just gotten done when May walked in with dinner. It worked up their appetite. The second round was more loving. It was something like out of a movie where the moonlight lit everything up and they fell asleep in each other&rsquo;s arms.</p><p>Laura looked up and admired the sleeping boy who looked so peaceful. To wake him up she moved up and kissed him. A few seconds later she felt him kiss back indicating he&rsquo;s awake. &ldquo;Morning beautiful.&rdquo; He said all groggy. </p><p>It made Laura giggled and kiss him again. &ldquo;Morning Spider-Man.&rdquo; They hugged until Peter pulled away registering something. An eyebrow lifted and then he chuckled. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right we fell asleep like this. I really hope May didn&rsquo;t see us like this.&rdquo; He chuckled. </p><p>&ldquo;Even if she did she doesn&rsquo;t care as long as we&rsquo;re using protection. Shit! Give me a second. It may look like I&rsquo;m in pain.&rdquo; As sexy as Laura looked to Peter with her boobs hanging and ass out, he was completely confused as to why she was bent over and looking like she is having a period cramp. </p><p>&ldquo;There we go.&rdquo; She said standing straight and then moving to find clothes. &ldquo;Um babe, what was that?&rdquo; Peter asked completely skeeved out. &ldquo;Killing what could&rsquo;ve potentially been our baby.&rdquo; Peter had the weirdest look. </p><p>&ldquo;My body produces spermicide like I&rsquo;ve told you. Don&rsquo;t worry your little swimmers didn&rsquo;t get to my egg yet.&rdquo; Peter just chuckled. He&rsquo;s never going to get used to it. They both get dressed again and head to the kitchen. </p><p>May left food for them to heat up. They sat at the counter eating their delicious breakfast. &ldquo;Peter, I want to tell you all about my past today.&rdquo; Laura finished a bite. &ldquo;Love, you don&rsquo;t have to. I love you no matter what.&rdquo; He leaned over kissing her forehead. </p><p>&ldquo;You deserve to know everything. I know everything about you and you know just a little bit of me. I want to tell you.&rdquo; It&rsquo;ll be hard for her but he deserves to know. After they ate, they migrated to the couch. Laura snuggled into Peter&rsquo;s arms. </p><p>Every time she does he thinks &ldquo;this is where you belong.&rdquo; She buried her face in his chest and he felt her kiss him. &ldquo;Peter?&rdquo; She asked innocently. &ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; He looked down. </p><p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t made the traditional way with sex. I was made in a test tube and put into a surrogate mother, yeah it&rsquo;s like the way most women who can&rsquo;t have kids go but I&rsquo;m different. My real name isn&rsquo;t Laura Kinney or Laura Howlett. My real name is X-23. I&rsquo;m really a test subject that succeeded after 23 tries.&rdquo;</p><p>She paused to see Peter&rsquo;s reaction. He started to chuckle. &ldquo;Babe you&rsquo;re Laura. Not X-23. I don&rsquo;t care if you fight me on this one.&rdquo; Laura chuckled and leaned up to kiss him. &ldquo;And this is one of the reasons why I love you. Anyway into the deeper stuff. After I killed my mom-&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Wait you killed your own mom?&rdquo; Peter asked concerned. &ldquo;Yeah I did. You know that stuff you saw me in, it was in my system at the time. I obviously wasn&rsquo;t myself and they used me to kill her. They were furious when she figured out who they were and took off with me.&rdquo; Laura sighed.</p><p>Peter kissed the top of her head and she continued. &ldquo;After that I found Professor X who, at the time, was in his 70s. It was crazy.&rdquo; Laura went on to tell Peter about the future with Professor X and her dad. She also mentioned that she was captured it was still the future. </p><p>&ldquo;Eventually there was a breach. Earth had something weird going on and there were breaches everywhere. I walked into on and landed in the backyard of the school. Right in Salem, New York. It was so weird seeing how young my dad is and Professor X.&rdquo; Laura paused again.</p><p>Peter couldn&rsquo;t help be love Laura more. She&rsquo;s a strong, independent but vulnerable girl. Her opening up just made her beauty glow 10 Times more. </p><p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re here. I&rsquo;m in love with Spider-Man, which I do know your fate, well maybe not because in the future I never dated you because that would&rsquo;ve been illegal. Now that you&rsquo;re with me maybe things have changed. Oh and you&rsquo;re the best&rdquo; She paused switching to where she&rsquo;s straddling him. </p><p>&ldquo;Partner I&rsquo;ve ever had in bed.&rdquo; She nipped at his ear. &ldquo;Laura are you sure you can handle another round? I thought I did you in good last night.&rdquo; Peter tried not to moan. Dear god did she have quite the libido.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m self healing remember babe?&rdquo; He huffed trying to keep his composure. &ldquo;Yeah I forgot that too. Before we do anything I want to say something.&rdquo; Laura paused sitting up to hear what he has to say. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you told me everything. I do think differently of you but not in a bad way. It just makes me realize even more how amazing you are. I love you no matter how fucked up you are or no matter how much I am.&rdquo; Peter leaned in to kiss her. </p><p>They shared their most loving kiss so far until Laura pushed things further. Peter has zero clue if it&rsquo;s him who&rsquo;s making her this horny (it&rsquo;s highly likely) or that bad serum but he doesn&rsquo;t care. He&rsquo;s loving it.</p>",
