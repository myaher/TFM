        "body": "<p>I really love TV. So my first intention was to list my top 10 shows. Then it became 20 shows, and then it became even more. I initially thought it\u2019d be just the names of the shows and no description at all but, just a quick simple list, but well&hellip; that didn\u2019t go as planned either. I mean if I want you to take my list serious, I gotta give you some reasons why, <i>right</i>? So my TV acolytes, read on if you dare! :) Oh, and I put the trailer links for each show in their title along with some other links sprinkled throughout. Enjoy &amp; happy watching!!</p><p>1.<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2149175/videoplayer/vi2496441881\"> The Americans (Amazon Prime, was on FX)</a> A slow burn, hardcore realistic 1980\u2032s spy/family drama with <i>superb</i> writing and acting. Kerri Russell plays Elizabeth Jennings and is a quintessential,cold blooded bad ass. All of a sudden she\u2019ll just pull out a silenced pistol and BOOM! Blow someone away in half a second&hellip;but to be fair, the people she kills had it coming&hellip;well, usually&hellip;except for that grandmother that one time&hellip; and I\u2019m not kidding. Although it can be slow paced at times, there are shocking moments so intense they\u2019ll make you think,\u00a0\u201cHoly fuckin\u2019 shit!\u201d. Along with the Russian and FBI spy craft the other part of the show is about the Jennings family, Elizabeth and Philip and their two kids Paige and Henry and how they go about their daily\u00a0<i>norma</i>l lives &ndash;so basically the show is half spy and half family drama. Initially, I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d like the family drama part of the show but the Jennings family really grows on you, you really care about them after all the seasons, along with their neighbor Stan Beeman and \n\nNina Sergeevna. Overall, this is a killer show (pun intended), and it almost rivals The Wire in my opinion, it\u2019s that good. I can\u2019t say enough good things about it, but I\u2019ll end with, \u201cWould I recommend <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Americans_(2013_TV_series)\">The Americans</a>\u201d? The short answer is\u00a0\u201cda!\u201d and the long answer is \u201copredelenno\u201d (definitely)! Thanks google translate!</p><p>2. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MBjBavIC9U\">Killing Eve (BBCA)</a> This is a less realistic, cat and mouse spy drama, but bloody hell does it pack a punch. Sandra Oh is insanely good as a MI5 desk jockey. She\u2019s an intelligence analyst named Eve, who gets fixated on following the trail of a complete badass, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq1871YNaWA\">Villanelle (Jodie Comer)</a>, \n\nwho incidentally happens to be one of the<i> craziest</i> international assassins you\u2019ve ever seen. Have you ever seen an assassin go to her therapist in a pink tulle dress that looks like a tutu? I think not. If I recall, Villanelle takes out about a handful of people in just the first episode. Sandra was nominated for an Emmy and the show got renewed for a second season before the first episode even aired! Like how often does that happen? Hardly ever! So if you liked Sandra as Dr. Yang in Grey\u2019s, you\u2019ll probably love her here too! It has a playful tone at times but really tense moments as well, plus it\u2019s such a freaking badass show! I really love &amp; enjoy this show, and okay, yes, I\u2019ve used badass too much, sue go ahead and sue me. Now, go watch this girl power show! Bonus: If you like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_Eve\">Killing Eve</a>\u00a0then you <i>might</i> like<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5Uv6cb9YRs\"> Fleabag (Amazon Prime)</a> or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDWRERhKPBs\">Crashing (Netflix),</a> which are kind of oddball UK comedies. They\u2019re created and both star\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=Phoebe+Waller-Bridge&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAOPgE-LVT9c3NEy3LCsxTynLU-LSz9U3yMgyyzKv0pLMTrbSLykDoviCovz0osRcq_KizJLUomIAFahA1TgAAAA&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiVmLnZnqHfAhXix1QKHcFkDHMQmxMoATA7egQIChAT\">Phoebe Waller-Bridge</a>\u00a0(played the voice of the British sounding robot in\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3778644?ref_=nm_ov_bio_lk1\">Solo: A Star Wars Story</a>), who also executive produces and writes Killing Eve. She\u2019s very talented! So go get a friend\u2019s cable password and get the BBCA app and binge it today&hellip; it\u2019s British made, so only 10 episodes! Cheers!</p><p>3. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVLiDETfx1c\">The Handmaid\u2019s Tale (Hulu)</a> Amazingly gripping &amp; dark portrayal of a world gone mad. Set in a dystopian future, a woman is forced to live as a concubine under a fundamentalist theocratic dictatorship.\n\n This one is really soooo freaking heavy it\u2019ll sit with you for a long time. Seriously, this one can effect your psyche. Elisabeth Moss (Mad Men) is such a powerhouse as the lead Offred in this one (I didn\u2019t use badass either! But I could have!). It won a ton of Emmys for the first season, and that season is truly a masterpiece. With some of my friends at work, when I walk by them I\u2019ll say, \u201cBlessed be the fruit.\u201d and\u00a0\u201cUnder his eye.\u201d. It cracks us up. If you can withstand a ultra intense show about theocratic oppression, then <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Handmaid%27s_Tale\">The Handmaid\u2019s Tale </a>is for you. It\u2019s really good though, I swear! Praise be! ***WARNING NOTE*** This show contains a lot of well&hellip;it\u2019s even hard to type&hellip; religious rape, abuse, murder&mdash;basically all things evil. I swear it\u2019s the one of the darkest show I\u2019ve ever seen in my entire life (I think the Following was pretty dark too, right?). Nevertheless,\u00a0<i><b>VIEWER DISCRETION IS ADVISED x A MILLION</b>. In fact, certain scenes made me physically\u00a0cringe in disgust, with my mouth dropping open in shock &amp; horror. Now on to something a bit lighter&hellip;</i></p><p>4. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOmwkTrW4OQ\">The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel (Amazon Prime)</a> Funny and heartfelt, this show has extremely beautiful costumes and wonderfully authentic sets and is about a 1950\u2032s N.Y. Jewish housewife (Emmy winner\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3014031/?ref_=tt_cl_t1\">Rachel Brosnahan</a>) who dreams of being a stand up comic. It\u2019s already won Emmys for lead comedy actress Brosnahan, supporting actress Borstein, as well as best comedy. Really good for a wide age range of adults (you can watch it with your parents and they\u2019ll tell you all about their good old days, I\u2019m sure! &ndash;it does have some cursing and brief topless nudity in one sequence though). <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001724/\">Tony Shalub</a> (Monk),\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0097504/?ref_=tt_cl_t5\">Alex Borstein</a>\u00a0(Family Guy)\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0385792/?ref_=tt_cl_t4\">Marin Hinkle</a>\u00a0(Two and a Half Men) are also awesome in it! I mean so awesome they\u2019re almost badass! :) Oy vey! Did I just say that!?!</p><p>5. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hAXVqrljbs\">Ozark (Netflix)</a> One of Jason Bateman\u2019s finest performances, <i>if not his best!</i>\u00a0 Jason was even Emmy nominated, but lost to Matthew Rhys from the Americans. It also stars the fantastic Laura Linney (HBO\u2019s John Adams) as Jason\u2019s wife. This taunt drama has a heavy, moody, forresty atmosphere to it. And yes, I just said forresty&hellip; I know it\u2019s not a word but we\u2019re in the Ozarks. Plot: It\u2019s about an average guy, a financial CPA type adviser, who launders money for the Mexican cartel. Then of course everything goes wrong&hellip; and then well&hellip; let\u2019s take the family, pack\u2019em up and go to the Ozarks! It kicks off about 15-20 minutes into the first episode, so don\u2019t quit watching until you get past the shocking inciting incident, it\u2019s worth it! I watched 10 minutes when it first came out, then turned it off. Then a year later my friend said, \u201cHey, it\u2019s really good.\u201d I was like, \u201cReally? Because I quit watching during the start of the first episode.\u201d. He said, \u201cDuuuude, just watch the rest of it. It\u2019s good.\u201d \u201c<i>Okaaaayyyyy, </i>if you say so<i>.</i>\u201d I replied. I\u2019m happy to report, he was 100% correct. A really solid crime &amp; family drama set in wherever the fuck the Ozarks are&hellip; I think they make up some huge national parks&hellip; maybe in Arkansas or Oklahoma? I\u2019m in California so really, how the fuck would I know? The family starts in Chicago so I\u2019m going with&hellip; the Missouri Ozarks for $500 Alex.\u00a0</p><p>6. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzayf9GpXCI\">The Man in the High Castle (Amazon Prime)</a> A 1950-1960\u2032s period piece that is spooky as hell because in this alternate universe the Germans and Japanese won World War II! Can you believe that?!? <b>Nein, </b>me either! The Germans run the east coast while the Japanese run the west, in the middle is a sort of no man\u2019s land free zone. Anyways, there are some bootleg films floating around the country about the U.S. winning the war\u00a0 and your brain will go trippin and say \u201cWhoa!\u201d when you see a huge Nazi flag draped over the Statue of Liberty. A ton of great actors in this drama, with\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=Alexa+Davalos&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgFuLWz9U3MDTKyy2oTFHiBHEsjC2MzbU4Q8JC8h2TS_KLAPyqxoolAAAA&amp;sa=X&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiWzfSBkKHfAhVMlCwKHT08BUoQxA0wMXoECAkQBQ\" title=\"Alexa Davalos (Juliana Crain)\">Alexa Davalos</a>is as the badass lead, \n\nJuliana Crain. When I think of the word crain I think of the crane kick in the original Karate Kid movie. Based on a sci fi author Philip K Dick story&hellip;no, not the Karate Kid, The Man in the High Castle is base on a Phillip K Dick story. Wait.. have you ever heard of a low castle? What would you call that then, a basement? Underground parking? Wait..that gives me an idea for recommendation #13. Sorry, I\u2019ve had too much caffeine today! Wait, it\u2019s 3:00 o\u2019clock in the morning!</p><p>7. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfBgT5djaQw\">The Good Place (NBC &amp; Netflix)</a>\u00a0Holy shirtballs folks! The Good Place is a zany, quick witted comedy about Kristin Bell (Veronica Ma, House of Lies, Frozen) going to heaven after she dies wherein the forking awesome Ted Danson (Cheers) guides her around, well, The Good Place. There is also a weekly podcast after each episode that is really cool where the ash-hole antagonist of the show, Shawn (\n\n<a href=\"http://thegoodplace.wikia.com/wiki/Marc_Evan_Jackson\" title=\"Marc Evan Jackson\">Marc Evan Jackson</a>\u00a0), interviews everyone involved in the show from writers to actors to FX to props and even animal handlers, pretty much everyone involved at one point or another. Also, you can actually drive through, well, be driven through the entire Good Place town square set at Universal Studios if you take their tram tour. Produced by the creator of Parks and Rec Michael Schur, so it\u2019s definitely just as good as Ron Swanson playing the sax or a concert by Mouse Rat!</p><p>8. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK_70f7PamE\">Better Call Saul (AMC)</a> If you like Breaking Bad, you\u2019ll love Bob Odenkirk as you see the origins of his shifty lawyer character, Saul Goodman. Plus from Breaking Bad you get more of characters like Tuco, Gus Fring and Mike\u00a0\n\nEhrmantraut. I\u2019m sad to say that Walter White or Jesse Pinkman have not shown up yet. So what do I have to say about that?\u00a0\u00a0\u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVR476WHmR8\">YO, BITCH!\u201d</a>\u00a0get with the program!</p><p>9.<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZqDO6cTYVY&amp;t=31s\"> G.L.O.W. (Netflix) </a>A girl power dark comedy about out of work actresses who are finally getting a break. Yes, it does have wrestling in it but that\u2019s not the point of the show. I really think people get turned off by it before they even watch it because of this preconceived notion about WWF type wrestling. However, it\u2019s really how these women come together as actresses, support each other and work through adversity as they create a campy wrestling tv show in the glorious 1980\u2032s! Bonus: This is based on an ACTUAL tv show called GLOW that came on TV Saturdays mornings in the 80\u2032s. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwbNjHfoNn4\">It\u2019s horrendous, so check it out on YouTube! </a>Alison Brie (Community) and freakin hilarious Marc Maron (WTF Comedy Podcast) star.</p><p>10. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6TZdk1t8Zo\">Barry (HBO) </a>Darkly funny about a hitman played by SNL comedian Bill Hader, who after he gets assigned to eliminate a student in a Hollywood acting class, he decides to stay in the class, quit being a hitman and learn to be an actor. Probably how most actors do it. ;) I was skeptical that Hader could play a serious character after seeing him in SNL. Well, I am happy to report I was dead wrong and he does great. Bonus: Henry Winkler won an Emmy for playing the super funny acting teacher.</p><p>10A. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-3gjXz_HJk\">Get Shorty (Netflix, &amp; Epix)</a>\u00a0This is a badass comedy/drama starring Chris O\u2019dowd and Ray Ramano. Both are fantastic, Chris as a hitman turned movie producer so he can get his wife and daughter back into his life and Ray as the funny veteran sleazyball movie producer. The writing is solid, love the minimalist jazzy scene transition music, and Chris O'Dowd and Ray Romano (I&rsquo;d even go as far as to say he should get an Emmy nod) are in truly top form along with the rest of the cast. Highly recommended if you&rsquo;re into Elmore Leonard novels or the hitman/mobster genre. I saw Romano on the James Corden show and laughed out loud when Ray ended his summary of the show with, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really well done, I just wish people would watch it.&rdquo;. I guess Epix isn\u2019t very popular. :P Neverthelss, it\u2019s really good though. Highly recommended!</p><p>Honorable Mentions</p><p>11.<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9O9SjTABFQ\"> Sick Note (Netflix)</a> It\u2019s a UK oddball comedy with Rupert Grint (Harry Potter red haired kid, \n\nRon Weasley\n\n) and Nick Frost \n\n(Hot Fuzz, Shawn of the Dead)\n\n. Rupert plays Daniel, who works for a health insurance company and gets misdiagnosed with cancer by a doctor played by funnyman Nick Frost. After being misdiagnosed with a fatal disease he begins to notice how everyone around him treats him better, so he decides to keep pretending that he really is sick. This leads to more lies, shenanigans, and well&hellip; real crimes.\n\nAlso, supporting parts are played by Don Johnson (his boss) and Lindsay Lohan (the boss\u2019s daughter)! Don and Lindsay are doing a UK show? Say what?! That\u2019s bananas insane! And yes, it really is because when you see them you wonder \u201cWhy the fuck are they in this British show! They stick out like sore thumbs! Which they really do. Recommended only if you like UK comedy shows or if you want to see some truly awful acting by Don Johnson. I can\u2019t tell if he is acting horrible on purpose or if his acting is just horrible. Cheers mate!</p><p>12. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l3mUjpHMIg\">Fauda (Netflix)</a> If you\u2019re looking for something you\u2019ve never ever seen before in your entire life, then try this hot ACTION drama made in Israel about an Israeli counter terrorism unit. It\u2019s one of the top shows in Israel right now and the lead <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Kk5NM7jEBE\">actor Lior Raz created</a> it and stars in it (also having real Israeli Special Forces experience doing similar things shown in the show). I call Lior the \u2018Israeli \n\n<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=Michael+Chiklis&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgFuLUz9U3MKwoMipWAjONs0tMk7U4Q8JC8h2TS_KLAJGVFCcjAAAA&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjTyeL07qDfAhUNCTQIHWxzCcIQxA0wN3oECA0QBQ\" title=\"Michael Chiklis (Vic Mackey)\">Michael Chiklis\u2019</a>\n\n because he\u2019s got that bald domed head just like Chiklis (The Shield on FX). But I digress&hellip; Fauda shows both sides of the Israel/Palestine conflict, including wives and children etc, and although it is biased since it\u2019s made by Israeli\u2019s, it is mostly in Arabic instead of Hebrew (which doesn\u2019t happen often!) and the first season was shot in an Arab village Kfar Kassem (which was so sketchy that they cancelled the first day of shooting there). Plot: \u201dFauda&quot; (Arabic for &lsquo;Chaos&rsquo;) depicts the two-sided story of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Doron (Lior Raz), a commander of undercover Israeli unit of the Israeli Special Forces operating inside Palestinian territories, leads his team in hunting down Hamas terrorist Abu-Ahmed. \n\nListen dubbed or my preferred method, subtitles. Here is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQ7ut92t8Jo\">Conan O\u2019Brien in a skit with Lior</a>\u00a0and then <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkkVr1T61aY\">Conan being wacky in Israel with military women of the IDF.</a>\u00a0\u00a0This series from Israel continues to be the best title from the country. Now two seasons in, it\u2019s action-packed and easily accessible despite its Hebrew main language barrier.FAUDA, on Netflix. \u201cCool Israeli thriller. With episodes only a little longer than your average sitcom, it&rsquo;s all killer and no filler\u201d.\u2014 Stephen King (@StephenKing) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/StephenKing/status/831306001915719681?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 14, 2017</a></p><p>13. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCwwxNbtK6Y&amp;vl=en\">Kobra Kai (YouTube Premium)</a>. A cool tv show sequel to the original Karate Kid film. Plot: Decades after their 1984 All Valley Karate Tournament bout, a middle-aged Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio) runs a car dealership and Johnny Lawrence works odd jobs but coincidentally they find themselves martial-arts rivals again. I thought it was going to be a comedy, because of the trailer, but nope&hellip; it\u2019s more drama than they <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCwwxNbtK6Y&amp;vl=en\">trailers made it out to be</a>&hellip;although it\u2019s funny at times.\u00a0 JOHNNY!!! PUT EM IN A BODY BAG!!! I think the pilot one is available on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rB36UGoP4Y&amp;vl=en\">YouTube for free</a>.</p><p>14. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxPApTGWwas\">The Last Kingdom (Netflix)</a>. If you like the History Channel show The Vikings or a show about Vikings AND the Saxon English in general, then you\u2019ll probably dig this one. I think it was originally made by the BBC, but don\u2019t let that scare you away as it has quick pacing, and the plot always has solid battles and action in it. Plot: The year is 872, and many of the separate kingdoms of what we now know as England have fallen to the invading Danes. Our hero, Uhtred, was born the son of a Saxon nobleman, and was captured by the Danes and raised as one of their own. Forced to choose between the country of his birth and the people of his upbringing, his loyalties to King Alfred and the Danes are ever tested. What is he? Saxon or Dane? Based on a series of books.</p><p>15. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWxyRG_tckY\">Stranger Things (Netflix)\u00a0</a>\u00a0Plot:\n\nWhen a young boy disappears, his mother, a police chief, and his friends must confront terrifying forces in order to get him back\n\n(from IMDB). Fun 1980\u2032s spooky nostalgia. First season is my favorite so far.</p><p>16. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8_t9pWIZiE\">Atlanta (FX)\u00a0</a>\u00a0Urban drama/comedy. Plot: Based in Atlanta, Earn and his cousin Alfred are trying to make their way up in the world through the rap scene. Along the way they come face to face with social and economic issues touching on race, relationships, poverty, status, and parenthood. First season is my favorite so far (are you sensing a pattern?).</p><p>17.<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWHUjuJ8zxE\"> Jessica Jones (Netflix)</a> It\u2019s about a BADASS super hero Jessica Jones, played by the awesome \n\n<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1269983/?ref_=tt_cl_t1\">Krysten Ritter</a>, who doesn\u2019t like to help people and drinks a lot of booze and sleeps around with different guys. It\u2019s different than your average superhero show and that\u2019s exactly why I like it. Plot: Following the tragic end of her brief superhero career, Jessica Jones tries to rebuild her life as a private investigator, dealing with cases involving people with remarkable abilities in New York City.\u00a0\n\nFirst season with \n\nDavid Tennant (Dr. Who) as the bad guy was the best so far. However, you need to hang in for about 4-5 episodes before it starts to really take off and .</p><p>18.\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69V__a49xtw\">Silicon Valley (HBO) </a>Hilarious comedy about nerds creating a startup company in where else? Silcon Valley.\u00a0 Plot: Follows the struggle of Richard Hendricks (<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3042755/?ref_=tt_cl_t1\">Thomas Middleditch</a>), a Silicon Valley engineer trying to build his own company called Pied Piper.\n\n TONS and TONS of funniness! If you are into tech in any way, you\u2019ll probably love this show. Executive produced by the awesomely super funny Mike Judge (King of the Hill etc).</p><p>19. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2p1osv0jj8\">Lodge 49 (AMC)</a> This show is extremely hard to describe, so I\u2019ll say it\u2019s similar in feel and tone to the Big Lebowski. A Surfer named Dud finds a ring at the beach, then fate leads him to the doorstep of Lodge 49 in Long Beach, CA, a dusty fraternal order that offers cheap beer and strange alchemist philosophies.\n\nThere is nothing like it on TV. It\u2019s just a real chill show&hellip; the story doesn\u2019t really happen, it\u2019s just kind of there, maaaan (The Dude voice). ;) If you don\u2019t like the Big Lebowski, then you\u2019ll want to skip this one. I just added it because it is so different and unique.</p><p>20. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99LZwZmSoNo\">Travelers (Netflix)</a> A pretty cool Canadian sci-fi show produced and starring Eric McCormack (Will from Will &amp; Grace) who plays FBI agent, \n\n<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=Eric+McCormack&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgFuLVT9c3NEzOq4iPrzQpUeLSz9U3ME4zMjcv0OIMCQvJd0wuyS8CAJO-iQcoAAAA&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiJ7oe7w6zfAhWHjlQKHeAkASMQxA0wJnoECAwQBw\" title=\"Eric McCormack (Grant MacLaren)\">Grant MacLaren</a>.

Plot: In a post-apocalyptic future, thousands of special operatives are tasked with preventing the collapse of society. These operatives, known as &ldquo;travelers&rdquo;, have their consciousnesses sent back in time and transferred into the body of present-day individuals who would otherwise be moments from death, to minimize unexpected impact on the timeline. The transfer requires the exact location of the target, made possible by twenty-first century smart phones and GPS. Prepared using social media and public records concerning their targets, each traveler must maintain the host&rsquo;s pre-existing life as cover for the rest of their lives, while carrying out missions in teams of five. These missions are dictated by the Director, an artificial intelligence in the future that monitors the timeline, aimed at saving the world from a series of catastrophic events.</p><p>21. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U94litUpZuc\">Mr. Robot (USA)\u00a0</a>Plot: Young, anti-social computer programmer Elliot works as a cybersecurity engineer during the day, but at night he is a vigilante hacker. He is recruited by the mysterious leader of an underground group of hackers to join their organization. Elliot&rsquo;s task? Help bring down corporate America, including the company he is paid to protect, which presents him with a moral dilemma. Although he works for a corporation, his personal beliefs make it hard to resist the urge to take down the heads of multinational companies that he believes are running &ndash; and ruining &ndash; the world.\n\n</p><p>22. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjRnbOgoAUQ\">Santa Clarita Diet</a> (Netflix)\u00a0 A fun and over the top cheeky comedy. Not as good as Mrs. Maisel or The Good Place, but still something fun to watch on those days you don\u2019t want to do heavy action or drama. Plot: Drew Barrymore and Timothy Olyphant star in this Netflix-original series as married realtors, Sheila and Joel, who are living a quiet life, raising their teenage daughter in Santa Clarita, Calif. Their world unexpectedly changes when Sheila goes through a dramatic transformation that sends her down a road of death and destruction &ndash; but leaves her looking and feeling better than ever. Zombie? Vampire? You decide&hellip; :P</p><p>23. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=522l0YE9hRQ\">Game of Thrones (HBO) </a>- It hasn\u2019t been on in ages, but I\u2019m excited about the last episodes coming up in 2019. Who\u2019s gonna be left to sit on the iron throne? Sure, we all want \n\nDaenerys\n\n to be the one to rule westeros, but then I think to myself,\u00a0\u201cWho is the least likely to sit on the throne?\u201d. Arya? Tyrion? Sansa? Samwell and Gilly? Jaime? Plot: It&rsquo;s the depiction of two powerful families &ndash; kings and queens, knights and renegades, liars and honest men &ndash; playing a deadly game for control of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, and to sit atop the Iron Throne. \n\nOh, and I read some gossip/rumor somewhere that they are casting triplets in the prequel show&hellip;\u00a0</p><p>24. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFZcNKzDhYI\">Big Little Lies (HBO)</a> The first season of this drama was really quite good and second season is in the works. Very solid writing and acting. Plot: Based on the same-titled best-seller by Liane Moriarty, &ldquo;Big Little Lies&rdquo; weaves a darkly comedic tale of murder and mischief in the tranquil beachfront town of Monterey, Calif. Amidst doting moms, successful husbands, beautiful children, and stunning homes exists a community fueled by rumors and divided into haves and have-nots, exposing fractured relationships between husbands and wives, parents and children, and friends and neighbors. \n\n</p><p>25. <a href=\"Narcos:%20Mexico%20%7C%20Netflix%20Official%20Site\">Narcos: Mexico</a></p><p>26.

            "comment": "<p>I really love TV. So my first intention was to list my top 10 shows. Then it became 20 shows, and then it became even more. I initially thought it\u2019d be just the names of the shows and no description at all but, just a quick simple list, but well\u2026 that didn\u2019t go as planned either. I mean if I want you to take my list serious, I gotta give you some reasons why, <i>right</i>? So my TV acolytes, read on if you dare! :) Oh, and I put the trailer links for each show in their title along with some other links sprinkled throughout. Enjoy &amp; happy watching!!</p><p>1.<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2149175/videoplayer/vi2496441881\"> The Americans (Amazon Prime, was on FX)</a> A slow burn, hardcore realistic 1980\u2032s spy/family drama with <i>superb</i> writing and acting. Kerri Russell plays Elizabeth Jennings and is a quintessential,cold blooded bad ass. All of a sudden she\u2019ll just pull out a silenced pistol and BOOM! Blow someone away in half a second\u2026but to be fair, the people she kills had it coming\u2026well, usually\u2026except for that grandmother that one time\u2026 and I\u2019m not kidding. Although it can be slow paced at times, there are shocking moments so intense they\u2019ll make you think,\u00a0\u201cHoly fuckin\u2019 shit!\u201d. Along with the Russian and FBI spy craft the other part of the show is about the Jennings family, Elizabeth and Philip and their two kids Paige and Henry and how they go about their daily\u00a0<i>norma</i>l lives \u2013so basically the show is half spy and half family drama. Initially, I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d like the family drama part of the show but the Jennings family really grows on you, you really care about them after all the seasons, along with their neighbor Stan Beeman and \n\nNina Sergeevna. Overall, this is a killer show (pun intended), and it almost rivals The Wire in my opinion, it\u2019s that good. I can\u2019t say enough good things about it, but I\u2019ll end with, \u201cWould I recommend <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Americans_(2013_TV_series)\">The Americans</a>\u201d? The short answer is\u00a0\u201cda!\u201d and the long answer is \u201copredelenno\u201d (definitely)! Thanks google translate!</p><p>2. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MBjBavIC9U\">Killing Eve (BBCA)</a> This is a less realistic, cat and mouse spy drama, but bloody hell does it pack a punch. Sandra Oh is insanely good as a MI5 desk jockey. She\u2019s an intelligence analyst named Eve, who gets fixated on following the trail of a complete badass, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq1871YNaWA\">Villanelle (Jodie Comer)</a>, \n\nwho incidentally happens to be one of the<i> craziest</i> international assassins you\u2019ve ever seen. Have you ever seen an assassin go to her therapist in a pink tulle dress that looks like a tutu? I think not. If I recall, Villanelle takes out about a handful of people in just the first episode. Sandra was nominated for an Emmy and the show got renewed for a second season before the first episode even aired! Like how often does that happen? Hardly ever! So if you liked Sandra as Dr. Yang in Grey\u2019s, you\u2019ll probably love her here too! It has a playful tone at times but really tense moments as well, plus it\u2019s such a freaking badass show! I really love &amp; enjoy this show, and okay, yes, I\u2019ve used badass too much, sue go ahead and sue me. Now, go watch this girl power show! Bonus: If you like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_Eve\">Killing Eve</a>\u00a0then you <i>might</i> like<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5Uv6cb9YRs\"> Fleabag (Amazon Prime)</a> or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDWRERhKPBs\">Crashing (Netflix),</a> which are kind of oddball UK comedies. They\u2019re created and both star\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=Phoebe+Waller-Bridge&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAOPgE-LVT9c3NEy3LCsxTynLU-LSz9U3yMgyyzKv0pLMTrbSLykDoviCovz0osRcq_KizJLUomIAFahA1TgAAAA&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiVmLnZnqHfAhXix1QKHcFkDHMQmxMoATA7egQIChAT\">Phoebe Waller-Bridge</a>\u00a0(played the voice of the British sounding robot in\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3778644?ref_=nm_ov_bio_lk1\">Solo: A Star Wars Story</a>), who also executive produces and writes Killing Eve. She\u2019s very talented! So go get a friend\u2019s cable password and get the BBCA app and binge it today\u2026 it\u2019s British made, so only 10 episodes! Cheers!</p><p>3. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVLiDETfx1c\">The Handmaid\u2019s Tale (Hulu)</a> Amazingly gripping &amp; dark portrayal of a world gone mad. Set in a dystopian future, a woman is forced to live as a concubine under a fundamentalist theocratic dictatorship.\n\n This one is really soooo freaking heavy it\u2019ll sit with you for a long time. Seriously, this one can effect your psyche. Elisabeth Moss (Mad Men) is such a powerhouse as the lead Offred in this one (I didn\u2019t use badass either! But I could have!). It won a ton of Emmys for the first season, and that season is truly a masterpiece. With some of my friends at work, when I walk by them I\u2019ll say, \u201cBlessed be the fruit.\u201d and\u00a0\u201cUnder his eye.\u201d. It cracks us up. If you can withstand a ultra intense show about theocratic oppression, then <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Handmaid%27s_Tale\">The Handmaid\u2019s Tale </a>is for you. It\u2019s really good though, I swear! Praise be! ***WARNING NOTE*** This show contains a lot of well\u2026it\u2019s even hard to type\u2026 religious rape, abuse, murder\u2014basically all things evil. I swear it\u2019s the one of the darkest show I\u2019ve ever seen in my entire life (I think the Following was pretty dark too, right?). Nevertheless,\u00a0<i><b>VIEWER DISCRETION IS ADVISED x A MILLION</b>. In fact, certain scenes made me physically\u00a0cringe in disgust, with my mouth dropping open in shock &amp; horror. Now on to something a bit lighter\u2026</i></p><p>4. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOmwkTrW4OQ\">The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel (Amazon Prime)</a> Funny and heartfelt, this show has extremely beautiful costumes and wonderfully authentic sets and is about a 1950\u2032s N.Y. Jewish housewife (Emmy winner\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3014031/?ref_=tt_cl_t1\">Rachel Brosnahan</a>) who dreams of being a stand up comic. It\u2019s already won Emmys for lead comedy actress Brosnahan, supporting actress Borstein, as well as best comedy. Really good for a wide age range of adults (you can watch it with your parents and they\u2019ll tell you all about their good old days, I\u2019m sure! \u2013it does have some cursing and brief topless nudity in one sequence though). <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001724/\">Tony Shalub</a> (Monk),\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0097504/?ref_=tt_cl_t5\">Alex Borstein</a>\u00a0(Family Guy)\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0385792/?ref_=tt_cl_t4\">Marin Hinkle</a>\u00a0(Two and a Half Men) are also awesome in it! I mean so awesome they\u2019re almost badass! :) Oy vey! Did I just say that!?!</p><p>5. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hAXVqrljbs\">Ozark (Netflix)</a> One of Jason Bateman\u2019s finest performances, <i>if not his best!</i>\u00a0 Jason was even Emmy nominated, but lost to Matthew Rhys from the Americans. It also stars the fantastic Laura Linney (HBO\u2019s John Adams) as Jason\u2019s wife. This taunt drama has a heavy, moody, forresty atmosphere to it. And yes, I just said forresty\u2026 I know it\u2019s not a word but we\u2019re in the Ozarks. Plot: It\u2019s about an average guy, a financial CPA type adviser, who launders money for the Mexican cartel. Then of course everything goes wrong\u2026 and then well\u2026 let\u2019s take the family, pack\u2019em up and go to the Ozarks! It kicks off about 15-20 minutes into the first episode, so don\u2019t quit watching until you get past the shocking inciting incident, it\u2019s worth it! I watched 10 minutes when it first came out, then turned it off. Then a year later my friend said, \u201cHey, it\u2019s really good.\u201d I was like, \u201cReally? Because I quit watching during the start of the first episode.\u201d. He said, \u201cDuuuude, just watch the rest of it. It\u2019s good.\u201d \u201c<i>Okaaaayyyyy, </i>if you say so<i>.</i>\u201d I replied. I\u2019m happy to report, he was 100% correct. A really solid crime &amp; family drama set in wherever the fuck the Ozarks are\u2026 I think they make up some huge national parks\u2026 maybe in Arkansas or Oklahoma? I\u2019m in California so really, how the fuck would I know? The family starts in Chicago so I\u2019m going with\u2026 the Missouri Ozarks for $500 Alex.\u00a0</p><p>6. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzayf9GpXCI\">The Man in the High Castle (Amazon Prime)</a> A 1950-1960\u2032s period piece that is spooky as hell because in this alternate universe the Germans and Japanese won World War II! Can you believe that?!? <b>Nein, </b>me either! The Germans run the east coast while the Japanese run the west, in the middle is a sort of no man\u2019s land free zone. Anyways, there are some bootleg films floating around the country about the U.S. winning the war\u00a0 and your brain will go trippin and say \u201cWhoa!\u201d when you see a huge Nazi flag draped over the Statue of Liberty. A ton of great actors in this drama, with\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=Alexa+Davalos&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgFuLWz9U3MDTKyy2oTFHiBHEsjC2MzbU4Q8JC8h2TS_KLAPyqxoolAAAA&amp;sa=X&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiWzfSBkKHfAhVMlCwKHT08BUoQxA0wMXoECAkQBQ\" title=\"Alexa Davalos (Juliana Crain)\">Alexa Davalos</a>is as the badass lead, \n\nJuliana Crain. When I think of the word crain I think of the crane kick in the original Karate Kid movie. Based on a sci fi author Philip K Dick story\u2026no, not the Karate Kid, The Man in the High Castle is base on a Phillip K Dick story. Wait.. have you ever heard of a low castle? What would you call that then, a basement? Underground parking? Wait..that gives me an idea for recommendation #13. Sorry, I\u2019ve had too much caffeine today! Wait, it\u2019s 3:00 o\u2019clock in the morning!</p><p>7. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfBgT5djaQw\">The Good Place (NBC &amp; Netflix)</a>\u00a0Holy shirtballs folks! The Good Place is a zany, quick witted comedy about Kristin Bell (Veronica Ma, House of Lies, Frozen) going to heaven after she dies wherein the forking awesome Ted Danson (Cheers) guides her around, well, The Good Place. There is also a weekly podcast after each episode that is really cool where the ash-hole antagonist of the show, Shawn (\n\n<a href=\"http://thegoodplace.wikia.com/wiki/Marc_Evan_Jackson\" title=\"Marc Evan Jackson\">Marc Evan Jackson</a>\u00a0), interviews everyone involved in the show from writers to actors to FX to props and even animal handlers, pretty much everyone involved at one point or another. Also, you can actually drive through, well, be driven through the entire Good Place town square set at Universal Studios if you take their tram tour. Produced by the creator of Parks and Rec Michael Schur, so it\u2019s definitely just as good as Ron Swanson playing the sax or a concert by Mouse Rat!</p><p>8. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK_70f7PamE\">Better Call Saul (AMC)</a> If you like Breaking Bad, you\u2019ll love Bob Odenkirk as you see the origins of his shifty lawyer character, Saul Goodman. Plus from Breaking Bad you get more of characters like Tuco, Gus Fring and Mike\u00a0\n\nEhrmantraut. I\u2019m sad to say that Walter White or Jesse Pinkman have not shown up yet. So what do I have to say about that?\u00a0\u00a0\u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVR476WHmR8\">YO, BITCH!\u201d</a>\u00a0get with the program!</p><p>9.<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZqDO6cTYVY&amp;t=31s\"> G.L.O.W. (Netflix) </a>A girl power dark comedy about out of work actresses who are finally getting a break. Yes, it does have wrestling in it but that\u2019s not the point of the show. I really think people get turned off by it before they even watch it because of this preconceived notion about WWF type wrestling. However, it\u2019s really how these women come together as actresses, support each other and work through adversity as they create a campy wrestling tv show in the glorious 1980\u2032s! Bonus: This is based on an ACTUAL tv show called GLOW that came on TV Saturdays mornings in the 80\u2032s. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwbNjHfoNn4\">It\u2019s horrendous, so check it out on YouTube! </a>Alison Brie (Community) and freakin hilarious Marc Maron (WTF Comedy Podcast) star.</p><p>10. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6TZdk1t8Zo\">Barry (HBO) </a>Darkly funny about a hitman played by SNL comedian Bill Hader, who after he gets assigned to eliminate a student in a Hollywood acting class, he decides to stay in the class, quit being a hitman and learn to be an actor. Probably how most actors do it. ;) I was skeptical that Hader could play a serious character after seeing him in SNL. Well, I am happy to report I was dead wrong and he does great. Bonus: Henry Winkler won an Emmy for playing the super funny acting teacher.</p><p>10A. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-3gjXz_HJk\">Get Shorty (Netflix, &amp; Epix)</a>\u00a0This is a badass comedy/drama starring Chris O\u2019dowd and Ray Ramano. Both are fantastic, Chris as a hitman turned movie producer so he can get his wife and daughter back into his life and Ray as the funny veteran sleazyball movie producer. The writing is solid, love the minimalist jazzy scene transition music, and Chris O'Dowd and Ray Romano (I\u2019d even go as far as to say he should get an Emmy nod) are in truly top form along with the rest of the cast. Highly recommended if you\u2019re into Elmore Leonard novels or the hitman/mobster genre. I saw Romano on the James Corden show and laughed out loud when Ray ended his summary of the show with, \u201cIt\u2019s really well done, I just wish people would watch it.\u201d. I guess Epix isn\u2019t very popular. :P Neverthelss, it\u2019s really good though. Highly recommended!</p><p>Honorable Mentions</p><p>11.<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9O9SjTABFQ\"> Sick Note (Netflix)</a> It\u2019s a UK oddball comedy with Rupert Grint (Harry Potter red haired kid, \n\nRon Weasley\n\n) and Nick Frost \n\n(Hot Fuzz, Shawn of the Dead)\n\n. Rupert plays Daniel, who works for a health insurance company and gets misdiagnosed with cancer by a doctor played by funnyman Nick Frost. After being misdiagnosed with a fatal disease he begins to notice how everyone around him treats him better, so he decides to keep pretending that he really is sick. This leads to more lies, shenanigans, and well\u2026 real crimes.\n\nAlso, supporting parts are played by Don Johnson (his boss) and Lindsay Lohan (the boss\u2019s daughter)! Don and Lindsay are doing a UK show? Say what?! That\u2019s bananas insane! And yes, it really is because when you see them you wonder \u201cWhy the fuck are they in this British show! They stick out like sore thumbs! Which they really do. Recommended only if you like UK comedy shows or if you want to see some truly awful acting by Don Johnson. I can\u2019t tell if he is acting horrible on purpose or if his acting is just horrible. Cheers mate!</p><p>12. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l3mUjpHMIg\">Fauda (Netflix)</a> If you\u2019re looking for something you\u2019ve never ever seen before in your entire life, then try this hot ACTION drama made in Israel about an Israeli counter terrorism unit. It\u2019s one of the top shows in Israel right now and the lead <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Kk5NM7jEBE\">actor Lior Raz created</a> it and stars in it (also having real Israeli Special Forces experience doing similar things shown in the show). I call Lior the \u2018Israeli \n\n<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=Michael+Chiklis&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgFuLUz9U3MKwoMipWAjONs0tMk7U4Q8JC8h2TS_KLAJGVFCcjAAAA&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjTyeL07qDfAhUNCTQIHWxzCcIQxA0wN3oECA0QBQ\" title=\"Michael Chiklis (Vic Mackey)\">Michael Chiklis\u2019</a>\n\n because he\u2019s got that bald domed head just like Chiklis (The Shield on FX). But I digress\u2026 Fauda shows both sides of the Israel/Palestine conflict, including wives and children etc, and although it is biased since it\u2019s made by Israeli\u2019s, it is mostly in Arabic instead of Hebrew (which doesn\u2019t happen often!) and the first season was shot in an Arab village Kfar Kassem (which was so sketchy that they cancelled the first day of shooting there). Plot: \u201dFauda\" (Arabic for \u2018Chaos\u2019) depicts the two-sided story of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Doron (Lior Raz), a commander of undercover Israeli unit of the Israeli Special Forces operating inside Palestinian territories, leads his team in hunting down Hamas terrorist Abu-Ahmed. \n\nListen dubbed or my preferred method, subtitles. Here is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQ7ut92t8Jo\">Conan O\u2019Brien in a skit with Lior</a>\u00a0and then <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkkVr1T61aY\">Conan being wacky in Israel with military women of the IDF.</a>\u00a0\u00a0This series from Israel continues to be the best title from the country. Now two seasons in, it\u2019s action-packed and easily accessible despite its Hebrew main language barrier.FAUDA, on Netflix. \u201cCool Israeli thriller. With episodes only a little longer than your average sitcom, it\u2019s all killer and no filler\u201d.\u2014 Stephen King (@StephenKing) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/StephenKing/status/831306001915719681?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 14, 2017</a></p><p>13. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCwwxNbtK6Y&amp;vl=en\">Kobra Kai (YouTube Premium)</a>. A cool tv show sequel to the original Karate Kid film. Plot: Decades after their 1984 All Valley Karate Tournament bout, a middle-aged Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio) runs a car dealership and Johnny Lawrence works odd jobs but coincidentally they find themselves martial-arts rivals again. I thought it was going to be a comedy, because of the trailer, but nope\u2026 it\u2019s more drama than they <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCwwxNbtK6Y&amp;vl=en\">trailers made it out to be</a>\u2026although it\u2019s funny at times.\u00a0 JOHNNY!!! PUT EM IN A BODY BAG!!! I think the pilot one is available on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rB36UGoP4Y&amp;vl=en\">YouTube for free</a>.</p><p>14. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxPApTGWwas\">The Last Kingdom (Netflix)</a>. If you like the History Channel show The Vikings or a show about Vikings AND the Saxon English in general, then you\u2019ll probably dig this one. I think it was originally made by the BBC, but don\u2019t let that scare you away as it has quick pacing, and the plot always has solid battles and action in it. Plot: The year is 872, and many of the separate kingdoms of what we now know as England have fallen to the invading Danes. Our hero, Uhtred, was born the son of a Saxon nobleman, and was captured by the Danes and raised as one of their own. Forced to choose between the country of his birth and the people of his upbringing, his loyalties to King Alfred and the Danes are ever tested. What is he? Saxon or Dane? Based on a series of books.</p><p>15. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWxyRG_tckY\">Stranger Things (Netflix)\u00a0</a>\u00a0Plot:\n\nWhen a young boy disappears, his mother, a police chief, and his friends must confront terrifying forces in order to get him back\n\n(from IMDB). Fun 1980\u2032s spooky nostalgia. First season is my favorite so far.</p><p>16. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8_t9pWIZiE\">Atlanta (FX)\u00a0</a>\u00a0Urban drama/comedy. Plot: Based in Atlanta, Earn and his cousin Alfred are trying to make their way up in the world through the rap scene. Along the way they come face to face with social and economic issues touching on race, relationships, poverty, status, and parenthood. First season is my favorite so far (are you sensing a pattern?).</p><p>17.<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWHUjuJ8zxE\"> Jessica Jones (Netflix)</a> It\u2019s about a BADASS super hero Jessica Jones, played by the awesome \n\n<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1269983/?ref_=tt_cl_t1\">Krysten Ritter</a>, who doesn\u2019t like to help people and drinks a lot of booze and sleeps around with different guys. It\u2019s different than your average superhero show and that\u2019s exactly why I like it. Plot: Following the tragic end of her brief superhero career, Jessica Jones tries to rebuild her life as a private investigator, dealing with cases involving people with remarkable abilities in New York City.\u00a0\n\nFirst season with \n\nDavid Tennant (Dr. Who) as the bad guy was the best so far. However, you need to hang in for about 4-5 episodes before it starts to really take off and .</p><p>18.\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69V__a49xtw\">Silicon Valley (HBO) </a>Hilarious comedy about nerds creating a startup company in where else? Silcon Valley.\u00a0 Plot: Follows the struggle of Richard Hendricks (<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3042755/?ref_=tt_cl_t1\">Thomas Middleditch</a>), a Silicon Valley engineer trying to build his own company called Pied Piper.\n\n TONS and TONS of funniness! If you are into tech in any way, you\u2019ll probably love this show. Executive produced by the awesomely super funny Mike Judge (King of the Hill etc).</p><p>19. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2p1osv0jj8\">Lodge 49 (AMC)</a> This show is extremely hard to describe, so I\u2019ll say it\u2019s similar in feel and tone to the Big Lebowski. A Surfer named Dud finds a ring at the beach, then fate leads him to the doorstep of Lodge 49 in Long Beach, CA, a dusty fraternal order that offers cheap beer and strange alchemist philosophies.\n\nThere is nothing like it on TV. It\u2019s just a real chill show\u2026 the story doesn\u2019t really happen, it\u2019s just kind of there, maaaan (The Dude voice). ;) If you don\u2019t like the Big Lebowski, then you\u2019ll want to skip this one. I just added it because it is so different and unique.</p><p>20. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99LZwZmSoNo\">Travelers (Netflix)</a> A pretty cool Canadian sci-fi show produced and starring Eric McCormack (Will from Will &amp; Grace) who plays FBI agent, \n\n<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=Eric+McCormack&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgFuLVT9c3NEzOq4iPrzQpUeLSz9U3ME4zMjcv0OIMCQvJd0wuyS8CAJO-iQcoAAAA&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiJ7oe7w6zfAhWHjlQKHeAkASMQxA0wJnoECAwQBw\" title=\"Eric McCormack (Grant MacLaren)\">Grant MacLaren</a>.

Plot: In a post-apocalyptic future, thousands of special operatives are tasked with preventing the collapse of society. These operatives, known as \u201ctravelers\u201d, have their consciousnesses sent back in time and transferred into the body of present-day individuals who would otherwise be moments from death, to minimize unexpected impact on the timeline. The transfer requires the exact location of the target, made possible by twenty-first century smart phones and GPS. Prepared using social media and public records concerning their targets, each traveler must maintain the host\u2019s pre-existing life as cover for the rest of their lives, while carrying out missions in teams of five. These missions are dictated by the Director, an artificial intelligence in the future that monitors the timeline, aimed at saving the world from a series of catastrophic events.</p><p>21. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U94litUpZuc\">Mr. Robot (USA)\u00a0</a>Plot: Young, anti-social computer programmer Elliot works as a cybersecurity engineer during the day, but at night he is a vigilante hacker. He is recruited by the mysterious leader of an underground group of hackers to join their organization. Elliot\u2019s task? Help bring down corporate America, including the company he is paid to protect, which presents him with a moral dilemma. Although he works for a corporation, his personal beliefs make it hard to resist the urge to take down the heads of multinational companies that he believes are running \u2013 and ruining \u2013 the world.\n\n</p><p>22. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjRnbOgoAUQ\">Santa Clarita Diet</a> (Netflix)\u00a0 A fun and over the top cheeky comedy. Not as good as Mrs. Maisel or The Good Place, but still something fun to watch on those days you don\u2019t want to do heavy action or drama. Plot: Drew Barrymore and Timothy Olyphant star in this Netflix-original series as married realtors, Sheila and Joel, who are living a quiet life, raising their teenage daughter in Santa Clarita, Calif. Their world unexpectedly changes when Sheila goes through a dramatic transformation that sends her down a road of death and destruction \u2013 but leaves her looking and feeling better than ever. Zombie? Vampire? You decide\u2026 :P</p><p>23. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=522l0YE9hRQ\">Game of Thrones (HBO) </a>- It hasn\u2019t been on in ages, but I\u2019m excited about the last episodes coming up in 2019. Who\u2019s gonna be left to sit on the iron throne? Sure, we all want \n\nDaenerys\n\n to be the one to rule westeros, but then I think to myself,\u00a0\u201cWho is the least likely to sit on the throne?\u201d. Arya? Tyrion? Sansa? Samwell and Gilly? Jaime? Plot: It\u2019s the depiction of two powerful families \u2013 kings and queens, knights and renegades, liars and honest men \u2013 playing a deadly game for control of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, and to sit atop the Iron Throne. \n\nOh, and I read some gossip/rumor somewhere that they are casting triplets in the prequel show\u2026\u00a0</p><p>24. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFZcNKzDhYI\">Big Little Lies (HBO)</a> The first season of this drama was really quite good and second season is in the works. Very solid writing and acting. Plot: Based on the same-titled best-seller by Liane Moriarty, \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d weaves a darkly comedic tale of murder and mischief in the tranquil beachfront town of Monterey, Calif. Amidst doting moms, successful husbands, beautiful children, and stunning homes exists a community fueled by rumors and divided into haves and have-nots, exposing fractured relationships between husbands and wives, parents and children, and friends and neighbors. \n\n</p><p>25. <a href=\"Narcos:%20Mexico%20%7C%20Netflix%20Official%20Site\">Narcos: Mexico</a></p><p>26.

I initially thought it\u2019d be just the names of the shows and no description at all but, just a quick simple list, but well\u2026 that didn\u2019t go as planned either. I mean if I want you to take my list serious, I gotta give you some reasons why, <i>right</i>? So my TV acolytes, read on if you dare! :) Oh, and I put the trailer links for each show in their title along with some other links sprinkled throughout. Enjoy &amp; happy watching!!</p><p>1.<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2149175/videoplayer/vi2496441881\"> The Americans (Amazon Prime, was on FX)</a> A slow burn, hardcore realistic 1980\u2032s spy/family drama with <i>superb</i> writing and acting. Kerri Russell plays Elizabeth Jennings and is a quintessential,cold blooded bad ass. All of a sudden she\u2019ll just pull out a silenced pistol and BOOM! Blow someone away in half a second\u2026but to be fair, the people she kills had it coming\u2026well, usually\u2026except for that grandmother that one time\u2026 and I\u2019m not kidding. Although it can be slow paced at times, there are shocking moments so intense they\u2019ll make you think,\u00a0\u201cHoly fuckin\u2019 shit!\u201d. Along with the Russian and FBI spy craft the other part of the show is about the Jennings family, Elizabeth and Philip and their two kids Paige and Henry and how they go about their daily\u00a0<i>norma</i>l lives \u2013so basically the show is half spy and half family drama. Initially, I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d like the family drama part of the show but the Jennings family really grows on you, you really care about them after all the seasons, along with their neighbor Stan Beeman and \n\nNina Sergeevna. Overall, this is a killer show (pun intended), and it almost rivals The Wire in my opinion, it\u2019s that good. I can\u2019t say enough good things about it, but I\u2019ll end with, \u201cWould I recommend <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Americans_(2013_TV_series)\">The Americans</a>\u201d? The short answer is\u00a0\u201cda!\u201d and the long answer is \u201copredelenno\u201d (definitely)! Thanks google translate!</p><p>2. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MBjBavIC9U\">Killing Eve (BBCA)</a> This is a less realistic, cat and mouse spy drama, but bloody hell does it pack a punch. Sandra Oh is insanely good as a MI5 desk jockey. She\u2019s an intelligence analyst named Eve, who gets fixated on following the trail of a complete badass, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq1871YNaWA\">Villanelle (Jodie Comer)</a>, \n\nwho incidentally happens to be one of the<i> craziest</i> international assassins you\u2019ve ever seen. Have you ever seen an assassin go to her therapist in a pink tulle dress that looks like a tutu? I think not. If I recall, Villanelle takes out about a handful of people in just the first episode. Sandra was nominated for an Emmy and the show got renewed for a second season before the first episode even aired! Like how often does that happen? Hardly ever! So if you liked Sandra as Dr. Yang in Grey\u2019s, you\u2019ll probably love her here too! It has a playful tone at times but really tense moments as well, plus it\u2019s such a freaking badass show! I really love &amp; enjoy this show, and okay, yes, I\u2019ve used badass too much, sue go ahead and sue me. Now, go watch this girl power show! Bonus: If you like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_Eve\">Killing Eve</a>\u00a0then you <i>might</i> like<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5Uv6cb9YRs\"> Fleabag (Amazon Prime)</a> or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDWRERhKPBs\">Crashing (Netflix),</a> which are kind of oddball UK comedies.

She\u2019s very talented! So go get a friend\u2019s cable password and get the BBCA app and binge it today\u2026 it\u2019s British made, so only 10 episodes! Cheers!</p><p>3. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVLiDETfx1c\">The Handmaid\u2019s Tale (Hulu)</a> Amazingly gripping &amp; dark portrayal of a world gone mad. Set in a dystopian future, a woman is forced to live as a concubine under a fundamentalist theocratic dictatorship.\n\n This one is really soooo freaking heavy it\u2019ll sit with you for a long time. Seriously, this one can effect your psyche. Elisabeth Moss (Mad Men) is such a powerhouse as the lead Offred in this one (I didn\u2019t use badass either! But I could have!). It won a ton of Emmys for the first season, and that season is truly a masterpiece. With some of my friends at work, when I walk by them I\u2019ll say, \u201cBlessed be the fruit.\u201d and\u00a0\u201cUnder his eye.\u201d. It cracks us up. If you can withstand a ultra intense show about theocratic oppression, then <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Handmaid%27s_Tale\">The Handmaid\u2019s Tale </a>is for you. It\u2019s really good though, I swear! Praise be! ***WARNING NOTE*** This show contains a lot of well\u2026it\u2019s even hard to type\u2026 religious rape, abuse, murder\u2014basically all things evil. I swear it\u2019s the one of the darkest show I\u2019ve ever seen in my entire life (I think the Following was pretty dark too, right?). Nevertheless,\u00a0<i><b>VIEWER DISCRETION IS ADVISED x A MILLION</b>. In fact, certain scenes made me physically\u00a0cringe in disgust, with my mouth dropping open in shock &amp; horror. Now on to something a bit lighter\u2026</i></p><p>4. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOmwkTrW4OQ\">The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel (Amazon Prime)</a> Funny and heartfelt, this show has extremely beautiful costumes and wonderfully authentic sets and is about a 1950\u2032s N.Y. Jewish housewife (Emmy winner\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3014031/?ref_=tt_cl_t1\">Rachel Brosnahan</a>) who dreams of being a stand up comic. It\u2019s already won Emmys for lead comedy actress Brosnahan, supporting actress Borstein, as well as best comedy. Really good for a wide age range of adults (you can watch it with your parents and they\u2019ll tell you all about their good old days, I\u2019m sure! \u2013it does have some cursing and brief topless nudity in one sequence though). <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001724/\">Tony Shalub</a> (Monk),\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0097504/?ref_=tt_cl_t5\">Alex Borstein</a>\u00a0(Family Guy)\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0385792/?ref_=tt_cl_t4\">Marin Hinkle</a>\u00a0(Two and a Half Men) are also awesome in it! I mean so awesome they\u2019re almost badass! :) Oy vey! Did I just say that!?!</p><p>5. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hAXVqrljbs\">Ozark (Netflix)</a> One of Jason Bateman\u2019s finest performances, <i>if not his best!</i>\u00a0 Jason was even Emmy nominated, but lost to Matthew Rhys from the Americans. It also stars the fantastic Laura Linney (HBO\u2019s John Adams) as Jason\u2019s wife. This taunt drama has a heavy, moody, forresty atmosphere to it. And yes, I just said forresty\u2026 I know it\u2019s not a word but we\u2019re in the Ozarks. Plot: It\u2019s about an average guy, a financial CPA type adviser, who launders money for the Mexican cartel. Then of course everything goes wrong\u2026 and then well\u2026 let\u2019s take the family, pack\u2019em up and go to the Ozarks! It kicks off about 15-20 minutes into the first episode, so don\u2019t quit watching until you get past the shocking inciting incident, it\u2019s worth it! I watched 10 minutes when it first came out, then turned it off. Then a year later my friend said, \u201cHey, it\u2019s really good.\u201d I was like, \u201cReally? Because I quit watching during the start of the first episode.\u201d. He said, \u201cDuuuude, just watch the rest of it. It\u2019s good.\u201d \u201c<i>Okaaaayyyyy, </i>if you say so<i>.</i>\u201d I replied. I\u2019m happy to report, he was 100% correct. A really solid crime &amp; family drama set in wherever the fuck the Ozarks are\u2026 I think they make up some huge national parks\u2026 maybe in Arkansas or Oklahoma? I\u2019m in California so really, how the fuck would I know? The family starts in Chicago so I\u2019m going with\u2026 the Missouri Ozarks for $500 Alex.\u00a0</p><p>6. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzayf9GpXCI\">The Man in the High Castle (Amazon Prime)</a> A 1950-1960\u2032s period piece that is spooky as hell because in this alternate universe the Germans and Japanese won World War II! Can you believe that?!? <b>Nein, </b>me either! The Germans run the east coast while the Japanese run the west, in the middle is a sort of no man\u2019s land free zone. Anyways, there are some bootleg films floating around the country about the U.S. winning the war\u00a0 and your brain will go trippin and say \u201cWhoa!\u201d when you see a huge Nazi flag draped over the Statue of Liberty. A ton of great actors in this drama, with\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=Alexa+Davalos&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgFuLWz9U3MDTKyy2oTFHiBHEsjC2MzbU4Q8JC8h2TS_KLAPyqxoolAAAA&amp;sa=X&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiWzfSBkKHfAhVMlCwKHT08BUoQxA0wMXoECAkQBQ\" title=\"Alexa Davalos (Juliana Crain)\">Alexa Davalos</a>is as the badass lead, \n\nJuliana Crain. When I think of the word crain I think of the crane kick in the original Karate Kid movie. Based on a sci fi author Philip K Dick story\u2026no, not the Karate Kid, The Man in the High Castle is base on a Phillip K Dick story. Wait.. have you ever heard of a low castle? What would you call that then, a basement? Underground parking? Wait..that gives me an idea for recommendation #13. Sorry, I\u2019ve had too much caffeine today! Wait, it\u2019s 3:00 o\u2019clock in the morning!</p><p>7. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfBgT5djaQw\">The Good Place (NBC &amp; Netflix)</a>\u00a0Holy shirtballs folks! The Good Place is a zany, quick witted comedy about Kristin Bell (Veronica Ma, House of Lies, Frozen) going to heaven after she dies wherein the forking awesome Ted Danson (Cheers) guides her around, well, The Good Place. There is also a weekly podcast after each episode that is really cool where the ash-hole antagonist of the show, Shawn (\n\n<a href=\"http://thegoodplace.wikia.com/wiki/Marc_Evan_Jackson\" title=\"Marc Evan Jackson\">Marc Evan Jackson</a>\u00a0), interviews everyone involved in the show from writers to actors to FX to props and even animal handlers, pretty much everyone involved at one point or another. Also, you can actually drive through, well, be driven through the entire Good Place town square set at Universal Studios if you take their tram tour. Produced by the creator of Parks and Rec Michael Schur, so it\u2019s definitely just as good as Ron Swanson playing the sax or a concert by Mouse Rat!</p><p>8. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK_70f7PamE\">Better Call Saul (AMC)</a> If you like Breaking Bad, you\u2019ll love Bob Odenkirk as you see the origins of his shifty lawyer character, Saul Goodman. Plus from Breaking Bad you get more of characters like Tuco, Gus Fring and Mike\u00a0\n\nEhrmantraut. I\u2019m sad to say that Walter White or Jesse Pinkman have not shown up yet. So what do I have to say about that?\u00a0\u00a0\u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVR476WHmR8\">YO, BITCH!\u201d</a>\u00a0get with the program!</p><p>9.<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZqDO6cTYVY&amp;t=31s\"> G.L.O.W. (Netflix) </a>A girl power dark comedy about out of work actresses who are finally getting a break. Yes, it does have wrestling in it but that\u2019s not the point of the show. I really think people get turned off by it before they even watch it because of this preconceived notion about WWF type wrestling. However, it\u2019s really how these women come together as actresses, support each other and work through adversity as they create a campy wrestling tv show in the glorious 1980\u2032s! Bonus: This is based on an ACTUAL tv show called GLOW that came on TV Saturdays mornings in the 80\u2032s. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwbNjHfoNn4\">It\u2019s horrendous, so check it out on YouTube! </a>Alison Brie (Community) and freakin hilarious Marc Maron (WTF Comedy Podcast) star.</p><p>10. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6TZdk1t8Zo\">Barry (HBO) </a>Darkly funny about a hitman played by SNL comedian Bill Hader, who after he gets assigned to eliminate a student in a Hollywood acting class, he decides to stay in the class, quit being a hitman and learn to be an actor. Probably how most actors do it. ;) I was skeptical that Hader could play a serious character after seeing him in SNL. Well, I am happy to report I was dead wrong and he does great. Bonus: Henry Winkler won an Emmy for playing the super funny acting teacher.</p><p>10A. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-3gjXz_HJk\">Get Shorty (Netflix, &amp; Epix)</a>\u00a0This is a badass comedy/drama starring Chris O\u2019dowd and Ray Ramano. Both are fantastic, Chris as a hitman turned movie producer so he can get his wife and daughter back into his life and Ray as the funny veteran sleazyball movie producer. The writing is solid, love the minimalist jazzy scene transition music, and Chris O'Dowd and Ray Romano (I\u2019d even go as far as to say he should get an Emmy nod) are in truly top form along with the rest of the cast. Highly recommended if you\u2019re into Elmore Leonard novels or the hitman/mobster genre. I saw Romano on the James Corden show and laughed out loud when Ray ended his summary of the show with, \u201cIt\u2019s really well done, I just wish people would watch it.\u201d. I guess Epix isn\u2019t very popular. :P Neverthelss, it\u2019s really good though. Highly recommended!</p><p>Honorable Mentions</p><p>11.<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9O9SjTABFQ\"> Sick Note (Netflix)</a> It\u2019s a UK oddball comedy with Rupert Grint (Harry Potter red haired kid, \n\nRon Weasley\n\n) and Nick Frost \n\n(Hot Fuzz, Shawn of the Dead)\n\n. Rupert plays Daniel, who works for a health insurance company and gets misdiagnosed with cancer by a doctor played by funnyman Nick Frost. After being misdiagnosed with a fatal disease he begins to notice how everyone around him treats him better, so he decides to keep pretending that he really is sick. This leads to more lies, shenanigans, and well\u2026 real crimes.\n\nAlso, supporting parts are played by Don Johnson (his boss) and Lindsay Lohan (the boss\u2019s daughter)! Don and Lindsay are doing a UK show? Say what?! That\u2019s bananas insane! And yes, it really is because when you see them you wonder \u201cWhy the fuck are they in this British show! They stick out like sore thumbs! Which they really do. Recommended only if you like UK comedy shows or if you want to see some truly awful acting by Don Johnson. I can\u2019t tell if he is acting horrible on purpose or if his acting is just horrible. Cheers mate!</p><p>12. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l3mUjpHMIg\">Fauda (Netflix)</a> If you\u2019re looking for something you\u2019ve never ever seen before in your entire life, then try this hot ACTION drama made in Israel about an Israeli counter terrorism unit. It\u2019s one of the top shows in Israel right now and the lead <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Kk5NM7jEBE\">actor Lior Raz created</a> it and stars in it (also having real Israeli Special Forces experience doing similar things shown in the show). I call Lior the \u2018Israeli \n\n<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=Michael+Chiklis&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgFuLUz9U3MKwoMipWAjONs0tMk7U4Q8JC8h2TS_KLAJGVFCcjAAAA&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjTyeL07qDfAhUNCTQIHWxzCcIQxA0wN3oECA0QBQ\" title=\"Michael Chiklis (Vic Mackey)\">Michael Chiklis\u2019</a>\n\n because he\u2019s got that bald domed head just like Chiklis (The Shield on FX). But I digress\u2026 Fauda shows both sides of the Israel/Palestine conflict, including wives and children etc, and although it is biased since it\u2019s made by Israeli\u2019s, it is mostly in Arabic instead of Hebrew (which doesn\u2019t happen often!) and the first season was shot in an Arab village Kfar Kassem (which was so sketchy that they cancelled the first day of shooting there). Plot: \u201dFauda\" (Arabic for \u2018Chaos\u2019) depicts the two-sided story of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Doron (Lior Raz), a commander of undercover Israeli unit of the Israeli Special Forces operating inside Palestinian territories, leads his team in hunting down Hamas terrorist Abu-Ahmed. \n\nListen dubbed or my preferred method, subtitles. Here is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQ7ut92t8Jo\">Conan O\u2019Brien in a skit with Lior</a>\u00a0and then <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkkVr1T61aY\">Conan being wacky in Israel with military women of the IDF.</a>\u00a0\u00a0This series from Israel continues to be the best title from the country. Now two seasons in, it\u2019s action-packed and easily accessible despite its Hebrew main language barrier.FAUDA, on Netflix. \u201cCool Israeli thriller. With episodes only a little longer than your average sitcom, it\u2019s all killer and no filler\u201d.\u2014 Stephen King (@StephenKing) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/StephenKing/status/831306001915719681?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 14, 2017</a></p><p>13. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCwwxNbtK6Y&amp;vl=en\">Kobra Kai (YouTube Premium)</a>. A cool tv show sequel to the original Karate Kid film. Plot: Decades after their 1984 All Valley Karate Tournament bout, a middle-aged Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio) runs a car dealership and Johnny Lawrence works odd jobs but coincidentally they find themselves martial-arts rivals again. I thought it was going to be a comedy, because of the trailer, but nope\u2026 it\u2019s more drama than they <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCwwxNbtK6Y&amp;vl=en\">trailers made it out to be</a>\u2026although it\u2019s funny at times.\u00a0 JOHNNY!!! PUT EM IN A BODY BAG!!! I think the pilot one is available on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rB36UGoP4Y&amp;vl=en\">YouTube for free</a>.</p><p>14. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxPApTGWwas\">The Last Kingdom (Netflix)</a>. If you like the History Channel show The Vikings or a show about Vikings AND the Saxon English in general, then you\u2019ll probably dig this one. I think it was originally made by the BBC, but don\u2019t let that scare you away as it has quick pacing, and the plot always has solid battles and action in it. Plot: The year is 872, and many of the separate kingdoms of what we now know as England have fallen to the invading Danes. Our hero, Uhtred, was born the son of a Saxon nobleman, and was captured by the Danes and raised as one of their own. Forced to choose between the country of his birth and the people of his upbringing, his loyalties to King Alfred and the Danes are ever tested. What is he? Saxon or Dane? Based on a series of books.</p><p>15. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWxyRG_tckY\">Stranger Things (Netflix)\u00a0</a>\u00a0Plot:\n\nWhen a young boy disappears, his mother, a police chief, and his friends must confront terrifying forces in order to get him back\n\n(from IMDB). Fun 1980\u2032s spooky nostalgia. First season is my favorite so far.</p><p>16. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8_t9pWIZiE\">Atlanta (FX)\u00a0</a>\u00a0Urban drama/comedy. Plot: Based in Atlanta, Earn and his cousin Alfred are trying to make their way up in the world through the rap scene. Along the way they come face to face with social and economic issues touching on race, relationships, poverty, status, and parenthood. First season is my favorite so far (are you sensing a pattern?).</p><p>17.<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWHUjuJ8zxE\"> Jessica Jones (Netflix)</a> It\u2019s about a BADASS super hero Jessica Jones, played by the awesome \n\n<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1269983/?ref_=tt_cl_t1\">Krysten Ritter</a>, who doesn\u2019t like to help people and drinks a lot of booze and sleeps around with different guys. It\u2019s different than your average superhero show and that\u2019s exactly why I like it. Plot: Following the tragic end of her brief superhero career, Jessica Jones tries to rebuild her life as a private investigator, dealing with cases involving people with remarkable abilities in New York City.\u00a0\n\nFirst season with \n\nDavid Tennant (Dr. Who) as the bad guy was the best so far. However, you need to hang in for about 4-5 episodes before it starts to really take off and .</p><p>18.\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69V__a49xtw\">Silicon Valley (HBO) </a>Hilarious comedy about nerds creating a startup company in where else? Silcon Valley.\u00a0 Plot: Follows the struggle of Richard Hendricks (<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3042755/?ref_=tt_cl_t1\">Thomas Middleditch</a>), a Silicon Valley engineer trying to build his own company called Pied Piper.\n\n TONS and TONS of funniness! If you are into tech in any way, you\u2019ll probably love this show. Executive produced by the awesomely super funny Mike Judge (King of the Hill etc).</p><p>19. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2p1osv0jj8\">Lodge 49 (AMC)</a> This show is extremely hard to describe, so I\u2019ll say it\u2019s similar in feel and tone to the Big Lebowski. A Surfer named Dud finds a ring at the beach, then fate leads him to the doorstep of Lodge 49 in Long Beach, CA, a dusty fraternal order that offers cheap beer and strange alchemist philosophies.\n\nThere is nothing like it on TV. It\u2019s just a real chill show\u2026 the story doesn\u2019t really happen, it\u2019s just kind of there, maaaan (The Dude voice). ;) If you don\u2019t like the Big Lebowski, then you\u2019ll want to skip this one. I just added it because it is so different and unique.</p><p>20. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99LZwZmSoNo\">Travelers (Netflix)</a> A pretty cool Canadian sci-fi show produced and starring Eric McCormack (Will from Will &amp; Grace) who plays FBI agent, \n\n<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=Eric+McCormack&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgFuLVT9c3NEzOq4iPrzQpUeLSz9U3ME4zMjcv0OIMCQvJd0wuyS8CAJO-iQcoAAAA&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiJ7oe7w6zfAhWHjlQKHeAkASMQxA0wJnoECAwQBw\" title=\"Eric McCormack (Grant MacLaren)\">Grant MacLaren</a>.

These operatives, known as \u201ctravelers\u201d, have their consciousnesses sent back in time and transferred into the body of present-day individuals who would otherwise be moments from death, to minimize unexpected impact on the timeline. The transfer requires the exact location of the target, made possible by twenty-first century smart phones and GPS. Prepared using social media and public records concerning their targets, each traveler must maintain the host\u2019s pre-existing life as cover for the rest of their lives, while carrying out missions in teams of five.

He is recruited by the mysterious leader of an underground group of hackers to join their organization. Elliot\u2019s task? Help bring down corporate America, including the company he is paid to protect, which presents him with a moral dilemma. Although he works for a corporation, his personal beliefs make it hard to resist the urge to take down the heads of multinational companies that he believes are running \u2013 and ruining \u2013 the world.\n\n</p><p>22. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjRnbOgoAUQ\">Santa Clarita Diet</a> (Netflix)\u00a0 A fun and over the top cheeky comedy. Not as good as Mrs. Maisel or The Good Place, but still something fun to watch on those days you don\u2019t want to do heavy action or drama. Plot: Drew Barrymore and Timothy Olyphant star in this Netflix-original series as married realtors, Sheila and Joel, who are living a quiet life, raising their teenage daughter in Santa Clarita, Calif. Their world unexpectedly changes when Sheila goes through a dramatic transformation that sends her down a road of death and destruction \u2013 but leaves her looking and feeling better than ever.

Who\u2019s gonna be left to sit on the iron throne? Sure, we all want \n\nDaenerys\n\n to be the one to rule westeros, but then I think to myself,\u00a0\u201cWho is the least likely to sit on the throne?\u201d. Arya? Tyrion? Sansa? Samwell and Gilly? Jaime? Plot: It\u2019s the depiction of two powerful families \u2013 kings and queens, knights and renegades, liars and honest men \u2013 playing a deadly game for control of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, and to sit atop the Iron Throne. \n\nOh, and I read some gossip/rumor somewhere that they are casting triplets in the prequel show\u2026\u00a0</p><p>24. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFZcNKzDhYI\">Big Little Lies (HBO)</a> The first season of this drama was really quite good and second season is in the works. Very solid writing and acting. Plot: Based on the same-titled best-seller by Liane Moriarty, \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d weaves a darkly comedic tale of murder and mischief in the tranquil beachfront town of Monterey, Calif. Amidst doting moms, successful husbands, beautiful children, and stunning homes exists a community fueled by rumors and divided into haves and have-nots, exposing fractured relationships between husbands and wives, parents and children, and friends and neighbors. \n\n</p><p>25. <a href=\"Narcos:%20Mexico%20%7C%20Netflix%20Official%20Site\">Narcos: Mexico</a></p><p>26.

                "content": "<p>I really love TV. So my first intention was to list my top 10 shows. Then it became 20 shows, and then it became even more. I initially thought it&rsquo;d be just the names of the shows and no description at all but, just a quick simple list, but well&hellip; that didn&rsquo;t go as planned either. I mean if I want you to take my list serious, I gotta give you some reasons why, <i>right</i>? So my TV acolytes, read on if you dare! :) Oh, and I put the trailer links for each show in their title along with some other links sprinkled throughout. Enjoy &amp; happy watching!!</p><p>1.<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2149175/videoplayer/vi2496441881\"> The Americans (Amazon Prime, was on FX)</a> A slow burn, hardcore realistic 1980&prime;s spy/family drama with <i>superb</i> writing and acting. Kerri Russell plays Elizabeth Jennings and is a quintessential,cold blooded bad ass. All of a sudden she&rsquo;ll just pull out a silenced pistol and BOOM! Blow someone away in half a second&hellip;but to be fair, the people she kills had it coming&hellip;well, usually&hellip;except for that grandmother that one time&hellip; and I&rsquo;m not kidding. Although it can be slow paced at times, there are shocking moments so intense they&rsquo;ll make you think,&nbsp;&ldquo;Holy fuckin&rsquo; shit!&rdquo;. Along with the Russian and FBI spy craft the other part of the show is about the Jennings family, Elizabeth and Philip and their two kids Paige and Henry and how they go about their daily&nbsp;<i>norma</i>l lives &ndash;so basically the show is half spy and half family drama. Initially, I didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d like the family drama part of the show but the Jennings family really grows on you, you really care about them after all the seasons, along with their neighbor Stan Beeman and \n\nNina Sergeevna. Overall, this is a killer show (pun intended), and it almost rivals The Wire in my opinion, it&rsquo;s that good. I can&rsquo;t say enough good things about it, but I&rsquo;ll end with, &ldquo;Would I recommend <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Americans_(2013_TV_series)\">The Americans</a>&rdquo;? The short answer is&nbsp;&ldquo;da!&rdquo; and the long answer is &ldquo;opredelenno&rdquo; (definitely)! Thanks google translate!</p><p>2. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MBjBavIC9U\">Killing Eve (BBCA)</a> This is a less realistic, cat and mouse spy drama, but bloody hell does it pack a punch. Sandra Oh is insanely good as a MI5 desk jockey. She&rsquo;s an intelligence analyst named Eve, who gets fixated on following the trail of a complete badass, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq1871YNaWA\">Villanelle (Jodie Comer)</a>, \n\nwho incidentally happens to be one of the<i> craziest</i> international assassins you&rsquo;ve ever seen. Have you ever seen an assassin go to her therapist in a pink tulle dress that looks like a tutu? I think not. If I recall, Villanelle takes out about a handful of people in just the first episode. Sandra was nominated for an Emmy and the show got renewed for a second season before the first episode even aired! Like how often does that happen? Hardly ever! So if you liked Sandra as Dr. Yang in Grey&rsquo;s, you&rsquo;ll probably love her here too! It has a playful tone at times but really tense moments as well, plus it&rsquo;s such a freaking badass show! I really love &amp; enjoy this show, and okay, yes, I&rsquo;ve used badass too much, sue go ahead and sue me. Now, go watch this girl power show! Bonus: If you like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_Eve\">Killing Eve</a>&nbsp;then you <i>might</i> like<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5Uv6cb9YRs\"> Fleabag (Amazon Prime)</a> or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDWRERhKPBs\">Crashing (Netflix),</a> which are kind of oddball UK comedies. They&rsquo;re created and both star&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=Phoebe+Waller-Bridge&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAOPgE-LVT9c3NEy3LCsxTynLU-LSz9U3yMgyyzKv0pLMTrbSLykDoviCovz0osRcq_KizJLUomIAFahA1TgAAAA&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiVmLnZnqHfAhXix1QKHcFkDHMQmxMoATA7egQIChAT\">Phoebe Waller-Bridge</a>&nbsp;(played the voice of the British sounding robot in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3778644?ref_=nm_ov_bio_lk1\">Solo: A Star Wars Story</a>), who also executive produces and writes Killing Eve. She&rsquo;s very talented! So go get a friend&rsquo;s cable password and get the BBCA app and binge it today&hellip; it&rsquo;s British made, so only 10 episodes! Cheers!</p><p>3. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVLiDETfx1c\">The Handmaid&rsquo;s Tale (Hulu)</a> Amazingly gripping &amp; dark portrayal of a world gone mad. Set in a dystopian future, a woman is forced to live as a concubine under a fundamentalist theocratic dictatorship.\n\n This one is really soooo freaking heavy it&rsquo;ll sit with you for a long time. Seriously, this one can effect your psyche. Elisabeth Moss (Mad Men) is such a powerhouse as the lead Offred in this one (I didn&rsquo;t use badass either! But I could have!). It won a ton of Emmys for the first season, and that season is truly a masterpiece. With some of my friends at work, when I walk by them I&rsquo;ll say, &ldquo;Blessed be the fruit.&rdquo; and&nbsp;&ldquo;Under his eye.&rdquo;. It cracks us up. If you can withstand a ultra intense show about theocratic oppression, then <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Handmaid%27s_Tale\">The Handmaid&rsquo;s Tale </a>is for you. It&rsquo;s really good though, I swear! Praise be! ***WARNING NOTE*** This show contains a lot of well&hellip;it&rsquo;s even hard to type&hellip; religious rape, abuse, murder&mdash;basically all things evil. I swear it&rsquo;s the one of the darkest show I&rsquo;ve ever seen in my entire life (I think the Following was pretty dark too, right?). Nevertheless,&nbsp;<i><b>VIEWER DISCRETION IS ADVISED x A MILLION</b>. In fact, certain scenes made me physically&nbsp;cringe in disgust, with my mouth dropping open in shock &amp; horror. Now on to something a bit lighter&hellip;</i></p><p>4. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOmwkTrW4OQ\">The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel (Amazon Prime)</a> Funny and heartfelt, this show has extremely beautiful costumes and wonderfully authentic sets and is about a 1950&prime;s N.Y. Jewish housewife (Emmy winner&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3014031/?ref_=tt_cl_t1\">Rachel Brosnahan</a>) who dreams of being a stand up comic. It&rsquo;s already won Emmys for lead comedy actress Brosnahan, supporting actress Borstein, as well as best comedy. Really good for a wide age range of adults (you can watch it with your parents and they&rsquo;ll tell you all about their good old days, I&rsquo;m sure! &ndash;it does have some cursing and brief topless nudity in one sequence though). <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001724/\">Tony Shalub</a> (Monk),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0097504/?ref_=tt_cl_t5\">Alex Borstein</a>&nbsp;(Family Guy)&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0385792/?ref_=tt_cl_t4\">Marin Hinkle</a>&nbsp;(Two and a Half Men) are also awesome in it! I mean so awesome they&rsquo;re almost badass! :) Oy vey! Did I just say that!?!</p><p>5. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hAXVqrljbs\">Ozark (Netflix)</a> One of Jason Bateman&rsquo;s finest performances, <i>if not his best!</i>&nbsp; Jason was even Emmy nominated, but lost to Matthew Rhys from the Americans. It also stars the fantastic Laura Linney (HBO&rsquo;s John Adams) as Jason&rsquo;s wife. This taunt drama has a heavy, moody, forresty atmosphere to it. And yes, I just said forresty&hellip; I know it&rsquo;s not a word but we&rsquo;re in the Ozarks. Plot: It&rsquo;s about an average guy, a financial CPA type adviser, who launders money for the Mexican cartel. Then of course everything goes wrong&hellip; and then well&hellip; let&rsquo;s take the family, pack&rsquo;em up and go to the Ozarks! It kicks off about 15-20 minutes into the first episode, so don&rsquo;t quit watching until you get past the shocking inciting incident, it&rsquo;s worth it! I watched 10 minutes when it first came out, then turned it off. Then a year later my friend said, &ldquo;Hey, it&rsquo;s really good.&rdquo; I was like, &ldquo;Really? Because I quit watching during the start of the first episode.&rdquo;. He said, &ldquo;Duuuude, just watch the rest of it. It&rsquo;s good.&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>Okaaaayyyyy, </i>if you say so<i>.</i>&rdquo; I replied. I&rsquo;m happy to report, he was 100% correct. A really solid crime &amp; family drama set in wherever the fuck the Ozarks are&hellip; I think they make up some huge national parks&hellip; maybe in Arkansas or Oklahoma? I&rsquo;m in California so really, how the fuck would I know? The family starts in Chicago so I&rsquo;m going with&hellip; the Missouri Ozarks for $500 Alex.&nbsp;</p><p>6. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzayf9GpXCI\">The Man in the High Castle (Amazon Prime)</a> A 1950-1960&prime;s period piece that is spooky as hell because in this alternate universe the Germans and Japanese won World War II! Can you believe that?!? <b>Nein, </b>me either! The Germans run the east coast while the Japanese run the west, in the middle is a sort of no man&rsquo;s land free zone. Anyways, there are some bootleg films floating around the country about the U.S. winning the war&nbsp; and your brain will go trippin and say &ldquo;Whoa!&rdquo; when you see a huge Nazi flag draped over the Statue of Liberty. A ton of great actors in this drama, with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=Alexa+Davalos&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgFuLWz9U3MDTKyy2oTFHiBHEsjC2MzbU4Q8JC8h2TS_KLAPyqxoolAAAA&amp;sa=X&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiWzfSBkKHfAhVMlCwKHT08BUoQxA0wMXoECAkQBQ\" title=\"Alexa Davalos (Juliana Crain)\">Alexa Davalos</a>is as the badass lead, \n\nJuliana Crain. When I think of the word crain I think of the crane kick in the original Karate Kid movie. Based on a sci fi author Philip K Dick story&hellip;no, not the Karate Kid, The Man in the High Castle is base on a Phillip K Dick story. Wait.. have you ever heard of a low castle? What would you call that then, a basement? Underground parking? Wait..that gives me an idea for recommendation #13. Sorry, I&rsquo;ve had too much caffeine today! Wait, it&rsquo;s 3:00 o&rsquo;clock in the morning!</p><p>7. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfBgT5djaQw\">The Good Place (NBC &amp; Netflix)</a>&nbsp;Holy shirtballs folks! The Good Place is a zany, quick witted comedy about Kristin Bell (Veronica Ma, House of Lies, Frozen) going to heaven after she dies wherein the forking awesome Ted Danson (Cheers) guides her around, well, The Good Place. There is also a weekly podcast after each episode that is really cool where the ash-hole antagonist of the show, Shawn (\n\n<a href=\"http://thegoodplace.wikia.com/wiki/Marc_Evan_Jackson\" title=\"Marc Evan Jackson\">Marc Evan Jackson</a>&nbsp;), interviews everyone involved in the show from writers to actors to FX to props and even animal handlers, pretty much everyone involved at one point or another. Also, you can actually drive through, well, be driven through the entire Good Place town square set at Universal Studios if you take their tram tour. Produced by the creator of Parks and Rec Michael Schur, so it&rsquo;s definitely just as good as Ron Swanson playing the sax or a concert by Mouse Rat!</p><p>8. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK_70f7PamE\">Better Call Saul (AMC)</a> If you like Breaking Bad, you&rsquo;ll love Bob Odenkirk as you see the origins of his shifty lawyer character, Saul Goodman. Plus from Breaking Bad you get more of characters like Tuco, Gus Fring and Mike&nbsp;\n\nEhrmantraut. I&rsquo;m sad to say that Walter White or Jesse Pinkman have not shown up yet. So what do I have to say about that?&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVR476WHmR8\">YO, BITCH!&rdquo;</a>&nbsp;get with the program!</p><p>9.<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZqDO6cTYVY&amp;t=31s\"> G.L.O.W. (Netflix) </a>A girl power dark comedy about out of work actresses who are finally getting a break. Yes, it does have wrestling in it but that&rsquo;s not the point of the show. I really think people get turned off by it before they even watch it because of this preconceived notion about WWF type wrestling. However, it&rsquo;s really how these women come together as actresses, support each other and work through adversity as they create a campy wrestling tv show in the glorious 1980&prime;s! Bonus: This is based on an ACTUAL tv show called GLOW that came on TV Saturdays mornings in the 80&prime;s. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwbNjHfoNn4\">It&rsquo;s horrendous, so check it out on YouTube! </a>Alison Brie (Community) and freakin hilarious Marc Maron (WTF Comedy Podcast) star.</p><p>10. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6TZdk1t8Zo\">Barry (HBO) </a>Darkly funny about a hitman played by SNL comedian Bill Hader, who after he gets assigned to eliminate a student in a Hollywood acting class, he decides to stay in the class, quit being a hitman and learn to be an actor. Probably how most actors do it. ;) I was skeptical that Hader could play a serious character after seeing him in SNL. Well, I am happy to report I was dead wrong and he does great. Bonus: Henry Winkler won an Emmy for playing the super funny acting teacher.</p><p>10A. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-3gjXz_HJk\">Get Shorty (Netflix, &amp; Epix)</a>&nbsp;This is a badass comedy/drama starring Chris O&rsquo;dowd and Ray Ramano. Both are fantastic, Chris as a hitman turned movie producer so he can get his wife and daughter back into his life and Ray as the funny veteran sleazyball movie producer. The writing is solid, love the minimalist jazzy scene transition music, and Chris O'Dowd and Ray Romano (I&rsquo;d even go as far as to say he should get an Emmy nod) are in truly top form along with the rest of the cast. Highly recommended if you&rsquo;re into Elmore Leonard novels or the hitman/mobster genre. I saw Romano on the James Corden show and laughed out loud when Ray ended his summary of the show with, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really well done, I just wish people would watch it.&rdquo;. I guess Epix isn&rsquo;t very popular. :P Neverthelss, it&rsquo;s really good though. Highly recommended!</p><p>Honorable Mentions</p><p>11.<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9O9SjTABFQ\"> Sick Note (Netflix)</a> It&rsquo;s a UK oddball comedy with Rupert Grint (Harry Potter red haired kid, \n\nRon Weasley\n\n) and Nick Frost \n\n(Hot Fuzz, Shawn of the Dead)\n\n. Rupert plays Daniel, who works for a health insurance company and gets misdiagnosed with cancer by a doctor played by funnyman Nick Frost. After being misdiagnosed with a fatal disease he begins to notice how everyone around him treats him better, so he decides to keep pretending that he really is sick. This leads to more lies, shenanigans, and well&hellip; real crimes.\n\nAlso, supporting parts are played by Don Johnson (his boss) and Lindsay Lohan (the boss&rsquo;s daughter)! Don and Lindsay are doing a UK show? Say what?! That&rsquo;s bananas insane! And yes, it really is because when you see them you wonder &ldquo;Why the fuck are they in this British show! They stick out like sore thumbs! Which they really do. Recommended only if you like UK comedy shows or if you want to see some truly awful acting by Don Johnson. I can&rsquo;t tell if he is acting horrible on purpose or if his acting is just horrible. Cheers mate!</p><p>12. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l3mUjpHMIg\">Fauda (Netflix)</a> If you&rsquo;re looking for something you&rsquo;ve never ever seen before in your entire life, then try this hot ACTION drama made in Israel about an Israeli counter terrorism unit. It&rsquo;s one of the top shows in Israel right now and the lead <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Kk5NM7jEBE\">actor Lior Raz created</a> it and stars in it (also having real Israeli Special Forces experience doing similar things shown in the show). I call Lior the &lsquo;Israeli \n\n<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=Michael+Chiklis&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgFuLUz9U3MKwoMipWAjONs0tMk7U4Q8JC8h2TS_KLAJGVFCcjAAAA&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjTyeL07qDfAhUNCTQIHWxzCcIQxA0wN3oECA0QBQ\" title=\"Michael Chiklis (Vic Mackey)\">Michael Chiklis&rsquo;</a>\n\n because he&rsquo;s got that bald domed head just like Chiklis (The Shield on FX). But I digress&hellip; Fauda shows both sides of the Israel/Palestine conflict, including wives and children etc, and although it is biased since it&rsquo;s made by Israeli&rsquo;s, it is mostly in Arabic instead of Hebrew (which doesn&rsquo;t happen often!) and the first season was shot in an Arab village Kfar Kassem (which was so sketchy that they cancelled the first day of shooting there). Plot: &rdquo;Fauda\" (Arabic for &lsquo;Chaos&rsquo;) depicts the two-sided story of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Doron (Lior Raz), a commander of undercover Israeli unit of the Israeli Special Forces operating inside Palestinian territories, leads his team in hunting down Hamas terrorist Abu-Ahmed. \n\nListen dubbed or my preferred method, subtitles. Here is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQ7ut92t8Jo\">Conan O&rsquo;Brien in a skit with Lior</a>&nbsp;and then <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkkVr1T61aY\">Conan being wacky in Israel with military women of the IDF.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;This series from Israel continues to be the best title from the country. Now two seasons in, it&rsquo;s action-packed and easily accessible despite its Hebrew main language barrier.FAUDA, on Netflix. &ldquo;Cool Israeli thriller. With episodes only a little longer than your average sitcom, it&rsquo;s all killer and no filler&rdquo;.&mdash; Stephen King (@StephenKing) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/StephenKing/status/831306001915719681?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 14, 2017</a></p><p>13. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCwwxNbtK6Y&amp;vl=en\">Kobra Kai (YouTube Premium)</a>. A cool tv show sequel to the original Karate Kid film. Plot: Decades after their 1984 All Valley Karate Tournament bout, a middle-aged Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio) runs a car dealership and Johnny Lawrence works odd jobs but coincidentally they find themselves martial-arts rivals again. I thought it was going to be a comedy, because of the trailer, but nope&hellip; it&rsquo;s more drama than they <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCwwxNbtK6Y&amp;vl=en\">trailers made it out to be</a>&hellip;although it&rsquo;s funny at times.&nbsp; JOHNNY!!! PUT EM IN A BODY BAG!!! I think the pilot one is available on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rB36UGoP4Y&amp;vl=en\">YouTube for free</a>.</p><p>14. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxPApTGWwas\">The Last Kingdom (Netflix)</a>. If you like the History Channel show The Vikings or a show about Vikings AND the Saxon English in general, then you&rsquo;ll probably dig this one. I think it was originally made by the BBC, but don&rsquo;t let that scare you away as it has quick pacing, and the plot always has solid battles and action in it. Plot: The year is 872, and many of the separate kingdoms of what we now know as England have fallen to the invading Danes. Our hero, Uhtred, was born the son of a Saxon nobleman, and was captured by the Danes and raised as one of their own. Forced to choose between the country of his birth and the people of his upbringing, his loyalties to King Alfred and the Danes are ever tested. What is he? Saxon or Dane? Based on a series of books.</p><p>15. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWxyRG_tckY\">Stranger Things (Netflix)&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;Plot:\n\nWhen a young boy disappears, his mother, a police chief, and his friends must confront terrifying forces in order to get him back\n\n(from IMDB). Fun 1980&prime;s spooky nostalgia. First season is my favorite so far.</p><p>16. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8_t9pWIZiE\">Atlanta (FX)&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;Urban drama/comedy. Plot: Based in Atlanta, Earn and his cousin Alfred are trying to make their way up in the world through the rap scene. Along the way they come face to face with social and economic issues touching on race, relationships, poverty, status, and parenthood. First season is my favorite so far (are you sensing a pattern?).</p><p>17.<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWHUjuJ8zxE\"> Jessica Jones (Netflix)</a> It&rsquo;s about a BADASS super hero Jessica Jones, played by the awesome \n\n<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1269983/?ref_=tt_cl_t1\">Krysten Ritter</a>, who doesn&rsquo;t like to help people and drinks a lot of booze and sleeps around with different guys. It&rsquo;s different than your average superhero show and that&rsquo;s exactly why I like it. Plot: Following the tragic end of her brief superhero career, Jessica Jones tries to rebuild her life as a private investigator, dealing with cases involving people with remarkable abilities in New York City.&nbsp;\n\nFirst season with \n\nDavid Tennant (Dr. Who) as the bad guy was the best so far. However, you need to hang in for about 4-5 episodes before it starts to really take off and .</p><p>18.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69V__a49xtw\">Silicon Valley (HBO) </a>Hilarious comedy about nerds creating a startup company in where else? Silcon Valley.&nbsp; Plot: Follows the struggle of Richard Hendricks (<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3042755/?ref_=tt_cl_t1\">Thomas Middleditch</a>), a Silicon Valley engineer trying to build his own company called Pied Piper.\n\n TONS and TONS of funniness! If you are into tech in any way, you&rsquo;ll probably love this show. Executive produced by the awesomely super funny Mike Judge (King of the Hill etc).</p><p>19. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2p1osv0jj8\">Lodge 49 (AMC)</a> This show is extremely hard to describe, so I&rsquo;ll say it&rsquo;s similar in feel and tone to the Big Lebowski. A Surfer named Dud finds a ring at the beach, then fate leads him to the doorstep of Lodge 49 in Long Beach, CA, a dusty fraternal order that offers cheap beer and strange alchemist philosophies.\n\nThere is nothing like it on TV. It&rsquo;s just a real chill show&hellip; the story doesn&rsquo;t really happen, it&rsquo;s just kind of there, maaaan (The Dude voice). ;) If you don&rsquo;t like the Big Lebowski, then you&rsquo;ll want to skip this one. I just added it because it is so different and unique.</p><p>20. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99LZwZmSoNo\">Travelers (Netflix)</a> A pretty cool Canadian sci-fi show produced and starring Eric McCormack (Will from Will &amp; Grace) who plays FBI agent, \n\n<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=Eric+McCormack&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgFuLVT9c3NEzOq4iPrzQpUeLSz9U3ME4zMjcv0OIMCQvJd0wuyS8CAJO-iQcoAAAA&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiJ7oe7w6zfAhWHjlQKHeAkASMQxA0wJnoECAwQBw\" title=\"Eric McCormack (Grant MacLaren)\">Grant MacLaren</a>. It also stars first season Hell on Wheels alum&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2311411/\">MacKenzie Porter</a>&nbsp;who does a truly fantastic job in the first episode as traveler \n\n<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=MacKenzie+Porter&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgFuLVT9c3NEzOq4iPrzQpUeLSz9U3SE-uzCjM0-IMCQvJd0wuyS8CAL9qHtkoAAAA&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiJ7oe7w6zfAhWHjlQKHeAkASMQxA0wJnoECAwQBQ\" title=\"MacKenzie Porter (Marcy Warton)\">Marcy Warton</a>. Plot: In a post-apocalyptic future, thousands of special operatives are tasked with preventing the collapse of society. These operatives, known as &ldquo;travelers&rdquo;, have their consciousnesses sent back in time and transferred into the body of present-day individuals who would otherwise be moments from death, to minimize unexpected impact on the timeline. The transfer requires the exact location of the target, made possible by twenty-first century smart phones and GPS. Prepared using social media and public records concerning their targets, each traveler must maintain the host&rsquo;s pre-existing life as cover for the rest of their lives, while carrying out missions in teams of five. These missions are dictated by the Director, an artificial intelligence in the future that monitors the timeline, aimed at saving the world from a series of catastrophic events.</p><p>21. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U94litUpZuc\">Mr. Robot (USA)&nbsp;</a>Plot: Young, anti-social computer programmer Elliot works as a cybersecurity engineer during the day, but at night he is a vigilante hacker. He is recruited by the mysterious leader of an underground group of hackers to join their organization. Elliot&rsquo;s task? Help bring down corporate America, including the company he is paid to protect, which presents him with a moral dilemma. Although he works for a corporation, his personal beliefs make it hard to resist the urge to take down the heads of multinational companies that he believes are running &ndash; and ruining &ndash; the world.\n\n</p><p>22. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjRnbOgoAUQ\">Santa Clarita Diet</a> (Netflix)&nbsp; A fun and over the top cheeky comedy. Not as good as Mrs. Maisel or The Good Place, but still something fun to watch on those days you don&rsquo;t want to do heavy action or drama. Plot: Drew Barrymore and Timothy Olyphant star in this Netflix-original series as married realtors, Sheila and Joel, who are living a quiet life, raising their teenage daughter in Santa Clarita, Calif. Their world unexpectedly changes when Sheila goes through a dramatic transformation that sends her down a road of death and destruction &ndash; but leaves her looking and feeling better than ever. Zombie? Vampire? You decide&hellip; :P</p><p>23. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=522l0YE9hRQ\">Game of Thrones (HBO) </a>- It hasn&rsquo;t been on in ages, but I&rsquo;m excited about the last episodes coming up in 2019. Who&rsquo;s gonna be left to sit on the iron throne? Sure, we all want \n\nDaenerys\n\n to be the one to rule westeros, but then I think to myself,&nbsp;&ldquo;Who is the least likely to sit on the throne?&rdquo;. Arya? Tyrion? Sansa? Samwell and Gilly? Jaime? Plot: It&rsquo;s the depiction of two powerful families &ndash; kings and queens, knights and renegades, liars and honest men &ndash; playing a deadly game for control of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, and to sit atop the Iron Throne. \n\nOh, and I read some gossip/rumor somewhere that they are casting triplets in the prequel show&hellip;&nbsp;</p><p>24. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFZcNKzDhYI\">Big Little Lies (HBO)</a> The first season of this drama was really quite good and second season is in the works. Very solid writing and acting. Plot: Based on the same-titled best-seller by Liane Moriarty, &ldquo;Big Little Lies&rdquo; weaves a darkly comedic tale of murder and mischief in the tranquil beachfront town of Monterey, Calif. Amidst doting moms, successful husbands, beautiful children, and stunning homes exists a community fueled by rumors and divided into haves and have-nots, exposing fractured relationships between husbands and wives, parents and children, and friends and neighbors. \n\n</p><p>25. <a href=\"denied:Narcos:%20Mexico%20%7C%20Netflix%20Official%20Site\">Narcos: Mexico</a></p><p>26.
