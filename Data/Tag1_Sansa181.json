Sansa its the sister who dreams with the domestic life of a wife and mother. Arya is the one who dreams about being a warrior and a fighter. Sansa is the romantic dreamer; Arya the rebel. But both sisters dreams are equal of respect.\u00a0</p><p>Being a mother, build a family, care for your loved ones and live a beautiful love story shouldnt be mocked or considered a lesser dream than being a brave warrior. I believe with this quote George was trying to tells us that girls should be free to choose their own paths and that there isnt just one route they can follow.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>BTW, I found foreshadowing of marriages in BOTH girls stories, its their role in those relationship that differ a little bit&hellip;&hellip;.</p><ul><li><b><i>A CLOAK STAINED IN FIRE AND BLOOD\u2026\u2026..</i></b></li></ul><figure data-orig-width=\"2548\" data-orig-height=\"1404\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/241e525b9cce785585fcb84b40b887c8/tumblr_inline_pkiosaUrXa1sgp768_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2548\" data-orig-height=\"1404\"/></figure><blockquote><p>When she crawled out of bed, long moments later, she was\nalone. <b>She found his cloak on the floor,</b> twisted up tight, <b>the white wool\nstained with blood and fire.</b> The sky outside was darker by then, with only a\nfew pale green ghosts dancing against the stars.

For me this has always been one of\nthe biggest foreshadows on the book and its interesting to notice how George\nused the character of Sandor Cleagane as a redherring for this scene in order\nto not make so obvious the connection with Jon.</p><p><br/></p><p>It was only when our own <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAEktKiv9TzIb_PdYpb7-Yg\">@occupyvenus</a> made the connection of\n<a href=\"https://occupyvenus.tumblr.com/post/171273022748/i-see-you-george-i-see-you\">this particular scene with one that happened a few chapters before In the book\nA CLASH OF KINGS</a>\u00a0, that it became pretty obvious this quote was about Jon Snow.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p><blockquote><p><b>\u201cI\u2019ve never lain with any woman but Cersei.</b> In my own way,\nI\u2019ve been truer than your Ned ever was.

The first\ntime Jon meets Ygritte on \u201cA CLASH OF KINGS\u201d, chapter 51, she tells him a story\nof Bael the Bard and the Blue Winter Rose:<br/></p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;North or south, singers always find a ready welcome,\n<b>so Bael ate at Lord Stark&rsquo;s own table, and played for the lord in his high seat\nuntil half the night was gone.</b> The old songs he played, and new ones he&rsquo;d made\nhimself, and he played and sang so well that when he was done, the lord offered\nto let him name his own reward. <b>&lsquo;All I ask is a flower,</b>&rsquo; Bael answered, &rsquo;<b>the\nfairest flower that blooms in the gardens o&rsquo; Winterfell.&rsquo;</b></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&rdquo;<b>Now as it happened the winter roses had only then come\ninto bloom, and no flower is so rare nor precious. </b>So the Stark sent to his\nglass gardens and commanded that the most beautiful o&rsquo; the winter roses be\nplucked for the singer&rsquo;s payment. And so it was done. But when morning come,\nthe singer had vanished &hellip; and <b>so had Lord Brandon&rsquo;s maiden daughter. Her\nbed they found empty,</b> but for the pale blue rose that Bael had left on the\npillow where her head had lain.&ldquo;</p><p>\u00a0(A Clash of Kings \u2013 Jon VI)</p></blockquote><p><br/></p><p>Right next in the following chapter 52, Sansa has her first\nflowering. This is the chapter where Sansa gets her first period and its now\n\u201cfit to bear children to the King.\u201d</p><blockquote><p>\u00a0&quot;The blood is the seal of\nyour womanhood. Lady Catelyn might have prepared you. You&rsquo;ve <b>had your first flowering, no more.&rdquo;</b>\nSansa had never felt less flowery. &ldquo;My lady mother told me, but I&hellip; I\nthought it would be different.&rdquo;&ldquo;Different how?&rdquo;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t\nknow. Less&hellip; less messy, and more magical.\u201d Queen Cersei laughed. &quot;Wait\nuntil you birth a child, Sansa. A woman&rsquo;s life is nine parts mess to one part\nmagic, you&rsquo;ll learn that soon enough&hellip; and the parts that look like magic\noften turn out to be messiest of all.&rdquo; She took a sip of milk. &ldquo;So\nnow you are a woman.

The following chapter of the book is also JON VII. George\nreally wanted us to picture Jon, Sansa and the Blue Winter Rose tale all\ntogether.

The first\ntime Jon meets Ygritte on \u201cA CLASH OF KINGS\u201d, chapter 51, she tells him a story\nof Bael the Bard and the Blue Winter Rose:<br></p><blockquote><p>\u201cNorth or south, singers always find a ready welcome,\n<b>so Bael ate at Lord Stark\u2019s own table, and played for the lord in his high seat\nuntil half the night was gone.</b> The old songs he played, and new ones he\u2019d made\nhimself, and he played and sang so well that when he was done, the lord offered\nto let him name his own reward. <b>\u2018All I ask is a flower,</b>\u2019 Bael answered, \u2019<b>the\nfairest flower that blooms in the gardens o\u2019 Winterfell.\u2019</b></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201d<b>Now as it happened the winter roses had only then come\ninto bloom, and no flower is so rare nor precious. </b>So the Stark sent to his\nglass gardens and commanded that the most beautiful o\u2019 the winter roses be\nplucked for the singer\u2019s payment. And so it was done. But when morning come,\nthe singer had vanished \u2026 and <b>so had Lord Brandon\u2019s maiden daughter. Her\nbed they found empty,</b> but for the pale blue rose that Bael had left on the\npillow where her head had lain.\u201c</p><p>\u00a0(A Clash of Kings \u2013 Jon VI)</p></blockquote><p><br></p><p>Right next in the following chapter 52, Sansa has her first\nflowering. This is the chapter where Sansa gets her first period and its now\n\u201cfit to bear children to the King.\u201d</p><blockquote><p>\u00a0\"The blood is the seal of\nyour womanhood. Lady Catelyn might have prepared you. You\u2019ve <b>had your first flowering, no more.\u201d</b>\nSansa had never felt less flowery. \u201cMy lady mother told me, but I\u2026 I\nthought it would be different.\u201d\u201cDifferent how?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t\nknow. Less\u2026 less messy, and more magical.\u201d Queen Cersei laughed. \"Wait\nuntil you birth a child, Sansa. A woman\u2019s life is nine parts mess to one part\nmagic, you\u2019ll learn that soon enough\u2026 and the parts that look like magic\noften turn out to be messiest of all.\u201d She took a sip of milk. \u201cSo\nnow you are a woman. Do you have the least idea of what that means?\u201d <b>\u201cIt\nmeans that I am now fit to be wedded and bedded,\u201d said Sansa, \u201cand to\nbear children for the king.\u201d \u2026\u2026.</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><br></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b>Do you want to be loved,\nSansa?</b>\u201c \u201d<b>Everyone wants to be loved.</b>\u201c \"I see flowering hasn\u2019t made you any brighter,\u201d said\nCersei. \u201cSansa, permit me to share a bit of womanly wisdom with you on\nthis very special day. <b>Love is poison. A sweet poison, yes, but it will kill\nyou all the same.\u201d</b></p><p>\u00a0(A Clash of Kings \u2013 Sansa IV)</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In a Clash of Kings chapter 52, Sansa gets her period for\nthe first time. She is taken to see Cersei who uses the moment to give Sansa\nwomanly advice about love. She warns Sansa that love is dangerous and make us\nweaker. The following chapter of the book is JON VII.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cRobert wanted to be loved. My brother Tyrion has the same\ndisease. <b>Do you want to be loved, Sansa?\u201d</b> \u201c<b>Everyone wants to be loved.</b>\u201d \u201cI see\nflowering hasn\u2019t made you any brighter,\u201d said Cersei. \u201cSansa, permit me to\nshare a bit of womanly wisdom with you on this very special day. <b>Love is\npoison. A sweet poison, yes, but it will kill you all the same.\u201d</b></p><p>(A Clash of Kings \u2013 Sansa IV)</p></blockquote><p>In the end of chapter Cersei warns Sansa about love and how\ndangerous it can be. The following chapter of the book is also JON VII. George\nreally wanted us to picture Jon, Sansa and the Blue Winter Rose tale all\ntogether. For me this is one of the biggest clues that not only Jon and Sansa\nwill marry but also, its their child that will continue House Stark.</p><ul><li><b><i>A STORM OF SWORDS \u2013 THE FALLING SNOW</i></b></li></ul><figure data-orig-width=\"2100\" data-orig-height=\"1397\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fb0633bfe0534e64c55153445bc0a56c/tumblr_inline_pkioqvPd611sgp768_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2100\" data-orig-height=\"1397\"></figure><p>In A storm of Swords,\n@twinklingmunchput noticed that George used the prologue of the book to\nforeshadow Jon and Sansa romance, using the snow to symbolize Jon Snow.

Drifting snowflakes brushed her face as light as lover\u2019s kisses, and\nmelted on her cheeks. At the center of the garden, beside the statue of the\nweeping woman that lay broken and half-buried on the ground, she turned her\nface up to the sky and closed her eyes. <b>She\ncould feel the snow on her lashes, taste it on her lips.

If we go back to the prologue\nof the first book, we will find out that surprising, Ser Waymar physical\ndescription is identical of Jon Snow.

The first\ntime Jon meets Ygritte on \u201cA CLASH OF KINGS\u201d, chapter 51, she tells him a story\nof Bael the Bard and the Blue Winter Rose:<br></p><blockquote><p>\u201cNorth or south, singers always find a ready welcome,\n<b>so Bael ate at Lord Stark\u2019s own table, and played for the lord in his high seat\nuntil half the night was gone.</b> The old songs he played, and new ones he\u2019d made\nhimself, and he played and sang so well that when he was done, the lord offered\nto let him name his own reward. <b>\u2018All I ask is a flower,</b>\u2019 Bael answered, \u2019<b>the\nfairest flower that blooms in the gardens o\u2019 Winterfell.\u2019</b></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201d<b>Now as it happened the winter roses had only then come\ninto bloom, and no flower is so rare nor precious. </b>So the Stark sent to his\nglass gardens and commanded that the most beautiful o\u2019 the winter roses be\nplucked for the singer\u2019s payment. And so it was done. But when morning come,\nthe singer had vanished \u2026 and <b>so had Lord Brandon\u2019s maiden daughter. Her\nbed they found empty,</b> but for the pale blue rose that Bael had left on the\npillow where her head had lain.\u201c</p><p>\u00a0(A Clash of Kings \u2013 Jon VI)</p></blockquote><p><br></p><p>Right next in the following chapter 52, Sansa has her first\nflowering. This is the chapter where Sansa gets her first period and its now\n\u201cfit to bear children to the King.\u201d</p><blockquote><p>\u00a0\"The blood is the seal of\nyour womanhood. Lady Catelyn might have prepared you. You\u2019ve <b>had your first flowering, no more.\u201d</b>\nSansa had never felt less flowery. \u201cMy lady mother told me, but I\u2026 I\nthought it would be different.\u201d\u201cDifferent how?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t\nknow. Less\u2026 less messy, and more magical.\u201d Queen Cersei laughed. \"Wait\nuntil you birth a child, Sansa. A woman\u2019s life is nine parts mess to one part\nmagic, you\u2019ll learn that soon enough\u2026 and the parts that look like magic\noften turn out to be messiest of all.\u201d She took a sip of milk. \u201cSo\nnow you are a woman. Do you have the least idea of what that means?\u201d <b>\u201cIt\nmeans that I am now fit to be wedded and bedded,\u201d said Sansa, \u201cand to\nbear children for the king.\u201d \u2026\u2026.</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><br></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b>Do you want to be loved,\nSansa?</b>\u201c \u201d<b>Everyone wants to be loved.</b>\u201c \"I see flowering hasn\u2019t made you any brighter,\u201d said\nCersei. \u201cSansa, permit me to share a bit of womanly wisdom with you on\nthis very special day. <b>Love is poison. A sweet poison, yes, but it will kill\nyou all the same.\u201d</b></p><p>\u00a0(A Clash of Kings \u2013 Sansa IV)</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In a Clash of Kings chapter 52, Sansa gets her period for\nthe first time. She is taken to see Cersei who uses the moment to give Sansa\nwomanly advice about love. She warns Sansa that love is dangerous and make us\nweaker. The following chapter of the book is JON VII.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cRobert wanted to be loved. My brother Tyrion has the same\ndisease. <b>Do you want to be loved, Sansa?\u201d</b> \u201c<b>Everyone wants to be loved.</b>\u201d \u201cI see\nflowering hasn\u2019t made you any brighter,\u201d said Cersei. \u201cSansa, permit me to\nshare a bit of womanly wisdom with you on this very special day. <b>Love is\npoison. A sweet poison, yes, but it will kill you all the same.\u201d</b></p><p>(A Clash of Kings \u2013 Sansa IV)</p></blockquote><p>In the end of chapter Cersei warns Sansa about love and how\ndangerous it can be. The following chapter of the book is also JON VII. George\nreally wanted us to picture Jon, Sansa and the Blue Winter Rose tale all\ntogether. For me this is one of the biggest clues that not only Jon and Sansa\nwill marry but also, its their child that will continue House Stark.</p><ul><li><b><i>A STORM OF SWORDS \u2013 THE FALLING SNOW</i></b></li></ul><figure data-orig-width=\"2100\" data-orig-height=\"1397\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fb0633bfe0534e64c55153445bc0a56c/tumblr_inline_pkioqvPd611sgp768_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2100\" data-orig-height=\"1397\"></figure><p>In A storm of Swords,\n@twinklingmunchput noticed that George used the prologue of the book to\nforeshadow Jon and Sansa romance, using the snow to symbolize Jon Snow.

The first\ntime Jon meets Ygritte on &ldquo;A CLASH OF KINGS&rdquo;, chapter 51, she tells him a story\nof Bael the Bard and the Blue Winter Rose:<br /></p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;North or south, singers always find a ready welcome,\n<b>so Bael ate at Lord Stark&rsquo;s own table, and played for the lord in his high seat\nuntil half the night was gone.</b> The old songs he played, and new ones he&rsquo;d made\nhimself, and he played and sang so well that when he was done, the lord offered\nto let him name his own reward. <b>&lsquo;All I ask is a flower,</b>&rsquo; Bael answered, &rsquo;<b>the\nfairest flower that blooms in the gardens o&rsquo; Winterfell.&rsquo;</b></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&rdquo;<b>Now as it happened the winter roses had only then come\ninto bloom, and no flower is so rare nor precious. </b>So the Stark sent to his\nglass gardens and commanded that the most beautiful o&rsquo; the winter roses be\nplucked for the singer&rsquo;s payment. And so it was done. But when morning come,\nthe singer had vanished &hellip; and <b>so had Lord Brandon&rsquo;s maiden daughter. Her\nbed they found empty,</b> but for the pale blue rose that Bael had left on the\npillow where her head had lain.&ldquo;</p><p>&nbsp;(A Clash of Kings &ndash; Jon VI)</p></blockquote><p><br /></p><p>Right next in the following chapter 52, Sansa has her first\nflowering. This is the chapter where Sansa gets her first period and its now\n&ldquo;fit to bear children to the King.&rdquo;</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;\"The blood is the seal of\nyour womanhood. Lady Catelyn might have prepared you. You&rsquo;ve <b>had your first flowering, no more.&rdquo;</b>\nSansa had never felt less flowery. &ldquo;My lady mother told me, but I&hellip; I\nthought it would be different.&rdquo;&ldquo;Different how?&rdquo;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t\nknow. Less&hellip; less messy, and more magical.&rdquo; Queen Cersei laughed. \"Wait\nuntil you birth a child, Sansa. A woman&rsquo;s life is nine parts mess to one part\nmagic, you&rsquo;ll learn that soon enough&hellip; and the parts that look like magic\noften turn out to be messiest of all.&rdquo; She took a sip of milk. &ldquo;So\nnow you are a woman. Do you have the least idea of what that means?&rdquo; <b>&ldquo;It\nmeans that I am now fit to be wedded and bedded,&rdquo; said Sansa, &ldquo;and to\nbear children for the king.&rdquo; &hellip;&hellip;.</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><br /></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b>Do you want to be loved,\nSansa?</b>&ldquo; &rdquo;<b>Everyone wants to be loved.</b>&ldquo; \"I see flowering hasn&rsquo;t made you any brighter,&rdquo; said\nCersei. &ldquo;Sansa, permit me to share a bit of womanly wisdom with you on\nthis very special day. <b>Love is poison. A sweet poison, yes, but it will kill\nyou all the same.&rdquo;</b></p><p>&nbsp;(A Clash of Kings &ndash; Sansa IV)</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In a Clash of Kings chapter 52, Sansa gets her period for\nthe first time. She is taken to see Cersei who uses the moment to give Sansa\nwomanly advice about love. She warns Sansa that love is dangerous and make us\nweaker. The following chapter of the book is JON VII.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Robert wanted to be loved. My brother Tyrion has the same\ndisease. <b>Do you want to be loved, Sansa?&rdquo;</b> &ldquo;<b>Everyone wants to be loved.</b>&rdquo; &ldquo;I see\nflowering hasn&rsquo;t made you any brighter,&rdquo; said Cersei. &ldquo;Sansa, permit me to\nshare a bit of womanly wisdom with you on this very special day. <b>Love is\npoison. A sweet poison, yes, but it will kill you all the same.&rdquo;</b></p><p>(A Clash of Kings &ndash; Sansa IV)</p></blockquote><p>In the end of chapter Cersei warns Sansa about love and how\ndangerous it can be. The following chapter of the book is also JON VII. George\nreally wanted us to picture Jon, Sansa and the Blue Winter Rose tale all\ntogether. For me this is one of the biggest clues that not only Jon and Sansa\nwill marry but also, its their child that will continue House Stark.</p><ul><li><b><i>A STORM OF SWORDS &ndash; THE FALLING SNOW</i></b></li></ul><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fb0633bfe0534e64c55153445bc0a56c/tumblr_inline_pkioqvPd611sgp768_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>In A storm of Swords,\n@twinklingmunchput noticed that George used the prologue of the book to\nforeshadow Jon and Sansa romance, using the snow to symbolize Jon Snow.

They won&rsquo;t need\nDywen nor Bannen to hunt us down neither, not if we&rsquo;re tracking through fresh\nsnow. And snow hid the shape of the ground, especially by night. A horse could\nstumble over a root, break a leg on a stone. We&rsquo;re done, he realized. Done\nbefore we began. We&rsquo;re lost. There&rsquo;d be no lord&rsquo;s life for the leechman&rsquo;s son,\nno keep to call his own, no wives nor crowns.

Her boots tore ankle-deep\nholes into the smooth white surface of the snow, yet made no sound. Sansa\ndrifted past frosted shrubs and thin dark trees, and wondered if she were still\ndreaming. Drifting snowflakes brushed her face as light as lover&rsquo;s kisses, and\nmelted on her cheeks. At the center of the garden, beside the statue of the\nweeping woman that lay broken and half-buried on the ground, she turned her\nface up to the sky and closed her eyes. <b>She\ncould feel the snow on her lashes, taste it on her lips.

If we go back to the prologue\nof the first book, we will find out that surprising, Ser Waymar physical\ndescription is identical of Jon Snow. George is trying to tell us that Sansa\nwill probably be physical attracted to Jon Snow once she is reunited with him\nlater in the story. &nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>\"Bronze Yohn knows me,&rdquo; she reminded him. &ldquo;He\nwas a guest at Winterfell when his son rode north to take the black.&rdquo; <b>She had fallen wildly in love with Ser\nWaymar, she remembered dimly, but that was a lifetime ago, when she was a\nstupid little girl.</b> &ldquo;And that was not the only time.

Tyrion&rsquo;s desire to protect Sansa comes from a place not only where he is identifying with her as a fellow abuse victim, and also projecting Tysha onto her a bit, but that he on some level wishes that he could be Sansa&rsquo;s &ldquo;knight&rdquo;. Tyrion&rsquo;s thoughts about Sansa or Shae are closely linked to how he&rsquo;ll never be like Jaime or that knight that flirts with Shae on the stairs, or even Loras, he&rsquo;ll never be the one who gets to rescue the maiden, his one moment of glory during the Battle of Blackwater results in him nearly dying and winding up scarred, and in a reduced position of power and even more isolated than he was before.</p><p>Of course the whole idea of chivalry is sexist, which is why Sansa&rsquo;s narrative is largely about deconstructing the relations between knights and ladies, but disabled men are also excluded by chivalry so I find it hard to blame Tyrion for wishing he could inhabit that role.</p><p>I mean the idea that Sansa owes Tyrion anything is complete bullshit, and it&rsquo;s horrible that she is even forced into that position, but I don&rsquo;t understand why people think it&rsquo;s progressive to criticize a disabled person for fantasizing about being a hero.</p><p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s powerful when Tyrion says that he can be good to Sansa or when he compares himself to the Knight of Flowers or when he tells Joffrey that Sansa is not hers to torment or when he thinks about how it&rsquo;s his duty to protect Sansa as her husband. He&rsquo;s doing something that&rsquo;s entirely unexpected of him as a disabled person and presenting himself as someone worthy of the same kind of idealized masculinity that able bodied men are expected to have.</p><p>I also think though that Tywin specifically puts Tyrion into this situation with Sansa because of an expectation that it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether Tyrion is forced to do something dishonorable, like sleep with a child. Tyrion isn&rsquo;t bound by knightly vows so Tywin isn&rsquo;t violating any codes by forcing Tyrion into marriage. Whereas I think people would see it as disreputable if Jaime were forced into a situation like that, Tyrion is both regarded as a threat to Sansa&rsquo;s sexual purity and a laughingstock for NOT having sex with her and trying to protect her. The idea that he&rsquo;s trying to be chivalrous with Sansa is treated as ridiculous, made explicit when Jaime describes Tyrion protecting Sansa as a &ldquo;fit of gallantry&rdquo; with faint amusement at the idea that Tyrion would attempt to try and play a role wholly unexpected for someone like him.</p>",

Whereas I think people would see it as disreputable if Jaime were forced into a situation like that, Tyrion is both regarded as a threat to Sansa&rsquo;s sexual purity and a laughingstock for NOT having sex with her and trying to protect her. The idea that he&rsquo;s trying to be chivalrous with Sansa is treated as ridiculous, made explicit when Jaime describes Tyrion protecting Sansa as a &ldquo;fit of gallantry&rdquo; with faint amusement at the idea that Tyrion would attempt to try and play a role wholly unexpected for someone like him.</p>",

And since Sansa\u2019s body is considered a political commodity even before she is treated as a spectacle by being married to a dwarf, Tyrion has to fight to get even the privacy he does get for them. I think Tyrion probably didn\u2019t tell his father anything about what went on that night, and Tywin already has proven that he doesn\u2019t care what Tyrion has to say about it and mocks him based on what he hears about what happened, so the idea that Tyrion could have lied to Tywin to avoid constantly being badgered into an abusive sex act he said no to is just grasping at straws to find reasons to blame him for it.</p>",

Sansa being the future Crown Princess is sitted with the King and Queen. What\u2019s interesting about this chapter is that upto this point Sansa hadn\u2019t thought about Joffrey. She was too swept up with the tourney and all the events that occured within it. Sansa notes how courteous Joffrey was being towards her with a thought of how she hated him until she decided to hate Cersei and Arya instead.</p><blockquote><p>\n\nAt first she thought she hated him for what they&rsquo;d done to Lady, but after Sansa had wept her eyes dry, she told herself that it had not been Joffrey&rsquo;s doing, not truly. The queen had done it; she was the one to hate, her and Arya. Nothing bad would have happened except for Arya.\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>.</p><blockquote><p>\n\nAnd Joffrey was the soul of courtesy. He talked to Sansa all night, showering her with compliments, making her laugh, sharing little bits of court gossip, explaining Moon Boy&rsquo;s japes. Sansa was so captivated that she quite forgot all her courtesies and ignored Septa Mordane, seated to her left.\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>Sansa\u2019s ways of coping with the situation at the Trident was deflect some of the blame to people she\u2019s not immediately going to be related to just yet (Cersei) and someone she\u2019s had a contentious relationship with without much backlash (Arya). Both Cersei and Arya are less likely to harm Sansa in her estimation should she ignore or bicker with them. Joffrey on the other hand was meant to be Sansa\u2019s husband for the rest of her likely long life. Sansa\u2019s male relatives aren\u2019t going to live with her in King\u2019s Landing during the course of the marriage. Whatever form of protection Sansa had previously would be stripped away until only one remained, her husband\u2019s love for her. In other words Sansa has to get along with Joffrey and make him love her.</p><p>Sansa\u2019s reactions to Joffrey in all of her chapters is both real and forced. She is both genuinely enchanted and often turning him into a prince from her stories to compensate for his flaws. This is due to her training (\u201cLook at him, Sansa told herself, look at your husband, at all of him, Septa Mordane said all men are beautiful, find his beauty, try.\u201d), her reaction to complicated situations that she does not feel equipped to handle and her young age.</p><p>Sansa\u2019s method of coming around on Joffrey can\u2019t work on Cersei. She\u2019s a much older married woman. There\u2019s a degree of separation between the two that Sansa has no intention of crossing since Lady died. This is why this chapter is so important because it sets up everything Sansa does from this point forward until nearly the end of the book. While the feast was going on a commotion happens. Robert begins loudly arguing with Cersei which soon turns to shouting.</p><blockquote><p>Now everybody heard him. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he thundered in a voice that drowned out all other speech. Sansa was shocked to see the king on his feet, red of face, reeling. He had a goblet of wine in one hand, and he was drunk as a man could be. &ldquo;You do not tell me what to do, woman,&rdquo; he screamed at Queen Cersei. &ldquo;I am king<b>\u00a0</b>here, do you understand? I rule here, and if I say that I will fight tomorrow, I will fight!&quot;\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>We know that this is Cersei tricking Robert into possibly getting himself killed but Sansa doesn\u2019t know this. All she sees is the King shouting at his wife for daring to suggest that he shouldn\u2019t participate in the tourney. A reasonable request that is somewhat similar to the one Sansa made to Joffrey when he attacked Arya that had a similar reaction.</p><blockquote><p>\n\nHis eyes snapped open and looked at her, and there was nothing but loathing there, nothing but the vilest contempt. &quot;Then go,&rdquo; he spit at her. &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t touch me.&rdquo;\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>It\u2019s not surprising then that Sansa focused on Cersei\u2019s reaction rather than the reason for the argument.</p><blockquote><p>\n\nThe queen&rsquo;s face was a mask, so bloodless that it might have been sculpted from snow. She rose from the table, gathered her skirts around her, and stormed off in silence, servants trailing behind.\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>It\u2019s obvious that Cersei\u2019s hurt but she maintains her courtesy as much as possible. For a young high born girl who is also talented in that, it was no doubt admirable especially when only one person came to Cersei\u2019s defense.</p><blockquote><p>\n\nEveryone was staring. Sansa saw Ser Barristan, and the king&rsquo;s brother Renly, and the short man who had talked to her so oddly and touched her hair, but no one made a move to interfere.\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>No one helped Cersei. Not the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, not Cersei\u2019s good brother and not a member of the council. Only Jaime tried to intervene.</p><blockquote><p>\n\nJaime Lannister put a hand on the king&rsquo;s shoulder, but the king shoved him away hard. Lannister stumbled and fell. The king guffawed. &ldquo;The great knight. I can still knock you in the dirt. Remember that, Kingslayer.&rdquo; He slapped his chest with the jeweled goblet, splashing wine all over his satin tunic. &ldquo;Give me my hammer and not a man in the realm can stand before me!&rdquo;\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>Not only was Jaime thrown off, he was insulted and there was nothing he could do in retaliation because the King held all the power. One day when Sansa is in Cersei\u2019s position, no one will step in then either. Sansa without a doubt began relating to and empathising with Cersei. The Queen had stopped being the woman who insisted Lady be killed and she became a woman who dealt with humiliation admirably and alone like Sansa was after the \u2018trial\u2019.</p><p>In the next Sansa chapter, we had Sansa comparing Joffrey to fairytale characters and seeing Cersei as an ally against Ned\u2019s unfair decisions.</p><blockquote><p>\n\n&ldquo;I had a dream that Joffrey would be the one to take the white hart,&rdquo; she said. It had been more of a wish, actually, but it sounded better to call it a dream. Everyone knew that dreams were prophetic. White harts were supposed to be very rare and magical, and in her heart she knew her gallant prince was worthier than his drunken father.\n\n<br/></p></blockquote><p>.</p><blockquote><p>\n\nThe queen wore a high-collared black silk gown, with a hundred dark red rubies sewn into her bodice, covering her from neck to bosom.

Sansa notes how courteous Joffrey was being towards her with a thought of how she hated him until she decided to hate Cersei and Arya instead.</p><blockquote><p>\n\nAt first she thought she hated him for what they\u2019d done to Lady, but after Sansa had wept her eyes dry, she told herself that it had not been Joffrey\u2019s doing, not truly. The queen had done it; she was the one to hate, her and Arya. Nothing bad would have happened except for Arya.\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>.</p><blockquote><p>\n\nAnd Joffrey was the soul of courtesy. He talked to Sansa all night, showering her with compliments, making her laugh, sharing little bits of court gossip, explaining Moon Boy\u2019s japes. Sansa was so captivated that she quite forgot all her courtesies and ignored Septa Mordane, seated to her left.\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>Sansa\u2019s ways of coping with the situation at the Trident was deflect some of the blame to people she\u2019s not immediately going to be related to just yet (Cersei) and someone she\u2019s had a contentious relationship with without much backlash (Arya). Both Cersei and Arya are less likely to harm Sansa in her estimation should she ignore or bicker with them. Joffrey on the other hand was meant to be Sansa\u2019s husband for the rest of her likely long life. Sansa\u2019s male relatives aren\u2019t going to live with her in King\u2019s Landing during the course of the marriage. Whatever form of protection Sansa had previously would be stripped away until only one remained, her husband\u2019s love for her. In other words Sansa has to get along with Joffrey and make him love her.</p><p>Sansa\u2019s reactions to Joffrey in all of her chapters is both real and forced. She is both genuinely enchanted and often turning him into a prince from her stories to compensate for his flaws. This is due to her training (\u201cLook at him, Sansa told herself, look at your husband, at all of him, Septa Mordane said all men are beautiful, find his beauty, try.\u201d), her reaction to complicated situations that she does not feel equipped to handle and her young age.</p><p>Sansa\u2019s method of coming around on Joffrey can\u2019t work on Cersei. She\u2019s a much older married woman. There\u2019s a degree of separation between the two that Sansa has no intention of crossing since Lady died. This is why this chapter is so important because it sets up everything Sansa does from this point forward until nearly the end of the book. While the feast was going on a commotion happens. Robert begins loudly arguing with Cersei which soon turns to shouting.</p><blockquote><p>Now everybody heard him. \u201cNo,\u201d he thundered in a voice that drowned out all other speech. Sansa was shocked to see the king on his feet, red of face, reeling. He had a goblet of wine in one hand, and he was drunk as a man could be. \u201cYou do not tell me what to do, woman,\u201d he screamed at Queen Cersei. \u201cI am king<b>\u00a0</b>here, do you understand? I rule here, and if I say that I will fight tomorrow, I will fight!\"\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>We know that this is Cersei tricking Robert into possibly getting himself killed but Sansa doesn\u2019t know this. All she sees is the King shouting at his wife for daring to suggest that he shouldn\u2019t participate in the tourney. A reasonable request that is somewhat similar to the one Sansa made to Joffrey when he attacked Arya that had a similar reaction.</p><blockquote><p>\n\nHis eyes snapped open and looked at her, and there was nothing but loathing there, nothing but the vilest contempt. \"Then go,\u201d he spit at her. \u201cAnd don\u2019t touch me.\u201d\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>It\u2019s not surprising then that Sansa focused on Cersei\u2019s reaction rather than the reason for the argument.</p><blockquote><p>\n\nThe queen\u2019s face was a mask, so bloodless that it might have been sculpted from snow. She rose from the table, gathered her skirts around her, and stormed off in silence, servants trailing behind.\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>It\u2019s obvious that Cersei\u2019s hurt but she maintains her courtesy as much as possible. For a young high born girl who is also talented in that, it was no doubt admirable especially when only one person came to Cersei\u2019s defense.</p><blockquote><p>\n\nEveryone was staring. Sansa saw Ser Barristan, and the king\u2019s brother Renly, and the short man who had talked to her so oddly and touched her hair, but no one made a move to interfere.\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>No one helped Cersei. Not the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, not Cersei\u2019s good brother and not a member of the council. Only Jaime tried to intervene.</p><blockquote><p>\n\nJaime Lannister put a hand on the king\u2019s shoulder, but the king shoved him away hard. Lannister stumbled and fell. The king guffawed. \u201cThe great knight. I can still knock you in the dirt. Remember that, Kingslayer.\u201d He slapped his chest with the jeweled goblet, splashing wine all over his satin tunic. \u201cGive me my hammer and not a man in the realm can stand before me!\u201d\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>Not only was Jaime thrown off, he was insulted and there was nothing he could do in retaliation because the King held all the power. One day when Sansa is in Cersei\u2019s position, no one will step in then either. Sansa without a doubt began relating to and empathising with Cersei. The Queen had stopped being the woman who insisted Lady be killed and she became a woman who dealt with humiliation admirably and alone like Sansa was after the \u2018trial\u2019.</p><p>In the next Sansa chapter, we had Sansa comparing Joffrey to fairytale characters and seeing Cersei as an ally against Ned\u2019s unfair decisions.</p><blockquote><p>\n\n\u201cI had a dream that Joffrey would be the one to take the white hart,\u201d she said. It had been more of a wish, actually, but it sounded better to call it a dream. Everyone knew that dreams were prophetic. White harts were supposed to be very rare and magical, and in her heart she knew her gallant prince was worthier than his drunken father.\n\n<br></p></blockquote><p>.</p><blockquote><p>\n\nThe queen wore a high-collared black silk gown, with a hundred dark red rubies sewn into her bodice, covering her from neck to bosom. They were cut in the shape of teardrops, as if the queen were weeping blood.
