I cried all of last night am now, I\u2019m just laying here. </p><p>\u201cIs this because you and Amber broke up?\u201d A tear rolled down my cheek. </p><p>Amber was the cause for this, Amber is the reason I have this big hole in my heart. The reason multiple people are hurt. And the reason my school hates me.</p><p>\u201cJonah?\u201d </p><p>I storm over to and sling it open. I don\u2019t care if Kip is just a kid, she should learn not to annoy people. She should know that if someone says to leave them alone, they should do it! </p><p>\u201cKIP, I SAID LEAVE! WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE! I WANT TO BE ALONE AND ALL YOU DO IS BUG ME! HONESTLY WHY ARE YOU SO ANNOYING!?!\u201d</p><p>Her eyes fill with tears and her lip pokes out. I instantly knew I messed up. I\u2019m not mad at her. But I have this rage in my stomach and nowhere to put it. </p><p>I hug her and her arms wrap around my waist. As she sobs she apologizes. I feel like the biggest jerk in the universe. She is the best sister a guy could have and I hurt her. </p><p>I crouch down so I can meet her eyes. The sweet caramel color matched my mothers. I sadly am cursed with my father\u2019s eyes. </p><p>\u201cI am so sorry. I love you so much. Your brother is just dealing with some mean kids right now. When I get sad though, I yell and scream, ok? It\u2019s not that you did anything, it\u2019s me. I am working on it.\u201d</p><p>She wiped her eyes and thought about what I said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry the people are being mean to you. I think your the best person in the world. I love you brother, and I want to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just did. Also, was there something you needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah! I almost forgot, your friend is here! He REALLY wants to see you.\u201d I gulped. </p><p>He? That could be one of two people and I don\u2019t want to see either of them.</p><p>Cyrus, probably wants to talk. I upset him yesterday and the last thing I need is to recap yesterday.</p><p>And Walker, he is probably here to yell at me. We ended things as well as we could but, he could easily blame me for what\u2019s happening. Even if I didn\u2019t place the picture there, I was the one who got caught kissing him.</p><p>As I approached the door I was startled, TJ Kippen was standing at the door. He was someone I never expect to see. He is always in his room when I was at Ambers. So. for him to be here is kinda\u2026</p><p>Nerve racking?</p><p>\u201cHey man!\u201d He smiles as I enter the doorway. I give him an awkward bro hug and it just got more confusing.</p><p>\u201cHey, what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>His smile drops, \u201cActually I\u2019m here to talk. Is there somewhere we can go?\u201d </p><p>\u201cUm, yeah my rooms in the very back to the left.\u201d</p><p>As we walked down the hall my mind spiraled just trying to process what was happening, why was he here? </p><p>To yell?</p><p>To blame me?</p><p>To hurt me? </p><p>Definitely not to listen. I did JUST break up with his sister.</p><p>He walks into my room. He sees the baseball I have laying on the floor, he picks it up. He sits on my bed and starts tossing it back and forth in his hands. </p><p>Left</p><p>Right</p><p>Left</p><p>Right</p><p>The pace the ball was going was relaxing to me I was able to steady my breathing to the speed of the ball.</p><p>In </p><p>Out </p><p>In </p><p>Out</p><p>The stress inside my head minimized. I looked away from the ball and pulled a rolly-chair up to my bed. I looked up and met his eyes. The air grew awkward as we sat in silence, I noticed he wasn\u2019t looking at me. Rather, he was staring at the ball. Almost like his life depended on it. I coughed to make some attempt of getting his attention. His eyes slowly drifted to mine and he opened his mouth to say something but shut it before anything came out. Almost like he was ashamed.</p><p>\u201cTJ, I don\u2019t mind you being here but if your here to scream at me can we go ahead and get it over with. I get you think I\u2019m this monster, but I did nothing to Amber. She was aware of my situation and she fully accepted it. That picture was taken before I even started dating Amber. So, if your going to do something do it.\u201d I say this while being shocked by my confidence. I never have stood up to anyone but this is the time I did. </p><p>I stood up and spread my arms out. I was hoping this would make the whole beating up process easier. As I stand there I hear him laugh.</p><p>Laugh?</p><p>Why is he laughing?</p><p>He should be punching, or kicking, or something??</p><p>He looks at me and he says \u201cBro, you more chill then I thought. Obviously we\u2019re cool. Amber knew the relationship was over way before this, she actually wanted to come and apologize for her, since she knew you probably didn\u2019t want to see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\u201d I mutter. As I hear my subconscious scream at me how stupid I am. Of course that\u2019s why he\u2019s here. He wouldn\u2019t just stumble here on his own. </p><p>\u201cI actually was going to come talk to you even if she didn\u2019t force me down here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? No offense to you though, I mean we just haven\u2019t talked before and with recent events you probably I didn\u2019t think you would want to see me anyway. I know I should have probably stopped by your room and said hi before. It\u2019s just that the school kinda makes you out to be this monster. NOT THAT YOU ARE A MONSTER. I was just saying the school thinks that, when it\u2019s totally not true. Also I\u2019ve rambling haven\u2019t I? Wow most people can\u2019t get three words out of me but I am going on and on and on. I\u2019m stopping\u2026 Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take back my chill statement from before.\u201d He smiles. \u201cAlso I get that this is weird, me being here and all. I just wanted to make sure you were ok.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine\u201d I say in a completely monotone manor.</p><p>\u201cLook you don\u2019t have to lie, I get what your going through.\u201d</p><p>He rest my hand on my shoulder. I remove it immediately not wanting to seem rude, I just don\u2019t like being touched. It makes me feel awkward, and I know he doesn\u2019t mean anything by it. I just can\u2019t focus on anything other than his hand on me, if his hands on me.</p><p>I realize I\u2019m focused on the wrong thing and redirect my attention to the conversation in front of me.</p><p>Him? </p><p>He has the perfect life. He wouldn\u2019t know what I\u2019m going through AT ALL! In fact, that couldn\u2019t be farther from the truth! What he said definitely rubbed me the wrong way, and I\u2019m going to let him know it!</p><p>\u201cYou, what on EARTH would you know about what I\u2019m going through.\u201d I feel a tear form in my eye. \u201cI HAVE NO ONE! NO ONE UNDERSTANDS! ESPECIALLY NOT YOU! MR.BASKETBALL MAN! THAT&rsquo;S ALL YOU ARE, TJ KIPPEN, THE GUY WHO CAN HAVE ANYONE, ANYTIME HE WANTS!\u201d</p><p>He looks me in the eyes, \u201c I was going to be civil Jonah, but screw it.\u201d He says in the deepest, most intimidating voice I\u2019ve ever heard.</p><p>\u201cPOOR LITTLE JONAH! HE\u2019S SO ALONE! HE ONLY HAS HIS FAMILY AND FRIENDS BY HIS SIDE! POOR LITTLE JONAH! GOT HIS FEELINGS HURT! LET\u2019S ALL FORGET THE FACT THAT I WAS OUTED TO THE WHOLE BASKETBALL TEAM! THAT I LOST THE MAJORITY OF MY FRIENDS! THAT I LOST THE PERSON I LOVED BECAUSE HE WASN\u2019T READY! LET\u2019S ALL FOCUS ON JONAH FLIPPING BECK! NO ONE NEEDS A TJ KIPPEN IN THERE LIFE!\u201d He explodes.</p><p>I just stare at him for a second, TJ is gay.</p><p>TJ lost people.</p><p>TJ is hurt.</p><p>TJ came here to feel less alone.</p><p>And I once again stepped all over this great person.</p><p>What is WRONG with me!</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry man, I had no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good, I paid off the team not to tell anyone. I can\u2019t even imagine having this happen to me. Kids are tough.\u201d He chuckles</p><p>\u201cYou can say that again.\u201d</p><p>He smirks, we sit there for a minute, letting the previous conversation soak in. A lot did happen very fast. </p><p>After a minute he gets this look on his face, kinda like he has an idea. He stands up and he says, \u201cWe\u2019re gonna do it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWoah man, we\u2019re cool and all but\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cNO! God no! You are DEFINITELY NOT my type.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThen, what did you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI MEANT we\u2019re going to go talk to them\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d I say slightly confused. Who did he mean by them? He must of picked up on the not so subtle clues that I had no idea what he meant because he explained further.</p><p>\u201cYOUR going to talk to picture boy, and I\u2019M going to talk to my once in a million.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOH! I get\u2014, picture boy? You don\u2019t know who it is?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo man, the picture was taken at a weird angle. You can only make out who you are, don\u2019t you check your phone? Who is picture boy is trending.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? no, No, NO! This can\u2019t- can\u2019t be happening.\u201d </p><p>I lose my perception what reality as my head spins. I can\u2019t breathe and feel myself slide to the floor. I feel like I\u2019m dying as the world gets smaller around me. I can only think of how mad Walkers going to be when he looks at his phone. I feel myself claw into the rug I next to my bed. \u201cHelp!\u201d I make out hoping that someone will hear. I start to slowly hear my Mom\u2019s voice, she tells me that I\u2019m having a panic attack and that it will end. It doesn\u2019t feel like it, but I do slowly feel the air go into my lungs again. I try to focus on that until I get back to where I can recognize what\u2019s happening. TJ is standing at the doorway and my mom has me enveloped in a hug. I am back to being ok.</p><p>My mom knows this and stands up. This has so many times now she doesn\u2019t even ask questions, she just leaves.</p><p>TJ runs over to me. \u201cAre you ok?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and I\u2019m ready. Let\u2019s go talk to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet?\u201d He says.\u201dBut first can you explain what just happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter it\u2019s all over now.\u201d I want him to believe me because I have anxiety and that was a panic attack. Isn\u2019t a conversation I want to have with a total stranger. </p><p>\u201cRight\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlus right now I need to go see Wa\u2014. Er, I mean Picture Boy and you need to see\u2026\u201d I feel myself tense up. I almost said Walker, that would not be good. He could be lying about everything.</p><p>\u201cActually, about that. Let\u2019s not go, my ex and I didn\u2019t end on great terms. I mean we were perfect when we were together, but we both did dumb things. We went from being with each other everyday, to fighting once a week, to a slight \u2018hey, how are you?\u2019 in the hallway, to nothing at all.\u201d He admitted</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no guy is there? I mean, you obviously can\u2019t make up a name so I\u2019ll do it for you. Steve Earle! There\u2019s a name. Joseph Maccoby. There\u2019s another! Look, I GOT A LOT TO DEAL WITH AND IF YOUR JUST HERE TO GET INFORMATION ABOUT ME THEN LEAVE! TELL AMBER YOU APOLOGIZED AND JUST L\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cMarty.\u201d He muttered</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMARTY, that\u2019s my ex! You know Marty, your friend Marty, Marty from the party, Marty the \u2018basketball man\u2019, Marty who has been with me through EVERYTHING!\u201d </p><p>\u201cMarty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup\u201d He said, popping the p.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026 again. I just know with the \u2018Picture Boy\u2019 craze that\u2019s going on, it\u2019s just hard to trust someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get that\u201d he laughed. \u201cYou want to go do something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually I do need to go talk to, you know..\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah ok, I\u2019ll go then.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBye TJ\u201d</p><p>He exits my room. I\u2019m left to progress what just happened. TJ just talked to me. TJ is gay and dated Marty. Is Marty gay? He seems so close to Buffy. Is there a way to like both? Ugh it\u2019s too confusing. </p><p>Back to that Picture Boy thing, was that real? I grabbed my phone and power it on. I cut it off last night because of all of the spamming. I go to Twitter and see that, sure enough, you don\u2019t see Walker very well in the picture. People are trying to guess who it is. I laugh at some that are obviously jokes, I mean I couldn\u2019t see some of them with me in a million years. There were none that even pointed toward Walker as a suspect. Still, I probably do need to talk to him.</p><p>I went to my contacts and scrolled and finally landed on his name. </p><p>Me: Hello Mr. Picture Boy</p><p>Deleted</p><p>Me: Been awhile\u2026</p><p>Deleted</p><p>Me: So how are you?</p><p>Deleted </p><p>Me: I\u2019m coming over.</p><p>Sent</p><p>I decided I would have to do this in person, I don\u2019t like talking on the phone, and you can overthink while texting. I need to see him, talk to him, and hear him.</p><p>I go over to my closet and try to decide which outfit goes with \u201cSorry I almost outed you and I hope we can still be friends.\u201d  God this is a disaster. Just like me I guess. A disaster. I\u2019m just like a hurricane, I leave a mess everywhere I go and I leave people hurt with no turning back. </p><p>I finally decide on my gray shirt Amber bought me for my birthday. I\u2019m not gonna lie it is super comfortable. She did always know what I want, but what she\u2019s done is unforgivable. After I get back from Walkers I fully plan to bury myself under a pound of blankets and cry until the sweet release of death.</p><p>I go down street and started counting, when we were together I figured out it took exactly 230 steps to get to his house. So, it became a habit to count on the way there.</p><p>As I reached the 200s my heart began to pound. I was not prepared for what I was throwing myself into.</p><p>210. Almost there.</p><p>220. I\u2019m right next to his house.</p><p>230. I\u2019m there.</p><p>I knocked on his door. \u201cHere we go.\u201d I whispered under my breath. </p><p>The door opens to reveal his beautiful mother, wearing another outfit Walker designed. His parents are so supportive of his dreams of being a designer, when my dad was around the only option for me was the army. Secretly though, I would try to learn guitar. I borrowed one from Gus\u2019s dad from time to time. I feel like if I had a good teacher, I might be able to go somewhere. Not that my mom could afford it. So I guess for now no dreams is what I can manage. </p><p>\u201cJonah! Sweetheart, it\u2019s been too long, how are you?\u201d She says as she hugs me. </p><p>\u201cHey Violet, I\u2019m great.\u201d I say a little too enthusiastically. \u201cI love the dress is it new?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, Walk just made it last week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell it suits you. Speaking of Walk, is he home?\u201d</p><p>She sighs,\u201dYeah but he\u2019s in a mood, won\u2019t let anyone in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I give it a go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, but say hi to Marcus on the way. We both have really missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you guys too. Life just gets in the way sometimes.\u201d I laugh nervously, obviously they don\u2019t know what happened between us. I\u2019m not going to be the one to tell them that their son and I are in some deep trouble right now.</p><p>\u201cWell, I get that.\u201d She laughs.</p><p>I decide that\u2019s my time to leave. I run across the house, straight to Walker\u2019s door. I took a deep breath to prepare for the storm of hate and rage that was about to hit me. </p><p>*Knock Knock Knock*</p><p>\u201cGO AWAY DAD! I DON\u2019T WANT TO TALK ABOUT GIRLS ANYMORE!\u201d</p><p>Dang he is mad.</p><p>\u201cHot Fudge Sundae\u201d I whispered. We came up with the code right after our first date. It lets us know that it\u2019s each other. My code is hot fudge sundae, and his is painted smiles.</p><p>\u201cJonah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah it\u2019s me. Can I come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes just don\u2019t let anyone follow you.\u201d</p><p>I slowly opened the door, I saw him wrapped in a blanket. He had puffy eyes that matched mine. He obviously didn\u2019t need to be informed on what had happened.</p><p>\u201cAre you ok?\u201d I asked. I already knew the answer but I didn\u2019t know how else to start this conversation.</p><p>\u201cI should be asking you that.\u201d He said. </p><p>He honestly has never sounded worse. I climbed up beside him in the bed and he laid his head on my shoulder. Just like in the good old days. </p><p>\u201cAre you mad at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured you would be, having been a victim of my locker and all\u201d</p><p>He half smiled \u201cI wouldn\u2019t think you put it there yourself, heck, you didn\u2019t know what to identify as a month ago. Did you ever figure that out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, all I know is I\u2019m a little more confused everyday. And you, did you ever pick a label?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now, I like pansexual. I feel like it describes me pretty well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great\u2026 What exactly is that?\u201d</p><p>He laughed a little \u201cI pretty much fall for someone\u2019s personality rather than their gender. I do have a slight preference to males, but I\u2019m open to any gender.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t know that existed. Your right though, it does suit you.\u201d </p><p>He smiles at me, and I smiled back. I\u2019m happy for Walk, it must be comforting to know what you are.</p><p>\u201cHey? We\u2019re going to be ok, right? Like, this will end eventually?\u201d I asked</p><p>\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know Jo, I wish I could tell you yes, but kids are so\u2026 What\u2019s the word?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCruel, hateful, clueless, closed-minded?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d He says looking away.</p><p>We sat there in this silence for awhile. We used to do this for hours, just be with each other. I missed it so much. I don\u2019t like him anymore but I do need him, as my best friend right now. He gets it, what I\u2019m going through, how hard it\u2019s been, how lonely it is. </p><p>All of it.</p><p>It\u2019s easy to rely on the ones you trust. Which why it\u2019s different then someone like TJ or Cyrus. Sure, they seem nice but I don\u2019t trust them yet. As I grew deeper into my thinking, I felt Walker grab my hand. </p><p>I pulled away.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\u201d I mumble verily loud enough to hear.</p><p>He turn to look at me. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this again, Walk, I know times are tough right now. I mean that, but if we go back to how we were we\u2019ll get hurt again. I loved you, and I still do. I just know that we both aren\u2019t mentally stable enough to be together. Not yet.\u201d</p><p>He sat up and moved to the foot of his bed to face me. \u201cI know, I\u2019ve just missed you so much. I won\u2019t do it again, I promise, just don\u2019t\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t leave again. I can handle being friends, and just to let you know I\u2019ve started therapy. I got antidepressants, they work, for the most part. Some days are still tough though. Like today, the locker thing hit me hard, not gonna lie. Then, my dad came up here, and when refused to open the door, he was convinced it because of some girl. It just reminded me that I\u2019m still not as open, or out, as I want to be. It hurts so much Jonah. I used to talk to you about this stuff, then you quit coming around. I get that though. I\u2019ve just been so alone.\u201d He cried. </p><p>I pulled him into a hug and after a couple minutes I pulled away.</p><p>\u201cI know I left. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t want you close. I push those people away, especially when they need me. I get scared then, I hurt them. We both fell victim though, it hurt so much to leave you. I forced myself not to return, I knew we pulling each other down, instead of lifting each other up. I wasn\u2019t going to let that happen. We agreed on that. I am here when you need me though. I might not be much help but I will listen.\u201d I said trying to defend myself.</p><p>He sat there a second, looking at the stars on his ceiling. Then after about two minutes of saying nothing, he got up and went to his closet, he came back with face paint and brushes.</p><p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind but it\u2019s getting kind of serious and I think we both could use a little light heartedness.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love that.\u201d I grinned.</p><p>We both started grabbing colors and brushes. Then I went first. He wanted something goofy, something to make him laugh. So I did the best thing possible, which was turn his head into a giant cheeseburger. As I started on the bun I began to attempt to catch up on what\u2019s been going on.</p><p>\u201cI liked your Mom\u2019s new dress. It had a lot more detail in it then the ones she wore when I was last around.\u201d </p><p>He looked amused. \u201cYeah, took a couple classes and picked up some new techniques.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell they look great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might need to change them then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo offense, but you have no taste sweetie.\u201d He joked</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill not.\u201d </p><p>Within no time were busting out laughing at old memories and inside jokes. It honestly felt so good to be back. It made me happier than I had been in awhile.</p><p>\u201cYou remember the time we tried to do a piggyback race with your sister and Kaylee?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, we ended up just falling over because SOMEONE said I was too heavy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWELL I NEVER SAID I WAS AN ATHLETE!\u201d</p><p>I missed joking around with him he was my best friend, I\u2019m so glad I got him back. I mean he was my BEST friend, even before we dated. He would come over to my house all the time, my mom called him her adopted son. </p><p>\u201cSo how\u2019s Laura aka my mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy moms as good as she can be.\u201d I laughed</p><p>\u201cSo? Still utterly clueless?\u201d </p><p>\u201cAt this point I could write depressed on my head, kiss a guy, and have a panic attack right in front of her, and she still wouldn\u2019t know what was going on.\u201d </p><p>\u201cPlease, at least she isn\u2019t always in your business. I\u2019m surprised I\u2019m still closeted after all the \u2018girl talks\u2019 my dad has had with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYikes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s gonna be so disappointed when he finds out. I\u2019m not even that worried about my mom. She\u2019s so loving that it literally wouldn\u2019t change anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least your mom and dad are still here.\u201d I wasn\u2019t thinking when I said that. The room fell to a hush. We sat there in silence as I finished the last few designs.</p><p>\u201c&hellip;and done\u201d I say after finishing my master piece. </p><p>He went over to the mirror and instantly fell over from laughing.</p><p>\u201cNice one Ronald McDonald.\u201d He mocks.</p><p>\u201cLike you\u2019ll do any better.\u201d I say, knowing very well his will be a trillion times better.</p><p>He begins his with a dark brown and continues our conversation. </p><p>\u201cSo when do you think you\u2019ll go back to school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably around\u2026 um\u2026 never. Never sounds good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, it can\u2019t be that bad\u201d he says.</p><p>I take out my phone and read him a few of the hundreds of mean comments, texts, voicemails, emails, and tweets, I had been sent. </p><p>\u201cDang that\u2019s tough. How are you staying so strong?\u201d He asked</p><p>\u201cWell for the most part my phone is turned off, but occasionally I go on to see who they think you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh I do the same thing! I mean I knew about the hate, but I swear I think they have named everyone except me by now. I don\u2019t know if I should offended or relieved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelieved, definitely relieved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know, and just to let you know, I don\u2019t regret anything that happened. Sure, I do wish I wasn\u2019t trending with the anonymous \u2018Picture Boy\u2019 name, but I wouldn\u2019t take back that kiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe either.\u201d I say looking directly in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cFriends?\u201d He asked like I was going to reject the offer.</p><p>\u201cFriends.\u201d I beamed.</p><p>He did a few more touch ups. I could tell because he was super focused and his tongue was sticking out.</p><p>\u201cYour done\u201d he exclaimed. I walk over to the mirror and started laughing at the monkey that was now on my face. It was definitely not what I expected. He usually does more detailed designs but this was simple. I really liked it. </p><p>As I was sitting back down I glanced up at the clock and noticed how late it had gotten. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take off, it was good seeing you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame here.\u201d</p><p>I rushed out his house, first stopping to say goodbye to Marcus and Violet. With the monkey still on my face, I sprinted home, just making it by my curfew. As I walked in my mom started laughing. </p><p>\u201cYou go to Walkers today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup\u201d I said as I slowly walked to my room.</p><p>\u201cGood I like that kid.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI WANT A MONKEY!\u201d Kip chimed in.</p><p>Gosh I love that child. I hope she never goes through what I am. I go over and ruffle her hair. She gives a look of shock. </p><p>Kip then jumps, landing on me. I tried to hold her up but we both end up in the floor. I begin laughing, hard. She jumps up and runs away screaming, giggles slipping through when she catches her breath. She\u2019s adorable.</p><p>I roll over and look up my mom, she had my phone in her hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, i-it was buzzing and I just-\u201c she stutters. </p><p>I half smile, of course this happens. Right when I start to feel better, this stuff happens. It\u2019s almost amusing how my life can\u2019t just be right, not even for a little bit.</p><p>I laugh, not a regular laugh. No, it\u2019s deep, bitter, and cold. I\u2019m done with this, not just this, everything.</p><p>\u201cNope\u201d I say as I storm to my room. So much for a good day.</p><p>\u2014\u2014</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1121\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/233e45a9b5102f5d973a8ff21bb404be/tumblr_poqzboTj9s1w97rg7_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1121\"/></figure><p>Jonah\u2019s painting </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1104\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/582387dd7220f2fe6254902ab15bfd66/tumblr_poqzboK0G71w97rg7_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1104\"/></figure><p>Walker\u2019s painting </p>",

I cried all of last night am now, I\u2019m just laying here. </p><p>\u201cIs this because you and Amber broke up?\u201d A tear rolled down my cheek. </p><p>Amber was the cause for this, Amber is the reason I have this big hole in my heart. The reason multiple people are hurt. And the reason my school hates me.</p><p>\u201cJonah?\u201d </p><p>I storm over to and sling it open. I don\u2019t care if Kip is just a kid, she should learn not to annoy people. She should know that if someone says to leave them alone, they should do it! </p><p>\u201cKIP, I SAID LEAVE! WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE! I WANT TO BE ALONE AND ALL YOU DO IS BUG ME! HONESTLY WHY ARE YOU SO ANNOYING!?!\u201d</p><p>Her eyes fill with tears and her lip pokes out. I instantly knew I messed up. I\u2019m not mad at her. But I have this rage in my stomach and nowhere to put it. </p><p>I hug her and her arms wrap around my waist. As she sobs she apologizes. I feel like the biggest jerk in the universe. She is the best sister a guy could have and I hurt her. </p><p>I crouch down so I can meet her eyes. The sweet caramel color matched my mothers. I sadly am cursed with my father\u2019s eyes. </p><p>\u201cI am so sorry. I love you so much. Your brother is just dealing with some mean kids right now. When I get sad though, I yell and scream, ok? It\u2019s not that you did anything, it\u2019s me. I am working on it.\u201d</p><p>She wiped her eyes and thought about what I said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry the people are being mean to you. I think your the best person in the world. I love you brother, and I want to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just did. Also, was there something you needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah! I almost forgot, your friend is here! He REALLY wants to see you.\u201d I gulped. </p><p>He? That could be one of two people and I don\u2019t want to see either of them.</p><p>Cyrus, probably wants to talk. I upset him yesterday and the last thing I need is to recap yesterday.</p><p>And Walker, he is probably here to yell at me. We ended things as well as we could but, he could easily blame me for what\u2019s happening. Even if I didn\u2019t place the picture there, I was the one who got caught kissing him.</p><p>As I approached the door I was startled, TJ Kippen was standing at the door. He was someone I never expect to see. He is always in his room when I was at Ambers. So. for him to be here is kinda\u2026</p><p>Nerve racking?</p><p>\u201cHey man!\u201d He smiles as I enter the doorway. I give him an awkward bro hug and it just got more confusing.</p><p>\u201cHey, what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>His smile drops, \u201cActually I\u2019m here to talk. Is there somewhere we can go?\u201d </p><p>\u201cUm, yeah my rooms in the very back to the left.\u201d</p><p>As we walked down the hall my mind spiraled just trying to process what was happening, why was he here? </p><p>To yell?</p><p>To blame me?</p><p>To hurt me? </p><p>Definitely not to listen. I did JUST break up with his sister.</p><p>He walks into my room. He sees the baseball I have laying on the floor, he picks it up. He sits on my bed and starts tossing it back and forth in his hands. </p><p>Left</p><p>Right</p><p>Left</p><p>Right</p><p>The pace the ball was going was relaxing to me I was able to steady my breathing to the speed of the ball.</p><p>In </p><p>Out </p><p>In </p><p>Out</p><p>The stress inside my head minimized. I looked away from the ball and pulled a rolly-chair up to my bed. I looked up and met his eyes. The air grew awkward as we sat in silence, I noticed he wasn\u2019t looking at me. Rather, he was staring at the ball. Almost like his life depended on it. I coughed to make some attempt of getting his attention. His eyes slowly drifted to mine and he opened his mouth to say something but shut it before anything came out. Almost like he was ashamed.</p><p>\u201cTJ, I don\u2019t mind you being here but if your here to scream at me can we go ahead and get it over with. I get you think I\u2019m this monster, but I did nothing to Amber. She was aware of my situation and she fully accepted it. That picture was taken before I even started dating Amber. So, if your going to do something do it.\u201d I say this while being shocked by my confidence. I never have stood up to anyone but this is the time I did. </p><p>I stood up and spread my arms out. I was hoping this would make the whole beating up process easier. As I stand there I hear him laugh.</p><p>Laugh?</p><p>Why is he laughing?</p><p>He should be punching, or kicking, or something??</p><p>He looks at me and he says \u201cBro, you more chill then I thought. Obviously we\u2019re cool. Amber knew the relationship was over way before this, she actually wanted to come and apologize for her, since she knew you probably didn\u2019t want to see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\u201d I mutter. As I hear my subconscious scream at me how stupid I am. Of course that\u2019s why he\u2019s here. He wouldn\u2019t just stumble here on his own. </p><p>\u201cI actually was going to come talk to you even if she didn\u2019t force me down here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? No offense to you though, I mean we just haven\u2019t talked before and with recent events you probably I didn\u2019t think you would want to see me anyway. I know I should have probably stopped by your room and said hi before. It\u2019s just that the school kinda makes you out to be this monster. NOT THAT YOU ARE A MONSTER. I was just saying the school thinks that, when it\u2019s totally not true. Also I\u2019ve rambling haven\u2019t I? Wow most people can\u2019t get three words out of me but I am going on and on and on. I\u2019m stopping\u2026 Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take back my chill statement from before.\u201d He smiles. \u201cAlso I get that this is weird, me being here and all. I just wanted to make sure you were ok.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine\u201d I say in a completely monotone manor.</p><p>\u201cLook you don\u2019t have to lie, I get what your going through.\u201d</p><p>He rest my hand on my shoulder. I remove it immediately not wanting to seem rude, I just don\u2019t like being touched. It makes me feel awkward, and I know he doesn\u2019t mean anything by it. I just can\u2019t focus on anything other than his hand on me, if his hands on me.</p><p>I realize I\u2019m focused on the wrong thing and redirect my attention to the conversation in front of me.</p><p>Him? </p><p>He has the perfect life. He wouldn\u2019t know what I\u2019m going through AT ALL! In fact, that couldn\u2019t be farther from the truth! What he said definitely rubbed me the wrong way, and I\u2019m going to let him know it!</p><p>\u201cYou, what on EARTH would you know about what I\u2019m going through.\u201d I feel a tear form in my eye. \u201cI HAVE NO ONE! NO ONE UNDERSTANDS! ESPECIALLY NOT YOU! MR.BASKETBALL MAN! THAT\u2019S ALL YOU ARE, TJ KIPPEN, THE GUY WHO CAN HAVE ANYONE, ANYTIME HE WANTS!\u201d</p><p>He looks me in the eyes, \u201c I was going to be civil Jonah, but screw it.\u201d He says in the deepest, most intimidating voice I\u2019ve ever heard.</p><p>\u201cPOOR LITTLE JONAH! HE\u2019S SO ALONE! HE ONLY HAS HIS FAMILY AND FRIENDS BY HIS SIDE! POOR LITTLE JONAH! GOT HIS FEELINGS HURT! LET\u2019S ALL FORGET THE FACT THAT I WAS OUTED TO THE WHOLE BASKETBALL TEAM! THAT I LOST THE MAJORITY OF MY FRIENDS! THAT I LOST THE PERSON I LOVED BECAUSE HE WASN\u2019T READY! LET\u2019S ALL FOCUS ON JONAH FLIPPING BECK! NO ONE NEEDS A TJ KIPPEN IN THERE LIFE!\u201d He explodes.</p><p>I just stare at him for a second, TJ is gay.</p><p>TJ lost people.</p><p>TJ is hurt.</p><p>TJ came here to feel less alone.</p><p>And I once again stepped all over this great person.</p><p>What is WRONG with me!</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry man, I had no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good, I paid off the team not to tell anyone. I can\u2019t even imagine having this happen to me. Kids are tough.\u201d He chuckles</p><p>\u201cYou can say that again.\u201d</p><p>He smirks, we sit there for a minute, letting the previous conversation soak in. A lot did happen very fast. </p><p>After a minute he gets this look on his face, kinda like he has an idea. He stands up and he says, \u201cWe\u2019re gonna do it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWoah man, we\u2019re cool and all but\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cNO! God no! You are DEFINITELY NOT my type.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThen, what did you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI MEANT we\u2019re going to go talk to them\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d I say slightly confused. Who did he mean by them? He must of picked up on the not so subtle clues that I had no idea what he meant because he explained further.</p><p>\u201cYOUR going to talk to picture boy, and I\u2019M going to talk to my once in a million.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOH! I get\u2014, picture boy? You don\u2019t know who it is?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo man, the picture was taken at a weird angle. You can only make out who you are, don\u2019t you check your phone? Who is picture boy is trending.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? no, No, NO! This can\u2019t- can\u2019t be happening.\u201d </p><p>I lose my perception what reality as my head spins. I can\u2019t breathe and feel myself slide to the floor. I feel like I\u2019m dying as the world gets smaller around me. I can only think of how mad Walkers going to be when he looks at his phone. I feel myself claw into the rug I next to my bed. \u201cHelp!\u201d I make out hoping that someone will hear. I start to slowly hear my Mom\u2019s voice, she tells me that I\u2019m having a panic attack and that it will end. It doesn\u2019t feel like it, but I do slowly feel the air go into my lungs again. I try to focus on that until I get back to where I can recognize what\u2019s happening. TJ is standing at the doorway and my mom has me enveloped in a hug. I am back to being ok.</p><p>My mom knows this and stands up. This has so many times now she doesn\u2019t even ask questions, she just leaves.</p><p>TJ runs over to me. \u201cAre you ok?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and I\u2019m ready. Let\u2019s go talk to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet?\u201d He says.\u201dBut first can you explain what just happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter it\u2019s all over now.\u201d I want him to believe me because I have anxiety and that was a panic attack. Isn\u2019t a conversation I want to have with a total stranger. </p><p>\u201cRight\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlus right now I need to go see Wa\u2014. Er, I mean Picture Boy and you need to see\u2026\u201d I feel myself tense up. I almost said Walker, that would not be good. He could be lying about everything.</p><p>\u201cActually, about that. Let\u2019s not go, my ex and I didn\u2019t end on great terms. I mean we were perfect when we were together, but we both did dumb things. We went from being with each other everyday, to fighting once a week, to a slight \u2018hey, how are you?\u2019 in the hallway, to nothing at all.\u201d He admitted</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no guy is there? I mean, you obviously can\u2019t make up a name so I\u2019ll do it for you. Steve Earle! There\u2019s a name. Joseph Maccoby. There\u2019s another! Look, I GOT A LOT TO DEAL WITH AND IF YOUR JUST HERE TO GET INFORMATION ABOUT ME THEN LEAVE! TELL AMBER YOU APOLOGIZED AND JUST L\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cMarty.\u201d He muttered</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMARTY, that\u2019s my ex! You know Marty, your friend Marty, Marty from the party, Marty the \u2018basketball man\u2019, Marty who has been with me through EVERYTHING!\u201d </p><p>\u201cMarty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup\u201d He said, popping the p.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026 again. I just know with the \u2018Picture Boy\u2019 craze that\u2019s going on, it\u2019s just hard to trust someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get that\u201d he laughed. \u201cYou want to go do something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually I do need to go talk to, you know..\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah ok, I\u2019ll go then.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBye TJ\u201d</p><p>He exits my room. I\u2019m left to progress what just happened. TJ just talked to me. TJ is gay and dated Marty. Is Marty gay? He seems so close to Buffy. Is there a way to like both? Ugh it\u2019s too confusing. </p><p>Back to that Picture Boy thing, was that real? I grabbed my phone and power it on. I cut it off last night because of all of the spamming. I go to Twitter and see that, sure enough, you don\u2019t see Walker very well in the picture. People are trying to guess who it is. I laugh at some that are obviously jokes, I mean I couldn\u2019t see some of them with me in a million years. There were none that even pointed toward Walker as a suspect. Still, I probably do need to talk to him.</p><p>I went to my contacts and scrolled and finally landed on his name. </p><p>Me: Hello Mr. Picture Boy</p><p>Deleted</p><p>Me: Been awhile\u2026</p><p>Deleted</p><p>Me: So how are you?</p><p>Deleted </p><p>Me: I\u2019m coming over.</p><p>Sent</p><p>I decided I would have to do this in person, I don\u2019t like talking on the phone, and you can overthink while texting. I need to see him, talk to him, and hear him.</p><p>I go over to my closet and try to decide which outfit goes with \u201cSorry I almost outed you and I hope we can still be friends.\u201d  God this is a disaster. Just like me I guess. A disaster. I\u2019m just like a hurricane, I leave a mess everywhere I go and I leave people hurt with no turning back. </p><p>I finally decide on my gray shirt Amber bought me for my birthday. I\u2019m not gonna lie it is super comfortable. She did always know what I want, but what she\u2019s done is unforgivable. After I get back from Walkers I fully plan to bury myself under a pound of blankets and cry until the sweet release of death.</p><p>I go down street and started counting, when we were together I figured out it took exactly 230 steps to get to his house. So, it became a habit to count on the way there.</p><p>As I reached the 200s my heart began to pound. I was not prepared for what I was throwing myself into.</p><p>210. Almost there.</p><p>220. I\u2019m right next to his house.</p><p>230. I\u2019m there.</p><p>I knocked on his door. \u201cHere we go.\u201d I whispered under my breath. </p><p>The door opens to reveal his beautiful mother, wearing another outfit Walker designed. His parents are so supportive of his dreams of being a designer, when my dad was around the only option for me was the army. Secretly though, I would try to learn guitar. I borrowed one from Gus\u2019s dad from time to time. I feel like if I had a good teacher, I might be able to go somewhere. Not that my mom could afford it. So I guess for now no dreams is what I can manage. </p><p>\u201cJonah! Sweetheart, it\u2019s been too long, how are you?\u201d She says as she hugs me. </p><p>\u201cHey Violet, I\u2019m great.\u201d I say a little too enthusiastically. \u201cI love the dress is it new?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, Walk just made it last week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell it suits you. Speaking of Walk, is he home?\u201d</p><p>She sighs,\u201dYeah but he\u2019s in a mood, won\u2019t let anyone in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I give it a go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, but say hi to Marcus on the way. We both have really missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you guys too. Life just gets in the way sometimes.\u201d I laugh nervously, obviously they don\u2019t know what happened between us. I\u2019m not going to be the one to tell them that their son and I are in some deep trouble right now.</p><p>\u201cWell, I get that.\u201d She laughs.</p><p>I decide that\u2019s my time to leave. I run across the house, straight to Walker\u2019s door. I took a deep breath to prepare for the storm of hate and rage that was about to hit me. </p><p>*Knock Knock Knock*</p><p>\u201cGO AWAY DAD! I DON\u2019T WANT TO TALK ABOUT GIRLS ANYMORE!\u201d</p><p>Dang he is mad.</p><p>\u201cHot Fudge Sundae\u201d I whispered. We came up with the code right after our first date. It lets us know that it\u2019s each other. My code is hot fudge sundae, and his is painted smiles.</p><p>\u201cJonah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah it\u2019s me. Can I come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes just don\u2019t let anyone follow you.\u201d</p><p>I slowly opened the door, I saw him wrapped in a blanket. He had puffy eyes that matched mine. He obviously didn\u2019t need to be informed on what had happened.</p><p>\u201cAre you ok?\u201d I asked. I already knew the answer but I didn\u2019t know how else to start this conversation.</p><p>\u201cI should be asking you that.\u201d He said. </p><p>He honestly has never sounded worse. I climbed up beside him in the bed and he laid his head on my shoulder. Just like in the good old days. </p><p>\u201cAre you mad at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured you would be, having been a victim of my locker and all\u201d</p><p>He half smiled \u201cI wouldn\u2019t think you put it there yourself, heck, you didn\u2019t know what to identify as a month ago. Did you ever figure that out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, all I know is I\u2019m a little more confused everyday. And you, did you ever pick a label?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now, I like pansexual. I feel like it describes me pretty well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great\u2026 What exactly is that?\u201d</p><p>He laughed a little \u201cI pretty much fall for someone\u2019s personality rather than their gender. I do have a slight preference to males, but I\u2019m open to any gender.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t know that existed. Your right though, it does suit you.\u201d </p><p>He smiles at me, and I smiled back. I\u2019m happy for Walk, it must be comforting to know what you are.</p><p>\u201cHey? We\u2019re going to be ok, right? Like, this will end eventually?\u201d I asked</p><p>\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know Jo, I wish I could tell you yes, but kids are so\u2026 What\u2019s the word?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCruel, hateful, clueless, closed-minded?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d He says looking away.</p><p>We sat there in this silence for awhile. We used to do this for hours, just be with each other. I missed it so much. I don\u2019t like him anymore but I do need him, as my best friend right now. He gets it, what I\u2019m going through, how hard it\u2019s been, how lonely it is. </p><p>All of it.</p><p>It\u2019s easy to rely on the ones you trust. Which why it\u2019s different then someone like TJ or Cyrus. Sure, they seem nice but I don\u2019t trust them yet. As I grew deeper into my thinking, I felt Walker grab my hand. </p><p>I pulled away.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\u201d I mumble verily loud enough to hear.</p><p>He turn to look at me. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this again, Walk, I know times are tough right now. I mean that, but if we go back to how we were we\u2019ll get hurt again. I loved you, and I still do. I just know that we both aren\u2019t mentally stable enough to be together. Not yet.\u201d</p><p>He sat up and moved to the foot of his bed to face me. \u201cI know, I\u2019ve just missed you so much. I won\u2019t do it again, I promise, just don\u2019t\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t leave again. I can handle being friends, and just to let you know I\u2019ve started therapy. I got antidepressants, they work, for the most part. Some days are still tough though. Like today, the locker thing hit me hard, not gonna lie. Then, my dad came up here, and when refused to open the door, he was convinced it because of some girl. It just reminded me that I\u2019m still not as open, or out, as I want to be. It hurts so much Jonah. I used to talk to you about this stuff, then you quit coming around. I get that though. I\u2019ve just been so alone.\u201d He cried. </p><p>I pulled him into a hug and after a couple minutes I pulled away.</p><p>\u201cI know I left. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t want you close. I push those people away, especially when they need me. I get scared then, I hurt them. We both fell victim though, it hurt so much to leave you. I forced myself not to return, I knew we pulling each other down, instead of lifting each other up. I wasn\u2019t going to let that happen. We agreed on that. I am here when you need me though. I might not be much help but I will listen.\u201d I said trying to defend myself.</p><p>He sat there a second, looking at the stars on his ceiling. Then after about two minutes of saying nothing, he got up and went to his closet, he came back with face paint and brushes.</p><p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind but it\u2019s getting kind of serious and I think we both could use a little light heartedness.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love that.\u201d I grinned.</p><p>We both started grabbing colors and brushes. Then I went first. He wanted something goofy, something to make him laugh. So I did the best thing possible, which was turn his head into a giant cheeseburger. As I started on the bun I began to attempt to catch up on what\u2019s been going on.</p><p>\u201cI liked your Mom\u2019s new dress. It had a lot more detail in it then the ones she wore when I was last around.\u201d </p><p>He looked amused. \u201cYeah, took a couple classes and picked up some new techniques.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell they look great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might need to change them then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo offense, but you have no taste sweetie.\u201d He joked</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill not.\u201d </p><p>Within no time were busting out laughing at old memories and inside jokes. It honestly felt so good to be back. It made me happier than I had been in awhile.</p><p>\u201cYou remember the time we tried to do a piggyback race with your sister and Kaylee?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, we ended up just falling over because SOMEONE said I was too heavy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWELL I NEVER SAID I WAS AN ATHLETE!\u201d</p><p>I missed joking around with him he was my best friend, I\u2019m so glad I got him back. I mean he was my BEST friend, even before we dated. He would come over to my house all the time, my mom called him her adopted son. </p><p>\u201cSo how\u2019s Laura aka my mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy moms as good as she can be.\u201d I laughed</p><p>\u201cSo? Still utterly clueless?\u201d </p><p>\u201cAt this point I could write depressed on my head, kiss a guy, and have a panic attack right in front of her, and she still wouldn\u2019t know what was going on.\u201d </p><p>\u201cPlease, at least she isn\u2019t always in your business. I\u2019m surprised I\u2019m still closeted after all the \u2018girl talks\u2019 my dad has had with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYikes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s gonna be so disappointed when he finds out. I\u2019m not even that worried about my mom. She\u2019s so loving that it literally wouldn\u2019t change anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least your mom and dad are still here.\u201d I wasn\u2019t thinking when I said that. The room fell to a hush. We sat there in silence as I finished the last few designs.</p><p>\u201c\u2026and done\u201d I say after finishing my master piece. </p><p>He went over to the mirror and instantly fell over from laughing.</p><p>\u201cNice one Ronald McDonald.\u201d He mocks.</p><p>\u201cLike you\u2019ll do any better.\u201d I say, knowing very well his will be a trillion times better.</p><p>He begins his with a dark brown and continues our conversation. </p><p>\u201cSo when do you think you\u2019ll go back to school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably around\u2026 um\u2026 never. Never sounds good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, it can\u2019t be that bad\u201d he says.</p><p>I take out my phone and read him a few of the hundreds of mean comments, texts, voicemails, emails, and tweets, I had been sent. </p><p>\u201cDang that\u2019s tough. How are you staying so strong?\u201d He asked</p><p>\u201cWell for the most part my phone is turned off, but occasionally I go on to see who they think you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh I do the same thing! I mean I knew about the hate, but I swear I think they have named everyone except me by now. I don\u2019t know if I should offended or relieved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelieved, definitely relieved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know, and just to let you know, I don\u2019t regret anything that happened. Sure, I do wish I wasn\u2019t trending with the anonymous \u2018Picture Boy\u2019 name, but I wouldn\u2019t take back that kiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe either.\u201d I say looking directly in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cFriends?\u201d He asked like I was going to reject the offer.</p><p>\u201cFriends.\u201d I beamed.</p><p>He did a few more touch ups. I could tell because he was super focused and his tongue was sticking out.</p><p>\u201cYour done\u201d he exclaimed. I walk over to the mirror and started laughing at the monkey that was now on my face. It was definitely not what I expected. He usually does more detailed designs but this was simple. I really liked it. </p><p>As I was sitting back down I glanced up at the clock and noticed how late it had gotten. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take off, it was good seeing you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame here.\u201d</p><p>I rushed out his house, first stopping to say goodbye to Marcus and Violet. With the monkey still on my face, I sprinted home, just making it by my curfew. As I walked in my mom started laughing. </p><p>\u201cYou go to Walkers today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup\u201d I said as I slowly walked to my room.</p><p>\u201cGood I like that kid.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI WANT A MONKEY!\u201d Kip chimed in.</p><p>Gosh I love that child. I hope she never goes through what I am. I go over and ruffle her hair. She gives a look of shock. </p><p>Kip then jumps, landing on me. I tried to hold her up but we both end up in the floor. I begin laughing, hard. She jumps up and runs away screaming, giggles slipping through when she catches her breath. She\u2019s adorable.</p><p>I roll over and look up my mom, she had my phone in her hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, i-it was buzzing and I just-\u201c she stutters. </p><p>I half smile, of course this happens. Right when I start to feel better, this stuff happens. It\u2019s almost amusing how my life can\u2019t just be right, not even for a little bit.</p><p>I laugh, not a regular laugh. No, it\u2019s deep, bitter, and cold. I\u2019m done with this, not just this, everything.</p><p>\u201cNope\u201d I say as I storm to my room. So much for a good day.</p><p>\u2014\u2014</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1121\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/233e45a9b5102f5d973a8ff21bb404be/tumblr_poqzboTj9s1w97rg7_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1121\"></figure><p>Jonah\u2019s painting </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1104\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/582387dd7220f2fe6254902ab15bfd66/tumblr_poqzboK0G71w97rg7_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1104\"></figure><p>Walker\u2019s painting </p></p>",

I cried all of last night am now, I\u2019m just laying here. </p><p>\u201cIs this because you and Amber broke up?\u201d A tear rolled down my cheek. </p><p>Amber was the cause for this, Amber is the reason I have this big hole in my heart. The reason multiple people are hurt. And the reason my school hates me.</p><p>\u201cJonah?\u201d </p><p>I storm over to and sling it open. I don\u2019t care if Kip is just a kid, she should learn not to annoy people. She should know that if someone says to leave them alone, they should do it! </p><p>\u201cKIP, I SAID LEAVE! WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE! I WANT TO BE ALONE AND ALL YOU DO IS BUG ME! HONESTLY WHY ARE YOU SO ANNOYING!?!\u201d</p><p>Her eyes fill with tears and her lip pokes out. I instantly knew I messed up. I\u2019m not mad at her. But I have this rage in my stomach and nowhere to put it. </p><p>I hug her and her arms wrap around my waist. As she sobs she apologizes. I feel like the biggest jerk in the universe. She is the best sister a guy could have and I hurt her. </p><p>I crouch down so I can meet her eyes. The sweet caramel color matched my mothers. I sadly am cursed with my father\u2019s eyes. </p><p>\u201cI am so sorry. I love you so much. Your brother is just dealing with some mean kids right now. When I get sad though, I yell and scream, ok? It\u2019s not that you did anything, it\u2019s me. I am working on it.\u201d</p><p>She wiped her eyes and thought about what I said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry the people are being mean to you. I think your the best person in the world. I love you brother, and I want to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just did. Also, was there something you needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah! I almost forgot, your friend is here! He REALLY wants to see you.\u201d I gulped. </p><p>He? That could be one of two people and I don\u2019t want to see either of them.</p><p>Cyrus, probably wants to talk. I upset him yesterday and the last thing I need is to recap yesterday.</p><p>And Walker, he is probably here to yell at me. We ended things as well as we could but, he could easily blame me for what\u2019s happening. Even if I didn\u2019t place the picture there, I was the one who got caught kissing him.</p><p>As I approached the door I was startled, TJ Kippen was standing at the door. He was someone I never expect to see. He is always in his room when I was at Ambers. So. for him to be here is kinda\u2026</p><p>Nerve racking?</p><p>\u201cHey man!\u201d He smiles as I enter the doorway. I give him an awkward bro hug and it just got more confusing.</p><p>\u201cHey, what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>His smile drops, \u201cActually I\u2019m here to talk. Is there somewhere we can go?\u201d </p><p>\u201cUm, yeah my rooms in the very back to the left.\u201d</p><p>As we walked down the hall my mind spiraled just trying to process what was happening, why was he here? </p><p>To yell?</p><p>To blame me?</p><p>To hurt me? </p><p>Definitely not to listen. I did JUST break up with his sister.</p><p>He walks into my room. He sees the baseball I have laying on the floor, he picks it up. He sits on my bed and starts tossing it back and forth in his hands. </p><p>Left</p><p>Right</p><p>Left</p><p>Right</p><p>The pace the ball was going was relaxing to me I was able to steady my breathing to the speed of the ball.</p><p>In </p><p>Out </p><p>In </p><p>Out</p><p>The stress inside my head minimized. I looked away from the ball and pulled a rolly-chair up to my bed. I looked up and met his eyes. The air grew awkward as we sat in silence, I noticed he wasn\u2019t looking at me. Rather, he was staring at the ball. Almost like his life depended on it. I coughed to make some attempt of getting his attention. His eyes slowly drifted to mine and he opened his mouth to say something but shut it before anything came out. Almost like he was ashamed.</p><p>\u201cTJ, I don\u2019t mind you being here but if your here to scream at me can we go ahead and get it over with. I get you think I\u2019m this monster, but I did nothing to Amber. She was aware of my situation and she fully accepted it. That picture was taken before I even started dating Amber. So, if your going to do something do it.\u201d I say this while being shocked by my confidence. I never have stood up to anyone but this is the time I did. </p><p>I stood up and spread my arms out. I was hoping this would make the whole beating up process easier. As I stand there I hear him laugh.</p><p>Laugh?</p><p>Why is he laughing?</p><p>He should be punching, or kicking, or something??</p><p>He looks at me and he says \u201cBro, you more chill then I thought. Obviously we\u2019re cool. Amber knew the relationship was over way before this, she actually wanted to come and apologize for her, since she knew you probably didn\u2019t want to see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\u201d I mutter. As I hear my subconscious scream at me how stupid I am. Of course that\u2019s why he\u2019s here. He wouldn\u2019t just stumble here on his own. </p><p>\u201cI actually was going to come talk to you even if she didn\u2019t force me down here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? No offense to you though, I mean we just haven\u2019t talked before and with recent events you probably I didn\u2019t think you would want to see me anyway. I know I should have probably stopped by your room and said hi before. It\u2019s just that the school kinda makes you out to be this monster. NOT THAT YOU ARE A MONSTER. I was just saying the school thinks that, when it\u2019s totally not true. Also I\u2019ve rambling haven\u2019t I? Wow most people can\u2019t get three words out of me but I am going on and on and on. I\u2019m stopping\u2026 Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take back my chill statement from before.\u201d He smiles. \u201cAlso I get that this is weird, me being here and all. I just wanted to make sure you were ok.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine\u201d I say in a completely monotone manor.</p><p>\u201cLook you don\u2019t have to lie, I get what your going through.\u201d</p><p>He rest my hand on my shoulder. I remove it immediately not wanting to seem rude, I just don\u2019t like being touched. It makes me feel awkward, and I know he doesn\u2019t mean anything by it. I just can\u2019t focus on anything other than his hand on me, if his hands on me.</p><p>I realize I\u2019m focused on the wrong thing and redirect my attention to the conversation in front of me.</p><p>Him? </p><p>He has the perfect life. He wouldn\u2019t know what I\u2019m going through AT ALL! In fact, that couldn\u2019t be farther from the truth! What he said definitely rubbed me the wrong way, and I\u2019m going to let him know it!</p><p>\u201cYou, what on EARTH would you know about what I\u2019m going through.\u201d I feel a tear form in my eye. \u201cI HAVE NO ONE! NO ONE UNDERSTANDS! ESPECIALLY NOT YOU! MR.BASKETBALL MAN! THAT\u2019S ALL YOU ARE, TJ KIPPEN, THE GUY WHO CAN HAVE ANYONE, ANYTIME HE WANTS!\u201d</p><p>He looks me in the eyes, \u201c I was going to be civil Jonah, but screw it.\u201d He says in the deepest, most intimidating voice I\u2019ve ever heard.</p><p>\u201cPOOR LITTLE JONAH! HE\u2019S SO ALONE! HE ONLY HAS HIS FAMILY AND FRIENDS BY HIS SIDE! POOR LITTLE JONAH! GOT HIS FEELINGS HURT! LET\u2019S ALL FORGET THE FACT THAT I WAS OUTED TO THE WHOLE BASKETBALL TEAM! THAT I LOST THE MAJORITY OF MY FRIENDS! THAT I LOST THE PERSON I LOVED BECAUSE HE WASN\u2019T READY! LET\u2019S ALL FOCUS ON JONAH FLIPPING BECK! NO ONE NEEDS A TJ KIPPEN IN THERE LIFE!\u201d He explodes.</p><p>I just stare at him for a second, TJ is gay.</p><p>TJ lost people.</p><p>TJ is hurt.</p><p>TJ came here to feel less alone.</p><p>And I once again stepped all over this great person.</p><p>What is WRONG with me!</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry man, I had no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good, I paid off the team not to tell anyone. I can\u2019t even imagine having this happen to me. Kids are tough.\u201d He chuckles</p><p>\u201cYou can say that again.\u201d</p><p>He smirks, we sit there for a minute, letting the previous conversation soak in. A lot did happen very fast. </p><p>After a minute he gets this look on his face, kinda like he has an idea. He stands up and he says, \u201cWe\u2019re gonna do it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWoah man, we\u2019re cool and all but\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cNO! God no! You are DEFINITELY NOT my type.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThen, what did you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI MEANT we\u2019re going to go talk to them\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d I say slightly confused. Who did he mean by them? He must of picked up on the not so subtle clues that I had no idea what he meant because he explained further.</p><p>\u201cYOUR going to talk to picture boy, and I\u2019M going to talk to my once in a million.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOH! I get\u2014, picture boy? You don\u2019t know who it is?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo man, the picture was taken at a weird angle. You can only make out who you are, don\u2019t you check your phone? Who is picture boy is trending.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? no, No, NO! This can\u2019t- can\u2019t be happening.\u201d </p><p>I lose my perception what reality as my head spins. I can\u2019t breathe and feel myself slide to the floor. I feel like I\u2019m dying as the world gets smaller around me. I can only think of how mad Walkers going to be when he looks at his phone. I feel myself claw into the rug I next to my bed. \u201cHelp!\u201d I make out hoping that someone will hear. I start to slowly hear my Mom\u2019s voice, she tells me that I\u2019m having a panic attack and that it will end. It doesn\u2019t feel like it, but I do slowly feel the air go into my lungs again. I try to focus on that until I get back to where I can recognize what\u2019s happening. TJ is standing at the doorway and my mom has me enveloped in a hug. I am back to being ok.</p><p>My mom knows this and stands up. This has so many times now she doesn\u2019t even ask questions, she just leaves.</p><p>TJ runs over to me. \u201cAre you ok?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and I\u2019m ready. Let\u2019s go talk to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet?\u201d He says.\u201dBut first can you explain what just happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter it\u2019s all over now.\u201d I want him to believe me because I have anxiety and that was a panic attack. Isn\u2019t a conversation I want to have with a total stranger. </p><p>\u201cRight\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlus right now I need to go see Wa\u2014. Er, I mean Picture Boy and you need to see\u2026\u201d I feel myself tense up. I almost said Walker, that would not be good. He could be lying about everything.</p><p>\u201cActually, about that. Let\u2019s not go, my ex and I didn\u2019t end on great terms. I mean we were perfect when we were together, but we both did dumb things. We went from being with each other everyday, to fighting once a week, to a slight \u2018hey, how are you?\u2019 in the hallway, to nothing at all.\u201d He admitted</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no guy is there? I mean, you obviously can\u2019t make up a name so I\u2019ll do it for you. Steve Earle! There\u2019s a name. Joseph Maccoby. There\u2019s another! Look, I GOT A LOT TO DEAL WITH AND IF YOUR JUST HERE TO GET INFORMATION ABOUT ME THEN LEAVE! TELL AMBER YOU APOLOGIZED AND JUST L\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cMarty.\u201d He muttered</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMARTY, that\u2019s my ex! You know Marty, your friend Marty, Marty from the party, Marty the \u2018basketball man\u2019, Marty who has been with me through EVERYTHING!\u201d </p><p>\u201cMarty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup\u201d He said, popping the p.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026 again. I just know with the \u2018Picture Boy\u2019 craze that\u2019s going on, it\u2019s just hard to trust someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get that\u201d he laughed. \u201cYou want to go do something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually I do need to go talk to, you know..\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah ok, I\u2019ll go then.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBye TJ\u201d</p><p>He exits my room. I\u2019m left to progress what just happened. TJ just talked to me. TJ is gay and dated Marty. Is Marty gay? He seems so close to Buffy. Is there a way to like both? Ugh it\u2019s too confusing. </p><p>Back to that Picture Boy thing, was that real? I grabbed my phone and power it on. I cut it off last night because of all of the spamming. I go to Twitter and see that, sure enough, you don\u2019t see Walker very well in the picture. People are trying to guess who it is. I laugh at some that are obviously jokes, I mean I couldn\u2019t see some of them with me in a million years. There were none that even pointed toward Walker as a suspect. Still, I probably do need to talk to him.</p><p>I went to my contacts and scrolled and finally landed on his name. </p><p>Me: Hello Mr. Picture Boy</p><p>Deleted</p><p>Me: Been awhile\u2026</p><p>Deleted</p><p>Me: So how are you?</p><p>Deleted </p><p>Me: I\u2019m coming over.</p><p>Sent</p><p>I decided I would have to do this in person, I don\u2019t like talking on the phone, and you can overthink while texting. I need to see him, talk to him, and hear him.</p><p>I go over to my closet and try to decide which outfit goes with \u201cSorry I almost outed you and I hope we can still be friends.\u201d  God this is a disaster. Just like me I guess. A disaster. I\u2019m just like a hurricane, I leave a mess everywhere I go and I leave people hurt with no turning back. </p><p>I finally decide on my gray shirt Amber bought me for my birthday. I\u2019m not gonna lie it is super comfortable. She did always know what I want, but what she\u2019s done is unforgivable. After I get back from Walkers I fully plan to bury myself under a pound of blankets and cry until the sweet release of death.</p><p>I go down street and started counting, when we were together I figured out it took exactly 230 steps to get to his house. So, it became a habit to count on the way there.</p><p>As I reached the 200s my heart began to pound. I was not prepared for what I was throwing myself into.</p><p>210. Almost there.</p><p>220. I\u2019m right next to his house.</p><p>230. I\u2019m there.</p><p>I knocked on his door. \u201cHere we go.\u201d I whispered under my breath. </p><p>The door opens to reveal his beautiful mother, wearing another outfit Walker designed. His parents are so supportive of his dreams of being a designer, when my dad was around the only option for me was the army. Secretly though, I would try to learn guitar. I borrowed one from Gus\u2019s dad from time to time. I feel like if I had a good teacher, I might be able to go somewhere. Not that my mom could afford it. So I guess for now no dreams is what I can manage. </p><p>\u201cJonah! Sweetheart, it\u2019s been too long, how are you?\u201d She says as she hugs me. </p><p>\u201cHey Violet, I\u2019m great.\u201d I say a little too enthusiastically. \u201cI love the dress is it new?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, Walk just made it last week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell it suits you. Speaking of Walk, is he home?\u201d</p><p>She sighs,\u201dYeah but he\u2019s in a mood, won\u2019t let anyone in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I give it a go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, but say hi to Marcus on the way. We both have really missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you guys too. Life just gets in the way sometimes.\u201d I laugh nervously, obviously they don\u2019t know what happened between us. I\u2019m not going to be the one to tell them that their son and I are in some deep trouble right now.</p><p>\u201cWell, I get that.\u201d She laughs.</p><p>I decide that\u2019s my time to leave. I run across the house, straight to Walker\u2019s door. I took a deep breath to prepare for the storm of hate and rage that was about to hit me. </p><p>*Knock Knock Knock*</p><p>\u201cGO AWAY DAD! I DON\u2019T WANT TO TALK ABOUT GIRLS ANYMORE!\u201d</p><p>Dang he is mad.</p><p>\u201cHot Fudge Sundae\u201d I whispered. We came up with the code right after our first date. It lets us know that it\u2019s each other. My code is hot fudge sundae, and his is painted smiles.</p><p>\u201cJonah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah it\u2019s me. Can I come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes just don\u2019t let anyone follow you.\u201d</p><p>I slowly opened the door, I saw him wrapped in a blanket. He had puffy eyes that matched mine. He obviously didn\u2019t need to be informed on what had happened.</p><p>\u201cAre you ok?\u201d I asked. I already knew the answer but I didn\u2019t know how else to start this conversation.</p><p>\u201cI should be asking you that.\u201d He said. </p><p>He honestly has never sounded worse. I climbed up beside him in the bed and he laid his head on my shoulder. Just like in the good old days. </p><p>\u201cAre you mad at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured you would be, having been a victim of my locker and all\u201d</p><p>He half smiled \u201cI wouldn\u2019t think you put it there yourself, heck, you didn\u2019t know what to identify as a month ago. Did you ever figure that out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, all I know is I\u2019m a little more confused everyday. And you, did you ever pick a label?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now, I like pansexual. I feel like it describes me pretty well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great\u2026 What exactly is that?\u201d</p><p>He laughed a little \u201cI pretty much fall for someone\u2019s personality rather than their gender. I do have a slight preference to males, but I\u2019m open to any gender.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t know that existed. Your right though, it does suit you.\u201d </p><p>He smiles at me, and I smiled back. I\u2019m happy for Walk, it must be comforting to know what you are.</p><p>\u201cHey? We\u2019re going to be ok, right? Like, this will end eventually?\u201d I asked</p><p>\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know Jo, I wish I could tell you yes, but kids are so\u2026 What\u2019s the word?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCruel, hateful, clueless, closed-minded?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d He says looking away.</p><p>We sat there in this silence for awhile. We used to do this for hours, just be with each other. I missed it so much. I don\u2019t like him anymore but I do need him, as my best friend right now. He gets it, what I\u2019m going through, how hard it\u2019s been, how lonely it is. </p><p>All of it.</p><p>It\u2019s easy to rely on the ones you trust. Which why it\u2019s different then someone like TJ or Cyrus. Sure, they seem nice but I don\u2019t trust them yet. As I grew deeper into my thinking, I felt Walker grab my hand. </p><p>I pulled away.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\u201d I mumble verily loud enough to hear.</p><p>He turn to look at me. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this again, Walk, I know times are tough right now. I mean that, but if we go back to how we were we\u2019ll get hurt again. I loved you, and I still do. I just know that we both aren\u2019t mentally stable enough to be together. Not yet.\u201d</p><p>He sat up and moved to the foot of his bed to face me. \u201cI know, I\u2019ve just missed you so much. I won\u2019t do it again, I promise, just don\u2019t\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t leave again. I can handle being friends, and just to let you know I\u2019ve started therapy. I got antidepressants, they work, for the most part. Some days are still tough though. Like today, the locker thing hit me hard, not gonna lie. Then, my dad came up here, and when refused to open the door, he was convinced it because of some girl. It just reminded me that I\u2019m still not as open, or out, as I want to be. It hurts so much Jonah. I used to talk to you about this stuff, then you quit coming around. I get that though. I\u2019ve just been so alone.\u201d He cried. </p><p>I pulled him into a hug and after a couple minutes I pulled away.</p><p>\u201cI know I left. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t want you close. I push those people away, especially when they need me. I get scared then, I hurt them. We both fell victim though, it hurt so much to leave you. I forced myself not to return, I knew we pulling each other down, instead of lifting each other up. I wasn\u2019t going to let that happen. We agreed on that. I am here when you need me though. I might not be much help but I will listen.\u201d I said trying to defend myself.</p><p>He sat there a second, looking at the stars on his ceiling. Then after about two minutes of saying nothing, he got up and went to his closet, he came back with face paint and brushes.</p><p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind but it\u2019s getting kind of serious and I think we both could use a little light heartedness.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love that.\u201d I grinned.</p><p>We both started grabbing colors and brushes. Then I went first. He wanted something goofy, something to make him laugh. So I did the best thing possible, which was turn his head into a giant cheeseburger. As I started on the bun I began to attempt to catch up on what\u2019s been going on.</p><p>\u201cI liked your Mom\u2019s new dress. It had a lot more detail in it then the ones she wore when I was last around.\u201d </p><p>He looked amused. \u201cYeah, took a couple classes and picked up some new techniques.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell they look great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might need to change them then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo offense, but you have no taste sweetie.\u201d He joked</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill not.\u201d </p><p>Within no time were busting out laughing at old memories and inside jokes. It honestly felt so good to be back. It made me happier than I had been in awhile.</p><p>\u201cYou remember the time we tried to do a piggyback race with your sister and Kaylee?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, we ended up just falling over because SOMEONE said I was too heavy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWELL I NEVER SAID I WAS AN ATHLETE!\u201d</p><p>I missed joking around with him he was my best friend, I\u2019m so glad I got him back. I mean he was my BEST friend, even before we dated. He would come over to my house all the time, my mom called him her adopted son. </p><p>\u201cSo how\u2019s Laura aka my mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy moms as good as she can be.\u201d I laughed</p><p>\u201cSo? Still utterly clueless?\u201d </p><p>\u201cAt this point I could write depressed on my head, kiss a guy, and have a panic attack right in front of her, and she still wouldn\u2019t know what was going on.\u201d </p><p>\u201cPlease, at least she isn\u2019t always in your business. I\u2019m surprised I\u2019m still closeted after all the \u2018girl talks\u2019 my dad has had with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYikes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s gonna be so disappointed when he finds out. I\u2019m not even that worried about my mom. She\u2019s so loving that it literally wouldn\u2019t change anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least your mom and dad are still here.\u201d I wasn\u2019t thinking when I said that. The room fell to a hush. We sat there in silence as I finished the last few designs.</p><p>\u201c\u2026and done\u201d I say after finishing my master piece. </p><p>He went over to the mirror and instantly fell over from laughing.</p><p>\u201cNice one Ronald McDonald.\u201d He mocks.</p><p>\u201cLike you\u2019ll do any better.\u201d I say, knowing very well his will be a trillion times better.</p><p>He begins his with a dark brown and continues our conversation. </p><p>\u201cSo when do you think you\u2019ll go back to school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably around\u2026 um\u2026 never. Never sounds good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, it can\u2019t be that bad\u201d he says.</p><p>I take out my phone and read him a few of the hundreds of mean comments, texts, voicemails, emails, and tweets, I had been sent. </p><p>\u201cDang that\u2019s tough. How are you staying so strong?\u201d He asked</p><p>\u201cWell for the most part my phone is turned off, but occasionally I go on to see who they think you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh I do the same thing! I mean I knew about the hate, but I swear I think they have named everyone except me by now. I don\u2019t know if I should offended or relieved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelieved, definitely relieved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know, and just to let you know, I don\u2019t regret anything that happened. Sure, I do wish I wasn\u2019t trending with the anonymous \u2018Picture Boy\u2019 name, but I wouldn\u2019t take back that kiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe either.\u201d I say looking directly in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cFriends?\u201d He asked like I was going to reject the offer.</p><p>\u201cFriends.\u201d I beamed.</p><p>He did a few more touch ups. I could tell because he was super focused and his tongue was sticking out.</p><p>\u201cYour done\u201d he exclaimed. I walk over to the mirror and started laughing at the monkey that was now on my face. It was definitely not what I expected. He usually does more detailed designs but this was simple. I really liked it. </p><p>As I was sitting back down I glanced up at the clock and noticed how late it had gotten. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take off, it was good seeing you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame here.\u201d</p><p>I rushed out his house, first stopping to say goodbye to Marcus and Violet. With the monkey still on my face, I sprinted home, just making it by my curfew. As I walked in my mom started laughing. </p><p>\u201cYou go to Walkers today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup\u201d I said as I slowly walked to my room.</p><p>\u201cGood I like that kid.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI WANT A MONKEY!\u201d Kip chimed in.</p><p>Gosh I love that child. I hope she never goes through what I am. I go over and ruffle her hair. She gives a look of shock. </p><p>Kip then jumps, landing on me. I tried to hold her up but we both end up in the floor. I begin laughing, hard. She jumps up and runs away screaming, giggles slipping through when she catches her breath. She\u2019s adorable.</p><p>I roll over and look up my mom, she had my phone in her hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, i-it was buzzing and I just-\u201c she stutters. </p><p>I half smile, of course this happens. Right when I start to feel better, this stuff happens. It\u2019s almost amusing how my life can\u2019t just be right, not even for a little bit.</p><p>I laugh, not a regular laugh. No, it\u2019s deep, bitter, and cold. I\u2019m done with this, not just this, everything.</p><p>\u201cNope\u201d I say as I storm to my room. So much for a good day.</p><p>\u2014\u2014</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1121\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/233e45a9b5102f5d973a8ff21bb404be/tumblr_poqzboTj9s1w97rg7_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1121\"></figure><p>Jonah\u2019s painting </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1104\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/582387dd7220f2fe6254902ab15bfd66/tumblr_poqzboK0G71w97rg7_1280.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"1104\"></figure><p>Walker\u2019s painting </p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h1>Coping | Part 2</h1><p><br /></p><p>&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>*knock knock knock*</p><p>&ldquo;Brother are you okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Kip please leave me alone, I&rsquo;m dealing with some stuff.&rdquo; I attempt to say, but I&rsquo;m just so hoarse. I cried all of last night am now, I&rsquo;m just laying here. </p><p>&ldquo;Is this because you and Amber broke up?&rdquo; A tear rolled down my cheek. </p><p>Amber was the cause for this, Amber is the reason I have this big hole in my heart. The reason multiple people are hurt. And the reason my school hates me.</p><p>&ldquo;Jonah?&rdquo; </p><p>I storm over to and sling it open. I don&rsquo;t care if Kip is just a kid, she should learn not to annoy people. She should know that if someone says to leave them alone, they should do it! </p><p>&ldquo;KIP, I SAID LEAVE! WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE! I WANT TO BE ALONE AND ALL YOU DO IS BUG ME! HONESTLY WHY ARE YOU SO ANNOYING!?!&rdquo;</p><p>Her eyes fill with tears and her lip pokes out. I instantly knew I messed up. I&rsquo;m not mad at her. But I have this rage in my stomach and nowhere to put it. </p><p>I hug her and her arms wrap around my waist. As she sobs she apologizes. I feel like the biggest jerk in the universe. She is the best sister a guy could have and I hurt her. </p><p>I crouch down so I can meet her eyes. The sweet caramel color matched my mothers. I sadly am cursed with my father&rsquo;s eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;I am so sorry. I love you so much. Your brother is just dealing with some mean kids right now. When I get sad though, I yell and scream, ok? It&rsquo;s not that you did anything, it&rsquo;s me. I am working on it.&rdquo;</p><p>She wiped her eyes and thought about what I said.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry the people are being mean to you. I think your the best person in the world. I love you brother, and I want to help.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You just did. Also, was there something you needed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh yeah! I almost forgot, your friend is here! He REALLY wants to see you.&rdquo; I gulped. </p><p>He? That could be one of two people and I don&rsquo;t want to see either of them.</p><p>Cyrus, probably wants to talk. I upset him yesterday and the last thing I need is to recap yesterday.</p><p>And Walker, he is probably here to yell at me. We ended things as well as we could but, he could easily blame me for what&rsquo;s happening. Even if I didn&rsquo;t place the picture there, I was the one who got caught kissing him.</p><p>As I approached the door I was startled, TJ Kippen was standing at the door. He was someone I never expect to see. He is always in his room when I was at Ambers. So. for him to be here is kinda&hellip;</p><p>Nerve racking?</p><p>&ldquo;Hey man!&rdquo; He smiles as I enter the doorway. I give him an awkward bro hug and it just got more confusing.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, what are you doing here?&rdquo;</p><p>His smile drops, &ldquo;Actually I&rsquo;m here to talk. Is there somewhere we can go?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Um, yeah my rooms in the very back to the left.&rdquo;</p><p>As we walked down the hall my mind spiraled just trying to process what was happening, why was he here? </p><p>To yell?</p><p>To blame me?</p><p>To hurt me? </p><p>Definitely not to listen. I did JUST break up with his sister.</p><p>He walks into my room. He sees the baseball I have laying on the floor, he picks it up. He sits on my bed and starts tossing it back and forth in his hands. </p><p>Left</p><p>Right</p><p>Left</p><p>Right</p><p>The pace the ball was going was relaxing to me I was able to steady my breathing to the speed of the ball.</p><p>In </p><p>Out </p><p>In </p><p>Out</p><p>The stress inside my head minimized. I looked away from the ball and pulled a rolly-chair up to my bed. I looked up and met his eyes. The air grew awkward as we sat in silence, I noticed he wasn&rsquo;t looking at me. Rather, he was staring at the ball. Almost like his life depended on it. I coughed to make some attempt of getting his attention. His eyes slowly drifted to mine and he opened his mouth to say something but shut it before anything came out. Almost like he was ashamed.</p><p>&ldquo;TJ, I don&rsquo;t mind you being here but if your here to scream at me can we go ahead and get it over with. I get you think I&rsquo;m this monster, but I did nothing to Amber. She was aware of my situation and she fully accepted it. That picture was taken before I even started dating Amber. So, if your going to do something do it.&rdquo; I say this while being shocked by my confidence. I never have stood up to anyone but this is the time I did. </p><p>I stood up and spread my arms out. I was hoping this would make the whole beating up process easier. As I stand there I hear him laugh.</p><p>Laugh?</p><p>Why is he laughing?</p><p>He should be punching, or kicking, or something??</p><p>He looks at me and he says &ldquo;Bro, you more chill then I thought. Obviously we&rsquo;re cool. Amber knew the relationship was over way before this, she actually wanted to come and apologize for her, since she knew you probably didn&rsquo;t want to see her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh&rdquo; I mutter. As I hear my subconscious scream at me how stupid I am. Of course that&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s here. He wouldn&rsquo;t just stumble here on his own. </p><p>&ldquo;I actually was going to come talk to you even if she didn&rsquo;t force me down here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why? No offense to you though, I mean we just haven&rsquo;t talked before and with recent events you probably I didn&rsquo;t think you would want to see me anyway. I know I should have probably stopped by your room and said hi before. It&rsquo;s just that the school kinda makes you out to be this monster. NOT THAT YOU ARE A MONSTER. I was just saying the school thinks that, when it&rsquo;s totally not true. Also I&rsquo;ve rambling haven&rsquo;t I? Wow most people can&rsquo;t get three words out of me but I am going on and on and on. I&rsquo;m stopping&hellip; Now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I take back my chill statement from before.&rdquo; He smiles. &ldquo;Also I get that this is weird, me being here and all. I just wanted to make sure you were ok.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m fine&rdquo; I say in a completely monotone manor.</p><p>&ldquo;Look you don&rsquo;t have to lie, I get what your going through.&rdquo;</p><p>He rest my hand on my shoulder. I remove it immediately not wanting to seem rude, I just don&rsquo;t like being touched. It makes me feel awkward, and I know he doesn&rsquo;t mean anything by it. I just can&rsquo;t focus on anything other than his hand on me, if his hands on me.</p><p>I realize I&rsquo;m focused on the wrong thing and redirect my attention to the conversation in front of me.</p><p>Him? </p><p>He has the perfect life. He wouldn&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m going through AT ALL! In fact, that couldn&rsquo;t be farther from the truth! What he said definitely rubbed me the wrong way, and I&rsquo;m going to let him know it!</p><p>&ldquo;You, what on EARTH would you know about what I&rsquo;m going through.&rdquo; I feel a tear form in my eye. &ldquo;I HAVE NO ONE! NO ONE UNDERSTANDS! ESPECIALLY NOT YOU! MR.BASKETBALL MAN! THAT&rsquo;S ALL YOU ARE, TJ KIPPEN, THE GUY WHO CAN HAVE ANYONE, ANYTIME HE WANTS!&rdquo;</p><p>He looks me in the eyes, &ldquo; I was going to be civil Jonah, but screw it.&rdquo; He says in the deepest, most intimidating voice I&rsquo;ve ever heard.</p><p>&ldquo;POOR LITTLE JONAH! HE&rsquo;S SO ALONE! HE ONLY HAS HIS FAMILY AND FRIENDS BY HIS SIDE! POOR LITTLE JONAH! GOT HIS FEELINGS HURT! LET&rsquo;S ALL FORGET THE FACT THAT I WAS OUTED TO THE WHOLE BASKETBALL TEAM! THAT I LOST THE MAJORITY OF MY FRIENDS! THAT I LOST THE PERSON I LOVED BECAUSE HE WASN&rsquo;T READY! LET&rsquo;S ALL FOCUS ON JONAH FLIPPING BECK! NO ONE NEEDS A TJ KIPPEN IN THERE LIFE!&rdquo; He explodes.</p><p>I just stare at him for a second, TJ is gay.</p><p>TJ lost people.</p><p>TJ is hurt.</p><p>TJ came here to feel less alone.</p><p>And I once again stepped all over this great person.</p><p>What is WRONG with me!</p><p>&ldquo;I-I&rsquo;m sorry man, I had no idea.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good, I paid off the team not to tell anyone. I can&rsquo;t even imagine having this happen to me. Kids are tough.&rdquo; He chuckles</p><p>&ldquo;You can say that again.&rdquo;</p><p>He smirks, we sit there for a minute, letting the previous conversation soak in. A lot did happen very fast. </p><p>After a minute he gets this look on his face, kinda like he has an idea. He stands up and he says, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re gonna do it.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Woah man, we&rsquo;re cool and all but&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;NO! God no! You are DEFINITELY NOT my type.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Then, what did you mean?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I MEANT we&rsquo;re going to go talk to them&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh&hellip;&rdquo; I say slightly confused. Who did he mean by them? He must of picked up on the not so subtle clues that I had no idea what he meant because he explained further.</p><p>&ldquo;YOUR going to talk to picture boy, and I&rsquo;M going to talk to my once in a million.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;OH! I get&mdash;, picture boy? You don&rsquo;t know who it is?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No man, the picture was taken at a weird angle. You can only make out who you are, don&rsquo;t you check your phone? Who is picture boy is trending.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What? no, No, NO! This can&rsquo;t- can&rsquo;t be happening.&rdquo; </p><p>I lose my perception what reality as my head spins. I can&rsquo;t breathe and feel myself slide to the floor. I feel like I&rsquo;m dying as the world gets smaller around me. I can only think of how mad Walkers going to be when he looks at his phone. I feel myself claw into the rug I next to my bed. &ldquo;Help!&rdquo; I make out hoping that someone will hear. I start to slowly hear my Mom&rsquo;s voice, she tells me that I&rsquo;m having a panic attack and that it will end. It doesn&rsquo;t feel like it, but I do slowly feel the air go into my lungs again. I try to focus on that until I get back to where I can recognize what&rsquo;s happening. TJ is standing at the doorway and my mom has me enveloped in a hug. I am back to being ok.</p><p>My mom knows this and stands up. This has so many times now she doesn&rsquo;t even ask questions, she just leaves.</p><p>TJ runs over to me. &ldquo;Are you ok?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, and I&rsquo;m ready. Let&rsquo;s go talk to them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sweet?&rdquo; He says.&rdquo;But first can you explain what just happened?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t matter it&rsquo;s all over now.&rdquo; I want him to believe me because I have anxiety and that was a panic attack. Isn&rsquo;t a conversation I want to have with a total stranger. </p><p>&ldquo;Right&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Plus right now I need to go see Wa&mdash;. Er, I mean Picture Boy and you need to see&hellip;&rdquo; I feel myself tense up. I almost said Walker, that would not be good. He could be lying about everything.</p><p>&ldquo;Actually, about that. Let&rsquo;s not go, my ex and I didn&rsquo;t end on great terms. I mean we were perfect when we were together, but we both did dumb things. We went from being with each other everyday, to fighting once a week, to a slight &lsquo;hey, how are you?&rsquo; in the hallway, to nothing at all.&rdquo; He admitted</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no guy is there? I mean, you obviously can&rsquo;t make up a name so I&rsquo;ll do it for you. Steve Earle! There&rsquo;s a name. Joseph Maccoby. There&rsquo;s another! Look, I GOT A LOT TO DEAL WITH AND IF YOUR JUST HERE TO GET INFORMATION ABOUT ME THEN LEAVE! TELL AMBER YOU APOLOGIZED AND JUST L&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Marty.&rdquo; He muttered</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;MARTY, that&rsquo;s my ex! You know Marty, your friend Marty, Marty from the party, Marty the &lsquo;basketball man&rsquo;, Marty who has been with me through EVERYTHING!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Marty?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yup&rdquo; He said, popping the p.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip; again. I just know with the &lsquo;Picture Boy&rsquo; craze that&rsquo;s going on, it&rsquo;s just hard to trust someone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I get that&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;You want to go do something?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Actually I do need to go talk to, you know..&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah ok, I&rsquo;ll go then.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Bye TJ&rdquo;</p><p>He exits my room. I&rsquo;m left to progress what just happened. TJ just talked to me. TJ is gay and dated Marty. Is Marty gay? He seems so close to Buffy. Is there a way to like both? Ugh it&rsquo;s too confusing. </p><p>Back to that Picture Boy thing, was that real? I grabbed my phone and power it on. I cut it off last night because of all of the spamming. I go to Twitter and see that, sure enough, you don&rsquo;t see Walker very well in the picture. People are trying to guess who it is. I laugh at some that are obviously jokes, I mean I couldn&rsquo;t see some of them with me in a million years. There were none that even pointed toward Walker as a suspect. Still, I probably do need to talk to him.</p><p>I went to my contacts and scrolled and finally landed on his name. </p><p>Me: Hello Mr. Picture Boy</p><p>Deleted</p><p>Me: Been awhile&hellip;</p><p>Deleted</p><p>Me: So how are you?</p><p>Deleted </p><p>Me: I&rsquo;m coming over.</p><p>Sent</p><p>I decided I would have to do this in person, I don&rsquo;t like talking on the phone, and you can overthink while texting. I need to see him, talk to him, and hear him.</p><p>I go over to my closet and try to decide which outfit goes with &ldquo;Sorry I almost outed you and I hope we can still be friends.&rdquo;  God this is a disaster. Just like me I guess. A disaster. I&rsquo;m just like a hurricane, I leave a mess everywhere I go and I leave people hurt with no turning back. </p><p>I finally decide on my gray shirt Amber bought me for my birthday. I&rsquo;m not gonna lie it is super comfortable. She did always know what I want, but what she&rsquo;s done is unforgivable. After I get back from Walkers I fully plan to bury myself under a pound of blankets and cry until the sweet release of death.</p><p>I go down street and started counting, when we were together I figured out it took exactly 230 steps to get to his house. So, it became a habit to count on the way there.</p><p>As I reached the 200s my heart began to pound. I was not prepared for what I was throwing myself into.</p><p>210. Almost there.</p><p>220. I&rsquo;m right next to his house.</p><p>230. I&rsquo;m there.</p><p>I knocked on his door. &ldquo;Here we go.&rdquo; I whispered under my breath. </p><p>The door opens to reveal his beautiful mother, wearing another outfit Walker designed. His parents are so supportive of his dreams of being a designer, when my dad was around the only option for me was the army. Secretly though, I would try to learn guitar. I borrowed one from Gus&rsquo;s dad from time to time. I feel like if I had a good teacher, I might be able to go somewhere. Not that my mom could afford it. So I guess for now no dreams is what I can manage. </p><p>&ldquo;Jonah! Sweetheart, it&rsquo;s been too long, how are you?&rdquo; She says as she hugs me. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey Violet, I&rsquo;m great.&rdquo; I say a little too enthusiastically. &ldquo;I love the dress is it new?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yep, Walk just made it last week.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well it suits you. Speaking of Walk, is he home?&rdquo;</p><p>She sighs,&rdquo;Yeah but he&rsquo;s in a mood, won&rsquo;t let anyone in.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can I give it a go?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure, but say hi to Marcus on the way. We both have really missed you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve missed you guys too. Life just gets in the way sometimes.&rdquo; I laugh nervously, obviously they don&rsquo;t know what happened between us. I&rsquo;m not going to be the one to tell them that their son and I are in some deep trouble right now.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I get that.&rdquo; She laughs.</p><p>I decide that&rsquo;s my time to leave. I run across the house, straight to Walker&rsquo;s door. I took a deep breath to prepare for the storm of hate and rage that was about to hit me. </p><p>*Knock Knock Knock*</p><p>&ldquo;GO AWAY DAD! I DON&rsquo;T WANT TO TALK ABOUT GIRLS ANYMORE!&rdquo;</p><p>Dang he is mad.</p><p>&ldquo;Hot Fudge Sundae&rdquo; I whispered. We came up with the code right after our first date. It lets us know that it&rsquo;s each other. My code is hot fudge sundae, and his is painted smiles.</p><p>&ldquo;Jonah?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah it&rsquo;s me. Can I come in?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes just don&rsquo;t let anyone follow you.&rdquo;</p><p>I slowly opened the door, I saw him wrapped in a blanket. He had puffy eyes that matched mine. He obviously didn&rsquo;t need to be informed on what had happened.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you ok?&rdquo; I asked. I already knew the answer but I didn&rsquo;t know how else to start this conversation.</p><p>&ldquo;I should be asking you that.&rdquo; He said. </p><p>He honestly has never sounded worse. I climbed up beside him in the bed and he laid his head on my shoulder. Just like in the good old days. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you mad at me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I figured you would be, having been a victim of my locker and all&rdquo;</p><p>He half smiled &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t think you put it there yourself, heck, you didn&rsquo;t know what to identify as a month ago. Did you ever figure that out?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nope, all I know is I&rsquo;m a little more confused everyday. And you, did you ever pick a label?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right now, I like pansexual. I feel like it describes me pretty well.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great&hellip; What exactly is that?&rdquo;</p><p>He laughed a little &ldquo;I pretty much fall for someone&rsquo;s personality rather than their gender. I do have a slight preference to males, but I&rsquo;m open to any gender.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t know that existed. Your right though, it does suit you.&rdquo; </p><p>He smiles at me, and I smiled back. I&rsquo;m happy for Walk, it must be comforting to know what you are.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey? We&rsquo;re going to be ok, right? Like, this will end eventually?&rdquo; I asked</p><p>&ldquo;I honestly don&rsquo;t know Jo, I wish I could tell you yes, but kids are so&hellip; What&rsquo;s the word?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cruel, hateful, clueless, closed-minded?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;&rdquo; He says looking away.</p><p>We sat there in this silence for awhile. We used to do this for hours, just be with each other. I missed it so much. I don&rsquo;t like him anymore but I do need him, as my best friend right now. He gets it, what I&rsquo;m going through, how hard it&rsquo;s been, how lonely it is. </p><p>All of it.</p><p>It&rsquo;s easy to rely on the ones you trust. Which why it&rsquo;s different then someone like TJ or Cyrus. Sure, they seem nice but I don&rsquo;t trust them yet. As I grew deeper into my thinking, I felt Walker grab my hand. </p><p>I pulled away.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&rdquo; I mumble verily loud enough to hear.</p><p>He turn to look at me. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do this again, Walk, I know times are tough right now. I mean that, but if we go back to how we were we&rsquo;ll get hurt again. I loved you, and I still do. I just know that we both aren&rsquo;t mentally stable enough to be together. Not yet.&rdquo;</p><p>He sat up and moved to the foot of his bed to face me. &ldquo;I know, I&rsquo;ve just missed you so much. I won&rsquo;t do it again, I promise, just don&rsquo;t&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just don&rsquo;t what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just don&rsquo;t leave again. I can handle being friends, and just to let you know I&rsquo;ve started therapy. I got antidepressants, they work, for the most part. Some days are still tough though. Like today, the locker thing hit me hard, not gonna lie. Then, my dad came up here, and when refused to open the door, he was convinced it because of some girl. It just reminded me that I&rsquo;m still not as open, or out, as I want to be. It hurts so much Jonah. I used to talk to you about this stuff, then you quit coming around. I get that though. I&rsquo;ve just been so alone.&rdquo; He cried. </p><p>I pulled him into a hug and after a couple minutes I pulled away.</p><p>&ldquo;I know I left. That&rsquo;s why I didn&rsquo;t want you close. I push those people away, especially when they need me. I get scared then, I hurt them. We both fell victim though, it hurt so much to leave you. I forced myself not to return, I knew we pulling each other down, instead of lifting each other up. I wasn&rsquo;t going to let that happen. We agreed on that. I am here when you need me though. I might not be much help but I will listen.&rdquo; I said trying to defend myself.</p><p>He sat there a second, looking at the stars on his ceiling. Then after about two minutes of saying nothing, he got up and went to his closet, he came back with face paint and brushes.</p><p>&ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t mind but it&rsquo;s getting kind of serious and I think we both could use a little light heartedness.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d love that.&rdquo; I grinned.</p><p>We both started grabbing colors and brushes. Then I went first. He wanted something goofy, something to make him laugh. So I did the best thing possible, which was turn his head into a giant cheeseburger. As I started on the bun I began to attempt to catch up on what&rsquo;s been going on.</p><p>&ldquo;I liked your Mom&rsquo;s new dress. It had a lot more detail in it then the ones she wore when I was last around.&rdquo; </p><p>He looked amused. &ldquo;Yeah, took a couple classes and picked up some new techniques.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well they look great.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I might need to change them then.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No offense, but you have no taste sweetie.&rdquo; He joked</p><p>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Will not.&rdquo; </p><p>Within no time were busting out laughing at old memories and inside jokes. It honestly felt so good to be back. It made me happier than I had been in awhile.</p><p>&ldquo;You remember the time we tried to do a piggyback race with your sister and Kaylee?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, we ended up just falling over because SOMEONE said I was too heavy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;WELL I NEVER SAID I WAS AN ATHLETE!&rdquo;</p><p>I missed joking around with him he was my best friend, I&rsquo;m so glad I got him back. I mean he was my BEST friend, even before we dated. He would come over to my house all the time, my mom called him her adopted son. </p><p>&ldquo;So how&rsquo;s Laura aka my mom?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My moms as good as she can be.&rdquo; I laughed</p><p>&ldquo;So? Still utterly clueless?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;At this point I could write depressed on my head, kiss a guy, and have a panic attack right in front of her, and she still wouldn&rsquo;t know what was going on.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Please, at least she isn&rsquo;t always in your business. I&rsquo;m surprised I&rsquo;m still closeted after all the &lsquo;girl talks&rsquo; my dad has had with me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yikes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, he&rsquo;s gonna be so disappointed when he finds out. I&rsquo;m not even that worried about my mom. She&rsquo;s so loving that it literally wouldn&rsquo;t change anything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;At least your mom and dad are still here.&rdquo; I wasn&rsquo;t thinking when I said that. The room fell to a hush. We sat there in silence as I finished the last few designs.</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;and done&rdquo; I say after finishing my master piece. </p><p>He went over to the mirror and instantly fell over from laughing.</p><p>&ldquo;Nice one Ronald McDonald.&rdquo; He mocks.</p><p>&ldquo;Like you&rsquo;ll do any better.&rdquo; I say, knowing very well his will be a trillion times better.</p><p>He begins his with a dark brown and continues our conversation. </p><p>&ldquo;So when do you think you&rsquo;ll go back to school.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Probably around&hellip; um&hellip; never. Never sounds good.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, it can&rsquo;t be that bad&rdquo; he says.</p><p>I take out my phone and read him a few of the hundreds of mean comments, texts, voicemails, emails, and tweets, I had been sent. </p><p>&ldquo;Dang that&rsquo;s tough. How are you staying so strong?&rdquo; He asked</p><p>&ldquo;Well for the most part my phone is turned off, but occasionally I go on to see who they think you are.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh I do the same thing! I mean I knew about the hate, but I swear I think they have named everyone except me by now. I don&rsquo;t know if I should offended or relieved.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Relieved, definitely relieved.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good to know, and just to let you know, I don&rsquo;t regret anything that happened. Sure, I do wish I wasn&rsquo;t trending with the anonymous &lsquo;Picture Boy&rsquo; name, but I wouldn&rsquo;t take back that kiss.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Me either.&rdquo; I say looking directly in his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Friends?&rdquo; He asked like I was going to reject the offer.</p><p>&ldquo;Friends.&rdquo; I beamed.</p><p>He did a few more touch ups. I could tell because he was super focused and his tongue was sticking out.</p><p>&ldquo;Your done&rdquo; he exclaimed. I walk over to the mirror and started laughing at the monkey that was now on my face. It was definitely not what I expected. He usually does more detailed designs but this was simple. I really liked it. </p><p>As I was sitting back down I glanced up at the clock and noticed how late it had gotten. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take off, it was good seeing you again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Same here.&rdquo;</p><p>I rushed out his house, first stopping to say goodbye to Marcus and Violet. With the monkey still on my face, I sprinted home, just making it by my curfew. As I walked in my mom started laughing. </p><p>&ldquo;You go to Walkers today?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yup&rdquo; I said as I slowly walked to my room.</p><p>&ldquo;Good I like that kid.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I WANT A MONKEY!&rdquo; Kip chimed in.</p><p>Gosh I love that child. I hope she never goes through what I am. I go over and ruffle her hair. She gives a look of shock. </p><p>Kip then jumps, landing on me. I tried to hold her up but we both end up in the floor. I begin laughing, hard. She jumps up and runs away screaming, giggles slipping through when she catches her breath. She&rsquo;s adorable.</p><p>I roll over and look up my mom, she had my phone in her hand.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, i-it was buzzing and I just-&ldquo; she stutters. </p><p>I half smile, of course this happens. Right when I start to feel better, this stuff happens. It&rsquo;s almost amusing how my life can&rsquo;t just be right, not even for a little bit.</p><p>I laugh, not a regular laugh. No, it&rsquo;s deep, bitter, and cold. I&rsquo;m done with this, not just this, everything.</p><p>&ldquo;Nope&rdquo; I say as I storm to my room. So much for a good day.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/233e45a9b5102f5d973a8ff21bb404be/tumblr_poqzboTj9s1w97rg7_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Jonah&rsquo;s painting </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/582387dd7220f2fe6254902ab15bfd66/tumblr_poqzboK0G71w97rg7_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Walker&rsquo;s painting </p></p>",

He said he liked me, too, which is what shocked me the most. I never would\u2019ve expected that in my wildest dreams!</p><p>Anyway, the ever so elusive prom is coming up next week and I don\u2019t have a date! Shocking! I kind of hoped TJ would ask me since we had that whole ~moment~ the other day, but I guess not. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever have the courage to ask him myself, either. Man, I wish he could just read my thoughts so he\u2019d know. Actually, skip that. Maybe that\u2019s not SUCH a great idea. </p><p>Buffy and Andi have been bugging me to tell them who I want to go with. Buffy\u2019s going with Marty and Andi was on the decorating committee so she\u2019s not planning on bringing anyone. Amber will probably tag along, though. </p><p>After an hour of incessant whining from the two I told them. I don\u2019t know why I wanted to hide it in the first place, honestly. But, yes, TJ is the \u201clucky guy\u201d. Is he, though? He\u2019s beyond gorgeous. Inside AND out. Those darn green eyes complement his smile so gracefully and his whole face just goes perfectly with his warm laugh (and he smells like strawberries?!). Sometimes (okay, all the time), I want to hug him forever. </p><p>Okay, I\u2019m getting off track. TJ\u2019s promposal (I can\u2019t believe I said \u201cpromposal\u201d):</p><p>So, I learnt how to \u201cshoot hoops\u201d from Buffy (I should say \u201cshoot hoop\u201d because I only got one in the basket). I stole my dad\u2019s CD marker (from his CD burning phase) and wrote, \u201cwill you go to prom with me\u201d on an old basketball I found rotting in the garage.</p><p>I texted TJ and asked him if he wanted to play some one-on-one. He said, and I quote, \u201cWho are you and what have you done with Cyrus?\u201d (Real sweetheart, isn\u2019t he?)</p><p>Regardless, we met at the court in the park and boy, was he shocked to see me carrying my own ball. He came with a large bag, which I assumed was filled with sports&hellip; paraphernalia. He set down the bag and said, \u201cOkay, Cyrus, I\u2019ll take it easy on you, don\u2019t worry. Take the ball.\u201d Oh gosh, my heart must have been beating a mile a minute! I was so scared my nervous, sweaty palms would smudge the ink on the ball, even though I KNEW they wouldn\u2019t. Feelings, huh?</p><p>He didn\u2019t even TRY to take the ball from me. He just let me shoot! I was hoping he\u2019d take the ball and see what was written on it but he is just as oblivious as he was that day on the swings. I needed to get him to see it SOMEHOW, so after I made the basket (which TJ was IMMENSELY impressed by, btw- it made my heart shiver&hellip; in a good way), I said, \u201cLoser takes it out,\u201d (I think I\u2019d heard Buffy say that? I\u2019m probably wrong)</p><p>He said, \u201cHey, someone\u2019s been learning from Buffy!\u201d with that darned smirk of his. Ugh, he\u2019s so cute! </p><p>My heart was still beating like a hummingbird as he walked out of the court, but it was now or never (unintentional High School Musical 3 reference, I\u2019m so funny). When he stopped and turned around, ready to play, I said, \u201cTeej, wait! Look at the ball,\u201d (I was just hyperventilating at this point.) He looked down and his eyes got so wide I thought he was going to pass out from the shock! Then, he started RUNNING AWAY (to the bench). Me, being me, shouted something like, \u201cWait, TJ, I just thought that since we said all that stuff to each other the other day maybe you\u2019d want to go with me! I shouldn\u2019t have jumped the gun, I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d Meanwhile, TJ is still rummaging through his sports bag, trying to find who-knows-what. He shouts back, \u201cNo, Cyrus, wait!\u201d still searching his bag. </p><p>AND THEN! He pulls out a chocolate chocolate chip muffin (he knows that\u2019s my favourite) wrapped in cling film, and a sort of crumpled up poster (which he\u2019s still trying to unfold). I was extremely confused at this point because I never, in a MILLION YEARS, thought the poster would say, \u201cMuffin would make me happier than going to the prom with you\u201d, while TJ stands there, looking RIGHT into my eyes. </p><p>Obviously, I\u2019m a bit dumb and was, as the kids say, shook. I also chose this incredible moment to let my impishness get the better of me. I took the muffin and unwrapped it, not saying a word. I even took a BITE out of the muffin before saying, \u201cI\u2019ll have to think about it,\u201d Honestly, it took ALL my (two) brain cells to stop myself from grinning like a crazy person. But apparently, I\u2019m not as dumb as I thought I was because TJ thought I was being serious when I said that, and started rolling up his poster, looking like he was about to CRY! He started muttering something like, \u201cOh, yeah! That\u2019s cool, take your time, no problem!\u201d </p><p>He had stuffed half the poster in his bag before I could grab his wrist and say, \u201cTeej, I\u2019m joking. I literally learnt how to throw the ball in the thing for this. I want to go with you.\u201d</p><p>TJ stared at me for a few seconds and said, \u201cOh,\u201d smiling like the adorable idiot he is. </p><p>And, yeah! So, I guess I\u2019m going to the prom with TJ! Oh, no, what am I going to wear? I hope I don\u2019t smell bad. TJ smells like HEAVEN, I don\u2019t want to smell like garbage in front of HIM!

The sounds of children playing in the park floated through the\nair to where they were sitting under the tree. Well, TJ was sitting and Cyrus\nwas lying down. The birds were chirping happily and the sunlight falling on TJ\nmade his hair seem golden from his point of view. </p><p>\u201cOh, the many times you have told me since last week\ncertainly didn\u2019t make that clear.\u201d</p><p>That response made TJ stop carding his fingers through Cyrus\u2019\nhair, settling for lightly pushing him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious, Underdog!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Teej,\u201d Cyrus said, sitting up properly. \u201cI love you\ntoo.\u201d</p><p>TJ\u2019s face lit up in a soft smile, as he moved his hand down\nto the back of Cyrus\u2019 neck, pulling him in for a soft kiss. Pulling apart, they\njust sat in silence for a while, their foreheads resting upon each other, their\nnoses touching. </p><p>Cyrus moved away, much to TJ\u2019s disappointment, and marked\nhis place in his book. \u201cHow\u2019s practice been these days?\u201d</p><p>TJ sighed. \u201cFine. Everyone\u2019s really worked up about the\nFinals day after. I\u2019m trying to be encouraging, but I\u2019m actually really\nworried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Cyrus said, putting his hand on TJ\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m\nsure you guys will win. I believe in you.\u201d</p><p>TJ smiled back at Cyrus, worry still evident in his eyes. He\ncovered Cyrus\u2019 hand on his shoulder with his own, giving it a grateful squeeze.\n\u201cThank you, Cyrus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides, I\u2019ll be right there, cheering for you through it\nall!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know how much that would help,\u201d TJ laughed.</p><p>\u201cWait, why?\u201d Cyrus asked, concerned.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re incredibly distracting!\u201d </p><p>Cyrus pushed TJ away, feigning offence. \u201cOh, really? Fine, I\nwon\u2019t be there then!\u201d he said, crossing his arms.</p><p>TJ just chuckled, pulling Cyrus close to him. \u201cNo, wait! I\ntake it back. Please be there?\u201d he asked, pouting.</p><p>Cyrus lasted all of 2 seconds with his act before he caved\nand smiled, snaking his arms around TJ\u2019s neck. \u201cGoddamn it, you can\u2019t just put\nlike that and expect me to be okay!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I say, Muffin? I only have one weapon in my\narsenal when it comes to you,\u201d TJ whispered, bumping their noses together,\nmaking Cyrus giggle. He pulled TJ in for another kiss.</p><p>\u201cOkay, as fun as this is, I\u2019m really hungry right now. What\ndid you get?\u201d TJ asked, pulling away to look in the basket Cyrus got with him. <i>Basket,\nwow. His boyfriend was extra. And he loved it.</i></p><p>\u201cTake a wild guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMUFFINS!\u201d TJ said, practically yelling. He was so loud,\nsome moms turned around in surprise.</p><p>He pulled out some packets from the basket, containing both\nchocolate chocolate chip and blueberry macadamia muffins. The latter made TJ\nhold them up in confusion.</p><p>\u201cI thought you said these don\u2019t exist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they do now. Thanks to my impeccable baking skills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh god, wow. Cyrus. I knew that we have argued, but I never\nthought you would ever want to poison me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Cyrus said, smacking TJ on the head lightly. \u201cI\u2019ll\nhave you know I am an excellent baker!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m kidding, Underdog. You could literally give me dirt and\nI\u2019d eat it,\u201d TJ said, taking a bite of the muffin. At first, he faked happiness\nuntil his expression morphed into one of genuine enjoyment.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, Cyrus. Holy mother of- this is incredible!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold you,\u201d Cyrus said, pride thrilling through his heart.\nWell, pride at his baking and just love for the boy sitting next to him.</p><p>\u201cWho knew you were a secret Rosanna Pansino?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus shrugged, leaning back against the tree, taking\nanother muffin offered to him by TJ.</p><p>Everything was peaceful.</p><p>*</p><p>A couple hours later, the two boys were lying down again, in\nopposite directions. Cyrus had resumed reading his book, and TJ was busy making\ndaisy chains, even arranging some in Cyrus\u2019 hair. They always had these\ncomfortable silences, the ones where the two didn\u2019t feel the need to speak.\nThey just enjoyed the other\u2019s presence, basking in the warmth that came.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus turned to face TJ. He was upside down to Cyrus, but\nsomehow he still managed to take his breath away. At that proximity, he was\nable to count all the freckles on TJ\u2019s face if he wanted to. </p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>TJ reached out and stroked Cyrus\u2019 cheek, pulling him in for\na kiss. They pulled away, faces still close together. TJ whispered, \u201cI\u2019m so\nlucky to have met you.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus opened his eyes to look at TJ. But for the first time\nthat day, he saw TJ look hesitant. </p><p>TJ continued. \u201cThe first time I met you, that day in the cafeteria.\nI went there with the intent to just get Buffy to tutor me, but as soon as I\nsaw you, something changed. Suddenly, I just wanted to help you with anything.\nI immediately decided that come what may, I won\u2019t let anyone hurt you. I don\u2019t\neven know why. We didn\u2019t even know each other. But I wanted to get to know you.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus stayed silent, curious to hear what TJ wanted to say.</p><p>\u201cThen, when we talked at the swings for the first time, I\ncouldn\u2019t bother to put on my \u2018mean guy\u2019 mask around you. I just wanted to pour\nmy heart to you. That was the first time I had felt completely free and happy\nin a long time. And it was thanks to you.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus smiled fondly at the memory. He couldn\u2019t have imagined\nback then what that one conversation would mean down the line.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want anyone to hurt you. But then, I\u2019m the one who\nended up doing that so many times.\u201d</p><p>At this point, Cyrus tried to cut TJ off. \u201cTJ, you didn\u2019t-\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you gave me second chances, helped me change. I can\u2019t\never thank you enough for that, Cyrus.\u201d</p><p>For the first time since he started speaking, TJ looked\nCyrus in the eyes. His eyes seemed watery as if he was going to cry any\nminute. Cyrus reached over, cupping his hand over TJ\u2019s cheek. TJ leaned into\nthe touch, almost nuzzling his hand.</p><p>\u201cI love you so much, Cyrus. I need you to know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too, TJ,\u201d Cyrus replied, rubbing their noses together.\n\u201cBut why are you acting like this? You\u2019re scaring me a bit.\u201d</p><p>At this, TJ sat up, trying his best to avoid Cyrus\u2019 eyes.\nCyrus, too, sat up, now worried. \u201cTJ?\u201d he asked, concerned.</p><p>\u201cI need to tell you something.\u201d</p><p>Something about the way he said those words sent fear into\nCyrus\u2019 heart. He put his arms around TJ\u2019s shoulders, holding him so that their faces\nwere right in front of each other. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m moving.\u201d</p><p><i>Oh.</i> Cyrus\u2019 heart plummeted, and he loosened his grip\nover TJ\u2019s shoulders. Tears began to prick at his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Cyrus,\u201d TJ whispered, his voice cracking. </p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t. You can\u2019t be moving!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d TJ said, grabbing Cyrus\u2019 hand, squeezing it. \u201cIt\u2019ll\nbe okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if it isn\u2019t, TJ? What if we don\u2019t remain okay after\nsome time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will be,\u201d TJ said, tears now streaming down his face. \u201cWe\nhave to be.\u201d</p><p>He pulled Cyrus to him, their foreheads touching, their eyes\nclosed. They savoured that moment, despair wrapping them in its icy hold.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t the end, Cyrus. I will always love you. No\nmatter what,\u201d TJ said, his voice shaky but determined.</p><p>Cyrus looked TJ in the eye, tears now staining his cheeks. \u201cAnd\nI will always love you.\u201d</p><p>They leaned for a kiss, more desperate than before. Neither\nwanted to pull away, but eventually, they had to, gasping for air.</p><p>\u201cWhen do you leave?\u201d Cyrus asked, scared of the answer.</p><p>\u201cIn 4 days, after the basketball game is done.\u201d</p><p><i>They didn\u2019t have very long.</i></p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d TJ whispered, holding up Cyrus\u2019 chin. \u201cWe\u2019ll be okay.\nYou and me, we always find our way back to each other. We\u2019ll do it again.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus laughed weakly, holding onto TJ\u2019s hand. \u201cYeah, we\nwill.\u201d</p><p>They stayed like that for what felt like an eternity, what\nfelt like a few seconds. In the dying light of day, TJ whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t forget\nabout me, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d </p><p>~~~~~~</p><p><b>I\u2019m sorry.</b>\u00a0</p>",

Fine, I\nwon\u2019t be there then!\u201d he said, crossing his arms.</p><p>TJ just chuckled, pulling Cyrus close to him. \u201cNo, wait! I\ntake it back. Please be there?\u201d he asked, pouting.</p><p>Cyrus lasted all of 2 seconds with his act before he caved\nand smiled, snaking his arms around TJ\u2019s neck. \u201cGoddamn it, you can\u2019t just put\nlike that and expect me to be okay!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I say, Muffin? I only have one weapon in my\narsenal when it comes to you,\u201d TJ whispered, bumping their noses together,\nmaking Cyrus giggle. He pulled TJ in for another kiss.</p><p>\u201cOkay, as fun as this is, I\u2019m really hungry right now. What\ndid you get?\u201d TJ asked, pulling away to look in the basket Cyrus got with him. <i>Basket,\nwow. His boyfriend was extra. And he loved it.</i></p><p>\u201cTake a wild guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMUFFINS!\u201d TJ said, practically yelling. He was so loud,\nsome moms turned around in surprise.</p><p>He pulled out some packets from the basket, containing both\nchocolate chocolate chip and blueberry macadamia muffins. The latter made TJ\nhold them up in confusion.</p><p>\u201cI thought you said these don\u2019t exist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they do now. Thanks to my impeccable baking skills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh god, wow. Cyrus. I knew that we have argued, but I never\nthought you would ever want to poison me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Cyrus said, smacking TJ on the head lightly. \u201cI\u2019ll\nhave you know I am an excellent baker!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m kidding, Underdog. You could literally give me dirt and\nI\u2019d eat it,\u201d TJ said, taking a bite of the muffin. At first, he faked happiness\nuntil his expression morphed into one of genuine enjoyment.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, Cyrus. Holy mother of- this is incredible!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold you,\u201d Cyrus said, pride thrilling through his heart.\nWell, pride at his baking and just love for the boy sitting next to him.</p><p>\u201cWho knew you were a secret Rosanna Pansino?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus shrugged, leaning back against the tree, taking\nanother muffin offered to him by TJ.</p><p>Everything was peaceful.</p><p>*</p><p>A couple hours later, the two boys were lying down again, in\nopposite directions. Cyrus had resumed reading his book, and TJ was busy making\ndaisy chains, even arranging some in Cyrus\u2019 hair. They always had these\ncomfortable silences, the ones where the two didn\u2019t feel the need to speak.\nThey just enjoyed the other\u2019s presence, basking in the warmth that came.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus turned to face TJ. He was upside down to Cyrus, but\nsomehow he still managed to take his breath away. At that proximity, he was\nable to count all the freckles on TJ\u2019s face if he wanted to. </p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>TJ reached out and stroked Cyrus\u2019 cheek, pulling him in for\na kiss. They pulled away, faces still close together. TJ whispered, \u201cI\u2019m so\nlucky to have met you.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus opened his eyes to look at TJ. But for the first time\nthat day, he saw TJ look hesitant. </p><p>TJ continued. \u201cThe first time I met you, that day in the cafeteria.\nI went there with the intent to just get Buffy to tutor me, but as soon as I\nsaw you, something changed. Suddenly, I just wanted to help you with anything.\nI immediately decided that come what may, I won\u2019t let anyone hurt you. I don\u2019t\neven know why. We didn\u2019t even know each other. But I wanted to get to know you.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus stayed silent, curious to hear what TJ wanted to say.</p><p>\u201cThen, when we talked at the swings for the first time, I\ncouldn\u2019t bother to put on my \u2018mean guy\u2019 mask around you. I just wanted to pour\nmy heart to you. That was the first time I had felt completely free and happy\nin a long time. And it was thanks to you.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus smiled fondly at the memory. He couldn\u2019t have imagined\nback then what that one conversation would mean down the line.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want anyone to hurt you. But then, I\u2019m the one who\nended up doing that so many times.\u201d</p><p>At this point, Cyrus tried to cut TJ off. \u201cTJ, you didn\u2019t-\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you gave me second chances, helped me change. I can\u2019t\never thank you enough for that, Cyrus.\u201d</p><p>For the first time since he started speaking, TJ looked\nCyrus in the eyes. His eyes seemed watery as if he was going to cry any\nminute. Cyrus reached over, cupping his hand over TJ\u2019s cheek. TJ leaned into\nthe touch, almost nuzzling his hand.</p><p>\u201cI love you so much, Cyrus. I need you to know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too, TJ,\u201d Cyrus replied, rubbing their noses together.\n\u201cBut why are you acting like this? You\u2019re scaring me a bit.\u201d</p><p>At this, TJ sat up, trying his best to avoid Cyrus\u2019 eyes.\nCyrus, too, sat up, now worried. \u201cTJ?\u201d he asked, concerned.</p><p>\u201cI need to tell you something.\u201d</p><p>Something about the way he said those words sent fear into\nCyrus\u2019 heart. He put his arms around TJ\u2019s shoulders, holding him so that their faces\nwere right in front of each other. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m moving.\u201d</p><p><i>Oh.</i> Cyrus\u2019 heart plummeted, and he loosened his grip\nover TJ\u2019s shoulders. Tears began to prick at his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Cyrus,\u201d TJ whispered, his voice cracking. </p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t. You can\u2019t be moving!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d TJ said, grabbing Cyrus\u2019 hand, squeezing it. \u201cIt\u2019ll\nbe okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if it isn\u2019t, TJ? What if we don\u2019t remain okay after\nsome time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will be,\u201d TJ said, tears now streaming down his face. \u201cWe\nhave to be.\u201d</p><p>He pulled Cyrus to him, their foreheads touching, their eyes\nclosed. They savoured that moment, despair wrapping them in its icy hold.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t the end, Cyrus. I will always love you. No\nmatter what,\u201d TJ said, his voice shaky but determined.</p><p>Cyrus looked TJ in the eye, tears now staining his cheeks. \u201cAnd\nI will always love you.\u201d</p><p>They leaned for a kiss, more desperate than before. Neither\nwanted to pull away, but eventually, they had to, gasping for air.</p><p>\u201cWhen do you leave?\u201d Cyrus asked, scared of the answer.</p><p>\u201cIn 4 days, after the basketball game is done.\u201d</p><p><i>They didn\u2019t have very long.</i></p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d TJ whispered, holding up Cyrus\u2019 chin. \u201cWe\u2019ll be okay.\nYou and me, we always find our way back to each other. We\u2019ll do it again.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus laughed weakly, holding onto TJ\u2019s hand. \u201cYeah, we\nwill.\u201d</p><p>They stayed like that for what felt like an eternity, what\nfelt like a few seconds. In the dying light of day, TJ whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t forget\nabout me, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d </p><p>~~~~~~</p><p><b>I\u2019m sorry.</b>\u00a0</p>",

The sounds of children playing in the park floated through the\nair to where they were sitting under the tree. Well, TJ was sitting and Cyrus\nwas lying down. The birds were chirping happily and the sunlight falling on TJ\nmade his hair seem golden from his point of view. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, the many times you have told me since last week\ncertainly didn&rsquo;t make that clear.&rdquo;</p><p>That response made TJ stop carding his fingers through Cyrus&rsquo;\nhair, settling for lightly pushing him.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m serious, Underdog!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know, Teej,&rdquo; Cyrus said, sitting up properly. &ldquo;I love you\ntoo.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ&rsquo;s face lit up in a soft smile, as he moved his hand down\nto the back of Cyrus&rsquo; neck, pulling him in for a soft kiss. Pulling apart, they\njust sat in silence for a while, their foreheads resting upon each other, their\nnoses touching. </p><p>Cyrus moved away, much to TJ&rsquo;s disappointment, and marked\nhis place in his book. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s practice been these days?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ sighed. &ldquo;Fine.
