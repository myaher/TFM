            "description": "Hmm I pretty much just like anything!~ First off I'm 27 years old so if you want to know how old I am you can read my intro. ~~~ I'm an optimistic and cynical person when I want to be but over all I am an enthusiastic person! I like to support people and help out as much as I can! I also like to play along in Role Play and Cosplay~! I don't don't believe in YOLO but I do want to have a happy, fun life and not waste it on people who are trying to do more harm then good for me just because they can't get over shit.\nI do not like to pity people because it is a waste of time. People say 'Do not pity me' usually wants to be pitied so they can take advantage of your kindness and I should know because it happened to me. So don't ever pity or feel sorry for someone just offer your help but don't do everything for them or you will waste a lot of time.\nBasically \"Teach a man how to fish and grow crops and he will never grow hungry but if you give a man fish and crops he expect that from you forever and use you until you have nothing because he stole your damn wallet!\" \nIf I like something a lot I might just draw it. If I read something and like it a lot I might just turn it into a comic/manga. But that is if I like it and if you are willing to help out with details so I can put it in drawing.\nPrecious life lessons. So many to share!\nAnother thing about me is that I like to 'like' a lot of stuff. If I can go back in time to the first thing you post I would like it! I'm not trying to spam you I just 'like' things. It's alright to like things but if I am spamming you to much please feel free to tell me and I'll stop. I know what I like and how I like it because in reality I'm a real bitch in real life so feel honoured that I liked your stuff because I will point out any mistakes you make(if I see any mistakes). I'm not perfect myself but I try and do my best to self improve and I can help you to if you like! and if I make a mistake with my drawing PLEASE tell me I want to get better at my own skills. Drawing helps me relax.",

Why you getting all hot headed?\u201d He teased and you growled. Honestly this guy can be a real asshole and you just meet him. </p><p>\u201cWell not in here you dick go change somewhere else!\u201d You said and Bakugo laughed before he walked out of the room. </p><p>\u201cAlright Miss tour guide whatever you say.\u201d </p><p>You huffed and grabbed your clipboard and pen before pulling your hair back into a low ponytail. You sighed and looked at yourself in the mirror they had in the office. </p><p>Leggings and a white nationals t-shirt, perfect you looked cute if you had to say yourself. You always were one to wear sports clothes. They were comfortable and when your coach asks you to join them on the activity it was easy for you not to worry about your outfit. </p><p>You hummed and grabbed your things and you saw Bakugo waiting for you outside the office. He was leaning against the wall and his eyes were close until you walked past him and he opened one of them to follow you. </p><p>\u201cAlright so we\u2019re playing volleyball match style so you\u2019ll probably be put in a small team and depending on what coach does he\u2019ll probably put me with you to make it even.\u201d You spoke and opened the door to the gym. </p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll be playing on a team with me? With the guys?\u201d He asked his time holding somewhat of a \u2018are you serious\u2019 hint to it. You rolled your eyes. </p><p>\u201cYeah? Coach normally lets me play with the guys. Why, don\u2019t think a girl can do it?\u201d </p><p>Bakugo snort \u201cNo it\u2019s just unexpected I mean I bet they crush you at the sport so no need to worry about that.\u201d He laughed and you smirked </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so quick to judge Katsuki you might get cold foot here. Just keep in mind that you\u2019re in our school. We play things a little different then in Japan.\u201d You sassed back and Bakugo whistled. Damn you were feisty and quick witted. Bakugo smirked and watch you walk over to your coach and he had to chuckled to himself. </p><p>You were definitely different then all these other foreigners here and he was starting to like it. </p><h2><span class=\"npf_color_monica\"><b>CONTINUE?</b></span></h2>",

You sighed and looked at yourself in the mirror they had in the office. </p><p>Leggings and a white nationals t-shirt, perfect you looked cute if you had to say yourself. You always were one to wear sports clothes. They were comfortable and when your coach asks you to join them on the activity it was easy for you not to worry about your outfit. </p><p>You hummed and grabbed your things and you saw Bakugo waiting for you outside the office. He was leaning against the wall and his eyes were close until you walked past him and he opened one of them to follow you. </p><p>\u201cAlright so we\u2019re playing volleyball match style so you\u2019ll probably be put in a small team and depending on what coach does he\u2019ll probably put me with you to make it even.\u201d You spoke and opened the door to the gym. </p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll be playing on a team with me? With the guys?\u201d He asked his time holding somewhat of a \u2018are you serious\u2019 hint to it. You rolled your eyes. </p><p>\u201cYeah? Coach normally lets me play with the guys. Why, don\u2019t think a girl can do it?\u201d </p><p>Bakugo snort \u201cNo it\u2019s just unexpected I mean I bet they crush you at the sport so no need to worry about that.\u201d He laughed and you smirked </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so quick to judge Katsuki you might get cold foot here. Just keep in mind that you\u2019re in our school. We play things a little different then in Japan.\u201d You sassed back and Bakugo whistled. Damn you were feisty and quick witted. Bakugo smirked and watch you walk over to your coach and he had to chuckled to himself. </p><p>You were definitely different then all these other foreigners here and he was starting to like it. </p><h2><span class=\"npf_color_monica\"><b>CONTINUE?</b></span></h2></p>",
