        "answer": "<p><b>author\u2019s note: </b>thanks so much for this, anon! sorry it took so long, I\u2019ve been snowed under with exam stress and then celebrations etc, but I knew I wanted to come back to my inbox at some point and start working through my prompts/asks again. what a wonderful prompt! hope you enjoy my little work based on it :)</p><!-- more --><p>-it\u2019s unusual, to say the least.\u00a0</p><p>-she\u2019s not who she was. she\u2019s far from that little girl, the weepy child who loved her dolls and sewing and the brutal prince Joffrey. she hardly has time to feel now, as sad as that sounds, because she has the North to rule. to honour her father, and all before him, she knows she has to focus all of her attention on this.</p><p>-yet, now, here she is, confined in her quarters just after dusk, weeping her heart out. her auburn locks have been removed from their braids, now tumbling over her shoulders and past her breast, pooling in her lap as she hunches over, as though the grief were a visceral pain that knifed her.</p><p>-she thinks of him. he who had been the only one she could trust, all those years ago, in King\u2019s Landing. he who had thrust the cloak into her hands, gruffly demanded that she do as Joffrey say. he whose heart was too big for his body, whose capacity for kindness shocked and frightened even him. he who had tried so hard to make her hate him, but had in turn done the exact opposite.</p><p>-her eyes feel sore. she has no way of knowing just how long she\u2019s been crying for, but it\u2019s long enough that she can feel herself drying up, wrinkling like an old lady. she feels nauseous but can\u2019t stop the wailing sounds she makes, only able to mute them to the point where nobody would grow concerned for her. she can\u2019t have her men and women believing something is wrong; they\u2019ve dealt with hysteria for far too long now.</p><p>-she knows the news is true, because she heard it from Arya herself. before she sailed west, she broke the news to Sansa, who managed to maintain a cool exterior for the longest time. she told her sister that she was sad to hear it, but that it must have been a worthy cause. she understood how much it meant to him, to finally get revenge on his brother for what he did to him and to the whole of Westeros, and even in her grief she knows that, wherever he is now, he\u2019s content.</p><p>-knowing this does not eradicate the pain, however. in fact, the more she learns about the circumstances, she grows angrier. angry at him, in a sense, because if he had stayed with her, things could have been so much more different. perhaps they could be together, finally, and one day they could even live to see the birds sing once more.\u00a0</p><p>-this grudge lasted next to no time, however. she couldn\u2019t stay angry at him, not when there were so many other worse villains to think of. she loathed the Mountain, most of all. she despised Cersei, and she suspected she would spend the rest of her days wishing she were the one to finally kill the spoiled queen.\u00a0</p><p>-there was even some part of her that held disdain for herself. had she acted sooner, told him the truth sooner, he may have changed his mind. she could not say that he returned her feelings, but she could have impacted him somehow, in some way, and perhaps she could have saved him.</p><p>-as she cradles her own waist, desperate to feel less alone, she can almost feel his soft touch on her back. his hands run down her sides, then one arm extends to tug her closer to him. she falls hard against his chest, and she can feel the delightfully relieving rising and falling of his breast, feel the beating of his heart and hear him whispering softly to her.</p><p>-suddenly, though, he\u2019s gone. as he had been taken from her in life, in her hallucination he dissipates into the surroundings before she can get a single word out, and this makes her weep more. she weeps for her loss - their loss, of a future together, of a real love, one like Westeros only sees as often as it sees dragons. she misses him gravely, and she\u2019ll never get him back.</p><p>-in an instant, however, she\u2019s forced to sit back up, ears perked as she listens intently. from outside, in the blackness of the night, sounds a horn. she imagines it\u2019s the nightwatchmen, who guard the walls and wait for the rare disturbances. the horn sounds once, then twice, and this is all she needs before she\u2019s up, wiping away her tears and rushing from her room to see what\u2019s happened.\u00a0</p><p>-the cold is still bitter. it claws at her as she leaves the warmth of her room, and she\u2019s tempted for only a second to turn back, as though her people don\u2019t really need her. she ignores this thought, thinking it very \n\nplebeian, and instead tightens the wrap of her nightdress around her.\u00a0</p><p>-\u201dwhat is it?\u201d she asks the first guard she finds, seeing the shock on his face as she engages him as though they were equals,\u00a0\u201cwhat\u2019s happening?\u201d</p><p>-\u201dI-\u201d the way he pauses makes her briefly worry that they\u2019re under siege, and she wishes he\u2019d hurry up to give them more time to act if this is the case, but she does not rush him.\u00a0\u201cit\u2019s him, your grace. he\u2019s back.\u201d</p><p>-looking like he\u2019s seen a ghost, Sansa knows this news can\u2019t mean anything good. she does not press him for more information, for times or names or any of it, instead slipping gracefully past him to look for herself. there\u2019s a sudden gust of wind which blows her long hair into her face, and forces her to sacrifice the vice-like grip she has on her dress to fix it, enabling her to see once more. when she looks on at the gates, vision newly cleared, she\u2019s flung into a fit of denial.</p><p>-there, entering the city on the back of a white steed, is him. Sandor, looking dishevelled and bloodied and dirty, tired and beyond irked, is entering Winterfell again, like she never thought she\u2019d see. only in her dreams has she witnessed this and, though he looks exhausted and the lot, she doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s ever looked better, at least not to her.</p><p>-his eyes remain on the ground for the most part. he must be able to feel the gazes of the people who have given up sleep to bear witness to his resurrection, must know how unexpected this return is, but he doesn\u2019t show anything. his cool outer shell does not break, not when he first arrives, only when he dares to look up and, completely by chance, meets Sansa\u2019s gaze.</p><p>-she knows she must look foolish. she can\u2019t look regal, with her eyes so wide and skin so red and blotchy, but she figures he\u2019ll look past that because <i>he\u2019s alive. </i>thank the old gods and the new, whoever brought him back or any great chance that saved him, because this is the only thing she\u2019s dared to wish for since her father\u2019s beheading, and now she\u2019s got it; she\u2019s got him.</p><p>-as they look on at each other, his horse coming to a stop, she knows she has to keep up appearances, at least for now. as the Queen in the North, she\u2019ll have to welcome him, to do the rest, to pretend like he hasn\u2019t saved her and her family a hundred thousand times over, like she doesn\u2019t love him with every fibre of her being. like she doesn\u2019t know this is the riskiest admission, like everything is fine and dandy.</p><p>-as she readies herself to go forth and meet him, she stops only a moment to listen. it\u2019s instinctual, at first. to begin with it\u2019s not her choice, because a sweet, melodic sound begins in her ears, and she can\u2019t ignore it, no matter how hard she tries.\u00a0</p><p>-there, she looks to her right and sees the source, is a small, black bird singing its heart out. she wonders briefly how it doesn\u2019t run out of breath, for it continues without pause for some time, but she does not question it. now, she smiles to herself, she thinks she understands it, at least just a little more than she did mere moments ago.</p>",

Sandor, looking dishevelled and bloodied and dirty, tired and beyond irked, is entering Winterfell again, like she never thought she\u2019d see. only in her dreams has she witnessed this and, though he looks exhausted and the lot, she doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s ever looked better, at least not to her.</p><p>-his eyes remain on the ground for the most part. he must be able to feel the gazes of the people who have given up sleep to bear witness to his resurrection, must know how unexpected this return is, but he doesn\u2019t show anything. his cool outer shell does not break, not when he first arrives, only when he dares to look up and, completely by chance, meets Sansa\u2019s gaze.</p><p>-she knows she must look foolish. she can\u2019t look regal, with her eyes so wide and skin so red and blotchy, but she figures he\u2019ll look past that because <i>he\u2019s alive. </i>thank the old gods and the new, whoever brought him back or any great chance that saved him, because this is the only thing she\u2019s dared to wish for since her father\u2019s beheading, and now she\u2019s got it; she\u2019s got him.</p><p>-as they look on at each other, his horse coming to a stop, she knows she has to keep up appearances, at least for now. as the Queen in the North, she\u2019ll have to welcome him, to do the rest, to pretend like he hasn\u2019t saved her and her family a hundred thousand times over, like she doesn\u2019t love him with every fibre of her being. like she doesn\u2019t know this is the riskiest admission, like everything is fine and dandy.</p><p>-as she readies herself to go forth and meet him, she stops only a moment to listen. it\u2019s instinctual, at first. to begin with it\u2019s not her choice, because a sweet, melodic sound begins in her ears, and she can\u2019t ignore it, no matter how hard she tries.\u00a0</p><p>-there, she looks to her right and sees the source, is a small, black bird singing its heart out. she wonders briefly how it doesn\u2019t run out of breath, for it continues without pause for some time, but she does not question it. now, she smiles to herself, she thinks she understands it, at least just a little more than she did mere moments ago.</p>",

She was just as much a Queen here as she was in Winterfell and even the men of the Night\u2019s Watch, known to be thieves and outcasts, seemed to respect everything she had accomplished and the fact that she had managed to keep Jon alive after he had killed the Dragon Queen. \u201cYou know they will never do that.\u201d </p><p>He might have accepted that he was no longer a King or a Lord or a Knight, but his people, her people, their people had not. He had been the one commanding their army against the Night King. He had been the one leading their troops south to kill Cersei Lannister. He had also been the one ending the tyranny of Daenerys Targaryen, even though he was surrounded by those loyal to her, including her dragon. No matter how much he wanted it, not even when he ordered them to, would they see and treat him as their equal. </p><p>Westeros might have stripped him of all titles, but not even Westeros could erase everything he had done for the Kingdom and especially the North.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not allowed to carry a title.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet.\u201d Sansa hissed between her teeth. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of time before Bran tells us that Daenerys\u2019 allies have left Westeros or have stopped caring.\u201d She lifted her chin a little and straightened her back. \u201cApart from that, the North is an independent Kingdom and the laws of the Six Kingdoms and their punishments can be overruled by its Queen.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cI don\u2019t want to risk another war, even though I don\u2019t doubt we will win it, but the Northerners and I can give you every title and all honour you deserve.\u201d </p><p>Jon smiled, but he shook his head and reached for her hand. \u201cSansa\u2026\u201d He spoke softly. \u201cI know that Tyrion presented it as a punishment. That\u2019s what Grey Worm had to believe, else he wouldn\u2019t have let me go alive.\u201d The tips of his fingers, slightly rough after spending so much time in the burning cold, rubbed her knuckles. \u201cBut the only part of the punishment that really is one, is the part that keeps me away from you.\u201d Every word was sincere. \u201cI never wanted to rule people or command armies. I\u2019m fine being a bastard, banished, but free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a bastard, Jon.\u201d Sansa shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019ve never been and you\u2019ll never be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve talked about this.\u201d Jon leaned a little closer towards her, even though that was barely possible. \u201cI don\u2019t want any of it. I just want a calm life, Ghost somewhere near and you.\u201d He lifted his hand up and touched her cheek.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t realised that a few tears had escaped her watering eyes. \u201cWill you even come back home if Bran tells us that you can return without risking countless of lives?\u201d After all, that was the future she had been holding onto, the promise that had kept her going. She could rule the North and be their Queen, as long as she knew that one day Jon would come home again to be with her. </p><p>He was the only one she would ever allow to father her children, the heirs the North so desperately needed now Bran was ruling the Six Kingdoms and Jon and Arya were so far way from Winterfell. </p><p>But she didn\u2019t want to travel all the way here for the rest of her life to see him. And she didn\u2019t want to say goodbye after only a few weeks every time he would travel south. She couldn\u2019t do that. She didn\u2019t want that. That was not the happily ever after she was promised after everything she had been through and everything she had fought for.</p><p>\u201cI already told you, Sansa.\u201d Jon squeezed her hand assuringly. \u201cI will be your husband one day and the father of your children and I will help you raise those children to become King or Queen themselves one day.\u201d He let her hand go. \u201cBut as just Jon.
