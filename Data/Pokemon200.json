        "body": "<p>Alex walked around his dorm room\nremembering that story. There wasn\u2019t really very much room to walk around in\nsince his dorm room wasn\u2019t really that big, but he didn\u2019t mind. The room was\nbig enough to fit a full-sized bed, a small desk, a small bookshelf that held\nsome of his textbook and personal books and Knick knacks he brought from home\nand a small fire-proof bed for Igneel (since sometimes he burned everything he\ntouched) and a food and water bowl. Alex turned on the small mobile near\nIgneel\u2019s bed with three Pokeballs he bought for the lizard to play with and\nwatched as the Charmander chased the Pokeballs around in a circle giggling and\ntripping as it chased the mobile. What was this Charmander destined to become?\nHis parents even after entrusting Igneel to him, still didn\u2019t tell him what the\nsecret behind what they were studying about him or why they even created and\nspent so much time on him. Was he really going to be something? Igneel wasn\u2019t\nreally the easiest to train, and the thing his parents had foretold about this\ngolden lizard sounded more like just stories than the truth the more and more\nhe thought about what he had to endure. He remembered training it to not burn\neverything with its tail, Arceus that was painful\u2026</p><p>He remembered someone else was in\nhis dorm room and quickly refocused on Bethany. She was sitting on his bed, a\nbig smile across her face as she was reading through his secret notebook he had\nhidden behind one of his bookshelves. Clearly, she was clever and must have\nbeen searching the whole time he was playing with Igneel and had spaced out. He\nneeded to make sure he kept an eye on her. He quickly grabbed the small black\nnotebook from her hands, </p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t read that,\u201d he said\nblushing.</p><p>\u201cAww come on! I wasn\u2019t finished\nreading about the legend of <i>The Great Pok\u00e9mon\nMaster Alex</i>!\u201d She said in a teasing but slightly a little too interested\ntone.</p><p>They sat on his bed and looked at\neach for a while. He felt something different with her. Something warm and\ncomforting. If she wasn\u2019t just a girl he met in the library literally a few\nhours ago maybe he would see it as something more. But not yet. </p><p>He stuck out his tongue, his face\nbeet red, and mimicked her tone from earlier, \u201cMaybe later.\u201d</p><p>She puckered her face, \u201cFine,\u201d She\nfell back into the bed and sighed loudly pretending she lost, \u201cwhat do we do\nnext, its only like 1?\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow, \u201cShow me your\nstarting Pok\u00e9mon?\u201d</p><p>He could see that her eyes narrowed\nfrom the question, \u201cI left her back at my dorm and I don\u2019t have her stats on my\nphone\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell let\u2019s go to your-</p><p>\u201cNO!\u201d She jumped up from his bed\nand her eyes bugged out, making her blush and look away again, \u201cYou\u2019ll make fun\nof me, it\u2019s kind of messy\u2026\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 </p><p>He felt like that was code for she\nwasn\u2019t ready to showcase her Pok\u00e9mon to him.
