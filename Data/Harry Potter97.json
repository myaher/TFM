You felt at peace when it snowed, it looked so angelic outside, you couldn\u2019t help but leave, a perfect looking trail of footprints to Hagrid\u2019s hut and beyond.</p><p>Everything was perfect, as your Slytherin robes, gladly hid any sign of you being out past curfew. Your cat pranced in the snow behind you, rolling and sprinting around.You giggle as your black fluffy cat, looked up at you with his gorgeous gold eyes.\u201dHow\u2019s it going, Treasure.\u201d You murmured to your cat, and he began to happily prance again.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing out past curfew?\u201d Asked an all to familiar voice, Draco Malfoy. You turned your head, as he looked around and rushed over to you, pulling on your arm.\u201dAre you wanting to get bloody caught.\u201d He hissed in your face and you raised a brow.\u201dI never get caught, Malfoy.\u201d You hissed back.<br/></p><p>You and Draco, aren\u2019t really buddy buddy, but he always seemed to appear everywhere you went, like he was following you. You started to brighten up at the idea of Draco following you, but you always pushed that feeling or what ever it was, to the back of your mind. You also started sitting with him at lunch, and hanging with him on your free time.</p><p>He snorted, looking you straight in the face.\u201dWell then, why are you out in the middle of Hogwarts, in the most noticeable spot.\u201d He lowly glowered at you, and you rolled your eyes.\u201dI will do what I want, when I want, and where I wnat to do it,\u00a0<i>Malfoy</i> and there\u2019s nothing you can do.to.stop.me.\u201d You snarled at him, that was until you heard Filch waddling down the pathway, straight to where you both were.</p><p>You pulled you hand from his and sprinted, running towards the Forbidden Forest, Draco followed you, as you both ducked behind a bush.\u201dWho\u2019s there.\u201d Filch yelled, as you focused on him, as Draco did the same. Filch shook his head, taking one look around the area, before waddling away.</p><p>You let out a long sigh, and Draco looked at you.\u201dYou almost got caught there, (Y/N)!\u201d Draco grumbled at you quietly, and you stuck out your tongue at him, which he grabbed with his pale and cold fingers.\u201dDon\u2019t stick your tongue out at me, ass.\u201d He grimaced at you, not letting go of you tongue. You pulled at his hand, then bite his finger lightly.</p><p>\u201cYou fucking bit me!\u201d He screeched quietly, and you giggled. He scrunched up his nose, in anger, and grabbed you by your wrist, pulling you closer to his face.\u201dThat wasn\u2019t very nice.\u201d He hissed, his gorgeous face becoming more soft.He shook his head and dropped your wrist, looking away from you.<br/></p><p>You pierced your lips, and poked him in the side, and his face snapped to you, his cheeks tinted pink. You smirked, and he went to grab your finger, that was about to poke him again. You pulled back, and Draco lost his balance, falling on top of you. This time you both blushed, but you were pretty sure yours were rosy red. He tried to get up, but his robe was caught in a root, and he looked at you.</p><p>Suddenly,Draco fell on top of you, and you felt something hard abruptly poke you. You blushed wildly again, and his face went totally blank.

You practically ran into the common room, tripping up to the girls dorm and quietly sneaking into bed, Treasure waiting there for you.<br/></p><hr><p>You\u2019ve been avoiding Draco for the past few weeks now, not really ready for that awkward talk between the two of you. You\u2019ve skipped classes, hung out with Harry and his friends, pulled pranks to get detention,went to bed and woke up early, going to the Great Hall early and leaving early, losing him in the crowd, anything to avoid that awkward conversation <strike>with the boy you liked.</strike>\u00a0But, this time, you couldn\u2019t find a way to avoid him.

Soon, he was chasing you, and you could see the way into the common room until-</p><p>you slipped, crashing on the ground. You groaned as you quickly got up and started sprinting towards the common room, you <i><b>really</b></i> didn\u2019t want to have that conversation now. Since you fell though, Draco was able to catch up to you, and he grabbed your arm.\u201d(Y/N).\u201d He said gently, and dragged you to the nearest empty hallway.\u00a0</p><p>He opened a door to a storage room, gently pushing you inside, and closing the door behind him. You started to get nervous, tapping your foot and fingers, as you exhaled and inhaled, you <b><i>hated</i></b> awkward conversations, actually any conversation at all. You felt him grab your shoulders and turn you towards him.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you avoiding me?\u201d He asked, and you blew up your cheeks, and crossing your arms across your chest. He looked hurt, and you had to look away, but couldn\u2019t answer.\u201d(Y/N)?\u201d He spoke, louder than before, and you looked at him.\u201dWho wouldn\u2019t want to avoid you, Malfoy.\u201d You hissed, and his eyes widened in shock, but his eyebrows soon furrowed up.</p><p>\u201dWhy would you say that, after all, before the after curfew incident, you hung around me a lot.\u201d He hissed, looking into your eyes, and you scrunched up your nose.\u201d What are you saying, Malfoy.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat I am saying is, don\u2019t avoid me.\u201d He spat looking away from you, crossing his arms, and spreading his legs open just a little. Your eyes widened in shock.\u201dAnd why would you want me to not, avoid you, Malfoy.\u201d You challenged, and he glared at you.<br/></p><p>\u201cBecause I fancy you god dammit, and call\u00a0 me Draco, not Malfoy!\u201d He yelled, and his eyes widened at what he said, but he continued to hold his ground. Your face matched his, but soon you felt yourself having the desire to kiss him, to hold him, to memorize every inch of him.\u00a0<br/></p><p>You gasped, and stumbled back in shock, what were you thinking, loving a Malfoy, a family that your family has a grudge against. You bit your lip, thinking about what your parents would do if they found out.\u00a0 You looked up at Draco, and realized it didn\u2019t matter, it was fucking Draco, a hot, misunderstood boy, who you secretly cared about, no matter how much you tried to hide it.</p><p>You jumped on him, making him bump into the wall.\u201dDamn (Y/N)-\u201d Draco started, but was cut short when your lips met his. He inhaled your scent, drowning himself in the feeling of you being attached to him. He groaned, and you smiled into the kiss, but pulled away to breath.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N).\u201d Draco growled and he flipped you over, hitting your back against the wall, making you let out a loud moan, sweet to Draco\u2019s ears. He began to feel you, kissing you with greed, as you did the same. The kiss was sloppy and full of love, that you felt addicted to it, like you wouldn\u2019t be able to stop.<br/></p><p>You pulled away letting out a small breath, and smiled at Draco, who was giving you a wicked smile. You raised a brow, and he hungrily kissed you hard, teeth meeting teeth and lips. Your fingers ran threw his beautiful white hair, as his hands went lower, grabbing your ass.</p><p>You let out a squeak, and he smirked, as his lips went along your law line and down your neck and up again.

You felt at peace when it snowed, it looked so angelic outside, you couldn&rsquo;t help but leave, a perfect looking trail of footprints to Hagrid&rsquo;s hut and beyond.</p><p>Everything was perfect, as your Slytherin robes, gladly hid any sign of you being out past curfew. Your cat pranced in the snow behind you, rolling and sprinting around.You giggle as your black fluffy cat, looked up at you with his gorgeous gold eyes.&rdquo;How&rsquo;s it going, Treasure.&rdquo; You murmured to your cat, and he began to happily prance again.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing out past curfew?&rdquo; Asked an all to familiar voice, Draco Malfoy. You turned your head, as he looked around and rushed over to you, pulling on your arm.&rdquo;Are you wanting to get bloody caught.&rdquo; He hissed in your face and you raised a brow.&rdquo;I never get caught, Malfoy.&rdquo; You hissed back.<br /></p><p>You and Draco, aren&rsquo;t really buddy buddy, but he always seemed to appear everywhere you went, like he was following you. You started to brighten up at the idea of Draco following you, but you always pushed that feeling or what ever it was, to the back of your mind. You also started sitting with him at lunch, and hanging with him on your free time.</p><p>He snorted, looking you straight in the face.&rdquo;Well then, why are you out in the middle of Hogwarts, in the most noticeable spot.&rdquo; He lowly glowered at you, and you rolled your eyes.&rdquo;I will do what I want, when I want, and where I wnat to do it,&nbsp;<i>Malfoy</i> and there&rsquo;s nothing you can do.to.stop.me.&rdquo; You snarled at him, that was until you heard Filch waddling down the pathway, straight to where you both were.</p><p>You pulled you hand from his and sprinted, running towards the Forbidden Forest, Draco followed you, as you both ducked behind a bush.&rdquo;Who&rsquo;s there.&rdquo; Filch yelled, as you focused on him, as Draco did the same. Filch shook his head, taking one look around the area, before waddling away.</p><p>You let out a long sigh, and Draco looked at you.&rdquo;You almost got caught there, (Y/N)!&rdquo; Draco grumbled at you quietly, and you stuck out your tongue at him, which he grabbed with his pale and cold fingers.&rdquo;Don&rsquo;t stick your tongue out at me, ass.&rdquo; He grimaced at you, not letting go of you tongue. You pulled at his hand, then bite his finger lightly.</p><p>&ldquo;You fucking bit me!&rdquo; He screeched quietly, and you giggled. He scrunched up his nose, in anger, and grabbed you by your wrist, pulling you closer to his face.&rdquo;That wasn&rsquo;t very nice.&rdquo; He hissed, his gorgeous face becoming more soft.He shook his head and dropped your wrist, looking away from you.<br /></p><p>You pierced your lips, and poked him in the side, and his face snapped to you, his cheeks tinted pink. You smirked, and he went to grab your finger, that was about to poke him again. You pulled back, and Draco lost his balance, falling on top of you. This time you both blushed, but you were pretty sure yours were rosy red. He tried to get up, but his robe was caught in a root, and he looked at you.</p><p>Suddenly,Draco fell on top of you, and you felt something hard abruptly poke you.
