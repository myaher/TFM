Though his heart was pounding like a hammer on steel, his mind was made up. Arya stood facing away from him, her eyes on a table set with battle pieces. They had fled from Winterfell, with the remainder of their army making their way South. Arya had insisted on sharing a tent with him, but he had refused on account of Jon not being happy about it.

With her here before him now, it seemed like a much more impossible thing to do. He swallowed. \u201cArya, I\u2019ve cared about you since we were both young. Through out my life, you have been the one person who has cared about me and wanted to protect me, just as much as I have you. And now, well now we are grown. And I want to protect you for the rest of my life, and I want you to protect me for the rest of your life.\u201d</p><p>Arya half smiled. \u201cGendry, I\u2019m not just going to up and abandon you.

Stop messing around Gendry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not messing around.\u201d He took several steps closer to her. \u201cAll of my life I have known nothing but uncertainty. Where my next meal would come from, when the gold cloaks were going to find me, if I was going to be sold off again. But you have been the one constant. I have always known that you will be there, if you could. I know you will fight for me. You\u2019re the one thing I have ever wanted.\u201d<br/></p><p>Arya stared up at him, her face blank, but her eye full of a storm that he couldn\u2019t understand.

                "content": "<p>I was going to put this into a fic and I still might, but for now I wanted to share it with all of you lovel Gendrya shippers. </p><p>Gendry walked into the tent with purpose, his mind on the one task at hand. Though his heart was pounding like a hammer on steel, his mind was made up. Arya stood facing away from him, her eyes on a table set with battle pieces. They had fled from Winterfell, with the remainder of their army making their way South. Arya had insisted on sharing a tent with him, but he had refused on account of Jon not being happy about it. She turned now.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, good, you&rsquo;re here. I wanted to ask you about-&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Arya,&rdquo; he interrupted. &ldquo;I need to say something to you, and I need to say it now before I lose courage.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Arya raised an eyebrow. &ldquo;Alright, what is it?&rdquo;</p><p>Gendry took a breath. With her here before him now, it seemed like a much more impossible thing to do. He swallowed. &ldquo;Arya, I&rsquo;ve cared about you since we were both young. Through out my life, you have been the one person who has cared about me and wanted to protect me, just as much as I have you. And now, well now we are grown. And I want to protect you for the rest of my life, and I want you to protect me for the rest of your life.&rdquo;</p><p>Arya half smiled. &ldquo;Gendry, I&rsquo;m not just going to up and abandon you. You know that.&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded. &ldquo;Yes, I know. But I want to make it more official. Arya, will you marry me?&rdquo;</p><p>Arya&rsquo;s smiled slipped from her face. &ldquo;What? Stop messing around Gendry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not messing around.&rdquo; He took several steps closer to her. &ldquo;All of my life I have known nothing but uncertainty. Where my next meal would come from, when the gold cloaks were going to find me, if I was going to be sold off again. But you have been the one constant. I have always known that you will be there, if you could. I know you will fight for me. You&rsquo;re the one thing I have ever wanted.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Arya stared up at him, her face blank, but her eye full of a storm that he couldn&rsquo;t understand. Finally, she shook her head. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>Gendry let out a breath, his heart dropping to his stomach. But he had prepared for this. Arya wasn&rsquo;t one to accept so easily. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p><p>She scoffed. &ldquo;Because I don&rsquo;t want to!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe that. I love you, and I know you love me. Give me a better answer.&rdquo;</p><p>Arya gritted her teeth. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have to give you anything!&rdquo; </p><p>She shoved past him and walked out of the tent, leaving him alone and staring after her.</p><p>********************************</p><p>Arya stomped through the camp ground. How dare he? Did he not know her at all? She had told him all her life that she didn&rsquo;t want to marry and be a Lady. She walked to the edge of a hill on the outskirts of camp, overlooking a valley. The wind swept her cloak away from her, but she barely felt it. She was too hot. </p><p>Why would Gendry do this? Was he trying ruin what they had? Maybe he was a coward and didn&rsquo;t want to hurt her, so this was his way of making her push him away. Arya sighed. She knew this wasn&rsquo;t true. Gendry was no coward. And he did love her. She could see it in his eyes, just as he saw it in hers. She didn&rsquo;t hear her sister come to stand beside her, but she knew she was there without looking. </p><p>&ldquo;Is everything alright?&rdquo; Sansa asked. <br /></p><p>Arya closed her eyes. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p><p>They were silent for several minutes before Arya spoke again. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe in marriage, do you?&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa didn&rsquo;t answer at first. Arya glanced at her, and saw that her eyes were distant focused on the hills far beyond where they stood. </p><p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say that. I don&rsquo;t believe in marriage for political purpose.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Arya raised her eyebrows. &ldquo;Then what&rsquo;s the point?&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa smiled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only ever seen one healthy and happy marriage. Mothers and Fathers. And I know that it was hard, even though they loved each other. But I think they wouldn&rsquo;t have had it any other way.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But how can one assure that a marriage will work? That they won&rsquo;t tire of each other or grow resentful?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Sansa sighed. &ldquo;I think the key is equality. Both parties must have as much to give as they take. Love is good, but it&rsquo;s not the only thing needed. They must respect each other as much as they love. And neither can ask something of the other that they would not be willing to give. Sort of like you and Gendry.&rdquo;</p><p>Arya looked sharply at her sister. Sansa was smiling down at her with that knowing smile of hers. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever seen anyone respect someone as much as Gendry respects you and you him. Most would kill for a love like that.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Arya looked away, and she knew what she had to do.</p><p>***************************</p><p>Gednry sat in the chair facing the table.
