They looked terrified as they tripped and stumbled over each other. Once the door was clear, he spotted a lone man leaving.</p><p>Stane switched cameras, needing to find where this strange man had gone during his time inside. It looked like he had been rather charming with the staff. They led him to the main offices.</p><p>Stane checked the camera just outside Howard\u2019s office. This was the man\u2019s target. Stane watched him crush and tear off the knob, the door swinging open.</p><p>He stared at the screen before muttering, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me.\u201d How was this even possible?</p><p>Several minutes passed before the young man left the office. Stane followed his trek through the halls, noticing right away the difference in the staff\u2019s behavior toward him. Now they were scared. They were running out of his path.</p><p>What changed?</p><p>He couldn\u2019t find an answer for that, but something else piqued his interest now.</p><p>He left for Howard\u2019s office.</p><p>Stopping at the door, he stared open-mouthed at the large hole where the knob should be. Just how strong was this intruder and what was he after? He went inside and looked around, finding similar forced entry into the desk drawer and the file cabinet. \u201cHoward, what have you gotten yourself into this time?\u201d</p><p>Stane went to the desk first, finding a note from Fury that simply read <i>Analyze this</i>, and beside it was a small box. He opened it and blanched. Inside was what looked like biological tissue, possibly flesh, and Stane quickly closed it again.</p><p>Maybe the file cabinet would have more information. Turning to it, he found a drawer still slightly extended. He pulled it further, and on top was Howard\u2019s latest project.</p><p>The papers listed things like enhanced healing, slight immunity to bullets, with the added note of <i>aim for the heart</i>. Howard\u2019s own results were turning up very little, even noting that he needed a larger sample.</p><p>He checked another paper. Two subjects. Female dead. Male missing within headquarters. Stane wondered if the male subject was still there. He was curious enough to go to SHIELD and find out.</p><p>Would he be allowed inside? He had clearance when he and Howard first became partners, but Fury always favored Howard. Stane knew Fury distrusted him, but he couldn\u2019t figure out why. None of his illegal dealings have ever made it to the public eye. However, Fury did always know more than he ever let on.</p><p>Stane put the papers back in the folder. Best to not let Howard know he was snooping. He would need to erase the footage of his own time in here.</p><p>And then time to visit Fury.</p><p><b>***** ***** *****</b></p><p>Howard stopped at his car before staring back at SHIELD Headquarters. He refused to believe that they were dealing with <i>vampires</i>, of all things. Yes, he was shown the footage of Fury\u2019s fight with the male. He was quick, vicious, but like many others, he couldn\u2019t stand up to the taser that Fury kept on his person.</p><p>Then Howard was shown footage of the two agents.</p><p><i>\u2018One was nearly completely drained of blood,\u2019 Fury had explained. \u2018The other, well, you saw what happened to them.\u2019</i></p><p><i>\u2018But a vampire?\u2019</i></p><p><i>\u2018I didn\u2019t want to believe it at first either, but it seems to fit.\u2019</i></p><p><i>Fury then led Howard to see the male they were keeping in a cheap metal cage.</i></p><p><i>\u2018He hasn\u2019t escaped?\u2019 Howard questioned.</i></p><p><i>\u2018He\u2019s weakened. I bet if he gets more blood in him, though, he\u2019d be ready to devour us all.\u2019</i></p><p><i>The so-called vampire had said nothing as Howard stared.</i></p><p>There just had to be another explanation. Science could explain illness, it could explain other worldly beings, but vampires were horror stories told to scare young children from going outside late at night. Or they\u2019re fictional monsters romanticized by writers.</p><p>This had to be an obsessive couple that convinced themselves their delusions were real. He never saw the body of the female, nor any official autopsy report, but he was told that she fell to the bullets like any human normally would. <i>Aim for the heart</i>, he remembered the original file saying. How appropriate.</p><p>Director Fury had been working on the impossible for too long and was now willing to believe anything. That had to be the case. Why else would he believe this ridiculous claim?</p><p>Howard shook his head and got into his car. It was true that many different cultures had their own versions of the old tale, but there couldn\u2019t possibly be even a sliver of truth to those stories, could there?</p><p>He shoved his key into the ignition and turned it. He listened to the hum of his car as he tried to think. Was there a new drug fueling these thoughts, this behavior?</p><p>Howard pulled out of the lot and onto the street.</p><p><b>***** ***** *****</b></p><p>Stane knew he made the right choice when he passed Howard on the road, but the man was too distracted to notice him. It was fine; Howard didn\u2019t need to know.</p><p>SHIELD Headquarters was designed to look like a simple warehouse. Beneath the warehouse disguise was an advanced base of operation that examined the wonders of the universe, deciding whether one was a threat, or if it could be exploited for the advancement of the human race.</p><p>He parked his car and stepped out, slamming the door shut and then walking up to the building. Security greeted him and patted him down. Once they were satisfied, he was sent to the next checkpoint where he was granted clearance, his name and information still on file. Fury must not consider him a threat, even if he didn\u2019t trust him.</p><p>An agent led him to Fury\u2019s office.</p><p>Director Fury stared at him as he entered. \u201cObadiah, to what do I owe the pleasure? Did we request your presence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you did not. I\u2019m a little hurt by it, actually.\u201d He took the empty chair across from Fury\u2019s desk. \u201cI would like another chance to be someone you can go to for your little\u2026 projects.\u201d</p><p>Fury eyed him cautiously. \u201cWhat makes you think now will be any different?\u201d</p><p>A grin played at Stane\u2019s lips and he leaned in. \u201cI know what the new project is, and I want in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpossible.\u201d</p><p>Stane noticed the slight change in posture, the subtle way Fury tensed. So he continued. \u201cI won\u2019t say anything if you let me in on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything, Obadiah,\u201d Fury told him, a hint of warning in his tone.</p><p>\u201cAim for the heart, right?\u201d</p><p>A twitch.</p><p>\u201cI want in, Fury.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what use would you be to me? You\u2019re a businessman, and I need a scientist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know if I had no scientific background whatsoever, Howard would never have partnered up with me,\u201d Stane countered. \u201cI\u2019ve kept all his secrets over the years, I can keep yours.\u201d He kept up the casual act, hoping to fool Fury. He only had guesses to go on based on the file.</p><p>But Fury didn\u2019t need to know that. He just needed to believe what Stane was telling him.</p><p>Director Fury narrowed his eye at Stane as he folded his arms. \u201cYou realize if anything gets leaked, we are forced to handle the problem ASAP.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Stane agreed. He was almost there.</p><p>\u201cGive the name of the person who told you about the project.\u201d</p><p>Stane managed to keep himself from reacting too visibly. \u201cI never asked his name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAppearance then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShort, dark hair. Dark eyes. Young.\u201d Keep it general.</p><p>Fury continued to stare at him until he finally said, \u201cAlright.\u201d</p><p>Stane\u2019s eyes widened before he quickly schooled his expression.</p><p>Was it really that easy?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have someone take you to our little project,\u201d Fury added, pressing a button.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Director Fury.\u201d He needed to stay calm. He couldn\u2019t let himself get found out now.</p><p>An agent came for him and they left Fury\u2019s office together. Stane still couldn\u2019t believe it worked so well.</p><p>Fury\u2019s second-in-command stepped in shortly later. \u201cI know what you did, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to test the theory,\u201d Fury stated. \u201cLet him eat. Obadiah tried saying that Stark\u2019s son told him about the vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re sending him to his death?\u201d she questioned.</p><p>\u201cHe knows enough to be a liability. The vampire can take care of him.\u201d</p><p>===== ===== =====</p><p><b><a href=\"https://crystallized-iron.tumblr.com/post/185845027077/bite-me-chapter-eight\" target=\"_blank\">Previous Chapter</a> | <a href=\"https://crystallized-iron.tumblr.com/post/185897836512/bite-me-chapter-ten\" target=\"_blank\">Next Chapter</a></b></p>",

Or they&rsquo;re fictional monsters romanticized by writers.</p><p>This had to be an obsessive couple that convinced themselves their delusions were real. He never saw the body of the female, nor any official autopsy report, but he was told that she fell to the bullets like any human normally would. <i>Aim for the heart</i>, he remembered the original file saying. How appropriate.</p><p>Director Fury had been working on the impossible for too long and was now willing to believe anything. That had to be the case. Why else would he believe this ridiculous claim?</p><p>Howard shook his head and got into his car. It was true that many different cultures had their own versions of the old tale, but there couldn&rsquo;t possibly be even a sliver of truth to those stories, could there?</p><p>He shoved his key into the ignition and turned it. He listened to the hum of his car as he tried to think. Was there a new drug fueling these thoughts, this behavior?</p><p>Howard pulled out of the lot and onto the street.</p><p><b>***** ***** *****</b></p><p>Stane knew he made the right choice when he passed Howard on the road, but the man was too distracted to notice him. It was fine; Howard didn&rsquo;t need to know.</p><p>SHIELD Headquarters was designed to look like a simple warehouse. Beneath the warehouse disguise was an advanced base of operation that examined the wonders of the universe, deciding whether one was a threat, or if it could be exploited for the advancement of the human race.</p><p>He parked his car and stepped out, slamming the door shut and then walking up to the building. Security greeted him and patted him down. Once they were satisfied, he was sent to the next checkpoint where he was granted clearance, his name and information still on file. Fury must not consider him a threat, even if he didn&rsquo;t trust him.</p><p>An agent led him to Fury&rsquo;s office.</p><p>Director Fury stared at him as he entered. &ldquo;Obadiah, to what do I owe the pleasure? Did we request your presence?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, you did not. I&rsquo;m a little hurt by it, actually.&rdquo; He took the empty chair across from Fury&rsquo;s desk. &ldquo;I would like another chance to be someone you can go to for your little&hellip; projects.&rdquo;</p><p>Fury eyed him cautiously. &ldquo;What makes you think now will be any different?&rdquo;</p><p>A grin played at Stane&rsquo;s lips and he leaned in. &ldquo;I know what the new project is, and I want in.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Impossible.&rdquo;</p><p>Stane noticed the slight change in posture, the subtle way Fury tensed. So he continued. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t say anything if you let me in on it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know anything, Obadiah,&rdquo; Fury told him, a hint of warning in his tone.</p><p>&ldquo;Aim for the heart, right?&rdquo;</p><p>A twitch.</p><p>&ldquo;I want in, Fury.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And what use would you be to me? You&rsquo;re a businessman, and I need a scientist.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You know if I had no scientific background whatsoever, Howard would never have partnered up with me,&rdquo; Stane countered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve kept all his secrets over the years, I can keep yours.&rdquo; He kept up the casual act, hoping to fool Fury. He only had guesses to go on based on the file.</p><p>But Fury didn&rsquo;t need to know that. He just needed to believe what Stane was telling him.</p><p>Director Fury narrowed his eye at Stane as he folded his arms. &ldquo;You realize if anything gets leaked, we are forced to handle the problem ASAP.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Stane agreed. He was almost there.</p><p>&ldquo;Give the name of the person who told you about the project.&rdquo;</p><p>Stane managed to keep himself from reacting too visibly. &ldquo;I never asked his name.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Appearance then.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Short, dark hair. Dark eyes. Young.&rdquo; Keep it general.</p><p>Fury continued to stare at him until he finally said, &ldquo;Alright.&rdquo;</p><p>Stane&rsquo;s eyes widened before he quickly schooled his expression.</p><p>Was it really that easy?</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have someone take you to our little project,&rdquo; Fury added, pressing a button.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Director Fury.&rdquo; He needed to stay calm. He couldn&rsquo;t let himself get found out now.</p><p>An agent came for him and they left Fury&rsquo;s office together. Stane still couldn&rsquo;t believe it worked so well.</p><p>Fury&rsquo;s second-in-command stepped in shortly later. &ldquo;I know what you did, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We need to test the theory,&rdquo; Fury stated. &ldquo;Let him eat. Obadiah tried saying that Stark&rsquo;s son told him about the vampire.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re sending him to his death?&rdquo; she questioned.</p><p>&ldquo;He knows enough to be a liability. The vampire can take care of him.&rdquo;</p><p>===== ===== =====</p><p><b><a href=\"https://crystallized-iron.tumblr.com/post/185845027077/bite-me-chapter-eight\" target=\"_blank\">Previous Chapter</a> | <a href=\"https://crystallized-iron.tumblr.com/post/185897836512/bite-me-chapter-ten\" target=\"_blank\">Next Chapter</a></b></p></p>",
