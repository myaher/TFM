I also saw her on October 24, 2015 in Atlanta, during her 1989 World Tour. Those were two of the best nights of my life. I saw Taylor for the 3rd time in Nashville, TN on August 25, 2018! I touched her hand that night and it still doesn\u2019t seem real. I have never met you in person Taylor. This is my dream!

I can remember the very night I was introduced to you, back in the days of Bebo I had an online friend who told me I should give you a listen, so I did, and that was the night things changed. I went onto youtube and searched for Taylor Swift, now I can\u2019t remember which one I picked first, but I know I definitely watched the video for Picture To Burn and Our Song as I have those videos burned in the back of my mind, I was hooked.</p><p>Fast forward to 2008 when Fearless was released, I was so excited for this album, I have vivid memories of being on vacation in Disney World, Orlando and on the first night we went to Downtown Disney (or Disney Springs as it is now) and I dragged my parents to the Virgin Music store that used to be there, and I searched high and low for the album, eventually my dad called me over and there in his hand was the masterpiece! We spent the rest of our 3 week vacation with Fearless on repeat! I can remember being in the hotel room listening to Radio Disney and they played White Horse and I got off the bed and stood in front of the TV just belting the words out, but the best part was the fact that my mom and dad were singing along too!!</p><p>2009 was the beginning of an incredible journey. My dad came home one night from work, and told me he\u2019d managed to get tickets to see you in London, I was so excited!! May 6th 2009, Shepherds Bush Empire in London, there was me, my dad, my mom and my childhood friend, we had seats literally at the back on level 3, I was a little disappointed but that didn\u2019t stop me from having the time of my life! I said this was the beginning of an incredible journey because 6 months later in November, I saw you again at Wembley Arena, this time my friend and I had floor seats, and my mom and dad had seats further back. I can remember being in awe, there is nothing like being at a Taylor Swift concert.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"604\" data-orig-height=\"453\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/tempmediahashed.tumblr.com/ce38781a40f7af51f1b7eecbb9586b68/tumblr_pcq7ssQtQ71qkgvj9_raw.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"604\" data-orig-height=\"453\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"604\" data-orig-height=\"453\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/tempmediahashed.tumblr.com/f027cdfddab1305eb538891b53bf91e7/tumblr_pcq7soO6Bc1qkgvj9_raw.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"604\" data-orig-height=\"453\"/></figure><p>2010 was the release of Speak Now and I had that damn album on repeat for weeks! I drove my friends and family crazy!! So Speak Now World Tour tickets went on sale and I wasn\u2019t sure whether I was going to go, as much as I love concerts and seeing you perform I just couldn\u2019t decide whether to go or not, even though you were coming to Birmingham, UK which is the closest city to me. About a month before the concert, I was with a group of friends and we all agreed that we wanted to go, so that night we booked tickets. The show was incredible as always and my friends gave me the funniest looks when I was the only one singing along to anything from before Speak Now!!</p><figure data-orig-width=\"720\" data-orig-height=\"540\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/tempmediahashed.tumblr.com/47faade01d8e392b54d183f833494dde/tumblr_pcq7soHcMt1qkgvj9_raw.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"720\" data-orig-height=\"540\"/></figure><p>2012 was a rough year for me, I\u2019d started Sixth Form in Septemeber 2011, after being at the same school for about 13 years with the same people, it was time for the big move. I hated every minute of it! However I can remember the release of RED and how exciting it was. I had it playing every morning on the bus to college and on the bus home. Now 2013 when tickets for the UK leg of the RED tour went on sale&hellip; I was there ready and waiting at presale but no luck, I was gutted, but I gave it another go during general sale, but again no luck. Then you added extra dates&hellip; which meant I had another chance, and I did manage to get 2 tickets on the floor, I was over the moon! I had originally planned to go with my boyfriend at the time, but unfortunately we broke up in the January, so I ended up taking my dad, which was a bonus because he\u2019s incredible and he loved your music! So February 10th 2014, me and my dad made our way down to London, to the O2. We got to our seats and I was so so happy, they were so close! I remember seeing Andrea walk past but people were swarming her for photos so I stayed in my seat.

I then travelled to Manchester to see you both nights on my own, however I did meet some incredible people! I then saw you at Wembley night one, and honestly I died when you sang So it goes, it is my favourite off the album! Now remember when I said that seeing you in London in 2009 was the start of an incredible journey? well here\u2019s why, Today is July 31st, which means in two weeks you\u2019ll be performing in Tampa, FL and I will be there! I\u2019m travelling on my own all the way to see you! I\u2019m honestly so excited!! And the best part is that I\u2019ll be doing it all over again in Nashville! I\u2019m literally flying in the day before the concerts and flying home the day after, some people may think I\u2019m crazy, but honestly nothing makes me happier than watching you perform, and being able to do that in two of my favourite places is just going to be incredible!!</p><figure data-orig-width=\"960\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/tempmediahashed.tumblr.com/f8d8c35e041d84f42467e10af80ca2a9/tumblr_pcq7stzSUX1qkgvj9_raw.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"960\" data-orig-height=\"1280\"/></figure><p>So I guess I\u2019ll be seeing you soon!</p><p><b>TAMPA - Sec K row 32 seat 1</b></p><p><b>NASHVILLE - Sec P row 32 seat 13!</b></p><p>P.S.

I then travelled to Manchester to see you both nights on my own, however I did meet some incredible people! I then saw you at Wembley night one, and honestly I died when you sang So it goes, it is my favourite off the album! Now remember when I said that seeing you in London in 2009 was the start of an incredible journey? well here\u2019s why, Today is July 31st, which means in two weeks you\u2019ll be performing in Tampa, FL and I will be there! I\u2019m travelling on my own all the way to see you! I\u2019m honestly so excited!! And the best part is that I\u2019ll be doing it all over again in Nashville! I\u2019m literally flying in the day before the concerts and flying home the day after, some people may think I\u2019m crazy, but honestly nothing makes me happier than watching you perform, and being able to do that in two of my favourite places is just going to be incredible!!</p><figure data-orig-width=\"960\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/tempmediahashed.tumblr.com/f8d8c35e041d84f42467e10af80ca2a9/tumblr_pcq7stzSUX1qkgvj9_raw.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"960\" data-orig-height=\"1280\"></figure><p>So I guess I\u2019ll be seeing you soon!</p><p><b>TAMPA - Sec K row 32 seat 1</b></p><p><b>NASHVILLE - Sec P row 32 seat 13!</b></p><p>P.S.

                "content": "<p><h2>Dear Taylor,</h2><p>I don&rsquo;t normally ever write long posts or any posts at all really and I&rsquo;m not expecting this to get any notes or attention but I just want you to know how much you mean to me and I love you unconditionally, you bring so much happiness into my life and I just need you to know, so here goes&hellip;</p><p>My name is Paige, I am 23 years old and I have been a fan since forever! I can remember the very night I was introduced to you, back in the days of Bebo I had an online friend who told me I should give you a listen, so I did, and that was the night things changed. I went onto youtube and searched for Taylor Swift, now I can&rsquo;t remember which one I picked first, but I know I definitely watched the video for Picture To Burn and Our Song as I have those videos burned in the back of my mind, I was hooked.</p><p>Fast forward to 2008 when Fearless was released, I was so excited for this album, I have vivid memories of being on vacation in Disney World, Orlando and on the first night we went to Downtown Disney (or Disney Springs as it is now) and I dragged my parents to the Virgin Music store that used to be there, and I searched high and low for the album, eventually my dad called me over and there in his hand was the masterpiece! We spent the rest of our 3 week vacation with Fearless on repeat! I can remember being in the hotel room listening to Radio Disney and they played White Horse and I got off the bed and stood in front of the TV just belting the words out, but the best part was the fact that my mom and dad were singing along too!!</p><p>2009 was the beginning of an incredible journey. My dad came home one night from work, and told me he&rsquo;d managed to get tickets to see you in London, I was so excited!! May 6th 2009, Shepherds Bush Empire in London, there was me, my dad, my mom and my childhood friend, we had seats literally at the back on level 3, I was a little disappointed but that didn&rsquo;t stop me from having the time of my life! I said this was the beginning of an incredible journey because 6 months later in November, I saw you again at Wembley Arena, this time my friend and I had floor seats, and my mom and dad had seats further back. I can remember being in awe, there is nothing like being at a Taylor Swift concert.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/tempmediahashed.tumblr.com/ce38781a40f7af51f1b7eecbb9586b68/tumblr_pcq7ssQtQ71qkgvj9_raw.jpg\">External image</div></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/tempmediahashed.tumblr.com/f027cdfddab1305eb538891b53bf91e7/tumblr_pcq7soO6Bc1qkgvj9_raw.jpg\">External image</div></figure><p>2010 was the release of Speak Now and I had that damn album on repeat for weeks! I drove my friends and family crazy!! So Speak Now World Tour tickets went on sale and I wasn&rsquo;t sure whether I was going to go, as much as I love concerts and seeing you perform I just couldn&rsquo;t decide whether to go or not, even though you were coming to Birmingham, UK which is the closest city to me. About a month before the concert, I was with a group of friends and we all agreed that we wanted to go, so that night we booked tickets. The show was incredible as always and my friends gave me the funniest looks when I was the only one singing along to anything from before Speak Now!!</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/tempmediahashed.tumblr.com/47faade01d8e392b54d183f833494dde/tumblr_pcq7soHcMt1qkgvj9_raw.jpg\">External image</div></figure><p>2012 was a rough year for me, I&rsquo;d started Sixth Form in Septemeber 2011, after being at the same school for about 13 years with the same people, it was time for the big move. I hated every minute of it! However I can remember the release of RED and how exciting it was. I had it playing every morning on the bus to college and on the bus home. Now 2013 when tickets for the UK leg of the RED tour went on sale&hellip; I was there ready and waiting at presale but no luck, I was gutted, but I gave it another go during general sale, but again no luck. Then you added extra dates&hellip; which meant I had another chance, and I did manage to get 2 tickets on the floor, I was over the moon! I had originally planned to go with my boyfriend at the time, but unfortunately we broke up in the January, so I ended up taking my dad, which was a bonus because he&rsquo;s incredible and he loved your music! So February 10th 2014, me and my dad made our way down to London, to the O2. We got to our seats and I was so so happy, they were so close! I remember seeing Andrea walk past but people were swarming her for photos so I stayed in my seat. During 22 when you got carried by your dancers, you went right next to me and I touched your hand and I think I died in that moment!</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/tempmediahashed.tumblr.com/9896903ea904b01f9db7e785a32d316e/tumblr_pcq7spP6mH1qkgvj9_raw.jpg\">External image</div></figure><p>Now lets fast forward to the release of 1989, I was at a completely different stage of my life at this point.
