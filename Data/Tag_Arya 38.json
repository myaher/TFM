Ned Stark was unfairly accused and then brutally beheaded before he could even look at his children for one last time, Missandei was killed the same way after suffering all her life, Catelyn Stark died thinking all of her family was dead and seeing one of her sons being stabbed\u2026 I know it\u2019s fiction, but the writers could\u2019ve done better.
