She saw the entire student body pour out of the school and she tried standing on the tips of her toes to find the brunette in a blue sweater but he was too hard to find. Until she felt a quick spark on her fingers.<br/></p><p>She turned around and saw Peter grabbing her hand trying to get her attention. She smiled at him then down at the grip he had on her. Peter noticed how long he was holding her hand and how long the spark was lasting so he pulled away quickly. A dark shade of red appeared on his cheeks and he avoided her gaze. </p><p>A frown grew on Y/n\u2019s face when he pulled away but she replaced it with a small smile before he could notice, \u201cSo should we go?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah yeah. But um, just to let you know, Ned is coming over soon so him and I can work on something together. I hope that\u2019s cool.\u201d Peter looked at Y/n while rubbing the back of his neck with the hand he grabbed her with. He still avoided her gaze which caused Y/n to become a little suspicious of what he was saying.</p><p>\u201cSo, its gonna be you, me and Ned then?\u201d Y/n was a bit upset that it wasn\u2019t going to be only her and Peter but she put it aside rather than dwell on it. </p><p>\u201cWell, me and Ned have something really important to work on. Privately. But I mean we can continue on with the stuff tomorrow. Its going to be Saturday so we would have more time in the day tomorrow.\u201d Peter didn\u2019t want to hurt her feelings but him and Ned really needed to know where the guys from last night were going. </p><p>At this point, Y/n and Peter were on the crowded train as the conversation continued. Y/n looked into Peter\u2019s eyes and was about to reply until the train came to an abrupt stop. The force caused Y/n to stumbled and fall onto Peter chest. With Peter\u2019s enhanced balanced, he didn\u2019t need to grab onto the pole but instead he put his hands on Y/n waist to hold her. </p><p>The closed space between their bodies had them both blushing when they looked at eachother. Y/n placed her hands onto his chest to take a step back but Peter squeezed her sides gently then removed them after. It wasn\u2019t just a small spark that showed up when they touched, this time it was more strong vibration going through their bodies that had their hearts pumping. </p><p>Y/n took a step back as much as she could in the crowded train and looked away from Peter. Neither knew what to say, the previous conversation taking an end. The rest of the train ride was silent until they got to Peter\u2019s stop. Walking from the station to his house, neither looked at the other in the eye. </p><p>With the quiet journey home, Peter didn\u2019t expect her to ask him about the decathlon situation when they settled in his room, \u201cI heard you dropped out the decathlon team. Why?\u201d </p><p>Pulling their materials out their bags, Peter hesitated to answer, \u201cWell, the Stark internship. It takes up alot of time after school and on the weekends so I barely have time to do anything other than school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you have time for me.\u201d</p><p>Peter looked over at Y/n sitting on his bed, she was waiting for a reply to her comment but he didn\u2019t know what to say so he nodded and agreed, \u201cYeah, i do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Y/n was eager to know the answer, heart beating harder the longer he took to say something. </p><p>Peter sat on the bed next to her with a textbook and notebook in his hands. His placement had the side of their thighs and knees touching. He coughed lightly before opening the algebra textbook in his hand, \u201cNot sure, I just\u2026\u201d</p><p>He looked at her in the eyes, seeming to be the most gentle things he had ever seen in his life. She was looking back at his brown eyes and bit her lip. Neither knew, but both of their hearts swelled in their chest while holding the other\u2019s gaze, \u201cYou what?\u201d</p><p>Slowly, Peter went from looking at her eyes to her lips then back up. \u201cI just did.\u201d Almost shaking from nerves, Peter started leaning forward when suddenly the door open. Aunt May was standing at the door with a basket of laundry in her hands.</p><p>\u201cOh shit. Sorry Peter. I didn\u2019t know you had a girl over. Hi I\u2019m May. Peter\u2019s aunt.\u201d She looked quickly at Peter who gave her an annoyed look.</p><p>Y/n was still flustered from their previous actions before May walked in and took a moment to register what she said, \u201cOh um. Hi, Im Y/n.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh you\u2019re Y/n. Wow Peter, when you said she was beautiful, you weren\u2019t kidding.\u201d Freaking out at her comment, Peter silently begged for May to walk out the room. </p><p>Through almost closed lips, Peter tried getting his aunt to leave, \u201cAunt May. I didn\u2019t say that.\u201d </p><p>Y/n looked at him with her eyebrows raised not knowing what to say. He looked at her and saw Y/n\u2019s expression change from shocked to hurt, \u201cNo. I mean I did. You are beautiful. But like, Aunt May wasn\u2019t supposed to say anything.\u201d</p><p>Peter gave his aunt another annoyed look and that\u2019s when she finally took the cue to leave. </p><p>\u201cOkay, Im going to order some food. Pizza tonight? Pizza it is.\u201d With that, she left the room, leaving the bedroom door slightly open ajar. </p><p>Peter looked back at Y/n and sighed in relief.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about that. Sometimes she can get a bit\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Much is the word. Should we uh, get back to algebra though?\u201d Peter glanced back and forth from her face and to the textbook that was still placed back on his lap. Y/n bit her lip again and Peter sucked in a breath when he saw.</p><p>\u201cWell we never really started did we. You were about to kiss me.\u201d <i>Please kiss me. </i></p><p>Her words were as effective to his actions as candy was to a child; exciting and strong. The change in the amount of tension almost caused Y/n to take back her words but before she could, she felt Peter\u2019s lips on hers.</p><p>They were soft against hers; eager yet slow, gentle with the movements but unrestrained with the passion. </p><p>Not knowing what to do next, her hands moved the notebook on her laps to the floor. She fixed her position sitting next to him without breaking the connection to their lips. Her hands went to his head and pulled at the hair in the nape of his neck. </p><p>Too soon, both of them disconnected their lips to catch their breaths. She leaned her forehead on his and smiled. Pulling away, Peter didn\u2019t want to let go of her. His hands did not remove themselves from her waist, instead pulling her even closer, \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>She laughed lightly and leaned her head on his shoulder, \u201cHi Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I distracted you.\u201d He leaned his cheek on her head and sighed. Relief flushed over them both, stomachs stopped churning but heart rates increased. She laughed again before nudging him on the side with his elbow, \u201cIts okay. I liked the distraction. But I guess this means you know I like you?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a <i>really?</i> look and they both started laughing. Having one arm around her, he pulled her as close as he could. </p><p>With their feelings established and work still in front of them, they decided to start actually doing what needed to be done. Peter went over the lessons she didn\u2019t understand and believe it or not, he was a good teacher. A teacher that would squeeze her side or kiss her cheek every time she got something right.</p><p>~~~</p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/midFgWEFHYGVCUknCnVzwWw\">@a&ndash;1&ndash;1&ndash;3</a> | <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mluS5c7-L0P7hr4d8e3ymuA\">@fangirlwithasweettooth</a> | <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mi0CrOjEe1QlUNWUnHNf9Xw\">@parkerspicedlatte</a> | <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/muijrDdrp9h8JtKRtxmNfPw\">@jackiehollanderr</a> | <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUuw41bfZoVJ3sfjWcJ-2_Q\">@nobodydopeasyou</a> | <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mukNM6lELfStKMZtbgwtOew\">@sabrinabernal</a> | <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8vUxZR8qg4e8iMYkr_TigQ\">@embrace-themagic</a> |\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdcoi8vVH1xy7VlMm6vJjyg\">@tommyhollander2013</a> | <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvFGjFmr2eZXwZw1jK0F5bw\">@mixedfeeelings</a> | <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzlYhftDdEGuhJTYK6TpETA\">@personljournal</a> | <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mn90wU9L7COhsUuzGPVqUKw\">@awkwardfangirl2014</a> | <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFXd-QeGKaC70sheZ_s0YVw\">@lemirabitur</a> | <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mo4V_h7k94nmjwN9tEbab1w\">@phenominiallfabiola</a> | <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7gBzRTnxNkCtyFs_qv3q7A\">@alisoncdariel</a> | <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/myl8NwSy-VImf0qyEsU2duw\">@thatpeterparkerfan</a> | <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mv4bTVGtFl9swQ0-7vKgjoA\">@learning-howto-be-myselfx3</a> | <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m80fCyPGa1uxGOHHr93cZBA\">@awkward-mystic-beauty</a> | <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXCJK3w2sb0toVktGah0yrg\">@myrandom-fandomlife</a> | <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgR2pY052AXF42KT-F0YtFw\">@infinity-fandom-trash</a> | <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqlmHr_4wBTAoy1gNBqDGRA\">@unicorngummybears</a> | <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mu5L_UBhxhyXdTuTgJ0JpnQ\">@ludiclove</a> | <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mx1kSHCk4T8i8_T4usoaDZw\">@jollymuffinuniversitypickle</a> |\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkKGpgktw08bufuNJZnqXGw\">@beastounding</a> | <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLRtBsdwW9Qk1sLce0Vq_dw\">@undertheheartofjamesmcavoyxd</a> |\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnA0o4eAbx7J0wt3wIgliPQ\">@nicole-lynne</a> | <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKoZS_Sy6SeYgxQlHvkP1xg\">@silver-winter-wolf</a> | <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCZEODNhx4EqRG9U6ZsYvkw\">@outerspxce-jillian</a> |</p>",

Should we uh, get back to algebra though?\u201d Peter glanced back and forth from her face and to the textbook that was still placed back on his lap. Y/n bit her lip again and Peter sucked in a breath when he saw.</p><p>\u201cWell we never really started did we. You were about to kiss me.\u201d <i>Please kiss me. </i></p><p>Her words were as effective to his actions as candy was to a child; exciting and strong. The change in the amount of tension almost caused Y/n to take back her words but before she could, she felt Peter\u2019s lips on hers.</p><p>They were soft against hers; eager yet slow, gentle with the movements but unrestrained with the passion. </p><p>Not knowing what to do next, her hands moved the notebook on her laps to the floor. She fixed her position sitting next to him without breaking the connection to their lips. Her hands went to his head and pulled at the hair in the nape of his neck. </p><p>Too soon, both of them disconnected their lips to catch their breaths. She leaned her forehead on his and smiled. Pulling away, Peter didn\u2019t want to let go of her. His hands did not remove themselves from her waist, instead pulling her even closer, \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>She laughed lightly and leaned her head on his shoulder, \u201cHi Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I distracted you.\u201d He leaned his cheek on her head and sighed. Relief flushed over them both, stomachs stopped churning but heart rates increased. She laughed again before nudging him on the side with his elbow, \u201cIts okay. I liked the distraction. But I guess this means you know I like you?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a <i>really?</i> look and they both started laughing. Having one arm around her, he pulled her as close as he could. </p><p>With their feelings established and work still in front of them, they decided to start actually doing what needed to be done. Peter went over the lessons she didn\u2019t understand and believe it or not, he was a good teacher. A teacher that would squeeze her side or kiss her cheek every time she got something right.</p><p>~~~</p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/midFgWEFHYGVCUknCnVzwWw\">@a\u20131\u20131\u20133</a> | <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mluS5c7-L0P7hr4d8e3ymuA\">@fangirlwithasweettooth</a> | <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mi0CrOjEe1QlUNWUnHNf9Xw\">@parkerspicedlatte</a> | <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/muijrDdrp9h8JtKRtxmNfPw\">@jackiehollanderr</a> | <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUuw41bfZoVJ3sfjWcJ-2_Q\">@nobodydopeasyou</a> | <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mukNM6lELfStKMZtbgwtOew\">@sabrinabernal</a> | <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8vUxZR8qg4e8iMYkr_TigQ\">@embrace-themagic</a> |\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdcoi8vVH1xy7VlMm6vJjyg\">@tommyhollander2013</a> | <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvFGjFmr2eZXwZw1jK0F5bw\">@mixedfeeelings</a> | <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzlYhftDdEGuhJTYK6TpETA\">@personljournal</a> | <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mn90wU9L7COhsUuzGPVqUKw\">@awkwardfangirl2014</a> | <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFXd-QeGKaC70sheZ_s0YVw\">@lemirabitur</a> | <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mo4V_h7k94nmjwN9tEbab1w\">@phenominiallfabiola</a> | <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7gBzRTnxNkCtyFs_qv3q7A\">@alisoncdariel</a> | <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/myl8NwSy-VImf0qyEsU2duw\">@thatpeterparkerfan</a> | <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mv4bTVGtFl9swQ0-7vKgjoA\">@learning-howto-be-myselfx3</a> | <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m80fCyPGa1uxGOHHr93cZBA\">@awkward-mystic-beauty</a> | <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXCJK3w2sb0toVktGah0yrg\">@myrandom-fandomlife</a> | <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgR2pY052AXF42KT-F0YtFw\">@infinity-fandom-trash</a> | <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqlmHr_4wBTAoy1gNBqDGRA\">@unicorngummybears</a> | <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mu5L_UBhxhyXdTuTgJ0JpnQ\">@ludiclove</a> | <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mx1kSHCk4T8i8_T4usoaDZw\">@jollymuffinuniversitypickle</a> |\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkKGpgktw08bufuNJZnqXGw\">@beastounding</a> | <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLRtBsdwW9Qk1sLce0Vq_dw\">@undertheheartofjamesmcavoyxd</a> |\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnA0o4eAbx7J0wt3wIgliPQ\">@nicole-lynne</a> | <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKoZS_Sy6SeYgxQlHvkP1xg\">@silver-winter-wolf</a> | <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCZEODNhx4EqRG9U6ZsYvkw\">@outerspxce-jillian</a> |</p>",

Peter noticed how long he was holding her hand and how long the spark was lasting so he pulled away quickly. A dark shade of red appeared on his cheeks and he avoided her gaze. </p><p>A frown grew on Y/n\u2019s face when he pulled away but she replaced it with a small smile before he could notice, \u201cSo should we go?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah yeah. But um, just to let you know, Ned is coming over soon so him and I can work on something together. I hope that\u2019s cool.\u201d Peter looked at Y/n while rubbing the back of his neck with the hand he grabbed her with. He still avoided her gaze which caused Y/n to become a little suspicious of what he was saying.</p><p>\u201cSo, its gonna be you, me and Ned then?\u201d Y/n was a bit upset that it wasn\u2019t going to be only her and Peter but she put it aside rather than dwell on it. </p><p>\u201cWell, me and Ned have something really important to work on. Privately. But I mean we can continue on with the stuff tomorrow. Its going to be Saturday so we would have more time in the day tomorrow.\u201d Peter didn\u2019t want to hurt her feelings but him and Ned really needed to know where the guys from last night were going. </p><p>At this point, Y/n and Peter were on the crowded train as the conversation continued. Y/n looked into Peter\u2019s eyes and was about to reply until the train came to an abrupt stop. The force caused Y/n to stumbled and fall onto Peter chest. With Peter\u2019s enhanced balanced, he didn\u2019t need to grab onto the pole but instead he put his hands on Y/n waist to hold her. </p><p>The closed space between their bodies had them both blushing when they looked at eachother. Y/n placed her hands onto his chest to take a step back but Peter squeezed her sides gently then removed them after. It wasn\u2019t just a small spark that showed up when they touched, this time it was more strong vibration going through their bodies that had their hearts pumping. </p><p>Y/n took a step back as much as she could in the crowded train and looked away from Peter. Neither knew what to say, the previous conversation taking an end. The rest of the train ride was silent until they got to Peter\u2019s stop. Walking from the station to his house, neither looked at the other in the eye. </p><p>With the quiet journey home, Peter didn\u2019t expect her to ask him about the decathlon situation when they settled in his room, \u201cI heard you dropped out the decathlon team. Why?\u201d </p><p>Pulling their materials out their bags, Peter hesitated to answer, \u201cWell, the Stark internship. It takes up alot of time after school and on the weekends so I barely have time to do anything other than school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you have time for me.\u201d</p><p>Peter looked over at Y/n sitting on his bed, she was waiting for a reply to her comment but he didn\u2019t know what to say so he nodded and agreed, \u201cYeah, i do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Y/n was eager to know the answer, heart beating harder the longer he took to say something. </p><p>Peter sat on the bed next to her with a textbook and notebook in his hands. His placement had the side of their thighs and knees touching. He coughed lightly before opening the algebra textbook in his hand, \u201cNot sure, I just\u2026\u201d</p><p>He looked at her in the eyes, seeming to be the most gentle things he had ever seen in his life. She was looking back at his brown eyes and bit her lip. Neither knew, but both of their hearts swelled in their chest while holding the other\u2019s gaze, \u201cYou what?\u201d</p><p>Slowly, Peter went from looking at her eyes to her lips then back up. \u201cI just did.\u201d Almost shaking from nerves, Peter started leaning forward when suddenly the door open. Aunt May was standing at the door with a basket of laundry in her hands.</p><p>\u201cOh shit. Sorry Peter. I didn\u2019t know you had a girl over. Hi I\u2019m May. Peter\u2019s aunt.\u201d She looked quickly at Peter who gave her an annoyed look.</p><p>Y/n was still flustered from their previous actions before May walked in and took a moment to register what she said, \u201cOh um. Hi, Im Y/n.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh you\u2019re Y/n. Wow Peter, when you said she was beautiful, you weren\u2019t kidding.\u201d Freaking out at her comment, Peter silently begged for May to walk out the room. </p><p>Through almost closed lips, Peter tried getting his aunt to leave, \u201cAunt May. I didn\u2019t say that.\u201d </p><p>Y/n looked at him with her eyebrows raised not knowing what to say. He looked at her and saw Y/n\u2019s expression change from shocked to hurt, \u201cNo. I mean I did. You are beautiful. But like, Aunt May wasn\u2019t supposed to say anything.\u201d</p><p>Peter gave his aunt another annoyed look and that\u2019s when she finally took the cue to leave. </p><p>\u201cOkay, Im going to order some food. Pizza tonight? Pizza it is.\u201d With that, she left the room, leaving the bedroom door slightly open ajar. </p><p>Peter looked back at Y/n and sighed in relief.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about that.

It takes up alot of time after school and on the weekends so I barely have time to do anything other than school.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you have time for me.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter looked over at Y/n sitting on his bed, she was waiting for a reply to her comment but he didn&rsquo;t know what to say so he nodded and agreed, &ldquo;Yeah, i do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Y/n was eager to know the answer, heart beating harder the longer he took to say something. </p><p>Peter sat on the bed next to her with a textbook and notebook in his hands. His placement had the side of their thighs and knees touching. He coughed lightly before opening the algebra textbook in his hand, &ldquo;Not sure, I just&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>He looked at her in the eyes, seeming to be the most gentle things he had ever seen in his life. She was looking back at his brown eyes and bit her lip. Neither knew, but both of their hearts swelled in their chest while holding the other&rsquo;s gaze, &ldquo;You what?&rdquo;</p><p>Slowly, Peter went from looking at her eyes to her lips then back up. &ldquo;I just did.&rdquo; Almost shaking from nerves, Peter started leaning forward when suddenly the door open. Aunt May was standing at the door with a basket of laundry in her hands.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh shit. Sorry Peter. I didn&rsquo;t know you had a girl over. Hi I&rsquo;m May. Peter&rsquo;s aunt.&rdquo; She looked quickly at Peter who gave her an annoyed look.</p><p>Y/n was still flustered from their previous actions before May walked in and took a moment to register what she said, &ldquo;Oh um. Hi, Im Y/n.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh you&rsquo;re Y/n. Wow Peter, when you said she was beautiful, you weren&rsquo;t kidding.&rdquo; Freaking out at her comment, Peter silently begged for May to walk out the room. </p><p>Through almost closed lips, Peter tried getting his aunt to leave, &ldquo;Aunt May. I didn&rsquo;t say that.&rdquo; </p><p>Y/n looked at him with her eyebrows raised not knowing what to say. He looked at her and saw Y/n&rsquo;s expression change from shocked to hurt, &ldquo;No. I mean I did. You are beautiful. But like, Aunt May wasn&rsquo;t supposed to say anything.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter gave his aunt another annoyed look and that&rsquo;s when she finally took the cue to leave. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay, Im going to order some food. Pizza tonight? Pizza it is.&rdquo; With that, she left the room, leaving the bedroom door slightly open ajar. </p><p>Peter looked back at Y/n and sighed in relief.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry about that. Sometimes she can get a bit&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Much?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. Much is the word. Should we uh, get back to algebra though?&rdquo; Peter glanced back and forth from her face and to the textbook that was still placed back on his lap. Y/n bit her lip again and Peter sucked in a breath when he saw.</p><p>&ldquo;Well we never really started did we. You were about to kiss me.&rdquo; <i>Please kiss me. </i></p><p>Her words were as effective to his actions as candy was to a child; exciting and strong. The change in the amount of tension almost caused Y/n to take back her words but before she could, she felt Peter&rsquo;s lips on hers.</p><p>They were soft against hers; eager yet slow, gentle with the movements but unrestrained with the passion. </p><p>Not knowing what to do next, her hands moved the notebook on her laps to the floor. She fixed her position sitting next to him without breaking the connection to their lips. Her hands went to his head and pulled at the hair in the nape of his neck. </p><p>Too soon, both of them disconnected their lips to catch their breaths. She leaned her forehead on his and smiled. Pulling away, Peter didn&rsquo;t want to let go of her. His hands did not remove themselves from her waist, instead pulling her even closer, &ldquo;Hi.&rdquo;</p><p>She laughed lightly and leaned her head on his shoulder, &ldquo;Hi Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I distracted you.&rdquo; He leaned his cheek on her head and sighed. Relief flushed over them both, stomachs stopped churning but heart rates increased. She laughed again before nudging him on the side with his elbow, &ldquo;Its okay. I liked the distraction. But I guess this means you know I like you?&rdquo;</p><p>He gave her a <i>really?</i> look and they both started laughing. Having one arm around her, he pulled her as close as he could. </p><p>With their feelings established and work still in front of them, they decided to start actually doing what needed to be done. Peter went over the lessons she didn&rsquo;t understand and believe it or not, he was a good teacher. A teacher that would squeeze her side or kiss her cheek every time she got something right.</p><p>~~~</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/midFgWEFHYGVCUknCnVzwWw\">@a&ndash;1&ndash;1&ndash;3</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mluS5c7-L0P7hr4d8e3ymuA\">@fangirlwithasweettooth</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mi0CrOjEe1QlUNWUnHNf9Xw\">@parkerspicedlatte</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muijrDdrp9h8JtKRtxmNfPw\">@jackiehollanderr</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUuw41bfZoVJ3sfjWcJ-2_Q\">@nobodydopeasyou</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mukNM6lELfStKMZtbgwtOew\">@sabrinabernal</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8vUxZR8qg4e8iMYkr_TigQ\">@embrace-themagic</a> |&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdcoi8vVH1xy7VlMm6vJjyg\">@tommyhollander2013</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvFGjFmr2eZXwZw1jK0F5bw\">@mixedfeeelings</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzlYhftDdEGuhJTYK6TpETA\">@personljournal</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mn90wU9L7COhsUuzGPVqUKw\">@awkwardfangirl2014</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFXd-QeGKaC70sheZ_s0YVw\">@lemirabitur</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mo4V_h7k94nmjwN9tEbab1w\">@phenominiallfabiola</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7gBzRTnxNkCtyFs_qv3q7A\">@alisoncdariel</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/myl8NwSy-VImf0qyEsU2duw\">@thatpeterparkerfan</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mv4bTVGtFl9swQ0-7vKgjoA\">@learning-howto-be-myselfx3</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m80fCyPGa1uxGOHHr93cZBA\">@awkward-mystic-beauty</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXCJK3w2sb0toVktGah0yrg\">@myrandom-fandomlife</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgR2pY052AXF42KT-F0YtFw\">@infinity-fandom-trash</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqlmHr_4wBTAoy1gNBqDGRA\">@unicorngummybears</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mu5L_UBhxhyXdTuTgJ0JpnQ\">@ludiclove</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mx1kSHCk4T8i8_T4usoaDZw\">@jollymuffinuniversitypickle</a> |&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkKGpgktw08bufuNJZnqXGw\">@beastounding</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLRtBsdwW9Qk1sLce0Vq_dw\">@undertheheartofjamesmcavoyxd</a> |&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnA0o4eAbx7J0wt3wIgliPQ\">@nicole-lynne</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKoZS_Sy6SeYgxQlHvkP1xg\">@silver-winter-wolf</a> | <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCZEODNhx4EqRG9U6ZsYvkw\">@outerspxce-jillian</a> |</p>",

Just a little tired is all.\u201d</p><p>Normally, Peter wouldn&rsquo;t admit into being tired this easily, especially when he was spending the weekend at the Avengers facility, but the dull pain in his upper abdomen had caught him off guard. Tony narrowed his eyes at him.</p><p>\u201cYou don&rsquo;t have enough gray hair to be tired this early\u201d, he reached over the table and ruffled Peters hair playfully. \u201cYou been out past your bedtime again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo- No, I just, y'know, spider-manning and finals, it&rsquo;s all very&hellip; tiring.\u201d he finishes lamely and drops his gaze when he immediately feels his cheeks heat up. Tony just makes an affirming noise, looking at the boy with fondness in his gaze.</p><p>Tony leans back in his chair, leaving whatever tech he has been meddling with on the table and stretches.</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe we should wrap up for tonight, what do you think?\u201d, not expecting an answer, he addresses FRIDAY. \u201cFRI, how&rsquo;s dinner looking? All done up there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pizza Captain Rogers ordered will arrive in approximately 3 minutes, Boss. I&rsquo;d advise making your way upstairs if you and Mister Parker want to save yourself a slice.\u201d</p><p>Tony claps his hands together and rises from his seat. \u201cYou heard the woman, kid. Let&rsquo;s move before these savages don&rsquo;t leave anything for us. You hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d Peter lies as Mr Stark puts a hand on his back and steers him out of the lab. Especially with his metabolism he did feel hungry most of the time, but today his stomach just wasn&rsquo;t having it. At least the pain in his gut had quietened down for now, so he let Tony lead him into the common area.</p><p>The Avengers, minus Clint and Natasha who were on a mission for SHIELD and Thor who was in Asgard, were already gathered in the living room when they entered. Peter was used to the dozens of pizza cartons by now and usually one of the first to dig in, but today his stomach just gave an unsatisfied growl and he swallowed heavily.</p><p>Peter eventually settled for a piece of hawaii pizza and retreated on the couch next to Wanda.</p><p>Over time he had gotten used to being around the Avengers, even though there was always this little voice in the back of his head that went \u201cOh my god, it&rsquo;s the Avengers\u201d when Thor gave him a pat on the back or Steve called him \u201cson\u201d.</p><p>\u201cWhat&rsquo;s with the spider-kid?\u201d, Sam asks from across the room, throwing an empty water bottle in Peter&rsquo;s general direction. \u201cOi, Spiderbaby, you falling asleep on us?\u201d</p><p>Tony looked up from his conversation with Bruce, frowning at the unusual quietness coming from his kid whose mouth usually ran a mile a minute. Now he was sitting hunched over on the couch, looking unusually pale and clammy.</p><p>\u201cKid, you alright?\u201d he asked and Peter looked up from his untouched piece of Pizza.</p><p>\u201cHuh? Uh, yeah, yeah, I&rsquo;m fine\u201d, he rubbed a hand over his eyes, placing his pizza on the table and his other arm came up to hold his stomach. \u201cJust&hellip; Exhausted, I guess?\u201d</p><p>Tony frowned. \u201cYou sure? You want to turn in early?\u201d</p><p>Peter looked hesitant, but Wanda butted into the conversation. \u201cYou do look tired\u201d, she decided, looking the boy over with observant eyes. \u201cWe can always postpone the movie to tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>Fully expecting the kid to recline, Tony was more than surprised when Peter eventually did give a tired little nod and heaved himself up from the couch, leaving his barely touched pizza behind.</p><p>He said goodnight to the team and shuffled out of the living room, Tony looking after him with a worried frown. The kid was always so eager to spend time at the compound, especially around the other Avengers, so for him to actually turn in this early was a little worrying.</p><p>Tony eventually finished his pizza and the team slowly dispersed. He thought about going back into the lab, but eventually decided to turn in early as well after asking FRIDAY to check on the kid.Tony woke up three hours later to the voice of FRIDAY demanding his attention.</p><hr><p>\u201cIs it Peter?\u201d he asks, voice still rough with sleep as he swung his legs over the edge of the bed.</p><p>\u201cYes, boss.\u201d she affirms and that&rsquo;s all it takes for Tony to hurry down the hall to Peter&rsquo;s room. The kid&rsquo;s not in bed, but the door to the bathroom is cracked and Tony turns on the light.</p><p>\u201cKid?\u201d he opens the door to find Peter on the ground. He&rsquo;s hugging the toilet bowl, face only inches from the seat and his skin glistening with sweat under the bright bathroom light. Tony hurries across the room when Peter raises his head and turns to look at him with red-rimmed eyes.</p><p>\u201cMr Stark?\u201d, he mutters, blinking up at the older man crouching besides him. \u201cWhat are you doin&rsquo; here?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Peter splutters and Tony quickly guides his head back over the toilet bowl before Peter coughs and spits bile into the toilet. He quickly presses his palm to the kid&rsquo;s neck, then feels his forehead and his cheek with the back of his hand.</p><p>\u201cWell, you are definitely running a fever\u201d, he asses, dropping his palm from Peter&rsquo;s face and letting his other hand rest on the kid&rsquo;s back. \u201cFRIDAY told me you were in a bit of distress. By the way, FRI, you wanna get a reading on the kid&rsquo;s temp?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr Parker&rsquo;s temperature reads approximately 100.7\u00b0Fahrenheit, boss\u201d, she answered. \u201cHis symptoms are similar to those of a stomach bug.\u201d</p><p>Tony clicked his tongue and rubbed the kid&rsquo;s back. \u201cYeah, I&rsquo;d say so too.\u201d</p><p>Peter let out a small groan, dropping his head over the bowl again. Tony felt his heart clench with sympathy and moved his hand up to the kid&rsquo;s neck, applying what he hoped was a comforting kind of pressure.</p><p>\u201cYou want to move the party back to your room? Or stay here for another minute?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cM'not sure\u201d, Peter muttered, the hand that was not holding onto the toilet bowl coming up to cage his stomach. \u201cStill feel really nauseous, y'know?\u201d</p><p>Tony nodded and looked around the room for a solution that didn&rsquo;t involve being jammed into the comparatively small bathroom for the rest of the night while still kneading his fingers into the skin of Peter&rsquo;s neck in hopes of bringing some relieve to the kid.</p><p>\u201cTell you what, we move you back to bed and take a bucket, yeah? That way you don&rsquo;t have to get up if you need to hurl again.\u201d he suggested and for a moment Peter looked like he might protest, but then he slumped down again and just nodded at his mentor.</p><p>Tony took this as his cue and heaved himself up on aching muscles to help Peter straighten up. He snuck an arm around the kid&rsquo;s torso and threw Peter&rsquo;s arm over his own shoulder.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAlright, up we go.\u201dTony helped Peter stand and waited for him to regain his balance before slowly shuffling towards the kid&rsquo;s room. Tony quickly took the waste bin from under the sink along and put it down next to the bed.</p><p>\u201cOkay\u201d, Tony sat Peter down on the bed and the kid clumsily climbed under the covers while Tony took a seat on the edge of the bed, a worried frown on his face. \u201cThere.\u201d</p><p>In an automated action he brushed Peter&rsquo;s hair away from his face and felt his forehead again, letting out an unsatisfied hum.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFRIDAY, can you take Peter&rsquo;s temperature again?\u201d</p><p>A second passed before the AI answered. \u201cHis temperature is still at 100.7\u00b0 Fahrenheit, boss. It hasn&rsquo;t changed since you last asked me 10 minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>Tony glared at the ceiling halfheartedly, but it brought him a small chuckle from Peter so he turned back to the kid with his hand still resting on his head.</p><p>\u201cIt&rsquo;s alright, Mr Stark\u201d, he muttered, eyes already fluttering shut again but his face still two shades too pale. \u201cProbably just the pizza. I&rsquo;ll be fine tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat&rsquo;s what you get for eating pineapple on pizza.\u201d</p><p>Peter snickered tiredly and Tony smirked at the teenage boy before running a hand through his hair a last time. \u201cNight, Pete.\u201d</p><p>Tony thought he heard Peter hum an answer into his pillow, but was already closing the door to the bedroom and then retreated back to his own room.\u00a0</p><p>Hopefully his kid would be better in the morning.</p><p><br/><b>My very tiny, very cute taglist of very tiny, very cute people:</b><br/><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0iCdcsEb01EpfuYf_RdKhQ\">@toomuchtoread33</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msso_u5wdayid8RPmp92cFA\">@baloobird</a></p>",

By the way, FRI, you wanna get a reading on the kid\u2019s temp?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr Parker\u2019s temperature reads approximately 100.7\u00b0Fahrenheit, boss\u201d, she answered. \u201cHis symptoms are similar to those of a stomach bug.\u201d</p><p>Tony clicked his tongue and rubbed the kid\u2019s back. \u201cYeah, I\u2019d say so too.\u201d</p><p>Peter let out a small groan, dropping his head over the bowl again. Tony felt his heart clench with sympathy and moved his hand up to the kid\u2019s neck, applying what he hoped was a comforting kind of pressure.</p><p>\u201cYou want to move the party back to your room? Or stay here for another minute?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cM'not sure\u201d, Peter muttered, the hand that was not holding onto the toilet bowl coming up to cage his stomach. \u201cStill feel really nauseous, y'know?\u201d</p><p>Tony nodded and looked around the room for a solution that didn\u2019t involve being jammed into the comparatively small bathroom for the rest of the night while still kneading his fingers into the skin of Peter\u2019s neck in hopes of bringing some relieve to the kid.</p><p>\u201cTell you what, we move you back to bed and take a bucket, yeah? That way you don\u2019t have to get up if you need to hurl again.\u201d he suggested and for a moment Peter looked like he might protest, but then he slumped down again and just nodded at his mentor.</p><p>Tony took this as his cue and heaved himself up on aching muscles to help Peter straighten up. He snuck an arm around the kid\u2019s torso and threw Peter\u2019s arm over his own shoulder.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAlright, up we go.\u201dTony helped Peter stand and waited for him to regain his balance before slowly shuffling towards the kid\u2019s room. Tony quickly took the waste bin from under the sink along and put it down next to the bed.</p><p>\u201cOkay\u201d, Tony sat Peter down on the bed and the kid clumsily climbed under the covers while Tony took a seat on the edge of the bed, a worried frown on his face. \u201cThere.\u201d</p><p>In an automated action he brushed Peter\u2019s hair away from his face and felt his forehead again, letting out an unsatisfied hum.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFRIDAY, can you take Peter\u2019s temperature again?\u201d</p><p>A second passed before the AI answered. \u201cHis temperature is still at 100.7\u00b0 Fahrenheit, boss. It hasn\u2019t changed since you last asked me 10 minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>Tony glared at the ceiling halfheartedly, but it brought him a small chuckle from Peter so he turned back to the kid with his hand still resting on his head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Mr Stark\u201d, he muttered, eyes already fluttering shut again but his face still two shades too pale. \u201cProbably just the pizza. I\u2019ll be fine tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you get for eating pineapple on pizza.\u201d</p><p>Peter snickered tiredly and Tony smirked at the teenage boy before running a hand through his hair a last time. \u201cNight, Pete.\u201d</p><p>Tony thought he heard Peter hum an answer into his pillow, but was already closing the door to the bedroom and then retreated back to his own room.\u00a0</p><p>Hopefully his kid would be better in the morning.</p><p><br><b>My very tiny, very cute taglist of very tiny, very cute people:</b><br><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0iCdcsEb01EpfuYf_RdKhQ\">@toomuchtoread33</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msso_u5wdayid8RPmp92cFA\">@baloobird</a></p>",

Just a little tired is all.\u201d</p><p>Normally, Peter wouldn\u2019t admit into being tired this easily, especially when he was spending the weekend at the Avengers facility, but the dull pain in his upper abdomen had caught him off guard. Tony narrowed his eyes at him.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have enough gray hair to be tired this early\u201d, he reached over the table and ruffled Peters hair playfully. \u201cYou been out past your bedtime again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo- No, I just, y'know, spider-manning and finals, it\u2019s all very\u2026 tiring.\u201d he finishes lamely and drops his gaze when he immediately feels his cheeks heat up. Tony just makes an affirming noise, looking at the boy with fondness in his gaze.</p><p>Tony leans back in his chair, leaving whatever tech he has been meddling with on the table and stretches.</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe we should wrap up for tonight, what do you think?\u201d, not expecting an answer, he addresses FRIDAY. \u201cFRI, how\u2019s dinner looking? All done up there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pizza Captain Rogers ordered will arrive in approximately 3 minutes, Boss. I\u2019d advise making your way upstairs if you and Mister Parker want to save yourself a slice.\u201d</p><p>Tony claps his hands together and rises from his seat. \u201cYou heard the woman, kid. Let\u2019s move before these savages don\u2019t leave anything for us. You hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d Peter lies as Mr Stark puts a hand on his back and steers him out of the lab. Especially with his metabolism he did feel hungry most of the time, but today his stomach just wasn\u2019t having it. At least the pain in his gut had quietened down for now, so he let Tony lead him into the common area.</p><p>The Avengers, minus Clint and Natasha who were on a mission for SHIELD and Thor who was in Asgard, were already gathered in the living room when they entered. Peter was used to the dozens of pizza cartons by now and usually one of the first to dig in, but today his stomach just gave an unsatisfied growl and he swallowed heavily.</p><p>Peter eventually settled for a piece of hawaii pizza and retreated on the couch next to Wanda.</p><p>Over time he had gotten used to being around the Avengers, even though there was always this little voice in the back of his head that went \u201cOh my god, it\u2019s the Avengers\u201d when Thor gave him a pat on the back or Steve called him \u201cson\u201d.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with the spider-kid?\u201d, Sam asks from across the room, throwing an empty water bottle in Peter\u2019s general direction. \u201cOi, Spiderbaby, you falling asleep on us?\u201d</p><p>Tony looked up from his conversation with Bruce, frowning at the unusual quietness coming from his kid whose mouth usually ran a mile a minute. Now he was sitting hunched over on the couch, looking unusually pale and clammy.</p><p>\u201cKid, you alright?\u201d he asked and Peter looked up from his untouched piece of Pizza.</p><p>\u201cHuh? Uh, yeah, yeah, I\u2019m fine\u201d, he rubbed a hand over his eyes, placing his pizza on the table and his other arm came up to hold his stomach. \u201cJust\u2026 Exhausted, I guess?\u201d</p><p>Tony frowned. \u201cYou sure? You want to turn in early?\u201d</p><p>Peter looked hesitant, but Wanda butted into the conversation. \u201cYou do look tired\u201d, she decided, looking the boy over with observant eyes. \u201cWe can always postpone the movie to tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>Fully expecting the kid to recline, Tony was more than surprised when Peter eventually did give a tired little nod and heaved himself up from the couch, leaving his barely touched pizza behind.</p><p>He said goodnight to the team and shuffled out of the living room, Tony looking after him with a worried frown. The kid was always so eager to spend time at the compound, especially around the other Avengers, so for him to actually turn in this early was a little worrying.</p><p>Tony eventually finished his pizza and the team slowly dispersed. He thought about going back into the lab, but eventually decided to turn in early as well after asking FRIDAY to check on the kid.Tony woke up three hours later to the voice of FRIDAY demanding his attention.</p><hr><p>\u201cIs it Peter?\u201d he asks, voice still rough with sleep as he swung his legs over the edge of the bed.</p><p>\u201cYes, boss.\u201d she affirms and that\u2019s all it takes for Tony to hurry down the hall to Peter\u2019s room. The kid\u2019s not in bed, but the door to the bathroom is cracked and Tony turns on the light.</p><p>\u201cKid?\u201d he opens the door to find Peter on the ground. He\u2019s hugging the toilet bowl, face only inches from the seat and his skin glistening with sweat under the bright bathroom light. Tony hurries across the room when Peter raises his head and turns to look at him with red-rimmed eyes.</p><p>\u201cMr Stark?\u201d, he mutters, blinking up at the older man crouching besides him. \u201cWhat are you doin\u2019 here?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Peter splutters and Tony quickly guides his head back over the toilet bowl before Peter coughs and spits bile into the toilet.
