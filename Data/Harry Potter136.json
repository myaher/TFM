It\u2019s not easy being him, but he\u2019s never shown as being helpless or weak. He\u2019s the hero of the damned story, and how many ASD characters are there like that, especially in films at least partly geared towards minors?

He&rsquo;s the hero of the damned story, and how many ASD characters are there like that, especially in films at least partly geared towards minors? (I also found highly endearing the facts that he has an older brother who works for the government who tries to get him to behave, and that he has curly hair and a nice coat he flips up the collars of *wink*)</p><p>2. All the beautiful tweed. SO MUCH TWEED that Mycroft Holmes would have an orgastic paroxysm.</p><p>3. Ballsy themes ranging from parental neglect to an older male sexual predator who gets away with shit because of his power and influence, and the way evil charismatic individuals seek to exploit those with mental health issues.</p><p>4. Beautiful locations and sets. Just gorgeous. Also did I mention the tweed?</p><p>5. Ezra Miller. He didn&rsquo;t wear much tweed, though.</p><p>6. Lovely creatures (duh) who are used enough to warrant the title despite the plot not centering on them. Screen-writing wise I think they were used cleverly.</p><p>7. The films work as movies so particularly well, because they were <i>written</i>&nbsp;to be films. The original books were so damned full of stuff that adapting them must have been a nightmare. Now, nothing needs to be shown just so that fans wouldn&rsquo;t complain it was missing. I cannot assess how much sense the movies would make to someone completely unacquainted with the HP universe but I daresay the Beasts films stand on their own relatively well.</p><p>8. It is sad that we&rsquo;re still at a point where it&rsquo;s progressive that&nbsp;a Hollywood film which many children will see includes a canon gay ship. It was less&nbsp;ambiguous than I expected, so points for that. And for Jude Law for a very nice performance as Dumbledore. I nearly didn&rsquo;t recognise him.</p>",

The way his body free falls into the powdered snow, his open mouth being stuffed with beautiful white ice.</p><p>Fred and George snicker as they lean against the opposite sides of a tree, watching Ron fumble around, lifting his head and spitting snow out of his mouth.</p><p>&ldquo;Fred! George! You foul gits!&rdquo; Ron scrambles to his feet, eyes scanning the premises for the twins. When his eyes zone in on them, he&rsquo;s too late. Another snowball arcs across the air and lands on his face, the impact and his unsteady footing making him fall into the icy sea again.</p><p>The twins let out a sigh and shake their heads in mock sadness.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you think, George?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I dunno, Fred. This one seems to be lacking in the brains department.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Could it be because&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&ndash;we dropped him when he was a baby?&rdquo;</p><p>Ron hobbles to his feet but the twins raise their wands and flick them towards their brother. Snow hovers into the air, forming two round balls before zooming towards the youngest male Weasley. Ron dodges one, but gets slammed right on his forehead with the other.</p><p>Fred sighs. &ldquo;What.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Disappointment,&rdquo; both twins say together.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh leave him alone. You two are bullies.&rdquo; Ginny says as she passes by from feeding the chickens.</p><p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo; Fred speaks up.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s an easy target.&rdquo; George pipes up.</p><p>&ldquo;And besides&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He needs to toughen up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Be a man.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well he can also be a woman.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d still accept him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Little Rona.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ronnie.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Rosemary Alexandria Maria Dorothy Elizabeth Wumpykins.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The Third.&rdquo;</p><p>Ginny shakes her head but she can&rsquo;t help the smile at her older brothers&rsquo; antics. They are so silly, so outrageous. Two identical trouble-makers. Some twins strove hard to be different. But with Fred and George, they seemed to want to be identical in every way possible&hellip;if only to confuse and play pranks on the gullible victims.</p><p>Ron finally manages to get up and he scoops up a handful of snow, eyes focused on the two smirking faces gazing back at him. The twins aren&rsquo;t even moving from their position, their postures relaxed as they stare down their brother, watching as Ron decided who he would aim for.</p><p>Ron&rsquo;s gaze finally lands on George, but as the ball flies towards the younger twin, George merely ducks and straightens, the frozen slush landing on the ground behind him.</p><p>&ldquo;Going to have to do better than that, Ron.&rdquo;</p><p>Fred chuckles but suddenly his face feels cold, the shock of the cold ice making him push himself off the tree, running a hand down his face. Ginny is already scooping up another handful of snow, rolling it around her hands traditionally, without the use of magic.</p><p>&ldquo;SABOTAGE!&rdquo; George bellows, kicking off the tree and running to the side of the yard. He bends down as he runs, filling his hand with snow before chucking it behind him, at his sister.</p><p>But Ginny dodges it easily, sprinting across the snow in chase of her brother. She gasps though when ice hits the back of her neck, some of it rolling down her shirt.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let your guard down, sis!&rdquo; Fred snickers behind her, rolling another ball and aiming for Ron. Said Weasley is scooping up handfuls of snow, rolling them together to create a bigger counter-attack. However, when he throws it, Fred runs diagonally. Thus, Ron&rsquo;s ball meets the ground once again.</p><p>Ron is further annoyed when he hears Fred and George&rsquo;s laughs being carried by the wind. Quickening his pace, Ron closes the gap then hurls his body forward, tackling his older brother to the ground.</p><p>&ldquo;Man down!&rdquo; George shouts, doing a U-turn and running towards his two brothers, who were rolling around. Ginny hurls an attack at her brother and George lets out a strangled cry as the small round ball of ice hits his arm. \u201cAnother man down! Ahhhhh I\u2019m hit, Fred!\u201d George does a dramatic twirl then proceeds to free fall onto the powdery snow, making Ginny laugh at her brother&rsquo;s antics.</p><p>&ldquo;George, NOOOOO!&rdquo; Fred exclaims just as dramatically. With renewed energy, he hurls his younger brother off him and crawls to his twin, the entire scene making the two younger Weasleys snort and chuckle.</p><p>&ldquo;Go on without me, Fred.&rdquo; George says, feigning a cough.</p><p>&ldquo;No! Don&rsquo;t talk like that, George! We still need to nick that singing cauldron from Filch&rsquo;s office and place under Snape&rsquo;s bed!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No&hellip;I&hellip;I can&rsquo;t, Fred. It&rsquo;s too late for me. You need to finish our lifelong goal&hellip;solo.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t accept it! I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Fred clutches his brother&rsquo;s body and Ginny is howling in laughter, clutching her stomach as tears slipped down her cheeks.</p><p>&ldquo;Good&hellip;bye&hellip;Fred.&rdquo; George closes his eyes and his body goes limp.</p><p>&ldquo;NOOOOOOOO!&rdquo; Fred roars in exaggerated slow motion, shaking his fist at the sky.</p><p>&ldquo;Oy! Stop screaming I&rsquo;m trying to sleep!&rdquo; George tells him. In a heartbeat, the younger twin&rsquo;s fingers form into a fist, snow trapped in his hands. Then he slams the ball into his brother&rsquo;s face with a war-cry. Fred drops his twin&rsquo;s body, the cold slush jolting his system. He spits out the snow that got into his mouth and scrambles to his feet, George already running towards the house.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get you for this, George!&rdquo;</p><p>Ron finally manages to land hits on his brothers, but by this point, the siblings are all laughing, tossing balls at each other.</p><p>There&rsquo;s nothing particularly amazing about the moment. Having a snowball fight in the middle of winter is actually the most cliche activity that teenagers could do. But to the siblings, everything in that exact moment feels magical.</p><p>After sometime, the four Weasleys lay on their backs in the snow, each looking at the twilight sky. They&rsquo;re catching their breaths, cheeks flushed, their clothes and hair dusted with snow. Fred found himself wishing for more moments like this\u2026there\u2019s something extraordinary in the most ordinary acts. And everyday should always be made into an extraordinary one.</p><p>\u201cWe should head back inside, mum will be calling for us soon.\u201d Ginny remarks, sitting up and brushing off her coat. </p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m starving.\u201d Ron adds, getting to his feet.</p><p>Fred and George are about to do the same when they hear a voice.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you all doing there? You\u2019ll drag snow into the house and you\u2019ll have to clean up the mess,\u201d comes Percy\u2019s annoyed tone.</p><p>The twins look at each other. A mischievous smile is mirrored in each other\u2019s faces \u2014identical deviants.</p><p>\u201cSay Percy\u2026\u201d Fred says, his hand slowly closing on the snow beneath him. George does the same.</p><p>\u201c\u2026would you care\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026for a\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026snowcone?\u201d</p><p>The twins sit up, reel back their arm and throw their balls. Right into Percy\u2019s irritated face.</p><p>It was glorious. \u00a0</p><p>The slow graceful motion of their uptight brother as the snowball thwacks against his cheek, the skin of his face rippling like a million ocean waves. The way his body free falls into the powdered snow, his open mouth being stuffed with beautiful white ice.</p><p><i>\u201cRun for it, Fred!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cRight behind you, George!\u201d</i></p><hr><p>Happy 2019, guys! :D Cherish every moment with loved ones &lt;3\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://reifromrfa.tumblr.com/post/167006578376/masterlist\">Mystic Messenger Masterlist</a></p><p><a href=\"http://whisperbinder.tumblr.com/post/168561636114/masterlist-of-original-works\">Original Works Masterlist</a></p><p><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fko-fi.com%2Fwhisperbinder&amp;t=M2E3MmRiNjRhZGJmMTFhYzc0NjQ2MTYyYzk3M2RiMzAzYjIxNDZmMyxlYzdkY2M2ZjBiOGExYjQ1MGQ5M2M3MDFmM2QzODFiOGI3YzA1YjIx\">Ko-fi</a> | <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.patreon.com%2Fwhisperbinder&amp;t=NGM5OTcxYTlkYjU4NDJkYTEzMTAyODE4NThiOTU0ZmJiMjM4MmUxNSw1NDc4NWEwZWQ1OTE4OWQwNGUxMjNkYjE1NzQ0OWY4OTYxYTJiMWJm\">Patreon</a> | <a href=\"https://reifromrfa.tumblr.com/post/168241748316/open-for-commissions\">Commissions</a></p>",

The twins aren\u2019t even moving from their position, their postures relaxed as they stare down their brother, watching as Ron decided who he would aim for.</p><p>Ron\u2019s gaze finally lands on George, but as the ball flies towards the younger twin, George merely ducks and straightens, the frozen slush landing on the ground behind him.</p><p>\u201cGoing to have to do better than that, Ron.\u201d</p><p>Fred chuckles but suddenly his face feels cold, the shock of the cold ice making him push himself off the tree, running a hand down his face. Ginny is already scooping up another handful of snow, rolling it around her hands traditionally, without the use of magic.</p><p>\u201cSABOTAGE!\u201d George bellows, kicking off the tree and running to the side of the yard. He bends down as he runs, filling his hand with snow before chucking it behind him, at his sister.</p><p>But Ginny dodges it easily, sprinting across the snow in chase of her brother. She gasps though when ice hits the back of her neck, some of it rolling down her shirt.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let your guard down, sis!\u201d Fred snickers behind her, rolling another ball and aiming for Ron. Said Weasley is scooping up handfuls of snow, rolling them together to create a bigger counter-attack. However, when he throws it, Fred runs diagonally. Thus, Ron\u2019s ball meets the ground once again.</p><p>Ron is further annoyed when he hears Fred and George\u2019s laughs being carried by the wind. Quickening his pace, Ron closes the gap then hurls his body forward, tackling his older brother to the ground.</p><p>\u201cMan down!\u201d George shouts, doing a U-turn and running towards his two brothers, who were rolling around. Ginny hurls an attack at her brother and George lets out a strangled cry as the small round ball of ice hits his arm. \u201cAnother man down! Ahhhhh I\u2019m hit, Fred!\u201d George does a dramatic twirl then proceeds to free fall onto the powdery snow, making Ginny laugh at her brother\u2019s antics.</p><p>\u201cGeorge, NOOOOO!\u201d Fred exclaims just as dramatically. With renewed energy, he hurls his younger brother off him and crawls to his twin, the entire scene making the two younger Weasleys snort and chuckle.</p><p>\u201cGo on without me, Fred.\u201d George says, feigning a cough.</p><p>\u201cNo! Don\u2019t talk like that, George! We still need to nick that singing cauldron from Filch\u2019s office and place under Snape\u2019s bed!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2026I\u2026I can\u2019t, Fred. It\u2019s too late for me. You need to finish our lifelong goal\u2026solo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t accept it! I won\u2019t!\u201d Fred clutches his brother\u2019s body and Ginny is howling in laughter, clutching her stomach as tears slipped down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cGood\u2026bye\u2026Fred.\u201d George closes his eyes and his body goes limp.</p><p>\u201cNOOOOOOOO!\u201d Fred roars in exaggerated slow motion, shaking his fist at the sky.</p><p>\u201cOy! Stop screaming I\u2019m trying to sleep!\u201d George tells him. In a heartbeat, the younger twin\u2019s fingers form into a fist, snow trapped in his hands. Then he slams the ball into his brother\u2019s face with a war-cry. Fred drops his twin\u2019s body, the cold slush jolting his system. He spits out the snow that got into his mouth and scrambles to his feet, George already running towards the house.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you for this, George!\u201d</p><p>Ron finally manages to land hits on his brothers, but by this point, the siblings are all laughing, tossing balls at each other.</p><p>There\u2019s nothing particularly amazing about the moment.

But to the siblings, everything in that exact moment feels magical.</p><p>After sometime, the four Weasleys lay on their backs in the snow, each looking at the twilight sky. They\u2019re catching their breaths, cheeks flushed, their clothes and hair dusted with snow.

You\u2019ll drag snow into the house and you\u2019ll have to clean up the mess,\u201d comes Percy\u2019s annoyed tone.</p><p>The twins look at each other. A mischievous smile is mirrored in each other\u2019s faces \u2014identical deviants.</p><p>\u201cSay Percy\u2026\u201d Fred says, his hand slowly closing on the snow beneath him.

I hope you like it &lt;3&nbsp;</p><p>It was glorious. </p><p>The slow graceful motion of their youngest brother as the snowball thwacks against his cheek, the skin of his face rippling like a million ocean waves. The way his body free falls into the powdered snow, his open mouth being stuffed with beautiful white ice.</p><p>Fred and George snicker as they lean against the opposite sides of a tree, watching Ron fumble around, lifting his head and spitting snow out of his mouth.</p><p>&ldquo;Fred! George! You foul gits!&rdquo; Ron scrambles to his feet, eyes scanning the premises for the twins. When his eyes zone in on them, he&rsquo;s too late. Another snowball arcs across the air and lands on his face, the impact and his unsteady footing making him fall into the icy sea again.</p><p>The twins let out a sigh and shake their heads in mock sadness.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you think, George?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I dunno, Fred. This one seems to be lacking in the brains department.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Could it be because&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&ndash;we dropped him when he was a baby?&rdquo;</p><p>Ron hobbles to his feet but the twins raise their wands and flick them towards their brother. Snow hovers into the air, forming two round balls before zooming towards the youngest male Weasley. Ron dodges one, but gets slammed right on his forehead with the other.</p><p>Fred sighs. &ldquo;What.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Disappointment,&rdquo; both twins say together.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh leave him alone. You two are bullies.&rdquo; Ginny says as she passes by from feeding the chickens.</p><p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo; Fred speaks up.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s an easy target.&rdquo; George pipes up.</p><p>&ldquo;And besides&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He needs to toughen up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Be a man.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well he can also be a woman.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d still accept him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Little Rona.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ronnie.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Rosemary Alexandria Maria Dorothy Elizabeth Wumpykins.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The Third.&rdquo;</p><p>Ginny shakes her head but she can&rsquo;t help the smile at her older brothers&rsquo; antics.
