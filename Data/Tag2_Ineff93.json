It was snowing, so after the angel and the demon paid for their meal at the Ritz, they sang loudly in the Bentley to whatever forgettable not-Queen song was playing on the radio and watched the snow come down rather heavy. The Ritz was planning to close as soon as the last customer paid for their meal and left, and the two were the last customers allowed in. All the employees were antsy, just waiting for the customers to leave so they could go home. The roads had been salted, however the new snow buildup would have a problem with that. The Bentley drove carefully. </p><p>When they got there, the angel miracled-open the lock. The building was dark, and Aziraphale had tried to remember to switch off the lights when he left. He flipped the lightswitch by the door. Nothing happened. </p><p>\u201cSss\u2019 cold in here, angel.\u201d Crowley commented. </p><p>\u201cYes, Crowley, I noticed. Think the power\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>Crowley frowned. </p><p>\u201cCan hardly see anything-\u201d Aziraphale complained, stepping tentatively to walk to the back of the bookshop. Crowley walked over to him, seeing him bright as day, demon eyes, and grabbed Aziraphale\u2019s hand. \u201cThank you, Crowley. But you don\u2019t have to lead-\u201d </p><p>\u201cLittle power outage all it is t\u2019 stop an angel?\u201d Crowley asked. \u201cMight tell Down Below and get a promotion.\u201d Crowley grinned, and stuck his tongue out, but Aziraphale still couldn\u2019t see anything. \u201cHmmph.\u201d Aziraphale complained. </p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you live before electric lights, angel?\u201d</p><p>The angel stopped. \u201cOh. You can let go. Let there be light.\u201d Crowley obliged and let go. Aziraphale gestured with his now-free hand and a bright blue glow encompassed the room. Crowley exhaled through his nose. He really should stop breathing, it was a bad habit, but other people stared if he didn\u2019t breathe. Especially after running, because he\u2019d steal things from Aziraphale\u2019s hands and run down the trail in St. James park so Aziraphale would be annoyed. </p><p>The two walked to the back room and Crowley opened the door. They sat down in some chairs, and Aziraphale buttoned his tweed jacket. Aziraphale remembered to miracle the lock back on the front door. </p><p>\u201cAnything you can do about the heat?\u201d Crowley asked. \u201cEr. Lack thereof.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot really, my dear. I never used to be too annoyed by the weather. Fell asleep in the 1890s, once, the whole room was dreadfully hot when I woke up. Thought I\u2019d lost my Grace for a moment. Tried t\u2019 make it colder, couldn\u2019t do much. Unless you want me to light a candle.\u201d Crowley rolled his eyes. \u201cHrgh. Fine. Guess I\u2019ll suffer.\u201d Crowley squirmed in his seat, swiveled around and put his legs over the armrest, his head leaning uncomfortably on the other armrest. </p><p>Crowley eventually miracled a bottle of something expensive and the two wound up handing it back and forth. Aziraphale had been reading before as Crowley remembered how much fun things were when he wasn\u2019t sober. </p><p>The two complained about the power outage for a while, and Crowley laughed at Aziraphale for not being able to see in the dark. Aziraphale would roll his eyes and say \u201cplease, my dear.\u201d And swat Crowley\u2019s face away. Aziraphale was careful to put the book under the seat so he didn\u2019t spill anything on it. Crowley eventually started complaining about how Aziraphale would tease him for his hiss. He\u2019s pretty much buried it, but when not sober, or quite emotional, he\u2019d hiss. </p><p>They put down the bottles after a while, after Crowley grabbed Aziraphale\u2019s hand when the angel had grabbed the bottle and then the bottle was dropped. Aziraphale cleaned it up and both cleared the alcohol from their bloodstream. Crowley checked his phone and looked at the time. \u201cHow long until the power\u2019s fixed y\u2019 think, angel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot sure, Crowley.\u201d</p><p>The two had known each other for a long time. Sometimes, you could just spend time with someone you know and not say anything because the other\u2019s presence is enough. Rambling about something was a plus. </p><p>Crowley felt agitated. He had got up and paced the room a bit. Aziraphale checked his Nokia. The demon rubbed his sleeves and held his chest with his arms. He\u2019d seen humans comfortable in colder temperatures. Aziraphale watched him and gestured he sit back over by him. Crowley got cold a lot easier than the angel, or most demons for that matter. Snakes were cold blooded, that must\u2019ve factored into it somehow. The cold was bothering him. </p><p>He sat down by Aziraphale\u2019s chair, but on the ground, so the angel rearranged himself to look down at the Adversary. Aziraphale rolled his eyes. \u201cWould you hand me the book under the chair? I put it under the chair to make sure I didn\u2019t spill anything.\u201d Aziraphale breathed. He thought for a moment. \u201cY\u2019know, Crowley, you could go home. No need for you to be all cold here, there\u2019s likely power at your flat.\u201d He looked back down, to see his friend holding up the book. Aziraphale grabbed it, and put it on his lap. He looked at it- Crowley, in snake form, had grabbed the book with his mouth when he handed it to the angel. </p><p>\u201cYou old serpent.\u201d Aziraphale smiled. The angel held out his arm. Crowley slithered onto Aziraphale\u2019s arm. Careful not to constrict it, Crowley hung his head over Aziraphale and the angel held that arm a little bit away from himself. With his other hand, he took the book and opened it. </p><p>\u201cMy dear, I\u2019m going to do some reading. If you could-\u201d Crowley started moving up Aziraphale\u2019s arm and up his shoulder. Aziraphale laughed, and the snake hung himself around his friend\u2019s neck, lying on his shirt and under the collar of the tweed jacket, the sort of like a blanket for Crowley and a scarf for Aziraphale. </p><p>\u201cWell then. You want me to read out loud?\u201d Aziraphale asked. Crowley nodded, and made some hissing noises. </p><p>\u201cRight. In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit\u2026\u201d</p>",

Tried t\u2019 make it colder, couldn\u2019t do much. Unless you want me to light a candle.\u201d Crowley rolled his eyes. \u201cHrgh. Fine. Guess I\u2019ll suffer.\u201d Crowley squirmed in his seat, swiveled around and put his legs over the armrest, his head leaning uncomfortably on the other armrest. </p><p>Crowley eventually miracled a bottle of something expensive and the two wound up handing it back and forth. Aziraphale had been reading before as Crowley remembered how much fun things were when he wasn\u2019t sober. </p><p>The two complained about the power outage for a while, and Crowley laughed at Aziraphale for not being able to see in the dark. Aziraphale would roll his eyes and say \u201cplease, my dear.\u201d And swat Crowley\u2019s face away. Aziraphale was careful to put the book under the seat so he didn\u2019t spill anything on it. Crowley eventually started complaining about how Aziraphale would tease him for his hiss. He\u2019s pretty much buried it, but when not sober, or quite emotional, he\u2019d hiss. </p><p>They put down the bottles after a while, after Crowley grabbed Aziraphale\u2019s hand when the angel had grabbed the bottle and then the bottle was dropped. Aziraphale cleaned it up and both cleared the alcohol from their bloodstream. Crowley checked his phone and looked at the time. \u201cHow long until the power\u2019s fixed y\u2019 think, angel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot sure, Crowley.\u201d</p><p>The two had known each other for a long time. Sometimes, you could just spend time with someone you know and not say anything because the other\u2019s presence is enough. Rambling about something was a plus. </p><p>Crowley felt agitated. He had got up and paced the room a bit. Aziraphale checked his Nokia. The demon rubbed his sleeves and held his chest with his arms. He\u2019d seen humans comfortable in colder temperatures. Aziraphale watched him and gestured he sit back over by him. Crowley got cold a lot easier than the angel, or most demons for that matter. Snakes were cold blooded, that must\u2019ve factored into it somehow. The cold was bothering him. </p><p>He sat down by Aziraphale\u2019s chair, but on the ground, so the angel rearranged himself to look down at the Adversary. Aziraphale rolled his eyes. \u201cWould you hand me the book under the chair? I put it under the chair to make sure I didn\u2019t spill anything.\u201d Aziraphale breathed. He thought for a moment. \u201cY\u2019know, Crowley, you could go home. No need for you to be all cold here, there\u2019s likely power at your flat.\u201d He looked back down, to see his friend holding up the book. Aziraphale grabbed it, and put it on his lap. He looked at it- Crowley, in snake form, had grabbed the book with his mouth when he handed it to the angel. </p><p>\u201cYou old serpent.\u201d Aziraphale smiled. The angel held out his arm. Crowley slithered onto Aziraphale\u2019s arm. Careful not to constrict it, Crowley hung his head over Aziraphale and the angel held that arm a little bit away from himself. With his other hand, he took the book and opened it. </p><p>\u201cMy dear, I\u2019m going to do some reading. If you could-\u201d Crowley started moving up Aziraphale\u2019s arm and up his shoulder. Aziraphale laughed, and the snake hung himself around his friend\u2019s neck, lying on his shirt and under the collar of the tweed jacket, the sort of like a blanket for Crowley and a scarf for Aziraphale. </p><p>\u201cWell then. You want me to read out loud?\u201d Aziraphale asked. Crowley nodded, and made some hissing noises. </p><p>\u201cRight. In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit\u2026\u201d</p>",

It was snowing, so after the angel and the demon paid for their meal at the Ritz, they sang loudly in the Bentley to whatever forgettable not-Queen song was playing on the radio and watched the snow come down rather heavy. The Ritz was planning to close as soon as the last customer paid for their meal and left, and the two were the last customers allowed in. All the employees were antsy, just waiting for the customers to leave so they could go home. The roads had been salted, however the new snow buildup would have a problem with that. The Bentley drove carefully. </p><p>When they got there, the angel miracled-open the lock. The building was dark, and Aziraphale had tried to remember to switch off the lights when he left. He flipped the lightswitch by the door. Nothing happened. </p><p>\u201cSss\u2019 cold in here, angel.\u201d Crowley commented. </p><p>\u201cYes, Crowley, I noticed. Think the power\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>Crowley frowned. </p><p>\u201cCan hardly see anything-\u201d Aziraphale complained, stepping tentatively to walk to the back of the bookshop. Crowley walked over to him, seeing him bright as day, demon eyes, and grabbed Aziraphale\u2019s hand. \u201cThank you, Crowley. But you don\u2019t have to lead-\u201d </p><p>\u201cLittle power outage all it is t\u2019 stop an angel?\u201d Crowley asked. \u201cMight tell Down Below and get a promotion.\u201d Crowley grinned, and stuck his tongue out, but Aziraphale still couldn\u2019t see anything. \u201cHmmph.\u201d Aziraphale complained. </p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you live before electric lights, angel?\u201d</p><p>The angel stopped. \u201cOh. You can let go. Let there be light.\u201d Crowley obliged and let go. Aziraphale gestured with his now-free hand and a bright blue glow encompassed the room. Crowley exhaled through his nose. He really should stop breathing, it was a bad habit, but other people stared if he didn\u2019t breathe. Especially after running, because he\u2019d steal things from Aziraphale\u2019s hands and run down the trail in St. James park so Aziraphale would be annoyed. </p><p>The two walked to the back room and Crowley opened the door. They sat down in some chairs, and Aziraphale buttoned his tweed jacket.
