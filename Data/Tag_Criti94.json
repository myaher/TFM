        "answer": "<p><i>Well, </i>I\u2019m doubtful that it was the Kryn that were kidnapping children. But, there are three possible options as to who was doing it. The Kryn/Xhorhasians, the Assembly, or the Iron Shepherds. I\u2019m not exactly sure which it is yet, but I\u2019m definitely between the Assembly and the Shepherds&ndash; the Kryn seemed focused in on their goal of getting the beacon back, so why would they care about children from the Empire? How would that help them reach their goals?\u00a0</p><p>Besides, let\u2019s look real fast at what we know about the kidnappings and at the geography of the Dwendalian Empire.</p><!-- more --><p>The families and children are known to be missing from Nogvurot. We get this info from the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/HtnTlm6UBpg\">town crier, who attributes it to the Kryn</a>:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Families missing in Nogvurot! Crick kidnappers steal them away in the night! Lock and seal your windows and doors while you slumber!\u201d</p></blockquote><p>and from Darrow, who tells them<a href=\"https://youtu.be/RNOyGusWh3s?t=6294\"> his group was investigating the kidnappings in Nogvurot</a>\u00a0(more on this later).</p><p>So let\u2019s look at the area around Nogvurot (circled in yellow&ndash; note: this is the best quality picture of the map around. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DevenRue/status/959944316260032513\">This video</a> lets you see locations in better quality and is what I used to check illegible names).\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1000\" data-orig-height=\"1000\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bcd315afc6810649b67d6807bd9977e4/tumblr_inline_pozdo790zD1t9lzn7_1280.jpg\" data-orig-width=\"1000\" data-orig-height=\"1000\"/></figure><p>First let\u2019s look at it in terms of the concept that the Xhorhasians are the ones coming across the border to kidnap the children. We don\u2019t know exactly where the border falls but we can approximate based off the geography and what we know about the Empire. The Ashguard Garrison (blue arrow), which fell into Xhorhasian hands, and the Rockguard Garrison (pink arrow) seemed to mark the border, with the Brokenveil Bluffs between them and the Ashkeeper Peaks to the south. The border to the north of the Rockguard Garrison is also marked by mountains, and just past those mountains is a body of water, which means that Xhorhasian lands either end in the mountains or at the coast.\u00a0</p><p>With that in mind, I\u2019ve marked an approximation of the border in yellow here:</p><figure data-orig-width=\"983\" data-orig-height=\"961\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2c15eb04fbb49fd5666317641256dd22/tumblr_inline_pozegakwYh1t9lzn7_1280.png\" data-orig-width=\"983\" data-orig-height=\"961\"/></figure><p>Now, let\u2019s look at the info we have on Xhorhasians crossing the border. The town crier from above mentioned that the Kryn were kidnapping people from Nogvurot. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/lT-wFK4SgJc?t=10842\">Another town crier warned</a>\u00a0\u201cConflict at the Xhorhasian border grows\u2028violent! Watch your children at night!\u201d Matt also says that <a href=\"https://youtu.be/lT-wFK4SgJc?t=12106\">children are being stolen from homesteads\u00a0\u201cclose to the border\u201d</a>. (Keep in mind that all these sources are either directly from the Empire\u2019s criers or info gathered from people who would only have heard from them.)</p><p>But the thing is, Nogvurot? Not close to the border. The dashed white line there shows how far it is from Nogvurot to just north of the Rockguard Garrison, which is really the only place someone would be able to cross over between Xhorhas and the Empire that far north. Even with the ability to tunnel, it\u2019d be a <i>long </i>tunnel to reach all the way to Nogvurot.\u00a0</p><p>We know a Kryn soldier made it to Zadash before the attack on Felderwin, but that seemed more like a small mission sent in to get in and get out&ndash; an operation like stealing children would require a way to transport them at the very least.</p><p>Also, looking at Felderwin, we know the attack there happened primarily to grab Yeza + hopefully the Beacon/his research on it. They had a <i>reason </i>to make that attack. And even if they were trying to steal children, Felderwin is right there, and lots of other towns are closer than Nogvurot. Why would they go almost triple the distance just to steal children in the middle of the night? Why, if they attacked Felderwin <i>and </i>were the people stealing from Nogvurot, would they not steal more than just Yeza from Felderwin? What use would they have for the people?With what we know about the Kryn, it doesn\u2019t really make sense. It\u2019s possible, yes, but&hellip; there\u2019s the big question of <i>why? </i>that hasn\u2019t been answered. And remember all the sources we have saying the Kryn did it are Empire-based, so could just be them blaming it on the Kryn to incite anger and make the war more justified.</p><hr><p>Now moving away from the Kryn being the kidnappers, let\u2019s look at the Assembly and the Shepherds. One thing I want to bring up before them is what <a href=\"https://youtu.be/RNOyGusWh3s?t=6296\">Darrow told the party about the kidnappings</a>:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>Darrow: Well, we\u2019re stationed in Nogvurot, but \u2028we\u2019re from a ways further than that.<br/>Jester: Did you notice any of the kids that were\u2028 missing up there?<br/>Darrow: (sighs) That has been an occasional\u2028 problem, yes. We had been sent to investigate two of those instances and in all of them it seemed to \u2028be that they were stolen\u2013 (stops himself) I\u2019m sorry, I do not know how much I can discuss of these with you.</p></blockquote><p>This was all we got, because Jester crit failed her charisma check, but we do learn two things here. One is that there was a commonality between the way they were stolen in all the cases. The other is that this commonality is not something that is being openly discussed, and is something that he is weary of sharing. I\u2019d imagine if it was evidence damming the Kryn it\u2019d be plastered everywhere, so I\u2019d doubt that that would be the case.</p><hr><p>One possibility regarding this is the Shepherds, of course. Shadycreek Run is right around\u00a0Nogvurot&ndash; while we don\u2019t know the exact location, the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/w6jE3T_ooKw?t=2151\">Gentleman tells them</a> that it\u2019s past the Quannah Breach (underlined in orange), and in the Greying Wildlands (the forest where the yellow circle is located). Thus, it\u2019s around where the yellow circle is on this map.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"658\" data-orig-width=\"1228\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/71f1eeb0bc9305e575969b5356afdf0f/tumblr_inline_pozfvd24Eb1t9lzn7_1280.png\" data-orig-height=\"658\" data-orig-width=\"1228\"/></figure><p>Nogvurot is directly south of this, and the Iron Shepherds are known to travel in this area&ndash; note Hupperdook and the Crispvale Roadway (the Crispvale Thicket being where Nila\u2019s clan is from) as well as Glory Run being labelled in this area.\u00a0</p><p>And, while the Iron Shepherds seem to attack mostly travelers they know they can overtake, we know they attacked Nila\u2019s clan when they were all gathered for a celebration. We don\u2019t know anything about them attacking towns, but it\u2019s possible that they could be the source of the missing families.\u00a0</p><p>If this was the case, the commonality in all of the cases would be something along the lines of what we saw&ndash; the silence spell, the fact that no one hears them scream, them probably disappearing without a single trace. It\u2019d make sense, but there\u2019s not really much of a motivation for them to enter Nogvurot unless they couldn\u2019t find any travelers.\u00a0</p><hr><p>Alright so the Shepherds are a possibility, but what about the theory you\u2019re asking about here&ndash; what about the Assembly?</p><p>Maybe you\u2019ve noticed how close Rexxentrum is to Nogvurot. The\u00a0Soltryce Academy is there, and it\u2019s where a lot of the members of the Assembly are said to be based. Most notably to the Mighty Nein, of course, Ikithon\u2019s there. But the only member of the Assembly that is confirmed to not be based there at least some of the time is Hass, who runs the Halls of\u00a0Erudition in Zadash.\u00a0<br/></p><p>So it\u2019s distinctly possible that the Assembly is sending its people to Nogvurot to find promising young people (young people seem to be a trend here).\u00a0<br/></p><p>If you look where the arrow\u2019s pointing here:<br/></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"260\" data-orig-width=\"656\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2822647be69a8a098afe3f1a031b5ad4/tumblr_inline_pozoepqyUF1t9lzn7_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"260\" data-orig-width=\"656\"/></figure><p>You can see there\u2019s kind of a passage through the trees, a path between Nogvurot and Rexxentrum. It\u2019d make Nogvurot one of the closest towns to Rexxentrum, but most importantly it\u2019d make Nogvurot the closest town to the east, in the direction of Xhorhas. They\u2019d have an easier time blaming kidnappings from Nogvurot on the Kryn than kidnappings from, say, Odessloe or Rexxentrum itself.\u00a0</p><p>Hearing that the Kryn were kidnapping people from Rexxentrum would cause mass panic, because Rexxentrum is the <i>capital. </i>But Nogvurot? It would cause some levels of panic, especially if they were playing it up, but it wouldn\u2019t be unbelievable.\u00a0</p><p>And if <a href=\"https://nottsbuttons.tumblr.com/post/183626018521/theory-the-assembly-isnt-allied-with-anyone-but\">my meta post about the Assembly</a> is right, it\u2019s definitely possible they\u2019d be kidnapping people to either get them on their side or experiment, like they did with Caleb, with boosting power. They might have been seeking out specific kinds of children&ndash; ones with an affinity for Dunimancy. We know that people can have an affinity for it <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VoiceOfOBrien/status/1086161304547602432\">because of the notes in Yeza\u2019s basement</a>:\u00a0\u201cword has found me of Trent finding a few of his proteges have a knack for early dunimancy.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Of course, the Assembly seemed to be using their own students/people for their experiments before this. It\u2019s distinctly possible that they\u2019re kidnapping people because their experiments have progressed past the point of being performed on their own people. Or, because the assembly clearly has long-term plans based off of the notes&ndash;\u00a0\u201cI hope to have this alchemist produce a number of batches over the next <i>twelve to sixteen months\u201d&ndash; </i>it\u2019s possible they\u2019re kidnapping children/younger people so that they can train them for a while before they institute their plan.\u00a0</p><p>Maybe they\u2019ve discovered how to teach people dunimancy but it only works if they start learning at a certain age, so they\u2019re kidnapping children to teach them dunimancy and use them in battle later, which is a terrifying idea.\u00a0</p><p>That\u2019s all speculation at this point, but definitely some sign that the Assembly is connected to this would get Darrow nervous and make him not talk about it. Or even something that just doesn\u2019t make sense&ndash; maybe there seemed to be a specific trait they all shared (an affinity for magic, maybe?) or it seemed to happen from a certain location each time, or around the visits of a certain person (a member of the Assembly, perhaps?)\u00a0</p><hr><p>Tbh I don\u2019t trust the Assembly at all, so I\u2019m probably a little biased in saying that I wouldn\u2019t be <i>surprised </i>if they were connected to this. But at this point I think that until we learn more about Xhorhas and the Assembly and the Empire and the politics between them, we won\u2019t be 100% sure of the source of the kidnappings.</p>",

The\u00a0Soltryce Academy is there, and it\u2019s where a lot of the members of the Assembly are said to be based. Most notably to the Mighty Nein, of course, Ikithon\u2019s there.

It\u2019d make Nogvurot one of the closest towns to Rexxentrum, but most importantly it\u2019d make Nogvurot the closest town to the east, in the direction of Xhorhas. They\u2019d have an easier time blaming kidnappings from Nogvurot on the Kryn than kidnappings from, say, Odessloe or Rexxentrum itself.\u00a0</p><p>Hearing that the Kryn were kidnapping people from Rexxentrum would cause mass panic, because Rexxentrum is the <i>capital. </i>But Nogvurot? It would cause some levels of panic, especially if they were playing it up, but it wouldn\u2019t be unbelievable.\u00a0</p><p>And if <a href=\"https://nottsbuttons.tumblr.com/post/183626018521/theory-the-assembly-isnt-allied-with-anyone-but\">my meta post about the Assembly</a> is right, it\u2019s definitely possible they\u2019d be kidnapping people to either get them on their side or experiment, like they did with Caleb, with boosting power. They might have been seeking out specific kinds of children\u2013 ones with an affinity for Dunimancy. We know that people can have an affinity for it <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VoiceOfOBrien/status/1086161304547602432\">because of the notes in Yeza\u2019s basement</a>:\u00a0\u201cword has found me of Trent finding a few of his proteges have a knack for early dunimancy.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Of course, the Assembly seemed to be using their own students/people for their experiments before this. It\u2019s distinctly possible that they\u2019re kidnapping people because their experiments have progressed past the point of being performed on their own people. Or, because the assembly clearly has long-term plans based off of the notes\u2013\u00a0\u201cI hope to have this alchemist produce a number of batches over the next <i>twelve to sixteen months\u201d\u2013 </i>it\u2019s possible they\u2019re kidnapping children/younger people so that they can train them for a while before they institute their plan.\u00a0</p><p>Maybe they\u2019ve discovered how to teach people dunimancy but it only works if they start learning at a certain age, so they\u2019re kidnapping children to teach them dunimancy and use them in battle later, which is a terrifying idea.\u00a0</p><p>That\u2019s all speculation at this point, but definitely some sign that the Assembly is connected to this would get Darrow nervous and make him not talk about it. Or even something that just doesn\u2019t make sense\u2013 maybe there seemed to be a specific trait they all shared (an affinity for magic, maybe?) or it seemed to happen from a certain location each time, or around the visits of a certain person (a member of the Assembly, perhaps?)\u00a0</p><hr><p>Tbh I don\u2019t trust the Assembly at all, so I\u2019m probably a little biased in saying that I wouldn\u2019t be <i>surprised </i>if they were connected to this. But at this point I think that until we learn more about Xhorhas and the Assembly and the Empire and the politics between them, we won\u2019t be 100% sure of the source of the kidnappings.</p>",

We don\u2019t know exactly where the border falls but we can approximate based off the geography and what we know about the Empire. The Ashguard Garrison (blue arrow), which fell into Xhorhasian hands, and the Rockguard Garrison (pink arrow) seemed to mark the border, with the Brokenveil Bluffs between them and the Ashkeeper Peaks to the south. The border to the north of the Rockguard Garrison is also marked by mountains, and just past those mountains is a body of water, which means that Xhorhasian lands either end in the mountains or at the coast.\u00a0</p><p>With that in mind, I\u2019ve marked an approximation of the border in yellow here:</p><figure data-orig-width=\"983\" data-orig-height=\"961\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2c15eb04fbb49fd5666317641256dd22/tumblr_inline_pozegakwYh1t9lzn7_1280.png\" data-orig-width=\"983\" data-orig-height=\"961\"></figure><p>Now, let\u2019s look at the info we have on Xhorhasians crossing the border.

(Keep in mind that all these sources are either directly from the Empire\u2019s criers or info gathered from people who would only have heard from them.)</p><p>But the thing is, Nogvurot? Not close to the border. The dashed white line there shows how far it is from Nogvurot to just north of the Rockguard Garrison, which is really the only place someone would be able to cross over between Xhorhas and the Empire that far north. Even with the ability to tunnel, it\u2019d be a <i>long </i>tunnel to reach all the way to Nogvurot.\u00a0</p><p>We know a Kryn soldier made it to Zadash before the attack on Felderwin, but that seemed more like a small mission sent in to get in and get out\u2013 an operation like stealing children would require a way to transport them at the very least.</p><p>Also, looking at Felderwin, we know the attack there happened primarily to grab Yeza + hopefully the Beacon/his research on it. They had a <i>reason </i>to make that attack. And even if they were trying to steal children, Felderwin is right there, and lots of other towns are closer than Nogvurot. Why would they go almost triple the distance just to steal children in the middle of the night? Why, if they attacked Felderwin <i>and </i>were the people stealing from Nogvurot, would they not steal more than just Yeza from Felderwin? What use would they have for the people?With what we know about the Kryn, it doesn\u2019t really make sense. It\u2019s possible, yes, but\u2026 there\u2019s the big question of <i>why? </i>that hasn\u2019t been answered. And remember all the sources we have saying the Kryn did it are Empire-based, so could just be them blaming it on the Kryn to incite anger and make the war more justified.</p><hr><p>Now moving away from the Kryn being the kidnappers, let\u2019s look at the Assembly and the Shepherds. One thing I want to bring up before them is what <a href=\"https://youtu.be/RNOyGusWh3s?t=6296\">Darrow told the party about the kidnappings</a>:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>Darrow: Well, we\u2019re stationed in Nogvurot, but \u2028we\u2019re from a ways further than that.<br>Jester: Did you notice any of the kids that were\u2028 missing up there?<br>Darrow: (sighs) That has been an occasional\u2028 problem, yes. We had been sent to investigate two of those instances and in all of them it seemed to \u2028be that they were stolen\u2013 (stops himself) I\u2019m sorry, I do not know how much I can discuss of these with you.</p></blockquote><p>This was all we got, because Jester crit failed her charisma check, but we do learn two things here. One is that there was a commonality between the way they were stolen in all the cases. The other is that this commonality is not something that is being openly discussed, and is something that he is weary of sharing. I\u2019d imagine if it was evidence damming the Kryn it\u2019d be plastered everywhere, so I\u2019d doubt that that would be the case.</p><hr><p>One possibility regarding this is the Shepherds, of course.

Why, if they attacked Felderwin <i>and </i>were the people stealing from Nogvurot, would they not steal more than just Yeza from Felderwin? What use would they have for the people?With what we know about the Kryn, it doesn&rsquo;t really make sense. It&rsquo;s possible, yes, but&hellip; there&rsquo;s the big question of <i>why? </i>that hasn&rsquo;t been answered. And remember all the sources we have saying the Kryn did it are Empire-based, so could just be them blaming it on the Kryn to incite anger and make the war more justified.</p><hr /><p>Now moving away from the Kryn being the kidnappers, let&rsquo;s look at the Assembly and the Shepherds. One thing I want to bring up before them is what <a href=\"https://youtu.be/RNOyGusWh3s?t=6296\">Darrow told the party about the kidnappings</a>:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Darrow: Well, we&rsquo;re stationed in Nogvurot, but &#8232;we&rsquo;re from a ways further than that.<br />Jester: Did you notice any of the kids that were&#8232; missing up there?<br />Darrow: (sighs) That has been an occasional&#8232; problem, yes. We had been sent to investigate two of those instances and in all of them it seemed to &#8232;be that they were stolen&ndash; (stops himself) I&rsquo;m sorry, I do not know how much I can discuss of these with you.</p></blockquote><p>This was all we got, because Jester crit failed her charisma check, but we do learn two things here. One is that there was a commonality between the way they were stolen in all the cases. The other is that this commonality is not something that is being openly discussed, and is something that he is weary of sharing. I&rsquo;d imagine if it was evidence damming the Kryn it&rsquo;d be plastered everywhere, so I&rsquo;d doubt that that would be the case.</p><hr /><p>One possibility regarding this is the Shepherds, of course. Shadycreek Run is right around&nbsp;Nogvurot&ndash; while we don&rsquo;t know the exact location, the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/w6jE3T_ooKw?t=2151\">Gentleman tells them</a> that it&rsquo;s past the Quannah Breach (underlined in orange), and in the Greying Wildlands (the forest where the yellow circle is located). Thus, it&rsquo;s around where the yellow circle is on this map.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/71f1eeb0bc9305e575969b5356afdf0f/tumblr_inline_pozfvd24Eb1t9lzn7_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Nogvurot is directly south of this, and the Iron Shepherds are known to travel in this area&ndash; note Hupperdook and the Crispvale Roadway (the Crispvale Thicket being where Nila&rsquo;s clan is from) as well as Glory Run being labelled in this area.&nbsp;</p><p>And, while the Iron Shepherds seem to attack mostly travelers they know they can overtake, we know they attacked Nila&rsquo;s clan when they were all gathered for a celebration. We don&rsquo;t know anything about them attacking towns, but it&rsquo;s possible that they could be the source of the missing families.&nbsp;</p><p>If this was the case, the commonality in all of the cases would be something along the lines of what we saw&ndash; the silence spell, the fact that no one hears them scream, them probably disappearing without a single trace. It&rsquo;d make sense, but there&rsquo;s not really much of a motivation for them to enter Nogvurot unless they couldn&rsquo;t find any travelers.&nbsp;</p><hr /><p>Alright so the Shepherds are a possibility, but what about the theory you&rsquo;re asking about here&ndash; what about the Assembly?</p><p>Maybe you&rsquo;ve noticed how close Rexxentrum is to Nogvurot. The&nbsp;Soltryce Academy is there, and it&rsquo;s where a lot of the members of the Assembly are said to be based. Most notably to the Mighty Nein, of course, Ikithon&rsquo;s there. But the only member of the Assembly that is confirmed to not be based there at least some of the time is Hass, who runs the Halls of&nbsp;Erudition in Zadash.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>So it&rsquo;s distinctly possible that the Assembly is sending its people to Nogvurot to find promising young people (young people seem to be a trend here).&nbsp;<br /></p><p>If you look where the arrow&rsquo;s pointing here:<br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2822647be69a8a098afe3f1a031b5ad4/tumblr_inline_pozoepqyUF1t9lzn7_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>You can see there&rsquo;s kind of a passage through the trees, a path between Nogvurot and Rexxentrum. It&rsquo;d make Nogvurot one of the closest towns to Rexxentrum, but most importantly it&rsquo;d make Nogvurot the closest town to the east, in the direction of Xhorhas. They&rsquo;d have an easier time blaming kidnappings from Nogvurot on the Kryn than kidnappings from, say, Odessloe or Rexxentrum itself.&nbsp;</p><p>Hearing that the Kryn were kidnapping people from Rexxentrum would cause mass panic, because Rexxentrum is the <i>capital. </i>But Nogvurot? It would cause some levels of panic, especially if they were playing it up, but it wouldn&rsquo;t be unbelievable.&nbsp;</p><p>And if <a href=\"https://nottsbuttons.tumblr.com/post/183626018521/theory-the-assembly-isnt-allied-with-anyone-but\">my meta post about the Assembly</a> is right, it&rsquo;s definitely possible they&rsquo;d be kidnapping people to either get them on their side or experiment, like they did with Caleb, with boosting power. They might have been seeking out specific kinds of children&ndash; ones with an affinity for Dunimancy. We know that people can have an affinity for it <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VoiceOfOBrien/status/1086161304547602432\">because of the notes in Yeza&rsquo;s basement</a>:&nbsp;&ldquo;word has found me of Trent finding a few of his proteges have a knack for early dunimancy.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, the Assembly seemed to be using their own students/people for their experiments before this. It&rsquo;s distinctly possible that they&rsquo;re kidnapping people because their experiments have progressed past the point of being performed on their own people. Or, because the assembly clearly has long-term plans based off of the notes&ndash;&nbsp;&ldquo;I hope to have this alchemist produce a number of batches over the next <i>twelve to sixteen months&rdquo;&ndash; </i>it&rsquo;s possible they&rsquo;re kidnapping children/younger people so that they can train them for a while before they institute their plan.&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe they&rsquo;ve discovered how to teach people dunimancy but it only works if they start learning at a certain age, so they&rsquo;re kidnapping children to teach them dunimancy and use them in battle later, which is a terrifying idea.&nbsp;</p><p>That&rsquo;s all speculation at this point, but definitely some sign that the Assembly is connected to this would get Darrow nervous and make him not talk about it. Or even something that just doesn&rsquo;t make sense&ndash; maybe there seemed to be a specific trait they all shared (an affinity for magic, maybe?) or it seemed to happen from a certain location each time, or around the visits of a certain person (a member of the Assembly, perhaps?)&nbsp;</p><hr /><p>Tbh I don&rsquo;t trust the Assembly at all, so I&rsquo;m probably a little biased in saying that I wouldn&rsquo;t be <i>surprised </i>if they were connected to this. But at this point I think that until we learn more about Xhorhas and the Assembly and the Empire and the politics between them, we won&rsquo;t be 100% sure of the source of the kidnappings.</p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p><i>Well, </i>I&rsquo;m doubtful that it was the Kryn that were kidnapping children. But, there are three possible options as to who was doing it. The Kryn/Xhorhasians, the Assembly, or the Iron Shepherds. I&rsquo;m not exactly sure which it is yet, but I&rsquo;m definitely between the Assembly and the Shepherds&ndash; the Kryn seemed focused in on their goal of getting the beacon back, so why would they care about children from the Empire? How would that help them reach their goals?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Besides, let&rsquo;s look real fast at what we know about the kidnappings and at the geography of the Dwendalian Empire.</p>\n</p>",
