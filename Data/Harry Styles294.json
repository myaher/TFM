Hate cannot drive out hate: only\nlove can do that.\u201d\u00a0</i><i>\u2015 Martin Luther\nKing Jr., A Testament of Hope: The Essential Writings and Speeches</i></p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Gemma asked me for what felt like the\nmillionth time this morning.</p><p>Harry had been gone for a few weeks now while he did the\nSouth American leg of the tour. I was scared and a little nerve wracked on\nbeing without him after Luke showed up but I knew he had a job to do so I had\nto be okay. Gemma, Anne and Grace were taking it in turns to keep me company \u2013\nmore like babysit me \u2013 because Liz had become concerned about my blood pressure\nbeing high and telling me that I should be resting as much as possible. Resting\nwas not easy for me.</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cThe same as the last time you asked.\u201d I said to her as I\nfolded the warm freshly washed pink onesie I had on top of my bump.</p><p>Gemma frowned at me as she continued with her own pile of\nfreshly washed baby clothes while an episode of \u2018friends\u2019 played in the\nbackground. She was good company, I was as close to her as I was to Grace, but\nI was getting sick and tired of being asked if I was okay. If I wasn\u2019t okay,\nthen Nora wasn\u2019t, so the second I felt something was wrong I would let her\nknow. </p><p>All I felt was\u2026 odd. Luke showed up weeks ago, threatened\nto involve himself back into my life, into Nora\u2019s life but he hadn\u2019t since\nuttered a peep. Now he knew that I was pregnant and I still hadn\u2019t managed to\nreceive even one text to ask if I was okay; if Nora was okay. Harry had told me\nnot to worry so much if he was gone then so be it. Maybe Luke had dropped the\nidea and the less he interreacted the better it would be if he were to want\ncustody, but I still couldn\u2019t fight away the little niggle of worry at the back\nof my head that he was going to come back and come back hard.</p><p>\u201cHey, we all just want you and Nora to be okay.\u201d She\nleant over and snatched half of my pile of onesies and just shrugged her\nshoulders when I shot her a glare.</p><p>\u201cI know you do.\u201d I said folding the last onesie I had in\nmy pile. \u201cIt just stresses me out more when people keep asking. I won\u2019t\nhesitate to say if something doesn\u2019t feel right so you don\u2019t need to ask every\nfive minutes.\u201d</p><p>Gemma sighed and nodded her head very reluctantly. We sat\nin silence with only the sound of the television filling the room for a few\nminutes until we were interrupted by a knock on the front door. My brows\nfurrowed in confusion as I glanced over to Gemma. I lived in a gated community so\nit wasn\u2019t often I had someone knocking on my door without receiving a text to\nfrom them first. </p><p>Gemma shrugged her shoulders and I pushed up onto my feet,\nshe tried to get me to stop and sit back down but I just waved my hand at her.\nWith a roll of her eyes she got up and followed my soft steps to the door. It\ncould have been Anne and she had just forgotten her key to get in but that bad\nfeeling a had felt before was back and was churning big storm waves in my\nstomach. </p><p>\u201cEvangeline Jones,\u201d The young boy in the suit asked the\nsecond I pulled the door open. It fit him poorly and he seemed a little nervous\nto ask, his eyes flickering down to my bump that was stretching against the\nmaterial of my tee shirt. </p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said nervously, my hand already shaking at my\nside as I eyed the envelope he had in his hand.</p><p>I knew he was a lawyer, or a lawyer\u2019s intern, without him\nhaving to tell me. I had dealt with many self-righteous assholes in suits for\none lifetime to know without question that\u2019s what this man was. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been served.\u201d I swallowed heavily, already\nknowing that\u2019s what he was here for as he held out the folder papers to me.</p><p>\u201cBy who?\u201d Gemma snapped at the young boy and he recoiled\nbackwards a little at the tone of her voice. She stepped up beside me eyes\nburning holes into the grey suit as I slowly pulled the envelope from the\nlawyer boy\u2019s fingers.</p><p>Nervously he looked between Gemma and I before looking down\nat me. \u201cLuke Williams.\u201d</p><p>Gemma swore under her breath before slamming the door in\nthe lawyer boy\u2019s face. Slowly I stepped back from the door my hands struggling\nto pull the staple keeping the folds of the paper together my hands were\nshaking that badly. My chest was tight and I felt ready to burst into tears. I\nknew this would come but I didn\u2019t think it would hurt this much. </p><p>\u201cEvie, sit down.\u201d Gemma gripped my arm tightly trying to\npull me back to the couch.</p><p>Shaking my head, I shrugged my arm back out of her hold.\n\u201cI need to know what he wants.\u201d</p><p>My fingers were still struggling with the stupid staple\nthat was holding the papers together, my fingernail found grip under the little\nmetal strip and I ripped it not caring if I tore the paper in the process. I felt\nsick as I unfolded the pages with unsteady hands. </p><p>\u201cHe wants custody.\u201d I whispered as my eyes quickly read\nover the words. \u201cHe fucking avoids me for a month then sues me for custody. I\nwould have talked through this with him but he sues me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBreathe Evie,\u201d Gemma stepped forward again her hands gently\nwrapping around my upper arms, traveling them over my hands slowly to soothe me.\n\u201cBreathe and I\u2019ll call Harry.\u201d</p><p>Shaking my head, I tried to take in a deep breathes, to\ncopy her deep breathes, but there was a tightness in my throat that stopped me\nfrom getting any air in. \u201cHe\u2019s on stage.\u201d I chocked.</p><p>My fingers were numb and my eyes were blurring. I felt\nwrong, so, so wrong, my feet felt like jelly and my mind told me that I just\nshouldn\u2019t be standing anymore. Attempting to take in one more breathe I\nclenched my eyes tightly, the dim lights of the front entry stinging my eyes. </p><p>\u201cGem,\u201d I groaned. \u201cYou know how I said if I felt\nsomething was wrong I\u2019d tell you\u2026 somethings wrong.\u201d</p><p>My legs gave out and I felt Gemma grab me tightly to help\nkeep me up. I heard her call my name once in fear before I was enveloped in\ndarkness.</p><p>.-.-.-.</p><p>Harry:</p><p>There was a drop of sweat slipping down my temple as I\nran down the steps and backstage the sounds of thousands of fans still\nscreaming following me. My heart was still pounding a tattoo against my chest,\nlike it always was after the high of performing on stage and doing one of the\nthings I loved most.</p><p>As grateful and happy as I was to be doing what I loved, performing\nto thousands of fans never seemed to distract me from my thoughts on Evie who\nwas thousands upon thousands of miles away from me.</p><p>For years she had been my best friend and she was always\nthe first person I turned to for anything. Whenever I was worried, she was the\none I wanted to talk, when I was upset, it was her that I always called, even\nwhen I was happy or something good happened she was the first that I wanted to\ntell. She was always the first to call me. And all of that made it harder to\nleave her behind when I went on tour.</p><p>As good as this high was it just didn\u2019t feel the same as\nwhen she wasn\u2019t here to enjoy it with. She was his as well now. I\u2019d finally\nmade her my girlfriend, it might have taken a pregnancy to gain the guts to do\nso but I had her and had never felt more in love with anyone. His life was\nperfect. I also had a little baby girl to think about, despite the possibility\nof Nora not being mine, she wouldn\u2019t be loved or spoilt any less.</p><p>It gutted me to leave them behind but I knew that it was\nbetter that they were safe at home. The first leg of the tour was too much for\nEvie, the extra travel wouldn\u2019t have been good for her and with Luke taunting\nher and coming back into her life when her blood pressure was already questionable,\nbeing so far away from home really wasn\u2019t an option for her right now. </p><p>\u201cHarry,\u201d Jeff ran up to me a worried look set deep in his\neyes as he quickly navigated his was through the backstage crew. </p><p>\u201cNot now Jeff, I just want to get back to the hotel and\ncall Evie.\u201d Quickly shrugging back out of my suit jacket I ran towards the\ndressing room to get changed so I could get back to the hotel as quickly as\npossible and check up on Evie.</p><p>\u201cGemma called about twenty minutes ago. She collapsed and\nthey took her to hospital.\u201d Jeff said a little out of breath as he tried to\nkeep up with my hurried pace.</p><p>I stopped in my tracks, my feet feeling heavy with Jeff\u2019s\nwords. My chest was tight and it felt like I couldn\u2019t breathe. Evie\u2019s blood\npressure had been high but not dangerously high enough that it would land her\nin hospital. She was fine at her appointment a few days ago what had happened\nbetween then and now.</p><p>\u201cDid she say what happened?\u201d I asked, sound trying to\ncome up my throat but catching a bit. Reaching up a hand I pulled at the\nbuttons of my shirt to air out my heated chest. It felt ten times hotter now\nthen what it did before. \u201cIs Evie okay?\u201d I added quickly.</p><p>All of the crew were looking at me with fast worried\nglances now and so were the band as the joined us in the hallway. I must have\nlooked like a nervous wreck to get such anxious looks from Sarah and Clare.\nEven Mitch looked like he wanted to come over and check that I was okay.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, she called me from the ambulance and said\nshe was still unconscious. She didn\u2019t say what happened either, she just wanted\nto talk to you.\u201d He swallowed, eyes trying very hard to avoid mine.</p><p>Jeff had my phone in his hand and I quickly grabbed it,\nfinding Gemma\u2019s number and dialling it only a few seconds later. </p><p>\u201cHarry, she said she\u2019d call if anything changed for the\nworse.\u201d Jeff yelled after me but I was to concentrated on the dial tone.</p><p>I was already stressed hearing about Evie and I didn\u2019t\nwant to listen to him or anyone unless it was Gemma, or Evie herself telling me\nthat she was okay. The only thing that could truly calm me now is hearing\nEvie\u2019s soft voice through the phone. </p><p>Jeff hadn\u2019t been the most supportive finding out that I\ncould have gotten Evie pregnant so I didn\u2019t trust how much he truly cared right\nnow. Jeff didn\u2019t hate Evie, he liked her more than any other girl I had been\nwith, he loved her, but he was more worried about what it would my career if\nNora was mine. It didn\u2019t matter either way if she was mine or not because I\nwasn\u2019t going to leave her or Evie. I loved my two girls more than anything. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my fucking girlfriend and daughter and I\u2019m not\ngoing to wait around to find it if they\u2019re okay or not.\u201d My voice was rough and\nloud, my words bouncing of the walls of the hallway. </p><p>Most of the crew turned away after my outburst hurriedly\ngot back to there job, fumbling a little with there haste. Clare, Sarah and\nAdam though stood there looking a little surprised by the declaration but Mitch\njust gave a knowing smile as if he had known all along what was going on\nbetween Evie and I behind closed hotel doors.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t confirmed my relationship with Evie to anyone but\nI also wasn\u2019t keeping it hidden or denying it to anybody that asked. Most of\nthem had become suspicious to it but never actually asked the question. I\nwasn\u2019t sure if they picked up on the daughter comment or not because only Jeff\nknew that current detail.</p><p>\u201cI know that\u2019s why I&rsquo;ve booked you a flight to London.\u201d\nHe started softly, exhaling heavily, \u201cIt leaves in an hour so you need to leave\nnow. You can have a day and a half with her if it isn\u2019t to bad and if it is\ncall me and I&rsquo;ll see if I can rearrange some dates so you can spend more time\nwith her.\u201d He paused for a second before meeting my eyes. \u201cIf it was Glenne I\nwould want to be with her.\u201d</p><p>The phone rang out against my ear and I heard Gemma\u2019s\nmessage tone. Jeff was looking at me sympathetically and I didn\u2019t hate it. I\nbreathed out deeply and raised my hand to rub at my eyes. Jeff was one of my\nbest friends behind Evie so despite his dislike towards the situation we were\nin he was going to support me through it.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I whispered as I dialled Gemma\u2019s number again.\nI wasn\u2019t going to stop ringing until I could talk to her.</p><p>\u201cYeah, just go and make sure that they\u2019re okay.\u201d Jeff\nsaid with a strained smile and a wave of his hand to shake me off. </p><p>\u201cMake sure they\u2019re okay Harry.\u201d Clare said nervously, her\nhands pressed worriedly to her lips. </p><p>Nodding my head at her I turned away from them, running\ntowards the waiting car with my security only a few steps behind me. I still\nhad my suit on but it was the last thing that I was thinking off. All I wanted\nto do was get to Evie and check that her and Nora were okay. </p><p>.-.-.-.</p><p>Evie:</p><p>Shifting in the hospital bed the rough sheets rustled and\nscratched against my skin. I only managed to move a little until the IV drip in\nmy arm caught and I winced as I was tugged backwards. They wanted me to relax\nbut they put me in an uncomfortable bed and stuck a needle in my arm. My bed\nand Harry were what I really wanted but I literally got stuck with a needle. </p><p>\u201cEvie,\u201d A deep voice echoed from my side. A small smile\npulled at my lips at the sound of the voice and I snuggled further into the\nuncomfortable bed at the sound of Harry\u2019s voice. I was probably imagining it but\nit would help to relax me. \u201cEvie,\u201d the voice repeated with a small chuckle.</p><p>Slowly I blinked my eyes open to see a very tired, a very\nreal looking Harry leaning his weight on the bed at my side. It was in that\nmoment I noticed the warmth of his large hand engulfing mine. He was still\nwearing the black button up of some Gucci suit I had seen him wearing on stage before\nall of this happened. It felt like I had only just seen him in it but I had\nbeen in out since I collapsed at the house so I don\u2019t know how long ago since he\nhad been prancing around on stage. I didn\u2019t even know if he was really here or\nif he was just a product of the medication they had put me on to relax. </p><p>\u201cHarry?\u201d I asked my voice scratching up my throat from\nthe misuse. </p><p>\u201cHey Eve\u2019s.\u201d Harry\u2019s jaw tensed as he pulled my hand\ncloser to his lips, gently peppering small kisses over my cold knuckles. There\nwas water in his eyes as he smiled sadly and he gripped my hand tightly as if\nit was a life line and he was holding into me with all that he had.</p><p>\u201cYou should be in Brazil mister,\u201d Lifting my finger from\nhis tight hold I stroked it over his cheek that was covered in a little stubble.</p><p>He chuckled humourlessly and moved his fingers so he\ncould grab my lone one still caressing his cheek and pull it back into his\nstrong grasp. As glad as I was to have him here the biggest disagreement we\nconstantly got into was about his career. This maybe was something we could put\nunder a very different light. If he ended up in hospital I would have been on a\nplane to him the exact second I could have and not a moment later.</p><p>\u201cHad to check that you and Nora were okay.\u201d He sounded\nheartbroken, voice cracking over the few words.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re fine.\u201d Pulling our joined hands down I rested them\nover my chest, savouring the comfort the touch bought. My lips brushed over his\nknuckles quickly and his eyes fluttered closed and he exhaled out heavily.</p><p>Harry opened his eyes back up and I caught the soft green\ncolour before they flickered with something I couldn\u2019t quite pinpoint but it\nwasn\u2019t pleased. \u201cYour blood pressure sky rocketed. You\u2019re lucky that Liz said\nyou\u2019re not preeclamptic. You could have had a stroke, gone into labour early or\nyou could have died if it got any higher.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s jaw tensed and he turned away from me as a tear\nslipped down his cheek. I had already got a run down from Liz earlier though I\nwas still sought of out of it from a sedative they had given me. The stress and\nanxiety I got from getting the papers from Luke\u2019s lawyers caused my blood\npressure to get dangerously high, which was why I fainted and being seven\nmonths pregnant it could cause a number of complications for both me and Nora.</p><p>I didn\u2019t even want to begin to imagine how scared he must\nhave felt finding out what happened and being so far away. But I was okay. Nora\nwas okay. </p><p>\u201cI know, but we\u2019re okay now.\u201d Reaching up I slipped my\nhand back around his jaw and pulled him down so he was looking back at me\nagain. \u201cJust a little dehydrated.\u201d Lifting my arm, I showed him the IV drip and\nhe smiled with a light shake of his head his eyes still showing how he was\nworking through all of this.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he breathed leaning down to press a soft\nkiss to my lips. Mine were chapped and contrasted majorly to the salty tear\nstained soft caress of his.</p><p>My hand cupped his cheek to hold him closer to me as I\ntried to kiss him a little deeper but I still felt the smallest hint of the\nsedative lingering in my veins so my lips were a little sloppier than normal,\nmy hands trying to hold on tightly but came across weakly. Harry laughed, pulling\nback from me but kept close, lips pressing small chaste kisses around my face.\nI had really missed him. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be fucking kidding me.\u201d I jolted at the\nnew voice in the room that came from behind Harry\u2019s quickly tensing body.</p><p>Luke sure had a knack for making the most perfectly timed\nentrances. </p><p>My breath felt stuck in my throat and the airy calmness I\ngot from the sedative was ripped from me with Luke\u2019s entrance. My eyes stayed\nlocked on Harry as he rolled his and tensed above me, his lips setting into a\ntight annoyed line. I gripped a little tighter to Harry\u2019s cheeks, not wanting\nhim to pull back. My heart was hammering against my chest painfully and if\nHarry put his hand over it he would feel every worried beat.</p><p>Instead Harry wrapped his hands around my wrists, fingers\nsoftly caressing the insides where he could feel my pulse. He tugged my hands\nback away from his face even as I shook my head hurriedly. He slipped his hand\ninto mine, squeezing it in reassurance as he turned to look at Luke angrily\nstood in the doorway, he stood in a way that blocked me from Luke\u2019s view and I\nhad to watch the muscles in his back flex.</p><p>\u201cYou have to be fucking kidding me Luke.\u201d Harry said\nequally as annoyed as what Luke was. \u201cShe\u2019s here because of you. You couldn\u2019t\nhave talked to her like a normal person and not freak her out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis has nothing to do with you Harry. I should have\nknown that you\u2019d get straight into bed with her though. You always wanted her.\nYou\u2019ve been waiting for us to blow up so you could swing in and save the day\u201d I\nswallowed hard with Luke\u2019s words, this wasn\u2019t something I wanted to be dealing\nwith now. My heart rate monitor beeping fast was just making me even more\nanxious. </p><p>\u201cGet out Luke. She\u2019s supposed to be resting which you are\nnot helping.\u201d Harry gripped my hand tightly as he turned to look back at the\nmonitor where the screen was flashing red. I tried to take in some deep\nbreathes but it wasn\u2019t helping a single bit.</p><p>\u201cLuke please just go.\u201d I whimpered as I shifted. I felt uncomfortable.\nI wanted to grab the drip and rip it out of my arm even though it would hurt to\npull it out it would be much better than having it in. The clip on my finger\ncould go with it. </p><p>Looking around Harry I watched Luke shake his head and\ncome further into my hospital room. He tired to glance around Harry to see my\nbut Harry stepped into his line of sight every time. \u201cShe\u2019s carrying my baby. I\nhave every right to be here.\u201d</p><p>Harry looked down at me, a questioning gleam in his eyes.\nI still hadn\u2019t told Luke about what had happened between Harry and I after the\nbreak up. I hadn\u2019t really had the chance to say anything, since this was only\nthe second time that I had seen him since the breakup and it wasn\u2019t a\nconversation we had over text.</p><p>Swallowing deeply, I looked away from Harry, I felt small\nunder his look, from the corner of my eye I saw him purse his lips and turn his\nlook towards Luke. \u201cIt\u2019s her body and she doesn\u2019t want you here.\u201d Harry said\ntightly and his grip around my hand matched the one of his voice.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still my baby, I have rights.\u201d</p><p>Watching through squinted eyes I saw Luke step forward\nagain and the warmth of Harry\u2019s hand slipped from around mine as he moved to\nblock Luke from getting to close to me. The heart rate monitor was still beeping\nrapidly, so quickly I thought it might explode. Curling up on the bed I wrapped\nmy arms around my belly, my protective instincts kicking in. Where were the\nnurses?</p><p>\u201cLuke,\u201d I yelled as I watch his hands came up to Harry\u2019s\nchest, his tanned fingers wrapping around the soft material of the button up.\nHarry quickly pushed them back out of the way and stepped to block me more. </p><p>\u201cJust because you\u2019re fucking her doesn\u2019t make you my\nbaby\u2019s father.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s entire body froze with Luke\u2019s comment and I saw\nthat he was struggling to not react to what he said. Normally I could read\nHarry so easily but looking at him from the side now I couldn\u2019t tell what part\nof Luke\u2019s sentence upset him more. The vulgar comment about us having sex or\nthe insult that Nora wasn\u2019t his. </p><p>I wanted to reach out and grab him. I wanted to hug him\nand hold him close while I whispered in his ear that I loved him and so did\nNora. With how much she reacted to Harry\u2019s voice I had no doubt she would be\nHarry\u2019s girl despite who her dad was on paper.</p><p>A small scream leaves my mouth and I quickly move my hand\nup to cover the sound. The room that had been peaceful and quite only moments\nago was now a loud mess. Luke had shoved Harry backwards causing him to knock\nback into the bed, jostling me sharply with the movement. Nurses and security\nrushed into the room at the commotion and Harry was trying to keep his hands\nout of the fight. Harry\u2019s little reaction to the situation didn\u2019t stop Luke and\nhe threw himself at Harry and as he did his fingers caught around the drip, yanking\nit from my arm as he and Harry went tumbling to the hard ground. </p><p>I cried out at the stinging feeling which caused both\nLuke and Harry to freeze on the floor. The pushed at each other as they fought\nto get their feet, eyes sliding over to me as they forgot about each other.\nBoth of them moved to comfort me but Harry moved a second faster, speedily\ngrabbing a bit of gauze, pressing it tightly over the inside of me elbow where\nthe needle just was and it had started to bleed with how roughly it was removed.</p><p>Security had come in at some point, dragging Luke back\nout of the room as he profusely apologised to me, while also trying to get\nsecurity to let him go but they weren\u2019t having it and moments later it was just\nHarry at my side again along with a young nurse.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I whimpered, a steady stream of tears sliding down\nmy cheeks as another security guard wrapped his hand around Harry\u2019s arm and\nstarted to pull him from the room as well.</p><p>\u201cNo, not him.\u201d The nurse said as she pushed a small hand\nagainst the security\u2019s chest to get him to let go of Harry.</p><p>The security guard nodded at her after a short second, he\ngave Harry a look up and down, checking he was doing anything wrong before finally\nleaving the room. I only half registered that Luke was still yelling from outside\nthe room because Harry\u2019s hand pressed down hard on my arm to stop the blood.</p><p>\u201cBreathe Evie,\u201d He said out of breath, fingers massaging\nsoft circles into my elbow.</p><p>My heart was thrashing against my chest, my breathing was\ntight and everything hurt. What the fuck was that. </p><p>The nurse knocked Harry out of her way gently as she took\nmy arm from him, moving so she had her own hand over the gauze. I watched her as\nshe whispered something into Harry ear, he nodded in reply to what she said eyes\nstill locked on me.</p><p>Harry shifted himself up onto the bed, his hip pressing\ninto mine as he reached over my quivering body to take my hand into his own\nshaking one. With his other hand he cupped my cheek, thumb swiping over my\ncheekbone forcing me eyes to stay on him instead of drift over to where the\nnurse was getting ready to put the IV back in.</p><p>\u201cLook at me Evie bear.\u201d He whispered, his breathes slow,\nstructured and deep trying to get me to mimic them but it wasn\u2019t working. It\nfelt like there was a binding around my neck, stopping any air getting in. My\nanxiety had me in choke hold that wasn\u2019t anywhere close to loosening its\nreigns. \u201cTell me about the time you broke your arm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I questioned a little confused to where he was\ngoing. My eyes flickered around the room wondering if he was being serious and\nthe trauma of what happened hadn\u2019t sent me off my rocker.</p><p>\u201cGrace took you to that party, remember?\u201d His hand soothed\nthrough my hair that was resting on the flat pillow. The touch was soft but\nwasn\u2019t enough to stop this crippling anxiety attack.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t tell dad.\u201d I said my mind being drawn back to\none of the most prominent memories I had of my father. \u201cShe lied and said she\nwould take me to see the new Harry Potter because he wouldn\u2019t let her go a\nparty and then one of her friends knocked me down the porch steps and I landed\non my arm.\u201d<i></i></p><p>I smiled a little, a twitch of my lips at most as I leant\ninto Harry\u2019s touch on my cheek. I\u2019d only told him this story once, ages ago\nwhen I first met him, I couldn\u2019t believe that he remembered it. Not only remember\nit but remember how much the memory meant to me.</p><p><i>\u201cPlease don\u2019t tell\ndad.\u201d Grace begged as we rounded the last corner only a few houses from our\nown.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>I frowned looking\ndown at my arm that I kept cradled close to my chest. My tears had long since\ndried up but there was still a stinging pain and an engulfing heat coursing\nthrough my entire arm. It was nowhere near my heart but I swore I felt the beat\nof it around my elbow. I knew it was broken, it had to be there was no way that\nit could possibly hurt this much without being broken.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cI think he\u2019s going\nto notice.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Dad was like a bomb\ndog. He sniffed out when Grace and I were up to something the second we thought\nabout it. It was a surprise that she got this far tonight without him figuring\nout what she had planned.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>I was right as soon\nas we walked through the door we saw dad, just shy of steam coming out of his\nears, angry as he wore a path into mum\u2019s favourite rug in the living area. His\ngaze landed on Grace first eyes flaming, mouth open ready to yell before he\nflicked his heated gaze to me and on my arm. All the anger disappeared from his\neyes in that second.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cGrace, go to bed.\u201d\nHe said sternly, eyes going back to Grace. </i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Grace rolled her\neyes but did as he said, drunkenly stumbling as she made her way to the stairs\nand dad swore under his breath as he watched her. Once Grace had made it half\nway up the stairs dad rushed over to me taking my arm softly in his hands and\nshushing me gently when I whimpered. </i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat happened Evie\nbear?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cAshley was drunk\nand knocked me down the stairs.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Dad frowned, not\nsaying anything back as he helped me out of my jacket. Once my jacket was\npulled off I saw the full extent and dad swore again. It was bright red and\nswollen and I cried out as dad poked it tenderly with his fingers.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cOkay, sweetheart I\nthink we need to go to the hospital.\u201d He grabbed my jacket from where he sat it\ndown and draped it back over my shoulders, quickly going in search of his car\nkeys.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I\ncried grabbing my wrist again to keep my arm safely against my chest.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s not your\nfault Evie bear.\u201d He came over to me, arm looping around my shoulders to pull\nme into a loose hug so he wouldn\u2019t hurt my arm any more. He leaned down so he\nwas height was better matched to mine. Gently he peppered some soft kisses to\nmy forehead that made my tears stop right then and there. \u201cLet\u2019s get you to the\nhospital and get you all better.\u201d</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p>I chocked on a small sob as I clenched my eyes shut. It\nwas five years ago but it could have been yesterday with how prominent the\nmemory was. I could still feel the soft kiss against the side of my head and it\nhelped to relax me. I felt Harry move beside me so he was on the bed and then\nhis lips gently pressed to my temple and I smiled softly.</p><p>\u201cFeel better?\u201d He asked and slowly I opened my eyes back\nup to him.</p><p>Taking in a deep steady breathe I chuckled a little. I\nfelt so much better. Still a little worked up and emotional but I could breathe\nand the heart rate monitor had stopped it\u2019s incessant beeping. Harry was\nsmiling as he moved a hand to rub it over my belly. </p><p>\u201cHow did you know that would calm me down?\u201d</p><p>Harry shrugged, fingers locking with mine as I put them over\nhis. \u201cKnow how much you loved your parents and I wanted you to concentrate on\nsomething else, something good and that made you happy.\u201d</p><p>I chuckled cuddling into as side the best I could with\nthe new drip and the restrictions of the hospital bed. \u201cThat hurt a lot but he\nwas so soft and caring. Cried at the hospital and everything.\u201d I slowed taking\nin a steadying breathe before I continued. \u201cI love you Harry. Thank you for coming.\u201d</p><p>.-.-.-..</p><p>So sorry this took forever to come, I haven\u2019t been motivated at all to edit it this so blame depression, shes a bitch. Next chapter, I am rewriting so it might take a little longer to post, but chapter 9 is almost finished and chapter 10 just needs an update. We\u2019re in the home stretch now, tell me what you think.</p>",

I was scared and a little nerve wracked on\nbeing without him after Luke showed up but I knew he had a job to do so I had\nto be okay. Gemma, Anne and Grace were taking it in turns to keep me company \u2013\nmore like babysit me \u2013 because Liz had become concerned about my blood pressure\nbeing high and telling me that I should be resting as much as possible. Resting\nwas not easy for me.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cThe same as the last time you asked.\u201d I said to her as I\nfolded the warm freshly washed pink onesie I had on top of my bump.</p><p>Gemma frowned at me as she continued with her own pile of\nfreshly washed baby clothes while an episode of \u2018friends\u2019 played in the\nbackground. She was good company, I was as close to her as I was to Grace, but\nI was getting sick and tired of being asked if I was okay. If I wasn\u2019t okay,\nthen Nora wasn\u2019t, so the second I felt something was wrong I would let her\nknow. </p><p>All I felt was\u2026 odd. Luke showed up weeks ago, threatened\nto involve himself back into my life, into Nora\u2019s life but he hadn\u2019t since\nuttered a peep. Now he knew that I was pregnant and I still hadn\u2019t managed to\nreceive even one text to ask if I was okay; if Nora was okay. Harry had told me\nnot to worry so much if he was gone then so be it. Maybe Luke had dropped the\nidea and the less he interreacted the better it would be if he were to want\ncustody, but I still couldn\u2019t fight away the little niggle of worry at the back\nof my head that he was going to come back and come back hard.</p><p>\u201cHey, we all just want you and Nora to be okay.\u201d She\nleant over and snatched half of my pile of onesies and just shrugged her\nshoulders when I shot her a glare.</p><p>\u201cI know you do.\u201d I said folding the last onesie I had in\nmy pile. \u201cIt just stresses me out more when people keep asking. I won\u2019t\nhesitate to say if something doesn\u2019t feel right so you don\u2019t need to ask every\nfive minutes.\u201d</p><p>Gemma sighed and nodded her head very reluctantly. We sat\nin silence with only the sound of the television filling the room for a few\nminutes until we were interrupted by a knock on the front door. My brows\nfurrowed in confusion as I glanced over to Gemma. I lived in a gated community so\nit wasn\u2019t often I had someone knocking on my door without receiving a text to\nfrom them first. </p><p>Gemma shrugged her shoulders and I pushed up onto my feet,\nshe tried to get me to stop and sit back down but I just waved my hand at her.\nWith a roll of her eyes she got up and followed my soft steps to the door. It\ncould have been Anne and she had just forgotten her key to get in but that bad\nfeeling a had felt before was back and was churning big storm waves in my\nstomach. </p><p>\u201cEvangeline Jones,\u201d The young boy in the suit asked the\nsecond I pulled the door open. It fit him poorly and he seemed a little nervous\nto ask, his eyes flickering down to my bump that was stretching against the\nmaterial of my tee shirt. </p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said nervously, my hand already shaking at my\nside as I eyed the envelope he had in his hand.</p><p>I knew he was a lawyer, or a lawyer\u2019s intern, without him\nhaving to tell me. I had dealt with many self-righteous assholes in suits for\none lifetime to know without question that\u2019s what this man was. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been served.\u201d I swallowed heavily, already\nknowing that\u2019s what he was here for as he held out the folder papers to me.</p><p>\u201cBy who?\u201d Gemma snapped at the young boy and he recoiled\nbackwards a little at the tone of her voice. She stepped up beside me eyes\nburning holes into the grey suit as I slowly pulled the envelope from the\nlawyer boy\u2019s fingers.</p><p>Nervously he looked between Gemma and I before looking down\nat me. \u201cLuke Williams.\u201d</p><p>Gemma swore under her breath before slamming the door in\nthe lawyer boy\u2019s face. Slowly I stepped back from the door my hands struggling\nto pull the staple keeping the folds of the paper together my hands were\nshaking that badly. My chest was tight and I felt ready to burst into tears. I\nknew this would come but I didn\u2019t think it would hurt this much. </p><p>\u201cEvie, sit down.\u201d Gemma gripped my arm tightly trying to\npull me back to the couch.</p><p>Shaking my head, I shrugged my arm back out of her hold.\n\u201cI need to know what he wants.\u201d</p><p>My fingers were still struggling with the stupid staple\nthat was holding the papers together, my fingernail found grip under the little\nmetal strip and I ripped it not caring if I tore the paper in the process. I felt\nsick as I unfolded the pages with unsteady hands. </p><p>\u201cHe wants custody.\u201d I whispered as my eyes quickly read\nover the words. \u201cHe fucking avoids me for a month then sues me for custody. I\nwould have talked through this with him but he sues me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBreathe Evie,\u201d Gemma stepped forward again her hands gently\nwrapping around my upper arms, traveling them over my hands slowly to soothe me.\n\u201cBreathe and I\u2019ll call Harry.\u201d</p><p>Shaking my head, I tried to take in a deep breathes, to\ncopy her deep breathes, but there was a tightness in my throat that stopped me\nfrom getting any air in. \u201cHe\u2019s on stage.\u201d I chocked.</p><p>My fingers were numb and my eyes were blurring. I felt\nwrong, so, so wrong, my feet felt like jelly and my mind told me that I just\nshouldn\u2019t be standing anymore. Attempting to take in one more breathe I\nclenched my eyes tightly, the dim lights of the front entry stinging my eyes. </p><p>\u201cGem,\u201d I groaned. \u201cYou know how I said if I felt\nsomething was wrong I\u2019d tell you\u2026 somethings wrong.\u201d</p><p>My legs gave out and I felt Gemma grab me tightly to help\nkeep me up. I heard her call my name once in fear before I was enveloped in\ndarkness.</p><p>.-.-.-.</p><p>Harry:</p><p>There was a drop of sweat slipping down my temple as I\nran down the steps and backstage the sounds of thousands of fans still\nscreaming following me. My heart was still pounding a tattoo against my chest,\nlike it always was after the high of performing on stage and doing one of the\nthings I loved most.</p><p>As grateful and happy as I was to be doing what I loved, performing\nto thousands of fans never seemed to distract me from my thoughts on Evie who\nwas thousands upon thousands of miles away from me.</p><p>For years she had been my best friend and she was always\nthe first person I turned to for anything. Whenever I was worried, she was the\none I wanted to talk, when I was upset, it was her that I always called, even\nwhen I was happy or something good happened she was the first that I wanted to\ntell. She was always the first to call me. And all of that made it harder to\nleave her behind when I went on tour.</p><p>As good as this high was it just didn\u2019t feel the same as\nwhen she wasn\u2019t here to enjoy it with. She was his as well now. I\u2019d finally\nmade her my girlfriend, it might have taken a pregnancy to gain the guts to do\nso but I had her and had never felt more in love with anyone. His life was\nperfect. I also had a little baby girl to think about, despite the possibility\nof Nora not being mine, she wouldn\u2019t be loved or spoilt any less.</p><p>It gutted me to leave them behind but I knew that it was\nbetter that they were safe at home. The first leg of the tour was too much for\nEvie, the extra travel wouldn\u2019t have been good for her and with Luke taunting\nher and coming back into her life when her blood pressure was already questionable,\nbeing so far away from home really wasn\u2019t an option for her right now. </p><p>\u201cHarry,\u201d Jeff ran up to me a worried look set deep in his\neyes as he quickly navigated his was through the backstage crew. </p><p>\u201cNot now Jeff, I just want to get back to the hotel and\ncall Evie.\u201d Quickly shrugging back out of my suit jacket I ran towards the\ndressing room to get changed so I could get back to the hotel as quickly as\npossible and check up on Evie.</p><p>\u201cGemma called about twenty minutes ago. She collapsed and\nthey took her to hospital.\u201d Jeff said a little out of breath as he tried to\nkeep up with my hurried pace.</p><p>I stopped in my tracks, my feet feeling heavy with Jeff\u2019s\nwords. My chest was tight and it felt like I couldn\u2019t breathe. Evie\u2019s blood\npressure had been high but not dangerously high enough that it would land her\nin hospital. She was fine at her appointment a few days ago what had happened\nbetween then and now.</p><p>\u201cDid she say what happened?\u201d I asked, sound trying to\ncome up my throat but catching a bit. Reaching up a hand I pulled at the\nbuttons of my shirt to air out my heated chest. It felt ten times hotter now\nthen what it did before. \u201cIs Evie okay?\u201d I added quickly.</p><p>All of the crew were looking at me with fast worried\nglances now and so were the band as the joined us in the hallway. I must have\nlooked like a nervous wreck to get such anxious looks from Sarah and Clare.\nEven Mitch looked like he wanted to come over and check that I was okay.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, she called me from the ambulance and said\nshe was still unconscious. She didn\u2019t say what happened either, she just wanted\nto talk to you.\u201d He swallowed, eyes trying very hard to avoid mine.</p><p>Jeff had my phone in his hand and I quickly grabbed it,\nfinding Gemma\u2019s number and dialling it only a few seconds later. </p><p>\u201cHarry, she said she\u2019d call if anything changed for the\nworse.\u201d Jeff yelled after me but I was to concentrated on the dial tone.</p><p>I was already stressed hearing about Evie and I didn\u2019t\nwant to listen to him or anyone unless it was Gemma, or Evie herself telling me\nthat she was okay. The only thing that could truly calm me now is hearing\nEvie\u2019s soft voice through the phone. </p><p>Jeff hadn\u2019t been the most supportive finding out that I\ncould have gotten Evie pregnant so I didn\u2019t trust how much he truly cared right\nnow. Jeff didn\u2019t hate Evie, he liked her more than any other girl I had been\nwith, he loved her, but he was more worried about what it would my career if\nNora was mine. It didn\u2019t matter either way if she was mine or not because I\nwasn\u2019t going to leave her or Evie. I loved my two girls more than anything. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my fucking girlfriend and daughter and I\u2019m not\ngoing to wait around to find it if they\u2019re okay or not.\u201d My voice was rough and\nloud, my words bouncing of the walls of the hallway. </p><p>Most of the crew turned away after my outburst hurriedly\ngot back to there job, fumbling a little with there haste. Clare, Sarah and\nAdam though stood there looking a little surprised by the declaration but Mitch\njust gave a knowing smile as if he had known all along what was going on\nbetween Evie and I behind closed hotel doors.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t confirmed my relationship with Evie to anyone but\nI also wasn\u2019t keeping it hidden or denying it to anybody that asked. Most of\nthem had become suspicious to it but never actually asked the question. I\nwasn\u2019t sure if they picked up on the daughter comment or not because only Jeff\nknew that current detail.</p><p>\u201cI know that\u2019s why I\u2019ve booked you a flight to London.\u201d\nHe started softly, exhaling heavily, \u201cIt leaves in an hour so you need to leave\nnow. You can have a day and a half with her if it isn\u2019t to bad and if it is\ncall me and I\u2019ll see if I can rearrange some dates so you can spend more time\nwith her.\u201d He paused for a second before meeting my eyes. \u201cIf it was Glenne I\nwould want to be with her.\u201d</p><p>The phone rang out against my ear and I heard Gemma\u2019s\nmessage tone. Jeff was looking at me sympathetically and I didn\u2019t hate it. I\nbreathed out deeply and raised my hand to rub at my eyes. Jeff was one of my\nbest friends behind Evie so despite his dislike towards the situation we were\nin he was going to support me through it.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I whispered as I dialled Gemma\u2019s number again.\nI wasn\u2019t going to stop ringing until I could talk to her.</p><p>\u201cYeah, just go and make sure that they\u2019re okay.\u201d Jeff\nsaid with a strained smile and a wave of his hand to shake me off. </p><p>\u201cMake sure they\u2019re okay Harry.\u201d Clare said nervously, her\nhands pressed worriedly to her lips. </p><p>Nodding my head at her I turned away from them, running\ntowards the waiting car with my security only a few steps behind me. I still\nhad my suit on but it was the last thing that I was thinking off. All I wanted\nto do was get to Evie and check that her and Nora were okay. </p><p>.-.-.-.</p><p>Evie:</p><p>Shifting in the hospital bed the rough sheets rustled and\nscratched against my skin. I only managed to move a little until the IV drip in\nmy arm caught and I winced as I was tugged backwards. They wanted me to relax\nbut they put me in an uncomfortable bed and stuck a needle in my arm. My bed\nand Harry were what I really wanted but I literally got stuck with a needle. </p><p>\u201cEvie,\u201d A deep voice echoed from my side. A small smile\npulled at my lips at the sound of the voice and I snuggled further into the\nuncomfortable bed at the sound of Harry\u2019s voice. I was probably imagining it but\nit would help to relax me. \u201cEvie,\u201d the voice repeated with a small chuckle.</p><p>Slowly I blinked my eyes open to see a very tired, a very\nreal looking Harry leaning his weight on the bed at my side. It was in that\nmoment I noticed the warmth of his large hand engulfing mine. He was still\nwearing the black button up of some Gucci suit I had seen him wearing on stage before\nall of this happened. It felt like I had only just seen him in it but I had\nbeen in out since I collapsed at the house so I don\u2019t know how long ago since he\nhad been prancing around on stage. I didn\u2019t even know if he was really here or\nif he was just a product of the medication they had put me on to relax. </p><p>\u201cHarry?\u201d I asked my voice scratching up my throat from\nthe misuse. </p><p>\u201cHey Eve\u2019s.\u201d Harry\u2019s jaw tensed as he pulled my hand\ncloser to his lips, gently peppering small kisses over my cold knuckles. There\nwas water in his eyes as he smiled sadly and he gripped my hand tightly as if\nit was a life line and he was holding into me with all that he had.</p><p>\u201cYou should be in Brazil mister,\u201d Lifting my finger from\nhis tight hold I stroked it over his cheek that was covered in a little stubble.</p><p>He chuckled humourlessly and moved his fingers so he\ncould grab my lone one still caressing his cheek and pull it back into his\nstrong grasp. As glad as I was to have him here the biggest disagreement we\nconstantly got into was about his career. This maybe was something we could put\nunder a very different light. If he ended up in hospital I would have been on a\nplane to him the exact second I could have and not a moment later.</p><p>\u201cHad to check that you and Nora were okay.\u201d He sounded\nheartbroken, voice cracking over the few words.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re fine.\u201d Pulling our joined hands down I rested them\nover my chest, savouring the comfort the touch bought. My lips brushed over his\nknuckles quickly and his eyes fluttered closed and he exhaled out heavily.</p><p>Harry opened his eyes back up and I caught the soft green\ncolour before they flickered with something I couldn\u2019t quite pinpoint but it\nwasn\u2019t pleased. \u201cYour blood pressure sky rocketed. You\u2019re lucky that Liz said\nyou\u2019re not preeclamptic. You could have had a stroke, gone into labour early or\nyou could have died if it got any higher.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s jaw tensed and he turned away from me as a tear\nslipped down his cheek. I had already got a run down from Liz earlier though I\nwas still sought of out of it from a sedative they had given me. The stress and\nanxiety I got from getting the papers from Luke\u2019s lawyers caused my blood\npressure to get dangerously high, which was why I fainted and being seven\nmonths pregnant it could cause a number of complications for both me and Nora.</p><p>I didn\u2019t even want to begin to imagine how scared he must\nhave felt finding out what happened and being so far away. But I was okay. Nora\nwas okay. </p><p>\u201cI know, but we\u2019re okay now.\u201d Reaching up I slipped my\nhand back around his jaw and pulled him down so he was looking back at me\nagain. \u201cJust a little dehydrated.\u201d Lifting my arm, I showed him the IV drip and\nhe smiled with a light shake of his head his eyes still showing how he was\nworking through all of this.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he breathed leaning down to press a soft\nkiss to my lips. Mine were chapped and contrasted majorly to the salty tear\nstained soft caress of his.</p><p>My hand cupped his cheek to hold him closer to me as I\ntried to kiss him a little deeper but I still felt the smallest hint of the\nsedative lingering in my veins so my lips were a little sloppier than normal,\nmy hands trying to hold on tightly but came across weakly. Harry laughed, pulling\nback from me but kept close, lips pressing small chaste kisses around my face.\nI had really missed him. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be fucking kidding me.\u201d I jolted at the\nnew voice in the room that came from behind Harry\u2019s quickly tensing body.</p><p>Luke sure had a knack for making the most perfectly timed\nentrances. </p><p>My breath felt stuck in my throat and the airy calmness I\ngot from the sedative was ripped from me with Luke\u2019s entrance. My eyes stayed\nlocked on Harry as he rolled his and tensed above me, his lips setting into a\ntight annoyed line. I gripped a little tighter to Harry\u2019s cheeks, not wanting\nhim to pull back. My heart was hammering against my chest painfully and if\nHarry put his hand over it he would feel every worried beat.</p><p>Instead Harry wrapped his hands around my wrists, fingers\nsoftly caressing the insides where he could feel my pulse. He tugged my hands\nback away from his face even as I shook my head hurriedly. He slipped his hand\ninto mine, squeezing it in reassurance as he turned to look at Luke angrily\nstood in the doorway, he stood in a way that blocked me from Luke\u2019s view and I\nhad to watch the muscles in his back flex.</p><p>\u201cYou have to be fucking kidding me Luke.\u201d Harry said\nequally as annoyed as what Luke was. \u201cShe\u2019s here because of you. You couldn\u2019t\nhave talked to her like a normal person and not freak her out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis has nothing to do with you Harry. I should have\nknown that you\u2019d get straight into bed with her though. You always wanted her.\nYou\u2019ve been waiting for us to blow up so you could swing in and save the day\u201d I\nswallowed hard with Luke\u2019s words, this wasn\u2019t something I wanted to be dealing\nwith now. My heart rate monitor beeping fast was just making me even more\nanxious. </p><p>\u201cGet out Luke. She\u2019s supposed to be resting which you are\nnot helping.\u201d Harry gripped my hand tightly as he turned to look back at the\nmonitor where the screen was flashing red. I tried to take in some deep\nbreathes but it wasn\u2019t helping a single bit.</p><p>\u201cLuke please just go.\u201d I whimpered as I shifted. I felt uncomfortable.\nI wanted to grab the drip and rip it out of my arm even though it would hurt to\npull it out it would be much better than having it in. The clip on my finger\ncould go with it. </p><p>Looking around Harry I watched Luke shake his head and\ncome further into my hospital room. He tired to glance around Harry to see my\nbut Harry stepped into his line of sight every time. \u201cShe\u2019s carrying my baby. I\nhave every right to be here.\u201d</p><p>Harry looked down at me, a questioning gleam in his eyes.\nI still hadn\u2019t told Luke about what had happened between Harry and I after the\nbreak up. I hadn\u2019t really had the chance to say anything, since this was only\nthe second time that I had seen him since the breakup and it wasn\u2019t a\nconversation we had over text.</p><p>Swallowing deeply, I looked away from Harry, I felt small\nunder his look, from the corner of my eye I saw him purse his lips and turn his\nlook towards Luke. \u201cIt\u2019s her body and she doesn\u2019t want you here.\u201d Harry said\ntightly and his grip around my hand matched the one of his voice.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still my baby, I have rights.\u201d</p><p>Watching through squinted eyes I saw Luke step forward\nagain and the warmth of Harry\u2019s hand slipped from around mine as he moved to\nblock Luke from getting to close to me. The heart rate monitor was still beeping\nrapidly, so quickly I thought it might explode. Curling up on the bed I wrapped\nmy arms around my belly, my protective instincts kicking in. Where were the\nnurses?</p><p>\u201cLuke,\u201d I yelled as I watch his hands came up to Harry\u2019s\nchest, his tanned fingers wrapping around the soft material of the button up.\nHarry quickly pushed them back out of the way and stepped to block me more. </p><p>\u201cJust because you\u2019re fucking her doesn\u2019t make you my\nbaby\u2019s father.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s entire body froze with Luke\u2019s comment and I saw\nthat he was struggling to not react to what he said. Normally I could read\nHarry so easily but looking at him from the side now I couldn\u2019t tell what part\nof Luke\u2019s sentence upset him more. The vulgar comment about us having sex or\nthe insult that Nora wasn\u2019t his. </p><p>I wanted to reach out and grab him. I wanted to hug him\nand hold him close while I whispered in his ear that I loved him and so did\nNora. With how much she reacted to Harry\u2019s voice I had no doubt she would be\nHarry\u2019s girl despite who her dad was on paper.</p><p>A small scream leaves my mouth and I quickly move my hand\nup to cover the sound. The room that had been peaceful and quite only moments\nago was now a loud mess. Luke had shoved Harry backwards causing him to knock\nback into the bed, jostling me sharply with the movement. Nurses and security\nrushed into the room at the commotion and Harry was trying to keep his hands\nout of the fight. Harry\u2019s little reaction to the situation didn\u2019t stop Luke and\nhe threw himself at Harry and as he did his fingers caught around the drip, yanking\nit from my arm as he and Harry went tumbling to the hard ground. </p><p>I cried out at the stinging feeling which caused both\nLuke and Harry to freeze on the floor. The pushed at each other as they fought\nto get their feet, eyes sliding over to me as they forgot about each other.\nBoth of them moved to comfort me but Harry moved a second faster, speedily\ngrabbing a bit of gauze, pressing it tightly over the inside of me elbow where\nthe needle just was and it had started to bleed with how roughly it was removed.</p><p>Security had come in at some point, dragging Luke back\nout of the room as he profusely apologised to me, while also trying to get\nsecurity to let him go but they weren\u2019t having it and moments later it was just\nHarry at my side again along with a young nurse.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I whimpered, a steady stream of tears sliding down\nmy cheeks as another security guard wrapped his hand around Harry\u2019s arm and\nstarted to pull him from the room as well.</p><p>\u201cNo, not him.\u201d The nurse said as she pushed a small hand\nagainst the security\u2019s chest to get him to let go of Harry.</p><p>The security guard nodded at her after a short second, he\ngave Harry a look up and down, checking he was doing anything wrong before finally\nleaving the room. I only half registered that Luke was still yelling from outside\nthe room because Harry\u2019s hand pressed down hard on my arm to stop the blood.</p><p>\u201cBreathe Evie,\u201d He said out of breath, fingers massaging\nsoft circles into my elbow.</p><p>My heart was thrashing against my chest, my breathing was\ntight and everything hurt. What the fuck was that. </p><p>The nurse knocked Harry out of her way gently as she took\nmy arm from him, moving so she had her own hand over the gauze. I watched her as\nshe whispered something into Harry ear, he nodded in reply to what she said eyes\nstill locked on me.</p><p>Harry shifted himself up onto the bed, his hip pressing\ninto mine as he reached over my quivering body to take my hand into his own\nshaking one. With his other hand he cupped my cheek, thumb swiping over my\ncheekbone forcing me eyes to stay on him instead of drift over to where the\nnurse was getting ready to put the IV back in.</p><p>\u201cLook at me Evie bear.\u201d He whispered, his breathes slow,\nstructured and deep trying to get me to mimic them but it wasn\u2019t working. It\nfelt like there was a binding around my neck, stopping any air getting in. My\nanxiety had me in choke hold that wasn\u2019t anywhere close to loosening its\nreigns. \u201cTell me about the time you broke your arm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I questioned a little confused to where he was\ngoing. My eyes flickered around the room wondering if he was being serious and\nthe trauma of what happened hadn\u2019t sent me off my rocker.</p><p>\u201cGrace took you to that party, remember?\u201d His hand soothed\nthrough my hair that was resting on the flat pillow. The touch was soft but\nwasn\u2019t enough to stop this crippling anxiety attack.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t tell dad.\u201d I said my mind being drawn back to\none of the most prominent memories I had of my father. \u201cShe lied and said she\nwould take me to see the new Harry Potter because he wouldn\u2019t let her go a\nparty and then one of her friends knocked me down the porch steps and I landed\non my arm.\u201d<i></i></p><p>I smiled a little, a twitch of my lips at most as I leant\ninto Harry\u2019s touch on my cheek. I\u2019d only told him this story once, ages ago\nwhen I first met him, I couldn\u2019t believe that he remembered it. Not only remember\nit but remember how much the memory meant to me.</p><p><i>\u201cPlease don\u2019t tell\ndad.\u201d Grace begged as we rounded the last corner only a few houses from our\nown.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>I frowned looking\ndown at my arm that I kept cradled close to my chest. My tears had long since\ndried up but there was still a stinging pain and an engulfing heat coursing\nthrough my entire arm. It was nowhere near my heart but I swore I felt the beat\nof it around my elbow. I knew it was broken, it had to be there was no way that\nit could possibly hurt this much without being broken.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cI think he\u2019s going\nto notice.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Dad was like a bomb\ndog. He sniffed out when Grace and I were up to something the second we thought\nabout it. It was a surprise that she got this far tonight without him figuring\nout what she had planned.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>I was right as soon\nas we walked through the door we saw dad, just shy of steam coming out of his\nears, angry as he wore a path into mum\u2019s favourite rug in the living area. His\ngaze landed on Grace first eyes flaming, mouth open ready to yell before he\nflicked his heated gaze to me and on my arm. All the anger disappeared from his\neyes in that second.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cGrace, go to bed.\u201d\nHe said sternly, eyes going back to Grace. </i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Grace rolled her\neyes but did as he said, drunkenly stumbling as she made her way to the stairs\nand dad swore under his breath as he watched her. Once Grace had made it half\nway up the stairs dad rushed over to me taking my arm softly in his hands and\nshushing me gently when I whimpered. </i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat happened Evie\nbear?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cAshley was drunk\nand knocked me down the stairs.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Dad frowned, not\nsaying anything back as he helped me out of my jacket. Once my jacket was\npulled off I saw the full extent and dad swore again. It was bright red and\nswollen and I cried out as dad poked it tenderly with his fingers.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cOkay, sweetheart I\nthink we need to go to the hospital.\u201d He grabbed my jacket from where he sat it\ndown and draped it back over my shoulders, quickly going in search of his car\nkeys.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I\ncried grabbing my wrist again to keep my arm safely against my chest.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s not your\nfault Evie bear.\u201d He came over to me, arm looping around my shoulders to pull\nme into a loose hug so he wouldn\u2019t hurt my arm any more. He leaned down so he\nwas height was better matched to mine. Gently he peppered some soft kisses to\nmy forehead that made my tears stop right then and there. \u201cLet\u2019s get you to the\nhospital and get you all better.\u201d</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p>I chocked on a small sob as I clenched my eyes shut. It\nwas five years ago but it could have been yesterday with how prominent the\nmemory was. I could still feel the soft kiss against the side of my head and it\nhelped to relax me. I felt Harry move beside me so he was on the bed and then\nhis lips gently pressed to my temple and I smiled softly.</p><p>\u201cFeel better?\u201d He asked and slowly I opened my eyes back\nup to him.</p><p>Taking in a deep steady breathe I chuckled a little. I\nfelt so much better. Still a little worked up and emotional but I could breathe\nand the heart rate monitor had stopped it\u2019s incessant beeping. Harry was\nsmiling as he moved a hand to rub it over my belly. </p><p>\u201cHow did you know that would calm me down?\u201d</p><p>Harry shrugged, fingers locking with mine as I put them over\nhis. \u201cKnow how much you loved your parents and I wanted you to concentrate on\nsomething else, something good and that made you happy.\u201d</p><p>I chuckled cuddling into as side the best I could with\nthe new drip and the restrictions of the hospital bed. \u201cThat hurt a lot but he\nwas so soft and caring. Cried at the hospital and everything.\u201d I slowed taking\nin a steadying breathe before I continued. \u201cI love you Harry. Thank you for coming.\u201d</p><p>.-.-.-..</p><p>So sorry this took forever to come, I haven\u2019t been motivated at all to edit it this so blame depression, shes a bitch. Next chapter, I am rewriting so it might take a little longer to post, but chapter 9 is almost finished and chapter 10 just needs an update. We\u2019re in the home stretch now, tell me what you think.</p></p>",

Hate cannot drive out hate: only\nlove can do that.\u201d\u00a0</i><i>\u2015 Martin Luther\nKing Jr., A Testament of Hope: The Essential Writings and Speeches</i></p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Gemma asked me for what felt like the\nmillionth time this morning.</p><p>Harry had been gone for a few weeks now while he did the\nSouth American leg of the tour. I was scared and a little nerve wracked on\nbeing without him after Luke showed up but I knew he had a job to do so I had\nto be okay. Gemma, Anne and Grace were taking it in turns to keep me company \u2013\nmore like babysit me \u2013 because Liz had become concerned about my blood pressure\nbeing high and telling me that I should be resting as much as possible. Resting\nwas not easy for me.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cThe same as the last time you asked.\u201d I said to her as I\nfolded the warm freshly washed pink onesie I had on top of my bump.</p><p>Gemma frowned at me as she continued with her own pile of\nfreshly washed baby clothes while an episode of \u2018friends\u2019 played in the\nbackground. She was good company, I was as close to her as I was to Grace, but\nI was getting sick and tired of being asked if I was okay. If I wasn\u2019t okay,\nthen Nora wasn\u2019t, so the second I felt something was wrong I would let her\nknow. </p><p>All I felt was\u2026 odd. Luke showed up weeks ago, threatened\nto involve himself back into my life, into Nora\u2019s life but he hadn\u2019t since\nuttered a peep. Now he knew that I was pregnant and I still hadn\u2019t managed to\nreceive even one text to ask if I was okay; if Nora was okay. Harry had told me\nnot to worry so much if he was gone then so be it. Maybe Luke had dropped the\nidea and the less he interreacted the better it would be if he were to want\ncustody, but I still couldn\u2019t fight away the little niggle of worry at the back\nof my head that he was going to come back and come back hard.</p><p>\u201cHey, we all just want you and Nora to be okay.\u201d She\nleant over and snatched half of my pile of onesies and just shrugged her\nshoulders when I shot her a glare.</p><p>\u201cI know you do.\u201d I said folding the last onesie I had in\nmy pile. \u201cIt just stresses me out more when people keep asking. I won\u2019t\nhesitate to say if something doesn\u2019t feel right so you don\u2019t need to ask every\nfive minutes.\u201d</p><p>Gemma sighed and nodded her head very reluctantly. We sat\nin silence with only the sound of the television filling the room for a few\nminutes until we were interrupted by a knock on the front door. My brows\nfurrowed in confusion as I glanced over to Gemma. I lived in a gated community so\nit wasn\u2019t often I had someone knocking on my door without receiving a text to\nfrom them first. </p><p>Gemma shrugged her shoulders and I pushed up onto my feet,\nshe tried to get me to stop and sit back down but I just waved my hand at her.\nWith a roll of her eyes she got up and followed my soft steps to the door. It\ncould have been Anne and she had just forgotten her key to get in but that bad\nfeeling a had felt before was back and was churning big storm waves in my\nstomach. </p><p>\u201cEvangeline Jones,\u201d The young boy in the suit asked the\nsecond I pulled the door open. It fit him poorly and he seemed a little nervous\nto ask, his eyes flickering down to my bump that was stretching against the\nmaterial of my tee shirt. </p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said nervously, my hand already shaking at my\nside as I eyed the envelope he had in his hand.</p><p>I knew he was a lawyer, or a lawyer\u2019s intern, without him\nhaving to tell me. I had dealt with many self-righteous assholes in suits for\none lifetime to know without question that\u2019s what this man was. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been served.\u201d I swallowed heavily, already\nknowing that\u2019s what he was here for as he held out the folder papers to me.</p><p>\u201cBy who?\u201d Gemma snapped at the young boy and he recoiled\nbackwards a little at the tone of her voice. She stepped up beside me eyes\nburning holes into the grey suit as I slowly pulled the envelope from the\nlawyer boy\u2019s fingers.</p><p>Nervously he looked between Gemma and I before looking down\nat me. \u201cLuke Williams.\u201d</p><p>Gemma swore under her breath before slamming the door in\nthe lawyer boy\u2019s face. Slowly I stepped back from the door my hands struggling\nto pull the staple keeping the folds of the paper together my hands were\nshaking that badly. My chest was tight and I felt ready to burst into tears. I\nknew this would come but I didn\u2019t think it would hurt this much. </p><p>\u201cEvie, sit down.\u201d Gemma gripped my arm tightly trying to\npull me back to the couch.</p><p>Shaking my head, I shrugged my arm back out of her hold.\n\u201cI need to know what he wants.\u201d</p><p>My fingers were still struggling with the stupid staple\nthat was holding the papers together, my fingernail found grip under the little\nmetal strip and I ripped it not caring if I tore the paper in the process. I felt\nsick as I unfolded the pages with unsteady hands. </p><p>\u201cHe wants custody.\u201d I whispered as my eyes quickly read\nover the words. \u201cHe fucking avoids me for a month then sues me for custody. I\nwould have talked through this with him but he sues me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBreathe Evie,\u201d Gemma stepped forward again her hands gently\nwrapping around my upper arms, traveling them over my hands slowly to soothe me.\n\u201cBreathe and I\u2019ll call Harry.\u201d</p><p>Shaking my head, I tried to take in a deep breathes, to\ncopy her deep breathes, but there was a tightness in my throat that stopped me\nfrom getting any air in. \u201cHe\u2019s on stage.\u201d I chocked.</p><p>My fingers were numb and my eyes were blurring. I felt\nwrong, so, so wrong, my feet felt like jelly and my mind told me that I just\nshouldn\u2019t be standing anymore. Attempting to take in one more breathe I\nclenched my eyes tightly, the dim lights of the front entry stinging my eyes. </p><p>\u201cGem,\u201d I groaned. \u201cYou know how I said if I felt\nsomething was wrong I\u2019d tell you\u2026 somethings wrong.\u201d</p><p>My legs gave out and I felt Gemma grab me tightly to help\nkeep me up. I heard her call my name once in fear before I was enveloped in\ndarkness.</p><p>.-.-.-.</p><p>Harry:</p><p>There was a drop of sweat slipping down my temple as I\nran down the steps and backstage the sounds of thousands of fans still\nscreaming following me. My heart was still pounding a tattoo against my chest,\nlike it always was after the high of performing on stage and doing one of the\nthings I loved most.</p><p>As grateful and happy as I was to be doing what I loved, performing\nto thousands of fans never seemed to distract me from my thoughts on Evie who\nwas thousands upon thousands of miles away from me.</p><p>For years she had been my best friend and she was always\nthe first person I turned to for anything. Whenever I was worried, she was the\none I wanted to talk, when I was upset, it was her that I always called, even\nwhen I was happy or something good happened she was the first that I wanted to\ntell. She was always the first to call me. And all of that made it harder to\nleave her behind when I went on tour.</p><p>As good as this high was it just didn\u2019t feel the same as\nwhen she wasn\u2019t here to enjoy it with. She was his as well now. I\u2019d finally\nmade her my girlfriend, it might have taken a pregnancy to gain the guts to do\nso but I had her and had never felt more in love with anyone. His life was\nperfect. I also had a little baby girl to think about, despite the possibility\nof Nora not being mine, she wouldn\u2019t be loved or spoilt any less.</p><p>It gutted me to leave them behind but I knew that it was\nbetter that they were safe at home. The first leg of the tour was too much for\nEvie, the extra travel wouldn\u2019t have been good for her and with Luke taunting\nher and coming back into her life when her blood pressure was already questionable,\nbeing so far away from home really wasn\u2019t an option for her right now. </p><p>\u201cHarry,\u201d Jeff ran up to me a worried look set deep in his\neyes as he quickly navigated his was through the backstage crew. </p><p>\u201cNot now Jeff, I just want to get back to the hotel and\ncall Evie.\u201d Quickly shrugging back out of my suit jacket I ran towards the\ndressing room to get changed so I could get back to the hotel as quickly as\npossible and check up on Evie.</p><p>\u201cGemma called about twenty minutes ago. She collapsed and\nthey took her to hospital.\u201d Jeff said a little out of breath as he tried to\nkeep up with my hurried pace.</p><p>I stopped in my tracks, my feet feeling heavy with Jeff\u2019s\nwords. My chest was tight and it felt like I couldn\u2019t breathe. Evie\u2019s blood\npressure had been high but not dangerously high enough that it would land her\nin hospital. She was fine at her appointment a few days ago what had happened\nbetween then and now.</p><p>\u201cDid she say what happened?\u201d I asked, sound trying to\ncome up my throat but catching a bit. Reaching up a hand I pulled at the\nbuttons of my shirt to air out my heated chest. It felt ten times hotter now\nthen what it did before. \u201cIs Evie okay?\u201d I added quickly.</p><p>All of the crew were looking at me with fast worried\nglances now and so were the band as the joined us in the hallway. I must have\nlooked like a nervous wreck to get such anxious looks from Sarah and Clare.\nEven Mitch looked like he wanted to come over and check that I was okay.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, she called me from the ambulance and said\nshe was still unconscious. She didn\u2019t say what happened either, she just wanted\nto talk to you.\u201d He swallowed, eyes trying very hard to avoid mine.</p><p>Jeff had my phone in his hand and I quickly grabbed it,\nfinding Gemma\u2019s number and dialling it only a few seconds later. </p><p>\u201cHarry, she said she\u2019d call if anything changed for the\nworse.\u201d Jeff yelled after me but I was to concentrated on the dial tone.</p><p>I was already stressed hearing about Evie and I didn\u2019t\nwant to listen to him or anyone unless it was Gemma, or Evie herself telling me\nthat she was okay. The only thing that could truly calm me now is hearing\nEvie\u2019s soft voice through the phone. </p><p>Jeff hadn\u2019t been the most supportive finding out that I\ncould have gotten Evie pregnant so I didn\u2019t trust how much he truly cared right\nnow. Jeff didn\u2019t hate Evie, he liked her more than any other girl I had been\nwith, he loved her, but he was more worried about what it would my career if\nNora was mine. It didn\u2019t matter either way if she was mine or not because I\nwasn\u2019t going to leave her or Evie. I loved my two girls more than anything. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my fucking girlfriend and daughter and I\u2019m not\ngoing to wait around to find it if they\u2019re okay or not.\u201d My voice was rough and\nloud, my words bouncing of the walls of the hallway. </p><p>Most of the crew turned away after my outburst hurriedly\ngot back to there job, fumbling a little with there haste. Clare, Sarah and\nAdam though stood there looking a little surprised by the declaration but Mitch\njust gave a knowing smile as if he had known all along what was going on\nbetween Evie and I behind closed hotel doors.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t confirmed my relationship with Evie to anyone but\nI also wasn\u2019t keeping it hidden or denying it to anybody that asked. Most of\nthem had become suspicious to it but never actually asked the question. I\nwasn\u2019t sure if they picked up on the daughter comment or not because only Jeff\nknew that current detail.</p><p>\u201cI know that\u2019s why I\u2019ve booked you a flight to London.\u201d\nHe started softly, exhaling heavily, \u201cIt leaves in an hour so you need to leave\nnow. You can have a day and a half with her if it isn\u2019t to bad and if it is\ncall me and I\u2019ll see if I can rearrange some dates so you can spend more time\nwith her.\u201d He paused for a second before meeting my eyes. \u201cIf it was Glenne I\nwould want to be with her.\u201d</p><p>The phone rang out against my ear and I heard Gemma\u2019s\nmessage tone. Jeff was looking at me sympathetically and I didn\u2019t hate it. I\nbreathed out deeply and raised my hand to rub at my eyes. Jeff was one of my\nbest friends behind Evie so despite his dislike towards the situation we were\nin he was going to support me through it.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I whispered as I dialled Gemma\u2019s number again.\nI wasn\u2019t going to stop ringing until I could talk to her.</p><p>\u201cYeah, just go and make sure that they\u2019re okay.\u201d Jeff\nsaid with a strained smile and a wave of his hand to shake me off. </p><p>\u201cMake sure they\u2019re okay Harry.\u201d Clare said nervously, her\nhands pressed worriedly to her lips. </p><p>Nodding my head at her I turned away from them, running\ntowards the waiting car with my security only a few steps behind me. I still\nhad my suit on but it was the last thing that I was thinking off. All I wanted\nto do was get to Evie and check that her and Nora were okay. </p><p>.-.-.-.</p><p>Evie:</p><p>Shifting in the hospital bed the rough sheets rustled and\nscratched against my skin. I only managed to move a little until the IV drip in\nmy arm caught and I winced as I was tugged backwards. They wanted me to relax\nbut they put me in an uncomfortable bed and stuck a needle in my arm. My bed\nand Harry were what I really wanted but I literally got stuck with a needle. </p><p>\u201cEvie,\u201d A deep voice echoed from my side. A small smile\npulled at my lips at the sound of the voice and I snuggled further into the\nuncomfortable bed at the sound of Harry\u2019s voice. I was probably imagining it but\nit would help to relax me. \u201cEvie,\u201d the voice repeated with a small chuckle.</p><p>Slowly I blinked my eyes open to see a very tired, a very\nreal looking Harry leaning his weight on the bed at my side. It was in that\nmoment I noticed the warmth of his large hand engulfing mine. He was still\nwearing the black button up of some Gucci suit I had seen him wearing on stage before\nall of this happened. It felt like I had only just seen him in it but I had\nbeen in out since I collapsed at the house so I don\u2019t know how long ago since he\nhad been prancing around on stage. I didn\u2019t even know if he was really here or\nif he was just a product of the medication they had put me on to relax. </p><p>\u201cHarry?\u201d I asked my voice scratching up my throat from\nthe misuse. </p><p>\u201cHey Eve\u2019s.\u201d Harry\u2019s jaw tensed as he pulled my hand\ncloser to his lips, gently peppering small kisses over my cold knuckles. There\nwas water in his eyes as he smiled sadly and he gripped my hand tightly as if\nit was a life line and he was holding into me with all that he had.</p><p>\u201cYou should be in Brazil mister,\u201d Lifting my finger from\nhis tight hold I stroked it over his cheek that was covered in a little stubble.</p><p>He chuckled humourlessly and moved his fingers so he\ncould grab my lone one still caressing his cheek and pull it back into his\nstrong grasp. As glad as I was to have him here the biggest disagreement we\nconstantly got into was about his career. This maybe was something we could put\nunder a very different light. If he ended up in hospital I would have been on a\nplane to him the exact second I could have and not a moment later.</p><p>\u201cHad to check that you and Nora were okay.\u201d He sounded\nheartbroken, voice cracking over the few words.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re fine.\u201d Pulling our joined hands down I rested them\nover my chest, savouring the comfort the touch bought. My lips brushed over his\nknuckles quickly and his eyes fluttered closed and he exhaled out heavily.</p><p>Harry opened his eyes back up and I caught the soft green\ncolour before they flickered with something I couldn\u2019t quite pinpoint but it\nwasn\u2019t pleased. \u201cYour blood pressure sky rocketed. You\u2019re lucky that Liz said\nyou\u2019re not preeclamptic. You could have had a stroke, gone into labour early or\nyou could have died if it got any higher.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s jaw tensed and he turned away from me as a tear\nslipped down his cheek. I had already got a run down from Liz earlier though I\nwas still sought of out of it from a sedative they had given me. The stress and\nanxiety I got from getting the papers from Luke\u2019s lawyers caused my blood\npressure to get dangerously high, which was why I fainted and being seven\nmonths pregnant it could cause a number of complications for both me and Nora.</p><p>I didn\u2019t even want to begin to imagine how scared he must\nhave felt finding out what happened and being so far away. But I was okay. Nora\nwas okay. </p><p>\u201cI know, but we\u2019re okay now.\u201d Reaching up I slipped my\nhand back around his jaw and pulled him down so he was looking back at me\nagain. \u201cJust a little dehydrated.\u201d Lifting my arm, I showed him the IV drip and\nhe smiled with a light shake of his head his eyes still showing how he was\nworking through all of this.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he breathed leaning down to press a soft\nkiss to my lips. Mine were chapped and contrasted majorly to the salty tear\nstained soft caress of his.</p><p>My hand cupped his cheek to hold him closer to me as I\ntried to kiss him a little deeper but I still felt the smallest hint of the\nsedative lingering in my veins so my lips were a little sloppier than normal,\nmy hands trying to hold on tightly but came across weakly. Harry laughed, pulling\nback from me but kept close, lips pressing small chaste kisses around my face.\nI had really missed him. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be fucking kidding me.\u201d I jolted at the\nnew voice in the room that came from behind Harry\u2019s quickly tensing body.</p><p>Luke sure had a knack for making the most perfectly timed\nentrances. </p><p>My breath felt stuck in my throat and the airy calmness I\ngot from the sedative was ripped from me with Luke\u2019s entrance. My eyes stayed\nlocked on Harry as he rolled his and tensed above me, his lips setting into a\ntight annoyed line. I gripped a little tighter to Harry\u2019s cheeks, not wanting\nhim to pull back. My heart was hammering against my chest painfully and if\nHarry put his hand over it he would feel every worried beat.</p><p>Instead Harry wrapped his hands around my wrists, fingers\nsoftly caressing the insides where he could feel my pulse. He tugged my hands\nback away from his face even as I shook my head hurriedly. He slipped his hand\ninto mine, squeezing it in reassurance as he turned to look at Luke angrily\nstood in the doorway, he stood in a way that blocked me from Luke\u2019s view and I\nhad to watch the muscles in his back flex.</p><p>\u201cYou have to be fucking kidding me Luke.\u201d Harry said\nequally as annoyed as what Luke was. \u201cShe\u2019s here because of you. You couldn\u2019t\nhave talked to her like a normal person and not freak her out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis has nothing to do with you Harry. I should have\nknown that you\u2019d get straight into bed with her though. You always wanted her.\nYou\u2019ve been waiting for us to blow up so you could swing in and save the day\u201d I\nswallowed hard with Luke\u2019s words, this wasn\u2019t something I wanted to be dealing\nwith now. My heart rate monitor beeping fast was just making me even more\nanxious. </p><p>\u201cGet out Luke. She\u2019s supposed to be resting which you are\nnot helping.\u201d Harry gripped my hand tightly as he turned to look back at the\nmonitor where the screen was flashing red. I tried to take in some deep\nbreathes but it wasn\u2019t helping a single bit.</p><p>\u201cLuke please just go.\u201d I whimpered as I shifted. I felt uncomfortable.\nI wanted to grab the drip and rip it out of my arm even though it would hurt to\npull it out it would be much better than having it in. The clip on my finger\ncould go with it. </p><p>Looking around Harry I watched Luke shake his head and\ncome further into my hospital room. He tired to glance around Harry to see my\nbut Harry stepped into his line of sight every time. \u201cShe\u2019s carrying my baby. I\nhave every right to be here.\u201d</p><p>Harry looked down at me, a questioning gleam in his eyes.\nI still hadn\u2019t told Luke about what had happened between Harry and I after the\nbreak up. I hadn\u2019t really had the chance to say anything, since this was only\nthe second time that I had seen him since the breakup and it wasn\u2019t a\nconversation we had over text.</p><p>Swallowing deeply, I looked away from Harry, I felt small\nunder his look, from the corner of my eye I saw him purse his lips and turn his\nlook towards Luke. \u201cIt\u2019s her body and she doesn\u2019t want you here.\u201d Harry said\ntightly and his grip around my hand matched the one of his voice.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still my baby, I have rights.\u201d</p><p>Watching through squinted eyes I saw Luke step forward\nagain and the warmth of Harry\u2019s hand slipped from around mine as he moved to\nblock Luke from getting to close to me. The heart rate monitor was still beeping\nrapidly, so quickly I thought it might explode. Curling up on the bed I wrapped\nmy arms around my belly, my protective instincts kicking in. Where were the\nnurses?</p><p>\u201cLuke,\u201d I yelled as I watch his hands came up to Harry\u2019s\nchest, his tanned fingers wrapping around the soft material of the button up.\nHarry quickly pushed them back out of the way and stepped to block me more. </p><p>\u201cJust because you\u2019re fucking her doesn\u2019t make you my\nbaby\u2019s father.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s entire body froze with Luke\u2019s comment and I saw\nthat he was struggling to not react to what he said. Normally I could read\nHarry so easily but looking at him from the side now I couldn\u2019t tell what part\nof Luke\u2019s sentence upset him more. The vulgar comment about us having sex or\nthe insult that Nora wasn\u2019t his. </p><p>I wanted to reach out and grab him. I wanted to hug him\nand hold him close while I whispered in his ear that I loved him and so did\nNora. With how much she reacted to Harry\u2019s voice I had no doubt she would be\nHarry\u2019s girl despite who her dad was on paper.</p><p>A small scream leaves my mouth and I quickly move my hand\nup to cover the sound. The room that had been peaceful and quite only moments\nago was now a loud mess. Luke had shoved Harry backwards causing him to knock\nback into the bed, jostling me sharply with the movement. Nurses and security\nrushed into the room at the commotion and Harry was trying to keep his hands\nout of the fight. Harry\u2019s little reaction to the situation didn\u2019t stop Luke and\nhe threw himself at Harry and as he did his fingers caught around the drip, yanking\nit from my arm as he and Harry went tumbling to the hard ground. </p><p>I cried out at the stinging feeling which caused both\nLuke and Harry to freeze on the floor. The pushed at each other as they fought\nto get their feet, eyes sliding over to me as they forgot about each other.\nBoth of them moved to comfort me but Harry moved a second faster, speedily\ngrabbing a bit of gauze, pressing it tightly over the inside of me elbow where\nthe needle just was and it had started to bleed with how roughly it was removed.</p><p>Security had come in at some point, dragging Luke back\nout of the room as he profusely apologised to me, while also trying to get\nsecurity to let him go but they weren\u2019t having it and moments later it was just\nHarry at my side again along with a young nurse.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I whimpered, a steady stream of tears sliding down\nmy cheeks as another security guard wrapped his hand around Harry\u2019s arm and\nstarted to pull him from the room as well.</p><p>\u201cNo, not him.\u201d The nurse said as she pushed a small hand\nagainst the security\u2019s chest to get him to let go of Harry.</p><p>The security guard nodded at her after a short second, he\ngave Harry a look up and down, checking he was doing anything wrong before finally\nleaving the room. I only half registered that Luke was still yelling from outside\nthe room because Harry\u2019s hand pressed down hard on my arm to stop the blood.</p><p>\u201cBreathe Evie,\u201d He said out of breath, fingers massaging\nsoft circles into my elbow.</p><p>My heart was thrashing against my chest, my breathing was\ntight and everything hurt. What the fuck was that. </p><p>The nurse knocked Harry out of her way gently as she took\nmy arm from him, moving so she had her own hand over the gauze. I watched her as\nshe whispered something into Harry ear, he nodded in reply to what she said eyes\nstill locked on me.</p><p>Harry shifted himself up onto the bed, his hip pressing\ninto mine as he reached over my quivering body to take my hand into his own\nshaking one. With his other hand he cupped my cheek, thumb swiping over my\ncheekbone forcing me eyes to stay on him instead of drift over to where the\nnurse was getting ready to put the IV back in.</p><p>\u201cLook at me Evie bear.\u201d He whispered, his breathes slow,\nstructured and deep trying to get me to mimic them but it wasn\u2019t working. It\nfelt like there was a binding around my neck, stopping any air getting in. My\nanxiety had me in choke hold that wasn\u2019t anywhere close to loosening its\nreigns. \u201cTell me about the time you broke your arm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I questioned a little confused to where he was\ngoing. My eyes flickered around the room wondering if he was being serious and\nthe trauma of what happened hadn\u2019t sent me off my rocker.</p><p>\u201cGrace took you to that party, remember?\u201d His hand soothed\nthrough my hair that was resting on the flat pillow. The touch was soft but\nwasn\u2019t enough to stop this crippling anxiety attack.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t tell dad.\u201d I said my mind being drawn back to\none of the most prominent memories I had of my father. \u201cShe lied and said she\nwould take me to see the new Harry Potter because he wouldn\u2019t let her go a\nparty and then one of her friends knocked me down the porch steps and I landed\non my arm.\u201d<i></i></p><p>I smiled a little, a twitch of my lips at most as I leant\ninto Harry\u2019s touch on my cheek. I\u2019d only told him this story once, ages ago\nwhen I first met him, I couldn\u2019t believe that he remembered it. Not only remember\nit but remember how much the memory meant to me.</p><p><i>\u201cPlease don\u2019t tell\ndad.\u201d Grace begged as we rounded the last corner only a few houses from our\nown.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>I frowned looking\ndown at my arm that I kept cradled close to my chest. My tears had long since\ndried up but there was still a stinging pain and an engulfing heat coursing\nthrough my entire arm. It was nowhere near my heart but I swore I felt the beat\nof it around my elbow. I knew it was broken, it had to be there was no way that\nit could possibly hurt this much without being broken.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cI think he\u2019s going\nto notice.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Dad was like a bomb\ndog. He sniffed out when Grace and I were up to something the second we thought\nabout it. It was a surprise that she got this far tonight without him figuring\nout what she had planned.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>I was right as soon\nas we walked through the door we saw dad, just shy of steam coming out of his\nears, angry as he wore a path into mum\u2019s favourite rug in the living area. His\ngaze landed on Grace first eyes flaming, mouth open ready to yell before he\nflicked his heated gaze to me and on my arm. All the anger disappeared from his\neyes in that second.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cGrace, go to bed.\u201d\nHe said sternly, eyes going back to Grace. </i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Grace rolled her\neyes but did as he said, drunkenly stumbling as she made her way to the stairs\nand dad swore under his breath as he watched her. Once Grace had made it half\nway up the stairs dad rushed over to me taking my arm softly in his hands and\nshushing me gently when I whimpered. </i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat happened Evie\nbear?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cAshley was drunk\nand knocked me down the stairs.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Dad frowned, not\nsaying anything back as he helped me out of my jacket. Once my jacket was\npulled off I saw the full extent and dad swore again. It was bright red and\nswollen and I cried out as dad poked it tenderly with his fingers.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cOkay, sweetheart I\nthink we need to go to the hospital.\u201d He grabbed my jacket from where he sat it\ndown and draped it back over my shoulders, quickly going in search of his car\nkeys.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I\ncried grabbing my wrist again to keep my arm safely against my chest.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s not your\nfault Evie bear.\u201d He came over to me, arm looping around my shoulders to pull\nme into a loose hug so he wouldn\u2019t hurt my arm any more. He leaned down so he\nwas height was better matched to mine. Gently he peppered some soft kisses to\nmy forehead that made my tears stop right then and there. \u201cLet\u2019s get you to the\nhospital and get you all better.\u201d</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p>I chocked on a small sob as I clenched my eyes shut. It\nwas five years ago but it could have been yesterday with how prominent the\nmemory was. I could still feel the soft kiss against the side of my head and it\nhelped to relax me. I felt Harry move beside me so he was on the bed and then\nhis lips gently pressed to my temple and I smiled softly.</p><p>\u201cFeel better?\u201d He asked and slowly I opened my eyes back\nup to him.</p><p>Taking in a deep steady breathe I chuckled a little. I\nfelt so much better. Still a little worked up and emotional but I could breathe\nand the heart rate monitor had stopped it\u2019s incessant beeping. Harry was\nsmiling as he moved a hand to rub it over my belly. </p><p>\u201cHow did you know that would calm me down?\u201d</p><p>Harry shrugged, fingers locking with mine as I put them over\nhis. \u201cKnow how much you loved your parents and I wanted you to concentrate on\nsomething else, something good and that made you happy.\u201d</p><p>I chuckled cuddling into as side the best I could with\nthe new drip and the restrictions of the hospital bed. \u201cThat hurt a lot but he\nwas so soft and caring. Cried at the hospital and everything.\u201d I slowed taking\nin a steadying breathe before I continued. \u201cI love you Harry. Thank you for coming.\u201d</p><p>.-.-.-..</p><p>So sorry this took forever to come, I haven\u2019t been motivated at all to edit it this so blame depression, shes a bitch. Next chapter, I am rewriting so it might take a little longer to post, but chapter 9 is almost finished and chapter 10 just needs an update. We\u2019re in the home stretch now, tell me what you think.</p></p>",

Hate cannot drive out hate: only\nlove can do that.&rdquo;&nbsp;</i><i>&#8213; Martin Luther\nKing Jr., A Testament of Hope: The Essential Writings and Speeches</i></p><p>&ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; Gemma asked me for what felt like the\nmillionth time this morning.</p><p>Harry had been gone for a few weeks now while he did the\nSouth American leg of the tour. I was scared and a little nerve wracked on\nbeing without him after Luke showed up but I knew he had a job to do so I had\nto be okay. Gemma, Anne and Grace were taking it in turns to keep me company &ndash;\nmore like babysit me &ndash; because Liz had become concerned about my blood pressure\nbeing high and telling me that I should be resting as much as possible. Resting\nwas not easy for me.</p><p>&ldquo;The same as the last time you asked.&rdquo; I said to her as I\nfolded the warm freshly washed pink onesie I had on top of my bump.</p><p>Gemma frowned at me as she continued with her own pile of\nfreshly washed baby clothes while an episode of &lsquo;friends&rsquo; played in the\nbackground. She was good company, I was as close to her as I was to Grace, but\nI was getting sick and tired of being asked if I was okay. If I wasn&rsquo;t okay,\nthen Nora wasn&rsquo;t, so the second I felt something was wrong I would let her\nknow. </p><p>All I felt was&hellip; odd. Luke showed up weeks ago, threatened\nto involve himself back into my life, into Nora&rsquo;s life but he hadn&rsquo;t since\nuttered a peep. Now he knew that I was pregnant and I still hadn&rsquo;t managed to\nreceive even one text to ask if I was okay; if Nora was okay. Harry had told me\nnot to worry so much if he was gone then so be it. Maybe Luke had dropped the\nidea and the less he interreacted the better it would be if he were to want\ncustody, but I still couldn&rsquo;t fight away the little niggle of worry at the back\nof my head that he was going to come back and come back hard.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, we all just want you and Nora to be okay.&rdquo; She\nleant over and snatched half of my pile of onesies and just shrugged her\nshoulders when I shot her a glare.</p><p>&ldquo;I know you do.&rdquo; I said folding the last onesie I had in\nmy pile. &ldquo;It just stresses me out more when people keep asking. I won&rsquo;t\nhesitate to say if something doesn&rsquo;t feel right so you don&rsquo;t need to ask every\nfive minutes.&rdquo;</p><p>Gemma sighed and nodded her head very reluctantly. We sat\nin silence with only the sound of the television filling the room for a few\nminutes until we were interrupted by a knock on the front door. My brows\nfurrowed in confusion as I glanced over to Gemma. I lived in a gated community so\nit wasn&rsquo;t often I had someone knocking on my door without receiving a text to\nfrom them first. </p><p>Gemma shrugged her shoulders and I pushed up onto my feet,\nshe tried to get me to stop and sit back down but I just waved my hand at her.\nWith a roll of her eyes she got up and followed my soft steps to the door. It\ncould have been Anne and she had just forgotten her key to get in but that bad\nfeeling a had felt before was back and was churning big storm waves in my\nstomach. </p><p>&ldquo;Evangeline Jones,&rdquo; The young boy in the suit asked the\nsecond I pulled the door open. It fit him poorly and he seemed a little nervous\nto ask, his eyes flickering down to my bump that was stretching against the\nmaterial of my tee shirt. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said nervously, my hand already shaking at my\nside as I eyed the envelope he had in his hand.</p><p>I knew he was a lawyer, or a lawyer&rsquo;s intern, without him\nhaving to tell me. I had dealt with many self-righteous assholes in suits for\none lifetime to know without question that&rsquo;s what this man was. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been served.&rdquo; I swallowed heavily, already\nknowing that&rsquo;s what he was here for as he held out the folder papers to me.</p><p>&ldquo;By who?&rdquo; Gemma snapped at the young boy and he recoiled\nbackwards a little at the tone of her voice. She stepped up beside me eyes\nburning holes into the grey suit as I slowly pulled the envelope from the\nlawyer boy&rsquo;s fingers.</p><p>Nervously he looked between Gemma and I before looking down\nat me. &ldquo;Luke Williams.&rdquo;</p><p>Gemma swore under her breath before slamming the door in\nthe lawyer boy&rsquo;s face. Slowly I stepped back from the door my hands struggling\nto pull the staple keeping the folds of the paper together my hands were\nshaking that badly. My chest was tight and I felt ready to burst into tears. I\nknew this would come but I didn&rsquo;t think it would hurt this much. </p><p>&ldquo;Evie, sit down.&rdquo; Gemma gripped my arm tightly trying to\npull me back to the couch.</p><p>Shaking my head, I shrugged my arm back out of her hold.\n&ldquo;I need to know what he wants.&rdquo;</p><p>My fingers were still struggling with the stupid staple\nthat was holding the papers together, my fingernail found grip under the little\nmetal strip and I ripped it not caring if I tore the paper in the process. I felt\nsick as I unfolded the pages with unsteady hands. </p><p>&ldquo;He wants custody.&rdquo; I whispered as my eyes quickly read\nover the words. &ldquo;He fucking avoids me for a month then sues me for custody. I\nwould have talked through this with him but he sues me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Breathe Evie,&rdquo; Gemma stepped forward again her hands gently\nwrapping around my upper arms, traveling them over my hands slowly to soothe me.\n&ldquo;Breathe and I&rsquo;ll call Harry.&rdquo;</p><p>Shaking my head, I tried to take in a deep breathes, to\ncopy her deep breathes, but there was a tightness in my throat that stopped me\nfrom getting any air in. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s on stage.&rdquo; I chocked.</p><p>My fingers were numb and my eyes were blurring. I felt\nwrong, so, so wrong, my feet felt like jelly and my mind told me that I just\nshouldn&rsquo;t be standing anymore. Attempting to take in one more breathe I\nclenched my eyes tightly, the dim lights of the front entry stinging my eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;Gem,&rdquo; I groaned. &ldquo;You know how I said if I felt\nsomething was wrong I&rsquo;d tell you&hellip; somethings wrong.&rdquo;</p><p>My legs gave out and I felt Gemma grab me tightly to help\nkeep me up. I heard her call my name once in fear before I was enveloped in\ndarkness.</p><p>.-.-.-.</p><p>Harry:</p><p>There was a drop of sweat slipping down my temple as I\nran down the steps and backstage the sounds of thousands of fans still\nscreaming following me. My heart was still pounding a tattoo against my chest,\nlike it always was after the high of performing on stage and doing one of the\nthings I loved most.</p><p>As grateful and happy as I was to be doing what I loved, performing\nto thousands of fans never seemed to distract me from my thoughts on Evie who\nwas thousands upon thousands of miles away from me.</p><p>For years she had been my best friend and she was always\nthe first person I turned to for anything. Whenever I was worried, she was the\none I wanted to talk, when I was upset, it was her that I always called, even\nwhen I was happy or something good happened she was the first that I wanted to\ntell. She was always the first to call me. And all of that made it harder to\nleave her behind when I went on tour.</p><p>As good as this high was it just didn&rsquo;t feel the same as\nwhen she wasn&rsquo;t here to enjoy it with. She was his as well now. I&rsquo;d finally\nmade her my girlfriend, it might have taken a pregnancy to gain the guts to do\nso but I had her and had never felt more in love with anyone. His life was\nperfect. I also had a little baby girl to think about, despite the possibility\nof Nora not being mine, she wouldn&rsquo;t be loved or spoilt any less.</p><p>It gutted me to leave them behind but I knew that it was\nbetter that they were safe at home. The first leg of the tour was too much for\nEvie, the extra travel wouldn&rsquo;t have been good for her and with Luke taunting\nher and coming back into her life when her blood pressure was already questionable,\nbeing so far away from home really wasn&rsquo;t an option for her right now. </p><p>&ldquo;Harry,&rdquo; Jeff ran up to me a worried look set deep in his\neyes as he quickly navigated his was through the backstage crew. </p><p>&ldquo;Not now Jeff, I just want to get back to the hotel and\ncall Evie.&rdquo; Quickly shrugging back out of my suit jacket I ran towards the\ndressing room to get changed so I could get back to the hotel as quickly as\npossible and check up on Evie.</p><p>&ldquo;Gemma called about twenty minutes ago. She collapsed and\nthey took her to hospital.&rdquo; Jeff said a little out of breath as he tried to\nkeep up with my hurried pace.</p><p>I stopped in my tracks, my feet feeling heavy with Jeff&rsquo;s\nwords. My chest was tight and it felt like I couldn&rsquo;t breathe. Evie&rsquo;s blood\npressure had been high but not dangerously high enough that it would land her\nin hospital. She was fine at her appointment a few days ago what had happened\nbetween then and now.</p><p>&ldquo;Did she say what happened?&rdquo; I asked, sound trying to\ncome up my throat but catching a bit. Reaching up a hand I pulled at the\nbuttons of my shirt to air out my heated chest. It felt ten times hotter now\nthen what it did before. &ldquo;Is Evie okay?&rdquo; I added quickly.</p><p>All of the crew were looking at me with fast worried\nglances now and so were the band as the joined us in the hallway. I must have\nlooked like a nervous wreck to get such anxious looks from Sarah and Clare.\nEven Mitch looked like he wanted to come over and check that I was okay.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, she called me from the ambulance and said\nshe was still unconscious. She didn&rsquo;t say what happened either, she just wanted\nto talk to you.&rdquo; He swallowed, eyes trying very hard to avoid mine.</p><p>Jeff had my phone in his hand and I quickly grabbed it,\nfinding Gemma&rsquo;s number and dialling it only a few seconds later. </p><p>&ldquo;Harry, she said she&rsquo;d call if anything changed for the\nworse.&rdquo; Jeff yelled after me but I was to concentrated on the dial tone.</p><p>I was already stressed hearing about Evie and I didn&rsquo;t\nwant to listen to him or anyone unless it was Gemma, or Evie herself telling me\nthat she was okay. The only thing that could truly calm me now is hearing\nEvie&rsquo;s soft voice through the phone. </p><p>Jeff hadn&rsquo;t been the most supportive finding out that I\ncould have gotten Evie pregnant so I didn&rsquo;t trust how much he truly cared right\nnow. Jeff didn&rsquo;t hate Evie, he liked her more than any other girl I had been\nwith, he loved her, but he was more worried about what it would my career if\nNora was mine. It didn&rsquo;t matter either way if she was mine or not because I\nwasn&rsquo;t going to leave her or Evie. I loved my two girls more than anything. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my fucking girlfriend and daughter and I&rsquo;m not\ngoing to wait around to find it if they&rsquo;re okay or not.&rdquo; My voice was rough and\nloud, my words bouncing of the walls of the hallway. </p><p>Most of the crew turned away after my outburst hurriedly\ngot back to there job, fumbling a little with there haste. Clare, Sarah and\nAdam though stood there looking a little surprised by the declaration but Mitch\njust gave a knowing smile as if he had known all along what was going on\nbetween Evie and I behind closed hotel doors.</p><p>I hadn&rsquo;t confirmed my relationship with Evie to anyone but\nI also wasn&rsquo;t keeping it hidden or denying it to anybody that asked. Most of\nthem had become suspicious to it but never actually asked the question. I\nwasn&rsquo;t sure if they picked up on the daughter comment or not because only Jeff\nknew that current detail.</p><p>&ldquo;I know that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve booked you a flight to London.&rdquo;\nHe started softly, exhaling heavily, &ldquo;It leaves in an hour so you need to leave\nnow. You can have a day and a half with her if it isn&rsquo;t to bad and if it is\ncall me and I&rsquo;ll see if I can rearrange some dates so you can spend more time\nwith her.&rdquo; He paused for a second before meeting my eyes. &ldquo;If it was Glenne I\nwould want to be with her.&rdquo;</p><p>The phone rang out against my ear and I heard Gemma&rsquo;s\nmessage tone. Jeff was looking at me sympathetically and I didn&rsquo;t hate it. I\nbreathed out deeply and raised my hand to rub at my eyes. Jeff was one of my\nbest friends behind Evie so despite his dislike towards the situation we were\nin he was going to support me through it.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; I whispered as I dialled Gemma&rsquo;s number again.\nI wasn&rsquo;t going to stop ringing until I could talk to her.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, just go and make sure that they&rsquo;re okay.&rdquo; Jeff\nsaid with a strained smile and a wave of his hand to shake me off. </p><p>&ldquo;Make sure they&rsquo;re okay Harry.&rdquo; Clare said nervously, her\nhands pressed worriedly to her lips. </p><p>Nodding my head at her I turned away from them, running\ntowards the waiting car with my security only a few steps behind me. I still\nhad my suit on but it was the last thing that I was thinking off. All I wanted\nto do was get to Evie and check that her and Nora were okay. </p><p>.-.-.-.</p><p>Evie:</p><p>Shifting in the hospital bed the rough sheets rustled and\nscratched against my skin. I only managed to move a little until the IV drip in\nmy arm caught and I winced as I was tugged backwards. They wanted me to relax\nbut they put me in an uncomfortable bed and stuck a needle in my arm. My bed\nand Harry were what I really wanted but I literally got stuck with a needle. </p><p>&ldquo;Evie,&rdquo; A deep voice echoed from my side. A small smile\npulled at my lips at the sound of the voice and I snuggled further into the\nuncomfortable bed at the sound of Harry&rsquo;s voice. I was probably imagining it but\nit would help to relax me. &ldquo;Evie,&rdquo; the voice repeated with a small chuckle.</p><p>Slowly I blinked my eyes open to see a very tired, a very\nreal looking Harry leaning his weight on the bed at my side. It was in that\nmoment I noticed the warmth of his large hand engulfing mine. He was still\nwearing the black button up of some Gucci suit I had seen him wearing on stage before\nall of this happened. It felt like I had only just seen him in it but I had\nbeen in out since I collapsed at the house so I don&rsquo;t know how long ago since he\nhad been prancing around on stage. I didn&rsquo;t even know if he was really here or\nif he was just a product of the medication they had put me on to relax. </p><p>&ldquo;Harry?&rdquo; I asked my voice scratching up my throat from\nthe misuse. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey Eve&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Harry&rsquo;s jaw tensed as he pulled my hand\ncloser to his lips, gently peppering small kisses over my cold knuckles. There\nwas water in his eyes as he smiled sadly and he gripped my hand tightly as if\nit was a life line and he was holding into me with all that he had.</p><p>&ldquo;You should be in Brazil mister,&rdquo; Lifting my finger from\nhis tight hold I stroked it over his cheek that was covered in a little stubble.</p><p>He chuckled humourlessly and moved his fingers so he\ncould grab my lone one still caressing his cheek and pull it back into his\nstrong grasp. As glad as I was to have him here the biggest disagreement we\nconstantly got into was about his career. This maybe was something we could put\nunder a very different light. If he ended up in hospital I would have been on a\nplane to him the exact second I could have and not a moment later.</p><p>&ldquo;Had to check that you and Nora were okay.&rdquo; He sounded\nheartbroken, voice cracking over the few words.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re fine.&rdquo; Pulling our joined hands down I rested them\nover my chest, savouring the comfort the touch bought. My lips brushed over his\nknuckles quickly and his eyes fluttered closed and he exhaled out heavily.</p><p>Harry opened his eyes back up and I caught the soft green\ncolour before they flickered with something I couldn&rsquo;t quite pinpoint but it\nwasn&rsquo;t pleased. &ldquo;Your blood pressure sky rocketed. You&rsquo;re lucky that Liz said\nyou&rsquo;re not preeclamptic. You could have had a stroke, gone into labour early or\nyou could have died if it got any higher.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s jaw tensed and he turned away from me as a tear\nslipped down his cheek. I had already got a run down from Liz earlier though I\nwas still sought of out of it from a sedative they had given me. The stress and\nanxiety I got from getting the papers from Luke&rsquo;s lawyers caused my blood\npressure to get dangerously high, which was why I fainted and being seven\nmonths pregnant it could cause a number of complications for both me and Nora.</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t even want to begin to imagine how scared he must\nhave felt finding out what happened and being so far away. But I was okay. Nora\nwas okay. </p><p>&ldquo;I know, but we&rsquo;re okay now.&rdquo; Reaching up I slipped my\nhand back around his jaw and pulled him down so he was looking back at me\nagain. &ldquo;Just a little dehydrated.&rdquo; Lifting my arm, I showed him the IV drip and\nhe smiled with a light shake of his head his eyes still showing how he was\nworking through all of this.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; he breathed leaning down to press a soft\nkiss to my lips. Mine were chapped and contrasted majorly to the salty tear\nstained soft caress of his.</p><p>My hand cupped his cheek to hold him closer to me as I\ntried to kiss him a little deeper but I still felt the smallest hint of the\nsedative lingering in my veins so my lips were a little sloppier than normal,\nmy hands trying to hold on tightly but came across weakly. Harry laughed, pulling\nback from me but kept close, lips pressing small chaste kisses around my face.\nI had really missed him. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to be fucking kidding me.&rdquo; I jolted at the\nnew voice in the room that came from behind Harry&rsquo;s quickly tensing body.</p><p>Luke sure had a knack for making the most perfectly timed\nentrances. </p><p>My breath felt stuck in my throat and the airy calmness I\ngot from the sedative was ripped from me with Luke&rsquo;s entrance. My eyes stayed\nlocked on Harry as he rolled his and tensed above me, his lips setting into a\ntight annoyed line. I gripped a little tighter to Harry&rsquo;s cheeks, not wanting\nhim to pull back. My heart was hammering against my chest painfully and if\nHarry put his hand over it he would feel every worried beat.</p><p>Instead Harry wrapped his hands around my wrists, fingers\nsoftly caressing the insides where he could feel my pulse. He tugged my hands\nback away from his face even as I shook my head hurriedly. He slipped his hand\ninto mine, squeezing it in reassurance as he turned to look at Luke angrily\nstood in the doorway, he stood in a way that blocked me from Luke&rsquo;s view and I\nhad to watch the muscles in his back flex.</p><p>&ldquo;You have to be fucking kidding me Luke.&rdquo; Harry said\nequally as annoyed as what Luke was. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s here because of you. You couldn&rsquo;t\nhave talked to her like a normal person and not freak her out?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This has nothing to do with you Harry. I should have\nknown that you&rsquo;d get straight into bed with her though. You always wanted her.\nYou&rsquo;ve been waiting for us to blow up so you could swing in and save the day&rdquo; I\nswallowed hard with Luke&rsquo;s words, this wasn&rsquo;t something I wanted to be dealing\nwith now. My heart rate monitor beeping fast was just making me even more\nanxious. </p><p>&ldquo;Get out Luke. She&rsquo;s supposed to be resting which you are\nnot helping.&rdquo; Harry gripped my hand tightly as he turned to look back at the\nmonitor where the screen was flashing red. I tried to take in some deep\nbreathes but it wasn&rsquo;t helping a single bit.</p><p>&ldquo;Luke please just go.&rdquo; I whimpered as I shifted. I felt uncomfortable.\nI wanted to grab the drip and rip it out of my arm even though it would hurt to\npull it out it would be much better than having it in. The clip on my finger\ncould go with it. </p><p>Looking around Harry I watched Luke shake his head and\ncome further into my hospital room. He tired to glance around Harry to see my\nbut Harry stepped into his line of sight every time. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s carrying my baby. I\nhave every right to be here.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry looked down at me, a questioning gleam in his eyes.\nI still hadn&rsquo;t told Luke about what had happened between Harry and I after the\nbreak up. I hadn&rsquo;t really had the chance to say anything, since this was only\nthe second time that I had seen him since the breakup and it wasn&rsquo;t a\nconversation we had over text.</p><p>Swallowing deeply, I looked away from Harry, I felt small\nunder his look, from the corner of my eye I saw him purse his lips and turn his\nlook towards Luke. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s her body and she doesn&rsquo;t want you here.&rdquo; Harry said\ntightly and his grip around my hand matched the one of his voice.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s still my baby, I have rights.&rdquo;</p><p>Watching through squinted eyes I saw Luke step forward\nagain and the warmth of Harry&rsquo;s hand slipped from around mine as he moved to\nblock Luke from getting to close to me. The heart rate monitor was still beeping\nrapidly, so quickly I thought it might explode. Curling up on the bed I wrapped\nmy arms around my belly, my protective instincts kicking in. Where were the\nnurses?</p><p>&ldquo;Luke,&rdquo; I yelled as I watch his hands came up to Harry&rsquo;s\nchest, his tanned fingers wrapping around the soft material of the button up.\nHarry quickly pushed them back out of the way and stepped to block me more. </p><p>&ldquo;Just because you&rsquo;re fucking her doesn&rsquo;t make you my\nbaby&rsquo;s father.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s entire body froze with Luke&rsquo;s comment and I saw\nthat he was struggling to not react to what he said. Normally I could read\nHarry so easily but looking at him from the side now I couldn&rsquo;t tell what part\nof Luke&rsquo;s sentence upset him more. The vulgar comment about us having sex or\nthe insult that Nora wasn&rsquo;t his. </p><p>I wanted to reach out and grab him. I wanted to hug him\nand hold him close while I whispered in his ear that I loved him and so did\nNora. With how much she reacted to Harry&rsquo;s voice I had no doubt she would be\nHarry&rsquo;s girl despite who her dad was on paper.</p><p>A small scream leaves my mouth and I quickly move my hand\nup to cover the sound. The room that had been peaceful and quite only moments\nago was now a loud mess. Luke had shoved Harry backwards causing him to knock\nback into the bed, jostling me sharply with the movement. Nurses and security\nrushed into the room at the commotion and Harry was trying to keep his hands\nout of the fight. Harry&rsquo;s little reaction to the situation didn&rsquo;t stop Luke and\nhe threw himself at Harry and as he did his fingers caught around the drip, yanking\nit from my arm as he and Harry went tumbling to the hard ground. </p><p>I cried out at the stinging feeling which caused both\nLuke and Harry to freeze on the floor. The pushed at each other as they fought\nto get their feet, eyes sliding over to me as they forgot about each other.\nBoth of them moved to comfort me but Harry moved a second faster, speedily\ngrabbing a bit of gauze, pressing it tightly over the inside of me elbow where\nthe needle just was and it had started to bleed with how roughly it was removed.</p><p>Security had come in at some point, dragging Luke back\nout of the room as he profusely apologised to me, while also trying to get\nsecurity to let him go but they weren&rsquo;t having it and moments later it was just\nHarry at my side again along with a young nurse.</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I whimpered, a steady stream of tears sliding down\nmy cheeks as another security guard wrapped his hand around Harry&rsquo;s arm and\nstarted to pull him from the room as well.</p><p>&ldquo;No, not him.&rdquo; The nurse said as she pushed a small hand\nagainst the security&rsquo;s chest to get him to let go of Harry.</p><p>The security guard nodded at her after a short second, he\ngave Harry a look up and down, checking he was doing anything wrong before finally\nleaving the room. I only half registered that Luke was still yelling from outside\nthe room because Harry&rsquo;s hand pressed down hard on my arm to stop the blood.</p><p>&ldquo;Breathe Evie,&rdquo; He said out of breath, fingers massaging\nsoft circles into my elbow.</p><p>My heart was thrashing against my chest, my breathing was\ntight and everything hurt. What the fuck was that. </p><p>The nurse knocked Harry out of her way gently as she took\nmy arm from him, moving so she had her own hand over the gauze. I watched her as\nshe whispered something into Harry ear, he nodded in reply to what she said eyes\nstill locked on me.</p><p>Harry shifted himself up onto the bed, his hip pressing\ninto mine as he reached over my quivering body to take my hand into his own\nshaking one. With his other hand he cupped my cheek, thumb swiping over my\ncheekbone forcing me eyes to stay on him instead of drift over to where the\nnurse was getting ready to put the IV back in.</p><p>&ldquo;Look at me Evie bear.&rdquo; He whispered, his breathes slow,\nstructured and deep trying to get me to mimic them but it wasn&rsquo;t working. It\nfelt like there was a binding around my neck, stopping any air getting in. My\nanxiety had me in choke hold that wasn&rsquo;t anywhere close to loosening its\nreigns. &ldquo;Tell me about the time you broke your arm.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; I questioned a little confused to where he was\ngoing. My eyes flickered around the room wondering if he was being serious and\nthe trauma of what happened hadn&rsquo;t sent me off my rocker.</p><p>&ldquo;Grace took you to that party, remember?&rdquo; His hand soothed\nthrough my hair that was resting on the flat pillow. The touch was soft but\nwasn&rsquo;t enough to stop this crippling anxiety attack.</p><p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t tell dad.&rdquo; I said my mind being drawn back to\none of the most prominent memories I had of my father. &ldquo;She lied and said she\nwould take me to see the new Harry Potter because he wouldn&rsquo;t let her go a\nparty and then one of her friends knocked me down the porch steps and I landed\non my arm.&rdquo;<i></i></p><p>I smiled a little, a twitch of my lips at most as I leant\ninto Harry&rsquo;s touch on my cheek. I&rsquo;d only told him this story once, ages ago\nwhen I first met him, I couldn&rsquo;t believe that he remembered it. Not only remember\nit but remember how much the memory meant to me.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t tell\ndad.&rdquo; Grace begged as we rounded the last corner only a few houses from our\nown.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>I frowned looking\ndown at my arm that I kept cradled close to my chest. My tears had long since\ndried up but there was still a stinging pain and an engulfing heat coursing\nthrough my entire arm. It was nowhere near my heart but I swore I felt the beat\nof it around my elbow. I knew it was broken, it had to be there was no way that\nit could possibly hurt this much without being broken.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s going\nto notice.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Dad was like a bomb\ndog. He sniffed out when Grace and I were up to something the second we thought\nabout it. It was a surprise that she got this far tonight without him figuring\nout what she had planned.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>I was right as soon\nas we walked through the door we saw dad, just shy of steam coming out of his\nears, angry as he wore a path into mum&rsquo;s favourite rug in the living area. His\ngaze landed on Grace first eyes flaming, mouth open ready to yell before he\nflicked his heated gaze to me and on my arm. All the anger disappeared from his\neyes in that second.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Grace, go to bed.&rdquo;\nHe said sternly, eyes going back to Grace. </i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Grace rolled her\neyes but did as he said, drunkenly stumbling as she made her way to the stairs\nand dad swore under his breath as he watched her. Once Grace had made it half\nway up the stairs dad rushed over to me taking my arm softly in his hands and\nshushing me gently when I whimpered. </i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What happened Evie\nbear?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Ashley was drunk\nand knocked me down the stairs.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Dad frowned, not\nsaying anything back as he helped me out of my jacket. Once my jacket was\npulled off I saw the full extent and dad swore again. It was bright red and\nswollen and I cried out as dad poked it tenderly with his fingers.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Okay, sweetheart I\nthink we need to go to the hospital.&rdquo; He grabbed my jacket from where he sat it\ndown and draped it back over my shoulders, quickly going in search of his car\nkeys.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry,&rdquo; I\ncried grabbing my wrist again to keep my arm safely against my chest.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your\nfault Evie bear.&rdquo; He came over to me, arm looping around my shoulders to pull\nme into a loose hug so he wouldn&rsquo;t hurt my arm any more. He leaned down so he\nwas height was better matched to mine. Gently he peppered some soft kisses to\nmy forehead that made my tears stop right then and there. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get you to the\nhospital and get you all better.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p>I chocked on a small sob as I clenched my eyes shut. It\nwas five years ago but it could have been yesterday with how prominent the\nmemory was. I could still feel the soft kiss against the side of my head and it\nhelped to relax me. I felt Harry move beside me so he was on the bed and then\nhis lips gently pressed to my temple and I smiled softly.</p><p>&ldquo;Feel better?&rdquo; He asked and slowly I opened my eyes back\nup to him.</p><p>Taking in a deep steady breathe I chuckled a little. I\nfelt so much better. Still a little worked up and emotional but I could breathe\nand the heart rate monitor had stopped it&rsquo;s incessant beeping. Harry was\nsmiling as he moved a hand to rub it over my belly. </p><p>&ldquo;How did you know that would calm me down?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry shrugged, fingers locking with mine as I put them over\nhis. &ldquo;Know how much you loved your parents and I wanted you to concentrate on\nsomething else, something good and that made you happy.&rdquo;</p><p>I chuckled cuddling into as side the best I could with\nthe new drip and the restrictions of the hospital bed. &ldquo;That hurt a lot but he\nwas so soft and caring. Cried at the hospital and everything.&rdquo; I slowed taking\nin a steadying breathe before I continued. &ldquo;I love you Harry. Thank you for coming.&rdquo;</p><p>.-.-.-..</p><p>So sorry this took forever to come, I haven&rsquo;t been motivated at all to edit it this so blame depression, shes a bitch. Next chapter, I am rewriting so it might take a little longer to post, but chapter 9 is almost finished and chapter 10 just needs an update. We&rsquo;re in the home stretch now, tell me what you think.</p></p>",
