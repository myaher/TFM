That\u2019s him, he\u2019s a fucking piece of Wonderbread.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe is <i>not</i> a piece of Wonderbread, Harry,\u201d You defend, rolling your eyes, \u201cHe\u2019s a <i>stable guy</i>, with a <i>stable job</i>, and-\u201c</p><p>\u201cAt least tell me the sex is good.\u201d He cuts in once again, shoveling popcorn into his mouth. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s uh, the sex is um, it\u2019s fine-\u201c</p><p>\u201cOh my <i>god</i>, Y/N!\u201d He shouts, his voice nearly startling you, \u201cEven the sex is boring?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI did not say that-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to!\u201d He laughs, \u201cI\u2019ve known you for six years, I can tell when you\u2019re lying,\u201d He smirks obnoxiously, \u201cGod I can\u2019t believe even the sex is bad, what is it? You suck him off and then it\u2019s like five minutes of missionary or-\u201c</p><p>\u201c<i>Harry</i>!\u201d You squeal, grabbing the pillow you flung at him earlier and covering your blushing face with it instead. </p><p>\u201cOh, come on, you\u2019re acting like we don\u2019t talk about this shit.\u201d He huffs, grabbing the pillow from over your face and tossing it over his shoulder. </p><p>\u201c<i>You</i> talk about this shit, Harry,\u201d You laugh lightheartedly, \u201cWithout me asking you to, might I add.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell maybe if you were having better sex, you\u2019d want to talk about it.\u201d He shrugs, sticking his tongue out at you as he turns back to the TV. </p><p>\u201cMaybe if you were less promiscuous, you\u2019d talk about it less.\u201d You counter, leaning back against the couch and shoving your feet in his lap. </p><p>\u201cMaybe if you actually got some good sex, you\u2019d be less annoying.\u201d He teases, leaning back against the couch and folding his arms on top of your legs. </p><p>\u00a0You wake up to the light coming in through the living room window and peel your eyes open to see Harry underneath you. He\u2019s passed out cold, his head in your lap and his feet hanging off the edge of the couch. He must\u2019ve curled up on your lap after you fell asleep during your American Horror Story binge. \u00a0You suddenly hear a knock at the door and realize that must have been what woke you up, but who the hell is here this early in the morning? </p><p>You shove him off your lap and he grunts in protest, curling back up with one of the astray pillows as you stumble to your feet. You pass the kitchen on the way to the door and you catch the time lit up on the stove out of the corner of your eye. </p><p>One thirty? No way, it\u2019s not one thirty in the afternoon. <i>Sure</i>, you two didn\u2019t go to bed till four but it couldn\u2019t possibly be-</p><p>\u201cY/N? Hello?\u201d You hear your boyfriend\u2019s voice ask from behind the door as he continues knocking. </p><p>\u201cShit, shit, <i>shit</i>!\u201d You whisper to yourself, looking down to see yourself still dressed in the same sweatpants from yesterday and Harry\u2019s <i>Higgs</i> sweatshirt. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d Harry groans from the couch, standing up and running a hand through his messy bedhead. </p><p>\u201c<i>Mister perfect</i> is outside because I was supposed to go out to lunch with him today!\u201d You whisper harshly, trying to figure out how to get ready and air out the very present smell of weed in your apartment in the next three seconds. </p><p>\u201c<i>Lunch</i>? Who the fuck makes <i>plans</i> to go to lunch-\u201c</p><p>\u201cHarry! Not right now!\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell fine, why don\u2019t you go get dressed and I\u2019ll entertain the snooze fest for ten minutes.\u201d He suggests, walking past you to grab the door. </p><p>You cringe outwardly, your face screwing up into the worst expression as he pulls the door open and suddenly your two very separate worlds are colliding. Your boyfriend doesn\u2019t know you as some girl who smokes weed and inhales potato chips while bingeing TV shows with your best friend who\u2019s a self-proclaimed lady killer and proud retail associate at Zumiez. He knows you as Y/N, a girl he met studying at the library who enjoys critically acclaimed movies and going to brunch on Sunday. </p><p>\u201cHey there mate,\u201d Harry grins, gesturing inside, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just come in and chill, she\u2019ll be ready to go in like ten, maybe fifteen minutes, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve had the pleasure of getting to know each other.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd you are?\u201d Your boyfriend asks, raising his eyebrows as he passes Harry in the hallway. </p><p>\u201cHer best friend,\u201d Harry grins proudly, \u201cHarry.\u201d </p><p>Your boyfriend reaches out his hand to shake Harry\u2019s, but Harry grabs his hand and pulls him into a bro hug, clapping his back. You meet your boyfriend\u2019s eyes over Harry\u2019s shoulder, and he looks anything but pleased. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just be right out, I swear.\u201d You say quickly, darting to your room to get changed. </p><p>You slip on a pair of jeans and huff in annoyance as you strip out of Harry\u2019s stupid weed hoodie and put on a nice blouse instead. You spray yourself head to toe with perfume and brush your teeth twice to cover the smell of smoke sticking to you before shoving your feet into a pair of flats and rejoining the boys in the living room. </p><p>\u201cYou ready to go?\u201d Your boyfriend asks hurriedly, standing from the couch and effectively cutting Harry off in the middle of whatever they were talking about. </p><p>\u201cUm, yeah,\u201d You stutter, grabbing your purse and turning to Harry, \u201cYou can lock up when you leave, yeah?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYup, don\u2019t even worry about it,\u201d He nods, \u201cYou two have fun, <i>but not too much fun</i>.\u201d He jokes, making your boyfriend grimace. </p><p>You fake smile, waving goodbye and nearly dragging your boyfriend out of your apartment and to his car parked outside. He\u2019s still looking at you incredulously as you collapse into the car beside him and he starts it up, driving to the entrance of your complex. </p><p>He finally breaks the silence when you hit the first red light, \u201cYou never mentioned your uh-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI know, he\u2019s um, he\u2019s a lot,\u201d You explain, trying to carefully word your next thought, \u201cWe\u2019ve been friends for a long time.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe seems like a nice enough guy,\u201d He shrugs, \u201cDidn\u2019t really strike me as someone you\u2019d be best friends with however.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s just um, you know we\u2019ve been hanging out for so long he just kind of-\u201c</p><p>\u201cSticks around and hotboxes your apartment?\u201d He remarks, the judgement dripping from his voice. </p><p>Your stomach twists in the worst way when the words come out of his mouth. There it is, the sentence you were waiting for. The one that confirms he thinks of Harry exactly the way you thought he would. Harry is loud, and obnoxious, and stoned ninety percent of the time but he\u2019s your best friend in the whole world. He\u2019s held your hair over the toilet while you puked up vodka soda more times than you\u2019d like to count, and you don\u2019t even want to try and think of how many movie marathons you\u2019ve had at each other\u2019s houses till ungodly hours of the night. You love that son of a bitch, no matter how many girls he fucks in the backseat of his old ass Mustang or how many times he bums five bucks off you for a Whopper when he\u2019s got the munchies, he\u2019s your best friend, and maybe he\u2019s right about <i>mister perfect</i>. </p><p>\u00a0You walk back in your apartment expecting to see Harry still sprawled on the couch with the remote in his hand but he\u2019s nowhere to be found. You trudge your feet back to your bedroom and grab his <i>Higgs </i>hoodie off the ground, stripping out of your blouse and pulling the hoodie back over your head. You dial his number as you collapse on your bed, laying upside down with your feet pressed to the wall. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d He asks right away, not even bothering to say hello, \u201cHow was your lunch date?\u201d </p><p>\u201cDefinitely could\u2019ve gone better.\u201d You sigh, sitting back up when you feel the blood rushing to your head. </p><p>\u201cWhat happened? Did he order unseasoned chicken and steamed cauliflower?\u201d He teases. </p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d You laugh, rolling your eyes, \u201cI uh, I broke up with him.\u201d </p><p>You can hear the shuffle of movement on the other side of the phone and you can picture him sitting up quickly from laying down on his back just like you are, \u201cNo the fuck you didn\u2019t.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes the fuck I did.\u201d You chuckle, rolling over onto your stomach. </p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d He sighs, \u201cWhat finally made you put the last nail in the coffin?\u201d </p><p>\u201cRemember when you asked how the sex was?\u201d You grimace, covering your blushing face with your hand even though he can\u2019t see you. </p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He says uneasily, and you can almost hear the smirk in his voice. </p><p>\u201cWell there wasn\u2019t any,\u201d You gulp, awaiting his reaction, \u201cWe didn\u2019t-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou guys never fucked?\u201d He asks suddenly, cutting you off, \u201cY/N, you dated that guy for six months.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBelieve me, I know.\u201d You laugh, trying to break through the awkward air. </p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t had sex in six months?\u201d He asks again, clearly not able to wrap his head around the thought. </p><p>\u201cYes Harry, say it a little louder for your neighbors, would you?\u201d You joke, tying your hair up in a bun on top of your head. </p><p>\u201cGod, what a piece of fucking Wonderbread,\u201d He chuckles, cracking himself up with his own joke from earlier, \u201cSix months Y/N, that\u2019s like, that should be illegal.\u201d </p><p>\u201cProbably going to be a lot longer now.\u201d You mumble, walking to the kitchen to grab a tub of ice cream out of the freezer. </p><p>\u201cLonger? No way, I\u2019m not letting you do that to yourself,\u201d He laughs, \u201cWe\u2019re going out tonight and I\u2019m gonna wingman you so hard you\u2019ll definitely-\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d You sigh, cutting him off, \u201cYou know I don\u2019t do that shit Harry, I\u2019m not going to have sex with a total stranger.\u201d You say through a mouthful of ice cream. </p><p>\u201cWell, I mean, we could,\u201d He says, \u201cI\u2019m not a stranger.\u201d </p><p>You nearly choke on the huge bite of ice cream in your mouth when the words come out of his mouth. You almost drop the giant spoon in your hand as you set the ice cream down and press your phone to your ear to make sure you hear him properly. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, did you just fucking say-\u201c</p><p>\u201cY/N, it makes perfect sense,\u201d He reasons, \u201cWe know each other, too well probably, and I\u2019ve heard you complain after mediocre sex enough to know what you want.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo way! No you\u2019re not-\u201c</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve seen me naked plenty of times and I was there when you got that ass tattoo so I\u2019ve basically seen you in the nude-\u201c</p><p>\u201cThat is <i>not</i> the same thing.\u201d You cut in. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s close enough!\u201d He laughs, \u201cAll I\u2019m saying is I fucking know what I\u2019m doing, and I could make you feel good Y/N, something you apparently haven\u2019t experienced in six. Fucking. Months.\u201d </p><p>You close your eyes, pinching the bridge of your nose and trying to make your mind think straight. You can\u2019t do this, this is fucking insane right? Fucking your best friend? Fucking Harry? You can\u2019t have sex with Harry, he\u2019s fucking <i>Harry</i>! </p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d You say uneasily and fucking dammit if your subconscious didn\u2019t just slam her face into the wall, \u201cJust this once?\u201d </p><p>\u201cJust this once,\u201d He confirms, \u201cUnless of course you <i>want</i> to go for round two-\u201c</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get your hopes up, Styles,\u201d You warn, wanting to knock yourself out before you actually agree to something this insane, \u201cCan you be at my place in twenty minutes?\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>Twenty minutes</i>?\u201d He scoffs, \u201cY/N, there is an art to this, you think I just wake up and look this good? For the full experience I\u2019ve got to shower and shave and-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got half an hour until there is a strong possibility that I will change my mind.\u201d </p><p>\u201cUgh, fine,\u201d He sighs, and you swear you can hear him rolling his eyes, \u201cI\u2019ll be there in fifteen.\u201d </p><p>\u00a0As soon as you hang up the phone, your mind is whirling. Fifteen minutes. You\u2019ve got fifteen minutes until your best friend of six years is going to show up on your doorstep with every intention of seeing you naked. God. What have you done? </p><p>You hurry to your bathroom and brush your teeth first, gargling with mouth wash twice and checking your breath afterwards. Your hands are nearly shaking as you take your hair down from the bun on your head and you run your fingers through it, trying to sort out the tangles. Does it look better up? Will that make the act easier if your hair isn\u2019t like all over the place? Does leaving it down look too nice? </p><p>You shake your head in frustration and decide to leave it down as you walk back to your room and start shuffling through your dresser. What do you wear to have sex with your friend for the first time? Do you put on nice underwear or does that look like you\u2019re trying too hard? You definitely don\u2019t wear tan, seamless boyshorts, that\u2019s for sure. You wriggle out of your underwear and slide into a plain black thong instead. Not lace, not too fancy, and definitely not matching your bra but at least it\u2019s not spanx. </p><p>Do you put your jeans back on? Or just stay in his hoodie and some underwear? That\u2019s hot right? Are you supposed to be hot? Harry\u2019s not going to think you\u2019re hot whether you\u2019re dressed in nothing but a thong anyways. </p><p>There\u2019s a knock on the front door and you nearly jump out of your skin. God, he\u2019s here. You try to make a split-second decision to throw on a pair of shorts until the knocking sounds again and you realize he\u2019s locked out. You decide against the stupid shorts and walk back out to the living room, bracing yourself for what\u2019s about to happen. You could just <i>not answer the door</i>, tell him you fell asleep. It\u2019s happened before, he\u2019d believe you, wouldn\u2019t he? </p><p>\u201cY/N! It\u2019s fucking cold out here!\u201d He calls, banging his fist against the door. </p><p>You sigh, taking in a deep breath as you walk down the hallway to the front door and slide open the lock, pulling it open. The cold air hits you like a brick wall and Harry\u2019s face lights up upon seeing you before he shuffles past you into the warmth of your apartment. </p><p>He\u2019s still rubbing his hands together as he drops his skateboard inside and slides his backpack off one shoulder when your eyes rake over him, trying to compare his appearance to yours. He\u2019s in a plain pair of grey basketball shorts and his favorite Thrasher hoodie with a red hat pulled backwards over his unruly hair. He\u2019s anything but dressed up for the occasion and that\u2019s perfectly fine by you, you didn\u2019t sign up for the full <i>Harry Styles experience</i>. </p><p>\u201cGod it\u2019s warm in here,\u201d He groans, reaching for the thermostat to bump it down a few degrees, \u201cYou know, if you wore pants around the house you could probably save <i>loads</i> on your electric bill.\u201d </p><p>You can\u2019t find it in yourself to come up with something equally witty to throw back at him like you usually do. He\u2019s still cracking up at his own joke as he strips out of his hoodie and you\u2019re surprised to see his torso bare underneath. That\u2019s fine, you\u2019ve seen Harry shirtless before, many times actually, but this isn\u2019t like those times, is it? </p><p>He turns to look at you over his shoulder as he bends down to his backpack, grabbing his pack of pre-rolled joints and lighting one between his teeth. He stands back up with the joint between his teeth and puffs a cloud of smoke in your direction to which you roll your eyes and shove him. </p><p>\u201cSo, are we doing this?\u201d He asks, quirking his eyebrow up at you as he leads you the rest of the way into your apartment. </p><p>\u201cI um, I don\u2019t know, I think this was a bad idea we should just-\u201c</p><p>\u201cOh, no you don\u2019t.\u201d He laughs, cutting you off. </p><p>You\u2019re caught off guard as he takes the joint out of his mouth, balancing it between his two fingers and leans into you, pressing you into the wall and smashing his lips onto yours. He shotguns a puff of smoke into your mouth and you only cough a little bit, making him laugh as you swallow roughly. Suddenly his lips are moving against yours and <i>holy fuck</i> you\u2019re making out with your best friend, you\u2019re making out with <i>Harry</i>. </p><p>His free hand reaches to grip your waist, holding you in place against the wall as his other hand rests beside your head against the drywall, still gripping the smoking joint between his fingers. His hand hikes up the side of his hoodie, grabbing your naked hip and dragging his dull fingernails over your skin while his mouth continues moving with yours. You\u2019ve definitely never been kissed like this before, with this much skill and rhythm and the perfect amount of tongue but <i>of course he\u2019s a good kisser Y/N, he\u2019s had more than enough practice</i> you remind yourself. </p><p>It\u2019s not until his lips move away from yours and instead start to trail down your neck that you\u2019re suddenly painfully aware that this is <i>Harry</i>. Your best friend, <i>Harry Styles</i>, is kissing down your neck and <i>fuck is he biting your throat</i> and making your fucking knees buckle. </p><p>\u201cHarry?\u201d You gasp, wishing your voice wasn\u2019t so strained.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d He says, stopping his assault and looking up to meet your eyes, \u201cWhat? Too much teeth? I\u2019ll dial it back-\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d You sigh, trying to clear your head, \u201cJust enough teeth, I just um-\u201c</p><p>\u201cWant me to take off the hat?\u201d He suggests, grabbing it by the bill and tossing it behind him, \u201cThe hair is part of the experience, baby.\u201d He grins cheekily. </p><p>\u201cNo, Harry, <i>god</i>,\u201d You huff, rolling your eyes, \u201cI just um, I don\u2019t know if I can do this, what if this ruins our friendship? Like what if I give you a bad blowjob and you just-\u201c</p><p>\u201cWoah, woah, woah,\u201d He says, taking a drag, \u201cFor one, I wouldn\u2019t friend dump you over a shitty blowjob and two, you\u2019re not going to be giving any blowies you dolt, tonight is about you and making sure you get a hefty dose of orgasm to last you through the next six months.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s saying it\u2019s going to have to last me another six months?\u201d You scoff, hitting him in the arm. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just helping you prepare for the worst,\u201d He laughs, blowing another cloud of smoke into your face, \u201cNow will you please relax and let me finish my artistic masterpiece on your neck?\u201d </p><p>You roll your eyes as you lean back against the wall behind you and tilt your head back, allowing him further access to the skin of your throat. He grins, those stupid dimples indenting his cheeks as he leans back down and surprises you by grabbing the back of your neck and capturing your lips with his once again. His hands reach for the hem of his hoodie on your body, dragging it up and over your head, leaving you in nothing but your bright blue bra and black thong. </p><p>\u201cReally pulled out all the stops, huh?\u201d He teases, snaking his finger under your bra strap and snapping it against your skin. </p><p>\u201cSays the guy in the basketball shorts.\u201d You smirk, reaching forward to snap the band of his shorts against his hip. </p><p>The grin on his face is every bit devious as he grabs your hips, pulling you to him and ducking his head down to press his lips to yours once again. Suddenly the friction between the two of you is undeniable and you nearly hit the ground when Harry takes your bottom lip between his teeth. </p><p>\u201cBedroom?\u201d He pants, hardly pulling away from your lips long enough to get the single word out. </p><p>\u201cMhm.\u201d You hum, reverberating the word right back into his mouth as your lips move together. </p><p>He walks the both of you towards your bedroom door, still swung open from your hurried dash to get the door when he arrived. He nearly trips on two pairs of your shoes, swearing under his breath as he kicks them out of the way and leads you to the bed until the backs of your calves hit the mattress. </p><p>He pushes you down against the bed and your heart is nearly hammering out of your chest for the few seconds that you\u2019re laying there, staring up at him and his swollen lips and blown out irises. Who is this man in front of you? This isn\u2019t your high school best friend that used to put carrots up his nose at lunch and help you onto the roof of his house so you guys could smoke without his parents knowing. But it is. </p><p>\u201cYou good?\u201d He asks sincerely, kneeling in between your legs at the foot of the bed. </p><p>\u201cYup, just fine.\u201d You quip, trying to steady your breathing before he\u2019s close enough to hear your heart beating out of your chest. </p><p>\u201cGod Y/N, you have <i>got</i> to relax.\u201d He sighs, his hands running over your legs from your ankles to your thighs. </p><p>\u201cSorry if this is just,\u201d You pant, closing your eyes briefly, \u201cJust a lot to wrap my head around, okay?\u201d </p><p>He laughs and you know he\u2019s making a <i>that\u2019s what he said</i> joke in his head as he leans back over you, pressing his lips to your collar bone and then traveling further down your chest. </p><p>\u201cWould it be better if you weren\u2019t looking at me?\u201d He asks, looking up to meet your eyes as he drags your underwear off you, \u201cThink you could relax if you couldn\u2019t see me?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI mean, maybe, but how-\u201c</p><p>\u201cHere, get up.\u201d He says simply, cutting you off and throwing your underwear over his shoulder. </p><p>You\u2019re caught off guard as he instructs you to stand back up and he resumes your spot on the bed, his feet hanging off the edge quite a bit more than yours were. </p><p>\u201cCome over here.\u201d He says, reaching for your hand and you nearly feel like passing out as you kneel on the edge of the bed and crawl over to him, your naked ass in the air. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you-\u201c</p><p>\u201cPut this one here,\u201d He instructs, grabbing your right knee and placing it right beside his head, \u201cAnd put this one right here.\u201d He continues, grabbing your left knee and trying to drag it over his face to rest on the other side of his head. </p><p>\u201cWhat? No! Harry!\u201d You stutter, swatting his hand away but he grabs your leg tighter, meeting your eyes. </p><p>\u201cCome on Y/N, just ride my face, then you won\u2019t be looking at me while I-\u201c</p><p>\u201cDo <i>not</i> finish that sentence.\u201d You warn, your chest heaving as you wrap your arms around yourself to try to cover up at least a little. </p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d He says softly, his hand reaching out to grab your hip, \u201cDo you trust me?\u201d </p><p>You look up from the comforter beneath your knees to meet his stern eyes. There\u2019s not an ounce of teasing in his voice, no digs or cracking jokes, he\u2019s sincere and you\u2019re not sure you\u2019ve ever seen him look this serious. </p><p>\u201cIf at any point you want me to stop, you just say the word and we\u2019ll be done, we can put on a movie and act like this never happened, <i>I swear</i>,\u201d He says, squeezing your hip for emphasis, \u201cBut for now, can you just give me a <i>chance</i>?\u201d </p><p>You sigh, sitting back on your heels and staring at the ceiling fan whirring above you. This is insane. Sit on his face? Ride his face? He wants you to put <i>that</i> on his <i>mouth</i>, what if you fucking suffocate him? </p><p>\u201cHow do I do this again?\u201d You sigh, looking back down to meet his eyes. </p><p>He grins, grabbing your left knee once again and passing it over his face, placing it on the other side of his head. You cringe, preparing yourself to look down and see none other than fucking Harry\u2019s face between your thighs. </p><p>\u201cYou good?\u201d He asks again and the warmth of his breath directly on your core makes your thighs clench. </p><p>\u201cJust great,\u201d You grimace, \u201cAre you going to uh, get started down there, or?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to sit down first love,\u201d He laughs, his hands reaching around to grab your hips, \u201cCan\u2019t really reach you from way up there.\u201d </p><p>Love. That\u2019s new. Harry has definitely never called you love. You can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s saying it to comfort you because at this point, he can probably feel your heartbeat thumping in every cell of your body, many of which happen to be sitting on him at the current moment. You let out yet another sigh, bracing yourself as you lean off your knees, and onto the backs of your feet instead. </p><p>\u201cLike this?\u201d You ask cautiously, trying to keep yourself balanced on your heels so you don\u2019t crush him. </p><p>\u201cJust like that,\u201d He says, nodding his head and his nose brushes your clit, making you jump, \u201cShit, sorry.\u201d </p><p>\u201cCareful, Styles.\u201d You breathe, your legs already shaking. </p><p>You look down and meet his eyes, your cheeks instantly going aflame as he smirks at you with that stupid dimpled smile. His hair is splayed out beneath him, his eyes hooded as his hands move from your hips to your thighs, holding you in place as he licks one bold stripe up the center of your heat. </p><p>\u201c<i>Christ</i>.\u201d You sigh, your eyes falling closed as you suck in a sharp breath. </p><p>You hear him chuckle beneath you as he continues his assault, his hands locked around your jittering thighs as he licks up and down you, swirling his tongue in all the right ways. He sucks your bud into his mouth, pressing sloppy kisses to your core as he catches his breath before delving back into your heat. </p><p>\u201cH-Higher.\u201d You pant, leaning back on your hands that are firmly pressed to his chest behind you. </p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d He asks, licking a few stripes at just the perfect spot. </p><p>\u201cFuck, yes, right there,\u201d You breathe heavily, moving one of your hands from his chest to thread through his hair, \u201cBack and forth, horizontal.\u201d You pant, hoping he understands what you mean. </p><p>His tongue starts flicking back and forth across the perfect spot and you nearly lose your balance and fall forward at the surge of pleasure in the pit of your stomach. His arms reach up and grab your hips, holding you upright as you shudder, your eyes screwed shut. He continues the movement, darting back and forth between it and the sloppy kisses he resorts to in order to catch his breath as he reaches up your back to the clasp of your bra. He snaps it open with a quick flick of his skilled fingers and tosses it to the side, your full chest finally on display. </p><p>\u201cDid you just manage to get my bra off in the middle of all this?\u201d You gasp, your eyes fluttering open to meet his, still trained on you. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all in the wrist.\u201d He teases, purposefully nudging you with his nose this time. </p><p>You roll your eyes, reaching down to cover his face, wishing he would stop staring at you with that dimpled smirk on his face while his fucking mouth does <i>ungodly</i> things to your clit. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit,\u201d He smirks, \u201cThis is <i>much</i> hotter.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGod, would you please shut up and put your mouth to better use?\u201d You groan, uncovering his eyes once again. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t have to tell me twice.\u201d He jokes, returning his tongue to where you need him most, your knees buckling almost instantly. </p><p>It\u2019s only a couple seconds of that flicking movement that has you shuddering above him. He reaches up to tease your nipples, making you gasp and have to lean back on his chest once again. He\u2019s smirking proudly as you come undone above him, your thighs threatening to clench together and absolutely squish his head, but he couldn\u2019t care less. Your lip is nearly purple you\u2019re biting down on it so hard and Harry notices. You\u2019re keeping your moans contained but he won\u2019t be having any of that, you better tell him how good he\u2019s making you feel. </p><p>He leans you back to sit on his chest rather than kneeling over his face as you ride out your orgasm and you\u2019re just about to ask him what the hell he\u2019s doing when he pushes a finger into you. You nearly jump out of your skin at the overstimulation and your hands plant themselves firmly on the mattress on either side of his hips. </p><p>\u201cFeel good?\u201d He asks, trying to drag it out of you as he adds another finger, pumping into you relentlessly, and you involuntarily whimper. </p><p>\u201cMhm.\u201d You nod, biting your lip once again as his fingers curl inside you and your back arches, nearly tipping you over the edge for a second time already. </p><p>\u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake, let me hear you, Y/N.\u201d He grunts, adding his thumb to rub against your clit as his two fingers continue curling inside of you. </p><p>\u201cGod, Harry, fuck,\u201d You sputter, trying to get the words out, \u201cFuck me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou want me to stop?\u201d He asks, clearly not following, \u201cWant me to fuck you instead?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, asshat,\u201d You pant, \u201cFingers, fuck me, don\u2019t just curl them, in and out, you follow?\u201d </p><p>He\u2019s laughing as he nods, flipping his hair out of his face as he starts to pump his fingers in and out of you once again. You throw your head back in ecstasy, still balancing on your hands and gripping the duvet in your fists. </p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d He asks. </p><p>\u201cMuch.\u201d You breathe. </p><p>You move one hand from the mattress to grab him over his basketball shorts and he hisses through his teeth, his head suddenly falling back against the mattress. </p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d He grunts, pulling himself back up to meet your eyes, \u201cThis is about you-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d You nod, cutting him off. </p><p>He\u2019s staring at you wide eyed as you palm him through his shorts, not that he needs any help, he\u2019s already standing at stark attention against the waistband of his shorts. </p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t mean you can stop though, Styles.\u201d You smirk and he lets out a chuckle as he resumes. </p><p>\u201cYes ma\u2019am.\u201d He teases, rubbing his thumb back and forth against your clit perfectly. </p><p>The repeated movement is just enough to push you over the edge with the added stimulation of his fingers pumping in and out of you. You nearly collapse backwards but his arms reach out and wrap around your waist, holding you to his chest. </p><p>\u201cI got you.\u201d He laughs, and you fall forward instead, collapsing against his chest as he falls back against the bed. </p><p>You feel numb all over in the best way. You can hear your heartbeat in your ears, your entire head, your chest, your arms, your entire body is beating in time with the incessant thumping. You can\u2019t remember the last time you felt this light, you\u2019re floating, or maybe you\u2019re lightheaded. Suddenly the room is a thousand degrees and you feel steaming hot to the touch. </p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d He asks, brushing your hair behind your ear, \u201cI can hear your heart beating.\u201d </p><p>\u201cJust got to,\u201d You pant, swallowing hard, \u201cGotta catch my breath.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMakes sense,\u201d He smirks, his arms snaking around your waist, \u201cI have been told my services are rather <i>breathtaking</i>.\u201d </p><p>You sit up, grabbing the closest pillow and stuff it over his face to which he flails beneath you, reaching around you to smack your bare ass. You nearly jump out of your skin, ripping the pillow from over his face to see him laughing hysterically, his hair an absolutely fucked out mess. </p><p>\u201cDid you just-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou are not about to get offended that I smacked your ass,\u201d He scoffs, grabbing your face and pulling your mouth to his with those stupid dimples popping from his cheeks, \u201cThat ass was smothering my face not even twenty minutes ago, love.\u201d </p><p>\u00a0***</p><p>You\u2019re spinning in your desk chair, quite obviously avoiding the Economics homework pulled up on your computer when your phone buzzes on your desk beside you. You pick it up expectantly, but the name Noah flashes across the screen rather than the name you\u2019ve been waiting for all day. </p><p>You lean back in your chair, staring up at the ceiling and sighing before muttering a quick, \u201cFuck it,\u201d and picking up your phone once again. </p><p>You dial the number easily, it\u2019s number one on your favorites list after all and he picks up by the second ring, \u201cThis another booty call?\u201d He teases and you hope to god that he\u2019s alone if he\u2019s talking like that. </p><p>\u201cI told you you\u2019re not allowed to answer the phone like that.\u201d You huff, getting up from your desk and wandering out to the kitchen to grab a snack. </p><p>\u201cYou also said I was absolutely never allowed to fuck your face but what did we do the other-\u201c</p><p>\u201cHarry shut the fuck up!\u201d You squeak, your cheeks suddenly flaming. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just proving my point, love.\u201d He laughs, sniffling slightly and you can tell he\u2019s outside. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing right now?\u201d You ask uneasily, biting your lip. </p><p>\u201cSkateboarding.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTo where?\u201d You question further, hoping he doesn\u2019t call you on the carpet for asking so many. </p><p>\u201cWait for it,\u201d He chuckles, his breath puffing out quicker as he picks up speed. </p><p>\u201cWait for wha-\u201c</p><p>Suddenly you\u2019re cut off as there\u2019s a knock on the door and then he\u2019s walking through it, his cheeks rosy and his hair a wind-whipped mess. </p><p>\u201cYou rang?\u201d He laughs, dropping his skateboard. </p><p>\u201cOh, <i>thank god</i>, the friend with benefits I ordered.\u201d You fawn dramatically, batting your eyelashes as you cross the space between the two of you. </p><p>\u201c<i>Hey</i>,\u201d He snaps, grabbing you by the backs of your thighs and hoisting you into his arms, \u201cI am a self-proclaimed long-term booty call and I will stand for nothing less.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be standing for a whole lot of anything if you would hurry up and get us into my room already,\u201d You smirk, throwing your arms over his shoulders, \u201c<i>Mister long term booty call</i>.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re getting it, <i>sweetheart</i>.\u201d He mocks, finally leaning forward and capturing your lips with his, walking the two of you back to your room and kicking the door closed with his foot.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p><i>so like this obviously has a lot of potential for a part two and was HEAVILY requested (thanks mitch) so if you\u2019d like that send me some ideas to include in a part two what do you guys want to see and also maybe get this to 1000 notes??

You put a bag of popcorn in the microwave as he shrugs off his denim jacket and tosses it on the hook in the hallway before kicking his vans off and throwing them underneath. </p><p>\u201cI mean you answered the question yourself,\u201d He says through a mouthful of chips, \u201cI could have that<i> if I wanted it</i>, but I don\u2019t, especially not with fucking Tiffany, more like <i>miss blowjob behind the Dennys</i>.\u201d </p><p>You swat him in the arm as he walks behind you to get to the fridge and grab a can of Fanta. He\u2019s laughing as he cracks it open and chugs some of it down, plucking the bag of popcorn out of your hand and pouring some into his mouth. </p><p>\u201cHarry! That was mine!\u201d You huff, rolling your eyes as you grab a soda for yourself. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still yours!\u201d He chuckles, collapsing on the couch with his backpack, \u201cI\u2019m just bringing it to the living room for you because I\u2019m just <i>that thoughtful</i>.\u201d </p><p>You walk around the corner to see him sat comfortably in the middle of the couch with all of the snacks piled up on the coffee table in front of him. He dumps out his backpack, adding two more bags of chips and six boxes of candy to the pile. </p><p>\u201cSomeone had a field day at the dollar store.\u201d You joke, reaching around him to grab a box of Mike and Ike. </p><p>\u201cSpent all ten bucks on you,\u201d He nods, shoving a Twizzler in his mouth, \u201cDon\u2019t let it go to your head.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t dream of it.\u201d You sigh, tucking your feet up under your legs as you get comfy. </p><p>He grabs the joint from behind his ear and takes the lighter out of his pocket, igniting the end. He sucks in a drag as he slumps further against the couch, running a hand through his overgrown mess of hair. </p><p>\u201cSo how is mister perfect?\u201d He muses, turning over to meet your eyes as he grabs the TV remote, \u201cStill perfect?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not perfect Harry, he\u2019s just-\u201c</p><p>\u201cA student professor at your college with medical insurance and the keys to a Tesla?\u201d He mocks, eyeing you over his shoulder as he starts flipping through the channels. </p><p>\u201cWould you shut up?\u201d You huff, grabbing the pillow from behind you and smacking him over the head. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He scoffs, \u201cAm I wrong? He\u2019s fucking boring, Y/N.\u201d </p><p>You roll your eyes as he pulls off his <i>Higgs </i>hoodie, revealing his Astroworld t-shirt. He slumps back against the couch and you grab his hoodie yourself, pulling it over your head. </p><p>\u201cSo what is it?\u201d He asks, breathing out another cloud of smoke, \u201cWhy isn\u2019t he perfect? Other than the fact that he\u2019s an absolute snore fest of course.\u201d </p><p>You shove him over with your shoulder and steal the joint out of his hand, placing it between your lips instead, \u201cHe\u2019s not boring Harry, he\u2019s\u2026safe.\u201d You sigh, taking another drag. </p><p>\u201c<i>Safe</i>?\u201d He taunts, snatching the Mike and Ike out of your hand, \u201cThat is exactly what you call someone that\u2019s <i>drop-dead boring</i>.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not-\u201c</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his favorite ice cream flavor?\u201d He asks instead, cutting you off. </p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d You think aloud, wishing you didn\u2019t have to say it, \u201cVanilla?\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>God,</i> Y/N! Are you <i>kidding</i> me?\u201d He groans, throwing his head back against the couch, \u201cWhat does he teach?\u201d </p><p>\u201cBiomedical engineering-\u201c</p><p>\u201cFucking hell!\u201d He shouts, cutting you off once again, \u201cHe\u2019s literally a piece of white bread, Y/N,\u201d He says, turning to face you on the couch, \u201c<i>God</i>, you know Wonderbread? That\u2019s him, he\u2019s a fucking piece of Wonderbread.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe is <i>not</i> a piece of Wonderbread, Harry,\u201d You defend, rolling your eyes, \u201cHe\u2019s a <i>stable guy</i>, with a <i>stable job</i>, and-\u201c</p><p>\u201cAt least tell me the sex is good.\u201d He cuts in once again, shoveling popcorn into his mouth. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s uh, the sex is um, it\u2019s fine-\u201c</p><p>\u201cOh my <i>god</i>, Y/N!\u201d He shouts, his voice nearly startling you, \u201cEven the sex is boring?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI did not say that-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to!\u201d He laughs, \u201cI\u2019ve known you for six years, I can tell when you\u2019re lying,\u201d He smirks obnoxiously, \u201cGod I can\u2019t believe even the sex is bad, what is it? You suck him off and then it\u2019s like five minutes of missionary or-\u201c</p><p>\u201c<i>Harry</i>!\u201d You squeal, grabbing the pillow you flung at him earlier and covering your blushing face with it instead. </p><p>\u201cOh, come on, you\u2019re acting like we don\u2019t talk about this shit.\u201d He huffs, grabbing the pillow from over your face and tossing it over his shoulder. </p><p>\u201c<i>You</i> talk about this shit, Harry,\u201d You laugh lightheartedly, \u201cWithout me asking you to, might I add.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell maybe if you were having better sex, you\u2019d want to talk about it.\u201d He shrugs, sticking his tongue out at you as he turns back to the TV. </p><p>\u201cMaybe if you were less promiscuous, you\u2019d talk about it less.\u201d You counter, leaning back against the couch and shoving your feet in his lap. </p><p>\u201cMaybe if you actually got some good sex, you\u2019d be less annoying.\u201d He teases, leaning back against the couch and folding his arms on top of your legs. </p><p>\u00a0You wake up to the light coming in through the living room window and peel your eyes open to see Harry underneath you. He\u2019s passed out cold, his head in your lap and his feet hanging off the edge of the couch. He must\u2019ve curled up on your lap after you fell asleep during your American Horror Story binge. \u00a0You suddenly hear a knock at the door and realize that must have been what woke you up, but who the hell is here this early in the morning? </p><p>You shove him off your lap and he grunts in protest, curling back up with one of the astray pillows as you stumble to your feet. You pass the kitchen on the way to the door and you catch the time lit up on the stove out of the corner of your eye. </p><p>One thirty? No way, it\u2019s not one thirty in the afternoon. <i>Sure</i>, you two didn\u2019t go to bed till four but it couldn\u2019t possibly be-</p><p>\u201cY/N? Hello?\u201d You hear your boyfriend\u2019s voice ask from behind the door as he continues knocking. </p><p>\u201cShit, shit, <i>shit</i>!\u201d You whisper to yourself, looking down to see yourself still dressed in the same sweatpants from yesterday and Harry\u2019s <i>Higgs</i> sweatshirt. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d Harry groans from the couch, standing up and running a hand through his messy bedhead. </p><p>\u201c<i>Mister perfect</i> is outside because I was supposed to go out to lunch with him today!\u201d You whisper harshly, trying to figure out how to get ready and air out the very present smell of weed in your apartment in the next three seconds. </p><p>\u201c<i>Lunch</i>? Who the fuck makes <i>plans</i> to go to lunch-\u201c</p><p>\u201cHarry! Not right now!\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell fine, why don\u2019t you go get dressed and I\u2019ll entertain the snooze fest for ten minutes.\u201d He suggests, walking past you to grab the door. </p><p>You cringe outwardly, your face screwing up into the worst expression as he pulls the door open and suddenly your two very separate worlds are colliding. Your boyfriend doesn\u2019t know you as some girl who smokes weed and inhales potato chips while bingeing TV shows with your best friend who\u2019s a self-proclaimed lady killer and proud retail associate at Zumiez. He knows you as Y/N, a girl he met studying at the library who enjoys critically acclaimed movies and going to brunch on Sunday. </p><p>\u201cHey there mate,\u201d Harry grins, gesturing inside, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just come in and chill, she\u2019ll be ready to go in like ten, maybe fifteen minutes, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve had the pleasure of getting to know each other.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd you are?\u201d Your boyfriend asks, raising his eyebrows as he passes Harry in the hallway. </p><p>\u201cHer best friend,\u201d Harry grins proudly, \u201cHarry.\u201d </p><p>Your boyfriend reaches out his hand to shake Harry\u2019s, but Harry grabs his hand and pulls him into a bro hug, clapping his back. You meet your boyfriend\u2019s eyes over Harry\u2019s shoulder, and he looks anything but pleased. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just be right out, I swear.\u201d You say quickly, darting to your room to get changed. </p><p>You slip on a pair of jeans and huff in annoyance as you strip out of Harry\u2019s stupid weed hoodie and put on a nice blouse instead. You spray yourself head to toe with perfume and brush your teeth twice to cover the smell of smoke sticking to you before shoving your feet into a pair of flats and rejoining the boys in the living room. </p><p>\u201cYou ready to go?\u201d Your boyfriend asks hurriedly, standing from the couch and effectively cutting Harry off in the middle of whatever they were talking about. </p><p>\u201cUm, yeah,\u201d You stutter, grabbing your purse and turning to Harry, \u201cYou can lock up when you leave, yeah?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYup, don\u2019t even worry about it,\u201d He nods, \u201cYou two have fun, <i>but not too much fun</i>.\u201d He jokes, making your boyfriend grimace. </p><p>You fake smile, waving goodbye and nearly dragging your boyfriend out of your apartment and to his car parked outside. He\u2019s still looking at you incredulously as you collapse into the car beside him and he starts it up, driving to the entrance of your complex. </p><p>He finally breaks the silence when you hit the first red light, \u201cYou never mentioned your uh-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI know, he\u2019s um, he\u2019s a lot,\u201d You explain, trying to carefully word your next thought, \u201cWe\u2019ve been friends for a long time.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe seems like a nice enough guy,\u201d He shrugs, \u201cDidn\u2019t really strike me as someone you\u2019d be best friends with however.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s just um, you know we\u2019ve been hanging out for so long he just kind of-\u201c</p><p>\u201cSticks around and hotboxes your apartment?\u201d He remarks, the judgement dripping from his voice. </p><p>Your stomach twists in the worst way when the words come out of his mouth. There it is, the sentence you were waiting for. The one that confirms he thinks of Harry exactly the way you thought he would. Harry is loud, and obnoxious, and stoned ninety percent of the time but he\u2019s your best friend in the whole world. He\u2019s held your hair over the toilet while you puked up vodka soda more times than you\u2019d like to count, and you don\u2019t even want to try and think of how many movie marathons you\u2019ve had at each other\u2019s houses till ungodly hours of the night. You love that son of a bitch, no matter how many girls he fucks in the backseat of his old ass Mustang or how many times he bums five bucks off you for a Whopper when he\u2019s got the munchies, he\u2019s your best friend, and maybe he\u2019s right about <i>mister perfect</i>. </p><p>\u00a0You walk back in your apartment expecting to see Harry still sprawled on the couch with the remote in his hand but he\u2019s nowhere to be found. You trudge your feet back to your bedroom and grab his <i>Higgs </i>hoodie off the ground, stripping out of your blouse and pulling the hoodie back over your head. You dial his number as you collapse on your bed, laying upside down with your feet pressed to the wall. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d He asks right away, not even bothering to say hello, \u201cHow was your lunch date?\u201d </p><p>\u201cDefinitely could\u2019ve gone better.\u201d You sigh, sitting back up when you feel the blood rushing to your head. </p><p>\u201cWhat happened? Did he order unseasoned chicken and steamed cauliflower?\u201d He teases. </p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d You laugh, rolling your eyes, \u201cI uh, I broke up with him.\u201d </p><p>You can hear the shuffle of movement on the other side of the phone and you can picture him sitting up quickly from laying down on his back just like you are, \u201cNo the fuck you didn\u2019t.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes the fuck I did.\u201d You chuckle, rolling over onto your stomach. </p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d He sighs, \u201cWhat finally made you put the last nail in the coffin?\u201d </p><p>\u201cRemember when you asked how the sex was?\u201d You grimace, covering your blushing face with your hand even though he can\u2019t see you. </p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He says uneasily, and you can almost hear the smirk in his voice. </p><p>\u201cWell there wasn\u2019t any,\u201d You gulp, awaiting his reaction, \u201cWe didn\u2019t-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou guys never fucked?\u201d He asks suddenly, cutting you off, \u201cY/N, you dated that guy for six months.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBelieve me, I know.\u201d You laugh, trying to break through the awkward air. </p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t had sex in six months?\u201d He asks again, clearly not able to wrap his head around the thought. </p><p>\u201cYes Harry, say it a little louder for your neighbors, would you?\u201d You joke, tying your hair up in a bun on top of your head. </p><p>\u201cGod, what a piece of fucking Wonderbread,\u201d He chuckles, cracking himself up with his own joke from earlier, \u201cSix months Y/N, that\u2019s like, that should be illegal.\u201d </p><p>\u201cProbably going to be a lot longer now.\u201d You mumble, walking to the kitchen to grab a tub of ice cream out of the freezer. </p><p>\u201cLonger? No way, I\u2019m not letting you do that to yourself,\u201d He laughs, \u201cWe\u2019re going out tonight and I\u2019m gonna wingman you so hard you\u2019ll definitely-\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d You sigh, cutting him off, \u201cYou know I don\u2019t do that shit Harry, I\u2019m not going to have sex with a total stranger.\u201d You say through a mouthful of ice cream. </p><p>\u201cWell, I mean, we could,\u201d He says, \u201cI\u2019m not a stranger.\u201d </p><p>You nearly choke on the huge bite of ice cream in your mouth when the words come out of his mouth. You almost drop the giant spoon in your hand as you set the ice cream down and press your phone to your ear to make sure you hear him properly. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, did you just fucking say-\u201c</p><p>\u201cY/N, it makes perfect sense,\u201d He reasons, \u201cWe know each other, too well probably, and I\u2019ve heard you complain after mediocre sex enough to know what you want.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo way! No you\u2019re not-\u201c</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve seen me naked plenty of times and I was there when you got that ass tattoo so I\u2019ve basically seen you in the nude-\u201c</p><p>\u201cThat is <i>not</i> the same thing.\u201d You cut in. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s close enough!\u201d He laughs, \u201cAll I\u2019m saying is I fucking know what I\u2019m doing, and I could make you feel good Y/N, something you apparently haven\u2019t experienced in six. Fucking. Months.\u201d </p><p>You close your eyes, pinching the bridge of your nose and trying to make your mind think straight. You can\u2019t do this, this is fucking insane right? Fucking your best friend? Fucking Harry? You can\u2019t have sex with Harry, he\u2019s fucking <i>Harry</i>! </p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d You say uneasily and fucking dammit if your subconscious didn\u2019t just slam her face into the wall, \u201cJust this once?\u201d </p><p>\u201cJust this once,\u201d He confirms, \u201cUnless of course you <i>want</i> to go for round two-\u201c</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get your hopes up, Styles,\u201d You warn, wanting to knock yourself out before you actually agree to something this insane, \u201cCan you be at my place in twenty minutes?\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>Twenty minutes</i>?\u201d He scoffs, \u201cY/N, there is an art to this, you think I just wake up and look this good? For the full experience I\u2019ve got to shower and shave and-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got half an hour until there is a strong possibility that I will change my mind.\u201d </p><p>\u201cUgh, fine,\u201d He sighs, and you swear you can hear him rolling his eyes, \u201cI\u2019ll be there in fifteen.\u201d </p><p>\u00a0As soon as you hang up the phone, your mind is whirling. Fifteen minutes. You\u2019ve got fifteen minutes until your best friend of six years is going to show up on your doorstep with every intention of seeing you naked. God. What have you done? </p><p>You hurry to your bathroom and brush your teeth first, gargling with mouth wash twice and checking your breath afterwards. Your hands are nearly shaking as you take your hair down from the bun on your head and you run your fingers through it, trying to sort out the tangles. Does it look better up? Will that make the act easier if your hair isn\u2019t like all over the place? Does leaving it down look too nice? </p><p>You shake your head in frustration and decide to leave it down as you walk back to your room and start shuffling through your dresser. What do you wear to have sex with your friend for the first time? Do you put on nice underwear or does that look like you\u2019re trying too hard? You definitely don\u2019t wear tan, seamless boyshorts, that\u2019s for sure. You wriggle out of your underwear and slide into a plain black thong instead. Not lace, not too fancy, and definitely not matching your bra but at least it\u2019s not spanx. </p><p>Do you put your jeans back on? Or just stay in his hoodie and some underwear? That\u2019s hot right? Are you supposed to be hot? Harry\u2019s not going to think you\u2019re hot whether you\u2019re dressed in nothing but a thong anyways. </p><p>There\u2019s a knock on the front door and you nearly jump out of your skin. God, he\u2019s here. You try to make a split-second decision to throw on a pair of shorts until the knocking sounds again and you realize he\u2019s locked out. You decide against the stupid shorts and walk back out to the living room, bracing yourself for what\u2019s about to happen. You could just <i>not answer the door</i>, tell him you fell asleep. It\u2019s happened before, he\u2019d believe you, wouldn\u2019t he? </p><p>\u201cY/N! It\u2019s fucking cold out here!\u201d He calls, banging his fist against the door. </p><p>You sigh, taking in a deep breath as you walk down the hallway to the front door and slide open the lock, pulling it open. The cold air hits you like a brick wall and Harry\u2019s face lights up upon seeing you before he shuffles past you into the warmth of your apartment. </p><p>He\u2019s still rubbing his hands together as he drops his skateboard inside and slides his backpack off one shoulder when your eyes rake over him, trying to compare his appearance to yours. He\u2019s in a plain pair of grey basketball shorts and his favorite Thrasher hoodie with a red hat pulled backwards over his unruly hair. He\u2019s anything but dressed up for the occasion and that\u2019s perfectly fine by you, you didn\u2019t sign up for the full <i>Harry Styles experience</i>. </p><p>\u201cGod it\u2019s warm in here,\u201d He groans, reaching for the thermostat to bump it down a few degrees, \u201cYou know, if you wore pants around the house you could probably save <i>loads</i> on your electric bill.\u201d </p><p>You can\u2019t find it in yourself to come up with something equally witty to throw back at him like you usually do. He\u2019s still cracking up at his own joke as he strips out of his hoodie and you\u2019re surprised to see his torso bare underneath. That\u2019s fine, you\u2019ve seen Harry shirtless before, many times actually, but this isn\u2019t like those times, is it? </p><p>He turns to look at you over his shoulder as he bends down to his backpack, grabbing his pack of pre-rolled joints and lighting one between his teeth. He stands back up with the joint between his teeth and puffs a cloud of smoke in your direction to which you roll your eyes and shove him. </p><p>\u201cSo, are we doing this?\u201d He asks, quirking his eyebrow up at you as he leads you the rest of the way into your apartment. </p><p>\u201cI um, I don\u2019t know, I think this was a bad idea we should just-\u201c</p><p>\u201cOh, no you don\u2019t.\u201d He laughs, cutting you off. </p><p>You\u2019re caught off guard as he takes the joint out of his mouth, balancing it between his two fingers and leans into you, pressing you into the wall and smashing his lips onto yours. He shotguns a puff of smoke into your mouth and you only cough a little bit, making him laugh as you swallow roughly. Suddenly his lips are moving against yours and <i>holy fuck</i> you\u2019re making out with your best friend, you\u2019re making out with <i>Harry</i>. </p><p>His free hand reaches to grip your waist, holding you in place against the wall as his other hand rests beside your head against the drywall, still gripping the smoking joint between his fingers. His hand hikes up the side of his hoodie, grabbing your naked hip and dragging his dull fingernails over your skin while his mouth continues moving with yours. You\u2019ve definitely never been kissed like this before, with this much skill and rhythm and the perfect amount of tongue but <i>of course he\u2019s a good kisser Y/N, he\u2019s had more than enough practice</i> you remind yourself. </p><p>It\u2019s not until his lips move away from yours and instead start to trail down your neck that you\u2019re suddenly painfully aware that this is <i>Harry</i>. Your best friend, <i>Harry Styles</i>, is kissing down your neck and <i>fuck is he biting your throat</i> and making your fucking knees buckle. </p><p>\u201cHarry?\u201d You gasp, wishing your voice wasn\u2019t so strained.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d He says, stopping his assault and looking up to meet your eyes, \u201cWhat? Too much teeth? I\u2019ll dial it back-\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d You sigh, trying to clear your head, \u201cJust enough teeth, I just um-\u201c</p><p>\u201cWant me to take off the hat?\u201d He suggests, grabbing it by the bill and tossing it behind him, \u201cThe hair is part of the experience, baby.\u201d He grins cheekily. </p><p>\u201cNo, Harry, <i>god</i>,\u201d You huff, rolling your eyes, \u201cI just um, I don\u2019t know if I can do this, what if this ruins our friendship? Like what if I give you a bad blowjob and you just-\u201c</p><p>\u201cWoah, woah, woah,\u201d He says, taking a drag, \u201cFor one, I wouldn\u2019t friend dump you over a shitty blowjob and two, you\u2019re not going to be giving any blowies you dolt, tonight is about you and making sure you get a hefty dose of orgasm to last you through the next six months.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s saying it\u2019s going to have to last me another six months?\u201d You scoff, hitting him in the arm. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just helping you prepare for the worst,\u201d He laughs, blowing another cloud of smoke into your face, \u201cNow will you please relax and let me finish my artistic masterpiece on your neck?\u201d </p><p>You roll your eyes as you lean back against the wall behind you and tilt your head back, allowing him further access to the skin of your throat. He grins, those stupid dimples indenting his cheeks as he leans back down and surprises you by grabbing the back of your neck and capturing your lips with his once again. His hands reach for the hem of his hoodie on your body, dragging it up and over your head, leaving you in nothing but your bright blue bra and black thong. </p><p>\u201cReally pulled out all the stops, huh?\u201d He teases, snaking his finger under your bra strap and snapping it against your skin. </p><p>\u201cSays the guy in the basketball shorts.\u201d You smirk, reaching forward to snap the band of his shorts against his hip. </p><p>The grin on his face is every bit devious as he grabs your hips, pulling you to him and ducking his head down to press his lips to yours once again. Suddenly the friction between the two of you is undeniable and you nearly hit the ground when Harry takes your bottom lip between his teeth. </p><p>\u201cBedroom?\u201d He pants, hardly pulling away from your lips long enough to get the single word out. </p><p>\u201cMhm.\u201d You hum, reverberating the word right back into his mouth as your lips move together. </p><p>He walks the both of you towards your bedroom door, still swung open from your hurried dash to get the door when he arrived. He nearly trips on two pairs of your shoes, swearing under his breath as he kicks them out of the way and leads you to the bed until the backs of your calves hit the mattress. </p><p>He pushes you down against the bed and your heart is nearly hammering out of your chest for the few seconds that you\u2019re laying there, staring up at him and his swollen lips and blown out irises. Who is this man in front of you? This isn\u2019t your high school best friend that used to put carrots up his nose at lunch and help you onto the roof of his house so you guys could smoke without his parents knowing. But it is. </p><p>\u201cYou good?\u201d He asks sincerely, kneeling in between your legs at the foot of the bed. </p><p>\u201cYup, just fine.\u201d You quip, trying to steady your breathing before he\u2019s close enough to hear your heart beating out of your chest. </p><p>\u201cGod Y/N, you have <i>got</i> to relax.\u201d He sighs, his hands running over your legs from your ankles to your thighs. </p><p>\u201cSorry if this is just,\u201d You pant, closing your eyes briefly, \u201cJust a lot to wrap my head around, okay?\u201d </p><p>He laughs and you know he\u2019s making a <i>that\u2019s what he said</i> joke in his head as he leans back over you, pressing his lips to your collar bone and then traveling further down your chest. </p><p>\u201cWould it be better if you weren\u2019t looking at me?\u201d He asks, looking up to meet your eyes as he drags your underwear off you, \u201cThink you could relax if you couldn\u2019t see me?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI mean, maybe, but how-\u201c</p><p>\u201cHere, get up.\u201d He says simply, cutting you off and throwing your underwear over his shoulder. </p><p>You\u2019re caught off guard as he instructs you to stand back up and he resumes your spot on the bed, his feet hanging off the edge quite a bit more than yours were. </p><p>\u201cCome over here.\u201d He says, reaching for your hand and you nearly feel like passing out as you kneel on the edge of the bed and crawl over to him, your naked ass in the air. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you-\u201c</p><p>\u201cPut this one here,\u201d He instructs, grabbing your right knee and placing it right beside his head, \u201cAnd put this one right here.\u201d He continues, grabbing your left knee and trying to drag it over his face to rest on the other side of his head. </p><p>\u201cWhat? No! Harry!\u201d You stutter, swatting his hand away but he grabs your leg tighter, meeting your eyes. </p><p>\u201cCome on Y/N, just ride my face, then you won\u2019t be looking at me while I-\u201c</p><p>\u201cDo <i>not</i> finish that sentence.\u201d You warn, your chest heaving as you wrap your arms around yourself to try to cover up at least a little. </p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d He says softly, his hand reaching out to grab your hip, \u201cDo you trust me?\u201d </p><p>You look up from the comforter beneath your knees to meet his stern eyes. There\u2019s not an ounce of teasing in his voice, no digs or cracking jokes, he\u2019s sincere and you\u2019re not sure you\u2019ve ever seen him look this serious. </p><p>\u201cIf at any point you want me to stop, you just say the word and we\u2019ll be done, we can put on a movie and act like this never happened, <i>I swear</i>,\u201d He says, squeezing your hip for emphasis, \u201cBut for now, can you just give me a <i>chance</i>?\u201d </p><p>You sigh, sitting back on your heels and staring at the ceiling fan whirring above you. This is insane. Sit on his face? Ride his face? He wants you to put <i>that</i> on his <i>mouth</i>, what if you fucking suffocate him? </p><p>\u201cHow do I do this again?\u201d You sigh, looking back down to meet his eyes. </p><p>He grins, grabbing your left knee once again and passing it over his face, placing it on the other side of his head. You cringe, preparing yourself to look down and see none other than fucking Harry\u2019s face between your thighs. </p><p>\u201cYou good?\u201d He asks again and the warmth of his breath directly on your core makes your thighs clench. </p><p>\u201cJust great,\u201d You grimace, \u201cAre you going to uh, get started down there, or?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to sit down first love,\u201d He laughs, his hands reaching around to grab your hips, \u201cCan\u2019t really reach you from way up there.\u201d </p><p>Love. That\u2019s new. Harry has definitely never called you love. You can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s saying it to comfort you because at this point, he can probably feel your heartbeat thumping in every cell of your body, many of which happen to be sitting on him at the current moment. You let out yet another sigh, bracing yourself as you lean off your knees, and onto the backs of your feet instead. </p><p>\u201cLike this?\u201d You ask cautiously, trying to keep yourself balanced on your heels so you don\u2019t crush him. </p><p>\u201cJust like that,\u201d He says, nodding his head and his nose brushes your clit, making you jump, \u201cShit, sorry.\u201d </p><p>\u201cCareful, Styles.\u201d You breathe, your legs already shaking. </p><p>You look down and meet his eyes, your cheeks instantly going aflame as he smirks at you with that stupid dimpled smile. His hair is splayed out beneath him, his eyes hooded as his hands move from your hips to your thighs, holding you in place as he licks one bold stripe up the center of your heat. </p><p>\u201c<i>Christ</i>.\u201d You sigh, your eyes falling closed as you suck in a sharp breath. </p><p>You hear him chuckle beneath you as he continues his assault, his hands locked around your jittering thighs as he licks up and down you, swirling his tongue in all the right ways. He sucks your bud into his mouth, pressing sloppy kisses to your core as he catches his breath before delving back into your heat. </p><p>\u201cH-Higher.\u201d You pant, leaning back on your hands that are firmly pressed to his chest behind you. </p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d He asks, licking a few stripes at just the perfect spot. </p><p>\u201cFuck, yes, right there,\u201d You breathe heavily, moving one of your hands from his chest to thread through his hair, \u201cBack and forth, horizontal.\u201d You pant, hoping he understands what you mean. </p><p>His tongue starts flicking back and forth across the perfect spot and you nearly lose your balance and fall forward at the surge of pleasure in the pit of your stomach. His arms reach up and grab your hips, holding you upright as you shudder, your eyes screwed shut. He continues the movement, darting back and forth between it and the sloppy kisses he resorts to in order to catch his breath as he reaches up your back to the clasp of your bra. He snaps it open with a quick flick of his skilled fingers and tosses it to the side, your full chest finally on display. </p><p>\u201cDid you just manage to get my bra off in the middle of all this?\u201d You gasp, your eyes fluttering open to meet his, still trained on you. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all in the wrist.\u201d He teases, purposefully nudging you with his nose this time. </p><p>You roll your eyes, reaching down to cover his face, wishing he would stop staring at you with that dimpled smirk on his face while his fucking mouth does <i>ungodly</i> things to your clit. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit,\u201d He smirks, \u201cThis is <i>much</i> hotter.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGod, would you please shut up and put your mouth to better use?\u201d You groan, uncovering his eyes once again. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t have to tell me twice.\u201d He jokes, returning his tongue to where you need him most, your knees buckling almost instantly. </p><p>It\u2019s only a couple seconds of that flicking movement that has you shuddering above him. He reaches up to tease your nipples, making you gasp and have to lean back on his chest once again. He\u2019s smirking proudly as you come undone above him, your thighs threatening to clench together and absolutely squish his head, but he couldn\u2019t care less. Your lip is nearly purple you\u2019re biting down on it so hard and Harry notices. You\u2019re keeping your moans contained but he won\u2019t be having any of that, you better tell him how good he\u2019s making you feel. </p><p>He leans you back to sit on his chest rather than kneeling over his face as you ride out your orgasm and you\u2019re just about to ask him what the hell he\u2019s doing when he pushes a finger into you. You nearly jump out of your skin at the overstimulation and your hands plant themselves firmly on the mattress on either side of his hips. </p><p>\u201cFeel good?\u201d He asks, trying to drag it out of you as he adds another finger, pumping into you relentlessly, and you involuntarily whimper. </p><p>\u201cMhm.\u201d You nod, biting your lip once again as his fingers curl inside you and your back arches, nearly tipping you over the edge for a second time already. </p><p>\u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake, let me hear you, Y/N.\u201d He grunts, adding his thumb to rub against your clit as his two fingers continue curling inside of you. </p><p>\u201cGod, Harry, fuck,\u201d You sputter, trying to get the words out, \u201cFuck me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou want me to stop?\u201d He asks, clearly not following, \u201cWant me to fuck you instead?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, asshat,\u201d You pant, \u201cFingers, fuck me, don\u2019t just curl them, in and out, you follow?\u201d </p><p>He\u2019s laughing as he nods, flipping his hair out of his face as he starts to pump his fingers in and out of you once again. You throw your head back in ecstasy, still balancing on your hands and gripping the duvet in your fists. </p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d He asks. </p><p>\u201cMuch.\u201d You breathe. </p><p>You move one hand from the mattress to grab him over his basketball shorts and he hisses through his teeth, his head suddenly falling back against the mattress. </p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d He grunts, pulling himself back up to meet your eyes, \u201cThis is about you-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d You nod, cutting him off. </p><p>He\u2019s staring at you wide eyed as you palm him through his shorts, not that he needs any help, he\u2019s already standing at stark attention against the waistband of his shorts. </p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t mean you can stop though, Styles.\u201d You smirk and he lets out a chuckle as he resumes. </p><p>\u201cYes ma\u2019am.\u201d He teases, rubbing his thumb back and forth against your clit perfectly. </p><p>The repeated movement is just enough to push you over the edge with the added stimulation of his fingers pumping in and out of you. You nearly collapse backwards but his arms reach out and wrap around your waist, holding you to his chest. </p><p>\u201cI got you.\u201d He laughs, and you fall forward instead, collapsing against his chest as he falls back against the bed. </p><p>You feel numb all over in the best way. You can hear your heartbeat in your ears, your entire head, your chest, your arms, your entire body is beating in time with the incessant thumping. You can\u2019t remember the last time you felt this light, you\u2019re floating, or maybe you\u2019re lightheaded. Suddenly the room is a thousand degrees and you feel steaming hot to the touch. </p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d He asks, brushing your hair behind your ear, \u201cI can hear your heart beating.\u201d </p><p>\u201cJust got to,\u201d You pant, swallowing hard, \u201cGotta catch my breath.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMakes sense,\u201d He smirks, his arms snaking around your waist, \u201cI have been told my services are rather <i>breathtaking</i>.\u201d </p><p>You sit up, grabbing the closest pillow and stuff it over his face to which he flails beneath you, reaching around you to smack your bare ass. You nearly jump out of your skin, ripping the pillow from over his face to see him laughing hysterically, his hair an absolutely fucked out mess. </p><p>\u201cDid you just-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou are not about to get offended that I smacked your ass,\u201d He scoffs, grabbing your face and pulling your mouth to his with those stupid dimples popping from his cheeks, \u201cThat ass was smothering my face not even twenty minutes ago, love.\u201d </p><p>\u00a0***</p><p>You\u2019re spinning in your desk chair, quite obviously avoiding the Economics homework pulled up on your computer when your phone buzzes on your desk beside you. You pick it up expectantly, but the name Noah flashes across the screen rather than the name you\u2019ve been waiting for all day. </p><p>You lean back in your chair, staring up at the ceiling and sighing before muttering a quick, \u201cFuck it,\u201d and picking up your phone once again. </p><p>You dial the number easily, it\u2019s number one on your favorites list after all and he picks up by the second ring, \u201cThis another booty call?\u201d He teases and you hope to god that he\u2019s alone if he\u2019s talking like that. </p><p>\u201cI told you you\u2019re not allowed to answer the phone like that.\u201d You huff, getting up from your desk and wandering out to the kitchen to grab a snack. </p><p>\u201cYou also said I was absolutely never allowed to fuck your face but what did we do the other-\u201c</p><p>\u201cHarry shut the fuck up!\u201d You squeak, your cheeks suddenly flaming. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just proving my point, love.\u201d He laughs, sniffling slightly and you can tell he\u2019s outside. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing right now?\u201d You ask uneasily, biting your lip. </p><p>\u201cSkateboarding.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTo where?\u201d You question further, hoping he doesn\u2019t call you on the carpet for asking so many. </p><p>\u201cWait for it,\u201d He chuckles, his breath puffing out quicker as he picks up speed. </p><p>\u201cWait for wha-\u201c</p><p>Suddenly you\u2019re cut off as there\u2019s a knock on the door and then he\u2019s walking through it, his cheeks rosy and his hair a wind-whipped mess. </p><p>\u201cYou rang?\u201d He laughs, dropping his skateboard. </p><p>\u201cOh, <i>thank god</i>, the friend with benefits I ordered.\u201d You fawn dramatically, batting your eyelashes as you cross the space between the two of you. </p><p>\u201c<i>Hey</i>,\u201d He snaps, grabbing you by the backs of your thighs and hoisting you into his arms, \u201cI am a self-proclaimed long-term booty call and I will stand for nothing less.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be standing for a whole lot of anything if you would hurry up and get us into my room already,\u201d You smirk, throwing your arms over his shoulders, \u201c<i>Mister long term booty call</i>.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re getting it, <i>sweetheart</i>.\u201d He mocks, finally leaning forward and capturing your lips with his, walking the two of you back to your room and kicking the door closed with his foot.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p><i>so like this obviously has a lot of potential for a part two and was HEAVILY requested (thanks mitch) so if you\u2019d like that send me some ideas to include in a part two what do you guys want to see and also maybe get this to 1000 notes?? That\u2019d be sick</i></p><p><i>love u guys</i></p><p><i>pls appreciate my sacrifice I was supposed to go to bed ages ago I work in 4 hours\u00a0</i></p></p>",

You put a bag of popcorn in the microwave as he shrugs off his denim jacket and tosses it on the hook in the hallway before kicking his vans off and throwing them underneath. </p><p>\u201cI mean you answered the question yourself,\u201d He says through a mouthful of chips, \u201cI could have that<i> if I wanted it</i>, but I don\u2019t, especially not with fucking Tiffany, more like <i>miss blowjob behind the Dennys</i>.\u201d </p><p>You swat him in the arm as he walks behind you to get to the fridge and grab a can of Fanta. He\u2019s laughing as he cracks it open and chugs some of it down, plucking the bag of popcorn out of your hand and pouring some into his mouth. </p><p>\u201cHarry! That was mine!\u201d You huff, rolling your eyes as you grab a soda for yourself. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still yours!\u201d He chuckles, collapsing on the couch with his backpack, \u201cI\u2019m just bringing it to the living room for you because I\u2019m just <i>that thoughtful</i>.\u201d </p><p>You walk around the corner to see him sat comfortably in the middle of the couch with all of the snacks piled up on the coffee table in front of him. He dumps out his backpack, adding two more bags of chips and six boxes of candy to the pile. </p><p>\u201cSomeone had a field day at the dollar store.\u201d You joke, reaching around him to grab a box of Mike and Ike. </p><p>\u201cSpent all ten bucks on you,\u201d He nods, shoving a Twizzler in his mouth, \u201cDon\u2019t let it go to your head.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t dream of it.\u201d You sigh, tucking your feet up under your legs as you get comfy. </p><p>He grabs the joint from behind his ear and takes the lighter out of his pocket, igniting the end. He sucks in a drag as he slumps further against the couch, running a hand through his overgrown mess of hair. </p><p>\u201cSo how is mister perfect?\u201d He muses, turning over to meet your eyes as he grabs the TV remote, \u201cStill perfect?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not perfect Harry, he\u2019s just-\u201c</p><p>\u201cA student professor at your college with medical insurance and the keys to a Tesla?\u201d He mocks, eyeing you over his shoulder as he starts flipping through the channels. </p><p>\u201cWould you shut up?\u201d You huff, grabbing the pillow from behind you and smacking him over the head. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He scoffs, \u201cAm I wrong? He\u2019s fucking boring, Y/N.\u201d </p><p>You roll your eyes as he pulls off his <i>Higgs </i>hoodie, revealing his Astroworld t-shirt. He slumps back against the couch and you grab his hoodie yourself, pulling it over your head. </p><p>\u201cSo what is it?\u201d He asks, breathing out another cloud of smoke, \u201cWhy isn\u2019t he perfect? Other than the fact that he\u2019s an absolute snore fest of course.\u201d </p><p>You shove him over with your shoulder and steal the joint out of his hand, placing it between your lips instead, \u201cHe\u2019s not boring Harry, he\u2019s\u2026safe.\u201d You sigh, taking another drag. </p><p>\u201c<i>Safe</i>?\u201d He taunts, snatching the Mike and Ike out of your hand, \u201cThat is exactly what you call someone that\u2019s <i>drop-dead boring</i>.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not-\u201c</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his favorite ice cream flavor?\u201d He asks instead, cutting you off. </p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d You think aloud, wishing you didn\u2019t have to say it, \u201cVanilla?\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>God,</i> Y/N! Are you <i>kidding</i> me?\u201d He groans, throwing his head back against the couch, \u201cWhat does he teach?\u201d </p><p>\u201cBiomedical engineering-\u201c</p><p>\u201cFucking hell!\u201d He shouts, cutting you off once again, \u201cHe\u2019s literally a piece of white bread, Y/N,\u201d He says, turning to face you on the couch, \u201c<i>God</i>, you know Wonderbread? That\u2019s him, he\u2019s a fucking piece of Wonderbread.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe is <i>not</i> a piece of Wonderbread, Harry,\u201d You defend, rolling your eyes, \u201cHe\u2019s a <i>stable guy</i>, with a <i>stable job</i>, and-\u201c</p><p>\u201cAt least tell me the sex is good.\u201d He cuts in once again, shoveling popcorn into his mouth. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s uh, the sex is um, it\u2019s fine-\u201c</p><p>\u201cOh my <i>god</i>, Y/N!\u201d He shouts, his voice nearly startling you, \u201cEven the sex is boring?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI did not say that-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to!\u201d He laughs, \u201cI\u2019ve known you for six years, I can tell when you\u2019re lying,\u201d He smirks obnoxiously, \u201cGod I can\u2019t believe even the sex is bad, what is it? You suck him off and then it\u2019s like five minutes of missionary or-\u201c</p><p>\u201c<i>Harry</i>!\u201d You squeal, grabbing the pillow you flung at him earlier and covering your blushing face with it instead. </p><p>\u201cOh, come on, you\u2019re acting like we don\u2019t talk about this shit.\u201d He huffs, grabbing the pillow from over your face and tossing it over his shoulder. </p><p>\u201c<i>You</i> talk about this shit, Harry,\u201d You laugh lightheartedly, \u201cWithout me asking you to, might I add.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell maybe if you were having better sex, you\u2019d want to talk about it.\u201d He shrugs, sticking his tongue out at you as he turns back to the TV. </p><p>\u201cMaybe if you were less promiscuous, you\u2019d talk about it less.\u201d You counter, leaning back against the couch and shoving your feet in his lap. </p><p>\u201cMaybe if you actually got some good sex, you\u2019d be less annoying.\u201d He teases, leaning back against the couch and folding his arms on top of your legs. </p><p>\u00a0You wake up to the light coming in through the living room window and peel your eyes open to see Harry underneath you. He\u2019s passed out cold, his head in your lap and his feet hanging off the edge of the couch. He must\u2019ve curled up on your lap after you fell asleep during your American Horror Story binge. \u00a0You suddenly hear a knock at the door and realize that must have been what woke you up, but who the hell is here this early in the morning? </p><p>You shove him off your lap and he grunts in protest, curling back up with one of the astray pillows as you stumble to your feet. You pass the kitchen on the way to the door and you catch the time lit up on the stove out of the corner of your eye. </p><p>One thirty? No way, it\u2019s not one thirty in the afternoon. <i>Sure</i>, you two didn\u2019t go to bed till four but it couldn\u2019t possibly be-</p><p>\u201cY/N? Hello?\u201d You hear your boyfriend\u2019s voice ask from behind the door as he continues knocking. </p><p>\u201cShit, shit, <i>shit</i>!\u201d You whisper to yourself, looking down to see yourself still dressed in the same sweatpants from yesterday and Harry\u2019s <i>Higgs</i> sweatshirt. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d Harry groans from the couch, standing up and running a hand through his messy bedhead. </p><p>\u201c<i>Mister perfect</i> is outside because I was supposed to go out to lunch with him today!\u201d You whisper harshly, trying to figure out how to get ready and air out the very present smell of weed in your apartment in the next three seconds. </p><p>\u201c<i>Lunch</i>? Who the fuck makes <i>plans</i> to go to lunch-\u201c</p><p>\u201cHarry! Not right now!\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell fine, why don\u2019t you go get dressed and I\u2019ll entertain the snooze fest for ten minutes.\u201d He suggests, walking past you to grab the door. </p><p>You cringe outwardly, your face screwing up into the worst expression as he pulls the door open and suddenly your two very separate worlds are colliding. Your boyfriend doesn\u2019t know you as some girl who smokes weed and inhales potato chips while bingeing TV shows with your best friend who\u2019s a self-proclaimed lady killer and proud retail associate at Zumiez. He knows you as Y/N, a girl he met studying at the library who enjoys critically acclaimed movies and going to brunch on Sunday. </p><p>\u201cHey there mate,\u201d Harry grins, gesturing inside, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just come in and chill, she\u2019ll be ready to go in like ten, maybe fifteen minutes, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve had the pleasure of getting to know each other.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd you are?\u201d Your boyfriend asks, raising his eyebrows as he passes Harry in the hallway. </p><p>\u201cHer best friend,\u201d Harry grins proudly, \u201cHarry.\u201d </p><p>Your boyfriend reaches out his hand to shake Harry\u2019s, but Harry grabs his hand and pulls him into a bro hug, clapping his back. You meet your boyfriend\u2019s eyes over Harry\u2019s shoulder, and he looks anything but pleased. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just be right out, I swear.\u201d You say quickly, darting to your room to get changed. </p><p>You slip on a pair of jeans and huff in annoyance as you strip out of Harry\u2019s stupid weed hoodie and put on a nice blouse instead. You spray yourself head to toe with perfume and brush your teeth twice to cover the smell of smoke sticking to you before shoving your feet into a pair of flats and rejoining the boys in the living room. </p><p>\u201cYou ready to go?\u201d Your boyfriend asks hurriedly, standing from the couch and effectively cutting Harry off in the middle of whatever they were talking about. </p><p>\u201cUm, yeah,\u201d You stutter, grabbing your purse and turning to Harry, \u201cYou can lock up when you leave, yeah?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYup, don\u2019t even worry about it,\u201d He nods, \u201cYou two have fun, <i>but not too much fun</i>.\u201d He jokes, making your boyfriend grimace. </p><p>You fake smile, waving goodbye and nearly dragging your boyfriend out of your apartment and to his car parked outside. He\u2019s still looking at you incredulously as you collapse into the car beside him and he starts it up, driving to the entrance of your complex. </p><p>He finally breaks the silence when you hit the first red light, \u201cYou never mentioned your uh-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI know, he\u2019s um, he\u2019s a lot,\u201d You explain, trying to carefully word your next thought, \u201cWe\u2019ve been friends for a long time.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe seems like a nice enough guy,\u201d He shrugs, \u201cDidn\u2019t really strike me as someone you\u2019d be best friends with however.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s just um, you know we\u2019ve been hanging out for so long he just kind of-\u201c</p><p>\u201cSticks around and hotboxes your apartment?\u201d He remarks, the judgement dripping from his voice. </p><p>Your stomach twists in the worst way when the words come out of his mouth. There it is, the sentence you were waiting for. The one that confirms he thinks of Harry exactly the way you thought he would. Harry is loud, and obnoxious, and stoned ninety percent of the time but he\u2019s your best friend in the whole world. He\u2019s held your hair over the toilet while you puked up vodka soda more times than you\u2019d like to count, and you don\u2019t even want to try and think of how many movie marathons you\u2019ve had at each other\u2019s houses till ungodly hours of the night. You love that son of a bitch, no matter how many girls he fucks in the backseat of his old ass Mustang or how many times he bums five bucks off you for a Whopper when he\u2019s got the munchies, he\u2019s your best friend, and maybe he\u2019s right about <i>mister perfect</i>. </p><p>\u00a0You walk back in your apartment expecting to see Harry still sprawled on the couch with the remote in his hand but he\u2019s nowhere to be found. You trudge your feet back to your bedroom and grab his <i>Higgs </i>hoodie off the ground, stripping out of your blouse and pulling the hoodie back over your head. You dial his number as you collapse on your bed, laying upside down with your feet pressed to the wall. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d He asks right away, not even bothering to say hello, \u201cHow was your lunch date?\u201d </p><p>\u201cDefinitely could\u2019ve gone better.\u201d You sigh, sitting back up when you feel the blood rushing to your head. </p><p>\u201cWhat happened? Did he order unseasoned chicken and steamed cauliflower?\u201d He teases. </p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d You laugh, rolling your eyes, \u201cI uh, I broke up with him.\u201d </p><p>You can hear the shuffle of movement on the other side of the phone and you can picture him sitting up quickly from laying down on his back just like you are, \u201cNo the fuck you didn\u2019t.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes the fuck I did.\u201d You chuckle, rolling over onto your stomach. </p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d He sighs, \u201cWhat finally made you put the last nail in the coffin?\u201d </p><p>\u201cRemember when you asked how the sex was?\u201d You grimace, covering your blushing face with your hand even though he can\u2019t see you. </p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He says uneasily, and you can almost hear the smirk in his voice. </p><p>\u201cWell there wasn\u2019t any,\u201d You gulp, awaiting his reaction, \u201cWe didn\u2019t-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou guys never fucked?\u201d He asks suddenly, cutting you off, \u201cY/N, you dated that guy for six months.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBelieve me, I know.\u201d You laugh, trying to break through the awkward air. </p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t had sex in six months?\u201d He asks again, clearly not able to wrap his head around the thought. </p><p>\u201cYes Harry, say it a little louder for your neighbors, would you?\u201d You joke, tying your hair up in a bun on top of your head. </p><p>\u201cGod, what a piece of fucking Wonderbread,\u201d He chuckles, cracking himself up with his own joke from earlier, \u201cSix months Y/N, that\u2019s like, that should be illegal.\u201d </p><p>\u201cProbably going to be a lot longer now.\u201d You mumble, walking to the kitchen to grab a tub of ice cream out of the freezer. </p><p>\u201cLonger? No way, I\u2019m not letting you do that to yourself,\u201d He laughs, \u201cWe\u2019re going out tonight and I\u2019m gonna wingman you so hard you\u2019ll definitely-\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d You sigh, cutting him off, \u201cYou know I don\u2019t do that shit Harry, I\u2019m not going to have sex with a total stranger.\u201d You say through a mouthful of ice cream. </p><p>\u201cWell, I mean, we could,\u201d He says, \u201cI\u2019m not a stranger.\u201d </p><p>You nearly choke on the huge bite of ice cream in your mouth when the words come out of his mouth. You almost drop the giant spoon in your hand as you set the ice cream down and press your phone to your ear to make sure you hear him properly. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, did you just fucking say-\u201c</p><p>\u201cY/N, it makes perfect sense,\u201d He reasons, \u201cWe know each other, too well probably, and I\u2019ve heard you complain after mediocre sex enough to know what you want.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo way! No you\u2019re not-\u201c</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve seen me naked plenty of times and I was there when you got that ass tattoo so I\u2019ve basically seen you in the nude-\u201c</p><p>\u201cThat is <i>not</i> the same thing.\u201d You cut in. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s close enough!\u201d He laughs, \u201cAll I\u2019m saying is I fucking know what I\u2019m doing, and I could make you feel good Y/N, something you apparently haven\u2019t experienced in six. Fucking. Months.\u201d </p><p>You close your eyes, pinching the bridge of your nose and trying to make your mind think straight. You can\u2019t do this, this is fucking insane right? Fucking your best friend? Fucking Harry? You can\u2019t have sex with Harry, he\u2019s fucking <i>Harry</i>! </p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d You say uneasily and fucking dammit if your subconscious didn\u2019t just slam her face into the wall, \u201cJust this once?\u201d </p><p>\u201cJust this once,\u201d He confirms, \u201cUnless of course you <i>want</i> to go for round two-\u201c</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get your hopes up, Styles,\u201d You warn, wanting to knock yourself out before you actually agree to something this insane, \u201cCan you be at my place in twenty minutes?\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>Twenty minutes</i>?\u201d He scoffs, \u201cY/N, there is an art to this, you think I just wake up and look this good? For the full experience I\u2019ve got to shower and shave and-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got half an hour until there is a strong possibility that I will change my mind.\u201d </p><p>\u201cUgh, fine,\u201d He sighs, and you swear you can hear him rolling his eyes, \u201cI\u2019ll be there in fifteen.\u201d </p><p>\u00a0As soon as you hang up the phone, your mind is whirling. Fifteen minutes. You\u2019ve got fifteen minutes until your best friend of six years is going to show up on your doorstep with every intention of seeing you naked. God. What have you done? </p><p>You hurry to your bathroom and brush your teeth first, gargling with mouth wash twice and checking your breath afterwards. Your hands are nearly shaking as you take your hair down from the bun on your head and you run your fingers through it, trying to sort out the tangles. Does it look better up? Will that make the act easier if your hair isn\u2019t like all over the place? Does leaving it down look too nice? </p><p>You shake your head in frustration and decide to leave it down as you walk back to your room and start shuffling through your dresser. What do you wear to have sex with your friend for the first time? Do you put on nice underwear or does that look like you\u2019re trying too hard? You definitely don\u2019t wear tan, seamless boyshorts, that\u2019s for sure. You wriggle out of your underwear and slide into a plain black thong instead. Not lace, not too fancy, and definitely not matching your bra but at least it\u2019s not spanx. </p><p>Do you put your jeans back on? Or just stay in his hoodie and some underwear? That\u2019s hot right? Are you supposed to be hot? Harry\u2019s not going to think you\u2019re hot whether you\u2019re dressed in nothing but a thong anyways. </p><p>There\u2019s a knock on the front door and you nearly jump out of your skin. God, he\u2019s here. You try to make a split-second decision to throw on a pair of shorts until the knocking sounds again and you realize he\u2019s locked out. You decide against the stupid shorts and walk back out to the living room, bracing yourself for what\u2019s about to happen. You could just <i>not answer the door</i>, tell him you fell asleep. It\u2019s happened before, he\u2019d believe you, wouldn\u2019t he? </p><p>\u201cY/N! It\u2019s fucking cold out here!\u201d He calls, banging his fist against the door. </p><p>You sigh, taking in a deep breath as you walk down the hallway to the front door and slide open the lock, pulling it open. The cold air hits you like a brick wall and Harry\u2019s face lights up upon seeing you before he shuffles past you into the warmth of your apartment. </p><p>He\u2019s still rubbing his hands together as he drops his skateboard inside and slides his backpack off one shoulder when your eyes rake over him, trying to compare his appearance to yours. He\u2019s in a plain pair of grey basketball shorts and his favorite Thrasher hoodie with a red hat pulled backwards over his unruly hair. He\u2019s anything but dressed up for the occasion and that\u2019s perfectly fine by you, you didn\u2019t sign up for the full <i>Harry Styles experience</i>. </p><p>\u201cGod it\u2019s warm in here,\u201d He groans, reaching for the thermostat to bump it down a few degrees, \u201cYou know, if you wore pants around the house you could probably save <i>loads</i> on your electric bill.\u201d </p><p>You can\u2019t find it in yourself to come up with something equally witty to throw back at him like you usually do. He\u2019s still cracking up at his own joke as he strips out of his hoodie and you\u2019re surprised to see his torso bare underneath. That\u2019s fine, you\u2019ve seen Harry shirtless before, many times actually, but this isn\u2019t like those times, is it? </p><p>He turns to look at you over his shoulder as he bends down to his backpack, grabbing his pack of pre-rolled joints and lighting one between his teeth. He stands back up with the joint between his teeth and puffs a cloud of smoke in your direction to which you roll your eyes and shove him. </p><p>\u201cSo, are we doing this?\u201d He asks, quirking his eyebrow up at you as he leads you the rest of the way into your apartment. </p><p>\u201cI um, I don\u2019t know, I think this was a bad idea we should just-\u201c</p><p>\u201cOh, no you don\u2019t.\u201d He laughs, cutting you off. </p><p>You\u2019re caught off guard as he takes the joint out of his mouth, balancing it between his two fingers and leans into you, pressing you into the wall and smashing his lips onto yours. He shotguns a puff of smoke into your mouth and you only cough a little bit, making him laugh as you swallow roughly. Suddenly his lips are moving against yours and <i>holy fuck</i> you\u2019re making out with your best friend, you\u2019re making out with <i>Harry</i>. </p><p>His free hand reaches to grip your waist, holding you in place against the wall as his other hand rests beside your head against the drywall, still gripping the smoking joint between his fingers. His hand hikes up the side of his hoodie, grabbing your naked hip and dragging his dull fingernails over your skin while his mouth continues moving with yours. You\u2019ve definitely never been kissed like this before, with this much skill and rhythm and the perfect amount of tongue but <i>of course he\u2019s a good kisser Y/N, he\u2019s had more than enough practice</i> you remind yourself. </p><p>It\u2019s not until his lips move away from yours and instead start to trail down your neck that you\u2019re suddenly painfully aware that this is <i>Harry</i>. Your best friend, <i>Harry Styles</i>, is kissing down your neck and <i>fuck is he biting your throat</i> and making your fucking knees buckle. </p><p>\u201cHarry?\u201d You gasp, wishing your voice wasn\u2019t so strained.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d He says, stopping his assault and looking up to meet your eyes, \u201cWhat? Too much teeth? I\u2019ll dial it back-\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d You sigh, trying to clear your head, \u201cJust enough teeth, I just um-\u201c</p><p>\u201cWant me to take off the hat?\u201d He suggests, grabbing it by the bill and tossing it behind him, \u201cThe hair is part of the experience, baby.\u201d He grins cheekily. </p><p>\u201cNo, Harry, <i>god</i>,\u201d You huff, rolling your eyes, \u201cI just um, I don\u2019t know if I can do this, what if this ruins our friendship? Like what if I give you a bad blowjob and you just-\u201c</p><p>\u201cWoah, woah, woah,\u201d He says, taking a drag, \u201cFor one, I wouldn\u2019t friend dump you over a shitty blowjob and two, you\u2019re not going to be giving any blowies you dolt, tonight is about you and making sure you get a hefty dose of orgasm to last you through the next six months.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s saying it\u2019s going to have to last me another six months?\u201d You scoff, hitting him in the arm. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just helping you prepare for the worst,\u201d He laughs, blowing another cloud of smoke into your face, \u201cNow will you please relax and let me finish my artistic masterpiece on your neck?\u201d </p><p>You roll your eyes as you lean back against the wall behind you and tilt your head back, allowing him further access to the skin of your throat. He grins, those stupid dimples indenting his cheeks as he leans back down and surprises you by grabbing the back of your neck and capturing your lips with his once again. His hands reach for the hem of his hoodie on your body, dragging it up and over your head, leaving you in nothing but your bright blue bra and black thong. </p><p>\u201cReally pulled out all the stops, huh?\u201d He teases, snaking his finger under your bra strap and snapping it against your skin. </p><p>\u201cSays the guy in the basketball shorts.\u201d You smirk, reaching forward to snap the band of his shorts against his hip. </p><p>The grin on his face is every bit devious as he grabs your hips, pulling you to him and ducking his head down to press his lips to yours once again. Suddenly the friction between the two of you is undeniable and you nearly hit the ground when Harry takes your bottom lip between his teeth. </p><p>\u201cBedroom?\u201d He pants, hardly pulling away from your lips long enough to get the single word out. </p><p>\u201cMhm.\u201d You hum, reverberating the word right back into his mouth as your lips move together. </p><p>He walks the both of you towards your bedroom door, still swung open from your hurried dash to get the door when he arrived. He nearly trips on two pairs of your shoes, swearing under his breath as he kicks them out of the way and leads you to the bed until the backs of your calves hit the mattress. </p><p>He pushes you down against the bed and your heart is nearly hammering out of your chest for the few seconds that you\u2019re laying there, staring up at him and his swollen lips and blown out irises. Who is this man in front of you? This isn\u2019t your high school best friend that used to put carrots up his nose at lunch and help you onto the roof of his house so you guys could smoke without his parents knowing. But it is. </p><p>\u201cYou good?\u201d He asks sincerely, kneeling in between your legs at the foot of the bed. </p><p>\u201cYup, just fine.\u201d You quip, trying to steady your breathing before he\u2019s close enough to hear your heart beating out of your chest. </p><p>\u201cGod Y/N, you have <i>got</i> to relax.\u201d He sighs, his hands running over your legs from your ankles to your thighs. </p><p>\u201cSorry if this is just,\u201d You pant, closing your eyes briefly, \u201cJust a lot to wrap my head around, okay?\u201d </p><p>He laughs and you know he\u2019s making a <i>that\u2019s what he said</i> joke in his head as he leans back over you, pressing his lips to your collar bone and then traveling further down your chest. </p><p>\u201cWould it be better if you weren\u2019t looking at me?\u201d He asks, looking up to meet your eyes as he drags your underwear off you, \u201cThink you could relax if you couldn\u2019t see me?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI mean, maybe, but how-\u201c</p><p>\u201cHere, get up.\u201d He says simply, cutting you off and throwing your underwear over his shoulder. </p><p>You\u2019re caught off guard as he instructs you to stand back up and he resumes your spot on the bed, his feet hanging off the edge quite a bit more than yours were. </p><p>\u201cCome over here.\u201d He says, reaching for your hand and you nearly feel like passing out as you kneel on the edge of the bed and crawl over to him, your naked ass in the air. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you-\u201c</p><p>\u201cPut this one here,\u201d He instructs, grabbing your right knee and placing it right beside his head, \u201cAnd put this one right here.\u201d He continues, grabbing your left knee and trying to drag it over his face to rest on the other side of his head. </p><p>\u201cWhat? No! Harry!\u201d You stutter, swatting his hand away but he grabs your leg tighter, meeting your eyes. </p><p>\u201cCome on Y/N, just ride my face, then you won\u2019t be looking at me while I-\u201c</p><p>\u201cDo <i>not</i> finish that sentence.\u201d You warn, your chest heaving as you wrap your arms around yourself to try to cover up at least a little. </p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d He says softly, his hand reaching out to grab your hip, \u201cDo you trust me?\u201d </p><p>You look up from the comforter beneath your knees to meet his stern eyes. There\u2019s not an ounce of teasing in his voice, no digs or cracking jokes, he\u2019s sincere and you\u2019re not sure you\u2019ve ever seen him look this serious. </p><p>\u201cIf at any point you want me to stop, you just say the word and we\u2019ll be done, we can put on a movie and act like this never happened, <i>I swear</i>,\u201d He says, squeezing your hip for emphasis, \u201cBut for now, can you just give me a <i>chance</i>?\u201d </p><p>You sigh, sitting back on your heels and staring at the ceiling fan whirring above you. This is insane. Sit on his face? Ride his face? He wants you to put <i>that</i> on his <i>mouth</i>, what if you fucking suffocate him? </p><p>\u201cHow do I do this again?\u201d You sigh, looking back down to meet his eyes. </p><p>He grins, grabbing your left knee once again and passing it over his face, placing it on the other side of his head. You cringe, preparing yourself to look down and see none other than fucking Harry\u2019s face between your thighs. </p><p>\u201cYou good?\u201d He asks again and the warmth of his breath directly on your core makes your thighs clench. </p><p>\u201cJust great,\u201d You grimace, \u201cAre you going to uh, get started down there, or?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to sit down first love,\u201d He laughs, his hands reaching around to grab your hips, \u201cCan\u2019t really reach you from way up there.\u201d </p><p>Love. That\u2019s new. Harry has definitely never called you love. You can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s saying it to comfort you because at this point, he can probably feel your heartbeat thumping in every cell of your body, many of which happen to be sitting on him at the current moment. You let out yet another sigh, bracing yourself as you lean off your knees, and onto the backs of your feet instead. </p><p>\u201cLike this?\u201d You ask cautiously, trying to keep yourself balanced on your heels so you don\u2019t crush him. </p><p>\u201cJust like that,\u201d He says, nodding his head and his nose brushes your clit, making you jump, \u201cShit, sorry.\u201d </p><p>\u201cCareful, Styles.\u201d You breathe, your legs already shaking. </p><p>You look down and meet his eyes, your cheeks instantly going aflame as he smirks at you with that stupid dimpled smile. His hair is splayed out beneath him, his eyes hooded as his hands move from your hips to your thighs, holding you in place as he licks one bold stripe up the center of your heat. </p><p>\u201c<i>Christ</i>.\u201d You sigh, your eyes falling closed as you suck in a sharp breath. </p><p>You hear him chuckle beneath you as he continues his assault, his hands locked around your jittering thighs as he licks up and down you, swirling his tongue in all the right ways. He sucks your bud into his mouth, pressing sloppy kisses to your core as he catches his breath before delving back into your heat. </p><p>\u201cH-Higher.\u201d You pant, leaning back on your hands that are firmly pressed to his chest behind you. </p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d He asks, licking a few stripes at just the perfect spot. </p><p>\u201cFuck, yes, right there,\u201d You breathe heavily, moving one of your hands from his chest to thread through his hair, \u201cBack and forth, horizontal.\u201d You pant, hoping he understands what you mean. </p><p>His tongue starts flicking back and forth across the perfect spot and you nearly lose your balance and fall forward at the surge of pleasure in the pit of your stomach. His arms reach up and grab your hips, holding you upright as you shudder, your eyes screwed shut. He continues the movement, darting back and forth between it and the sloppy kisses he resorts to in order to catch his breath as he reaches up your back to the clasp of your bra. He snaps it open with a quick flick of his skilled fingers and tosses it to the side, your full chest finally on display. </p><p>\u201cDid you just manage to get my bra off in the middle of all this?\u201d You gasp, your eyes fluttering open to meet his, still trained on you. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all in the wrist.\u201d He teases, purposefully nudging you with his nose this time. </p><p>You roll your eyes, reaching down to cover his face, wishing he would stop staring at you with that dimpled smirk on his face while his fucking mouth does <i>ungodly</i> things to your clit. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit,\u201d He smirks, \u201cThis is <i>much</i> hotter.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGod, would you please shut up and put your mouth to better use?\u201d You groan, uncovering his eyes once again. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t have to tell me twice.\u201d He jokes, returning his tongue to where you need him most, your knees buckling almost instantly. </p><p>It\u2019s only a couple seconds of that flicking movement that has you shuddering above him. He reaches up to tease your nipples, making you gasp and have to lean back on his chest once again. He\u2019s smirking proudly as you come undone above him, your thighs threatening to clench together and absolutely squish his head, but he couldn\u2019t care less. Your lip is nearly purple you\u2019re biting down on it so hard and Harry notices. You\u2019re keeping your moans contained but he won\u2019t be having any of that, you better tell him how good he\u2019s making you feel. </p><p>He leans you back to sit on his chest rather than kneeling over his face as you ride out your orgasm and you\u2019re just about to ask him what the hell he\u2019s doing when he pushes a finger into you. You nearly jump out of your skin at the overstimulation and your hands plant themselves firmly on the mattress on either side of his hips. </p><p>\u201cFeel good?\u201d He asks, trying to drag it out of you as he adds another finger, pumping into you relentlessly, and you involuntarily whimper. </p><p>\u201cMhm.\u201d You nod, biting your lip once again as his fingers curl inside you and your back arches, nearly tipping you over the edge for a second time already. </p><p>\u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake, let me hear you, Y/N.\u201d He grunts, adding his thumb to rub against your clit as his two fingers continue curling inside of you. </p><p>\u201cGod, Harry, fuck,\u201d You sputter, trying to get the words out, \u201cFuck me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou want me to stop?\u201d He asks, clearly not following, \u201cWant me to fuck you instead?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, asshat,\u201d You pant, \u201cFingers, fuck me, don\u2019t just curl them, in and out, you follow?\u201d </p><p>He\u2019s laughing as he nods, flipping his hair out of his face as he starts to pump his fingers in and out of you once again. You throw your head back in ecstasy, still balancing on your hands and gripping the duvet in your fists. </p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d He asks. </p><p>\u201cMuch.\u201d You breathe. </p><p>You move one hand from the mattress to grab him over his basketball shorts and he hisses through his teeth, his head suddenly falling back against the mattress. </p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d He grunts, pulling himself back up to meet your eyes, \u201cThis is about you-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d You nod, cutting him off. </p><p>He\u2019s staring at you wide eyed as you palm him through his shorts, not that he needs any help, he\u2019s already standing at stark attention against the waistband of his shorts. </p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t mean you can stop though, Styles.\u201d You smirk and he lets out a chuckle as he resumes. </p><p>\u201cYes ma\u2019am.\u201d He teases, rubbing his thumb back and forth against your clit perfectly. </p><p>The repeated movement is just enough to push you over the edge with the added stimulation of his fingers pumping in and out of you. You nearly collapse backwards but his arms reach out and wrap around your waist, holding you to his chest. </p><p>\u201cI got you.\u201d He laughs, and you fall forward instead, collapsing against his chest as he falls back against the bed. </p><p>You feel numb all over in the best way. You can hear your heartbeat in your ears, your entire head, your chest, your arms, your entire body is beating in time with the incessant thumping. You can\u2019t remember the last time you felt this light, you\u2019re floating, or maybe you\u2019re lightheaded. Suddenly the room is a thousand degrees and you feel steaming hot to the touch. </p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d He asks, brushing your hair behind your ear, \u201cI can hear your heart beating.\u201d </p><p>\u201cJust got to,\u201d You pant, swallowing hard, \u201cGotta catch my breath.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMakes sense,\u201d He smirks, his arms snaking around your waist, \u201cI have been told my services are rather <i>breathtaking</i>.\u201d </p><p>You sit up, grabbing the closest pillow and stuff it over his face to which he flails beneath you, reaching around you to smack your bare ass. You nearly jump out of your skin, ripping the pillow from over his face to see him laughing hysterically, his hair an absolutely fucked out mess. </p><p>\u201cDid you just-\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou are not about to get offended that I smacked your ass,\u201d He scoffs, grabbing your face and pulling your mouth to his with those stupid dimples popping from his cheeks, \u201cThat ass was smothering my face not even twenty minutes ago, love.\u201d </p><p>\u00a0***</p><p>You\u2019re spinning in your desk chair, quite obviously avoiding the Economics homework pulled up on your computer when your phone buzzes on your desk beside you. You pick it up expectantly, but the name Noah flashes across the screen rather than the name you\u2019ve been waiting for all day. </p><p>You lean back in your chair, staring up at the ceiling and sighing before muttering a quick, \u201cFuck it,\u201d and picking up your phone once again. </p><p>You dial the number easily, it\u2019s number one on your favorites list after all and he picks up by the second ring, \u201cThis another booty call?\u201d He teases and you hope to god that he\u2019s alone if he\u2019s talking like that. </p><p>\u201cI told you you\u2019re not allowed to answer the phone like that.\u201d You huff, getting up from your desk and wandering out to the kitchen to grab a snack. </p><p>\u201cYou also said I was absolutely never allowed to fuck your face but what did we do the other-\u201c</p><p>\u201cHarry shut the fuck up!\u201d You squeak, your cheeks suddenly flaming. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just proving my point, love.\u201d He laughs, sniffling slightly and you can tell he\u2019s outside. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing right now?\u201d You ask uneasily, biting your lip. </p><p>\u201cSkateboarding.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTo where?\u201d You question further, hoping he doesn\u2019t call you on the carpet for asking so many. </p><p>\u201cWait for it,\u201d He chuckles, his breath puffing out quicker as he picks up speed. </p><p>\u201cWait for wha-\u201c</p><p>Suddenly you\u2019re cut off as there\u2019s a knock on the door and then he\u2019s walking through it, his cheeks rosy and his hair a wind-whipped mess. </p><p>\u201cYou rang?\u201d He laughs, dropping his skateboard. </p><p>\u201cOh, <i>thank god</i>, the friend with benefits I ordered.\u201d You fawn dramatically, batting your eyelashes as you cross the space between the two of you. </p><p>\u201c<i>Hey</i>,\u201d He snaps, grabbing you by the backs of your thighs and hoisting you into his arms, \u201cI am a self-proclaimed long-term booty call and I will stand for nothing less.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be standing for a whole lot of anything if you would hurry up and get us into my room already,\u201d You smirk, throwing your arms over his shoulders, \u201c<i>Mister long term booty call</i>.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re getting it, <i>sweetheart</i>.\u201d He mocks, finally leaning forward and capturing your lips with his, walking the two of you back to your room and kicking the door closed with his foot.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p><i>so like this obviously has a lot of potential for a part two and was HEAVILY requested (thanks mitch) so if you\u2019d like that send me some ideas to include in a part two what do you guys want to see and also maybe get this to 1000 notes??

You put a bag of popcorn in the microwave as he shrugs off his denim jacket and tosses it on the hook in the hallway before kicking his vans off and throwing them underneath. </p><p>&ldquo;I mean you answered the question yourself,&rdquo; He says through a mouthful of chips, &ldquo;I could have that<i> if I wanted it</i>, but I don&rsquo;t, especially not with fucking Tiffany, more like <i>miss blowjob behind the Dennys</i>.&rdquo; </p><p>You swat him in the arm as he walks behind you to get to the fridge and grab a can of Fanta. He&rsquo;s laughing as he cracks it open and chugs some of it down, plucking the bag of popcorn out of your hand and pouring some into his mouth. </p><p>&ldquo;Harry! That was mine!&rdquo; You huff, rolling your eyes as you grab a soda for yourself. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s still yours!&rdquo; He chuckles, collapsing on the couch with his backpack, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just bringing it to the living room for you because I&rsquo;m just <i>that thoughtful</i>.&rdquo; </p><p>You walk around the corner to see him sat comfortably in the middle of the couch with all of the snacks piled up on the coffee table in front of him. He dumps out his backpack, adding two more bags of chips and six boxes of candy to the pile. </p><p>&ldquo;Someone had a field day at the dollar store.&rdquo; You joke, reaching around him to grab a box of Mike and Ike. </p><p>&ldquo;Spent all ten bucks on you,&rdquo; He nods, shoving a Twizzler in his mouth, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let it go to your head.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t dream of it.&rdquo; You sigh, tucking your feet up under your legs as you get comfy. </p><p>He grabs the joint from behind his ear and takes the lighter out of his pocket, igniting the end. He sucks in a drag as he slumps further against the couch, running a hand through his overgrown mess of hair. </p><p>&ldquo;So how is mister perfect?&rdquo; He muses, turning over to meet your eyes as he grabs the TV remote, &ldquo;Still perfect?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not perfect Harry, he&rsquo;s just-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A student professor at your college with medical insurance and the keys to a Tesla?&rdquo; He mocks, eyeing you over his shoulder as he starts flipping through the channels. </p><p>&ldquo;Would you shut up?&rdquo; You huff, grabbing the pillow from behind you and smacking him over the head. </p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; He scoffs, &ldquo;Am I wrong? He&rsquo;s fucking boring, Y/N.&rdquo; </p><p>You roll your eyes as he pulls off his <i>Higgs </i>hoodie, revealing his Astroworld t-shirt. He slumps back against the couch and you grab his hoodie yourself, pulling it over your head. </p><p>&ldquo;So what is it?&rdquo; He asks, breathing out another cloud of smoke, &ldquo;Why isn&rsquo;t he perfect? Other than the fact that he&rsquo;s an absolute snore fest of course.&rdquo; </p><p>You shove him over with your shoulder and steal the joint out of his hand, placing it between your lips instead, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not boring Harry, he&rsquo;s&hellip;safe.&rdquo; You sigh, taking another drag. </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Safe</i>?&rdquo; He taunts, snatching the Mike and Ike out of your hand, &ldquo;That is exactly what you call someone that&rsquo;s <i>drop-dead boring</i>.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s his favorite ice cream flavor?&rdquo; He asks instead, cutting you off. </p><p>&ldquo;Um,&rdquo; You think aloud, wishing you didn&rsquo;t have to say it, &ldquo;Vanilla?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;<i>God,</i> Y/N! Are you <i>kidding</i> me?&rdquo; He groans, throwing his head back against the couch, &ldquo;What does he teach?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Biomedical engineering-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fucking hell!&rdquo; He shouts, cutting you off once again, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s literally a piece of white bread, Y/N,&rdquo; He says, turning to face you on the couch, &ldquo;<i>God</i>, you know Wonderbread? That&rsquo;s him, he&rsquo;s a fucking piece of Wonderbread.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;He is <i>not</i> a piece of Wonderbread, Harry,&rdquo; You defend, rolling your eyes, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a <i>stable guy</i>, with a <i>stable job</i>, and-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;At least tell me the sex is good.&rdquo; He cuts in once again, shoveling popcorn into his mouth. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s uh, the sex is um, it&rsquo;s fine-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my <i>god</i>, Y/N!&rdquo; He shouts, his voice nearly startling you, &ldquo;Even the sex is boring?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I did not say that-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t have to!&rdquo; He laughs, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known you for six years, I can tell when you&rsquo;re lying,&rdquo; He smirks obnoxiously, &ldquo;God I can&rsquo;t believe even the sex is bad, what is it? You suck him off and then it&rsquo;s like five minutes of missionary or-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Harry</i>!&rdquo; You squeal, grabbing the pillow you flung at him earlier and covering your blushing face with it instead. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, come on, you&rsquo;re acting like we don&rsquo;t talk about this shit.&rdquo; He huffs, grabbing the pillow from over your face and tossing it over his shoulder. </p><p>&ldquo;<i>You</i> talk about this shit, Harry,&rdquo; You laugh lightheartedly, &ldquo;Without me asking you to, might I add.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well maybe if you were having better sex, you&rsquo;d want to talk about it.&rdquo; He shrugs, sticking his tongue out at you as he turns back to the TV. </p><p>&ldquo;Maybe if you were less promiscuous, you&rsquo;d talk about it less.&rdquo; You counter, leaning back against the couch and shoving your feet in his lap. </p><p>&ldquo;Maybe if you actually got some good sex, you&rsquo;d be less annoying.&rdquo; He teases, leaning back against the couch and folding his arms on top of your legs. </p><p>&nbsp;You wake up to the light coming in through the living room window and peel your eyes open to see Harry underneath you. He&rsquo;s passed out cold, his head in your lap and his feet hanging off the edge of the couch. He must&rsquo;ve curled up on your lap after you fell asleep during your American Horror Story binge. &nbsp;You suddenly hear a knock at the door and realize that must have been what woke you up, but who the hell is here this early in the morning? </p><p>You shove him off your lap and he grunts in protest, curling back up with one of the astray pillows as you stumble to your feet. You pass the kitchen on the way to the door and you catch the time lit up on the stove out of the corner of your eye. </p><p>One thirty? No way, it&rsquo;s not one thirty in the afternoon. <i>Sure</i>, you two didn&rsquo;t go to bed till four but it couldn&rsquo;t possibly be-</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N? Hello?&rdquo; You hear your boyfriend&rsquo;s voice ask from behind the door as he continues knocking. </p><p>&ldquo;Shit, shit, <i>shit</i>!&rdquo; You whisper to yourself, looking down to see yourself still dressed in the same sweatpants from yesterday and Harry&rsquo;s <i>Higgs</i> sweatshirt. </p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening?&rdquo; Harry groans from the couch, standing up and running a hand through his messy bedhead. </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Mister perfect</i> is outside because I was supposed to go out to lunch with him today!&rdquo; You whisper harshly, trying to figure out how to get ready and air out the very present smell of weed in your apartment in the next three seconds. </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Lunch</i>? Who the fuck makes <i>plans</i> to go to lunch-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Harry! Not right now!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well fine, why don&rsquo;t you go get dressed and I&rsquo;ll entertain the snooze fest for ten minutes.&rdquo; He suggests, walking past you to grab the door. </p><p>You cringe outwardly, your face screwing up into the worst expression as he pulls the door open and suddenly your two very separate worlds are colliding. Your boyfriend doesn&rsquo;t know you as some girl who smokes weed and inhales potato chips while bingeing TV shows with your best friend who&rsquo;s a self-proclaimed lady killer and proud retail associate at Zumiez. He knows you as Y/N, a girl he met studying at the library who enjoys critically acclaimed movies and going to brunch on Sunday. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey there mate,&rdquo; Harry grins, gesturing inside, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you just come in and chill, she&rsquo;ll be ready to go in like ten, maybe fifteen minutes, I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve had the pleasure of getting to know each other.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;And you are?&rdquo; Your boyfriend asks, raising his eyebrows as he passes Harry in the hallway. </p><p>&ldquo;Her best friend,&rdquo; Harry grins proudly, &ldquo;Harry.&rdquo; </p><p>Your boyfriend reaches out his hand to shake Harry&rsquo;s, but Harry grabs his hand and pulls him into a bro hug, clapping his back. You meet your boyfriend&rsquo;s eyes over Harry&rsquo;s shoulder, and he looks anything but pleased. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just be right out, I swear.&rdquo; You say quickly, darting to your room to get changed. </p><p>You slip on a pair of jeans and huff in annoyance as you strip out of Harry&rsquo;s stupid weed hoodie and put on a nice blouse instead. You spray yourself head to toe with perfume and brush your teeth twice to cover the smell of smoke sticking to you before shoving your feet into a pair of flats and rejoining the boys in the living room. </p><p>&ldquo;You ready to go?&rdquo; Your boyfriend asks hurriedly, standing from the couch and effectively cutting Harry off in the middle of whatever they were talking about. </p><p>&ldquo;Um, yeah,&rdquo; You stutter, grabbing your purse and turning to Harry, &ldquo;You can lock up when you leave, yeah?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yup, don&rsquo;t even worry about it,&rdquo; He nods, &ldquo;You two have fun, <i>but not too much fun</i>.&rdquo; He jokes, making your boyfriend grimace. </p><p>You fake smile, waving goodbye and nearly dragging your boyfriend out of your apartment and to his car parked outside. He&rsquo;s still looking at you incredulously as you collapse into the car beside him and he starts it up, driving to the entrance of your complex. </p><p>He finally breaks the silence when you hit the first red light, &ldquo;You never mentioned your uh-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know, he&rsquo;s um, he&rsquo;s a lot,&rdquo; You explain, trying to carefully word your next thought, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been friends for a long time.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;He seems like a nice enough guy,&rdquo; He shrugs, &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t really strike me as someone you&rsquo;d be best friends with however.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, it&rsquo;s just um, you know we&rsquo;ve been hanging out for so long he just kind of-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sticks around and hotboxes your apartment?&rdquo; He remarks, the judgement dripping from his voice. </p><p>Your stomach twists in the worst way when the words come out of his mouth. There it is, the sentence you were waiting for. The one that confirms he thinks of Harry exactly the way you thought he would. Harry is loud, and obnoxious, and stoned ninety percent of the time but he&rsquo;s your best friend in the whole world. He&rsquo;s held your hair over the toilet while you puked up vodka soda more times than you&rsquo;d like to count, and you don&rsquo;t even want to try and think of how many movie marathons you&rsquo;ve had at each other&rsquo;s houses till ungodly hours of the night. You love that son of a bitch, no matter how many girls he fucks in the backseat of his old ass Mustang or how many times he bums five bucks off you for a Whopper when he&rsquo;s got the munchies, he&rsquo;s your best friend, and maybe he&rsquo;s right about <i>mister perfect</i>. </p><p>&nbsp;You walk back in your apartment expecting to see Harry still sprawled on the couch with the remote in his hand but he&rsquo;s nowhere to be found. You trudge your feet back to your bedroom and grab his <i>Higgs </i>hoodie off the ground, stripping out of your blouse and pulling the hoodie back over your head. You dial his number as you collapse on your bed, laying upside down with your feet pressed to the wall. </p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; He asks right away, not even bothering to say hello, &ldquo;How was your lunch date?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Definitely could&rsquo;ve gone better.&rdquo; You sigh, sitting back up when you feel the blood rushing to your head. </p><p>&ldquo;What happened? Did he order unseasoned chicken and steamed cauliflower?&rdquo; He teases. </p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; You laugh, rolling your eyes, &ldquo;I uh, I broke up with him.&rdquo; </p><p>You can hear the shuffle of movement on the other side of the phone and you can picture him sitting up quickly from laying down on his back just like you are, &ldquo;No the fuck you didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yes the fuck I did.&rdquo; You chuckle, rolling over onto your stomach. </p><p>&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; He sighs, &ldquo;What finally made you put the last nail in the coffin?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Remember when you asked how the sex was?&rdquo; You grimace, covering your blushing face with your hand even though he can&rsquo;t see you. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; He says uneasily, and you can almost hear the smirk in his voice. </p><p>&ldquo;Well there wasn&rsquo;t any,&rdquo; You gulp, awaiting his reaction, &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You guys never fucked?&rdquo; He asks suddenly, cutting you off, &ldquo;Y/N, you dated that guy for six months.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Believe me, I know.&rdquo; You laugh, trying to break through the awkward air. </p><p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t had sex in six months?&rdquo; He asks again, clearly not able to wrap his head around the thought. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes Harry, say it a little louder for your neighbors, would you?&rdquo; You joke, tying your hair up in a bun on top of your head. </p><p>&ldquo;God, what a piece of fucking Wonderbread,&rdquo; He chuckles, cracking himself up with his own joke from earlier, &ldquo;Six months Y/N, that&rsquo;s like, that should be illegal.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Probably going to be a lot longer now.&rdquo; You mumble, walking to the kitchen to grab a tub of ice cream out of the freezer. </p><p>&ldquo;Longer? No way, I&rsquo;m not letting you do that to yourself,&rdquo; He laughs, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going out tonight and I&rsquo;m gonna wingman you so hard you&rsquo;ll definitely-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, no, no,&rdquo; You sigh, cutting him off, &ldquo;You know I don&rsquo;t do that shit Harry, I&rsquo;m not going to have sex with a total stranger.&rdquo; You say through a mouthful of ice cream. </p><p>&ldquo;Well, I mean, we could,&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a stranger.&rdquo; </p><p>You nearly choke on the huge bite of ice cream in your mouth when the words come out of his mouth. You almost drop the giant spoon in your hand as you set the ice cream down and press your phone to your ear to make sure you hear him properly. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, did you just fucking say-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, it makes perfect sense,&rdquo; He reasons, &ldquo;We know each other, too well probably, and I&rsquo;ve heard you complain after mediocre sex enough to know what you want.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No way! No you&rsquo;re not-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve seen me naked plenty of times and I was there when you got that ass tattoo so I&rsquo;ve basically seen you in the nude-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is <i>not</i> the same thing.&rdquo; You cut in. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s close enough!&rdquo; He laughs, &ldquo;All I&rsquo;m saying is I fucking know what I&rsquo;m doing, and I could make you feel good Y/N, something you apparently haven&rsquo;t experienced in six. Fucking. Months.&rdquo; </p><p>You close your eyes, pinching the bridge of your nose and trying to make your mind think straight. You can&rsquo;t do this, this is fucking insane right? Fucking your best friend? Fucking Harry? You can&rsquo;t have sex with Harry, he&rsquo;s fucking <i>Harry</i>! </p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; You say uneasily and fucking dammit if your subconscious didn&rsquo;t just slam her face into the wall, &ldquo;Just this once?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Just this once,&rdquo; He confirms, &ldquo;Unless of course you <i>want</i> to go for round two-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get your hopes up, Styles,&rdquo; You warn, wanting to knock yourself out before you actually agree to something this insane, &ldquo;Can you be at my place in twenty minutes?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Twenty minutes</i>?&rdquo; He scoffs, &ldquo;Y/N, there is an art to this, you think I just wake up and look this good? For the full experience I&rsquo;ve got to shower and shave and-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got half an hour until there is a strong possibility that I will change my mind.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Ugh, fine,&rdquo; He sighs, and you swear you can hear him rolling his eyes, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be there in fifteen.&rdquo; </p><p>&nbsp;As soon as you hang up the phone, your mind is whirling. Fifteen minutes. You&rsquo;ve got fifteen minutes until your best friend of six years is going to show up on your doorstep with every intention of seeing you naked. God. What have you done? </p><p>You hurry to your bathroom and brush your teeth first, gargling with mouth wash twice and checking your breath afterwards. Your hands are nearly shaking as you take your hair down from the bun on your head and you run your fingers through it, trying to sort out the tangles. Does it look better up? Will that make the act easier if your hair isn&rsquo;t like all over the place? Does leaving it down look too nice? </p><p>You shake your head in frustration and decide to leave it down as you walk back to your room and start shuffling through your dresser. What do you wear to have sex with your friend for the first time? Do you put on nice underwear or does that look like you&rsquo;re trying too hard? You definitely don&rsquo;t wear tan, seamless boyshorts, that&rsquo;s for sure. You wriggle out of your underwear and slide into a plain black thong instead. Not lace, not too fancy, and definitely not matching your bra but at least it&rsquo;s not spanx. </p><p>Do you put your jeans back on? Or just stay in his hoodie and some underwear? That&rsquo;s hot right? Are you supposed to be hot? Harry&rsquo;s not going to think you&rsquo;re hot whether you&rsquo;re dressed in nothing but a thong anyways. </p><p>There&rsquo;s a knock on the front door and you nearly jump out of your skin. God, he&rsquo;s here. You try to make a split-second decision to throw on a pair of shorts until the knocking sounds again and you realize he&rsquo;s locked out. You decide against the stupid shorts and walk back out to the living room, bracing yourself for what&rsquo;s about to happen. You could just <i>not answer the door</i>, tell him you fell asleep. It&rsquo;s happened before, he&rsquo;d believe you, wouldn&rsquo;t he? </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N! It&rsquo;s fucking cold out here!&rdquo; He calls, banging his fist against the door. </p><p>You sigh, taking in a deep breath as you walk down the hallway to the front door and slide open the lock, pulling it open. The cold air hits you like a brick wall and Harry&rsquo;s face lights up upon seeing you before he shuffles past you into the warmth of your apartment. </p><p>He&rsquo;s still rubbing his hands together as he drops his skateboard inside and slides his backpack off one shoulder when your eyes rake over him, trying to compare his appearance to yours. He&rsquo;s in a plain pair of grey basketball shorts and his favorite Thrasher hoodie with a red hat pulled backwards over his unruly hair. He&rsquo;s anything but dressed up for the occasion and that&rsquo;s perfectly fine by you, you didn&rsquo;t sign up for the full <i>Harry Styles experience</i>. </p><p>&ldquo;God it&rsquo;s warm in here,&rdquo; He groans, reaching for the thermostat to bump it down a few degrees, &ldquo;You know, if you wore pants around the house you could probably save <i>loads</i> on your electric bill.&rdquo; </p><p>You can&rsquo;t find it in yourself to come up with something equally witty to throw back at him like you usually do. He&rsquo;s still cracking up at his own joke as he strips out of his hoodie and you&rsquo;re surprised to see his torso bare underneath. That&rsquo;s fine, you&rsquo;ve seen Harry shirtless before, many times actually, but this isn&rsquo;t like those times, is it? </p><p>He turns to look at you over his shoulder as he bends down to his backpack, grabbing his pack of pre-rolled joints and lighting one between his teeth. He stands back up with the joint between his teeth and puffs a cloud of smoke in your direction to which you roll your eyes and shove him. </p><p>&ldquo;So, are we doing this?&rdquo; He asks, quirking his eyebrow up at you as he leads you the rest of the way into your apartment. </p><p>&ldquo;I um, I don&rsquo;t know, I think this was a bad idea we should just-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, no you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; He laughs, cutting you off. </p><p>You&rsquo;re caught off guard as he takes the joint out of his mouth, balancing it between his two fingers and leans into you, pressing you into the wall and smashing his lips onto yours. He shotguns a puff of smoke into your mouth and you only cough a little bit, making him laugh as you swallow roughly. Suddenly his lips are moving against yours and <i>holy fuck</i> you&rsquo;re making out with your best friend, you&rsquo;re making out with <i>Harry</i>. </p><p>His free hand reaches to grip your waist, holding you in place against the wall as his other hand rests beside your head against the drywall, still gripping the smoking joint between his fingers. His hand hikes up the side of his hoodie, grabbing your naked hip and dragging his dull fingernails over your skin while his mouth continues moving with yours. You&rsquo;ve definitely never been kissed like this before, with this much skill and rhythm and the perfect amount of tongue but <i>of course he&rsquo;s a good kisser Y/N, he&rsquo;s had more than enough practice</i> you remind yourself. </p><p>It&rsquo;s not until his lips move away from yours and instead start to trail down your neck that you&rsquo;re suddenly painfully aware that this is <i>Harry</i>. Your best friend, <i>Harry Styles</i>, is kissing down your neck and <i>fuck is he biting your throat</i> and making your fucking knees buckle. </p><p>&ldquo;Harry?&rdquo; You gasp, wishing your voice wasn&rsquo;t so strained.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; He says, stopping his assault and looking up to meet your eyes, &ldquo;What? Too much teeth? I&rsquo;ll dial it back-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; You sigh, trying to clear your head, &ldquo;Just enough teeth, I just um-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Want me to take off the hat?&rdquo; He suggests, grabbing it by the bill and tossing it behind him, &ldquo;The hair is part of the experience, baby.&rdquo; He grins cheekily. </p><p>&ldquo;No, Harry, <i>god</i>,&rdquo; You huff, rolling your eyes, &ldquo;I just um, I don&rsquo;t know if I can do this, what if this ruins our friendship? Like what if I give you a bad blowjob and you just-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Woah, woah, woah,&rdquo; He says, taking a drag, &ldquo;For one, I wouldn&rsquo;t friend dump you over a shitty blowjob and two, you&rsquo;re not going to be giving any blowies you dolt, tonight is about you and making sure you get a hefty dose of orgasm to last you through the next six months.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s saying it&rsquo;s going to have to last me another six months?&rdquo; You scoff, hitting him in the arm. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just helping you prepare for the worst,&rdquo; He laughs, blowing another cloud of smoke into your face, &ldquo;Now will you please relax and let me finish my artistic masterpiece on your neck?&rdquo; </p><p>You roll your eyes as you lean back against the wall behind you and tilt your head back, allowing him further access to the skin of your throat. He grins, those stupid dimples indenting his cheeks as he leans back down and surprises you by grabbing the back of your neck and capturing your lips with his once again. His hands reach for the hem of his hoodie on your body, dragging it up and over your head, leaving you in nothing but your bright blue bra and black thong. </p><p>&ldquo;Really pulled out all the stops, huh?&rdquo; He teases, snaking his finger under your bra strap and snapping it against your skin. </p><p>&ldquo;Says the guy in the basketball shorts.&rdquo; You smirk, reaching forward to snap the band of his shorts against his hip. </p><p>The grin on his face is every bit devious as he grabs your hips, pulling you to him and ducking his head down to press his lips to yours once again. Suddenly the friction between the two of you is undeniable and you nearly hit the ground when Harry takes your bottom lip between his teeth. </p><p>&ldquo;Bedroom?&rdquo; He pants, hardly pulling away from your lips long enough to get the single word out. </p><p>&ldquo;Mhm.&rdquo; You hum, reverberating the word right back into his mouth as your lips move together. </p><p>He walks the both of you towards your bedroom door, still swung open from your hurried dash to get the door when he arrived. He nearly trips on two pairs of your shoes, swearing under his breath as he kicks them out of the way and leads you to the bed until the backs of your calves hit the mattress. </p><p>He pushes you down against the bed and your heart is nearly hammering out of your chest for the few seconds that you&rsquo;re laying there, staring up at him and his swollen lips and blown out irises. Who is this man in front of you? This isn&rsquo;t your high school best friend that used to put carrots up his nose at lunch and help you onto the roof of his house so you guys could smoke without his parents knowing. But it is. </p><p>&ldquo;You good?&rdquo; He asks sincerely, kneeling in between your legs at the foot of the bed. </p><p>&ldquo;Yup, just fine.&rdquo; You quip, trying to steady your breathing before he&rsquo;s close enough to hear your heart beating out of your chest. </p><p>&ldquo;God Y/N, you have <i>got</i> to relax.&rdquo; He sighs, his hands running over your legs from your ankles to your thighs. </p><p>&ldquo;Sorry if this is just,&rdquo; You pant, closing your eyes briefly, &ldquo;Just a lot to wrap my head around, okay?&rdquo; </p><p>He laughs and you know he&rsquo;s making a <i>that&rsquo;s what he said</i> joke in his head as he leans back over you, pressing his lips to your collar bone and then traveling further down your chest. </p><p>&ldquo;Would it be better if you weren&rsquo;t looking at me?&rdquo; He asks, looking up to meet your eyes as he drags your underwear off you, &ldquo;Think you could relax if you couldn&rsquo;t see me?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I mean, maybe, but how-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Here, get up.&rdquo; He says simply, cutting you off and throwing your underwear over his shoulder. </p><p>You&rsquo;re caught off guard as he instructs you to stand back up and he resumes your spot on the bed, his feet hanging off the edge quite a bit more than yours were. </p><p>&ldquo;Come over here.&rdquo; He says, reaching for your hand and you nearly feel like passing out as you kneel on the edge of the bed and crawl over to him, your naked ass in the air. </p><p>&ldquo;What are you-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Put this one here,&rdquo; He instructs, grabbing your right knee and placing it right beside his head, &ldquo;And put this one right here.&rdquo; He continues, grabbing your left knee and trying to drag it over his face to rest on the other side of his head. </p><p>&ldquo;What? No! Harry!&rdquo; You stutter, swatting his hand away but he grabs your leg tighter, meeting your eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;Come on Y/N, just ride my face, then you won&rsquo;t be looking at me while I-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do <i>not</i> finish that sentence.&rdquo; You warn, your chest heaving as you wrap your arms around yourself to try to cover up at least a little. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N,&rdquo; He says softly, his hand reaching out to grab your hip, &ldquo;Do you trust me?&rdquo; </p><p>You look up from the comforter beneath your knees to meet his stern eyes. There&rsquo;s not an ounce of teasing in his voice, no digs or cracking jokes, he&rsquo;s sincere and you&rsquo;re not sure you&rsquo;ve ever seen him look this serious. </p><p>&ldquo;If at any point you want me to stop, you just say the word and we&rsquo;ll be done, we can put on a movie and act like this never happened, <i>I swear</i>,&rdquo; He says, squeezing your hip for emphasis, &ldquo;But for now, can you just give me a <i>chance</i>?&rdquo; </p><p>You sigh, sitting back on your heels and staring at the ceiling fan whirring above you. This is insane. Sit on his face? Ride his face? He wants you to put <i>that</i> on his <i>mouth</i>, what if you fucking suffocate him? </p><p>&ldquo;How do I do this again?&rdquo; You sigh, looking back down to meet his eyes. </p><p>He grins, grabbing your left knee once again and passing it over his face, placing it on the other side of his head. You cringe, preparing yourself to look down and see none other than fucking Harry&rsquo;s face between your thighs. </p><p>&ldquo;You good?&rdquo; He asks again and the warmth of his breath directly on your core makes your thighs clench. </p><p>&ldquo;Just great,&rdquo; You grimace, &ldquo;Are you going to uh, get started down there, or?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to sit down first love,&rdquo; He laughs, his hands reaching around to grab your hips, &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t really reach you from way up there.&rdquo; </p><p>Love. That&rsquo;s new. Harry has definitely never called you love. You can&rsquo;t tell if he&rsquo;s saying it to comfort you because at this point, he can probably feel your heartbeat thumping in every cell of your body, many of which happen to be sitting on him at the current moment. You let out yet another sigh, bracing yourself as you lean off your knees, and onto the backs of your feet instead. </p><p>&ldquo;Like this?&rdquo; You ask cautiously, trying to keep yourself balanced on your heels so you don&rsquo;t crush him. </p><p>&ldquo;Just like that,&rdquo; He says, nodding his head and his nose brushes your clit, making you jump, &ldquo;Shit, sorry.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Careful, Styles.&rdquo; You breathe, your legs already shaking. </p><p>You look down and meet his eyes, your cheeks instantly going aflame as he smirks at you with that stupid dimpled smile. His hair is splayed out beneath him, his eyes hooded as his hands move from your hips to your thighs, holding you in place as he licks one bold stripe up the center of your heat. </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Christ</i>.&rdquo; You sigh, your eyes falling closed as you suck in a sharp breath. </p><p>You hear him chuckle beneath you as he continues his assault, his hands locked around your jittering thighs as he licks up and down you, swirling his tongue in all the right ways. He sucks your bud into his mouth, pressing sloppy kisses to your core as he catches his breath before delving back into your heat. </p><p>&ldquo;H-Higher.&rdquo; You pant, leaning back on your hands that are firmly pressed to his chest behind you. </p><p>&ldquo;Here?&rdquo; He asks, licking a few stripes at just the perfect spot. </p><p>&ldquo;Fuck, yes, right there,&rdquo; You breathe heavily, moving one of your hands from his chest to thread through his hair, &ldquo;Back and forth, horizontal.&rdquo; You pant, hoping he understands what you mean. </p><p>His tongue starts flicking back and forth across the perfect spot and you nearly lose your balance and fall forward at the surge of pleasure in the pit of your stomach. His arms reach up and grab your hips, holding you upright as you shudder, your eyes screwed shut. He continues the movement, darting back and forth between it and the sloppy kisses he resorts to in order to catch his breath as he reaches up your back to the clasp of your bra. He snaps it open with a quick flick of his skilled fingers and tosses it to the side, your full chest finally on display. </p><p>&ldquo;Did you just manage to get my bra off in the middle of all this?&rdquo; You gasp, your eyes fluttering open to meet his, still trained on you. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all in the wrist.&rdquo; He teases, purposefully nudging you with his nose this time. </p><p>You roll your eyes, reaching down to cover his face, wishing he would stop staring at you with that dimpled smirk on his face while his fucking mouth does <i>ungodly</i> things to your clit. </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the spirit,&rdquo; He smirks, &ldquo;This is <i>much</i> hotter.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;God, would you please shut up and put your mouth to better use?&rdquo; You groan, uncovering his eyes once again. </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t have to tell me twice.&rdquo; He jokes, returning his tongue to where you need him most, your knees buckling almost instantly. </p><p>It&rsquo;s only a couple seconds of that flicking movement that has you shuddering above him. He reaches up to tease your nipples, making you gasp and have to lean back on his chest once again. He&rsquo;s smirking proudly as you come undone above him, your thighs threatening to clench together and absolutely squish his head, but he couldn&rsquo;t care less. Your lip is nearly purple you&rsquo;re biting down on it so hard and Harry notices. You&rsquo;re keeping your moans contained but he won&rsquo;t be having any of that, you better tell him how good he&rsquo;s making you feel. </p><p>He leans you back to sit on his chest rather than kneeling over his face as you ride out your orgasm and you&rsquo;re just about to ask him what the hell he&rsquo;s doing when he pushes a finger into you. You nearly jump out of your skin at the overstimulation and your hands plant themselves firmly on the mattress on either side of his hips. </p><p>&ldquo;Feel good?&rdquo; He asks, trying to drag it out of you as he adds another finger, pumping into you relentlessly, and you involuntarily whimper. </p><p>&ldquo;Mhm.&rdquo; You nod, biting your lip once again as his fingers curl inside you and your back arches, nearly tipping you over the edge for a second time already. </p><p>&ldquo;For fuck&rsquo;s sake, let me hear you, Y/N.&rdquo; He grunts, adding his thumb to rub against your clit as his two fingers continue curling inside of you. </p><p>&ldquo;God, Harry, fuck,&rdquo; You sputter, trying to get the words out, &ldquo;Fuck me.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You want me to stop?&rdquo; He asks, clearly not following, &ldquo;Want me to fuck you instead?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No, asshat,&rdquo; You pant, &ldquo;Fingers, fuck me, don&rsquo;t just curl them, in and out, you follow?&rdquo; </p><p>He&rsquo;s laughing as he nods, flipping his hair out of his face as he starts to pump his fingers in and out of you once again. You throw your head back in ecstasy, still balancing on your hands and gripping the duvet in your fists. </p><p>&ldquo;Better?&rdquo; He asks. </p><p>&ldquo;Much.&rdquo; You breathe. </p><p>You move one hand from the mattress to grab him over his basketball shorts and he hisses through his teeth, his head suddenly falling back against the mattress. </p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; He grunts, pulling himself back up to meet your eyes, &ldquo;This is about you-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; You nod, cutting him off. </p><p>He&rsquo;s staring at you wide eyed as you palm him through his shorts, not that he needs any help, he&rsquo;s already standing at stark attention against the waistband of his shorts. </p><p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t mean you can stop though, Styles.&rdquo; You smirk and he lets out a chuckle as he resumes. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo; He teases, rubbing his thumb back and forth against your clit perfectly. </p><p>The repeated movement is just enough to push you over the edge with the added stimulation of his fingers pumping in and out of you. You nearly collapse backwards but his arms reach out and wrap around your waist, holding you to his chest. </p><p>&ldquo;I got you.&rdquo; He laughs, and you fall forward instead, collapsing against his chest as he falls back against the bed. </p><p>You feel numb all over in the best way. You can hear your heartbeat in your ears, your entire head, your chest, your arms, your entire body is beating in time with the incessant thumping. You can&rsquo;t remember the last time you felt this light, you&rsquo;re floating, or maybe you&rsquo;re lightheaded. Suddenly the room is a thousand degrees and you feel steaming hot to the touch. </p><p>&ldquo;You okay?&rdquo; He asks, brushing your hair behind your ear, &ldquo;I can hear your heart beating.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Just got to,&rdquo; You pant, swallowing hard, &ldquo;Gotta catch my breath.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Makes sense,&rdquo; He smirks, his arms snaking around your waist, &ldquo;I have been told my services are rather <i>breathtaking</i>.&rdquo; </p><p>You sit up, grabbing the closest pillow and stuff it over his face to which he flails beneath you, reaching around you to smack your bare ass. You nearly jump out of your skin, ripping the pillow from over his face to see him laughing hysterically, his hair an absolutely fucked out mess. </p><p>&ldquo;Did you just-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are not about to get offended that I smacked your ass,&rdquo; He scoffs, grabbing your face and pulling your mouth to his with those stupid dimples popping from his cheeks, &ldquo;That ass was smothering my face not even twenty minutes ago, love.&rdquo; </p><p>&nbsp;***</p><p>You&rsquo;re spinning in your desk chair, quite obviously avoiding the Economics homework pulled up on your computer when your phone buzzes on your desk beside you. You pick it up expectantly, but the name Noah flashes across the screen rather than the name you&rsquo;ve been waiting for all day. </p><p>You lean back in your chair, staring up at the ceiling and sighing before muttering a quick, &ldquo;Fuck it,&rdquo; and picking up your phone once again. </p><p>You dial the number easily, it&rsquo;s number one on your favorites list after all and he picks up by the second ring, &ldquo;This another booty call?&rdquo; He teases and you hope to god that he&rsquo;s alone if he&rsquo;s talking like that. </p><p>&ldquo;I told you you&rsquo;re not allowed to answer the phone like that.&rdquo; You huff, getting up from your desk and wandering out to the kitchen to grab a snack. </p><p>&ldquo;You also said I was absolutely never allowed to fuck your face but what did we do the other-&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Harry shut the fuck up!&rdquo; You squeak, your cheeks suddenly flaming. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just proving my point, love.&rdquo; He laughs, sniffling slightly and you can tell he&rsquo;s outside. </p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing right now?&rdquo; You ask uneasily, biting your lip. </p><p>&ldquo;Skateboarding.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;To where?&rdquo; You question further, hoping he doesn&rsquo;t call you on the carpet for asking so many. </p><p>&ldquo;Wait for it,&rdquo; He chuckles, his breath puffing out quicker as he picks up speed. </p><p>&ldquo;Wait for wha-&ldquo;</p><p>Suddenly you&rsquo;re cut off as there&rsquo;s a knock on the door and then he&rsquo;s walking through it, his cheeks rosy and his hair a wind-whipped mess. </p><p>&ldquo;You rang?&rdquo; He laughs, dropping his skateboard. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>thank god</i>, the friend with benefits I ordered.&rdquo; You fawn dramatically, batting your eyelashes as you cross the space between the two of you. </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Hey</i>,&rdquo; He snaps, grabbing you by the backs of your thighs and hoisting you into his arms, &ldquo;I am a self-proclaimed long-term booty call and I will stand for nothing less.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t be standing for a whole lot of anything if you would hurry up and get us into my room already,&rdquo; You smirk, throwing your arms over his shoulders, &ldquo;<i>Mister long term booty call</i>.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re getting it, <i>sweetheart</i>.&rdquo; He mocks, finally leaning forward and capturing your lips with his, walking the two of you back to your room and kicking the door closed with his foot.&nbsp;</p><p>***</p><p><i>so like this obviously has a lot of potential for a part two and was HEAVILY requested (thanks mitch) so if you&rsquo;d like that send me some ideas to include in a part two what do you guys want to see and also maybe get this to 1000 notes?? That&rsquo;d be sick</i></p><p><i>love u guys</i></p><p><i>pls appreciate my sacrifice I was supposed to go to bed ages ago I work in 4 hours&nbsp;</i></p></p>",
