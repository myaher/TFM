The world will never know. So instead, I\u2019m just going to put a few thoughts on what I would love to see on Taylor\u2019s next album.</p><p>1. More female influence. As much as I think most of the songs Taylor has done with Jack,\u00a0Martin and Shellback are bops, and as much as I understand the logic of\u00a0\u2018why fix what <pwa data-pwa-id=\"pwa-E28D8FAF3CE193D327ED63D41C917EE4\" data-pwa-rule-id=\"null\" data-pwa-category=\"style\" data-pwa-hint=\"Passive verbs make your writing less direct.

A\u00a0\u201crelapse\u201d song of sorts. I don\u2019t want to take away from the fact it appears Taylor is at peace with her life right now\u00a0because I truly believe she is. But to be honest, I would really love a song based on a moment like the woods <pwa data-pwa-id=\"pwa-DEE418A660B42D066533EB07055063C2\" data-pwa-rule-id=\"CRFSR_ON_6\" data-pwa-category=\"grammar\" data-pwa-hint=\"Possible confused word\" data-pwa-suggestions=\"on\" data-pwa-dictionary-word=\"one\" class=\"pwa-mark pwa-mark-done\">one</pwa> the other day or when news outlets <pwa data-pwa-id=\"pwa-9C2BB4CD3BBB0A5C1D17451B6D009046\" data-pwa-rule-id=\"READABILITY_567\" data-pwa-category=\"style\" data-pwa-hint=\"Readability may be enhanced by using: said\" data-pwa-suggestions=\"said\" data-pwa-dictionary-word=\"were saying\" class=\"pwa-mark pwa-mark-done\">were saying</pwa> that the Reputation tour <pwa data-pwa-id=\"pwa-F088A851AAC46699D4D4C38CA36D8667\" data-pwa-rule-id=\"READABILITY_1482\" data-pwa-category=\"style\" data-pwa-hint=\"Readability may be enhanced by using: would\" data-pwa-suggestions=\"would\" data-pwa-dictionary-word=\"was going to\" class=\"pwa-mark pwa-mark-done\">was going to</pwa> be a flop where, even for just a moment, she doubted the choices she made or had a \u2018here we go again\u2019 moment. <pwa data-pwa-id=\"pwa-5EFFC1BF1240BC71EE92EFEBFE5C2B10\" data-pwa-rule-id=\"INTRO_058F2F538C3A71F69C8C6D8041D11C43\" data-pwa-category=\"grammar\" data-pwa-hint=\"Missing comma after introductory phrase\" data-pwa-suggestions=\"Basically,\" data-pwa-dictionary-word=\"Basically\" class=\"pwa-mark pwa-mark-done\">Basically</pwa> I <pwa data-pwa-id=\"pwa-DFBA218133CAFD12F9FDB7B051493C32\" data-pwa-rule-id=\"READABILITY_2770\" data-pwa-category=\"style\" data-pwa-hint=\"Remove for more succinct, powerful writing.\" data-pwa-suggestions=\"(omit)\" data-pwa-dictionary-word=\"just \" class=\"pwa-mark pwa-mark-done\">just\u00a0</pwa>want a song showing that the road to happiness isn\u2019t just a straight line. I also wouldn\u2019t mind if this song was like Call It What You Want where she realises that the love she has around her helps calm her nervous tendencies.</p><p>3. Positive and\u00a0\u201cnegative\u201d friendship songs. I don\u2019t want the whole <pwa data-pwa-id=\"pwa-0A332EF307E78AFBF0F19553F3427A4F\" data-pwa-rule-id=\"SIMPLE_SPELLING\" data-pwa-category=\"spelling\" data-pwa-hint=\"Unknown word: Kimye\" data-pwa-suggestions=\"Kimbe~KIMY~Kimle~Kime~Kimya~Kimee~Kimie~Kim ye~Jymmye\" data-pwa-dictionary-word=\"Kimye\" class=\"pwa-mark pwa-mark-done\">Kimye</pwa> thing and how her\u00a0\u201cfriends\u201d turned on her rehashed, but it would be good to hear about how large changes in her life such as stepping out of the spotlight shaped her friendships. Like what challenges did it bring that she suddenly couldn\u2019t see her famous friends as easily <pwa data-pwa-id=\"pwa-F6E65735A759CBAD1AB42070D238E63D\" data-pwa-rule-id=\"READABILITY_3_1768\" data-pwa-category=\"style\" data-pwa-hint=\"Readability may be enhanced by using: because of, for\" data-pwa-suggestions=\"because of~for\" data-pwa-dictionary-word=\"due to\" class=\"pwa-mark pwa-mark-done\">due to</pwa> the paparazzi?

And alternatively, how incredible was it making friends with people like Joe\u2019s brother <strike>(I mention him specifically because his name was on the LWYMMD <pwa data-pwa-id=\"pwa-BEE223F25B6A3F75023E8B764A90A4E7\" data-pwa-rule-id=\"HYPHEN_FOREIGN\" data-pwa-category=\"grammar\" data-pwa-hint=\"You may have written this incorrectly\" data-pwa-suggestions=\"t-shirt\" data-pwa-dictionary-word=\"tshirt\" class=\"pwa-mark pwa-mark-done\">tshirt</pwa>)</strike> and knowing you could trust them not to reveal her location and other secrets? What was it <pwa data-pwa-id=\"pwa-A6EAEC7294F6F94BE3B4D83267FC7BE3\" data-pwa-rule-id=\"READABILITY_2847\" data-pwa-category=\"style\" data-pwa-hint=\"You might want to use a stronger verb\" data-pwa-suggestions=\"enjoy\" data-pwa-dictionary-word=\"like\" class=\"pwa-mark pwa-mark-done\">like</pwa>\u00a0making the same <pwa data-pwa-id=\"pwa-FCBF12228D50EB9032C8828BFDABF341\" data-pwa-rule-id=\"READABILITY_1942\" data-pwa-category=\"style\" data-pwa-hint=\"Readability may be enhanced by removing this\" data-pwa-suggestions=\"(omit)\" data-pwa-dictionary-word=\"type of \" class=\"pwa-mark pwa-mark-done\">type of\u00a0</pwa>friendships the everyday person has (<strike>not saying her famous ones aren\u2019t genuine, but they\u2019d come with different challenges than typical ones)</strike> for the first time in a long time? Like I don\u2019t know, as much as 1989 wasn\u2019t my favourite album or era, the one thing I <pwa data-pwa-id=\"pwa-82D0E2C0A90BA0842EF5870939646776\" data-pwa-rule-id=\"READABILITY_626\" data-pwa-category=\"style\" data-pwa-hint=\"Readability may be enhanced by using: loved\" data-pwa-suggestions=\"loved\" data-pwa-dictionary-word=\"did love\" class=\"pwa-mark pwa-mark-done\">did love</pwa> was the focus on friendship and I\u2019d like to see that come back.</p><p>4. More theatre/movie soundtrack sounds. With Taylor doing Cats and how borderline theatre/movie soundtrack like Don\u2019t Blame Me and the tour version of I Did Something Bad were, she has really shown that <pwa data-pwa-id=\"pwa-2FA59C1435784E8F8C85D37A9E2826F0\" data-pwa-rule-id=\"THIS_NNS\" data-pwa-category=\"grammar\" data-pwa-hint=\"Possible confused word\" data-pwa-suggestions=\"this kind~these kinds\" data-pwa-dictionary-word=\"these kind\" class=\"pwa-mark pwa-mark-done\">these kind</pwa> of elements can work for her and I really hope <pwa data-pwa-id=\"pwa-70D29B294B34C2F51CF34E154F3B9BA0\" data-pwa-rule-id=\"IT_IS\" data-pwa-category=\"grammar\" data-pwa-hint=\"Possible confused word\" data-pwa-suggestions=\"its\" data-pwa-dictionary-word=\"it\u2019s\" class=\"pwa-mark pwa-mark-done\">it\u2019s</pwa> something she incorporates more.</p><p>5. Songs about self love and reflection. <pwa data-pwa-id=\"pwa-43EF7493E80C16C7008DC0476F9F3604\" data-pwa-rule-id=\"null\" data-pwa-category=\"style\" data-pwa-hint=\"Passive verbs make your writing less direct.

                "content": "<p>I typically hate making theory posts because lets face it, the last time I made one was before 1989 came out and I basically&nbsp;predicted it would be Reputation&hellip;. so was I ahead of my time or just completely off the ball? The world will never know. So instead, I&rsquo;m just going to put a few thoughts on what I would love to see on Taylor&rsquo;s next album.</p><p>1. More female influence. As much as I think most of the songs Taylor has done with Jack,&nbsp;Martin and Shellback are bops, and as much as I understand the logic of&nbsp;&lsquo;why fix what isn&rsquo;t broken?&rsquo;, I truly do&nbsp;hope that a larger percentage of this album has female collaborations, whether they be writing, producing or singing wise. Specifically, now that&nbsp;they&rsquo;re on the same label, it would be incredible to have a song cowritten or cosung by Lorde or Florence.</p><p>2. A&nbsp;&ldquo;relapse&rdquo; song of sorts. I don&rsquo;t want to take away from the fact it appears Taylor is at peace with her life right now&nbsp;because I truly believe she is. But to be honest, I would really love a song based on a moment like the woods one the other day or when news outlets were saying that the Reputation tour was going to be a flop where, even for just a moment, she doubted the choices she made or had a &lsquo;here we go again&rsquo; moment. Basically I just&nbsp;want a song showing that the road to happiness isn&rsquo;t just a straight line. I also wouldn&rsquo;t mind if this song was like Call It What You Want where she realises that the love she has around her helps calm her nervous tendencies.</p><p>3. Positive and&nbsp;&ldquo;negative&rdquo; friendship songs. I don&rsquo;t want the whole Kimye thing and how her&nbsp;&ldquo;friends&rdquo; turned on her rehashed, but it would be good to hear about how large changes in her life such as stepping out of the spotlight shaped her friendships. Like what challenges did it bring that she suddenly couldn&rsquo;t see her famous friends as easily due to the paparazzi? Did not being able to attend events with them put strain on their friendship? And alternatively, how incredible was it making friends with people like Joe&rsquo;s brother <strike>(I mention him specifically because his name was on the LWYMMD tshirt)</strike> and knowing you could trust them not to reveal her location and other secrets? What was it like&nbsp;making the same type of&nbsp;friendships the everyday person has (<strike>not saying her famous ones aren&rsquo;t genuine, but they&rsquo;d come with different challenges than typical ones)</strike> for the first time in a long time? Like I don&rsquo;t know, as much as 1989 wasn&rsquo;t my favourite album or era, the one thing I did love was the focus on friendship and I&rsquo;d like to see that come back.</p><p>4. More theatre/movie soundtrack sounds. With Taylor doing Cats and how borderline theatre/movie soundtrack like Don&rsquo;t Blame Me and the tour version of I Did Something Bad were, she has really shown that these kind of elements can work for her and I really hope it&rsquo;s something she incorporates more.</p><p>5. Songs about self love and reflection. This one is almost guaranteed to happen in my opinion&nbsp;given both where she ended the Reputation album and the Elle piece she&rsquo;s teased at coming out later today. Regardless, I still wanted to say it because in my opinion,&nbsp;Taylor&rsquo;s songs about self reflection, or even love songs that can be taken that way <strike>(This Love, Clean etc)</strike> are some of, if not, her best.</p>",

We had two ASL artists performing throughout the entire concert and I thought it was so cool. They were pretty incredible. Like, not ONCE did they waver in enthusiasm, expressiveness, or energy. These ladies were poignant and they PERFORMED. Each and every song throughout the entire 4+ hour show (opening acts included!). I can&rsquo;t imagine how exhausting that would be!</h2><h2>If you happen to be someone blessed with the ability to hear music (such as myself) it&rsquo;s natural to initially see this woman and just kind of think to ourselves &ldquo;oh that&rsquo;s nice&rdquo;, and quickly move on. We acknowledge her, sure. However, ultimately it becomes a trivial detail that&rsquo;s relatively easy to overlook if you&rsquo;re not impacted by a physical disability.</h2><h1><span class=\"npf_color_rachel\"><b>As humans, we have a tendency to avoid what we do not understand.</b></span></h1><h2>Not because we&rsquo;re heartless assholes, but because it&rsquo;s not easy or natural to discern or elicit empathy for stuff we don&rsquo;t &ldquo;get&rdquo;.                       </h2><h2>I&rsquo;m guilty of this myself. But I&rsquo;ve also found that by taking a moment to pause and <b><i>empathize</i></b> <b><i>without</i></b><i> <b>sympathizing</b> </i>(NOT the same thing!) is incredibly helpful and makes all the difference.  These professional ASL linguists were able to give those who are hard of hearing such a BEAUTIFUL GIFT in helping them experience Taylor live in concert, and to deeply connect with her music and emotions. In addition, the attention to detail with the inclusion of the ASL program in turn provides extra comfort in relieving any feelings of exclusion, apprehension, or fear of ostracization a Swiftie may feel as a result of their disability (which in my opinion, is much more important). It&rsquo;s the best part,  because it essentially sends the message of:                                                           </h2><h2><i><span class=\"npf_color_rachel\">&ldquo;hey, we see you. we care about you! we want you to be comfortable and we REALLY want to make sure you have the time of your life and enjoy the show just like everyone else!</span></i><span class=\"npf_color_rachel\">&rdquo;</span>.                                 I&rsquo;d imagine that the impact that this extra compassionate effort goes far beyond basic \"standard accommodations&rdquo; or &ldquo;basic convenience&rdquo; in the eyes of a disabled Swiftie. It likely transcends into something most of us cannot even begin to imagine or comprehend in regards to the significantly more positive difference it makes in the Swiftie&rsquo;s concert experience from beginning to end.</h2><h2>Alright.
