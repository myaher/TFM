        "body": "<h1>School Days (Modern School AU), Game of Thrones, Chapter 1</h1><p>So, guys.. before this starts, I want to say that I am not a native english speaker, so I can only try my best at translating my Fanfiction. I still don&rsquo;t think I understood the school system, but here we go. Also, I played with the relations and the age of the characters(Like; I made Loras and Margaery twins). Also I made Melisandre a teacher, lol don&rsquo;t kill me-</p><p>I also changed some characters like Viserys because I needed to alflwlflwlflwlfpfl</p><p>Still, have fun.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>Robb sat down while he was looking at Jon. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re serious?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes! We&rsquo;ll get a new classmate today.&rdquo;</p><p>Robb sighed. It was always a thing with new classmates. He only knew it from the parallel class, where Renly Baratheon came as a new student into the class last year. </p><p>Exactly that Renly was sitting by the Tyrell-Twins in that moment. </p><p>It was the last year for him before he would make his exams.</p><p>He looked to the right side where the place was still free and instantly hoped that the new one will be kind, because he most likely will sit next to him.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe he moved,&rdquo; Jon said and sat down on the chair on Robbs left (it was his place, anyway), so he didn&rsquo;t have to stand any longer. </p><p>&ldquo;He?&rdquo; Robb repeated and grinned at Jon.</p><p>&ldquo;What if it&rsquo;s a girl?&rdquo; </p><p>Jon rolled his eyes and shaked his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, sure. You need to mock me again,&rdquo; he answered and smiled slightly. </p><p>The Stark took a moment and looked around in the class. This was the first day after their holidays, but many things didn&rsquo;t change. Margaery had, beneath her tattoo (a dark rose) on her left wrist, a piercing at her ear and on her lip, and a sidecut.</p><p>She had dyed platinum blond hair, too, but Margaery herself didn&rsquo;t change a little bit. While all the others stood together, greeted each other, Margaery sat there, half into the chair, her legs chrossed.</p><p>She was only fifteen, but her parents allowed all of that. </p><p>Loras, her twin, sat next to her.</p><p>And again, Robb wondered how they could be so different from each other. Loras had almost adorable, normal blond locks, and he didn&rsquo;t seem like a rebel at all. He was the complete opposite of Margaery.</p><p>Margaery was a real rebel, and with every year of school, it got worse. She also outet herself as bisexual without any hesitate, and shortly after that, she outet her brother as gay. And everyone, who made any rumours about that, did never say them in public. Margaery also punched people, and sometimes, she was pretty scary. </p><p>Robb did that punching thing for Sansa once, when Joffrey made her look like a bitch, even if she was only thirteen at that time. This made Robb so angry, that he just punched that boy in the face. The most ridiculous about that thing was, that almost everyone believed the rumours about Sansa, although they knew what Joffrey was like. </p><p>It was the first time Robb and Jon came with both sister to the school. Arya had made herself independent very soon, but they always go with her until she&rsquo;s at her class, so no one came too close to her on the way.</p><p>Robb sat up straight and fixed his uniform again. He saw again that Renly was talking with Margaery, but why was he even here? He should be in the room next to them. And what the heck was Loras doing? It seems like he was writing something. </p><p>Why was Robb even wondering about that? </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Robb!&rdquo; Jon said loudly, but the Stark only realized this, because he was waving before his face. </p><p>&ldquo;Did you listen to me?&rdquo; he asked indignantly and Robb cheeky shook his head before he started laughing.</p><p>&ldquo;Except Margaery and Daenerys no one actually changed over the holidays. Well, it&rsquo;s only Margaery, Danys hair is only longer and she did it different,&rdquo; Jon muttered into his ear, but Robb only smirked about that.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks for this enrichment,&rdquo; he added and the other moved away from him again.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you take a look at the newsboard? They didn&rsquo;t let that on what was there over the holidays, I&rsquo;m sure. They can fill three newsboards in a few minutes if they want.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon shrugged. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t there,&rdquo; he added and looked at Robb, who obviously was thinking again.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you still uncomfortable because the rumours about Sansa? They aren&rsquo;t on the board anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>Robb flinched and leaned back a bit.</p><p>&ldquo;You think that because you weren&rsquo;t on it yet. You get faster on it than you think, especially when you already were once.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon started to reflect that and leaned back, exactly like Robb a few moments before. </p><p>While he was thinking without saying anything, he watched how Daenerys talked with another girl from their class, called Victoria. They seemed to be pretty amused and made each other laugh. Robb already spoke with Victoria too, he could say that she was a funny and nice girl and he liked her. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in love with Dany?&rdquo; Robb asked his neighbour with a cunning voice.</p><p>Everyone in the class called her Dany for a long while, what she offered, so all of them accepted. Actually, Robb really was sure that he got one of the better and kinder classes. They could be big assholes sometimes, but there were worse people, he knew that very well. All of his siblings went to school, and there always were some new stories.</p><p>&ldquo;No, why would you think that?&rdquo; Jon asked and laughed when Robb started to look thoughtful again. &ldquo;You became silent compared to the earlier years. Stop thinking so long when I say something, it&rsquo;s weird,&rdquo; he added then and tapped the youngster next to him amused.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, you stare at Dany. Or after her.&rdquo;</p><p>After this, a bit spontaneous, answer, Jon rolled his eyes again, as the school bell rings suddenly. &ldquo;Finally,&rdquo; Robb said and quickly took out his things for the lesson.</p><p>Meanwhile, Renly was gone, most likely to his class, when it was shortly before ringing. Robb sat up normal again and they waited for their teacher, Miss Asshai. It took longer on this day, but suddenly, they heard voices through the open door. It was quiet enough to hear that, and Robb recognizes a foreign voice.</p><p><i>Wait a moment. Why are they even that quiet?</i></p><p>When Robb looked around, he saw, that even Margaery sat quietly on her chair, though her legs were chrossed and her right foot whipped in the air, but she still was more quiet than she was in all those years he knew her.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; Robb heard someone saying, and he knew, that the person who said that, was a woman.

I still don\u2019t think I understood the school system, but here we go. Also, I played with the relations and the age of the characters(Like; I made Loras and Margaery twins). Also I made Melisandre a teacher, lol don\u2019t kill me-</p><p>I also changed some characters like Viserys because I needed to alflwlflwlflwlfpfl</p><p>Still, have fun.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>Robb sat down while he was looking at Jon. \u201cYou\u2019re serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! We\u2019ll get a new classmate today.\u201d</p><p>Robb sighed. It was always a thing with new classmates. He only knew it from the parallel class, where Renly Baratheon came as a new student into the class last year. </p><p>Exactly that Renly was sitting by the Tyrell-Twins in that moment. </p><p>It was the last year for him before he would make his exams.</p><p>He looked to the right side where the place was still free and instantly hoped that the new one will be kind, because he most likely will sit next to him.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he moved,\u201d Jon said and sat down on the chair on Robbs left (it was his place, anyway), so he didn\u2019t have to stand any longer. </p><p>\u201cHe?\u201d Robb repeated and grinned at Jon.</p><p>\u201cWhat if it\u2019s a girl?\u201d </p><p>Jon rolled his eyes and shaked his head.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure. You need to mock me again,\u201d he answered and smiled slightly. </p><p>The Stark took a moment and looked around in the class. This was the first day after their holidays, but many things didn\u2019t change. Margaery had, beneath her tattoo (a dark rose) on her left wrist, a piercing at her ear and on her lip, and a sidecut.</p><p>She had dyed platinum blond hair, too, but Margaery herself didn\u2019t change a little bit. While all the others stood together, greeted each other, Margaery sat there, half into the chair, her legs chrossed.</p><p>She was only fifteen, but her parents allowed all of that. </p><p>Loras, her twin, sat next to her.</p><p>And again, Robb wondered how they could be so different from each other. Loras had almost adorable, normal blond locks, and he didn\u2019t seem like a rebel at all. He was the complete opposite of Margaery.</p><p>Margaery was a real rebel, and with every year of school, it got worse. She also outet herself as bisexual without any hesitate, and shortly after that, she outet her brother as gay. And everyone, who made any rumours about that, did never say them in public. Margaery also punched people, and sometimes, she was pretty scary. </p><p>Robb did that punching thing for Sansa once, when Joffrey made her look like a bitch, even if she was only thirteen at that time. This made Robb so angry, that he just punched that boy in the face. The most ridiculous about that thing was, that almost everyone believed the rumours about Sansa, although they knew what Joffrey was like. </p><p>It was the first time Robb and Jon came with both sister to the school. Arya had made herself independent very soon, but they always go with her until she\u2019s at her class, so no one came too close to her on the way.</p><p>Robb sat up straight and fixed his uniform again. He saw again that Renly was talking with Margaery, but why was he even here? He should be in the room next to them. And what the heck was Loras doing? It seems like he was writing something. </p><p>Why was Robb even wondering about that? </p><p>\u201cHey, Robb!\u201d Jon said loudly, but the Stark only realized this, because he was waving before his face. </p><p>\u201cDid you listen to me?\u201d he asked indignantly and Robb cheeky shook his head before he started laughing.</p><p>\u201cExcept Margaery and Daenerys no one actually changed over the holidays. Well, it\u2019s only Margaery, Danys hair is only longer and she did it different,\u201d Jon muttered into his ear, but Robb only smirked about that.</p><p>\u201cThanks for this enrichment,\u201d he added and the other moved away from him again.</p><p>\u201cDid you take a look at the newsboard? They didn\u2019t let that on what was there over the holidays, I\u2019m sure. They can fill three newsboards in a few minutes if they want.\u201d</p><p>Jon shrugged. \u201cI wasn\u2019t there,\u201d he added and looked at Robb, who obviously was thinking again.</p><p>\u201cAre you still uncomfortable because the rumours about Sansa? They aren\u2019t on the board anymore.\u201d</p><p>Robb flinched and leaned back a bit.</p><p>\u201cYou think that because you weren\u2019t on it yet. You get faster on it than you think, especially when you already were once.\u201d</p><p>Jon started to reflect that and leaned back, exactly like Robb a few moments before. </p><p>While he was thinking without saying anything, he watched how Daenerys talked with another girl from their class, called Victoria. They seemed to be pretty amused and made each other laugh. Robb already spoke with Victoria too, he could say that she was a funny and nice girl and he liked her. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in love with Dany?\u201d Robb asked his neighbour with a cunning voice.</p><p>Everyone in the class called her Dany for a long while, what she offered, so all of them accepted. Actually, Robb really was sure that he got one of the better and kinder classes. They could be big assholes sometimes, but there were worse people, he knew that very well. All of his siblings went to school, and there always were some new stories.</p><p>\u201cNo, why would you think that?\u201d Jon asked and laughed when Robb started to look thoughtful again. \u201cYou became silent compared to the earlier years. Stop thinking so long when I say something, it\u2019s weird,\u201d he added then and tapped the youngster next to him amused.</p><p>\u201cWell, you stare at Dany. Or after her.\u201d</p><p>After this, a bit spontaneous, answer, Jon rolled his eyes again, as the school bell rings suddenly. \u201cFinally,\u201d Robb said and quickly took out his things for the lesson.</p><p>Meanwhile, Renly was gone, most likely to his class, when it was shortly before ringing. Robb sat up normal again and they waited for their teacher, Miss Asshai. It took longer on this day, but suddenly, they heard voices through the open door. It was quiet enough to hear that, and Robb recognizes a foreign voice.</p><p><i>Wait a moment. Why are they even that quiet?</i></p><p>When Robb looked around, he saw, that even Margaery sat quietly on her chair, though her legs were chrossed and her right foot whipped in the air, but she still was more quiet than she was in all those years he knew her.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Robb heard someone saying, and he knew, that the person who said that, was a woman. He even remembered that voice, but he didn\u2019t remember why and who is the owner.</p><p>Shortly after that, their teacher (Melisandre of Asshai, she wanted to be called \u201cMiss Asshai\u201d) came into the room and was followed by the new student.</p><p>It was a boy, but his head was lowered and long, dark hair covered most of his face.

He only knew it from the parallel class, where Renly Baratheon came as a new student into the class last year. </p><p>Exactly that Renly was sitting by the Tyrell-Twins in that moment. </p><p>It was the last year for him before he would make his exams.</p><p>He looked to the right side where the place was still free and instantly hoped that the new one will be kind, because he most likely will sit next to him.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe he moved,&rdquo; Jon said and sat down on the chair on Robbs left (it was his place, anyway), so he didn&rsquo;t have to stand any longer. </p><p>&ldquo;He?&rdquo; Robb repeated and grinned at Jon.</p><p>&ldquo;What if it&rsquo;s a girl?&rdquo; </p><p>Jon rolled his eyes and shaked his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, sure. You need to mock me again,&rdquo; he answered and smiled slightly. </p><p>The Stark took a moment and looked around in the class. This was the first day after their holidays, but many things didn&rsquo;t change. Margaery had, beneath her tattoo (a dark rose) on her left wrist, a piercing at her ear and on her lip, and a sidecut.</p><p>She had dyed platinum blond hair, too, but Margaery herself didn&rsquo;t change a little bit. While all the others stood together, greeted each other, Margaery sat there, half into the chair, her legs chrossed.</p><p>She was only fifteen, but her parents allowed all of that. </p><p>Loras, her twin, sat next to her.</p><p>And again, Robb wondered how they could be so different from each other. Loras had almost adorable, normal blond locks, and he didn&rsquo;t seem like a rebel at all. He was the complete opposite of Margaery.</p><p>Margaery was a real rebel, and with every year of school, it got worse. She also outet herself as bisexual without any hesitate, and shortly after that, she outet her brother as gay. And everyone, who made any rumours about that, did never say them in public. Margaery also punched people, and sometimes, she was pretty scary. </p><p>Robb did that punching thing for Sansa once, when Joffrey made her look like a bitch, even if she was only thirteen at that time. This made Robb so angry, that he just punched that boy in the face. The most ridiculous about that thing was, that almost everyone believed the rumours about Sansa, although they knew what Joffrey was like. </p><p>It was the first time Robb and Jon came with both sister to the school. Arya had made herself independent very soon, but they always go with her until she&rsquo;s at her class, so no one came too close to her on the way.</p><p>Robb sat up straight and fixed his uniform again. He saw again that Renly was talking with Margaery, but why was he even here? He should be in the room next to them. And what the heck was Loras doing? It seems like he was writing something. </p><p>Why was Robb even wondering about that? </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Robb!&rdquo; Jon said loudly, but the Stark only realized this, because he was waving before his face. </p><p>&ldquo;Did you listen to me?&rdquo; he asked indignantly and Robb cheeky shook his head before he started laughing.</p><p>&ldquo;Except Margaery and Daenerys no one actually changed over the holidays. Well, it&rsquo;s only Margaery, Danys hair is only longer and she did it different,&rdquo; Jon muttered into his ear, but Robb only smirked about that.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks for this enrichment,&rdquo; he added and the other moved away from him again.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you take a look at the newsboard? They didn&rsquo;t let that on what was there over the holidays, I&rsquo;m sure. They can fill three newsboards in a few minutes if they want.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon shrugged. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t there,&rdquo; he added and looked at Robb, who obviously was thinking again.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you still uncomfortable because the rumours about Sansa? They aren&rsquo;t on the board anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>Robb flinched and leaned back a bit.</p><p>&ldquo;You think that because you weren&rsquo;t on it yet. You get faster on it than you think, especially when you already were once.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon started to reflect that and leaned back, exactly like Robb a few moments before. </p><p>While he was thinking without saying anything, he watched how Daenerys talked with another girl from their class, called Victoria. They seemed to be pretty amused and made each other laugh. Robb already spoke with Victoria too, he could say that she was a funny and nice girl and he liked her. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in love with Dany?&rdquo; Robb asked his neighbour with a cunning voice.</p><p>Everyone in the class called her Dany for a long while, what she offered, so all of them accepted. Actually, Robb really was sure that he got one of the better and kinder classes. They could be big assholes sometimes, but there were worse people, he knew that very well. All of his siblings went to school, and there always were some new stories.</p><p>&ldquo;No, why would you think that?&rdquo; Jon asked and laughed when Robb started to look thoughtful again. &ldquo;You became silent compared to the earlier years. Stop thinking so long when I say something, it&rsquo;s weird,&rdquo; he added then and tapped the youngster next to him amused.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, you stare at Dany. Or after her.&rdquo;</p><p>After this, a bit spontaneous, answer, Jon rolled his eyes again, as the school bell rings suddenly. &ldquo;Finally,&rdquo; Robb said and quickly took out his things for the lesson.</p><p>Meanwhile, Renly was gone, most likely to his class, when it was shortly before ringing. Robb sat up normal again and they waited for their teacher, Miss Asshai. It took longer on this day, but suddenly, they heard voices through the open door. It was quiet enough to hear that, and Robb recognizes a foreign voice.</p><p><i>Wait a moment. Why are they even that quiet?</i></p><p>When Robb looked around, he saw, that even Margaery sat quietly on her chair, though her legs were chrossed and her right foot whipped in the air, but she still was more quiet than she was in all those years he knew her.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; Robb heard someone saying, and he knew, that the person who said that, was a woman. He even remembered that voice, but he didn&rsquo;t remember why and who is the owner.</p><p>Shortly after that, their teacher (Melisandre of Asshai, she wanted to be called &ldquo;Miss Asshai&rdquo;) came into the room and was followed by the new student.</p><p>It was a boy, but his head was lowered and long, dark hair covered most of his face. He walked kinda humpy and when he stood, it didn&rsquo;t look healthy as well.</p><p>He wore his uniform, but also thick gloves on his hands, and he seemed to feel better with them.</p><p>Well, he didn&rsquo;t seem to feel good at all.</p><p>Everyone started to whisper, but Robb remained silent and tried to catch a better look at the new one.</p><p>But in that moment, he looked up.</p><p>Robb notized his slight beard, red and swollen eyes, probably because of crying, and pale skin, where the cheekbones were easy to see. He looked really thin in general.</p><p>Robb frowned, but when the boy looked around in the class, and his gaze met his &ldquo;stalker&rsquo;s&rdquo;, Robb smiled a bit overwhelmed.</p><p>The student didn&rsquo;t stand the eye contact that was wanted by the Stark, and looked down again. </p><p>&ldquo;Be quiet, now,&rdquo; Melisandre said loudly enough and it was silent again shortly after.</p><p>&ldquo;This is your new classmate. His name is Theon Greyjoy. He just moved here, because his sister is making her last year at this school too,&rdquo; she told the class. &ldquo;There, next to Robb, in the middle row on the right side, is a free place.&rdquo;</p><p>Theon only nodded and went, a bit slower and more careful, to Robb, who was still watching him. And somewhere between the introduction and the new one sitting down, the class had gone completely silent.</p><p>Melisandre only watched a bit before she started the lesson, at least, after she exhorted Margaery to sit normal on her chair, knowing, that this wouldn&rsquo;t change anything.</p><p>Robb only looked down on his table after Jon tapped at him and whispered in his ear, that his staring is probably scaring the new one. Robb had shrugged and placed his gaze on his table then, while the lesson went on.</p><p>After some minutes, where Robb was looking clueless at the table, were gone, he finally decided to pay attention to the lesson. But he still couldn&rsquo;t avoid to look at Theon few times again, and so he was recognizing, that he wasn&rsquo;t saying a word, only sometimes he was whispering to himself, and he seemed really lost and alone in general. Robb sighed quietly. </p><p>He seemed to know how he can do things with that gloves on, because when they needed to write down something at the end of the lesson, Theon could write perfectly with that thick things on his hands. Well, he held the pen a bit weird, but Robb didn&rsquo;t care about that. He instantly said himself, that this wasn&rsquo;t his problem. Especially, when he found himself not paying attention again.</p></p>",

                "content": "<p><b>Arya x Gendry Week; Day 3: It&rsquo;s A Sign</b></p><p><b>in which sansa plays her emotional card</b></p><p><b><br /></b></p><p>&ldquo;This is why I don&rsquo;t hang out with you,&rdquo; Arya protested, glaring right at Sansa, who sat in a rather uncomfortable looking metal chair beside Arya&rsquo;s hospital bed. They&rsquo;d run through all the diagnostic crap and given her some painkillers. They&rsquo;d give her actual anesthesia too soon, but for now they were just waiting. Some doctor would then come and stitch her up and she&rsquo;d be free to go. All there was to it really. Unless of course, Sansa had her way.<b><br /></b></p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re right next door to us sis, I swear. It&rsquo;s a sign! I got up to go to the bathroom and they were just walking in. You could get up and stand next to the wall and hear everything they&rsquo;re saying. Because they&rsquo;re loud as all get out.&rdquo; Sansa would not quit. Because Arya had admitted once, once!, that the guy was hot. Technically, not even that! She had merely said, &ldquo;his eyes&rdquo;, which, to be entirely fair could mean anything. Maybe she was sketched out because his eyes were milky because he was blind. &ldquo;Also, I heard that, and I&rsquo;m very hurt, but I&rsquo;m willing to forgive you if you just go and talk to him!&rdquo; Sansa continued to protest.</p><p>&ldquo;He is a stranger Sansa, a stranger currently being treated for a head injury.&rdquo; This was a tired argument, one she wanted to just dismiss so she could go snog said stranger. Because damn, even if she didn&rsquo;t say it, she knew, he was smoking. Arya very much wanted every piece of him there was to offer. </p><p>&ldquo;In modern pick-up culture, someone being a stranger is no excuse. We live in a world where if you think someone&rsquo;s cute you talk to them and go from there. In this essay,&rdquo; Arya threw&hellip; nothing at her. She needed this hard, weird hospital pillow. She wanted to throw it sure but she wasn&rsquo;t going to.</p><p>&ldquo;Sansa please. I don&rsquo;t want to. Even if I did want to, I shouldn&rsquo;t leave. I&rsquo;m being treated for my head injury too, remember?&rdquo; She said, pointing to the wound on her forehead. Sansa finally seemed to lose some of the wind in her sails.</p><p>&ldquo;Listen, Ar, I just&hellip;&rdquo; Sansa pursed her lips and closed her eyes for a second. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a while, for me. Joffrey fucked me up, you know?&rdquo; She hesitated. Great, now they were having a moment, and Sansa was going to cry or something and then Arya would have to. Which would be the least problematic part. Also, she was here for her sister, despite her inner monologue being kind of dismissive. She knew Joffrey had done a number. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for trying to live through you. Maybe I&rsquo;ll just go talk to him myself&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;NO!&rdquo; Arya cried out, very suddenly, then blushed sheepishly. Well if that wasn&rsquo;t revealing of her actual feelings on the matter, then nothing would be.

Those were the words Robert had spoken to him three nights Ned had carried the heavy book of lineages to the King&rsquo;s chambers. He had expected to find Robert deep in his cups, maybe surrounded by a couple of whores, but the look on Robert&rsquo;s deep blue eyes had stopped Ned from leaving. Jon was safe, and Cat would have to understand: he had to stay.</p><p>They spent two days deciding behind closed doors. The Kingslayer was to be sent to the Wall, the injuries on the stump that used to be his sword hand would be treated by the Brother that was to sail to White Harbour by the end of the week. Cersei was to be returned to the Rock, to her brother Tyrion. Tywin Lannister had been so ashamed by the news, his heart had given in. But the children. Robert was most concerned about the children. Not Jeoffrey, who he had decided to send to the wall, for he was a little shit. However, beautiful Myrcella and sweet Tommen kept the King awake at night. It was only when Tyrion came to beg for the lives never endangered, that it had been decided they would stay with their uncle.<br/></p><p>Of that, it had been almost six years. Eddard knew of Gendry, or better, Prince Gendry. He knew he was Robert&rsquo;s the moment he had set eyes on the boy. However much, Gendry looked like his father, his character must have been inherited from his mother. He was good, and gentle, and not really as stupid as Ned&rsquo;s youngest daughter claimed him to be. So, because Gendry was good, Robert became better. He stopped drinking, only enjoyed the occasional prostitute, and started taking care of the Seven Kingdoms the rest had taken with himself.<br/></p><p>It had all gone smoothly for years until the time came. The time was then, and Prince Gendry Baratheon had to marry. Robert wanted Gendry to marry Arya, he had told Ned as much, but Robert had promised Sansa a crown, and Sansa wanted to be queen, at least, she had. The only reason why Arya stayed behind in the capital was so she could keep her dancing lessons with Syrio. Even if she liked Gendry well enough, and spent a lot of time with him exploring, she had no interest in boys. No. Not his little Arya.<br/></p><p>With all that in his hands, he was once again walking the gardens with Robert the topic of the prince&rsquo;s marriage about to show it&rsquo;s ugly head once more when they heard a commotion coming from near the rose garden.<br/></p><p>Arya stood red in the face accusingly looking at Margaery Tyrell who was sitting on a bench with her spine so straight Ned feared it would snap. Gendry stood in the middle of them, his eyes on Sansa who was only two or three steps behind Arya.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat is the meaning of all the shouting?\u201d Robert asked.<br/></p><p>\u201cFather&hellip;\u201d Gendry started.</p><p>\u201cI caught them!\u201d Arya screeched. \u201cI caught them conspiring, whispering about Sansa and the arranged marriage!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it wrong M'lady!\u201d Gendry said slipping to his old mannerisms.</p><p>\u201cDon&rsquo;t call me that!\u201d Arya answered turning furiously red, almost the same way Cat would turn red when Ned whispered sweet nothings in her ear. Funny, how the same traits could be inherited to show in completely different circumstances.</p><p>\u201cAnd why are you, Lady Arya outraged by it, when your sister seems unfaced?\u201d Robert asked amused.</p><p>\u201cMy sister is a lady, and incapable of making a scene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour sister just doesn&rsquo;t want to marry me.\u201d Gendry mumbled stubbornly.</p><p>\u201cSansa, do you want to marry the Prince?\u201d Ned asked his eldest.</p><p>\u201cNo\u201d Sansa answered in a heartbeat.</p><p>\u201cAnd why not?\u201d Arya said turning against her sister. \u201cHe is good, he is loyal, he cares about his people, he studies to overcome the shortcomings he thinks he has but no one cares about, he is handsome, and sweet, not a bad dancer, and he &hellip;\u201d Arya stopped then and blushed furiously.</p><p>\u201cWell, that settles it then\u201d Robert grinned.</p><p>\u201cFather,\u201d Gendry said amused, \u201cI have reason to believe the Lady Sansa is rather sad that if she were to marry me, she would have to stop visiting Highgarden. It may be of advantage to let her pursue a marriage there. Margaery&rsquo;s brother Loras is very fond of her.\u201d Poor Margaery blushed and squirmed when put on the spot in such a way. Ned liked the girl. She had always been so very nice to Sansa, and their friendship had grown in such ways in the years sharing the roof of the Red Keep, \u00a0they seldom slept in different rooms anymore.</p><p>\u201cWe shall talk about it tomorrow with your uncles present.\u201d Robert answered. \u201cAnd Gendry?\u201d He asked calling his son closer to him \u201cyou may want to give the Lady Arya part of her name-day gift now.\u201d He added winking. Gendry smiled, took Arya&rsquo;s hand in his, and pulled her somewhere.</p><p>\u201cWhat has gotten into the children today?\u201d Ned asked when they were far enough, having left Sansa and Margery closely whispering to each other on the bench.</p><p>\u201cYou jest, surely.\u201d Robert asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat about?\u201d</p><p>Robert laughed, he laughed until day turned into night and the candles of the Red Keep started dying out.</p>",

Go home, and be with the woman that loves you\u201d. Those were the words Robert had spoken to him three nights Ned had carried the heavy book of lineages to the King\u2019s chambers. He had expected to find Robert deep in his cups, maybe surrounded by a couple of whores, but the look on Robert\u2019s deep blue eyes had stopped Ned from leaving. Jon was safe, and Cat would have to understand: he had to stay.</p><p>They spent two days deciding behind closed doors. The Kingslayer was to be sent to the Wall, the injuries on the stump that used to be his sword hand would be treated by the Brother that was to sail to White Harbour by the end of the week. Cersei was to be returned to the Rock, to her brother Tyrion. Tywin Lannister had been so ashamed by the news, his heart had given in. But the children. Robert was most concerned about the children. Not Jeoffrey, who he had decided to send to the wall, for he was a little shit. However, beautiful Myrcella and sweet Tommen kept the King awake at night. It was only when Tyrion came to beg for the lives never endangered, that it had been decided they would stay with their uncle.<br></p><p>Of that, it had been almost six years. Eddard knew of Gendry, or better, Prince Gendry. He knew he was Robert\u2019s the moment he had set eyes on the boy. However much, Gendry looked like his father, his character must have been inherited from his mother. He was good, and gentle, and not really as stupid as Ned\u2019s youngest daughter claimed him to be. So, because Gendry was good, Robert became better. He stopped drinking, only enjoyed the occasional prostitute, and started taking care of the Seven Kingdoms the rest had taken with himself.<br></p><p>It had all gone smoothly for years until the time came. The time was then, and Prince Gendry Baratheon had to marry. Robert wanted Gendry to marry Arya, he had told Ned as much, but Robert had promised Sansa a crown, and Sansa wanted to be queen, at least, she had. The only reason why Arya stayed behind in the capital was so she could keep her dancing lessons with Syrio.
