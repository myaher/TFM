TJ would show up at Cyrus\u2019 dorm, Cyrus would pretend to be annoyed, eventually let him in, scold him for laying on his bed (\u201cIt\u2019s my bed! I should be the one sitting there!\u201d \u201cYou can sit next to me!\u201d \u201c&hellip;You can have the bed.\u201d), and they would talk about either their current assigned book or anything they were reading for fun. And if Cyrus got all of his work done before every Saturday just so he would have more time to talk, TJ didn\u2019t need to know that.</p><!-- more --><p>Over the course of the past few weeks, Cyrus has discovered that TJ was a major theatre and history nerd and could rap the entirety of Hamilton on a dime if asked, while TJ noticed Cyrus never, ever read without a pencil in his hand so he could underline and take note of things.</p><p>Despite them talking about anything and everything involving literature, Cyrus never let the conversation steer to anything else. TJ wasn\u2019t hurt by that, no, not at all. So Cyrus didn\u2019t trust him enough to talk about normal friend things. It\u2019s fine.</p><p>TJ had made his way over to Cyrus\u2019 dorm one Saturday, ready to rant for a hundredth time about how Holden Caulfield was a major hypocrite. He held his wrist up to knock on the door, but he never got the chance, as Cyrus opened the door at that moment. \u201cWhat, are you gonna punch me?\u201d he teased.</p><p>TJ dropped his arm and looked inside the room, noticing everything was cleared out. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Are you transferring out?\u201d He couldn\u2019t be transferring, not now, not when they were just getting to be good friends. He didn\u2019t know why it affected him so much, but he could not let him leave now.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh,\u201d Cyrus waved it off, \u201cI\u2019m repainting a wall in my room. Well, not me, because I\u2019d knock everything over, but I am getting it repainted.\u201d</p><p>TJ let out a small sigh of relief. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus smiled, rolling his eyes. \u201cAnyway, since the fumes are so strong that I\u2019m pretty sure I started hallucinating my essay talking to me a hot minute ago, it might be smart to go to your room today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, um, sure, yeah,\u201d TJ replied. He\u2019s gonna see my room, he thought. My messy, boring room, and he\u2019s gonna think I\u2019m messy and boring. Wait, why did he care if Cyrus thought he was messy and boring?</p><p>He didn\u2019t, right?</p><p>\u201cA man of many words, everyone,\u201d Cyrus joked. \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he added, making his way around TJ to walk to his room, and for some reason the only thing TJ could think was hey, he didn\u2019t shove me this time. Progress.</p><p>They stepped into the room, and while Cyrus took everything in, TJ was trying not to freak out whilst simultaneously trying to figure out why the hell he was freaking out in the first place. Cyrus was just in his room. No big deal. Right?</p><p>TJ watched Cyrus\u2019 eyes trail from his messy desk to his messy bed to his various basketball posters. \u201cSo you\u2019re a sports guy?\u201d Cyrus teased.</p><p>\u201cMore like sport guy,\u201d TJ answered, a soft smile on his face. \u201cBasketball was the only thing I could get into.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do any sport to save my life,\u201d Cyrus joked. \u201cI almost failed PE in the fifth grade.\u201d</p><p>TJ just laughed, taking a seat on his bed, while Cyrus was still glancing and pacing slowly around his room. TJ saw his eyes stop on something laying on his nightstand, and he turned his head to see what it was. Upon spotting the object, he snapped his head back to Cyrus in a panic.</p><p>\u201cOh, right, you\u2019re&hellip;\u201d Cyrus trailed off, an odd look on his face that TJ couldn\u2019t decipher.</p><p>\u201cGay?\u201d TJ sighed. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forgot about that,\u201d Cyrus said plainly.</p><p>TJ immediately went on the defense. \u201cIs that gonna be an issue?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 eyes widened. \u201cNo, no, dear god, no, it\u2019s not. I, uh, actually\u2014 you know what? Never mind.\u201d</p><p>TJ quirked one eyebrow, a small smirk resting on his face. \u201cYou good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then.\u201d</p><p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p><p>Cyrus sauntered down the hallway to the library to \u201creturn\u201d his latest read, alone as usual. That\u2019s when he saw it.</p><p>A bright pink poster pinned up in the hall, clashing with the brown wood of the walls surrounding it. A closer look at the poster told you it was announcing the first boys\u2019 basketball game of the season, taking place that Friday afternoon.</p><p>Wait\u2014 isn\u2019t today Friday?</p><p>He walked briskly toward the gym, book in hand long forgotten, and sure enough, it was packed with people. It definitely was not Cyrus\u2019 scene in the slightest, but when he spotted a certain dirty blonde running across the court in his Riverview jersey, he figured it would be okay to watch. To support his, friend? Acquaintance? Book buddy? Sure.</p><p>Cyrus didn\u2019t take a seat, he simply stood next to the bleachers watching. In all honesty, he had no idea how the game worked, he just knew you had to get the ball in the net and that he had never been able to do that. But, it was obvious TJ knew what he was doing, as he looked effortless out there. A small curl of hair flopped into his face then, and Cyrus couldn\u2019t help but think it looked cute.</p><p>Wait.</p><p>Oh, no.</p><p>That\u2019s definitely a crush.</p><p>Come to think of it, it\u2019s been there for a long time. And now it\u2019s gotten worse.</p><p>A girl with curly brown hair called out to him, snapping him out of his stupor for a moment, \u201cHey, you\u2019ve been standing around a while, do you want to sit with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cU-um, no, nope, I\u2019m good,\u201d he replied, more frazzled than anything else.</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d The curly haired girl\u2019s friend asked, adjusting her headband framing her jet black pixie cut.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I was, uh, just about to leave, anyway,\u201d Cyrus responded, backing out of the gym, but not without walking into the wall first.</p><p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p><p>This crush was ruining everything, Cyrus decided.</p><p>He was in history class and noticed that TJ was sitting in front of him, so he stared at the back of his head for the majority of class, as one does. And, as if that wasn\u2019t enough, when the teacher called on him, he answered \u201cCute.\u201d Cute, for god\u2019s sake!</p><p>To make matters worse, TJ wouldn\u2019t let it go for at least a week. At least he didn\u2019t know it was about him.</p><p>The crush was becoming more and more of a problem, too, as his witty banter was lacking.

TJ wasn\u2019t hurt by that, no, not at all. So Cyrus didn\u2019t trust him enough to talk about normal friend things. It\u2019s fine.</p><p>TJ had made his way over to Cyrus\u2019 dorm one Saturday, ready to rant for a hundredth time about how Holden Caulfield was a major hypocrite. He held his wrist up to knock on the door, but he never got the chance, as Cyrus opened the door at that moment. \u201cWhat, are you gonna punch me?\u201d he teased.</p><p>TJ dropped his arm and looked inside the room, noticing everything was cleared out. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Are you transferring out?\u201d He couldn\u2019t be transferring, not now, not when they were just getting to be good friends. He didn\u2019t know why it affected him so much, but he could not let him leave now.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh,\u201d Cyrus waved it off, \u201cI\u2019m repainting a wall in my room. Well, not me, because I\u2019d knock everything over, but I am getting it repainted.\u201d</p><p>TJ let out a small sigh of relief. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus smiled, rolling his eyes. \u201cAnyway, since the fumes are so strong that I\u2019m pretty sure I started hallucinating my essay talking to me a hot minute ago, it might be smart to go to your room today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, um, sure, yeah,\u201d TJ replied. He\u2019s gonna see my room, he thought. My messy, boring room, and he\u2019s gonna think I\u2019m messy and boring. Wait, why did he care if Cyrus thought he was messy and boring?</p><p>He didn\u2019t, right?</p><p>\u201cA man of many words, everyone,\u201d Cyrus joked. \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he added, making his way around TJ to walk to his room, and for some reason the only thing TJ could think was hey, he didn\u2019t shove me this time. Progress.</p><p>They stepped into the room, and while Cyrus took everything in, TJ was trying not to freak out whilst simultaneously trying to figure out why the hell he was freaking out in the first place. Cyrus was just in his room. No big deal. Right?</p><p>TJ watched Cyrus\u2019 eyes trail from his messy desk to his messy bed to his various basketball posters. \u201cSo you\u2019re a sports guy?\u201d Cyrus teased.</p><p>\u201cMore like sport guy,\u201d TJ answered, a soft smile on his face. \u201cBasketball was the only thing I could get into.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do any sport to save my life,\u201d Cyrus joked. \u201cI almost failed PE in the fifth grade.\u201d</p><p>TJ just laughed, taking a seat on his bed, while Cyrus was still glancing and pacing slowly around his room. TJ saw his eyes stop on something laying on his nightstand, and he turned his head to see what it was. Upon spotting the object, he snapped his head back to Cyrus in a panic.</p><p>\u201cOh, right, you\u2019re\u2026\u201d Cyrus trailed off, an odd look on his face that TJ couldn\u2019t decipher.</p><p>\u201cGay?\u201d TJ sighed. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forgot about that,\u201d Cyrus said plainly.</p><p>TJ immediately went on the defense. \u201cIs that gonna be an issue?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus\u2019 eyes widened. \u201cNo, no, dear god, no, it\u2019s not. I, uh, actually\u2014 you know what? Never mind.\u201d</p><p>TJ quirked one eyebrow, a small smirk resting on his face. \u201cYou good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then.\u201d</p><p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p><p>Cyrus sauntered down the hallway to the library to \u201creturn\u201d his latest read, alone as usual. That\u2019s when he saw it.</p><p>A bright pink poster pinned up in the hall, clashing with the brown wood of the walls surrounding it. A closer look at the poster told you it was announcing the first boys\u2019 basketball game of the season, taking place that Friday afternoon.</p><p>Wait\u2014 isn\u2019t today Friday?</p><p>He walked briskly toward the gym, book in hand long forgotten, and sure enough, it was packed with people. It definitely was not Cyrus\u2019 scene in the slightest, but when he spotted a certain dirty blonde running across the court in his Riverview jersey, he figured it would be okay to watch. To support his, friend? Acquaintance? Book buddy? Sure.</p><p>Cyrus didn\u2019t take a seat, he simply stood next to the bleachers watching. In all honesty, he had no idea how the game worked, he just knew you had to get the ball in the net and that he had never been able to do that. But, it was obvious TJ knew what he was doing, as he looked effortless out there. A small curl of hair flopped into his face then, and Cyrus couldn\u2019t help but think it looked cute.</p><p>Wait.</p><p>Oh, no.</p><p>That\u2019s definitely a crush.</p><p>Come to think of it, it\u2019s been there for a long time. And now it\u2019s gotten worse.</p><p>A girl with curly brown hair called out to him, snapping him out of his stupor for a moment, \u201cHey, you\u2019ve been standing around a while, do you want to sit with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cU-um, no, nope, I\u2019m good,\u201d he replied, more frazzled than anything else.</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d The curly haired girl\u2019s friend asked, adjusting her headband framing her jet black pixie cut.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I was, uh, just about to leave, anyway,\u201d Cyrus responded, backing out of the gym, but not without walking into the wall first.</p><p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p><p>This crush was ruining everything, Cyrus decided.</p><p>He was in history class and noticed that TJ was sitting in front of him, so he stared at the back of his head for the majority of class, as one does. And, as if that wasn\u2019t enough, when the teacher called on him, he answered \u201cCute.\u201d Cute, for god\u2019s sake!</p><p>To make matters worse, TJ wouldn\u2019t let it go for at least a week. At least he didn\u2019t know it was about him.</p><p>The crush was becoming more and more of a problem, too, as his witty banter was lacking. He couldn\u2019t tease him anymore, or for lack of a better word, flirt with him. What if TJ picked up on it?</p><p>He had to get rid of it as soon as possible.</p><p>No one can know.</p></p>",

Never mind.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ quirked one eyebrow, a small smirk resting on his face. &ldquo;You good?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, then.&rdquo;</p><p>&bull;&bull;&bull;</p><p>Cyrus sauntered down the hallway to the library to &ldquo;return&rdquo; his latest read, alone as usual. That&rsquo;s when he saw it.</p><p>A bright pink poster pinned up in the hall, clashing with the brown wood of the walls surrounding it. A closer look at the poster told you it was announcing the first boys&rsquo; basketball game of the season, taking place that Friday afternoon.</p><p>Wait&mdash; isn&rsquo;t today Friday?</p><p>He walked briskly toward the gym, book in hand long forgotten, and sure enough, it was packed with people. It definitely was not Cyrus&rsquo; scene in the slightest, but when he spotted a certain dirty blonde running across the court in his Riverview jersey, he figured it would be okay to watch. To support his, friend? Acquaintance? Book buddy? Sure.</p><p>Cyrus didn&rsquo;t take a seat, he simply stood next to the bleachers watching. In all honesty, he had no idea how the game worked, he just knew you had to get the ball in the net and that he had never been able to do that. But, it was obvious TJ knew what he was doing, as he looked effortless out there. A small curl of hair flopped into his face then, and Cyrus couldn&rsquo;t help but think it looked cute.</p><p>Wait.</p><p>Oh, no.</p><p>That&rsquo;s definitely a crush.</p><p>Come to think of it, it&rsquo;s been there for a long time. And now it&rsquo;s gotten worse.</p><p>A girl with curly brown hair called out to him, snapping him out of his stupor for a moment, &ldquo;Hey, you&rsquo;ve been standing around a while, do you want to sit with us?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;U-um, no, nope, I&rsquo;m good,&rdquo; he replied, more frazzled than anything else.</p><p>&ldquo;You sure?&rdquo; The curly haired girl&rsquo;s friend asked, adjusting her headband framing her jet black pixie cut.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I was, uh, just about to leave, anyway,&rdquo; Cyrus responded, backing out of the gym, but not without walking into the wall first.</p><p>&bull;&bull;&bull;</p><p>This crush was ruining everything, Cyrus decided.</p><p>He was in history class and noticed that TJ was sitting in front of him, so he stared at the back of his head for the majority of class, as one does. And, as if that wasn&rsquo;t enough, when the teacher called on him, he answered &ldquo;Cute.&rdquo; Cute, for god&rsquo;s sake!</p><p>To make matters worse, TJ wouldn&rsquo;t let it go for at least a week. At least he didn&rsquo;t know it was about him.</p><p>The crush was becoming more and more of a problem, too, as his witty banter was lacking. He couldn&rsquo;t tease him anymore, or for lack of a better word, flirt with him. What if TJ picked up on it?</p><p>He had to get rid of it as soon as possible.</p><p>No one can know.</p></p>",

I should be the one sitting there!&rdquo; &ldquo;You can sit next to me!&rdquo; &ldquo;&hellip;You can have the bed.&rdquo;), and they would talk about either their current assigned book or anything they were reading for fun.
