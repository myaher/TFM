It would be a wise choice, Tyrus is the story line that really sets Andi Mack apart. If I wanted to watch a poorly written love triangle pitting two girls against each other I could just re-watch GMW and if I wanted to watch a will they won\u2019t they Jandi style relationship I could watch literally every other teen show ever made.\u00a0On the bright side, if the ratings actually rise a bit during Tyrus episodes it may give Terri a bit more leverage as she writes the final episodes and maybe some more Tyrus scenes get approved than would have otherwise.\u00a0</p>",

I\u2019m almost certain that Disney never intended to air 3a in 2018 and it was only the collapse in ratings over the summer that spooked them into bringing back S3 after a less than two month hiatus. I think that was a very wise decision, if they had delayed S3 until January who knows how much more of the audience would have permanently left.\u00a0</p><p>I can\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised at the low ratings though. That S3 promo was released far too late and was far too angsty and depressing. It was not a promo designed to bring in new viewers or keep little kids watching. Nor did Disney properly promote the show at all. It\u2019s great that they had the cast do a tumblr ask session but we\u2019ll all be watching the show till the bitter end regardless.\u00a0</p><p>If the ratings keep tanking over the next few weeks I wonder if Disney will be panicked enough to break the glass on actually promoting Tyrus. Delaying Tyrus until ep 5 screws them over for October but if they\u2019re desperate enough they may really start hyping it in November. It would be a wise choice, Tyrus is the story line that really sets Andi Mack apart. If I wanted to watch a poorly written love triangle pitting two girls against each other I could just re-watch GMW and if I wanted to watch a will they won\u2019t they Jandi style relationship I could watch literally every other teen show ever made.\u00a0On the bright side, if the ratings actually rise a bit during Tyrus episodes it may give Terri a bit more leverage as she writes the final episodes and maybe some more Tyrus scenes get approved than would have otherwise.\u00a0</p>",

But given an interview with Sofia where she mentions an episode will revolve around Cyrus and an issue that will have a\u00a0\u201cvery important message to get across\u00a0 in our day an age\u201d it has me wondering that if the blond boy (anyone got a name for him yet?) is in THAT episode maybe we have misread the trailer entirely.\u00a0</p><p>Lets be frank: america has come along way but its still heavy with homophobic violence and parties built on making LGBTQ people suffer. whats a good way to show that this is not right to a younger audience and make them aware of their own actions towards others, LGBTQ or otherwise? have a watered down version be a threat to a character on their show. by watered down i mean verbally attacking Cyrus without using the words that THEY use in real life but still implying his sexuality in a negative way. Maybe thats what the blond guy is, a bully who has guessed Cyrus\u2019s sexuality and is mocking him in front of TJ, who took cyrus to the rally. Cyrus looking for support turns to TJ but he does nothing,\u00a0 causing cyrus that hurt look as he looks back at blonde guy realizing he is all alone dealing with this. this way the young audience is shown both the horrible situation someone being attacked this way is in and how doing nothing to aid the victim makes them a part of the bullying by allowing it to happen. they can then question if they have ever done anything like this or what they would do if they saw it happening to someone they knew.\u00a0 this could also be the cause of the look in the cafeteria: a friendship damaged by TJ not helping his friend when he needed him the most, perhaps out of fear he would then become a target by association with Cyrus. Cyrus does look the more hurt out of the two in that scene.\u00a0</p><p>That situation is pretty dark for a Disney show but then this is Andi Mack, a show thats pushing alot of topics not handled by kids shows.\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>Another theory i havent really seen thats a little bit lighter than my other theory is that maybe Blond guy is either TJ\u2019s boyfriend or ex. Maybe TJ and blond guy got together before he and cyrus even became good friends and TJ had been keeping him a secret because either a) their still together or b) he\u2019s still trying to figure cyrus out and waiting to come out to him. then they meet Blond guy at the rally and TJ is not only possibly outed by him to cyrus but reveals their relationship which might cause cyrus\u2019s hurt look: the guy he has been crushing on kept not only his sexuality a secret but also that he was in a relationship. i think this one is less likely but dont think many people would see it coming.\u00a0</p><p>personally i hope it is that cyrus now has 2 guys interested in him as a lot of people seem to have taken the trailer that way (myself included first time i watched it). but the fact theirs going to be a Cyrus centered episode can only be a good thing whatever subject matter they tackle, boy troubles or not.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>",
