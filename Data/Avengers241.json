I had to extract you from that suit after the blast.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The portal closed.&rdquo; The words finally sink in. &ldquo;So the Earth &ndash; &rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Safe as houses,&rdquo; the man says. &ldquo;You were slightly worse for the wear. I did what I could, but I&rsquo;m afraid you may be feeling some residual discomfort.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s putting it lightly.&rdquo; Tony sits up and pulls the sheet over his lap.</p><p>The man stands. &ldquo;There are clothes just outside,&rdquo; he says, indicating a door Tony hadn&rsquo;t seen before, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll find a washroom around the corner.

He&rsquo;d wonder about it, but his head hurts and the hot spray of the water feels better than sex, so he puts it out of his mind. \u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Took you long enough,&rdquo; the pinstriped Brit says, when Tony wanders into the console room.</p><p>&ldquo;This is&hellip;&rdquo; Tony stops, one hand on the wall, his eyes moving over the wires and panels and the column of light at the core of the TARDIS. &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Time machine.&rdquo; The man flips a switch.</p><p>Tony shakes his head. &ldquo;And who are you?&rdquo;</p><p>Flash of a grin, gone in an instant. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the Doctor.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony blinks. &ldquo;Doctor who?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So I&rsquo;ve heard,&rdquo; the Doctor says.</p><p>&ldquo;Time machine,&rdquo; Tony repeats. He sinks painfully to the floor.</p><p>The Doctor saunters over to Tony and drops to the floor beside him. &ldquo;S'called the TARDIS,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;Time and Relative Dimensions in Space.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not really what I expected a time machine to look like,&rdquo; Tony says, leaning back on his hands and letting his gaze wander over the console room.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem surprised,&rdquo; the Doctor says.</p><p>Tony sees, out of the corner of his eye, the narrow, assessing look on the Doctor&rsquo;s face. \u00a0He grins. &ldquo;Well. It&rsquo;s not the first encounter I&rsquo;ve had with&hellip;relative dimensions.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Build that suit yourself?&rdquo; The Doctor jerks his chin in the direction of the bedroom.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, why, want one?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, no.&rdquo; The Doctor&rsquo;s gaze hasn&rsquo;t left Tony&rsquo;s face. His eyes are wide and dark and serious. &ldquo;May I ask you a question?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you been already?&rdquo; Tony lets his hands slide across the floor away from his body, until he&rsquo;s lying flat on his back.</p><p>&ldquo;If that arc reactor comes out, would it kill you?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony sits up and looks sharply at the Doctor, one hand automatically going to his chest to cover the arc reactor. &ldquo;What do you know about it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get defensive,&rdquo; the Doctor says placatingly. He springs to his feet. &ldquo;It was just a bit&hellip;disarming&hellip;to see it in person.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean, <i>in person</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We-ell.&rdquo; The Doctor shrugs a little. &ldquo;You know. I&rsquo;d heard about it, and all, but I had a hard time believing that twenty-first century humans would be able to come up with something so&hellip;innovative.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You know what they say about necessity, it&rsquo;s a motherfucker.&rdquo; Tony fixes the Doctor with a hard stare. &ldquo;Or something like that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Something indeed.&rdquo; The Doctor doesn&rsquo;t blink or look away.</p><p>Finally Tony clears his throat. &ldquo;You want to take me back to Earth, or what? Because my team is probably going to, you know, wonder where I am.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t quite yet, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; the Doctor says. &ldquo;I was actually on a rather urgent mission. I was hoping to arrive at the Chitauri entry point prior to the invasion, but I was unavoidably delayed.&rdquo;</p>",

I will never forget you and all the things you have done for me.\u201d he sobbed as he placed a kiss on your finger, right above your wedding ring, \u201cI love you&hellip;.and I will complete our mission, I will take over Midgard, just for you.\u201d he promised you before kissing your cold lips one more time.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>-</p><p><br/></p><p>That was months ago. A memory that never left Loki\u2019s mind, even when he is trapped inside a Hulk-proof glass prison in the the helicare.</p><p>He paced back and forth, thinking about you&hellip;he never stopped thinking about you&hellip;</p><p>He felt a presence behind him.

She is the reason that his loving innocent sweet wife, and his unborn son are dead.</p><p>\u201cRelease him.\u201d was all she said.<br/></p><p>\u201cI am afraid I do not know what you mean.\u201d he said, the smirk still not leaving his lips.<br/></p><p>\u201cAgent Barton. I want you to let him go&hellip;I know you took over his mind, and he is serving you as your slave&hellip;\u201d she said. folding her arms over her chest.</p><p>Loki chuckled.\u00a0\u201cAnd why do you care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my friend Loki.\u201d Natasha said, she looked at him with anger.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cOh, I think it is more than that, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cJust release him.\u201d Natasha said.<br/></p><p>Loki chuckled once again.\u00a0\u201c<i>Is this love</i>, agent Romanoff?\u201d<b> (GIF ABOVE)</b></p><p>Natasha nodded.\u00a0\u201cMaybe it is&hellip;\u201d she looked at him, angrily.</p><p>Loki chuckled, darkly and angrily this time.</p><p>\u201cSo you do know what love is then, hmmm? If you do, then why would you kill her?\u201d Loki asked, his smirk replaced with a angry furrow of his brows.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou mean your apprentice? Well if I didn\u2019t she could have helped you. And I cannot let that happen. Besides, I highly doubt she was willing to work for you. Poor girl, must have just been your fuck toy.\u201d Natasha said.\u00a0<br/></p><p>At this, Loki felt anger bubble inside him. He slammed his fist into the glass wall, making Natasha jump and yelp in surprise.</p><p>\u201cHow dare you! how dare you call her my fuck toy, you mewling quim! She is more than that. She was my wife, the love of my life. She was innocent, she would never hurt anyone. All she wanted to do was bring me back home. But then, you killed her.\u201d he spat at her bitterly.<br/></p><p>Natasha back away, terrified.</p><p>\u201cAnd never forget where you stabbed her! You stabbed her on her stomach, the very area where my son was growing!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Natasha looked at him, surprised.</p><p>\u201cAnd you call your selves heroes&hellip;pity.\u201d he said, removing his fists from the glass.<br/></p><p>\u201cPity indeed. Release Clint.\u201d she said, she didn\u2019t know how to respond to Loki. She was too shocked.<br/></p><p>Natasha had to admit, that Y/N looked innocent when she killed her. She remembers how she begged her to spare her life and how she mentioned she was innocent, yet Natasha didn\u2019t care. She stabbed her anyways.</p><p>Loki looked at her with even more disgust.</p><p>\u201cNo, I will not! When I get out of this cell and return to my lair, I will kill agent Barton, and I will have you watch it as I plunge my scepter through his stomach!\u201d he spat at her.\u00a0\u201cJust like how you did to my wife!\u201d<br/></p><p>Natasha didn\u2019t want to hear anymore, she left to tell the others about what he said, leaving Loki an angry and crying mess.</p><p><br/></p><p>-</p><p><br/></p><p>In Odin\u2019s order, Loki had to stay with the Avengers and help them in missions.</p><p>And of course he despised it. Living with the very people who defeated him months ago as shameful as it sounds, and the women who killed his wife and child.</p><p>Thor was joyed about it though, but the rest, not so much.</p><p>Yet they felt bad for Loki. After Natasha told them, they, surprisingly, felt very bad for the god of mischief.</p><p>But they also knew Loki was innocent, and Thanos was behind it.</p><p>\u201cOof, I feel bad for reindeer games.\u201d Tony said.<br/></p><p>\u201cSurprisingly, me too.\u201d Clint said.<br/></p><p>\u201cI feel guilty to be honest. I mean I am the one who killed his wife.\u201d Natasha said.<br/></p><p>\u201cWe also attacked her Natasha, your not the only one.\u201d Steve said.<br/></p><p>\u201cI met Y/N before, she was indeed a sweet girl. And she has changed Loki in so many ways, positive ones of course. I have never seen him be sweet, and kind, and loving to another. Maybe if she was still alive, Loki could have been that person with us, and with me! He could be our good friend as well.\u201d Thor said, a bit excitedly.\u00a0</p><p>So&hellip;by Thor\u2019s request, and Tony\u2019s idea, they prepared a surprise that they hope will change Loki, for the better.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon brother, just a few more steps.\u201d Thor said. His large hands covering Loki\u2019s eyes as he walked him over to the door of his room.</p><p>\u201cUgh! I swear Thor, that if this surprise is useless, then I will-\u201d\u00a0\u201cDo not worry brother, I am pretty sure you will love it.\u201d Thor cut Loki off.<br/></p><p>Once Thor removed his hands away from Loki\u2019s eyes, he found himself to be standing in front of <i>his</i> own room.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hel Thor? This is my surprise!?\u201d Loki mumbled angrily.\u00a0\u201cOh how lovely! my very own door! Thanks Thor! I always wanted one!\u201d Loki said angrily and sarcastically .<br/></p><p>Thor just chuckled as he shoved a bouquet of white and pink roses into Loki\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cThe surprise is inside brother.\u201d Thor said as he patted Loki\u2019s shoulders.<br/></p><p>Then, Thor opened the door. Loki looked in to find a crib, placed beside his king sized four poster bed, and a women sitting on the window seat, glaring outside the window as she swing her legs from side to side.</p><p>\u201cReally, a women? And a bloody crib? You know I don\u2019t want to court anyone else Thor! Not after her death!\u201d Loki said as he turned around to leave.\u00a0\u201cAnd what the hel is the crib for?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Thor chuckled.\u00a0\u201cNo brother, look.\u201d he said, turning him around.</p><p>Loki scoffed as he studied the women. she had H/L H/T H/C hair. She wore a golden dress, the same one Y/N wore the&hellip;the day she died.</p><p>She also had a golden flower crown, the same one he gave Y/N, and the same one she wore on their wedding day&hellip;</p><p>\u201cWhat is the meaning of this broth-\u201d Loki stopped once her face turned towards him, and their eyes met.</p><p>Familiar E/C eyes, S/C skin and a F/S face, and most importantly, her smile&hellip;</p><p>\u201cY&hellip;Y-Y/N?\u201d Loki mumbled in disbelief? His hands shaking as the grip of the flower bouquet tightened.\u00a0<br/></p><p>That smile he had had for a year now, that smile that haunted his dreams, plastered itself on her lips as she ran towards him.</p><p>She hands wrapped them around Loki\u2019s neck. He however did not hug back for he couldn\u2019t believe what was happening.</p><p>He didn\u2019t move an inch, he felt like his body was made of stones, he felt like his feet are stuck to the ground. His mind was blank in shock.</p><p>\u201cLoki?\u201d Y/N said as she pulled away, confused and worried on why he didn\u2019t hug her back.\u00a0\u201cAre you okay?\u201d she asked, cupping his cheeks.<br/></p><p>And when the message was processed, his mind awoke from it\u2019s blank state, his rock like stiff body softened, and his legs grew weak, as his eyes brimmed with long held tears, that are now filled with only happiness and joy.</p><p>\u201cY/N&hellip;\u201d he whispered, the bouquet of roses falling down to the floor as he bought her into his embrace, holding her close as if she would disappear again if he let go.<br/></p><p>Y/N happily wrapped her arms around his neck as she held him tight, running her hands through his hair as she felt warm tears fall onto her bare shoulder.</p><p>A few of her own tears fell down, she may have not been there to experience Loki\u2019s state after her supposed death, but she knew enough to know what his state would have been.</p><p>\u201cH-How?\u201d he asked as he pulled away, his arms still wrapped around her waist.<br/></p><p>\u201cYour brother, Stephan Strange and the Avengers traveled back in time and bought me here. They explained everything to me. I\u2019m sorry I put you through all that.\u201d<br/></p><p>Loki shook his head as he placed his forehead over yours.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo, my love. You have done nothing wrong but repair my broken heart.\u201d he said as he placed his lips over yours, kissing you, tasting your sweet lips as he savored it.<br/></p><p>\u201cAnd&hellip;\u201d he said pulling away as his hand rubbed over your now flat belly. He felt sadness take over him&hellip;his son didn\u2019t make it after all&hellip;<br/></p><p>Y/N sighed as she placed her hands over his.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it Loki, his safe.\u201d you said, a smile placing it self over your lips.<br/></p><p>\u201cI know love. As you said, he must be the sweetest angel up there.\u201d Loki said, still holding you close as his forehead was pressed against yours.<br/></p><p>You giggled.\u00a0\u201cThat is not what I mean\u2019t\u201d you said as you took his hand in your, taking him towards the crib.</p><p>His eyes lit up in realization as more tears poured out of his eyes. You pulled him towards the crib as now he stood in front of it, his eyes landing on a cute little bundle wrapped in silky green sheets.</p><p>\u201cHe was born last night. S/N Lokison&hellip;\u201d you said, giggling at Loki\u2019s reaction.<br/></p><p>He looked down and S/N in awe.</p><p>Loki picked him up and held your son close, chuckling in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cS/N&hellip;S/N Lokison&hellip;my very own son&hellip;\u201d he mumbled as he rocked him back and forth, swinging from side to side.<br/></p><p>\u201cThis surely is some dream, everything is so unreal.\u201d he mumbled, tears pouring out of his eyes as he held his finger out, S/N grabbed it as he smiled up at his father.<br/></p><p>\u201cYet so real.\u201d you added.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Loki\u2019s eyes softened as he pulled you close by the hips, holding his son at the other.</p><p>\u201cI love you Y/N, and I love you S/N&hellip;\u201d he said, too overwhelmed to ever look at them as he closed his eyes.<br/></p><p>\u201cAnd we love you too&hellip;we will never leave you again.\u201d you said, snuggling closer to him.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cit\u2019s a beautiful dream, that I don\u2019t have to wake up, that will never fade away into a blur. It\u2019s a real beautiful dream&hellip;\u201d<br/></p><p>He forgot about everything, his he did in the past, what he is known to be, what he really is. All that mattered to him was his wife and son, who he will love and protect until his last breath is taken.</p><p><br/></p><p><b>Too much fluff, I know xD But I hope ya\u2019ll enjoyed it.\u00a0</b></p>",

She is the reason that his loving innocent sweet wife, and his unborn son are dead.</p><p>\u201cRelease him.\u201d was all she said.<br></p><p>\u201cI am afraid I do not know what you mean.\u201d he said, the smirk still not leaving his lips.<br></p><p>\u201cAgent Barton. I want you to let him go\u2026I know you took over his mind, and he is serving you as your slave\u2026\u201d she said. folding her arms over her chest.</p><p>Loki chuckled.\u00a0\u201cAnd why do you care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my friend Loki.\u201d Natasha said, she looked at him with anger.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOh, I think it is more than that, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cJust release him.\u201d Natasha said.<br></p><p>Loki chuckled once again.\u00a0\u201c<i>Is this love</i>, agent Romanoff?\u201d<b> (GIF ABOVE)</b></p><p>Natasha nodded.\u00a0\u201cMaybe it is\u2026\u201d she looked at him, angrily.</p><p>Loki chuckled, darkly and angrily this time.</p><p>\u201cSo you do know what love is then, hmmm? If you do, then why would you kill her?\u201d Loki asked, his smirk replaced with a angry furrow of his brows.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou mean your apprentice? Well if I didn\u2019t she could have helped you. And I cannot let that happen. Besides, I highly doubt she was willing to work for you. Poor girl, must have just been your fuck toy.\u201d Natasha said.\u00a0<br></p><p>At this, Loki felt anger bubble inside him. He slammed his fist into the glass wall, making Natasha jump and yelp in surprise.</p><p>\u201cHow dare you! how dare you call her my fuck toy, you mewling quim! She is more than that. She was my wife, the love of my life. She was innocent, she would never hurt anyone. All she wanted to do was bring me back home. But then, you killed her.\u201d he spat at her bitterly.<br></p><p>Natasha back away, terrified.</p><p>\u201cAnd never forget where you stabbed her! You stabbed her on her stomach, the very area where my son was growing!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Natasha looked at him, surprised.</p><p>\u201cAnd you call your selves heroes\u2026pity.\u201d he said, removing his fists from the glass.<br></p><p>\u201cPity indeed. Release Clint.\u201d she said, she didn\u2019t know how to respond to Loki. She was too shocked.<br></p><p>Natasha had to admit, that Y/N looked innocent when she killed her. She remembers how she begged her to spare her life and how she mentioned she was innocent, yet Natasha didn\u2019t care. She stabbed her anyways.</p><p>Loki looked at her with even more disgust.</p><p>\u201cNo, I will not! When I get out of this cell and return to my lair, I will kill agent Barton, and I will have you watch it as I plunge my scepter through his stomach!\u201d he spat at her.\u00a0\u201cJust like how you did to my wife!\u201d<br></p><p>Natasha didn\u2019t want to hear anymore, she left to tell the others about what he said, leaving Loki an angry and crying mess.</p><p><br></p><p>-</p><p><br></p><p>In Odin\u2019s order, Loki had to stay with the Avengers and help them in missions.</p><p>And of course he despised it. Living with the very people who defeated him months ago as shameful as it sounds, and the women who killed his wife and child.</p><p>Thor was joyed about it though, but the rest, not so much.</p><p>Yet they felt bad for Loki. After Natasha told them, they, surprisingly, felt very bad for the god of mischief.</p><p>But they also knew Loki was innocent, and Thanos was behind it.</p><p>\u201cOof, I feel bad for reindeer games.\u201d Tony said.<br></p><p>\u201cSurprisingly, me too.\u201d Clint said.<br></p><p>\u201cI feel guilty to be honest. I mean I am the one who killed his wife.\u201d Natasha said.<br></p><p>\u201cWe also attacked her Natasha, your not the only one.\u201d Steve said.<br></p><p>\u201cI met Y/N before, she was indeed a sweet girl. And she has changed Loki in so many ways, positive ones of course. I have never seen him be sweet, and kind, and loving to another. Maybe if she was still alive, Loki could have been that person with us, and with me! He could be our good friend as well.\u201d Thor said, a bit excitedly.\u00a0</p><p>So\u2026by Thor\u2019s request, and Tony\u2019s idea, they prepared a surprise that they hope will change Loki, for the better.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon brother, just a few more steps.\u201d Thor said. His large hands covering Loki\u2019s eyes as he walked him over to the door of his room.</p><p>\u201cUgh! I swear Thor, that if this surprise is useless, then I will-\u201d\u00a0\u201cDo not worry brother, I am pretty sure you will love it.\u201d Thor cut Loki off.<br></p><p>Once Thor removed his hands away from Loki\u2019s eyes, he found himself to be standing in front of <i>his</i> own room.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hel Thor? This is my surprise!?\u201d Loki mumbled angrily.\u00a0\u201cOh how lovely! my very own door! Thanks Thor! I always wanted one!\u201d Loki said angrily and sarcastically .<br></p><p>Thor just chuckled as he shoved a bouquet of white and pink roses into Loki\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cThe surprise is inside brother.\u201d Thor said as he patted Loki\u2019s shoulders.<br></p><p>Then, Thor opened the door. Loki looked in to find a crib, placed beside his king sized four poster bed, and a women sitting on the window seat, glaring outside the window as she swing her legs from side to side.</p><p>\u201cReally, a women? And a bloody crib? You know I don\u2019t want to court anyone else Thor! Not after her death!\u201d Loki said as he turned around to leave.\u00a0\u201cAnd what the hel is the crib for?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Thor chuckled.\u00a0\u201cNo brother, look.\u201d he said, turning him around.</p><p>Loki scoffed as he studied the women. she had H/L H/T H/C hair. She wore a golden dress, the same one Y/N wore the\u2026the day she died.</p><p>She also had a golden flower crown, the same one he gave Y/N, and the same one she wore on their wedding day\u2026</p><p>\u201cWhat is the meaning of this broth-\u201d Loki stopped once her face turned towards him, and their eyes met.</p><p>Familiar E/C eyes, S/C skin and a F/S face, and most importantly, her smile\u2026</p><p>\u201cY\u2026Y-Y/N?\u201d Loki mumbled in disbelief? His hands shaking as the grip of the flower bouquet tightened.\u00a0<br></p><p>That smile he had had for a year now, that smile that haunted his dreams, plastered itself on her lips as she ran towards him.</p><p>She hands wrapped them around Loki\u2019s neck. He however did not hug back for he couldn\u2019t believe what was happening.</p><p>He didn\u2019t move an inch, he felt like his body was made of stones, he felt like his feet are stuck to the ground. His mind was blank in shock.</p><p>\u201cLoki?\u201d Y/N said as she pulled away, confused and worried on why he didn\u2019t hug her back.\u00a0\u201cAre you okay?\u201d she asked, cupping his cheeks.<br></p><p>And when the message was processed, his mind awoke from it\u2019s blank state, his rock like stiff body softened, and his legs grew weak, as his eyes brimmed with long held tears, that are now filled with only happiness and joy.</p><p>\u201cY/N\u2026\u201d he whispered, the bouquet of roses falling down to the floor as he bought her into his embrace, holding her close as if she would disappear again if he let go.<br></p><p>Y/N happily wrapped her arms around his neck as she held him tight, running her hands through his hair as she felt warm tears fall onto her bare shoulder.</p><p>A few of her own tears fell down, she may have not been there to experience Loki\u2019s state after her supposed death, but she knew enough to know what his state would have been.</p><p>\u201cH-How?\u201d he asked as he pulled away, his arms still wrapped around her waist.<br></p><p>\u201cYour brother, Stephan Strange and the Avengers traveled back in time and bought me here. They explained everything to me. I\u2019m sorry I put you through all that.\u201d<br></p><p>Loki shook his head as he placed his forehead over yours.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo, my love. You have done nothing wrong but repair my broken heart.\u201d he said as he placed his lips over yours, kissing you, tasting your sweet lips as he savored it.<br></p><p>\u201cAnd\u2026\u201d he said pulling away as his hand rubbed over your now flat belly. He felt sadness take over him\u2026his son didn\u2019t make it after all\u2026<br></p><p>Y/N sighed as she placed her hands over his.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it Loki, his safe.\u201d you said, a smile placing it self over your lips.<br></p><p>\u201cI know love. As you said, he must be the sweetest angel up there.\u201d Loki said, still holding you close as his forehead was pressed against yours.<br></p><p>You giggled.\u00a0\u201cThat is not what I mean\u2019t\u201d you said as you took his hand in your, taking him towards the crib.</p><p>His eyes lit up in realization as more tears poured out of his eyes. You pulled him towards the crib as now he stood in front of it, his eyes landing on a cute little bundle wrapped in silky green sheets.</p><p>\u201cHe was born last night. S/N Lokison\u2026\u201d you said, giggling at Loki\u2019s reaction.<br></p><p>He looked down and S/N in awe.</p><p>Loki picked him up and held your son close, chuckling in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cS/N\u2026S/N Lokison\u2026my very own son\u2026\u201d he mumbled as he rocked him back and forth, swinging from side to side.<br></p><p>\u201cThis surely is some dream, everything is so unreal.\u201d he mumbled, tears pouring out of his eyes as he held his finger out, S/N grabbed it as he smiled up at his father.<br></p><p>\u201cYet so real.\u201d you added.\u00a0<br></p><p>Loki\u2019s eyes softened as he pulled you close by the hips, holding his son at the other.</p><p>\u201cI love you Y/N, and I love you S/N\u2026\u201d he said, too overwhelmed to ever look at them as he closed his eyes.<br></p><p>\u201cAnd we love you too\u2026we will never leave you again.\u201d you said, snuggling closer to him.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cit\u2019s a beautiful dream, that I don\u2019t have to wake up, that will never fade away into a blur. It\u2019s a real beautiful dream\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>He forgot about everything, his he did in the past, what he is known to be, what he really is. All that mattered to him was his wife and son, who he will love and protect until his last breath is taken.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Too much fluff, I know xD But I hope ya\u2019ll enjoyed it.\u00a0</b></p>",

She is the reason that his loving innocent sweet wife, and his unborn son are dead.</p><p>\u201cRelease him.\u201d was all she said.<br></p><p>\u201cI am afraid I do not know what you mean.\u201d he said, the smirk still not leaving his lips.<br></p><p>\u201cAgent Barton. I want you to let him go\u2026I know you took over his mind, and he is serving you as your slave\u2026\u201d she said. folding her arms over her chest.</p><p>Loki chuckled.\u00a0\u201cAnd why do you care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my friend Loki.\u201d Natasha said, she looked at him with anger.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cOh, I think it is more than that, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cJust release him.\u201d Natasha said.<br></p><p>Loki chuckled once again.\u00a0\u201c<i>Is this love</i>, agent Romanoff?\u201d<b> (GIF ABOVE)</b></p><p>Natasha nodded.\u00a0\u201cMaybe it is\u2026\u201d she looked at him, angrily.</p><p>Loki chuckled, darkly and angrily this time.</p><p>\u201cSo you do know what love is then, hmmm? If you do, then why would you kill her?\u201d Loki asked, his smirk replaced with a angry furrow of his brows.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou mean your apprentice? Well if I didn\u2019t she could have helped you. And I cannot let that happen. Besides, I highly doubt she was willing to work for you. Poor girl, must have just been your fuck toy.\u201d Natasha said.\u00a0<br></p><p>At this, Loki felt anger bubble inside him. He slammed his fist into the glass wall, making Natasha jump and yelp in surprise.</p><p>\u201cHow dare you! how dare you call her my fuck toy, you mewling quim! She is more than that. She was my wife, the love of my life. She was innocent, she would never hurt anyone. All she wanted to do was bring me back home. But then, you killed her.\u201d he spat at her bitterly.<br></p><p>Natasha back away, terrified.</p><p>\u201cAnd never forget where you stabbed her! You stabbed her on her stomach, the very area where my son was growing!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Natasha looked at him, surprised.</p><p>\u201cAnd you call your selves heroes\u2026pity.\u201d he said, removing his fists from the glass.<br></p><p>\u201cPity indeed. Release Clint.\u201d she said, she didn\u2019t know how to respond to Loki. She was too shocked.<br></p><p>Natasha had to admit, that Y/N looked innocent when she killed her. She remembers how she begged her to spare her life and how she mentioned she was innocent, yet Natasha didn\u2019t care. She stabbed her anyways.</p><p>Loki looked at her with even more disgust.</p><p>\u201cNo, I will not! When I get out of this cell and return to my lair, I will kill agent Barton, and I will have you watch it as I plunge my scepter through his stomach!\u201d he spat at her.\u00a0\u201cJust like how you did to my wife!\u201d<br></p><p>Natasha didn\u2019t want to hear anymore, she left to tell the others about what he said, leaving Loki an angry and crying mess.</p><p><br></p><p>-</p><p><br></p><p>In Odin\u2019s order, Loki had to stay with the Avengers and help them in missions.</p><p>And of course he despised it. Living with the very people who defeated him months ago as shameful as it sounds, and the women who killed his wife and child.</p><p>Thor was joyed about it though, but the rest, not so much.</p><p>Yet they felt bad for Loki. After Natasha told them, they, surprisingly, felt very bad for the god of mischief.</p><p>But they also knew Loki was innocent, and Thanos was behind it.</p><p>\u201cOof, I feel bad for reindeer games.\u201d Tony said.<br></p><p>\u201cSurprisingly, me too.\u201d Clint said.<br></p><p>\u201cI feel guilty to be honest. I mean I am the one who killed his wife.\u201d Natasha said.<br></p><p>\u201cWe also attacked her Natasha, your not the only one.\u201d Steve said.<br></p><p>\u201cI met Y/N before, she was indeed a sweet girl. And she has changed Loki in so many ways, positive ones of course. I have never seen him be sweet, and kind, and loving to another. Maybe if she was still alive, Loki could have been that person with us, and with me! He could be our good friend as well.\u201d Thor said, a bit excitedly.\u00a0</p><p>So\u2026by Thor\u2019s request, and Tony\u2019s idea, they prepared a surprise that they hope will change Loki, for the better.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon brother, just a few more steps.\u201d Thor said. His large hands covering Loki\u2019s eyes as he walked him over to the door of his room.</p><p>\u201cUgh! I swear Thor, that if this surprise is useless, then I will-\u201d\u00a0\u201cDo not worry brother, I am pretty sure you will love it.\u201d Thor cut Loki off.<br></p><p>Once Thor removed his hands away from Loki\u2019s eyes, he found himself to be standing in front of <i>his</i> own room.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hel Thor? This is my surprise!?\u201d Loki mumbled angrily.\u00a0\u201cOh how lovely! my very own door! Thanks Thor! I always wanted one!\u201d Loki said angrily and sarcastically .<br></p><p>Thor just chuckled as he shoved a bouquet of white and pink roses into Loki\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cThe surprise is inside brother.\u201d Thor said as he patted Loki\u2019s shoulders.<br></p><p>Then, Thor opened the door. Loki looked in to find a crib, placed beside his king sized four poster bed, and a women sitting on the window seat, glaring outside the window as she swing her legs from side to side.</p><p>\u201cReally, a women? And a bloody crib? You know I don\u2019t want to court anyone else Thor! Not after her death!\u201d Loki said as he turned around to leave.\u00a0\u201cAnd what the hel is the crib for?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Thor chuckled.\u00a0\u201cNo brother, look.\u201d he said, turning him around.</p><p>Loki scoffed as he studied the women. she had H/L H/T H/C hair. She wore a golden dress, the same one Y/N wore the\u2026the day she died.</p><p>She also had a golden flower crown, the same one he gave Y/N, and the same one she wore on their wedding day\u2026</p><p>\u201cWhat is the meaning of this broth-\u201d Loki stopped once her face turned towards him, and their eyes met.</p><p>Familiar E/C eyes, S/C skin and a F/S face, and most importantly, her smile\u2026</p><p>\u201cY\u2026Y-Y/N?\u201d Loki mumbled in disbelief? His hands shaking as the grip of the flower bouquet tightened.\u00a0<br></p><p>That smile he had had for a year now, that smile that haunted his dreams, plastered itself on her lips as she ran towards him.</p><p>She hands wrapped them around Loki\u2019s neck. He however did not hug back for he couldn\u2019t believe what was happening.</p><p>He didn\u2019t move an inch, he felt like his body was made of stones, he felt like his feet are stuck to the ground. His mind was blank in shock.</p><p>\u201cLoki?\u201d Y/N said as she pulled away, confused and worried on why he didn\u2019t hug her back.\u00a0\u201cAre you okay?\u201d she asked, cupping his cheeks.<br></p><p>And when the message was processed, his mind awoke from it\u2019s blank state, his rock like stiff body softened, and his legs grew weak, as his eyes brimmed with long held tears, that are now filled with only happiness and joy.</p><p>\u201cY/N\u2026\u201d he whispered, the bouquet of roses falling down to the floor as he bought her into his embrace, holding her close as if she would disappear again if he let go.<br></p><p>Y/N happily wrapped her arms around his neck as she held him tight, running her hands through his hair as she felt warm tears fall onto her bare shoulder.</p><p>A few of her own tears fell down, she may have not been there to experience Loki\u2019s state after her supposed death, but she knew enough to know what his state would have been.</p><p>\u201cH-How?\u201d he asked as he pulled away, his arms still wrapped around her waist.<br></p><p>\u201cYour brother, Stephan Strange and the Avengers traveled back in time and bought me here. They explained everything to me. I\u2019m sorry I put you through all that.\u201d<br></p><p>Loki shook his head as he placed his forehead over yours.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo, my love. You have done nothing wrong but repair my broken heart.\u201d he said as he placed his lips over yours, kissing you, tasting your sweet lips as he savored it.<br></p><p>\u201cAnd\u2026\u201d he said pulling away as his hand rubbed over your now flat belly. He felt sadness take over him\u2026his son didn\u2019t make it after all\u2026<br></p><p>Y/N sighed as she placed her hands over his.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it Loki, his safe.\u201d you said, a smile placing it self over your lips.<br></p><p>\u201cI know love. As you said, he must be the sweetest angel up there.\u201d Loki said, still holding you close as his forehead was pressed against yours.<br></p><p>You giggled.\u00a0\u201cThat is not what I mean\u2019t\u201d you said as you took his hand in your, taking him towards the crib.</p><p>His eyes lit up in realization as more tears poured out of his eyes. You pulled him towards the crib as now he stood in front of it, his eyes landing on a cute little bundle wrapped in silky green sheets.</p><p>\u201cHe was born last night. S/N Lokison\u2026\u201d you said, giggling at Loki\u2019s reaction.<br></p><p>He looked down and S/N in awe.</p><p>Loki picked him up and held your son close, chuckling in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cS/N\u2026S/N Lokison\u2026my very own son\u2026\u201d he mumbled as he rocked him back and forth, swinging from side to side.<br></p><p>\u201cThis surely is some dream, everything is so unreal.\u201d he mumbled, tears pouring out of his eyes as he held his finger out, S/N grabbed it as he smiled up at his father.<br></p><p>\u201cYet so real.\u201d you added.\u00a0<br></p><p>Loki\u2019s eyes softened as he pulled you close by the hips, holding his son at the other.</p><p>\u201cI love you Y/N, and I love you S/N\u2026\u201d he said, too overwhelmed to ever look at them as he closed his eyes.<br></p><p>\u201cAnd we love you too\u2026we will never leave you again.\u201d you said, snuggling closer to him.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cit\u2019s a beautiful dream, that I don\u2019t have to wake up, that will never fade away into a blur. It\u2019s a real beautiful dream\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>He forgot about everything, his he did in the past, what he is known to be, what he really is. All that mattered to him was his wife and son, who he will love and protect until his last breath is taken.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Too much fluff, I know xD But I hope ya\u2019ll enjoyed it.\u00a0</b></p>",

Why!?&rdquo; he sobbed.</p><p>&ldquo;I-I-I aaaammmm soooo sorrry&hellip;&rdquo;<br /></p><p>He didn&rsquo;t say another word as he buried his head into your chest, continuing to sob as he rubbed your belly.</p><p>&ldquo;How could they&hellip;? How could they take you two away from me&hellip;?&nbsp;&ldquo; he sobbed.<br /></p><p>You held him closer to you, kissing his head.</p><p>You knew there was a few more minutes left. You shook his form to grab his attention.</p><p>&ldquo;W-what i-is it my lovely queen?&rdquo; he tried so hard not to sob again, yet it was obvious he is failing,&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;C-c-can youuu taaaake m-m-me toooo seee theee starssss, onnneee laaaast t-t-time?&rdquo; you asked.</p><p><b>(Translation: Can you take me to see the stars one last time?)</b></p><p>He nodded.&nbsp;&ldquo;Anything for you, my sweet Y/N&hellip;&rdquo; he let out a held back sob as he sat up, picking you up bridal style as he carefully carried you across the room, all the way over to the window seat.</p><p>He laid you down as he opened the window. He then sat down, bringing you to lay across his lap as he held you close, both staring out at the twinkling stars.</p><p>&ldquo;H-heee m-m-mussst beee thee swwee-test angel uuup t-t-there.&rdquo; you said, your breathing rate decreasing.</p><p><b>(Translation: He must be the sweetest angel up there.)</b></p><p>&ldquo;Indeed&hellip;&rdquo; Loki said, holding back the sobs, but instead letting tears out since it pricked his already red eyes.<br /></p><p>He held you close, cradling your head in his hands&hellip;knowing your only seconds away from joining those stars above&hellip;and his and your little miracle that never got to see the world&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>He heard you whimper, which made him sob, he knew the time has come.</p><p>&ldquo;Let go my love.

He couldn&rsquo;t believe you were gone. All because of his brother and stupid mortal friends&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;I-I love you sooo muuuch Y/N. I will never forget you and all the things you have done for me.&rdquo; he sobbed as he placed a kiss on your finger, right above your wedding ring, &ldquo;I love you&hellip;.and I will complete our mission, I will take over Midgard, just for you.&rdquo; he promised you before kissing your cold lips one more time.<br /></p><p><br /></p><p>-</p><p><br /></p><p>That was months ago. A memory that never left Loki&rsquo;s mind, even when he is trapped inside a Hulk-proof glass prison in the the helicare.</p><p>He paced back and forth, thinking about you&hellip;he never stopped thinking about you&hellip;</p><p>He felt a presence behind him. A smirk formed on his lips, hiding the sadness that his heart held onto.</p><figure><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/440a4c15518cd2ccaa51c7c4899c9db3/tumblr_inline_pfebg73ik61w4rrdw_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><b>(WHY YOU DO THIS TO ME LOKI!?!?!?!?!?!?!? ^^^^)</b></p><p>&ldquo;A very few people could sneak up on me, agent Romanoff.&rdquo; he said as he walked over to the glass wall of the prison, where the black widow stood.<br /></p><p>He was disgusted, even seen her in front of him. She is the reason that his loving innocent sweet wife, and his unborn son are dead.</p><p>&ldquo;Release him.&rdquo; was all she said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I am afraid I do not know what you mean.&rdquo; he said, the smirk still not leaving his lips.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Agent Barton. I want you to let him go&hellip;I know you took over his mind, and he is serving you as your slave&hellip;&rdquo; she said. folding her arms over her chest.</p><p>Loki chuckled.&nbsp;&ldquo;And why do you care?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s my friend Loki.&rdquo; Natasha said, she looked at him with anger.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I think it is more than that, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;Just release him.&rdquo; Natasha said.<br /></p><p>Loki chuckled once again.&nbsp;&ldquo;<i>Is this love</i>, agent Romanoff?&rdquo;<b> (GIF ABOVE)</b></p><p>Natasha nodded.&nbsp;&ldquo;Maybe it is&hellip;&rdquo; she looked at him, angrily.</p><p>Loki chuckled, darkly and angrily this time.</p><p>&ldquo;So you do know what love is then, hmmm? If you do, then why would you kill her?&rdquo; Loki asked, his smirk replaced with a angry furrow of his brows.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You mean your apprentice? Well if I didn&rsquo;t she could have helped you. And I cannot let that happen. Besides, I highly doubt she was willing to work for you. Poor girl, must have just been your fuck toy.&rdquo; Natasha said.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>At this, Loki felt anger bubble inside him. He slammed his fist into the glass wall, making Natasha jump and yelp in surprise.</p><p>&ldquo;How dare you! how dare you call her my fuck toy, you mewling quim! She is more than that. She was my wife, the love of my life. She was innocent, she would never hurt anyone. All she wanted to do was bring me back home. But then, you killed her.&rdquo; he spat at her bitterly.<br /></p><p>Natasha back away, terrified.</p><p>&ldquo;And never forget where you stabbed her! You stabbed her on her stomach, the very area where my son was growing!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Natasha looked at him, surprised.</p><p>&ldquo;And you call your selves heroes&hellip;pity.&rdquo; he said, removing his fists from the glass.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Pity indeed. Release Clint.&rdquo; she said, she didn&rsquo;t know how to respond to Loki. She was too shocked.<br /></p><p>Natasha had to admit, that Y/N looked innocent when she killed her. She remembers how she begged her to spare her life and how she mentioned she was innocent, yet Natasha didn&rsquo;t care. She stabbed her anyways.</p><p>Loki looked at her with even more disgust.</p><p>&ldquo;No, I will not! When I get out of this cell and return to my lair, I will kill agent Barton, and I will have you watch it as I plunge my scepter through his stomach!&rdquo; he spat at her.&nbsp;&ldquo;Just like how you did to my wife!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Natasha didn&rsquo;t want to hear anymore, she left to tell the others about what he said, leaving Loki an angry and crying mess.</p><p><br /></p><p>-</p><p><br /></p><p>In Odin&rsquo;s order, Loki had to stay with the Avengers and help them in missions.</p><p>And of course he despised it. Living with the very people who defeated him months ago as shameful as it sounds, and the women who killed his wife and child.</p><p>Thor was joyed about it though, but the rest, not so much.</p><p>Yet they felt bad for Loki. After Natasha told them, they, surprisingly, felt very bad for the god of mischief.</p><p>But they also knew Loki was innocent, and Thanos was behind it.</p><p>&ldquo;Oof, I feel bad for reindeer games.&rdquo; Tony said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Surprisingly, me too.&rdquo; Clint said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I feel guilty to be honest. I mean I am the one who killed his wife.&rdquo; Natasha said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;We also attacked her Natasha, your not the only one.&rdquo; Steve said.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I met Y/N before, she was indeed a sweet girl. And she has changed Loki in so many ways, positive ones of course. I have never seen him be sweet, and kind, and loving to another. Maybe if she was still alive, Loki could have been that person with us, and with me! He could be our good friend as well.&rdquo; Thor said, a bit excitedly.&nbsp;</p><p>So&hellip;by Thor&rsquo;s request, and Tony&rsquo;s idea, they prepared a surprise that they hope will change Loki, for the better.</p><p>&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon brother, just a few more steps.&rdquo; Thor said. His large hands covering Loki&rsquo;s eyes as he walked him over to the door of his room.</p><p>&ldquo;Ugh! I swear Thor, that if this surprise is useless, then I will-&rdquo;&nbsp;&ldquo;Do not worry brother, I am pretty sure you will love it.&rdquo; Thor cut Loki off.<br /></p><p>Once Thor removed his hands away from Loki&rsquo;s eyes, he found himself to be standing in front of <i>his</i> own room.</p><p>&ldquo;What the hel Thor? This is my surprise!?&rdquo; Loki mumbled angrily.&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh how lovely! my very own door! Thanks Thor! I always wanted one!&rdquo; Loki said angrily and sarcastically .<br /></p><p>Thor just chuckled as he shoved a bouquet of white and pink roses into Loki&rsquo;s hand.</p><p>&ldquo;The surprise is inside brother.&rdquo; Thor said as he patted Loki&rsquo;s shoulders.<br /></p><p>Then, Thor opened the door. Loki looked in to find a crib, placed beside his king sized four poster bed, and a women sitting on the window seat, glaring outside the window as she swing her legs from side to side.</p><p>&ldquo;Really, a women? And a bloody crib? You know I don&rsquo;t want to court anyone else Thor! Not after her death!&rdquo; Loki said as he turned around to leave.&nbsp;&ldquo;And what the hel is the crib for?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Thor chuckled.&nbsp;&ldquo;No brother, look.&rdquo; he said, turning him around.</p><p>Loki scoffed as he studied the women. she had H/L H/T H/C hair. She wore a golden dress, the same one Y/N wore the&hellip;the day she died.</p><p>She also had a golden flower crown, the same one he gave Y/N, and the same one she wore on their wedding day&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;What is the meaning of this broth-&rdquo; Loki stopped once her face turned towards him, and their eyes met.</p><p>Familiar E/C eyes, S/C skin and a F/S face, and most importantly, her smile&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;Y&hellip;Y-Y/N?&rdquo; Loki mumbled in disbelief? His hands shaking as the grip of the flower bouquet tightened.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>That smile he had had for a year now, that smile that haunted his dreams, plastered itself on her lips as she ran towards him.</p><p>She hands wrapped them around Loki&rsquo;s neck. He however did not hug back for he couldn&rsquo;t believe what was happening.</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t move an inch, he felt like his body was made of stones, he felt like his feet are stuck to the ground. His mind was blank in shock.</p><p>&ldquo;Loki?&rdquo; Y/N said as she pulled away, confused and worried on why he didn&rsquo;t hug her back.&nbsp;&ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; she asked, cupping his cheeks.<br /></p><p>And when the message was processed, his mind awoke from it&rsquo;s blank state, his rock like stiff body softened, and his legs grew weak, as his eyes brimmed with long held tears, that are now filled with only happiness and joy.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N&hellip;&rdquo; he whispered, the bouquet of roses falling down to the floor as he bought her into his embrace, holding her close as if she would disappear again if he let go.<br /></p><p>Y/N happily wrapped her arms around his neck as she held him tight, running her hands through his hair as she felt warm tears fall onto her bare shoulder.</p><p>A few of her own tears fell down, she may have not been there to experience Loki&rsquo;s state after her supposed death, but she knew enough to know what his state would have been.</p><p>&ldquo;H-How?&rdquo; he asked as he pulled away, his arms still wrapped around her waist.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Your brother, Stephan Strange and the Avengers traveled back in time and bought me here. They explained everything to me. I&rsquo;m sorry I put you through all that.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Loki shook his head as he placed his forehead over yours.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;No, my love. You have done nothing wrong but repair my broken heart.&rdquo; he said as he placed his lips over yours, kissing you, tasting your sweet lips as he savored it.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;And&hellip;&rdquo; he said pulling away as his hand rubbed over your now flat belly. He felt sadness take over him&hellip;his son didn&rsquo;t make it after all&hellip;<br /></p><p>Y/N sighed as she placed her hands over his.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it Loki, his safe.&rdquo; you said, a smile placing it self over your lips.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I know love. As you said, he must be the sweetest angel up there.&rdquo; Loki said, still holding you close as his forehead was pressed against yours.<br /></p><p>You giggled.&nbsp;&ldquo;That is not what I mean&rsquo;t&rdquo; you said as you took his hand in your, taking him towards the crib.</p><p>His eyes lit up in realization as more tears poured out of his eyes. You pulled him towards the crib as now he stood in front of it, his eyes landing on a cute little bundle wrapped in silky green sheets.</p><p>&ldquo;He was born last night. S/N Lokison&hellip;&rdquo; you said, giggling at Loki&rsquo;s reaction.<br /></p><p>He looked down and S/N in awe.</p><p>Loki picked him up and held your son close, chuckling in disbelief.</p><p>&ldquo;S/N&hellip;S/N Lokison&hellip;my very own son&hellip;&rdquo; he mumbled as he rocked him back and forth, swinging from side to side.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;This surely is some dream, everything is so unreal.&rdquo; he mumbled, tears pouring out of his eyes as he held his finger out, S/N grabbed it as he smiled up at his father.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yet so real.&rdquo; you added.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Loki&rsquo;s eyes softened as he pulled you close by the hips, holding his son at the other.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you Y/N, and I love you S/N&hellip;&rdquo; he said, too overwhelmed to ever look at them as he closed his eyes.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;And we love you too&hellip;we will never leave you again.&rdquo; you said, snuggling closer to him.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;it&rsquo;s a beautiful dream, that I don&rsquo;t have to wake up, that will never fade away into a blur. It&rsquo;s a real beautiful dream&hellip;&rdquo;<br /></p><p>He forgot about everything, his he did in the past, what he is known to be, what he really is. All that mattered to him was his wife and son, who he will love and protect until his last breath is taken.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>Too much fluff, I know xD But I hope ya&rsquo;ll enjoyed it.&nbsp;</b></p>",
