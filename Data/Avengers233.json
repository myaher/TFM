I may or may not be able to get this linked to my masterlist tonight.</p><p>I love what this chapter communicates more than I love my writing for it.</p><p>Feedback craved as always!</p><p><b>Word count:</b>\u00a01655</p><p><b>Warnings: </b>Threats, more spider mentions, some cute Bucky fluff and good feels</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you shot her.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>I</i> can\u2019t believe\nyou\u2019re having a funeral for the nasty thing,\u201d Clint scoffed as you carefully\nmaneuvered the giant tarantula with an arrow through its head into a cardboard\nbox. \u201cIt\u2019s a spider. A giant, hairy, bird-eating spider. Also, I don\u2019t want\nthat arrow back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA spider that did absolutely nothing to hurt you,\u201d you\ncountered, folding the box closed with the arrow still inside. \u201cNow where are\nthe other four?\u201d</p><p>Clint paled and collapsed against the wall. \u201cThere are four\nmore?\u201d</p><p>You rolled your eyes at him. \u201cOf course not, but you shot\nGenevieve and released hundreds of spiders into Bucky\u2019s room. If you think I\u2019m\ndone messing with you, you\u2019ve got another thing coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I hate you,\u201d Clint muttered. \u201cAnd who the hell\nnames a foot-long spider Genevieve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you really going to have a funeral for that thing?\u201d\nBucky asked as you exited Clint\u2019s room.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d you grinned. \u201cI figured I\u2019d do it Viking style;\nfloat the box in Tony\u2019s bathtub and light it on fire.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and laughed. \u201cLife with you around will\nnever be boring, will it? Why Tony\u2019s tub?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife\u2019s too short to be boring.\u201d You grabbed his flesh hand\nwith your metal one. \u201cTony\u2019s got the biggest tub in the tower. Now come on! I\nwant to get this thing lit on fire before he gets back.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna have to replace my bathtub.\u201d</p><p>You laughed at Tony\u2019s horrified look and passed Bucky a paper\nplate piled high with five slices of pizza. It was dinner time and the whole\nteam was perched in various places around the common room divvying up the\ncontents of the numerous Pizza Hut boxes. You had situated yourself on the arm\nrest of the couch next to Bucky.</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, Stark, it\u2019s not like the tub got damaged. The\nbox just burned through before Genevieve caught fire and she sank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt touched my tub,\u201d he muttered, shaking his head. \u201cI can\nnever step foot in it again. I liked that bathtub.\u201d He shot Bucky a glare. \u201cI\u2019m\nholding you responsible for this. You\u2019re the one who brought her here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay with that,\u201d Bucky agreed around a mouthful of\npizza. \u201cI like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019ve got it bad? It was in my room,\u201d Clint\ncomplained. \u201cMy<i> room</i>. I\u2019ll never be\nable to sleep again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you should all stop whining and take to heart the\nobvious lesson that is to be learned here,\u201d Steve interjected with a grin.\n\u201cMess with Bucky and Y/N will slaughter you.\u201d</p><p>You swallowed your bite of pizza and threw your arm around\nyour soulmate. \u201cWhat can I say? I\u2019m fiercely protective.\u201d</p><p>Bucky could practically feel himself melting into the couch\nas the evening went on. He\u2019d never had anyone be protective of him in the way\nyou were. Yes, Steve had always stood up for him, but that was different. Bucky\nhad spent their childhood helping Steve out of the trouble he always got\nhimself into. But here you were, arguably someone he should protect more than he\never had anyone else, and the moment anyone crossed him even as a prank you\nwere defending him. It was a strange feeling, but Bucky found he very much\nliked it.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy strawberry?\u201d</p><p>Bucky licked at a drip trying to make its way down his cone\nand laughed at your expression. \u201cIt\u2019s a light and happy flavor that reminds me\nof being a kid. It\u2019s not as strong as chocolate or as sweet as vanilla, and\nthose were pretty much the only three flavors that were easy to come by back\nthen. Why are you so surprised, Miss Cookie Dough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just didn\u2019t expect strawberry to be your favorite\nflavor.\u201d You shook your head. \u201cAlthough now that I think about it, it makes\nperfect sense. It suits you in a way.\u201d</p><p>The two of you were taking advantage of your time off work\nto go on your first official date. When you\u2019d learned Bucky hadn\u2019t been to a\nmovie since the 40s you had dragged him to your favorite theater. His eyes had\ngone huge at the food selection available at the snack bar, and you\u2019d had to\nremind him the prices had gone up to keep him from buying one of everything.\nHe\u2019d settled on a popcorn to share with you and a soda, while you got an Icee.\nAfter the movie, the two of you had stopped by a Cold Stone and each gotten a cone\nwith your favorite flavors.</p><p>You were now eating them while strolling through the city,\nyour flesh hand entwined in his metal one. It had taken some work to convince\nhim he didn\u2019t need to completely cover his metal arm in public, but he\u2019d\nfinally agreed as long as yours was visible as well. The two of you were in\nlong-sleeve shirts, but Bucky wasn\u2019t wearing his glove, and your heart swelled\nwith pride when you saw him enjoying himself without thinking about his arm.</p><p>\u201cWhy is cookie dough your favorite?\u201d</p><p>You pulled yourself out of your Bucky-centric reverie and\nsmiled at him. \u201cIce cream and raw cookie dough are the two best sweet foods in\nexistence. Putting them together was a stroke of genius. Who am I to turn down\ngenius?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou turned down Tony\u2019s idea for pizza with a bacon-stuffed\ncrust,\u201d he teased. \u201cI thought that was pretty genius.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if your goal is death by heart attack,\u201d you laughed,\nbumping your shoulder against his.</p><p>A movement to your left caught Bucky\u2019s eye and had him\npulling you closer. You had already been aware of the paparazzo since you had\nrecognized him, but since the man had just spotted the two of you, Bucky\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m\nunder surveillance\u201d radar went off.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Buck,\u201d you whispered, rubbing the back of his\nhand with your thumb. \u201cIt\u2019s just a photographer.

It was dinner time and the whole\nteam was perched in various places around the common room divvying up the\ncontents of the numerous Pizza Hut boxes. You had situated yourself on the arm\nrest of the couch next to Bucky.</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, Stark, it\u2019s not like the tub got damaged. The\nbox just burned through before Genevieve caught fire and she sank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt touched my tub,\u201d he muttered, shaking his head. \u201cI can\nnever step foot in it again. I liked that bathtub.\u201d He shot Bucky a glare. \u201cI\u2019m\nholding you responsible for this. You\u2019re the one who brought her here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay with that,\u201d Bucky agreed around a mouthful of\npizza. \u201cI like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019ve got it bad? It was in my room,\u201d Clint\ncomplained. \u201cMy<i> room</i>. I\u2019ll never be\nable to sleep again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you should all stop whining and take to heart the\nobvious lesson that is to be learned here,\u201d Steve interjected with a grin.\n\u201cMess with Bucky and Y/N will slaughter you.\u201d</p><p>You swallowed your bite of pizza and threw your arm around\nyour soulmate. \u201cWhat can I say? I\u2019m fiercely protective.\u201d</p><p>Bucky could practically feel himself melting into the couch\nas the evening went on. He\u2019d never had anyone be protective of him in the way\nyou were. Yes, Steve had always stood up for him, but that was different. Bucky\nhad spent their childhood helping Steve out of the trouble he always got\nhimself into. But here you were, arguably someone he should protect more than he\never had anyone else, and the moment anyone crossed him even as a prank you\nwere defending him. It was a strange feeling, but Bucky found he very much\nliked it.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy strawberry?\u201d</p><p>Bucky licked at a drip trying to make its way down his cone\nand laughed at your expression. \u201cIt\u2019s a light and happy flavor that reminds me\nof being a kid. It\u2019s not as strong as chocolate or as sweet as vanilla, and\nthose were pretty much the only three flavors that were easy to come by back\nthen. Why are you so surprised, Miss Cookie Dough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just didn\u2019t expect strawberry to be your favorite\nflavor.\u201d You shook your head. \u201cAlthough now that I think about it, it makes\nperfect sense. It suits you in a way.\u201d</p><p>The two of you were taking advantage of your time off work\nto go on your first official date. When you\u2019d learned Bucky hadn\u2019t been to a\nmovie since the 40s you had dragged him to your favorite theater. His eyes had\ngone huge at the food selection available at the snack bar, and you\u2019d had to\nremind him the prices had gone up to keep him from buying one of everything.\nHe\u2019d settled on a popcorn to share with you and a soda, while you got an Icee.\nAfter the movie, the two of you had stopped by a Cold Stone and each gotten a cone\nwith your favorite flavors.</p><p>You were now eating them while strolling through the city,\nyour flesh hand entwined in his metal one. It had taken some work to convince\nhim he didn\u2019t need to completely cover his metal arm in public, but he\u2019d\nfinally agreed as long as yours was visible as well. The two of you were in\nlong-sleeve shirts, but Bucky wasn\u2019t wearing his glove, and your heart swelled\nwith pride when you saw him enjoying himself without thinking about his arm.</p><p>\u201cWhy is cookie dough your favorite?\u201d</p><p>You pulled yourself out of your Bucky-centric reverie and\nsmiled at him. \u201cIce cream and raw cookie dough are the two best sweet foods in\nexistence. Putting them together was a stroke of genius. Who am I to turn down\ngenius?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou turned down Tony\u2019s idea for pizza with a bacon-stuffed\ncrust,\u201d he teased. \u201cI thought that was pretty genius.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if your goal is death by heart attack,\u201d you laughed,\nbumping your shoulder against his.</p><p>A movement to your left caught Bucky\u2019s eye and had him\npulling you closer. You had already been aware of the paparazzo since you had\nrecognized him, but since the man had just spotted the two of you, Bucky\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m\nunder surveillance\u201d radar went off.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Buck,\u201d you whispered, rubbing the back of his\nhand with your thumb. \u201cIt\u2019s just a photographer. He might take some pictures,\nbut he won\u2019t try to hurt either of us.\u201d</p><p>Bucky nodded to confirm he\u2019d heard you, but he didn\u2019t relax.\nA passerby would probably just see two people eating ice cream, but you could\ntell his nerves were on edge.</p><p>The paparazzo did end up taking a few pictures from a\ndistance, but didn\u2019t follow you as you lead Bucky towards the park where you\nhad met.

You\u2019re the one who brought her here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay with that,\u201d Bucky agreed around a mouthful of\npizza. \u201cI like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019ve got it bad? It was in my room,\u201d Clint\ncomplained. \u201cMy<i> room</i>. I\u2019ll never be\nable to sleep again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you should all stop whining and take to heart the\nobvious lesson that is to be learned here,\u201d Steve interjected with a grin.\n\u201cMess with Bucky and Y/N will slaughter you.\u201d</p><p>You swallowed your bite of pizza and threw your arm around\nyour soulmate. \u201cWhat can I say? I\u2019m fiercely protective.\u201d</p><p>Bucky could practically feel himself melting into the couch\nas the evening went on. He\u2019d never had anyone be protective of him in the way\nyou were. Yes, Steve had always stood up for him, but that was different. Bucky\nhad spent their childhood helping Steve out of the trouble he always got\nhimself into. But here you were, arguably someone he should protect more than he\never had anyone else, and the moment anyone crossed him even as a prank you\nwere defending him. It was a strange feeling, but Bucky found he very much\nliked it.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy strawberry?\u201d</p><p>Bucky licked at a drip trying to make its way down his cone\nand laughed at your expression. \u201cIt\u2019s a light and happy flavor that reminds me\nof being a kid. It\u2019s not as strong as chocolate or as sweet as vanilla, and\nthose were pretty much the only three flavors that were easy to come by back\nthen. Why are you so surprised, Miss Cookie Dough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just didn\u2019t expect strawberry to be your favorite\nflavor.\u201d You shook your head. \u201cAlthough now that I think about it, it makes\nperfect sense. It suits you in a way.\u201d</p><p>The two of you were taking advantage of your time off work\nto go on your first official date. When you\u2019d learned Bucky hadn\u2019t been to a\nmovie since the 40s you had dragged him to your favorite theater. His eyes had\ngone huge at the food selection available at the snack bar, and you\u2019d had to\nremind him the prices had gone up to keep him from buying one of everything.\nHe\u2019d settled on a popcorn to share with you and a soda, while you got an Icee.\nAfter the movie, the two of you had stopped by a Cold Stone and each gotten a cone\nwith your favorite flavors.</p><p>You were now eating them while strolling through the city,\nyour flesh hand entwined in his metal one. It had taken some work to convince\nhim he didn\u2019t need to completely cover his metal arm in public, but he\u2019d\nfinally agreed as long as yours was visible as well. The two of you were in\nlong-sleeve shirts, but Bucky wasn\u2019t wearing his glove, and your heart swelled\nwith pride when you saw him enjoying himself without thinking about his arm.</p><p>\u201cWhy is cookie dough your favorite?\u201d</p><p>You pulled yourself out of your Bucky-centric reverie and\nsmiled at him. \u201cIce cream and raw cookie dough are the two best sweet foods in\nexistence. Putting them together was a stroke of genius. Who am I to turn down\ngenius?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou turned down Tony\u2019s idea for pizza with a bacon-stuffed\ncrust,\u201d he teased. \u201cI thought that was pretty genius.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if your goal is death by heart attack,\u201d you laughed,\nbumping your shoulder against his.</p><p>A movement to your left caught Bucky\u2019s eye and had him\npulling you closer. You had already been aware of the paparazzo since you had\nrecognized him, but since the man had just spotted the two of you, Bucky\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m\nunder surveillance\u201d radar went off.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Buck,\u201d you whispered, rubbing the back of his\nhand with your thumb. \u201cIt\u2019s just a photographer. He might take some pictures,\nbut he won\u2019t try to hurt either of us.\u201d</p><p>Bucky nodded to confirm he\u2019d heard you, but he didn\u2019t relax.\nA passerby would probably just see two people eating ice cream, but you could\ntell his nerves were on edge.</p><p>The paparazzo did end up taking a few pictures from a\ndistance, but didn\u2019t follow you as you lead Bucky towards the park where you\nhad met. The further from him you got, the more Bucky relaxed, until your\nconversation was interrupted by a familiar and unwelcome voice.</p><p>\u201cSergeant Barnes, Ms. Y/L/N, may I have a word with the two\nof you? Melissa Renner, <i>Public </i>Magazine.\u201d</p><p>The two of you turned to face her and you eyed her coolly, a\nfake smile plastered on your face.</p><p>\u201cAh, yes, the woman who called my soulmate a brainwashed\nkiller at the conference last Saturday,\u201d you observed dryly. \u201cWhat can we do\nfor you, Ms. Renner?\u201d You pulled Bucky closer to you, wrapping your arm around his\nwaist protectively, a gesture neither he nor the reporter missed.</p><p>\u201cI was merely stating historical facts. I apologize if my\nphrasing offended you.\u201d She continued on undeterred and turned to Bucky.\n\u201cEveryone was surprised when the announcement was made that you had found your\nsoulmate. It\u2019s been four days and this is the first time the two of you have\nbeen seen out together since then. What\u2019s been happening in the world of the\nnewly paired?\u201d</p><p>You could feel Bucky\u2019s tension radiating off of him even as\nyou felt in internally; you suspected he could also feel your anger.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been getting to know each other,\u201d he replied, the\nstrain in his voice nearly imperceptible. </p><p>Melissa had her notepad out and was jotting something down\nin shorthand. \u201cAnd how would you describe her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe perfect,\u201d he said softly, relaxing slightly at the\ntopic he enjoyed and smiling down at you. \u201cEverything about her is beautiful\nand perfect. She\u2019s more than I could ever hope for or deserve.\u201d</p><p>You caught a glint in the reporter\u2019s eye and held up your\nhand to stop her as she opened her mouth.</p><p>\u201cNo, you will not follow that line of questioning.\u201d You\nturned to look up at Bucky and cupped his cheek in your hand. \u201cWe\u2019ve already\nbeen over this, babe. You didn\u2019t do anything to not deserve me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you consider being a Hydra assassin nothing?\u201d</p><p>And there it was, the triumphant sound in her voice that\nproved she thought she\u2019d just found the best dirt she could on you. You turned\nto her and her smile faltered when she saw the look in your eyes.</p><p>\u201cWho we are should be measured by the choices we make.\u201d Your\nvoice was even and light, but there was an edge to it that no one could miss.\n\u201cSomeone who is constantly being brainwashed, tortured, and programmed does not\nhave a choice. Since his ability to choose was given back to him, Bucky has\nbeen the sweetest, most gentle man I\u2019ve ever met. When given a choice, he does\nnot choose to be a killer, which means he is not a killer. If only we all were\nas careful when given a choice.\u201d You cocked you head and smiled sweetly. \u201cFor\nexample: Bayside hotel, room 324. Ring any bells?\u201d</p><p>Melissa paled.</p><p>\u201cI thought it might.\u201d You grabbed Bucky\u2019s hand again and\nstarted to pull him away. \u201cReporters aren\u2019t the only ones who know how to find\ndirt, you know. If you want to start a smear campaign you\u2019d better be damn sure\nit\u2019s worth what it will cost you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoll,\u201d Bucky asked bewildered as the two of you walked\naway, \u201cwhat was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d you cautioned. \u201cI told you\nI\u2019m protective.\u201d</p><p>Bucky thought about that interaction long after the two of\nyou arrived back at the tower. He decided that even if you were the kindest\nwoman he\u2019d ever met, your full anger was something he never wanted to see.</p>",
