        "body": "<p>Bc I saw some cool art recently and&hellip;.. pirate au\u2019s, a m I right?</p><hr><p>\u201cAnd so we meet again, Commodore Rogers. Seems you just can\u2019t seem to stay away.\u201d<br/></p><p>Steve folded his arms, trying to make sure he seemed unamused.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t flatter yourself,\u201d he told the man in front of him gruffly,\u00a0\u201cyou asked for a meal with me as your last request. I\u2019m just complying to a dying man\u2019s wish.\u201d</p><p>Rather than look even remotely afraid by that, however, Tony just laughed. Nothing seemed to faze that damn pirate- least of all Steve. Usually his Commodore&rsquo;s Uniform garnered a little more respect.\u00a0Then again, he and Tony had been doing this for a while by now. The fear had probably worn off a little. There was only so many times Steve could threaten to throw him overboard before the words became somewhat emptier. Not that they\u2019d held any promise the first time either, but still.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDid you miss me while I was away?\u201d Tony asked, fingers brushing over the tablecloth as he moved forward. He\u2019d been stripped of his flashy red coat, his various stashes of weapons and even his hat- but his rings still remained, framing his delicate fingers beautifully. Steve pretended like he didn\u2019t know that Tony would be able to escape from his cell with those rings alone- a feat he had seen happen once before. The man was a genius, and everything he wore held some sort of value.<br/></p><p>\u201cI much prefer you closer to home, yes,\u201d Steve told him with a shrug,\u00a0\u201cpreferably in a cell, nice and tucked away so that you can stop breaking the law.\u201d<br/></p><!-- more --><p>\u201cOh, Law Shmaw, they\u2019re stupid rules anyway,\u201d Tony waved a hand through the air noncommittally and then picked up an apple from the fruit bowl, throwing it up in the air,\u00a0\u201cyou know as well as I do that if I were not out there playing my little tricks, then you would be getting far more trouble from the urchins I feed with my spoils. Hunger <i>does</i> tend to inspire theft, you know.\u201d<br/></p><p>Steve looked at him for another moment with his stoic face, before finally breaking character and sighing in despair.\u00a0\u201cTony, you know one day you\u2019re going to get caught while I\u2019m not around to look out for you, and you\u2019re going to hang for your crimes.\u201d He leaned forward on the table, waiting until Tony got close enough to him and then snatching the apple out of the air as he tossed it.\u00a0\u201cI know as well as you do that what you\u2019re doing is a good thing, if a little morally ambiguous- but those rich people whose diamonds and gold you steal would most certainly not agree, and if they ever got their hands on you-\u201d</p><p>He was silenced by Tony\u2019s finger against his mouth. The man looked down at him fondly, his warm chocolate eyes twinkling in the evening light, and Steve\u2019s attention was drawn to the door on the other side of the room. The last thing he needed right now were for some guards to burst in and see how&hellip; <i>friendly </i>he was with their captive prisoner.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDoor\u2019s locked,\u201d Tony said swiftly, reading his mind, \u201cand for the record, the only reason I ever <i>let </i>them catch me in the first place is because I enjoy seeing you in this delicious uniform. If you weren\u2019t around, then believe me, they wouldn\u2019t have a hope in hell.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Steve watched him intently as Tony slid smoothly onto his lap, fingers curling around the edges of his jaw. It was always such a thrill, feeling the other man\u2019s touch. Their times together were so few and far between. Steve had no idea how it had even started- when they\u2019d first met, Steve had just been enlisted into the navy, fresh and bright at the bottom of the pile, and Tony was just beginning to cause problems at sea. He stole from rich transport ships and then distributed the wealth elsewhere, and his tracks were covered so well that barely anyone had ever seen him more than once.\u00a0</p><p>Except Steve, who, for some reason, Tony had seemed to take a shine to.\u00a0</p><p>Over the years, he\u2019d climbed up the ranks in the navy, working hard to catch pirates like Tony and stop them from terrorising the waters. His record was almost perfect- the only blip being Tony himself, and the sheer amount of times the man had managed to\u00a0\u2018escape\u2019 from his custody. The first few occasions had, admittedly, been Tony genuinely just getting the upper hand on him and then disappearing before Steve even had a chance to pursue. The others&hellip; well. Steve may have been a little less vigilant than he could have been, occasionally dropped some keys now and then, you know how it is.\u00a0</p><p>He knew it was a dangerous game to play. Conspiring with a known pirate would earn him a cell in prison at the very least, and everything he\u2019d worked so hard for would go down the drain in a single moment. But Steve still did it, every time Tony was nearby. Had done from the very start, when it had just been amused banter between the cop and the crook. And as Steve had come to know Tony better- as the banter had become laced with something else, something more dangerous than just Platonic affections- he\u2019d found himself feeling things for the pirate that were definitely, most certainly not even <i>remotely </i>appropriate. Like how much he wanted to take Tony\u2019s hand and kiss each knuckle, pull him away from the danger of being here, in the lion\u2019s den. Like how he wanted Tony for himself, all the time, rather than having to go without seeing him for months and then only get these hurried moments before Tony took off again, gone to help some other impoverished family by throwing stolen jewellery at them.\u00a0</p><p>He wanted so many things that he couldn\u2019t have. It was damn infuriating sometimes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking too much,\u201d Tony murmured, running his thumb over the lines on Steve\u2019s forehead and smoothing them out,\u00a0\u201cjust relax, darling.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cRelaxing is a little hard when a felon is sat on your lap and caressing your face,\u201d Steve responded dryly, raising an eyebrow.<br/></p><p>Tony just grinned, moving in closer and pressing his mouth into the skin under Steve\u2019s jaw.\u00a0\u201cI can imagine something else is a little hard right now, Commodore.\u201d He whispered, and then yelped in surprise as Steve tickled him in the ribs as punishment.\u00a0\u201cHey! That one wasn\u2019t my fault, you practically walked yourself right into it.\u201d</p><p>Steve just rolled his eyes and pressed his hands into Tony\u2019s slim waist, curling them possessively across the white fabric of his tunic. He moved his head back, turned it sideways and as Tony looked up, he leaned down and kissed him, hard and passionate. He\u2019d tried for so long to avoid that urge, but these days he didn\u2019t even bother. Tony\u2019s touch was addictive, and Steve was completely hooked.\u00a0</p><p>God. He was in love with a fucking pirate, of all people.\u00a0</p><p>Tony smiled against his mouth like he knew exactly what Steve was thinking and then kissed back, his hands framing Steve\u2019s face. A dozen bracelets fell down his forearms like a tinkling stream of metal and gold, and Steve tasted the faintest hint of strawberries from earlier- the fruit which he had been caught stealing and brought in for in the first place.</p><p>\u201cYou truly are like no one I\u2019ve ever met, Steve,\u201d Tony told him softly, his fingers slipping down Steve\u2019s neck, across his throat, over his collarbones. Steve watched Tony\u2019s eyes as they locked into his own, and couldn\u2019t resist leaning forward for another kiss.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI could say the same for you,\u201d he muttered,\u00a0\u201ca <i>good </i>pirate? Who takes from the rich and gives it back to the impoverished? I\u2019ve never heard of that before in my entire life.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Tony simply winked, and then shrugged nonchalantly. \u201cAll in a day\u2019s work, my Commodore.\u201d</p><p>He tried not to notice the way his heart clenched at the possessive endearment.\u00a0\u201cWhy do you do it?\u201d He asked, as he felt Tony\u2019s fingers slip under his tunic and find the chain to which his prison-key was attached.\u00a0\u201cWhy not just keep it and make yourself rich? You could do it. You\u2019ve proved well enough that we don\u2019t find you unless you want to be found.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s fingers paused, and then he looked over with a small tinkle of laughter. He had the most beautiful laugh that Steve had ever heard.\u00a0\u201cAnd where the hell would be the fun in that?\u201d He asked, tugging upward on the chain and then pulling it over Steve\u2019s head. He slipped it onto his own neck, where Steve took it and then carefully tucked it under the folds of his tunic, hiding it from sight. After that, his fingers lingered longingly against Tony\u2019s chest. He wanted to pull these clothes right off, laws and timings and imminent-prison-sentence be damned. It had been so long since they\u2019d last been able to be with one another like that, and Steve longed for it it like a physical weight was pushing on his sternum.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBe careful when you leave tonight,\u201d Steve told him, his arm slipping around Tony\u2019s waist and then settling on his back as Tony leaned into his neck once more, simply resting his head and relaxing this time,\u00a0\u201cRumlow is on duty, and he does not go gentle on prisoners.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cRumlow will not be seeing any prisoners today,\u201d Tony assured him,\u00a0\u201cRumlow will just be seeing an empty cell and a very large, very rude drawing of himself.\u201d<br/></p><p>Steve smiled at the mental image.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re going to get me killed one day,\u201d he declared,\u00a0\u201cand I hope when you do, you come and bust me out accordingly, or I\u2019m gonna be real pissed.\u201d</p><p>The huff of breath from Tony\u2019s laughter tickled on Steve\u2019s neck, and he shut his eyes for a second, just imagining what life would be like if he did, one day, just leave. Follow Tony onto his ship, meet his crew, live their life. It seemed like pirates had a lot more fun than the navy did, at any rate,\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSweetheart,\u201d Tony said,\u00a0\u201cif you <i>do</i> ever get sentenced to death for treason and conspiring with a pirate like myself-\u201d he paused to grin, swooping down and capturing Steve\u2019s mouth in another kiss.\u00a0\u201c -I promise I\u2019ll make it up to you in the form of a very large, very ostentatious engagement ring. I\u2019ve heard Captain Pierce has a rather fine one on his own finger right now, actually-\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cDo not steal that ring from Captain Pierce, Tony!\u201d Steve warned hurriedly,\u00a0\u201che loves that ring! He would drain the seven seas in search of that ring if you took it from him!\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t hear you, too busy plotting,\u201d Tony told him absently, turning around on his lap and then leaning forward to grab a plate filled with meat and vegetables,\u00a0\u201cyou should eat, Steve- you need energy for all the lying you\u2019re going to have to do to your superiors\n\n on my behalf later tonight.\u201d<br/></p><p>Steve shut his eyes and rested his head against the back of Tony\u2019s neck, letting himself despair about the situation that he\u2019d managed to find himself in. Treason, treachery, law-breaking, and all for one man.\u00a0</p><p>Oops.\u00a0</p><hr><p><b><a href=\"http://ko-fi.com/itsallavengers\" target=\"_blank\">like my work?

I\u2019ve heard Captain Pierce has a rather fine one on his own finger right now, actually-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDo not steal that ring from Captain Pierce, Tony!\u201d Steve warned hurriedly,\u00a0\u201che loves that ring! He would drain the seven seas in search of that ring if you took it from him!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t hear you, too busy plotting,\u201d Tony told him absently, turning around on his lap and then leaning forward to grab a plate filled with meat and vegetables,\u00a0\u201cyou should eat, Steve- you need energy for all the lying you\u2019re going to have to do to your superiors\n\n on my behalf later tonight.\u201d<br></p><p>Steve shut his eyes and rested his head against the back of Tony\u2019s neck, letting himself despair about the situation that he\u2019d managed to find himself in. Treason, treachery, law-breaking, and all for one man.\u00a0</p><p>Oops.\u00a0</p><hr><p><b><a href=\"http://ko-fi.com/itsallavengers\" target=\"_blank\">like my work?

Seems you just can\u2019t seem to stay away.\u201d<br></p><p>Steve folded his arms, trying to make sure he seemed unamused.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t flatter yourself,\u201d he told the man in front of him gruffly,\u00a0\u201cyou asked for a meal with me as your last request. I\u2019m just complying to a dying man\u2019s wish.\u201d</p><p>Rather than look even remotely afraid by that, however, Tony just laughed. Nothing seemed to faze that damn pirate- least of all Steve. Usually his Commodore\u2019s Uniform garnered a little more respect.\u00a0Then again, he and Tony had been doing this for a while by now. The fear had probably worn off a little. There was only so many times Steve could threaten to throw him overboard before the words became somewhat emptier. Not that they\u2019d held any promise the first time either, but still.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDid you miss me while I was away?\u201d Tony asked, fingers brushing over the tablecloth as he moved forward. He\u2019d been stripped of his flashy red coat, his various stashes of weapons and even his hat- but his rings still remained, framing his delicate fingers beautifully. Steve pretended like he didn\u2019t know that Tony would be able to escape from his cell with those rings alone- a feat he had seen happen once before. The man was a genius, and everything he wore held some sort of value.<br></p><p>\u201cI much prefer you closer to home, yes,\u201d Steve told him with a shrug,\u00a0\u201cpreferably in a cell, nice and tucked away so that you can stop breaking the law.\u201d<br></p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cOh, Law Shmaw, they\u2019re stupid rules anyway,\u201d Tony waved a hand through the air noncommittally and then picked up an apple from the fruit bowl, throwing it up in the air,\u00a0\u201cyou know as well as I do that if I were not out there playing my little tricks, then you would be getting far more trouble from the urchins I feed with my spoils. Hunger <i>does</i> tend to inspire theft, you know.\u201d<br></p><p>Steve looked at him for another moment with his stoic face, before finally breaking character and sighing in despair.\u00a0\u201cTony, you know one day you\u2019re going to get caught while I\u2019m not around to look out for you, and you\u2019re going to hang for your crimes.\u201d He leaned forward on the table, waiting until Tony got close enough to him and then snatching the apple out of the air as he tossed it.\u00a0\u201cI know as well as you do that what you\u2019re doing is a good thing, if a little morally ambiguous- but those rich people whose diamonds and gold you steal would most certainly not agree, and if they ever got their hands on you-\u201d</p><p>He was silenced by Tony\u2019s finger against his mouth. The man looked down at him fondly, his warm chocolate eyes twinkling in the evening light, and Steve\u2019s attention was drawn to the door on the other side of the room. The last thing he needed right now were for some guards to burst in and see how\u2026 <i>friendly </i>he was with their captive prisoner.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDoor\u2019s locked,\u201d Tony said swiftly, reading his mind, \u201cand for the record, the only reason I ever <i>let </i>them catch me in the first place is because I enjoy seeing you in this delicious uniform. If you weren\u2019t around, then believe me, they wouldn\u2019t have a hope in hell.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Steve watched him intently as Tony slid smoothly onto his lap, fingers curling around the edges of his jaw. It was always such a thrill, feeling the other man\u2019s touch. Their times together were so few and far between. Steve had no idea how it had even started- when they\u2019d first met, Steve had just been enlisted into the navy, fresh and bright at the bottom of the pile, and Tony was just beginning to cause problems at sea. He stole from rich transport ships and then distributed the wealth elsewhere, and his tracks were covered so well that barely anyone had ever seen him more than once.\u00a0</p><p>Except Steve, who, for some reason, Tony had seemed to take a shine to.\u00a0</p><p>Over the years, he\u2019d climbed up the ranks in the navy, working hard to catch pirates like Tony and stop them from terrorising the waters. His record was almost perfect- the only blip being Tony himself, and the sheer amount of times the man had managed to\u00a0\u2018escape\u2019 from his custody. The first few occasions had, admittedly, been Tony genuinely just getting the upper hand on him and then disappearing before Steve even had a chance to pursue. The others\u2026 well. Steve may have been a little less vigilant than he could have been, occasionally dropped some keys now and then, you know how it is.\u00a0</p><p>He knew it was a dangerous game to play. Conspiring with a known pirate would earn him a cell in prison at the very least, and everything he\u2019d worked so hard for would go down the drain in a single moment. But Steve still did it, every time Tony was nearby. Had done from the very start, when it had just been amused banter between the cop and the crook. And as Steve had come to know Tony better- as the banter had become laced with something else, something more dangerous than just Platonic affections- he\u2019d found himself feeling things for the pirate that were definitely, most certainly not even <i>remotely </i>appropriate. Like how much he wanted to take Tony\u2019s hand and kiss each knuckle, pull him away from the danger of being here, in the lion\u2019s den. Like how he wanted Tony for himself, all the time, rather than having to go without seeing him for months and then only get these hurried moments before Tony took off again, gone to help some other impoverished family by throwing stolen jewellery at them.\u00a0</p><p>He wanted so many things that he couldn\u2019t have. It was damn infuriating sometimes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking too much,\u201d Tony murmured, running his thumb over the lines on Steve\u2019s forehead and smoothing them out,\u00a0\u201cjust relax, darling.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cRelaxing is a little hard when a felon is sat on your lap and caressing your face,\u201d Steve responded dryly, raising an eyebrow.<br></p><p>Tony just grinned, moving in closer and pressing his mouth into the skin under Steve\u2019s jaw.\u00a0\u201cI can imagine something else is a little hard right now, Commodore.\u201d He whispered, and then yelped in surprise as Steve tickled him in the ribs as punishment.\u00a0\u201cHey! That one wasn\u2019t my fault, you practically walked yourself right into it.\u201d</p><p>Steve just rolled his eyes and pressed his hands into Tony\u2019s slim waist, curling them possessively across the white fabric of his tunic. He moved his head back, turned it sideways and as Tony looked up, he leaned down and kissed him, hard and passionate. He\u2019d tried for so long to avoid that urge, but these days he didn\u2019t even bother. Tony\u2019s touch was addictive, and Steve was completely hooked.\u00a0</p><p>God. He was in love with a fucking pirate, of all people.\u00a0</p><p>Tony smiled against his mouth like he knew exactly what Steve was thinking and then kissed back, his hands framing Steve\u2019s face. A dozen bracelets fell down his forearms like a tinkling stream of metal and gold, and Steve tasted the faintest hint of strawberries from earlier- the fruit which he had been caught stealing and brought in for in the first place.</p><p>\u201cYou truly are like no one I\u2019ve ever met, Steve,\u201d Tony told him softly, his fingers slipping down Steve\u2019s neck, across his throat, over his collarbones. Steve watched Tony\u2019s eyes as they locked into his own, and couldn\u2019t resist leaning forward for another kiss.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI could say the same for you,\u201d he muttered,\u00a0\u201ca <i>good </i>pirate? Who takes from the rich and gives it back to the impoverished? I\u2019ve never heard of that before in my entire life.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Tony simply winked, and then shrugged nonchalantly. \u201cAll in a day\u2019s work, my Commodore.\u201d</p><p>He tried not to notice the way his heart clenched at the possessive endearment.\u00a0\u201cWhy do you do it?\u201d He asked, as he felt Tony\u2019s fingers slip under his tunic and find the chain to which his prison-key was attached.\u00a0\u201cWhy not just keep it and make yourself rich? You could do it. You\u2019ve proved well enough that we don\u2019t find you unless you want to be found.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s fingers paused, and then he looked over with a small tinkle of laughter. He had the most beautiful laugh that Steve had ever heard.\u00a0\u201cAnd where the hell would be the fun in that?\u201d He asked, tugging upward on the chain and then pulling it over Steve\u2019s head. He slipped it onto his own neck, where Steve took it and then carefully tucked it under the folds of his tunic, hiding it from sight. After that, his fingers lingered longingly against Tony\u2019s chest. He wanted to pull these clothes right off, laws and timings and imminent-prison-sentence be damned. It had been so long since they\u2019d last been able to be with one another like that, and Steve longed for it it like a physical weight was pushing on his sternum.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBe careful when you leave tonight,\u201d Steve told him, his arm slipping around Tony\u2019s waist and then settling on his back as Tony leaned into his neck once more, simply resting his head and relaxing this time,\u00a0\u201cRumlow is on duty, and he does not go gentle on prisoners.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cRumlow will not be seeing any prisoners today,\u201d Tony assured him,\u00a0\u201cRumlow will just be seeing an empty cell and a very large, very rude drawing of himself.\u201d<br></p><p>Steve smiled at the mental image.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re going to get me killed one day,\u201d he declared,\u00a0\u201cand I hope when you do, you come and bust me out accordingly, or I\u2019m gonna be real pissed.\u201d</p><p>The huff of breath from Tony\u2019s laughter tickled on Steve\u2019s neck, and he shut his eyes for a second, just imagining what life would be like if he did, one day, just leave. Follow Tony onto his ship, meet his crew, live their life. It seemed like pirates had a lot more fun than the navy did, at any rate,\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSweetheart,\u201d Tony said,\u00a0\u201cif you <i>do</i> ever get sentenced to death for treason and conspiring with a pirate like myself-\u201d he paused to grin, swooping down and capturing Steve\u2019s mouth in another kiss.\u00a0\u201c -I promise I\u2019ll make it up to you in the form of a very large, very ostentatious engagement ring.

It seemed like pirates had a lot more fun than the navy did, at any rate,&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Sweetheart,&rdquo; Tony said,&nbsp;&ldquo;if you <i>do</i> ever get sentenced to death for treason and conspiring with a pirate like myself-&rdquo; he paused to grin, swooping down and capturing Steve&rsquo;s mouth in another kiss.&nbsp;&ldquo; -I promise I&rsquo;ll make it up to you in the form of a very large, very ostentatious engagement ring. I&rsquo;ve heard Captain Pierce has a rather fine one on his own finger right now, actually-&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Do not steal that ring from Captain Pierce, Tony!&rdquo; Steve warned hurriedly,&nbsp;&ldquo;he loves that ring! He would drain the seven seas in search of that ring if you took it from him!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t hear you, too busy plotting,&rdquo; Tony told him absently, turning around on his lap and then leaning forward to grab a plate filled with meat and vegetables,&nbsp;&ldquo;you should eat, Steve- you need energy for all the lying you&rsquo;re going to have to do to your superiors\n\n on my behalf later tonight.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Steve shut his eyes and rested his head against the back of Tony&rsquo;s neck, letting himself despair about the situation that he&rsquo;d managed to find himself in. Treason, treachery, law-breaking, and all for one man.&nbsp;</p><p>Oops.&nbsp;</p><hr /><p><b><a href=\"http://ko-fi.com/itsallavengers\" target=\"_blank\">like my work?

                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p>Bc I saw some cool art recently and&hellip;.. pirate au&rsquo;s, a m I right?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>&ldquo;And so we meet again, Commodore Rogers. Seems you just can&rsquo;t seem to stay away.&rdquo;<br /></p>\n<p>Steve folded his arms, trying to make sure he seemed unamused.&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t flatter yourself,&rdquo; he told the man in front of him gruffly,&nbsp;&ldquo;you asked for a meal with me as your last request. I&rsquo;m just complying to a dying man&rsquo;s wish.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Rather than look even remotely afraid by that, however, Tony just laughed. Nothing seemed to faze that damn pirate- least of all Steve. Usually his Commodore&rsquo;s Uniform garnered a little more respect.&nbsp;Then again, he and Tony had been doing this for a while by now. The fear had probably worn off a little. There was only so many times Steve could threaten to throw him overboard before the words became somewhat emptier. Not that they&rsquo;d held any promise the first time either, but still.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Did you miss me while I was away?&rdquo; Tony asked, fingers brushing over the tablecloth as he moved forward. He&rsquo;d been stripped of his flashy red coat, his various stashes of weapons and even his hat- but his rings still remained, framing his delicate fingers beautifully. Steve pretended like he didn&rsquo;t know that Tony would be able to escape from his cell with those rings alone- a feat he had seen happen once before. The man was a genius, and everything he wore held some sort of value.<br /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;I much prefer you closer to home, yes,&rdquo; Steve told him with a shrug,&nbsp;&ldquo;preferably in a cell, nice and tucked away so that you can stop breaking the law.&rdquo;<br /></p>\n</p>",

Consciousness was trying to elude her, and she barely\nhad the energy to grab onto it. <i>Ah \u2013 ah,\nthere.</i> A pain thumped around her head from where she\u2019d been knocked out and\nit spliced at her in a flashing red light.</p><p><i>There\nis one bullet.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p>No \u2013 the pain wasn\u2019t red. The\nred was coming from past her eyelids, pressing at them in repetitive pulses.\nRed. Red. Red.</p><p><i>You\nmay not shoot yourself.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p>Red. Red. Red. There was a\nwoman\u2019s voice, distant and monotone. It was far underwater \u2013 or maybe she was;\nmaybe she was beneath miles of water and this voice was on dry land.</p><p><i>Someone\nmust die.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p>She was breathing though, and\nno water was filling her lungs. Air in. Air out. Pepper choked on it.</p><p><i>If\nno one is killed, you all die.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p>Her eyes shot open, gaze\nbouncing around grey concrete walls. The red was coming from a flashing light\nin a corner, far above her. The voice was clearer now.</p><p><i>You\nhave one hour.</i></p><!-- more --><p><br/></p><p><i>Shit.\n</i>Shit, what? Pepper choked\nagain, rolling onto her back and staring up at the stained ceiling. Everything\nwas grey here; grey, red, grey, red. The voice started up again. Monotone,\nfemale, icy.</p><p><i>There\nis one gun.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p>Pepper swore as she pushed\nherself up into a seated position. This wasn\u2019t her world; wasn\u2019t her job. It\nwasn\u2019t like she\u2019d never been kidnapped before \u2013 Aldrich Killian came to mind \u2013\nbut it wasn\u2019t supposed to happen. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be a part of her\nreality. Grey walls, stained with something brown, a flashing red light. This\nwas not what she signed on for. She was a CEO, not a superhero \u2013 not, not-</p><p>\u201cTony.\u201d The word came out\nchoked as her eyes caught onto the body, slumped over nearby. Pepper scrambled\nover and before she\u2019d even reached his side, she saw the next body over.\n\u201cPeter. No, no, no-\u201d</p><p>Above her, the monotone voice\nrang out again and again. Pepper was close to shoving her fist through the wall\nto get at it, to choke the life from the woman who\u2019d sit down and record such a\nthing. The woman who must be watching them.</p><p>Pepper pushed the thought\nfrom her mind, climbing over Tony\u2019s body as soon as she\u2019d confirmed his pulse.\nOn her hands and knees, she moved to Peter\u2019s side, pulling him onto his back\nand searching his neck, his wrist.</p><p>\u201cCome on, come on, come on-\noh, thank God.\u201d It was slow but steady and Pepper relaxed back, her breathing\nalready pitched and difficult to even out. They were both alive. Tony and Peter\nwere both alive.</p><p><i>Well,\nnot for long.</i></p><p>Pepper\u2019s eyes alighted on the\ngun across the room and she stared at it as if it would shoot if she looked\naway. Pepper crawled to her feet, finding them bare and missing the high heels\nshe\u2019d been wearing when the world had shaken and gone suddenly dark, and\nstepped across the room, the concrete harsh and cold against her skin.</p><p>She knelt down by the gun,\neyeing the steel door it sat at the base of and the glowing red numbers of a\ncountdown that sat above the door frame. <i>59:23.</i></p><p>Pepper picked up the handgun,\nher fingers slipping across the dark metal. A Colt revolver, her mind supplied.\nShe moved her hands to the barrel \u2013 six cylinders \u2013 and swung it out to peer\ninside. </p><p><i>There\nis one bullet.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>You\ngot that right.</i> One bullet\nsat alone in the chamber and Pepper snapped the barrel back into place.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather you not use\nthat,\u201d a strained voice said from behind her. Pepper jumped with a sharp intake\nof breath, spinning to look at Tony, perched half up from where he was lying\nand moving to check Peter\u2019s breathing.</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d she replied. The\ngun felt too heavy in her hand, despite the single bullet. There was too much\npressure riding on it; too much unfortunate circumstance.</p><p>Pepper gently slipped the gun\nback onto the floor where she found it and moved back to Tony\u2019s side, running\nher thumb gently over the angry red bruise across his cheekbone. It looked\nworse with the flashing red light.</p><p>Tony looked to Pepper, jaw\ntense. \u201cI\u2019ll get us out of this.\u201d</p><p>She nodded once, silent. She\nknew he\u2019d try.</p><p><i>If\nno one is killed, you all die.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cI hope that shuts up soon,\u201d\nPepper said. \u201cThe light\u2019s giving me a headache.\u201d</p><p>Still it flashed on. Still\nthe voice continued on. Still Pepper worried her lower lip with her teeth and\npretended not to see the fear in Tony\u2019s eyes.</p><p>He was trying to open the\ndoor when Peter blinked awake at last, a groan at the back of his throat.</p><p>\u201cHey, sweetie,\u201d Pepper\nsmiled, cupping the back of his head as he tried to sit up. She let him use her\nto lean on and kept a hand in his unruly curls. </p><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d Peter moaned.\nHe used a fist to rub his eyes and Pepper\u2019s heart swelled at the innocence of\nthe action. <i>He\u2019s just a kid.</i>\nSometimes she\u2019d forget that when she watched Spiderman on the news; taking down\nthe Vulture, facing the Sinister Six, standing tall by Tony\u2019s side at whatever\nthreats came their way. Beneath that mask, he was seventeen, and he was a <i>child.</i></p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know,\u201d Pepper said.\n\u201cWe woke up here.\u201d</p><p>Peter frowned up at her as if\nnoticing her for the first time. This was fair. Pepper wasn\u2019t one to get\nkidnapped. In fact, she was the one who called the police or assembled the\nremaining Avengers whenever Peter and Tony got kidnapped \u2013 and they got\nkidnapped more than preferable.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked and <i>God, </i>Pepper loved this child.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m alright. What\nabout you? You must\u2019ve got knocked out hard.\u201d</p><p>Peter shrugged and tried to\nstraighten and move away from Pepper\u2019s side, but she kept her hand in his hair\nand he relaxed back into it anyway.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he said. \u201cI think\nthey got us when we were leaving school.\u201d</p><p>Pepper nodded. \u201cI was leaving\nwork,\u201d she said. \u201cDidn\u2019t make it to the car.\u201d</p><p>Tony had been standing by the\ndoor throughout, the clock ticking down already \u2013 an hour was such a short\namount of time \u2013 looking over his shoulder at them occasionally but trying to\nfind some purchase on the door. They all knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to open it\nwith brute strength \u2013 Peter neither, likely. People didn\u2019t kidnap superheroes\nwithout thinking it through.</p><p>\u201cGod, May\u2019s not going to even\nknow,\u201d Peter said suddenly, and Pepper frowned, actively trying not to think\nabout May, who was no doubt waiting for her <i>goodnight</i>\ntext as Peter was supposed to spend the weekend with Tony and Pepper. May who\nwas likely going to be a little worried without the text, more so the next day\nwhen she called and no one answered \u2013 who would be alone all weekend with no\nknowledge of what was going on.</p><p>Or, worse, May who was called\nby the police when someone reported an attack on Peter and Tony outside the\nschool, and was going to sit in a sick form of purgatory for the next while,\nunsure of the outcome.</p><p>Would it be all weekend? The\nclock only said an hour. Maybe it was an hour and then they\u2019d go \u2013 or, at\nleast, whoever was still alive.</p><p>When the clock reached <i>50:00, </i>the flashing red light stopped\nand the voice ceased. It was eerily quiet without them; with just the sounds of\ntheir hearts thumping against their ribcages and their breathing \u2013 a little too\nslow for the situation.</p><p>Peter tried to pull the door\nopen, but it wouldn\u2019t budge. Eventually, he slumped down in between Pepper and\nTony, who sat opposite the door, opposite the gun, opposite the clock.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d\nPeter asked then, and Pepper\u2019s heart sank into her gut because she didn\u2019t know.\nBecause she wasn\u2019t a superhero \u2013 she didn\u2019t <i>get\n</i>into these situations. She didn\u2019t know how to save the three of them, how\nto walk out of here just fine. She didn\u2019t even know if anyone was coming for\nthem-</p><p>Was this what it was like\nevery time? When Tony was stuck in Afghanistan, <i>sure</i> that no one would find him in a cave? When they were taken\nonly a few months previous and held in a chamber filled with masked men and\nblood-stained tiles? </p><p>Pepper had only felt a surety\nwhen she was kidnapped by Killian. She had no doubt in her mind that Tony would\ncome for her. Not just because he was Iron Man, Earth\u2019s mightiest defender, but\nbecause he was <i>Tony</i>, and he would\nnever let her die. He would never leave her to be alone. Even when her insides\nhad been boiling and Extremis had taken over, she\u2019d been sure he\u2019d come for\nher.</p><p>Even when she was falling\ninto the fire, she\u2019d been sure he\u2019d find a way to catch her, even if he didn\u2019t.\n</p><p>But this \u2013 this was\nuncertainty in its rawest form and it was terrifying. This was Peter\u2019s hand\nclutching at her own, his head tilted onto Tony\u2019s shoulder. This was silence,\nthe voice vanished, a dark room and a glowing red clock counting down to their\ndeaths. This was Pepper, not knowing if Rhodey was coming after them; if Vision\nwas in the country to do so; if the police or the military would even have a\nchance; if the Rogue Avengers would be notified and even <i>get here in time.</i></p><p>There was only an hour. Only\nTony Stark could mobilise the whole planet in an hour, and he was stuck in here\ntoo.</p><p>So no one answered Peter\u2019s\nquestion. No one told him what they were going to do, because there was nothing\n<i>to</i> do. It was shoot each other or die\nanyway. It was unload the only bullet in that gun into someone\u2019s head or be\nshot as a family instead.</p><p>But May didn\u2019t deserve that.\nMay didn\u2019t deserve to lose her only remaining family. She\u2019d already lost\nRichard and Mary, already lost Ben \u2013 Pepper couldn\u2019t let her lose her nephew\ntoo. She couldn\u2019t. She and May had a sort of friendship that <i>meant something</i> to Pepper; she\u2019d seen\nMay cry, seen May at Peter\u2019s bedside; seen her on bright days of sharing lunch\nat a caf\u00e9 and warm nights dancing in a lively bar.</p><p>Pepper looked over Peter\u2019s\nhead to Tony and found him already watching her. They couldn\u2019t let Peter die.\nThere was no question about that. This wasn\u2019t them waiting out the hour and\ndying together \u2013 this was saving Peter\u2019s life.</p><p>So it would be one of them. <i>Me or you.</i></p><p>Pepper blinked. <i>Me.</i></p><p>She and Tony stared at each\nother until the clock hit <i>30:00, </i>then\nPeter spoke up.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re going to kill us if\nwe don\u2019t do something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Tony\nreplied.</p><p>\u201cNo \u2013 no, it won\u2019t. We can\u2019t\njust- I won\u2019t let us all die here. That\u2019s stupid. That\u2019s not how this goes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t all die here,\u201d\nPepper replied. She couldn\u2019t say something placating like <i>I\u2019m sure someone will find us first</i> \u2013 because she didn\u2019t trust it.\nBecause there was half an hour on the clock and if they had a few days then\nmaybe she\u2019d hold out hope. Maybe she\u2019d say that Rhodey would get to them in\ntime \u2013 but with thirty minutes-</p><p>Pepper was going to have Tony\nshoot her in twenty-nine.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t all die here,\u201d she\nrepeated, because that was the truth.</p><p>The three of them fell quiet\nand Pepper leaned her head on Peter\u2019s shoulder and Tony reached his arm around\nboth of them, and Pepper let her eyes close so she could focus on the touch of\nTony\u2019s hand, warm and calloused and so familiar in all the ways Tony was always\nfamiliar.</p><p>\u201cYou should kill me,\u201d Peter\nsaid, and Pepper opened her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were a smart\nkid,\u201d Tony replied. \u201cThat\u2019s the dumbest thing you\u2019ve ever said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d Peter moved\nout from their grip and Pepper sat up before shifting closer to Tony because\nshe was going to die in twenty-nine \u2013 no, twenty-eight \u2013 minutes and she was\ngoing to touch him all she could until then. Maybe her spirit or her soul or\nwhatever part of her was eternal in the next life would still remember him,\nthen. Maybe she could relax into that touch when she was dead and gone and it\nwould still envelope her like Tony was doing now; his arm pulling her in close,\nhis free hand holding hers.</p><p>\u201cLook at you two,\u201d Peter\nsaid, throwing a hand out. He sat before them, all angles and limbs; a ratty\nt-shirt and a pair of jeans. Mis-matched socks on his feet. \u201cYou- you- you two\nhave your whole lives together. You\u2019re like twenty years in the making, you\u2019re\ngetting married in like a month! I can\u2019t! I can\u2019t let either of you die for\nme.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKid,\u201d Tony said, letting go\nof Pepper\u2019s hand to grab Peter\u2019s. \u201cYou\u2019re not dying today. Neither of us will\nallow that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have your whole life\nahead of you,\u201d Pepper agreed. \u201cYou\u2019re so young, you can do anything \u2013 and you\nwill! Tony\u2019s always going on about how you\u2019re gonna be the greatest mind the\nworld has ever seen-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Peter interrupted.\n\u201cIt\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s you two. It\u2019s always been you two. I don\u2019t want either of you\ndying for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell we\u2019re not having you\ndying for us,\u201d Tony replied.</p><p>They fell silent then and\nPepper caught sight of the tears welling in Peter\u2019s eyes. So young. So, so\nyoung.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d she said,\nopening her arms for him. Peter didn\u2019t waste time in falling into her embrace,\ncurling around her and Tony; the three of them a knot of limbs and desperation\nand determination not to cry.</p><p>Pepper pressed her lips\nagainst the crown of Peter\u2019s head, his hair soft against her cheeks. His\nshampoo was apple, she knew that like she knew Tony\u2019s was papaya, like her own\nwas mango. She let the first, lonely tear roll down her cheek and land in his\nhair.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be something\nincredible,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou really are. And we\u2019re not- we\u2019re not going to\nlet you end that today. Queens would be lost without you and so would May. You\ncan\u2019t \u2013 you can\u2019t do that to her, okay? I won\u2019t let you.</p><p>She felt the way he nodded,\nfelt the vibrations of his movements, of Tony\u2019s. Tony pressed a kiss against\nPeter\u2019s temple and said nothing. No words ever needed to be passed between\nthose two \u2013 they were a cohesive unit; bound by something like fate or destiny.\nIt hadn\u2019t been a coincidence that they\u2019d found each other and all three of them\nknew it.</p><p>So Pepper wouldn\u2019t let Tony\ndie today, because like May would be destroyed over Peter, Peter would be\nruined by Tony. Pepper wouldn\u2019t let that happen. She wouldn\u2019t let the brightest\nmind in New York lose his mentor, his father-figure, and she wouldn\u2019t let Tony\nlose the only child he\u2019s ever thought of as a son.</p><p>Pepper could write entire\nnovels of reasons why she wouldn\u2019t let Tony die today, but instead she stayed\nquiet, her cheek pressed against Peter\u2019s hair and Tony\u2019s forehead leant against\nher temple. </p><p>The clock hit <i>15:00 </i>when Tony moved at last. Pepper\nshifted to look him in the eye, and they just stared for a moment, committing\nthe way each other\u2019s lips tilted and their brows creased to their memories.\nTony had a small scar above his right eyebrow, a tiny mole on his jaw. She\nwasn\u2019t going to look away but her eyes shut on reflex when he moved in and\nkissed her, slow and sincere.</p><p>There were novels and\nscreenplays and academic essays on the reasons Pepper Potts loved Tony Stark;\non all the things that kiss was saying; on everything Pepper had wanted to tell\nhim, someday, but would now never get the chance.</p><p>When he pulled away, Tony\ncupped her face in his hand, tucked a strand of golden-blonde hair behind her\near and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to need you to shoot me, Pep.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw tensed. \u201cFuck that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPep-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She sat up, felt Peter try to\nmove too but kept him firmly in place, her arms tightening around him.</p><p>\u201cPepper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony.\u201d</p><p>There was a warning in their\nvoices.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not shooting you,\nPepper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019m not shooting you,\nso we\u2019re at a stalemate.\u201d</p><p>Tony sighed and Pepper knew\nthat sigh intimately. She knew them all. She knew the ones that were bored of\nwork, the ones that were annoyed about there being no milk in the fridge, the\nones that were frustrated that he wasn\u2019t being understood \u2013 this was one of\nthose. She stopped speaking out of reflex; knowing that when Tony sighed like\nthat, he wanted to explain.</p><p>\u201cPepper, I\u2019m not letting you\ndie today. I won\u2019t do it. I\u2019m not going to shoot you and Peter sure as hell\nisn\u2019t \u2013 I just.\u201d He reached out again, light knuckles on her cheek. \u201cI love you\nso much. You\u2019re it, Pepper. You\u2019re everything. I can\u2019t \u2013 I won\u2019t make it\nthrough losing you. That\u2019s a fact. If you die, I die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know this is shitty and\ndifficult, I do, but I can\u2019t be the one to kill you. I still see you falling\ninto the fire in my nightmares because <i>I </i>couldn\u2019t\ncatch you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony, I\u2019ll lose my mind if I\nhave to kill you today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPepper, you\u2019re the strongest\nperson I\u2019ve ever met. I\u2019m not saying this won\u2019t be fucking awful, but I know\nyou. You\u2019ll make it through. You\u2019ll do amazing things and-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot without you. <i>Tony.</i> I\u2019m not doing this. I\u2019m not shooting\nyou. You\u2019re going to shoot me, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot okay-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you die, the entire world\nloses you, Tony. If I die, it\u2019s just a company. But you \u2013 God, Tony. You never\ndid know how much you were worth. Even when you thought you were the hottest\nshit on Earth, you still thought you were only the kind of shit on someone\u2019s\nshoes. No \u2013 no, Tony. You\u2019re Iron Man. You\u2019re Tony Stark. You\u2019re the only one\nthis planet has that\u2019s going to defend it. You\u2019re the only one <i>I </i>have-\u201d</p><p>\u201cPep.\u201d</p><p>Pepper took a deep breath,\nswallowing. Her face was wet and tear-streaked, matching Tony\u2019s, and she\u2019d\nsomehow let go of Peter during the argument, and he was sitting back and\nstaring at them with wide, shining eyes. They were broken, all of them, facing\na demise that they had to choose.</p><p>\u201cLook at him,\u201d Pepper said,\nnodding to Peter. She watched Tony hesitate before he did. \u201cI can\u2019t help him\nlike you can. I can\u2019t <i>raise </i>him like\nyou can. He\u2019s going to take on the world and <i>I can\u2019t help him do that.</i> You can. You can teach him, Tony-\u201d</p><p>Tony choked down some kind of\nlaugh. \u201cYou\u2019re fucking guilting me using Peter?\u201d</p><p>Pepper bit her tongue and\nlocked her jaw, meeting his eye. But Tony wasn\u2019t angry, he was just deeply,\nhorribly sad and he scrubbed at his face, his hands coming back damp.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t fucking do this,\u201d\nTony said. \u201cI can\u2019t fucking do this. I don\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t want to leave either of\nyou, but I know, Pepper, I <i>know </i>I\nneed to be the one.\u201d He crawled closer, holding Pepper\u2019s face in his hands.\n\u201cThe past ten years of my life, it\u2019s been about saving people. I made Iron Man\nso people could be <i>safe.</i> So people\ncould be protected, and I could never do that if you weren\u2019t safe. If I\ncouldn\u2019t protect you. Pepper, if I don\u2019t protect you now, then- then-\u201d</p><p>Pepper kissed him. She kissed\nhim and she cried and she grabbed at him to pull him as tight as she could\nbecause it was just him. It was always him. It was always Tony.</p><p><i>There\nis one gun.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p>The voice started up suddenly\nand Pepper broke the kiss.</p><p><i>There\nis one bullet. You may not shoot yourself. Someone must die. If no one is\nkilled, you all die. You have ten minutes.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p>Pepper jerked her gaze to the\nclock. <i>10:00. </i>The voice didn\u2019t repeat\nits message.</p><p>She turned back to Tony.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t kill her when\nkeeping her alive had been his goal for so long, and she couldn\u2019t kill him\nbecause she\u2019d shatter if she did.</p><p>Pepper pulled him into a hug,\na tight embrace where she held him with all her strength and felt him do the\nsame back.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she whispered.\n\u201cI love you more than anything.\u201d</p><p>Tony pressed his lips against\nher jaw, her cheek, her lips.</p><p>Peter was crying. When Pepper\nand Tony moved apart, she pulled Peter into her arms.</p><p>Tony shifted into the\nembrace, too, holding Peter close to his chest.</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve done so many\nthings better,\u201d Tony said and Pepper tried to memorise the way his voice lilted\nacross every word. His mother was a musician and she\u2019d passed that down to him.\nHe could play the piano with startling beauty, though she doubted he\u2019d ever\nshown anyone besides her. \u201cPeter, you\u2019re going to be the greatest hero of us\nall, okay? When you want it \u2013 <i>if </i>you\nwant it - the Avengers \u2013 they\u2019re yours. They\u2019re all yours. And SI. The\ncompany.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony-\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t \u2013 I can\u2019t do that.\nThat\u2019s yours, and Pepper\u2019s, and-\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, Pete. You\u2019re already\nnamed as the heir, okay? Pepper\u2019s gonna be with you every step of the way. You\ndon\u2019t have to take on the company until you want it, and even then Pepper\u2019s\ngonna keep CEO until you feel like you\u2019re ready for that. But, that\u2019s yours, if\nyou want that. Shit, shit \u2013 there\u2019s so many things I want to say. Kid, kid.\u201d\nTony moved until he was face-to-face with Peter, holding his shoulders. \u201cYou\u2019re\ngood enough. You\u2019re more than good enough. You\u2019re Peter Parker and you\u2019re the\nbest damn thing in this world and I love you so much. You\u2019re a son to me,\nPeter. I- I\u2019m so fucking grateful to have you in my life.\u201d</p><p>Peter barrelled himself into\nTony\u2019s chest and Pepper used the moment they held each other to swipe away the\ntears that were threatening to drown her. How could she agree to kill him? How\nwas she even going to manage it? Putting a gun to her fianc\u00e9\u2019s head and pulling\nthe trigger? It felt unexplainable; it felt impossible.</p><p>She swallowed down the vomit\nthreatening to rise and listened to Peter\u2019s whispered <i>I love you, I\u2019m sorry, Tony, Mr Stark, please, I can\u2019t-</i></p><p>\u201cYou can,\u201d Tony replied. \u201cYou\ncan do anything you set your mind to. Whatever you do in your life, I\u2019m proud\nof you. I am.\u201d</p><p>Peter stayed huddled against\nTony\u2019s chest, relishing in the last warmth he\u2019d ever have, when Tony met\nPepper\u2019s eye. \u201cI wish I could marry you,\u201d he said. \u201cI wish I could see you on\nour wedding day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already seen me in\nthe dress,\u201d Pepper said. \u201cIt\u2019s that Vera Wang one. You walked in when I was\ntrying it on and you choked and spilt your drink.\u201d Tony laughed for what it was\nworth, and Pepper smiled as best she could. \u201cThe moment you did that I was sold\non it.\u201d</p><p>She moved closer to the pair,\nsitting by Tony\u2019s side, turned to face him. She pressed her forehead into his\nshoulder as his free arm pulled her in.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the love of my life,\u201d\nhe said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the love of mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for saying yes to\nme. And for looking after me. For sticking by me through all my dumb shit, and\nfor kissing me for the first time in front of Rhodey.\u201d Pepper choked out a\nlaugh into his shoulder. \u201cI know this is gonna be awful, Pep. I know this is\ngonna suck a whole lot, and it\u2019s gonna suck for a while after too. But I know\nyou can get through it. I know you\u2019ll make it out the other side, and you\u2019ll\ncontinue to be the incredible woman that you\u2019ve always been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you to do me a\nfavour,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook after Peter for me.\u201d</p><p>She nodded into his shoulder.\n\u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a handful and he talks\na mile a minute and sometimes he gets stuck in his own web fluid. There\u2019s a few\nbottles of dissolvent in the lab, just ask FRIDAY where it is. I added a\nfeature to the mark 56, too, which can spray it. FRIDAY has the specs for that.\nKeep him safe, okay?\u201d</p><p>Pepper sniffed. \u201cI\u2019ll ask\nFRIDAY to make me one of those stalker apps where I track his vitals all hours\nof the day.\u201d</p><p>Even Peter laughed into\nTony\u2019s chest.</p><p>Tony smiled and pressed a\nkiss into her hair. \u201cThank you. And you look out for Pepper, okay kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Mr Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we were at Tony!\nPeter! Come on!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry Tony,\u201d Peter replied,\nhis voice muffled.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s better.\u201d</p><p>They were quiet for a moment\nand Pepper lifted her head, sparing a glance at the clock on the wall. <i>4:51. </i>\u201cThere\u2019s only one Tony Stark,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cOnly one you. Tony, you\u2019re my favourite person and I\u2019m <i>so</i> thankful, every day, that you\u2019re in\nmy life. I know the world\u2019s going to miss you and they\u2019re going to miss Iron\nMan \u2013 but I can\u2019t <i>imagine </i>my life\nwithout you. I can\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t know how-\u201d</p><p>\u201cPepper.\u201d Tony\u2019s voice was\nsoft, his hand in her hair. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s alright. You\u2019ll be okay. Focus on\ngetting through each day and eventually they\u2019ll become easier. Just- the world\nneeds heroes, I know it does. It\u2019s got Peter and it\u2019s got Rhodey \u2013 tell him I\nlove him so much, okay? Happy, too \u2013 but I just need you to know that there\u2019s-\nthere\u2019s a suit. I made it for emergencies. Like this one, I guess \u2013 and it\u2019s\nyours. You don\u2019t have to use it, but it\u2019s tailored for you. Ask FRIDAY for the\nRescue suit.\u201d</p><p>Pepper blinked at him. He\nmade her a suit. <i>He made her a suit.</i> \u201cRescue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cYou rescued\nme plenty of times. Felt right. Okay? Okay. I love you so much.\u201d He pressed\nanother kiss to her lips. \u201cI wish I could\u2019ve done everything with you. Kids,\ndog, goldfish.\u201d</p><p>They held each other. The\nthree of them. A tangled web of people who loved one another more than anything\nelse.</p><p>When the clock hit two\nminutes \u2013 Pepper watched it with bile in her mouth \u2013 she pulled away and walked\nto the door, where she picked up the gun. Colt revolver. Felt stupid that she\nknew the term. Felt stupid that she knew how to snap the barrel out of position\nand check the bullet was in the right chamber. Felt stupid that she could click\noff the safety with her thumb.</p><p>She kept her finger firmly\noff the trigger when she moved back.</p><p>She kissed Tony for all she\nwas worth, she held him as tight as she could.</p><p>\u201cI love you, I love you, I\nlove you,\u201d he muttered into her ear.</p><p>She sat back as he said his\nfinal goodbye to Peter.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Tony,\u201d Peter\nwhispered. \u201cYou\u2019re my dad, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know, Pete.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could save you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. You\u2019re going to be\namazing, Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for everything.\u201d</p><p>Pepper swallowed her sob. The\nclock hit <i>1:00. 00:59. 00:58.</i></p><p>Pepper pressed a final kiss against\nTony\u2019s lips. She savoured him for everything she was.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my everything,\u201d she\ntold him. \u201cIn my whole life, I\u2019ll never love anyone the way I love you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and it felt real. Pepper\nsat back on her knees, Peter leaning against her side. She checked the safety.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay not to be strong\nsometimes. It\u2019s okay.\u201d Tony nodded at Pepper, once, firm. \u201cLook after each\nother.\u201d</p><p>He shut his eyes as Pepper\nlifted the gun. She should\u2019ve known that he wouldn\u2019t want to see her at the\nother end of a revolver, pointed at his forehead. Peter sobbed suddenly, and\nPepper paused to pull him closer, a hand over his eyes, turning his head away\nfrom Tony Stark.</p><p>She should\u2019ve known when she\nwoke up that he would do this; that she would be pointing the gun and he would\nbe on the receiving end of the bullet.</p><p>She should\u2019ve known.</p><p>Tony Stark was nothing in not\na martyr. Was nothing if not a hero.</p><p>\u201cYou are so loved,\u201d Pepper\nsaid. She saw Tony\u2019s muscles relax. She pulled the trigger.</p><p>\u00a0-</p><p>\u00a0-</p><p>She stared at the space he\u2019d\nbeen, not at the space he now occupied.</p><p>The gun clattered to the\nfloor and Pepper pulled Peter in tighter, not letting him look at what she\u2019d\ndone. Her hands were clean but when she looked at them, they were so, so\nstained.</p><p>The clock hit <i>00:00 </i>and a buzz sounded, the door\nswinging open.</p><p>Pepper almost said <i>let\u2019s go home</i>, but the words died in her\nthroat. She\u2019d killed their home. Their home was lying in his own blood. </p><p>She\u2019d never be able to go\nhome again.</p>",

Pepper choked\nagain, rolling onto her back and staring up at the stained ceiling. Everything\nwas grey here; grey, red, grey, red. The voice started up again. Monotone,\nfemale, icy.</p><p><i>There\nis one gun.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p>Pepper swore as she pushed\nherself up into a seated position. This wasn\u2019t her world; wasn\u2019t her job. It\nwasn\u2019t like she\u2019d never been kidnapped before \u2013 Aldrich Killian came to mind \u2013\nbut it wasn\u2019t supposed to happen. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be a part of her\nreality. Grey walls, stained with something brown, a flashing red light. This\nwas not what she signed on for. She was a CEO, not a superhero \u2013 not, not-</p><p>\u201cTony.\u201d The word came out\nchoked as her eyes caught onto the body, slumped over nearby. Pepper scrambled\nover and before she\u2019d even reached his side, she saw the next body over.\n\u201cPeter. No, no, no-\u201d</p><p>Above her, the monotone voice\nrang out again and again. Pepper was close to shoving her fist through the wall\nto get at it, to choke the life from the woman who\u2019d sit down and record such a\nthing. The woman who must be watching them.</p><p>Pepper pushed the thought\nfrom her mind, climbing over Tony\u2019s body as soon as she\u2019d confirmed his pulse.\nOn her hands and knees, she moved to Peter\u2019s side, pulling him onto his back\nand searching his neck, his wrist.</p><p>\u201cCome on, come on, come on-\noh, thank God.\u201d It was slow but steady and Pepper relaxed back, her breathing\nalready pitched and difficult to even out. They were both alive. Tony and Peter\nwere both alive.</p><p><i>Well,\nnot for long.</i></p><p>Pepper\u2019s eyes alighted on the\ngun across the room and she stared at it as if it would shoot if she looked\naway. Pepper crawled to her feet, finding them bare and missing the high heels\nshe\u2019d been wearing when the world had shaken and gone suddenly dark, and\nstepped across the room, the concrete harsh and cold against her skin.</p><p>She knelt down by the gun,\neyeing the steel door it sat at the base of and the glowing red numbers of a\ncountdown that sat above the door frame. <i>59:23.</i></p><p>Pepper picked up the handgun,\nher fingers slipping across the dark metal. A Colt revolver, her mind supplied.\nShe moved her hands to the barrel \u2013 six cylinders \u2013 and swung it out to peer\ninside. </p><p><i>There\nis one bullet.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>You\ngot that right.</i> One bullet\nsat alone in the chamber and Pepper snapped the barrel back into place.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather you not use\nthat,\u201d a strained voice said from behind her. Pepper jumped with a sharp intake\nof breath, spinning to look at Tony, perched half up from where he was lying\nand moving to check Peter\u2019s breathing.</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d she replied. The\ngun felt too heavy in her hand, despite the single bullet. There was too much\npressure riding on it; too much unfortunate circumstance.</p><p>Pepper gently slipped the gun\nback onto the floor where she found it and moved back to Tony\u2019s side, running\nher thumb gently over the angry red bruise across his cheekbone. It looked\nworse with the flashing red light.</p><p>Tony looked to Pepper, jaw\ntense. \u201cI\u2019ll get us out of this.\u201d</p><p>She nodded once, silent. She\nknew he\u2019d try.</p><p><i>If\nno one is killed, you all die.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cI hope that shuts up soon,\u201d\nPepper said. \u201cThe light\u2019s giving me a headache.\u201d</p><p>Still it flashed on. Still\nthe voice continued on. Still Pepper worried her lower lip with her teeth and\npretended not to see the fear in Tony\u2019s eyes.</p><p>He was trying to open the\ndoor when Peter blinked awake at last, a groan at the back of his throat.</p><p>\u201cHey, sweetie,\u201d Pepper\nsmiled, cupping the back of his head as he tried to sit up. She let him use her\nto lean on and kept a hand in his unruly curls. </p><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d Peter moaned.\nHe used a fist to rub his eyes and Pepper\u2019s heart swelled at the innocence of\nthe action. <i>He\u2019s just a kid.</i>\nSometimes she\u2019d forget that when she watched Spiderman on the news; taking down\nthe Vulture, facing the Sinister Six, standing tall by Tony\u2019s side at whatever\nthreats came their way. Beneath that mask, he was seventeen, and he was a <i>child.</i></p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know,\u201d Pepper said.\n\u201cWe woke up here.\u201d</p><p>Peter frowned up at her as if\nnoticing her for the first time. This was fair. Pepper wasn\u2019t one to get\nkidnapped. In fact, she was the one who called the police or assembled the\nremaining Avengers whenever Peter and Tony got kidnapped \u2013 and they got\nkidnapped more than preferable.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked and <i>God, </i>Pepper loved this child.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m alright. What\nabout you? You must\u2019ve got knocked out hard.\u201d</p><p>Peter shrugged and tried to\nstraighten and move away from Pepper\u2019s side, but she kept her hand in his hair\nand he relaxed back into it anyway.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he said. \u201cI think\nthey got us when we were leaving school.\u201d</p><p>Pepper nodded. \u201cI was leaving\nwork,\u201d she said. \u201cDidn\u2019t make it to the car.\u201d</p><p>Tony had been standing by the\ndoor throughout, the clock ticking down already \u2013 an hour was such a short\namount of time \u2013 looking over his shoulder at them occasionally but trying to\nfind some purchase on the door. They all knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to open it\nwith brute strength \u2013 Peter neither, likely. People didn\u2019t kidnap superheroes\nwithout thinking it through.</p><p>\u201cGod, May\u2019s not going to even\nknow,\u201d Peter said suddenly, and Pepper frowned, actively trying not to think\nabout May, who was no doubt waiting for her <i>goodnight</i>\ntext as Peter was supposed to spend the weekend with Tony and Pepper. May who\nwas likely going to be a little worried without the text, more so the next day\nwhen she called and no one answered \u2013 who would be alone all weekend with no\nknowledge of what was going on.</p><p>Or, worse, May who was called\nby the police when someone reported an attack on Peter and Tony outside the\nschool, and was going to sit in a sick form of purgatory for the next while,\nunsure of the outcome.</p><p>Would it be all weekend? The\nclock only said an hour. Maybe it was an hour and then they\u2019d go \u2013 or, at\nleast, whoever was still alive.</p><p>When the clock reached <i>50:00, </i>the flashing red light stopped\nand the voice ceased. It was eerily quiet without them; with just the sounds of\ntheir hearts thumping against their ribcages and their breathing \u2013 a little too\nslow for the situation.</p><p>Peter tried to pull the door\nopen, but it wouldn\u2019t budge. Eventually, he slumped down in between Pepper and\nTony, who sat opposite the door, opposite the gun, opposite the clock.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d\nPeter asked then, and Pepper\u2019s heart sank into her gut because she didn\u2019t know.\nBecause she wasn\u2019t a superhero \u2013 she didn\u2019t <i>get\n</i>into these situations. She didn\u2019t know how to save the three of them, how\nto walk out of here just fine. She didn\u2019t even know if anyone was coming for\nthem-</p><p>Was this what it was like\nevery time? When Tony was stuck in Afghanistan, <i>sure</i> that no one would find him in a cave? When they were taken\nonly a few months previous and held in a chamber filled with masked men and\nblood-stained tiles? </p><p>Pepper had only felt a surety\nwhen she was kidnapped by Killian. She had no doubt in her mind that Tony would\ncome for her. Not just because he was Iron Man, Earth\u2019s mightiest defender, but\nbecause he was <i>Tony</i>, and he would\nnever let her die. He would never leave her to be alone. Even when her insides\nhad been boiling and Extremis had taken over, she\u2019d been sure he\u2019d come for\nher.</p><p>Even when she was falling\ninto the fire, she\u2019d been sure he\u2019d find a way to catch her, even if he didn\u2019t.\n</p><p>But this \u2013 this was\nuncertainty in its rawest form and it was terrifying. This was Peter\u2019s hand\nclutching at her own, his head tilted onto Tony\u2019s shoulder. This was silence,\nthe voice vanished, a dark room and a glowing red clock counting down to their\ndeaths. This was Pepper, not knowing if Rhodey was coming after them; if Vision\nwas in the country to do so; if the police or the military would even have a\nchance; if the Rogue Avengers would be notified and even <i>get here in time.</i></p><p>There was only an hour. Only\nTony Stark could mobilise the whole planet in an hour, and he was stuck in here\ntoo.</p><p>So no one answered Peter\u2019s\nquestion. No one told him what they were going to do, because there was nothing\n<i>to</i> do. It was shoot each other or die\nanyway. It was unload the only bullet in that gun into someone\u2019s head or be\nshot as a family instead.</p><p>But May didn\u2019t deserve that.\nMay didn\u2019t deserve to lose her only remaining family. She\u2019d already lost\nRichard and Mary, already lost Ben \u2013 Pepper couldn\u2019t let her lose her nephew\ntoo. She couldn\u2019t. She and May had a sort of friendship that <i>meant something</i> to Pepper; she\u2019d seen\nMay cry, seen May at Peter\u2019s bedside; seen her on bright days of sharing lunch\nat a caf\u00e9 and warm nights dancing in a lively bar.</p><p>Pepper looked over Peter\u2019s\nhead to Tony and found him already watching her. They couldn\u2019t let Peter die.\nThere was no question about that. This wasn\u2019t them waiting out the hour and\ndying together \u2013 this was saving Peter\u2019s life.</p><p>So it would be one of them. <i>Me or you.</i></p><p>Pepper blinked. <i>Me.</i></p><p>She and Tony stared at each\nother until the clock hit <i>30:00, </i>then\nPeter spoke up.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re going to kill us if\nwe don\u2019t do something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Tony\nreplied.</p><p>\u201cNo \u2013 no, it won\u2019t. We can\u2019t\njust- I won\u2019t let us all die here. That\u2019s stupid. That\u2019s not how this goes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t all die here,\u201d\nPepper replied. She couldn\u2019t say something placating like <i>I\u2019m sure someone will find us first</i> \u2013 because she didn\u2019t trust it.\nBecause there was half an hour on the clock and if they had a few days then\nmaybe she\u2019d hold out hope. Maybe she\u2019d say that Rhodey would get to them in\ntime \u2013 but with thirty minutes-</p><p>Pepper was going to have Tony\nshoot her in twenty-nine.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t all die here,\u201d she\nrepeated, because that was the truth.</p><p>The three of them fell quiet\nand Pepper leaned her head on Peter\u2019s shoulder and Tony reached his arm around\nboth of them, and Pepper let her eyes close so she could focus on the touch of\nTony\u2019s hand, warm and calloused and so familiar in all the ways Tony was always\nfamiliar.</p><p>\u201cYou should kill me,\u201d Peter\nsaid, and Pepper opened her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were a smart\nkid,\u201d Tony replied. \u201cThat\u2019s the dumbest thing you\u2019ve ever said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d Peter moved\nout from their grip and Pepper sat up before shifting closer to Tony because\nshe was going to die in twenty-nine \u2013 no, twenty-eight \u2013 minutes and she was\ngoing to touch him all she could until then. Maybe her spirit or her soul or\nwhatever part of her was eternal in the next life would still remember him,\nthen. Maybe she could relax into that touch when she was dead and gone and it\nwould still envelope her like Tony was doing now; his arm pulling her in close,\nhis free hand holding hers.</p><p>\u201cLook at you two,\u201d Peter\nsaid, throwing a hand out. He sat before them, all angles and limbs; a ratty\nt-shirt and a pair of jeans. Mis-matched socks on his feet. \u201cYou- you- you two\nhave your whole lives together. You\u2019re like twenty years in the making, you\u2019re\ngetting married in like a month! I can\u2019t! I can\u2019t let either of you die for\nme.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKid,\u201d Tony said, letting go\nof Pepper\u2019s hand to grab Peter\u2019s. \u201cYou\u2019re not dying today. Neither of us will\nallow that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have your whole life\nahead of you,\u201d Pepper agreed. \u201cYou\u2019re so young, you can do anything \u2013 and you\nwill! Tony\u2019s always going on about how you\u2019re gonna be the greatest mind the\nworld has ever seen-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Peter interrupted.\n\u201cIt\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s you two. It\u2019s always been you two. I don\u2019t want either of you\ndying for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell we\u2019re not having you\ndying for us,\u201d Tony replied.</p><p>They fell silent then and\nPepper caught sight of the tears welling in Peter\u2019s eyes. So young. So, so\nyoung.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d she said,\nopening her arms for him. Peter didn\u2019t waste time in falling into her embrace,\ncurling around her and Tony; the three of them a knot of limbs and desperation\nand determination not to cry.</p><p>Pepper pressed her lips\nagainst the crown of Peter\u2019s head, his hair soft against her cheeks. His\nshampoo was apple, she knew that like she knew Tony\u2019s was papaya, like her own\nwas mango. She let the first, lonely tear roll down her cheek and land in his\nhair.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be something\nincredible,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou really are. And we\u2019re not- we\u2019re not going to\nlet you end that today. Queens would be lost without you and so would May. You\ncan\u2019t \u2013 you can\u2019t do that to her, okay? I won\u2019t let you.</p><p>She felt the way he nodded,\nfelt the vibrations of his movements, of Tony\u2019s. Tony pressed a kiss against\nPeter\u2019s temple and said nothing. No words ever needed to be passed between\nthose two \u2013 they were a cohesive unit; bound by something like fate or destiny.\nIt hadn\u2019t been a coincidence that they\u2019d found each other and all three of them\nknew it.</p><p>So Pepper wouldn\u2019t let Tony\ndie today, because like May would be destroyed over Peter, Peter would be\nruined by Tony. Pepper wouldn\u2019t let that happen. She wouldn\u2019t let the brightest\nmind in New York lose his mentor, his father-figure, and she wouldn\u2019t let Tony\nlose the only child he\u2019s ever thought of as a son.</p><p>Pepper could write entire\nnovels of reasons why she wouldn\u2019t let Tony die today, but instead she stayed\nquiet, her cheek pressed against Peter\u2019s hair and Tony\u2019s forehead leant against\nher temple. </p><p>The clock hit <i>15:00 </i>when Tony moved at last. Pepper\nshifted to look him in the eye, and they just stared for a moment, committing\nthe way each other\u2019s lips tilted and their brows creased to their memories.\nTony had a small scar above his right eyebrow, a tiny mole on his jaw. She\nwasn\u2019t going to look away but her eyes shut on reflex when he moved in and\nkissed her, slow and sincere.</p><p>There were novels and\nscreenplays and academic essays on the reasons Pepper Potts loved Tony Stark;\non all the things that kiss was saying; on everything Pepper had wanted to tell\nhim, someday, but would now never get the chance.</p><p>When he pulled away, Tony\ncupped her face in his hand, tucked a strand of golden-blonde hair behind her\near and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to need you to shoot me, Pep.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw tensed. \u201cFuck that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPep-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She sat up, felt Peter try to\nmove too but kept him firmly in place, her arms tightening around him.</p><p>\u201cPepper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony.\u201d</p><p>There was a warning in their\nvoices.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not shooting you,\nPepper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019m not shooting you,\nso we\u2019re at a stalemate.\u201d</p><p>Tony sighed and Pepper knew\nthat sigh intimately. She knew them all. She knew the ones that were bored of\nwork, the ones that were annoyed about there being no milk in the fridge, the\nones that were frustrated that he wasn\u2019t being understood \u2013 this was one of\nthose. She stopped speaking out of reflex; knowing that when Tony sighed like\nthat, he wanted to explain.</p><p>\u201cPepper, I\u2019m not letting you\ndie today. I won\u2019t do it. I\u2019m not going to shoot you and Peter sure as hell\nisn\u2019t \u2013 I just.\u201d He reached out again, light knuckles on her cheek. \u201cI love you\nso much. You\u2019re it, Pepper. You\u2019re everything. I can\u2019t \u2013 I won\u2019t make it\nthrough losing you. That\u2019s a fact. If you die, I die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know this is shitty and\ndifficult, I do, but I can\u2019t be the one to kill you. I still see you falling\ninto the fire in my nightmares because <i>I </i>couldn\u2019t\ncatch you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony, I\u2019ll lose my mind if I\nhave to kill you today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPepper, you\u2019re the strongest\nperson I\u2019ve ever met. I\u2019m not saying this won\u2019t be fucking awful, but I know\nyou. You\u2019ll make it through. You\u2019ll do amazing things and-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot without you. <i>Tony.</i> I\u2019m not doing this. I\u2019m not shooting\nyou. You\u2019re going to shoot me, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot okay-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you die, the entire world\nloses you, Tony. If I die, it\u2019s just a company. But you \u2013 God, Tony. You never\ndid know how much you were worth. Even when you thought you were the hottest\nshit on Earth, you still thought you were only the kind of shit on someone\u2019s\nshoes. No \u2013 no, Tony. You\u2019re Iron Man. You\u2019re Tony Stark. You\u2019re the only one\nthis planet has that\u2019s going to defend it. You\u2019re the only one <i>I </i>have-\u201d</p><p>\u201cPep.\u201d</p><p>Pepper took a deep breath,\nswallowing. Her face was wet and tear-streaked, matching Tony\u2019s, and she\u2019d\nsomehow let go of Peter during the argument, and he was sitting back and\nstaring at them with wide, shining eyes. They were broken, all of them, facing\na demise that they had to choose.</p><p>\u201cLook at him,\u201d Pepper said,\nnodding to Peter. She watched Tony hesitate before he did. \u201cI can\u2019t help him\nlike you can. I can\u2019t <i>raise </i>him like\nyou can. He\u2019s going to take on the world and <i>I can\u2019t help him do that.</i> You can. You can teach him, Tony-\u201d</p><p>Tony choked down some kind of\nlaugh. \u201cYou\u2019re fucking guilting me using Peter?\u201d</p><p>Pepper bit her tongue and\nlocked her jaw, meeting his eye. But Tony wasn\u2019t angry, he was just deeply,\nhorribly sad and he scrubbed at his face, his hands coming back damp.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t fucking do this,\u201d\nTony said. \u201cI can\u2019t fucking do this. I don\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t want to leave either of\nyou, but I know, Pepper, I <i>know </i>I\nneed to be the one.\u201d He crawled closer, holding Pepper\u2019s face in his hands.\n\u201cThe past ten years of my life, it\u2019s been about saving people. I made Iron Man\nso people could be <i>safe.</i> So people\ncould be protected, and I could never do that if you weren\u2019t safe. If I\ncouldn\u2019t protect you. Pepper, if I don\u2019t protect you now, then- then-\u201d</p><p>Pepper kissed him. She kissed\nhim and she cried and she grabbed at him to pull him as tight as she could\nbecause it was just him. It was always him. It was always Tony.</p><p><i>There\nis one gun.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p>The voice started up suddenly\nand Pepper broke the kiss.</p><p><i>There\nis one bullet. You may not shoot yourself. Someone must die. If no one is\nkilled, you all die. You have ten minutes.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p>Pepper jerked her gaze to the\nclock. <i>10:00. </i>The voice didn\u2019t repeat\nits message.</p><p>She turned back to Tony.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t kill her when\nkeeping her alive had been his goal for so long, and she couldn\u2019t kill him\nbecause she\u2019d shatter if she did.</p><p>Pepper pulled him into a hug,\na tight embrace where she held him with all her strength and felt him do the\nsame back.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she whispered.\n\u201cI love you more than anything.\u201d</p><p>Tony pressed his lips against\nher jaw, her cheek, her lips.</p><p>Peter was crying. When Pepper\nand Tony moved apart, she pulled Peter into her arms.</p><p>Tony shifted into the\nembrace, too, holding Peter close to his chest.</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve done so many\nthings better,\u201d Tony said and Pepper tried to memorise the way his voice lilted\nacross every word. His mother was a musician and she\u2019d passed that down to him.\nHe could play the piano with startling beauty, though she doubted he\u2019d ever\nshown anyone besides her. \u201cPeter, you\u2019re going to be the greatest hero of us\nall, okay? When you want it \u2013 <i>if </i>you\nwant it - the Avengers \u2013 they\u2019re yours. They\u2019re all yours. And SI. The\ncompany.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony-\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t \u2013 I can\u2019t do that.\nThat\u2019s yours, and Pepper\u2019s, and-\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, Pete. You\u2019re already\nnamed as the heir, okay? Pepper\u2019s gonna be with you every step of the way. You\ndon\u2019t have to take on the company until you want it, and even then Pepper\u2019s\ngonna keep CEO until you feel like you\u2019re ready for that. But, that\u2019s yours, if\nyou want that. Shit, shit \u2013 there\u2019s so many things I want to say. Kid, kid.\u201d\nTony moved until he was face-to-face with Peter, holding his shoulders. \u201cYou\u2019re\ngood enough. You\u2019re more than good enough. You\u2019re Peter Parker and you\u2019re the\nbest damn thing in this world and I love you so much. You\u2019re a son to me,\nPeter. I- I\u2019m so fucking grateful to have you in my life.\u201d</p><p>Peter barrelled himself into\nTony\u2019s chest and Pepper used the moment they held each other to swipe away the\ntears that were threatening to drown her. How could she agree to kill him? How\nwas she even going to manage it? Putting a gun to her fianc\u00e9\u2019s head and pulling\nthe trigger? It felt unexplainable; it felt impossible.</p><p>She swallowed down the vomit\nthreatening to rise and listened to Peter\u2019s whispered <i>I love you, I\u2019m sorry, Tony, Mr Stark, please, I can\u2019t-</i></p><p>\u201cYou can,\u201d Tony replied. \u201cYou\ncan do anything you set your mind to. Whatever you do in your life, I\u2019m proud\nof you. I am.\u201d</p><p>Peter stayed huddled against\nTony\u2019s chest, relishing in the last warmth he\u2019d ever have, when Tony met\nPepper\u2019s eye. \u201cI wish I could marry you,\u201d he said. \u201cI wish I could see you on\nour wedding day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already seen me in\nthe dress,\u201d Pepper said. \u201cIt\u2019s that Vera Wang one. You walked in when I was\ntrying it on and you choked and spilt your drink.\u201d Tony laughed for what it was\nworth, and Pepper smiled as best she could. \u201cThe moment you did that I was sold\non it.\u201d</p><p>She moved closer to the pair,\nsitting by Tony\u2019s side, turned to face him. She pressed her forehead into his\nshoulder as his free arm pulled her in.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the love of my life,\u201d\nhe said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the love of mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for saying yes to\nme. And for looking after me. For sticking by me through all my dumb shit, and\nfor kissing me for the first time in front of Rhodey.\u201d Pepper choked out a\nlaugh into his shoulder. \u201cI know this is gonna be awful, Pep. I know this is\ngonna suck a whole lot, and it\u2019s gonna suck for a while after too. But I know\nyou can get through it. I know you\u2019ll make it out the other side, and you\u2019ll\ncontinue to be the incredible woman that you\u2019ve always been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you to do me a\nfavour,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook after Peter for me.\u201d</p><p>She nodded into his shoulder.\n\u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a handful and he talks\na mile a minute and sometimes he gets stuck in his own web fluid. There\u2019s a few\nbottles of dissolvent in the lab, just ask FRIDAY where it is. I added a\nfeature to the mark 56, too, which can spray it. FRIDAY has the specs for that.\nKeep him safe, okay?\u201d</p><p>Pepper sniffed. \u201cI\u2019ll ask\nFRIDAY to make me one of those stalker apps where I track his vitals all hours\nof the day.\u201d</p><p>Even Peter laughed into\nTony\u2019s chest.</p><p>Tony smiled and pressed a\nkiss into her hair. \u201cThank you. And you look out for Pepper, okay kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Mr Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we were at Tony!\nPeter! Come on!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry Tony,\u201d Peter replied,\nhis voice muffled.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s better.\u201d</p><p>They were quiet for a moment\nand Pepper lifted her head, sparing a glance at the clock on the wall. <i>4:51. </i>\u201cThere\u2019s only one Tony Stark,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cOnly one you. Tony, you\u2019re my favourite person and I\u2019m <i>so</i> thankful, every day, that you\u2019re in\nmy life. I know the world\u2019s going to miss you and they\u2019re going to miss Iron\nMan \u2013 but I can\u2019t <i>imagine </i>my life\nwithout you. I can\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t know how-\u201d</p><p>\u201cPepper.\u201d Tony\u2019s voice was\nsoft, his hand in her hair. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s alright. You\u2019ll be okay. Focus on\ngetting through each day and eventually they\u2019ll become easier. Just- the world\nneeds heroes, I know it does. It\u2019s got Peter and it\u2019s got Rhodey \u2013 tell him I\nlove him so much, okay? Happy, too \u2013 but I just need you to know that there\u2019s-\nthere\u2019s a suit. I made it for emergencies. Like this one, I guess \u2013 and it\u2019s\nyours. You don\u2019t have to use it, but it\u2019s tailored for you. Ask FRIDAY for the\nRescue suit.\u201d</p><p>Pepper blinked at him. He\nmade her a suit. <i>He made her a suit.</i> \u201cRescue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cYou rescued\nme plenty of times. Felt right. Okay? Okay. I love you so much.\u201d He pressed\nanother kiss to her lips. \u201cI wish I could\u2019ve done everything with you. Kids,\ndog, goldfish.\u201d</p><p>They held each other. The\nthree of them. A tangled web of people who loved one another more than anything\nelse.</p><p>When the clock hit two\nminutes \u2013 Pepper watched it with bile in her mouth \u2013 she pulled away and walked\nto the door, where she picked up the gun. Colt revolver. Felt stupid that she\nknew the term. Felt stupid that she knew how to snap the barrel out of position\nand check the bullet was in the right chamber. Felt stupid that she could click\noff the safety with her thumb.</p><p>She kept her finger firmly\noff the trigger when she moved back.</p><p>She kissed Tony for all she\nwas worth, she held him as tight as she could.</p><p>\u201cI love you, I love you, I\nlove you,\u201d he muttered into her ear.</p><p>She sat back as he said his\nfinal goodbye to Peter.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Tony,\u201d Peter\nwhispered. \u201cYou\u2019re my dad, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know, Pete.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could save you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. You\u2019re going to be\namazing, Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for everything.\u201d</p><p>Pepper swallowed her sob. The\nclock hit <i>1:00. 00:59. 00:58.</i></p><p>Pepper pressed a final kiss against\nTony\u2019s lips. She savoured him for everything she was.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my everything,\u201d she\ntold him. \u201cIn my whole life, I\u2019ll never love anyone the way I love you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and it felt real. Pepper\nsat back on her knees, Peter leaning against her side. She checked the safety.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay not to be strong\nsometimes. It\u2019s okay.\u201d Tony nodded at Pepper, once, firm. \u201cLook after each\nother.\u201d</p><p>He shut his eyes as Pepper\nlifted the gun. She should\u2019ve known that he wouldn\u2019t want to see her at the\nother end of a revolver, pointed at his forehead. Peter sobbed suddenly, and\nPepper paused to pull him closer, a hand over his eyes, turning his head away\nfrom Tony Stark.</p><p>She should\u2019ve known when she\nwoke up that he would do this; that she would be pointing the gun and he would\nbe on the receiving end of the bullet.</p><p>She should\u2019ve known.</p><p>Tony Stark was nothing in not\na martyr. Was nothing if not a hero.</p><p>\u201cYou are so loved,\u201d Pepper\nsaid. She saw Tony\u2019s muscles relax. She pulled the trigger.</p><p>\u00a0-</p><p>\u00a0-</p><p>She stared at the space he\u2019d\nbeen, not at the space he now occupied.</p><p>The gun clattered to the\nfloor and Pepper pulled Peter in tighter, not letting him look at what she\u2019d\ndone. Her hands were clean but when she looked at them, they were so, so\nstained.</p><p>The clock hit <i>00:00 </i>and a buzz sounded, the door\nswinging open.</p><p>Pepper almost said <i>let\u2019s go home</i>, but the words died in her\nthroat. She\u2019d killed their home. Their home was lying in his own blood. </p><p>She\u2019d never be able to go\nhome again.</p>",

Consciousness was trying to elude her, and she barely\nhad the energy to grab onto it. <i>Ah \u2013 ah,\nthere.</i> A pain thumped around her head from where she\u2019d been knocked out and\nit spliced at her in a flashing red light.</p><p><i>There\nis one bullet.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p>No \u2013 the pain wasn\u2019t red. The\nred was coming from past her eyelids, pressing at them in repetitive pulses.\nRed. Red. Red.</p><p><i>You\nmay not shoot yourself.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p>Red. Red. Red. There was a\nwoman\u2019s voice, distant and monotone.

Air in. Air out. Pepper choked on it.</p><p><i>If\nno one is killed, you all die.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p>Her eyes shot open, gaze\nbouncing around grey concrete walls. The red was coming from a flashing light\nin a corner, far above her. The voice was clearer now.</p><p><i>You\nhave one hour.</i></p>[[MORE]]<p><br></p><p><i>Shit.\n</i>Shit, what? Pepper choked\nagain, rolling onto her back and staring up at the stained ceiling. Everything\nwas grey here; grey, red, grey, red. The voice started up again. Monotone,\nfemale, icy.</p><p><i>There\nis one gun.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p>Pepper swore as she pushed\nherself up into a seated position. This wasn\u2019t her world; wasn\u2019t her job. It\nwasn\u2019t like she\u2019d never been kidnapped before \u2013 Aldrich Killian came to mind \u2013\nbut it wasn\u2019t supposed to happen. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be a part of her\nreality. Grey walls, stained with something brown, a flashing red light. This\nwas not what she signed on for. She was a CEO, not a superhero \u2013 not, not-</p><p>\u201cTony.\u201d The word came out\nchoked as her eyes caught onto the body, slumped over nearby. Pepper scrambled\nover and before she\u2019d even reached his side, she saw the next body over.\n\u201cPeter. No, no, no-\u201d</p><p>Above her, the monotone voice\nrang out again and again. Pepper was close to shoving her fist through the wall\nto get at it, to choke the life from the woman who\u2019d sit down and record such a\nthing. The woman who must be watching them.</p><p>Pepper pushed the thought\nfrom her mind, climbing over Tony\u2019s body as soon as she\u2019d confirmed his pulse.\nOn her hands and knees, she moved to Peter\u2019s side, pulling him onto his back\nand searching his neck, his wrist.</p><p>\u201cCome on, come on, come on-\noh, thank God.\u201d It was slow but steady and Pepper relaxed back, her breathing\nalready pitched and difficult to even out. They were both alive. Tony and Peter\nwere both alive.</p><p><i>Well,\nnot for long.</i></p><p>Pepper\u2019s eyes alighted on the\ngun across the room and she stared at it as if it would shoot if she looked\naway. Pepper crawled to her feet, finding them bare and missing the high heels\nshe\u2019d been wearing when the world had shaken and gone suddenly dark, and\nstepped across the room, the concrete harsh and cold against her skin.</p><p>She knelt down by the gun,\neyeing the steel door it sat at the base of and the glowing red numbers of a\ncountdown that sat above the door frame. <i>59:23.</i></p><p>Pepper picked up the handgun,\nher fingers slipping across the dark metal. A Colt revolver, her mind supplied.\nShe moved her hands to the barrel \u2013 six cylinders \u2013 and swung it out to peer\ninside. </p><p><i>There\nis one bullet.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>You\ngot that right.</i> One bullet\nsat alone in the chamber and Pepper snapped the barrel back into place.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather you not use\nthat,\u201d a strained voice said from behind her. Pepper jumped with a sharp intake\nof breath, spinning to look at Tony, perched half up from where he was lying\nand moving to check Peter\u2019s breathing.</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d she replied. The\ngun felt too heavy in her hand, despite the single bullet. There was too much\npressure riding on it; too much unfortunate circumstance.</p><p>Pepper gently slipped the gun\nback onto the floor where she found it and moved back to Tony\u2019s side, running\nher thumb gently over the angry red bruise across his cheekbone. It looked\nworse with the flashing red light.</p><p>Tony looked to Pepper, jaw\ntense. \u201cI\u2019ll get us out of this.\u201d</p><p>She nodded once, silent. She\nknew he\u2019d try.</p><p><i>If\nno one is killed, you all die.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cI hope that shuts up soon,\u201d\nPepper said. \u201cThe light\u2019s giving me a headache.\u201d</p><p>Still it flashed on. Still\nthe voice continued on. Still Pepper worried her lower lip with her teeth and\npretended not to see the fear in Tony\u2019s eyes.</p><p>He was trying to open the\ndoor when Peter blinked awake at last, a groan at the back of his throat.</p><p>\u201cHey, sweetie,\u201d Pepper\nsmiled, cupping the back of his head as he tried to sit up. She let him use her\nto lean on and kept a hand in his unruly curls. </p><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d Peter moaned.\nHe used a fist to rub his eyes and Pepper\u2019s heart swelled at the innocence of\nthe action. <i>He\u2019s just a kid.</i>\nSometimes she\u2019d forget that when she watched Spiderman on the news; taking down\nthe Vulture, facing the Sinister Six, standing tall by Tony\u2019s side at whatever\nthreats came their way. Beneath that mask, he was seventeen, and he was a <i>child.</i></p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know,\u201d Pepper said.\n\u201cWe woke up here.\u201d</p><p>Peter frowned up at her as if\nnoticing her for the first time. This was fair. Pepper wasn\u2019t one to get\nkidnapped. In fact, she was the one who called the police or assembled the\nremaining Avengers whenever Peter and Tony got kidnapped \u2013 and they got\nkidnapped more than preferable.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked and <i>God, </i>Pepper loved this child.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m alright. What\nabout you? You must\u2019ve got knocked out hard.\u201d</p><p>Peter shrugged and tried to\nstraighten and move away from Pepper\u2019s side, but she kept her hand in his hair\nand he relaxed back into it anyway.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he said. \u201cI think\nthey got us when we were leaving school.\u201d</p><p>Pepper nodded. \u201cI was leaving\nwork,\u201d she said. \u201cDidn\u2019t make it to the car.\u201d</p><p>Tony had been standing by the\ndoor throughout, the clock ticking down already \u2013 an hour was such a short\namount of time \u2013 looking over his shoulder at them occasionally but trying to\nfind some purchase on the door. They all knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to open it\nwith brute strength \u2013 Peter neither, likely. People didn\u2019t kidnap superheroes\nwithout thinking it through.</p><p>\u201cGod, May\u2019s not going to even\nknow,\u201d Peter said suddenly, and Pepper frowned, actively trying not to think\nabout May, who was no doubt waiting for her <i>goodnight</i>\ntext as Peter was supposed to spend the weekend with Tony and Pepper. May who\nwas likely going to be a little worried without the text, more so the next day\nwhen she called and no one answered \u2013 who would be alone all weekend with no\nknowledge of what was going on.</p><p>Or, worse, May who was called\nby the police when someone reported an attack on Peter and Tony outside the\nschool, and was going to sit in a sick form of purgatory for the next while,\nunsure of the outcome.</p><p>Would it be all weekend? The\nclock only said an hour. Maybe it was an hour and then they\u2019d go \u2013 or, at\nleast, whoever was still alive.</p><p>When the clock reached <i>50:00, </i>the flashing red light stopped\nand the voice ceased. It was eerily quiet without them; with just the sounds of\ntheir hearts thumping against their ribcages and their breathing \u2013 a little too\nslow for the situation.</p><p>Peter tried to pull the door\nopen, but it wouldn\u2019t budge. Eventually, he slumped down in between Pepper and\nTony, who sat opposite the door, opposite the gun, opposite the clock.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d\nPeter asked then, and Pepper\u2019s heart sank into her gut because she didn\u2019t know.\nBecause she wasn\u2019t a superhero \u2013 she didn\u2019t <i>get\n</i>into these situations. She didn\u2019t know how to save the three of them, how\nto walk out of here just fine. She didn\u2019t even know if anyone was coming for\nthem-</p><p>Was this what it was like\nevery time? When Tony was stuck in Afghanistan, <i>sure</i> that no one would find him in a cave? When they were taken\nonly a few months previous and held in a chamber filled with masked men and\nblood-stained tiles? </p><p>Pepper had only felt a surety\nwhen she was kidnapped by Killian. She had no doubt in her mind that Tony would\ncome for her. Not just because he was Iron Man, Earth\u2019s mightiest defender, but\nbecause he was <i>Tony</i>, and he would\nnever let her die. He would never leave her to be alone. Even when her insides\nhad been boiling and Extremis had taken over, she\u2019d been sure he\u2019d come for\nher.</p><p>Even when she was falling\ninto the fire, she\u2019d been sure he\u2019d find a way to catch her, even if he didn\u2019t.\n</p><p>But this \u2013 this was\nuncertainty in its rawest form and it was terrifying. This was Peter\u2019s hand\nclutching at her own, his head tilted onto Tony\u2019s shoulder. This was silence,\nthe voice vanished, a dark room and a glowing red clock counting down to their\ndeaths. This was Pepper, not knowing if Rhodey was coming after them; if Vision\nwas in the country to do so; if the police or the military would even have a\nchance; if the Rogue Avengers would be notified and even <i>get here in time.</i></p><p>There was only an hour. Only\nTony Stark could mobilise the whole planet in an hour, and he was stuck in here\ntoo.</p><p>So no one answered Peter\u2019s\nquestion. No one told him what they were going to do, because there was nothing\n<i>to</i> do. It was shoot each other or die\nanyway. It was unload the only bullet in that gun into someone\u2019s head or be\nshot as a family instead.</p><p>But May didn\u2019t deserve that.\nMay didn\u2019t deserve to lose her only remaining family. She\u2019d already lost\nRichard and Mary, already lost Ben \u2013 Pepper couldn\u2019t let her lose her nephew\ntoo. She couldn\u2019t. She and May had a sort of friendship that <i>meant something</i> to Pepper; she\u2019d seen\nMay cry, seen May at Peter\u2019s bedside; seen her on bright days of sharing lunch\nat a caf\u00e9 and warm nights dancing in a lively bar.</p><p>Pepper looked over Peter\u2019s\nhead to Tony and found him already watching her. They couldn\u2019t let Peter die.\nThere was no question about that. This wasn\u2019t them waiting out the hour and\ndying together \u2013 this was saving Peter\u2019s life.</p><p>So it would be one of them. <i>Me or you.</i></p><p>Pepper blinked. <i>Me.</i></p><p>She and Tony stared at each\nother until the clock hit <i>30:00, </i>then\nPeter spoke up.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re going to kill us if\nwe don\u2019t do something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Tony\nreplied.</p><p>\u201cNo \u2013 no, it won\u2019t. We can\u2019t\njust- I won\u2019t let us all die here. That\u2019s stupid. That\u2019s not how this goes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t all die here,\u201d\nPepper replied. She couldn\u2019t say something placating like <i>I\u2019m sure someone will find us first</i> \u2013 because she didn\u2019t trust it.\nBecause there was half an hour on the clock and if they had a few days then\nmaybe she\u2019d hold out hope. Maybe she\u2019d say that Rhodey would get to them in\ntime \u2013 but with thirty minutes-</p><p>Pepper was going to have Tony\nshoot her in twenty-nine.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t all die here,\u201d she\nrepeated, because that was the truth.</p><p>The three of them fell quiet\nand Pepper leaned her head on Peter\u2019s shoulder and Tony reached his arm around\nboth of them, and Pepper let her eyes close so she could focus on the touch of\nTony\u2019s hand, warm and calloused and so familiar in all the ways Tony was always\nfamiliar.</p><p>\u201cYou should kill me,\u201d Peter\nsaid, and Pepper opened her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were a smart\nkid,\u201d Tony replied. \u201cThat\u2019s the dumbest thing you\u2019ve ever said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d Peter moved\nout from their grip and Pepper sat up before shifting closer to Tony because\nshe was going to die in twenty-nine \u2013 no, twenty-eight \u2013 minutes and she was\ngoing to touch him all she could until then. Maybe her spirit or her soul or\nwhatever part of her was eternal in the next life would still remember him,\nthen. Maybe she could relax into that touch when she was dead and gone and it\nwould still envelope her like Tony was doing now; his arm pulling her in close,\nhis free hand holding hers.</p><p>\u201cLook at you two,\u201d Peter\nsaid, throwing a hand out. He sat before them, all angles and limbs; a ratty\nt-shirt and a pair of jeans. Mis-matched socks on his feet. \u201cYou- you- you two\nhave your whole lives together. You\u2019re like twenty years in the making, you\u2019re\ngetting married in like a month! I can\u2019t! I can\u2019t let either of you die for\nme.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKid,\u201d Tony said, letting go\nof Pepper\u2019s hand to grab Peter\u2019s. \u201cYou\u2019re not dying today. Neither of us will\nallow that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have your whole life\nahead of you,\u201d Pepper agreed. \u201cYou\u2019re so young, you can do anything \u2013 and you\nwill! Tony\u2019s always going on about how you\u2019re gonna be the greatest mind the\nworld has ever seen-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Peter interrupted.\n\u201cIt\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s you two. It\u2019s always been you two. I don\u2019t want either of you\ndying for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell we\u2019re not having you\ndying for us,\u201d Tony replied.</p><p>They fell silent then and\nPepper caught sight of the tears welling in Peter\u2019s eyes. So young. So, so\nyoung.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d she said,\nopening her arms for him. Peter didn\u2019t waste time in falling into her embrace,\ncurling around her and Tony; the three of them a knot of limbs and desperation\nand determination not to cry.</p><p>Pepper pressed her lips\nagainst the crown of Peter\u2019s head, his hair soft against her cheeks. His\nshampoo was apple, she knew that like she knew Tony\u2019s was papaya, like her own\nwas mango. She let the first, lonely tear roll down her cheek and land in his\nhair.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be something\nincredible,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou really are. And we\u2019re not- we\u2019re not going to\nlet you end that today. Queens would be lost without you and so would May. You\ncan\u2019t \u2013 you can\u2019t do that to her, okay? I won\u2019t let you.</p><p>She felt the way he nodded,\nfelt the vibrations of his movements, of Tony\u2019s. Tony pressed a kiss against\nPeter\u2019s temple and said nothing. No words ever needed to be passed between\nthose two \u2013 they were a cohesive unit; bound by something like fate or destiny.\nIt hadn\u2019t been a coincidence that they\u2019d found each other and all three of them\nknew it.</p><p>So Pepper wouldn\u2019t let Tony\ndie today, because like May would be destroyed over Peter, Peter would be\nruined by Tony. Pepper wouldn\u2019t let that happen. She wouldn\u2019t let the brightest\nmind in New York lose his mentor, his father-figure, and she wouldn\u2019t let Tony\nlose the only child he\u2019s ever thought of as a son.</p><p>Pepper could write entire\nnovels of reasons why she wouldn\u2019t let Tony die today, but instead she stayed\nquiet, her cheek pressed against Peter\u2019s hair and Tony\u2019s forehead leant against\nher temple. </p><p>The clock hit <i>15:00 </i>when Tony moved at last. Pepper\nshifted to look him in the eye, and they just stared for a moment, committing\nthe way each other\u2019s lips tilted and their brows creased to their memories.\nTony had a small scar above his right eyebrow, a tiny mole on his jaw. She\nwasn\u2019t going to look away but her eyes shut on reflex when he moved in and\nkissed her, slow and sincere.</p><p>There were novels and\nscreenplays and academic essays on the reasons Pepper Potts loved Tony Stark;\non all the things that kiss was saying; on everything Pepper had wanted to tell\nhim, someday, but would now never get the chance.</p><p>When he pulled away, Tony\ncupped her face in his hand, tucked a strand of golden-blonde hair behind her\near and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to need you to shoot me, Pep.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw tensed. \u201cFuck that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPep-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She sat up, felt Peter try to\nmove too but kept him firmly in place, her arms tightening around him.</p><p>\u201cPepper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony.\u201d</p><p>There was a warning in their\nvoices.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not shooting you,\nPepper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019m not shooting you,\nso we\u2019re at a stalemate.\u201d</p><p>Tony sighed and Pepper knew\nthat sigh intimately. She knew them all. She knew the ones that were bored of\nwork, the ones that were annoyed about there being no milk in the fridge, the\nones that were frustrated that he wasn\u2019t being understood \u2013 this was one of\nthose. She stopped speaking out of reflex; knowing that when Tony sighed like\nthat, he wanted to explain.</p><p>\u201cPepper, I\u2019m not letting you\ndie today. I won\u2019t do it. I\u2019m not going to shoot you and Peter sure as hell\nisn\u2019t \u2013 I just.\u201d He reached out again, light knuckles on her cheek. \u201cI love you\nso much. You\u2019re it, Pepper. You\u2019re everything. I can\u2019t \u2013 I won\u2019t make it\nthrough losing you. That\u2019s a fact. If you die, I die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know this is shitty and\ndifficult, I do, but I can\u2019t be the one to kill you. I still see you falling\ninto the fire in my nightmares because <i>I </i>couldn\u2019t\ncatch you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony, I\u2019ll lose my mind if I\nhave to kill you today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPepper, you\u2019re the strongest\nperson I\u2019ve ever met. I\u2019m not saying this won\u2019t be fucking awful, but I know\nyou. You\u2019ll make it through. You\u2019ll do amazing things and-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot without you. <i>Tony.</i> I\u2019m not doing this. I\u2019m not shooting\nyou. You\u2019re going to shoot me, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot okay-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you die, the entire world\nloses you, Tony. If I die, it\u2019s just a company. But you \u2013 God, Tony. You never\ndid know how much you were worth. Even when you thought you were the hottest\nshit on Earth, you still thought you were only the kind of shit on someone\u2019s\nshoes. No \u2013 no, Tony. You\u2019re Iron Man. You\u2019re Tony Stark. You\u2019re the only one\nthis planet has that\u2019s going to defend it. You\u2019re the only one <i>I </i>have-\u201d</p><p>\u201cPep.\u201d</p><p>Pepper took a deep breath,\nswallowing. Her face was wet and tear-streaked, matching Tony\u2019s, and she\u2019d\nsomehow let go of Peter during the argument, and he was sitting back and\nstaring at them with wide, shining eyes. They were broken, all of them, facing\na demise that they had to choose.</p><p>\u201cLook at him,\u201d Pepper said,\nnodding to Peter. She watched Tony hesitate before he did. \u201cI can\u2019t help him\nlike you can. I can\u2019t <i>raise </i>him like\nyou can. He\u2019s going to take on the world and <i>I can\u2019t help him do that.</i> You can. You can teach him, Tony-\u201d</p><p>Tony choked down some kind of\nlaugh. \u201cYou\u2019re fucking guilting me using Peter?\u201d</p><p>Pepper bit her tongue and\nlocked her jaw, meeting his eye. But Tony wasn\u2019t angry, he was just deeply,\nhorribly sad and he scrubbed at his face, his hands coming back damp.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t fucking do this,\u201d\nTony said. \u201cI can\u2019t fucking do this. I don\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t want to leave either of\nyou, but I know, Pepper, I <i>know </i>I\nneed to be the one.\u201d He crawled closer, holding Pepper\u2019s face in his hands.\n\u201cThe past ten years of my life, it\u2019s been about saving people. I made Iron Man\nso people could be <i>safe.</i> So people\ncould be protected, and I could never do that if you weren\u2019t safe. If I\ncouldn\u2019t protect you. Pepper, if I don\u2019t protect you now, then- then-\u201d</p><p>Pepper kissed him. She kissed\nhim and she cried and she grabbed at him to pull him as tight as she could\nbecause it was just him. It was always him. It was always Tony.</p><p><i>There\nis one gun.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p>The voice started up suddenly\nand Pepper broke the kiss.</p><p><i>There\nis one bullet. You may not shoot yourself. Someone must die. If no one is\nkilled, you all die. You have ten minutes.</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p>Pepper jerked her gaze to the\nclock. <i>10:00. </i>The voice didn\u2019t repeat\nits message.</p><p>She turned back to Tony.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t kill her when\nkeeping her alive had been his goal for so long, and she couldn\u2019t kill him\nbecause she\u2019d shatter if she did.</p><p>Pepper pulled him into a hug,\na tight embrace where she held him with all her strength and felt him do the\nsame back.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she whispered.\n\u201cI love you more than anything.\u201d</p><p>Tony pressed his lips against\nher jaw, her cheek, her lips.</p><p>Peter was crying. When Pepper\nand Tony moved apart, she pulled Peter into her arms.</p><p>Tony shifted into the\nembrace, too, holding Peter close to his chest.</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve done so many\nthings better,\u201d Tony said and Pepper tried to memorise the way his voice lilted\nacross every word. His mother was a musician and she\u2019d passed that down to him.\nHe could play the piano with startling beauty, though she doubted he\u2019d ever\nshown anyone besides her. \u201cPeter, you\u2019re going to be the greatest hero of us\nall, okay? When you want it \u2013 <i>if </i>you\nwant it - the Avengers \u2013 they\u2019re yours. They\u2019re all yours. And SI. The\ncompany.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony-\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t \u2013 I can\u2019t do that.\nThat\u2019s yours, and Pepper\u2019s, and-\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, Pete. You\u2019re already\nnamed as the heir, okay? Pepper\u2019s gonna be with you every step of the way. You\ndon\u2019t have to take on the company until you want it, and even then Pepper\u2019s\ngonna keep CEO until you feel like you\u2019re ready for that. But, that\u2019s yours, if\nyou want that. Shit, shit \u2013 there\u2019s so many things I want to say. Kid, kid.\u201d\nTony moved until he was face-to-face with Peter, holding his shoulders. \u201cYou\u2019re\ngood enough. You\u2019re more than good enough. You\u2019re Peter Parker and you\u2019re the\nbest damn thing in this world and I love you so much. You\u2019re a son to me,\nPeter. I- I\u2019m so fucking grateful to have you in my life.\u201d</p><p>Peter barrelled himself into\nTony\u2019s chest and Pepper used the moment they held each other to swipe away the\ntears that were threatening to drown her. How could she agree to kill him? How\nwas she even going to manage it? Putting a gun to her fianc\u00e9\u2019s head and pulling\nthe trigger? It felt unexplainable; it felt impossible.</p><p>She swallowed down the vomit\nthreatening to rise and listened to Peter\u2019s whispered <i>I love you, I\u2019m sorry, Tony, Mr Stark, please, I can\u2019t-</i></p><p>\u201cYou can,\u201d Tony replied. \u201cYou\ncan do anything you set your mind to. Whatever you do in your life, I\u2019m proud\nof you. I am.\u201d</p><p>Peter stayed huddled against\nTony\u2019s chest, relishing in the last warmth he\u2019d ever have, when Tony met\nPepper\u2019s eye. \u201cI wish I could marry you,\u201d he said. \u201cI wish I could see you on\nour wedding day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already seen me in\nthe dress,\u201d Pepper said. \u201cIt\u2019s that Vera Wang one. You walked in when I was\ntrying it on and you choked and spilt your drink.\u201d Tony laughed for what it was\nworth, and Pepper smiled as best she could. \u201cThe moment you did that I was sold\non it.\u201d</p><p>She moved closer to the pair,\nsitting by Tony\u2019s side, turned to face him. She pressed her forehead into his\nshoulder as his free arm pulled her in.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the love of my life,\u201d\nhe said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the love of mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for saying yes to\nme. And for looking after me. For sticking by me through all my dumb shit, and\nfor kissing me for the first time in front of Rhodey.\u201d Pepper choked out a\nlaugh into his shoulder. \u201cI know this is gonna be awful, Pep. I know this is\ngonna suck a whole lot, and it\u2019s gonna suck for a while after too. But I know\nyou can get through it. I know you\u2019ll make it out the other side, and you\u2019ll\ncontinue to be the incredible woman that you\u2019ve always been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you to do me a\nfavour,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook after Peter for me.\u201d</p><p>She nodded into his shoulder.\n\u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a handful and he talks\na mile a minute and sometimes he gets stuck in his own web fluid. There\u2019s a few\nbottles of dissolvent in the lab, just ask FRIDAY where it is. I added a\nfeature to the mark 56, too, which can spray it. FRIDAY has the specs for that.\nKeep him safe, okay?\u201d</p><p>Pepper sniffed. \u201cI\u2019ll ask\nFRIDAY to make me one of those stalker apps where I track his vitals all hours\nof the day.\u201d</p><p>Even Peter laughed into\nTony\u2019s chest.</p><p>Tony smiled and pressed a\nkiss into her hair. \u201cThank you. And you look out for Pepper, okay kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Mr Stark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we were at Tony!\nPeter! Come on!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry Tony,\u201d Peter replied,\nhis voice muffled.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s better.\u201d</p><p>They were quiet for a moment\nand Pepper lifted her head, sparing a glance at the clock on the wall. <i>4:51. </i>\u201cThere\u2019s only one Tony Stark,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cOnly one you. Tony, you\u2019re my favourite person and I\u2019m <i>so</i> thankful, every day, that you\u2019re in\nmy life. I know the world\u2019s going to miss you and they\u2019re going to miss Iron\nMan \u2013 but I can\u2019t <i>imagine </i>my life\nwithout you. I can\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t know how-\u201d</p><p>\u201cPepper.\u201d Tony\u2019s voice was\nsoft, his hand in her hair. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s alright. You\u2019ll be okay. Focus on\ngetting through each day and eventually they\u2019ll become easier. Just- the world\nneeds heroes, I know it does. It\u2019s got Peter and it\u2019s got Rhodey \u2013 tell him I\nlove him so much, okay? Happy, too \u2013 but I just need you to know that there\u2019s-\nthere\u2019s a suit. I made it for emergencies. Like this one, I guess \u2013 and it\u2019s\nyours. You don\u2019t have to use it, but it\u2019s tailored for you. Ask FRIDAY for the\nRescue suit.\u201d</p><p>Pepper blinked at him. He\nmade her a suit. <i>He made her a suit.</i> \u201cRescue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cYou rescued\nme plenty of times. Felt right. Okay? Okay. I love you so much.\u201d He pressed\nanother kiss to her lips. \u201cI wish I could\u2019ve done everything with you. Kids,\ndog, goldfish.\u201d</p><p>They held each other. The\nthree of them. A tangled web of people who loved one another more than anything\nelse.</p><p>When the clock hit two\nminutes \u2013 Pepper watched it with bile in her mouth \u2013 she pulled away and walked\nto the door, where she picked up the gun. Colt revolver. Felt stupid that she\nknew the term. Felt stupid that she knew how to snap the barrel out of position\nand check the bullet was in the right chamber. Felt stupid that she could click\noff the safety with her thumb.</p><p>She kept her finger firmly\noff the trigger when she moved back.</p><p>She kissed Tony for all she\nwas worth, she held him as tight as she could.</p><p>\u201cI love you, I love you, I\nlove you,\u201d he muttered into her ear.</p><p>She sat back as he said his\nfinal goodbye to Peter.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Tony,\u201d Peter\nwhispered. \u201cYou\u2019re my dad, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know, Pete.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could save you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. You\u2019re going to be\namazing, Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for everything.\u201d</p><p>Pepper swallowed her sob. The\nclock hit <i>1:00. 00:59. 00:58.</i></p><p>Pepper pressed a final kiss against\nTony\u2019s lips. She savoured him for everything she was.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my everything,\u201d she\ntold him. \u201cIn my whole life, I\u2019ll never love anyone the way I love you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and it felt real. Pepper\nsat back on her knees, Peter leaning against her side. She checked the safety.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay not to be strong\nsometimes. It\u2019s okay.\u201d Tony nodded at Pepper, once, firm. \u201cLook after each\nother.\u201d</p><p>He shut his eyes as Pepper\nlifted the gun. She should\u2019ve known that he wouldn\u2019t want to see her at the\nother end of a revolver, pointed at his forehead. Peter sobbed suddenly, and\nPepper paused to pull him closer, a hand over his eyes, turning his head away\nfrom Tony Stark.</p><p>She should\u2019ve known when she\nwoke up that he would do this; that she would be pointing the gun and he would\nbe on the receiving end of the bullet.</p><p>She should\u2019ve known.</p><p>Tony Stark was nothing in not\na martyr. Was nothing if not a hero.</p><p>\u201cYou are so loved,\u201d Pepper\nsaid. She saw Tony\u2019s muscles relax. She pulled the trigger.</p><p>\u00a0-</p><p>\u00a0-</p><p>She stared at the space he\u2019d\nbeen, not at the space he now occupied.</p><p>The gun clattered to the\nfloor and Pepper pulled Peter in tighter, not letting him look at what she\u2019d\ndone. Her hands were clean but when she looked at them, they were so, so\nstained.</p><p>The clock hit <i>00:00 </i>and a buzz sounded, the door\nswinging open.</p><p>Pepper almost said <i>let\u2019s go home</i>, but the words died in her\nthroat. She\u2019d killed their home. Their home was lying in his own blood. </p><p>She\u2019d never be able to go\nhome again.</p>",

Consciousness was trying to elude her, and she barely\nhad the energy to grab onto it. <i>Ah &ndash; ah,\nthere.</i> A pain thumped around her head from where she&rsquo;d been knocked out and\nit spliced at her in a flashing red light.</p><p><i>There\nis one bullet.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>No &ndash; the pain wasn&rsquo;t red. The\nred was coming from past her eyelids, pressing at them in repetitive pulses.\nRed. Red. Red.</p><p><i>You\nmay not shoot yourself.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>Red. Red. Red. There was a\nwoman&rsquo;s voice, distant and monotone. It was far underwater &ndash; or maybe she was;\nmaybe she was beneath miles of water and this voice was on dry land.</p><p><i>Someone\nmust die.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>She was breathing though, and\nno water was filling her lungs. Air in. Air out. Pepper choked on it.</p><p><i>If\nno one is killed, you all die.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>Her eyes shot open, gaze\nbouncing around grey concrete walls. The red was coming from a flashing light\nin a corner, far above her. The voice was clearer now.</p><p><i>You\nhave one hour.</i></p><p><br /></p><p><i>Shit.\n</i>Shit, what? Pepper choked\nagain, rolling onto her back and staring up at the stained ceiling. Everything\nwas grey here; grey, red, grey, red. The voice started up again. Monotone,\nfemale, icy.</p><p><i>There\nis one gun.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>Pepper swore as she pushed\nherself up into a seated position. This wasn&rsquo;t her world; wasn&rsquo;t her job. It\nwasn&rsquo;t like she&rsquo;d never been kidnapped before &ndash; Aldrich Killian came to mind &ndash;\nbut it wasn&rsquo;t supposed to happen. It wasn&rsquo;t supposed to be a part of her\nreality. Grey walls, stained with something brown, a flashing red light. This\nwas not what she signed on for. She was a CEO, not a superhero &ndash; not, not-</p><p>&ldquo;Tony.&rdquo; The word came out\nchoked as her eyes caught onto the body, slumped over nearby. Pepper scrambled\nover and before she&rsquo;d even reached his side, she saw the next body over.\n&ldquo;Peter. No, no, no-&rdquo;</p><p>Above her, the monotone voice\nrang out again and again. Pepper was close to shoving her fist through the wall\nto get at it, to choke the life from the woman who&rsquo;d sit down and record such a\nthing. The woman who must be watching them.</p><p>Pepper pushed the thought\nfrom her mind, climbing over Tony&rsquo;s body as soon as she&rsquo;d confirmed his pulse.\nOn her hands and knees, she moved to Peter&rsquo;s side, pulling him onto his back\nand searching his neck, his wrist.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, come on, come on-\noh, thank God.&rdquo; It was slow but steady and Pepper relaxed back, her breathing\nalready pitched and difficult to even out. They were both alive. Tony and Peter\nwere both alive.</p><p><i>Well,\nnot for long.</i></p><p>Pepper&rsquo;s eyes alighted on the\ngun across the room and she stared at it as if it would shoot if she looked\naway. Pepper crawled to her feet, finding them bare and missing the high heels\nshe&rsquo;d been wearing when the world had shaken and gone suddenly dark, and\nstepped across the room, the concrete harsh and cold against her skin.</p><p>She knelt down by the gun,\neyeing the steel door it sat at the base of and the glowing red numbers of a\ncountdown that sat above the door frame. <i>59:23.</i></p><p>Pepper picked up the handgun,\nher fingers slipping across the dark metal. A Colt revolver, her mind supplied.\nShe moved her hands to the barrel &ndash; six cylinders &ndash; and swung it out to peer\ninside. </p><p><i>There\nis one bullet.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>You\ngot that right.</i> One bullet\nsat alone in the chamber and Pepper snapped the barrel back into place.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather you not use\nthat,&rdquo; a strained voice said from behind her. Pepper jumped with a sharp intake\nof breath, spinning to look at Tony, perched half up from where he was lying\nand moving to check Peter&rsquo;s breathing.</p><p>&ldquo;I agree,&rdquo; she replied. The\ngun felt too heavy in her hand, despite the single bullet. There was too much\npressure riding on it; too much unfortunate circumstance.</p><p>Pepper gently slipped the gun\nback onto the floor where she found it and moved back to Tony&rsquo;s side, running\nher thumb gently over the angry red bruise across his cheekbone. It looked\nworse with the flashing red light.</p><p>Tony looked to Pepper, jaw\ntense. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get us out of this.&rdquo;</p><p>She nodded once, silent. She\nknew he&rsquo;d try.</p><p><i>If\nno one is killed, you all die.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>&ldquo;I hope that shuts up soon,&rdquo;\nPepper said. &ldquo;The light&rsquo;s giving me a headache.&rdquo;</p><p>Still it flashed on. Still\nthe voice continued on. Still Pepper worried her lower lip with her teeth and\npretended not to see the fear in Tony&rsquo;s eyes.</p><p>He was trying to open the\ndoor when Peter blinked awake at last, a groan at the back of his throat.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, sweetie,&rdquo; Pepper\nsmiled, cupping the back of his head as he tried to sit up. She let him use her\nto lean on and kept a hand in his unruly curls. </p><p>&ldquo;Where are we?&rdquo; Peter moaned.\nHe used a fist to rub his eyes and Pepper&rsquo;s heart swelled at the innocence of\nthe action. <i>He&rsquo;s just a kid.</i>\nSometimes she&rsquo;d forget that when she watched Spiderman on the news; taking down\nthe Vulture, facing the Sinister Six, standing tall by Tony&rsquo;s side at whatever\nthreats came their way. Beneath that mask, he was seventeen, and he was a <i>child.</i></p><p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Pepper said.\n&ldquo;We woke up here.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter frowned up at her as if\nnoticing her for the first time. This was fair. Pepper wasn&rsquo;t one to get\nkidnapped. In fact, she was the one who called the police or assembled the\nremaining Avengers whenever Peter and Tony got kidnapped &ndash; and they got\nkidnapped more than preferable.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; he asked and <i>God, </i>Pepper loved this child.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. I&rsquo;m alright. What\nabout you? You must&rsquo;ve got knocked out hard.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter shrugged and tried to\nstraighten and move away from Pepper&rsquo;s side, but she kept her hand in his hair\nand he relaxed back into it anyway.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I think\nthey got us when we were leaving school.&rdquo;</p><p>Pepper nodded. &ldquo;I was leaving\nwork,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t make it to the car.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony had been standing by the\ndoor throughout, the clock ticking down already &ndash; an hour was such a short\namount of time &ndash; looking over his shoulder at them occasionally but trying to\nfind some purchase on the door. They all knew he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to open it\nwith brute strength &ndash; Peter neither, likely. People didn&rsquo;t kidnap superheroes\nwithout thinking it through.</p><p>&ldquo;God, May&rsquo;s not going to even\nknow,&rdquo; Peter said suddenly, and Pepper frowned, actively trying not to think\nabout May, who was no doubt waiting for her <i>goodnight</i>\ntext as Peter was supposed to spend the weekend with Tony and Pepper. May who\nwas likely going to be a little worried without the text, more so the next day\nwhen she called and no one answered &ndash; who would be alone all weekend with no\nknowledge of what was going on.</p><p>Or, worse, May who was called\nby the police when someone reported an attack on Peter and Tony outside the\nschool, and was going to sit in a sick form of purgatory for the next while,\nunsure of the outcome.</p><p>Would it be all weekend? The\nclock only said an hour. Maybe it was an hour and then they&rsquo;d go &ndash; or, at\nleast, whoever was still alive.</p><p>When the clock reached <i>50:00, </i>the flashing red light stopped\nand the voice ceased. It was eerily quiet without them; with just the sounds of\ntheir hearts thumping against their ribcages and their breathing &ndash; a little too\nslow for the situation.</p><p>Peter tried to pull the door\nopen, but it wouldn&rsquo;t budge. Eventually, he slumped down in between Pepper and\nTony, who sat opposite the door, opposite the gun, opposite the clock.</p><p>&ldquo;What are we going to do?&rdquo;\nPeter asked then, and Pepper&rsquo;s heart sank into her gut because she didn&rsquo;t know.\nBecause she wasn&rsquo;t a superhero &ndash; she didn&rsquo;t <i>get\n</i>into these situations. She didn&rsquo;t know how to save the three of them, how\nto walk out of here just fine. She didn&rsquo;t even know if anyone was coming for\nthem-</p><p>Was this what it was like\nevery time? When Tony was stuck in Afghanistan, <i>sure</i> that no one would find him in a cave? When they were taken\nonly a few months previous and held in a chamber filled with masked men and\nblood-stained tiles? </p><p>Pepper had only felt a surety\nwhen she was kidnapped by Killian. She had no doubt in her mind that Tony would\ncome for her. Not just because he was Iron Man, Earth&rsquo;s mightiest defender, but\nbecause he was <i>Tony</i>, and he would\nnever let her die. He would never leave her to be alone. Even when her insides\nhad been boiling and Extremis had taken over, she&rsquo;d been sure he&rsquo;d come for\nher.</p><p>Even when she was falling\ninto the fire, she&rsquo;d been sure he&rsquo;d find a way to catch her, even if he didn&rsquo;t.\n</p><p>But this &ndash; this was\nuncertainty in its rawest form and it was terrifying. This was Peter&rsquo;s hand\nclutching at her own, his head tilted onto Tony&rsquo;s shoulder. This was silence,\nthe voice vanished, a dark room and a glowing red clock counting down to their\ndeaths. This was Pepper, not knowing if Rhodey was coming after them; if Vision\nwas in the country to do so; if the police or the military would even have a\nchance; if the Rogue Avengers would be notified and even <i>get here in time.</i></p><p>There was only an hour. Only\nTony Stark could mobilise the whole planet in an hour, and he was stuck in here\ntoo.</p><p>So no one answered Peter&rsquo;s\nquestion. No one told him what they were going to do, because there was nothing\n<i>to</i> do. It was shoot each other or die\nanyway. It was unload the only bullet in that gun into someone&rsquo;s head or be\nshot as a family instead.</p><p>But May didn&rsquo;t deserve that.\nMay didn&rsquo;t deserve to lose her only remaining family. She&rsquo;d already lost\nRichard and Mary, already lost Ben &ndash; Pepper couldn&rsquo;t let her lose her nephew\ntoo. She couldn&rsquo;t. She and May had a sort of friendship that <i>meant something</i> to Pepper; she&rsquo;d seen\nMay cry, seen May at Peter&rsquo;s bedside; seen her on bright days of sharing lunch\nat a caf&eacute; and warm nights dancing in a lively bar.</p><p>Pepper looked over Peter&rsquo;s\nhead to Tony and found him already watching her. They couldn&rsquo;t let Peter die.\nThere was no question about that. This wasn&rsquo;t them waiting out the hour and\ndying together &ndash; this was saving Peter&rsquo;s life.</p><p>So it would be one of them. <i>Me or you.</i></p><p>Pepper blinked. <i>Me.</i></p><p>She and Tony stared at each\nother until the clock hit <i>30:00, </i>then\nPeter spoke up.</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re going to kill us if\nwe don&rsquo;t do something.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be fine,&rdquo; Tony\nreplied.</p><p>&ldquo;No &ndash; no, it won&rsquo;t. We can&rsquo;t\njust- I won&rsquo;t let us all die here. That&rsquo;s stupid. That&rsquo;s not how this goes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t all die here,&rdquo;\nPepper replied. She couldn&rsquo;t say something placating like <i>I&rsquo;m sure someone will find us first</i> &ndash; because she didn&rsquo;t trust it.\nBecause there was half an hour on the clock and if they had a few days then\nmaybe she&rsquo;d hold out hope. Maybe she&rsquo;d say that Rhodey would get to them in\ntime &ndash; but with thirty minutes-</p><p>Pepper was going to have Tony\nshoot her in twenty-nine.</p><p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t all die here,&rdquo; she\nrepeated, because that was the truth.</p><p>The three of them fell quiet\nand Pepper leaned her head on Peter&rsquo;s shoulder and Tony reached his arm around\nboth of them, and Pepper let her eyes close so she could focus on the touch of\nTony&rsquo;s hand, warm and calloused and so familiar in all the ways Tony was always\nfamiliar.</p><p>&ldquo;You should kill me,&rdquo; Peter\nsaid, and Pepper opened her eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;I thought you were a smart\nkid,&rdquo; Tony replied. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the dumbest thing you&rsquo;ve ever said.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m serious.&rdquo; Peter moved\nout from their grip and Pepper sat up before shifting closer to Tony because\nshe was going to die in twenty-nine &ndash; no, twenty-eight &ndash; minutes and she was\ngoing to touch him all she could until then. Maybe her spirit or her soul or\nwhatever part of her was eternal in the next life would still remember him,\nthen. Maybe she could relax into that touch when she was dead and gone and it\nwould still envelope her like Tony was doing now; his arm pulling her in close,\nhis free hand holding hers.</p><p>&ldquo;Look at you two,&rdquo; Peter\nsaid, throwing a hand out. He sat before them, all angles and limbs; a ratty\nt-shirt and a pair of jeans. Mis-matched socks on his feet. &ldquo;You- you- you two\nhave your whole lives together. You&rsquo;re like twenty years in the making, you&rsquo;re\ngetting married in like a month! I can&rsquo;t! I can&rsquo;t let either of you die for\nme.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Kid,&rdquo; Tony said, letting go\nof Pepper&rsquo;s hand to grab Peter&rsquo;s. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not dying today. Neither of us will\nallow that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You have your whole life\nahead of you,&rdquo; Pepper agreed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re so young, you can do anything &ndash; and you\nwill! Tony&rsquo;s always going on about how you&rsquo;re gonna be the greatest mind the\nworld has ever seen-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Peter interrupted.\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s &ndash; it&rsquo;s you two. It&rsquo;s always been you two. I don&rsquo;t want either of you\ndying for me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well we&rsquo;re not having you\ndying for us,&rdquo; Tony replied.</p><p>They fell silent then and\nPepper caught sight of the tears welling in Peter&rsquo;s eyes. So young. So, so\nyoung.</p><p>&ldquo;Come here,&rdquo; she said,\nopening her arms for him. Peter didn&rsquo;t waste time in falling into her embrace,\ncurling around her and Tony; the three of them a knot of limbs and desperation\nand determination not to cry.</p><p>Pepper pressed her lips\nagainst the crown of Peter&rsquo;s head, his hair soft against her cheeks. His\nshampoo was apple, she knew that like she knew Tony&rsquo;s was papaya, like her own\nwas mango. She let the first, lonely tear roll down her cheek and land in his\nhair.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to be something\nincredible,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;You really are. And we&rsquo;re not- we&rsquo;re not going to\nlet you end that today. Queens would be lost without you and so would May. You\ncan&rsquo;t &ndash; you can&rsquo;t do that to her, okay? I won&rsquo;t let you.</p><p>She felt the way he nodded,\nfelt the vibrations of his movements, of Tony&rsquo;s. Tony pressed a kiss against\nPeter&rsquo;s temple and said nothing. No words ever needed to be passed between\nthose two &ndash; they were a cohesive unit; bound by something like fate or destiny.\nIt hadn&rsquo;t been a coincidence that they&rsquo;d found each other and all three of them\nknew it.</p><p>So Pepper wouldn&rsquo;t let Tony\ndie today, because like May would be destroyed over Peter, Peter would be\nruined by Tony. Pepper wouldn&rsquo;t let that happen. She wouldn&rsquo;t let the brightest\nmind in New York lose his mentor, his father-figure, and she wouldn&rsquo;t let Tony\nlose the only child he&rsquo;s ever thought of as a son.</p><p>Pepper could write entire\nnovels of reasons why she wouldn&rsquo;t let Tony die today, but instead she stayed\nquiet, her cheek pressed against Peter&rsquo;s hair and Tony&rsquo;s forehead leant against\nher temple. </p><p>The clock hit <i>15:00 </i>when Tony moved at last. Pepper\nshifted to look him in the eye, and they just stared for a moment, committing\nthe way each other&rsquo;s lips tilted and their brows creased to their memories.\nTony had a small scar above his right eyebrow, a tiny mole on his jaw. She\nwasn&rsquo;t going to look away but her eyes shut on reflex when he moved in and\nkissed her, slow and sincere.</p><p>There were novels and\nscreenplays and academic essays on the reasons Pepper Potts loved Tony Stark;\non all the things that kiss was saying; on everything Pepper had wanted to tell\nhim, someday, but would now never get the chance.</p><p>When he pulled away, Tony\ncupped her face in his hand, tucked a strand of golden-blonde hair behind her\near and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to need you to shoot me, Pep.&rdquo;</p><p>Her jaw tensed. &ldquo;Fuck that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pep-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>She sat up, felt Peter try to\nmove too but kept him firmly in place, her arms tightening around him.</p><p>&ldquo;Pepper.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony.&rdquo;</p><p>There was a warning in their\nvoices.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not shooting you,\nPepper.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well I&rsquo;m not shooting you,\nso we&rsquo;re at a stalemate.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony sighed and Pepper knew\nthat sigh intimately. She knew them all. She knew the ones that were bored of\nwork, the ones that were annoyed about there being no milk in the fridge, the\nones that were frustrated that he wasn&rsquo;t being understood &ndash; this was one of\nthose. She stopped speaking out of reflex; knowing that when Tony sighed like\nthat, he wanted to explain.</p><p>&ldquo;Pepper, I&rsquo;m not letting you\ndie today. I won&rsquo;t do it. I&rsquo;m not going to shoot you and Peter sure as hell\nisn&rsquo;t &ndash; I just.&rdquo; He reached out again, light knuckles on her cheek. &ldquo;I love you\nso much. You&rsquo;re it, Pepper. You&rsquo;re everything. I can&rsquo;t &ndash; I won&rsquo;t make it\nthrough losing you. That&rsquo;s a fact. If you die, I die.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know this is shitty and\ndifficult, I do, but I can&rsquo;t be the one to kill you. I still see you falling\ninto the fire in my nightmares because <i>I </i>couldn&rsquo;t\ncatch you-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony, I&rsquo;ll lose my mind if I\nhave to kill you today.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pepper, you&rsquo;re the strongest\nperson I&rsquo;ve ever met. I&rsquo;m not saying this won&rsquo;t be fucking awful, but I know\nyou. You&rsquo;ll make it through. You&rsquo;ll do amazing things and-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not without you. <i>Tony.</i> I&rsquo;m not doing this. I&rsquo;m not shooting\nyou. You&rsquo;re going to shoot me, okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not okay-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If you die, the entire world\nloses you, Tony. If I die, it&rsquo;s just a company. But you &ndash; God, Tony. You never\ndid know how much you were worth. Even when you thought you were the hottest\nshit on Earth, you still thought you were only the kind of shit on someone&rsquo;s\nshoes. No &ndash; no, Tony. You&rsquo;re Iron Man. You&rsquo;re Tony Stark. You&rsquo;re the only one\nthis planet has that&rsquo;s going to defend it. You&rsquo;re the only one <i>I </i>have-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pep.&rdquo;</p><p>Pepper took a deep breath,\nswallowing. Her face was wet and tear-streaked, matching Tony&rsquo;s, and she&rsquo;d\nsomehow let go of Peter during the argument, and he was sitting back and\nstaring at them with wide, shining eyes. They were broken, all of them, facing\na demise that they had to choose.</p><p>&ldquo;Look at him,&rdquo; Pepper said,\nnodding to Peter. She watched Tony hesitate before he did. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help him\nlike you can. I can&rsquo;t <i>raise </i>him like\nyou can. He&rsquo;s going to take on the world and <i>I can&rsquo;t help him do that.</i> You can. You can teach him, Tony-&rdquo;</p><p>Tony choked down some kind of\nlaugh. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re fucking guilting me using Peter?&rdquo;</p><p>Pepper bit her tongue and\nlocked her jaw, meeting his eye. But Tony wasn&rsquo;t angry, he was just deeply,\nhorribly sad and he scrubbed at his face, his hands coming back damp.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t fucking do this,&rdquo;\nTony said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t fucking do this. I don&rsquo;t &ndash; I don&rsquo;t want to leave either of\nyou, but I know, Pepper, I <i>know </i>I\nneed to be the one.&rdquo; He crawled closer, holding Pepper&rsquo;s face in his hands.\n&ldquo;The past ten years of my life, it&rsquo;s been about saving people. I made Iron Man\nso people could be <i>safe.</i> So people\ncould be protected, and I could never do that if you weren&rsquo;t safe. If I\ncouldn&rsquo;t protect you. Pepper, if I don&rsquo;t protect you now, then- then-&rdquo;</p><p>Pepper kissed him. She kissed\nhim and she cried and she grabbed at him to pull him as tight as she could\nbecause it was just him. It was always him. It was always Tony.</p><p><i>There\nis one gun.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>The voice started up suddenly\nand Pepper broke the kiss.</p><p><i>There\nis one bullet. You may not shoot yourself. Someone must die. If no one is\nkilled, you all die. You have ten minutes.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>Pepper jerked her gaze to the\nclock. <i>10:00. </i>The voice didn&rsquo;t repeat\nits message.</p><p>She turned back to Tony.</p><p>He couldn&rsquo;t kill her when\nkeeping her alive had been his goal for so long, and she couldn&rsquo;t kill him\nbecause she&rsquo;d shatter if she did.</p><p>Pepper pulled him into a hug,\na tight embrace where she held him with all her strength and felt him do the\nsame back.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; she whispered.\n&ldquo;I love you more than anything.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony pressed his lips against\nher jaw, her cheek, her lips.</p><p>Peter was crying. When Pepper\nand Tony moved apart, she pulled Peter into her arms.</p><p>Tony shifted into the\nembrace, too, holding Peter close to his chest.</p><p>&ldquo;I should&rsquo;ve done so many\nthings better,&rdquo; Tony said and Pepper tried to memorise the way his voice lilted\nacross every word. His mother was a musician and she&rsquo;d passed that down to him.\nHe could play the piano with startling beauty, though she doubted he&rsquo;d ever\nshown anyone besides her. &ldquo;Peter, you&rsquo;re going to be the greatest hero of us\nall, okay? When you want it &ndash; <i>if </i>you\nwant it - the Avengers &ndash; they&rsquo;re yours. They&rsquo;re all yours. And SI. The\ncompany.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t &ndash; I can&rsquo;t do that.\nThat&rsquo;s yours, and Pepper&rsquo;s, and-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck, Pete. You&rsquo;re already\nnamed as the heir, okay? Pepper&rsquo;s gonna be with you every step of the way. You\ndon&rsquo;t have to take on the company until you want it, and even then Pepper&rsquo;s\ngonna keep CEO until you feel like you&rsquo;re ready for that. But, that&rsquo;s yours, if\nyou want that. Shit, shit &ndash; there&rsquo;s so many things I want to say. Kid, kid.&rdquo;\nTony moved until he was face-to-face with Peter, holding his shoulders. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re\ngood enough. You&rsquo;re more than good enough. You&rsquo;re Peter Parker and you&rsquo;re the\nbest damn thing in this world and I love you so much. You&rsquo;re a son to me,\nPeter. I- I&rsquo;m so fucking grateful to have you in my life.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter barrelled himself into\nTony&rsquo;s chest and Pepper used the moment they held each other to swipe away the\ntears that were threatening to drown her. How could she agree to kill him? How\nwas she even going to manage it? Putting a gun to her fianc&eacute;&rsquo;s head and pulling\nthe trigger? It felt unexplainable; it felt impossible.</p><p>She swallowed down the vomit\nthreatening to rise and listened to Peter&rsquo;s whispered <i>I love you, I&rsquo;m sorry, Tony, Mr Stark, please, I can&rsquo;t-</i></p><p>&ldquo;You can,&rdquo; Tony replied. &ldquo;You\ncan do anything you set your mind to. Whatever you do in your life, I&rsquo;m proud\nof you. I am.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter stayed huddled against\nTony&rsquo;s chest, relishing in the last warmth he&rsquo;d ever have, when Tony met\nPepper&rsquo;s eye. &ldquo;I wish I could marry you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I wish I could see you on\nour wedding day.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve already seen me in\nthe dress,&rdquo; Pepper said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s that Vera Wang one. You walked in when I was\ntrying it on and you choked and spilt your drink.&rdquo; Tony laughed for what it was\nworth, and Pepper smiled as best she could. &ldquo;The moment you did that I was sold\non it.&rdquo;</p><p>She moved closer to the pair,\nsitting by Tony&rsquo;s side, turned to face him. She pressed her forehead into his\nshoulder as his free arm pulled her in.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the love of my life,&rdquo;\nhe said.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the love of mine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you for saying yes to\nme. And for looking after me. For sticking by me through all my dumb shit, and\nfor kissing me for the first time in front of Rhodey.&rdquo; Pepper choked out a\nlaugh into his shoulder. &ldquo;I know this is gonna be awful, Pep. I know this is\ngonna suck a whole lot, and it&rsquo;s gonna suck for a while after too. But I know\nyou can get through it. I know you&rsquo;ll make it out the other side, and you&rsquo;ll\ncontinue to be the incredible woman that you&rsquo;ve always been.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I need you to do me a\nfavour,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;Anything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Look after Peter for me.&rdquo;</p><p>She nodded into his shoulder.\n&ldquo;Anything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a handful and he talks\na mile a minute and sometimes he gets stuck in his own web fluid. There&rsquo;s a few\nbottles of dissolvent in the lab, just ask FRIDAY where it is. I added a\nfeature to the mark 56, too, which can spray it. FRIDAY has the specs for that.\nKeep him safe, okay?&rdquo;</p><p>Pepper sniffed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask\nFRIDAY to make me one of those stalker apps where I track his vitals all hours\nof the day.&rdquo;</p><p>Even Peter laughed into\nTony&rsquo;s chest.</p><p>Tony smiled and pressed a\nkiss into her hair. &ldquo;Thank you. And you look out for Pepper, okay kid?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, Mr Stark.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I thought we were at Tony!\nPeter! Come on!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry Tony,&rdquo; Peter replied,\nhis voice muffled.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better.&rdquo;</p><p>They were quiet for a moment\nand Pepper lifted her head, sparing a glance at the clock on the wall. <i>4:51. </i>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one Tony Stark,&rdquo; she\nsaid. &ldquo;Only one you. Tony, you&rsquo;re my favourite person and I&rsquo;m <i>so</i> thankful, every day, that you&rsquo;re in\nmy life. I know the world&rsquo;s going to miss you and they&rsquo;re going to miss Iron\nMan &ndash; but I can&rsquo;t <i>imagine </i>my life\nwithout you. I can&rsquo;t &ndash; I don&rsquo;t know how-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pepper.&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s voice was\nsoft, his hand in her hair. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. It&rsquo;s alright. You&rsquo;ll be okay. Focus on\ngetting through each day and eventually they&rsquo;ll become easier. Just- the world\nneeds heroes, I know it does. It&rsquo;s got Peter and it&rsquo;s got Rhodey &ndash; tell him I\nlove him so much, okay? Happy, too &ndash; but I just need you to know that there&rsquo;s-\nthere&rsquo;s a suit. I made it for emergencies. Like this one, I guess &ndash; and it&rsquo;s\nyours. You don&rsquo;t have to use it, but it&rsquo;s tailored for you. Ask FRIDAY for the\nRescue suit.&rdquo;</p><p>Pepper blinked at him. He\nmade her a suit. <i>He made her a suit.</i> &ldquo;Rescue?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You rescued\nme plenty of times. Felt right. Okay? Okay. I love you so much.&rdquo; He pressed\nanother kiss to her lips. &ldquo;I wish I could&rsquo;ve done everything with you. Kids,\ndog, goldfish.&rdquo;</p><p>They held each other. The\nthree of them. A tangled web of people who loved one another more than anything\nelse.</p><p>When the clock hit two\nminutes &ndash; Pepper watched it with bile in her mouth &ndash; she pulled away and walked\nto the door, where she picked up the gun. Colt revolver. Felt stupid that she\nknew the term. Felt stupid that she knew how to snap the barrel out of position\nand check the bullet was in the right chamber. Felt stupid that she could click\noff the safety with her thumb.</p><p>She kept her finger firmly\noff the trigger when she moved back.</p><p>She kissed Tony for all she\nwas worth, she held him as tight as she could.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you, I love you, I\nlove you,&rdquo; he muttered into her ear.</p><p>She sat back as he said his\nfinal goodbye to Peter.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you, Tony,&rdquo; Peter\nwhispered. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re my dad, you know?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I know, Pete.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I wish I could save you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know. You&rsquo;re going to be\namazing, Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you for everything.&rdquo;</p><p>Pepper swallowed her sob. The\nclock hit <i>1:00. 00:59. 00:58.</i></p><p>Pepper pressed a final kiss against\nTony&rsquo;s lips. She savoured him for everything she was.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re my everything,&rdquo; she\ntold him. &ldquo;In my whole life, I&rsquo;ll never love anyone the way I love you.&rdquo;</p><p>He smiled and it felt real. Pepper\nsat back on her knees, Peter leaning against her side. She checked the safety.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay not to be strong\nsometimes. It&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo; Tony nodded at Pepper, once, firm. &ldquo;Look after each\nother.&rdquo;</p><p>He shut his eyes as Pepper\nlifted the gun. She should&rsquo;ve known that he wouldn&rsquo;t want to see her at the\nother end of a revolver, pointed at his forehead. Peter sobbed suddenly, and\nPepper paused to pull him closer, a hand over his eyes, turning his head away\nfrom Tony Stark.</p><p>She should&rsquo;ve known when she\nwoke up that he would do this; that she would be pointing the gun and he would\nbe on the receiving end of the bullet.</p><p>She should&rsquo;ve known.</p><p>Tony Stark was nothing in not\na martyr. Was nothing if not a hero.</p><p>&ldquo;You are so loved,&rdquo; Pepper\nsaid. She saw Tony&rsquo;s muscles relax. She pulled the trigger.</p><p>&nbsp;-</p><p>&nbsp;-</p><p>She stared at the space he&rsquo;d\nbeen, not at the space he now occupied.</p><p>The gun clattered to the\nfloor and Pepper pulled Peter in tighter, not letting him look at what she&rsquo;d\ndone. Her hands were clean but when she looked at them, they were so, so\nstained.</p><p>The clock hit <i>00:00 </i>and a buzz sounded, the door\nswinging open.</p><p>Pepper almost said <i>let&rsquo;s go home</i>, but the words died in her\nthroat. She&rsquo;d killed their home. Their home was lying in his own blood. </p><p>She&rsquo;d never be able to go\nhome again.</p>",

There was an uproar. The media began throwing names out, giving Tony and Peter degrading titles.</p><p>Peter was known as a sugar baby, slut, gold digger, a victim.</p><p>Tony was called a rapist and a pedophile.</p><p>It all got to Peter, he knew people would be upset or shocked, he knew it wasn\u2019t to go by smoothly and that people would make assumptions. His phone was constantly blowing up with death threats, as was Tony\u2019s.</p><p>People would stop them in the streets, tell them how their relationship was gross, sinful, and people warned Peter how it wasn\u2019t something for the long term. They would remind him of everything he already thought about and made conclusions to.</p><p>Peter knew he could handle some of it, but he didn\u2019t expect for it to be so much. He didn\u2019t expect people saying how they set a bad face for the company, or how maybe if Peter\u2019s parents hadn\u2019t died, he wouldn\u2019t have made such a mistake in dating an older man.</p><p>Some others were targeting Aunt May, saying she did a bad job raising him, and Ben should have done better with showing him in the right direction before he had died.</p><p>It broke Peter. He found himself falling asleep that night, laying in the large king-sized bed, crying. He was thinking of everything, how people looked down on him, and no matter what he did with his life, nobody would see anything other than the fact he was in a relationship with Tony Stark.</p><p>It was dumb. He should be able to love whoever the hell he wanted to. Why did age matter? He knew for a fact Tony wasn\u2019t using him, if Tony was using him, the billionaire would treat him like he used to treat all his other one-night-stands. Peter knew he wasn\u2019t just one of those people. He was different - special - Tony told him that all the time.</p><!-- more --><p>After coming to the conclusion that he wasn\u2019t going to fall asleep anytime soon, he got out of the empty bed, wearing Tony\u2019s shirt and some blue flannel pajama pants and fluffy socks covering his feet. He padded his way into the lab, red, puffy eyes and a blank facial expression as he watched his boyfriend work.</p><p>Eventually the man had looked over and sighed once he saw Pete. \u201cHey, sweetheart,\u201d He said, putting down the large tool he had in his hands, then wiping his hands on a rag while leaning against his work bench. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>Peter shook his head no, trying not to cry. \u201cNo,\u201d He said shortly, tears still threatening to spill. He could practically feel his throat closing. Tony saw the boy\u2019s distressed and walked over to him, arms open wide.</p><p>The young man walked over and leaned into the embrace. Tony rubbed Peter\u2019s back as Peter began to cry. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair,\u201d he mumbled. \u201cWhy do people care so much if I love you, or you love me, and if we love each other, and I just - it doesn\u2019t make any sense, I- I- I just -\u201d</p><p>Tony sighed as he put his head on top of Peter\u2019s. \u201cI know, I know,\u201d Tony kept rubbing the other man&rsquo;s back, trying to comfort him. Tony had gotten used to being slammed by the press over and over again for a variety of things, so it was definitely affecting him a lot less than Peter. The main thing that made him mad about the media\u2019s reaction was how Peter was being harmed by it.</p><p>\u201cI mean, is that all they have to talk about?\u201d Peter said, pulling away from Tony, quickly wiping his eyes away. \u201cI can\u2019t walk over to May\u2019s without someone stopping me or calling at me.\u201d</p><p>Tony didn\u2019t know what to say to that, instead he brought Peter into a hug, kissing the top of his head again. \u201cIt\u2019ll be okay, it\u2019ll die down soon,\u201d</p><hr><p>\u201cStark Industries will be having a change in power,\u201d Tony spoke, not feeling like he had to give a reason. Yes, Pepper was holding more power than him, but him still being a large factor in the decision making was bad for the name. Many people believed the man wasn\u2019t exactly the best at making decisions after he and Peter came out as a couple. \u201cWe\u2019ll be electing James Rhodes, as he seems to be so involved already,\u201d</p><p>The crowd was silent, mainly because they weren\u2019t going to jump for joy. It didn\u2019t matter all that much, they were just glad he wasn\u2019t running it anymore, because even though Peter was legal, and consenting and all, for some reason they couldn\u2019t understand that - only thinking their relationship was immoral. (a/n: ha no salt - not at all)</p><p>Either way, there was always that one guy, amongst the crowd who had to start up everything. \u201cMister Stark, I have a question,\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d The man replied making sure to speak into the mic.</p><p>\u201cAre you getting fired because of your relations with Peter Parker?\u201d</p><p>Tony sighed into the microphone. There was no point in going there. More and more people began speaking up. Growing impatient for the murmuring to stop, Tony began tapping at the microphone lightly so a loud \u2018bum bum bum\u2019 echoed throughout the auditorium. Everyone went silent.</p><p>\u201cOkay, didn\u2019t get fired, I quit out of the best interest of the company, nothing involved with my relations with Peter Parker-\u201d</p><p>More questions erupted from the crowd. \u201cBut it\u2019s in best interest to quit because you\u2019re dating your intern?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill Peter Parker still be working at Stark Industries now that you no longer work there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does your ex-fiance, Pepper Pots say about your resignation?\u201d</p><p>Peter watched from backstage as questions were yelled at Tony, who was trying his best to answer all of them without yelling at everyone.</p><p>This was Tony\u2019s first appearance at any kind of public event since the one where this all started. Once again, Peter expected something bad, but nothing like this.</p><p>Peter had came to the conclusion he should prepare for the worst for now on.</p><p>More questions were barreling in, and Peter was growing increasingly mad, they were attacking him for literally backing up, doing what they wanted him to do. Some of their biggest complaints were how someone who made \u2018bad decisions\u2019 could run such a wealthy business without being prosecuted. Peter couldn\u2019t believe they were making something out of nothing.</p><p>\u201cAre you quitting to avoid charges being pressed against you and Stark Industries?\u201d</p><p>Nope. That\u2019s it. Peter had snapped.</p><p>He ran a hand through his hair and walked out from behind the the wall that was hiding him out of view from everyone. Everyone kept talking, taking notice of Peter so some of the questions were aimed towards him.</p><p>He approached the podium, \u201cCan I?\u201d He asked Tony, stepping up to the microphone, not really leaving Tony with much room to say \u2018no,\u2019</p><p>Peter took in a deep breath and scanned the room, everyone only speaking in hushed whispers now.</p><p>\u201cUh - Hi, I\u2019m uh, Peter Parker, you know that already I\u2019m sure, and I - um - I just wanted to say -\u201d Peter takes a shaky breath and gathers himself a bit better. \u201cI just wanted to say - in no way am I a victim. I am not being taken advantage of by Tony Stark. Tony Stark is not in any way, a rapist or a pedophile. Calling him such names is disrespectful and harmful to more people than just us.\u201d</p><p>Everyone was still silent, so Peter took that as a sign to continue going.</p><p>\u201cAnd trust me, if he was any of those things, and I was actually a victim, I can assure you if I was actually in any danger, or in the path of harm, my friends and family would have interjected. I don\u2019t know why this is hard for you to grasp, it\u2019s - the relationship - is a consensual relationship between two adults,\u201d</p><p>People began speaking up, some louder than the others.</p><p>People kept talking an asking questions and Peter couldn\u2019t respond to all of them, so he just took a deep breath before speaking up again. \u201cOur relationship is legal, we\u2019re happy. So many of you will speak of how you should be able to love whoever, but an age gap apparently draws the line. I love Anthony Edward Stark and he loves me, we\u2019re in a regular, healthy relationship, people will have problems with it, and that\u2019s - it\u2019s just what it is - but what should really matter is that we\u2019re both happy.\u201d</p><p>Once Peter realized no one was replying Peter smiled. \u201cOkay, thank you, um. yeah, thanks,\u201d</p><p>He walked himself off the stage, smiling at Tony before walking backstage.</p><hr><p>a/n: this was crap but I was feeling hella petty so i guess i did this. idk. erm, yeah. please don\u2019t take me as a petty ass person, but currently, im being a petty ass person and im sorry.</p>",

He padded his way into the lab, red, puffy eyes and a blank facial expression as he watched his boyfriend work.</p><p>Eventually the man had looked over and sighed once he saw Pete. \u201cHey, sweetheart,\u201d He said, putting down the large tool he had in his hands, then wiping his hands on a rag while leaning against his work bench. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>Peter shook his head no, trying not to cry. \u201cNo,\u201d He said shortly, tears still threatening to spill. He could practically feel his throat closing. Tony saw the boy\u2019s distressed and walked over to him, arms open wide.</p><p>The young man walked over and leaned into the embrace. Tony rubbed Peter\u2019s back as Peter began to cry. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair,\u201d he mumbled. \u201cWhy do people care so much if I love you, or you love me, and if we love each other, and I just - it doesn\u2019t make any sense, I- I- I just -\u201d</p><p>Tony sighed as he put his head on top of Peter\u2019s. \u201cI know, I know,\u201d Tony kept rubbing the other man\u2019s back, trying to comfort him. Tony had gotten used to being slammed by the press over and over again for a variety of things, so it was definitely affecting him a lot less than Peter. The main thing that made him mad about the media\u2019s reaction was how Peter was being harmed by it.</p><p>\u201cI mean, is that all they have to talk about?\u201d Peter said, pulling away from Tony, quickly wiping his eyes away. \u201cI can\u2019t walk over to May\u2019s without someone stopping me or calling at me.\u201d</p><p>Tony didn\u2019t know what to say to that, instead he brought Peter into a hug, kissing the top of his head again. \u201cIt\u2019ll be okay, it\u2019ll die down soon,\u201d</p><hr><p>\u201cStark Industries will be having a change in power,\u201d Tony spoke, not feeling like he had to give a reason. Yes, Pepper was holding more power than him, but him still being a large factor in the decision making was bad for the name. Many people believed the man wasn\u2019t exactly the best at making decisions after he and Peter came out as a couple. \u201cWe\u2019ll be electing James Rhodes, as he seems to be so involved already,\u201d</p><p>The crowd was silent, mainly because they weren\u2019t going to jump for joy. It didn\u2019t matter all that much, they were just glad he wasn\u2019t running it anymore, because even though Peter was legal, and consenting and all, for some reason they couldn\u2019t understand that - only thinking their relationship was immoral. (a/n: ha no salt - not at all)</p><p>Either way, there was always that one guy, amongst the crowd who had to start up everything. \u201cMister Stark, I have a question,\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d The man replied making sure to speak into the mic.</p><p>\u201cAre you getting fired because of your relations with Peter Parker?\u201d</p><p>Tony sighed into the microphone. There was no point in going there. More and more people began speaking up. Growing impatient for the murmuring to stop, Tony began tapping at the microphone lightly so a loud \u2018bum bum bum\u2019 echoed throughout the auditorium. Everyone went silent.</p><p>\u201cOkay, didn\u2019t get fired, I quit out of the best interest of the company, nothing involved with my relations with Peter Parker-\u201d</p><p>More questions erupted from the crowd. \u201cBut it\u2019s in best interest to quit because you\u2019re dating your intern?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill Peter Parker still be working at Stark Industries now that you no longer work there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does your ex-fiance, Pepper Pots say about your resignation?\u201d</p><p>Peter watched from backstage as questions were yelled at Tony, who was trying his best to answer all of them without yelling at everyone.</p><p>This was Tony\u2019s first appearance at any kind of public event since the one where this all started. Once again, Peter expected something bad, but nothing like this.</p><p>Peter had came to the conclusion he should prepare for the worst for now on.</p><p>More questions were barreling in, and Peter was growing increasingly mad, they were attacking him for literally backing up, doing what they wanted him to do. Some of their biggest complaints were how someone who made \u2018bad decisions\u2019 could run such a wealthy business without being prosecuted. Peter couldn\u2019t believe they were making something out of nothing.</p><p>\u201cAre you quitting to avoid charges being pressed against you and Stark Industries?\u201d</p><p>Nope. That\u2019s it. Peter had snapped.</p><p>He ran a hand through his hair and walked out from behind the the wall that was hiding him out of view from everyone. Everyone kept talking, taking notice of Peter so some of the questions were aimed towards him.</p><p>He approached the podium, \u201cCan I?\u201d He asked Tony, stepping up to the microphone, not really leaving Tony with much room to say \u2018no,\u2019</p><p>Peter took in a deep breath and scanned the room, everyone only speaking in hushed whispers now.</p><p>\u201cUh - Hi, I\u2019m uh, Peter Parker, you know that already I\u2019m sure, and I - um - I just wanted to say -\u201d Peter takes a shaky breath and gathers himself a bit better. \u201cI just wanted to say - in no way am I a victim. I am not being taken advantage of by Tony Stark. Tony Stark is not in any way, a rapist or a pedophile. Calling him such names is disrespectful and harmful to more people than just us.\u201d</p><p>Everyone was still silent, so Peter took that as a sign to continue going.</p><p>\u201cAnd trust me, if he was any of those things, and I was actually a victim, I can assure you if I was actually in any danger, or in the path of harm, my friends and family would have interjected. I don\u2019t know why this is hard for you to grasp, it\u2019s - the relationship - is a consensual relationship between two adults,\u201d</p><p>People began speaking up, some louder than the others.</p><p>People kept talking an asking questions and Peter couldn\u2019t respond to all of them, so he just took a deep breath before speaking up again. \u201cOur relationship is legal, we\u2019re happy. So many of you will speak of how you should be able to love whoever, but an age gap apparently draws the line. I love Anthony Edward Stark and he loves me, we\u2019re in a regular, healthy relationship, people will have problems with it, and that\u2019s - it\u2019s just what it is - but what should really matter is that we\u2019re both happy.\u201d</p><p>Once Peter realized no one was replying Peter smiled. \u201cOkay, thank you, um. yeah, thanks,\u201d</p><p>He walked himself off the stage, smiling at Tony before walking backstage.</p><hr><p>a/n: this was crap but I was feeling hella petty so i guess i did this. idk. erm, yeah. please don\u2019t take me as a petty ass person, but currently, im being a petty ass person and im sorry.</p>",
