He followed her gaze to the little fox on his stomach. &ldquo;I tried to keep him away.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;S'alright,&rdquo;\n the woman said quietly. She reach down and gave the fox a gentle stroke\n on it&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;He just wanted his Papa. Isn&rsquo;t that right, boy?&rdquo;</p><p>Sandor\n watched the fox from the corner of his eye, his scarred lips pulling \ndown slightly. He couldn&rsquo;t help the small pang of jealousy he felt \nwatching her pet the small animal. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to make a hat out of it if\n it doesn&rsquo;t stop waking us up at the crack of morning.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh come, Sandor,&rdquo; the woman chuckled. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have the heart to and you know it.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Sandor grimaced, but didn&rsquo;t meet her eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go put some food on.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>The\n woman chuckled and pressed a loving kiss to his scarred jaw. She \ngathered their little fox back into her arms and stroked his head as if \nhe were their firstborn child. &ldquo;Go on, Papa. We&rsquo;ll be waiting right here\n in the warm bed for your return.&rdquo;</p></p>",

I&rsquo;m back with Fox and the Hound. Thanks so much, anon, for requesting! I love this couple and their sweet little fox! <br />Not my image.</i></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Winter had left as slowly as it came that year, and the sun seemed to\n want to hide away just as much as the villagers pined to. The ground \nwas muddy, still wet from the last snow of winter, and people were holed\n up in their cottages. The smell of burning wood was a comfort to most, \nbut it set one man particular on edge.</p>\n<p>Inside one of the more \nmodest cottages, in the room furthest from the front door, was Sandor \nClegane. He was sat up in the bed, his big hands folded onto his stomach\n as he rested. His eyes were closed and he breathed in deeply, the smell\n of fire still a paralyzing fear. Had it been him alone he might have \nslept in the front room, furthest away from the flickering fire, but the\n woman in the bed beside him promised she&rsquo;d keep him safe. He sneered at\n her in the moment, but there he lay still beside her, close enough so \nthat he could feel her steady, even breathing.<br /></p>\n<p>She looked more\n than comfortable, sprawled out like the flayed man on the Bolton&rsquo;s \nbanners, the fur that covered them nearly up to her ears. She lay eerily\n still - had it not been for it&rsquo;s soft snoring Sandor might have thought\n her dead.</p>\n<p>A muffled squeak came from another lump beneath the \nfur. Sandor&rsquo;s eye slid open as he waited for the lump to begin it&rsquo;s \nventure up to it&rsquo;s parents. Their little one knew it was morning and he \ndone as he did every day since they&rsquo;d rescued him. Sandor bit back a \ngroan as he watched the lump travel up the bed, finally ending up \nbetween he and his woman. The little fox knew his mother was a deep \nsleeper and knew exactly the way to wake her. <br /></p>\n</p>",
