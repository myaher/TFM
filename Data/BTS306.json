In that kingdom, the royal family had the freedom of marrying whoever his or her royal highness deems worthy. Now, of course, having that special privilege came with some interesting challenges, but that doesn\u2019t stop a certain head-strong princess from doing whatever her heart\u2019s desire, especially when she has her heart set on marrying her personal bodyguard. Unfortunately, her beliefs might face some hardships when a certain king sets his eye on her. Will her bodyguard continue to fight for her or is it finally her turn?</small></p><p><small>\u203b <b>Previously: </b><a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/175791445214/fight-for-me-ch1\">ch.1</a> | <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/175887448405/fight-for-me-ch2\">ch.2</a> | <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/175993838175/fight-for-me-ch3\">ch.3</a> | <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176061680692/fight-for-me-ch4\">ch.4</a><br/></small></p><p><small>\u203b <b>Next Time:</b> <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176200520359/fight-for-me-ch6\">ch.6</a>\u00a0| <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176307635761/fight-for-me-final-chapter\">final chapter</a></small></p><hr><h2><i>Chapter 5: A Knight vs. A King</i></h2><!-- more --><p><i>Previously</i></p><p><i>Seokjin rubbed his nose against her cheek\nsweetly and said no. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThen\ndo not tease me, my dear knight!\u201d Sumin poked his cheek as the two neared the\nentrance of the dining room. </i></p><p><i>Seokjin simply laughed in response, \u201cI would\nnever, my sweet princess.\u201d He then untwined their fingers. \u201cNow, enjoy supper.\nIf you are good princess and tell your father about our decision, then I might\nvisit your chambers this evening.\u201d He whispered the last part in her ear. </i></p><p><i>Sumin felt a rush of pleasure as soon as he\nwhispered that. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMaybe\nif you are good knight and behave while King Ji Yong is doing his best to\nantagonize you, then I might let you.\u201d She teased back, smiling alluring at the\nknight as she walked away. </i></p><p><i>Seokjin could have sworn he felt his crotch\narea tightened. The thought of them being alone and intimate in her chambers\nsent his hormones into a wild frenzy. </i></p><p><i>Unfortunately, for them, someone else was\nlistening in on their conversation. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cA\nmidnight rendezvous? We shall see about that, my dear princess.\u201d</i></p><p>With eyes\nglued onto the silver plates, an awkward tension filled the dining hall.\nNothing but the sounds of the royal string quartet, playing a light yet\nsoothing melody, and the fire emitted a couple of crackles as Sumin pushed\naround her roasted vegetables with her fork. </p><p>Not\nonly she felt the predatory gaze from King Ji Yong, but also a pressured stare\nfrom her knight. Honestly, it would have been better if she had not fallen in\nlove. Her father never made a rule against a member of the royal ruling the\nkingdom by him or herself. </p><p>Why not\nSumin? Her father had told her stories of her great great-aunt ruling the\nkingdom by herself, and it turned out for the better\u2015granted\u2026that the kingdom\nexperienced a few months of despair and utter sadness, but that was the beside\nthe point. </p><p>Out of\nthe corner of his eye, Sumin\u2019s father noticed a solemn expression painted on\nher face. He briefly made eye-contact with his wife, and she too noticed the odd\nexpression on their daughter\u2019s face. The royal couple gazed upon each other as\nif they read each other\u2019s mind on what they should do or even say. Then, after\na couple more moments of silence, the king spoke. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDaughter, is there something wrong\nwith your dinner?\u201d He paused, beckoning for one of the servants to come to him.\n\u201cWould you like the cook to fix you up something even yummier?\u201d He asked as he\ntook a tiny sip of the sweet wine. </p><p>Sumin\nlifted her head, shaking it as she quickly denied that something was wrong with\nher food. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI guess I am simply not hungry,\nfather.\u201d She added, smiling warmly at him. </p><p>Sumin\u2019s\nfather raised a brow, finding it odd that his daughter did not have an\nappetite. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMy daughter not hungry? I find that\nquite amusing. Tell me, what is on your mind that caused a sudden loss of\nhunger?\u201d He asked, hating the fact that his daughter distracted and seemed a\nbit distant. </p><p>A short\nsigh exited her lips as Sumin glanced at Seokjin, establishing eye-contact\nbriefly, before directing her attention back to her father. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cFather, I am sure that you have\ngrown tired of my indecisiveness, but I swear to you on the Holy Father that\nthis will be my sudden change of heart.\u201d She began; her chest heaved slightly\nas the nerves settled in the pit of her stomach. </p><p>Both\nher father and morning leaned in their seats, unsure where the direction of the\nconversation headed. </p><p>Sumin\u2019s\nmother gestured for her to continue and so she did. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI know Seokjin and I have changed\nour decision countless of times, but this time we are completely serious. We\nare ready to become betrothed to one another and proceed with the next steps.\u201d\nShe announced, feeling a tiny weight lifted off her shoulders. </p><p>Sumin\u2019s\nfather eyed his daughter as he tapped his chin. Was his daughter playing tricks\non him yet again? Had she and her knight finally made up their minds and\nhearts? Was he going to live to see his only daughter\u2014his pride and joy\u2015wed?\nThank, the Lord. </p><p>With his\nindex and middle fingers, the king gestured for Seokjin to come hither. </p><p>Seokjin\nbowed his head and walked up to the dining table, secretly feeling triumphant\nas he secured Sumin\u2019s heart and their future together. </p><p>Ji Yong\non the other hand did not see that as a loss. If anything, he merely saw it as\nhumongous obstacle and now? It was time for drastic measures. </p><p>His\nears tuned into the happy discussion, but his mind and heart drifted somewhere\nelse. His evil mind began plotting a plan that would result with Sumin has his\nwife. His heart focused on how beautiful Sumin looked; her appearance enhanced\neven more as the fire dimmed in the room. It was because of that Ji Yong\nstarted to imagine what she would look like in complete darkness. With the moon\nilluminating their chambers, he could picture her magnificent breasts as her\nface contorted in pleasure. The pleasure that he so happily gave her. </p><p>God\u2026just\nthat mere thought got him excited. It also did not help that his lips still\ntingled from their passionate kiss in the library. He had tiny taste of her,\nand he desired more. He wanted to feel her precious lips all over his body. He\neven wanted to see them wrapped around his hardened length as she bobbed her\nhead slowly; the pleasure that only crescendos. \u00a0</p><p>The\nmore he indulged in his naughty thoughts, the more he failed to realize that\nSumin and Seokjin had excused themselves. </p><p>Finally\u2014he\npulled himself out of them. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cExcuse me. I need to fetch myself\nsome fresh air.\u201d Ji Yong announced, pushing his chair back. He bowed his head before\nwalking out of the hall. <br/>\nSumin\u2019s parents watched Ji Yong until he disappeared from their sight. A long\nsigh escaped both their lips as they could not help but worry for their\ndaughter\u2019s happiness. </p><p>Even\nwith them discussing future wedding plans, Ji Yong did not seem bothered by it.\nIf anything, he simply ignored it. </p><p>Something\nabout the arrogant king did not settle with them whatsoever. Sumin\u2019s father had\nrecalled what the other kings had gossiped about King Ji Yong countless of\ntimes, and they always said that he would stop at nothing to obtain what his\nheart desires. He would even declare war if deemed necessary. </p><p>Sumin\u2019s\nfather was not sure if his body could handle an all-out war with another\nkingdom at his age. He was not frail, but he was not young either. Time, like\neverything else, always had interesting plans for the living\u2014so he silently\nprayed that time would show him mercy. </p><p>As the\nwaves crashed against the cliff , and the slight breeze that danced across the\ncourtyard, Sumin and Seokjin walked leisurely towards their favorite spot\u2014the\ngarden. Oh, the garden held many wonderful memories for them. It was the place\nwhere they shared their first mud war. Sumin won most of them. It was the place\nwhere they confessed their romantic feelings for one another. They also\nindulged in their first kiss\u2014and their second kiss. Now, the garden would soon\nhold another fond memory\u2014the day the two of them would wed. </p><p>With\nthe full Summer moon as their spotlight, and the sounds of laughter that\nemitted from them, the two lovers began reminiscing of the day their first met.\n</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAre you sure, my beloved? I for one\nremember that day quite differently.\u201d Sumin said as her thoughts drifted back\nto the day when she was only a little girl. Her father had presented her a\nhorse for her sixth birthday\u2014along with a certain newly appointed stable boy. </p><p><i>Dawning a hunter green dress, Sumin bunched\nthe skirt up enough to stop tripping over it when she tried to keep up with her\nfather. She was short, and her father was a giant in comparison. She had to run\nafter him if she wanted to stay by his side. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cFather!\nWhere are we going? I thought mother said I was not allowed to see my presents\nuntil after tonight\u2019s ball?\u201d Sumin asked as she continued to rush after her\nfather. </i></p><p><i>A short chuckle escaped his mouth as Sumin\u2019s\nfather made a sudden halt near the garden entryway. He did an about face and\ncrouched down, pushing his cape out of the way. He held out his arms and waited\nfor the arrival of his daughter.</i></p><p><i>Seeing his arms wide open, a bright smile\ngraced her face as Sumin ran full force into his chest, loving the warmth and\nlove he radiated. </i></p><p><i>Sumin\u2019s father stood up with his daughter\nsecured against his side and entered the garden. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\nknow that your mother wanted you to wait until after your birthday ball, but I\ncould not.\u201d Sumin\u2019s father replied as the two ventured deeper inside the\ngarden. </i></p><p><i>Sumin tilted her head slightly and just as\nshe opened her mouth to ask another question, the sounds of horses neighing\ncaptured her attention. </i></p><p><i>Her eyes lit up instantly as her eyes caught\nsight of two beautiful horses. One was brown and the other white. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cFather,\nare those horses for me?\u201d She asked, wanting to make sure she had been tasked\nto giving them away to another royal family as a gift. </i></p><p><i>Her father chuckled once again as he\ngraciously placed her down. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes,\nmy child. Those horses belong to you and\u2026\u201d He paused, whistling for his most\ntrusted stable worker to come forth. \u201cThis newly appointed stable boy will now\nwork underneath you. He will be taking care of your horses just like his father\ntakes care of mine.\u201d He finished as the stable worker and his son come into\nfull view.</i></p><p><i>Sumin turned around; her eyes trailed the boy\nup and down. A faint blush appeared upon her cheeks as she found the stable boy\nquite handsome. His lips were plump. His eyes dripped with eagerness and\ncharisma. In short, her ideal man. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPrincess\nSumin, may I introduce my son, Kim Seokjin, to you.\u201d The stable worker then\npushed his son towards her; the child\u2019s nose almost bumped into hers. </i></p><p><i>Sumin held out her hand for the boy to kiss,\nbut instead she got\u2026</i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cFather,\nI thought you said that I would find the \nprincess quite beautiful? She looks like a boy.\u201d Seokjin blurted out,\nunknowingly insulting the princess in the process.</i></p><p><i>Seokjin\u2019s father\u2019s jaw dropped just a bit. He\ncould not believe that his son chose now to be a smart mouth. </i></p><p><i>Sumin\u2019s father, on the other hand, found the\nboy quite hilarious. He definitely made a perfect fit for his daughter. Someone\nneeded to keep her head placed firmly on her shoulders. Oh\u2026he could not wait\nuntil they expressed romantic interests in one another. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMy\ndeepest apologies, your highness. My son apparently lost his mind.\u201d Seokjin\u2019s\nfather quickly said, bowing his head apologetically. </i></p><p><i>Sumin clenched her jaw as her eyes became\nslits. She took back what she said about Seokjin. He was rude and no way on\nthis Earth would she ever fall in love with him. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSumin,\nwhat do you say when someone apologizes?\u201d She heard her father ask, pulling her\nout her never-ending rants. </i></p><p><i>Sumin peered up at her father, \u201cI say that he\nor she is forgiven, and no offense was taken\u2026\u201d She muttered. </i></p><p><i>Sumin\u2019s father nodded, \u201cGood. Now, tell\nSeokjin that.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Sumin let out a long whine as she kicked the\nstone pathway. She then looked up to her father, who\u2014in return\u2014gave her a stern\nexpression and gestured her towards Seokjin.</i></p><p><i>She directed her attention towards the stable\nboy, and just as she opened her mouth to accept the apology\u2014a devious idea\nplanted in her mind. </i></p><p><i>She mustered the sweetest smile ever and held\nout hand, waiting for him to shake it. </i></p><p><i>Seokjin eyed her hand oddly, sensing this\nquestionable aura around the princess, but ignored it since his father would\nwhoop him if he offended the princess yet again. </i></p><p><i>He slowly extended out his hand, closing the\ngap an inch at a time, and just as their fingertips touched, Seokjin felt a sharp\npain shoot up his arm. </i></p><p><i>A loud shout came out of his mouth as Sumin\nforcibly bent his fingers back. She then hooked her leg around his and managed\nto trip him. She climbed on top of him, and the two children began to wrestle\nin the grass. </i></p><p><i>The two fathers watched their offspring with\nsuch amusement as they found it funny that the two children just met and\nalready playing as if they had been friends since birth. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou\nstill look like a boy!\u201d Seokjin taunted as he struggled to fend off the\nhigh-tempered princess.</i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSo?\nI rather look like a boy and hit like one instead of looking like and hitting\nlike a girl!\u201d Sumin retorted as she managed to pin the poor boy down\u2014in mud. </i></p><p><i>Seokjin growled and used up all his strength\nto turn the tides. Sadly, that had been proven futile. Sumin inherited her\nincredible stubbornness from her mother. Allowing the enemy to have the upper\nhand was not in Sumin\u2019s book.</i></p><p><i>Before the two of them could be completely\ncovered in muck, the fathers finally intervened, easily pulling them off of\neach other. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell,\nI had to have to say that this has been quite an eventful first meeting, don\u2019t\nyou agree, Master Kim?\u201d Sumin\u2019s father asked, holding his daughter tightly\nagainst his legs. </i></p><p><i>Master Kim laughed, \u201cI agree, your majesty. I\nthink my son has finally found his match.\u201d </i></p><p><i>Sumin\u2019s father laughed as well, nodding in\nhis head, while Sumin and Seokjin merely stuck their tongues at each other. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMaybe\nwe can invite Seokjin to your birthday gala as a special guest? What do you\nsay, my precious jewel?\u201d Her father asked Sumin, causing the young girl to stop\nwith the taunts. </i></p><p><i>Sumin gawked, \u201cI rather invite a humpback\nwhale.\u201d </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhy?\nYou are already there, princess\u2026\u201d Seokjin said, smirking smugly.</i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhy\nI ought to!\u201d She shouted as she escaped her father\u2019s clutches and tackled\nSeokjin back to the ground.</i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\nwonder how their friendship will play out if they are already this close to one\nanother?\u201d </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cForget\nthe friendship, their romantic bond shall be one interesting event to witness.\u201d\n</i></p><p>His\nbody ached at that not-so-fond memory. Seokjin had yet to wrap his head around\nthe fact that Sumin managed to pin him down like it was nothing. </p><p>Sumin,\non the other, smiled proudly to herself. Not only did she prove her handsome\nknight wrong, but she had the opportunity to remember the day she won her first\nmatch with the boy. </p><p>Seokjin\nrested his hand on top of hers as he placed a sweet kiss on her cheek.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI still cannot believe that this\ngarden always had mud laying around.\u201d He said; his eyes scanned the garden,\ntaking note of the many tiny mud piles. </p><p>Sumin\ngiggled softly, \u201cMaybe the palace gardeners knew that you and I liked to play\nin the mud when we were only mere children.\u201d</p><p>Seokjin\nshook his head softly before resting his chin on his princess\u2019s shoulder. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWe shared many firsts here, and\nwould you like to know what is my favorite?\u201d He asked, placing a soft kiss on\nher weak spot\u2014the base of her neck. </p><p>A soft\nsigh left her lips as Sumin turned to face her beloved.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat?\u201d She asked softly,\npractically a whisper. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThis.\u201d He whispered as he cupped\nher cheek sweetly and captured her lips. </p><p>Sumin\nclosed her eyes and placed her free hand on the back of his neck. She pulled\nhim closer as the kiss slowly intensified. It was if their minds synchronized\nwith each other. </p><p>Seokjin\u2019s\ntongue lightly brushed against her bottom, causing the young princess to emit a\ntiny moan. </p><p>Just\nthat tiny moan alone excited him. He placed his hands on her lower back and\npulled her closer, as if that was even possible. His fingers played with the\nstrings of her dress, wanting nothing more to undo them. However, he stopped\nhimself. The back of his mind telling him that there was someone watching. A\ncertain someone that kissed his princess earlier. That someone being the king\nthat failed in obtaining Sumin\u2019s hand in marriage. King Ji Yong. </p><p>Not\nwanting to give the scheming king another second of their romantic moment,\nSeokjin pulled away. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI think it is time for the princess\nto retire to her chambers for the night.\u201d He then leaned close to her ear, his\nlips practically pressed against it. \u201cI also think, it is time for a certain\nknight to pay said princess a visit.\u201d He whispered alluringly; his hot breath\nsent shivers up her spine. </p><p>Not\nbeing able to form words let alone a full sentence, Sumin simply nodded with a\ndreamy like smile written on her face. </p><p>Seokjin\ncould not help but find Sumin absolutely adorable. He did not think he would\ncause her to become this mindless, lovesick person but then again, she had that\neffect on him. She just did not know it yet. </p><p>Taking\nher hand gently into his as he stood up, Seokjin bowed his head and asked\npermission if he could escort her back to her chambers. Of course, Sumin gave\nhim permission but smacked him lightly on the shoulder for being rather\nembarrassing. </p><p>Seokjin\nplaced his free hand over his heart and feigned being insulted. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell, I guess the princess can find\nher way back to her chambers by herself.\u201d He said firmly, untangling their\nfingers from one another. </p><p>Sumin\ncocked up her brow and gave him a look before shrugging and walking away. </p><p>Seokjin\u2019s\nmouth became agape as he watched the love of his life retreat. He quickly\nsnapped back into his senses and chased after the woman. </p><p>He\neasily caught up with her and grabbed her waist, causing the girl to laugh. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWho gave you permission to leave\nme?\u201d He asked; his tone tinted with slight darkness.</p><p>Sumin\nonly smirked in response before removing his hands from her body. Then, she\nwalked away from him, halting underneath the archway of the garden entrance.\nShe peered over her shoulder and with an alluring smile painted on her face,\nshe said,</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhy not follow me to my chambers,\nand I shall tell you the answer?\u201d </p><p>Seokjin\nfelt his hormones awaken. His lover knew how to rile him up to the point of him\nwanting to pin her against the wall and devour her lips as his hands traced\nevery curvature on her body\u2015her naked body. </p><p>Not\neven a second later, he pursued after her, loving their little game they played\nwhenever they felt the need to spice up their romance. God, Seokjin could only\nimagine what actual sex with Sumin would be like. Maybe tonight was the night.\nThe night two hearts become one. </p><p>As\nSeokjin disappeared off into the night, trailing after the owner of his heart,\na certain king finally emerges from his hiding spot. His blood boiled after\nhaving to endure such a disgusting sight. </p><p>Ji Yong\nclenched his fists as his mind became plagued with the scene of Seokjin and\nSumin kissing one another. His lowly hands embracing the temple that was her\nbody. His sweet whispers that invaded her ears. Everything about this night\nsickened him. Ji Yong felt incredibly jealous and possessive over Sumin, and to\nwitness her loving someone pathetic knight pissed him off. </p><p>A loud\ngrowl emitted from his mouth as Ji Yong suddenly unsheathed his sword and swung\nviolently. His sword managed to cut a few branches from a nearby bush. </p><p>Ji Yong\neyed the fallen branch; his furious mind pretended that it was Seokjin\u2019s head.\nThen\u2015as if something possessed him\u2014Ji Yong calmly sheathed his sword, inhaled\nthen exhaled nice and slow, and stared off into the distance as the nightly\nsea-breeze fanned his face. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI am going to miss this kingdom\u2026\u201d\nHe thought evilly to himself as his brain concocted the most devious plan that\nwould ensure Sumin\u2019s hand in marriage. Too bad that Seokjin would not be in\nattendance. Don\u2019t you love war? </p><p>Currently\nbrushing out the knots in her hair, Sumin hummed a little tune to herself as\nthe night breeze entered her room. The soft blow brushed past her curtains and\nflowed right by her, causing the hairs on her arm to stand up. </p><p>The\nsounds of a fire crackling filled her body with nothing but relaxation. She did\nnot understand why something so little as the sound of fire crackling put her\nmind at ease, but it did. That was until a light knock on her door interrupted\nit. Just that tiny knock caused butterflies to flutter in the pit of her belly.\n</p><p>She\nmuttered a quick enter before undoing the first bow of her nightgown. She\npulled it apart just a smidge, enough to show a bit of cleavage as her eyes\nstared at the door in anticipation. </p><p>Slowly,\na familiar face appeared in her sight. Then, his entire body came into full\nview. </p><p>Her\neyes widened and her mouth agape once she saw his appearance. Instead of his\nusual knightly attire, which consisted mainly of metal covering his entire\ntorso, he now wore a light cotton shirt, black pants, a belt that was lazily\ntied around his waist, and riding boots. His hair was even messy. </p><p>Something\nabout his unprofessional appearance aroused Sumin to the point that she\ncaptured his lips and untucked his shirt. </p><p>Seokjin\nsighed into the kiss as his arms wrapped around her waist. He then carried her\nbridal-style and walked over to the bed. </p><p>He\nbroke the kiss, for only a second; his eyes bore into hers. </p><p>The\nemotion in his eyes were purely lust and love. Nothing else mattered to him\nexcept one thing\u2014giving her his virginity and taking hers in return. </p><p>Without\nsaying a word, he undid the belt and dropped it onto the floor, creating a loud\nclink. He pulled his shirt over his head, revealing his well-toned chest, and\ntossed it aside. </p><p>Sumin\ncontinued to eye him innocently, though, her core told a different story. Her\nclit ached\u2014begged to be touched by him. She closed her thighs together, hoping\nthe tightness would distract her aching core, but it only made it worse. </p><p>His\nbrow raised just a smidge as Seokjin heard a few tiny moans come from his\nprincess. Her innocent eyes remained on his as he quickly kicked off his boots,\nnot wanting to keep his woman waiting any longer. He undid the buttons of his\npants, though, not taking them off. </p><p>A tiny\nwhine left her lips as Sumin hoped to see what lied underneath. She hadn\u2019t seen\nhis <i>friend</i> since the night of her\nparty. It had been too long. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAre you teasing me, my knight?\u201d She\nasked with an alluring smile.</p><p>Seokjin\nmerely smirked as he walked over to her fireplace and threw water on it; the\nsound of sizzles entered the room. </p><p>Nothing\nbut the moonlight illuminated her chambers as Sumin\u2019s breathing grew heavy from\nanticipation. Then, she felt a shift in her bed. </p><p>Before\nshe could say a word, her cheeks were cupped followed by an innocent kiss on\nher lips. </p><p>Seokjin\npulled away; his lips still hovered over hers. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI know waiting for our wedding\nnight is the proper action to take, but I simply cannot. I need you, Sumin.\u201d He\nlightly rubbed her lips with his, \u201cPlease, tell me that you feel the same way.\u201d\nHe whispered softly as his heart pounded against his chest. </p><p>Sumin\nstared at him for a moment. Then, instead of speaking, she passionately kissed\nhim. She poured every ounce of love and want she had for the man. She too\nwanted him in every possible way. </p><p>She\nquickly undid the rest of the strings and slid the nightgown of her shoulders.\nShe pushed the sleeves down until her arms were free. </p><p>With\nher breasts in full view, something in Seokjin snapped. He devoured her lips\nagain as he gently pushed her onto the mattress. </p><p>A soft\nmoan escaped her lips as Seokjin\u2019s hands trailed up and down her thighs,\nigniting a tiny trail of fire with each passing. </p><p>Sumin\ndidn\u2019t know what possessed her, but she lifted up her leg and hooked it around his\nwaist. </p><p>Her\ncore pressed into his crotch, creating this friction that only left an intense\ndesire. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI need you, Seokjin\u2026\u201d She begged\nsoftly as he directed his lips away from her lips and onto her neck. </p><p>Seokjin\nsmirked against her skin, pausing in his little assault. He lifted his head;\nhis lust filled gaze met hers. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDid I just hear the princess beg\nfor me?\u201d He teased as his fingers teased her entrance. </p><p>Sumin\nwhined, feeling his thumb graze over her clit, \u201cY-yes\u2026\u201d </p><p>Seokjin\npushed one finger into her, loving how wet she had become just by his kisses\nalone. He added another one before slowly pumping his index and middle fingers\nin and out. </p><p>Sumin\ngasped in pleasure as she tilted her head and arched her back, giving Seokjin a\nfull view of her hardened nipples. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDamn\u2026\u201d He mentally cursed as he\nlicked his lips.</p><p>Tiny\nmoans left one by one as Sumin felt something in the pit of her stomach. A feeling\nshe hadn\u2019t experienced since their one night alone in the abandoned room. </p><p>Feeling\nher walls constrict against his fingers, Seokjin quickened his pace as his lips\nattached to hers, swallowing her moans as they grown louder.</p><p>His\nfingers pumped in and out of her. His thumb vigorously rubbed her clit.</p><p>God,\nfeeling her like this made him want to pleasure himself\u2014and so he did. Seokjin\nreached inside his pants and wrapped his free hand around his aching member. He\nmatched the pace of his fingers as the urge to release soon came over him. </p><p>He\npumped her and himself one last time before small strips of white landed on the\ninside of his pants. Her juices coated his fingers as both Seokjin and Sumin\nbreathed heavily.</p><p>Sumin\nsat up and showered his bare shoulder with tiny pecks as she watched him suck\nthe juices off his finger.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI shall never forget the taste of\nmy princess for as long as I live.\u201d Seokjin announced, smirking. </p><p>Sumin\nshook her head before kissing his plump lips slowly yet teasingly. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI wish I could have tasted you,\nSeokjin\u2026\u201d She pouted cutely as her hands played with his pants, wanting nothing\nmore to take them off. She messed with the waistband as her fingers slowly\ndisappeared inside, but not reaching his cock quite yet. </p><p>A soft\nchuckle left his lips as he couldn\u2019t help but shake his head. His princess\nalways loved hinting rather than telling.</p><p>Finally\ntaking the hint, Seokjin pushed down his pants and kicked them off the bed. He\nthen removed the nightgown completely from her body. He bunched the light\nclothing material and tossed it over his shoulder. </p><p>Sumin\ncouldn\u2019t help but giggle at his childish act; however, it was short lived. Her\nbody was pinned underneath him; her wrists were positioned above her head. </p><p>Her\nbreasts pressed against his chest as his knee settled in between her thighs. </p><p>A\nblanket silence covered the room as the two lovers remained still, staring into\neach other\u2019s souls. This moment of intimacy had officially become intense.\nLying in silence as with their naked bodies in complete view was honestly\nspecial to them.</p><p>Sure,\nthey shared acts of intimacy as they had touched each other\u2019s bodies as lovers,\nbut right now? It was different. Neither one of them could explain it, but\ntheir hearts knew what this was. Their minds knew what this was. No words were\nneeded. </p><p>Slowly,\nSeokjin lowered himself down as he used his free hand to pump his member. </p><p>In a\nmatter of seconds, he was erect again. He then checked to see if Sumin was\nready to receive him, and she was. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMy deepest apologies, my princess,\nbut this might hurt you for a bit or at least feel uncomfortable. I will not\nact any further without your consent, okay?\u201d He said softly and sweetly as he\nteased her entrance with his tip. </p><p>Sumin\nsmiled warmly at him and nodded her head. Again, no words were needed. Not\nanymore. </p><p>Seokjin\nreleased his hold on her wrists as he cupped her chin, tilting her head up\nslightly. He kissed her lips sweetly; his tongue entered her mouth, as slowly\npushed himself inside her. </p><p>Sumin\u2019s\nface slowly contorted in discomfort. She felt her walls stretch the more he\nentered her. His size wasn\u2019t helping either. It wasn\u2019t like he was humongous,\nbut he wasn\u2019t tiny. </p><p>She\nbreathed heavily through her nostrils as Seokjin pulled out and then entered\nonce more. He repeated that action even though she didn\u2019t give him permission\nto do so. </p><p>Eventually,\nthe feeling of discomfort vanished. Then, only a ping of pleasure was left.\nThat tiny ping had been enough for Sumin to give him permission to move faster,\nwhich he did. </p><p>His\nthrusts sped up as both the warmth and wetness riled his sex drive to the point\nthat he just had to take her. His mind went into a frenzy as he thought of\nnothing else but to make Sumin moan and come undone again.</p><p>Her\nmoans increased in volume as the sounds bounced off the stone walls of her\nroom. In her state of mind, she didn\u2019t care if someone heard, especially that\nstupid King Ji Yong. Little did she know\u2026 she would regret that feeling since\nhe found himself wandering around near her room when he heard the sounds of\npassionate lovemaking. </p><p>Curiosity\ngot the best of him as he peeped through the keyhole and saw that lowly knight\nhaving sex with <i>his</i> future-wife.\nYup\u2026seeing them like that solidified his plan. Now, it was time to execute it. </p><p>Ji Yong\nstepped away from the door just as he heard Seokjin manage to tell Sumin that\nhe loved her. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI l-love you too\u2026Seokjin\u2026\u201d Sumin\nmanaged to say through her endless moans and pants.</p><p>Seokjin\nsmiled as he lifted her leg and rested it on his wide shoulder. He then leaned\nforward, loving the new angle that they were in as he continued his thrusting. </p><p>It was\nthanks to this angle that Sumin began to see stars. His cock managed to hit her\ng-spot here and there, sending waves of pleasure throughout her body. She\ncraved more. She needed more. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHit that s-spot again, my beloved.\u201d\nShe moaned out as she fisted the sheets.</p><p>Seokjin\nsimply nodded and did as he was told. He tried his hardest to hit that special\nspot repeatedly; however, if he couldn\u2019t, the he resorted in rubbing her clit.\nNow, that spot got her a moaning mess\u2014and he loved every second of it. </p><p>Sounds\nof moaning and skin-on-skin contact continued to fill the room as it seemed\nlike hours had gone by since they first began. Honestly, they didn\u2019t care how\nlong it had been since their hearts were telling them that this might be the\nlast time they would be this intimate. At the same, they paid little to no\nattention to what their hearts were saying because lust had taken control. What\nmattered was that they were together now. </p><p>The\npleasure became too much as one more thrust would make Sumin see white, and\nSeokjin felt the same. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cR-ready to cum for me, princess?\u201d\nHe grunted as his thrusts slowly became sloppy. </p><p>Sumin\nonly nodded as her intellect disappeared hours ago. </p><p>With one last thrust, Seokjin released inside of her while\nSumin released all over him; their juices mixed with one another. His thrusts\nhad become incredibly sloppy as he emptied himself before collapsing on top of\nSumin. </p><p>Sumin panted heavily as she absentmindedly played with\nSeokjin\u2019s sweaty hair. </p><p>Seokjin sighed in content before mustering the remaining\nstrength he had left to pull out of her. The moment he did that, he instantly\nmissed her warmth. </p><p>He then lazily rolled over to the right side of the bed and\npulled her tainted sheets over them. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt occurred\nto me that we need to explain to your nurse about your sheets.\u201d Seokjin mumbled\nas he draped his arm over Sumin\u2019s bare waist. </p><p>Sumin gave him look, though he couldn\u2019t see it. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat do you\n\u2018we need to explain\u2019? I am more than likely going to explain it to her myself\nwhile you magically disappear.\u201d She stated as Seokjin leaned down to lightly\nbite her nose. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHow about\nthis\u2026you explain to the nurse and I will ask your parents for an audience to\ndiscuss wedding plans.\u201d He suggested; his fingers lightly caressed her skin.</p><p>Sumin closed her eyes as they had grown to heavy too keep open\nand simply hummed in response. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI love you,\nmy one and only princess. The keeper of my heart. My everything.\u201d He whispered\nsweetly before drifting off towards dreamland, where his mind could finally\nrest and think about nothing else, but a married life with Sumin. </p><p>Except\u2026 there was something wrong with that plan\u2026</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Who said that it would be <i>his\n</i>married life with Sumin?</p><hr><p><small><b>A/N: </b>Okay for the life of me, I could not figured out how to label the last smut warning. I mean, I settled for\u00a0\u201cpenetration\u201d because that\u2019s what Sumin &amp; Seokjin did. Let\u2019s be real here! LOL I\u2019ll change it, if you guys feel that it is not correct. Maybe I\u2019ll just change it to\u00a0\u201csex scene\u201d though&hellip; I think that\u2019s what\u00a0\u201cSMUT\u201d entails. Agh&hellip; this is frustrating me.

The thought of them being alone and intimate in her chambers\nsent his hormones into a wild frenzy. </i></p><p><i>Unfortunately, for them, someone else was\nlistening in on their conversation. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cA\nmidnight rendezvous? We shall see about that, my dear princess.\u201d</i></p><p>With eyes\nglued onto the silver plates, an awkward tension filled the dining hall.\nNothing but the sounds of the royal string quartet, playing a light yet\nsoothing melody, and the fire emitted a couple of crackles as Sumin pushed\naround her roasted vegetables with her fork. </p><p>Not\nonly she felt the predatory gaze from King Ji Yong, but also a pressured stare\nfrom her knight. Honestly, it would have been better if she had not fallen in\nlove. Her father never made a rule against a member of the royal ruling the\nkingdom by him or herself. </p><p>Why not\nSumin? Her father had told her stories of her great great-aunt ruling the\nkingdom by herself, and it turned out for the better\u2015granted\u2026that the kingdom\nexperienced a few months of despair and utter sadness, but that was the beside\nthe point. </p><p>Out of\nthe corner of his eye, Sumin\u2019s father noticed a solemn expression painted on\nher face. He briefly made eye-contact with his wife, and she too noticed the odd\nexpression on their daughter\u2019s face. The royal couple gazed upon each other as\nif they read each other\u2019s mind on what they should do or even say. Then, after\na couple more moments of silence, the king spoke. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDaughter, is there something wrong\nwith your dinner?\u201d He paused, beckoning for one of the servants to come to him.\n\u201cWould you like the cook to fix you up something even yummier?\u201d He asked as he\ntook a tiny sip of the sweet wine. </p><p>Sumin\nlifted her head, shaking it as she quickly denied that something was wrong with\nher food. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI guess I am simply not hungry,\nfather.\u201d She added, smiling warmly at him. </p><p>Sumin\u2019s\nfather raised a brow, finding it odd that his daughter did not have an\nappetite. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMy daughter not hungry? I find that\nquite amusing. Tell me, what is on your mind that caused a sudden loss of\nhunger?\u201d He asked, hating the fact that his daughter distracted and seemed a\nbit distant. </p><p>A short\nsigh exited her lips as Sumin glanced at Seokjin, establishing eye-contact\nbriefly, before directing her attention back to her father. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cFather, I am sure that you have\ngrown tired of my indecisiveness, but I swear to you on the Holy Father that\nthis will be my sudden change of heart.\u201d She began; her chest heaved slightly\nas the nerves settled in the pit of her stomach. </p><p>Both\nher father and morning leaned in their seats, unsure where the direction of the\nconversation headed. </p><p>Sumin\u2019s\nmother gestured for her to continue and so she did. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI know Seokjin and I have changed\nour decision countless of times, but this time we are completely serious. We\nare ready to become betrothed to one another and proceed with the next steps.\u201d\nShe announced, feeling a tiny weight lifted off her shoulders. </p><p>Sumin\u2019s\nfather eyed his daughter as he tapped his chin. Was his daughter playing tricks\non him yet again? Had she and her knight finally made up their minds and\nhearts? Was he going to live to see his only daughter\u2014his pride and joy\u2015wed?\nThank, the Lord. </p><p>With his\nindex and middle fingers, the king gestured for Seokjin to come hither. </p><p>Seokjin\nbowed his head and walked up to the dining table, secretly feeling triumphant\nas he secured Sumin\u2019s heart and their future together. </p><p>Ji Yong\non the other hand did not see that as a loss. If anything, he merely saw it as\nhumongous obstacle and now? It was time for drastic measures. </p><p>His\nears tuned into the happy discussion, but his mind and heart drifted somewhere\nelse. His evil mind began plotting a plan that would result with Sumin has his\nwife. His heart focused on how beautiful Sumin looked; her appearance enhanced\neven more as the fire dimmed in the room. It was because of that Ji Yong\nstarted to imagine what she would look like in complete darkness. With the moon\nilluminating their chambers, he could picture her magnificent breasts as her\nface contorted in pleasure. The pleasure that he so happily gave her. </p><p>God\u2026just\nthat mere thought got him excited. It also did not help that his lips still\ntingled from their passionate kiss in the library. He had tiny taste of her,\nand he desired more. He wanted to feel her precious lips all over his body. He\neven wanted to see them wrapped around his hardened length as she bobbed her\nhead slowly; the pleasure that only crescendos. \u00a0</p><p>The\nmore he indulged in his naughty thoughts, the more he failed to realize that\nSumin and Seokjin had excused themselves. </p><p>Finally\u2014he\npulled himself out of them. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cExcuse me. I need to fetch myself\nsome fresh air.\u201d Ji Yong announced, pushing his chair back. He bowed his head before\nwalking out of the hall. <br>\nSumin\u2019s parents watched Ji Yong until he disappeared from their sight. A long\nsigh escaped both their lips as they could not help but worry for their\ndaughter\u2019s happiness. </p><p>Even\nwith them discussing future wedding plans, Ji Yong did not seem bothered by it.\nIf anything, he simply ignored it. </p><p>Something\nabout the arrogant king did not settle with them whatsoever. Sumin\u2019s father had\nrecalled what the other kings had gossiped about King Ji Yong countless of\ntimes, and they always said that he would stop at nothing to obtain what his\nheart desires. He would even declare war if deemed necessary. </p><p>Sumin\u2019s\nfather was not sure if his body could handle an all-out war with another\nkingdom at his age. He was not frail, but he was not young either. Time, like\neverything else, always had interesting plans for the living\u2014so he silently\nprayed that time would show him mercy. </p><p>As the\nwaves crashed against the cliff , and the slight breeze that danced across the\ncourtyard, Sumin and Seokjin walked leisurely towards their favorite spot\u2014the\ngarden. Oh, the garden held many wonderful memories for them. It was the place\nwhere they shared their first mud war. Sumin won most of them. It was the place\nwhere they confessed their romantic feelings for one another. They also\nindulged in their first kiss\u2014and their second kiss. Now, the garden would soon\nhold another fond memory\u2014the day the two of them would wed. </p><p>With\nthe full Summer moon as their spotlight, and the sounds of laughter that\nemitted from them, the two lovers began reminiscing of the day their first met.\n</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAre you sure, my beloved? I for one\nremember that day quite differently.\u201d Sumin said as her thoughts drifted back\nto the day when she was only a little girl. Her father had presented her a\nhorse for her sixth birthday\u2014along with a certain newly appointed stable boy. </p><p><i>Dawning a hunter green dress, Sumin bunched\nthe skirt up enough to stop tripping over it when she tried to keep up with her\nfather. She was short, and her father was a giant in comparison. She had to run\nafter him if she wanted to stay by his side. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cFather!\nWhere are we going? I thought mother said I was not allowed to see my presents\nuntil after tonight\u2019s ball?\u201d Sumin asked as she continued to rush after her\nfather. </i></p><p><i>A short chuckle escaped his mouth as Sumin\u2019s\nfather made a sudden halt near the garden entryway. He did an about face and\ncrouched down, pushing his cape out of the way. He held out his arms and waited\nfor the arrival of his daughter.</i></p><p><i>Seeing his arms wide open, a bright smile\ngraced her face as Sumin ran full force into his chest, loving the warmth and\nlove he radiated. </i></p><p><i>Sumin\u2019s father stood up with his daughter\nsecured against his side and entered the garden. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\nknow that your mother wanted you to wait until after your birthday ball, but I\ncould not.\u201d Sumin\u2019s father replied as the two ventured deeper inside the\ngarden. </i></p><p><i>Sumin tilted her head slightly and just as\nshe opened her mouth to ask another question, the sounds of horses neighing\ncaptured her attention. </i></p><p><i>Her eyes lit up instantly as her eyes caught\nsight of two beautiful horses. One was brown and the other white. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cFather,\nare those horses for me?\u201d She asked, wanting to make sure she had been tasked\nto giving them away to another royal family as a gift. </i></p><p><i>Her father chuckled once again as he\ngraciously placed her down. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes,\nmy child. Those horses belong to you and\u2026\u201d He paused, whistling for his most\ntrusted stable worker to come forth. \u201cThis newly appointed stable boy will now\nwork underneath you. He will be taking care of your horses just like his father\ntakes care of mine.\u201d He finished as the stable worker and his son come into\nfull view.</i></p><p><i>Sumin turned around; her eyes trailed the boy\nup and down. A faint blush appeared upon her cheeks as she found the stable boy\nquite handsome. His lips were plump. His eyes dripped with eagerness and\ncharisma. In short, her ideal man. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPrincess\nSumin, may I introduce my son, Kim Seokjin, to you.\u201d The stable worker then\npushed his son towards her; the child\u2019s nose almost bumped into hers. </i></p><p><i>Sumin held out her hand for the boy to kiss,\nbut instead she got\u2026</i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cFather,\nI thought you said that I would find the \nprincess quite beautiful? She looks like a boy.\u201d Seokjin blurted out,\nunknowingly insulting the princess in the process.</i></p><p><i>Seokjin\u2019s father\u2019s jaw dropped just a bit. He\ncould not believe that his son chose now to be a smart mouth. </i></p><p><i>Sumin\u2019s father, on the other hand, found the\nboy quite hilarious. He definitely made a perfect fit for his daughter. Someone\nneeded to keep her head placed firmly on her shoulders. Oh\u2026he could not wait\nuntil they expressed romantic interests in one another. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMy\ndeepest apologies, your highness. My son apparently lost his mind.\u201d Seokjin\u2019s\nfather quickly said, bowing his head apologetically. </i></p><p><i>Sumin clenched her jaw as her eyes became\nslits. She took back what she said about Seokjin. He was rude and no way on\nthis Earth would she ever fall in love with him. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSumin,\nwhat do you say when someone apologizes?\u201d She heard her father ask, pulling her\nout her never-ending rants. </i></p><p><i>Sumin peered up at her father, \u201cI say that he\nor she is forgiven, and no offense was taken\u2026\u201d She muttered. </i></p><p><i>Sumin\u2019s father nodded, \u201cGood. Now, tell\nSeokjin that.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Sumin let out a long whine as she kicked the\nstone pathway. She then looked up to her father, who\u2014in return\u2014gave her a stern\nexpression and gestured her towards Seokjin.</i></p><p><i>She directed her attention towards the stable\nboy, and just as she opened her mouth to accept the apology\u2014a devious idea\nplanted in her mind. </i></p><p><i>She mustered the sweetest smile ever and held\nout hand, waiting for him to shake it. </i></p><p><i>Seokjin eyed her hand oddly, sensing this\nquestionable aura around the princess, but ignored it since his father would\nwhoop him if he offended the princess yet again. </i></p><p><i>He slowly extended out his hand, closing the\ngap an inch at a time, and just as their fingertips touched, Seokjin felt a sharp\npain shoot up his arm. </i></p><p><i>A loud shout came out of his mouth as Sumin\nforcibly bent his fingers back. She then hooked her leg around his and managed\nto trip him. She climbed on top of him, and the two children began to wrestle\nin the grass. </i></p><p><i>The two fathers watched their offspring with\nsuch amusement as they found it funny that the two children just met and\nalready playing as if they had been friends since birth. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou\nstill look like a boy!\u201d Seokjin taunted as he struggled to fend off the\nhigh-tempered princess.</i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSo?\nI rather look like a boy and hit like one instead of looking like and hitting\nlike a girl!\u201d Sumin retorted as she managed to pin the poor boy down\u2014in mud. </i></p><p><i>Seokjin growled and used up all his strength\nto turn the tides. Sadly, that had been proven futile. Sumin inherited her\nincredible stubbornness from her mother. Allowing the enemy to have the upper\nhand was not in Sumin\u2019s book.</i></p><p><i>Before the two of them could be completely\ncovered in muck, the fathers finally intervened, easily pulling them off of\neach other. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell,\nI had to have to say that this has been quite an eventful first meeting, don\u2019t\nyou agree, Master Kim?\u201d Sumin\u2019s father asked, holding his daughter tightly\nagainst his legs. </i></p><p><i>Master Kim laughed, \u201cI agree, your majesty. I\nthink my son has finally found his match.\u201d </i></p><p><i>Sumin\u2019s father laughed as well, nodding in\nhis head, while Sumin and Seokjin merely stuck their tongues at each other. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMaybe\nwe can invite Seokjin to your birthday gala as a special guest? What do you\nsay, my precious jewel?\u201d Her father asked Sumin, causing the young girl to stop\nwith the taunts. </i></p><p><i>Sumin gawked, \u201cI rather invite a humpback\nwhale.\u201d </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhy?\nYou are already there, princess\u2026\u201d Seokjin said, smirking smugly.</i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhy\nI ought to!\u201d She shouted as she escaped her father\u2019s clutches and tackled\nSeokjin back to the ground.</i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\nwonder how their friendship will play out if they are already this close to one\nanother?\u201d </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cForget\nthe friendship, their romantic bond shall be one interesting event to witness.\u201d\n</i></p><p>His\nbody ached at that not-so-fond memory. Seokjin had yet to wrap his head around\nthe fact that Sumin managed to pin him down like it was nothing. </p><p>Sumin,\non the other, smiled proudly to herself. Not only did she prove her handsome\nknight wrong, but she had the opportunity to remember the day she won her first\nmatch with the boy. </p><p>Seokjin\nrested his hand on top of hers as he placed a sweet kiss on her cheek.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI still cannot believe that this\ngarden always had mud laying around.\u201d He said; his eyes scanned the garden,\ntaking note of the many tiny mud piles. </p><p>Sumin\ngiggled softly, \u201cMaybe the palace gardeners knew that you and I liked to play\nin the mud when we were only mere children.\u201d</p><p>Seokjin\nshook his head softly before resting his chin on his princess\u2019s shoulder. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWe shared many firsts here, and\nwould you like to know what is my favorite?\u201d He asked, placing a soft kiss on\nher weak spot\u2014the base of her neck. </p><p>A soft\nsigh left her lips as Sumin turned to face her beloved.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat?\u201d She asked softly,\npractically a whisper. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThis.\u201d He whispered as he cupped\nher cheek sweetly and captured her lips. </p><p>Sumin\nclosed her eyes and placed her free hand on the back of his neck. She pulled\nhim closer as the kiss slowly intensified. It was if their minds synchronized\nwith each other. </p><p>Seokjin\u2019s\ntongue lightly brushed against her bottom, causing the young princess to emit a\ntiny moan. </p><p>Just\nthat tiny moan alone excited him. He placed his hands on her lower back and\npulled her closer, as if that was even possible. His fingers played with the\nstrings of her dress, wanting nothing more to undo them. However, he stopped\nhimself. The back of his mind telling him that there was someone watching. A\ncertain someone that kissed his princess earlier. That someone being the king\nthat failed in obtaining Sumin\u2019s hand in marriage. King Ji Yong. </p><p>Not\nwanting to give the scheming king another second of their romantic moment,\nSeokjin pulled away. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI think it is time for the princess\nto retire to her chambers for the night.\u201d He then leaned close to her ear, his\nlips practically pressed against it. \u201cI also think, it is time for a certain\nknight to pay said princess a visit.\u201d He whispered alluringly; his hot breath\nsent shivers up her spine. </p><p>Not\nbeing able to form words let alone a full sentence, Sumin simply nodded with a\ndreamy like smile written on her face. </p><p>Seokjin\ncould not help but find Sumin absolutely adorable. He did not think he would\ncause her to become this mindless, lovesick person but then again, she had that\neffect on him. She just did not know it yet. </p><p>Taking\nher hand gently into his as he stood up, Seokjin bowed his head and asked\npermission if he could escort her back to her chambers. Of course, Sumin gave\nhim permission but smacked him lightly on the shoulder for being rather\nembarrassing. </p><p>Seokjin\nplaced his free hand over his heart and feigned being insulted. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell, I guess the princess can find\nher way back to her chambers by herself.\u201d He said firmly, untangling their\nfingers from one another. </p><p>Sumin\ncocked up her brow and gave him a look before shrugging and walking away. </p><p>Seokjin\u2019s\nmouth became agape as he watched the love of his life retreat. He quickly\nsnapped back into his senses and chased after the woman. </p><p>He\neasily caught up with her and grabbed her waist, causing the girl to laugh. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWho gave you permission to leave\nme?\u201d He asked; his tone tinted with slight darkness.</p><p>Sumin\nonly smirked in response before removing his hands from her body. Then, she\nwalked away from him, halting underneath the archway of the garden entrance.\nShe peered over her shoulder and with an alluring smile painted on her face,\nshe said,</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhy not follow me to my chambers,\nand I shall tell you the answer?\u201d </p><p>Seokjin\nfelt his hormones awaken. His lover knew how to rile him up to the point of him\nwanting to pin her against the wall and devour her lips as his hands traced\nevery curvature on her body\u2015her naked body. </p><p>Not\neven a second later, he pursued after her, loving their little game they played\nwhenever they felt the need to spice up their romance. God, Seokjin could only\nimagine what actual sex with Sumin would be like. Maybe tonight was the night.\nThe night two hearts become one. </p><p>As\nSeokjin disappeared off into the night, trailing after the owner of his heart,\na certain king finally emerges from his hiding spot. His blood boiled after\nhaving to endure such a disgusting sight. </p><p>Ji Yong\nclenched his fists as his mind became plagued with the scene of Seokjin and\nSumin kissing one another. His lowly hands embracing the temple that was her\nbody. His sweet whispers that invaded her ears. Everything about this night\nsickened him. Ji Yong felt incredibly jealous and possessive over Sumin, and to\nwitness her loving someone pathetic knight pissed him off. </p><p>A loud\ngrowl emitted from his mouth as Ji Yong suddenly unsheathed his sword and swung\nviolently. His sword managed to cut a few branches from a nearby bush. </p><p>Ji Yong\neyed the fallen branch; his furious mind pretended that it was Seokjin\u2019s head.\nThen\u2015as if something possessed him\u2014Ji Yong calmly sheathed his sword, inhaled\nthen exhaled nice and slow, and stared off into the distance as the nightly\nsea-breeze fanned his face. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI am going to miss this kingdom\u2026\u201d\nHe thought evilly to himself as his brain concocted the most devious plan that\nwould ensure Sumin\u2019s hand in marriage. Too bad that Seokjin would not be in\nattendance. Don\u2019t you love war? </p><p>Currently\nbrushing out the knots in her hair, Sumin hummed a little tune to herself as\nthe night breeze entered her room. The soft blow brushed past her curtains and\nflowed right by her, causing the hairs on her arm to stand up. </p><p>The\nsounds of a fire crackling filled her body with nothing but relaxation. She did\nnot understand why something so little as the sound of fire crackling put her\nmind at ease, but it did. That was until a light knock on her door interrupted\nit. Just that tiny knock caused butterflies to flutter in the pit of her belly.\n</p><p>She\nmuttered a quick enter before undoing the first bow of her nightgown. She\npulled it apart just a smidge, enough to show a bit of cleavage as her eyes\nstared at the door in anticipation. </p><p>Slowly,\na familiar face appeared in her sight. Then, his entire body came into full\nview. </p><p>Her\neyes widened and her mouth agape once she saw his appearance. Instead of his\nusual knightly attire, which consisted mainly of metal covering his entire\ntorso, he now wore a light cotton shirt, black pants, a belt that was lazily\ntied around his waist, and riding boots. His hair was even messy. </p><p>Something\nabout his unprofessional appearance aroused Sumin to the point that she\ncaptured his lips and untucked his shirt. </p><p>Seokjin\nsighed into the kiss as his arms wrapped around her waist. He then carried her\nbridal-style and walked over to the bed. </p><p>He\nbroke the kiss, for only a second; his eyes bore into hers. </p><p>The\nemotion in his eyes were purely lust and love. Nothing else mattered to him\nexcept one thing\u2014giving her his virginity and taking hers in return. </p><p>Without\nsaying a word, he undid the belt and dropped it onto the floor, creating a loud\nclink. He pulled his shirt over his head, revealing his well-toned chest, and\ntossed it aside. </p><p>Sumin\ncontinued to eye him innocently, though, her core told a different story. Her\nclit ached\u2014begged to be touched by him. She closed her thighs together, hoping\nthe tightness would distract her aching core, but it only made it worse. </p><p>His\nbrow raised just a smidge as Seokjin heard a few tiny moans come from his\nprincess. Her innocent eyes remained on his as he quickly kicked off his boots,\nnot wanting to keep his woman waiting any longer. He undid the buttons of his\npants, though, not taking them off. </p><p>A tiny\nwhine left her lips as Sumin hoped to see what lied underneath. She hadn\u2019t seen\nhis <i>friend</i> since the night of her\nparty. It had been too long. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAre you teasing me, my knight?\u201d She\nasked with an alluring smile.</p><p>Seokjin\nmerely smirked as he walked over to her fireplace and threw water on it; the\nsound of sizzles entered the room. </p><p>Nothing\nbut the moonlight illuminated her chambers as Sumin\u2019s breathing grew heavy from\nanticipation. Then, she felt a shift in her bed. </p><p>Before\nshe could say a word, her cheeks were cupped followed by an innocent kiss on\nher lips. </p><p>Seokjin\npulled away; his lips still hovered over hers. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI know waiting for our wedding\nnight is the proper action to take, but I simply cannot. I need you, Sumin.\u201d He\nlightly rubbed her lips with his, \u201cPlease, tell me that you feel the same way.\u201d\nHe whispered softly as his heart pounded against his chest. </p><p>Sumin\nstared at him for a moment. Then, instead of speaking, she passionately kissed\nhim. She poured every ounce of love and want she had for the man. She too\nwanted him in every possible way. </p><p>She\nquickly undid the rest of the strings and slid the nightgown of her shoulders.\nShe pushed the sleeves down until her arms were free. </p><p>With\nher breasts in full view, something in Seokjin snapped. He devoured her lips\nagain as he gently pushed her onto the mattress. </p><p>A soft\nmoan escaped her lips as Seokjin\u2019s hands trailed up and down her thighs,\nigniting a tiny trail of fire with each passing. </p><p>Sumin\ndidn\u2019t know what possessed her, but she lifted up her leg and hooked it around his\nwaist. </p><p>Her\ncore pressed into his crotch, creating this friction that only left an intense\ndesire. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI need you, Seokjin\u2026\u201d She begged\nsoftly as he directed his lips away from her lips and onto her neck. </p><p>Seokjin\nsmirked against her skin, pausing in his little assault. He lifted his head;\nhis lust filled gaze met hers. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDid I just hear the princess beg\nfor me?\u201d He teased as his fingers teased her entrance. </p><p>Sumin\nwhined, feeling his thumb graze over her clit, \u201cY-yes\u2026\u201d </p><p>Seokjin\npushed one finger into her, loving how wet she had become just by his kisses\nalone. He added another one before slowly pumping his index and middle fingers\nin and out. </p><p>Sumin\ngasped in pleasure as she tilted her head and arched her back, giving Seokjin a\nfull view of her hardened nipples. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDamn\u2026\u201d He mentally cursed as he\nlicked his lips.</p><p>Tiny\nmoans left one by one as Sumin felt something in the pit of her stomach. A feeling\nshe hadn\u2019t experienced since their one night alone in the abandoned room. </p><p>Feeling\nher walls constrict against his fingers, Seokjin quickened his pace as his lips\nattached to hers, swallowing her moans as they grown louder.</p><p>His\nfingers pumped in and out of her. His thumb vigorously rubbed her clit.</p><p>God,\nfeeling her like this made him want to pleasure himself\u2014and so he did. Seokjin\nreached inside his pants and wrapped his free hand around his aching member. He\nmatched the pace of his fingers as the urge to release soon came over him. </p><p>He\npumped her and himself one last time before small strips of white landed on the\ninside of his pants. Her juices coated his fingers as both Seokjin and Sumin\nbreathed heavily.</p><p>Sumin\nsat up and showered his bare shoulder with tiny pecks as she watched him suck\nthe juices off his finger.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI shall never forget the taste of\nmy princess for as long as I live.\u201d Seokjin announced, smirking. </p><p>Sumin\nshook her head before kissing his plump lips slowly yet teasingly. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI wish I could have tasted you,\nSeokjin\u2026\u201d She pouted cutely as her hands played with his pants, wanting nothing\nmore to take them off. She messed with the waistband as her fingers slowly\ndisappeared inside, but not reaching his cock quite yet. </p><p>A soft\nchuckle left his lips as he couldn\u2019t help but shake his head. His princess\nalways loved hinting rather than telling.</p><p>Finally\ntaking the hint, Seokjin pushed down his pants and kicked them off the bed. He\nthen removed the nightgown completely from her body. He bunched the light\nclothing material and tossed it over his shoulder. </p><p>Sumin\ncouldn\u2019t help but giggle at his childish act; however, it was short lived. Her\nbody was pinned underneath him; her wrists were positioned above her head. </p><p>Her\nbreasts pressed against his chest as his knee settled in between her thighs. </p><p>A\nblanket silence covered the room as the two lovers remained still, staring into\neach other\u2019s souls. This moment of intimacy had officially become intense.\nLying in silence as with their naked bodies in complete view was honestly\nspecial to them.</p><p>Sure,\nthey shared acts of intimacy as they had touched each other\u2019s bodies as lovers,\nbut right now? It was different. Neither one of them could explain it, but\ntheir hearts knew what this was. Their minds knew what this was. No words were\nneeded. </p><p>Slowly,\nSeokjin lowered himself down as he used his free hand to pump his member. </p><p>In a\nmatter of seconds, he was erect again. He then checked to see if Sumin was\nready to receive him, and she was. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMy deepest apologies, my princess,\nbut this might hurt you for a bit or at least feel uncomfortable. I will not\nact any further without your consent, okay?\u201d He said softly and sweetly as he\nteased her entrance with his tip. </p><p>Sumin\nsmiled warmly at him and nodded her head. Again, no words were needed. Not\nanymore. </p><p>Seokjin\nreleased his hold on her wrists as he cupped her chin, tilting her head up\nslightly. He kissed her lips sweetly; his tongue entered her mouth, as slowly\npushed himself inside her. </p><p>Sumin\u2019s\nface slowly contorted in discomfort. She felt her walls stretch the more he\nentered her. His size wasn\u2019t helping either. It wasn\u2019t like he was humongous,\nbut he wasn\u2019t tiny. </p><p>She\nbreathed heavily through her nostrils as Seokjin pulled out and then entered\nonce more. He repeated that action even though she didn\u2019t give him permission\nto do so. </p><p>Eventually,\nthe feeling of discomfort vanished. Then, only a ping of pleasure was left.\nThat tiny ping had been enough for Sumin to give him permission to move faster,\nwhich he did. </p><p>His\nthrusts sped up as both the warmth and wetness riled his sex drive to the point\nthat he just had to take her. His mind went into a frenzy as he thought of\nnothing else but to make Sumin moan and come undone again.</p><p>Her\nmoans increased in volume as the sounds bounced off the stone walls of her\nroom. In her state of mind, she didn\u2019t care if someone heard, especially that\nstupid King Ji Yong. Little did she know\u2026 she would regret that feeling since\nhe found himself wandering around near her room when he heard the sounds of\npassionate lovemaking. </p><p>Curiosity\ngot the best of him as he peeped through the keyhole and saw that lowly knight\nhaving sex with <i>his</i> future-wife.\nYup\u2026seeing them like that solidified his plan. Now, it was time to execute it. </p><p>Ji Yong\nstepped away from the door just as he heard Seokjin manage to tell Sumin that\nhe loved her. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI l-love you too\u2026Seokjin\u2026\u201d Sumin\nmanaged to say through her endless moans and pants.</p><p>Seokjin\nsmiled as he lifted her leg and rested it on his wide shoulder. He then leaned\nforward, loving the new angle that they were in as he continued his thrusting. </p><p>It was\nthanks to this angle that Sumin began to see stars. His cock managed to hit her\ng-spot here and there, sending waves of pleasure throughout her body. She\ncraved more. She needed more. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHit that s-spot again, my beloved.\u201d\nShe moaned out as she fisted the sheets.</p><p>Seokjin\nsimply nodded and did as he was told. He tried his hardest to hit that special\nspot repeatedly; however, if he couldn\u2019t, the he resorted in rubbing her clit.\nNow, that spot got her a moaning mess\u2014and he loved every second of it. </p><p>Sounds\nof moaning and skin-on-skin contact continued to fill the room as it seemed\nlike hours had gone by since they first began. Honestly, they didn\u2019t care how\nlong it had been since their hearts were telling them that this might be the\nlast time they would be this intimate. At the same, they paid little to no\nattention to what their hearts were saying because lust had taken control. What\nmattered was that they were together now. </p><p>The\npleasure became too much as one more thrust would make Sumin see white, and\nSeokjin felt the same. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cR-ready to cum for me, princess?\u201d\nHe grunted as his thrusts slowly became sloppy. </p><p>Sumin\nonly nodded as her intellect disappeared hours ago. </p><p>With one last thrust, Seokjin released inside of her while\nSumin released all over him; their juices mixed with one another. His thrusts\nhad become incredibly sloppy as he emptied himself before collapsing on top of\nSumin. </p><p>Sumin panted heavily as she absentmindedly played with\nSeokjin\u2019s sweaty hair. </p><p>Seokjin sighed in content before mustering the remaining\nstrength he had left to pull out of her. The moment he did that, he instantly\nmissed her warmth. </p><p>He then lazily rolled over to the right side of the bed and\npulled her tainted sheets over them. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt occurred\nto me that we need to explain to your nurse about your sheets.\u201d Seokjin mumbled\nas he draped his arm over Sumin\u2019s bare waist. </p><p>Sumin gave him look, though he couldn\u2019t see it. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat do you\n\u2018we need to explain\u2019? I am more than likely going to explain it to her myself\nwhile you magically disappear.\u201d She stated as Seokjin leaned down to lightly\nbite her nose. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHow about\nthis\u2026you explain to the nurse and I will ask your parents for an audience to\ndiscuss wedding plans.\u201d He suggested; his fingers lightly caressed her skin.</p><p>Sumin closed her eyes as they had grown to heavy too keep open\nand simply hummed in response. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI love you,\nmy one and only princess. The keeper of my heart. My everything.\u201d He whispered\nsweetly before drifting off towards dreamland, where his mind could finally\nrest and think about nothing else, but a married life with Sumin. </p><p>Except\u2026 there was something wrong with that plan\u2026</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Who said that it would be <i>his\n</i>married life with Sumin?</p><hr><p><small><b>A/N: </b>Okay for the life of me, I could not figured out how to label the last smut warning. I mean, I settled for\u00a0\u201cpenetration\u201d because that\u2019s what Sumin &amp; Seokjin did. Let\u2019s be real here! LOL I\u2019ll change it, if you guys feel that it is not correct. Maybe I\u2019ll just change it to\u00a0\u201csex scene\u201d though\u2026 I think that\u2019s what\u00a0\u201cSMUT\u201d entails. Agh\u2026 this is frustrating me. Anyway, I hope you guys like it! We are nearing the end of this series, and that means that the release of the sequel is fast approaching! Hope you guys are ready. I think by the time this is release, I should have the second chapter done! As of 7/12/2018, I had finished the first chapter! Go me!</small></p><p><small>Don\u2019t forget to leave a like/reblog/comment/send in an ask on your thoughts! I love hearing them! :)</small></p><p><small>- Kim</small></p></p>",

In that kingdom, the royal family had the freedom of marrying whoever his or her royal highness deems worthy. Now, of course, having that special privilege came with some interesting challenges, but that doesn\u2019t stop a certain head-strong princess from doing whatever her heart\u2019s desire, especially when she has her heart set on marrying her personal bodyguard. Unfortunately, her beliefs might face some hardships when a certain king sets his eye on her. Will her bodyguard continue to fight for her or is it finally her turn?</small></p><p><small>\u203b <b>Previously: </b><a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/175791445214/fight-for-me-ch1\">ch.1</a> | <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/175887448405/fight-for-me-ch2\">ch.2</a> | <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/175993838175/fight-for-me-ch3\">ch.3</a> | <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176061680692/fight-for-me-ch4\">ch.4</a><br></small></p><p><small>\u203b <b>Next Time:</b> <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176200520359/fight-for-me-ch6\">ch.6</a>\u00a0| <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176307635761/fight-for-me-final-chapter\">final chapter</a></small></p><hr><h2><i>Chapter 5: A Knight vs. A King</i></h2>[[MORE]]<p><i>Previously</i></p><p><i>Seokjin rubbed his nose against her cheek\nsweetly and said no. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThen\ndo not tease me, my dear knight!\u201d Sumin poked his cheek as the two neared the\nentrance of the dining room. </i></p><p><i>Seokjin simply laughed in response, \u201cI would\nnever, my sweet princess.\u201d He then untwined their fingers. \u201cNow, enjoy supper.\nIf you are good princess and tell your father about our decision, then I might\nvisit your chambers this evening.\u201d He whispered the last part in her ear. </i></p><p><i>Sumin felt a rush of pleasure as soon as he\nwhispered that. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMaybe\nif you are good knight and behave while King Ji Yong is doing his best to\nantagonize you, then I might let you.\u201d She teased back, smiling alluring at the\nknight as she walked away. </i></p><p><i>Seokjin could have sworn he felt his crotch\narea tightened. The thought of them being alone and intimate in her chambers\nsent his hormones into a wild frenzy. </i></p><p><i>Unfortunately, for them, someone else was\nlistening in on their conversation. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cA\nmidnight rendezvous? We shall see about that, my dear princess.\u201d</i></p><p>With eyes\nglued onto the silver plates, an awkward tension filled the dining hall.\nNothing but the sounds of the royal string quartet, playing a light yet\nsoothing melody, and the fire emitted a couple of crackles as Sumin pushed\naround her roasted vegetables with her fork. </p><p>Not\nonly she felt the predatory gaze from King Ji Yong, but also a pressured stare\nfrom her knight. Honestly, it would have been better if she had not fallen in\nlove. Her father never made a rule against a member of the royal ruling the\nkingdom by him or herself. </p><p>Why not\nSumin? Her father had told her stories of her great great-aunt ruling the\nkingdom by herself, and it turned out for the better\u2015granted\u2026that the kingdom\nexperienced a few months of despair and utter sadness, but that was the beside\nthe point. </p><p>Out of\nthe corner of his eye, Sumin\u2019s father noticed a solemn expression painted on\nher face. He briefly made eye-contact with his wife, and she too noticed the odd\nexpression on their daughter\u2019s face. The royal couple gazed upon each other as\nif they read each other\u2019s mind on what they should do or even say. Then, after\na couple more moments of silence, the king spoke. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDaughter, is there something wrong\nwith your dinner?\u201d He paused, beckoning for one of the servants to come to him.\n\u201cWould you like the cook to fix you up something even yummier?\u201d He asked as he\ntook a tiny sip of the sweet wine. </p><p>Sumin\nlifted her head, shaking it as she quickly denied that something was wrong with\nher food. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI guess I am simply not hungry,\nfather.\u201d She added, smiling warmly at him. </p><p>Sumin\u2019s\nfather raised a brow, finding it odd that his daughter did not have an\nappetite. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMy daughter not hungry? I find that\nquite amusing. Tell me, what is on your mind that caused a sudden loss of\nhunger?\u201d He asked, hating the fact that his daughter distracted and seemed a\nbit distant. </p><p>A short\nsigh exited her lips as Sumin glanced at Seokjin, establishing eye-contact\nbriefly, before directing her attention back to her father. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cFather, I am sure that you have\ngrown tired of my indecisiveness, but I swear to you on the Holy Father that\nthis will be my sudden change of heart.\u201d She began; her chest heaved slightly\nas the nerves settled in the pit of her stomach. </p><p>Both\nher father and morning leaned in their seats, unsure where the direction of the\nconversation headed. </p><p>Sumin\u2019s\nmother gestured for her to continue and so she did. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI know Seokjin and I have changed\nour decision countless of times, but this time we are completely serious. We\nare ready to become betrothed to one another and proceed with the next steps.\u201d\nShe announced, feeling a tiny weight lifted off her shoulders. </p><p>Sumin\u2019s\nfather eyed his daughter as he tapped his chin. Was his daughter playing tricks\non him yet again? Had she and her knight finally made up their minds and\nhearts? Was he going to live to see his only daughter\u2014his pride and joy\u2015wed?\nThank, the Lord. </p><p>With his\nindex and middle fingers, the king gestured for Seokjin to come hither. </p><p>Seokjin\nbowed his head and walked up to the dining table, secretly feeling triumphant\nas he secured Sumin\u2019s heart and their future together. </p><p>Ji Yong\non the other hand did not see that as a loss. If anything, he merely saw it as\nhumongous obstacle and now? It was time for drastic measures. </p><p>His\nears tuned into the happy discussion, but his mind and heart drifted somewhere\nelse. His evil mind began plotting a plan that would result with Sumin has his\nwife. His heart focused on how beautiful Sumin looked; her appearance enhanced\neven more as the fire dimmed in the room. It was because of that Ji Yong\nstarted to imagine what she would look like in complete darkness. With the moon\nilluminating their chambers, he could picture her magnificent breasts as her\nface contorted in pleasure. The pleasure that he so happily gave her. </p><p>God\u2026just\nthat mere thought got him excited. It also did not help that his lips still\ntingled from their passionate kiss in the library. He had tiny taste of her,\nand he desired more. He wanted to feel her precious lips all over his body. He\neven wanted to see them wrapped around his hardened length as she bobbed her\nhead slowly; the pleasure that only crescendos. \u00a0</p><p>The\nmore he indulged in his naughty thoughts, the more he failed to realize that\nSumin and Seokjin had excused themselves. </p><p>Finally\u2014he\npulled himself out of them. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cExcuse me. I need to fetch myself\nsome fresh air.\u201d Ji Yong announced, pushing his chair back. He bowed his head before\nwalking out of the hall. <br>\nSumin\u2019s parents watched Ji Yong until he disappeared from their sight. A long\nsigh escaped both their lips as they could not help but worry for their\ndaughter\u2019s happiness. </p><p>Even\nwith them discussing future wedding plans, Ji Yong did not seem bothered by it.\nIf anything, he simply ignored it. </p><p>Something\nabout the arrogant king did not settle with them whatsoever. Sumin\u2019s father had\nrecalled what the other kings had gossiped about King Ji Yong countless of\ntimes, and they always said that he would stop at nothing to obtain what his\nheart desires. He would even declare war if deemed necessary. </p><p>Sumin\u2019s\nfather was not sure if his body could handle an all-out war with another\nkingdom at his age. He was not frail, but he was not young either. Time, like\neverything else, always had interesting plans for the living\u2014so he silently\nprayed that time would show him mercy. </p><p>As the\nwaves crashed against the cliff , and the slight breeze that danced across the\ncourtyard, Sumin and Seokjin walked leisurely towards their favorite spot\u2014the\ngarden. Oh, the garden held many wonderful memories for them. It was the place\nwhere they shared their first mud war. Sumin won most of them. It was the place\nwhere they confessed their romantic feelings for one another. They also\nindulged in their first kiss\u2014and their second kiss. Now, the garden would soon\nhold another fond memory\u2014the day the two of them would wed. </p><p>With\nthe full Summer moon as their spotlight, and the sounds of laughter that\nemitted from them, the two lovers began reminiscing of the day their first met.\n</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAre you sure, my beloved? I for one\nremember that day quite differently.\u201d Sumin said as her thoughts drifted back\nto the day when she was only a little girl. Her father had presented her a\nhorse for her sixth birthday\u2014along with a certain newly appointed stable boy. </p><p><i>Dawning a hunter green dress, Sumin bunched\nthe skirt up enough to stop tripping over it when she tried to keep up with her\nfather. She was short, and her father was a giant in comparison. She had to run\nafter him if she wanted to stay by his side. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cFather!\nWhere are we going? I thought mother said I was not allowed to see my presents\nuntil after tonight\u2019s ball?\u201d Sumin asked as she continued to rush after her\nfather. </i></p><p><i>A short chuckle escaped his mouth as Sumin\u2019s\nfather made a sudden halt near the garden entryway. He did an about face and\ncrouched down, pushing his cape out of the way. He held out his arms and waited\nfor the arrival of his daughter.</i></p><p><i>Seeing his arms wide open, a bright smile\ngraced her face as Sumin ran full force into his chest, loving the warmth and\nlove he radiated. </i></p><p><i>Sumin\u2019s father stood up with his daughter\nsecured against his side and entered the garden. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\nknow that your mother wanted you to wait until after your birthday ball, but I\ncould not.\u201d Sumin\u2019s father replied as the two ventured deeper inside the\ngarden. </i></p><p><i>Sumin tilted her head slightly and just as\nshe opened her mouth to ask another question, the sounds of horses neighing\ncaptured her attention. </i></p><p><i>Her eyes lit up instantly as her eyes caught\nsight of two beautiful horses. One was brown and the other white. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cFather,\nare those horses for me?\u201d She asked, wanting to make sure she had been tasked\nto giving them away to another royal family as a gift. </i></p><p><i>Her father chuckled once again as he\ngraciously placed her down. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes,\nmy child. Those horses belong to you and\u2026\u201d He paused, whistling for his most\ntrusted stable worker to come forth. \u201cThis newly appointed stable boy will now\nwork underneath you. He will be taking care of your horses just like his father\ntakes care of mine.\u201d He finished as the stable worker and his son come into\nfull view.</i></p><p><i>Sumin turned around; her eyes trailed the boy\nup and down. A faint blush appeared upon her cheeks as she found the stable boy\nquite handsome. His lips were plump. His eyes dripped with eagerness and\ncharisma. In short, her ideal man. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPrincess\nSumin, may I introduce my son, Kim Seokjin, to you.\u201d The stable worker then\npushed his son towards her; the child\u2019s nose almost bumped into hers. </i></p><p><i>Sumin held out her hand for the boy to kiss,\nbut instead she got\u2026</i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cFather,\nI thought you said that I would find the \nprincess quite beautiful? She looks like a boy.\u201d Seokjin blurted out,\nunknowingly insulting the princess in the process.</i></p><p><i>Seokjin\u2019s father\u2019s jaw dropped just a bit. He\ncould not believe that his son chose now to be a smart mouth. </i></p><p><i>Sumin\u2019s father, on the other hand, found the\nboy quite hilarious. He definitely made a perfect fit for his daughter. Someone\nneeded to keep her head placed firmly on her shoulders. Oh\u2026he could not wait\nuntil they expressed romantic interests in one another. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMy\ndeepest apologies, your highness. My son apparently lost his mind.\u201d Seokjin\u2019s\nfather quickly said, bowing his head apologetically. </i></p><p><i>Sumin clenched her jaw as her eyes became\nslits. She took back what she said about Seokjin. He was rude and no way on\nthis Earth would she ever fall in love with him. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSumin,\nwhat do you say when someone apologizes?\u201d She heard her father ask, pulling her\nout her never-ending rants. </i></p><p><i>Sumin peered up at her father, \u201cI say that he\nor she is forgiven, and no offense was taken\u2026\u201d She muttered. </i></p><p><i>Sumin\u2019s father nodded, \u201cGood. Now, tell\nSeokjin that.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Sumin let out a long whine as she kicked the\nstone pathway. She then looked up to her father, who\u2014in return\u2014gave her a stern\nexpression and gestured her towards Seokjin.</i></p><p><i>She directed her attention towards the stable\nboy, and just as she opened her mouth to accept the apology\u2014a devious idea\nplanted in her mind. </i></p><p><i>She mustered the sweetest smile ever and held\nout hand, waiting for him to shake it. </i></p><p><i>Seokjin eyed her hand oddly, sensing this\nquestionable aura around the princess, but ignored it since his father would\nwhoop him if he offended the princess yet again. </i></p><p><i>He slowly extended out his hand, closing the\ngap an inch at a time, and just as their fingertips touched, Seokjin felt a sharp\npain shoot up his arm. </i></p><p><i>A loud shout came out of his mouth as Sumin\nforcibly bent his fingers back. She then hooked her leg around his and managed\nto trip him. She climbed on top of him, and the two children began to wrestle\nin the grass. </i></p><p><i>The two fathers watched their offspring with\nsuch amusement as they found it funny that the two children just met and\nalready playing as if they had been friends since birth. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou\nstill look like a boy!\u201d Seokjin taunted as he struggled to fend off the\nhigh-tempered princess.</i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSo?\nI rather look like a boy and hit like one instead of looking like and hitting\nlike a girl!\u201d Sumin retorted as she managed to pin the poor boy down\u2014in mud. </i></p><p><i>Seokjin growled and used up all his strength\nto turn the tides. Sadly, that had been proven futile. Sumin inherited her\nincredible stubbornness from her mother. Allowing the enemy to have the upper\nhand was not in Sumin\u2019s book.</i></p><p><i>Before the two of them could be completely\ncovered in muck, the fathers finally intervened, easily pulling them off of\neach other. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell,\nI had to have to say that this has been quite an eventful first meeting, don\u2019t\nyou agree, Master Kim?\u201d Sumin\u2019s father asked, holding his daughter tightly\nagainst his legs. </i></p><p><i>Master Kim laughed, \u201cI agree, your majesty. I\nthink my son has finally found his match.\u201d </i></p><p><i>Sumin\u2019s father laughed as well, nodding in\nhis head, while Sumin and Seokjin merely stuck their tongues at each other. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMaybe\nwe can invite Seokjin to your birthday gala as a special guest? What do you\nsay, my precious jewel?\u201d Her father asked Sumin, causing the young girl to stop\nwith the taunts. </i></p><p><i>Sumin gawked, \u201cI rather invite a humpback\nwhale.\u201d </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhy?\nYou are already there, princess\u2026\u201d Seokjin said, smirking smugly.</i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhy\nI ought to!\u201d She shouted as she escaped her father\u2019s clutches and tackled\nSeokjin back to the ground.</i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\nwonder how their friendship will play out if they are already this close to one\nanother?\u201d </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cForget\nthe friendship, their romantic bond shall be one interesting event to witness.\u201d\n</i></p><p>His\nbody ached at that not-so-fond memory. Seokjin had yet to wrap his head around\nthe fact that Sumin managed to pin him down like it was nothing. </p><p>Sumin,\non the other, smiled proudly to herself. Not only did she prove her handsome\nknight wrong, but she had the opportunity to remember the day she won her first\nmatch with the boy. </p><p>Seokjin\nrested his hand on top of hers as he placed a sweet kiss on her cheek.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI still cannot believe that this\ngarden always had mud laying around.\u201d He said; his eyes scanned the garden,\ntaking note of the many tiny mud piles. </p><p>Sumin\ngiggled softly, \u201cMaybe the palace gardeners knew that you and I liked to play\nin the mud when we were only mere children.\u201d</p><p>Seokjin\nshook his head softly before resting his chin on his princess\u2019s shoulder. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWe shared many firsts here, and\nwould you like to know what is my favorite?\u201d He asked, placing a soft kiss on\nher weak spot\u2014the base of her neck. </p><p>A soft\nsigh left her lips as Sumin turned to face her beloved.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat?\u201d She asked softly,\npractically a whisper. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThis.\u201d He whispered as he cupped\nher cheek sweetly and captured her lips. </p><p>Sumin\nclosed her eyes and placed her free hand on the back of his neck. She pulled\nhim closer as the kiss slowly intensified. It was if their minds synchronized\nwith each other. </p><p>Seokjin\u2019s\ntongue lightly brushed against her bottom, causing the young princess to emit a\ntiny moan. </p><p>Just\nthat tiny moan alone excited him. He placed his hands on her lower back and\npulled her closer, as if that was even possible. His fingers played with the\nstrings of her dress, wanting nothing more to undo them. However, he stopped\nhimself. The back of his mind telling him that there was someone watching. A\ncertain someone that kissed his princess earlier. That someone being the king\nthat failed in obtaining Sumin\u2019s hand in marriage. King Ji Yong. </p><p>Not\nwanting to give the scheming king another second of their romantic moment,\nSeokjin pulled away. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI think it is time for the princess\nto retire to her chambers for the night.\u201d He then leaned close to her ear, his\nlips practically pressed against it. \u201cI also think, it is time for a certain\nknight to pay said princess a visit.\u201d He whispered alluringly; his hot breath\nsent shivers up her spine. </p><p>Not\nbeing able to form words let alone a full sentence, Sumin simply nodded with a\ndreamy like smile written on her face. </p><p>Seokjin\ncould not help but find Sumin absolutely adorable. He did not think he would\ncause her to become this mindless, lovesick person but then again, she had that\neffect on him. She just did not know it yet. </p><p>Taking\nher hand gently into his as he stood up, Seokjin bowed his head and asked\npermission if he could escort her back to her chambers. Of course, Sumin gave\nhim permission but smacked him lightly on the shoulder for being rather\nembarrassing. </p><p>Seokjin\nplaced his free hand over his heart and feigned being insulted. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell, I guess the princess can find\nher way back to her chambers by herself.\u201d He said firmly, untangling their\nfingers from one another. </p><p>Sumin\ncocked up her brow and gave him a look before shrugging and walking away. </p><p>Seokjin\u2019s\nmouth became agape as he watched the love of his life retreat. He quickly\nsnapped back into his senses and chased after the woman. </p><p>He\neasily caught up with her and grabbed her waist, causing the girl to laugh. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWho gave you permission to leave\nme?\u201d He asked; his tone tinted with slight darkness.</p><p>Sumin\nonly smirked in response before removing his hands from her body. Then, she\nwalked away from him, halting underneath the archway of the garden entrance.\nShe peered over her shoulder and with an alluring smile painted on her face,\nshe said,</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhy not follow me to my chambers,\nand I shall tell you the answer?\u201d </p><p>Seokjin\nfelt his hormones awaken. His lover knew how to rile him up to the point of him\nwanting to pin her against the wall and devour her lips as his hands traced\nevery curvature on her body\u2015her naked body. </p><p>Not\neven a second later, he pursued after her, loving their little game they played\nwhenever they felt the need to spice up their romance. God, Seokjin could only\nimagine what actual sex with Sumin would be like. Maybe tonight was the night.\nThe night two hearts become one. </p><p>As\nSeokjin disappeared off into the night, trailing after the owner of his heart,\na certain king finally emerges from his hiding spot. His blood boiled after\nhaving to endure such a disgusting sight. </p><p>Ji Yong\nclenched his fists as his mind became plagued with the scene of Seokjin and\nSumin kissing one another. His lowly hands embracing the temple that was her\nbody. His sweet whispers that invaded her ears. Everything about this night\nsickened him. Ji Yong felt incredibly jealous and possessive over Sumin, and to\nwitness her loving someone pathetic knight pissed him off. </p><p>A loud\ngrowl emitted from his mouth as Ji Yong suddenly unsheathed his sword and swung\nviolently. His sword managed to cut a few branches from a nearby bush. </p><p>Ji Yong\neyed the fallen branch; his furious mind pretended that it was Seokjin\u2019s head.\nThen\u2015as if something possessed him\u2014Ji Yong calmly sheathed his sword, inhaled\nthen exhaled nice and slow, and stared off into the distance as the nightly\nsea-breeze fanned his face. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI am going to miss this kingdom\u2026\u201d\nHe thought evilly to himself as his brain concocted the most devious plan that\nwould ensure Sumin\u2019s hand in marriage. Too bad that Seokjin would not be in\nattendance. Don\u2019t you love war? </p><p>Currently\nbrushing out the knots in her hair, Sumin hummed a little tune to herself as\nthe night breeze entered her room. The soft blow brushed past her curtains and\nflowed right by her, causing the hairs on her arm to stand up. </p><p>The\nsounds of a fire crackling filled her body with nothing but relaxation. She did\nnot understand why something so little as the sound of fire crackling put her\nmind at ease, but it did. That was until a light knock on her door interrupted\nit. Just that tiny knock caused butterflies to flutter in the pit of her belly.\n</p><p>She\nmuttered a quick enter before undoing the first bow of her nightgown. She\npulled it apart just a smidge, enough to show a bit of cleavage as her eyes\nstared at the door in anticipation. </p><p>Slowly,\na familiar face appeared in her sight. Then, his entire body came into full\nview. </p><p>Her\neyes widened and her mouth agape once she saw his appearance. Instead of his\nusual knightly attire, which consisted mainly of metal covering his entire\ntorso, he now wore a light cotton shirt, black pants, a belt that was lazily\ntied around his waist, and riding boots. His hair was even messy. </p><p>Something\nabout his unprofessional appearance aroused Sumin to the point that she\ncaptured his lips and untucked his shirt. </p><p>Seokjin\nsighed into the kiss as his arms wrapped around her waist. He then carried her\nbridal-style and walked over to the bed. </p><p>He\nbroke the kiss, for only a second; his eyes bore into hers. </p><p>The\nemotion in his eyes were purely lust and love. Nothing else mattered to him\nexcept one thing\u2014giving her his virginity and taking hers in return. </p><p>Without\nsaying a word, he undid the belt and dropped it onto the floor, creating a loud\nclink. He pulled his shirt over his head, revealing his well-toned chest, and\ntossed it aside. </p><p>Sumin\ncontinued to eye him innocently, though, her core told a different story. Her\nclit ached\u2014begged to be touched by him. She closed her thighs together, hoping\nthe tightness would distract her aching core, but it only made it worse. </p><p>His\nbrow raised just a smidge as Seokjin heard a few tiny moans come from his\nprincess. Her innocent eyes remained on his as he quickly kicked off his boots,\nnot wanting to keep his woman waiting any longer. He undid the buttons of his\npants, though, not taking them off. </p><p>A tiny\nwhine left her lips as Sumin hoped to see what lied underneath. She hadn\u2019t seen\nhis <i>friend</i> since the night of her\nparty. It had been too long. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAre you teasing me, my knight?\u201d She\nasked with an alluring smile.</p><p>Seokjin\nmerely smirked as he walked over to her fireplace and threw water on it; the\nsound of sizzles entered the room. </p><p>Nothing\nbut the moonlight illuminated her chambers as Sumin\u2019s breathing grew heavy from\nanticipation. Then, she felt a shift in her bed. </p><p>Before\nshe could say a word, her cheeks were cupped followed by an innocent kiss on\nher lips. </p><p>Seokjin\npulled away; his lips still hovered over hers. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI know waiting for our wedding\nnight is the proper action to take, but I simply cannot. I need you, Sumin.\u201d He\nlightly rubbed her lips with his, \u201cPlease, tell me that you feel the same way.\u201d\nHe whispered softly as his heart pounded against his chest. </p><p>Sumin\nstared at him for a moment. Then, instead of speaking, she passionately kissed\nhim. She poured every ounce of love and want she had for the man. She too\nwanted him in every possible way. </p><p>She\nquickly undid the rest of the strings and slid the nightgown of her shoulders.\nShe pushed the sleeves down until her arms were free. </p><p>With\nher breasts in full view, something in Seokjin snapped. He devoured her lips\nagain as he gently pushed her onto the mattress. </p><p>A soft\nmoan escaped her lips as Seokjin\u2019s hands trailed up and down her thighs,\nigniting a tiny trail of fire with each passing. </p><p>Sumin\ndidn\u2019t know what possessed her, but she lifted up her leg and hooked it around his\nwaist. </p><p>Her\ncore pressed into his crotch, creating this friction that only left an intense\ndesire. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI need you, Seokjin\u2026\u201d She begged\nsoftly as he directed his lips away from her lips and onto her neck. </p><p>Seokjin\nsmirked against her skin, pausing in his little assault. He lifted his head;\nhis lust filled gaze met hers. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDid I just hear the princess beg\nfor me?\u201d He teased as his fingers teased her entrance. </p><p>Sumin\nwhined, feeling his thumb graze over her clit, \u201cY-yes\u2026\u201d </p><p>Seokjin\npushed one finger into her, loving how wet she had become just by his kisses\nalone. He added another one before slowly pumping his index and middle fingers\nin and out. </p><p>Sumin\ngasped in pleasure as she tilted her head and arched her back, giving Seokjin a\nfull view of her hardened nipples. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDamn\u2026\u201d He mentally cursed as he\nlicked his lips.</p><p>Tiny\nmoans left one by one as Sumin felt something in the pit of her stomach. A feeling\nshe hadn\u2019t experienced since their one night alone in the abandoned room. </p><p>Feeling\nher walls constrict against his fingers, Seokjin quickened his pace as his lips\nattached to hers, swallowing her moans as they grown louder.</p><p>His\nfingers pumped in and out of her. His thumb vigorously rubbed her clit.</p><p>God,\nfeeling her like this made him want to pleasure himself\u2014and so he did. Seokjin\nreached inside his pants and wrapped his free hand around his aching member. He\nmatched the pace of his fingers as the urge to release soon came over him. </p><p>He\npumped her and himself one last time before small strips of white landed on the\ninside of his pants. Her juices coated his fingers as both Seokjin and Sumin\nbreathed heavily.</p><p>Sumin\nsat up and showered his bare shoulder with tiny pecks as she watched him suck\nthe juices off his finger.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI shall never forget the taste of\nmy princess for as long as I live.\u201d Seokjin announced, smirking. </p><p>Sumin\nshook her head before kissing his plump lips slowly yet teasingly. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI wish I could have tasted you,\nSeokjin\u2026\u201d She pouted cutely as her hands played with his pants, wanting nothing\nmore to take them off. She messed with the waistband as her fingers slowly\ndisappeared inside, but not reaching his cock quite yet. </p><p>A soft\nchuckle left his lips as he couldn\u2019t help but shake his head. His princess\nalways loved hinting rather than telling.</p><p>Finally\ntaking the hint, Seokjin pushed down his pants and kicked them off the bed. He\nthen removed the nightgown completely from her body. He bunched the light\nclothing material and tossed it over his shoulder. </p><p>Sumin\ncouldn\u2019t help but giggle at his childish act; however, it was short lived. Her\nbody was pinned underneath him; her wrists were positioned above her head. </p><p>Her\nbreasts pressed against his chest as his knee settled in between her thighs. </p><p>A\nblanket silence covered the room as the two lovers remained still, staring into\neach other\u2019s souls. This moment of intimacy had officially become intense.\nLying in silence as with their naked bodies in complete view was honestly\nspecial to them.</p><p>Sure,\nthey shared acts of intimacy as they had touched each other\u2019s bodies as lovers,\nbut right now? It was different. Neither one of them could explain it, but\ntheir hearts knew what this was. Their minds knew what this was. No words were\nneeded. </p><p>Slowly,\nSeokjin lowered himself down as he used his free hand to pump his member. </p><p>In a\nmatter of seconds, he was erect again. He then checked to see if Sumin was\nready to receive him, and she was. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMy deepest apologies, my princess,\nbut this might hurt you for a bit or at least feel uncomfortable. I will not\nact any further without your consent, okay?\u201d He said softly and sweetly as he\nteased her entrance with his tip. </p><p>Sumin\nsmiled warmly at him and nodded her head. Again, no words were needed. Not\nanymore. </p><p>Seokjin\nreleased his hold on her wrists as he cupped her chin, tilting her head up\nslightly. He kissed her lips sweetly; his tongue entered her mouth, as slowly\npushed himself inside her. </p><p>Sumin\u2019s\nface slowly contorted in discomfort. She felt her walls stretch the more he\nentered her. His size wasn\u2019t helping either. It wasn\u2019t like he was humongous,\nbut he wasn\u2019t tiny. </p><p>She\nbreathed heavily through her nostrils as Seokjin pulled out and then entered\nonce more. He repeated that action even though she didn\u2019t give him permission\nto do so. </p><p>Eventually,\nthe feeling of discomfort vanished. Then, only a ping of pleasure was left.\nThat tiny ping had been enough for Sumin to give him permission to move faster,\nwhich he did. </p><p>His\nthrusts sped up as both the warmth and wetness riled his sex drive to the point\nthat he just had to take her. His mind went into a frenzy as he thought of\nnothing else but to make Sumin moan and come undone again.</p><p>Her\nmoans increased in volume as the sounds bounced off the stone walls of her\nroom. In her state of mind, she didn\u2019t care if someone heard, especially that\nstupid King Ji Yong. Little did she know\u2026 she would regret that feeling since\nhe found himself wandering around near her room when he heard the sounds of\npassionate lovemaking. </p><p>Curiosity\ngot the best of him as he peeped through the keyhole and saw that lowly knight\nhaving sex with <i>his</i> future-wife.\nYup\u2026seeing them like that solidified his plan. Now, it was time to execute it. </p><p>Ji Yong\nstepped away from the door just as he heard Seokjin manage to tell Sumin that\nhe loved her. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI l-love you too\u2026Seokjin\u2026\u201d Sumin\nmanaged to say through her endless moans and pants.</p><p>Seokjin\nsmiled as he lifted her leg and rested it on his wide shoulder. He then leaned\nforward, loving the new angle that they were in as he continued his thrusting. </p><p>It was\nthanks to this angle that Sumin began to see stars. His cock managed to hit her\ng-spot here and there, sending waves of pleasure throughout her body. She\ncraved more. She needed more. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHit that s-spot again, my beloved.\u201d\nShe moaned out as she fisted the sheets.</p><p>Seokjin\nsimply nodded and did as he was told. He tried his hardest to hit that special\nspot repeatedly; however, if he couldn\u2019t, the he resorted in rubbing her clit.\nNow, that spot got her a moaning mess\u2014and he loved every second of it. </p><p>Sounds\nof moaning and skin-on-skin contact continued to fill the room as it seemed\nlike hours had gone by since they first began. Honestly, they didn\u2019t care how\nlong it had been since their hearts were telling them that this might be the\nlast time they would be this intimate. At the same, they paid little to no\nattention to what their hearts were saying because lust had taken control. What\nmattered was that they were together now. </p><p>The\npleasure became too much as one more thrust would make Sumin see white, and\nSeokjin felt the same. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cR-ready to cum for me, princess?\u201d\nHe grunted as his thrusts slowly became sloppy. </p><p>Sumin\nonly nodded as her intellect disappeared hours ago. </p><p>With one last thrust, Seokjin released inside of her while\nSumin released all over him; their juices mixed with one another. His thrusts\nhad become incredibly sloppy as he emptied himself before collapsing on top of\nSumin. </p><p>Sumin panted heavily as she absentmindedly played with\nSeokjin\u2019s sweaty hair. </p><p>Seokjin sighed in content before mustering the remaining\nstrength he had left to pull out of her. The moment he did that, he instantly\nmissed her warmth. </p><p>He then lazily rolled over to the right side of the bed and\npulled her tainted sheets over them. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt occurred\nto me that we need to explain to your nurse about your sheets.\u201d Seokjin mumbled\nas he draped his arm over Sumin\u2019s bare waist. </p><p>Sumin gave him look, though he couldn\u2019t see it. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat do you\n\u2018we need to explain\u2019? I am more than likely going to explain it to her myself\nwhile you magically disappear.\u201d She stated as Seokjin leaned down to lightly\nbite her nose. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHow about\nthis\u2026you explain to the nurse and I will ask your parents for an audience to\ndiscuss wedding plans.\u201d He suggested; his fingers lightly caressed her skin.</p><p>Sumin closed her eyes as they had grown to heavy too keep open\nand simply hummed in response. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI love you,\nmy one and only princess. The keeper of my heart. My everything.\u201d He whispered\nsweetly before drifting off towards dreamland, where his mind could finally\nrest and think about nothing else, but a married life with Sumin. </p><p>Except\u2026 there was something wrong with that plan\u2026</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Who said that it would be <i>his\n</i>married life with Sumin?</p><hr><p><small><b>A/N: </b>Okay for the life of me, I could not figured out how to label the last smut warning. I mean, I settled for\u00a0\u201cpenetration\u201d because that\u2019s what Sumin &amp; Seokjin did. Let\u2019s be real here! LOL I\u2019ll change it, if you guys feel that it is not correct. Maybe I\u2019ll just change it to\u00a0\u201csex scene\u201d though\u2026 I think that\u2019s what\u00a0\u201cSMUT\u201d entails. Agh\u2026 this is frustrating me. Anyway, I hope you guys like it! We are nearing the end of this series, and that means that the release of the sequel is fast approaching! Hope you guys are ready. I think by the time this is release, I should have the second chapter done! As of 7/12/2018, I had finished the first chapter!

In that kingdom, the royal family had the freedom of marrying whoever his or her royal highness deems worthy. Now, of course, having that special privilege came with some interesting challenges, but that doesn&rsquo;t stop a certain head-strong princess from doing whatever her heart&rsquo;s desire, especially when she has her heart set on marrying her personal bodyguard. Unfortunately, her beliefs might face some hardships when a certain king sets his eye on her.

The thought of them being alone and intimate in her chambers\nsent his hormones into a wild frenzy. </i></p><p><i>Unfortunately, for them, someone else was\nlistening in on their conversation. </i></p><p><i> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;A\nmidnight rendezvous? We shall see about that, my dear princess.&rdquo;</i></p><p>With eyes\nglued onto the silver plates, an awkward tension filled the dining hall.\nNothing but the sounds of the royal string quartet, playing a light yet\nsoothing melody, and the fire emitted a couple of crackles as Sumin pushed\naround her roasted vegetables with her fork. </p><p>Not\nonly she felt the predatory gaze from King Ji Yong, but also a pressured stare\nfrom her knight. Honestly, it would have been better if she had not fallen in\nlove. Her father never made a rule against a member of the royal ruling the\nkingdom by him or herself. </p><p>Why not\nSumin? Her father had told her stories of her great great-aunt ruling the\nkingdom by herself, and it turned out for the better&#8213;granted&hellip;that the kingdom\nexperienced a few months of despair and utter sadness, but that was the beside\nthe point. </p><p>Out of\nthe corner of his eye, Sumin&rsquo;s father noticed a solemn expression painted on\nher face. He briefly made eye-contact with his wife, and she too noticed the odd\nexpression on their daughter&rsquo;s face. The royal couple gazed upon each other as\nif they read each other&rsquo;s mind on what they should do or even say. Then, after\na couple more moments of silence, the king spoke. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Daughter, is there something wrong\nwith your dinner?&rdquo; He paused, beckoning for one of the servants to come to him.\n&ldquo;Would you like the cook to fix you up something even yummier?&rdquo; He asked as he\ntook a tiny sip of the sweet wine. </p><p>Sumin\nlifted her head, shaking it as she quickly denied that something was wrong with\nher food. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I guess I am simply not hungry,\nfather.&rdquo; She added, smiling warmly at him. </p><p>Sumin&rsquo;s\nfather raised a brow, finding it odd that his daughter did not have an\nappetite. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;My daughter not hungry? I find that\nquite amusing. Tell me, what is on your mind that caused a sudden loss of\nhunger?&rdquo; He asked, hating the fact that his daughter distracted and seemed a\nbit distant. </p><p>A short\nsigh exited her lips as Sumin glanced at Seokjin, establishing eye-contact\nbriefly, before directing her attention back to her father. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Father, I am sure that you have\ngrown tired of my indecisiveness, but I swear to you on the Holy Father that\nthis will be my sudden change of heart.&rdquo; She began; her chest heaved slightly\nas the nerves settled in the pit of her stomach. </p><p>Both\nher father and morning leaned in their seats, unsure where the direction of the\nconversation headed. </p><p>Sumin&rsquo;s\nmother gestured for her to continue and so she did. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I know Seokjin and I have changed\nour decision countless of times, but this time we are completely serious. We\nare ready to become betrothed to one another and proceed with the next steps.&rdquo;\nShe announced, feeling a tiny weight lifted off her shoulders. </p><p>Sumin&rsquo;s\nfather eyed his daughter as he tapped his chin. Was his daughter playing tricks\non him yet again? Had she and her knight finally made up their minds and\nhearts? Was he going to live to see his only daughter&mdash;his pride and joy&#8213;wed?\nThank, the Lord. </p><p>With his\nindex and middle fingers, the king gestured for Seokjin to come hither. </p><p>Seokjin\nbowed his head and walked up to the dining table, secretly feeling triumphant\nas he secured Sumin&rsquo;s heart and their future together. </p><p>Ji Yong\non the other hand did not see that as a loss. If anything, he merely saw it as\nhumongous obstacle and now? It was time for drastic measures. </p><p>His\nears tuned into the happy discussion, but his mind and heart drifted somewhere\nelse. His evil mind began plotting a plan that would result with Sumin has his\nwife. His heart focused on how beautiful Sumin looked; her appearance enhanced\neven more as the fire dimmed in the room. It was because of that Ji Yong\nstarted to imagine what she would look like in complete darkness. With the moon\nilluminating their chambers, he could picture her magnificent breasts as her\nface contorted in pleasure. The pleasure that he so happily gave her. </p><p>God&hellip;just\nthat mere thought got him excited. It also did not help that his lips still\ntingled from their passionate kiss in the library. He had tiny taste of her,\nand he desired more. He wanted to feel her precious lips all over his body. He\neven wanted to see them wrapped around his hardened length as she bobbed her\nhead slowly; the pleasure that only crescendos. &nbsp;</p><p>The\nmore he indulged in his naughty thoughts, the more he failed to realize that\nSumin and Seokjin had excused themselves. </p><p>Finally&mdash;he\npulled himself out of them. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Excuse me. I need to fetch myself\nsome fresh air.&rdquo; Ji Yong announced, pushing his chair back. He bowed his head before\nwalking out of the hall. <br />\nSumin&rsquo;s parents watched Ji Yong until he disappeared from their sight. A long\nsigh escaped both their lips as they could not help but worry for their\ndaughter&rsquo;s happiness. </p><p>Even\nwith them discussing future wedding plans, Ji Yong did not seem bothered by it.\nIf anything, he simply ignored it. </p><p>Something\nabout the arrogant king did not settle with them whatsoever. Sumin&rsquo;s father had\nrecalled what the other kings had gossiped about King Ji Yong countless of\ntimes, and they always said that he would stop at nothing to obtain what his\nheart desires. He would even declare war if deemed necessary. </p><p>Sumin&rsquo;s\nfather was not sure if his body could handle an all-out war with another\nkingdom at his age. He was not frail, but he was not young either. Time, like\neverything else, always had interesting plans for the living&mdash;so he silently\nprayed that time would show him mercy. </p><p>As the\nwaves crashed against the cliff , and the slight breeze that danced across the\ncourtyard, Sumin and Seokjin walked leisurely towards their favorite spot&mdash;the\ngarden. Oh, the garden held many wonderful memories for them. It was the place\nwhere they shared their first mud war. Sumin won most of them. It was the place\nwhere they confessed their romantic feelings for one another. They also\nindulged in their first kiss&mdash;and their second kiss. Now, the garden would soon\nhold another fond memory&mdash;the day the two of them would wed. </p><p>With\nthe full Summer moon as their spotlight, and the sounds of laughter that\nemitted from them, the two lovers began reminiscing of the day their first met.\n</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Are you sure, my beloved? I for one\nremember that day quite differently.&rdquo; Sumin said as her thoughts drifted back\nto the day when she was only a little girl. Her father had presented her a\nhorse for her sixth birthday&mdash;along with a certain newly appointed stable boy. </p><p><i>Dawning a hunter green dress, Sumin bunched\nthe skirt up enough to stop tripping over it when she tried to keep up with her\nfather. She was short, and her father was a giant in comparison. She had to run\nafter him if she wanted to stay by his side. </i></p><p><i> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Father!\nWhere are we going? I thought mother said I was not allowed to see my presents\nuntil after tonight&rsquo;s ball?&rdquo; Sumin asked as she continued to rush after her\nfather. </i></p><p><i>A short chuckle escaped his mouth as Sumin&rsquo;s\nfather made a sudden halt near the garden entryway. He did an about face and\ncrouched down, pushing his cape out of the way. He held out his arms and waited\nfor the arrival of his daughter.</i></p><p><i>Seeing his arms wide open, a bright smile\ngraced her face as Sumin ran full force into his chest, loving the warmth and\nlove he radiated. </i></p><p><i>Sumin&rsquo;s father stood up with his daughter\nsecured against his side and entered the garden. </i></p><p><i> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I\nknow that your mother wanted you to wait until after your birthday ball, but I\ncould not.&rdquo; Sumin&rsquo;s father replied as the two ventured deeper inside the\ngarden. </i></p><p><i>Sumin tilted her head slightly and just as\nshe opened her mouth to ask another question, the sounds of horses neighing\ncaptured her attention. </i></p><p><i>Her eyes lit up instantly as her eyes caught\nsight of two beautiful horses. One was brown and the other white. </i></p><p><i> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Father,\nare those horses for me?&rdquo; She asked, wanting to make sure she had been tasked\nto giving them away to another royal family as a gift. </i></p><p><i>Her father chuckled once again as he\ngraciously placed her down. </i></p><p><i> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Yes,\nmy child. Those horses belong to you and&hellip;&rdquo; He paused, whistling for his most\ntrusted stable worker to come forth. &ldquo;This newly appointed stable boy will now\nwork underneath you. He will be taking care of your horses just like his father\ntakes care of mine.&rdquo; He finished as the stable worker and his son come into\nfull view.</i></p><p><i>Sumin turned around; her eyes trailed the boy\nup and down. A faint blush appeared upon her cheeks as she found the stable boy\nquite handsome. His lips were plump. His eyes dripped with eagerness and\ncharisma. In short, her ideal man. </i></p><p><i> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Princess\nSumin, may I introduce my son, Kim Seokjin, to you.&rdquo; The stable worker then\npushed his son towards her; the child&rsquo;s nose almost bumped into hers. </i></p><p><i>Sumin held out her hand for the boy to kiss,\nbut instead she got&hellip;</i></p><p><i> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Father,\nI thought you said that I would find the \nprincess quite beautiful? She looks like a boy.&rdquo; Seokjin blurted out,\nunknowingly insulting the princess in the process.</i></p><p><i>Seokjin&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s jaw dropped just a bit. He\ncould not believe that his son chose now to be a smart mouth. </i></p><p><i>Sumin&rsquo;s father, on the other hand, found the\nboy quite hilarious. He definitely made a perfect fit for his daughter. Someone\nneeded to keep her head placed firmly on her shoulders. Oh&hellip;he could not wait\nuntil they expressed romantic interests in one another. </i></p><p><i> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;My\ndeepest apologies, your highness. My son apparently lost his mind.&rdquo; Seokjin&rsquo;s\nfather quickly said, bowing his head apologetically. </i></p><p><i>Sumin clenched her jaw as her eyes became\nslits. She took back what she said about Seokjin. He was rude and no way on\nthis Earth would she ever fall in love with him. </i></p><p><i> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Sumin,\nwhat do you say when someone apologizes?&rdquo; She heard her father ask, pulling her\nout her never-ending rants. </i></p><p><i>Sumin peered up at her father, &ldquo;I say that he\nor she is forgiven, and no offense was taken&hellip;&rdquo; She muttered. </i></p><p><i>Sumin&rsquo;s father nodded, &ldquo;Good. Now, tell\nSeokjin that.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Sumin let out a long whine as she kicked the\nstone pathway. She then looked up to her father, who&mdash;in return&mdash;gave her a stern\nexpression and gestured her towards Seokjin.</i></p><p><i>She directed her attention towards the stable\nboy, and just as she opened her mouth to accept the apology&mdash;a devious idea\nplanted in her mind. </i></p><p><i>She mustered the sweetest smile ever and held\nout hand, waiting for him to shake it. </i></p><p><i>Seokjin eyed her hand oddly, sensing this\nquestionable aura around the princess, but ignored it since his father would\nwhoop him if he offended the princess yet again. </i></p><p><i>He slowly extended out his hand, closing the\ngap an inch at a time, and just as their fingertips touched, Seokjin felt a sharp\npain shoot up his arm. </i></p><p><i>A loud shout came out of his mouth as Sumin\nforcibly bent his fingers back. She then hooked her leg around his and managed\nto trip him. She climbed on top of him, and the two children began to wrestle\nin the grass. </i></p><p><i>The two fathers watched their offspring with\nsuch amusement as they found it funny that the two children just met and\nalready playing as if they had been friends since birth. </i></p><p><i> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You\nstill look like a boy!&rdquo; Seokjin taunted as he struggled to fend off the\nhigh-tempered princess.</i></p><p><i> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;So?\nI rather look like a boy and hit like one instead of looking like and hitting\nlike a girl!&rdquo; Sumin retorted as she managed to pin the poor boy down&mdash;in mud. </i></p><p><i>Seokjin growled and used up all his strength\nto turn the tides. Sadly, that had been proven futile. Sumin inherited her\nincredible stubbornness from her mother. Allowing the enemy to have the upper\nhand was not in Sumin&rsquo;s book.</i></p><p><i>Before the two of them could be completely\ncovered in muck, the fathers finally intervened, easily pulling them off of\neach other. </i></p><p><i> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Well,\nI had to have to say that this has been quite an eventful first meeting, don&rsquo;t\nyou agree, Master Kim?&rdquo; Sumin&rsquo;s father asked, holding his daughter tightly\nagainst his legs. </i></p><p><i>Master Kim laughed, &ldquo;I agree, your majesty. I\nthink my son has finally found his match.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>Sumin&rsquo;s father laughed as well, nodding in\nhis head, while Sumin and Seokjin merely stuck their tongues at each other. </i></p><p><i> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Maybe\nwe can invite Seokjin to your birthday gala as a special guest? What do you\nsay, my precious jewel?&rdquo; Her father asked Sumin, causing the young girl to stop\nwith the taunts. </i></p><p><i>Sumin gawked, &ldquo;I rather invite a humpback\nwhale.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Why?\nYou are already there, princess&hellip;&rdquo; Seokjin said, smirking smugly.</i></p><p><i> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Why\nI ought to!&rdquo; She shouted as she escaped her father&rsquo;s clutches and tackled\nSeokjin back to the ground.</i></p><p><i> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I\nwonder how their friendship will play out if they are already this close to one\nanother?&rdquo; </i></p><p><i> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Forget\nthe friendship, their romantic bond shall be one interesting event to witness.&rdquo;\n</i></p><p>His\nbody ached at that not-so-fond memory. Seokjin had yet to wrap his head around\nthe fact that Sumin managed to pin him down like it was nothing. </p><p>Sumin,\non the other, smiled proudly to herself. Not only did she prove her handsome\nknight wrong, but she had the opportunity to remember the day she won her first\nmatch with the boy. </p><p>Seokjin\nrested his hand on top of hers as he placed a sweet kiss on her cheek.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I still cannot believe that this\ngarden always had mud laying around.&rdquo; He said; his eyes scanned the garden,\ntaking note of the many tiny mud piles. </p><p>Sumin\ngiggled softly, &ldquo;Maybe the palace gardeners knew that you and I liked to play\nin the mud when we were only mere children.&rdquo;</p><p>Seokjin\nshook his head softly before resting his chin on his princess&rsquo;s shoulder. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;We shared many firsts here, and\nwould you like to know what is my favorite?&rdquo; He asked, placing a soft kiss on\nher weak spot&mdash;the base of her neck. </p><p>A soft\nsigh left her lips as Sumin turned to face her beloved.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;What?&rdquo; She asked softly,\npractically a whisper. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;This.&rdquo; He whispered as he cupped\nher cheek sweetly and captured her lips. </p><p>Sumin\nclosed her eyes and placed her free hand on the back of his neck. She pulled\nhim closer as the kiss slowly intensified. It was if their minds synchronized\nwith each other. </p><p>Seokjin&rsquo;s\ntongue lightly brushed against her bottom, causing the young princess to emit a\ntiny moan. </p><p>Just\nthat tiny moan alone excited him. He placed his hands on her lower back and\npulled her closer, as if that was even possible. His fingers played with the\nstrings of her dress, wanting nothing more to undo them. However, he stopped\nhimself. The back of his mind telling him that there was someone watching. A\ncertain someone that kissed his princess earlier. That someone being the king\nthat failed in obtaining Sumin&rsquo;s hand in marriage. King Ji Yong. </p><p>Not\nwanting to give the scheming king another second of their romantic moment,\nSeokjin pulled away. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I think it is time for the princess\nto retire to her chambers for the night.&rdquo; He then leaned close to her ear, his\nlips practically pressed against it. &ldquo;I also think, it is time for a certain\nknight to pay said princess a visit.&rdquo; He whispered alluringly; his hot breath\nsent shivers up her spine. </p><p>Not\nbeing able to form words let alone a full sentence, Sumin simply nodded with a\ndreamy like smile written on her face. </p><p>Seokjin\ncould not help but find Sumin absolutely adorable. He did not think he would\ncause her to become this mindless, lovesick person but then again, she had that\neffect on him. She just did not know it yet. </p><p>Taking\nher hand gently into his as he stood up, Seokjin bowed his head and asked\npermission if he could escort her back to her chambers. Of course, Sumin gave\nhim permission but smacked him lightly on the shoulder for being rather\nembarrassing. </p><p>Seokjin\nplaced his free hand over his heart and feigned being insulted. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Well, I guess the princess can find\nher way back to her chambers by herself.&rdquo; He said firmly, untangling their\nfingers from one another. </p><p>Sumin\ncocked up her brow and gave him a look before shrugging and walking away. </p><p>Seokjin&rsquo;s\nmouth became agape as he watched the love of his life retreat. He quickly\nsnapped back into his senses and chased after the woman. </p><p>He\neasily caught up with her and grabbed her waist, causing the girl to laugh. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Who gave you permission to leave\nme?&rdquo; He asked; his tone tinted with slight darkness.</p><p>Sumin\nonly smirked in response before removing his hands from her body. Then, she\nwalked away from him, halting underneath the archway of the garden entrance.\nShe peered over her shoulder and with an alluring smile painted on her face,\nshe said,</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Why not follow me to my chambers,\nand I shall tell you the answer?&rdquo; </p><p>Seokjin\nfelt his hormones awaken. His lover knew how to rile him up to the point of him\nwanting to pin her against the wall and devour her lips as his hands traced\nevery curvature on her body&#8213;her naked body. </p><p>Not\neven a second later, he pursued after her, loving their little game they played\nwhenever they felt the need to spice up their romance. God, Seokjin could only\nimagine what actual sex with Sumin would be like. Maybe tonight was the night.\nThe night two hearts become one. </p><p>As\nSeokjin disappeared off into the night, trailing after the owner of his heart,\na certain king finally emerges from his hiding spot. His blood boiled after\nhaving to endure such a disgusting sight. </p><p>Ji Yong\nclenched his fists as his mind became plagued with the scene of Seokjin and\nSumin kissing one another. His lowly hands embracing the temple that was her\nbody. His sweet whispers that invaded her ears. Everything about this night\nsickened him. Ji Yong felt incredibly jealous and possessive over Sumin, and to\nwitness her loving someone pathetic knight pissed him off. </p><p>A loud\ngrowl emitted from his mouth as Ji Yong suddenly unsheathed his sword and swung\nviolently. His sword managed to cut a few branches from a nearby bush. </p><p>Ji Yong\neyed the fallen branch; his furious mind pretended that it was Seokjin&rsquo;s head.\nThen&#8213;as if something possessed him&mdash;Ji Yong calmly sheathed his sword, inhaled\nthen exhaled nice and slow, and stared off into the distance as the nightly\nsea-breeze fanned his face. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I am going to miss this kingdom&hellip;&rdquo;\nHe thought evilly to himself as his brain concocted the most devious plan that\nwould ensure Sumin&rsquo;s hand in marriage. Too bad that Seokjin would not be in\nattendance. Don&rsquo;t you love war? </p><p>Currently\nbrushing out the knots in her hair, Sumin hummed a little tune to herself as\nthe night breeze entered her room. The soft blow brushed past her curtains and\nflowed right by her, causing the hairs on her arm to stand up. </p><p>The\nsounds of a fire crackling filled her body with nothing but relaxation. She did\nnot understand why something so little as the sound of fire crackling put her\nmind at ease, but it did. That was until a light knock on her door interrupted\nit. Just that tiny knock caused butterflies to flutter in the pit of her belly.\n</p><p>She\nmuttered a quick enter before undoing the first bow of her nightgown. She\npulled it apart just a smidge, enough to show a bit of cleavage as her eyes\nstared at the door in anticipation. </p><p>Slowly,\na familiar face appeared in her sight. Then, his entire body came into full\nview. </p><p>Her\neyes widened and her mouth agape once she saw his appearance. Instead of his\nusual knightly attire, which consisted mainly of metal covering his entire\ntorso, he now wore a light cotton shirt, black pants, a belt that was lazily\ntied around his waist, and riding boots. His hair was even messy. </p><p>Something\nabout his unprofessional appearance aroused Sumin to the point that she\ncaptured his lips and untucked his shirt. </p><p>Seokjin\nsighed into the kiss as his arms wrapped around her waist. He then carried her\nbridal-style and walked over to the bed. </p><p>He\nbroke the kiss, for only a second; his eyes bore into hers. </p><p>The\nemotion in his eyes were purely lust and love. Nothing else mattered to him\nexcept one thing&mdash;giving her his virginity and taking hers in return. </p><p>Without\nsaying a word, he undid the belt and dropped it onto the floor, creating a loud\nclink. He pulled his shirt over his head, revealing his well-toned chest, and\ntossed it aside. </p><p>Sumin\ncontinued to eye him innocently, though, her core told a different story. Her\nclit ached&mdash;begged to be touched by him. She closed her thighs together, hoping\nthe tightness would distract her aching core, but it only made it worse. </p><p>His\nbrow raised just a smidge as Seokjin heard a few tiny moans come from his\nprincess. Her innocent eyes remained on his as he quickly kicked off his boots,\nnot wanting to keep his woman waiting any longer. He undid the buttons of his\npants, though, not taking them off. </p><p>A tiny\nwhine left her lips as Sumin hoped to see what lied underneath. She hadn&rsquo;t seen\nhis <i>friend</i> since the night of her\nparty. It had been too long. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Are you teasing me, my knight?&rdquo; She\nasked with an alluring smile.</p><p>Seokjin\nmerely smirked as he walked over to her fireplace and threw water on it; the\nsound of sizzles entered the room. </p><p>Nothing\nbut the moonlight illuminated her chambers as Sumin&rsquo;s breathing grew heavy from\nanticipation. Then, she felt a shift in her bed. </p><p>Before\nshe could say a word, her cheeks were cupped followed by an innocent kiss on\nher lips. </p><p>Seokjin\npulled away; his lips still hovered over hers. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I know waiting for our wedding\nnight is the proper action to take, but I simply cannot. I need you, Sumin.&rdquo; He\nlightly rubbed her lips with his, &ldquo;Please, tell me that you feel the same way.&rdquo;\nHe whispered softly as his heart pounded against his chest. </p><p>Sumin\nstared at him for a moment. Then, instead of speaking, she passionately kissed\nhim. She poured every ounce of love and want she had for the man. She too\nwanted him in every possible way. </p><p>She\nquickly undid the rest of the strings and slid the nightgown of her shoulders.\nShe pushed the sleeves down until her arms were free. </p><p>With\nher breasts in full view, something in Seokjin snapped. He devoured her lips\nagain as he gently pushed her onto the mattress. </p><p>A soft\nmoan escaped her lips as Seokjin&rsquo;s hands trailed up and down her thighs,\nigniting a tiny trail of fire with each passing. </p><p>Sumin\ndidn&rsquo;t know what possessed her, but she lifted up her leg and hooked it around his\nwaist. </p><p>Her\ncore pressed into his crotch, creating this friction that only left an intense\ndesire. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I need you, Seokjin&hellip;&rdquo; She begged\nsoftly as he directed his lips away from her lips and onto her neck. </p><p>Seokjin\nsmirked against her skin, pausing in his little assault. He lifted his head;\nhis lust filled gaze met hers. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Did I just hear the princess beg\nfor me?&rdquo; He teased as his fingers teased her entrance. </p><p>Sumin\nwhined, feeling his thumb graze over her clit, &ldquo;Y-yes&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>Seokjin\npushed one finger into her, loving how wet she had become just by his kisses\nalone. He added another one before slowly pumping his index and middle fingers\nin and out. </p><p>Sumin\ngasped in pleasure as she tilted her head and arched her back, giving Seokjin a\nfull view of her hardened nipples. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Damn&hellip;&rdquo; He mentally cursed as he\nlicked his lips.</p><p>Tiny\nmoans left one by one as Sumin felt something in the pit of her stomach. A feeling\nshe hadn&rsquo;t experienced since their one night alone in the abandoned room. </p><p>Feeling\nher walls constrict against his fingers, Seokjin quickened his pace as his lips\nattached to hers, swallowing her moans as they grown louder.</p><p>His\nfingers pumped in and out of her. His thumb vigorously rubbed her clit.</p><p>God,\nfeeling her like this made him want to pleasure himself&mdash;and so he did. Seokjin\nreached inside his pants and wrapped his free hand around his aching member. He\nmatched the pace of his fingers as the urge to release soon came over him. </p><p>He\npumped her and himself one last time before small strips of white landed on the\ninside of his pants. Her juices coated his fingers as both Seokjin and Sumin\nbreathed heavily.</p><p>Sumin\nsat up and showered his bare shoulder with tiny pecks as she watched him suck\nthe juices off his finger.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I shall never forget the taste of\nmy princess for as long as I live.&rdquo; Seokjin announced, smirking. </p><p>Sumin\nshook her head before kissing his plump lips slowly yet teasingly. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I wish I could have tasted you,\nSeokjin&hellip;&rdquo; She pouted cutely as her hands played with his pants, wanting nothing\nmore to take them off. She messed with the waistband as her fingers slowly\ndisappeared inside, but not reaching his cock quite yet. </p><p>A soft\nchuckle left his lips as he couldn&rsquo;t help but shake his head. His princess\nalways loved hinting rather than telling.</p><p>Finally\ntaking the hint, Seokjin pushed down his pants and kicked them off the bed. He\nthen removed the nightgown completely from her body. He bunched the light\nclothing material and tossed it over his shoulder. </p><p>Sumin\ncouldn&rsquo;t help but giggle at his childish act; however, it was short lived. Her\nbody was pinned underneath him; her wrists were positioned above her head. </p><p>Her\nbreasts pressed against his chest as his knee settled in between her thighs. </p><p>A\nblanket silence covered the room as the two lovers remained still, staring into\neach other&rsquo;s souls. This moment of intimacy had officially become intense.\nLying in silence as with their naked bodies in complete view was honestly\nspecial to them.</p><p>Sure,\nthey shared acts of intimacy as they had touched each other&rsquo;s bodies as lovers,\nbut right now? It was different. Neither one of them could explain it, but\ntheir hearts knew what this was. Their minds knew what this was. No words were\nneeded. </p><p>Slowly,\nSeokjin lowered himself down as he used his free hand to pump his member. </p><p>In a\nmatter of seconds, he was erect again. He then checked to see if Sumin was\nready to receive him, and she was. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;My deepest apologies, my princess,\nbut this might hurt you for a bit or at least feel uncomfortable. I will not\nact any further without your consent, okay?&rdquo; He said softly and sweetly as he\nteased her entrance with his tip. </p><p>Sumin\nsmiled warmly at him and nodded her head. Again, no words were needed. Not\nanymore. </p><p>Seokjin\nreleased his hold on her wrists as he cupped her chin, tilting her head up\nslightly. He kissed her lips sweetly; his tongue entered her mouth, as slowly\npushed himself inside her. </p><p>Sumin&rsquo;s\nface slowly contorted in discomfort. She felt her walls stretch the more he\nentered her. His size wasn&rsquo;t helping either. It wasn&rsquo;t like he was humongous,\nbut he wasn&rsquo;t tiny. </p><p>She\nbreathed heavily through her nostrils as Seokjin pulled out and then entered\nonce more. He repeated that action even though she didn&rsquo;t give him permission\nto do so. </p><p>Eventually,\nthe feeling of discomfort vanished. Then, only a ping of pleasure was left.\nThat tiny ping had been enough for Sumin to give him permission to move faster,\nwhich he did. </p><p>His\nthrusts sped up as both the warmth and wetness riled his sex drive to the point\nthat he just had to take her. His mind went into a frenzy as he thought of\nnothing else but to make Sumin moan and come undone again.</p><p>Her\nmoans increased in volume as the sounds bounced off the stone walls of her\nroom. In her state of mind, she didn&rsquo;t care if someone heard, especially that\nstupid King Ji Yong. Little did she know&hellip; she would regret that feeling since\nhe found himself wandering around near her room when he heard the sounds of\npassionate lovemaking. </p><p>Curiosity\ngot the best of him as he peeped through the keyhole and saw that lowly knight\nhaving sex with <i>his</i> future-wife.\nYup&hellip;seeing them like that solidified his plan. Now, it was time to execute it. </p><p>Ji Yong\nstepped away from the door just as he heard Seokjin manage to tell Sumin that\nhe loved her. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I l-love you too&hellip;Seokjin&hellip;&rdquo; Sumin\nmanaged to say through her endless moans and pants.</p><p>Seokjin\nsmiled as he lifted her leg and rested it on his wide shoulder. He then leaned\nforward, loving the new angle that they were in as he continued his thrusting. </p><p>It was\nthanks to this angle that Sumin began to see stars. His cock managed to hit her\ng-spot here and there, sending waves of pleasure throughout her body. She\ncraved more. She needed more. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Hit that s-spot again, my beloved.&rdquo;\nShe moaned out as she fisted the sheets.</p><p>Seokjin\nsimply nodded and did as he was told. He tried his hardest to hit that special\nspot repeatedly; however, if he couldn&rsquo;t, the he resorted in rubbing her clit.\nNow, that spot got her a moaning mess&mdash;and he loved every second of it. </p><p>Sounds\nof moaning and skin-on-skin contact continued to fill the room as it seemed\nlike hours had gone by since they first began. Honestly, they didn&rsquo;t care how\nlong it had been since their hearts were telling them that this might be the\nlast time they would be this intimate. At the same, they paid little to no\nattention to what their hearts were saying because lust had taken control. What\nmattered was that they were together now. </p><p>The\npleasure became too much as one more thrust would make Sumin see white, and\nSeokjin felt the same. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;R-ready to cum for me, princess?&rdquo;\nHe grunted as his thrusts slowly became sloppy. </p><p>Sumin\nonly nodded as her intellect disappeared hours ago. </p><p>With one last thrust, Seokjin released inside of her while\nSumin released all over him; their juices mixed with one another. His thrusts\nhad become incredibly sloppy as he emptied himself before collapsing on top of\nSumin. </p><p>Sumin panted heavily as she absentmindedly played with\nSeokjin&rsquo;s sweaty hair. </p><p>Seokjin sighed in content before mustering the remaining\nstrength he had left to pull out of her. The moment he did that, he instantly\nmissed her warmth. </p><p>He then lazily rolled over to the right side of the bed and\npulled her tainted sheets over them. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;It occurred\nto me that we need to explain to your nurse about your sheets.&rdquo; Seokjin mumbled\nas he draped his arm over Sumin&rsquo;s bare waist. </p><p>Sumin gave him look, though he couldn&rsquo;t see it. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;What do you\n&lsquo;we need to explain&rsquo;? I am more than likely going to explain it to her myself\nwhile you magically disappear.&rdquo; She stated as Seokjin leaned down to lightly\nbite her nose. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;How about\nthis&hellip;you explain to the nurse and I will ask your parents for an audience to\ndiscuss wedding plans.&rdquo; He suggested; his fingers lightly caressed her skin.</p><p>Sumin closed her eyes as they had grown to heavy too keep open\nand simply hummed in response. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I love you,\nmy one and only princess. The keeper of my heart. My everything.&rdquo; He whispered\nsweetly before drifting off towards dreamland, where his mind could finally\nrest and think about nothing else, but a married life with Sumin. </p><p>Except&hellip; there was something wrong with that plan&hellip;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Who said that it would be <i>his\n</i>married life with Sumin?</p><hr /><p><small><b>A/N: </b>Okay for the life of me, I could not figured out how to label the last smut warning. I mean, I settled for&nbsp;&ldquo;penetration&rdquo; because that&rsquo;s what Sumin &amp; Seokjin did. Let&rsquo;s be real here! LOL I&rsquo;ll change it, if you guys feel that it is not correct. Maybe I&rsquo;ll just change it to&nbsp;&ldquo;sex scene&rdquo; though&hellip; I think that&rsquo;s what&nbsp;&ldquo;SMUT&rdquo; entails. Agh&hellip; this is frustrating me. Anyway, I hope you guys like it! We are nearing the end of this series, and that means that the release of the sequel is fast approaching! Hope you guys are ready. I think by the time this is release, I should have the second chapter done! As of 7/12/2018, I had finished the first chapter! Go me!</small></p><p><small>Don&rsquo;t forget to leave a like/reblog/comment/send in an ask on your thoughts! I love hearing them! :)</small></p><p><small>- Kim</small></p></p>",

In that kingdom, the royal family had the freedom of marrying whoever his or her royal highness deems worthy. Now, of course, having that special privilege came with some interesting challenges, but that doesn&rsquo;t stop a certain head-strong princess from doing whatever her heart&rsquo;s desire, especially when she has her heart set on marrying her personal bodyguard. Unfortunately, her beliefs might face some hardships when a certain king sets his eye on her. Will her bodyguard continue to fight for her or is it finally her turn?</small></p>\n<p><small>&#8251; <b>Previously: </b><a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/175791445214/fight-for-me-ch1\">ch.1</a> | <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/175887448405/fight-for-me-ch2\">ch.2</a> | <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/175993838175/fight-for-me-ch3\">ch.3</a> | <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176061680692/fight-for-me-ch4\">ch.4</a><br /></small></p>\n<p><small>&#8251; <b>Next Time:</b> <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176200520359/fight-for-me-ch6\">ch.6</a>&nbsp;| <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176307635761/fight-for-me-final-chapter\">final chapter</a></small></p>\n<hr />\n<h2><i>Chapter 5: A Knight vs. A King</i></h2>\n</p>",
