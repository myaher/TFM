Groaning, he unsuccessfully tried to open his eyes. Bringing his hand up to his eye he wiped at them, blinking them open. The room slowly came into focus, the light bright and bouncing off the white walls. It took him several moments to realize he was in the hospital.</p><p><br/></p><p>Once he had fully come to his senses, he tensed up and started trying to get out of bed. Where was Phil? He had to find Phil, even if his weak body kept protesting. As he was attempting to get out of bed his door opened. A brunette women stuck her head in, <b><i>\u201cOh dear your up!\u201d</i> </b>she said brightly. Her smile faded when she saw he was trying to get out of bed. \u201cHey, you can\u2019t do that! Stop!\u201d She rushed over, sitting him back in the bed.</p><p><br/></p><p><i><b>\u201cWhere\u2019s Phil?\u201d </b></i>he asked trying to stay calm, his voice raspy.</p><p><b><i>\u201cPhil dear? I don\u2019t know who you&rsquo;re talking about.\u201d </i></b></p><p><b><i>\u201cMy boyfriend! Where is he? Is he alright?\u201d</i></b></p><p>She gave him a look.</p><p><b><i>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you stay here, dear, and I will go get the doctor.\u201d</i></b></p><p><br/></p><p>Nodding, already exhausted, he leaned back into the bed.</p><p><br/></p><p>It was several more minutes before an older looking man stepped into the room.</p><p><br/></p><p><b><i>\u201cHi, Dan. I can\u2019t say I\u2019m happy to see you again.\u201c</i></b> he held out his hand for Dan to shake.</p><p><i><b>\u201cWhat do you mean again? What is going on? Where is my boyfriend, Phil?\u201d</b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201cCalm down, I will answer all your questions,\u201d</b></i> he said to try and calm a panicking Dan.</p><p><br/></p><p><i><b>\u201cYou were here for several days a few weeks ago, don\u2019t you remember?\u201d</b></i></p><p>Dan shook his head.</p><p><br/></p><p><b><i>\u201cWell, you were\u2014I could even show you the medical records on it\u2014and you had some pretty severe injuries, so severe in fact that you had to have surgery on your leg, here. Luckily, you didn\u2019t damage it anymore this time &lsquo;round and we were able to transfer your foot into a boot.\u201d he motioned to the boot on Dan&rsquo;s foot. \u201cAs for your boyfriend, he was brought in and placed in another room, but now that you&rsquo;re awake would you like to be transferred to the same room?\u201d </i></b></p><p><br/></p><p>Dan violently nodded his head.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201c<b><i>Since his injuries turned out to be less severe than yours we will bring him up here.&ldquo;</i></b></p><p><b><i>\u201cThank you,\u201d</i></b> he whispered meekly, relief washing over him. Phil would be here and everything would be okay. \u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Several minutes later a nurse opened the door, wheeling Phil in a bed in front of her. Dan&rsquo;s heart stuttered in his chest.</p><p><br/></p><p><b><i>\u201cPhil, oh my god, are you alright?\u201d</i></b></p><p><b><i>\u201cI\u2019m fine, I\u2019m just glad to see you&rsquo;re awake and doing well.\u201d </i></b>He smiled at Dan.</p><p><br/></p><p>The nurse rolled the bed into place next to Dan&rsquo;s. <b><i>\u201cI\u2019ll be back in a little bit to check on you two, ok?\u201d</i></b> she smiled sweetly.</p><p><br/></p><p>They both nodded their head, not wanting to take their eyes off each other.</p><p><br/></p><p>~~~~~~~</p><p>The two were currently cuddled together in Dan\u2019s bed, just enjoying the comfort of the other&rsquo;s touch and being with each other.</p><p><br/></p><p><b><i>\u201cI can\u2019t believe it\u2019s finally over,\u201d</i></b> Phil whispered as he kissed his head.</p><p>Dan just snuggled closer, burying his head in the crook of his neck and placing a chaste kiss on the skin he found there.</p><p><br/></p><p>Still being extremely mentally and physically exhausted, eventually both of them fell asleep in each other\u2019s arms.</p><p><br/></p><p>Dan yawned as he woke up, smiling as he still felt Phil&rsquo;s very warm body next to him.</p><p><i><b>\u201cPhil?\u201d </b></i>he whispered.</p><p>Phil didn\u2019t respond.</p><p><i><b>\u201cPhil?\u201d</b></i> he said slightly louder, thinking how Phil must still be sleeping. But Phil didn&rsquo;t yawn and blink awake like he normally would.</p><p><br/></p><p>He frowned, <i><b>\u201cPhil!\u201d</b></i> he said shaking his shoulders.</p><p><br/></p><p>Still no answer. Dan started freaking out as the worst possible scenario easily jumped to the front of his mind.</p><p><i><b>\u201cHelp! Somebody help us!\u201d </b></i></p><p><br/></p><p>He was full on sobbing by the time the nurses came running into the room. They took one look at Phil and set to work putting him back in his bed and rolling him out of the room.</p><p><br/></p><p><i><b>\u201cWait, where are you taking him?\u201d</b></i> he cried, tears and snot running down his face. He had only just gotten Phil back, how could they take him away? \u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>He attempted to get out of bed to follow, but one of the nurses pushed him back. She tried consoling him, but he was too far gone with worry to respond. Before he even knew it the nurse slipped a needle into his arm and he fell back into a dreamless sleep.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>The next day was a whirlwind for Dan. He still hadn\u2019t seen Phil since they rushed him away, but they did tell him that the infection in Phil\u2019s hand and taken a turn for the worse, so they had him on a heavy dose of antibiotics. He had begged several times to be taken to see him, but they kept telling him that Phil\u2019s immune system wasn\u2019t stable and any virus or bacteria could potentially threaten his life, so they weren&rsquo;t letting anyone visit him.</p><p><br/></p><p>On the second day in the hospital alone without Phil, they told him that he was being forcefully committed to the psychiatric unit of the hospital. He had tried protesting, but they were very insistent that since Phil was unable to take care of him right now he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to go home by himself.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201c<i><b>Ok Dan, here you go, you will be rooming with Eric here.\u201d</b></i> The nurse motioned to the skinny looking brunette sitting on one of the beds in the room.</p><p><br/></p><p>The boy meekly waved at him.</p><p><b><i>\u201cEric here will show you around and get you situated, isn\u2019t that right Eric?\u201d</i></b></p><p>The boy shook his head.</p><p>Ok well, I will leave you boys to get acquainted. Dinner is in an hour!\u201d she smiled brightly as she left the room.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Dan set his bag down on the empty bed. He rubbed his neck and looked around his new <i><b>\u201chome\u201d. </b></i></p><p><br/></p><p><i><b>\u201cSo you&rsquo;re Dan, huh?\u201d</b></i> Eric grinned at him. He appeared visibly more energetic now that they were alone.</p><p><br/></p><p><i><b>\u201cYup that\u2019s me, I guess.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201cWell, I\u2019m Eric Whittaker and guess you will be sharing this hell hole with me for a while huh?\u201d</b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201cUmm yeah, I guess so.\u201d</b></i></p><p><br/></p><p><i><b>\u201cWell come on then I\u2019ll show you around this prison.\u201d </b></i>he chuckled.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>During the tour, Eric showed him the rec room where if they got enough points they were allowed to work out. He also showed him the cafeteria area and the <i><b>\u201ccommon room</b></i>\u201d, as the patients \u00a0called the space that they could hang out and relax in when they were not in therapy.</p><p><br/></p><p>Before dinner, they passed around meds which on top of his antidepressants, the doctors had him on some pain medicine for his leg and the dozens of healing wounds that were scattered all over his body.</p><p><br/></p><p>To say the food looked awful would be an understatement. He cringed at the slop on his tray that they said was lasagna. He wished he was home right now eating pizza and cuddling with Phil on the couch.</p><p><br/></p><p>He glanced around, looking for a place to sit when his eyes fell on Eric. Dan walked over and set his tray down.</p><p><i><b>\u201cIs it alright if I sit here?\u201d</b></i></p><p><br/></p><p>Eric didn\u2019t even look up from his tray.</p><p><i><b>\u201cYeah sure, whatever.\u201d</b></i></p><p>Dan noted that he wasn\u2019t the same energetic and talkative person he had met earlier. Dan hadn\u2019t had anything since breakfast, so he dug right into his gross looking dinner.</p><p><br/></p><p>Dan was so consumed with eating his food he almost didn\u2019t notice Eric not eating his. But he did, and he also noticed when Eric shoved most of his food into his napkin. He quickly hid the napkin in his pocket and got up to dispose of his tray.</p><p><br/></p><p><i><b>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</b></i> Dan hissed at him. Dan wasn\u2019t stupid\u2014he knew how places like this worked.</p><p><br/></p><p>He flinched at Dan\u2019s question.</p><p><b><i>\u201cNone of your fucking business.

Groaning, he unsuccessfully tried to open his eyes. Bringing his hand up to his eye he wiped at them, blinking them open. The room slowly came into focus, the light bright and bouncing off the white walls. It took him several moments to realize he was in the hospital.</p><p><br></p><p>Once he had fully come to his senses, he tensed up and started trying to get out of bed. Where was Phil? He had to find Phil, even if his weak body kept protesting. As he was attempting to get out of bed his door opened. A brunette women stuck her head in, <b><i>\u201cOh dear your up!\u201d</i> </b>she said brightly. Her smile faded when she saw he was trying to get out of bed. \u201cHey, you can\u2019t do that! Stop!\u201d She rushed over, sitting him back in the bed.</p><p><br></p><p><i><b>\u201cWhere\u2019s Phil?\u201d </b></i>he asked trying to stay calm, his voice raspy.</p><p><b><i>\u201cPhil dear? I don\u2019t know who you\u2019re talking about.\u201d </i></b></p><p><b><i>\u201cMy boyfriend! Where is he? Is he alright?\u201d</i></b></p><p>She gave him a look.</p><p><b><i>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you stay here, dear, and I will go get the doctor.\u201d</i></b></p><p><br></p><p>Nodding, already exhausted, he leaned back into the bed.</p><p><br></p><p>It was several more minutes before an older looking man stepped into the room.</p><p><br></p><p><b><i>\u201cHi, Dan. I can\u2019t say I\u2019m happy to see you again.\u201c</i></b> he held out his hand for Dan to shake.</p><p><i><b>\u201cWhat do you mean again? What is going on? Where is my boyfriend, Phil?\u201d</b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201cCalm down, I will answer all your questions,\u201d</b></i> he said to try and calm a panicking Dan.</p><p><br></p><p><i><b>\u201cYou were here for several days a few weeks ago, don\u2019t you remember?\u201d</b></i></p><p>Dan shook his head.</p><p><br></p><p><b><i>\u201cWell, you were\u2014I could even show you the medical records on it\u2014and you had some pretty severe injuries, so severe in fact that you had to have surgery on your leg, here. Luckily, you didn\u2019t damage it anymore this time \u2018round and we were able to transfer your foot into a boot.\u201d he motioned to the boot on Dan\u2019s foot. \u201cAs for your boyfriend, he was brought in and placed in another room, but now that you\u2019re awake would you like to be transferred to the same room?\u201d </i></b></p><p><br></p><p>Dan violently nodded his head.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201c<b><i>Since his injuries turned out to be less severe than yours we will bring him up here.\u201c</i></b></p><p><b><i>\u201cThank you,\u201d</i></b> he whispered meekly, relief washing over him. Phil would be here and everything would be okay. \u00a0</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Several minutes later a nurse opened the door, wheeling Phil in a bed in front of her. Dan\u2019s heart stuttered in his chest.</p><p><br></p><p><b><i>\u201cPhil, oh my god, are you alright?\u201d</i></b></p><p><b><i>\u201cI\u2019m fine, I\u2019m just glad to see you\u2019re awake and doing well.\u201d </i></b>He smiled at Dan.</p><p><br></p><p>The nurse rolled the bed into place next to Dan\u2019s. <b><i>\u201cI\u2019ll be back in a little bit to check on you two, ok?\u201d</i></b> she smiled sweetly.</p><p><br></p><p>They both nodded their head, not wanting to take their eyes off each other.</p><p><br></p><p>~~~~~~~</p><p>The two were currently cuddled together in Dan\u2019s bed, just enjoying the comfort of the other\u2019s touch and being with each other.</p><p><br></p><p><b><i>\u201cI can\u2019t believe it\u2019s finally over,\u201d</i></b> Phil whispered as he kissed his head.</p><p>Dan just snuggled closer, burying his head in the crook of his neck and placing a chaste kiss on the skin he found there.</p><p><br></p><p>Still being extremely mentally and physically exhausted, eventually both of them fell asleep in each other\u2019s arms.</p><p><br></p><p>Dan yawned as he woke up, smiling as he still felt Phil\u2019s very warm body next to him.</p><p><i><b>\u201cPhil?\u201d </b></i>he whispered.</p><p>Phil didn\u2019t respond.</p><p><i><b>\u201cPhil?\u201d</b></i> he said slightly louder, thinking how Phil must still be sleeping. But Phil didn\u2019t yawn and blink awake like he normally would.</p><p><br></p><p>He frowned, <i><b>\u201cPhil!\u201d</b></i> he said shaking his shoulders.</p><p><br></p><p>Still no answer. Dan started freaking out as the worst possible scenario easily jumped to the front of his mind.</p><p><i><b>\u201cHelp! Somebody help us!\u201d </b></i></p><p><br></p><p>He was full on sobbing by the time the nurses came running into the room. They took one look at Phil and set to work putting him back in his bed and rolling him out of the room.</p><p><br></p><p><i><b>\u201cWait, where are you taking him?\u201d</b></i> he cried, tears and snot running down his face. He had only just gotten Phil back, how could they take him away? \u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>He attempted to get out of bed to follow, but one of the nurses pushed him back. She tried consoling him, but he was too far gone with worry to respond. Before he even knew it the nurse slipped a needle into his arm and he fell back into a dreamless sleep.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>The next day was a whirlwind for Dan. He still hadn\u2019t seen Phil since they rushed him away, but they did tell him that the infection in Phil\u2019s hand and taken a turn for the worse, so they had him on a heavy dose of antibiotics. He had begged several times to be taken to see him, but they kept telling him that Phil\u2019s immune system wasn\u2019t stable and any virus or bacteria could potentially threaten his life, so they weren\u2019t letting anyone visit him.</p><p><br></p><p>On the second day in the hospital alone without Phil, they told him that he was being forcefully committed to the psychiatric unit of the hospital. He had tried protesting, but they were very insistent that since Phil was unable to take care of him right now he wouldn\u2019t be able to go home by himself.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201c<i><b>Ok Dan, here you go, you will be rooming with Eric here.\u201d</b></i> The nurse motioned to the skinny looking brunette sitting on one of the beds in the room.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy meekly waved at him.</p><p><b><i>\u201cEric here will show you around and get you situated, isn\u2019t that right Eric?\u201d</i></b></p><p>The boy shook his head.</p><p>Ok well, I will leave you boys to get acquainted. Dinner is in an hour!\u201d she smiled brightly as she left the room.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Dan set his bag down on the empty bed. He rubbed his neck and looked around his new <i><b>\u201chome\u201d. </b></i></p><p><br></p><p><i><b>\u201cSo you\u2019re Dan, huh?\u201d</b></i> Eric grinned at him. He appeared visibly more energetic now that they were alone.</p><p><br></p><p><i><b>\u201cYup that\u2019s me, I guess.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201cWell, I\u2019m Eric Whittaker and guess you will be sharing this hell hole with me for a while huh?\u201d</b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201cUmm yeah, I guess so.\u201d</b></i></p><p><br></p><p><i><b>\u201cWell come on then I\u2019ll show you around this prison.\u201d </b></i>he chuckled.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>During the tour, Eric showed him the rec room where if they got enough points they were allowed to work out. He also showed him the cafeteria area and the <i><b>\u201ccommon room</b></i>\u201d, as the patients \u00a0called the space that they could hang out and relax in when they were not in therapy.</p><p><br></p><p>Before dinner, they passed around meds which on top of his antidepressants, the doctors had him on some pain medicine for his leg and the dozens of healing wounds that were scattered all over his body.</p><p><br></p><p>To say the food looked awful would be an understatement. He cringed at the slop on his tray that they said was lasagna. He wished he was home right now eating pizza and cuddling with Phil on the couch.</p><p><br></p><p>He glanced around, looking for a place to sit when his eyes fell on Eric. Dan walked over and set his tray down.</p><p><i><b>\u201cIs it alright if I sit here?\u201d</b></i></p><p><br></p><p>Eric didn\u2019t even look up from his tray.</p><p><i><b>\u201cYeah sure, whatever.\u201d</b></i></p><p>Dan noted that he wasn\u2019t the same energetic and talkative person he had met earlier. Dan hadn\u2019t had anything since breakfast, so he dug right into his gross looking dinner.</p><p><br></p><p>Dan was so consumed with eating his food he almost didn\u2019t notice Eric not eating his. But he did, and he also noticed when Eric shoved most of his food into his napkin. He quickly hid the napkin in his pocket and got up to dispose of his tray.</p><p><br></p><p><i><b>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</b></i> Dan hissed at him. Dan wasn\u2019t stupid\u2014he knew how places like this worked.</p><p><br></p><p>He flinched at Dan\u2019s question.</p><p><b><i>\u201cNone of your fucking business. Now, if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019m going to leave.\u201d</i></b> he hissed back at him.</p><p><br></p><p>Startled, Dan didn\u2019t say anything as Eric swiftly walked off, showing his tray to the nurse to prove he had \u201ceaten\u201d his meal and made his way off towards the rooms.</p><p><br></p><p>Dan sat alone, eating his meal, but suddenly he wasn\u2019t hungry anymore. He sighed and threw his fork down and emptied his tray. He didn\u2019t have to show the nurse his since he wasn\u2019t in for an eating disorder.</p><p>He made his way to the common room, not wanting to go back to his room and have to deal with Eric yet. The common room was empty aside from a nurse and a small petite blonde who was sitting in the corner, reading a book. He walked to the other side of the room, making sure to avoid eye contact with the girl. He sat down, picking up his own book in the process.</p><p><br></p><p>He really couldn\u2019t concentrate. All he could think about was Phil and if he was ok.

He didn\u2019t really want to engage in any conversations right now. He was overwhelmed as is.</p><p><br></p><p><i><b>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you at dinner?\u201d </b></i>she asked quizzically.</p><p>Sighing he closed the book; apparently, he wasn\u2019t getting out of talking to this girl.</p><p>\u201c<i><b>I wasn\u2019t hungry.\u201d </b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201cOh you better be careful of that, they are pretty strict around here with eating all your meals.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201cI\u2019m not in here for that,\u201d</b></i> he said, maybe a bit too harshly.</p><p>But the girl didn\u2019t flinch.<b><i> \u201cOh ok then.

Groaning, he unsuccessfully tried to open his eyes. Bringing his hand up to his eye he wiped at them, blinking them open. The room slowly came into focus, the light bright and bouncing off the white walls. It took him several moments to realize he was in the hospital.</p><p><br></p><p>Once he had fully come to his senses, he tensed up and started trying to get out of bed. Where was Phil? He had to find Phil, even if his weak body kept protesting. As he was attempting to get out of bed his door opened. A brunette women stuck her head in, <b><i>\u201cOh dear your up!\u201d</i> </b>she said brightly. Her smile faded when she saw he was trying to get out of bed. \u201cHey, you can\u2019t do that! Stop!\u201d She rushed over, sitting him back in the bed.</p><p><br></p><p><i><b>\u201cWhere\u2019s Phil?\u201d </b></i>he asked trying to stay calm, his voice raspy.</p><p><b><i>\u201cPhil dear? I don\u2019t know who you\u2019re talking about.\u201d </i></b></p><p><b><i>\u201cMy boyfriend! Where is he? Is he alright?\u201d</i></b></p><p>She gave him a look.</p><p><b><i>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you stay here, dear, and I will go get the doctor.\u201d</i></b></p><p><br></p><p>Nodding, already exhausted, he leaned back into the bed.</p><p><br></p><p>It was several more minutes before an older looking man stepped into the room.</p><p><br></p><p><b><i>\u201cHi, Dan. I can\u2019t say I\u2019m happy to see you again.\u201c</i></b> he held out his hand for Dan to shake.</p><p><i><b>\u201cWhat do you mean again? What is going on? Where is my boyfriend, Phil?\u201d</b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201cCalm down, I will answer all your questions,\u201d</b></i> he said to try and calm a panicking Dan.</p><p><br></p><p><i><b>\u201cYou were here for several days a few weeks ago, don\u2019t you remember?\u201d</b></i></p><p>Dan shook his head.</p><p><br></p><p><b><i>\u201cWell, you were\u2014I could even show you the medical records on it\u2014and you had some pretty severe injuries, so severe in fact that you had to have surgery on your leg, here. Luckily, you didn\u2019t damage it anymore this time \u2018round and we were able to transfer your foot into a boot.\u201d he motioned to the boot on Dan\u2019s foot. \u201cAs for your boyfriend, he was brought in and placed in another room, but now that you\u2019re awake would you like to be transferred to the same room?\u201d </i></b></p><p><br></p><p>Dan violently nodded his head.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201c<b><i>Since his injuries turned out to be less severe than yours we will bring him up here.\u201c</i></b></p><p><b><i>\u201cThank you,\u201d</i></b> he whispered meekly, relief washing over him. Phil would be here and everything would be okay. \u00a0</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Several minutes later a nurse opened the door, wheeling Phil in a bed in front of her. Dan\u2019s heart stuttered in his chest.</p><p><br></p><p><b><i>\u201cPhil, oh my god, are you alright?\u201d</i></b></p><p><b><i>\u201cI\u2019m fine, I\u2019m just glad to see you\u2019re awake and doing well.\u201d </i></b>He smiled at Dan.</p><p><br></p><p>The nurse rolled the bed into place next to Dan\u2019s. <b><i>\u201cI\u2019ll be back in a little bit to check on you two, ok?\u201d</i></b> she smiled sweetly.</p><p><br></p><p>They both nodded their head, not wanting to take their eyes off each other.</p><p><br></p><p>~~~~~~~</p><p>The two were currently cuddled together in Dan\u2019s bed, just enjoying the comfort of the other\u2019s touch and being with each other.</p><p><br></p><p><b><i>\u201cI can\u2019t believe it\u2019s finally over,\u201d</i></b> Phil whispered as he kissed his head.</p><p>Dan just snuggled closer, burying his head in the crook of his neck and placing a chaste kiss on the skin he found there.</p><p><br></p><p>Still being extremely mentally and physically exhausted, eventually both of them fell asleep in each other\u2019s arms.</p><p><br></p><p>Dan yawned as he woke up, smiling as he still felt Phil\u2019s very warm body next to him.</p><p><i><b>\u201cPhil?\u201d </b></i>he whispered.</p><p>Phil didn\u2019t respond.</p><p><i><b>\u201cPhil?\u201d</b></i> he said slightly louder, thinking how Phil must still be sleeping. But Phil didn\u2019t yawn and blink awake like he normally would.</p><p><br></p><p>He frowned, <i><b>\u201cPhil!\u201d</b></i> he said shaking his shoulders.</p><p><br></p><p>Still no answer. Dan started freaking out as the worst possible scenario easily jumped to the front of his mind.</p><p><i><b>\u201cHelp! Somebody help us!\u201d </b></i></p><p><br></p><p>He was full on sobbing by the time the nurses came running into the room. They took one look at Phil and set to work putting him back in his bed and rolling him out of the room.</p><p><br></p><p><i><b>\u201cWait, where are you taking him?\u201d</b></i> he cried, tears and snot running down his face. He had only just gotten Phil back, how could they take him away? \u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>He attempted to get out of bed to follow, but one of the nurses pushed him back. She tried consoling him, but he was too far gone with worry to respond. Before he even knew it the nurse slipped a needle into his arm and he fell back into a dreamless sleep.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>The next day was a whirlwind for Dan. He still hadn\u2019t seen Phil since they rushed him away, but they did tell him that the infection in Phil\u2019s hand and taken a turn for the worse, so they had him on a heavy dose of antibiotics. He had begged several times to be taken to see him, but they kept telling him that Phil\u2019s immune system wasn\u2019t stable and any virus or bacteria could potentially threaten his life, so they weren\u2019t letting anyone visit him.</p><p><br></p><p>On the second day in the hospital alone without Phil, they told him that he was being forcefully committed to the psychiatric unit of the hospital. He had tried protesting, but they were very insistent that since Phil was unable to take care of him right now he wouldn\u2019t be able to go home by himself.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201c<i><b>Ok Dan, here you go, you will be rooming with Eric here.\u201d</b></i> The nurse motioned to the skinny looking brunette sitting on one of the beds in the room.</p><p><br></p><p>The boy meekly waved at him.</p><p><b><i>\u201cEric here will show you around and get you situated, isn\u2019t that right Eric?\u201d</i></b></p><p>The boy shook his head.</p><p>Ok well, I will leave you boys to get acquainted. Dinner is in an hour!\u201d she smiled brightly as she left the room.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Dan set his bag down on the empty bed. He rubbed his neck and looked around his new <i><b>\u201chome\u201d. </b></i></p><p><br></p><p><i><b>\u201cSo you\u2019re Dan, huh?\u201d</b></i> Eric grinned at him. He appeared visibly more energetic now that they were alone.</p><p><br></p><p><i><b>\u201cYup that\u2019s me, I guess.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201cWell, I\u2019m Eric Whittaker and guess you will be sharing this hell hole with me for a while huh?\u201d</b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201cUmm yeah, I guess so.\u201d</b></i></p><p><br></p><p><i><b>\u201cWell come on then I\u2019ll show you around this prison.\u201d </b></i>he chuckled.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>During the tour, Eric showed him the rec room where if they got enough points they were allowed to work out. He also showed him the cafeteria area and the <i><b>\u201ccommon room</b></i>\u201d, as the patients \u00a0called the space that they could hang out and relax in when they were not in therapy.</p><p><br></p><p>Before dinner, they passed around meds which on top of his antidepressants, the doctors had him on some pain medicine for his leg and the dozens of healing wounds that were scattered all over his body.</p><p><br></p><p>To say the food looked awful would be an understatement. He cringed at the slop on his tray that they said was lasagna. He wished he was home right now eating pizza and cuddling with Phil on the couch.</p><p><br></p><p>He glanced around, looking for a place to sit when his eyes fell on Eric. Dan walked over and set his tray down.</p><p><i><b>\u201cIs it alright if I sit here?\u201d</b></i></p><p><br></p><p>Eric didn\u2019t even look up from his tray.</p><p><i><b>\u201cYeah sure, whatever.\u201d</b></i></p><p>Dan noted that he wasn\u2019t the same energetic and talkative person he had met earlier. Dan hadn\u2019t had anything since breakfast, so he dug right into his gross looking dinner.</p><p><br></p><p>Dan was so consumed with eating his food he almost didn\u2019t notice Eric not eating his. But he did, and he also noticed when Eric shoved most of his food into his napkin. He quickly hid the napkin in his pocket and got up to dispose of his tray.</p><p><br></p><p><i><b>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</b></i> Dan hissed at him. Dan wasn\u2019t stupid\u2014he knew how places like this worked.</p><p><br></p><p>He flinched at Dan\u2019s question.</p><p><b><i>\u201cNone of your fucking business. Now, if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019m going to leave.\u201d</i></b> he hissed back at him.</p><p><br></p><p>Startled, Dan didn\u2019t say anything as Eric swiftly walked off, showing his tray to the nurse to prove he had \u201ceaten\u201d his meal and made his way off towards the rooms.</p><p><br></p><p>Dan sat alone, eating his meal, but suddenly he wasn\u2019t hungry anymore. He sighed and threw his fork down and emptied his tray. He didn\u2019t have to show the nurse his since he wasn\u2019t in for an eating disorder.</p><p>He made his way to the common room, not wanting to go back to his room and have to deal with Eric yet. The common room was empty aside from a nurse and a small petite blonde who was sitting in the corner, reading a book. He walked to the other side of the room, making sure to avoid eye contact with the girl. He sat down, picking up his own book in the process.</p><p><br></p><p>He really couldn\u2019t concentrate. All he could think about was Phil and if he was ok. The doctors had told him before they made him come down here that Phil was doing better, but was not yet awake.</p><p><br></p><p>He adjusted himself on the couch, wincing slightly at the pain that shot threw his abdomen. He turned his attention back to the book, hoping to get his mind off things.</p><p><br></p><p>It wasn\u2019t long before he felt the couch dip next to him.</p><p><i><b>\u201cThat\u2019s a good one.\u201d </b></i></p><p>He jumped at the unexpected voice.</p><p><i><b>\u201cWhat?\u201d </b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201cThat book, it\u2019s a good one.\u201d</b></i> The blonde he had noticed earlier motioned to the book in his hands.</p><p><i><b>\u201cUhh yeah, it\u2019s ok I guess,\u201d</b></i> he said, turning his back slightly and returning to the book in hopes she would leave him alone. He didn\u2019t really want to engage in any conversations right now. He was overwhelmed as is.</p><p><br></p><p><i><b>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you at dinner?\u201d </b></i>she asked quizzically.</p><p>Sighing he closed the book; apparently, he wasn\u2019t getting out of talking to this girl.</p><p>\u201c<i><b>I wasn\u2019t hungry.\u201d </b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201cOh you better be careful of that, they are pretty strict around here with eating all your meals.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201cI\u2019m not in here for that,\u201d</b></i> he said, maybe a bit too harshly.</p><p>But the girl didn\u2019t flinch.<b><i> \u201cOh ok then. I\u2019m Kate by the way.\u201d</i></b> She smiled at him.</p><p>He had to give this girl credit\u2014she didn\u2019t give up even when he was giving her all the signs he wanted to be left alone.</p><p><br></p><p><i><b>\u201cI\u2019m Dan.\u201d </b></i>he sighed.</p><p><b><i>\u201cWell, hi Dan, it\u2019s nice to meet you!\u201d</i></b> she said excitedly.</p><p><br></p><p>The talked for a little while longer and the more they talked the more Dan found that he liked her. He found out that they had similar tastes in music and video games.</p><p><br></p><p>The room started filling with people who had finished their dinner, so Dan bid Kate goodbye before heading back to his room. He didn\u2019t feel like being with Eric right now, but he wanted even less to be in a room full of bloody people.</p><p><br></p><p>He hobbled (the boot making it difficult to walk normally) into his room, hoping maybe Eric wasn\u2019t there, but he was immediately disappointed when he saw him sitting on his bed. Admitting defeat, he walked in and sat down on his own bed. The room was silent for a few minutes before Eric cleared his throat.</p><p><b><i>\u201cListen, man, I\u2019m sorry about earlier. I didn\u2019t mean to be short with you, it\u2019s just this place you know. Has my nerves on edge.\u201d</i></b> he rambled, clearly not sure what to say but apologetic nonetheless. \u00a0</p><p><br></p><p><i><b>\u201cListen it\u2019s fine, you\u2019re right it, wasn\u2019t any of my business.\u201d</b></i></p><p>Eric looked clearly relieved.<i><b> \u201cOh great. So, friends again?\u201d </b></i>He smiled hopefully at him.</p><p><i><b>\u201cSure, friends.\u201d</b></i> Dan replied. He laid down on his bed and turned away from Eric, hoping for sleep to take him.</p><p><br></p><p>~~~~~~~~~</p><p><br></p><p>When Phil opened his eyes, he noticed he was alone. He frowned. He could have sworn he had fallen asleep in Dan\u2019s bed last night. He looked around and found the call button to get the attention of the nurse. When he reached for it with his hand, that was when he noticed it was wrapped up, and a sudden pain shot all the way up his arm when he tried to move it. Using his non-injured hand, he pressed the button and called the nurse.</p><p><br></p><p>It didn\u2019t take long before one popped her head into his room. \u201c<i><b>Is there something I can get you, hun?\u201d </b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201cUmm, yeah can you tell me where my boyfriend is?\u201d</b></i> Phil asked, his voice sounding raspy to his own ears.</p><p><i><b>\u201cOh, you don\u2019t know? He was transferred to the physic ward two days ago.\u201d</b></i></p><p><br></p><p>Wait what, he was just with Dan last night.</p><p><br></p><p>The doctor had to come in and explain that the infection in his hand had gotten worse, and he had been out of it for the last two days. He was upset that they had committed Dan to the psychiatric ward. He had known Dan for almost ten years, and if he knew one thing about him, it was that he wouldn\u2019t be happy being in a psychiatric ward. So is first priority was to get well enough to get to see Dan and get them both out of here and back home where they belonged.</p>",

Luckily, you didn&rsquo;t damage it anymore this time &lsquo;round and we were able to transfer your foot into a boot.&rdquo; he motioned to the boot on Dan&rsquo;s foot. &ldquo;As for your boyfriend, he was brought in and placed in another room, but now that you&rsquo;re awake would you like to be transferred to the same room?&rdquo; </i></b></p><p><br /></p><p>Dan violently nodded his head.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;<b><i>Since his injuries turned out to be less severe than yours we will bring him up here.&ldquo;</i></b></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo;</i></b> he whispered meekly, relief washing over him. Phil would be here and everything would be okay. &nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Several minutes later a nurse opened the door, wheeling Phil in a bed in front of her. Dan&rsquo;s heart stuttered in his chest.</p><p><br /></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Phil, oh my god, are you alright?&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, I&rsquo;m just glad to see you&rsquo;re awake and doing well.&rdquo; </i></b>He smiled at Dan.</p><p><br /></p><p>The nurse rolled the bed into place next to Dan&rsquo;s. <b><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back in a little bit to check on you two, ok?&rdquo;</i></b> she smiled sweetly.</p><p><br /></p><p>They both nodded their head, not wanting to take their eyes off each other.</p><p><br /></p><p>~~~~~~~</p><p>The two were currently cuddled together in Dan&rsquo;s bed, just enjoying the comfort of the other&rsquo;s touch and being with each other.</p><p><br /></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s finally over,&rdquo;</i></b> Phil whispered as he kissed his head.</p><p>Dan just snuggled closer, burying his head in the crook of his neck and placing a chaste kiss on the skin he found there.</p><p><br /></p><p>Still being extremely mentally and physically exhausted, eventually both of them fell asleep in each other&rsquo;s arms.</p><p><br /></p><p>Dan yawned as he woke up, smiling as he still felt Phil&rsquo;s very warm body next to him.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Phil?&rdquo; </b></i>he whispered.</p><p>Phil didn&rsquo;t respond.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Phil?&rdquo;</b></i> he said slightly louder, thinking how Phil must still be sleeping. But Phil didn&rsquo;t yawn and blink awake like he normally would.</p><p><br /></p><p>He frowned, <i><b>&ldquo;Phil!&rdquo;</b></i> he said shaking his shoulders.</p><p><br /></p><p>Still no answer. Dan started freaking out as the worst possible scenario easily jumped to the front of his mind.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Help! Somebody help us!&rdquo; </b></i></p><p><br /></p><p>He was full on sobbing by the time the nurses came running into the room. They took one look at Phil and set to work putting him back in his bed and rolling him out of the room.</p><p><br /></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Wait, where are you taking him?&rdquo;</b></i> he cried, tears and snot running down his face. He had only just gotten Phil back, how could they take him away? &nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>He attempted to get out of bed to follow, but one of the nurses pushed him back. She tried consoling him, but he was too far gone with worry to respond. Before he even knew it the nurse slipped a needle into his arm and he fell back into a dreamless sleep.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>The next day was a whirlwind for Dan. He still hadn&rsquo;t seen Phil since they rushed him away, but they did tell him that the infection in Phil&rsquo;s hand and taken a turn for the worse, so they had him on a heavy dose of antibiotics. He had begged several times to be taken to see him, but they kept telling him that Phil&rsquo;s immune system wasn&rsquo;t stable and any virus or bacteria could potentially threaten his life, so they weren&rsquo;t letting anyone visit him.</p><p><br /></p><p>On the second day in the hospital alone without Phil, they told him that he was being forcefully committed to the psychiatric unit of the hospital. He had tried protesting, but they were very insistent that since Phil was unable to take care of him right now he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to go home by himself.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i><b>Ok Dan, here you go, you will be rooming with Eric here.&rdquo;</b></i> The nurse motioned to the skinny looking brunette sitting on one of the beds in the room.</p><p><br /></p><p>The boy meekly waved at him.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Eric here will show you around and get you situated, isn&rsquo;t that right Eric?&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>The boy shook his head.</p><p>Ok well, I will leave you boys to get acquainted. Dinner is in an hour!&rdquo; she smiled brightly as she left the room.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Dan set his bag down on the empty bed. He rubbed his neck and looked around his new <i><b>&ldquo;home&rdquo;. </b></i></p><p><br /></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re Dan, huh?&rdquo;</b></i> Eric grinned at him. He appeared visibly more energetic now that they were alone.</p><p><br /></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Yup that&rsquo;s me, I guess.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m Eric Whittaker and guess you will be sharing this hell hole with me for a while huh?&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Umm yeah, I guess so.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><br /></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Well come on then I&rsquo;ll show you around this prison.&rdquo; </b></i>he chuckled.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>During the tour, Eric showed him the rec room where if they got enough points they were allowed to work out. He also showed him the cafeteria area and the <i><b>&ldquo;common room</b></i>&rdquo;, as the patients &nbsp;called the space that they could hang out and relax in when they were not in therapy.</p><p><br /></p><p>Before dinner, they passed around meds which on top of his antidepressants, the doctors had him on some pain medicine for his leg and the dozens of healing wounds that were scattered all over his body.</p><p><br /></p><p>To say the food looked awful would be an understatement. He cringed at the slop on his tray that they said was lasagna. He wished he was home right now eating pizza and cuddling with Phil on the couch.</p><p><br /></p><p>He glanced around, looking for a place to sit when his eyes fell on Eric. Dan walked over and set his tray down.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Is it alright if I sit here?&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><br /></p><p>Eric didn&rsquo;t even look up from his tray.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Yeah sure, whatever.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>Dan noted that he wasn&rsquo;t the same energetic and talkative person he had met earlier. Dan hadn&rsquo;t had anything since breakfast, so he dug right into his gross looking dinner.</p><p><br /></p><p>Dan was so consumed with eating his food he almost didn&rsquo;t notice Eric not eating his. But he did, and he also noticed when Eric shoved most of his food into his napkin. He quickly hid the napkin in his pocket and got up to dispose of his tray.</p><p><br /></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo;</b></i> Dan hissed at him. Dan wasn&rsquo;t stupid&mdash;he knew how places like this worked.</p><p><br /></p><p>He flinched at Dan&rsquo;s question.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;None of your fucking business. Now, if you don&rsquo;t mind, I&rsquo;m going to leave.&rdquo;</i></b> he hissed back at him.</p><p><br /></p><p>Startled, Dan didn&rsquo;t say anything as Eric swiftly walked off, showing his tray to the nurse to prove he had &ldquo;eaten&rdquo; his meal and made his way off towards the rooms.</p><p><br /></p><p>Dan sat alone, eating his meal, but suddenly he wasn&rsquo;t hungry anymore. He sighed and threw his fork down and emptied his tray. He didn&rsquo;t have to show the nurse his since he wasn&rsquo;t in for an eating disorder.</p><p>He made his way to the common room, not wanting to go back to his room and have to deal with Eric yet. The common room was empty aside from a nurse and a small petite blonde who was sitting in the corner, reading a book. He walked to the other side of the room, making sure to avoid eye contact with the girl. He sat down, picking up his own book in the process.</p><p><br /></p><p>He really couldn&rsquo;t concentrate. All he could think about was Phil and if he was ok. The doctors had told him before they made him come down here that Phil was doing better, but was not yet awake.</p><p><br /></p><p>He adjusted himself on the couch, wincing slightly at the pain that shot threw his abdomen. He turned his attention back to the book, hoping to get his mind off things.</p><p><br /></p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t long before he felt the couch dip next to him.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good one.&rdquo; </b></i></p><p>He jumped at the unexpected voice.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; </b></i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;That book, it&rsquo;s a good one.&rdquo;</b></i> The blonde he had noticed earlier motioned to the book in his hands.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Uhh yeah, it&rsquo;s ok I guess,&rdquo;</b></i> he said, turning his back slightly and returning to the book in hopes she would leave him alone. He didn&rsquo;t really want to engage in any conversations right now. He was overwhelmed as is.</p><p><br /></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t you at dinner?&rdquo; </b></i>she asked quizzically.</p><p>Sighing he closed the book; apparently, he wasn&rsquo;t getting out of talking to this girl.</p><p>&ldquo;<i><b>I wasn&rsquo;t hungry.&rdquo; </b></i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Oh you better be careful of that, they are pretty strict around here with eating all your meals.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not in here for that,&rdquo;</b></i> he said, maybe a bit too harshly.</p><p>But the girl didn&rsquo;t flinch.<b><i> &ldquo;Oh ok then. I&rsquo;m Kate by the way.&rdquo;</i></b> She smiled at him.</p><p>He had to give this girl credit&mdash;she didn&rsquo;t give up even when he was giving her all the signs he wanted to be left alone.</p><p><br /></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Dan.&rdquo; </b></i>he sighed.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Well, hi Dan, it&rsquo;s nice to meet you!&rdquo;</i></b> she said excitedly.</p><p><br /></p><p>The talked for a little while longer and the more they talked the more Dan found that he liked her. He found out that they had similar tastes in music and video games.</p><p><br /></p><p>The room started filling with people who had finished their dinner, so Dan bid Kate goodbye before heading back to his room. He didn&rsquo;t feel like being with Eric right now, but he wanted even less to be in a room full of bloody people.</p><p><br /></p><p>He hobbled (the boot making it difficult to walk normally) into his room, hoping maybe Eric wasn&rsquo;t there, but he was immediately disappointed when he saw him sitting on his bed. Admitting defeat, he walked in and sat down on his own bed. The room was silent for a few minutes before Eric cleared his throat.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Listen, man, I&rsquo;m sorry about earlier. I didn&rsquo;t mean to be short with you, it&rsquo;s just this place you know. Has my nerves on edge.&rdquo;</i></b> he rambled, clearly not sure what to say but apologetic nonetheless. &nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Listen it&rsquo;s fine, you&rsquo;re right it, wasn&rsquo;t any of my business.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>Eric looked clearly relieved.<i><b> &ldquo;Oh great. So, friends again?&rdquo; </b></i>He smiled hopefully at him.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Sure, friends.&rdquo;</b></i> Dan replied. He laid down on his bed and turned away from Eric, hoping for sleep to take him.</p><p><br /></p><p>~~~~~~~~~</p><p><br /></p><p>When Phil opened his eyes, he noticed he was alone. He frowned. He could have sworn he had fallen asleep in Dan&rsquo;s bed last night. He looked around and found the call button to get the attention of the nurse. When he reached for it with his hand, that was when he noticed it was wrapped up, and a sudden pain shot all the way up his arm when he tried to move it. Using his non-injured hand, he pressed the button and called the nurse.</p><p><br /></p><p>It didn&rsquo;t take long before one popped her head into his room. &ldquo;<i><b>Is there something I can get you, hun?&rdquo; </b></i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Umm, yeah can you tell me where my boyfriend is?&rdquo;</b></i> Phil asked, his voice sounding raspy to his own ears.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Oh, you don&rsquo;t know? He was transferred to the physic ward two days ago.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><br /></p><p>Wait what, he was just with Dan last night.</p><p><br /></p><p>The doctor had to come in and explain that the infection in his hand had gotten worse, and he had been out of it for the last two days. He was upset that they had committed Dan to the psychiatric ward. He had known Dan for almost ten years, and if he knew one thing about him, it was that he wouldn&rsquo;t be happy being in a psychiatric ward. So is first priority was to get well enough to get to see Dan and get them both out of here and back home where they belonged.</p>",
