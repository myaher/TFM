Quickly, you turned on your heel, only to be met by the Hound.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going girl?\u201d, he growled, beads of sweat glistened on his forehead. You observed him and noticed that something was missing,\u00a0\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be wearing your cloak sir?\u201d. Sandor frowned at you, his towering frame looked even more intimidating with all the commotion going on,\u00a0\u201cFuck the king\u201d, Sandor hissed lowly. Picking up your skirts you tried to act confident,\u00a0\u201cYes fuck the king indeed\u201d, you mumbled as you started to glide past the Hound but a large, tree-trunk like hand clamped down on your arm.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cRelease me at once\u201d, you commanded still trying to go about leaving but to no avail, Sandor was much stronger than you.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re coming with me girl\u201d.<br/></p><p><b><i>A Few Months Later&hellip;</i></b></p><p>\u201cAre you ever going to let me go?\u201d, you asked sourly as the sun blazed down on your dirt-covered skin.

Ignoring his jibe you released your hands for a second, wiping them across the breeches Sandor had been so kind to give you. As you placed them back onto the mare\u2019s mane, your hands brushed over Sandor\u2019s and you couldn\u2019t deny the small shiver of pleasure that rushed to your stomach.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired, can we rest?\u201d, you asked politely.\u00a0\u201cNo\u201d. Swallowing your pride you tried once more,\u00a0\u201cCan we <i>please </i>rest Sandor? I am <i>very </i>tired\u201d. The Hound felt his cold heart soften just a bit at the gentle tone you\u2019d used, and combined with the way you said his name he felt compelled to comply,\u00a0\u201cWe will soon little one\u201d.<br/></p><p>The rest of the journey was spent in silence as the horse trotted along the bumpy road until Sandor spotted a small woodland area which he decided would be perfect to rest at; it was quiet, secluded and most of all out of view. No one should bother the pair of you there. He steered the mare towards the little opening, opting to get off and walk instead. When the Hound decided it was a good spot he stopped the horse, he offered you his hand,\u00a0\u201cMy lady\u201d, he prompted offering you his hand which you graciously accepted. He wrapped an arm around your waist and lifted you effortlessly, placing you onto the ground with caution,\u00a0\u201cThank you\u201d.</p><p>It was hours later when night had fallen, the cold had set in and the fire was dwindling.</p><p>The Hound was content, lying on the ground with his head resting on his pack. You, however were not happy. Multiple shivers contorted through your body forcing you to sit upright and embrace your knees to your chest. Sniffles rang through the otherwise silent night causing the Hound\u2019s rest to be disturbed, he tried hard to ignore the noise until he couldn\u2019t bare it anymore.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it girl?\u201d, he chided crossing his arms across his chest.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d, you stuttered,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m just cold\u201d.\u00a0\u201cWell can you be cold and quiet?\u201d, Sandor snapped. When you murmured another small apology he felt guilty, although he tried to ignore it by focusing more on sleep.<br/></p><p>You tried much harder to still your shivers and sniffles though a few still escaped and with each one it played more and more on Sandor\u2019s conscious, yet he said nothing. A thought quickly danced across your mind, and although it was risky you were too cold to be bothered. Quietly you stood up from the ground and tip-toed over to where the giant was resting, even more silently you cautiously sat down next to him. Sandor heard you move but said nothing, he was too focused on trying to sleep and planning his next move.</p><p>It was when he felt your body nestle up into his back that he was pulled back into reality. Sandor wanted to recoil away from you but he resisted as instead of the initial disgust he felt a warmth spread through him; one that he\u2019d only ever dreamed of experiencing. Soon enough his rigid body relaxed, allowing you to wiggle further against him.</p><p>\u201cI hope you won\u2019t keep this up all night, lie still little one\u201d, Sandor whispered delicately. You did as told much to Sandor\u2019s delight, even though he was giving off lots of heat you were still freezing. The Hound could tell you were trying not to shiver against his back, so in a new wave of confidence and in an attempt to still you so he could sleep comfortably, he rolled over and pulled you into his chest. You said nothing and he was grateful for this, along with the new feelings you were giving him. Slowly, you were warming up, the heat was lulling you away into sleep.<br/></p><p>\u201cThank you Sandor\u201d, you smiled giving out a small yawn. He bit back a smile but responded,\u00a0\u201cSleep well now little one\u201d.<br/></p>",

Racing to Sansa\u2019s room, you hammered on your sister\u2019s door and when there was no response, you let yourself in.\u00a0\u201cDamn\u201d, she wasn\u2019t in there. Quickly, you turned on your heel, only to be met by the Hound.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going girl?\u201d, he growled, beads of sweat glistened on his forehead. You observed him and noticed that something was missing,\u00a0\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be wearing your cloak sir?\u201d. Sandor frowned at you, his towering frame looked even more intimidating with all the commotion going on,\u00a0\u201cFuck the king\u201d, Sandor hissed lowly. Picking up your skirts you tried to act confident,\u00a0\u201cYes fuck the king indeed\u201d, you mumbled as you started to glide past the Hound but a large, tree-trunk like hand clamped down on your arm.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cRelease me at once\u201d, you commanded still trying to go about leaving but to no avail, Sandor was much stronger than you.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re coming with me girl\u201d.<br></p><p><b><i>A Few Months Later\u2026</i></b></p><p>\u201cAre you ever going to let me go?\u201d, you asked sourly as the sun blazed down on your dirt-covered skin. You felt a rumble come from Sandor\u2019s chest, (which was pressed against your back due to the fact you were riding on the same horse), he let one chuckle pass his lips,\u00a0\u201cWhat do you think, little one?\u201d.<br></p>[[MORE]]<p>You huffed out in protest, your hands were growing tired gripping onto the horse\u2019s mane,\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re dishonourable\u201d. Sandor couldn\u2019t help but to smile,\u00a0\u201cHumour me some more (Y/N), we\u2019ve still got a long journey\u201d. Ignoring his jibe you released your hands for a second, wiping them across the breeches Sandor had been so kind to give you. As you placed them back onto the mare\u2019s mane, your hands brushed over Sandor\u2019s and you couldn\u2019t deny the small shiver of pleasure that rushed to your stomach.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired, can we rest?\u201d, you asked politely.\u00a0\u201cNo\u201d. Swallowing your pride you tried once more,\u00a0\u201cCan we <i>please </i>rest Sandor? I am <i>very </i>tired\u201d. The Hound felt his cold heart soften just a bit at the gentle tone you\u2019d used, and combined with the way you said his name he felt compelled to comply,\u00a0\u201cWe will soon little one\u201d.<br></p><p>The rest of the journey was spent in silence as the horse trotted along the bumpy road until Sandor spotted a small woodland area which he decided would be perfect to rest at; it was quiet, secluded and most of all out of view. No one should bother the pair of you there. He steered the mare towards the little opening, opting to get off and walk instead. When the Hound decided it was a good spot he stopped the horse, he offered you his hand,\u00a0\u201cMy lady\u201d, he prompted offering you his hand which you graciously accepted. He wrapped an arm around your waist and lifted you effortlessly, placing you onto the ground with caution,\u00a0\u201cThank you\u201d.</p><p>It was hours later when night had fallen, the cold had set in and the fire was dwindling.</p><p>The Hound was content, lying on the ground with his head resting on his pack. You, however were not happy. Multiple shivers contorted through your body forcing you to sit upright and embrace your knees to your chest. Sniffles rang through the otherwise silent night causing the Hound\u2019s rest to be disturbed, he tried hard to ignore the noise until he couldn\u2019t bare it anymore.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it girl?\u201d, he chided crossing his arms across his chest.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d, you stuttered,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m just cold\u201d.\u00a0\u201cWell can you be cold and quiet?\u201d, Sandor snapped. When you murmured another small apology he felt guilty, although he tried to ignore it by focusing more on sleep.<br></p><p>You tried much harder to still your shivers and sniffles though a few still escaped and with each one it played more and more on Sandor\u2019s conscious, yet he said nothing. A thought quickly danced across your mind, and although it was risky you were too cold to be bothered. Quietly you stood up from the ground and tip-toed over to where the giant was resting, even more silently you cautiously sat down next to him. Sandor heard you move but said nothing, he was too focused on trying to sleep and planning his next move.</p><p>It was when he felt your body nestle up into his back that he was pulled back into reality. Sandor wanted to recoil away from you but he resisted as instead of the initial disgust he felt a warmth spread through him; one that he\u2019d only ever dreamed of experiencing. Soon enough his rigid body relaxed, allowing you to wiggle further against him.</p><p>\u201cI hope you won\u2019t keep this up all night, lie still little one\u201d, Sandor whispered delicately. You did as told much to Sandor\u2019s delight, even though he was giving off lots of heat you were still freezing. The Hound could tell you were trying not to shiver against his back, so in a new wave of confidence and in an attempt to still you so he could sleep comfortably, he rolled over and pulled you into his chest. You said nothing and he was grateful for this, along with the new feelings you were giving him. Slowly, you were warming up, the heat was lulling you away into sleep.<br></p><p>\u201cThank you Sandor\u201d, you smiled giving out a small yawn. He bit back a smile but responded,\u00a0\u201cSleep well now little one\u201d.<br></p></p>",

The stories, the heartbreaking scenes, and the blood.

You were on what seemed like a Game of Thrones set, only it was not fake.</p><p>You sat up with a groan and stared at your surroundings in shock. </p><p>The stone walls and beautiful fortress you were use to seeing on TV was directly in front of your face as reality. In that moment you also concluded your small TV could never give this place justice.</p><p>Winterfell. </p><p>The home of the Starks, and where the story begins.</p><p>Slowly and hesitantly, you rose, expecting all of it to disappear the more you came to your senses. However, the more your mind cleared the more you realized this is no dream.</p><p>Other than feeling a bit dizzy, you were unharmed from the change of worlds. You were still in the clothes of your world and you knew it&rsquo;d be strange for someone of Westros to see, but it&rsquo;s not like there were any gowns laying around.</p><p>Unable to think of any other ideas, you began to follow the stone wall in hopes of finding the entrance.</p><p>&ldquo;Who goes there?&rdquo; A guard hollered out as your head still spun. You glanced at his metal armor in fascination, but quickly gathered your wits. Being in Westros was one thing, but also proof of the people was another thing to take in. </p><p>You knew if you weren&rsquo;t someone of importance in this world the less likely you were to come into harm, but there was also less of a chance of you meeting people of importance. This is what led you to go with the theatrics a bit.</p><p>&ldquo;Can you help me Ser?&rdquo; You asked, faking what you hoped sounded like a correct accent. </p><p>&ldquo;Depends, who are you?&rdquo; The guard cautiously glanced about, checking if you were alone. You noted that the Stark guard was a smart man to take simple precautions. The brief thought that you could&rsquo;ve appeared in some place like King&rsquo;s Landing made you appreciate how lucky you were, even if it was freezing. </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the issue, I-I don&rsquo;t know&hellip; I&rsquo;m so very confused!&rdquo; You added a lip quiver and luckily managed some tears leftover from stress, &ldquo;I think something terrible might have happened!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Seven hells!&rdquo; The man cussed out, clearly not knowing what to do with a crying woman. You knew you were lucky this man wasn&rsquo;t a rapist or murder, considering how common it seemed in this world. </p><p>&ldquo;Do you think you can help me?&rdquo; You cried and he nervously shifted.</p><p>&ldquo;Just stay put!&rdquo; He commanded and walked into Winterfell. You almost had followed, but if you were going to do this you needed to play your cards right. And the way to earn a Stark&rsquo;s trust is to be trustful yourself. </p><p>It was ironic considering this was started on a big lie, but you swore that only your origin would be the lie you tell. And even then, you&rsquo;d just claim to have no memory.</p><p>After waiting for what seemed like forever in the cold, two figures approached. One being the guard, and the other being Ned Stark. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you alright, my lady?&rdquo; He questioned and took in your strange clothes. He also noted how you were shivering and quickly led you inside leaving the guard behind.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m alright&hellip; I think,&rdquo; you winced slightly at your grammar, but continued, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just confused and scared.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mikas informed me of your situation, do you know your name or house?&rdquo; He questioned. You had an internal battle of what you should say, but in the end truth won.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I believe my name is Y/N&hellip; other than that I seem to draw a blank.&rdquo; You let out a genuine frustrated sigh. All you wanted to scream was DON&rsquo;T GO TO THE CAPITAL! YOU&rsquo;LL DIE! Or a million other spoilers, but you needed to be careful or else you&rsquo;d be labeled as crazy.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N? That&rsquo;s an unusual name, and usually a unique name would aid in finding your identity, but I seem to not know myself,&rdquo; His genuine concern and helpfulness made you feel a sliver of guilt, but before you could ruin anything he added, &ldquo;Maybe with a nights rest your memories shall return, it&rsquo;s very late and I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ll be no help until I sleep myself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry over me my Lord&hellip; uh&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Lord Stark, but you can call me Ned or Eddard.&rdquo; You were proud you remembered to ask. It would suspicious if you randomly started calling him Lord Stark.</p><p>&ldquo;Um Eddard, I&rsquo;m only sorry I troubled you with all this.&rdquo; You smiled weakly and which he returned.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fret, this will all be resolved before you know it, I&rsquo;ll get someone to set up your quarters for the evening.&rdquo; He left quickly after that and once again you were alone in Winterfell.</p><p>Only then you began to wonder if when you fell asleep you&rsquo;d remain here. Maybe you were crazy or this was just a very realist dream.</p><p>Either way, you&rsquo;d try your best to fix what you could.</p><p>PART <a href=\"https://targaryenthot.tumblr.com/post/183935315698/out-of-this-world-ii\">TWO</a></p>",
