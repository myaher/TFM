Dan watched for the new Phil video because surely \u00a0that would be coming out soon. With how much they filmed, he couldn&rsquo;t imagine that it would take very long to get edited and posted. When he found the channel, he found himself nose deep in catching up with Phil&rsquo;s newer videos, and even some from right after Dan had quit watching him. He had to give up something to be able to pass his classes at uni. He spent too much money (and still had loads to pay off) to fail out and have to retake everything and put himself further in student loans. </p><p>I&rsquo;m coming home today, Dan DMed Phil, even though by all technicalities, he wouldn&rsquo;t be home until tomorrow in UK time, even if it was still today in America and according to the time that he&rsquo;d somehow gotten used to over the course of the week. He looked up to the board that had all of the flight times on it and tried to find his gate. Once he did, he grabbed his bags and headed that way. He took the time to check his YouTube because he knew Phil was probably not going to reply to him. He still only had one view and one like on his video. Those were pretty good stats, if he could say so himself. That meant one-hundred percent of the people who watched his video liked it. </p><p>Even if that person was just Phil Lester. </p><p>Ironically, Phil wrote back, I&rsquo;m going to be in London tomorrow so just let me know and we can meet up somewhere. Dan smiled. He knew that Phil probably only was going to be in London to see him. He knew that Phil wasn&rsquo;t a huge fan of YouTube conventions and things like that. Even if there was a convention that week, Phil wouldn&rsquo;t be going to it. Dan shook his head and laughed. </p><p>&ldquo;You talking to your wife?&rdquo; An older woman who was sat next to him asked, trying to look over his shoulder to see the messages. He put his phone in his pocket because it was none of her business who he was talking to, especially not what he was saying to the person he was talking to. </p><p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; He said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not married,&rdquo; he said. He almost said that he wasn&rsquo;t straight and had no interest in finding a wife, but this woman was a stranger who didn&rsquo;t need to know that information. His own family didn&rsquo;t even know that information even though he&rsquo;d had some pretty serious relationships with men in the past. He almost married one of them but they got in a huge fight the night before they were going to announce it to Dan&rsquo;s family and broke off the engagement. The woman huffed her disapproval. Dan rolled his eyes and turned his body so he could DM Phil. </p><p>Miss me already? Dan teased with a smile. He thought it was sweet and was quite frankly happy to know that he was going to be coming to London. He had missed Phil a lot himself and wasn&rsquo;t even going to pretend to deny that to anyone. </p><p>How cheesy would it be if I said yes? Dan smiled. </p><p>I thought you hated cheese. Dan said with a giggle. He felt the glare of the woman on the back of his head, but he didn&rsquo;t really care because he was in his own little world. Just him and Phil. His we-don&rsquo;t-label-things-but-we-just-kiss-and-are-exclusive partner. Dan curled up around his phone, as if Phil would magically appear if he held on tight enough. He felt it buzz but he didn&rsquo;t want to move because he didn&rsquo;t want to let go of his imagination. </p><p>&ldquo;Not talking to your wife aye,&rdquo; the woman snarled. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s she like?&rdquo; Dan couldn&rsquo;t help but feel like he wanted to punch this nosy ass woman right in the face because she was being rude. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have one ma'am,&rdquo; Dan insisted even though it was a useless argument because this woman wasn&rsquo;t going to believe him and he would never see her again after this flight was off.</p><p>Oh yes, I have a severe fear of cheese, I avoid it at all costs, that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m asking if it&rsquo;s cheesy. Phil replied. Dan smiled and held his phone up to his chest while he thought of a reply. </p><p>&ldquo;Well it&rsquo;s someone important,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Tell me about her.&rdquo; Dan shook his head. The flight attendant began calling people to get on the plane. </p><p>&ldquo;Why are you even talking to me?&rdquo; Dan asked, shooting a nasty glare in her direction. &ldquo;Nothing I do or say or anything has anything to do with you.&rdquo; The woman looked taken aback for some reason. Dan decided to just ignore her. </p><p>No, it&rsquo;s not cheesy, I think it&rsquo;s sweet. I&rsquo;ve missed you too, Dan sent back. He had no idea how they&rsquo;d even questioned the fact that they&rsquo;d stay in touch because he hadn&rsquo;t stopped thinking about Phil since the day he woke up and realized that Phil was gone. His dark hair, pretty eyes, pale skin, his sense of humor &hellip;</p><p>He stood up as the flight attendant said it was the last call for passengers to board the plane. He grabbed his bag and pulled his ticket and passport out of his pocket. The attendant let him through and he followed the line until he found his seat. He put his bag in the overhead compartment. He sat down, buckled his seat belt and got signed onto the wifi on the plane. It was only ok, but he wasn&rsquo;t about to leave Phil hanging. It was a long ass flight anyway and he wasn&rsquo;t about that life. </p><p>Phil sent him a selfie of him with his glasses on with a giant smile on his face. Dan noticed that he did that a lot when he didn&rsquo;t have anything to say but didn&rsquo;t want the conversation to die yet. </p><p>I&rsquo;m on the plane now, Dan said. He sat back and got as comfortable in the seat as he could being as tall as he was and as hard as the seats were. He considered trying to fall asleep but he knew that would be pointless because he wasn&rsquo;t tired at the current second. </p><p>Have a safe flight, also get off the internet so you don&rsquo;t crash. Dan smiled and put his phone in his pocket and closed the window beside him. He closed his eyes and found himself drifting off to sleep. </p><p>***</p><p>Dan was jolted awake by a hit of turbulence. Normally he wasn&rsquo;t one who got scared by turbulence, but his heart pounded in his chest. Probably because he was forced to wake up rather than just waking up naturally like he&rsquo;d gotten used to over the last week. He opened the window to see if they were anywhere near anything. Just water. The sky was dark. He checked his phone for the time. It was nearly eleven PM in whatever timezone they were in at the current second. He smiled as he wondered how much longer he had until he was back in England. He saw that his Twitter had blown up with DMs from Phil. Mostly talking about how he was joking about going offline and things like that. How he was bored. The last one was a message saying that Phil was going to bed and would talk to him in the morning about when Dan would be home and where they should meet once Phil got to London. Dan smiled and decided to send Phil a good morning message to Phil even though it would probably still be hours before Phil would see it and Dan would probably be awake at a better time to be sending a good morning message to Phil. He just wanted to make sure Phil got it before he woke up the next morning and had something to look forward to. </p><p>Just a short two hours later, the pilot was announcing to prepare for a landing to a cabin of mostly sleeping passengers. Dan couldn&rsquo;t sleep anymore. He was too excited to see Phil whenever he got to London that very day. It would probably only be a few hours before he would see his Phil again. he couldn&rsquo;t sleep knowing that he was not all that long from seeing Phil again. How could he? He&rsquo;d missed Phil more than he could even put to words. </p>",

Dan watched for the new Phil video because surely \u00a0that would be coming out soon. With how much they filmed, he couldn\u2019t imagine that it would take very long to get edited and posted. When he found the channel, he found himself nose deep in catching up with Phil\u2019s newer videos, and even some from right after Dan had quit watching him. He had to give up something to be able to pass his classes at uni. He spent too much money (and still had loads to pay off) to fail out and have to retake everything and put himself further in student loans. </p><p>I\u2019m coming home today, Dan DMed Phil, even though by all technicalities, he wouldn\u2019t be home until tomorrow in UK time, even if it was still today in America and according to the time that he\u2019d somehow gotten used to over the course of the week. He looked up to the board that had all of the flight times on it and tried to find his gate. Once he did, he grabbed his bags and headed that way. He took the time to check his YouTube because he knew Phil was probably not going to reply to him. He still only had one view and one like on his video. Those were pretty good stats, if he could say so himself. That meant one-hundred percent of the people who watched his video liked it. </p><p>Even if that person was just Phil Lester. </p><p>Ironically, Phil wrote back, I\u2019m going to be in London tomorrow so just let me know and we can meet up somewhere. Dan smiled. He knew that Phil probably only was going to be in London to see him. He knew that Phil wasn\u2019t a huge fan of YouTube conventions and things like that. Even if there was a convention that week, Phil wouldn\u2019t be going to it. Dan shook his head and laughed. </p><p>\u201cYou talking to your wife?\u201d An older woman who was sat next to him asked, trying to look over his shoulder to see the messages. He put his phone in his pocket because it was none of her business who he was talking to, especially not what he was saying to the person he was talking to. </p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d He said. \u201cI\u2019m not married,\u201d he said. He almost said that he wasn\u2019t straight and had no interest in finding a wife, but this woman was a stranger who didn\u2019t need to know that information. His own family didn\u2019t even know that information even though he\u2019d had some pretty serious relationships with men in the past. He almost married one of them but they got in a huge fight the night before they were going to announce it to Dan\u2019s family and broke off the engagement. The woman huffed her disapproval. Dan rolled his eyes and turned his body so he could DM Phil. </p><p>Miss me already? Dan teased with a smile. He thought it was sweet and was quite frankly happy to know that he was going to be coming to London. He had missed Phil a lot himself and wasn\u2019t even going to pretend to deny that to anyone. </p><p>How cheesy would it be if I said yes? Dan smiled. </p><p>I thought you hated cheese. Dan said with a giggle. He felt the glare of the woman on the back of his head, but he didn\u2019t really care because he was in his own little world. Just him and Phil. His we-don\u2019t-label-things-but-we-just-kiss-and-are-exclusive partner. Dan curled up around his phone, as if Phil would magically appear if he held on tight enough. He felt it buzz but he didn\u2019t want to move because he didn\u2019t want to let go of his imagination. </p><p>\u201cNot talking to your wife aye,\u201d the woman snarled. \u201cWhat\u2019s she like?\u201d Dan couldn\u2019t help but feel like he wanted to punch this nosy ass woman right in the face because she was being rude. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have one ma'am,\u201d Dan insisted even though it was a useless argument because this woman wasn\u2019t going to believe him and he would never see her again after this flight was off.</p><p>Oh yes, I have a severe fear of cheese, I avoid it at all costs, that\u2019s why I\u2019m asking if it\u2019s cheesy. Phil replied. Dan smiled and held his phone up to his chest while he thought of a reply. </p><p>\u201cWell it\u2019s someone important,\u201d she said. \u201cTell me about her.\u201d Dan shook his head. The flight attendant began calling people to get on the plane. </p><p>\u201cWhy are you even talking to me?\u201d Dan asked, shooting a nasty glare in her direction. \u201cNothing I do or say or anything has anything to do with you.\u201d The woman looked taken aback for some reason. Dan decided to just ignore her. </p><p>No, it\u2019s not cheesy, I think it\u2019s sweet. I\u2019ve missed you too, Dan sent back. He had no idea how they\u2019d even questioned the fact that they\u2019d stay in touch because he hadn\u2019t stopped thinking about Phil since the day he woke up and realized that Phil was gone. His dark hair, pretty eyes, pale skin, his sense of humor \u2026</p><p>He stood up as the flight attendant said it was the last call for passengers to board the plane. He grabbed his bag and pulled his ticket and passport out of his pocket. The attendant let him through and he followed the line until he found his seat. He put his bag in the overhead compartment. He sat down, buckled his seat belt and got signed onto the wifi on the plane. It was only ok, but he wasn\u2019t about to leave Phil hanging. It was a long ass flight anyway and he wasn\u2019t about that life. </p><p>Phil sent him a selfie of him with his glasses on with a giant smile on his face. Dan noticed that he did that a lot when he didn\u2019t have anything to say but didn\u2019t want the conversation to die yet. </p><p>I\u2019m on the plane now, Dan said. He sat back and got as comfortable in the seat as he could being as tall as he was and as hard as the seats were. He considered trying to fall asleep but he knew that would be pointless because he wasn\u2019t tired at the current second. </p><p>Have a safe flight, also get off the internet so you don\u2019t crash. Dan smiled and put his phone in his pocket and closed the window beside him. He closed his eyes and found himself drifting off to sleep. </p><p>***</p><p>Dan was jolted awake by a hit of turbulence. Normally he wasn\u2019t one who got scared by turbulence, but his heart pounded in his chest. Probably because he was forced to wake up rather than just waking up naturally like he\u2019d gotten used to over the last week. He opened the window to see if they were anywhere near anything. Just water. The sky was dark. He checked his phone for the time. It was nearly eleven PM in whatever timezone they were in at the current second. He smiled as he wondered how much longer he had until he was back in England. He saw that his Twitter had blown up with DMs from Phil. Mostly talking about how he was joking about going offline and things like that. How he was bored. The last one was a message saying that Phil was going to bed and would talk to him in the morning about when Dan would be home and where they should meet once Phil got to London. Dan smiled and decided to send Phil a good morning message to Phil even though it would probably still be hours before Phil would see it and Dan would probably be awake at a better time to be sending a good morning message to Phil. He just wanted to make sure Phil got it before he woke up the next morning and had something to look forward to. </p><p>Just a short two hours later, the pilot was announcing to prepare for a landing to a cabin of mostly sleeping passengers. Dan couldn\u2019t sleep anymore. He was too excited to see Phil whenever he got to London that very day. It would probably only be a few hours before he would see his Phil again. he couldn\u2019t sleep knowing that he was not all that long from seeing Phil again. How could he? He\u2019d missed Phil more than he could even put to words. </p></p>",
