The first time it happened was the night before your first day at primary school. Your parents had chalked it up to nerves and excitement of an overly-energetic six-year old. </p><p>It continued to drain the energy out of you through your growing years, dragging you lower and lower until your head felt like it was swimming and you had to fight to keep your eyes open during class.</p><p>You learned to appreciate the day and all it brought, but how could you really when your heavy eyelids constantly betrayed you?</p><p>You&rsquo;d gotten used to the sleepless nights at this point. Some nights, you would sleep until the deep hours of the night only to stay awake for the rest of it. Other nights you&rsquo;d toss and turn for the advised six-to-eight hours before falling into a restless slumber for a few short moments.</p><p>By the time you&rsquo;d gotten to university, you didn&rsquo;t know how much more you could take. There was always the option of seeking professional help, but with the heavy weight of student loans perched on your shoulders, the solution seemed far-fetched. </p><p>You find nights to be so much longer when it&rsquo;s silent enough to hear your own heartbeat and the overwhelming feeling of loneliness floods you too often. So, you found a small apartment a few minutes&rsquo; walk from your university, rooming with another student&mdash;Min Yoongi. </p><p>He was a night-owl and music major, often staying up to work on producing his own songs; sometimes you&rsquo;d come out of your room to find Yoongi curled up on the sofa with lyrics scribbled on paper, fanning out around his sleeping form.</p><p>The man knew about your peculiar sleeping arrangements, being no stranger to sleepless nights himself. He&rsquo;d spend those nights with you tucked into his side attempting to sleep, while he focused on his work. </p><p>Being in such close proximity of each other, neither of you were very successful in doing what you were meant to.</p><p>Other nights, you&rsquo;d be in your respective rooms texting each other instead of actually conversing in person, two tired minds typing away at your phones. He&rsquo;d send links of his favourite songs and you would both spend hours together tearing the lyrics apart to find their deeper meaning.</p><p>With Yoongi, the nights seemed to speed past you, leaving you breathless and winded in its wake.</p><p>This particular night, you&rsquo;d woken up in the middle of the night, unable to fall back asleep. You knew Yoongi was asleep, your heart sinking a little at the lack of light pouring in from the living room.</p><p>A shiver wracked your frame, breaking you from your fatigued thoughts. Despite scoring the bigger room, yours had crappier heating and barely any insulation, allowing the cold, winter air to settle uncomfortably in your bones. </p><p>With a frustrated huff, you swung your legs over the edge of your bed. At this ungodly hour, your body had a mind of its own as it dragged you sleepily into Yoongi&rsquo;s room, arriving at the end of his bed. </p><p>His lightly-snoring figure laid curled under a mountainous pile of fleece blankets. Your breath caught in your throat as you snapped back into reality. You were in Min Yoongi&rsquo;s room at three in the morning.</p><p>Your hasty decision to retreat was halted by Yoongi&rsquo;s stirring. He stretched on his bed, letting out a low hum. Catching sight of your dark silhouette, he rubbed his bleary eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N?&rdquo;</p><p>You froze, wanting nothing more than the floor to swallow you whole so you wouldn&rsquo;t have to face the inevitable rejection.</p><p>Your mouth opened to speak but struggled to find the right words. They floated through your head, taunting you. You supposed silence was better than whatever raspy, pathetic apology you would have croaked out. </p><p>Before you could take a further step back, Yoongi&rsquo;s hand shot out to grab your wrist. His voice was muffled by the pillow he had his face smushed in. &ldquo;Get in here, it&rsquo;s fucking freezing.&rdquo;</p><p>You barely had time to process before you were being pulled onto the mattress and under the multiple layers of blanket. Your chest pressed against Yoongi&rsquo;s, his head nestled comfortably in the crook of your neck. </p><p>Warmth immediately spread like fire across your skin&mdash;from what, you weren&rsquo;t sure. </p><p>Yoongi&rsquo;s arm curled firmly around your waist, pulling you flush against him as his free hand dragged along your side, attempting to warm you up.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;God, what are you, an ice princess? I can hear your teeth chattering.&rdquo;</p><p>You rolled your eyes in the dark. Knowing he couldn&rsquo;t see your reaction, cold fingers snaked under his shirt to press against skin. Yoongi whined, his grip on you tightening with a light flick to the shell of your ear.</p><p>You let out a lazy chuckle at his reaction, body beginning to relax at the familiarity of his. You weren&rsquo;t a stranger to sleeping with Yoongi, but this time felt different as you curled further into his warmth. Still, just like every other time, his presence comforted you. </p><p>A content sigh escaped your lips as his fingers began to run through your hair. The consistent, soft tugs at your strands never failed to lull you to sleep. Yoongi murmured softly, &ldquo;close your eyes. I&rsquo;ll be here when you wake up.&rdquo;</p><p>As the darkness inevitably closed in on your consciousness, you felt the light, feathery peck of warm lips against your neck. Even in your hazy state, you found yourself unable to fight off the flush creeping up your neck onto your cheeks.</p><p>You slept well for the first time in ages, knowing Min Yoongi was a man of his word. </p></p>",

This is the next jungkook scenario which i dont know invaded my mind at around&hellip;.. 2 AM in the night lol. This is gonna be a long one and i really hope that you all like this too!\u00a0</p><hr><p>\u201cI wish you a really happy and splendid birthday dear sis.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cThank you so so much, I cannot be anymore happier oppa&hellip;. thank you for all this. But honestly speaking, so much was not required.\u201d<br/></p><p>You refused to leave the warm embrace of your sweet and caring older brother Taehyung. It was your birthday, not like you had been waiting for this day to come. You had planned to spend the day just like any other normal day. Little had you known that Taehyung had this big as fuck birthday bash planned for this day with all of your friends invited( including his). Friends included your college ones, high school ones, primary school ones and the ones who live light years away from your connection. So it was his surprise for you to invite all your friends whom you had not met for quite a long time and make the night a memorable one.</p><p>He chuckled,\u00a0\u201c Hey Y/N, you have been hugging me all day&hellip; well I am not complaining, you usually kick me the entire day, I wish your birthday could come everyday and i would have my pretty little sister hug me like this.\u201d</p><p>You quickly left him and glared at him,\u00a0\u201c Sometimes I feel that I should start behaving nice to you, but then you yourself prove to me how big of an asshole you are.\u201d</p><p>He clutched white fabric of the shirt in front of his chest,\u00a0\u201c Ouch, that was rude.\u201d</p><p>All this while you heard Taehyung\u2019s phone notifying something for like twenty times. You wondered who was so desperate to talk to him,\u00a0\u201cHey oppa, why don\u2019t you reply something to that crazy girlfriend of yours?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung\u2019s eyes widened,\u00a0\u201coh shit!\u201d</p><p>He quickly grabbed his phone and replied to all the messages that he had recieved.\u00a0\u201c You both are crazy.\u201d</p><p>His fingers stopped typing and his head shot towards you. He stared at you for a while. You raised your eyebrows in a questioning look,\u00a0\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head in amusement before saying,\u00a0\u201c You are saying this because you STILL don\u2019t have a fucking boyfriend. And god knows how you are still surviving.\u201d It wasn\u2019t the first time that he made fun of you for not having a boyfriend even when you were 20.</p><p>You rolled your eyes,\u00a0\u201c I don\u2019t need one oppa, staying in a relationship&hellip;. doesn\u2019t that suck?\u201d You said, not quite sure of your own words.</p><p>\u201c You mean to say that being in a relat-, having a boyfriend will suck?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cOh yes exactly, strange you understood me at once because normally your dumb brain takes half a minute to understand a sentence.\u201d He glared at you and pulled your cheeks hard.\u00a0\u201c I am your fucking brother! How can you talk to me like this?\u201d<br/></p><p>You whimpered,\u00a0\u201c AH- ouch! oppa I swear to God if you don\u2019t leave me at this very mom-\u201d. Suddenly his phone rang out out of no where and he left your cheek at once. You rubbed the swollen skin while glaring at him.\u00a0\u201c Asshole.\u201d He seemed to ignore what you said and instead picked up the call hurriedly.</p><p>\u201cOh fuc- shit sorry! hey you wait right there I\u2019ll be there in a minute!\u201d He said nd quickly disconnected the phone.<br/></p><p>\u201cAww what happened your girlfriend is furious?? Oh I am so glad that she is.\u201d You said and gave a devilish smile. Before he began running to where he intended to he said,\u00a0\u201c First of all, its not my brain which is dumb, its yours that is, because it always assumes stupid and useless things and makes you speak rubbish and utter nonsense. And second of all, its not my girlfriend, there are some of my friends I had invited waiting near our house who are even more crazier than her. I guess I am a lot more clearer now I hope your poor brain was able to take so much at once, anyways I\u2019ll see you in a while bubye.\u201d<br/></p><p>He threw the words at your face and walked away. Your mouth was wide open and your jaws were about to crash the ground. You stamped your leg and kicked disgustedly at the floor,\u00a0\u201c Taehyung you are such an asshole!.\u201d</p><p>You recollected the words that he threw at your face.\u00a0\u201c&hellip;..<i>some of my friends I invited</i>\u201d. His friends. You were quite sure that they were none other than the 6 guys of his terrible friend circle and no doubt they were the craziest persons that you had ever met. Actually, heard of. Park Jimin, a total flirt, was the only one with whom you had some sort of a friendly relation. About two other guys that were Hoseok and Yoongi you were not so sure of. You had spoken to Jin and Namjoon a few times.</p><p>\u00a0And&hellip;. there was Jeon Jungkook. You had never met him in real and neither did you ever speak to him in person. But he was the one about whom Taehyung would speak of the most. About his looks, his physique, his childish nature, his shy nature. Also that he was the most loved one and had a really beautiful voice. You had began liking him since the day you saw him in a video. It was Hoseok\u2019s birthday bash and Jungkook, as his special present for Hoseok, sang a beautiful song which was indeed your favourite. Next you saw him in one of his dance videos. You were at awe when you saw him dancing, his thighs, his neck, the way his biceps would bulge out each time he did a move was what led you to having some sort of a crush on him.So, you were excited to see him that evening. Out of no where a thought clicked your mind and you rushed to your room.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201c I think I should find something good to wear.\u201d<br/></p><hr><p>It was 4 PM and Taehyung was seen running across the house every instant trying to verify that every corner of the house was just the way he wanted it and\u00a0 to be. He had put some of his friends to work and you wondered since when did they began agreeing to him and working according to what he said?</p><p>\u201c Yah Taehyung, we have been helping you for three hours! And you are simply running here and there shouting at us! what the fuck do you think we are som-\u201d. Jimin quickly paused when he saw you quietly standing in one corner and silently observing the party arrangements.\u00a0\u201cOh hey Y/N\u201d</p><p>He said and walked towards you pulling you by your waist into a soft hug.\u00a0\u201cHappy birthday pretty lady.\u201d You face contorted at the cheesy pet name and you pulled yourself out of the hug.\u00a0\u201c Thanks, for wishing and also for the wonderful pet name.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled,\u00a0\u201cWell bab-\u201d He was cut off by Taehyung shouting at him from behind.\u00a0\u201c Park-fucking-Jimin how dare did you tou-, hug my sister without my fucking permission you son of a-!\u201d He shouted as he stormed towards Jimin and punched him in the stomach.</p><p>Jimin stumbled a few steps back and whimpered, \u201c Ouch!!! Yah I helped you in the arrangements and you don\u2019t even let me hug your prett-\u201d He was cut off by another punch in the stomach.\u00a0\u201cNO. Not without my permission I have made myself clear several times before. I want to keep my sister from you assholes understand? So don\u2019t think of trying anything with her when I am not around.\u201d<br/></p><p>You looked at Jimin with pity and sighed. It wasn\u2019t new that a guy was either punched or kicked by Taehyung for touching you when he was not around. The concept was Taehyung was a don\u2019t-you-dare-try-coming-close-to-my-sister type brother. A way too protective towards you. Maybe because you were the only one in his life. And so was he in yours. You never had much friends and you were more confined to the warm hugs and love of your brother than to anyone, anything else. He had been taking care of you since you were 7, so all you remember is the hard work he did and the love and care he bestowed upon you for all these years.</p><p>But still you called him an asshole.</p><p>\u201c You always try to keep Y/N away from assholes, then how are you letting her stay with yourself I fail to understand.\u201d Jimin said in a sarcastic voice and in spite of the pain in his stomach giggled a little. You tried to hold in a laughter-<br/></p><p>\u201cHey Tae! What\u2019s up buddy?\u201d. A tone not so familiar to you glided against your ears. The three of you turned back to see the newcomer.</p><p>\u201cHey! You three! Hell after how long are we all meeting?\u201d He said and rushed towards and in no time was engaged in bro hugs. Jimin soon joined the other 4. According to your knowledge, they were Hoseok, Jin and Namjoon. Your eyes searched for the remaining two, to be more specific, for Jungkook. There was a slight show of disappointment on your countenance when you unfortunately did not find him in that group.\u00a0</p><p>They turned back at you and began walking, \u201cHey Y/N.\u00a0 We wish you a really happy and splendid birthday dear&hellip; It\u2019s nice to see you after so long you know.\u201d You assumed that it was Hoseok who spoke.<br/></p><p>\u201c Thank you so much you all for coming, yeh It\u2019s been really long since you guys have met, I hope that you all enjoy this night.\u201d You said with an affectionate smile.<br/></p><p>\u201cHey Jin hyung, where are Suga and the maknae? Not yet here? They are coming right? I swear to god if they don\u2019t come tonight I wil-\u201d He was soon interupted by another voice&hellip;.. which WAS familiar to you in a different way. You did not have to turn back to see and make sure who it was, the moment you heard the voice you knew,<i>\u00a0\u201c&hellip;..he\u2019s here, OMG.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cHey hyung.\u201d<br/></p><p>Everyone there turned back, and so did you, trying hard not to get nervous or feel shy and then the situation would turn awkward because it was the first time that you met him. Your eyes were the first to meet his, and for the first time. He looked at you for a awhile and your heart was beating rapidly. He smiled at you and that was when you felt that you were going to lose your senses right then and there.</p><p>\u201cHey Kook, Suga hyung, nice to see you both after so long.\u201d Taehyung said and was engaged in bro hugs for the second time,<br/></p><p>\u201cHey Y/N, I guess that I am meeting you for the first time, anyways I wish you a really happy birthday, please enjoy.\u201d It was Suga who spoke this time. You returned his greetings with a smile,\u00a0\u201cThank you oppa, I am glad that you came, you too please enjoy the night.\u201d<br/></p><p>He smiled and went to get himself engaged in bro hugs with the other guys. And that was when only one person was left. Jungkook. Your eyes met his for the second time and you felt that the charm in his eyes doubled. He shyly walked towards you,\u00a0\u201cHey&hellip;. Happy birthday Y/N.\u201d He said with a pleasing tone and extended his right hand towards you. You gladly accepted it with a pink blush on your cheeks.</p><p>\u201cThank you Jungkook oppa.\u201d He was about to say something when Taehyung interrupted the two of you. You cursed him a thousand for doing that.<br/></p><p>\u201cHey! Fucking come and help me with the preparations kook! I am not going to leave you guys just like that!\u201d He said and gave a devilish smile.<br/></p><p>\u201cYes, we would love to help you out Taehyung.\u201d Jin said and the others seemd to agree. You looked at Jungkook and he seemed to be saying something to Taehyung which you failed to understand. After a few moments everyone left for work and so did Tae, to guide and instruct them. You watched him walk away and then looked back at Jungkook.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019d like to talk to you for sometime Y/N.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>You were first shocked after hearing him a say that but then nodded shyly.\u00a0\u201cYes sure oppa.\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head and suddenly pushed you to one side. You first jumped due to to his sudden action and widened your eyes. He did not look at you but was looking back. You moved your head to one side and saw that some of the workers were trying to move a chandelier and you guys were blocking the way. He kept you in front of him and they carried away the chandelier from behind his back.</p><p>Such a gentleman.</p><p>After they were gone he looked at you. His face was close and you were sure that he could feel the heat that was coming from your face.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t call me oppa please, it\u2019s weird you know, for me.\u201d He said and smiled which was more like smirk. You stared at him for a while and then nodded shyly, blushing at the fact that he wanted you to call him just by his name. He did not move back but was staring back down at you. If you had stayed there for a little while longer then you were sure to faint right then and there.</p><p>\u201cUmm, the workers are gone.\u201d He was snapped back to reality. He looked back to ensure that they were actually gone and got back to his original position at once.\u201dI should be distant from you before your brother kills me.\u201d He said and looked around to see if Taehyung was around. Fortunately, he wasn\u2019t. You guys did not know that someone else, not Taehyung, was there who witnessed the enttre thing that happened just a few minutes ago.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being a real gentleman today kid?\u201d You heard jimin say somewhere from behind the man standing in front of you. Jungkook sighed and turned back,\u00a0\u201cFirst, I am always a gentleman to those who are worthy of it.\u201d<br/></p><p>Jimin glared at Jungkook,\u00a0\u201cSo you mean ti say that we all are not wor-\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd secondly, I am not the kid here today, there\u2019s someone younger than me present here.\u201d He said and slowly turned his head towards you with a smal smug on his lips. Your cheeks heated up and you looked down as if you did not understand a single thing.<br/></p><p><i>\u201cOh&hellip;&hellip;right.\u201d </i>Was all that went through your head at that moment<i>.</i><br/></p><p>\u201cI&hellip;umm, It\u2019s over\u00a0 5 PM already, I think ya\u2019ll should get ready right? Umm, Taehyung will be around here please approach him he will guide you guys where to go.. bubye!.\u201d You said and immediately rushed from that place. Jungkook and jimin chuckled in amusement.</p><p>\u201cHey&hellip;I hope you know that if Taehyung gets even a faint idea of what you are trying to do he is gonna bury you alive kook.\u201d Jimin said while putting his arms around his shoulders.<br/></p><p>Jungkook simply smiled and looked at the way in which you ran away.</p><hr><p>It was 6:30 PM already and you were still standing in front of your mirror judging the way you looked with your only close friend Lisa and Taehyung standing behind you with arms crossed in front of their chests. You looked at him and then at her with the same question in your eyes.</p><p>\u201cHey guys, do I look good?\u201d<br/></p><p>Lisa was tired of giving the same answer and simply gave you a disgusted look while Taehyung laughed a little and looked the other way and then back at you,\u00a0\u201cYes Y/N, you are looking beautiful as always, now stop being so nervous else that will cover the charm of your original countenance.\u201d</p><p>Lisa nodded,\u00a0\u201cYes he is right Y/N, now I swear to god if you ask us the same question again I will leave, come on now everyone is waiting!\u201d</p><p>Still not sure whether the way you looked was good or not, you walked away and sighed when you heard Taehyung close the door behind you.</p><p><i>\u201cThere\u2019s no going back now&hellip;&hellip;\u201d</i><br/></p><p>You guys entered the main ahll and all you could see was not less than a 100 guests out of which you could barely recognize anyone. You looked around and searched for <i>him.</i>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey Y/N.\u201d You heard a voice behind you and turned to see Jin\u00a0 with a few gifts in there hands. Your eyes widened and you smiled at them.<br/></p><p>\u201cHey you guys&hellip;.look great!\u201d You said and they giggled.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou too look\nbeautiful Y/N. And here, take these, since we did not know anything in\nparticular that you liked, we bought one out of anything that we found, please accept\nour gifts and one again we wish you a really Happy Birthday dear. This is your\nday please enjoy.\u201d Namjoon said in the most affectionate voice possible and all\nthe others smiled at you.</p><p>\u00a0 <i>\u201cHell they all are so nice why didn\u2019t I talk to them before?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cWell\nit was me who invited you guys here and there is still not a single thanks to\nme.\u201d Taehyung sneered and you chuckled. The others also did the same and yoiur\neyes were still trading the entire hall searching for Jungkook. After a few\nminutes of chatting you saw Jimin entering the hall. You watched more closely\nto see if Jungkook would enter next.\u00a0And\nhe did.\u00a0He\nwas wearing and light blue shirt with sleeves folded up till his elbow hanging\nloose above his black pants. Hair was perfectly smooth and settled with shoes.\nYou stared at him for a few minutes and did not realize when they walked all\nthe way up till where you guys were standing.</p><p>\u00a0He looked at you a smiled.\u00a0\u201cHey\nY/N, Happy birthday again, look I have got this dress for you, hope you like\nit.\u201d Jimin said and extended the gift towards you. You took it and smiled, \u201cThank\nyou so much oppa, I am sure that the dress will be just perfect.\u201dHe smiled and\nagain, bro hugs with the others. Now that again left you with one person.</p><p>\u00a0Jungkook.\nYou looked at him and he walked towards you in the same way that he did that\nafternoon.\u00a0\u201cHey\nY/N, I am not sure whether you would like what I have got but\u2026.you know, since\nI was the last one to come here this was the maximum which I could get, Happy\nbirthday, please accept this.\u201d You saw that it was a\u2026..CD? You opened the\nholder and saw that one was inside it. You smiled in amusement and looked at\nhim, \u201cHey Jungkook, what is this?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0He\nsmiled a little and said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s some of the songs. I thought that this\nwas the best thing which I could give you so\u2026\u201d Your eyes widened. You giggled\nand jumped a little. Honestly, that was the best gift which you could have.\u00a0\u201cThank\nyou so much Jungkook! Th- This is lovely I love it!\u201d You said and chuckled. He\nfirst stared at you and then laughed a little completely shocked to see you so\nhappy with that simple gift. He at the least expected you to even open it.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cGuys,\nya\u2019ll wanna dance?\u201d You heard Taehyung say as he slipped his hands around you waists\nand pulled you close to his side and kissed your temples. You smiled at him and\nshowed him the CD which Jungkook gave you. Taehyung first stared at the CD and\nthen smiled a little and ruffled your hair. You smacked his hand away and tried\nto settle your hair again.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cOh\nyeaahhhhhh I don\u2019t know about anyone else but me and Jimin are in! Anyone else\nwanna join can follow us!\u201d Hoseok exclaimed and dragged Jimin away with him to\nthe centre of the hall room where everyone was dancing.\u00a0\u201cHey\npunk wait we will be joining too!\u201d Jin, Namjoon and yoongi ran behind them.\nTaehyung looked at you and raised his eyebrows. You shook your head.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cUmm,\nhey hyung, I am not in a mood to dance so I\u2019ll be staying back.\u201d Jungkook said\nwhile inserting his palms into his pockets and looking at the dance floor.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cWell,\nthat\u2019s strange, but ok as you wish. Come Y/N.\u201d Taehyung said while pulling your\nwaist along with him to join the dance floor but you pulled back.\u00a0\u201cOppa,\nI am not in a mood to dance too.\u201d You said pouted.</p><p>\u00a0Taehyung eyed you and Jungkook\nfor a few times, \u201cHave you both planned this or something?\u201d You widened your\neyes and shook your hands while Jungkook shook his head for 10 times.\u00a0After\nstaring at the two of you for a few moments Taehyung sighed, \u201cWell, ok then.\u201d You\nsmiled and looked at Jungkook who was already smiling at you.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cBut I will be\nleaving, and kook, don\u2019t try ANYTHING with her just because I am leaving her\nalone with you, understood?\u201d Taehyung said with a firm face while Jungkook nodded\nmost obediently. Taehyung smiled at you for the last time and walked away.\u00a0Your\nheart was beating fast within your chest as it was the first time that you were\nleft alone with him.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cYou really don\u2019t want to dance?\u201d He asked.\u00a0\u201cUmm,\nyeh I.. am not really a party-friendly person Jungkook, but looks like you all\nare, why didn\u2019t you go to dance?\u201d You asked him and he smiled. He came a bit\ncloser to you and whispered in your ear, \u201cDo you want to\u2026.you know, go to a\nmore quieter place?\u201d\u00a0You\nlooked up at him and he was biting his lower lip and his eyes pleaded for your\nyes. You smiled and before you could say yes he held your wrist and pulled you\nwith him. You looked back for the final time to check if Taehyung was around.\nHe wasn\u2019t so you continued to follow Jungkook. There was a sweet smile on your\nlips as it was the first time that you were going out alone with a guy. To be\nmore specific, with Jungkook.</p><p>\u00a0Within no time you came in contact with the cold evening\natmosphere. You took a deep breath as he leaned against the wall. You joined\nhim and stood by his side leaning against the cold resistance as well. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s\nnot that I didn\u2019t want to dance, dancing is one of my passions\u2026.well, let\u2019s say\nthat I wanted to spend some time with you that\u2019s it.\u201d He said without any\nhesitation while looking at you. You didn\u2019t dare to look back at him after he\nsaid that. You simply looked down and smiled. He noticed that and looked away\nsmiling himself.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cYou\nlook a lot different today actually.\u201d He said and you looked at him with a confused\nlook.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re\nsaying as if you have met me a thousand times before.\u201d You said and chuckled.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cNot\nthousand of course, but yeh a lot of times I have seen you but never got the\nchance to speak.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cOh\nI se-, wait, what?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0He\nlooked at you and raised his eyebrows in a questioning look. \u201cWhat what?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u201cYou\nsaid that you have seen me a lot of times before, but\u2026. you know I think that\nwe both are meeting for the first time.\u201d You said and waited impatiently for\nhis reply. He first looked down and smiled which you thought was the most\nbeautiful thing that you had ever seen in existence.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cThat\nis what YOU think sweetheart, but I have seen you a lot of times before.\u201d You\nblushed at the pet name. But still you were confused. Where did he see you ?\u00a0\u201cWhere\nhave you seen me before then?\u201d\u00a0He\nlicked his lips and smirked at you and then replied, \u201cAll the parties where you\nused to go with Taehyung, you never realized that each one of us used to be\npresent..\u201d\u00a0You\nstared at him. All the parties\u2026.means nearly a 100 parties\u2026.and each one of\nthem used to be present but it was you who never realized their existence? That\nwas too much for you to dissolve at once. You opened your mouth to speak but\ncouldn\u2019t. You did not know from where to begin. What to ask him first. All this\nwhile that he was constantly staring at you he noticed that you required a lot\nmore explanation and that what he said was too less.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cListen,\nyour brother is over-protective and you know that. So, wherever he took you, he\nmade sure that you were always by his side\u2026 he would never leave you alone and\nspeaking of us, he tried his best to keep you away from us lol I don\u2019t know why\u2026.\u201d\u00a0Your\nmouth was still wide open and you waited for him to continue. He was speaking\nflawlessly and all you could see and understand was his lips moving perfectly\nand the words that were slipping out of his mouth without any flaw.</p><p>\u00a0\u201c\u2026..He\nalways warned each one of us to stay away from you and even today before the\nparty he gave us an entire list of instructions of how to behave when you were\naround.\u201d He said and laughed at his own words. after a few minutes when you\nwere finally able to take in and understand what he said, he looked at you and\ncontinued, \u201c\u2026.so, in short words it is just you who thinks that we are meeting\nfor the first time, not me Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0You\nsighed deeply and leaned against the wall. You felt like kicking Taehyung where\nit would hurt him the most. You never imagined that he could do this\u2026.. you\nwere not a 2 year old kid, you were 20!. \u201cShit, I am so sorry\u2026. Taehyung\u2026 you\nknow he is really weird I don\u2019t kn-.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cHey\nit\u2019s ok you know, I mean all of us were kinda used to it.\u201d He said and smiled\nwhile leaning his head against the wall. You did not know for how long you had\nbeen standing there out alone with him. You also did not know if Taehyung was\ninside searching for you. All you knew was that you were enjoying the time that\nyou were spending with him. And nothing else in the world seemed to \u00a0be bothering you in any fucking way.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cOh\u2026.\nmy. There was so much story behind this I never imagined. Well thanks a lot for\nletting me know. And about Taehyung, I\u2019ll take good care of him.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cYou\ndon\u2019t have to thank me you know, in fact it\u2019s me who should be thanking\nyou..,for making this evening enjoyable for me. Thank you Y/N.\u201d You both stared\nat each other for awhile. After which you simply threw your arms around his\nshoulders and hugged him. He at first was shocked and did not dare to move his\nhands. A few moments after finally realizing that everything was going right,\nhe slowly moved his arms around your waist and lifted you up effortlessly. Even\nin the chilly evening, you felt light and warm in his arms. No doubt, his\npresence on your birthday was what made it special.\u00a0After\na few moments you slowly pulled yourself back and smiled softly at him.</p><p>\u00a0Jungkook was still having his hands clinged to your waist. If it wasn\u2019t for his\nmorals, he would have smashed you against the wall and devoured your lips like\na hungry boar. He was aware of the fact that he shouldn\u2019t be crossing his\nlimits. There was a war of impulse and morality in him. His raging impulse was\nwhat finally overcame his awareness of morals.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cFuck it.\u201d He pulled your waist and pressed his lips\nt yours without hesitation. Your eyes widened and at first you felt like\npushing him. You had never done anything which Taehyung did not want you to.\nThen why were you not pushing him away? There was something that was preventing\nyou from doing so. You instead wrapped your arms around his neck closed your\neyes and kissed him back. He pulled you even closer and deepened the kiss while\npushing his tongue past your lips. He gently pushed you against the wall and\nheld your face and continued kissing you with all passion. You subconsciously clutched\nonto his shirt. A thousand thoughts were running inside your head but you did\nnot allow any of those to invade your mind and spoil the beautiful moment that you\nwere sharing with him.</p><p>\u00a0You continued to\nkiss \u00a0and the world fell away. It was\nslow and soft, comforting in ways that words would never be. His hand rested\nbelow your ear, his thumb caressing your cheek as your breaths mingled. You ran\nyour fingers down his spine, pulling him closer until there was no space left\nbetween the two of you and he could feel the beating of your heart against his chest.\nHis mouth was so warm, the caress of his lips softer than you could have\nimagined and you opened your mouth with a low moan. He honestly never\nknew a kiss so innocent could be so intimate and electrifying. Your lips were\nmoving in perfect sync, his hands next feeling your waist; he pulled you\ncloser, the kiss deeper, more passionate. He felt your hands on the back of his\nneck play with the ends of his hair. A smile grew on his face as it started to\ntickle, and finally you pulled apart.</p><p>\u00a0You looked up at\nhim and he was looking down at you. You smiled and pushed your head into his\nchest out of embarrassment.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cYou know what\nJungkook, Taehyung is gonna kill you.\u201dHe chuckled.</p><p>\u00a0It\nfelt as if the kiss was a sign of love, and a sign of a lot more to come. There\nwas nothing which you felt was wrong. And so did he</p><p>.\u201cI am sorry for\nkissing you like that Y/N.\u201d You looked up at him and pecked his lips once more.</p><p>\u201cI like you\nJungkook.\u201d</p><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe\nlooked the other way and laughed a little before looking at you and pecking\nyour lips again.<br/></p><p>\u201cI like you too Y/N.\u201d</p><hr><p>A/N: THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR READING THIS!! THIS WAS MY THIRD JUNGKOOK SCENARIO AND I  M TRYING TO CHANGE MY STYLE OF WRITING A LOT. THANK YOU ALL AGAIN FPR READING THIS LOVE YOU.</p>",

This is the next jungkook scenario which i dont know invaded my mind at around\u2026.. 2 AM in the night lol. This is gonna be a long one and i really hope that you all like this too!\u00a0</p><hr><p>\u201cI wish you a really happy and splendid birthday dear sis.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThank you so so much, I cannot be anymore happier oppa\u2026. thank you for all this. But honestly speaking, so much was not required.\u201d<br></p><p>You refused to leave the warm embrace of your sweet and caring older brother Taehyung. It was your birthday, not like you had been waiting for this day to come. You had planned to spend the day just like any other normal day. Little had you known that Taehyung had this big as fuck birthday bash planned for this day with all of your friends invited( including his). Friends included your college ones, high school ones, primary school ones and the ones who live light years away from your connection. So it was his surprise for you to invite all your friends whom you had not met for quite a long time and make the night a memorable one.</p><p>He chuckled,\u00a0\u201c Hey Y/N, you have been hugging me all day\u2026 well I am not complaining, you usually kick me the entire day, I wish your birthday could come everyday and i would have my pretty little sister hug me like this.\u201d</p><p>You quickly left him and glared at him,\u00a0\u201c Sometimes I feel that I should start behaving nice to you, but then you yourself prove to me how big of an asshole you are.\u201d</p><p>He clutched white fabric of the shirt in front of his chest,\u00a0\u201c Ouch, that was rude.\u201d</p><p>All this while you heard Taehyung\u2019s phone notifying something for like twenty times. You wondered who was so desperate to talk to him,\u00a0\u201cHey oppa, why don\u2019t you reply something to that crazy girlfriend of yours?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung\u2019s eyes widened,\u00a0\u201coh shit!\u201d</p><p>He quickly grabbed his phone and replied to all the messages that he had recieved.\u00a0\u201c You both are crazy.\u201d</p><p>His fingers stopped typing and his head shot towards you. He stared at you for a while. You raised your eyebrows in a questioning look,\u00a0\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head in amusement before saying,\u00a0\u201c You are saying this because you STILL don\u2019t have a fucking boyfriend. And god knows how you are still surviving.\u201d It wasn\u2019t the first time that he made fun of you for not having a boyfriend even when you were 20.</p><p>You rolled your eyes,\u00a0\u201c I don\u2019t need one oppa, staying in a relationship\u2026. doesn\u2019t that suck?\u201d You said, not quite sure of your own words.</p><p>\u201c You mean to say that being in a relat-, having a boyfriend will suck?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOh yes exactly, strange you understood me at once because normally your dumb brain takes half a minute to understand a sentence.\u201d He glared at you and pulled your cheeks hard.\u00a0\u201c I am your fucking brother! How can you talk to me like this?\u201d<br></p><p>You whimpered,\u00a0\u201c AH- ouch! oppa I swear to God if you don\u2019t leave me at this very mom-\u201d. Suddenly his phone rang out out of no where and he left your cheek at once. You rubbed the swollen skin while glaring at him.\u00a0\u201c Asshole.\u201d He seemed to ignore what you said and instead picked up the call hurriedly.</p><p>\u201cOh fuc- shit sorry! hey you wait right there I\u2019ll be there in a minute!\u201d He said nd quickly disconnected the phone.<br></p><p>\u201cAww what happened your girlfriend is furious?? Oh I am so glad that she is.\u201d You said and gave a devilish smile. Before he began running to where he intended to he said,\u00a0\u201c First of all, its not my brain which is dumb, its yours that is, because it always assumes stupid and useless things and makes you speak rubbish and utter nonsense. And second of all, its not my girlfriend, there are some of my friends I had invited waiting near our house who are even more crazier than her. I guess I am a lot more clearer now I hope your poor brain was able to take so much at once, anyways I\u2019ll see you in a while bubye.\u201d<br></p><p>He threw the words at your face and walked away. Your mouth was wide open and your jaws were about to crash the ground. You stamped your leg and kicked disgustedly at the floor,\u00a0\u201c Taehyung you are such an asshole!.\u201d</p><p>You recollected the words that he threw at your face.\u00a0\u201c\u2026..<i>some of my friends I invited</i>\u201d. His friends. You were quite sure that they were none other than the 6 guys of his terrible friend circle and no doubt they were the craziest persons that you had ever met. Actually, heard of. Park Jimin, a total flirt, was the only one with whom you had some sort of a friendly relation. About two other guys that were Hoseok and Yoongi you were not so sure of. You had spoken to Jin and Namjoon a few times.</p><p>\u00a0And\u2026. there was Jeon Jungkook. You had never met him in real and neither did you ever speak to him in person. But he was the one about whom Taehyung would speak of the most. About his looks, his physique, his childish nature, his shy nature. Also that he was the most loved one and had a really beautiful voice. You had began liking him since the day you saw him in a video. It was Hoseok\u2019s birthday bash and Jungkook, as his special present for Hoseok, sang a beautiful song which was indeed your favourite. Next you saw him in one of his dance videos. You were at awe when you saw him dancing, his thighs, his neck, the way his biceps would bulge out each time he did a move was what led you to having some sort of a crush on him.So, you were excited to see him that evening. Out of no where a thought clicked your mind and you rushed to your room.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201c I think I should find something good to wear.\u201d<br></p><hr><p>It was 4 PM and Taehyung was seen running across the house every instant trying to verify that every corner of the house was just the way he wanted it and\u00a0 to be. He had put some of his friends to work and you wondered since when did they began agreeing to him and working according to what he said?</p><p>\u201c Yah Taehyung, we have been helping you for three hours! And you are simply running here and there shouting at us! what the fuck do you think we are som-\u201d. Jimin quickly paused when he saw you quietly standing in one corner and silently observing the party arrangements.\u00a0\u201cOh hey Y/N\u201d</p><p>He said and walked towards you pulling you by your waist into a soft hug.\u00a0\u201cHappy birthday pretty lady.\u201d You face contorted at the cheesy pet name and you pulled yourself out of the hug.\u00a0\u201c Thanks, for wishing and also for the wonderful pet name.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled,\u00a0\u201cWell bab-\u201d He was cut off by Taehyung shouting at him from behind.\u00a0\u201c Park-fucking-Jimin how dare did you tou-, hug my sister without my fucking permission you son of a-!\u201d He shouted as he stormed towards Jimin and punched him in the stomach.</p><p>Jimin stumbled a few steps back and whimpered, \u201c Ouch!!! Yah I helped you in the arrangements and you don\u2019t even let me hug your prett-\u201d He was cut off by another punch in the stomach.\u00a0\u201cNO. Not without my permission I have made myself clear several times before. I want to keep my sister from you assholes understand? So don\u2019t think of trying anything with her when I am not around.\u201d<br></p><p>You looked at Jimin with pity and sighed. It wasn\u2019t new that a guy was either punched or kicked by Taehyung for touching you when he was not around. The concept was Taehyung was a don\u2019t-you-dare-try-coming-close-to-my-sister type brother. A way too protective towards you. Maybe because you were the only one in his life. And so was he in yours. You never had much friends and you were more confined to the warm hugs and love of your brother than to anyone, anything else. He had been taking care of you since you were 7, so all you remember is the hard work he did and the love and care he bestowed upon you for all these years.</p><p>But still you called him an asshole.</p><p>\u201c You always try to keep Y/N away from assholes, then how are you letting her stay with yourself I fail to understand.\u201d Jimin said in a sarcastic voice and in spite of the pain in his stomach giggled a little. You tried to hold in a laughter-<br></p><p>\u201cHey Tae! What\u2019s up buddy?\u201d. A tone not so familiar to you glided against your ears. The three of you turned back to see the newcomer.</p><p>\u201cHey! You three! Hell after how long are we all meeting?\u201d He said and rushed towards and in no time was engaged in bro hugs. Jimin soon joined the other 4. According to your knowledge, they were Hoseok, Jin and Namjoon. Your eyes searched for the remaining two, to be more specific, for Jungkook. There was a slight show of disappointment on your countenance when you unfortunately did not find him in that group.\u00a0</p><p>They turned back at you and began walking, \u201cHey Y/N.\u00a0 We wish you a really happy and splendid birthday dear\u2026 It\u2019s nice to see you after so long you know.\u201d You assumed that it was Hoseok who spoke.<br></p><p>\u201c Thank you so much you all for coming, yeh It\u2019s been really long since you guys have met, I hope that you all enjoy this night.\u201d You said with an affectionate smile.<br></p><p>\u201cHey Jin hyung, where are Suga and the maknae? Not yet here? They are coming right? I swear to god if they don\u2019t come tonight I wil-\u201d He was soon interupted by another voice\u2026.. which WAS familiar to you in a different way. You did not have to turn back to see and make sure who it was, the moment you heard the voice you knew,<i>\u00a0\u201c\u2026..he\u2019s here, OMG.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cHey hyung.\u201d<br></p><p>Everyone there turned back, and so did you, trying hard not to get nervous or feel shy and then the situation would turn awkward because it was the first time that you met him. Your eyes were the first to meet his, and for the first time. He looked at you for a awhile and your heart was beating rapidly. He smiled at you and that was when you felt that you were going to lose your senses right then and there.</p><p>\u201cHey Kook, Suga hyung, nice to see you both after so long.\u201d Taehyung said and was engaged in bro hugs for the second time,<br></p><p>\u201cHey Y/N, I guess that I am meeting you for the first time, anyways I wish you a really happy birthday, please enjoy.\u201d It was Suga who spoke this time. You returned his greetings with a smile,\u00a0\u201cThank you oppa, I am glad that you came, you too please enjoy the night.\u201d<br></p><p>He smiled and went to get himself engaged in bro hugs with the other guys. And that was when only one person was left. Jungkook. Your eyes met his for the second time and you felt that the charm in his eyes doubled. He shyly walked towards you,\u00a0\u201cHey\u2026. Happy birthday Y/N.\u201d He said with a pleasing tone and extended his right hand towards you. You gladly accepted it with a pink blush on your cheeks.</p><p>\u201cThank you Jungkook oppa.\u201d He was about to say something when Taehyung interrupted the two of you. You cursed him a thousand for doing that.<br></p><p>\u201cHey! Fucking come and help me with the preparations kook! I am not going to leave you guys just like that!\u201d He said and gave a devilish smile.<br></p><p>\u201cYes, we would love to help you out Taehyung.\u201d Jin said and the others seemd to agree. You looked at Jungkook and he seemed to be saying something to Taehyung which you failed to understand. After a few moments everyone left for work and so did Tae, to guide and instruct them. You watched him walk away and then looked back at Jungkook.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019d like to talk to you for sometime Y/N.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>You were first shocked after hearing him a say that but then nodded shyly.\u00a0\u201cYes sure oppa.\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head and suddenly pushed you to one side. You first jumped due to to his sudden action and widened your eyes. He did not look at you but was looking back. You moved your head to one side and saw that some of the workers were trying to move a chandelier and you guys were blocking the way. He kept you in front of him and they carried away the chandelier from behind his back.</p><p>Such a gentleman.</p><p>After they were gone he looked at you. His face was close and you were sure that he could feel the heat that was coming from your face.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t call me oppa please, it\u2019s weird you know, for me.\u201d He said and smiled which was more like smirk. You stared at him for a while and then nodded shyly, blushing at the fact that he wanted you to call him just by his name. He did not move back but was staring back down at you. If you had stayed there for a little while longer then you were sure to faint right then and there.</p><p>\u201cUmm, the workers are gone.\u201d He was snapped back to reality. He looked back to ensure that they were actually gone and got back to his original position at once.\u201dI should be distant from you before your brother kills me.\u201d He said and looked around to see if Taehyung was around. Fortunately, he wasn\u2019t. You guys did not know that someone else, not Taehyung, was there who witnessed the enttre thing that happened just a few minutes ago.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being a real gentleman today kid?\u201d You heard jimin say somewhere from behind the man standing in front of you. Jungkook sighed and turned back,\u00a0\u201cFirst, I am always a gentleman to those who are worthy of it.\u201d<br></p><p>Jimin glared at Jungkook,\u00a0\u201cSo you mean ti say that we all are not wor-\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd secondly, I am not the kid here today, there\u2019s someone younger than me present here.\u201d He said and slowly turned his head towards you with a smal smug on his lips. Your cheeks heated up and you looked down as if you did not understand a single thing.<br></p><p><i>\u201cOh\u2026\u2026right.\u201d </i>Was all that went through your head at that moment<i>.</i><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2026umm, It\u2019s over\u00a0 5 PM already, I think ya\u2019ll should get ready right? Umm, Taehyung will be around here please approach him he will guide you guys where to go.. bubye!.\u201d You said and immediately rushed from that place. Jungkook and jimin chuckled in amusement.</p><p>\u201cHey\u2026I hope you know that if Taehyung gets even a faint idea of what you are trying to do he is gonna bury you alive kook.\u201d Jimin said while putting his arms around his shoulders.<br></p><p>Jungkook simply smiled and looked at the way in which you ran away.</p><hr><p>It was 6:30 PM already and you were still standing in front of your mirror judging the way you looked with your only close friend Lisa and Taehyung standing behind you with arms crossed in front of their chests. You looked at him and then at her with the same question in your eyes.</p><p>\u201cHey guys, do I look good?\u201d<br></p><p>Lisa was tired of giving the same answer and simply gave you a disgusted look while Taehyung laughed a little and looked the other way and then back at you,\u00a0\u201cYes Y/N, you are looking beautiful as always, now stop being so nervous else that will cover the charm of your original countenance.\u201d</p><p>Lisa nodded,\u00a0\u201cYes he is right Y/N, now I swear to god if you ask us the same question again I will leave, come on now everyone is waiting!\u201d</p><p>Still not sure whether the way you looked was good or not, you walked away and sighed when you heard Taehyung close the door behind you.</p><p><i>\u201cThere\u2019s no going back now\u2026\u2026\u201d</i><br></p><p>You guys entered the main ahll and all you could see was not less than a 100 guests out of which you could barely recognize anyone. You looked around and searched for <i>him.</i>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey Y/N.\u201d You heard a voice behind you and turned to see Jin\u00a0 with a few gifts in there hands. Your eyes widened and you smiled at them.<br></p><p>\u201cHey you guys\u2026.look great!\u201d You said and they giggled.<br></p><p>\u201cYou too look\nbeautiful Y/N. And here, take these, since we did not know anything in\nparticular that you liked, we bought one out of anything that we found, please accept\nour gifts and one again we wish you a really Happy Birthday dear. This is your\nday please enjoy.\u201d Namjoon said in the most affectionate voice possible and all\nthe others smiled at you.</p><p>\u00a0 <i>\u201cHell they all are so nice why didn\u2019t I talk to them before?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cWell\nit was me who invited you guys here and there is still not a single thanks to\nme.\u201d Taehyung sneered and you chuckled. The others also did the same and yoiur\neyes were still trading the entire hall searching for Jungkook. After a few\nminutes of chatting you saw Jimin entering the hall. You watched more closely\nto see if Jungkook would enter next.\u00a0And\nhe did.\u00a0He\nwas wearing and light blue shirt with sleeves folded up till his elbow hanging\nloose above his black pants. Hair was perfectly smooth and settled with shoes.\nYou stared at him for a few minutes and did not realize when they walked all\nthe way up till where you guys were standing.</p><p>\u00a0He looked at you a smiled.\u00a0\u201cHey\nY/N, Happy birthday again, look I have got this dress for you, hope you like\nit.\u201d Jimin said and extended the gift towards you. You took it and smiled, \u201cThank\nyou so much oppa, I am sure that the dress will be just perfect.\u201dHe smiled and\nagain, bro hugs with the others. Now that again left you with one person.</p><p>\u00a0Jungkook.\nYou looked at him and he walked towards you in the same way that he did that\nafternoon.\u00a0\u201cHey\nY/N, I am not sure whether you would like what I have got but\u2026.you know, since\nI was the last one to come here this was the maximum which I could get, Happy\nbirthday, please accept this.\u201d You saw that it was a\u2026..CD? You opened the\nholder and saw that one was inside it. You smiled in amusement and looked at\nhim, \u201cHey Jungkook, what is this?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0He\nsmiled a little and said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s some of the songs. I thought that this\nwas the best thing which I could give you so\u2026\u201d Your eyes widened. You giggled\nand jumped a little. Honestly, that was the best gift which you could have.\u00a0\u201cThank\nyou so much Jungkook! Th- This is lovely I love it!\u201d You said and chuckled. He\nfirst stared at you and then laughed a little completely shocked to see you so\nhappy with that simple gift. He at the least expected you to even open it.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cGuys,\nya\u2019ll wanna dance?\u201d You heard Taehyung say as he slipped his hands around you waists\nand pulled you close to his side and kissed your temples. You smiled at him and\nshowed him the CD which Jungkook gave you. Taehyung first stared at the CD and\nthen smiled a little and ruffled your hair. You smacked his hand away and tried\nto settle your hair again.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cOh\nyeaahhhhhh I don\u2019t know about anyone else but me and Jimin are in! Anyone else\nwanna join can follow us!\u201d Hoseok exclaimed and dragged Jimin away with him to\nthe centre of the hall room where everyone was dancing.\u00a0\u201cHey\npunk wait we will be joining too!\u201d Jin, Namjoon and yoongi ran behind them.\nTaehyung looked at you and raised his eyebrows. You shook your head.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cUmm,\nhey hyung, I am not in a mood to dance so I\u2019ll be staying back.\u201d Jungkook said\nwhile inserting his palms into his pockets and looking at the dance floor.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cWell,\nthat\u2019s strange, but ok as you wish. Come Y/N.\u201d Taehyung said while pulling your\nwaist along with him to join the dance floor but you pulled back.\u00a0\u201cOppa,\nI am not in a mood to dance too.\u201d You said pouted.</p><p>\u00a0Taehyung eyed you and Jungkook\nfor a few times, \u201cHave you both planned this or something?\u201d You widened your\neyes and shook your hands while Jungkook shook his head for 10 times.\u00a0After\nstaring at the two of you for a few moments Taehyung sighed, \u201cWell, ok then.\u201d You\nsmiled and looked at Jungkook who was already smiling at you.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cBut I will be\nleaving, and kook, don\u2019t try ANYTHING with her just because I am leaving her\nalone with you, understood?\u201d Taehyung said with a firm face while Jungkook nodded\nmost obediently. Taehyung smiled at you for the last time and walked away.\u00a0Your\nheart was beating fast within your chest as it was the first time that you were\nleft alone with him.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cYou really don\u2019t want to dance?\u201d He asked.\u00a0\u201cUmm,\nyeh I.. am not really a party-friendly person Jungkook, but looks like you all\nare, why didn\u2019t you go to dance?\u201d You asked him and he smiled. He came a bit\ncloser to you and whispered in your ear, \u201cDo you want to\u2026.you know, go to a\nmore quieter place?\u201d\u00a0You\nlooked up at him and he was biting his lower lip and his eyes pleaded for your\nyes. You smiled and before you could say yes he held your wrist and pulled you\nwith him. You looked back for the final time to check if Taehyung was around.\nHe wasn\u2019t so you continued to follow Jungkook. There was a sweet smile on your\nlips as it was the first time that you were going out alone with a guy. To be\nmore specific, with Jungkook.</p><p>\u00a0Within no time you came in contact with the cold evening\natmosphere. You took a deep breath as he leaned against the wall. You joined\nhim and stood by his side leaning against the cold resistance as well. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s\nnot that I didn\u2019t want to dance, dancing is one of my passions\u2026.well, let\u2019s say\nthat I wanted to spend some time with you that\u2019s it.\u201d He said without any\nhesitation while looking at you. You didn\u2019t dare to look back at him after he\nsaid that. You simply looked down and smiled. He noticed that and looked away\nsmiling himself.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cYou\nlook a lot different today actually.\u201d He said and you looked at him with a confused\nlook.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re\nsaying as if you have met me a thousand times before.\u201d You said and chuckled.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cNot\nthousand of course, but yeh a lot of times I have seen you but never got the\nchance to speak.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cOh\nI se-, wait, what?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0He\nlooked at you and raised his eyebrows in a questioning look. \u201cWhat what?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u201cYou\nsaid that you have seen me a lot of times before, but\u2026. you know I think that\nwe both are meeting for the first time.\u201d You said and waited impatiently for\nhis reply. He first looked down and smiled which you thought was the most\nbeautiful thing that you had ever seen in existence.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cThat\nis what YOU think sweetheart, but I have seen you a lot of times before.\u201d You\nblushed at the pet name. But still you were confused. Where did he see you ?\u00a0\u201cWhere\nhave you seen me before then?\u201d\u00a0He\nlicked his lips and smirked at you and then replied, \u201cAll the parties where you\nused to go with Taehyung, you never realized that each one of us used to be\npresent..\u201d\u00a0You\nstared at him. All the parties\u2026.means nearly a 100 parties\u2026.and each one of\nthem used to be present but it was you who never realized their existence? That\nwas too much for you to dissolve at once. You opened your mouth to speak but\ncouldn\u2019t. You did not know from where to begin. What to ask him first. All this\nwhile that he was constantly staring at you he noticed that you required a lot\nmore explanation and that what he said was too less.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cListen,\nyour brother is over-protective and you know that. So, wherever he took you, he\nmade sure that you were always by his side\u2026 he would never leave you alone and\nspeaking of us, he tried his best to keep you away from us lol I don\u2019t know why\u2026.\u201d\u00a0Your\nmouth was still wide open and you waited for him to continue. He was speaking\nflawlessly and all you could see and understand was his lips moving perfectly\nand the words that were slipping out of his mouth without any flaw.</p><p>\u00a0\u201c\u2026..He\nalways warned each one of us to stay away from you and even today before the\nparty he gave us an entire list of instructions of how to behave when you were\naround.\u201d He said and laughed at his own words. after a few minutes when you\nwere finally able to take in and understand what he said, he looked at you and\ncontinued, \u201c\u2026.so, in short words it is just you who thinks that we are meeting\nfor the first time, not me Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0You\nsighed deeply and leaned against the wall. You felt like kicking Taehyung where\nit would hurt him the most. You never imagined that he could do this\u2026.. you\nwere not a 2 year old kid, you were 20!. \u201cShit, I am so sorry\u2026. Taehyung\u2026 you\nknow he is really weird I don\u2019t kn-.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cHey\nit\u2019s ok you know, I mean all of us were kinda used to it.\u201d He said and smiled\nwhile leaning his head against the wall. You did not know for how long you had\nbeen standing there out alone with him. You also did not know if Taehyung was\ninside searching for you. All you knew was that you were enjoying the time that\nyou were spending with him. And nothing else in the world seemed to \u00a0be bothering you in any fucking way.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cOh\u2026.\nmy. There was so much story behind this I never imagined. Well thanks a lot for\nletting me know. And about Taehyung, I\u2019ll take good care of him.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cYou\ndon\u2019t have to thank me you know, in fact it\u2019s me who should be thanking\nyou..,for making this evening enjoyable for me. Thank you Y/N.\u201d You both stared\nat each other for awhile. After which you simply threw your arms around his\nshoulders and hugged him. He at first was shocked and did not dare to move his\nhands. A few moments after finally realizing that everything was going right,\nhe slowly moved his arms around your waist and lifted you up effortlessly. Even\nin the chilly evening, you felt light and warm in his arms. No doubt, his\npresence on your birthday was what made it special.\u00a0After\na few moments you slowly pulled yourself back and smiled softly at him.</p><p>\u00a0Jungkook was still having his hands clinged to your waist. If it wasn\u2019t for his\nmorals, he would have smashed you against the wall and devoured your lips like\na hungry boar. He was aware of the fact that he shouldn\u2019t be crossing his\nlimits. There was a war of impulse and morality in him. His raging impulse was\nwhat finally overcame his awareness of morals.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cFuck it.\u201d He pulled your waist and pressed his lips\nt yours without hesitation. Your eyes widened and at first you felt like\npushing him. You had never done anything which Taehyung did not want you to.\nThen why were you not pushing him away? There was something that was preventing\nyou from doing so. You instead wrapped your arms around his neck closed your\neyes and kissed him back. He pulled you even closer and deepened the kiss while\npushing his tongue past your lips. He gently pushed you against the wall and\nheld your face and continued kissing you with all passion. You subconsciously clutched\nonto his shirt. A thousand thoughts were running inside your head but you did\nnot allow any of those to invade your mind and spoil the beautiful moment that you\nwere sharing with him.</p><p>\u00a0You continued to\nkiss \u00a0and the world fell away. It was\nslow and soft, comforting in ways that words would never be. His hand rested\nbelow your ear, his thumb caressing your cheek as your breaths mingled. You ran\nyour fingers down his spine, pulling him closer until there was no space left\nbetween the two of you and he could feel the beating of your heart against his chest.\nHis mouth was so warm, the caress of his lips softer than you could have\nimagined and you opened your mouth with a low moan. He honestly never\nknew a kiss so innocent could be so intimate and electrifying. Your lips were\nmoving in perfect sync, his hands next feeling your waist; he pulled you\ncloser, the kiss deeper, more passionate. He felt your hands on the back of his\nneck play with the ends of his hair. A smile grew on his face as it started to\ntickle, and finally you pulled apart.</p><p>\u00a0You looked up at\nhim and he was looking down at you. You smiled and pushed your head into his\nchest out of embarrassment.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cYou know what\nJungkook, Taehyung is gonna kill you.\u201dHe chuckled.</p><p>\u00a0It\nfelt as if the kiss was a sign of love, and a sign of a lot more to come. There\nwas nothing which you felt was wrong. And so did he</p><p>.\u201cI am sorry for\nkissing you like that Y/N.\u201d You looked up at him and pecked his lips once more.</p><p>\u201cI like you\nJungkook.\u201d</p><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe\nlooked the other way and laughed a little before looking at you and pecking\nyour lips again.<br></p><p>\u201cI like you too Y/N.\u201d</p><hr><p>A/N: THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR READING THIS!! THIS WAS MY THIRD JUNGKOOK SCENARIO AND I  M TRYING TO CHANGE MY STYLE OF WRITING A LOT. THANK YOU ALL AGAIN FPR READING THIS LOVE YOU.</p></p>",

This is the next jungkook scenario which i dont know invaded my mind at around\u2026.. 2 AM in the night lol. This is gonna be a long one and i really hope that you all like this too!\u00a0</p><hr><p>\u201cI wish you a really happy and splendid birthday dear sis.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThank you so so much, I cannot be anymore happier oppa\u2026. thank you for all this. But honestly speaking, so much was not required.\u201d<br></p><p>You refused to leave the warm embrace of your sweet and caring older brother Taehyung. It was your birthday, not like you had been waiting for this day to come. You had planned to spend the day just like any other normal day. Little had you known that Taehyung had this big as fuck birthday bash planned for this day with all of your friends invited( including his). Friends included your college ones, high school ones, primary school ones and the ones who live light years away from your connection. So it was his surprise for you to invite all your friends whom you had not met for quite a long time and make the night a memorable one.</p><p>He chuckled,\u00a0\u201c Hey Y/N, you have been hugging me all day\u2026 well I am not complaining, you usually kick me the entire day, I wish your birthday could come everyday and i would have my pretty little sister hug me like this.\u201d</p><p>You quickly left him and glared at him,\u00a0\u201c Sometimes I feel that I should start behaving nice to you, but then you yourself prove to me how big of an asshole you are.\u201d</p><p>He clutched white fabric of the shirt in front of his chest,\u00a0\u201c Ouch, that was rude.\u201d</p><p>All this while you heard Taehyung\u2019s phone notifying something for like twenty times. You wondered who was so desperate to talk to him,\u00a0\u201cHey oppa, why don\u2019t you reply something to that crazy girlfriend of yours?\u201d</p><p>Taehyung\u2019s eyes widened,\u00a0\u201coh shit!\u201d</p><p>He quickly grabbed his phone and replied to all the messages that he had recieved.\u00a0\u201c You both are crazy.\u201d</p><p>His fingers stopped typing and his head shot towards you. He stared at you for a while. You raised your eyebrows in a questioning look,\u00a0\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head in amusement before saying,\u00a0\u201c You are saying this because you STILL don\u2019t have a fucking boyfriend. And god knows how you are still surviving.\u201d It wasn\u2019t the first time that he made fun of you for not having a boyfriend even when you were 20.</p><p>You rolled your eyes,\u00a0\u201c I don\u2019t need one oppa, staying in a relationship\u2026. doesn\u2019t that suck?\u201d You said, not quite sure of your own words.</p><p>\u201c You mean to say that being in a relat-, having a boyfriend will suck?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOh yes exactly, strange you understood me at once because normally your dumb brain takes half a minute to understand a sentence.\u201d He glared at you and pulled your cheeks hard.\u00a0\u201c I am your fucking brother! How can you talk to me like this?\u201d<br></p><p>You whimpered,\u00a0\u201c AH- ouch! oppa I swear to God if you don\u2019t leave me at this very mom-\u201d. Suddenly his phone rang out out of no where and he left your cheek at once. You rubbed the swollen skin while glaring at him.\u00a0\u201c Asshole.\u201d He seemed to ignore what you said and instead picked up the call hurriedly.</p><p>\u201cOh fuc- shit sorry! hey you wait right there I\u2019ll be there in a minute!\u201d He said nd quickly disconnected the phone.<br></p><p>\u201cAww what happened your girlfriend is furious?? Oh I am so glad that she is.\u201d You said and gave a devilish smile. Before he began running to where he intended to he said,\u00a0\u201c First of all, its not my brain which is dumb, its yours that is, because it always assumes stupid and useless things and makes you speak rubbish and utter nonsense. And second of all, its not my girlfriend, there are some of my friends I had invited waiting near our house who are even more crazier than her. I guess I am a lot more clearer now I hope your poor brain was able to take so much at once, anyways I\u2019ll see you in a while bubye.\u201d<br></p><p>He threw the words at your face and walked away. Your mouth was wide open and your jaws were about to crash the ground. You stamped your leg and kicked disgustedly at the floor,\u00a0\u201c Taehyung you are such an asshole!.\u201d</p><p>You recollected the words that he threw at your face.\u00a0\u201c\u2026..<i>some of my friends I invited</i>\u201d. His friends. You were quite sure that they were none other than the 6 guys of his terrible friend circle and no doubt they were the craziest persons that you had ever met. Actually, heard of. Park Jimin, a total flirt, was the only one with whom you had some sort of a friendly relation. About two other guys that were Hoseok and Yoongi you were not so sure of. You had spoken to Jin and Namjoon a few times.</p><p>\u00a0And\u2026. there was Jeon Jungkook. You had never met him in real and neither did you ever speak to him in person. But he was the one about whom Taehyung would speak of the most. About his looks, his physique, his childish nature, his shy nature. Also that he was the most loved one and had a really beautiful voice. You had began liking him since the day you saw him in a video. It was Hoseok\u2019s birthday bash and Jungkook, as his special present for Hoseok, sang a beautiful song which was indeed your favourite. Next you saw him in one of his dance videos. You were at awe when you saw him dancing, his thighs, his neck, the way his biceps would bulge out each time he did a move was what led you to having some sort of a crush on him.So, you were excited to see him that evening. Out of no where a thought clicked your mind and you rushed to your room.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201c I think I should find something good to wear.\u201d<br></p><hr><p>It was 4 PM and Taehyung was seen running across the house every instant trying to verify that every corner of the house was just the way he wanted it and\u00a0 to be. He had put some of his friends to work and you wondered since when did they began agreeing to him and working according to what he said?</p><p>\u201c Yah Taehyung, we have been helping you for three hours! And you are simply running here and there shouting at us! what the fuck do you think we are som-\u201d. Jimin quickly paused when he saw you quietly standing in one corner and silently observing the party arrangements.\u00a0\u201cOh hey Y/N\u201d</p><p>He said and walked towards you pulling you by your waist into a soft hug.\u00a0\u201cHappy birthday pretty lady.\u201d You face contorted at the cheesy pet name and you pulled yourself out of the hug.\u00a0\u201c Thanks, for wishing and also for the wonderful pet name.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled,\u00a0\u201cWell bab-\u201d He was cut off by Taehyung shouting at him from behind.\u00a0\u201c Park-fucking-Jimin how dare did you tou-, hug my sister without my fucking permission you son of a-!\u201d He shouted as he stormed towards Jimin and punched him in the stomach.</p><p>Jimin stumbled a few steps back and whimpered, \u201c Ouch!!! Yah I helped you in the arrangements and you don\u2019t even let me hug your prett-\u201d He was cut off by another punch in the stomach.\u00a0\u201cNO. Not without my permission I have made myself clear several times before. I want to keep my sister from you assholes understand? So don\u2019t think of trying anything with her when I am not around.\u201d<br></p><p>You looked at Jimin with pity and sighed. It wasn\u2019t new that a guy was either punched or kicked by Taehyung for touching you when he was not around. The concept was Taehyung was a don\u2019t-you-dare-try-coming-close-to-my-sister type brother. A way too protective towards you. Maybe because you were the only one in his life. And so was he in yours. You never had much friends and you were more confined to the warm hugs and love of your brother than to anyone, anything else. He had been taking care of you since you were 7, so all you remember is the hard work he did and the love and care he bestowed upon you for all these years.</p><p>But still you called him an asshole.</p><p>\u201c You always try to keep Y/N away from assholes, then how are you letting her stay with yourself I fail to understand.\u201d Jimin said in a sarcastic voice and in spite of the pain in his stomach giggled a little. You tried to hold in a laughter-<br></p><p>\u201cHey Tae! What\u2019s up buddy?\u201d. A tone not so familiar to you glided against your ears. The three of you turned back to see the newcomer.</p><p>\u201cHey! You three! Hell after how long are we all meeting?\u201d He said and rushed towards and in no time was engaged in bro hugs. Jimin soon joined the other 4. According to your knowledge, they were Hoseok, Jin and Namjoon. Your eyes searched for the remaining two, to be more specific, for Jungkook. There was a slight show of disappointment on your countenance when you unfortunately did not find him in that group.\u00a0</p><p>They turned back at you and began walking, \u201cHey Y/N.\u00a0 We wish you a really happy and splendid birthday dear\u2026 It\u2019s nice to see you after so long you know.\u201d You assumed that it was Hoseok who spoke.<br></p><p>\u201c Thank you so much you all for coming, yeh It\u2019s been really long since you guys have met, I hope that you all enjoy this night.\u201d You said with an affectionate smile.<br></p><p>\u201cHey Jin hyung, where are Suga and the maknae? Not yet here? They are coming right? I swear to god if they don\u2019t come tonight I wil-\u201d He was soon interupted by another voice\u2026.. which WAS familiar to you in a different way. You did not have to turn back to see and make sure who it was, the moment you heard the voice you knew,<i>\u00a0\u201c\u2026..he\u2019s here, OMG.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cHey hyung.\u201d<br></p><p>Everyone there turned back, and so did you, trying hard not to get nervous or feel shy and then the situation would turn awkward because it was the first time that you met him. Your eyes were the first to meet his, and for the first time. He looked at you for a awhile and your heart was beating rapidly. He smiled at you and that was when you felt that you were going to lose your senses right then and there.</p><p>\u201cHey Kook, Suga hyung, nice to see you both after so long.\u201d Taehyung said and was engaged in bro hugs for the second time,<br></p><p>\u201cHey Y/N, I guess that I am meeting you for the first time, anyways I wish you a really happy birthday, please enjoy.\u201d It was Suga who spoke this time. You returned his greetings with a smile,\u00a0\u201cThank you oppa, I am glad that you came, you too please enjoy the night.\u201d<br></p><p>He smiled and went to get himself engaged in bro hugs with the other guys. And that was when only one person was left. Jungkook. Your eyes met his for the second time and you felt that the charm in his eyes doubled. He shyly walked towards you,\u00a0\u201cHey\u2026. Happy birthday Y/N.\u201d He said with a pleasing tone and extended his right hand towards you. You gladly accepted it with a pink blush on your cheeks.</p><p>\u201cThank you Jungkook oppa.\u201d He was about to say something when Taehyung interrupted the two of you. You cursed him a thousand for doing that.<br></p><p>\u201cHey! Fucking come and help me with the preparations kook! I am not going to leave you guys just like that!\u201d He said and gave a devilish smile.<br></p><p>\u201cYes, we would love to help you out Taehyung.\u201d Jin said and the others seemd to agree. You looked at Jungkook and he seemed to be saying something to Taehyung which you failed to understand. After a few moments everyone left for work and so did Tae, to guide and instruct them. You watched him walk away and then looked back at Jungkook.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019d like to talk to you for sometime Y/N.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>You were first shocked after hearing him a say that but then nodded shyly.\u00a0\u201cYes sure oppa.\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head and suddenly pushed you to one side. You first jumped due to to his sudden action and widened your eyes. He did not look at you but was looking back. You moved your head to one side and saw that some of the workers were trying to move a chandelier and you guys were blocking the way. He kept you in front of him and they carried away the chandelier from behind his back.</p><p>Such a gentleman.</p><p>After they were gone he looked at you. His face was close and you were sure that he could feel the heat that was coming from your face.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t call me oppa please, it\u2019s weird you know, for me.\u201d He said and smiled which was more like smirk. You stared at him for a while and then nodded shyly, blushing at the fact that he wanted you to call him just by his name. He did not move back but was staring back down at you. If you had stayed there for a little while longer then you were sure to faint right then and there.</p><p>\u201cUmm, the workers are gone.\u201d He was snapped back to reality. He looked back to ensure that they were actually gone and got back to his original position at once.\u201dI should be distant from you before your brother kills me.\u201d He said and looked around to see if Taehyung was around. Fortunately, he wasn\u2019t. You guys did not know that someone else, not Taehyung, was there who witnessed the enttre thing that happened just a few minutes ago.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being a real gentleman today kid?\u201d You heard jimin say somewhere from behind the man standing in front of you. Jungkook sighed and turned back,\u00a0\u201cFirst, I am always a gentleman to those who are worthy of it.\u201d<br></p><p>Jimin glared at Jungkook,\u00a0\u201cSo you mean ti say that we all are not wor-\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd secondly, I am not the kid here today, there\u2019s someone younger than me present here.\u201d He said and slowly turned his head towards you with a smal smug on his lips. Your cheeks heated up and you looked down as if you did not understand a single thing.<br></p><p><i>\u201cOh\u2026\u2026right.\u201d </i>Was all that went through your head at that moment<i>.</i><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2026umm, It\u2019s over\u00a0 5 PM already, I think ya\u2019ll should get ready right? Umm, Taehyung will be around here please approach him he will guide you guys where to go.. bubye!.\u201d You said and immediately rushed from that place. Jungkook and jimin chuckled in amusement.</p><p>\u201cHey\u2026I hope you know that if Taehyung gets even a faint idea of what you are trying to do he is gonna bury you alive kook.\u201d Jimin said while putting his arms around his shoulders.<br></p><p>Jungkook simply smiled and looked at the way in which you ran away.</p><hr><p>It was 6:30 PM already and you were still standing in front of your mirror judging the way you looked with your only close friend Lisa and Taehyung standing behind you with arms crossed in front of their chests. You looked at him and then at her with the same question in your eyes.</p><p>\u201cHey guys, do I look good?\u201d<br></p><p>Lisa was tired of giving the same answer and simply gave you a disgusted look while Taehyung laughed a little and looked the other way and then back at you,\u00a0\u201cYes Y/N, you are looking beautiful as always, now stop being so nervous else that will cover the charm of your original countenance.\u201d</p><p>Lisa nodded,\u00a0\u201cYes he is right Y/N, now I swear to god if you ask us the same question again I will leave, come on now everyone is waiting!\u201d</p><p>Still not sure whether the way you looked was good or not, you walked away and sighed when you heard Taehyung close the door behind you.</p><p><i>\u201cThere\u2019s no going back now\u2026\u2026\u201d</i><br></p><p>You guys entered the main ahll and all you could see was not less than a 100 guests out of which you could barely recognize anyone. You looked around and searched for <i>him.</i>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey Y/N.\u201d You heard a voice behind you and turned to see Jin\u00a0 with a few gifts in there hands. Your eyes widened and you smiled at them.<br></p><p>\u201cHey you guys\u2026.look great!\u201d You said and they giggled.<br></p><p>\u201cYou too look\nbeautiful Y/N. And here, take these, since we did not know anything in\nparticular that you liked, we bought one out of anything that we found, please accept\nour gifts and one again we wish you a really Happy Birthday dear. This is your\nday please enjoy.\u201d Namjoon said in the most affectionate voice possible and all\nthe others smiled at you.</p><p>\u00a0 <i>\u201cHell they all are so nice why didn\u2019t I talk to them before?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cWell\nit was me who invited you guys here and there is still not a single thanks to\nme.\u201d Taehyung sneered and you chuckled. The others also did the same and yoiur\neyes were still trading the entire hall searching for Jungkook. After a few\nminutes of chatting you saw Jimin entering the hall. You watched more closely\nto see if Jungkook would enter next.\u00a0And\nhe did.\u00a0He\nwas wearing and light blue shirt with sleeves folded up till his elbow hanging\nloose above his black pants. Hair was perfectly smooth and settled with shoes.\nYou stared at him for a few minutes and did not realize when they walked all\nthe way up till where you guys were standing.</p><p>\u00a0He looked at you a smiled.\u00a0\u201cHey\nY/N, Happy birthday again, look I have got this dress for you, hope you like\nit.\u201d Jimin said and extended the gift towards you. You took it and smiled, \u201cThank\nyou so much oppa, I am sure that the dress will be just perfect.\u201dHe smiled and\nagain, bro hugs with the others. Now that again left you with one person.</p><p>\u00a0Jungkook.\nYou looked at him and he walked towards you in the same way that he did that\nafternoon.\u00a0\u201cHey\nY/N, I am not sure whether you would like what I have got but\u2026.you know, since\nI was the last one to come here this was the maximum which I could get, Happy\nbirthday, please accept this.\u201d You saw that it was a\u2026..CD? You opened the\nholder and saw that one was inside it. You smiled in amusement and looked at\nhim, \u201cHey Jungkook, what is this?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0He\nsmiled a little and said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s some of the songs. I thought that this\nwas the best thing which I could give you so\u2026\u201d Your eyes widened. You giggled\nand jumped a little. Honestly, that was the best gift which you could have.\u00a0\u201cThank\nyou so much Jungkook! Th- This is lovely I love it!\u201d You said and chuckled. He\nfirst stared at you and then laughed a little completely shocked to see you so\nhappy with that simple gift. He at the least expected you to even open it.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cGuys,\nya\u2019ll wanna dance?\u201d You heard Taehyung say as he slipped his hands around you waists\nand pulled you close to his side and kissed your temples. You smiled at him and\nshowed him the CD which Jungkook gave you. Taehyung first stared at the CD and\nthen smiled a little and ruffled your hair. You smacked his hand away and tried\nto settle your hair again.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cOh\nyeaahhhhhh I don\u2019t know about anyone else but me and Jimin are in! Anyone else\nwanna join can follow us!\u201d Hoseok exclaimed and dragged Jimin away with him to\nthe centre of the hall room where everyone was dancing.\u00a0\u201cHey\npunk wait we will be joining too!\u201d Jin, Namjoon and yoongi ran behind them.\nTaehyung looked at you and raised his eyebrows. You shook your head.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cUmm,\nhey hyung, I am not in a mood to dance so I\u2019ll be staying back.\u201d Jungkook said\nwhile inserting his palms into his pockets and looking at the dance floor.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cWell,\nthat\u2019s strange, but ok as you wish. Come Y/N.\u201d Taehyung said while pulling your\nwaist along with him to join the dance floor but you pulled back.\u00a0\u201cOppa,\nI am not in a mood to dance too.\u201d You said pouted.</p><p>\u00a0Taehyung eyed you and Jungkook\nfor a few times, \u201cHave you both planned this or something?\u201d You widened your\neyes and shook your hands while Jungkook shook his head for 10 times.\u00a0After\nstaring at the two of you for a few moments Taehyung sighed, \u201cWell, ok then.\u201d You\nsmiled and looked at Jungkook who was already smiling at you.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cBut I will be\nleaving, and kook, don\u2019t try ANYTHING with her just because I am leaving her\nalone with you, understood?\u201d Taehyung said with a firm face while Jungkook nodded\nmost obediently. Taehyung smiled at you for the last time and walked away.\u00a0Your\nheart was beating fast within your chest as it was the first time that you were\nleft alone with him.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cYou really don\u2019t want to dance?\u201d He asked.\u00a0\u201cUmm,\nyeh I.. am not really a party-friendly person Jungkook, but looks like you all\nare, why didn\u2019t you go to dance?\u201d You asked him and he smiled. He came a bit\ncloser to you and whispered in your ear, \u201cDo you want to\u2026.you know, go to a\nmore quieter place?\u201d\u00a0You\nlooked up at him and he was biting his lower lip and his eyes pleaded for your\nyes. You smiled and before you could say yes he held your wrist and pulled you\nwith him. You looked back for the final time to check if Taehyung was around.\nHe wasn\u2019t so you continued to follow Jungkook. There was a sweet smile on your\nlips as it was the first time that you were going out alone with a guy. To be\nmore specific, with Jungkook.</p><p>\u00a0Within no time you came in contact with the cold evening\natmosphere. You took a deep breath as he leaned against the wall. You joined\nhim and stood by his side leaning against the cold resistance as well. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s\nnot that I didn\u2019t want to dance, dancing is one of my passions\u2026.well, let\u2019s say\nthat I wanted to spend some time with you that\u2019s it.\u201d He said without any\nhesitation while looking at you. You didn\u2019t dare to look back at him after he\nsaid that. You simply looked down and smiled. He noticed that and looked away\nsmiling himself.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cYou\nlook a lot different today actually.\u201d He said and you looked at him with a confused\nlook.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re\nsaying as if you have met me a thousand times before.\u201d You said and chuckled.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cNot\nthousand of course, but yeh a lot of times I have seen you but never got the\nchance to speak.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cOh\nI se-, wait, what?\u201d</p><p>\u00a0He\nlooked at you and raised his eyebrows in a questioning look. \u201cWhat what?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u201cYou\nsaid that you have seen me a lot of times before, but\u2026. you know I think that\nwe both are meeting for the first time.\u201d You said and waited impatiently for\nhis reply. He first looked down and smiled which you thought was the most\nbeautiful thing that you had ever seen in existence.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cThat\nis what YOU think sweetheart, but I have seen you a lot of times before.\u201d You\nblushed at the pet name. But still you were confused. Where did he see you ?\u00a0\u201cWhere\nhave you seen me before then?\u201d\u00a0He\nlicked his lips and smirked at you and then replied, \u201cAll the parties where you\nused to go with Taehyung, you never realized that each one of us used to be\npresent..\u201d\u00a0You\nstared at him. All the parties\u2026.means nearly a 100 parties\u2026.and each one of\nthem used to be present but it was you who never realized their existence? That\nwas too much for you to dissolve at once. You opened your mouth to speak but\ncouldn\u2019t. You did not know from where to begin. What to ask him first. All this\nwhile that he was constantly staring at you he noticed that you required a lot\nmore explanation and that what he said was too less.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cListen,\nyour brother is over-protective and you know that. So, wherever he took you, he\nmade sure that you were always by his side\u2026 he would never leave you alone and\nspeaking of us, he tried his best to keep you away from us lol I don\u2019t know why\u2026.\u201d\u00a0Your\nmouth was still wide open and you waited for him to continue. He was speaking\nflawlessly and all you could see and understand was his lips moving perfectly\nand the words that were slipping out of his mouth without any flaw.</p><p>\u00a0\u201c\u2026..He\nalways warned each one of us to stay away from you and even today before the\nparty he gave us an entire list of instructions of how to behave when you were\naround.\u201d He said and laughed at his own words. after a few minutes when you\nwere finally able to take in and understand what he said, he looked at you and\ncontinued, \u201c\u2026.so, in short words it is just you who thinks that we are meeting\nfor the first time, not me Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0You\nsighed deeply and leaned against the wall. You felt like kicking Taehyung where\nit would hurt him the most. You never imagined that he could do this\u2026.. you\nwere not a 2 year old kid, you were 20!. \u201cShit, I am so sorry\u2026. Taehyung\u2026 you\nknow he is really weird I don\u2019t kn-.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cHey\nit\u2019s ok you know, I mean all of us were kinda used to it.\u201d He said and smiled\nwhile leaning his head against the wall. You did not know for how long you had\nbeen standing there out alone with him. You also did not know if Taehyung was\ninside searching for you. All you knew was that you were enjoying the time that\nyou were spending with him. And nothing else in the world seemed to \u00a0be bothering you in any fucking way.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cOh\u2026.\nmy. There was so much story behind this I never imagined. Well thanks a lot for\nletting me know. And about Taehyung, I\u2019ll take good care of him.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u201cYou\ndon\u2019t have to thank me you know, in fact it\u2019s me who should be thanking\nyou..,for making this evening enjoyable for me. Thank you Y/N.\u201d You both stared\nat each other for awhile. After which you simply threw your arms around his\nshoulders and hugged him. He at first was shocked and did not dare to move his\nhands. A few moments after finally realizing that everything was going right,\nhe slowly moved his arms around your waist and lifted you up effortlessly. Even\nin the chilly evening, you felt light and warm in his arms. No doubt, his\npresence on your birthday was what made it special.\u00a0After\na few moments you slowly pulled yourself back and smiled softly at him.</p><p>\u00a0Jungkook was still having his hands clinged to your waist. If it wasn\u2019t for his\nmorals, he would have smashed you against the wall and devoured your lips like\na hungry boar. He was aware of the fact that he shouldn\u2019t be crossing his\nlimits. There was a war of impulse and morality in him. His raging impulse was\nwhat finally overcame his awareness of morals.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cFuck it.\u201d He pulled your waist and pressed his lips\nt yours without hesitation. Your eyes widened and at first you felt like\npushing him. You had never done anything which Taehyung did not want you to.\nThen why were you not pushing him away? There was something that was preventing\nyou from doing so. You instead wrapped your arms around his neck closed your\neyes and kissed him back. He pulled you even closer and deepened the kiss while\npushing his tongue past your lips. He gently pushed you against the wall and\nheld your face and continued kissing you with all passion. You subconsciously clutched\nonto his shirt. A thousand thoughts were running inside your head but you did\nnot allow any of those to invade your mind and spoil the beautiful moment that you\nwere sharing with him.</p><p>\u00a0You continued to\nkiss \u00a0and the world fell away. It was\nslow and soft, comforting in ways that words would never be. His hand rested\nbelow your ear, his thumb caressing your cheek as your breaths mingled. You ran\nyour fingers down his spine, pulling him closer until there was no space left\nbetween the two of you and he could feel the beating of your heart against his chest.\nHis mouth was so warm, the caress of his lips softer than you could have\nimagined and you opened your mouth with a low moan. He honestly never\nknew a kiss so innocent could be so intimate and electrifying. Your lips were\nmoving in perfect sync, his hands next feeling your waist; he pulled you\ncloser, the kiss deeper, more passionate. He felt your hands on the back of his\nneck play with the ends of his hair. A smile grew on his face as it started to\ntickle, and finally you pulled apart.</p><p>\u00a0You looked up at\nhim and he was looking down at you. You smiled and pushed your head into his\nchest out of embarrassment.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cYou know what\nJungkook, Taehyung is gonna kill you.\u201dHe chuckled.</p><p>\u00a0It\nfelt as if the kiss was a sign of love, and a sign of a lot more to come. There\nwas nothing which you felt was wrong. And so did he</p><p>.\u201cI am sorry for\nkissing you like that Y/N.\u201d You looked up at him and pecked his lips once more.</p><p>\u201cI like you\nJungkook.\u201d</p><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe\nlooked the other way and laughed a little before looking at you and pecking\nyour lips again.<br></p><p>\u201cI like you too Y/N.\u201d</p><hr><p>A/N: THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR READING THIS!!

This is the next jungkook scenario which i dont know invaded my mind at around&hellip;.. 2 AM in the night lol. This is gonna be a long one and i really hope that you all like this too!&nbsp;</p><hr /><p>&ldquo;I wish you a really happy and splendid birthday dear sis.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Thank you so so much, I cannot be anymore happier oppa&hellip;. thank you for all this. But honestly speaking, so much was not required.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>You refused to leave the warm embrace of your sweet and caring older brother Taehyung. It was your birthday, not like you had been waiting for this day to come. You had planned to spend the day just like any other normal day. Little had you known that Taehyung had this big as fuck birthday bash planned for this day with all of your friends invited( including his). Friends included your college ones, high school ones, primary school ones and the ones who live light years away from your connection. So it was his surprise for you to invite all your friends whom you had not met for quite a long time and make the night a memorable one.</p><p>He chuckled,&nbsp;&ldquo; Hey Y/N, you have been hugging me all day&hellip; well I am not complaining, you usually kick me the entire day, I wish your birthday could come everyday and i would have my pretty little sister hug me like this.&rdquo;</p><p>You quickly left him and glared at him,&nbsp;&ldquo; Sometimes I feel that I should start behaving nice to you, but then you yourself prove to me how big of an asshole you are.&rdquo;</p><p>He clutched white fabric of the shirt in front of his chest,&nbsp;&ldquo; Ouch, that was rude.&rdquo;</p><p>All this while you heard Taehyung&rsquo;s phone notifying something for like twenty times. You wondered who was so desperate to talk to him,&nbsp;&ldquo;Hey oppa, why don&rsquo;t you reply something to that crazy girlfriend of yours?&rdquo;</p><p>Taehyung&rsquo;s eyes widened,&nbsp;&ldquo;oh shit!&rdquo;</p><p>He quickly grabbed his phone and replied to all the messages that he had recieved.&nbsp;&ldquo; You both are crazy.&rdquo;</p><p>His fingers stopped typing and his head shot towards you. He stared at you for a while. You raised your eyebrows in a questioning look,&nbsp;&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>He shook his head in amusement before saying,&nbsp;&ldquo; You are saying this because you STILL don&rsquo;t have a fucking boyfriend. And god knows how you are still surviving.&rdquo; It wasn&rsquo;t the first time that he made fun of you for not having a boyfriend even when you were 20.</p><p>You rolled your eyes,&nbsp;&ldquo; I don&rsquo;t need one oppa, staying in a relationship&hellip;. doesn&rsquo;t that suck?&rdquo; You said, not quite sure of your own words.</p><p>&ldquo; You mean to say that being in a relat-, having a boyfriend will suck?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh yes exactly, strange you understood me at once because normally your dumb brain takes half a minute to understand a sentence.&rdquo; He glared at you and pulled your cheeks hard.&nbsp;&ldquo; I am your fucking brother! How can you talk to me like this?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>You whimpered,&nbsp;&ldquo; AH- ouch! oppa I swear to God if you don&rsquo;t leave me at this very mom-&rdquo;. Suddenly his phone rang out out of no where and he left your cheek at once. You rubbed the swollen skin while glaring at him.&nbsp;&ldquo; Asshole.&rdquo; He seemed to ignore what you said and instead picked up the call hurriedly.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh fuc- shit sorry! hey you wait right there I&rsquo;ll be there in a minute!&rdquo; He said nd quickly disconnected the phone.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Aww what happened your girlfriend is furious?? Oh I am so glad that she is.&rdquo; You said and gave a devilish smile. Before he began running to where he intended to he said,&nbsp;&ldquo; First of all, its not my brain which is dumb, its yours that is, because it always assumes stupid and useless things and makes you speak rubbish and utter nonsense. And second of all, its not my girlfriend, there are some of my friends I had invited waiting near our house who are even more crazier than her. I guess I am a lot more clearer now I hope your poor brain was able to take so much at once, anyways I&rsquo;ll see you in a while bubye.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>He threw the words at your face and walked away. Your mouth was wide open and your jaws were about to crash the ground. You stamped your leg and kicked disgustedly at the floor,&nbsp;&ldquo; Taehyung you are such an asshole!.&rdquo;</p><p>You recollected the words that he threw at your face.&nbsp;&ldquo;&hellip;..<i>some of my friends I invited</i>&rdquo;. His friends. You were quite sure that they were none other than the 6 guys of his terrible friend circle and no doubt they were the craziest persons that you had ever met. Actually, heard of. Park Jimin, a total flirt, was the only one with whom you had some sort of a friendly relation. About two other guys that were Hoseok and Yoongi you were not so sure of. You had spoken to Jin and Namjoon a few times.</p><p>&nbsp;And&hellip;. there was Jeon Jungkook. You had never met him in real and neither did you ever speak to him in person. But he was the one about whom Taehyung would speak of the most. About his looks, his physique, his childish nature, his shy nature. Also that he was the most loved one and had a really beautiful voice. You had began liking him since the day you saw him in a video. It was Hoseok&rsquo;s birthday bash and Jungkook, as his special present for Hoseok, sang a beautiful song which was indeed your favourite. Next you saw him in one of his dance videos. You were at awe when you saw him dancing, his thighs, his neck, the way his biceps would bulge out each time he did a move was what led you to having some sort of a crush on him.So, you were excited to see him that evening. Out of no where a thought clicked your mind and you rushed to your room.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo; I think I should find something good to wear.&rdquo;<br /></p><hr /><p>It was 4 PM and Taehyung was seen running across the house every instant trying to verify that every corner of the house was just the way he wanted it and&nbsp; to be. He had put some of his friends to work and you wondered since when did they began agreeing to him and working according to what he said?</p><p>&ldquo; Yah Taehyung, we have been helping you for three hours! And you are simply running here and there shouting at us! what the fuck do you think we are som-&rdquo;. Jimin quickly paused when he saw you quietly standing in one corner and silently observing the party arrangements.&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh hey Y/N&rdquo;</p><p>He said and walked towards you pulling you by your waist into a soft hug.&nbsp;&ldquo;Happy birthday pretty lady.&rdquo; You face contorted at the cheesy pet name and you pulled yourself out of the hug.&nbsp;&ldquo; Thanks, for wishing and also for the wonderful pet name.&rdquo;</p><p>He chuckled,&nbsp;&ldquo;Well bab-&rdquo; He was cut off by Taehyung shouting at him from behind.&nbsp;&ldquo; Park-fucking-Jimin how dare did you tou-, hug my sister without my fucking permission you son of a-!&rdquo; He shouted as he stormed towards Jimin and punched him in the stomach.</p><p>Jimin stumbled a few steps back and whimpered, &ldquo; Ouch!!! Yah I helped you in the arrangements and you don&rsquo;t even let me hug your prett-&rdquo; He was cut off by another punch in the stomach.&nbsp;&ldquo;NO. Not without my permission I have made myself clear several times before. I want to keep my sister from you assholes understand? So don&rsquo;t think of trying anything with her when I am not around.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>You looked at Jimin with pity and sighed. It wasn&rsquo;t new that a guy was either punched or kicked by Taehyung for touching you when he was not around. The concept was Taehyung was a don&rsquo;t-you-dare-try-coming-close-to-my-sister type brother. A way too protective towards you. Maybe because you were the only one in his life. And so was he in yours. You never had much friends and you were more confined to the warm hugs and love of your brother than to anyone, anything else. He had been taking care of you since you were 7, so all you remember is the hard work he did and the love and care he bestowed upon you for all these years.</p><p>But still you called him an asshole.</p><p>&ldquo; You always try to keep Y/N away from assholes, then how are you letting her stay with yourself I fail to understand.&rdquo; Jimin said in a sarcastic voice and in spite of the pain in his stomach giggled a little. You tried to hold in a laughter-<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hey Tae! What&rsquo;s up buddy?&rdquo;. A tone not so familiar to you glided against your ears. The three of you turned back to see the newcomer.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey! You three! Hell after how long are we all meeting?&rdquo; He said and rushed towards and in no time was engaged in bro hugs. Jimin soon joined the other 4. According to your knowledge, they were Hoseok, Jin and Namjoon. Your eyes searched for the remaining two, to be more specific, for Jungkook. There was a slight show of disappointment on your countenance when you unfortunately did not find him in that group.&nbsp;</p><p>They turned back at you and began walking, &ldquo;Hey Y/N.&nbsp; We wish you a really happy and splendid birthday dear&hellip; It&rsquo;s nice to see you after so long you know.&rdquo; You assumed that it was Hoseok who spoke.<br /></p><p>&ldquo; Thank you so much you all for coming, yeh It&rsquo;s been really long since you guys have met, I hope that you all enjoy this night.&rdquo; You said with an affectionate smile.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hey Jin hyung, where are Suga and the maknae? Not yet here? They are coming right? I swear to god if they don&rsquo;t come tonight I wil-&rdquo; He was soon interupted by another voice&hellip;.. which WAS familiar to you in a different way. You did not have to turn back to see and make sure who it was, the moment you heard the voice you knew,<i>&nbsp;&ldquo;&hellip;..he&rsquo;s here, OMG.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Hey hyung.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Everyone there turned back, and so did you, trying hard not to get nervous or feel shy and then the situation would turn awkward because it was the first time that you met him. Your eyes were the first to meet his, and for the first time. He looked at you for a awhile and your heart was beating rapidly. He smiled at you and that was when you felt that you were going to lose your senses right then and there.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Kook, Suga hyung, nice to see you both after so long.&rdquo; Taehyung said and was engaged in bro hugs for the second time,<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hey Y/N, I guess that I am meeting you for the first time, anyways I wish you a really happy birthday, please enjoy.&rdquo; It was Suga who spoke this time. You returned his greetings with a smile,&nbsp;&ldquo;Thank you oppa, I am glad that you came, you too please enjoy the night.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>He smiled and went to get himself engaged in bro hugs with the other guys. And that was when only one person was left. Jungkook. Your eyes met his for the second time and you felt that the charm in his eyes doubled. He shyly walked towards you,&nbsp;&ldquo;Hey&hellip;. Happy birthday Y/N.&rdquo; He said with a pleasing tone and extended his right hand towards you. You gladly accepted it with a pink blush on your cheeks.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you Jungkook oppa.&rdquo; He was about to say something when Taehyung interrupted the two of you. You cursed him a thousand for doing that.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hey! Fucking come and help me with the preparations kook! I am not going to leave you guys just like that!&rdquo; He said and gave a devilish smile.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yes, we would love to help you out Taehyung.&rdquo; Jin said and the others seemd to agree. You looked at Jungkook and he seemed to be saying something to Taehyung which you failed to understand. After a few moments everyone left for work and so did Tae, to guide and instruct them. You watched him walk away and then looked back at Jungkook.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to talk to you for sometime Y/N.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>You were first shocked after hearing him a say that but then nodded shyly.&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes sure oppa.&rdquo;</p><p>He tilted his head and suddenly pushed you to one side. You first jumped due to to his sudden action and widened your eyes. He did not look at you but was looking back. You moved your head to one side and saw that some of the workers were trying to move a chandelier and you guys were blocking the way. He kept you in front of him and they carried away the chandelier from behind his back.</p><p>Such a gentleman.</p><p>After they were gone he looked at you. His face was close and you were sure that he could feel the heat that was coming from your face.&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call me oppa please, it&rsquo;s weird you know, for me.&rdquo; He said and smiled which was more like smirk. You stared at him for a while and then nodded shyly, blushing at the fact that he wanted you to call him just by his name. He did not move back but was staring back down at you. If you had stayed there for a little while longer then you were sure to faint right then and there.</p><p>&ldquo;Umm, the workers are gone.&rdquo; He was snapped back to reality. He looked back to ensure that they were actually gone and got back to his original position at once.&rdquo;I should be distant from you before your brother kills me.&rdquo; He said and looked around to see if Taehyung was around. Fortunately, he wasn&rsquo;t. You guys did not know that someone else, not Taehyung, was there who witnessed the enttre thing that happened just a few minutes ago.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re being a real gentleman today kid?&rdquo; You heard jimin say somewhere from behind the man standing in front of you. Jungkook sighed and turned back,&nbsp;&ldquo;First, I am always a gentleman to those who are worthy of it.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Jimin glared at Jungkook,&nbsp;&ldquo;So you mean ti say that we all are not wor-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And secondly, I am not the kid here today, there&rsquo;s someone younger than me present here.&rdquo; He said and slowly turned his head towards you with a smal smug on his lips. Your cheeks heated up and you looked down as if you did not understand a single thing.<br /></p><p><i>&ldquo;Oh&hellip;&hellip;right.&rdquo; </i>Was all that went through your head at that moment<i>.</i><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip;umm, It&rsquo;s over&nbsp; 5 PM already, I think ya&rsquo;ll should get ready right? Umm, Taehyung will be around here please approach him he will guide you guys where to go.. bubye!.&rdquo; You said and immediately rushed from that place. Jungkook and jimin chuckled in amusement.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey&hellip;I hope you know that if Taehyung gets even a faint idea of what you are trying to do he is gonna bury you alive kook.&rdquo; Jimin said while putting his arms around his shoulders.<br /></p><p>Jungkook simply smiled and looked at the way in which you ran away.</p><hr /><p>It was 6:30 PM already and you were still standing in front of your mirror judging the way you looked with your only close friend Lisa and Taehyung standing behind you with arms crossed in front of their chests. You looked at him and then at her with the same question in your eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey guys, do I look good?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Lisa was tired of giving the same answer and simply gave you a disgusted look while Taehyung laughed a little and looked the other way and then back at you,&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes Y/N, you are looking beautiful as always, now stop being so nervous else that will cover the charm of your original countenance.&rdquo;</p><p>Lisa nodded,&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes he is right Y/N, now I swear to god if you ask us the same question again I will leave, come on now everyone is waiting!&rdquo;</p><p>Still not sure whether the way you looked was good or not, you walked away and sighed when you heard Taehyung close the door behind you.</p><p><i>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no going back now&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</i><br /></p><p>You guys entered the main ahll and all you could see was not less than a 100 guests out of which you could barely recognize anyone. You looked around and searched for <i>him.</i>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Y/N.&rdquo; You heard a voice behind you and turned to see Jin&nbsp; with a few gifts in there hands. Your eyes widened and you smiled at them.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hey you guys&hellip;.look great!&rdquo; You said and they giggled.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You too look\nbeautiful Y/N. And here, take these, since we did not know anything in\nparticular that you liked, we bought one out of anything that we found, please accept\nour gifts and one again we wish you a really Happy Birthday dear. This is your\nday please enjoy.&rdquo; Namjoon said in the most affectionate voice possible and all\nthe others smiled at you.</p><p>&nbsp; <i>&ldquo;Hell they all are so nice why didn&rsquo;t I talk to them before?&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Well\nit was me who invited you guys here and there is still not a single thanks to\nme.&rdquo; Taehyung sneered and you chuckled. The others also did the same and yoiur\neyes were still trading the entire hall searching for Jungkook. After a few\nminutes of chatting you saw Jimin entering the hall. You watched more closely\nto see if Jungkook would enter next.&nbsp;And\nhe did.&nbsp;He\nwas wearing and light blue shirt with sleeves folded up till his elbow hanging\nloose above his black pants. Hair was perfectly smooth and settled with shoes.\nYou stared at him for a few minutes and did not realize when they walked all\nthe way up till where you guys were standing.</p><p>&nbsp;He looked at you a smiled.&nbsp;&ldquo;Hey\nY/N, Happy birthday again, look I have got this dress for you, hope you like\nit.&rdquo; Jimin said and extended the gift towards you. You took it and smiled, &ldquo;Thank\nyou so much oppa, I am sure that the dress will be just perfect.&rdquo;He smiled and\nagain, bro hugs with the others. Now that again left you with one person.</p><p>&nbsp;Jungkook.\nYou looked at him and he walked towards you in the same way that he did that\nafternoon.&nbsp;&ldquo;Hey\nY/N, I am not sure whether you would like what I have got but&hellip;.you know, since\nI was the last one to come here this was the maximum which I could get, Happy\nbirthday, please accept this.&rdquo; You saw that it was a&hellip;..CD? You opened the\nholder and saw that one was inside it. You smiled in amusement and looked at\nhim, &ldquo;Hey Jungkook, what is this?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;He\nsmiled a little and said, &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s some of the songs. I thought that this\nwas the best thing which I could give you so&hellip;&rdquo; Your eyes widened. You giggled\nand jumped a little. Honestly, that was the best gift which you could have.&nbsp;&ldquo;Thank\nyou so much Jungkook! Th- This is lovely I love it!&rdquo; You said and chuckled. He\nfirst stared at you and then laughed a little completely shocked to see you so\nhappy with that simple gift. He at the least expected you to even open it.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Guys,\nya&rsquo;ll wanna dance?&rdquo; You heard Taehyung say as he slipped his hands around you waists\nand pulled you close to his side and kissed your temples. You smiled at him and\nshowed him the CD which Jungkook gave you. Taehyung first stared at the CD and\nthen smiled a little and ruffled your hair. You smacked his hand away and tried\nto settle your hair again.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh\nyeaahhhhhh I don&rsquo;t know about anyone else but me and Jimin are in! Anyone else\nwanna join can follow us!&rdquo; Hoseok exclaimed and dragged Jimin away with him to\nthe centre of the hall room where everyone was dancing.&nbsp;&ldquo;Hey\npunk wait we will be joining too!&rdquo; Jin, Namjoon and yoongi ran behind them.\nTaehyung looked at you and raised his eyebrows. You shook your head.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Umm,\nhey hyung, I am not in a mood to dance so I&rsquo;ll be staying back.&rdquo; Jungkook said\nwhile inserting his palms into his pockets and looking at the dance floor.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Well,\nthat&rsquo;s strange, but ok as you wish. Come Y/N.&rdquo; Taehyung said while pulling your\nwaist along with him to join the dance floor but you pulled back.&nbsp;&ldquo;Oppa,\nI am not in a mood to dance too.&rdquo; You said pouted.</p><p>&nbsp;Taehyung eyed you and Jungkook\nfor a few times, &ldquo;Have you both planned this or something?&rdquo; You widened your\neyes and shook your hands while Jungkook shook his head for 10 times.&nbsp;After\nstaring at the two of you for a few moments Taehyung sighed, &ldquo;Well, ok then.&rdquo; You\nsmiled and looked at Jungkook who was already smiling at you.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;But I will be\nleaving, and kook, don&rsquo;t try ANYTHING with her just because I am leaving her\nalone with you, understood?&rdquo; Taehyung said with a firm face while Jungkook nodded\nmost obediently. Taehyung smiled at you for the last time and walked away.&nbsp;Your\nheart was beating fast within your chest as it was the first time that you were\nleft alone with him.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;You really don&rsquo;t want to dance?&rdquo; He asked.&nbsp;&ldquo;Umm,\nyeh I.. am not really a party-friendly person Jungkook, but looks like you all\nare, why didn&rsquo;t you go to dance?&rdquo; You asked him and he smiled. He came a bit\ncloser to you and whispered in your ear, &ldquo;Do you want to&hellip;.you know, go to a\nmore quieter place?&rdquo;&nbsp;You\nlooked up at him and he was biting his lower lip and his eyes pleaded for your\nyes. You smiled and before you could say yes he held your wrist and pulled you\nwith him. You looked back for the final time to check if Taehyung was around.\nHe wasn&rsquo;t so you continued to follow Jungkook. There was a sweet smile on your\nlips as it was the first time that you were going out alone with a guy. To be\nmore specific, with Jungkook.</p><p>&nbsp;Within no time you came in contact with the cold evening\natmosphere. You took a deep breath as he leaned against the wall. You joined\nhim and stood by his side leaning against the cold resistance as well. &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s\nnot that I didn&rsquo;t want to dance, dancing is one of my passions&hellip;.well, let&rsquo;s say\nthat I wanted to spend some time with you that&rsquo;s it.&rdquo; He said without any\nhesitation while looking at you. You didn&rsquo;t dare to look back at him after he\nsaid that. You simply looked down and smiled. He noticed that and looked away\nsmiling himself.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;You\nlook a lot different today actually.&rdquo; He said and you looked at him with a confused\nlook.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re\nsaying as if you have met me a thousand times before.&rdquo; You said and chuckled.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Not\nthousand of course, but yeh a lot of times I have seen you but never got the\nchance to speak.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh\nI se-, wait, what?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;He\nlooked at you and raised his eyebrows in a questioning look. &ldquo;What what?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;You\nsaid that you have seen me a lot of times before, but&hellip;. you know I think that\nwe both are meeting for the first time.&rdquo; You said and waited impatiently for\nhis reply. He first looked down and smiled which you thought was the most\nbeautiful thing that you had ever seen in existence.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;That\nis what YOU think sweetheart, but I have seen you a lot of times before.&rdquo; You\nblushed at the pet name. But still you were confused. Where did he see you ?&nbsp;&ldquo;Where\nhave you seen me before then?&rdquo;&nbsp;He\nlicked his lips and smirked at you and then replied, &ldquo;All the parties where you\nused to go with Taehyung, you never realized that each one of us used to be\npresent..&rdquo;&nbsp;You\nstared at him. All the parties&hellip;.means nearly a 100 parties&hellip;.and each one of\nthem used to be present but it was you who never realized their existence? That\nwas too much for you to dissolve at once. You opened your mouth to speak but\ncouldn&rsquo;t. You did not know from where to begin. What to ask him first. All this\nwhile that he was constantly staring at you he noticed that you required a lot\nmore explanation and that what he said was too less.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Listen,\nyour brother is over-protective and you know that. So, wherever he took you, he\nmade sure that you were always by his side&hellip; he would never leave you alone and\nspeaking of us, he tried his best to keep you away from us lol I don&rsquo;t know why&hellip;.&rdquo;&nbsp;Your\nmouth was still wide open and you waited for him to continue. He was speaking\nflawlessly and all you could see and understand was his lips moving perfectly\nand the words that were slipping out of his mouth without any flaw.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;&hellip;..He\nalways warned each one of us to stay away from you and even today before the\nparty he gave us an entire list of instructions of how to behave when you were\naround.&rdquo; He said and laughed at his own words. after a few minutes when you\nwere finally able to take in and understand what he said, he looked at you and\ncontinued, &ldquo;&hellip;.so, in short words it is just you who thinks that we are meeting\nfor the first time, not me Y/N.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;You\nsighed deeply and leaned against the wall. You felt like kicking Taehyung where\nit would hurt him the most. You never imagined that he could do this&hellip;.. you\nwere not a 2 year old kid, you were 20!. &ldquo;Shit, I am so sorry&hellip;. Taehyung&hellip; you\nknow he is really weird I don&rsquo;t kn-.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Hey\nit&rsquo;s ok you know, I mean all of us were kinda used to it.&rdquo; He said and smiled\nwhile leaning his head against the wall. You did not know for how long you had\nbeen standing there out alone with him. You also did not know if Taehyung was\ninside searching for you. All you knew was that you were enjoying the time that\nyou were spending with him. And nothing else in the world seemed to &nbsp;be bothering you in any fucking way.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh&hellip;.\nmy. There was so much story behind this I never imagined. Well thanks a lot for\nletting me know. And about Taehyung, I&rsquo;ll take good care of him.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;You\ndon&rsquo;t have to thank me you know, in fact it&rsquo;s me who should be thanking\nyou..,for making this evening enjoyable for me. Thank you Y/N.&rdquo; You both stared\nat each other for awhile. After which you simply threw your arms around his\nshoulders and hugged him. He at first was shocked and did not dare to move his\nhands. A few moments after finally realizing that everything was going right,\nhe slowly moved his arms around your waist and lifted you up effortlessly. Even\nin the chilly evening, you felt light and warm in his arms. No doubt, his\npresence on your birthday was what made it special.&nbsp;After\na few moments you slowly pulled yourself back and smiled softly at him.</p><p>&nbsp;Jungkook was still having his hands clinged to your waist. If it wasn&rsquo;t for his\nmorals, he would have smashed you against the wall and devoured your lips like\na hungry boar. He was aware of the fact that he shouldn&rsquo;t be crossing his\nlimits. There was a war of impulse and morality in him. His raging impulse was\nwhat finally overcame his awareness of morals.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Fuck it.&rdquo; He pulled your waist and pressed his lips\nt yours without hesitation. Your eyes widened and at first you felt like\npushing him. You had never done anything which Taehyung did not want you to.\nThen why were you not pushing him away? There was something that was preventing\nyou from doing so. You instead wrapped your arms around his neck closed your\neyes and kissed him back. He pulled you even closer and deepened the kiss while\npushing his tongue past your lips. He gently pushed you against the wall and\nheld your face and continued kissing you with all passion. You subconsciously clutched\nonto his shirt. A thousand thoughts were running inside your head but you did\nnot allow any of those to invade your mind and spoil the beautiful moment that you\nwere sharing with him.</p><p>&nbsp;You continued to\nkiss &nbsp;and the world fell away. It was\nslow and soft, comforting in ways that words would never be. His hand rested\nbelow your ear, his thumb caressing your cheek as your breaths mingled. You ran\nyour fingers down his spine, pulling him closer until there was no space left\nbetween the two of you and he could feel the beating of your heart against his chest.\nHis mouth was so warm, the caress of his lips softer than you could have\nimagined and you opened your mouth with a low moan. He honestly never\nknew a kiss so innocent could be so intimate and electrifying. Your lips were\nmoving in perfect sync, his hands next feeling your waist; he pulled you\ncloser, the kiss deeper, more passionate. He felt your hands on the back of his\nneck play with the ends of his hair. A smile grew on his face as it started to\ntickle, and finally you pulled apart.</p><p>&nbsp;You looked up at\nhim and he was looking down at you. You smiled and pushed your head into his\nchest out of embarrassment.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;You know what\nJungkook, Taehyung is gonna kill you.&rdquo;He chuckled.</p><p>&nbsp;It\nfelt as if the kiss was a sign of love, and a sign of a lot more to come. There\nwas nothing which you felt was wrong. And so did he</p><p>.&ldquo;I am sorry for\nkissing you like that Y/N.&rdquo; You looked up at him and pecked his lips once more.</p><p>&ldquo;I like you\nJungkook.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe\nlooked the other way and laughed a little before looking at you and pecking\nyour lips again.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I like you too Y/N.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p>A/N: THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR READING THIS!! THIS WAS MY THIRD JUNGKOOK SCENARIO AND I  M TRYING TO CHANGE MY STYLE OF WRITING A LOT. THANK YOU ALL AGAIN FPR READING THIS LOVE YOU.</p></p>",
