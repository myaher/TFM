I&rsquo;ve always said that if the writers had decided to make Jyrus happen, I would have supported it for the representation alone - because supporting that kind of rep is more important than my personal preferences of pairings. Its not about the actual relationship, but like it or not Tyrus IS providing better representation for the lgbtq community than any other ship for the show because it is the ONLY ship on the show that involves two people who are canonically not straight.
