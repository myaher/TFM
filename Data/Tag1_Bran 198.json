My grandfather was telling them some stories about Irish legends and folklore, like he used to tell me when I was younger, and he told them the story of the Salmon of Knowledge. As I was listening to the story I realized it reminded me a lot of Bran.<br/></p><p><b>The story of the Salmon of Knowledge goes like this:</b></p><p>There was an ordinary salmon ate nine hazelnuts that fell into the Well of Wisdom and from nine hazel trees that surrounded the well. As a result, the salmon gained all the world&rsquo;s knowledge and the first to eat of its flesh would gain it&rsquo;s knowledge.</p><p>A young Fionn Mac Cumhail, the legendary Irish warrior and hunter who led the band of warriors known as the Fianna and created the famous Giants Causeway was helping the poet Finegas, one of the wisest men in Ireland, who had tried for seven years to catch the fish but to no avail.</p><p>Fionn was unaware of the legend about the salmon of knowledge. When Fionn asked Finegas why he spend his days fishing, Finegas would give him no answer. Then one morning, Finegas had caught the salmon.</p><p>Finegas gave the fish to Fionn, and told him to cook it with instructions not to eat it. Fionn then built a fire and cooked the salmon, however when he was turning it, he burnt his finger on a drop of hot fish fat. Fionn sucked on his burned finger to ease the pain. Unbeknownst to Fionn, all of the salmon&rsquo;s wisdom had been concentrated into that one drop of fat.</p><p>When he brought the cooked meal to Finegas, Finegas saw that the Fionn&rsquo;s eyes shone with an unseen wisdom. Finegas asked Fionn if he had eaten any of the salmon, to which Fionn answered no, and Fionn proceeded to explain what had happened. Finegas realized that Fionn had received the wisdom, so gave him the rest of the salmon to eat. Fionn ate the salmon and in so doing gained all the knowledge of the world. Fionn could from then on draw upon this knowledge from the salmon by biting his thumb.</p><p>Fionn is connected to many of the legends of the Fenian Cycle in Irish mythology, however it is this tale where he first came to prominence.</p><p><b>The similarities to Bran:</b></p><ul><li>Both Fionn and Bran are young young boys how are given great knowledge that marks the beginning of their epic journeys.<br/></li><li>In the story, Fionn gains the knowledge of the world through an injury, and the beginning of Bran&rsquo;s metaphysical awakening truly begins after he is crippled by Jaime.<br/></li><li>The origin of the knowledge gained by Fionn and Bran derives from trees.

When Fionn asked Finegas why he spend his days fishing, Finegas would give him no answer. Then one morning, Finegas had caught the salmon.</p><p>Finegas gave the fish to Fionn, and told him to cook it with instructions not to eat it. Fionn then built a fire and cooked the salmon, however when he was turning it, he burnt his finger on a drop of hot fish fat. Fionn sucked on his burned finger to ease the pain. Unbeknownst to Fionn, all of the salmon\u2019s wisdom had been concentrated into that one drop of fat.</p><p>When he brought the cooked meal to Finegas, Finegas saw that the Fionn\u2019s eyes shone with an unseen wisdom. Finegas asked Fionn if he had eaten any of the salmon, to which Fionn answered no, and Fionn proceeded to explain what had happened. Finegas realized that Fionn had received the wisdom, so gave him the rest of the salmon to eat. Fionn ate the salmon and in so doing gained all the knowledge of the world. Fionn could from then on draw upon this knowledge from the salmon by biting his thumb.</p><p>Fionn is connected to many of the legends of the Fenian Cycle in Irish mythology, however it is this tale where he first came to prominence.</p><p><b>The similarities to Bran:</b></p><ul><li>Both Fionn and Bran are young young boys how are given great knowledge that marks the beginning of their epic journeys.<br></li><li>In the story, Fionn gains the knowledge of the world through an injury, and the beginning of Bran\u2019s metaphysical awakening truly begins after he is crippled by Jaime.<br></li><li>The origin of the knowledge gained by Fionn and Bran derives from trees.
