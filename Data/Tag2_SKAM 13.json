Arthur has some very deep insecurities and usually takes them out on women, whether it\u2019s treating them poorly (cheating on them, not listening well, being generally lad-ish) or saying he hooked up with an older one to sound cool. Because he is with Alexia, he tries to be more gentlemen-like, but it doesn\u2019t really work and she now becomes the victim of his treatment. She finally tells him that what he is doing is not right and breaks ties with him. All while this is going on, he has a bit of a alcohol/drug problem which is heightened because of the BAC and what Alexia said/did. Because he actually really liked Alexia ( unlike the others) , he falls into a deep pit of drinking and smoking/ drugs . There might be something about him secretly dealing and maybe some trouble while he is in this pit. he can\u2019t  understand why he acts like he does because he knows people trust him and people think he is nice and kind, he doesn\u2019t go to school and neither friend group is very happy with him. However, le Gang becomes worried but they can\u2019t get a hold of him. They ask Alexia to go and talk to him. She is reluctant to go, but she does anyway because she was a little worried also. She finds out about the substance abuse, and tells him that everything is going to be fine and to tell le gang or his parents. Le gang takes him to get help and although this makes him feel worse about himself at first, he knows he has support to get better. Everyone knows that he is a good friend and has a kind heart, and wishes he would just be better. When he becomes sober and stable he realizes the life he lived when he was high/drunk all the time was not a good life. He apologizes to alexia for how he treated her and thanks her for helping him confront his problems and then reach out to get help to become sober (he also thanks le gang). There should also be something with his parents in there. I have no clue if this is right, maybe it will be completely not this, I just think they will go for another big societal issue that effects teens which is drugs/ vaping and exposure to alcohol with some \u201clearn how to respect a woman / relationship\u201d mixed in. and perhaps instead of him just telling Alexia about the substance abuse, she finds he has overdosed or has alcohol poisoning in the middle of the day, and that is how everyone finds out. Or something with him ending up in trouble with the police. </p>",

Arthur has some very deep insecurities and usually takes them out on women, whether it\u2019s treating them poorly (cheating on them, not listening well, being generally lad-ish) or saying he hooked up with an older one to sound cool. Because he is with Alexia, he tries to be more gentlemen-like, but it doesn\u2019t really work and she now becomes the victim of his treatment. She finally tells him that what he is doing is not right and breaks ties with him. All while this is going on, he has a bit of a alcohol/drug problem which is heightened because of the BAC and what Alexia said/did. Because he actually really liked Alexia ( unlike the others) , he falls into a deep pit of drinking and smoking/ drugs . There might be something about him secretly dealing and maybe some trouble while he is in this pit. he can\u2019t  understand why he acts like he does because he knows people trust him and people think he is nice and kind, he doesn\u2019t go to school and neither friend group is very happy with him. However, le Gang becomes worried but they can\u2019t get a hold of him. They ask Alexia to go and talk to him. She is reluctant to go, but she does anyway because she was a little worried also. She finds out about the substance abuse, and tells him that everything is going to be fine and to tell le gang or his parents. Le gang takes him to get help and although this makes him feel worse about himself at first, he knows he has support to get better. Everyone knows that he is a good friend and has a kind heart, and wishes he would just be better. When he becomes sober and stable he realizes the life he lived when he was high/drunk all the time was not a good life. He apologizes to alexia for how he treated her and thanks her for helping him confront his problems and then reach out to get help to become sober (he also thanks le gang). There should also be something with his parents in there. I have no clue if this is right, maybe it will be completely not this, I just think they will go for another big societal issue that effects teens which is drugs/ vaping and exposure to alcohol with some \u201clearn how to respect a woman / relationship\u201d mixed in. and perhaps instead of him just telling Alexia about the substance abuse, she finds he has overdosed or has alcohol poisoning in the middle of the day, and that is how everyone finds out. Or something with him ending up in trouble with the police. </p></p>",
