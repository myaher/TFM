Future-fic, book-verse.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>The title of this story comes from &ldquo;Rebecca&rdquo; by Daphne du Maurier.</p><p>She slides her hands into her tightly-braided crown of hair, and it only requires a few moments of kneading and wiggling to loosen the pins enough to comb them out using her fingers. A phantom voice- <i>Septa Mordane&rsquo;s voice</i>- echoes through the back of her skull, clarion-clear as it reminds her of how terribly inappropriate it is to take one&rsquo;s hair down in a public (even semi-public) venue.</p><p>But there&rsquo;s no one here to see, no one here to care. The tavern-keep retreated to the back storeroom as soon as the fire in the hearth started to dwindle, and the stools and chairs scattered throughout the threadbare space are conspicuously free of revelers, aside from the two at the table where she now places her decommissioned hairpins, arranging them into geometric patterns.</p><p>And as for her companion- <i>still no one to see. Still no one to care</i>.</p><p>Ser Jaime typically pays her as little mind as he can manage, conspicuously averting his eyes whenever they walk or ride alongside each other, never attempting to engage her in conversation. While Brienne remained in their retinue, Sansa registered few complaints about Ser Jaime&rsquo;s behavior- he preferred to chat and commiserate with his fellow knight&hellip;and, in all honesty, Sansa would far rather spend time with Brienne than with her sullen male counterpart. </p><p>But Brienne rides south now, a direction in which Sansa never intends to ride again if she can possibly help it. She and Ser Jaime continue their path toward Winterfell, and if long spells of quiet, &nbsp;awkward mornings and vacant nights are the price she must pay to keep herself moving northward, she considers it well worthwhile.</p><p>She&rsquo;s now spent quite a bit of time in deep concentration, focusing on shaping her hairpins into a pyramid, and she doesn&rsquo;t feel the peculiar weight of his gaze on her face until several moments after it begins. Her eyebrows creep closer together and her jaw tightens, but she shan&rsquo;t interrupt her progress until the pyramid achieves perfect proportions-</p><p>Finally, she completes the task at hand and allows her eyes to drift upwards and lock upon Ser Jaime&rsquo;s own. Once again, she hears Septa Mordane&rsquo;s voice warning against the rudeness of looking a man directly in the eyes&hellip;but the novelty of the golden knight&rsquo;s attention rather diminishes her need for politeness.</p><p>&ldquo;Is something wrong, Ser?&rdquo; she breezily inquires, willing herself to keep her own bemusement from entering her tone.</p><p>Jaime replies with a half-smile and a shake of the head before lifting his mug to his lips - the mug that Sansa knows to be completely empty- and taking a &ldquo;sip&rdquo;. </p><p>&ldquo;No, nothing.&rdquo; </p><p>Even in the dim environs of the tavern, Sansa thinks she notices a flush of crimson on Ser Jaime&rsquo;s face- not on his cheeks, of course (they&rsquo;re too overgrown with gold, silver, and grey facial hair for her to discern their color), but on the tip of his nose. Were she less perplexed by his obvious stares- and his choice to lie about them- she might even find the blush endearing.</p><p>But before she can properly decide whether to continue this &ldquo;conversation&rdquo; or whether to return to her impromptu hairpin design project, Ser Jaime speaks again:</p><p>&ldquo;Did I ever tell you that I knew your mother when she was around your age?&rdquo;</p><p><i>No, because you never tell me anything</i>. And in yet another lapse of courtesy, Sansa finds herself unable to restrain a deep sigh of frustration. She&rsquo;d hoped that they were well past mentions of her family tragedies- when last he spoke of Lady Catelyn, he&rsquo;d been farther into his cups than he is at present, and he&rsquo;d made some cutting, thoughtless comment about the fact that he saw her dearly-departed mother more recently than she ever did, ever would. </p><p>She&rsquo;d struck him across the face at that, manners be damned, reveling in the triumph conjured by his astonishment, by the crack of her palm across his cheekbone, by the small scrape left by her long fingernail just below his left eye socket. </p><p>Yes, she&rsquo;d thought he learned his lesson from that surprising exchange. But clearly there&rsquo;s more to say&hellip;and clearly, he&rsquo;s determined to disappoint her as thoroughly as possible before they arrive in her homeland. </p><p>For a single thought now hangs in her mind&rsquo;s web, squirming and struggling and stubbornly refusing to lose its breath-</p><p><i>You took me from the Vale, away from Lysa&rsquo;s shade, away from Petyr&hellip;only to tell me tales of how charmed you were by my mother in her youth.

The landscape between Winterfell and Castle Black was monotonous and never changing and after a few weeks there were not that many topics left she could discuss with the knights and servants accompanying her.</p><p>Once upon a time she had read in a book that journeys never were about the destination, but about the road and the way towards the destination. She could imagine that was true for certain journeys and especially for life, but it surely wasn&rsquo;t true for traveling from point A to B and especially not when point A was her childhood home and the castle she was now ruling and point B was the place where she would meet the man she loved again for the first time in a very long while.</p><p>&ldquo;My Queen?&rdquo; One of her loyal knights cleared his throat when he made his horse fall into step with hers. &ldquo;Due to the excellent weather circumstances we will reach Castle Black tonight.

The air had been much colder at the time and falling snow had slowed them down tremendously, but just like now Sansa had kept herself going by thinking of Jon, of once more feeling his strong arms embracing her, of knowing that maybe together they could take everything back that was stolen from them, from the Starks. </p><p>Now there was only one more thing they should right. </p><p>They had taken their home back. They had protected it against each and every threat, against both ice and fire. Maybe, after everything they had been through, everything they had endured, all those times they had suffered, the Gods had finally been on their side.</p><p>But Jon still wasn&rsquo;t home and without him there it would always feel as if a small piece of the puzzle was missing, as if the happily ever after they had worked for hadn&rsquo;t arrived yet, as if they had not yet reached the end of their long and tiring journey.</p><p>It was another journey that had never been about the journey itself for Sansa. The journey had been painful, filled with moments she could have lived and done without, filled with misery and heartbreak. It was because of the journey that she had quickly grown into the woman she was nowadays, but she liked to believe that she would have become the Queen she deserved to be anyway, even if it would have taken her a little longer.</p><p>Sansa straightened her back and lifted her chin however. She was surrounded by guards and people who looked up at her, who had wanted her to be their Queen, who didn&rsquo;t mind that she was a woman. All those people had suffered in their own way, but here they were, stronger than they had ever been and finally independent.</p><p>&ldquo;Queen Sansa&hellip;&rdquo; Fredrik cleared his throat and he tightened his grip on the reins of his horse. His knuckles paled. &ldquo;I hope that you won&rsquo;t mind the question, but we were wondering&hellip;&rdquo; He hesitated for a moment and Sansa was bracing herself for whatever question or request would follow. &ldquo;Do we still need to address King Jon as our King?&rdquo;</p><p>The question surprised her and in a way it overwhelmed her too. </p><p>Technically Jon was no King in the North anymore. He had laid down his title when he had kneeled for Daenerys to get her help in the long night. He had never claimed it back and maybe deep down he had not even wanted it back. He was good at ruling, but it didn&rsquo;t seem to be something that actually made him happy.</p><p>&ldquo;I will discuss that matter with him.&rdquo; Sansa licked her dry lips. &ldquo;I assume there won&rsquo;t be any spies or prying eyes around, but I would suggest that it might be better to not call him King.&rdquo; </p><p>It was a lesson she had learned the hard way. There could always be someone listening to every word you said, waiting to report it to whomever could use the information. And even though the war was over and Westeros was relatively at peace, there were quite certainly still people with bad intentions. There would always be people with bad intentions.</p><p>Fredrik nodded. &ldquo;You are right, my Queen.&rdquo; He bent his head slightly. &ldquo;How should we address him then?&rdquo; </p><p>Once Jon had been Lord Commander of the Night&rsquo;s Watch. But Sansa wasn&rsquo;t sure if calling Jon Lord Snow would still be appropriate. Most of the time he was not even with the actual Night&rsquo;s Watch. He much preferred spending his days even much further North, with the Wildlings he had won over and who had embraced him as one of their own. </p><p>&ldquo;It will be the first thing I will ask him.&rdquo; Sansa nodded once more at her companion and then she saw the contours of the castle appearing on the horizon. Instinctively she planted her heels in the flanks of her horse to make him go faster and within a few seconds she had broken free from the caravan.</p><p>The castle in the distance grew bigger and bigger, just like the smile on Sansa&rsquo;s face while she rushed through the gate and jumped down on the still frozen floor. </p><p>A familiar face appeared on top of the wooden stairs. His black curls had grown longer and wilder, but it had only made him look more handsome. As soon as his eyes found hers the smile on his face brightened and the frown on his forehead faded. He rushed down the stairs and less than a second later Sansa felt his strong arms around her, lifting her feet up from the ground. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve missed you&hellip;&rdquo; She whispered and she buried her nose in his hair while she wrapped her arms around his neck.

There\u2019s meta that goes into this, but Rickard Stark seems to have had really good control of his children; curbing a lot of Lyanna\u2019s unlady-like urges and probably notable hothead Brandon as well.

There&rsquo;s meta that goes into this, but Rickard Stark seems to have had really good control of his children; curbing a lot of Lyanna&rsquo;s unlady-like urges and probably notable hothead Brandon as well. There&rsquo;s an extent to which I think Ned just assumed he could get the same level of control from his children. As he says to Arya, to him the pack draws together when there&rsquo;s danger.</p><p>Thanks for the question, anon.</p>",
