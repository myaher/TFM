\u00a0Loved. \u00a0Hoseok loved love. \u00a0How could he not like weddings, then? \u00a0Plus, dancing? \u00a0Alcohol? \nHot men in suits looking hot? \nWhat\u2019s not to like?</p><!-- more --><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nHoseok\nhated anxiety, though, and found loving people who had hate in their hearts\nhard to do. \u00a0It\u2019s a testament to the\nnurture argument in psychology that Jungkook has turned out so differently than\nhis parents. \u00a0Hoseok has never really\ndisliked people as much as he has disliked Jungkook\u2019s parents lately, and if\nthe way Jimin\u2019s face was screwed up was any indication, then the other man must\nbe feeling the same.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nHe\nhad merely come to check in on Tae, and consequently, Jimin, since Jungkook had\ninsisted he was ready and it was time to start, so he almost closed the door\nimmediately when he saw two other figures in the room, but if Hoseok was a cat,\nhe would have been dead a long time ago, because his curiosity has always\ngotten the best of him. \u00a0Jungkook\u2019s\nparents aren\u2019t ugly people\u2014he clearly got his good looks from somewhere\u2014but\nthey were ugly people. \u00a0Desperation,\nsurely, or pride, must have gotten the best of their senses at some point. \u00a0Something had to explain why they seemed to\ncare so little about their son. \u00a0Hoseok\nknew it wasn\u2019t quite his place or business to stay in the room or make himself\nknown or listen at all, but something about what Mr. Jeon murmured about</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\ncan\u2019t believe we\u2019re letting him marry a man,\u201d made him stay. \u00a0Because he knew that there were people out\nthere in the world who still didn\u2019t agree with men marrying mem or women\nmarrying women despite that fact that soulmates often were of the same sex. \u00a0He knew shelters around the city and probably\nthe world were filled with kids whose parents didn\u2019t agree with them being with\ntheir soulmate purely because they were the same sex, but still, it jarred him\nto hear. \u00a0He only entered the room to\nshut the door so Jungkook wouldn\u2019t have to hear the rest.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re\nletting him marry his soulmate,\u201d Tae said besides his own soulmate, a fierce\nand intense look in his eyes Hoseok rarely saw. \nHe was glad he rarely saw it, honestly. \nAn angry Tae, just like an angry Jimin, or maybe an angry anyone, scared\nHoseok a little.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re\nnot even letting him do that,\u201d Jimin said, wrapping his arm around Tae for\nsupport. \u00a0\u201cI had to pay you before you\neven allowed that. \u00a0Now, as I know we\ndidn\u2019t invite you, I\u2019m going to have to ask you to leave, as there can\u2019t be any\nreason for you to be here unless you want something else, and you\u2019re not going\nto get it, whatever it is.\u201d \u00a0Jungkook\u2019s\nmother had the audacity to try to look affronted at the idea.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nam just here to see my boy get married.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHe\ndoesn\u2019t want you here,\u201d Jimin said. \u00a0\u201cAnd\nI don\u2019t either. \u00a0It\u2019s his day, our day,\nand you no longer have a right to take part of it.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat\nwill it look like?\u201d Mr. Jeon said, stepping toward Jimin. \u00a0\u201cWhat will it look like if his parents aren\u2019t\nthere?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\nwill look like what it is,\u201d Tae almost sneered. \n\u201cLike you aren\u2019t wanted.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cMy\nparents aren\u2019t here either. \u00a0They also\nlost the right to have any part in my life when they refused to accept who the\nworld had provided for me and I had managed to find and be found by. \u00a0So, unless you have a question about the\npayment I already sent you, or the paperwork we have already filled out, you\nneed to leave.\u201d \u00a0If Hoseok wasn\u2019t so\nhopelessly in love with Tae, and his best friend wasn\u2019t about to marry him,\nHoseok might have had to claim Jimin for himself. \u00a0He seemed to be burning with a passion that terrified\nand enthralled Hoseok.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nJungkook\u2019s\nparents seemed to think, or seethe, for a moment, perhaps looking for an iota\nof an excuse to stay. \u00a0Hoseok hoped, deep\ndown, that it was some buried deep love for their son that they wanted to stay,\nbut the way that they finally scoffed and stormed out, barely giving him a\nglance on the way, crushed those ideas quickly. \nTheir exit brought Hoseok to Jimin and Tae\u2019s attention, and they let go\nof each other so Tae could come to him, enveloping the man in a tight hug.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d\nJimin said, buttoning his blazer. \u00a0\u201cIs\nJungkook okay?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOh,\nyeah,\u201d Hoseok said over Tae\u2019s shoulder. \n\u201cHe asked me to let you know he\u2019s ready.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\nuh, tell him, yeah?\u201d Jimin said, still fidgeting with his suit. \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t want\u2014\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nhave no idea what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Hoseok said, winking and smiling\nwidely. \u00a0\u201cI saw nothing. \u00a0I heard nothing. \u00a0In fact, am I even here? \u00a0Are any of us here?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cStop,\u201d\nTae mumbled, nipping at his ear before pulling away, an arm still held tightly\naround his waist.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cSeriously,\nthough, you handled it well. \u00a0I don\u2019t\nknow what I would have done if they came to Jungkook\u2019s room.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cShit,\u201d\nJimin said, the idea having seemed to have not occurred to him as he rushed for\nthe door. \u00a0Hoseok made sure to stop him\nbefore he got too far, though, putting his arm out to pull him into a hug that\nTae quickly made into a group one.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHey,\nwhoa, he\u2019s alright. \u00a0Y/N\u2019s in there, and\nI told her not to let anyone in except me. \nYou know it\u2019s bad luck to see the groom before the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWell\nthen,\u201d Jimin sighed even as a relaxed smile spread over his face, \u201cwe\u2019re doomed\nconsidering I saw him an hour ago.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah,\nno, you\u2019re so gross nothing could doom this marriage,\u201d Tae said, and Jimin\nsimply blinked and looked at his arm around Hoseok\u2019s waist. \u00a0His soulmate didn\u2019t seem deterred, though, as\nhe pulled Hoseok closer. \u00a0Hoseok sometimes\nwondered if the two soulmates did speak telepathically, because Jimin laughed\nas Tae rested his head on Hoseok\u2019s shoulder. \nHe felt a little out of the loop, if he had to be honest, but he knew\nthey weren\u2019t being malicious or even meaning to.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cGo\ndo your best men duties,\u201d Jimin said, waving them out. \u00a0\u201cI need to finish getting ready.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWait,\nwe actually have to do stuff?\u201d Tae pouted as Hoseok tickled his side so he would\nstand up straight. A mere wave of Jimin\u2019s hand sent them off again, and as soon\nas his back was turned Hoseok leaned over to give Tae a peck on the cheek which\nmade the man smile as he straightened his own clothes before nodding. \u00a0\u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cReady,\u201d\nHoseok nodded back, even if he wasn\u2019t exactly sure that was 100% true because\nhe wasn\u2019t 100% sure what Tae meant by the question. \u00a0Still, he followed him out. \u00a0He would be a dutiful best man. \u00a0He\u2019d do anything to ensure Jungkook had a perfect\nday.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nNothing\nwas perfect in life, of course, even on the day of a wedding between two souls\nwho were clearly meant to be.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOh\nmy god, fucking, I can\u2019t, it just, why won\u2019t it button?\u201d Jungkook whined and huffed,\nhis fingers dropping lamely to his side. \nYou tried desperately to resist an urge to laugh at him.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d\nyou said as you closed the door behind you, since something needed to come out\nof your mouth and you assumed laughing at the boy in his nervous state wouldn\u2019t\nhelp anything. \u00a0\u201cLet me.\u201d \u00a0He thankfully did, staring up at the ceiling\nand sighing as you easily buttoned his blazer. \nSmoothing out his collar and adjusting his bow-tie even though it didn\u2019t\nneed to be, you patted him on the shoulder and stepped back, giving him a final\nlook-over. \u00a0He spread his hands open in\nfront of himself as if to be on display, and you nodded approvingly. \u00a0He still only sighed again and slumped into a\nchair before shooting back up immediately, smoothing out his coat and fussing\nwith his pockets. \u00a0\u201cYou look extremely\nuncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\nthink?\u201d he huffed, fiddling with his cuffs.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cAre\nyou nervous?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOnly\na ton.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d \u00a0The question was simple, but Jungkook still\nlooked up at you seriously as if constructing an argumentative thesis in his\nhead before he responded. \u00a0\u201cI mean,\u201d you\nsaid slowly, \u201che is your soulmate.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah,\nno, it\u2019s not that. \u00a0It\u2019s. \u00a0It\u2019s,\u201d he sighed, looking past you at the\ndoor again. \u00a0\u201cI just really don\u2019t want to\nmess up.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d\nyou said, fighting a smile again. \u00a0\u201cWell,\nwhile I try to make it a point to not quote him, my dad once told me that some\nnerves are good. \u00a0It just shows you care.\u201d \u00a0Jungkook looked suspicious, so you only\nshrugged. \u00a0\u201cI mean, if you didn\u2019t care, you\nwould be apathetic. \u00a0You obviously want\nto do well and make Jimin happy, so you\u2019re nervous. \u00a0Not that you should be. \u00a0You\u2019ll be fine. \u00a0Great, even. \nIt\u2019s just a ceremony. \u00a0What really\nmatters comes before and after, right?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d\nJungkook said, but he still looked uncomfortable or anxious. \u00a0You couldn\u2019t imagine why, as his confidence\nalways seemed boosted around Jimin lately. \nYou saw him anxious at the coffee shop, but that was different. \u00a0That was trying to please twenty different\npeople at once who were nigh impossible to please even on their best days. \u00a0He could make the perfect drink, which he\nalways did, and they could still get upset. \nThey weren\u2019t really upset at him, but he always seemed to take it that\nway. \u00a0It was understandable, even if sad. \u00a0You didn\u2019t like seeing Jungkook at work, so\nout of control and uncomfortable. \u00a0You\ndidn\u2019t like him looking so anxious now, either, but you really didn\u2019t think he\nshould be.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat,\num, exactly do you think you\u2019re going to mess up? \u00a0Hoseok and Tae have the rings, right?\u201d \u00a0A nod. \n\u201cYou know your vows.\u201d \u00a0A\nstatement, not a question, because you knew he did, but he still nodded. \u00a0\u201cIs it Tae? \nAre you worried about if it will be weird or something?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cNo,\nno. \u00a0Not much is going to change. \u00a0I mean, some stuff, but not much.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOkay. \u00a0So, what are you worried about messing up?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cJust. \u00a0You know how sometimes you meet someone who\u2019s\nbetter at you at something you want to be good at?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOnly\nlike every day,\u201d you mumbled, only half-joking. \nJungkook glared a little before he continued, not meeting your gaze.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cJimin\nis just good. \u00a0I know he is. \u00a0He has a lot of experience. \u00a0And I\u2026\u201d \nJungkook trailed off, leaving you blinking and struggling to be patient\nand understanding when you would much prefer him to just be blunt.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cAt\nwhat?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\nknow.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nreally don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\nknow,\u201d Jungkook said forcefully and slowly. \nYou were about to insist, again, that you didn\u2019t know what he was\ntalking about, when he raised his hands, made a circle with one, and proceeded\nto stick his pointer finger through it.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOh\nmy god,\u201d you screamed, doubling over in laughter, much to Jungkook\u2019s chagrin. \u00a0\u201cOh, oh my god.\u201d \u00a0Struggling to stop laughing, you reached for\na nearby chair to stable yourself, almost wishing like you didn\u2019t know what he\nwas referring to.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cStop,\u201d\nJungkook grumbled. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m serious. \u00a0What if. \nI don\u2019t know. \u00a0I suck?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOh\nmy god,\u201d you said, almost falling over again at his word choice. \u00a0He seemed to realize it belatedly, too, as he\nhuffed and his cheeks started to color a little. \u00a0\u201cIsn\u2019t\u2014wouldn\u2019t\u2014wouldn\u2019t that be good?\u201d you\nsaid between breaths. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s\nHoseok? \u00a0Isn\u2019t it time to go?\u201d Jungkook mumbled,\npushing past you to open the door. \u00a0You recovered\nenough to stop him even though your eyes were still watering, leaning against\nthe door to catch your breath and keeping him from escaping.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHold\u2014hold\non,\u201d you said, putting out your hands to stop him and steady yourself on his\nshoulders. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m sorry for\nlaughing. \u00a0Jungkook, I\u2019m just, it\u2019s just,\noh wow, you don\u2019t have to worry about that. \nI mean, I get it, but really, Jimin\u2019s experience, as you call it, will\nonly serve to help. \u00a0I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll take\ngood care of you. \u00a0Just, I mean, as a\nnon-male, I don\u2019t think I have much advice for you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\ndon\u2019t want your advice,\u201d Jungkook said, looking appalled.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cBut\nat some level it\u2019s all the same. \u00a0You don\u2019t\nhave to be in love to have sex, but I\u2019m sure it helps. \u00a0Just don\u2019t expect it to be perfect the first\ntime, yeah? \u00a0It\u2019ll probably be awkward\nand weird and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cGreat\npep talk,\u201d Jungkook said, trying to get past you again. \u00a0He easily could, you both knew, if it was\npurely up to strength, so he must not have actually wanted to leave the room,\njust the conversation as he let you stop him.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m\njust saying, he\u2019ll be good to you. \u00a0And\nthat will make it great. \u00a0Just be good\nback. \u00a0You\u2019ll have to tell him what you\nlike and don\u2019t like. \u00a0You know him. \u00a0He\u2019ll insist on knowing, maybe even to an\nannoying point.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah,\nyeah.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cBut\nthat means you actually have to tell him,\u201d you said, poking his chest\nagain. \u00a0\u201cAnd be honest. \u00a0It\u2019ll be good. \u00a0Like you said, he\u2019s good. \u00a0Probably good at it, too, but good more so.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d\nJungkook groaned.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t\nworry. \u00a0It\u2019ll be good.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cIs\nit good with Yoongi?\u201d Jungkook said so casually and yet quickly that you withdrew\nyour finger back just as fast. \u00a0The way\nhe blinked and then started to smile down at you was a sign for you to withdraw\nbefore he got the upper hand. \u00a0He knew\nthat the question alone was already an Ace card, and you turned to open the\ndoor, trying to push him back so he couldn\u2019t see or get out. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll\ngo get Hoseok, I\u2019m sure he has a lot of great sex advice,\u201d you said as loudly\nback at Jungkook as you could, shutting the door in his face before he could\nstop you. \u00a0The door clicked loudly behind\nyou and radiated through the quiet, but not empty, hallway. \u00a0The silence only lasted for a second when you\nsaw Hoseok and Tae standing across the hall, smirking at you, Hoseok\u2019s eyebrows\nraised. \u00a0\u201cNo, I do not want to explain,\u201d\nyou said, waving your hands in front of your face to get rid of any unwanted\nquestions or comments. \u00a0\u201cAnd I don\u2019t want\nto explain. \u00a0I\u2019m going to go sit down\nnow.\u201d \u00a0With the shared laughter of Hoseok\nand Tae fading behind you, you fled down the hallway to the small sanctuary, trying\nto slip into your seat unnoticed.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nYou\nmostly were, but the pianist\u2019s fingers misstepped, and a note went missing or a\nnote was added, something barely jarring in the flow of music but enough for\nyou to know that someone did notice you entering, and you ducked your head,\ntrying to not be a distraction. \u00a0The\nmusic continued flawlessly, but you still knew he was watching. \u00a0You found yourself, as the song continued,\nunable and unwilling to not look up, though, something drawing your head\nup. \u00a0So it was no surprise to see Min\nYoongi staring and smiling back at you from the stage, his fingers moving effortlessly\nover the keys as he didn\u2019t even look at them. \nIt seemed like he had been waiting for you to merely look up, because\nthe second you did and your eyes met across the room, his smile melted into\ncontentment before he focused all of his attention back on the piano in front\nof him. \u00a0If you had anything else to focus\non, you would have, but you didn\u2019t. \u00a0Completely\nshamelessly, then, you simply watched Yoongi as you sat and waited for the ceremony\nto begin. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nFrankly,\nyou watched him even after the ceremony began. \nYou had seen him that morning but had to rush out to help Kimie finish\ndecorating and help Tae and Jimin get things ready. \u00a0Yoongi had arrived in the past hour and let\nyou know via text. \u00a0As people filed in,\nmostly just Jimin\u2019s dance friends and a handful of people you didn\u2019t know, some\nindescribable anxiety started to settle in as the people began to, as\nwell. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t like Jungkook\u2019s nerves. \u00a0You had nothing to be nervous about, after all. \u00a0You weren\u2019t getting married, and nothing was\nexpected of you the rest of the evening since the flowers were done and you\nwere just going to go home and sleep next to Yoongi like you had been doing for\na while now. \u00a0Something about watching everyone\nsit down, leaning into someone\u2019s ear next to them to whisper something about\nhow pretty it was or about how the famous Min Yoongi was playing beautiful\npiano music, made you keep looking at Yoongi and the empty spot beside you,\nthough, and by the time Yoongi paused, looking over at you one last time before\nhe started the wedding march, you realized what was wrong, even if it made you\nfeel a little pathetic.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nWeddings\nhad always left an odd taste in your mouth. \nYou had only been to a few that you could remember, but even one could\nhave been enough. \u00a0Seeing people so in\nlove and so meant for each other\u2014each one you had gone to had been one between\nsoulmates\u2014had left you numb and hopeless, possibly border lining on angry. \u00a0While weddings brought two people together\nand thus their families and friends, uniting strangers and solidifying a\nrelationship between many people for years to come, they always had made you\nfeel even more alone. \u00a0Looking up at\nYoongi now, even if you knew you were his soulmate, made your skin itch and\nyour feet bounce up and down in anticipation. \nYou throat felt parched, and your heart beat too quickly and yet seemed\nto sink. \u00a0Curling your fingers together\nuntil your nails dug into your palms, you told yourself to calm down. \u00a0You were and therefore would be happy for\nJimin and Jungkook and not frown and pout and be upset that Yoongi wasn\u2019t\nsitting beside you. \u00a0It was just for a\nfew hours. \u00a0Afterwards, you could go home\nand be as close as you wanted to him.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nSo\nwhy did you still feel like you were going to be alone forever?</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThe\nceremony, thankfully, was short, and you were able to concrete on Jimin and\nJungkook. \u00a0They made it hard not to. \u00a0Tae and Hoseok stood alone on the stage near\nthe priest\u2014the same one commissioned to marry off Jungkook before\u2014something about\nJimin having<i> \u201ca ton of friends, but I don\u2019t,\nso no, only best men, no groomsmen. \u00a0Your\nside would be embarrassingly huge.</i>\u201d \u00a0They\nseemed unable to take their eyes off of each other, too, though it was Hoseok\nwho was eyeing Tae more. \u00a0He looked at\nhis friend entering with Jimin, but only barely, before his eyes went back to\nTae\u2019s. \u00a0His smile seemed to widen any time\nthe man seemed to catch his gaze and shoot him a smile. \u00a0They both looked sickenly happy and in love,\nso much so it might have looked to some that they were getting married.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThe\npeonies you and Kimie had picked for the wedding contrasted nicely with Jimin\nand Jungkook\u2019s mostly white suits, and you thought it appropriate and sweet that\nthey walked each other down the aisle, having no time or place for their\nfathers or mothers to do the honor. \u00a0The\npriest spoke not of anyone giving someone away, but of giving each other to the\nother. \u00a0Of meeting halfway and yet always\ntaking things all the way. \u00a0Of never\nleaving anything unfinished or unsaid. \nOf completing each other by being complete. \u00a0It was overly sweet and befitting of the two\nwho couldn\u2019t stop smiling at each other, even if Jungkook\u2019s face was almost the\ncolor of the flowers he held. \u00a0You kept\nstealing looks at Yoongi as the priest talked, relieved to see him smiling back\nat you, but you did look back at Jungkook when he handed Jimin the small\nbouquet he had walked in with. \u00a0The\naction had been completely his idea. \u00a0He\nhadn\u2019t cared at all, and Jimin had had no preference, about what type of flowers\nyou and Kimie thought would look best.</p><p><i>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s your job, not mine.\u201d</i> \u00a0But, naturally curious, he had asked why you\npicked peonies for them, and you had touched the soft petals in front of you\nthat you had brought to show them as you explained.</p><p><i>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI knew peonies were your flower the\nmoment I met you. \u00a0They can symbolize\nbashfulness. \u00a0But,\u201d</i>\nyou had said before Jungkook could contradict you, <i>\u201cthey can also mean compassion. \nIf that isn\u2019t Jimin, I don\u2019t know what is. \u00a0In addition, they stand for prosperity,\nspecifically in marriage. \u00a0I picked it\nfor you but then for Jimin and then for both of you. \u00a0It also can stand for someone bringing honor to\ntheir entire family through success, and you will. \u00a0You already have. \u00a0Jimin will be your family, and he will be yours,\nand you will be nothing but successful.\u201d\u00a0</i></p><p><i></i>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nIt was that, apparently, that made Jungkook think of passing or\nsharing the flower with Jimin, not only as a symbol of himself, but also to\nrepresent him giving himself and all his bashfulness to him. \u00a0You couldn\u2019t tease him for that, even if Hoseok\nhad, and you smiled to see Jimin receiving the flowers from Jungkook with his\nown smile even as they exchanged their vows. \nIt was strange, in a way. \u00a0Weddings\nare full of such small, seemingly meaningless or mundane actions and words, and\nyet said at that moment, done in that space, shared in front of your friends and\nfamily, they become lifechanging and binding. \nThe words Jimin and Jungkook spoke to each other were nothing new, even\nif they did put their own twist on the traditional vows shared between\nsoulmates. \u00a0Even this change was nothing\nnew, as a deviation from the norm was to be expected from the two. \u00a0But it seemed like the whole room held its\nbreath as the two spoke.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re\nmine.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cAnd\nyou are mine.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNow and always.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNo matter what the world says.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cUntil the world ends.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOr my soul stops.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You barely remembered to breathe even\nwhen they finished and kissed, a soft, chaste kiss that almost made Jungkook\nlook bashful again, though that was probably due to Hoseok whistling like a\nfrat boy at a keg stand behind him, because Yoongi was staring at you from\nacross the room, certainly not kissing you, and you felt incomplete and wrong,\nso much so that you stood up. \u00a0But Yoongi\nturned back to the piano, and everyone else was standing up, too, as Jimin and\nJungkook marched proudly back down the aisle. \nYou remembered to smile, because it was easy to, almost impossible not\nto as your friends passed you. \u00a0How could\nyou not smile at such happiness? \u00a0And you\nremembered to look back at Yoongi one last time before following the crowd back\nout, smiling at the way he was watching you leave. \u00a0Because, really, how could you not smile at\nthat?</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Being involved with the decorating\nhad its advantages, as you had had a say in who you got to sit next to. \u00a0You picked Kimie and her husband Kai,\nobviously, and Minghao and Jun. \u00a0The rest\nof Jimin\u2019s dance crew and Seth sat nearby. \u00a0An empty seat reserved for Yoongi was by you,\ntoo, though you doubted he would join the table for much of the evening. \u00a0He seemed to have teleported to the room and\nwas already set up at a small table with a studio\u2019s worth of sound equipment. \u00a0It looked much to over the top for a small\nwedding, but it was fun to see him work. \nWhile you saw him plenty of times at home concentrating hard on his\nwork, seeing him public was something new. \nHe was just as dedicated and passionate, perhaps even more so, and every\ntime you felt some weird sort of jealousy\u2014could you be jealous of music?\u2014it dissipated\nquickly only to be replaced with some weird sort of pride\u2014could you proud of\nYoongi? It\u2019s not like you had any part in what he was doing. \u00a0Still, it was hard to distract yourself from\nhim or with him. \u00a0You knew speaking to\nthe people at your table would be polite, but you just wanted to watch\nYoongi. \u00a0You also knew you should just go\nand talk to him if you wanted to, but you didn\u2019t want to distract him from his\nwork. \u00a0You also wanted to concentrate on\nJungkook and Jimin sitting next to Hoseok and Tae at the front of the\nroom. \u00a0There was just a little too much\nto concentrate on or to try not to concentrate on, and you eyed the alcohol\ntable wistfully, wanting something to help slow you down and dull your senses. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nYou\nresisted for a long time, thankfully, and were distracted by food and your\ntablemates. \u00a0Kimie and Kai had plenty to\nsay about Bomi and all of her antics, and Minghao and Jun had plenty to\ncomplain about from the company. \u00a0They\nquestioned you repetitively about why you hadn\u2019t been to the show yet, and you promised\nthem over and over again that you would. \nKimie, the busybody that she was, kept trying to get you to talk about\nYoongi, but her husband thankfully kept her in check, clearly more aware than\nshe was, or more caring, about how often you were glancing at Yoongi across the\nroom. \u00a0You stopped by your friends\u2019 table,\ntoo, but you didn\u2019t want to stay long. \u00a0You\nsaw them often, and you didn\u2019t want to hog their time. \u00a0Plus, Hoseok looked about ready to bring up\nthe conversation you wanted to avoid that Jungkook had been embarrassed about,\nand you weren\u2019t about to dive into that mess. \nSo you caught up with Seth and chatted about the shelter and met the\nrest of the guests with no expectation of remembering their names come\ntomorrow.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nBut\nby the time the dancing started, some fancy and rich but small meal nestled in\nyour belly, the lights dimmed and your desire to pout and wallow in self-pity returned. \u00a0As your tablemates got up in pairs to go\ndance, you merely sat and watched and sipped on the glass of wine that had somehow\nmade it to your table and into your hands. \nIt wasn\u2019t that you wanted to dance. \nYou really didn\u2019t know how to, certainly not like Jimin and Jungkook\nand, well, everyone else, seemed to know how to. \u00a0Dancing like everyone was doing was not so\nmuch about doing certain steps or even doing them correctly, but it was about\nbeing close. \u00a0This type of dancing, of leaning\nclose and resting a cheek on someone else\u2019s shoulder, was about intimacy, about\ntrust and a desire to simply belong to another person. \u00a0This type of dancing made your insides\nburn. \u00a0Or maybe that was the glass you\nfinished and refilled to avoid watching how content everyone looked on the\ndance floor.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nStill,\nyou turned back in toward the table and glowered a bit, an urge to pretend to\ntext someone coming over you. \u00a0You could\ngo on a quest for the bathroom or find something else to distract you with, but\nyou knew nothing was going to be enough. \nThe scraping of a chair nearby barely even caught your attention, though\nsomeone\u2019s hand refilling your glass was enough for you to look up.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHaving\na blast?\u201d Seth said casually with only a hint of sarcasm in his voice. \u00a0Unsure how to answer, you kept your mouth\nshut, and he put the bottle down slowly until you turned enough to look at\nhim. \u00a0\u201cDo you want to dance?\u201d he said\nonce you were, but you wrinkled your lips and brow in answer. \u00a0\u201cYeah, me either. \u00a0Just thought I\u2019d ask, though, as you looked\npretty bored.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cNot\nbored,\u201d you hummed, \u201cjust not much of a wedding person.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cMe\neither,\u201d Seth said, \u201cbut this one seems nice.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah,\nit turned out really pretty.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\nlook really pretty, too,\u201d he said, and you laughed, waving a hand at him before\nsipping on your drink again. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoongi\npicked it out. \u00a0I\u2019m pretty clueless when\nit comes to being fancy. \u00a0I feel pretty\nout of place.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\nlook it.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\ndon\u2019t look much better.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\ndon\u2019t disagree,\u201d Seth shrugged. \u00a0It\u2019s not\nthat he didn\u2019t look nice. \u00a0He cleaned up\nwell, but he clearly was someone unused to wearing tight, fitted, pressed\nshirts and ties practically strangling his neck. \u00a0You wondered if his sense of discomfort was\nanything akin to yours.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou,\nuh, didn\u2019t bring a date?\u201d you said, not sure how to simply ask outright if it\nwasn\u2019t just his clothes that made him feel out of place. \u00a0The idea made Seth laugh, though he didn\u2019t\nlook upset or annoyed.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cNah,\nno time for that right now. \u00a0Hey, can I\nask,\u201d he said, scooting his chair closer and leaning in a bit, \u201chow it\u2019s going with\nYoongi?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\nyou said eloquently, not sure if you were surprised by the question or his\nproximity or by how long it had been since you had looked over at the man in\nquestion or by how much you apparently had had to drink.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoongi. \u00a0 How\u2019s it going with him? \u00a0I only ask because I thought, when you left\nbefore Thanksgiving to go stay with him that you weren\u2019t too happy about\nit. \u00a0You seemed really sad to leave, but\nthen you didn\u2019t come back. \u00a0So I just\nwondered. \u00a0I mean, I assume it\u2019s going\nwell.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d\nyou said, sighing for some reason and sinking back into your chair, your\nposture surely not eloquent or attractive. \n\u201cYeah. \u00a0It\u2019s going well.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s\nit been like? \u00a0I mean, I\u2019m taking this\nclass on documented soulmate oddities. \nIt\u2019s so fascinating, and I told my professor about you. \u00a0She was, is, super interested. \u00a0So I just wondered what it\u2019s been like\nwithout being able to smell and all.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cSeth,\u201d\nyou said slowly as it seemed like he was getting riled up. \u00a0He rarely did, except on book club nights,\nand even then it was in pure ridiculousness. \n\u201cI\u2019d prefer if you didn\u2019t talk to other people about me.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOh,\nright. \u00a0I mean, I didn\u2019t say your\nname. \u00a0Purely from an academic\nstandpoint, it\u2019s an interesting case\u2014\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m\nnot a case study,\u201d you frowned, sitting up straight and putting your glass\ndown, suddenly needing your head to be clear. \n\u201cOr an experiment. \u00a0My experience\nisn\u2019t something to be documented or analyzed like some lab rat.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cNo,\nof course not,\u201d Seth backtracked, leaning closer on his knees. \u00a0\u201cBut don\u2019t you think you should tell your\nstory? \u00a0What if there are other people\nout there like you?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cThere\naren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\ndon\u2019t know that. \u00a0Look, Tae\u2019s whole point\nin starting the shelter was to help people with soulmate oddities. \u00a0The world doesn\u2019t accept them. \u00a0I just want to help. \u00a0I couldn\u2019t even believe I found this class to\nbegin with. \u00a0Some university in Sweden\nhas been studying oddities\u2014\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\ndon\u2019t like that word.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cSorry. \u00a0Unusual? \nNo, because there is no usual, not really. \u00a0Well, there is what society expects, and then\nthere are people who don\u2019t meet those expectations. \u00a0And that\u2019s not a bad thing,\u201d Seth\nemphasized. \u00a0\u201cSociety should change its\nexpectations, is my point. \u00a0Society\nshouldn\u2019t look down on you or treat you differently or anything. \u00a0But one way to help them stop doing that is\nto normalize the differences. \u00a0Everyone\nthinks things are a certain way because they\u2019ve been told that, they\u2019ve read\nthat. \u00a0If we tell them different stories,\nwrite down different stories, then maybe they\u2019ll stop being so, I don\u2019t know,\nignorant and awful.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nagree,\u201d you said slowly, because of course you did. \u00a0\u201cBut, my story, if you will, isn\u2019t over yet,\nso I don\u2019t think it\u2019s time to share it yet.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cFair\nenough,\u201d Seth said, finally leaning back and looking around the table for\nsomeone\u2019s drink to steal. \u00a0\u201cBut let me\nknow if you ever want to, yeah? \u00a0I mean,\nscientifically or psychologically, or whatever, it\u2019s fascinating. \u00a0But I also just care about you, you\nknow? \u00a0So I just want to make sure you\u2019re\nhappy with him and not feeling coerced.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cCoerced?\u201d\nyou said, frowning as Seth nodded.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah,\nlied to. \u00a0Manipulated. \u00a0I mean, he could be lying to you.\u201d \u00a0Despite your past thoughts and actions and\nwords, you felt yourself bristle.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nthought about that. \u00a0I thought that,\nhonestly, for a while, but I know now that he isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHow\ndo you know?\u201d Seth said, not trying to trick you or be mean, just genuine\ncuriosity and care in his tone. \u00a0\u201cI mean,\nif no one else can smell you and you can\u2019t smell him. \u00a0How do you know?\u201d \u00a0Reaching for a glass of water, you thought\nfor a moment before answering, looking out at the crowd.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHave\nyou met your soulmate yet?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cDo\nyou think you will one day?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nhope so. \u00a0I could live without her, or\nhim, but I know I would be glad to meet them.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cCould\nyou see yourself dating or being with someone even if they weren\u2019t your soulmate?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cTotally,\nI\u2019m not opposed to much,\u201d Seth shrugged, and you thoroughly believed him.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cAt\nsome point, they might tell you they loved you, right?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nhope so,\u201d Seth laughed softly, and you nodded, agreeing with his reaction.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cSo\nhow would you know, if they weren\u2019t your soulmate, that they loved you?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWell,\nI would just trust them. \u00a0Maybe know by\nhow they acted, too.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWell,\nthat\u2019s it then,\u201d you shrugged, smiling softly back at him. \u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s how I know Yoongi is telling the\ntruth.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cFair\nenough,\u201d Seth smiled back, lifting his\u2014or whoever\u2019s it was\u2014glass as a form of\nsalute toward you. \u00a0\u201cThen I am satisfied.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cGlad\nI could help,\u201d you said, laughing as you finished your glass of water. \u00a0The two of you sat in quiet for a bit before\nhe excused himself, saying something about wanting to check on Tae, and soon\nJun and Minghao slumped back into their seats, panting hard and fumbling to get\nwater into their glasses without making a mess. \nThe dance floor had become crowded as the music shied away from only\nslow-dancing, and the men were already sweaty, loosening their ties and leaving\ntheir blazers on the back of seats instead of clinging to their backs.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\nknow, for dancers, I would think you would have more stamina.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOh,\nno,\u201d Jun panted, \u201cthe opposite. \u00a0We dance\nso much, even a little bit more is like running five extra miles.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cStop\nexaggerating,\u201d Minghao laughed, slapping his partner on the back as Jun gulped\ndown water. \u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re just exhausted from\nall of the training plus shows. \u00a0No shame\nin being tired. \u00a0We still look better\nthan most of those fools out there.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cMing!\u201d\nJun gasped, smacking him in return, but Minghao just laughed, pointing at Ten\nand Taemin currently trying to out body roll each other next to Kai and Kimie who\nboth looked unperturbed. \u00a0Realizing he\nwas just talking about their ridiculous friends, Jun joined in in laughing at\nthem, especially when Tae and Hoseok joined in, entrapping unsuspecting and\ninnocent bystanders just trying to have a little harmless fun and exposing them\nto their shameless sensual twists and turns. \nHaving someone sitting with you at the table calmed your nerves a\nlittle, though part of you was still itching to move or leave or do\nsomething. \u00a0When Jun got up, mumbling\nsomething about finding more water, you sat next to Minghao as he smiled and\nhummed while watching his friends.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHey,\nMinghao, could I ask you a question?\u201d you finally said, eyeing the way Jimin\nand Jungkook were dancing slowly and closely, more rocking and whispering into\neach other\u2019s ears, despite the upbeat tempo and grinding of bodies all around\nthem.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOf\ncourse.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\nknow Yoongi? \u00a0The guy DJing over there?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah,\nof course I know Min Yoongi,\u201d he laughed, not even needing to look.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nwas wondering\u2014well, there\u2019s this girl at the shelter who can smell everyone\u2019s\nsoulmate scent.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOh,\nwow,\u201d Minghao breathed, his smile fading. \n\u201cWait, like me?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cNot\nquite. \u00a0Tae explained it like she smells\neveryone\u2019s, so she thinks everyone is her soulmate.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOh,\nwow,\u201d Minghao said again, his eyes going impossibly wide. \u00a0\u201cShit. \nFuck. \u00a0That\u2019s. \u00a0Wow, that must be awful.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\ndon\u2019t know,\u201d you shrugged. \u00a0\u201cI mean, I\nimagine so. \u00a0Not exactly easy to deal\nwith. \u00a0I just thought, maybe some day, if\nyou have time, after the show and everything, that you could talk to her? \u00a0You\u2019re the only person I know who could probably\nrelate to her at all.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOh,\nyeah, wow, I\u2019d love to,\u201d the man said, clapping his hands over his thighs, some\nbubble of excitement over the prospect growing within him. \u00a0\u201cWow, poor girl. \u00a0Yes, please tell her I will.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nwill,\u201d you smiled. \u00a0\u201cBut I was also\nwondering, well, she said Yoongi smelled like Christmas, and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d\nMinghao said, his smile fading and his face instantly serious.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d\nhe said again as you frowned.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\ndidn\u2019t even ask anything.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nknow what you\u2019re going to ask. \u00a0Everyone\nasks. \u00a0But I\u2019m not going to tell you what\nhe smells like. \u00a0The last time I did that\u201d\u2014his\ngaze searched the room until it fell on Jungkook and Jimin\u2014\u201cI almost ruined something\ngood for one of my dear friends, so no.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cBut\nyou didn\u2019t,\u201d you persisted. \u00a0\u201cYou helped. \u00a0You helped make this day happen, in fact.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cThe\nanswer is still no.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cBut\u2014\u201d\nyou said, sounding desperate.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t\nknowing he smells like Christmas enough?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat? \u00a0No,\u201d you huffed, crossing your arms over your\nchest. \u00a0\u201cCouldn\u2019t that be a thousand different\nsmells?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWhy\ndoes it matter to you, anyway? \u00a0You can\u2019t\nsmell him,\u201d Minghao said. \u00a0He shut his\nlips the second it was out of them, but it was already too late. \u00a0They opened again immediately as he surged\nforward. \u00a0\u201cShit, I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\ndid. \u00a0And you\u2019re right. \u00a0It\u2019s okay. \nForget I asked, or, almost asked,\u201d you said, standing up.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cY/N,\nseriously, I shouldn\u2019t have said that, I\u2019m sorry, I just don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nget it,\u201d you sighed, even if you didn\u2019t really. \u00a0If you couldn\u2019t smell him, why was it such a\nbig deal to just confirm or deny what someone else said he smelled like? \u00a0But Minghao was right. \u00a0It shouldn\u2019t matter to you what Yoongi\nsmelled like, since you couldn\u2019t smell him, anyway. \u00a0But to be reminded so quickly and bluntly\nwhen you were already feeling a little untethered and insecure did nothing to\nhelp your insecurities. \u00a0Standing up only\nmade it all worse, as the world seemed to spin a bit as you fought to steady\nyourself, reaching out for nothing until your own two feet started to move\ntoward something. \u00a0You weren\u2019t sure, and\nyet you knew exactly where they were heading, and you all but tripped or fell,\nwishing you weren\u2019t so tipsy and clumsy, into Yoongi\u2019s arms not even halfway to\nwhere you had last seen him, hiding behind some computer screen and adjusting\nthe sound as everyone else danced the night away.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d\nhe said into your hair, his arms already wrapping around you, steadying you and\nguiding you all at the same time. \u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s\nget some air.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nYou\ndidn\u2019t really want or need any air unless it was what he was sharing with you,\nso you followed him, no, walked with him, outside.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cThe\nmusic,\u201d you mumbled half-heartedly, but he only chuckled and pulled you closer,\namazing you at his ability to not trip or let you trip even though not one of\nyour four legs combined were walking in a straight line out the doors.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nset up a list. \u00a0I\u2019m not even needed.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s\nnot true,\u201d you sighed into his chest, feeling like he must surely be carrying\nyou or you were both floating because you were moving still despite how much\nyou were clinging to him. \u00a0\u201cI need you.\u201d \u00a0He merely hummed in reply, but it went\nstraight through your hair and into your scalp and sent goosebumps all over\nyour skin, though that may have simply been the winter air. \u00a0\u201cCold,\u201d you gasped as you suddenly realized\nyou didn\u2019t have a coat on.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah,\nI didn\u2019t think this through,\u201d Yoongi laughed, hugging you tighter. \u00a0The warmth radiating off of his chest did\nhelp, but your legs and arms were chilled exponentially. \u00a0As he fumbled to open the door to get back\ninside, you couldn\u2019t help but laugh into his chest, the whole scene warming you\neven more, though not as much as when you finally did get back inside, both of\nyou breathing and shuddering in relief at how warm it was inside. \u00a0Still, he didn\u2019t lead you back into the room\nwhere everyone was. \u00a0You could hear the\nmusic, still, even if some words sounded slurred and the bass was louder than\nanything else. \u00a0There was no need to hold\nonto Yoongi anymore, but you still did.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cAre\nyou having a good time?\u201d he said softly, and if he meant at that moment, you\nknew the answer was a resounding yes, but you shifted a little to look up at\nhim.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHonestly?\u201d\nyou said, waiting for him to nod. \u00a0\u201cYes. \u00a0Everything seemed to go smoothly, and Jimin\nand Jungkook look so happy, and everything is beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cBut?\u201d\nYoongi said for you, hearing it already in your voice.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\nselfish,\u201d you said, hiding your face back in his chest. \u00a0He let you for a moment, perhaps thinking you\nwould tell him without any prompting, but you swayed back and forth enough\ntimes for him to finally nudge your shoulder. \n\u201cIt\u2019s stupid. \u00a0It doesn\u2019t matter\nnow,\u201d you muttered.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nsee,\u201d he said, his tone clearly not convinced. \n\u201cWell, I\u2019m having a great time, too, if you want to know.\u201d \u00a0Realizing how rude you were being, how truly\nselfish you were, you lifted your head up to apologize, but Yoongi was only\nsmiling. \u00a0\u201cBut I realize I would have\npreferred sitting with you.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOh. \u00a0Oh?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOh\nis right,\u201d Yoongi chuckled, his thumbs barely moving up and down in tiny\nmotions on your back. \u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s never\nhappened before. \u00a0And I\u2019m not\ncomplaining. \u00a0I didn\u2019t think about it, when\nI told Jungkook I\u2019d help. \u00a0I just\nthought, hey, music, I can do that. \u00a0I\nwant to do that. \u00a0I love doing that. \u00a0I didn\u2019t think about how hard it would be to not\nbe able to be by you, to whisper about how good the place looked or about how\nhappy the boys seem. \u00a0I don\u2019t really care\nfor big social events, so I didn\u2019t think it would matter, not sitting by you at\ndinner and refilling your glass and making sure you had everything you needed. \u00a0I didn\u2019t know a wedding would make me so\nsappy, but it\u2019s been really hard to concentrate all day, because I just want to\ntake care of you, and seeing you sitting alone was a sight I loathe, absolutely\nhate. \u00a0You should never, ever be alone unless\nyou want to be, you know? \u00a0Like, if you\nneed space or something. \u00a0But otherwise,\nI should always be right beside you.\u201d \nYoongi slowed down as you looked up at him, your mouth slightly\nopened. \u00a0You thought, for a moment, that\nhe must be suddenly reading your mind and revealing everything that you had\nbeen feeling for hours, which was, of course, absurd, but still. \u00a0\u201cIs that pathetic?\u201d he said with a crooked\nsmile, causing you to shake your head adamantly.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cNo! \u00a0No.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cThen\nyou\u2019re not, either,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHow\ndid\u2014\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\ncould say something about being your soulmate and thus being able to read your\nmind or something,\u201d Yoongi almost chuckled, \u201cbut I don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s as deep\nas that. \u00a0You just\u2014you\u2019ve gotten easy to\nread, is all, so I could tell. \u00a0And,\nbesides, no one likes to be alone, much less on a wedding. \u00a0Being single at a wedding is the absolute\nworse. \u00a0Trust me, I know. \u00a0I wanted to die at Namjoon and Jin\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoongi,\nyou shouldn\u2019t joke about that.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cRight. \u00a0No, I know, sorry. \u00a0But, I mean, it makes you feel incredibly\nlonely and depressed. \u00a0Or it makes me\nfeel that way. \u00a0And I was standing over\nthere, pushing buttons on a computer thinking how it didn\u2019t have to be that\nway. \u00a0You were literally right across the\nroom from me. \u00a0Will you be mad if I was\nkind of waiting to see if you could come up to me first?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\nwere busy working!\u201d you scoffed, hitting his arm lightly. \u00a0\u201cI was waiting for you to notice how unhappy\nI was and come make it all better. \u00a0What\nare we, twelve? \u00a0Isn\u2019t that sad?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cIf\nit is, then we\u2019re just pathetic with each other,\u201d Yoongi laughed.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cFor\neach other, yeah,\u201d you said teasingly, but Yoongi went a little stiff, and you\nlooked up again at him to see him staring at you seriously. \u00a0\u201cWhat?\u201d \n</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cDo\nyou mean that?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nyou repeated, looking around uneasily.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cDo\nyou really mean you\u2019re pathetic for me?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoongi,\u201d\nyou whined, not liking how teasing his voice was becoming.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cDo\nyou want to slow dance under the moonlight with me?\u201d \u00a0His hands moved to your hips as he started to\nsway back and forth, bringing your body with him easily for a moment.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoongi,\u201d\nyou tried to complain, but instead you just put your arms over his shoulders,\nfeeling even more like a twelve-year-old at some middle school dance with no\nexperience and no idea of how to handle the flurry of bugs threatening to erupt\nout of you like some flesh-eating alien.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cDo\nyou want to cuddle and watch stupid movies just as an excuse to be close to me?\u201d\nhe said, pulling you closer with a hand on your back so abruptly that you\nalmost squeaked in surprise when your hips collided. \u00a0He simply looked down at you for a moment as\nhe continued to move his feet in tiny patterns as you followed him effortlessly\nand wordlessly. \u00a0This wasn\u2019t dancing, it\nwas simply being, and even though you could still feel the cold from the door\nnearby, you felt yourself warming up as a comfortable heat crept up your neck.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoongi,\u201d\nyou said slowly, searching his face for something. \u00a0He was doing the same to you, and you weren\u2019t\nsure what he was after or wanted, but you were absolutely positive you would\ngive it to him if he simply asked or even told you. \u00a0When his head moved, yours did, too, tilting\nas you craned your neck to give him enough room. \u00a0He fit against you so well, always a little\nbehind your ear and a little close to your collarbone, but mostly just flush\nagainst your cheek and neck, and your arms went a little limp when his fingers\nwrapped around the other side or your neck to help position you a bit better.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cDo\nyou want to kiss me,\u201d he breathed, even as he did so, the mere side of his lips\ntouching your skin so faintly that you almost wanted to turn your head just to\nfeel the rest of them, \u201cuntil we\u2019re both breathless and desperate for more?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cY-Yoongi.\u201d \u00a0You almost gasped, like the pathetic, totally-gone-for-Yoongi\nperson you were, your fingers slipping to his collar purely to have something\nto hold onto. \u00a0Nothing he was doing was\nnew. \u00a0You were used to him rubbing his\ncheek against yours. \u00a0You were used to\nhim whispering things into your ear that may have embarrassed you at one point\nbut now only made you feel safe and wanted and longing for more. \u00a0You were used to the kisses on your neck or\nbehind your ear or along your collarbone that always stayed in the same area\nbut sent a shock through your entire body. \nBut you were used to Yoongi always initiating and acting. \u00a0You never reciprocated, and something twisted\nin your gut akin to regret and guilt, like you had messed up and had been\nhurting him by never giving back to him. \nYou weren\u2019t used to acting upon what you wanted or asking for what you\nwanted or simply taking what you wanted, either, so you were more surprised\nthan Yoongi was when you pushed back against his cheek and mumbled his name\nagain as you sank down onto his shoulder, rubbing your nose over the small\nspace of skin you could find above his collar. \nYour fingers dug into his shirt and tried to move the affronting\nmaterial out of the way because you suddenly felt desperate to find something,\nanything, even though you trembled all the while, knowing you weren\u2019t going to\nfind anything.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cDo\nyou want to smell me?\u201d Yoongi whispered, his mouth so close to your ear that\nhis words made you gasp and then groan in frustration even as you nodded against\nhis neck, searching and searching hopelessly. \n</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cShit,\nYoongi,\u201d you choked on nothing, on nothing but air and the lack of it, the absence\nof anything but pure, clean, unscented air flowing through your airway that felt\ntoxic and unclean and wrong, wrong, wrong.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cY/N,\u201d\nhe said so slowly and calmly and yet so clearly on the edge of desperation\u2014for what?\nfor you? \u00a0or for you?\u2014that you couldn\u2019t\nstop the desperate tears from pooling in your eyes that found themselves transferred\nto his skin as you tried again to find the rest of him. \u00a0Christmas? \nWhat did Christmas smell like? \nWhat did he smell like? \u00a0\u201cFuck,\nhold on, babe, I\u2019m sorry, I have to take you home. \u00a0Can we do that? \u00a0Can we go home?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah,\nyeah,\u201d you mumbled, not caring about anything but finding his scent. \u00a0Perhaps it was buried underneath his shirt or\nunderneath his skin. \u00a0Perhaps if you just\nsearched all over him, you would find it.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cY/N,\nhold on,\u201d he said gently as he took a giant breath, the air running over your neck\nas it rushed into his mouth. \u00a0The kiss he\nplaced on your neck was probably meant to calm you down, to be some promise of\nmore to come, but it only made you cling to him tighter as he tried to pull\naway. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he\nmumbled, running his fingers through your hair and placing his hands over yours. \u00a0\u201cI-we-have to pack up my stuff, then we can\ngo. \u00a0Okay?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cPlease?\u201d\nyou said to him, or to his scent, or to the universe, desperate for him to not\nlet go.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOkay,\nokay,\u201d he said, his hand on your back as his head moved back and forth as he\nthought. \u00a0You hadn\u2019t let go of him, and\nyou really didn\u2019t plan to, even as he managed to pull out his phone and call\nsomeone, the low drone of someone on the other end unrecognizable to you and\nunappealing. \u00a0You barely registered what\nYoongi was saying, though you did notice the way he stuttered and sucked in a\nbreath when you finally, finally started to mouth at his neck.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nHe\ndidn\u2019t taste like anything, not really, which you knew was a mistake, which you\nknew was wrong. \u00a0Except it wasn\u2019t, really. \u00a0You were the mistake. \u00a0You were wrong. \u00a0You knew he smelled like something\u2014what does\nChristmas smell like?\u2014and you knew he must therefore taste like something\u2014Christmas?\nLike those candy canes? Fruit cake? What did people eat at Christmas?\u2014but it was\nnothing, there was nothing, just smooth, warm skin that you were determined to\nfind something in.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cY/N,\u201d\nYoongi\u2019s voice brought you a back a little, though you still didn\u2019t leave his\nneck alone until he pulled on your ear lightly but enough for you to blink and\nlet go of him until his hands cupped your face and brought it front of his\nown. \u00a0\u201cYou with me?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nwant to smell you,\u201d you said, barely aware of the tears covering your\nface. \u00a0\u201cI-I want to do all that.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nknow, babe, me too. \u00a0Let\u2019s go home and we\ncan do whatever want, okay?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d\nyou said shakily, because it wasn\u2019t quite okay. \nYou were sure you could do everything and anything you wanted with and\nto him, but you couldn\u2019t smell him, and you weren\u2019t sure if anything else was\ngoing to be enough. \u00a0\u201cOkay,\u201d you nodded\nagain, though, because you had to let go of him so you could walk, and you panicked\nfor a moment that he was going to take you back into the main room where\neveryone would see how much of a mess you had suddenly become, though in\nreality it had been building up for hours or days or years, but he dragged you\nright past the hall, the music temporarily becoming louder as you passed the\nopen doors.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cStay\nhere for just a second?\u201d he said gently, placing you against a wall and waiting\nfor you to nod before he let go. \u00a0You did\nnot count the seconds he was gone, but he was back in a flash with nothing but\nyours and his coat. \u00a0He helped you into\nyours before putting his own on before sticking his hand out to you that you\ntook gratefully. \u00a0You end up clinging to\nhis entire arm, but he didn\u2019t seem to mind.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYour\nequipment?\u201d you said as he walked you outside, but he simply shrugged.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cCalled\nSeihoon, one of my sound techs. \u00a0He\u2019ll\ncome pack it all up.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cAre\nyou sure?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m\nthe boss. \u00a0Of course I\u2019m sure. \u00a0I ignored you for long enough.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\ndidn\u2019t. \u00a0You weren\u2019t, really. \u00a0I think, no, I know, if I really needed you,\nyou would have been by me in a heartbeat. \nYou were watching out for me. \u00a0I\nwas just wallowing a bit. \u00a0I didn\u2019t feel\nignored, just a little needy.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\nokay to be needy. \u00a0I\u2019ll give you whatever\nyou need,\u201d Yoongi said assuredly, raising the hand he was holding to his mouth\nto kiss along your knuckles. \u00a0You merely\nnodded, because you believed him. \u00a0You\njust knew, based on what he was saying and based on his past actions, that he\nwas telling the truth. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nBut\nyou also knew that he could never give you what you felt like you really\nneeded. \u00a0Still, you climbed in the car\nafter him and sat as close to him as possible, because if you couldn\u2019t smell\nhim, you would take whatever else you could get, and the quiet that fell as you\ndrove home, the urge and desperation fading into something more like\ncontentment and peace, was almost enough because you shared it with him.</p><p><br/></p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Seokjin knew he was difficult. \u00a0Not necessarily difficult to please. \u00a0Just. \nDifficult. \u00a0He was a child in an\nadult\u2019s body, Yoongi once said, and he had meant it as an insult. \u00a0Seokjin was easily upset and riled up. \u00a0He was defiant sometimes to the point of\nbeing bratty. \u00a0He was picky and liked\nthings to be done a certain way. \u00a0He had\ngained a lot of real confidence, not just faking it when he felt insecure, over\nthe years and was willing to fight anyone who tried to argue with him.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But he was also extremely polite and\nrespectful. \u00a0All of his staff had always\nsaid so. \u00a0He had worked with countless of\nother actors and singers and models by this point in his career, and they always\nall agreed he had a humility like no other. \nHe was selfless and thought of others, always wanting to make sure they\nwere fed and taken care of. \u00a0He listened\nto the concern of all his employees, even down to the janitors, so he knew he\nwasn\u2019t all bad.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0So he was humble enough to know that\nY/N may have been right about needing to apologize to Yoongi, but stubborn enough\nto know that Yoongi wasn\u2019t completely innocent; it took two people to be in a\nrelationship, two people to create conflict, two people to not resolve things,\ntwo people to want to try again.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But it was bothering him. \u00a0It bothered him, for some unknown reason he\ncouldn\u2019t wrap his head around, to see Yoongi so happy. \u00a0He had no reason to be jealous; nothing about\nNamjoon ever left him unsatisfied. \nSeokjin may be hard to please, but Namjoon did nothing but please\nhim. \u00a0He felt a little faulty, though,\nlike a soulmate gone wrong, when he felt a twinge of remorse. \u00a0Some odd feeling of knowing he and Yoongi had\nbeen happy together for a while slipping away. \nHe wondered if they had ever been happy, or if it had merely been a\npre-courser, some fake form of happiness that wouldn\u2019t quite do in the long\nrun, that they both knew wouldn\u2019t last but was only getting them ready for the\nreal deal. \u00a0And when Seokjin had found\nthe real deal in Namjoon, Yoongi had had to wait for years until Y/N came\nalong, and Seokjin had to watch him suffer and hurt and push people away for\nall that time. \u00a0So he wasn\u2019t jealous, and\nhe knows he doesn\u2019t regret what happened, because it brought him to Namjoon,\nbut he was sad. \u00a0Sad that it took so long\nfor Yoongi to finally be as happy as Seokjin has been for years now. \u00a0He knows Yoongi\u2019s been happy, as his music\nmakes him extremely so like nothing else can, but it all seems pale in\ncomparison to how he looks now. \u00a0He never\ngot to see Yoongi look like that, and he knows it\u2019s no fault of his own. \u00a0He\u2019s not jealous. \u00a0He wasn\u2019t. \nBut he felt unsettled, still, and not just because Namjoon was\nsnoring. \u00a0He was used to that. \u00a0It happened every night, after all, and\ncouldn\u2019t be helped by this point. \nSomeone else might find it annoying, but it was endearing to Seokjin. \u00a0It was his white noise, a rhythm to rock him\nto sleep, his assurance that Namjoon was there and proof that he was sleeping\nsoundly beside him. \u00a0He would have felt\nbad for waking him up as he rolled over, but he knew Namjoon wouldn\u2019t care. \u00a0Knew he would wake up in a heartbeat if he\nfelt like Seokjin needed him.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cJoon. \u00a0Joon? \nJoonie!\u201d \u00a0So maybe it took him a\nminute to wake up, and another minute to realize who was waking him up, but he\nstill did, and even though Namjoon couldn\u2019t hurt a crab, he looked ready to\nfight.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWh-what? \u00a0What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNothing, you big baby,\u201d Seokjin\nsaid, patting his chest so he would lie back down.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhy am I awake then?\u201d \u00a0Seokjin waited until Namjoon fell back into\nhim, his freakishly long arms and legs flopping onto him dramatically. \u00a0Seokjin let out a dramatic breath of air in return,\neven though he was the one who started it.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDo you think I\u2019m a dick?\u201d \u00a0The rustling and rearranging stilled as\nNamjoon blinked, his lashes tickling Seokjin\u2019s skin.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhy are you asking that?\u201d Namjoon\nsaid, because of course he would. \u00a0There\nwere no simply yes or no answers with Namjoon, and even though Seokjin sighed,\nhe appreciated it. \u00a0Namjoon made him\nthink about everything that he did, and he wanted to explain himself to him. \u00a0Hardly ever to anyone else, but Namjoon was\ndifferent. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t even a soulmate\nthing; Namjoon just loved figuring people out.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSomething Y/N said. \u00a0About me hurting Yoongi.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s broad and vague all at the\nsame time. \u00a0Is there something specific\nshe said you did?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cShe said I told Yoongi that he was\nlucky to date me and that I told him when we broke up that no one would ever\nlove him.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDid you say all that?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI,\u201d Seokjin mumbled, buying some\ntime by running his hands up and down Namjoon\u2019s arm and back, whatever parts of\nhim he could reach. \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t\nremember. \u00a0Does it sound like something I\nwould say?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHonestly?\u201d Namjoon chuckled, the\npuffs of air tickling Seokjin. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sure\nyou\u2019ve said worse to him. \u00a0But most of\nthe time you\u2019re just messing with him. \nYour weird YoonJin language.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYoonJin? \u00a0I haven\u2019t heard that in a long time,\u201d Seokjin\nlaughed, as much as he could with Namjoon on his ribcage.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYour crazy fans and their crazy\nship names.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t remind me,\u201d Seokjin hummed.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBut he\u2019s always been able to tell\nmore than you when someone\u2019s not teasing.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHey, he said mean things, too.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah, but you always knew when he\nwas purposefully being mean. \u00a0He\u2019s much\nmore blunt than you are, and you know it. \nYou\u2019re super passive aggressive when you want to be.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2014I am,\u201d Seokjin sighed. \u00a0There was no use denying it. \u00a0\u201cSo,\u201d he said after a moment, twirling\nNamjoon\u2019s hair between his fingers. \u00a0He\nshould dye his hair before they left. \n\u201cWas I a dick?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes, Seokjin. \u00a0A lot. \nYou two were terrible for and with and to each other. \u00a0You know this. \u00a0He knows this. \u00a0We\u2019ve been over this. \u00a0Why the renewed interest?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cJust what Y/N said, about how I\nshould apologize to him.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cJin,\u201d Namjoon said seriously,\nrising up to stare down at Seokjin. \u00a0Some\nof Namjoon\u2019s stares Seokjin loved. \u00a0He\nloved when Namjoon would get all soft-eyed when he looked at him. \u00a0He would stare like no one would notice. \u00a0He blinked slowly as if he didn\u2019t want to\nmiss anything Seokjin did. \u00a0He would get\nserious and stare when he wanted to pay attention and let Seokjin know he\nmattered. \u00a0He would sometimes, though,\ngive Seokjin a look that Seokjin knew all too well. \u00a0It was the\nyou-know-you\u2019re-wrong-but-I-think-you\u2019re-capable-of-admitting-it-yourself-before-I-tell-you\nlook. \u00a0Seokjin wasn\u2019t a fan of this one. \u00a0It made him squirm and groan and grow\nembarrassed and a little bit angry even if Namjoon was right.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou never apologized?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t remember saying any of\nthat! \u00a0It was years ago!\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cJin. \u00a0Jin,\u201d Namjoon said softer. \u00a0Seokjin risked looking at him, and thankfully\nthe look was gone, replaced by something a little sadder. \u00a0\u201cYou know how Yoongi never forgets, like,\nanything.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cUnfortunately, I do.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSo, if you remembered, would you\napologize? \u00a0If you could, would you say\nit again?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThen apologize.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cEven if\u2014\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cEven if,\u201d Namjoon said, putting his\nhead back on his own pillow and pulling Seokjin into his chest. \u00a0He let himself be moved until no one\u2019s arm\nwas being slept on and felt himself grow sleepy again as they both settled\ndown. \u00a0Still, he waited until Namjoon\u2019s\nlittle snores rumbled through his chest again before he closed his own eyes,\nalready running the conversation with Yoongi over and over in his head. \u00a0There was no way to come out on top of it,\nbut Seokjin never really cared about beating Yoongi or being better than\nhim. \u00a0He already knew, in many ways, that\nhe was. \u00a0In other ways, Yoongi would\nalways be superior. \u00a0Seokjin could admit\nthat. \u00a0He could admit that he was wrong,\ntoo. \u00a0And if that helped Yoongi to be\nhappy, truly happy, happy like he never was with Seokjin, then Seokjin was more\nthan willing to help that happen.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Hoseok sometimes felt bad for his\nneighbors. \u00a0He wasn\u2019t exactly what one\nmight call a quiet person, but he figured that his positive energy and friendliness\nbalanced out. \u00a0Everyone knew him even if\nhe couldn\u2019t remember their names, and on more than one occasion someone had\nknocked on his door asking for help to move something or find a cat or \u201cborrow\u201d\nsugar or something, and he was always more than happy to oblige. \u00a0So he didn\u2019t feel an ounce of remorse as he\nand Tae tramped up the stairs as loud as a horde of elephants. \u00a0He wasn\u2019t ashamed at how they were laughing\nas loud as hyenas, either, as they stumbled into the walls while he fumbled to\nopen his door as Tae leaned on him and tried to catch his breath.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0To the untrained eye, the pair would\nsurely look drunk. \u00a0And Hoseok felt a little\nlightheaded, but, not to be cheesy or anything, he was just high on\nhappiness. \u00a0Not high. \u00a0That word made him think of actually getting\nhigh, which he had only done once, or, tried to do, but had promptly fallen\nasleep after taking one hit. \u00a0So, not high,\nas he didn\u2019t know what that felt like, but light, floaty, almost, like he could\njust fly away by how carefree he felt. \nWhich is saying something, because Hoseok is almost always\ncarefree. \u00a0But tonight, tonight, he\u2019s\njust, he\u2019s just. \u00a0He doesn\u2019t know. \u00a0He\u2019s happy. \nThat\u2019s all.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Happy, to see his best friend so\nhappy, happy, to see how two lives can merge together, happy, to know everything\nwas only going to get better from here, happy, to have Tae coming home with\nhim.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He was happy at how Tae had changed\nsince they actually started talking about their relationship more\u2014I know, what\na concept, doi. \u00a0He was happy by how much\ncloser they obviously were because of it\u2014wow, who would have thought talking\ncould do that? \u00a0He was happy with finding\nlittle bits of Tae all around his apartment, even if he usually liked keeping\nthings extremely clean. \u00a0He was happy with\nthe way Tae was catching onto his mood and he was getting better at reading\nTae\u2019s. \u00a0He was happy that they could\ntouch, and did touch, almost all the time wherever they went. \u00a0He was happy to know Tae didn\u2019t shy away from\nsuch displays and actually wanted them himself. \nHe was happy, even if he would never by the man\u2019s soulmate, to be with\nhim.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And, if he was forced to admit it,\nhe was happy with the sex, okay? \u00a0It was\nintense in all the right ways. \u00a0Tae was\nintense. \u00a0He sometimes got this look on\nhis face that almost scared Hoseok, and he had jumped and screamed a little in\nsurprise\u2014he\u2019s man enough to admit\u2014on more than one occasion when Tae randomly\nbit him or spanked him without any precursor. \nAnd he had gone still, too, which is pretty impressive considering how\nmuch he is always moving, more than once when Tae suddenly touched him like he\nwas made of glass or whispered so softly in his ear how much he loved him. \u00a0He loved those moments, all of those moments,\nbecause, if nothing else, Tae kept Hoseok on his toes, and even if he thought\nhe had seen and heard everything from the man, he continued to be surprised and\nimpressed.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The first time Tae had said \u201cI love\nhim,\u201d though, Hoseok hadn\u2019t necessarily reacted as one might hope or\nexpect. \u00a0He\u2019d, well, uh, accidentally\nflailed a bit and elbowed Tae so hard in the ribs he had a bruise the next day. \u00a0There had been a lot of squawking, if Hoseok\nremembers correctly, and profuse apologizing even though Tae laughed it off\nlike he did most things. \u00a0In hindsight,\nHoseok has been able to laugh about it, too, and is fine with Tae teasing him\nover and over again by warning him beforehand he\u2019s going to say it or covering\nhis chest awkwardly and obviously before he says it. \u00a0It never seems to take anything away from the\nmoment, though. \u00a0Love, in Hoseok\u2019s mind,\nis often too serious. \u00a0Or people try to\nmake it so. \u00a0The movies have an epic\nswell in the music when someone finally confesses. \u00a0It\u2019s pouring down torrential rain as if it\u2019s\nsuddenly a life or death situation. \u00a0The\nwords are said and suddenly everyone is crying and gnashing their teeth and\npulling out their hair because finally, finally someone loves meeeeee!</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Love should be carefree. \u00a0Light. \nHappy. \u00a0Hilarious. \u00a0And full of awkward human moments. \u00a0So Hoseok loved how much Tae and he laughed even\nwhen trying to lose themselves in the throes of passion. \u00a0He loved how gross morning breath was when\nthey kissed. \u00a0He loved how Tae would\nsputter when Hoseok introduced him as his boyfriend to random strangers who\ndefinitely did not ask. \u00a0He loved how\nthey still fumbled to undress each other and laughed when one of them tried to\nbe \u201ctoo sexy\u201d and couldn\u2019t stay in character for whatever nonsense they had\nplanned. \u00a0He loved that they were\nfiguring each other out, what they liked and disliked, what they needed and\nwanted, what they preferred and could endure. \nHe loved each opportunity to get to know Tae more and to grow closer to\nhim, and he knew Tae felt the same.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0So, stumbling into his apartment and\nkicking off their shoes\u2014that he would fix later into neat little rows when he\ngot up to pee or get a glass of water or something because he\u2019s not OCD but\nshit, there\u2019s no need to be so flippant when it comes to a little order in\none\u2019s house\u2014really felt like coming home. \nPulling on each other\u2019s belt loops and smashing a little too hard into\nthe kitchen counter on the way to the bedroom so Tae could suck on Hoseok\u2019s\nneck\u2014an action that sounds ridiculous and even humorous, as Hoseok first\nthought, too, as he laughed when he tilted his head back, but, as always, he\nstarted to get warm and wanted to pull Tae closer the second his lips were on\nhim\u2014was commonplace, so much so that Hoseok never left anything glass on any\ncountertops or tables anymore for fear of breaking something in the middle of making\nout. \u00a0Trying to race each other to the\nbedroom and see who could undress the other first\u2014Hoseok always, always won,\nand he\u2019d like to think he\u2019s just that good with his hands, but Tae seemed to\nlet him win every time because Hoseok had figured out that secretly Tae like\nhaving someone else peel his shirt off and pull his pants down and leave him\nthere to shiver for a few seconds\u2014seemed like second nature at this point.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And, on most nights, pulling each\nother into bed and roaming all over each other and never letting the other go\nwould be expected. \u00a0It was hard to resist\neach other when they were in full display for the other, standing or sitting or\nlying there in waiting, inches and inches of tan skin waiting to be touched and\nkissed, to be worshiped and loved. \u00a0It\nwas what Hoseok expected, even, because something about going to a wedding\nalways made him remember how much he loved love, and he loved Tae. \u00a0He told him as often as he could. \u00a0Loved how Tae seemed to have no trouble\nsaying it to him but still blushed a little when Hoseok reciprocated. \u00a0So to take him to bed and, as someone more\ncrass might say, have his way with him, seemed like the most viable option,\nlike the right choice.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nBut\nhe slowed down once Tae was naked before him. \nThey were always too busy to be bothered with any lights, but even in\nthe darkness, Hoseok could see him. \u00a0He\nknew how strong he was beneath his soft layer of skin. \u00a0He knew how kind he was even when he had a\nmischievous glint in his eye. \u00a0He knew\nhow hard he worked to help others and yet how much he loved, at the end of the\nday, when he was tired or overwhelmed, being taken care of.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And Hoseok didn\u2019t know, could never\nknow, what it must be like to see your soulmate get married to someone\nelse. \u00a0If Tae and Jimin were anyone else,\nhe figured it would have broken Tae. \u00a0So\neven though he knew the two soulmates loved each other, and he knew Tae supported\nJimin and always would, he imagined Tae might be a little hurt even with how\nmuch he smiled and danced and laughed at the wedding. \u00a0He knew he might be feeling a little lost and\nleft out and inadequate and lonely and incomplete and hopeless and scared and\nworried about his own future. \u00a0He might,\njust might, if Hoseok is feeling extra brave to consider, have been looking to\nHoseok so much the whole day for reassurance. \nHe might have been watching him to try to catch a glimpse of something,\nsome spark of hope that one day it might be them getting married. \u00a0And Hoseok would be damned if he wasn\u2019t going\nto do everything he could to make sure Tae had nothing to worry about, to make\nsure he knew he was loved and valued and appreciated and enough, more than\nenough.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m going to take care of you,\u201d\nHoseok said firmly even though it came out as a whisper. \u00a0It must have surprised Tae, whether because\nhe always seemed a little surprised when Hoseok said such words or because the\nchange in speed and volume of everything gave him a little whiplash, because he\ngrew still and quiet, so Hoseok waited as he took his hand until Tae nodded\nbefore leading him to the bathroom. \u00a0He\nsmiled at him as Tae stood with his hands in front of him, waiting while Hoseok\nfilled up the bathtub until he got cold or couldn\u2019t wait any longer and wrapped\nhimself around Hoseok, leaning against his back while the sound of water\nrushing calmed him down. \u00a0He went\nwillingly once Hoseok helped him step in and watched with not an eager or\nexcited eye but a look of admiration and appreciation as Hoseok finished\nundressing to get in behind him. \u00a0He\nmelted a little into Hoseok\u2019s chest and a little more as Hoseok ran his hands\nall over him, but Hoseok didn\u2019t feel any less light or carefree or, for lack of\na better word, high. \u00a0If anything, he\nfelt more-so. \u00a0The more Tae relaxed into\nhim, he more at ease he felt. \u00a0They fit\ntogether perfectly even if they weren\u2019t \u201cdestined\u201d to be. \u00a0And since there was no hurry, because Hoseok\nwas going to be there when Tae woke up in the morning, he was going to be there\neven when Tae lost his cool a little and got impatient and snapped at him over something\nminor, he was going to be there even when Tae needed his soulmate more than he\nneeded a boyfriend, Hoseok took his time on Tae.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He washed him carefully, making sure\nto get off all of the smells that didn\u2019t belong to him. \u00a0That weird Aunt Sally and friend-of-a-friend\nwho had danced a little too closely and someone\u2019s cigarette smell and something\nelse Hoseok couldn\u2019t pinpoint that definitely wasn\u2019t Tae or him\u2014or Jimin or\nJungkook or Y/N or Yoongi, the only other smells he would allow. \u00a0Tonight, he wanted Tae to smell like Tae, and\na little like him, because he\u2019s a human with a tiny trace of possessiveness in\nhim as we all have. \u00a0Hoseok wants him to\nknow that he\u2019s his. \u00a0So he washed him\ncarefully and completely, and he patted him dry and wrapped him up in his\nsoftest robe that Tae had once made fun of but now tried to steal every time he\nwas over. \u00a0And he held him before they\ncould even brush their teeth, even before he could get either of them dressed\napart from the furry robe, and just let them breathe together, closing their\neyes before sleep came. \u00a0Eventually, he\nhelped Tae get dressed in Hoseok\u2019s flannel pants and into bed where he slid in\nnext to him and pulled him close and just stared at him until Tae\u2019s eyelids\nstarted to flutter. \u00a0He kissed him,\nthen. \u00a0On his hair and forehead and cheek\nand chin and nose and eyelashes and temple and knuckles and neck and chest and\nribcage and stomach and collarbone and everywhere he could reach, saving his\nlips for last. \u00a0He took his time. \u00a0There was no hurry. \u00a0No rush. \n</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He would kiss Tae until he fell\nasleep, and Hoseok would keep kissing him until he fell asleep himself.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ducking out of one\u2019s own wedding may\nbe a little frowned on, but Jimin had moved past what other people thought\nyears ago. \u00a0Besides, they had only\ninvited people who wouldn\u2019t be so judgmental and petty, and everyone was still\nhaving plenty of fun when he pulled Jungkook away. \u00a0It hadn\u2019t taken long to read Jungkook\u2019s\nuncomfortable cues, anyway, and he had learned early on that Jungkook was an\nintrovert unlike himself and Tae and Hoseok. \nHonestly, he was surprised the boy could keep up with the three of them\nso well, but he supposes it was just a testament to how much he liked them\nall. \u00a0Still, Jimin could tell when his\nsmiles shifted from genuine happiness to politeness, and that was when he knew it\nwas time to go. \u00a0He had kept the boy as\nclose as possible all night if only to give them some semblance of their own\npersonal bubble when really everyone wanted to be in their space. \u00a0It was to expected; you invite people to a\nwedding to share the experience with them, but Jimin could tell Jungkook was\ngetting exhausted, and even though the boy protested, actually daring to\ncomplain about proper decorum or some ridiculous shit no eighteen-year-old would\nnormally say, Jimin dragged him out, anyway.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He was flushed from dancing or from\nhappiness or from embarrassment, Jimin wasn\u2019t quite sure, but either way the\nboy looked good, and he was his now. \u00a0The\nidea made him pause and consider the boy sitting so close to him in the car on\ntheir way home. \u00a0Jungkook had the ability\nto be giggly and breathtaking one moment and teasing and sultry the next, and\nif Jimin wasn\u2019t so confidence in himself, it might confuse and intimidate him,\nbut it only made him feel more endeared to the boy. \u00a0He hadn\u2019t ever felt like a very possessive\nperson; protective, yes, fiercely so, but having Tae as a soulmate had always\nmeant he shared everything he could with everyone he could. \u00a0It was simply their nature, and Tae brought out\na side in him that made him want to simply give and give to others as much as\nhe could. \u00a0So the idea of having someone\nto himself, even though he knew he didn\u2019t own Jungkook, it was nothing like that,\nwas new and, frankly, a little overwhelming. \nHe had fleeting thoughts of Tae throughout the ceremony and even now,\nthoughts he had to gently push aside. \u00a0He\nwas doing nothing wrong, and while he and Tae could share Jungkook in other\nways, now wasn\u2019t the time for that. \u00a0He\nwas to have Jungkook like Tae never could, like Hoseok never could, like no one\nelse ever had and no one else ever could.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cJungkook,\u201d he found himself saying,\nsuddenly overwhelmed with the thought. \u00a0He\nknew the boy was nervous even if he wanted it. \nAnd for weeks Jimin hadn\u2019t been nervous but had wanted to wait. \u00a0He couldn\u2019t let Jungkook know he was nervous\nnow for fear that the boy would misread his hesitation as repulsion or a lack\nof desire. \u00a0If anything, he simply wasn\u2019t\nsure how to handle how much he wanted the boy. \nHe wanted him to laugh and smile and squirm and moan and sigh and\nbeg. \u00a0He wanted all of him, whatever that\nlooked and felt and sounded and smelled like.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And the boy just looked at him,\nsweetly and expectantly with a touch of anxiety that Jimin wanted to kiss\naway. \u00a0So he did.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And Jimin was used to being\ngraceful. \u00a0Tae had always been a little\nclumsy, had fumbled and gotten overly excited and eager the few times they had\ndone anything that crossed the border of platonic friends, but Jimin had always\nbeen calm and collected, cool and in charge. \nIt was expected of him, as a dancer, in some way, to remember how to\nbreathe and know the placement of his hands, to remember the moves, of when to\npush and when to pull, of when to go fast and when to go slow, so while he stumbled\nup the stairs and stumbled into their apartment as Jungkook clung to him and\ntried to wrestle him out of his clothes, he regained his composure once they\nmade it to their room that was definitely theirs now, no longer just Jimin\u2019s. \u00a0Jungkook seemed to be seeping into Jimin\u2019s\nspace and Jimin\u2019s being already, and if the desperate noises coming from\nJungkook\u2019s mouth were any indication of how effected he was, too, then Jimin\nknew the boy just wanted to be close to Jimin as much as possible. \u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Still, he found it in himself to\nslow down, to hold the boy, to touch him all over.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cJungkook, Jungkook,\u201d he said somewhere\nbetween their shirts on and their skin bare. \n\u201cI\u2019m yours.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAnd I\u2019m yours,\u201d Jungkook almost\nwhined back, capturing Jimin\u2019s lips to shut him up, but Jimin wasn\u2019t done, so\nhe let the boy kiss him for a moment before pulling him back.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNow and always,\u201d he said seriously,\nstaring into the boy\u2019s eyes. \u00a0Jungkook\u2019s\neyes were wide but they softened a little as he stared back at Jimin, repeating\nthe words he might as well have tattooed on his brain by this point.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNo matter what the world says.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cUntil the world ends,\u201d Jimin\ncontinued.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOr my soul stops,\u201d Jungkook\nbreathed, taking a deep breath and resting his forehead against Jimin\u2019s.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou have me now and forever,\u201d Jimin\nsaid, trying to sooth him while touching him all over all at the same\ntime. \u00a0\u201cSo there\u2019s no hurry. \u00a0You love me? \u00a0You trust me?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI love you,\u201d Jungkook almost\nsobbed. \u00a0\u201cI trust you. \u00a0Now touch me.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cCalm down,\u201d Jimin almost laughed,\nbut he touched Jungkook, anyway. \u00a0He was\ntouching him, and he would keep touching him. \nHe could touch him anywhere now, so he would. \u00a0\u201cWe have all night. \u00a0We have all our lives.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s real nice,\u201d Jungkook sighed\nagain before grabbing Jimin again. \u00a0\u201cBut\nI want you right now.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOkay,\u201d Jimin laughed, pushing the\nboy back onto their bed and climbing over him even as he peeled off his pants\nand followed with his own. \u00a0\u201cYou have\nme. \u00a0Now and always, okay?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOkay,\u201d Jungkook whispered, staring\nup at Jimin. \u00a0He had a bit of nervousness\nleft in him, something easily read as a desire to please and do well. \u00a0Jimin had no doubts he would. \u00a0The kid was annoying good at everything he\nset his mind to, and while Jimin might have the upper hand tonight for the boy\u2019s\nfirst time, he had no doubt that Jungkook would be a fast learner and would be\ngiving Jimin a run for his money in no time. \nFor now, Jimin was going to savor how eager and willing he was. \u00a0He was going to take his time, spend as much\ntime as Jungkook could stand, was going to test his patience and stamina. \u00a0And it would take time, to learn what\nJungkook liked and didn\u2019t like, but Jimin could be patient, clearly more patient\nthan Jungkook could be. \u00a0He would learn\nwhat made the boy preen and blush, and he would enjoy every second of it.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cJungkook,\u201d he said, trying to keep\nhis voice steady when he just wanted to laugh and blow raspberries all over his\nhardened stomach, \u201chusband.\u201d \u00a0Jungkook\u2019s\nbreath hitched a little at that, which made Jimin smile wider. \u00a0\u201cMine,\u201d he whispered, watching Jungkook nod\nand reach for him. \u00a0\u201cLove,\u201d he tried,\nsmiling even more when Jungkook closed his eyes for a second before opening\nthem, his pupils wide and glistening.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSoulmate,\u201d Jungkook said firmly and\ndecisively, pulling Jimin down until he was almost being squished. \u00a0He mouthed at Jimin\u2019s earrings and the side\nof his neck, anything he could reach until Jimin pushed himself off and\nproperly kissed him. \u00a0\u201cPlease,\u201d the boy\nmanaged when Jimin left his lips again to make his way down his body. \u00a0Jimin knew Jungkook could be a brat, so his\npoliteness was sure to fade if Jimin tested him much longer. \u00a0He decided to go easy on him for now. \u00a0He would probably go easy on him the rest of\ntheir lives, if he was honest. \u00a0He\u2019d give\nand give and give anything and everything that Jungkook needed or wanted. \u00a0For now, that was himself, as much and as quickly\nas possible. \u00a0So, with one final kiss to\nJungkook\u2019s navel that made the boy twitch a little under him and made Jimin\nsmirk a little above him, he gave the boy what he wanted, but moreover, he gave\nhim what he needed.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Relationships, like life, have many\nstages. \u00a0The infancy, with fleeting\nglances and blushing cheeks and stammered confessions and thumping hearts and\nsweaty palms. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThe\nchildhood, of whispered secrets and loud laughter and shared interests. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nAdolescence,\nthe wild abandonment and wild dreams and stolen kisses and promises made. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nAdulthood,\nwhen things became serious and mature, the settling down, the label and symbols\nof love, the inability to keep your hands off of each other, the desire to show\nthem off and declare your love to everyone you met, the swelling of hearts like\nnothing else, the belief that nothing could go wrong, that everything was\nperfect. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nAnd\nmiddle age, when things either grew boring or you settled into a pleasant rhythm. \u00a0When the mundane and monotony of living together\nand knowing what the other was thinking or doing without even needing to communicate\nbrought despair or contentment. \u00a0When\nsimply being with the other was enough or wasn\u2019t. \u00a0The time when a crisis happened or the last\npush toward peace and security for the rest of your life settled in. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nAnd,\nunfortunately for some, death, the end of everything you once held dear and\nthought would never end. \u00a0The uncomfortable\nsilences and broken hearts and prolonged absences that turned bitter until they\nburnt. \u00a0You had never experienced such a\nstage in any relationship and hoped you never would. \u00a0You knew Yoongi had, though, and you wondered,\nthough the idea was quickly squashed, if he was thinking about if things would\never end that way for him again. \u00a0They\nwouldn\u2019t, because you weren\u2019t Jin or anyone else. \u00a0You weren\u2019t just somebody for him. \u00a0You weren\u2019t sure what stage your relationship\nwas in with Yoongi, but whatever it was made you feel alive and terrified all\nat the same time. \u00a0He seemed to continue\nto have that effect on you. \u00a0You wanted\nmore and yet were afraid of taking too much, of taking something that wasn\u2019t\nyours. \u00a0Even if you knew deep down that\nhe was yours, even if you had spoken those very words out loud before,\nsomething still held you back. \u00a0You\nwondered, after listening to Jimin and Jungkook make promises to each other to\ncomplete each other and be there for each other, if you could fully give\nyourself to Yoongi while feeling like he would never fully be yours.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nPerhaps\nthere was no reason to ask that question, because you already knew the answer,\nbut you were determined to try. \u00a0You were\ninsistent on trying to prove to him, to show him, to make him believe you and\ntrust you. \u00a0Your actions and words hadn\u2019t\nbeen as clear as his had been, and you didn\u2019t want him to have any doubts that\nyou wanted to stick around, that you wanted to be with him and by him and as\nclose to him as possible.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nIf\nthat was pathetic, then Yoongi was right, and you were pathetic for him, but he\nmerely had to look at you for know that he was gone for you, too. \u00a0So you tried to push aside all of your\ninsecurities and invasive thoughts that weren\u2019t of Yoongi and Yoongi only as\nyou got back home.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nIt\nwas home. \u00a0Some part of you knew this and\nbelieved this. \u00a0Felt it to be true as you\ntoed off your shoes to pick up and carry to the closet as Yoongi went to get a\ncouple of glasses of water. \u00a0You knew his\nplace was home by the flowers that always seemed new in the vases spread around\nthe house. \u00a0They were, if nothing else,\nthe answer for your earlier question. \nBecause flowers, like relationships, also go through the stages of\nlife. \u00a0And the jasmine scattered throughout\nYoongi\u2019s house were always thriving. \u00a0You\nnever saw one of them wilt or die. \u00a0You\nknew they had to; there was nothing magical about them. \u00a0But Yoongi never let them got to that point,\nor at least never let you see them. \u00a0And\nit was almost silly, really, you, who worked in a flower shop and knew every\nname of every flower and every meaning behind them, to step into Yoongi\u2019s room\nthat was now also yours and to stop and simply stare at the flowers by his bed,\nfinally realizing where the two of you stood.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nIt\nshould have been easy, then, to turn around and just tell him or show him when\nhe came into the room and looked at you just standing there, but you felt like\nyou could barely breathe much less speak or make sense of whatever you were\nfeeling. \u00a0Perhaps you were getting easy\nto read, or Yoongi was always that intuitive or aware of what you needed before\nyou had even acknowledged him, because he put the glasses down and reached\ntentatively for your hand, tugging you toward the bathroom with no sense of urgency.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cBrush,\nwash,\u201d he said, handing you your toothbrush as he proceeded to do the same, his\neyes barely leaving you in the mirror as he did. \u00a0You watched as he brushed his teeth, rinsed,\nand spit before you even moved to do the same, blinking away your stupor that\nhe might be registering as sleepiness. \nYou felt anything but sleepy, though. \nYou felt wired and jittery, twitchy, even, and your fingers were shaking\na bit as you tried to brush. \u00a0By the time\nyou finally were done, you stood up to Yoongi holding a face wipe in front of\nyou, and you closed your eyes for him to step close and do it for you. \u00a0You couldn\u2019t help grabbing onto his wrist,\nthe contact alone making you sigh and calm down a little as he pressed gently\nbut firmly around your eyes and cheeks to remove your makeup, more than you\nwere certainly used to wearing. \u00a0When his\nhand left you, you opened your eyes to see his face much closer than it was\nbefore, and you scooted a little closer, wanting to simply melt into him, but\nhis hand came back to your cheek to steady you, and you kept your eyes open to\nlook up at him even though it was difficult. \nYour eyelashes kept flickering, and your eyes seemed to be blurry and\nunable to focus, but all you wanted to do was look at Yoongi looking at\nyou. \u00a0You needed to watch him watching\nyou. \u00a0You had to see the way he looked at\nyou, because no one else looked at you like that. \u00a0No one else ever had, and no one else ever\nwould, surely.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoongi,\u201d\nyou managed to say as his thumb and fingers glided across your face and\nneck. \u00a0He just continued, his eyes never\nleaving yours until you practically nuzzled his hand, breaking eye contact with\nhim only to kiss his palm once before looking back up at him. \u00a0\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cCan\nI?\u201d he said, even though he didn\u2019t need to. \nStill, the question made you move, pulling on his belt loops as you\nnodded. \u00a0No one had ever asked before,\nand even though he could probably read your mind at this point and must surely know\nwhat you wanted and needed more than anyone else ever could or ever would, he\nhad still asked. \u00a0You could laugh at him\nlater, because kissing for the first time in a bathroom didn\u2019t sound much\nbetter than kissing in an elevator, but Yoongi had been right. \u00a0There was really nothing to compare. \u00a0You weren\u2019t sure if you had expected to\nliterally melt or explode, so you were glad neither of those happened. \u00a0You were glad you didn\u2019t start shaking more\nto the point of throwing up or itching to the point where you would bleed if\nyou scratched too hard. \u00a0You were glad\nyou only melted a little as your lips merged together. \u00a0You were glad you only shook a little when\nyou felt his fingers twitching against you before they pressed into your\nskin. \u00a0You were glad, and glad couldn\u2019t\neven begin to describe it\u2014relieved? Grateful? Satisfied?\u2014when Yoongi finally\nkissed you.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nLike\neverything else he did, he moved slowly but surely. \u00a0Once he knew he had permission, he didn\u2019t hesitate. \u00a0He controlled your every movement without\nbeing forceful. \u00a0And he left you wanting\nmore, so it felt extremely rude and unfair when he pulled away from you, laughing\nas you tried to chase him. \u00a0He ducked\ndown to your neck, though, which didn\u2019t surprise you. \u00a0He had staked his claim to that territory\nweeks ago, so it was naturally his favorite spot. \u00a0Wanting to give to him as much as possible,\nthen, you let him until your fingers started to twitch again, itching for a\nchance to do the same to him. \u00a0He seemed\nto notice your plight and chuckled again before taking both of your hands in\nhis and leading you back into the bedroom, flicking off the light as you went. </p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThe\ndarkness that engulfed you was a little too much, and one of Yoongi\u2019s hand left\nyours to turn on the lamp that illuminated first and foremost the flowers\nunderneath them before even revealing his face.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoongi,\u201d\nyou said again, looking between the flowers and him. \u00a0He hummed as he let go of your hands, and\nwithout even asking permission you finally started to unbutton his shirt. \u00a0With something to do, your fingers seemed to\nhave stopped their fidgeting, and his plain but offensive shirt was soon\nundone, and he let you push it down his arms until it fluttered to the ground. \u00a0His undershirt had to go, too, and he lifted\nhis arms easily as you tugged it up and over his head. \u00a0You had only seen him shirtless a few times\naccidentally. \u00a0He had always been\nextremely modest around the house, always making sure to at least have a shirt\nand shorts on around you, even though you had always figured he would prefer to\nbe wearing less clothes, especially to bed. \nYou had never really ogled at guys before. \u00a0You hadn\u2019t had girl friends growing up to\ngossip about boys with or giggle and point out who you thought was hot. \u00a0You knew Yoongi was fit and attractive, but\nhis looks had never been what made you desire him. \u00a0It was how he acted and treated you, and,\nhonestly, how he sounded when talking to you, that made you attracted to\nhim. \u00a0So his smooth, lean torso was\nmomentarily distracting, but it was the expanse of skin that mattered no matter\nwhat it looked like, and you splayed a hand over his chest almost\nexperimentally. \u00a0Yoongi was not ticklish,\nyou had discovered a while ago, though he did have sharp reflexes and would\nretaliate if poked in his side surprisingly. \nSo when he barely even flinched when your fingers touched him, you weren\u2019t\nsurprised. \u00a0Pleased, even, that he was\nletting you touch him. \u00a0You figured he would\nlet you do anything to him, but still, you were used to having things done to\nyou, not the other way around. \u00a0Exploring\nyour partner simply for the sake of exploring was a pretty foreign concept to you,\nand you could tell you were always losing your footing. \u00a0So you did what you thought you were good at\nand went for his pants\u2019 button and then zipper, and he let you, only stopping\nyou when you tried to pull them down his hips.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d\nhe said softly, his voice making you stop and stand up completely. \u00a0His pants fell on their own accord, and he stepped\nout of them before running his hand up and down your forearm. \u00a0\u201cI told you I\u2019d be good to you, right?\u201d \u00a0Nodding slowly, you felt yourself shiver,\nbecause you couldn\u2019t quite comprehend what he could mean. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cLet\nme just,\u201d he sighed, pulling you toward him and kissing you again. \u00a0If that\u2019s what he meant by being good to you,\nthen he could keep doing that and you would be perfectly content and happy. \u00a0His kisses seemed to be a distraction\ntechnique, though, and a clever one at that, because you barely noticed his\nhands unzipping your dress and pulling the material off of your shoulders and\ndown your arms until the cool air hit you, causing you to shiver again. \u00a0You could tease him later about not even\ntaking advantage of the dress\u2019 slip, but at the moment you had to hold onto his\nshoulders, his bare shoulders, which was a new sensation, as he moved toward\nyour neck again. \u00a0The familiar movement\nof his nose over your delicate skin was soothing, though, and helped counter balance\nthe new sensation of his hands running all over your bare back. \u00a0Yoongi\u2019s hands were soft, never calloused,\nbecause the man was the biggest softie you had ever met, and you knew Jimin and\nTae.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nIt\nfit his character, then, that he continued to move slowly and carefully all\nover you. \u00a0That he placed himself on the\nbed first instead of pushing you down into it. \nThat he never let go of your hand and always made sure you were connected\nin some way. \u00a0It made sense that every\nkiss he placed on every inch of skin he could reach lingered longer than the\nlast. \u00a0That he took his time and checked\non you and listened to you and asked you constantly with his eyes or his words\nif you were okay or if you needed something. \nIt made sense that he insisted on always facing each other. \u00a0To anyone else, he might have appeared vanilla\nor even lazy, but for you, and to you, there was nothing more intense about the\nway he looked at you, about the way he touched you, about the way he kissed\nyou. \u00a0Good couldn\u2019t even begin to\ndescribe how he made you feel, and your panting breaths and curled toes and\nsweaty limbs had hardly anything to do with why, when you insisted that he had to\nstop before you cried from how overwhelmed you felt, you somehow felt even closer\nwhen he curled around you and simply held you as you fell asleep, discussing\nthe wedding and the night and what tomorrow would bring.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nIt\nwas this growing feeling inside you that even without vows, even without being\nable to smell him, Yoongi was never going to leave you or let you go, and even\nif people called you pathetic, you knew you were never going to let go of him,\neither. \u00a0And even if you couldn\u2019t tell\nhim that, even if you didn\u2019t know how to say exactly what you were feeling,\nYoongi must have known, because he turned over and dragged you with him until\nyou were both facing his nightstand where the vase of jasmine still sat,\nglowing even in the otherwise dark room. \nIt was so much more than a mere flower, and it was so much more than a\nmere feeling that you had about Yoongi. \nStill, you knew it was only going to grow, and nothing could ever make\nit wither or fade or die.</p><hr><p>A/N:</p><p>OKAY, FIRST!</p><p>Let me just say a few things.\u00a0 I don\u2019t even know where to start.</p><p>Why does HOSEOK keep stealing the show?\u00a0 He is amazing.</p><p>Okay,

\u00a0Loved. \u00a0Hoseok loved love. \u00a0How could he not like weddings, then? \u00a0Plus, dancing? \u00a0Alcohol? \nHot men in suits looking hot? \nWhat\u2019s not to like?</p>[[MORE]]<p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nHoseok\nhated anxiety, though, and found loving people who had hate in their hearts\nhard to do. \u00a0It\u2019s a testament to the\nnurture argument in psychology that Jungkook has turned out so differently than\nhis parents. \u00a0Hoseok has never really\ndisliked people as much as he has disliked Jungkook\u2019s parents lately, and if\nthe way Jimin\u2019s face was screwed up was any indication, then the other man must\nbe feeling the same.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nHe\nhad merely come to check in on Tae, and consequently, Jimin, since Jungkook had\ninsisted he was ready and it was time to start, so he almost closed the door\nimmediately when he saw two other figures in the room, but if Hoseok was a cat,\nhe would have been dead a long time ago, because his curiosity has always\ngotten the best of him. \u00a0Jungkook\u2019s\nparents aren\u2019t ugly people\u2014he clearly got his good looks from somewhere\u2014but\nthey were ugly people. \u00a0Desperation,\nsurely, or pride, must have gotten the best of their senses at some point. \u00a0Something had to explain why they seemed to\ncare so little about their son. \u00a0Hoseok\nknew it wasn\u2019t quite his place or business to stay in the room or make himself\nknown or listen at all, but something about what Mr. Jeon murmured about</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\ncan\u2019t believe we\u2019re letting him marry a man,\u201d made him stay. \u00a0Because he knew that there were people out\nthere in the world who still didn\u2019t agree with men marrying mem or women\nmarrying women despite that fact that soulmates often were of the same sex. \u00a0He knew shelters around the city and probably\nthe world were filled with kids whose parents didn\u2019t agree with them being with\ntheir soulmate purely because they were the same sex, but still, it jarred him\nto hear. \u00a0He only entered the room to\nshut the door so Jungkook wouldn\u2019t have to hear the rest.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re\nletting him marry his soulmate,\u201d Tae said besides his own soulmate, a fierce\nand intense look in his eyes Hoseok rarely saw. \nHe was glad he rarely saw it, honestly. \nAn angry Tae, just like an angry Jimin, or maybe an angry anyone, scared\nHoseok a little.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re\nnot even letting him do that,\u201d Jimin said, wrapping his arm around Tae for\nsupport. \u00a0\u201cI had to pay you before you\neven allowed that. \u00a0Now, as I know we\ndidn\u2019t invite you, I\u2019m going to have to ask you to leave, as there can\u2019t be any\nreason for you to be here unless you want something else, and you\u2019re not going\nto get it, whatever it is.\u201d \u00a0Jungkook\u2019s\nmother had the audacity to try to look affronted at the idea.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nam just here to see my boy get married.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHe\ndoesn\u2019t want you here,\u201d Jimin said. \u00a0\u201cAnd\nI don\u2019t either. \u00a0It\u2019s his day, our day,\nand you no longer have a right to take part of it.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat\nwill it look like?\u201d Mr. Jeon said, stepping toward Jimin. \u00a0\u201cWhat will it look like if his parents aren\u2019t\nthere?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\nwill look like what it is,\u201d Tae almost sneered. \n\u201cLike you aren\u2019t wanted.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cMy\nparents aren\u2019t here either. \u00a0They also\nlost the right to have any part in my life when they refused to accept who the\nworld had provided for me and I had managed to find and be found by. \u00a0So, unless you have a question about the\npayment I already sent you, or the paperwork we have already filled out, you\nneed to leave.\u201d \u00a0If Hoseok wasn\u2019t so\nhopelessly in love with Tae, and his best friend wasn\u2019t about to marry him,\nHoseok might have had to claim Jimin for himself. \u00a0He seemed to be burning with a passion that terrified\nand enthralled Hoseok.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nJungkook\u2019s\nparents seemed to think, or seethe, for a moment, perhaps looking for an iota\nof an excuse to stay. \u00a0Hoseok hoped, deep\ndown, that it was some buried deep love for their son that they wanted to stay,\nbut the way that they finally scoffed and stormed out, barely giving him a\nglance on the way, crushed those ideas quickly. \nTheir exit brought Hoseok to Jimin and Tae\u2019s attention, and they let go\nof each other so Tae could come to him, enveloping the man in a tight hug.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d\nJimin said, buttoning his blazer. \u00a0\u201cIs\nJungkook okay?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOh,\nyeah,\u201d Hoseok said over Tae\u2019s shoulder. \n\u201cHe asked me to let you know he\u2019s ready.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\nuh, tell him, yeah?\u201d Jimin said, still fidgeting with his suit. \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t want\u2014\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nhave no idea what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Hoseok said, winking and smiling\nwidely. \u00a0\u201cI saw nothing. \u00a0I heard nothing. \u00a0In fact, am I even here? \u00a0Are any of us here?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cStop,\u201d\nTae mumbled, nipping at his ear before pulling away, an arm still held tightly\naround his waist.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cSeriously,\nthough, you handled it well. \u00a0I don\u2019t\nknow what I would have done if they came to Jungkook\u2019s room.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cShit,\u201d\nJimin said, the idea having seemed to have not occurred to him as he rushed for\nthe door. \u00a0Hoseok made sure to stop him\nbefore he got too far, though, putting his arm out to pull him into a hug that\nTae quickly made into a group one.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHey,\nwhoa, he\u2019s alright. \u00a0Y/N\u2019s in there, and\nI told her not to let anyone in except me. \nYou know it\u2019s bad luck to see the groom before the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWell\nthen,\u201d Jimin sighed even as a relaxed smile spread over his face, \u201cwe\u2019re doomed\nconsidering I saw him an hour ago.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah,\nno, you\u2019re so gross nothing could doom this marriage,\u201d Tae said, and Jimin\nsimply blinked and looked at his arm around Hoseok\u2019s waist. \u00a0His soulmate didn\u2019t seem deterred, though, as\nhe pulled Hoseok closer. \u00a0Hoseok sometimes\nwondered if the two soulmates did speak telepathically, because Jimin laughed\nas Tae rested his head on Hoseok\u2019s shoulder. \nHe felt a little out of the loop, if he had to be honest, but he knew\nthey weren\u2019t being malicious or even meaning to.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cGo\ndo your best men duties,\u201d Jimin said, waving them out. \u00a0\u201cI need to finish getting ready.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWait,\nwe actually have to do stuff?\u201d Tae pouted as Hoseok tickled his side so he would\nstand up straight. A mere wave of Jimin\u2019s hand sent them off again, and as soon\nas his back was turned Hoseok leaned over to give Tae a peck on the cheek which\nmade the man smile as he straightened his own clothes before nodding. \u00a0\u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cReady,\u201d\nHoseok nodded back, even if he wasn\u2019t exactly sure that was 100% true because\nhe wasn\u2019t 100% sure what Tae meant by the question. \u00a0Still, he followed him out. \u00a0He would be a dutiful best man. \u00a0He\u2019d do anything to ensure Jungkook had a perfect\nday.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nNothing\nwas perfect in life, of course, even on the day of a wedding between two souls\nwho were clearly meant to be.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOh\nmy god, fucking, I can\u2019t, it just, why won\u2019t it button?\u201d Jungkook whined and huffed,\nhis fingers dropping lamely to his side. \nYou tried desperately to resist an urge to laugh at him.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d\nyou said as you closed the door behind you, since something needed to come out\nof your mouth and you assumed laughing at the boy in his nervous state wouldn\u2019t\nhelp anything. \u00a0\u201cLet me.\u201d \u00a0He thankfully did, staring up at the ceiling\nand sighing as you easily buttoned his blazer. \nSmoothing out his collar and adjusting his bow-tie even though it didn\u2019t\nneed to be, you patted him on the shoulder and stepped back, giving him a final\nlook-over. \u00a0He spread his hands open in\nfront of himself as if to be on display, and you nodded approvingly. \u00a0He still only sighed again and slumped into a\nchair before shooting back up immediately, smoothing out his coat and fussing\nwith his pockets. \u00a0\u201cYou look extremely\nuncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\nthink?\u201d he huffed, fiddling with his cuffs.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cAre\nyou nervous?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOnly\na ton.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d \u00a0The question was simple, but Jungkook still\nlooked up at you seriously as if constructing an argumentative thesis in his\nhead before he responded. \u00a0\u201cI mean,\u201d you\nsaid slowly, \u201che is your soulmate.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah,\nno, it\u2019s not that. \u00a0It\u2019s. \u00a0It\u2019s,\u201d he sighed, looking past you at the\ndoor again. \u00a0\u201cI just really don\u2019t want to\nmess up.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d\nyou said, fighting a smile again. \u00a0\u201cWell,\nwhile I try to make it a point to not quote him, my dad once told me that some\nnerves are good. \u00a0It just shows you care.\u201d \u00a0Jungkook looked suspicious, so you only\nshrugged. \u00a0\u201cI mean, if you didn\u2019t care, you\nwould be apathetic. \u00a0You obviously want\nto do well and make Jimin happy, so you\u2019re nervous. \u00a0Not that you should be. \u00a0You\u2019ll be fine. \u00a0Great, even. \nIt\u2019s just a ceremony. \u00a0What really\nmatters comes before and after, right?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d\nJungkook said, but he still looked uncomfortable or anxious. \u00a0You couldn\u2019t imagine why, as his confidence\nalways seemed boosted around Jimin lately. \nYou saw him anxious at the coffee shop, but that was different. \u00a0That was trying to please twenty different\npeople at once who were nigh impossible to please even on their best days. \u00a0He could make the perfect drink, which he\nalways did, and they could still get upset. \nThey weren\u2019t really upset at him, but he always seemed to take it that\nway. \u00a0It was understandable, even if sad. \u00a0You didn\u2019t like seeing Jungkook at work, so\nout of control and uncomfortable. \u00a0You\ndidn\u2019t like him looking so anxious now, either, but you really didn\u2019t think he\nshould be.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat,\num, exactly do you think you\u2019re going to mess up? \u00a0Hoseok and Tae have the rings, right?\u201d \u00a0A nod. \n\u201cYou know your vows.\u201d \u00a0A\nstatement, not a question, because you knew he did, but he still nodded. \u00a0\u201cIs it Tae? \nAre you worried about if it will be weird or something?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cNo,\nno. \u00a0Not much is going to change. \u00a0I mean, some stuff, but not much.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOkay. \u00a0So, what are you worried about messing up?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cJust. \u00a0You know how sometimes you meet someone who\u2019s\nbetter at you at something you want to be good at?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOnly\nlike every day,\u201d you mumbled, only half-joking. \nJungkook glared a little before he continued, not meeting your gaze.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cJimin\nis just good. \u00a0I know he is. \u00a0He has a lot of experience. \u00a0And I\u2026\u201d \nJungkook trailed off, leaving you blinking and struggling to be patient\nand understanding when you would much prefer him to just be blunt.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cAt\nwhat?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\nknow.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nreally don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\nknow,\u201d Jungkook said forcefully and slowly. \nYou were about to insist, again, that you didn\u2019t know what he was\ntalking about, when he raised his hands, made a circle with one, and proceeded\nto stick his pointer finger through it.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOh\nmy god,\u201d you screamed, doubling over in laughter, much to Jungkook\u2019s chagrin. \u00a0\u201cOh, oh my god.\u201d \u00a0Struggling to stop laughing, you reached for\na nearby chair to stable yourself, almost wishing like you didn\u2019t know what he\nwas referring to.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cStop,\u201d\nJungkook grumbled. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m serious. \u00a0What if. \nI don\u2019t know. \u00a0I suck?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOh\nmy god,\u201d you said, almost falling over again at his word choice. \u00a0He seemed to realize it belatedly, too, as he\nhuffed and his cheeks started to color a little. \u00a0\u201cIsn\u2019t\u2014wouldn\u2019t\u2014wouldn\u2019t that be good?\u201d you\nsaid between breaths. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s\nHoseok? \u00a0Isn\u2019t it time to go?\u201d Jungkook mumbled,\npushing past you to open the door. \u00a0You recovered\nenough to stop him even though your eyes were still watering, leaning against\nthe door to catch your breath and keeping him from escaping.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHold\u2014hold\non,\u201d you said, putting out your hands to stop him and steady yourself on his\nshoulders. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m sorry for\nlaughing. \u00a0Jungkook, I\u2019m just, it\u2019s just,\noh wow, you don\u2019t have to worry about that. \nI mean, I get it, but really, Jimin\u2019s experience, as you call it, will\nonly serve to help. \u00a0I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll take\ngood care of you. \u00a0Just, I mean, as a\nnon-male, I don\u2019t think I have much advice for you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\ndon\u2019t want your advice,\u201d Jungkook said, looking appalled.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cBut\nat some level it\u2019s all the same. \u00a0You don\u2019t\nhave to be in love to have sex, but I\u2019m sure it helps. \u00a0Just don\u2019t expect it to be perfect the first\ntime, yeah? \u00a0It\u2019ll probably be awkward\nand weird and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cGreat\npep talk,\u201d Jungkook said, trying to get past you again. \u00a0He easily could, you both knew, if it was\npurely up to strength, so he must not have actually wanted to leave the room,\njust the conversation as he let you stop him.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m\njust saying, he\u2019ll be good to you. \u00a0And\nthat will make it great. \u00a0Just be good\nback. \u00a0You\u2019ll have to tell him what you\nlike and don\u2019t like. \u00a0You know him. \u00a0He\u2019ll insist on knowing, maybe even to an\nannoying point.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah,\nyeah.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cBut\nthat means you actually have to tell him,\u201d you said, poking his chest\nagain. \u00a0\u201cAnd be honest. \u00a0It\u2019ll be good. \u00a0Like you said, he\u2019s good. \u00a0Probably good at it, too, but good more so.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d\nJungkook groaned.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t\nworry. \u00a0It\u2019ll be good.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cIs\nit good with Yoongi?\u201d Jungkook said so casually and yet quickly that you withdrew\nyour finger back just as fast. \u00a0The way\nhe blinked and then started to smile down at you was a sign for you to withdraw\nbefore he got the upper hand. \u00a0He knew\nthat the question alone was already an Ace card, and you turned to open the\ndoor, trying to push him back so he couldn\u2019t see or get out. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll\ngo get Hoseok, I\u2019m sure he has a lot of great sex advice,\u201d you said as loudly\nback at Jungkook as you could, shutting the door in his face before he could\nstop you. \u00a0The door clicked loudly behind\nyou and radiated through the quiet, but not empty, hallway. \u00a0The silence only lasted for a second when you\nsaw Hoseok and Tae standing across the hall, smirking at you, Hoseok\u2019s eyebrows\nraised. \u00a0\u201cNo, I do not want to explain,\u201d\nyou said, waving your hands in front of your face to get rid of any unwanted\nquestions or comments. \u00a0\u201cAnd I don\u2019t want\nto explain. \u00a0I\u2019m going to go sit down\nnow.\u201d \u00a0With the shared laughter of Hoseok\nand Tae fading behind you, you fled down the hallway to the small sanctuary, trying\nto slip into your seat unnoticed.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nYou\nmostly were, but the pianist\u2019s fingers misstepped, and a note went missing or a\nnote was added, something barely jarring in the flow of music but enough for\nyou to know that someone did notice you entering, and you ducked your head,\ntrying to not be a distraction. \u00a0The\nmusic continued flawlessly, but you still knew he was watching. \u00a0You found yourself, as the song continued,\nunable and unwilling to not look up, though, something drawing your head\nup. \u00a0So it was no surprise to see Min\nYoongi staring and smiling back at you from the stage, his fingers moving effortlessly\nover the keys as he didn\u2019t even look at them. \nIt seemed like he had been waiting for you to merely look up, because\nthe second you did and your eyes met across the room, his smile melted into\ncontentment before he focused all of his attention back on the piano in front\nof him. \u00a0If you had anything else to focus\non, you would have, but you didn\u2019t. \u00a0Completely\nshamelessly, then, you simply watched Yoongi as you sat and waited for the ceremony\nto begin. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nFrankly,\nyou watched him even after the ceremony began. \nYou had seen him that morning but had to rush out to help Kimie finish\ndecorating and help Tae and Jimin get things ready. \u00a0Yoongi had arrived in the past hour and let\nyou know via text. \u00a0As people filed in,\nmostly just Jimin\u2019s dance friends and a handful of people you didn\u2019t know, some\nindescribable anxiety started to settle in as the people began to, as\nwell. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t like Jungkook\u2019s nerves. \u00a0You had nothing to be nervous about, after all. \u00a0You weren\u2019t getting married, and nothing was\nexpected of you the rest of the evening since the flowers were done and you\nwere just going to go home and sleep next to Yoongi like you had been doing for\na while now. \u00a0Something about watching everyone\nsit down, leaning into someone\u2019s ear next to them to whisper something about\nhow pretty it was or about how the famous Min Yoongi was playing beautiful\npiano music, made you keep looking at Yoongi and the empty spot beside you,\nthough, and by the time Yoongi paused, looking over at you one last time before\nhe started the wedding march, you realized what was wrong, even if it made you\nfeel a little pathetic.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nWeddings\nhad always left an odd taste in your mouth. \nYou had only been to a few that you could remember, but even one could\nhave been enough. \u00a0Seeing people so in\nlove and so meant for each other\u2014each one you had gone to had been one between\nsoulmates\u2014had left you numb and hopeless, possibly border lining on angry. \u00a0While weddings brought two people together\nand thus their families and friends, uniting strangers and solidifying a\nrelationship between many people for years to come, they always had made you\nfeel even more alone. \u00a0Looking up at\nYoongi now, even if you knew you were his soulmate, made your skin itch and\nyour feet bounce up and down in anticipation. \nYou throat felt parched, and your heart beat too quickly and yet seemed\nto sink. \u00a0Curling your fingers together\nuntil your nails dug into your palms, you told yourself to calm down. \u00a0You were and therefore would be happy for\nJimin and Jungkook and not frown and pout and be upset that Yoongi wasn\u2019t\nsitting beside you. \u00a0It was just for a\nfew hours. \u00a0Afterwards, you could go home\nand be as close as you wanted to him.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nSo\nwhy did you still feel like you were going to be alone forever?</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThe\nceremony, thankfully, was short, and you were able to concrete on Jimin and\nJungkook. \u00a0They made it hard not to. \u00a0Tae and Hoseok stood alone on the stage near\nthe priest\u2014the same one commissioned to marry off Jungkook before\u2014something about\nJimin having<i> \u201ca ton of friends, but I don\u2019t,\nso no, only best men, no groomsmen. \u00a0Your\nside would be embarrassingly huge.</i>\u201d \u00a0They\nseemed unable to take their eyes off of each other, too, though it was Hoseok\nwho was eyeing Tae more. \u00a0He looked at\nhis friend entering with Jimin, but only barely, before his eyes went back to\nTae\u2019s. \u00a0His smile seemed to widen any time\nthe man seemed to catch his gaze and shoot him a smile. \u00a0They both looked sickenly happy and in love,\nso much so it might have looked to some that they were getting married.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThe\npeonies you and Kimie had picked for the wedding contrasted nicely with Jimin\nand Jungkook\u2019s mostly white suits, and you thought it appropriate and sweet that\nthey walked each other down the aisle, having no time or place for their\nfathers or mothers to do the honor. \u00a0The\npriest spoke not of anyone giving someone away, but of giving each other to the\nother. \u00a0Of meeting halfway and yet always\ntaking things all the way. \u00a0Of never\nleaving anything unfinished or unsaid. \nOf completing each other by being complete. \u00a0It was overly sweet and befitting of the two\nwho couldn\u2019t stop smiling at each other, even if Jungkook\u2019s face was almost the\ncolor of the flowers he held. \u00a0You kept\nstealing looks at Yoongi as the priest talked, relieved to see him smiling back\nat you, but you did look back at Jungkook when he handed Jimin the small\nbouquet he had walked in with. \u00a0The\naction had been completely his idea. \u00a0He\nhadn\u2019t cared at all, and Jimin had had no preference, about what type of flowers\nyou and Kimie thought would look best.</p><p><i>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s your job, not mine.\u201d</i> \u00a0But, naturally curious, he had asked why you\npicked peonies for them, and you had touched the soft petals in front of you\nthat you had brought to show them as you explained.</p><p><i>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI knew peonies were your flower the\nmoment I met you. \u00a0They can symbolize\nbashfulness. \u00a0But,\u201d</i>\nyou had said before Jungkook could contradict you, <i>\u201cthey can also mean compassion. \nIf that isn\u2019t Jimin, I don\u2019t know what is. \u00a0In addition, they stand for prosperity,\nspecifically in marriage. \u00a0I picked it\nfor you but then for Jimin and then for both of you. \u00a0It also can stand for someone bringing honor to\ntheir entire family through success, and you will. \u00a0You already have. \u00a0Jimin will be your family, and he will be yours,\nand you will be nothing but successful.\u201d\u00a0</i></p><p><i></i>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nIt was that, apparently, that made Jungkook think of passing or\nsharing the flower with Jimin, not only as a symbol of himself, but also to\nrepresent him giving himself and all his bashfulness to him. \u00a0You couldn\u2019t tease him for that, even if Hoseok\nhad, and you smiled to see Jimin receiving the flowers from Jungkook with his\nown smile even as they exchanged their vows. \nIt was strange, in a way. \u00a0Weddings\nare full of such small, seemingly meaningless or mundane actions and words, and\nyet said at that moment, done in that space, shared in front of your friends and\nfamily, they become lifechanging and binding. \nThe words Jimin and Jungkook spoke to each other were nothing new, even\nif they did put their own twist on the traditional vows shared between\nsoulmates. \u00a0Even this change was nothing\nnew, as a deviation from the norm was to be expected from the two. \u00a0But it seemed like the whole room held its\nbreath as the two spoke.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re\nmine.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cAnd\nyou are mine.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNow and always.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNo matter what the world says.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cUntil the world ends.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOr my soul stops.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You barely remembered to breathe even\nwhen they finished and kissed, a soft, chaste kiss that almost made Jungkook\nlook bashful again, though that was probably due to Hoseok whistling like a\nfrat boy at a keg stand behind him, because Yoongi was staring at you from\nacross the room, certainly not kissing you, and you felt incomplete and wrong,\nso much so that you stood up. \u00a0But Yoongi\nturned back to the piano, and everyone else was standing up, too, as Jimin and\nJungkook marched proudly back down the aisle. \nYou remembered to smile, because it was easy to, almost impossible not\nto as your friends passed you. \u00a0How could\nyou not smile at such happiness? \u00a0And you\nremembered to look back at Yoongi one last time before following the crowd back\nout, smiling at the way he was watching you leave. \u00a0Because, really, how could you not smile at\nthat?</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Being involved with the decorating\nhad its advantages, as you had had a say in who you got to sit next to. \u00a0You picked Kimie and her husband Kai,\nobviously, and Minghao and Jun. \u00a0The rest\nof Jimin\u2019s dance crew and Seth sat nearby. \u00a0An empty seat reserved for Yoongi was by you,\ntoo, though you doubted he would join the table for much of the evening. \u00a0He seemed to have teleported to the room and\nwas already set up at a small table with a studio\u2019s worth of sound equipment. \u00a0It looked much to over the top for a small\nwedding, but it was fun to see him work. \nWhile you saw him plenty of times at home concentrating hard on his\nwork, seeing him public was something new. \nHe was just as dedicated and passionate, perhaps even more so, and every\ntime you felt some weird sort of jealousy\u2014could you be jealous of music?\u2014it dissipated\nquickly only to be replaced with some weird sort of pride\u2014could you proud of\nYoongi? It\u2019s not like you had any part in what he was doing. \u00a0Still, it was hard to distract yourself from\nhim or with him. \u00a0You knew speaking to\nthe people at your table would be polite, but you just wanted to watch\nYoongi. \u00a0You also knew you should just go\nand talk to him if you wanted to, but you didn\u2019t want to distract him from his\nwork. \u00a0You also wanted to concentrate on\nJungkook and Jimin sitting next to Hoseok and Tae at the front of the\nroom. \u00a0There was just a little too much\nto concentrate on or to try not to concentrate on, and you eyed the alcohol\ntable wistfully, wanting something to help slow you down and dull your senses. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nYou\nresisted for a long time, thankfully, and were distracted by food and your\ntablemates. \u00a0Kimie and Kai had plenty to\nsay about Bomi and all of her antics, and Minghao and Jun had plenty to\ncomplain about from the company. \u00a0They\nquestioned you repetitively about why you hadn\u2019t been to the show yet, and you promised\nthem over and over again that you would. \nKimie, the busybody that she was, kept trying to get you to talk about\nYoongi, but her husband thankfully kept her in check, clearly more aware than\nshe was, or more caring, about how often you were glancing at Yoongi across the\nroom. \u00a0You stopped by your friends\u2019 table,\ntoo, but you didn\u2019t want to stay long. \u00a0You\nsaw them often, and you didn\u2019t want to hog their time. \u00a0Plus, Hoseok looked about ready to bring up\nthe conversation you wanted to avoid that Jungkook had been embarrassed about,\nand you weren\u2019t about to dive into that mess. \nSo you caught up with Seth and chatted about the shelter and met the\nrest of the guests with no expectation of remembering their names come\ntomorrow.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nBut\nby the time the dancing started, some fancy and rich but small meal nestled in\nyour belly, the lights dimmed and your desire to pout and wallow in self-pity returned. \u00a0As your tablemates got up in pairs to go\ndance, you merely sat and watched and sipped on the glass of wine that had somehow\nmade it to your table and into your hands. \nIt wasn\u2019t that you wanted to dance. \nYou really didn\u2019t know how to, certainly not like Jimin and Jungkook\nand, well, everyone else, seemed to know how to. \u00a0Dancing like everyone was doing was not so\nmuch about doing certain steps or even doing them correctly, but it was about\nbeing close. \u00a0This type of dancing, of leaning\nclose and resting a cheek on someone else\u2019s shoulder, was about intimacy, about\ntrust and a desire to simply belong to another person. \u00a0This type of dancing made your insides\nburn. \u00a0Or maybe that was the glass you\nfinished and refilled to avoid watching how content everyone looked on the\ndance floor.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nStill,\nyou turned back in toward the table and glowered a bit, an urge to pretend to\ntext someone coming over you. \u00a0You could\ngo on a quest for the bathroom or find something else to distract you with, but\nyou knew nothing was going to be enough. \nThe scraping of a chair nearby barely even caught your attention, though\nsomeone\u2019s hand refilling your glass was enough for you to look up.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHaving\na blast?\u201d Seth said casually with only a hint of sarcasm in his voice. \u00a0Unsure how to answer, you kept your mouth\nshut, and he put the bottle down slowly until you turned enough to look at\nhim. \u00a0\u201cDo you want to dance?\u201d he said\nonce you were, but you wrinkled your lips and brow in answer. \u00a0\u201cYeah, me either. \u00a0Just thought I\u2019d ask, though, as you looked\npretty bored.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cNot\nbored,\u201d you hummed, \u201cjust not much of a wedding person.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cMe\neither,\u201d Seth said, \u201cbut this one seems nice.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah,\nit turned out really pretty.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\nlook really pretty, too,\u201d he said, and you laughed, waving a hand at him before\nsipping on your drink again. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoongi\npicked it out. \u00a0I\u2019m pretty clueless when\nit comes to being fancy. \u00a0I feel pretty\nout of place.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\nlook it.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\ndon\u2019t look much better.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\ndon\u2019t disagree,\u201d Seth shrugged. \u00a0It\u2019s not\nthat he didn\u2019t look nice. \u00a0He cleaned up\nwell, but he clearly was someone unused to wearing tight, fitted, pressed\nshirts and ties practically strangling his neck. \u00a0You wondered if his sense of discomfort was\nanything akin to yours.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou,\nuh, didn\u2019t bring a date?\u201d you said, not sure how to simply ask outright if it\nwasn\u2019t just his clothes that made him feel out of place. \u00a0The idea made Seth laugh, though he didn\u2019t\nlook upset or annoyed.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cNah,\nno time for that right now. \u00a0Hey, can I\nask,\u201d he said, scooting his chair closer and leaning in a bit, \u201chow it\u2019s going with\nYoongi?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\nyou said eloquently, not sure if you were surprised by the question or his\nproximity or by how long it had been since you had looked over at the man in\nquestion or by how much you apparently had had to drink.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoongi. \u00a0 How\u2019s it going with him? \u00a0I only ask because I thought, when you left\nbefore Thanksgiving to go stay with him that you weren\u2019t too happy about\nit. \u00a0You seemed really sad to leave, but\nthen you didn\u2019t come back. \u00a0So I just\nwondered. \u00a0I mean, I assume it\u2019s going\nwell.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d\nyou said, sighing for some reason and sinking back into your chair, your\nposture surely not eloquent or attractive. \n\u201cYeah. \u00a0It\u2019s going well.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s\nit been like? \u00a0I mean, I\u2019m taking this\nclass on documented soulmate oddities. \nIt\u2019s so fascinating, and I told my professor about you. \u00a0She was, is, super interested. \u00a0So I just wondered what it\u2019s been like\nwithout being able to smell and all.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cSeth,\u201d\nyou said slowly as it seemed like he was getting riled up. \u00a0He rarely did, except on book club nights,\nand even then it was in pure ridiculousness. \n\u201cI\u2019d prefer if you didn\u2019t talk to other people about me.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOh,\nright. \u00a0I mean, I didn\u2019t say your\nname. \u00a0Purely from an academic\nstandpoint, it\u2019s an interesting case\u2014\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m\nnot a case study,\u201d you frowned, sitting up straight and putting your glass\ndown, suddenly needing your head to be clear. \n\u201cOr an experiment. \u00a0My experience\nisn\u2019t something to be documented or analyzed like some lab rat.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cNo,\nof course not,\u201d Seth backtracked, leaning closer on his knees. \u00a0\u201cBut don\u2019t you think you should tell your\nstory? \u00a0What if there are other people\nout there like you?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cThere\naren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\ndon\u2019t know that. \u00a0Look, Tae\u2019s whole point\nin starting the shelter was to help people with soulmate oddities. \u00a0The world doesn\u2019t accept them. \u00a0I just want to help. \u00a0I couldn\u2019t even believe I found this class to\nbegin with. \u00a0Some university in Sweden\nhas been studying oddities\u2014\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\ndon\u2019t like that word.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cSorry. \u00a0Unusual? \nNo, because there is no usual, not really. \u00a0Well, there is what society expects, and then\nthere are people who don\u2019t meet those expectations. \u00a0And that\u2019s not a bad thing,\u201d Seth\nemphasized. \u00a0\u201cSociety should change its\nexpectations, is my point. \u00a0Society\nshouldn\u2019t look down on you or treat you differently or anything. \u00a0But one way to help them stop doing that is\nto normalize the differences. \u00a0Everyone\nthinks things are a certain way because they\u2019ve been told that, they\u2019ve read\nthat. \u00a0If we tell them different stories,\nwrite down different stories, then maybe they\u2019ll stop being so, I don\u2019t know,\nignorant and awful.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nagree,\u201d you said slowly, because of course you did. \u00a0\u201cBut, my story, if you will, isn\u2019t over yet,\nso I don\u2019t think it\u2019s time to share it yet.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cFair\nenough,\u201d Seth said, finally leaning back and looking around the table for\nsomeone\u2019s drink to steal. \u00a0\u201cBut let me\nknow if you ever want to, yeah? \u00a0I mean,\nscientifically or psychologically, or whatever, it\u2019s fascinating. \u00a0But I also just care about you, you\nknow? \u00a0So I just want to make sure you\u2019re\nhappy with him and not feeling coerced.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cCoerced?\u201d\nyou said, frowning as Seth nodded.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah,\nlied to. \u00a0Manipulated. \u00a0I mean, he could be lying to you.\u201d \u00a0Despite your past thoughts and actions and\nwords, you felt yourself bristle.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nthought about that. \u00a0I thought that,\nhonestly, for a while, but I know now that he isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHow\ndo you know?\u201d Seth said, not trying to trick you or be mean, just genuine\ncuriosity and care in his tone. \u00a0\u201cI mean,\nif no one else can smell you and you can\u2019t smell him. \u00a0How do you know?\u201d \u00a0Reaching for a glass of water, you thought\nfor a moment before answering, looking out at the crowd.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHave\nyou met your soulmate yet?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cDo\nyou think you will one day?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nhope so. \u00a0I could live without her, or\nhim, but I know I would be glad to meet them.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cCould\nyou see yourself dating or being with someone even if they weren\u2019t your soulmate?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cTotally,\nI\u2019m not opposed to much,\u201d Seth shrugged, and you thoroughly believed him.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cAt\nsome point, they might tell you they loved you, right?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nhope so,\u201d Seth laughed softly, and you nodded, agreeing with his reaction.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cSo\nhow would you know, if they weren\u2019t your soulmate, that they loved you?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWell,\nI would just trust them. \u00a0Maybe know by\nhow they acted, too.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWell,\nthat\u2019s it then,\u201d you shrugged, smiling softly back at him. \u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s how I know Yoongi is telling the\ntruth.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cFair\nenough,\u201d Seth smiled back, lifting his\u2014or whoever\u2019s it was\u2014glass as a form of\nsalute toward you. \u00a0\u201cThen I am satisfied.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cGlad\nI could help,\u201d you said, laughing as you finished your glass of water. \u00a0The two of you sat in quiet for a bit before\nhe excused himself, saying something about wanting to check on Tae, and soon\nJun and Minghao slumped back into their seats, panting hard and fumbling to get\nwater into their glasses without making a mess. \nThe dance floor had become crowded as the music shied away from only\nslow-dancing, and the men were already sweaty, loosening their ties and leaving\ntheir blazers on the back of seats instead of clinging to their backs.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\nknow, for dancers, I would think you would have more stamina.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOh,\nno,\u201d Jun panted, \u201cthe opposite. \u00a0We dance\nso much, even a little bit more is like running five extra miles.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cStop\nexaggerating,\u201d Minghao laughed, slapping his partner on the back as Jun gulped\ndown water. \u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re just exhausted from\nall of the training plus shows. \u00a0No shame\nin being tired. \u00a0We still look better\nthan most of those fools out there.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cMing!\u201d\nJun gasped, smacking him in return, but Minghao just laughed, pointing at Ten\nand Taemin currently trying to out body roll each other next to Kai and Kimie who\nboth looked unperturbed. \u00a0Realizing he\nwas just talking about their ridiculous friends, Jun joined in in laughing at\nthem, especially when Tae and Hoseok joined in, entrapping unsuspecting and\ninnocent bystanders just trying to have a little harmless fun and exposing them\nto their shameless sensual twists and turns. \nHaving someone sitting with you at the table calmed your nerves a\nlittle, though part of you was still itching to move or leave or do\nsomething. \u00a0When Jun got up, mumbling\nsomething about finding more water, you sat next to Minghao as he smiled and\nhummed while watching his friends.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHey,\nMinghao, could I ask you a question?\u201d you finally said, eyeing the way Jimin\nand Jungkook were dancing slowly and closely, more rocking and whispering into\neach other\u2019s ears, despite the upbeat tempo and grinding of bodies all around\nthem.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOf\ncourse.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\nknow Yoongi? \u00a0The guy DJing over there?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah,\nof course I know Min Yoongi,\u201d he laughed, not even needing to look.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nwas wondering\u2014well, there\u2019s this girl at the shelter who can smell everyone\u2019s\nsoulmate scent.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOh,\nwow,\u201d Minghao breathed, his smile fading. \n\u201cWait, like me?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cNot\nquite. \u00a0Tae explained it like she smells\neveryone\u2019s, so she thinks everyone is her soulmate.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOh,\nwow,\u201d Minghao said again, his eyes going impossibly wide. \u00a0\u201cShit. \nFuck. \u00a0That\u2019s. \u00a0Wow, that must be awful.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\ndon\u2019t know,\u201d you shrugged. \u00a0\u201cI mean, I\nimagine so. \u00a0Not exactly easy to deal\nwith. \u00a0I just thought, maybe some day, if\nyou have time, after the show and everything, that you could talk to her? \u00a0You\u2019re the only person I know who could probably\nrelate to her at all.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOh,\nyeah, wow, I\u2019d love to,\u201d the man said, clapping his hands over his thighs, some\nbubble of excitement over the prospect growing within him. \u00a0\u201cWow, poor girl. \u00a0Yes, please tell her I will.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nwill,\u201d you smiled. \u00a0\u201cBut I was also\nwondering, well, she said Yoongi smelled like Christmas, and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d\nMinghao said, his smile fading and his face instantly serious.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d\nhe said again as you frowned.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\ndidn\u2019t even ask anything.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nknow what you\u2019re going to ask. \u00a0Everyone\nasks. \u00a0But I\u2019m not going to tell you what\nhe smells like. \u00a0The last time I did that\u201d\u2014his\ngaze searched the room until it fell on Jungkook and Jimin\u2014\u201cI almost ruined something\ngood for one of my dear friends, so no.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cBut\nyou didn\u2019t,\u201d you persisted. \u00a0\u201cYou helped. \u00a0You helped make this day happen, in fact.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cThe\nanswer is still no.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cBut\u2014\u201d\nyou said, sounding desperate.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t\nknowing he smells like Christmas enough?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat? \u00a0No,\u201d you huffed, crossing your arms over your\nchest. \u00a0\u201cCouldn\u2019t that be a thousand different\nsmells?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWhy\ndoes it matter to you, anyway? \u00a0You can\u2019t\nsmell him,\u201d Minghao said. \u00a0He shut his\nlips the second it was out of them, but it was already too late. \u00a0They opened again immediately as he surged\nforward. \u00a0\u201cShit, I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\ndid. \u00a0And you\u2019re right. \u00a0It\u2019s okay. \nForget I asked, or, almost asked,\u201d you said, standing up.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cY/N,\nseriously, I shouldn\u2019t have said that, I\u2019m sorry, I just don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nget it,\u201d you sighed, even if you didn\u2019t really. \u00a0If you couldn\u2019t smell him, why was it such a\nbig deal to just confirm or deny what someone else said he smelled like? \u00a0But Minghao was right. \u00a0It shouldn\u2019t matter to you what Yoongi\nsmelled like, since you couldn\u2019t smell him, anyway. \u00a0But to be reminded so quickly and bluntly\nwhen you were already feeling a little untethered and insecure did nothing to\nhelp your insecurities. \u00a0Standing up only\nmade it all worse, as the world seemed to spin a bit as you fought to steady\nyourself, reaching out for nothing until your own two feet started to move\ntoward something. \u00a0You weren\u2019t sure, and\nyet you knew exactly where they were heading, and you all but tripped or fell,\nwishing you weren\u2019t so tipsy and clumsy, into Yoongi\u2019s arms not even halfway to\nwhere you had last seen him, hiding behind some computer screen and adjusting\nthe sound as everyone else danced the night away.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d\nhe said into your hair, his arms already wrapping around you, steadying you and\nguiding you all at the same time. \u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s\nget some air.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nYou\ndidn\u2019t really want or need any air unless it was what he was sharing with you,\nso you followed him, no, walked with him, outside.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cThe\nmusic,\u201d you mumbled half-heartedly, but he only chuckled and pulled you closer,\namazing you at his ability to not trip or let you trip even though not one of\nyour four legs combined were walking in a straight line out the doors.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nset up a list. \u00a0I\u2019m not even needed.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s\nnot true,\u201d you sighed into his chest, feeling like he must surely be carrying\nyou or you were both floating because you were moving still despite how much\nyou were clinging to him. \u00a0\u201cI need you.\u201d \u00a0He merely hummed in reply, but it went\nstraight through your hair and into your scalp and sent goosebumps all over\nyour skin, though that may have simply been the winter air. \u00a0\u201cCold,\u201d you gasped as you suddenly realized\nyou didn\u2019t have a coat on.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah,\nI didn\u2019t think this through,\u201d Yoongi laughed, hugging you tighter. \u00a0The warmth radiating off of his chest did\nhelp, but your legs and arms were chilled exponentially. \u00a0As he fumbled to open the door to get back\ninside, you couldn\u2019t help but laugh into his chest, the whole scene warming you\neven more, though not as much as when you finally did get back inside, both of\nyou breathing and shuddering in relief at how warm it was inside. \u00a0Still, he didn\u2019t lead you back into the room\nwhere everyone was. \u00a0You could hear the\nmusic, still, even if some words sounded slurred and the bass was louder than\nanything else. \u00a0There was no need to hold\nonto Yoongi anymore, but you still did.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cAre\nyou having a good time?\u201d he said softly, and if he meant at that moment, you\nknew the answer was a resounding yes, but you shifted a little to look up at\nhim.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHonestly?\u201d\nyou said, waiting for him to nod. \u00a0\u201cYes. \u00a0Everything seemed to go smoothly, and Jimin\nand Jungkook look so happy, and everything is beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cBut?\u201d\nYoongi said for you, hearing it already in your voice.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\nselfish,\u201d you said, hiding your face back in his chest. \u00a0He let you for a moment, perhaps thinking you\nwould tell him without any prompting, but you swayed back and forth enough\ntimes for him to finally nudge your shoulder. \n\u201cIt\u2019s stupid. \u00a0It doesn\u2019t matter\nnow,\u201d you muttered.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nsee,\u201d he said, his tone clearly not convinced. \n\u201cWell, I\u2019m having a great time, too, if you want to know.\u201d \u00a0Realizing how rude you were being, how truly\nselfish you were, you lifted your head up to apologize, but Yoongi was only\nsmiling. \u00a0\u201cBut I realize I would have\npreferred sitting with you.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOh. \u00a0Oh?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOh\nis right,\u201d Yoongi chuckled, his thumbs barely moving up and down in tiny\nmotions on your back. \u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s never\nhappened before. \u00a0And I\u2019m not\ncomplaining. \u00a0I didn\u2019t think about it, when\nI told Jungkook I\u2019d help. \u00a0I just\nthought, hey, music, I can do that. \u00a0I\nwant to do that. \u00a0I love doing that. \u00a0I didn\u2019t think about how hard it would be to not\nbe able to be by you, to whisper about how good the place looked or about how\nhappy the boys seem. \u00a0I don\u2019t really care\nfor big social events, so I didn\u2019t think it would matter, not sitting by you at\ndinner and refilling your glass and making sure you had everything you needed. \u00a0I didn\u2019t know a wedding would make me so\nsappy, but it\u2019s been really hard to concentrate all day, because I just want to\ntake care of you, and seeing you sitting alone was a sight I loathe, absolutely\nhate. \u00a0You should never, ever be alone unless\nyou want to be, you know? \u00a0Like, if you\nneed space or something. \u00a0But otherwise,\nI should always be right beside you.\u201d \nYoongi slowed down as you looked up at him, your mouth slightly\nopened. \u00a0You thought, for a moment, that\nhe must be suddenly reading your mind and revealing everything that you had\nbeen feeling for hours, which was, of course, absurd, but still. \u00a0\u201cIs that pathetic?\u201d he said with a crooked\nsmile, causing you to shake your head adamantly.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cNo! \u00a0No.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cThen\nyou\u2019re not, either,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHow\ndid\u2014\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\ncould say something about being your soulmate and thus being able to read your\nmind or something,\u201d Yoongi almost chuckled, \u201cbut I don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s as deep\nas that. \u00a0You just\u2014you\u2019ve gotten easy to\nread, is all, so I could tell. \u00a0And,\nbesides, no one likes to be alone, much less on a wedding. \u00a0Being single at a wedding is the absolute\nworse. \u00a0Trust me, I know. \u00a0I wanted to die at Namjoon and Jin\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoongi,\nyou shouldn\u2019t joke about that.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cRight. \u00a0No, I know, sorry. \u00a0But, I mean, it makes you feel incredibly\nlonely and depressed. \u00a0Or it makes me\nfeel that way. \u00a0And I was standing over\nthere, pushing buttons on a computer thinking how it didn\u2019t have to be that\nway. \u00a0You were literally right across the\nroom from me. \u00a0Will you be mad if I was\nkind of waiting to see if you could come up to me first?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\nwere busy working!\u201d you scoffed, hitting his arm lightly. \u00a0\u201cI was waiting for you to notice how unhappy\nI was and come make it all better. \u00a0What\nare we, twelve? \u00a0Isn\u2019t that sad?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cIf\nit is, then we\u2019re just pathetic with each other,\u201d Yoongi laughed.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cFor\neach other, yeah,\u201d you said teasingly, but Yoongi went a little stiff, and you\nlooked up again at him to see him staring at you seriously. \u00a0\u201cWhat?\u201d \n</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cDo\nyou mean that?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nyou repeated, looking around uneasily.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cDo\nyou really mean you\u2019re pathetic for me?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoongi,\u201d\nyou whined, not liking how teasing his voice was becoming.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cDo\nyou want to slow dance under the moonlight with me?\u201d \u00a0His hands moved to your hips as he started to\nsway back and forth, bringing your body with him easily for a moment.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoongi,\u201d\nyou tried to complain, but instead you just put your arms over his shoulders,\nfeeling even more like a twelve-year-old at some middle school dance with no\nexperience and no idea of how to handle the flurry of bugs threatening to erupt\nout of you like some flesh-eating alien.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cDo\nyou want to cuddle and watch stupid movies just as an excuse to be close to me?\u201d\nhe said, pulling you closer with a hand on your back so abruptly that you\nalmost squeaked in surprise when your hips collided. \u00a0He simply looked down at you for a moment as\nhe continued to move his feet in tiny patterns as you followed him effortlessly\nand wordlessly. \u00a0This wasn\u2019t dancing, it\nwas simply being, and even though you could still feel the cold from the door\nnearby, you felt yourself warming up as a comfortable heat crept up your neck.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoongi,\u201d\nyou said slowly, searching his face for something. \u00a0He was doing the same to you, and you weren\u2019t\nsure what he was after or wanted, but you were absolutely positive you would\ngive it to him if he simply asked or even told you. \u00a0When his head moved, yours did, too, tilting\nas you craned your neck to give him enough room. \u00a0He fit against you so well, always a little\nbehind your ear and a little close to your collarbone, but mostly just flush\nagainst your cheek and neck, and your arms went a little limp when his fingers\nwrapped around the other side or your neck to help position you a bit better.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cDo\nyou want to kiss me,\u201d he breathed, even as he did so, the mere side of his lips\ntouching your skin so faintly that you almost wanted to turn your head just to\nfeel the rest of them, \u201cuntil we\u2019re both breathless and desperate for more?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cY-Yoongi.\u201d \u00a0You almost gasped, like the pathetic, totally-gone-for-Yoongi\nperson you were, your fingers slipping to his collar purely to have something\nto hold onto. \u00a0Nothing he was doing was\nnew. \u00a0You were used to him rubbing his\ncheek against yours. \u00a0You were used to\nhim whispering things into your ear that may have embarrassed you at one point\nbut now only made you feel safe and wanted and longing for more. \u00a0You were used to the kisses on your neck or\nbehind your ear or along your collarbone that always stayed in the same area\nbut sent a shock through your entire body. \nBut you were used to Yoongi always initiating and acting. \u00a0You never reciprocated, and something twisted\nin your gut akin to regret and guilt, like you had messed up and had been\nhurting him by never giving back to him. \nYou weren\u2019t used to acting upon what you wanted or asking for what you\nwanted or simply taking what you wanted, either, so you were more surprised\nthan Yoongi was when you pushed back against his cheek and mumbled his name\nagain as you sank down onto his shoulder, rubbing your nose over the small\nspace of skin you could find above his collar. \nYour fingers dug into his shirt and tried to move the affronting\nmaterial out of the way because you suddenly felt desperate to find something,\nanything, even though you trembled all the while, knowing you weren\u2019t going to\nfind anything.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cDo\nyou want to smell me?\u201d Yoongi whispered, his mouth so close to your ear that\nhis words made you gasp and then groan in frustration even as you nodded against\nhis neck, searching and searching hopelessly. \n</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cShit,\nYoongi,\u201d you choked on nothing, on nothing but air and the lack of it, the absence\nof anything but pure, clean, unscented air flowing through your airway that felt\ntoxic and unclean and wrong, wrong, wrong.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cY/N,\u201d\nhe said so slowly and calmly and yet so clearly on the edge of desperation\u2014for what?\nfor you? \u00a0or for you?\u2014that you couldn\u2019t\nstop the desperate tears from pooling in your eyes that found themselves transferred\nto his skin as you tried again to find the rest of him. \u00a0Christmas? \nWhat did Christmas smell like? \nWhat did he smell like? \u00a0\u201cFuck,\nhold on, babe, I\u2019m sorry, I have to take you home. \u00a0Can we do that? \u00a0Can we go home?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah,\nyeah,\u201d you mumbled, not caring about anything but finding his scent. \u00a0Perhaps it was buried underneath his shirt or\nunderneath his skin. \u00a0Perhaps if you just\nsearched all over him, you would find it.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cY/N,\nhold on,\u201d he said gently as he took a giant breath, the air running over your neck\nas it rushed into his mouth. \u00a0The kiss he\nplaced on your neck was probably meant to calm you down, to be some promise of\nmore to come, but it only made you cling to him tighter as he tried to pull\naway. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he\nmumbled, running his fingers through your hair and placing his hands over yours. \u00a0\u201cI-we-have to pack up my stuff, then we can\ngo. \u00a0Okay?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cPlease?\u201d\nyou said to him, or to his scent, or to the universe, desperate for him to not\nlet go.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOkay,\nokay,\u201d he said, his hand on your back as his head moved back and forth as he\nthought. \u00a0You hadn\u2019t let go of him, and\nyou really didn\u2019t plan to, even as he managed to pull out his phone and call\nsomeone, the low drone of someone on the other end unrecognizable to you and\nunappealing. \u00a0You barely registered what\nYoongi was saying, though you did notice the way he stuttered and sucked in a\nbreath when you finally, finally started to mouth at his neck.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nHe\ndidn\u2019t taste like anything, not really, which you knew was a mistake, which you\nknew was wrong. \u00a0Except it wasn\u2019t, really. \u00a0You were the mistake. \u00a0You were wrong. \u00a0You knew he smelled like something\u2014what does\nChristmas smell like?\u2014and you knew he must therefore taste like something\u2014Christmas?\nLike those candy canes? Fruit cake? What did people eat at Christmas?\u2014but it was\nnothing, there was nothing, just smooth, warm skin that you were determined to\nfind something in.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cY/N,\u201d\nYoongi\u2019s voice brought you a back a little, though you still didn\u2019t leave his\nneck alone until he pulled on your ear lightly but enough for you to blink and\nlet go of him until his hands cupped your face and brought it front of his\nown. \u00a0\u201cYou with me?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nwant to smell you,\u201d you said, barely aware of the tears covering your\nface. \u00a0\u201cI-I want to do all that.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nknow, babe, me too. \u00a0Let\u2019s go home and we\ncan do whatever want, okay?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d\nyou said shakily, because it wasn\u2019t quite okay. \nYou were sure you could do everything and anything you wanted with and\nto him, but you couldn\u2019t smell him, and you weren\u2019t sure if anything else was\ngoing to be enough. \u00a0\u201cOkay,\u201d you nodded\nagain, though, because you had to let go of him so you could walk, and you panicked\nfor a moment that he was going to take you back into the main room where\neveryone would see how much of a mess you had suddenly become, though in\nreality it had been building up for hours or days or years, but he dragged you\nright past the hall, the music temporarily becoming louder as you passed the\nopen doors.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cStay\nhere for just a second?\u201d he said gently, placing you against a wall and waiting\nfor you to nod before he let go. \u00a0You did\nnot count the seconds he was gone, but he was back in a flash with nothing but\nyours and his coat. \u00a0He helped you into\nyours before putting his own on before sticking his hand out to you that you\ntook gratefully. \u00a0You end up clinging to\nhis entire arm, but he didn\u2019t seem to mind.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYour\nequipment?\u201d you said as he walked you outside, but he simply shrugged.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cCalled\nSeihoon, one of my sound techs. \u00a0He\u2019ll\ncome pack it all up.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cAre\nyou sure?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m\nthe boss. \u00a0Of course I\u2019m sure. \u00a0I ignored you for long enough.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\ndidn\u2019t. \u00a0You weren\u2019t, really. \u00a0I think, no, I know, if I really needed you,\nyou would have been by me in a heartbeat. \nYou were watching out for me. \u00a0I\nwas just wallowing a bit. \u00a0I didn\u2019t feel\nignored, just a little needy.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\nokay to be needy. \u00a0I\u2019ll give you whatever\nyou need,\u201d Yoongi said assuredly, raising the hand he was holding to his mouth\nto kiss along your knuckles. \u00a0You merely\nnodded, because you believed him. \u00a0You\njust knew, based on what he was saying and based on his past actions, that he\nwas telling the truth. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nBut\nyou also knew that he could never give you what you felt like you really\nneeded. \u00a0Still, you climbed in the car\nafter him and sat as close to him as possible, because if you couldn\u2019t smell\nhim, you would take whatever else you could get, and the quiet that fell as you\ndrove home, the urge and desperation fading into something more like\ncontentment and peace, was almost enough because you shared it with him.</p><p><br></p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Seokjin knew he was difficult. \u00a0Not necessarily difficult to please. \u00a0Just. \nDifficult. \u00a0He was a child in an\nadult\u2019s body, Yoongi once said, and he had meant it as an insult. \u00a0Seokjin was easily upset and riled up. \u00a0He was defiant sometimes to the point of\nbeing bratty. \u00a0He was picky and liked\nthings to be done a certain way. \u00a0He had\ngained a lot of real confidence, not just faking it when he felt insecure, over\nthe years and was willing to fight anyone who tried to argue with him.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But he was also extremely polite and\nrespectful. \u00a0All of his staff had always\nsaid so. \u00a0He had worked with countless of\nother actors and singers and models by this point in his career, and they always\nall agreed he had a humility like no other. \nHe was selfless and thought of others, always wanting to make sure they\nwere fed and taken care of. \u00a0He listened\nto the concern of all his employees, even down to the janitors, so he knew he\nwasn\u2019t all bad.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0So he was humble enough to know that\nY/N may have been right about needing to apologize to Yoongi, but stubborn enough\nto know that Yoongi wasn\u2019t completely innocent; it took two people to be in a\nrelationship, two people to create conflict, two people to not resolve things,\ntwo people to want to try again.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But it was bothering him. \u00a0It bothered him, for some unknown reason he\ncouldn\u2019t wrap his head around, to see Yoongi so happy. \u00a0He had no reason to be jealous; nothing about\nNamjoon ever left him unsatisfied. \nSeokjin may be hard to please, but Namjoon did nothing but please\nhim. \u00a0He felt a little faulty, though,\nlike a soulmate gone wrong, when he felt a twinge of remorse. \u00a0Some odd feeling of knowing he and Yoongi had\nbeen happy together for a while slipping away. \nHe wondered if they had ever been happy, or if it had merely been a\npre-courser, some fake form of happiness that wouldn\u2019t quite do in the long\nrun, that they both knew wouldn\u2019t last but was only getting them ready for the\nreal deal. \u00a0And when Seokjin had found\nthe real deal in Namjoon, Yoongi had had to wait for years until Y/N came\nalong, and Seokjin had to watch him suffer and hurt and push people away for\nall that time. \u00a0So he wasn\u2019t jealous, and\nhe knows he doesn\u2019t regret what happened, because it brought him to Namjoon,\nbut he was sad. \u00a0Sad that it took so long\nfor Yoongi to finally be as happy as Seokjin has been for years now. \u00a0He knows Yoongi\u2019s been happy, as his music\nmakes him extremely so like nothing else can, but it all seems pale in\ncomparison to how he looks now. \u00a0He never\ngot to see Yoongi look like that, and he knows it\u2019s no fault of his own. \u00a0He\u2019s not jealous. \u00a0He wasn\u2019t. \nBut he felt unsettled, still, and not just because Namjoon was\nsnoring. \u00a0He was used to that. \u00a0It happened every night, after all, and\ncouldn\u2019t be helped by this point. \nSomeone else might find it annoying, but it was endearing to Seokjin. \u00a0It was his white noise, a rhythm to rock him\nto sleep, his assurance that Namjoon was there and proof that he was sleeping\nsoundly beside him. \u00a0He would have felt\nbad for waking him up as he rolled over, but he knew Namjoon wouldn\u2019t care. \u00a0Knew he would wake up in a heartbeat if he\nfelt like Seokjin needed him.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cJoon. \u00a0Joon? \nJoonie!\u201d \u00a0So maybe it took him a\nminute to wake up, and another minute to realize who was waking him up, but he\nstill did, and even though Namjoon couldn\u2019t hurt a crab, he looked ready to\nfight.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWh-what? \u00a0What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNothing, you big baby,\u201d Seokjin\nsaid, patting his chest so he would lie back down.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhy am I awake then?\u201d \u00a0Seokjin waited until Namjoon fell back into\nhim, his freakishly long arms and legs flopping onto him dramatically. \u00a0Seokjin let out a dramatic breath of air in return,\neven though he was the one who started it.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDo you think I\u2019m a dick?\u201d \u00a0The rustling and rearranging stilled as\nNamjoon blinked, his lashes tickling Seokjin\u2019s skin.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhy are you asking that?\u201d Namjoon\nsaid, because of course he would. \u00a0There\nwere no simply yes or no answers with Namjoon, and even though Seokjin sighed,\nhe appreciated it. \u00a0Namjoon made him\nthink about everything that he did, and he wanted to explain himself to him. \u00a0Hardly ever to anyone else, but Namjoon was\ndifferent. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t even a soulmate\nthing; Namjoon just loved figuring people out.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSomething Y/N said. \u00a0About me hurting Yoongi.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s broad and vague all at the\nsame time. \u00a0Is there something specific\nshe said you did?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cShe said I told Yoongi that he was\nlucky to date me and that I told him when we broke up that no one would ever\nlove him.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDid you say all that?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI,\u201d Seokjin mumbled, buying some\ntime by running his hands up and down Namjoon\u2019s arm and back, whatever parts of\nhim he could reach. \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t\nremember. \u00a0Does it sound like something I\nwould say?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHonestly?\u201d Namjoon chuckled, the\npuffs of air tickling Seokjin. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sure\nyou\u2019ve said worse to him. \u00a0But most of\nthe time you\u2019re just messing with him. \nYour weird YoonJin language.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYoonJin? \u00a0I haven\u2019t heard that in a long time,\u201d Seokjin\nlaughed, as much as he could with Namjoon on his ribcage.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYour crazy fans and their crazy\nship names.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t remind me,\u201d Seokjin hummed.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBut he\u2019s always been able to tell\nmore than you when someone\u2019s not teasing.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHey, he said mean things, too.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah, but you always knew when he\nwas purposefully being mean. \u00a0He\u2019s much\nmore blunt than you are, and you know it. \nYou\u2019re super passive aggressive when you want to be.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2014I am,\u201d Seokjin sighed. \u00a0There was no use denying it. \u00a0\u201cSo,\u201d he said after a moment, twirling\nNamjoon\u2019s hair between his fingers. \u00a0He\nshould dye his hair before they left. \n\u201cWas I a dick?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes, Seokjin. \u00a0A lot. \nYou two were terrible for and with and to each other. \u00a0You know this. \u00a0He knows this. \u00a0We\u2019ve been over this. \u00a0Why the renewed interest?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cJust what Y/N said, about how I\nshould apologize to him.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cJin,\u201d Namjoon said seriously,\nrising up to stare down at Seokjin. \u00a0Some\nof Namjoon\u2019s stares Seokjin loved. \u00a0He\nloved when Namjoon would get all soft-eyed when he looked at him. \u00a0He would stare like no one would notice. \u00a0He blinked slowly as if he didn\u2019t want to\nmiss anything Seokjin did. \u00a0He would get\nserious and stare when he wanted to pay attention and let Seokjin know he\nmattered. \u00a0He would sometimes, though,\ngive Seokjin a look that Seokjin knew all too well. \u00a0It was the\nyou-know-you\u2019re-wrong-but-I-think-you\u2019re-capable-of-admitting-it-yourself-before-I-tell-you\nlook. \u00a0Seokjin wasn\u2019t a fan of this one. \u00a0It made him squirm and groan and grow\nembarrassed and a little bit angry even if Namjoon was right.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou never apologized?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t remember saying any of\nthat! \u00a0It was years ago!\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cJin. \u00a0Jin,\u201d Namjoon said softer. \u00a0Seokjin risked looking at him, and thankfully\nthe look was gone, replaced by something a little sadder. \u00a0\u201cYou know how Yoongi never forgets, like,\nanything.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cUnfortunately, I do.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSo, if you remembered, would you\napologize? \u00a0If you could, would you say\nit again?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThen apologize.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cEven if\u2014\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cEven if,\u201d Namjoon said, putting his\nhead back on his own pillow and pulling Seokjin into his chest. \u00a0He let himself be moved until no one\u2019s arm\nwas being slept on and felt himself grow sleepy again as they both settled\ndown. \u00a0Still, he waited until Namjoon\u2019s\nlittle snores rumbled through his chest again before he closed his own eyes,\nalready running the conversation with Yoongi over and over in his head. \u00a0There was no way to come out on top of it,\nbut Seokjin never really cared about beating Yoongi or being better than\nhim. \u00a0He already knew, in many ways, that\nhe was. \u00a0In other ways, Yoongi would\nalways be superior. \u00a0Seokjin could admit\nthat. \u00a0He could admit that he was wrong,\ntoo. \u00a0And if that helped Yoongi to be\nhappy, truly happy, happy like he never was with Seokjin, then Seokjin was more\nthan willing to help that happen.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Hoseok sometimes felt bad for his\nneighbors. \u00a0He wasn\u2019t exactly what one\nmight call a quiet person, but he figured that his positive energy and friendliness\nbalanced out. \u00a0Everyone knew him even if\nhe couldn\u2019t remember their names, and on more than one occasion someone had\nknocked on his door asking for help to move something or find a cat or \u201cborrow\u201d\nsugar or something, and he was always more than happy to oblige. \u00a0So he didn\u2019t feel an ounce of remorse as he\nand Tae tramped up the stairs as loud as a horde of elephants. \u00a0He wasn\u2019t ashamed at how they were laughing\nas loud as hyenas, either, as they stumbled into the walls while he fumbled to\nopen his door as Tae leaned on him and tried to catch his breath.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0To the untrained eye, the pair would\nsurely look drunk. \u00a0And Hoseok felt a little\nlightheaded, but, not to be cheesy or anything, he was just high on\nhappiness. \u00a0Not high. \u00a0That word made him think of actually getting\nhigh, which he had only done once, or, tried to do, but had promptly fallen\nasleep after taking one hit. \u00a0So, not high,\nas he didn\u2019t know what that felt like, but light, floaty, almost, like he could\njust fly away by how carefree he felt. \nWhich is saying something, because Hoseok is almost always\ncarefree. \u00a0But tonight, tonight, he\u2019s\njust, he\u2019s just. \u00a0He doesn\u2019t know. \u00a0He\u2019s happy. \nThat\u2019s all.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Happy, to see his best friend so\nhappy, happy, to see how two lives can merge together, happy, to know everything\nwas only going to get better from here, happy, to have Tae coming home with\nhim.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He was happy at how Tae had changed\nsince they actually started talking about their relationship more\u2014I know, what\na concept, doi. \u00a0He was happy by how much\ncloser they obviously were because of it\u2014wow, who would have thought talking\ncould do that? \u00a0He was happy with finding\nlittle bits of Tae all around his apartment, even if he usually liked keeping\nthings extremely clean. \u00a0He was happy with\nthe way Tae was catching onto his mood and he was getting better at reading\nTae\u2019s. \u00a0He was happy that they could\ntouch, and did touch, almost all the time wherever they went. \u00a0He was happy to know Tae didn\u2019t shy away from\nsuch displays and actually wanted them himself. \nHe was happy, even if he would never by the man\u2019s soulmate, to be with\nhim.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And, if he was forced to admit it,\nhe was happy with the sex, okay? \u00a0It was\nintense in all the right ways. \u00a0Tae was\nintense. \u00a0He sometimes got this look on\nhis face that almost scared Hoseok, and he had jumped and screamed a little in\nsurprise\u2014he\u2019s man enough to admit\u2014on more than one occasion when Tae randomly\nbit him or spanked him without any precursor. \nAnd he had gone still, too, which is pretty impressive considering how\nmuch he is always moving, more than once when Tae suddenly touched him like he\nwas made of glass or whispered so softly in his ear how much he loved him. \u00a0He loved those moments, all of those moments,\nbecause, if nothing else, Tae kept Hoseok on his toes, and even if he thought\nhe had seen and heard everything from the man, he continued to be surprised and\nimpressed.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The first time Tae had said \u201cI love\nhim,\u201d though, Hoseok hadn\u2019t necessarily reacted as one might hope or\nexpect. \u00a0He\u2019d, well, uh, accidentally\nflailed a bit and elbowed Tae so hard in the ribs he had a bruise the next day. \u00a0There had been a lot of squawking, if Hoseok\nremembers correctly, and profuse apologizing even though Tae laughed it off\nlike he did most things. \u00a0In hindsight,\nHoseok has been able to laugh about it, too, and is fine with Tae teasing him\nover and over again by warning him beforehand he\u2019s going to say it or covering\nhis chest awkwardly and obviously before he says it. \u00a0It never seems to take anything away from the\nmoment, though. \u00a0Love, in Hoseok\u2019s mind,\nis often too serious. \u00a0Or people try to\nmake it so. \u00a0The movies have an epic\nswell in the music when someone finally confesses. \u00a0It\u2019s pouring down torrential rain as if it\u2019s\nsuddenly a life or death situation. \u00a0The\nwords are said and suddenly everyone is crying and gnashing their teeth and\npulling out their hair because finally, finally someone loves meeeeee!</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Love should be carefree. \u00a0Light. \nHappy. \u00a0Hilarious. \u00a0And full of awkward human moments. \u00a0So Hoseok loved how much Tae and he laughed even\nwhen trying to lose themselves in the throes of passion. \u00a0He loved how gross morning breath was when\nthey kissed. \u00a0He loved how Tae would\nsputter when Hoseok introduced him as his boyfriend to random strangers who\ndefinitely did not ask. \u00a0He loved how\nthey still fumbled to undress each other and laughed when one of them tried to\nbe \u201ctoo sexy\u201d and couldn\u2019t stay in character for whatever nonsense they had\nplanned. \u00a0He loved that they were\nfiguring each other out, what they liked and disliked, what they needed and\nwanted, what they preferred and could endure. \nHe loved each opportunity to get to know Tae more and to grow closer to\nhim, and he knew Tae felt the same.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0So, stumbling into his apartment and\nkicking off their shoes\u2014that he would fix later into neat little rows when he\ngot up to pee or get a glass of water or something because he\u2019s not OCD but\nshit, there\u2019s no need to be so flippant when it comes to a little order in\none\u2019s house\u2014really felt like coming home. \nPulling on each other\u2019s belt loops and smashing a little too hard into\nthe kitchen counter on the way to the bedroom so Tae could suck on Hoseok\u2019s\nneck\u2014an action that sounds ridiculous and even humorous, as Hoseok first\nthought, too, as he laughed when he tilted his head back, but, as always, he\nstarted to get warm and wanted to pull Tae closer the second his lips were on\nhim\u2014was commonplace, so much so that Hoseok never left anything glass on any\ncountertops or tables anymore for fear of breaking something in the middle of making\nout. \u00a0Trying to race each other to the\nbedroom and see who could undress the other first\u2014Hoseok always, always won,\nand he\u2019d like to think he\u2019s just that good with his hands, but Tae seemed to\nlet him win every time because Hoseok had figured out that secretly Tae like\nhaving someone else peel his shirt off and pull his pants down and leave him\nthere to shiver for a few seconds\u2014seemed like second nature at this point.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And, on most nights, pulling each\nother into bed and roaming all over each other and never letting the other go\nwould be expected. \u00a0It was hard to resist\neach other when they were in full display for the other, standing or sitting or\nlying there in waiting, inches and inches of tan skin waiting to be touched and\nkissed, to be worshiped and loved. \u00a0It\nwas what Hoseok expected, even, because something about going to a wedding\nalways made him remember how much he loved love, and he loved Tae. \u00a0He told him as often as he could. \u00a0Loved how Tae seemed to have no trouble\nsaying it to him but still blushed a little when Hoseok reciprocated. \u00a0So to take him to bed and, as someone more\ncrass might say, have his way with him, seemed like the most viable option,\nlike the right choice.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nBut\nhe slowed down once Tae was naked before him. \nThey were always too busy to be bothered with any lights, but even in\nthe darkness, Hoseok could see him. \u00a0He\nknew how strong he was beneath his soft layer of skin. \u00a0He knew how kind he was even when he had a\nmischievous glint in his eye. \u00a0He knew\nhow hard he worked to help others and yet how much he loved, at the end of the\nday, when he was tired or overwhelmed, being taken care of.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And Hoseok didn\u2019t know, could never\nknow, what it must be like to see your soulmate get married to someone\nelse. \u00a0If Tae and Jimin were anyone else,\nhe figured it would have broken Tae. \u00a0So\neven though he knew the two soulmates loved each other, and he knew Tae supported\nJimin and always would, he imagined Tae might be a little hurt even with how\nmuch he smiled and danced and laughed at the wedding. \u00a0He knew he might be feeling a little lost and\nleft out and inadequate and lonely and incomplete and hopeless and scared and\nworried about his own future. \u00a0He might,\njust might, if Hoseok is feeling extra brave to consider, have been looking to\nHoseok so much the whole day for reassurance. \nHe might have been watching him to try to catch a glimpse of something,\nsome spark of hope that one day it might be them getting married. \u00a0And Hoseok would be damned if he wasn\u2019t going\nto do everything he could to make sure Tae had nothing to worry about, to make\nsure he knew he was loved and valued and appreciated and enough, more than\nenough.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m going to take care of you,\u201d\nHoseok said firmly even though it came out as a whisper. \u00a0It must have surprised Tae, whether because\nhe always seemed a little surprised when Hoseok said such words or because the\nchange in speed and volume of everything gave him a little whiplash, because he\ngrew still and quiet, so Hoseok waited as he took his hand until Tae nodded\nbefore leading him to the bathroom. \u00a0He\nsmiled at him as Tae stood with his hands in front of him, waiting while Hoseok\nfilled up the bathtub until he got cold or couldn\u2019t wait any longer and wrapped\nhimself around Hoseok, leaning against his back while the sound of water\nrushing calmed him down. \u00a0He went\nwillingly once Hoseok helped him step in and watched with not an eager or\nexcited eye but a look of admiration and appreciation as Hoseok finished\nundressing to get in behind him. \u00a0He\nmelted a little into Hoseok\u2019s chest and a little more as Hoseok ran his hands\nall over him, but Hoseok didn\u2019t feel any less light or carefree or, for lack of\na better word, high. \u00a0If anything, he\nfelt more-so. \u00a0The more Tae relaxed into\nhim, he more at ease he felt. \u00a0They fit\ntogether perfectly even if they weren\u2019t \u201cdestined\u201d to be. \u00a0And since there was no hurry, because Hoseok\nwas going to be there when Tae woke up in the morning, he was going to be there\neven when Tae lost his cool a little and got impatient and snapped at him over something\nminor, he was going to be there even when Tae needed his soulmate more than he\nneeded a boyfriend, Hoseok took his time on Tae.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He washed him carefully, making sure\nto get off all of the smells that didn\u2019t belong to him. \u00a0That weird Aunt Sally and friend-of-a-friend\nwho had danced a little too closely and someone\u2019s cigarette smell and something\nelse Hoseok couldn\u2019t pinpoint that definitely wasn\u2019t Tae or him\u2014or Jimin or\nJungkook or Y/N or Yoongi, the only other smells he would allow. \u00a0Tonight, he wanted Tae to smell like Tae, and\na little like him, because he\u2019s a human with a tiny trace of possessiveness in\nhim as we all have. \u00a0Hoseok wants him to\nknow that he\u2019s his. \u00a0So he washed him\ncarefully and completely, and he patted him dry and wrapped him up in his\nsoftest robe that Tae had once made fun of but now tried to steal every time he\nwas over. \u00a0And he held him before they\ncould even brush their teeth, even before he could get either of them dressed\napart from the furry robe, and just let them breathe together, closing their\neyes before sleep came. \u00a0Eventually, he\nhelped Tae get dressed in Hoseok\u2019s flannel pants and into bed where he slid in\nnext to him and pulled him close and just stared at him until Tae\u2019s eyelids\nstarted to flutter. \u00a0He kissed him,\nthen. \u00a0On his hair and forehead and cheek\nand chin and nose and eyelashes and temple and knuckles and neck and chest and\nribcage and stomach and collarbone and everywhere he could reach, saving his\nlips for last. \u00a0He took his time. \u00a0There was no hurry. \u00a0No rush. \n</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He would kiss Tae until he fell\nasleep, and Hoseok would keep kissing him until he fell asleep himself.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ducking out of one\u2019s own wedding may\nbe a little frowned on, but Jimin had moved past what other people thought\nyears ago. \u00a0Besides, they had only\ninvited people who wouldn\u2019t be so judgmental and petty, and everyone was still\nhaving plenty of fun when he pulled Jungkook away. \u00a0It hadn\u2019t taken long to read Jungkook\u2019s\nuncomfortable cues, anyway, and he had learned early on that Jungkook was an\nintrovert unlike himself and Tae and Hoseok. \nHonestly, he was surprised the boy could keep up with the three of them\nso well, but he supposes it was just a testament to how much he liked them\nall. \u00a0Still, Jimin could tell when his\nsmiles shifted from genuine happiness to politeness, and that was when he knew it\nwas time to go. \u00a0He had kept the boy as\nclose as possible all night if only to give them some semblance of their own\npersonal bubble when really everyone wanted to be in their space. \u00a0It was to expected; you invite people to a\nwedding to share the experience with them, but Jimin could tell Jungkook was\ngetting exhausted, and even though the boy protested, actually daring to\ncomplain about proper decorum or some ridiculous shit no eighteen-year-old would\nnormally say, Jimin dragged him out, anyway.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He was flushed from dancing or from\nhappiness or from embarrassment, Jimin wasn\u2019t quite sure, but either way the\nboy looked good, and he was his now. \u00a0The\nidea made him pause and consider the boy sitting so close to him in the car on\ntheir way home. \u00a0Jungkook had the ability\nto be giggly and breathtaking one moment and teasing and sultry the next, and\nif Jimin wasn\u2019t so confidence in himself, it might confuse and intimidate him,\nbut it only made him feel more endeared to the boy. \u00a0He hadn\u2019t ever felt like a very possessive\nperson; protective, yes, fiercely so, but having Tae as a soulmate had always\nmeant he shared everything he could with everyone he could. \u00a0It was simply their nature, and Tae brought out\na side in him that made him want to simply give and give to others as much as\nhe could. \u00a0So the idea of having someone\nto himself, even though he knew he didn\u2019t own Jungkook, it was nothing like that,\nwas new and, frankly, a little overwhelming. \nHe had fleeting thoughts of Tae throughout the ceremony and even now,\nthoughts he had to gently push aside. \u00a0He\nwas doing nothing wrong, and while he and Tae could share Jungkook in other\nways, now wasn\u2019t the time for that. \u00a0He\nwas to have Jungkook like Tae never could, like Hoseok never could, like no one\nelse ever had and no one else ever could.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cJungkook,\u201d he found himself saying,\nsuddenly overwhelmed with the thought. \u00a0He\nknew the boy was nervous even if he wanted it. \nAnd for weeks Jimin hadn\u2019t been nervous but had wanted to wait. \u00a0He couldn\u2019t let Jungkook know he was nervous\nnow for fear that the boy would misread his hesitation as repulsion or a lack\nof desire. \u00a0If anything, he simply wasn\u2019t\nsure how to handle how much he wanted the boy. \nHe wanted him to laugh and smile and squirm and moan and sigh and\nbeg. \u00a0He wanted all of him, whatever that\nlooked and felt and sounded and smelled like.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And the boy just looked at him,\nsweetly and expectantly with a touch of anxiety that Jimin wanted to kiss\naway. \u00a0So he did.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And Jimin was used to being\ngraceful. \u00a0Tae had always been a little\nclumsy, had fumbled and gotten overly excited and eager the few times they had\ndone anything that crossed the border of platonic friends, but Jimin had always\nbeen calm and collected, cool and in charge. \nIt was expected of him, as a dancer, in some way, to remember how to\nbreathe and know the placement of his hands, to remember the moves, of when to\npush and when to pull, of when to go fast and when to go slow, so while he stumbled\nup the stairs and stumbled into their apartment as Jungkook clung to him and\ntried to wrestle him out of his clothes, he regained his composure once they\nmade it to their room that was definitely theirs now, no longer just Jimin\u2019s. \u00a0Jungkook seemed to be seeping into Jimin\u2019s\nspace and Jimin\u2019s being already, and if the desperate noises coming from\nJungkook\u2019s mouth were any indication of how effected he was, too, then Jimin\nknew the boy just wanted to be close to Jimin as much as possible. \u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Still, he found it in himself to\nslow down, to hold the boy, to touch him all over.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cJungkook, Jungkook,\u201d he said somewhere\nbetween their shirts on and their skin bare. \n\u201cI\u2019m yours.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAnd I\u2019m yours,\u201d Jungkook almost\nwhined back, capturing Jimin\u2019s lips to shut him up, but Jimin wasn\u2019t done, so\nhe let the boy kiss him for a moment before pulling him back.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNow and always,\u201d he said seriously,\nstaring into the boy\u2019s eyes. \u00a0Jungkook\u2019s\neyes were wide but they softened a little as he stared back at Jimin, repeating\nthe words he might as well have tattooed on his brain by this point.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNo matter what the world says.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cUntil the world ends,\u201d Jimin\ncontinued.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOr my soul stops,\u201d Jungkook\nbreathed, taking a deep breath and resting his forehead against Jimin\u2019s.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou have me now and forever,\u201d Jimin\nsaid, trying to sooth him while touching him all over all at the same\ntime. \u00a0\u201cSo there\u2019s no hurry. \u00a0You love me? \u00a0You trust me?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI love you,\u201d Jungkook almost\nsobbed. \u00a0\u201cI trust you. \u00a0Now touch me.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cCalm down,\u201d Jimin almost laughed,\nbut he touched Jungkook, anyway. \u00a0He was\ntouching him, and he would keep touching him. \nHe could touch him anywhere now, so he would. \u00a0\u201cWe have all night. \u00a0We have all our lives.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s real nice,\u201d Jungkook sighed\nagain before grabbing Jimin again. \u00a0\u201cBut\nI want you right now.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOkay,\u201d Jimin laughed, pushing the\nboy back onto their bed and climbing over him even as he peeled off his pants\nand followed with his own. \u00a0\u201cYou have\nme. \u00a0Now and always, okay?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOkay,\u201d Jungkook whispered, staring\nup at Jimin. \u00a0He had a bit of nervousness\nleft in him, something easily read as a desire to please and do well. \u00a0Jimin had no doubts he would. \u00a0The kid was annoying good at everything he\nset his mind to, and while Jimin might have the upper hand tonight for the boy\u2019s\nfirst time, he had no doubt that Jungkook would be a fast learner and would be\ngiving Jimin a run for his money in no time. \nFor now, Jimin was going to savor how eager and willing he was. \u00a0He was going to take his time, spend as much\ntime as Jungkook could stand, was going to test his patience and stamina. \u00a0And it would take time, to learn what\nJungkook liked and didn\u2019t like, but Jimin could be patient, clearly more patient\nthan Jungkook could be. \u00a0He would learn\nwhat made the boy preen and blush, and he would enjoy every second of it.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cJungkook,\u201d he said, trying to keep\nhis voice steady when he just wanted to laugh and blow raspberries all over his\nhardened stomach, \u201chusband.\u201d \u00a0Jungkook\u2019s\nbreath hitched a little at that, which made Jimin smile wider. \u00a0\u201cMine,\u201d he whispered, watching Jungkook nod\nand reach for him. \u00a0\u201cLove,\u201d he tried,\nsmiling even more when Jungkook closed his eyes for a second before opening\nthem, his pupils wide and glistening.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSoulmate,\u201d Jungkook said firmly and\ndecisively, pulling Jimin down until he was almost being squished. \u00a0He mouthed at Jimin\u2019s earrings and the side\nof his neck, anything he could reach until Jimin pushed himself off and\nproperly kissed him. \u00a0\u201cPlease,\u201d the boy\nmanaged when Jimin left his lips again to make his way down his body. \u00a0Jimin knew Jungkook could be a brat, so his\npoliteness was sure to fade if Jimin tested him much longer. \u00a0He decided to go easy on him for now. \u00a0He would probably go easy on him the rest of\ntheir lives, if he was honest. \u00a0He\u2019d give\nand give and give anything and everything that Jungkook needed or wanted. \u00a0For now, that was himself, as much and as quickly\nas possible. \u00a0So, with one final kiss to\nJungkook\u2019s navel that made the boy twitch a little under him and made Jimin\nsmirk a little above him, he gave the boy what he wanted, but moreover, he gave\nhim what he needed.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Relationships, like life, have many\nstages. \u00a0The infancy, with fleeting\nglances and blushing cheeks and stammered confessions and thumping hearts and\nsweaty palms. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThe\nchildhood, of whispered secrets and loud laughter and shared interests. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nAdolescence,\nthe wild abandonment and wild dreams and stolen kisses and promises made. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nAdulthood,\nwhen things became serious and mature, the settling down, the label and symbols\nof love, the inability to keep your hands off of each other, the desire to show\nthem off and declare your love to everyone you met, the swelling of hearts like\nnothing else, the belief that nothing could go wrong, that everything was\nperfect. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nAnd\nmiddle age, when things either grew boring or you settled into a pleasant rhythm. \u00a0When the mundane and monotony of living together\nand knowing what the other was thinking or doing without even needing to communicate\nbrought despair or contentment. \u00a0When\nsimply being with the other was enough or wasn\u2019t. \u00a0The time when a crisis happened or the last\npush toward peace and security for the rest of your life settled in. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nAnd,\nunfortunately for some, death, the end of everything you once held dear and\nthought would never end. \u00a0The uncomfortable\nsilences and broken hearts and prolonged absences that turned bitter until they\nburnt. \u00a0You had never experienced such a\nstage in any relationship and hoped you never would. \u00a0You knew Yoongi had, though, and you wondered,\nthough the idea was quickly squashed, if he was thinking about if things would\never end that way for him again. \u00a0They\nwouldn\u2019t, because you weren\u2019t Jin or anyone else. \u00a0You weren\u2019t just somebody for him. \u00a0You weren\u2019t sure what stage your relationship\nwas in with Yoongi, but whatever it was made you feel alive and terrified all\nat the same time. \u00a0He seemed to continue\nto have that effect on you. \u00a0You wanted\nmore and yet were afraid of taking too much, of taking something that wasn\u2019t\nyours. \u00a0Even if you knew deep down that\nhe was yours, even if you had spoken those very words out loud before,\nsomething still held you back. \u00a0You\nwondered, after listening to Jimin and Jungkook make promises to each other to\ncomplete each other and be there for each other, if you could fully give\nyourself to Yoongi while feeling like he would never fully be yours.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nPerhaps\nthere was no reason to ask that question, because you already knew the answer,\nbut you were determined to try. \u00a0You were\ninsistent on trying to prove to him, to show him, to make him believe you and\ntrust you. \u00a0Your actions and words hadn\u2019t\nbeen as clear as his had been, and you didn\u2019t want him to have any doubts that\nyou wanted to stick around, that you wanted to be with him and by him and as\nclose to him as possible.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nIf\nthat was pathetic, then Yoongi was right, and you were pathetic for him, but he\nmerely had to look at you for know that he was gone for you, too. \u00a0So you tried to push aside all of your\ninsecurities and invasive thoughts that weren\u2019t of Yoongi and Yoongi only as\nyou got back home.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nIt\nwas home. \u00a0Some part of you knew this and\nbelieved this. \u00a0Felt it to be true as you\ntoed off your shoes to pick up and carry to the closet as Yoongi went to get a\ncouple of glasses of water. \u00a0You knew his\nplace was home by the flowers that always seemed new in the vases spread around\nthe house. \u00a0They were, if nothing else,\nthe answer for your earlier question. \nBecause flowers, like relationships, also go through the stages of\nlife. \u00a0And the jasmine scattered throughout\nYoongi\u2019s house were always thriving. \u00a0You\nnever saw one of them wilt or die. \u00a0You\nknew they had to; there was nothing magical about them. \u00a0But Yoongi never let them got to that point,\nor at least never let you see them. \u00a0And\nit was almost silly, really, you, who worked in a flower shop and knew every\nname of every flower and every meaning behind them, to step into Yoongi\u2019s room\nthat was now also yours and to stop and simply stare at the flowers by his bed,\nfinally realizing where the two of you stood.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nIt\nshould have been easy, then, to turn around and just tell him or show him when\nhe came into the room and looked at you just standing there, but you felt like\nyou could barely breathe much less speak or make sense of whatever you were\nfeeling. \u00a0Perhaps you were getting easy\nto read, or Yoongi was always that intuitive or aware of what you needed before\nyou had even acknowledged him, because he put the glasses down and reached\ntentatively for your hand, tugging you toward the bathroom with no sense of urgency.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cBrush,\nwash,\u201d he said, handing you your toothbrush as he proceeded to do the same, his\neyes barely leaving you in the mirror as he did. \u00a0You watched as he brushed his teeth, rinsed,\nand spit before you even moved to do the same, blinking away your stupor that\nhe might be registering as sleepiness. \nYou felt anything but sleepy, though. \nYou felt wired and jittery, twitchy, even, and your fingers were shaking\na bit as you tried to brush. \u00a0By the time\nyou finally were done, you stood up to Yoongi holding a face wipe in front of\nyou, and you closed your eyes for him to step close and do it for you. \u00a0You couldn\u2019t help grabbing onto his wrist,\nthe contact alone making you sigh and calm down a little as he pressed gently\nbut firmly around your eyes and cheeks to remove your makeup, more than you\nwere certainly used to wearing. \u00a0When his\nhand left you, you opened your eyes to see his face much closer than it was\nbefore, and you scooted a little closer, wanting to simply melt into him, but\nhis hand came back to your cheek to steady you, and you kept your eyes open to\nlook up at him even though it was difficult. \nYour eyelashes kept flickering, and your eyes seemed to be blurry and\nunable to focus, but all you wanted to do was look at Yoongi looking at\nyou. \u00a0You needed to watch him watching\nyou. \u00a0You had to see the way he looked at\nyou, because no one else looked at you like that. \u00a0No one else ever had, and no one else ever\nwould, surely.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoongi,\u201d\nyou managed to say as his thumb and fingers glided across your face and\nneck. \u00a0He just continued, his eyes never\nleaving yours until you practically nuzzled his hand, breaking eye contact with\nhim only to kiss his palm once before looking back up at him. \u00a0\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cCan\nI?\u201d he said, even though he didn\u2019t need to. \nStill, the question made you move, pulling on his belt loops as you\nnodded. \u00a0No one had ever asked before,\nand even though he could probably read your mind at this point and must surely know\nwhat you wanted and needed more than anyone else ever could or ever would, he\nhad still asked. \u00a0You could laugh at him\nlater, because kissing for the first time in a bathroom didn\u2019t sound much\nbetter than kissing in an elevator, but Yoongi had been right. \u00a0There was really nothing to compare. \u00a0You weren\u2019t sure if you had expected to\nliterally melt or explode, so you were glad neither of those happened. \u00a0You were glad you didn\u2019t start shaking more\nto the point of throwing up or itching to the point where you would bleed if\nyou scratched too hard. \u00a0You were glad\nyou only melted a little as your lips merged together. \u00a0You were glad you only shook a little when\nyou felt his fingers twitching against you before they pressed into your\nskin. \u00a0You were glad, and glad couldn\u2019t\neven begin to describe it\u2014relieved? Grateful? Satisfied?\u2014when Yoongi finally\nkissed you.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nLike\neverything else he did, he moved slowly but surely. \u00a0Once he knew he had permission, he didn\u2019t hesitate. \u00a0He controlled your every movement without\nbeing forceful. \u00a0And he left you wanting\nmore, so it felt extremely rude and unfair when he pulled away from you, laughing\nas you tried to chase him. \u00a0He ducked\ndown to your neck, though, which didn\u2019t surprise you. \u00a0He had staked his claim to that territory\nweeks ago, so it was naturally his favorite spot. \u00a0Wanting to give to him as much as possible,\nthen, you let him until your fingers started to twitch again, itching for a\nchance to do the same to him. \u00a0He seemed\nto notice your plight and chuckled again before taking both of your hands in\nhis and leading you back into the bedroom, flicking off the light as you went. </p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThe\ndarkness that engulfed you was a little too much, and one of Yoongi\u2019s hand left\nyours to turn on the lamp that illuminated first and foremost the flowers\nunderneath them before even revealing his face.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoongi,\u201d\nyou said again, looking between the flowers and him. \u00a0He hummed as he let go of your hands, and\nwithout even asking permission you finally started to unbutton his shirt. \u00a0With something to do, your fingers seemed to\nhave stopped their fidgeting, and his plain but offensive shirt was soon\nundone, and he let you push it down his arms until it fluttered to the ground. \u00a0His undershirt had to go, too, and he lifted\nhis arms easily as you tugged it up and over his head. \u00a0You had only seen him shirtless a few times\naccidentally. \u00a0He had always been\nextremely modest around the house, always making sure to at least have a shirt\nand shorts on around you, even though you had always figured he would prefer to\nbe wearing less clothes, especially to bed. \nYou had never really ogled at guys before. \u00a0You hadn\u2019t had girl friends growing up to\ngossip about boys with or giggle and point out who you thought was hot. \u00a0You knew Yoongi was fit and attractive, but\nhis looks had never been what made you desire him. \u00a0It was how he acted and treated you, and,\nhonestly, how he sounded when talking to you, that made you attracted to\nhim. \u00a0So his smooth, lean torso was\nmomentarily distracting, but it was the expanse of skin that mattered no matter\nwhat it looked like, and you splayed a hand over his chest almost\nexperimentally. \u00a0Yoongi was not ticklish,\nyou had discovered a while ago, though he did have sharp reflexes and would\nretaliate if poked in his side surprisingly. \nSo when he barely even flinched when your fingers touched him, you weren\u2019t\nsurprised. \u00a0Pleased, even, that he was\nletting you touch him. \u00a0You figured he would\nlet you do anything to him, but still, you were used to having things done to\nyou, not the other way around. \u00a0Exploring\nyour partner simply for the sake of exploring was a pretty foreign concept to you,\nand you could tell you were always losing your footing. \u00a0So you did what you thought you were good at\nand went for his pants\u2019 button and then zipper, and he let you, only stopping\nyou when you tried to pull them down his hips.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d\nhe said softly, his voice making you stop and stand up completely. \u00a0His pants fell on their own accord, and he stepped\nout of them before running his hand up and down your forearm. \u00a0\u201cI told you I\u2019d be good to you, right?\u201d \u00a0Nodding slowly, you felt yourself shiver,\nbecause you couldn\u2019t quite comprehend what he could mean. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cLet\nme just,\u201d he sighed, pulling you toward him and kissing you again. \u00a0If that\u2019s what he meant by being good to you,\nthen he could keep doing that and you would be perfectly content and happy. \u00a0His kisses seemed to be a distraction\ntechnique, though, and a clever one at that, because you barely noticed his\nhands unzipping your dress and pulling the material off of your shoulders and\ndown your arms until the cool air hit you, causing you to shiver again. \u00a0You could tease him later about not even\ntaking advantage of the dress\u2019 slip, but at the moment you had to hold onto his\nshoulders, his bare shoulders, which was a new sensation, as he moved toward\nyour neck again. \u00a0The familiar movement\nof his nose over your delicate skin was soothing, though, and helped counter balance\nthe new sensation of his hands running all over your bare back. \u00a0Yoongi\u2019s hands were soft, never calloused,\nbecause the man was the biggest softie you had ever met, and you knew Jimin and\nTae.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nIt\nfit his character, then, that he continued to move slowly and carefully all\nover you. \u00a0That he placed himself on the\nbed first instead of pushing you down into it. \nThat he never let go of your hand and always made sure you were connected\nin some way. \u00a0It made sense that every\nkiss he placed on every inch of skin he could reach lingered longer than the\nlast. \u00a0That he took his time and checked\non you and listened to you and asked you constantly with his eyes or his words\nif you were okay or if you needed something. \nIt made sense that he insisted on always facing each other. \u00a0To anyone else, he might have appeared vanilla\nor even lazy, but for you, and to you, there was nothing more intense about the\nway he looked at you, about the way he touched you, about the way he kissed\nyou. \u00a0Good couldn\u2019t even begin to\ndescribe how he made you feel, and your panting breaths and curled toes and\nsweaty limbs had hardly anything to do with why, when you insisted that he had to\nstop before you cried from how overwhelmed you felt, you somehow felt even closer\nwhen he curled around you and simply held you as you fell asleep, discussing\nthe wedding and the night and what tomorrow would bring.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nIt\nwas this growing feeling inside you that even without vows, even without being\nable to smell him, Yoongi was never going to leave you or let you go, and even\nif people called you pathetic, you knew you were never going to let go of him,\neither. \u00a0And even if you couldn\u2019t tell\nhim that, even if you didn\u2019t know how to say exactly what you were feeling,\nYoongi must have known, because he turned over and dragged you with him until\nyou were both facing his nightstand where the vase of jasmine still sat,\nglowing even in the otherwise dark room. \nIt was so much more than a mere flower, and it was so much more than a\nmere feeling that you had about Yoongi. \nStill, you knew it was only going to grow, and nothing could ever make\nit wither or fade or die.</p><hr><p>A/N:</p><p>OKAY, FIRST!</p><p>Let me just say a few things.\u00a0 I don\u2019t even know where to start.</p><p>Why does HOSEOK keep stealing the show?\u00a0 He is amazing.</p><p>Okay,

And their vows? UGh.</p><p>Also, where my singles at?\u00a0 Is it just me, or do you also have mixed feelings about weddings?\u00a0 They can be so depressing or so exciting. I don\u2019t know.\u00a0 Lots of mixed feelings there.\u00a0 Y/N just wanted to be next to Yoongi.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhat are we, 12?\u201d\u00a0 Seriously, these kids.</p><p>This part:\u00a0\u201c\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhe said so slowly and calmly and yet so clearly on the edge of\ndesperation\u2014for what? for you? \u00a0or for\nyou?\u2014\u201d has two meanings\u2013is he desperate for you (like he wants you) or for you (like he\u2019s feeling for you).\u00a0 Hopefully that makes sense.</p><p>I wanted to show our four relationships to represent the different stages of relationships, in a way.\u00a0 Seokjin and Namjoon are happily together, have been forever, are in that\u00a0\u201cmundane\u201d part where things are purely comfortable being together.\u00a0 Hoseok and Tae are moving toward that\u2013they\u2019re past the\u00a0\u201clet\u2019s just have sex all the time\u201d stage and moving into real love.\u00a0 Jimin and Jungkook are literally newlyweds now, hitting their honey moon stage.\u00a0 They\u2019re gonna, YOU KNOW, a lot now.\u00a0 And Yoongi and Y/N are FINALLY getting their act together, admitting their feelings, talking things through, KISSING YES.\u00a0 So that\u2019s that.</p><p>Also, Y/N and Yoongi got so domestic, oof.\u00a0 But I think it fits their characters, like Y/N kind of explains.</p><p>I love comments etc. as always!\u00a0 Enjoy!</p></p>",

\u00a0Loved. \u00a0Hoseok loved love. \u00a0How could he not like weddings, then? \u00a0Plus, dancing? \u00a0Alcohol? \nHot men in suits looking hot? \nWhat\u2019s not to like?</p>[[MORE]]<p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nHoseok\nhated anxiety, though, and found loving people who had hate in their hearts\nhard to do. \u00a0It\u2019s a testament to the\nnurture argument in psychology that Jungkook has turned out so differently than\nhis parents. \u00a0Hoseok has never really\ndisliked people as much as he has disliked Jungkook\u2019s parents lately, and if\nthe way Jimin\u2019s face was screwed up was any indication, then the other man must\nbe feeling the same.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nHe\nhad merely come to check in on Tae, and consequently, Jimin, since Jungkook had\ninsisted he was ready and it was time to start, so he almost closed the door\nimmediately when he saw two other figures in the room, but if Hoseok was a cat,\nhe would have been dead a long time ago, because his curiosity has always\ngotten the best of him. \u00a0Jungkook\u2019s\nparents aren\u2019t ugly people\u2014he clearly got his good looks from somewhere\u2014but\nthey were ugly people. \u00a0Desperation,\nsurely, or pride, must have gotten the best of their senses at some point. \u00a0Something had to explain why they seemed to\ncare so little about their son. \u00a0Hoseok\nknew it wasn\u2019t quite his place or business to stay in the room or make himself\nknown or listen at all, but something about what Mr. Jeon murmured about</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\ncan\u2019t believe we\u2019re letting him marry a man,\u201d made him stay. \u00a0Because he knew that there were people out\nthere in the world who still didn\u2019t agree with men marrying mem or women\nmarrying women despite that fact that soulmates often were of the same sex. \u00a0He knew shelters around the city and probably\nthe world were filled with kids whose parents didn\u2019t agree with them being with\ntheir soulmate purely because they were the same sex, but still, it jarred him\nto hear. \u00a0He only entered the room to\nshut the door so Jungkook wouldn\u2019t have to hear the rest.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re\nletting him marry his soulmate,\u201d Tae said besides his own soulmate, a fierce\nand intense look in his eyes Hoseok rarely saw. \nHe was glad he rarely saw it, honestly. \nAn angry Tae, just like an angry Jimin, or maybe an angry anyone, scared\nHoseok a little.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re\nnot even letting him do that,\u201d Jimin said, wrapping his arm around Tae for\nsupport. \u00a0\u201cI had to pay you before you\neven allowed that. \u00a0Now, as I know we\ndidn\u2019t invite you, I\u2019m going to have to ask you to leave, as there can\u2019t be any\nreason for you to be here unless you want something else, and you\u2019re not going\nto get it, whatever it is.\u201d \u00a0Jungkook\u2019s\nmother had the audacity to try to look affronted at the idea.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nam just here to see my boy get married.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHe\ndoesn\u2019t want you here,\u201d Jimin said. \u00a0\u201cAnd\nI don\u2019t either. \u00a0It\u2019s his day, our day,\nand you no longer have a right to take part of it.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat\nwill it look like?\u201d Mr. Jeon said, stepping toward Jimin. \u00a0\u201cWhat will it look like if his parents aren\u2019t\nthere?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\nwill look like what it is,\u201d Tae almost sneered. \n\u201cLike you aren\u2019t wanted.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cMy\nparents aren\u2019t here either. \u00a0They also\nlost the right to have any part in my life when they refused to accept who the\nworld had provided for me and I had managed to find and be found by. \u00a0So, unless you have a question about the\npayment I already sent you, or the paperwork we have already filled out, you\nneed to leave.\u201d \u00a0If Hoseok wasn\u2019t so\nhopelessly in love with Tae, and his best friend wasn\u2019t about to marry him,\nHoseok might have had to claim Jimin for himself. \u00a0He seemed to be burning with a passion that terrified\nand enthralled Hoseok.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nJungkook\u2019s\nparents seemed to think, or seethe, for a moment, perhaps looking for an iota\nof an excuse to stay. \u00a0Hoseok hoped, deep\ndown, that it was some buried deep love for their son that they wanted to stay,\nbut the way that they finally scoffed and stormed out, barely giving him a\nglance on the way, crushed those ideas quickly. \nTheir exit brought Hoseok to Jimin and Tae\u2019s attention, and they let go\nof each other so Tae could come to him, enveloping the man in a tight hug.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d\nJimin said, buttoning his blazer. \u00a0\u201cIs\nJungkook okay?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOh,\nyeah,\u201d Hoseok said over Tae\u2019s shoulder. \n\u201cHe asked me to let you know he\u2019s ready.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\nuh, tell him, yeah?\u201d Jimin said, still fidgeting with his suit. \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t want\u2014\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nhave no idea what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Hoseok said, winking and smiling\nwidely. \u00a0\u201cI saw nothing. \u00a0I heard nothing. \u00a0In fact, am I even here? \u00a0Are any of us here?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cStop,\u201d\nTae mumbled, nipping at his ear before pulling away, an arm still held tightly\naround his waist.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cSeriously,\nthough, you handled it well. \u00a0I don\u2019t\nknow what I would have done if they came to Jungkook\u2019s room.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cShit,\u201d\nJimin said, the idea having seemed to have not occurred to him as he rushed for\nthe door. \u00a0Hoseok made sure to stop him\nbefore he got too far, though, putting his arm out to pull him into a hug that\nTae quickly made into a group one.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHey,\nwhoa, he\u2019s alright. \u00a0Y/N\u2019s in there, and\nI told her not to let anyone in except me. \nYou know it\u2019s bad luck to see the groom before the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWell\nthen,\u201d Jimin sighed even as a relaxed smile spread over his face, \u201cwe\u2019re doomed\nconsidering I saw him an hour ago.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah,\nno, you\u2019re so gross nothing could doom this marriage,\u201d Tae said, and Jimin\nsimply blinked and looked at his arm around Hoseok\u2019s waist. \u00a0His soulmate didn\u2019t seem deterred, though, as\nhe pulled Hoseok closer. \u00a0Hoseok sometimes\nwondered if the two soulmates did speak telepathically, because Jimin laughed\nas Tae rested his head on Hoseok\u2019s shoulder. \nHe felt a little out of the loop, if he had to be honest, but he knew\nthey weren\u2019t being malicious or even meaning to.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cGo\ndo your best men duties,\u201d Jimin said, waving them out. \u00a0\u201cI need to finish getting ready.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWait,\nwe actually have to do stuff?\u201d Tae pouted as Hoseok tickled his side so he would\nstand up straight. A mere wave of Jimin\u2019s hand sent them off again, and as soon\nas his back was turned Hoseok leaned over to give Tae a peck on the cheek which\nmade the man smile as he straightened his own clothes before nodding. \u00a0\u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cReady,\u201d\nHoseok nodded back, even if he wasn\u2019t exactly sure that was 100% true because\nhe wasn\u2019t 100% sure what Tae meant by the question. \u00a0Still, he followed him out. \u00a0He would be a dutiful best man. \u00a0He\u2019d do anything to ensure Jungkook had a perfect\nday.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nNothing\nwas perfect in life, of course, even on the day of a wedding between two souls\nwho were clearly meant to be.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOh\nmy god, fucking, I can\u2019t, it just, why won\u2019t it button?\u201d Jungkook whined and huffed,\nhis fingers dropping lamely to his side. \nYou tried desperately to resist an urge to laugh at him.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d\nyou said as you closed the door behind you, since something needed to come out\nof your mouth and you assumed laughing at the boy in his nervous state wouldn\u2019t\nhelp anything. \u00a0\u201cLet me.\u201d \u00a0He thankfully did, staring up at the ceiling\nand sighing as you easily buttoned his blazer. \nSmoothing out his collar and adjusting his bow-tie even though it didn\u2019t\nneed to be, you patted him on the shoulder and stepped back, giving him a final\nlook-over. \u00a0He spread his hands open in\nfront of himself as if to be on display, and you nodded approvingly. \u00a0He still only sighed again and slumped into a\nchair before shooting back up immediately, smoothing out his coat and fussing\nwith his pockets. \u00a0\u201cYou look extremely\nuncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\nthink?\u201d he huffed, fiddling with his cuffs.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cAre\nyou nervous?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOnly\na ton.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d \u00a0The question was simple, but Jungkook still\nlooked up at you seriously as if constructing an argumentative thesis in his\nhead before he responded. \u00a0\u201cI mean,\u201d you\nsaid slowly, \u201che is your soulmate.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah,\nno, it\u2019s not that. \u00a0It\u2019s. \u00a0It\u2019s,\u201d he sighed, looking past you at the\ndoor again. \u00a0\u201cI just really don\u2019t want to\nmess up.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d\nyou said, fighting a smile again. \u00a0\u201cWell,\nwhile I try to make it a point to not quote him, my dad once told me that some\nnerves are good. \u00a0It just shows you care.\u201d \u00a0Jungkook looked suspicious, so you only\nshrugged. \u00a0\u201cI mean, if you didn\u2019t care, you\nwould be apathetic. \u00a0You obviously want\nto do well and make Jimin happy, so you\u2019re nervous. \u00a0Not that you should be. \u00a0You\u2019ll be fine. \u00a0Great, even. \nIt\u2019s just a ceremony. \u00a0What really\nmatters comes before and after, right?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d\nJungkook said, but he still looked uncomfortable or anxious. \u00a0You couldn\u2019t imagine why, as his confidence\nalways seemed boosted around Jimin lately. \nYou saw him anxious at the coffee shop, but that was different. \u00a0That was trying to please twenty different\npeople at once who were nigh impossible to please even on their best days. \u00a0He could make the perfect drink, which he\nalways did, and they could still get upset. \nThey weren\u2019t really upset at him, but he always seemed to take it that\nway. \u00a0It was understandable, even if sad. \u00a0You didn\u2019t like seeing Jungkook at work, so\nout of control and uncomfortable. \u00a0You\ndidn\u2019t like him looking so anxious now, either, but you really didn\u2019t think he\nshould be.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat,\num, exactly do you think you\u2019re going to mess up? \u00a0Hoseok and Tae have the rings, right?\u201d \u00a0A nod. \n\u201cYou know your vows.\u201d \u00a0A\nstatement, not a question, because you knew he did, but he still nodded. \u00a0\u201cIs it Tae? \nAre you worried about if it will be weird or something?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cNo,\nno. \u00a0Not much is going to change. \u00a0I mean, some stuff, but not much.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOkay. \u00a0So, what are you worried about messing up?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cJust. \u00a0You know how sometimes you meet someone who\u2019s\nbetter at you at something you want to be good at?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOnly\nlike every day,\u201d you mumbled, only half-joking. \nJungkook glared a little before he continued, not meeting your gaze.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cJimin\nis just good. \u00a0I know he is. \u00a0He has a lot of experience. \u00a0And I\u2026\u201d \nJungkook trailed off, leaving you blinking and struggling to be patient\nand understanding when you would much prefer him to just be blunt.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cAt\nwhat?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\nknow.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nreally don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\nknow,\u201d Jungkook said forcefully and slowly. \nYou were about to insist, again, that you didn\u2019t know what he was\ntalking about, when he raised his hands, made a circle with one, and proceeded\nto stick his pointer finger through it.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOh\nmy god,\u201d you screamed, doubling over in laughter, much to Jungkook\u2019s chagrin. \u00a0\u201cOh, oh my god.\u201d \u00a0Struggling to stop laughing, you reached for\na nearby chair to stable yourself, almost wishing like you didn\u2019t know what he\nwas referring to.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cStop,\u201d\nJungkook grumbled. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m serious. \u00a0What if. \nI don\u2019t know. \u00a0I suck?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOh\nmy god,\u201d you said, almost falling over again at his word choice. \u00a0He seemed to realize it belatedly, too, as he\nhuffed and his cheeks started to color a little. \u00a0\u201cIsn\u2019t\u2014wouldn\u2019t\u2014wouldn\u2019t that be good?\u201d you\nsaid between breaths. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s\nHoseok? \u00a0Isn\u2019t it time to go?\u201d Jungkook mumbled,\npushing past you to open the door. \u00a0You recovered\nenough to stop him even though your eyes were still watering, leaning against\nthe door to catch your breath and keeping him from escaping.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHold\u2014hold\non,\u201d you said, putting out your hands to stop him and steady yourself on his\nshoulders. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m sorry for\nlaughing. \u00a0Jungkook, I\u2019m just, it\u2019s just,\noh wow, you don\u2019t have to worry about that. \nI mean, I get it, but really, Jimin\u2019s experience, as you call it, will\nonly serve to help. \u00a0I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll take\ngood care of you. \u00a0Just, I mean, as a\nnon-male, I don\u2019t think I have much advice for you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\ndon\u2019t want your advice,\u201d Jungkook said, looking appalled.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cBut\nat some level it\u2019s all the same. \u00a0You don\u2019t\nhave to be in love to have sex, but I\u2019m sure it helps. \u00a0Just don\u2019t expect it to be perfect the first\ntime, yeah? \u00a0It\u2019ll probably be awkward\nand weird and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cGreat\npep talk,\u201d Jungkook said, trying to get past you again. \u00a0He easily could, you both knew, if it was\npurely up to strength, so he must not have actually wanted to leave the room,\njust the conversation as he let you stop him.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m\njust saying, he\u2019ll be good to you. \u00a0And\nthat will make it great. \u00a0Just be good\nback. \u00a0You\u2019ll have to tell him what you\nlike and don\u2019t like. \u00a0You know him. \u00a0He\u2019ll insist on knowing, maybe even to an\nannoying point.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah,\nyeah.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cBut\nthat means you actually have to tell him,\u201d you said, poking his chest\nagain. \u00a0\u201cAnd be honest. \u00a0It\u2019ll be good. \u00a0Like you said, he\u2019s good. \u00a0Probably good at it, too, but good more so.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d\nJungkook groaned.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t\nworry. \u00a0It\u2019ll be good.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cIs\nit good with Yoongi?\u201d Jungkook said so casually and yet quickly that you withdrew\nyour finger back just as fast. \u00a0The way\nhe blinked and then started to smile down at you was a sign for you to withdraw\nbefore he got the upper hand. \u00a0He knew\nthat the question alone was already an Ace card, and you turned to open the\ndoor, trying to push him back so he couldn\u2019t see or get out. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll\ngo get Hoseok, I\u2019m sure he has a lot of great sex advice,\u201d you said as loudly\nback at Jungkook as you could, shutting the door in his face before he could\nstop you. \u00a0The door clicked loudly behind\nyou and radiated through the quiet, but not empty, hallway. \u00a0The silence only lasted for a second when you\nsaw Hoseok and Tae standing across the hall, smirking at you, Hoseok\u2019s eyebrows\nraised. \u00a0\u201cNo, I do not want to explain,\u201d\nyou said, waving your hands in front of your face to get rid of any unwanted\nquestions or comments. \u00a0\u201cAnd I don\u2019t want\nto explain. \u00a0I\u2019m going to go sit down\nnow.\u201d \u00a0With the shared laughter of Hoseok\nand Tae fading behind you, you fled down the hallway to the small sanctuary, trying\nto slip into your seat unnoticed.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nYou\nmostly were, but the pianist\u2019s fingers misstepped, and a note went missing or a\nnote was added, something barely jarring in the flow of music but enough for\nyou to know that someone did notice you entering, and you ducked your head,\ntrying to not be a distraction. \u00a0The\nmusic continued flawlessly, but you still knew he was watching. \u00a0You found yourself, as the song continued,\nunable and unwilling to not look up, though, something drawing your head\nup. \u00a0So it was no surprise to see Min\nYoongi staring and smiling back at you from the stage, his fingers moving effortlessly\nover the keys as he didn\u2019t even look at them. \nIt seemed like he had been waiting for you to merely look up, because\nthe second you did and your eyes met across the room, his smile melted into\ncontentment before he focused all of his attention back on the piano in front\nof him. \u00a0If you had anything else to focus\non, you would have, but you didn\u2019t. \u00a0Completely\nshamelessly, then, you simply watched Yoongi as you sat and waited for the ceremony\nto begin. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nFrankly,\nyou watched him even after the ceremony began. \nYou had seen him that morning but had to rush out to help Kimie finish\ndecorating and help Tae and Jimin get things ready. \u00a0Yoongi had arrived in the past hour and let\nyou know via text. \u00a0As people filed in,\nmostly just Jimin\u2019s dance friends and a handful of people you didn\u2019t know, some\nindescribable anxiety started to settle in as the people began to, as\nwell. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t like Jungkook\u2019s nerves. \u00a0You had nothing to be nervous about, after all. \u00a0You weren\u2019t getting married, and nothing was\nexpected of you the rest of the evening since the flowers were done and you\nwere just going to go home and sleep next to Yoongi like you had been doing for\na while now. \u00a0Something about watching everyone\nsit down, leaning into someone\u2019s ear next to them to whisper something about\nhow pretty it was or about how the famous Min Yoongi was playing beautiful\npiano music, made you keep looking at Yoongi and the empty spot beside you,\nthough, and by the time Yoongi paused, looking over at you one last time before\nhe started the wedding march, you realized what was wrong, even if it made you\nfeel a little pathetic.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nWeddings\nhad always left an odd taste in your mouth. \nYou had only been to a few that you could remember, but even one could\nhave been enough. \u00a0Seeing people so in\nlove and so meant for each other\u2014each one you had gone to had been one between\nsoulmates\u2014had left you numb and hopeless, possibly border lining on angry. \u00a0While weddings brought two people together\nand thus their families and friends, uniting strangers and solidifying a\nrelationship between many people for years to come, they always had made you\nfeel even more alone. \u00a0Looking up at\nYoongi now, even if you knew you were his soulmate, made your skin itch and\nyour feet bounce up and down in anticipation. \nYou throat felt parched, and your heart beat too quickly and yet seemed\nto sink. \u00a0Curling your fingers together\nuntil your nails dug into your palms, you told yourself to calm down. \u00a0You were and therefore would be happy for\nJimin and Jungkook and not frown and pout and be upset that Yoongi wasn\u2019t\nsitting beside you. \u00a0It was just for a\nfew hours. \u00a0Afterwards, you could go home\nand be as close as you wanted to him.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nSo\nwhy did you still feel like you were going to be alone forever?</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThe\nceremony, thankfully, was short, and you were able to concrete on Jimin and\nJungkook. \u00a0They made it hard not to. \u00a0Tae and Hoseok stood alone on the stage near\nthe priest\u2014the same one commissioned to marry off Jungkook before\u2014something about\nJimin having<i> \u201ca ton of friends, but I don\u2019t,\nso no, only best men, no groomsmen. \u00a0Your\nside would be embarrassingly huge.</i>\u201d \u00a0They\nseemed unable to take their eyes off of each other, too, though it was Hoseok\nwho was eyeing Tae more. \u00a0He looked at\nhis friend entering with Jimin, but only barely, before his eyes went back to\nTae\u2019s. \u00a0His smile seemed to widen any time\nthe man seemed to catch his gaze and shoot him a smile. \u00a0They both looked sickenly happy and in love,\nso much so it might have looked to some that they were getting married.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThe\npeonies you and Kimie had picked for the wedding contrasted nicely with Jimin\nand Jungkook\u2019s mostly white suits, and you thought it appropriate and sweet that\nthey walked each other down the aisle, having no time or place for their\nfathers or mothers to do the honor. \u00a0The\npriest spoke not of anyone giving someone away, but of giving each other to the\nother. \u00a0Of meeting halfway and yet always\ntaking things all the way. \u00a0Of never\nleaving anything unfinished or unsaid. \nOf completing each other by being complete. \u00a0It was overly sweet and befitting of the two\nwho couldn\u2019t stop smiling at each other, even if Jungkook\u2019s face was almost the\ncolor of the flowers he held. \u00a0You kept\nstealing looks at Yoongi as the priest talked, relieved to see him smiling back\nat you, but you did look back at Jungkook when he handed Jimin the small\nbouquet he had walked in with. \u00a0The\naction had been completely his idea. \u00a0He\nhadn\u2019t cared at all, and Jimin had had no preference, about what type of flowers\nyou and Kimie thought would look best.</p><p><i>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s your job, not mine.\u201d</i> \u00a0But, naturally curious, he had asked why you\npicked peonies for them, and you had touched the soft petals in front of you\nthat you had brought to show them as you explained.</p><p><i>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI knew peonies were your flower the\nmoment I met you. \u00a0They can symbolize\nbashfulness. \u00a0But,\u201d</i>\nyou had said before Jungkook could contradict you, <i>\u201cthey can also mean compassion. \nIf that isn\u2019t Jimin, I don\u2019t know what is. \u00a0In addition, they stand for prosperity,\nspecifically in marriage. \u00a0I picked it\nfor you but then for Jimin and then for both of you. \u00a0It also can stand for someone bringing honor to\ntheir entire family through success, and you will. \u00a0You already have. \u00a0Jimin will be your family, and he will be yours,\nand you will be nothing but successful.\u201d\u00a0</i></p><p><i></i>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nIt was that, apparently, that made Jungkook think of passing or\nsharing the flower with Jimin, not only as a symbol of himself, but also to\nrepresent him giving himself and all his bashfulness to him. \u00a0You couldn\u2019t tease him for that, even if Hoseok\nhad, and you smiled to see Jimin receiving the flowers from Jungkook with his\nown smile even as they exchanged their vows. \nIt was strange, in a way. \u00a0Weddings\nare full of such small, seemingly meaningless or mundane actions and words, and\nyet said at that moment, done in that space, shared in front of your friends and\nfamily, they become lifechanging and binding. \nThe words Jimin and Jungkook spoke to each other were nothing new, even\nif they did put their own twist on the traditional vows shared between\nsoulmates. \u00a0Even this change was nothing\nnew, as a deviation from the norm was to be expected from the two. \u00a0But it seemed like the whole room held its\nbreath as the two spoke.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re\nmine.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cAnd\nyou are mine.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNow and always.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNo matter what the world says.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cUntil the world ends.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOr my soul stops.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You barely remembered to breathe even\nwhen they finished and kissed, a soft, chaste kiss that almost made Jungkook\nlook bashful again, though that was probably due to Hoseok whistling like a\nfrat boy at a keg stand behind him, because Yoongi was staring at you from\nacross the room, certainly not kissing you, and you felt incomplete and wrong,\nso much so that you stood up. \u00a0But Yoongi\nturned back to the piano, and everyone else was standing up, too, as Jimin and\nJungkook marched proudly back down the aisle. \nYou remembered to smile, because it was easy to, almost impossible not\nto as your friends passed you. \u00a0How could\nyou not smile at such happiness? \u00a0And you\nremembered to look back at Yoongi one last time before following the crowd back\nout, smiling at the way he was watching you leave. \u00a0Because, really, how could you not smile at\nthat?</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Being involved with the decorating\nhad its advantages, as you had had a say in who you got to sit next to. \u00a0You picked Kimie and her husband Kai,\nobviously, and Minghao and Jun. \u00a0The rest\nof Jimin\u2019s dance crew and Seth sat nearby. \u00a0An empty seat reserved for Yoongi was by you,\ntoo, though you doubted he would join the table for much of the evening. \u00a0He seemed to have teleported to the room and\nwas already set up at a small table with a studio\u2019s worth of sound equipment. \u00a0It looked much to over the top for a small\nwedding, but it was fun to see him work. \nWhile you saw him plenty of times at home concentrating hard on his\nwork, seeing him public was something new. \nHe was just as dedicated and passionate, perhaps even more so, and every\ntime you felt some weird sort of jealousy\u2014could you be jealous of music?\u2014it dissipated\nquickly only to be replaced with some weird sort of pride\u2014could you proud of\nYoongi? It\u2019s not like you had any part in what he was doing. \u00a0Still, it was hard to distract yourself from\nhim or with him. \u00a0You knew speaking to\nthe people at your table would be polite, but you just wanted to watch\nYoongi. \u00a0You also knew you should just go\nand talk to him if you wanted to, but you didn\u2019t want to distract him from his\nwork. \u00a0You also wanted to concentrate on\nJungkook and Jimin sitting next to Hoseok and Tae at the front of the\nroom. \u00a0There was just a little too much\nto concentrate on or to try not to concentrate on, and you eyed the alcohol\ntable wistfully, wanting something to help slow you down and dull your senses. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nYou\nresisted for a long time, thankfully, and were distracted by food and your\ntablemates. \u00a0Kimie and Kai had plenty to\nsay about Bomi and all of her antics, and Minghao and Jun had plenty to\ncomplain about from the company. \u00a0They\nquestioned you repetitively about why you hadn\u2019t been to the show yet, and you promised\nthem over and over again that you would. \nKimie, the busybody that she was, kept trying to get you to talk about\nYoongi, but her husband thankfully kept her in check, clearly more aware than\nshe was, or more caring, about how often you were glancing at Yoongi across the\nroom. \u00a0You stopped by your friends\u2019 table,\ntoo, but you didn\u2019t want to stay long. \u00a0You\nsaw them often, and you didn\u2019t want to hog their time. \u00a0Plus, Hoseok looked about ready to bring up\nthe conversation you wanted to avoid that Jungkook had been embarrassed about,\nand you weren\u2019t about to dive into that mess. \nSo you caught up with Seth and chatted about the shelter and met the\nrest of the guests with no expectation of remembering their names come\ntomorrow.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nBut\nby the time the dancing started, some fancy and rich but small meal nestled in\nyour belly, the lights dimmed and your desire to pout and wallow in self-pity returned. \u00a0As your tablemates got up in pairs to go\ndance, you merely sat and watched and sipped on the glass of wine that had somehow\nmade it to your table and into your hands. \nIt wasn\u2019t that you wanted to dance. \nYou really didn\u2019t know how to, certainly not like Jimin and Jungkook\nand, well, everyone else, seemed to know how to. \u00a0Dancing like everyone was doing was not so\nmuch about doing certain steps or even doing them correctly, but it was about\nbeing close. \u00a0This type of dancing, of leaning\nclose and resting a cheek on someone else\u2019s shoulder, was about intimacy, about\ntrust and a desire to simply belong to another person. \u00a0This type of dancing made your insides\nburn. \u00a0Or maybe that was the glass you\nfinished and refilled to avoid watching how content everyone looked on the\ndance floor.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nStill,\nyou turned back in toward the table and glowered a bit, an urge to pretend to\ntext someone coming over you. \u00a0You could\ngo on a quest for the bathroom or find something else to distract you with, but\nyou knew nothing was going to be enough. \nThe scraping of a chair nearby barely even caught your attention, though\nsomeone\u2019s hand refilling your glass was enough for you to look up.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHaving\na blast?\u201d Seth said casually with only a hint of sarcasm in his voice. \u00a0Unsure how to answer, you kept your mouth\nshut, and he put the bottle down slowly until you turned enough to look at\nhim. \u00a0\u201cDo you want to dance?\u201d he said\nonce you were, but you wrinkled your lips and brow in answer. \u00a0\u201cYeah, me either. \u00a0Just thought I\u2019d ask, though, as you looked\npretty bored.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cNot\nbored,\u201d you hummed, \u201cjust not much of a wedding person.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cMe\neither,\u201d Seth said, \u201cbut this one seems nice.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah,\nit turned out really pretty.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\nlook really pretty, too,\u201d he said, and you laughed, waving a hand at him before\nsipping on your drink again. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoongi\npicked it out. \u00a0I\u2019m pretty clueless when\nit comes to being fancy. \u00a0I feel pretty\nout of place.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\nlook it.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\ndon\u2019t look much better.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\ndon\u2019t disagree,\u201d Seth shrugged. \u00a0It\u2019s not\nthat he didn\u2019t look nice. \u00a0He cleaned up\nwell, but he clearly was someone unused to wearing tight, fitted, pressed\nshirts and ties practically strangling his neck. \u00a0You wondered if his sense of discomfort was\nanything akin to yours.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou,\nuh, didn\u2019t bring a date?\u201d you said, not sure how to simply ask outright if it\nwasn\u2019t just his clothes that made him feel out of place. \u00a0The idea made Seth laugh, though he didn\u2019t\nlook upset or annoyed.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cNah,\nno time for that right now. \u00a0Hey, can I\nask,\u201d he said, scooting his chair closer and leaning in a bit, \u201chow it\u2019s going with\nYoongi?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\nyou said eloquently, not sure if you were surprised by the question or his\nproximity or by how long it had been since you had looked over at the man in\nquestion or by how much you apparently had had to drink.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoongi. \u00a0 How\u2019s it going with him? \u00a0I only ask because I thought, when you left\nbefore Thanksgiving to go stay with him that you weren\u2019t too happy about\nit. \u00a0You seemed really sad to leave, but\nthen you didn\u2019t come back. \u00a0So I just\nwondered. \u00a0I mean, I assume it\u2019s going\nwell.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d\nyou said, sighing for some reason and sinking back into your chair, your\nposture surely not eloquent or attractive. \n\u201cYeah. \u00a0It\u2019s going well.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s\nit been like? \u00a0I mean, I\u2019m taking this\nclass on documented soulmate oddities. \nIt\u2019s so fascinating, and I told my professor about you. \u00a0She was, is, super interested. \u00a0So I just wondered what it\u2019s been like\nwithout being able to smell and all.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cSeth,\u201d\nyou said slowly as it seemed like he was getting riled up. \u00a0He rarely did, except on book club nights,\nand even then it was in pure ridiculousness. \n\u201cI\u2019d prefer if you didn\u2019t talk to other people about me.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOh,\nright. \u00a0I mean, I didn\u2019t say your\nname. \u00a0Purely from an academic\nstandpoint, it\u2019s an interesting case\u2014\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m\nnot a case study,\u201d you frowned, sitting up straight and putting your glass\ndown, suddenly needing your head to be clear. \n\u201cOr an experiment. \u00a0My experience\nisn\u2019t something to be documented or analyzed like some lab rat.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cNo,\nof course not,\u201d Seth backtracked, leaning closer on his knees. \u00a0\u201cBut don\u2019t you think you should tell your\nstory? \u00a0What if there are other people\nout there like you?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cThere\naren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\ndon\u2019t know that. \u00a0Look, Tae\u2019s whole point\nin starting the shelter was to help people with soulmate oddities. \u00a0The world doesn\u2019t accept them. \u00a0I just want to help. \u00a0I couldn\u2019t even believe I found this class to\nbegin with. \u00a0Some university in Sweden\nhas been studying oddities\u2014\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\ndon\u2019t like that word.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cSorry. \u00a0Unusual? \nNo, because there is no usual, not really. \u00a0Well, there is what society expects, and then\nthere are people who don\u2019t meet those expectations. \u00a0And that\u2019s not a bad thing,\u201d Seth\nemphasized. \u00a0\u201cSociety should change its\nexpectations, is my point. \u00a0Society\nshouldn\u2019t look down on you or treat you differently or anything. \u00a0But one way to help them stop doing that is\nto normalize the differences. \u00a0Everyone\nthinks things are a certain way because they\u2019ve been told that, they\u2019ve read\nthat. \u00a0If we tell them different stories,\nwrite down different stories, then maybe they\u2019ll stop being so, I don\u2019t know,\nignorant and awful.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nagree,\u201d you said slowly, because of course you did. \u00a0\u201cBut, my story, if you will, isn\u2019t over yet,\nso I don\u2019t think it\u2019s time to share it yet.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cFair\nenough,\u201d Seth said, finally leaning back and looking around the table for\nsomeone\u2019s drink to steal. \u00a0\u201cBut let me\nknow if you ever want to, yeah? \u00a0I mean,\nscientifically or psychologically, or whatever, it\u2019s fascinating. \u00a0But I also just care about you, you\nknow? \u00a0So I just want to make sure you\u2019re\nhappy with him and not feeling coerced.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cCoerced?\u201d\nyou said, frowning as Seth nodded.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah,\nlied to. \u00a0Manipulated. \u00a0I mean, he could be lying to you.\u201d \u00a0Despite your past thoughts and actions and\nwords, you felt yourself bristle.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nthought about that. \u00a0I thought that,\nhonestly, for a while, but I know now that he isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHow\ndo you know?\u201d Seth said, not trying to trick you or be mean, just genuine\ncuriosity and care in his tone. \u00a0\u201cI mean,\nif no one else can smell you and you can\u2019t smell him. \u00a0How do you know?\u201d \u00a0Reaching for a glass of water, you thought\nfor a moment before answering, looking out at the crowd.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHave\nyou met your soulmate yet?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cDo\nyou think you will one day?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nhope so. \u00a0I could live without her, or\nhim, but I know I would be glad to meet them.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cCould\nyou see yourself dating or being with someone even if they weren\u2019t your soulmate?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cTotally,\nI\u2019m not opposed to much,\u201d Seth shrugged, and you thoroughly believed him.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cAt\nsome point, they might tell you they loved you, right?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nhope so,\u201d Seth laughed softly, and you nodded, agreeing with his reaction.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cSo\nhow would you know, if they weren\u2019t your soulmate, that they loved you?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWell,\nI would just trust them. \u00a0Maybe know by\nhow they acted, too.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWell,\nthat\u2019s it then,\u201d you shrugged, smiling softly back at him. \u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s how I know Yoongi is telling the\ntruth.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cFair\nenough,\u201d Seth smiled back, lifting his\u2014or whoever\u2019s it was\u2014glass as a form of\nsalute toward you. \u00a0\u201cThen I am satisfied.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cGlad\nI could help,\u201d you said, laughing as you finished your glass of water. \u00a0The two of you sat in quiet for a bit before\nhe excused himself, saying something about wanting to check on Tae, and soon\nJun and Minghao slumped back into their seats, panting hard and fumbling to get\nwater into their glasses without making a mess. \nThe dance floor had become crowded as the music shied away from only\nslow-dancing, and the men were already sweaty, loosening their ties and leaving\ntheir blazers on the back of seats instead of clinging to their backs.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\nknow, for dancers, I would think you would have more stamina.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOh,\nno,\u201d Jun panted, \u201cthe opposite. \u00a0We dance\nso much, even a little bit more is like running five extra miles.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cStop\nexaggerating,\u201d Minghao laughed, slapping his partner on the back as Jun gulped\ndown water. \u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re just exhausted from\nall of the training plus shows. \u00a0No shame\nin being tired. \u00a0We still look better\nthan most of those fools out there.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cMing!\u201d\nJun gasped, smacking him in return, but Minghao just laughed, pointing at Ten\nand Taemin currently trying to out body roll each other next to Kai and Kimie who\nboth looked unperturbed. \u00a0Realizing he\nwas just talking about their ridiculous friends, Jun joined in in laughing at\nthem, especially when Tae and Hoseok joined in, entrapping unsuspecting and\ninnocent bystanders just trying to have a little harmless fun and exposing them\nto their shameless sensual twists and turns. \nHaving someone sitting with you at the table calmed your nerves a\nlittle, though part of you was still itching to move or leave or do\nsomething. \u00a0When Jun got up, mumbling\nsomething about finding more water, you sat next to Minghao as he smiled and\nhummed while watching his friends.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHey,\nMinghao, could I ask you a question?\u201d you finally said, eyeing the way Jimin\nand Jungkook were dancing slowly and closely, more rocking and whispering into\neach other\u2019s ears, despite the upbeat tempo and grinding of bodies all around\nthem.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOf\ncourse.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\nknow Yoongi? \u00a0The guy DJing over there?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah,\nof course I know Min Yoongi,\u201d he laughed, not even needing to look.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nwas wondering\u2014well, there\u2019s this girl at the shelter who can smell everyone\u2019s\nsoulmate scent.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOh,\nwow,\u201d Minghao breathed, his smile fading. \n\u201cWait, like me?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cNot\nquite. \u00a0Tae explained it like she smells\neveryone\u2019s, so she thinks everyone is her soulmate.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOh,\nwow,\u201d Minghao said again, his eyes going impossibly wide. \u00a0\u201cShit. \nFuck. \u00a0That\u2019s. \u00a0Wow, that must be awful.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\ndon\u2019t know,\u201d you shrugged. \u00a0\u201cI mean, I\nimagine so. \u00a0Not exactly easy to deal\nwith. \u00a0I just thought, maybe some day, if\nyou have time, after the show and everything, that you could talk to her? \u00a0You\u2019re the only person I know who could probably\nrelate to her at all.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOh,\nyeah, wow, I\u2019d love to,\u201d the man said, clapping his hands over his thighs, some\nbubble of excitement over the prospect growing within him. \u00a0\u201cWow, poor girl. \u00a0Yes, please tell her I will.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nwill,\u201d you smiled. \u00a0\u201cBut I was also\nwondering, well, she said Yoongi smelled like Christmas, and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d\nMinghao said, his smile fading and his face instantly serious.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d\nhe said again as you frowned.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\ndidn\u2019t even ask anything.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nknow what you\u2019re going to ask. \u00a0Everyone\nasks. \u00a0But I\u2019m not going to tell you what\nhe smells like. \u00a0The last time I did that\u201d\u2014his\ngaze searched the room until it fell on Jungkook and Jimin\u2014\u201cI almost ruined something\ngood for one of my dear friends, so no.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cBut\nyou didn\u2019t,\u201d you persisted. \u00a0\u201cYou helped. \u00a0You helped make this day happen, in fact.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cThe\nanswer is still no.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cBut\u2014\u201d\nyou said, sounding desperate.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t\nknowing he smells like Christmas enough?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat? \u00a0No,\u201d you huffed, crossing your arms over your\nchest. \u00a0\u201cCouldn\u2019t that be a thousand different\nsmells?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWhy\ndoes it matter to you, anyway? \u00a0You can\u2019t\nsmell him,\u201d Minghao said. \u00a0He shut his\nlips the second it was out of them, but it was already too late. \u00a0They opened again immediately as he surged\nforward. \u00a0\u201cShit, I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\ndid. \u00a0And you\u2019re right. \u00a0It\u2019s okay. \nForget I asked, or, almost asked,\u201d you said, standing up.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cY/N,\nseriously, I shouldn\u2019t have said that, I\u2019m sorry, I just don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nget it,\u201d you sighed, even if you didn\u2019t really. \u00a0If you couldn\u2019t smell him, why was it such a\nbig deal to just confirm or deny what someone else said he smelled like? \u00a0But Minghao was right. \u00a0It shouldn\u2019t matter to you what Yoongi\nsmelled like, since you couldn\u2019t smell him, anyway. \u00a0But to be reminded so quickly and bluntly\nwhen you were already feeling a little untethered and insecure did nothing to\nhelp your insecurities. \u00a0Standing up only\nmade it all worse, as the world seemed to spin a bit as you fought to steady\nyourself, reaching out for nothing until your own two feet started to move\ntoward something. \u00a0You weren\u2019t sure, and\nyet you knew exactly where they were heading, and you all but tripped or fell,\nwishing you weren\u2019t so tipsy and clumsy, into Yoongi\u2019s arms not even halfway to\nwhere you had last seen him, hiding behind some computer screen and adjusting\nthe sound as everyone else danced the night away.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d\nhe said into your hair, his arms already wrapping around you, steadying you and\nguiding you all at the same time. \u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s\nget some air.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nYou\ndidn\u2019t really want or need any air unless it was what he was sharing with you,\nso you followed him, no, walked with him, outside.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cThe\nmusic,\u201d you mumbled half-heartedly, but he only chuckled and pulled you closer,\namazing you at his ability to not trip or let you trip even though not one of\nyour four legs combined were walking in a straight line out the doors.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nset up a list. \u00a0I\u2019m not even needed.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s\nnot true,\u201d you sighed into his chest, feeling like he must surely be carrying\nyou or you were both floating because you were moving still despite how much\nyou were clinging to him. \u00a0\u201cI need you.\u201d \u00a0He merely hummed in reply, but it went\nstraight through your hair and into your scalp and sent goosebumps all over\nyour skin, though that may have simply been the winter air. \u00a0\u201cCold,\u201d you gasped as you suddenly realized\nyou didn\u2019t have a coat on.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah,\nI didn\u2019t think this through,\u201d Yoongi laughed, hugging you tighter. \u00a0The warmth radiating off of his chest did\nhelp, but your legs and arms were chilled exponentially. \u00a0As he fumbled to open the door to get back\ninside, you couldn\u2019t help but laugh into his chest, the whole scene warming you\neven more, though not as much as when you finally did get back inside, both of\nyou breathing and shuddering in relief at how warm it was inside. \u00a0Still, he didn\u2019t lead you back into the room\nwhere everyone was. \u00a0You could hear the\nmusic, still, even if some words sounded slurred and the bass was louder than\nanything else. \u00a0There was no need to hold\nonto Yoongi anymore, but you still did.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cAre\nyou having a good time?\u201d he said softly, and if he meant at that moment, you\nknew the answer was a resounding yes, but you shifted a little to look up at\nhim.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHonestly?\u201d\nyou said, waiting for him to nod. \u00a0\u201cYes. \u00a0Everything seemed to go smoothly, and Jimin\nand Jungkook look so happy, and everything is beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cBut?\u201d\nYoongi said for you, hearing it already in your voice.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\nselfish,\u201d you said, hiding your face back in his chest. \u00a0He let you for a moment, perhaps thinking you\nwould tell him without any prompting, but you swayed back and forth enough\ntimes for him to finally nudge your shoulder. \n\u201cIt\u2019s stupid. \u00a0It doesn\u2019t matter\nnow,\u201d you muttered.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nsee,\u201d he said, his tone clearly not convinced. \n\u201cWell, I\u2019m having a great time, too, if you want to know.\u201d \u00a0Realizing how rude you were being, how truly\nselfish you were, you lifted your head up to apologize, but Yoongi was only\nsmiling. \u00a0\u201cBut I realize I would have\npreferred sitting with you.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOh. \u00a0Oh?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOh\nis right,\u201d Yoongi chuckled, his thumbs barely moving up and down in tiny\nmotions on your back. \u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s never\nhappened before. \u00a0And I\u2019m not\ncomplaining. \u00a0I didn\u2019t think about it, when\nI told Jungkook I\u2019d help. \u00a0I just\nthought, hey, music, I can do that. \u00a0I\nwant to do that. \u00a0I love doing that. \u00a0I didn\u2019t think about how hard it would be to not\nbe able to be by you, to whisper about how good the place looked or about how\nhappy the boys seem. \u00a0I don\u2019t really care\nfor big social events, so I didn\u2019t think it would matter, not sitting by you at\ndinner and refilling your glass and making sure you had everything you needed. \u00a0I didn\u2019t know a wedding would make me so\nsappy, but it\u2019s been really hard to concentrate all day, because I just want to\ntake care of you, and seeing you sitting alone was a sight I loathe, absolutely\nhate. \u00a0You should never, ever be alone unless\nyou want to be, you know? \u00a0Like, if you\nneed space or something. \u00a0But otherwise,\nI should always be right beside you.\u201d \nYoongi slowed down as you looked up at him, your mouth slightly\nopened. \u00a0You thought, for a moment, that\nhe must be suddenly reading your mind and revealing everything that you had\nbeen feeling for hours, which was, of course, absurd, but still. \u00a0\u201cIs that pathetic?\u201d he said with a crooked\nsmile, causing you to shake your head adamantly.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cNo! \u00a0No.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cThen\nyou\u2019re not, either,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHow\ndid\u2014\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\ncould say something about being your soulmate and thus being able to read your\nmind or something,\u201d Yoongi almost chuckled, \u201cbut I don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s as deep\nas that. \u00a0You just\u2014you\u2019ve gotten easy to\nread, is all, so I could tell. \u00a0And,\nbesides, no one likes to be alone, much less on a wedding. \u00a0Being single at a wedding is the absolute\nworse. \u00a0Trust me, I know. \u00a0I wanted to die at Namjoon and Jin\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoongi,\nyou shouldn\u2019t joke about that.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cRight. \u00a0No, I know, sorry. \u00a0But, I mean, it makes you feel incredibly\nlonely and depressed. \u00a0Or it makes me\nfeel that way. \u00a0And I was standing over\nthere, pushing buttons on a computer thinking how it didn\u2019t have to be that\nway. \u00a0You were literally right across the\nroom from me. \u00a0Will you be mad if I was\nkind of waiting to see if you could come up to me first?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\nwere busy working!\u201d you scoffed, hitting his arm lightly. \u00a0\u201cI was waiting for you to notice how unhappy\nI was and come make it all better. \u00a0What\nare we, twelve? \u00a0Isn\u2019t that sad?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cIf\nit is, then we\u2019re just pathetic with each other,\u201d Yoongi laughed.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cFor\neach other, yeah,\u201d you said teasingly, but Yoongi went a little stiff, and you\nlooked up again at him to see him staring at you seriously. \u00a0\u201cWhat?\u201d \n</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cDo\nyou mean that?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nyou repeated, looking around uneasily.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cDo\nyou really mean you\u2019re pathetic for me?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoongi,\u201d\nyou whined, not liking how teasing his voice was becoming.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cDo\nyou want to slow dance under the moonlight with me?\u201d \u00a0His hands moved to your hips as he started to\nsway back and forth, bringing your body with him easily for a moment.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoongi,\u201d\nyou tried to complain, but instead you just put your arms over his shoulders,\nfeeling even more like a twelve-year-old at some middle school dance with no\nexperience and no idea of how to handle the flurry of bugs threatening to erupt\nout of you like some flesh-eating alien.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cDo\nyou want to cuddle and watch stupid movies just as an excuse to be close to me?\u201d\nhe said, pulling you closer with a hand on your back so abruptly that you\nalmost squeaked in surprise when your hips collided. \u00a0He simply looked down at you for a moment as\nhe continued to move his feet in tiny patterns as you followed him effortlessly\nand wordlessly. \u00a0This wasn\u2019t dancing, it\nwas simply being, and even though you could still feel the cold from the door\nnearby, you felt yourself warming up as a comfortable heat crept up your neck.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoongi,\u201d\nyou said slowly, searching his face for something. \u00a0He was doing the same to you, and you weren\u2019t\nsure what he was after or wanted, but you were absolutely positive you would\ngive it to him if he simply asked or even told you. \u00a0When his head moved, yours did, too, tilting\nas you craned your neck to give him enough room. \u00a0He fit against you so well, always a little\nbehind your ear and a little close to your collarbone, but mostly just flush\nagainst your cheek and neck, and your arms went a little limp when his fingers\nwrapped around the other side or your neck to help position you a bit better.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cDo\nyou want to kiss me,\u201d he breathed, even as he did so, the mere side of his lips\ntouching your skin so faintly that you almost wanted to turn your head just to\nfeel the rest of them, \u201cuntil we\u2019re both breathless and desperate for more?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cY-Yoongi.\u201d \u00a0You almost gasped, like the pathetic, totally-gone-for-Yoongi\nperson you were, your fingers slipping to his collar purely to have something\nto hold onto. \u00a0Nothing he was doing was\nnew. \u00a0You were used to him rubbing his\ncheek against yours. \u00a0You were used to\nhim whispering things into your ear that may have embarrassed you at one point\nbut now only made you feel safe and wanted and longing for more. \u00a0You were used to the kisses on your neck or\nbehind your ear or along your collarbone that always stayed in the same area\nbut sent a shock through your entire body. \nBut you were used to Yoongi always initiating and acting. \u00a0You never reciprocated, and something twisted\nin your gut akin to regret and guilt, like you had messed up and had been\nhurting him by never giving back to him. \nYou weren\u2019t used to acting upon what you wanted or asking for what you\nwanted or simply taking what you wanted, either, so you were more surprised\nthan Yoongi was when you pushed back against his cheek and mumbled his name\nagain as you sank down onto his shoulder, rubbing your nose over the small\nspace of skin you could find above his collar. \nYour fingers dug into his shirt and tried to move the affronting\nmaterial out of the way because you suddenly felt desperate to find something,\nanything, even though you trembled all the while, knowing you weren\u2019t going to\nfind anything.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cDo\nyou want to smell me?\u201d Yoongi whispered, his mouth so close to your ear that\nhis words made you gasp and then groan in frustration even as you nodded against\nhis neck, searching and searching hopelessly. \n</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cShit,\nYoongi,\u201d you choked on nothing, on nothing but air and the lack of it, the absence\nof anything but pure, clean, unscented air flowing through your airway that felt\ntoxic and unclean and wrong, wrong, wrong.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cY/N,\u201d\nhe said so slowly and calmly and yet so clearly on the edge of desperation\u2014for what?\nfor you? \u00a0or for you?\u2014that you couldn\u2019t\nstop the desperate tears from pooling in your eyes that found themselves transferred\nto his skin as you tried again to find the rest of him. \u00a0Christmas? \nWhat did Christmas smell like? \nWhat did he smell like? \u00a0\u201cFuck,\nhold on, babe, I\u2019m sorry, I have to take you home. \u00a0Can we do that? \u00a0Can we go home?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah,\nyeah,\u201d you mumbled, not caring about anything but finding his scent. \u00a0Perhaps it was buried underneath his shirt or\nunderneath his skin. \u00a0Perhaps if you just\nsearched all over him, you would find it.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cY/N,\nhold on,\u201d he said gently as he took a giant breath, the air running over your neck\nas it rushed into his mouth. \u00a0The kiss he\nplaced on your neck was probably meant to calm you down, to be some promise of\nmore to come, but it only made you cling to him tighter as he tried to pull\naway. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he\nmumbled, running his fingers through your hair and placing his hands over yours. \u00a0\u201cI-we-have to pack up my stuff, then we can\ngo. \u00a0Okay?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cPlease?\u201d\nyou said to him, or to his scent, or to the universe, desperate for him to not\nlet go.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOkay,\nokay,\u201d he said, his hand on your back as his head moved back and forth as he\nthought. \u00a0You hadn\u2019t let go of him, and\nyou really didn\u2019t plan to, even as he managed to pull out his phone and call\nsomeone, the low drone of someone on the other end unrecognizable to you and\nunappealing. \u00a0You barely registered what\nYoongi was saying, though you did notice the way he stuttered and sucked in a\nbreath when you finally, finally started to mouth at his neck.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nHe\ndidn\u2019t taste like anything, not really, which you knew was a mistake, which you\nknew was wrong. \u00a0Except it wasn\u2019t, really. \u00a0You were the mistake. \u00a0You were wrong. \u00a0You knew he smelled like something\u2014what does\nChristmas smell like?\u2014and you knew he must therefore taste like something\u2014Christmas?\nLike those candy canes? Fruit cake? What did people eat at Christmas?\u2014but it was\nnothing, there was nothing, just smooth, warm skin that you were determined to\nfind something in.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cY/N,\u201d\nYoongi\u2019s voice brought you a back a little, though you still didn\u2019t leave his\nneck alone until he pulled on your ear lightly but enough for you to blink and\nlet go of him until his hands cupped your face and brought it front of his\nown. \u00a0\u201cYou with me?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nwant to smell you,\u201d you said, barely aware of the tears covering your\nface. \u00a0\u201cI-I want to do all that.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\nknow, babe, me too. \u00a0Let\u2019s go home and we\ncan do whatever want, okay?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d\nyou said shakily, because it wasn\u2019t quite okay. \nYou were sure you could do everything and anything you wanted with and\nto him, but you couldn\u2019t smell him, and you weren\u2019t sure if anything else was\ngoing to be enough. \u00a0\u201cOkay,\u201d you nodded\nagain, though, because you had to let go of him so you could walk, and you panicked\nfor a moment that he was going to take you back into the main room where\neveryone would see how much of a mess you had suddenly become, though in\nreality it had been building up for hours or days or years, but he dragged you\nright past the hall, the music temporarily becoming louder as you passed the\nopen doors.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cStay\nhere for just a second?\u201d he said gently, placing you against a wall and waiting\nfor you to nod before he let go. \u00a0You did\nnot count the seconds he was gone, but he was back in a flash with nothing but\nyours and his coat. \u00a0He helped you into\nyours before putting his own on before sticking his hand out to you that you\ntook gratefully. \u00a0You end up clinging to\nhis entire arm, but he didn\u2019t seem to mind.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYour\nequipment?\u201d you said as he walked you outside, but he simply shrugged.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cCalled\nSeihoon, one of my sound techs. \u00a0He\u2019ll\ncome pack it all up.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cAre\nyou sure?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m\nthe boss. \u00a0Of course I\u2019m sure. \u00a0I ignored you for long enough.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\ndidn\u2019t. \u00a0You weren\u2019t, really. \u00a0I think, no, I know, if I really needed you,\nyou would have been by me in a heartbeat. \nYou were watching out for me. \u00a0I\nwas just wallowing a bit. \u00a0I didn\u2019t feel\nignored, just a little needy.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\nokay to be needy. \u00a0I\u2019ll give you whatever\nyou need,\u201d Yoongi said assuredly, raising the hand he was holding to his mouth\nto kiss along your knuckles. \u00a0You merely\nnodded, because you believed him. \u00a0You\njust knew, based on what he was saying and based on his past actions, that he\nwas telling the truth. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nBut\nyou also knew that he could never give you what you felt like you really\nneeded. \u00a0Still, you climbed in the car\nafter him and sat as close to him as possible, because if you couldn\u2019t smell\nhim, you would take whatever else you could get, and the quiet that fell as you\ndrove home, the urge and desperation fading into something more like\ncontentment and peace, was almost enough because you shared it with him.</p><p><br></p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Seokjin knew he was difficult. \u00a0Not necessarily difficult to please. \u00a0Just. \nDifficult. \u00a0He was a child in an\nadult\u2019s body, Yoongi once said, and he had meant it as an insult. \u00a0Seokjin was easily upset and riled up. \u00a0He was defiant sometimes to the point of\nbeing bratty. \u00a0He was picky and liked\nthings to be done a certain way. \u00a0He had\ngained a lot of real confidence, not just faking it when he felt insecure, over\nthe years and was willing to fight anyone who tried to argue with him.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But he was also extremely polite and\nrespectful. \u00a0All of his staff had always\nsaid so. \u00a0He had worked with countless of\nother actors and singers and models by this point in his career, and they always\nall agreed he had a humility like no other. \nHe was selfless and thought of others, always wanting to make sure they\nwere fed and taken care of. \u00a0He listened\nto the concern of all his employees, even down to the janitors, so he knew he\nwasn\u2019t all bad.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0So he was humble enough to know that\nY/N may have been right about needing to apologize to Yoongi, but stubborn enough\nto know that Yoongi wasn\u2019t completely innocent; it took two people to be in a\nrelationship, two people to create conflict, two people to not resolve things,\ntwo people to want to try again.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But it was bothering him. \u00a0It bothered him, for some unknown reason he\ncouldn\u2019t wrap his head around, to see Yoongi so happy. \u00a0He had no reason to be jealous; nothing about\nNamjoon ever left him unsatisfied. \nSeokjin may be hard to please, but Namjoon did nothing but please\nhim. \u00a0He felt a little faulty, though,\nlike a soulmate gone wrong, when he felt a twinge of remorse. \u00a0Some odd feeling of knowing he and Yoongi had\nbeen happy together for a while slipping away. \nHe wondered if they had ever been happy, or if it had merely been a\npre-courser, some fake form of happiness that wouldn\u2019t quite do in the long\nrun, that they both knew wouldn\u2019t last but was only getting them ready for the\nreal deal. \u00a0And when Seokjin had found\nthe real deal in Namjoon, Yoongi had had to wait for years until Y/N came\nalong, and Seokjin had to watch him suffer and hurt and push people away for\nall that time. \u00a0So he wasn\u2019t jealous, and\nhe knows he doesn\u2019t regret what happened, because it brought him to Namjoon,\nbut he was sad. \u00a0Sad that it took so long\nfor Yoongi to finally be as happy as Seokjin has been for years now. \u00a0He knows Yoongi\u2019s been happy, as his music\nmakes him extremely so like nothing else can, but it all seems pale in\ncomparison to how he looks now. \u00a0He never\ngot to see Yoongi look like that, and he knows it\u2019s no fault of his own. \u00a0He\u2019s not jealous. \u00a0He wasn\u2019t. \nBut he felt unsettled, still, and not just because Namjoon was\nsnoring. \u00a0He was used to that. \u00a0It happened every night, after all, and\ncouldn\u2019t be helped by this point. \nSomeone else might find it annoying, but it was endearing to Seokjin. \u00a0It was his white noise, a rhythm to rock him\nto sleep, his assurance that Namjoon was there and proof that he was sleeping\nsoundly beside him. \u00a0He would have felt\nbad for waking him up as he rolled over, but he knew Namjoon wouldn\u2019t care. \u00a0Knew he would wake up in a heartbeat if he\nfelt like Seokjin needed him.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cJoon. \u00a0Joon? \nJoonie!\u201d \u00a0So maybe it took him a\nminute to wake up, and another minute to realize who was waking him up, but he\nstill did, and even though Namjoon couldn\u2019t hurt a crab, he looked ready to\nfight.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWh-what? \u00a0What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNothing, you big baby,\u201d Seokjin\nsaid, patting his chest so he would lie back down.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhy am I awake then?\u201d \u00a0Seokjin waited until Namjoon fell back into\nhim, his freakishly long arms and legs flopping onto him dramatically. \u00a0Seokjin let out a dramatic breath of air in return,\neven though he was the one who started it.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDo you think I\u2019m a dick?\u201d \u00a0The rustling and rearranging stilled as\nNamjoon blinked, his lashes tickling Seokjin\u2019s skin.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhy are you asking that?\u201d Namjoon\nsaid, because of course he would. \u00a0There\nwere no simply yes or no answers with Namjoon, and even though Seokjin sighed,\nhe appreciated it. \u00a0Namjoon made him\nthink about everything that he did, and he wanted to explain himself to him. \u00a0Hardly ever to anyone else, but Namjoon was\ndifferent. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t even a soulmate\nthing; Namjoon just loved figuring people out.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSomething Y/N said. \u00a0About me hurting Yoongi.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s broad and vague all at the\nsame time. \u00a0Is there something specific\nshe said you did?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cShe said I told Yoongi that he was\nlucky to date me and that I told him when we broke up that no one would ever\nlove him.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDid you say all that?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI,\u201d Seokjin mumbled, buying some\ntime by running his hands up and down Namjoon\u2019s arm and back, whatever parts of\nhim he could reach. \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t\nremember. \u00a0Does it sound like something I\nwould say?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHonestly?\u201d Namjoon chuckled, the\npuffs of air tickling Seokjin. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sure\nyou\u2019ve said worse to him. \u00a0But most of\nthe time you\u2019re just messing with him. \nYour weird YoonJin language.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYoonJin? \u00a0I haven\u2019t heard that in a long time,\u201d Seokjin\nlaughed, as much as he could with Namjoon on his ribcage.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYour crazy fans and their crazy\nship names.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t remind me,\u201d Seokjin hummed.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBut he\u2019s always been able to tell\nmore than you when someone\u2019s not teasing.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHey, he said mean things, too.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah, but you always knew when he\nwas purposefully being mean. \u00a0He\u2019s much\nmore blunt than you are, and you know it. \nYou\u2019re super passive aggressive when you want to be.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2014I am,\u201d Seokjin sighed. \u00a0There was no use denying it. \u00a0\u201cSo,\u201d he said after a moment, twirling\nNamjoon\u2019s hair between his fingers. \u00a0He\nshould dye his hair before they left. \n\u201cWas I a dick?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes, Seokjin. \u00a0A lot. \nYou two were terrible for and with and to each other. \u00a0You know this. \u00a0He knows this. \u00a0We\u2019ve been over this. \u00a0Why the renewed interest?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cJust what Y/N said, about how I\nshould apologize to him.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cJin,\u201d Namjoon said seriously,\nrising up to stare down at Seokjin. \u00a0Some\nof Namjoon\u2019s stares Seokjin loved. \u00a0He\nloved when Namjoon would get all soft-eyed when he looked at him. \u00a0He would stare like no one would notice. \u00a0He blinked slowly as if he didn\u2019t want to\nmiss anything Seokjin did. \u00a0He would get\nserious and stare when he wanted to pay attention and let Seokjin know he\nmattered. \u00a0He would sometimes, though,\ngive Seokjin a look that Seokjin knew all too well. \u00a0It was the\nyou-know-you\u2019re-wrong-but-I-think-you\u2019re-capable-of-admitting-it-yourself-before-I-tell-you\nlook. \u00a0Seokjin wasn\u2019t a fan of this one. \u00a0It made him squirm and groan and grow\nembarrassed and a little bit angry even if Namjoon was right.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou never apologized?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t remember saying any of\nthat! \u00a0It was years ago!\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cJin. \u00a0Jin,\u201d Namjoon said softer. \u00a0Seokjin risked looking at him, and thankfully\nthe look was gone, replaced by something a little sadder. \u00a0\u201cYou know how Yoongi never forgets, like,\nanything.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cUnfortunately, I do.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSo, if you remembered, would you\napologize? \u00a0If you could, would you say\nit again?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThen apologize.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cEven if\u2014\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cEven if,\u201d Namjoon said, putting his\nhead back on his own pillow and pulling Seokjin into his chest. \u00a0He let himself be moved until no one\u2019s arm\nwas being slept on and felt himself grow sleepy again as they both settled\ndown. \u00a0Still, he waited until Namjoon\u2019s\nlittle snores rumbled through his chest again before he closed his own eyes,\nalready running the conversation with Yoongi over and over in his head. \u00a0There was no way to come out on top of it,\nbut Seokjin never really cared about beating Yoongi or being better than\nhim. \u00a0He already knew, in many ways, that\nhe was. \u00a0In other ways, Yoongi would\nalways be superior. \u00a0Seokjin could admit\nthat. \u00a0He could admit that he was wrong,\ntoo. \u00a0And if that helped Yoongi to be\nhappy, truly happy, happy like he never was with Seokjin, then Seokjin was more\nthan willing to help that happen.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Hoseok sometimes felt bad for his\nneighbors. \u00a0He wasn\u2019t exactly what one\nmight call a quiet person, but he figured that his positive energy and friendliness\nbalanced out. \u00a0Everyone knew him even if\nhe couldn\u2019t remember their names, and on more than one occasion someone had\nknocked on his door asking for help to move something or find a cat or \u201cborrow\u201d\nsugar or something, and he was always more than happy to oblige. \u00a0So he didn\u2019t feel an ounce of remorse as he\nand Tae tramped up the stairs as loud as a horde of elephants. \u00a0He wasn\u2019t ashamed at how they were laughing\nas loud as hyenas, either, as they stumbled into the walls while he fumbled to\nopen his door as Tae leaned on him and tried to catch his breath.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0To the untrained eye, the pair would\nsurely look drunk. \u00a0And Hoseok felt a little\nlightheaded, but, not to be cheesy or anything, he was just high on\nhappiness. \u00a0Not high. \u00a0That word made him think of actually getting\nhigh, which he had only done once, or, tried to do, but had promptly fallen\nasleep after taking one hit. \u00a0So, not high,\nas he didn\u2019t know what that felt like, but light, floaty, almost, like he could\njust fly away by how carefree he felt. \nWhich is saying something, because Hoseok is almost always\ncarefree. \u00a0But tonight, tonight, he\u2019s\njust, he\u2019s just. \u00a0He doesn\u2019t know. \u00a0He\u2019s happy. \nThat\u2019s all.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Happy, to see his best friend so\nhappy, happy, to see how two lives can merge together, happy, to know everything\nwas only going to get better from here, happy, to have Tae coming home with\nhim.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He was happy at how Tae had changed\nsince they actually started talking about their relationship more\u2014I know, what\na concept, doi. \u00a0He was happy by how much\ncloser they obviously were because of it\u2014wow, who would have thought talking\ncould do that? \u00a0He was happy with finding\nlittle bits of Tae all around his apartment, even if he usually liked keeping\nthings extremely clean. \u00a0He was happy with\nthe way Tae was catching onto his mood and he was getting better at reading\nTae\u2019s. \u00a0He was happy that they could\ntouch, and did touch, almost all the time wherever they went. \u00a0He was happy to know Tae didn\u2019t shy away from\nsuch displays and actually wanted them himself. \nHe was happy, even if he would never by the man\u2019s soulmate, to be with\nhim.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And, if he was forced to admit it,\nhe was happy with the sex, okay? \u00a0It was\nintense in all the right ways. \u00a0Tae was\nintense. \u00a0He sometimes got this look on\nhis face that almost scared Hoseok, and he had jumped and screamed a little in\nsurprise\u2014he\u2019s man enough to admit\u2014on more than one occasion when Tae randomly\nbit him or spanked him without any precursor. \nAnd he had gone still, too, which is pretty impressive considering how\nmuch he is always moving, more than once when Tae suddenly touched him like he\nwas made of glass or whispered so softly in his ear how much he loved him. \u00a0He loved those moments, all of those moments,\nbecause, if nothing else, Tae kept Hoseok on his toes, and even if he thought\nhe had seen and heard everything from the man, he continued to be surprised and\nimpressed.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The first time Tae had said \u201cI love\nhim,\u201d though, Hoseok hadn\u2019t necessarily reacted as one might hope or\nexpect. \u00a0He\u2019d, well, uh, accidentally\nflailed a bit and elbowed Tae so hard in the ribs he had a bruise the next day. \u00a0There had been a lot of squawking, if Hoseok\nremembers correctly, and profuse apologizing even though Tae laughed it off\nlike he did most things. \u00a0In hindsight,\nHoseok has been able to laugh about it, too, and is fine with Tae teasing him\nover and over again by warning him beforehand he\u2019s going to say it or covering\nhis chest awkwardly and obviously before he says it. \u00a0It never seems to take anything away from the\nmoment, though. \u00a0Love, in Hoseok\u2019s mind,\nis often too serious. \u00a0Or people try to\nmake it so. \u00a0The movies have an epic\nswell in the music when someone finally confesses. \u00a0It\u2019s pouring down torrential rain as if it\u2019s\nsuddenly a life or death situation. \u00a0The\nwords are said and suddenly everyone is crying and gnashing their teeth and\npulling out their hair because finally, finally someone loves meeeeee!</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Love should be carefree. \u00a0Light. \nHappy. \u00a0Hilarious. \u00a0And full of awkward human moments. \u00a0So Hoseok loved how much Tae and he laughed even\nwhen trying to lose themselves in the throes of passion. \u00a0He loved how gross morning breath was when\nthey kissed. \u00a0He loved how Tae would\nsputter when Hoseok introduced him as his boyfriend to random strangers who\ndefinitely did not ask. \u00a0He loved how\nthey still fumbled to undress each other and laughed when one of them tried to\nbe \u201ctoo sexy\u201d and couldn\u2019t stay in character for whatever nonsense they had\nplanned. \u00a0He loved that they were\nfiguring each other out, what they liked and disliked, what they needed and\nwanted, what they preferred and could endure. \nHe loved each opportunity to get to know Tae more and to grow closer to\nhim, and he knew Tae felt the same.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0So, stumbling into his apartment and\nkicking off their shoes\u2014that he would fix later into neat little rows when he\ngot up to pee or get a glass of water or something because he\u2019s not OCD but\nshit, there\u2019s no need to be so flippant when it comes to a little order in\none\u2019s house\u2014really felt like coming home. \nPulling on each other\u2019s belt loops and smashing a little too hard into\nthe kitchen counter on the way to the bedroom so Tae could suck on Hoseok\u2019s\nneck\u2014an action that sounds ridiculous and even humorous, as Hoseok first\nthought, too, as he laughed when he tilted his head back, but, as always, he\nstarted to get warm and wanted to pull Tae closer the second his lips were on\nhim\u2014was commonplace, so much so that Hoseok never left anything glass on any\ncountertops or tables anymore for fear of breaking something in the middle of making\nout. \u00a0Trying to race each other to the\nbedroom and see who could undress the other first\u2014Hoseok always, always won,\nand he\u2019d like to think he\u2019s just that good with his hands, but Tae seemed to\nlet him win every time because Hoseok had figured out that secretly Tae like\nhaving someone else peel his shirt off and pull his pants down and leave him\nthere to shiver for a few seconds\u2014seemed like second nature at this point.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And, on most nights, pulling each\nother into bed and roaming all over each other and never letting the other go\nwould be expected. \u00a0It was hard to resist\neach other when they were in full display for the other, standing or sitting or\nlying there in waiting, inches and inches of tan skin waiting to be touched and\nkissed, to be worshiped and loved. \u00a0It\nwas what Hoseok expected, even, because something about going to a wedding\nalways made him remember how much he loved love, and he loved Tae. \u00a0He told him as often as he could. \u00a0Loved how Tae seemed to have no trouble\nsaying it to him but still blushed a little when Hoseok reciprocated. \u00a0So to take him to bed and, as someone more\ncrass might say, have his way with him, seemed like the most viable option,\nlike the right choice.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nBut\nhe slowed down once Tae was naked before him. \nThey were always too busy to be bothered with any lights, but even in\nthe darkness, Hoseok could see him. \u00a0He\nknew how strong he was beneath his soft layer of skin. \u00a0He knew how kind he was even when he had a\nmischievous glint in his eye. \u00a0He knew\nhow hard he worked to help others and yet how much he loved, at the end of the\nday, when he was tired or overwhelmed, being taken care of.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And Hoseok didn\u2019t know, could never\nknow, what it must be like to see your soulmate get married to someone\nelse. \u00a0If Tae and Jimin were anyone else,\nhe figured it would have broken Tae. \u00a0So\neven though he knew the two soulmates loved each other, and he knew Tae supported\nJimin and always would, he imagined Tae might be a little hurt even with how\nmuch he smiled and danced and laughed at the wedding. \u00a0He knew he might be feeling a little lost and\nleft out and inadequate and lonely and incomplete and hopeless and scared and\nworried about his own future. \u00a0He might,\njust might, if Hoseok is feeling extra brave to consider, have been looking to\nHoseok so much the whole day for reassurance. \nHe might have been watching him to try to catch a glimpse of something,\nsome spark of hope that one day it might be them getting married. \u00a0And Hoseok would be damned if he wasn\u2019t going\nto do everything he could to make sure Tae had nothing to worry about, to make\nsure he knew he was loved and valued and appreciated and enough, more than\nenough.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m going to take care of you,\u201d\nHoseok said firmly even though it came out as a whisper. \u00a0It must have surprised Tae, whether because\nhe always seemed a little surprised when Hoseok said such words or because the\nchange in speed and volume of everything gave him a little whiplash, because he\ngrew still and quiet, so Hoseok waited as he took his hand until Tae nodded\nbefore leading him to the bathroom. \u00a0He\nsmiled at him as Tae stood with his hands in front of him, waiting while Hoseok\nfilled up the bathtub until he got cold or couldn\u2019t wait any longer and wrapped\nhimself around Hoseok, leaning against his back while the sound of water\nrushing calmed him down. \u00a0He went\nwillingly once Hoseok helped him step in and watched with not an eager or\nexcited eye but a look of admiration and appreciation as Hoseok finished\nundressing to get in behind him. \u00a0He\nmelted a little into Hoseok\u2019s chest and a little more as Hoseok ran his hands\nall over him, but Hoseok didn\u2019t feel any less light or carefree or, for lack of\na better word, high. \u00a0If anything, he\nfelt more-so. \u00a0The more Tae relaxed into\nhim, he more at ease he felt. \u00a0They fit\ntogether perfectly even if they weren\u2019t \u201cdestined\u201d to be. \u00a0And since there was no hurry, because Hoseok\nwas going to be there when Tae woke up in the morning, he was going to be there\neven when Tae lost his cool a little and got impatient and snapped at him over something\nminor, he was going to be there even when Tae needed his soulmate more than he\nneeded a boyfriend, Hoseok took his time on Tae.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He washed him carefully, making sure\nto get off all of the smells that didn\u2019t belong to him. \u00a0That weird Aunt Sally and friend-of-a-friend\nwho had danced a little too closely and someone\u2019s cigarette smell and something\nelse Hoseok couldn\u2019t pinpoint that definitely wasn\u2019t Tae or him\u2014or Jimin or\nJungkook or Y/N or Yoongi, the only other smells he would allow. \u00a0Tonight, he wanted Tae to smell like Tae, and\na little like him, because he\u2019s a human with a tiny trace of possessiveness in\nhim as we all have. \u00a0Hoseok wants him to\nknow that he\u2019s his. \u00a0So he washed him\ncarefully and completely, and he patted him dry and wrapped him up in his\nsoftest robe that Tae had once made fun of but now tried to steal every time he\nwas over. \u00a0And he held him before they\ncould even brush their teeth, even before he could get either of them dressed\napart from the furry robe, and just let them breathe together, closing their\neyes before sleep came. \u00a0Eventually, he\nhelped Tae get dressed in Hoseok\u2019s flannel pants and into bed where he slid in\nnext to him and pulled him close and just stared at him until Tae\u2019s eyelids\nstarted to flutter. \u00a0He kissed him,\nthen. \u00a0On his hair and forehead and cheek\nand chin and nose and eyelashes and temple and knuckles and neck and chest and\nribcage and stomach and collarbone and everywhere he could reach, saving his\nlips for last. \u00a0He took his time. \u00a0There was no hurry. \u00a0No rush. \n</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He would kiss Tae until he fell\nasleep, and Hoseok would keep kissing him until he fell asleep himself.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ducking out of one\u2019s own wedding may\nbe a little frowned on, but Jimin had moved past what other people thought\nyears ago. \u00a0Besides, they had only\ninvited people who wouldn\u2019t be so judgmental and petty, and everyone was still\nhaving plenty of fun when he pulled Jungkook away. \u00a0It hadn\u2019t taken long to read Jungkook\u2019s\nuncomfortable cues, anyway, and he had learned early on that Jungkook was an\nintrovert unlike himself and Tae and Hoseok. \nHonestly, he was surprised the boy could keep up with the three of them\nso well, but he supposes it was just a testament to how much he liked them\nall. \u00a0Still, Jimin could tell when his\nsmiles shifted from genuine happiness to politeness, and that was when he knew it\nwas time to go. \u00a0He had kept the boy as\nclose as possible all night if only to give them some semblance of their own\npersonal bubble when really everyone wanted to be in their space. \u00a0It was to expected; you invite people to a\nwedding to share the experience with them, but Jimin could tell Jungkook was\ngetting exhausted, and even though the boy protested, actually daring to\ncomplain about proper decorum or some ridiculous shit no eighteen-year-old would\nnormally say, Jimin dragged him out, anyway.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He was flushed from dancing or from\nhappiness or from embarrassment, Jimin wasn\u2019t quite sure, but either way the\nboy looked good, and he was his now. \u00a0The\nidea made him pause and consider the boy sitting so close to him in the car on\ntheir way home. \u00a0Jungkook had the ability\nto be giggly and breathtaking one moment and teasing and sultry the next, and\nif Jimin wasn\u2019t so confidence in himself, it might confuse and intimidate him,\nbut it only made him feel more endeared to the boy. \u00a0He hadn\u2019t ever felt like a very possessive\nperson; protective, yes, fiercely so, but having Tae as a soulmate had always\nmeant he shared everything he could with everyone he could. \u00a0It was simply their nature, and Tae brought out\na side in him that made him want to simply give and give to others as much as\nhe could. \u00a0So the idea of having someone\nto himself, even though he knew he didn\u2019t own Jungkook, it was nothing like that,\nwas new and, frankly, a little overwhelming. \nHe had fleeting thoughts of Tae throughout the ceremony and even now,\nthoughts he had to gently push aside. \u00a0He\nwas doing nothing wrong, and while he and Tae could share Jungkook in other\nways, now wasn\u2019t the time for that. \u00a0He\nwas to have Jungkook like Tae never could, like Hoseok never could, like no one\nelse ever had and no one else ever could.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cJungkook,\u201d he found himself saying,\nsuddenly overwhelmed with the thought. \u00a0He\nknew the boy was nervous even if he wanted it. \nAnd for weeks Jimin hadn\u2019t been nervous but had wanted to wait. \u00a0He couldn\u2019t let Jungkook know he was nervous\nnow for fear that the boy would misread his hesitation as repulsion or a lack\nof desire. \u00a0If anything, he simply wasn\u2019t\nsure how to handle how much he wanted the boy. \nHe wanted him to laugh and smile and squirm and moan and sigh and\nbeg. \u00a0He wanted all of him, whatever that\nlooked and felt and sounded and smelled like.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And the boy just looked at him,\nsweetly and expectantly with a touch of anxiety that Jimin wanted to kiss\naway. \u00a0So he did.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And Jimin was used to being\ngraceful. \u00a0Tae had always been a little\nclumsy, had fumbled and gotten overly excited and eager the few times they had\ndone anything that crossed the border of platonic friends, but Jimin had always\nbeen calm and collected, cool and in charge. \nIt was expected of him, as a dancer, in some way, to remember how to\nbreathe and know the placement of his hands, to remember the moves, of when to\npush and when to pull, of when to go fast and when to go slow, so while he stumbled\nup the stairs and stumbled into their apartment as Jungkook clung to him and\ntried to wrestle him out of his clothes, he regained his composure once they\nmade it to their room that was definitely theirs now, no longer just Jimin\u2019s. \u00a0Jungkook seemed to be seeping into Jimin\u2019s\nspace and Jimin\u2019s being already, and if the desperate noises coming from\nJungkook\u2019s mouth were any indication of how effected he was, too, then Jimin\nknew the boy just wanted to be close to Jimin as much as possible. \u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Still, he found it in himself to\nslow down, to hold the boy, to touch him all over.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cJungkook, Jungkook,\u201d he said somewhere\nbetween their shirts on and their skin bare. \n\u201cI\u2019m yours.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAnd I\u2019m yours,\u201d Jungkook almost\nwhined back, capturing Jimin\u2019s lips to shut him up, but Jimin wasn\u2019t done, so\nhe let the boy kiss him for a moment before pulling him back.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNow and always,\u201d he said seriously,\nstaring into the boy\u2019s eyes. \u00a0Jungkook\u2019s\neyes were wide but they softened a little as he stared back at Jimin, repeating\nthe words he might as well have tattooed on his brain by this point.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNo matter what the world says.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cUntil the world ends,\u201d Jimin\ncontinued.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOr my soul stops,\u201d Jungkook\nbreathed, taking a deep breath and resting his forehead against Jimin\u2019s.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou have me now and forever,\u201d Jimin\nsaid, trying to sooth him while touching him all over all at the same\ntime. \u00a0\u201cSo there\u2019s no hurry. \u00a0You love me? \u00a0You trust me?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI love you,\u201d Jungkook almost\nsobbed. \u00a0\u201cI trust you. \u00a0Now touch me.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cCalm down,\u201d Jimin almost laughed,\nbut he touched Jungkook, anyway. \u00a0He was\ntouching him, and he would keep touching him. \nHe could touch him anywhere now, so he would. \u00a0\u201cWe have all night. \u00a0We have all our lives.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s real nice,\u201d Jungkook sighed\nagain before grabbing Jimin again. \u00a0\u201cBut\nI want you right now.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOkay,\u201d Jimin laughed, pushing the\nboy back onto their bed and climbing over him even as he peeled off his pants\nand followed with his own. \u00a0\u201cYou have\nme. \u00a0Now and always, okay?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOkay,\u201d Jungkook whispered, staring\nup at Jimin. \u00a0He had a bit of nervousness\nleft in him, something easily read as a desire to please and do well. \u00a0Jimin had no doubts he would. \u00a0The kid was annoying good at everything he\nset his mind to, and while Jimin might have the upper hand tonight for the boy\u2019s\nfirst time, he had no doubt that Jungkook would be a fast learner and would be\ngiving Jimin a run for his money in no time. \nFor now, Jimin was going to savor how eager and willing he was. \u00a0He was going to take his time, spend as much\ntime as Jungkook could stand, was going to test his patience and stamina. \u00a0And it would take time, to learn what\nJungkook liked and didn\u2019t like, but Jimin could be patient, clearly more patient\nthan Jungkook could be. \u00a0He would learn\nwhat made the boy preen and blush, and he would enjoy every second of it.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cJungkook,\u201d he said, trying to keep\nhis voice steady when he just wanted to laugh and blow raspberries all over his\nhardened stomach, \u201chusband.\u201d \u00a0Jungkook\u2019s\nbreath hitched a little at that, which made Jimin smile wider. \u00a0\u201cMine,\u201d he whispered, watching Jungkook nod\nand reach for him. \u00a0\u201cLove,\u201d he tried,\nsmiling even more when Jungkook closed his eyes for a second before opening\nthem, his pupils wide and glistening.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSoulmate,\u201d Jungkook said firmly and\ndecisively, pulling Jimin down until he was almost being squished. \u00a0He mouthed at Jimin\u2019s earrings and the side\nof his neck, anything he could reach until Jimin pushed himself off and\nproperly kissed him. \u00a0\u201cPlease,\u201d the boy\nmanaged when Jimin left his lips again to make his way down his body. \u00a0Jimin knew Jungkook could be a brat, so his\npoliteness was sure to fade if Jimin tested him much longer. \u00a0He decided to go easy on him for now. \u00a0He would probably go easy on him the rest of\ntheir lives, if he was honest. \u00a0He\u2019d give\nand give and give anything and everything that Jungkook needed or wanted. \u00a0For now, that was himself, as much and as quickly\nas possible. \u00a0So, with one final kiss to\nJungkook\u2019s navel that made the boy twitch a little under him and made Jimin\nsmirk a little above him, he gave the boy what he wanted, but moreover, he gave\nhim what he needed.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Relationships, like life, have many\nstages. \u00a0The infancy, with fleeting\nglances and blushing cheeks and stammered confessions and thumping hearts and\nsweaty palms. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThe\nchildhood, of whispered secrets and loud laughter and shared interests. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nAdolescence,\nthe wild abandonment and wild dreams and stolen kisses and promises made. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nAdulthood,\nwhen things became serious and mature, the settling down, the label and symbols\nof love, the inability to keep your hands off of each other, the desire to show\nthem off and declare your love to everyone you met, the swelling of hearts like\nnothing else, the belief that nothing could go wrong, that everything was\nperfect. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nAnd\nmiddle age, when things either grew boring or you settled into a pleasant rhythm. \u00a0When the mundane and monotony of living together\nand knowing what the other was thinking or doing without even needing to communicate\nbrought despair or contentment. \u00a0When\nsimply being with the other was enough or wasn\u2019t. \u00a0The time when a crisis happened or the last\npush toward peace and security for the rest of your life settled in. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nAnd,\nunfortunately for some, death, the end of everything you once held dear and\nthought would never end. \u00a0The uncomfortable\nsilences and broken hearts and prolonged absences that turned bitter until they\nburnt. \u00a0You had never experienced such a\nstage in any relationship and hoped you never would. \u00a0You knew Yoongi had, though, and you wondered,\nthough the idea was quickly squashed, if he was thinking about if things would\never end that way for him again. \u00a0They\nwouldn\u2019t, because you weren\u2019t Jin or anyone else. \u00a0You weren\u2019t just somebody for him. \u00a0You weren\u2019t sure what stage your relationship\nwas in with Yoongi, but whatever it was made you feel alive and terrified all\nat the same time. \u00a0He seemed to continue\nto have that effect on you. \u00a0You wanted\nmore and yet were afraid of taking too much, of taking something that wasn\u2019t\nyours. \u00a0Even if you knew deep down that\nhe was yours, even if you had spoken those very words out loud before,\nsomething still held you back. \u00a0You\nwondered, after listening to Jimin and Jungkook make promises to each other to\ncomplete each other and be there for each other, if you could fully give\nyourself to Yoongi while feeling like he would never fully be yours.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nPerhaps\nthere was no reason to ask that question, because you already knew the answer,\nbut you were determined to try. \u00a0You were\ninsistent on trying to prove to him, to show him, to make him believe you and\ntrust you. \u00a0Your actions and words hadn\u2019t\nbeen as clear as his had been, and you didn\u2019t want him to have any doubts that\nyou wanted to stick around, that you wanted to be with him and by him and as\nclose to him as possible.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nIf\nthat was pathetic, then Yoongi was right, and you were pathetic for him, but he\nmerely had to look at you for know that he was gone for you, too. \u00a0So you tried to push aside all of your\ninsecurities and invasive thoughts that weren\u2019t of Yoongi and Yoongi only as\nyou got back home.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nIt\nwas home. \u00a0Some part of you knew this and\nbelieved this. \u00a0Felt it to be true as you\ntoed off your shoes to pick up and carry to the closet as Yoongi went to get a\ncouple of glasses of water. \u00a0You knew his\nplace was home by the flowers that always seemed new in the vases spread around\nthe house. \u00a0They were, if nothing else,\nthe answer for your earlier question. \nBecause flowers, like relationships, also go through the stages of\nlife. \u00a0And the jasmine scattered throughout\nYoongi\u2019s house were always thriving. \u00a0You\nnever saw one of them wilt or die. \u00a0You\nknew they had to; there was nothing magical about them. \u00a0But Yoongi never let them got to that point,\nor at least never let you see them. \u00a0And\nit was almost silly, really, you, who worked in a flower shop and knew every\nname of every flower and every meaning behind them, to step into Yoongi\u2019s room\nthat was now also yours and to stop and simply stare at the flowers by his bed,\nfinally realizing where the two of you stood.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nIt\nshould have been easy, then, to turn around and just tell him or show him when\nhe came into the room and looked at you just standing there, but you felt like\nyou could barely breathe much less speak or make sense of whatever you were\nfeeling. \u00a0Perhaps you were getting easy\nto read, or Yoongi was always that intuitive or aware of what you needed before\nyou had even acknowledged him, because he put the glasses down and reached\ntentatively for your hand, tugging you toward the bathroom with no sense of urgency.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cBrush,\nwash,\u201d he said, handing you your toothbrush as he proceeded to do the same, his\neyes barely leaving you in the mirror as he did. \u00a0You watched as he brushed his teeth, rinsed,\nand spit before you even moved to do the same, blinking away your stupor that\nhe might be registering as sleepiness. \nYou felt anything but sleepy, though. \nYou felt wired and jittery, twitchy, even, and your fingers were shaking\na bit as you tried to brush. \u00a0By the time\nyou finally were done, you stood up to Yoongi holding a face wipe in front of\nyou, and you closed your eyes for him to step close and do it for you. \u00a0You couldn\u2019t help grabbing onto his wrist,\nthe contact alone making you sigh and calm down a little as he pressed gently\nbut firmly around your eyes and cheeks to remove your makeup, more than you\nwere certainly used to wearing. \u00a0When his\nhand left you, you opened your eyes to see his face much closer than it was\nbefore, and you scooted a little closer, wanting to simply melt into him, but\nhis hand came back to your cheek to steady you, and you kept your eyes open to\nlook up at him even though it was difficult. \nYour eyelashes kept flickering, and your eyes seemed to be blurry and\nunable to focus, but all you wanted to do was look at Yoongi looking at\nyou. \u00a0You needed to watch him watching\nyou. \u00a0You had to see the way he looked at\nyou, because no one else looked at you like that. \u00a0No one else ever had, and no one else ever\nwould, surely.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoongi,\u201d\nyou managed to say as his thumb and fingers glided across your face and\nneck. \u00a0He just continued, his eyes never\nleaving yours until you practically nuzzled his hand, breaking eye contact with\nhim only to kiss his palm once before looking back up at him. \u00a0\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cCan\nI?\u201d he said, even though he didn\u2019t need to. \nStill, the question made you move, pulling on his belt loops as you\nnodded. \u00a0No one had ever asked before,\nand even though he could probably read your mind at this point and must surely know\nwhat you wanted and needed more than anyone else ever could or ever would, he\nhad still asked. \u00a0You could laugh at him\nlater, because kissing for the first time in a bathroom didn\u2019t sound much\nbetter than kissing in an elevator, but Yoongi had been right. \u00a0There was really nothing to compare. \u00a0You weren\u2019t sure if you had expected to\nliterally melt or explode, so you were glad neither of those happened. \u00a0You were glad you didn\u2019t start shaking more\nto the point of throwing up or itching to the point where you would bleed if\nyou scratched too hard. \u00a0You were glad\nyou only melted a little as your lips merged together. \u00a0You were glad you only shook a little when\nyou felt his fingers twitching against you before they pressed into your\nskin. \u00a0You were glad, and glad couldn\u2019t\neven begin to describe it\u2014relieved? Grateful? Satisfied?\u2014when Yoongi finally\nkissed you.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nLike\neverything else he did, he moved slowly but surely. \u00a0Once he knew he had permission, he didn\u2019t hesitate. \u00a0He controlled your every movement without\nbeing forceful. \u00a0And he left you wanting\nmore, so it felt extremely rude and unfair when he pulled away from you, laughing\nas you tried to chase him. \u00a0He ducked\ndown to your neck, though, which didn\u2019t surprise you. \u00a0He had staked his claim to that territory\nweeks ago, so it was naturally his favorite spot. \u00a0Wanting to give to him as much as possible,\nthen, you let him until your fingers started to twitch again, itching for a\nchance to do the same to him. \u00a0He seemed\nto notice your plight and chuckled again before taking both of your hands in\nhis and leading you back into the bedroom, flicking off the light as you went. </p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThe\ndarkness that engulfed you was a little too much, and one of Yoongi\u2019s hand left\nyours to turn on the lamp that illuminated first and foremost the flowers\nunderneath them before even revealing his face.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cYoongi,\u201d\nyou said again, looking between the flowers and him. \u00a0He hummed as he let go of your hands, and\nwithout even asking permission you finally started to unbutton his shirt. \u00a0With something to do, your fingers seemed to\nhave stopped their fidgeting, and his plain but offensive shirt was soon\nundone, and he let you push it down his arms until it fluttered to the ground. \u00a0His undershirt had to go, too, and he lifted\nhis arms easily as you tugged it up and over his head. \u00a0You had only seen him shirtless a few times\naccidentally. \u00a0He had always been\nextremely modest around the house, always making sure to at least have a shirt\nand shorts on around you, even though you had always figured he would prefer to\nbe wearing less clothes, especially to bed. \nYou had never really ogled at guys before. \u00a0You hadn\u2019t had girl friends growing up to\ngossip about boys with or giggle and point out who you thought was hot. \u00a0You knew Yoongi was fit and attractive, but\nhis looks had never been what made you desire him. \u00a0It was how he acted and treated you, and,\nhonestly, how he sounded when talking to you, that made you attracted to\nhim. \u00a0So his smooth, lean torso was\nmomentarily distracting, but it was the expanse of skin that mattered no matter\nwhat it looked like, and you splayed a hand over his chest almost\nexperimentally. \u00a0Yoongi was not ticklish,\nyou had discovered a while ago, though he did have sharp reflexes and would\nretaliate if poked in his side surprisingly. \nSo when he barely even flinched when your fingers touched him, you weren\u2019t\nsurprised. \u00a0Pleased, even, that he was\nletting you touch him. \u00a0You figured he would\nlet you do anything to him, but still, you were used to having things done to\nyou, not the other way around. \u00a0Exploring\nyour partner simply for the sake of exploring was a pretty foreign concept to you,\nand you could tell you were always losing your footing. \u00a0So you did what you thought you were good at\nand went for his pants\u2019 button and then zipper, and he let you, only stopping\nyou when you tried to pull them down his hips.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d\nhe said softly, his voice making you stop and stand up completely. \u00a0His pants fell on their own accord, and he stepped\nout of them before running his hand up and down your forearm. \u00a0\u201cI told you I\u2019d be good to you, right?\u201d \u00a0Nodding slowly, you felt yourself shiver,\nbecause you couldn\u2019t quite comprehend what he could mean. \u00a0</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u201cLet\nme just,\u201d he sighed, pulling you toward him and kissing you again. \u00a0If that\u2019s what he meant by being good to you,\nthen he could keep doing that and you would be perfectly content and happy. \u00a0His kisses seemed to be a distraction\ntechnique, though, and a clever one at that, because you barely noticed his\nhands unzipping your dress and pulling the material off of your shoulders and\ndown your arms until the cool air hit you, causing you to shiver again. \u00a0You could tease him later about not even\ntaking advantage of the dress\u2019 slip, but at the moment you had to hold onto his\nshoulders, his bare shoulders, which was a new sensation, as he moved toward\nyour neck again. \u00a0The familiar movement\nof his nose over your delicate skin was soothing, though, and helped counter balance\nthe new sensation of his hands running all over your bare back. \u00a0Yoongi\u2019s hands were soft, never calloused,\nbecause the man was the biggest softie you had ever met, and you knew Jimin and\nTae.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nIt\nfit his character, then, that he continued to move slowly and carefully all\nover you. \u00a0That he placed himself on the\nbed first instead of pushing you down into it. \nThat he never let go of your hand and always made sure you were connected\nin some way. \u00a0It made sense that every\nkiss he placed on every inch of skin he could reach lingered longer than the\nlast. \u00a0That he took his time and checked\non you and listened to you and asked you constantly with his eyes or his words\nif you were okay or if you needed something. \nIt made sense that he insisted on always facing each other. \u00a0To anyone else, he might have appeared vanilla\nor even lazy, but for you, and to you, there was nothing more intense about the\nway he looked at you, about the way he touched you, about the way he kissed\nyou. \u00a0Good couldn\u2019t even begin to\ndescribe how he made you feel, and your panting breaths and curled toes and\nsweaty limbs had hardly anything to do with why, when you insisted that he had to\nstop before you cried from how overwhelmed you felt, you somehow felt even closer\nwhen he curled around you and simply held you as you fell asleep, discussing\nthe wedding and the night and what tomorrow would bring.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nIt\nwas this growing feeling inside you that even without vows, even without being\nable to smell him, Yoongi was never going to leave you or let you go, and even\nif people called you pathetic, you knew you were never going to let go of him,\neither. \u00a0And even if you couldn\u2019t tell\nhim that, even if you didn\u2019t know how to say exactly what you were feeling,\nYoongi must have known, because he turned over and dragged you with him until\nyou were both facing his nightstand where the vase of jasmine still sat,\nglowing even in the otherwise dark room. \nIt was so much more than a mere

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hoseok\nloved weddings. &nbsp;Loved. &nbsp;Hoseok loved love. &nbsp;How could he not like weddings, then? &nbsp;Plus, dancing? &nbsp;Alcohol? \nHot men in suits looking hot? \nWhat&rsquo;s not to like?</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nHoseok\nhated anxiety, though, and found loving people who had hate in their hearts\nhard to do. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a testament to the\nnurture argument in psychology that Jungkook has turned out so differently than\nhis parents. &nbsp;Hoseok has never really\ndisliked people as much as he has disliked Jungkook&rsquo;s parents lately, and if\nthe way Jimin&rsquo;s face was screwed up was any indication, then the other man must\nbe feeling the same.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nHe\nhad merely come to check in on Tae, and consequently, Jimin, since Jungkook had\ninsisted he was ready and it was time to start, so he almost closed the door\nimmediately when he saw two other figures in the room, but if Hoseok was a cat,\nhe would have been dead a long time ago, because his curiosity has always\ngotten the best of him. &nbsp;Jungkook&rsquo;s\nparents aren&rsquo;t ugly people&mdash;he clearly got his good looks from somewhere&mdash;but\nthey were ugly people. &nbsp;Desperation,\nsurely, or pride, must have gotten the best of their senses at some point. &nbsp;Something had to explain why they seemed to\ncare so little about their son. &nbsp;Hoseok\nknew it wasn&rsquo;t quite his place or business to stay in the room or make himself\nknown or listen at all, but something about what Mr. Jeon murmured about</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;I\ncan&rsquo;t believe we&rsquo;re letting him marry a man,&rdquo; made him stay. &nbsp;Because he knew that there were people out\nthere in the world who still didn&rsquo;t agree with men marrying mem or women\nmarrying women despite that fact that soulmates often were of the same sex. &nbsp;He knew shelters around the city and probably\nthe world were filled with kids whose parents didn&rsquo;t agree with them being with\ntheir soulmate purely because they were the same sex, but still, it jarred him\nto hear. &nbsp;He only entered the room to\nshut the door so Jungkook wouldn&rsquo;t have to hear the rest.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;re\nletting him marry his soulmate,&rdquo; Tae said besides his own soulmate, a fierce\nand intense look in his eyes Hoseok rarely saw. \nHe was glad he rarely saw it, honestly. \nAn angry Tae, just like an angry Jimin, or maybe an angry anyone, scared\nHoseok a little.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;re\nnot even letting him do that,&rdquo; Jimin said, wrapping his arm around Tae for\nsupport. &nbsp;&ldquo;I had to pay you before you\neven allowed that. &nbsp;Now, as I know we\ndidn&rsquo;t invite you, I&rsquo;m going to have to ask you to leave, as there can&rsquo;t be any\nreason for you to be here unless you want something else, and you&rsquo;re not going\nto get it, whatever it is.&rdquo; &nbsp;Jungkook&rsquo;s\nmother had the audacity to try to look affronted at the idea.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;I\nam just here to see my boy get married.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;He\ndoesn&rsquo;t want you here,&rdquo; Jimin said. &nbsp;&ldquo;And\nI don&rsquo;t either. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s his day, our day,\nand you no longer have a right to take part of it.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;What\nwill it look like?&rdquo; Mr. Jeon said, stepping toward Jimin. &nbsp;&ldquo;What will it look like if his parents aren&rsquo;t\nthere?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;It\nwill look like what it is,&rdquo; Tae almost sneered. \n&ldquo;Like you aren&rsquo;t wanted.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;My\nparents aren&rsquo;t here either. &nbsp;They also\nlost the right to have any part in my life when they refused to accept who the\nworld had provided for me and I had managed to find and be found by. &nbsp;So, unless you have a question about the\npayment I already sent you, or the paperwork we have already filled out, you\nneed to leave.&rdquo; &nbsp;If Hoseok wasn&rsquo;t so\nhopelessly in love with Tae, and his best friend wasn&rsquo;t about to marry him,\nHoseok might have had to claim Jimin for himself. &nbsp;He seemed to be burning with a passion that terrified\nand enthralled Hoseok.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nJungkook&rsquo;s\nparents seemed to think, or seethe, for a moment, perhaps looking for an iota\nof an excuse to stay. &nbsp;Hoseok hoped, deep\ndown, that it was some buried deep love for their son that they wanted to stay,\nbut the way that they finally scoffed and stormed out, barely giving him a\nglance on the way, crushed those ideas quickly. \nTheir exit brought Hoseok to Jimin and Tae&rsquo;s attention, and they let go\nof each other so Tae could come to him, enveloping the man in a tight hug.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo;\nJimin said, buttoning his blazer. &nbsp;&ldquo;Is\nJungkook okay?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Oh,\nyeah,&rdquo; Hoseok said over Tae&rsquo;s shoulder. \n&ldquo;He asked me to let you know he&rsquo;s ready.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,\nuh, tell him, yeah?&rdquo; Jimin said, still fidgeting with his suit. &nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;I\nhave no idea what you&rsquo;re talking about,&rdquo; Hoseok said, winking and smiling\nwidely. &nbsp;&ldquo;I saw nothing. &nbsp;I heard nothing. &nbsp;In fact, am I even here? &nbsp;Are any of us here?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Stop,&rdquo;\nTae mumbled, nipping at his ear before pulling away, an arm still held tightly\naround his waist.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Seriously,\nthough, you handled it well. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t\nknow what I would have done if they came to Jungkook&rsquo;s room.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Shit,&rdquo;\nJimin said, the idea having seemed to have not occurred to him as he rushed for\nthe door. &nbsp;Hoseok made sure to stop him\nbefore he got too far, though, putting his arm out to pull him into a hug that\nTae quickly made into a group one.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Hey,\nwhoa, he&rsquo;s alright. &nbsp;Y/N&rsquo;s in there, and\nI told her not to let anyone in except me. \nYou know it&rsquo;s bad luck to see the groom before the wedding.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Well\nthen,&rdquo; Jimin sighed even as a relaxed smile spread over his face, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re doomed\nconsidering I saw him an hour ago.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Yeah,\nno, you&rsquo;re so gross nothing could doom this marriage,&rdquo; Tae said, and Jimin\nsimply blinked and looked at his arm around Hoseok&rsquo;s waist. &nbsp;His soulmate didn&rsquo;t seem deterred, though, as\nhe pulled Hoseok closer. &nbsp;Hoseok sometimes\nwondered if the two soulmates did speak telepathically, because Jimin laughed\nas Tae rested his head on Hoseok&rsquo;s shoulder. \nHe felt a little out of the loop, if he had to be honest, but he knew\nthey weren&rsquo;t being malicious or even meaning to.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Go\ndo your best men duties,&rdquo; Jimin said, waving them out. &nbsp;&ldquo;I need to finish getting ready.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Wait,\nwe actually have to do stuff?&rdquo; Tae pouted as Hoseok tickled his side so he would\nstand up straight. A mere wave of Jimin&rsquo;s hand sent them off again, and as soon\nas his back was turned Hoseok leaned over to give Tae a peck on the cheek which\nmade the man smile as he straightened his own clothes before nodding. &nbsp;&ldquo;Ready?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Ready,&rdquo;\nHoseok nodded back, even if he wasn&rsquo;t exactly sure that was 100% true because\nhe wasn&rsquo;t 100% sure what Tae meant by the question. &nbsp;Still, he followed him out. &nbsp;He would be a dutiful best man. &nbsp;He&rsquo;d do anything to ensure Jungkook had a perfect\nday.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nNothing\nwas perfect in life, of course, even on the day of a wedding between two souls\nwho were clearly meant to be.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Oh\nmy god, fucking, I can&rsquo;t, it just, why won&rsquo;t it button?&rdquo; Jungkook whined and huffed,\nhis fingers dropping lamely to his side. \nYou tried desperately to resist an urge to laugh at him.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo;\nyou said as you closed the door behind you, since something needed to come out\nof your mouth and you assumed laughing at the boy in his nervous state wouldn&rsquo;t\nhelp anything. &nbsp;&ldquo;Let me.&rdquo; &nbsp;He thankfully did, staring up at the ceiling\nand sighing as you easily buttoned his blazer. \nSmoothing out his collar and adjusting his bow-tie even though it didn&rsquo;t\nneed to be, you patted him on the shoulder and stepped back, giving him a final\nlook-over. &nbsp;He spread his hands open in\nfront of himself as if to be on display, and you nodded approvingly. &nbsp;He still only sighed again and slumped into a\nchair before shooting back up immediately, smoothing out his coat and fussing\nwith his pockets. &nbsp;&ldquo;You look extremely\nuncomfortable.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;You\nthink?&rdquo; he huffed, fiddling with his cuffs.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Are\nyou nervous?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Only\na ton.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; &nbsp;The question was simple, but Jungkook still\nlooked up at you seriously as if constructing an argumentative thesis in his\nhead before he responded. &nbsp;&ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; you\nsaid slowly, &ldquo;he is your soulmate.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Yeah,\nno, it&rsquo;s not that. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he sighed, looking past you at the\ndoor again. &nbsp;&ldquo;I just really don&rsquo;t want to\nmess up.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;\nyou said, fighting a smile again. &nbsp;&ldquo;Well,\nwhile I try to make it a point to not quote him, my dad once told me that some\nnerves are good. &nbsp;It just shows you care.&rdquo; &nbsp;Jungkook looked suspicious, so you only\nshrugged. &nbsp;&ldquo;I mean, if you didn&rsquo;t care, you\nwould be apathetic. &nbsp;You obviously want\nto do well and make Jimin happy, so you&rsquo;re nervous. &nbsp;Not that you should be. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll be fine. &nbsp;Great, even. \nIt&rsquo;s just a ceremony. &nbsp;What really\nmatters comes before and after, right?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Right,&rdquo;\nJungkook said, but he still looked uncomfortable or anxious. &nbsp;You couldn&rsquo;t imagine why, as his confidence\nalways seemed boosted around Jimin lately. \nYou saw him anxious at the coffee shop, but that was different. &nbsp;That was trying to please twenty different\npeople at once who were nigh impossible to please even on their best days. &nbsp;He could make the perfect drink, which he\nalways did, and they could still get upset. \nThey weren&rsquo;t really upset at him, but he always seemed to take it that\nway. &nbsp;It was understandable, even if sad. &nbsp;You didn&rsquo;t like seeing Jungkook at work, so\nout of control and uncomfortable. &nbsp;You\ndidn&rsquo;t like him looking so anxious now, either, but you really didn&rsquo;t think he\nshould be.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;What,\num, exactly do you think you&rsquo;re going to mess up? &nbsp;Hoseok and Tae have the rings, right?&rdquo; &nbsp;A nod. \n&ldquo;You know your vows.&rdquo; &nbsp;A\nstatement, not a question, because you knew he did, but he still nodded. &nbsp;&ldquo;Is it Tae? \nAre you worried about if it will be weird or something?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;No,\nno. &nbsp;Not much is going to change. &nbsp;I mean, some stuff, but not much.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Okay. &nbsp;So, what are you worried about messing up?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Just. &nbsp;You know how sometimes you meet someone who&rsquo;s\nbetter at you at something you want to be good at?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Only\nlike every day,&rdquo; you mumbled, only half-joking. \nJungkook glared a little before he continued, not meeting your gaze.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Jimin\nis just good. &nbsp;I know he is. &nbsp;He has a lot of experience. &nbsp;And I&hellip;&rdquo; \nJungkook trailed off, leaving you blinking and struggling to be patient\nand understanding when you would much prefer him to just be blunt.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;At\nwhat?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;You\nknow.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;I\nreally don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;You\nknow,&rdquo; Jungkook said forcefully and slowly. \nYou were about to insist, again, that you didn&rsquo;t know what he was\ntalking about, when he raised his hands, made a circle with one, and proceeded\nto stick his pointer finger through it.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Oh\nmy god,&rdquo; you screamed, doubling over in laughter, much to Jungkook&rsquo;s chagrin. &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, oh my god.&rdquo; &nbsp;Struggling to stop laughing, you reached for\na nearby chair to stable yourself, almost wishing like you didn&rsquo;t know what he\nwas referring to.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Stop,&rdquo;\nJungkook grumbled. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m serious. &nbsp;What if. \nI don&rsquo;t know. &nbsp;I suck?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Oh\nmy god,&rdquo; you said, almost falling over again at his word choice. &nbsp;He seemed to realize it belatedly, too, as he\nhuffed and his cheeks started to color a little. &nbsp;&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t that be good?&rdquo; you\nsaid between breaths. &nbsp;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s\nHoseok? &nbsp;Isn&rsquo;t it time to go?&rdquo; Jungkook mumbled,\npushing past you to open the door. &nbsp;You recovered\nenough to stop him even though your eyes were still watering, leaning against\nthe door to catch your breath and keeping him from escaping.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Hold&mdash;hold\non,&rdquo; you said, putting out your hands to stop him and steady yourself on his\nshoulders. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m sorry for\nlaughing. &nbsp;Jungkook, I&rsquo;m just, it&rsquo;s just,\noh wow, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about that. \nI mean, I get it, but really, Jimin&rsquo;s experience, as you call it, will\nonly serve to help. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll take\ngood care of you. &nbsp;Just, I mean, as a\nnon-male, I don&rsquo;t think I have much advice for you&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;I\ndon&rsquo;t want your advice,&rdquo; Jungkook said, looking appalled.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;But\nat some level it&rsquo;s all the same. &nbsp;You don&rsquo;t\nhave to be in love to have sex, but I&rsquo;m sure it helps. &nbsp;Just don&rsquo;t expect it to be perfect the first\ntime, yeah? &nbsp;It&rsquo;ll probably be awkward\nand weird and&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Great\npep talk,&rdquo; Jungkook said, trying to get past you again. &nbsp;He easily could, you both knew, if it was\npurely up to strength, so he must not have actually wanted to leave the room,\njust the conversation as he let you stop him.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m\njust saying, he&rsquo;ll be good to you. &nbsp;And\nthat will make it great. &nbsp;Just be good\nback. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll have to tell him what you\nlike and don&rsquo;t like. &nbsp;You know him. &nbsp;He&rsquo;ll insist on knowing, maybe even to an\nannoying point.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Yeah,\nyeah.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;But\nthat means you actually have to tell him,&rdquo; you said, poking his chest\nagain. &nbsp;&ldquo;And be honest. &nbsp;It&rsquo;ll be good. &nbsp;Like you said, he&rsquo;s good. &nbsp;Probably good at it, too, but good more so.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo;\nJungkook groaned.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t\nworry. &nbsp;It&rsquo;ll be good.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Is\nit good with Yoongi?&rdquo; Jungkook said so casually and yet quickly that you withdrew\nyour finger back just as fast. &nbsp;The way\nhe blinked and then started to smile down at you was a sign for you to withdraw\nbefore he got the upper hand. &nbsp;He knew\nthat the question alone was already an Ace card, and you turned to open the\ndoor, trying to push him back so he couldn&rsquo;t see or get out. &nbsp;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll\ngo get Hoseok, I&rsquo;m sure he has a lot of great sex advice,&rdquo; you said as loudly\nback at Jungkook as you could, shutting the door in his face before he could\nstop you. &nbsp;The door clicked loudly behind\nyou and radiated through the quiet, but not empty, hallway. &nbsp;The silence only lasted for a second when you\nsaw Hoseok and Tae standing across the hall, smirking at you, Hoseok&rsquo;s eyebrows\nraised. &nbsp;&ldquo;No, I do not want to explain,&rdquo;\nyou said, waving your hands in front of your face to get rid of any unwanted\nquestions or comments. &nbsp;&ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t want\nto explain. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m going to go sit down\nnow.&rdquo; &nbsp;With the shared laughter of Hoseok\nand Tae fading behind you, you fled down the hallway to the small sanctuary, trying\nto slip into your seat unnoticed.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nYou\nmostly were, but the pianist&rsquo;s fingers misstepped, and a note went missing or a\nnote was added, something barely jarring in the flow of music but enough for\nyou to know that someone did notice you entering, and you ducked your head,\ntrying to not be a distraction. &nbsp;The\nmusic continued flawlessly, but you still knew he was watching. &nbsp;You found yourself, as the song continued,\nunable and unwilling to not look up, though, something drawing your head\nup. &nbsp;So it was no surprise to see Min\nYoongi staring and smiling back at you from the stage, his fingers moving effortlessly\nover the keys as he didn&rsquo;t even look at them. \nIt seemed like he had been waiting for you to merely look up, because\nthe second you did and your eyes met across the room, his smile melted into\ncontentment before he focused all of his attention back on the piano in front\nof him. &nbsp;If you had anything else to focus\non, you would have, but you didn&rsquo;t. &nbsp;Completely\nshamelessly, then, you simply watched Yoongi as you sat and waited for the ceremony\nto begin. &nbsp;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nFrankly,\nyou watched him even after the ceremony began. \nYou had seen him that morning but had to rush out to help Kimie finish\ndecorating and help Tae and Jimin get things ready. &nbsp;Yoongi had arrived in the past hour and let\nyou know via text. &nbsp;As people filed in,\nmostly just Jimin&rsquo;s dance friends and a handful of people you didn&rsquo;t know, some\nindescribable anxiety started to settle in as the people began to, as\nwell. &nbsp;It wasn&rsquo;t like Jungkook&rsquo;s nerves. &nbsp;You had nothing to be nervous about, after all. &nbsp;You weren&rsquo;t getting married, and nothing was\nexpected of you the rest of the evening since the flowers were done and you\nwere just going to go home and sleep next to Yoongi like you had been doing for\na while now. &nbsp;Something about watching everyone\nsit down, leaning into someone&rsquo;s ear next to them to whisper something about\nhow pretty it was or about how the famous Min Yoongi was playing beautiful\npiano music, made you keep looking at Yoongi and the empty spot beside you,\nthough, and by the time Yoongi paused, looking over at you one last time before\nhe started the wedding march, you realized what was wrong, even if it made you\nfeel a little pathetic.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nWeddings\nhad always left an odd taste in your mouth. \nYou had only been to a few that you could remember, but even one could\nhave been enough. &nbsp;Seeing people so in\nlove and so meant for each other&mdash;each one you had gone to had been one between\nsoulmates&mdash;had left you numb and hopeless, possibly border lining on angry. &nbsp;While weddings brought two people together\nand thus their families and friends, uniting strangers and solidifying a\nrelationship between many people for years to come, they always had made you\nfeel even more alone. &nbsp;Looking up at\nYoongi now, even if you knew you were his soulmate, made your skin itch and\nyour feet bounce up and down in anticipation. \nYou throat felt parched, and your heart beat too quickly and yet seemed\nto sink. &nbsp;Curling your fingers together\nuntil your nails dug into your palms, you told yourself to calm down. &nbsp;You were and therefore would be happy for\nJimin and Jungkook and not frown and pout and be upset that Yoongi wasn&rsquo;t\nsitting beside you. &nbsp;It was just for a\nfew hours. &nbsp;Afterwards, you could go home\nand be as close as you wanted to him.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nSo\nwhy did you still feel like you were going to be alone forever?</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nThe\nceremony, thankfully, was short, and you were able to concrete on Jimin and\nJungkook. &nbsp;They made it hard not to. &nbsp;Tae and Hoseok stood alone on the stage near\nthe priest&mdash;the same one commissioned to marry off Jungkook before&mdash;something about\nJimin having<i> &ldquo;a ton of friends, but I don&rsquo;t,\nso no, only best men, no groomsmen. &nbsp;Your\nside would be embarrassingly huge.</i>&rdquo; &nbsp;They\nseemed unable to take their eyes off of each other, too, though it was Hoseok\nwho was eyeing Tae more. &nbsp;He looked at\nhis friend entering with Jimin, but only barely, before his eyes went back to\nTae&rsquo;s. &nbsp;His smile seemed to widen any time\nthe man seemed to catch his gaze and shoot him a smile. &nbsp;They both looked sickenly happy and in love,\nso much so it might have looked to some that they were getting married.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nThe\npeonies you and Kimie had picked for the wedding contrasted nicely with Jimin\nand Jungkook&rsquo;s mostly white suits, and you thought it appropriate and sweet that\nthey walked each other down the aisle, having no time or place for their\nfathers or mothers to do the honor. &nbsp;The\npriest spoke not of anyone giving someone away, but of giving each other to the\nother. &nbsp;Of meeting halfway and yet always\ntaking things all the way. &nbsp;Of never\nleaving anything unfinished or unsaid. \nOf completing each other by being complete. &nbsp;It was overly sweet and befitting of the two\nwho couldn&rsquo;t stop smiling at each other, even if Jungkook&rsquo;s face was almost the\ncolor of the flowers he held. &nbsp;You kept\nstealing looks at Yoongi as the priest talked, relieved to see him smiling back\nat you, but you did look back at Jungkook when he handed Jimin the small\nbouquet he had walked in with. &nbsp;The\naction had been completely his idea. &nbsp;He\nhadn&rsquo;t cared at all, and Jimin had had no preference, about what type of flowers\nyou and Kimie thought would look best.</p><p><i>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s your job, not mine.&rdquo;</i> &nbsp;But, naturally curious, he had asked why you\npicked peonies for them, and you had touched the soft petals in front of you\nthat you had brought to show them as you explained.</p><p><i>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;I knew peonies were your flower the\nmoment I met you. &nbsp;They can symbolize\nbashfulness. &nbsp;But,&rdquo;</i>\nyou had said before Jungkook could contradict you, <i>&ldquo;they can also mean compassion. \nIf that isn&rsquo;t Jimin, I don&rsquo;t know what is. &nbsp;In addition, they stand for prosperity,\nspecifically in marriage. &nbsp;I picked it\nfor you but then for Jimin and then for both of you. &nbsp;It also can stand for someone bringing honor to\ntheir entire family through success, and you will. &nbsp;You already have. &nbsp;Jimin will be your family, and he will be yours,\nand you will be nothing but successful.&rdquo;&nbsp;</i></p><p><i></i>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nIt was that, apparently, that made Jungkook think of passing or\nsharing the flower with Jimin, not only as a symbol of himself, but also to\nrepresent him giving himself and all his bashfulness to him. &nbsp;You couldn&rsquo;t tease him for that, even if Hoseok\nhad, and you smiled to see Jimin receiving the flowers from Jungkook with his\nown smile even as they exchanged their vows. \nIt was strange, in a way. &nbsp;Weddings\nare full of such small, seemingly meaningless or mundane actions and words, and\nyet said at that moment, done in that space, shared in front of your friends and\nfamily, they become lifechanging and binding. \nThe words Jimin and Jungkook spoke to each other were nothing new, even\nif they did put their own twist on the traditional vows shared between\nsoulmates. &nbsp;Even this change was nothing\nnew, as a deviation from the norm was to be expected from the two. &nbsp;But it seemed like the whole room held its\nbreath as the two spoke.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;re\nmine.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;And\nyou are mine.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Now and always.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;No matter what the world says.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Until the world ends.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Or my soul stops.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You barely remembered to breathe even\nwhen they finished and kissed, a soft, chaste kiss that almost made Jungkook\nlook bashful again, though that was probably due to Hoseok whistling like a\nfrat boy at a keg stand behind him, because Yoongi was staring at you from\nacross the room, certainly not kissing you, and you felt incomplete and wrong,\nso much so that you stood up. &nbsp;But Yoongi\nturned back to the piano, and everyone else was standing up, too, as Jimin and\nJungkook marched proudly back down the aisle. \nYou remembered to smile, because it was easy to, almost impossible not\nto as your friends passed you. &nbsp;How could\nyou not smile at such happiness? &nbsp;And you\nremembered to look back at Yoongi one last time before following the crowd back\nout, smiling at the way he was watching you leave. &nbsp;Because, really, how could you not smile at\nthat?</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Being involved with the decorating\nhad its advantages, as you had had a say in who you got to sit next to. &nbsp;You picked Kimie and her husband Kai,\nobviously, and Minghao and Jun. &nbsp;The rest\nof Jimin&rsquo;s dance crew and Seth sat nearby. &nbsp;An empty seat reserved for Yoongi was by you,\ntoo, though you doubted he would join the table for much of the evening. &nbsp;He seemed to have teleported to the room and\nwas already set up at a small table with a studio&rsquo;s worth of sound equipment. &nbsp;It looked much to over the top for a small\nwedding, but it was fun to see him work. \nWhile you saw him plenty of times at home concentrating hard on his\nwork, seeing him public was something new. \nHe was just as dedicated and passionate, perhaps even more so, and every\ntime you felt some weird sort of jealousy&mdash;could you be jealous of music?&mdash;it dissipated\nquickly only to be replaced with some weird sort of pride&mdash;could you proud of\nYoongi? It&rsquo;s not like you had any part in what he was doing. &nbsp;Still, it was hard to distract yourself from\nhim or with him. &nbsp;You knew speaking to\nthe people at your table would be polite, but you just wanted to watch\nYoongi. &nbsp;You also knew you should just go\nand talk to him if you wanted to, but you didn&rsquo;t want to distract him from his\nwork. &nbsp;You also wanted to concentrate on\nJungkook and Jimin sitting next to Hoseok and Tae at the front of the\nroom. &nbsp;There was just a little too much\nto concentrate on or to try not to concentrate on, and you eyed the alcohol\ntable wistfully, wanting something to help slow you down and dull your senses. &nbsp;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nYou\nresisted for a long time, thankfully, and were distracted by food and your\ntablemates. &nbsp;Kimie and Kai had plenty to\nsay about Bomi and all of her antics, and Minghao and Jun had plenty to\ncomplain about from the company. &nbsp;They\nquestioned you repetitively about why you hadn&rsquo;t been to the show yet, and you promised\nthem over and over again that you would. \nKimie, the busybody that she was, kept trying to get you to talk about\nYoongi, but her husband thankfully kept her in check, clearly more aware than\nshe was, or more caring, about how often you were glancing at Yoongi across the\nroom. &nbsp;You stopped by your friends&rsquo; table,\ntoo, but you didn&rsquo;t want to stay long. &nbsp;You\nsaw them often, and you didn&rsquo;t want to hog their time. &nbsp;Plus, Hoseok looked about ready to bring up\nthe conversation you wanted to avoid that Jungkook had been embarrassed about,\nand you weren&rsquo;t about to dive into that mess. \nSo you caught up with Seth and chatted about the shelter and met the\nrest of the guests with no expectation of remembering their names come\ntomorrow.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nBut\nby the time the dancing started, some fancy and rich but small meal nestled in\nyour belly, the lights dimmed and your desire to pout and wallow in self-pity returned. &nbsp;As your tablemates got up in pairs to go\ndance, you merely sat and watched and sipped on the glass of wine that had somehow\nmade it to your table and into your hands. \nIt wasn&rsquo;t that you wanted to dance. \nYou really didn&rsquo;t know how to, certainly not like Jimin and Jungkook\nand, well, everyone else, seemed to know how to. &nbsp;Dancing like everyone was doing was not so\nmuch about doing certain steps or even doing them correctly, but it was about\nbeing close. &nbsp;This type of dancing, of leaning\nclose and resting a cheek on someone else&rsquo;s shoulder, was about intimacy, about\ntrust and a desire to simply belong to another person. &nbsp;This type of dancing made your insides\nburn. &nbsp;Or maybe that was the glass you\nfinished and refilled to avoid watching how content everyone looked on the\ndance floor.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nStill,\nyou turned back in toward the table and glowered a bit, an urge to pretend to\ntext someone coming over you. &nbsp;You could\ngo on a quest for the bathroom or find something else to distract you with, but\nyou knew nothing was going to be enough. \nThe scraping of a chair nearby barely even caught your attention, though\nsomeone&rsquo;s hand refilling your glass was enough for you to look up.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Having\na blast?&rdquo; Seth said casually with only a hint of sarcasm in his voice. &nbsp;Unsure how to answer, you kept your mouth\nshut, and he put the bottle down slowly until you turned enough to look at\nhim. &nbsp;&ldquo;Do you want to dance?&rdquo; he said\nonce you were, but you wrinkled your lips and brow in answer. &nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah, me either. &nbsp;Just thought I&rsquo;d ask, though, as you looked\npretty bored.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Not\nbored,&rdquo; you hummed, &ldquo;just not much of a wedding person.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Me\neither,&rdquo; Seth said, &ldquo;but this one seems nice.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Yeah,\nit turned out really pretty.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;You\nlook really pretty, too,&rdquo; he said, and you laughed, waving a hand at him before\nsipping on your drink again. &nbsp;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Yoongi\npicked it out. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m pretty clueless when\nit comes to being fancy. &nbsp;I feel pretty\nout of place.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;You\nlook it.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;You\ndon&rsquo;t look much better.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;I\ndon&rsquo;t disagree,&rdquo; Seth shrugged. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s not\nthat he didn&rsquo;t look nice. &nbsp;He cleaned up\nwell, but he clearly was someone unused to wearing tight, fitted, pressed\nshirts and ties practically strangling his neck. &nbsp;You wondered if his sense of discomfort was\nanything akin to yours.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;You,\nuh, didn&rsquo;t bring a date?&rdquo; you said, not sure how to simply ask outright if it\nwasn&rsquo;t just his clothes that made him feel out of place. &nbsp;The idea made Seth laugh, though he didn&rsquo;t\nlook upset or annoyed.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Nah,\nno time for that right now. &nbsp;Hey, can I\nask,&rdquo; he said, scooting his chair closer and leaning in a bit, &ldquo;how it&rsquo;s going with\nYoongi?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;\nyou said eloquently, not sure if you were surprised by the question or his\nproximity or by how long it had been since you had looked over at the man in\nquestion or by how much you apparently had had to drink.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Yoongi. &nbsp; How&rsquo;s it going with him? &nbsp;I only ask because I thought, when you left\nbefore Thanksgiving to go stay with him that you weren&rsquo;t too happy about\nit. &nbsp;You seemed really sad to leave, but\nthen you didn&rsquo;t come back. &nbsp;So I just\nwondered. &nbsp;I mean, I assume it&rsquo;s going\nwell.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;\nyou said, sighing for some reason and sinking back into your chair, your\nposture surely not eloquent or attractive. \n&ldquo;Yeah. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s going well.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;What&rsquo;s\nit been like? &nbsp;I mean, I&rsquo;m taking this\nclass on documented soulmate oddities. \nIt&rsquo;s so fascinating, and I told my professor about you. &nbsp;She was, is, super interested. &nbsp;So I just wondered what it&rsquo;s been like\nwithout being able to smell and all.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Seth,&rdquo;\nyou said slowly as it seemed like he was getting riled up. &nbsp;He rarely did, except on book club nights,\nand even then it was in pure ridiculousness. \n&ldquo;I&rsquo;d prefer if you didn&rsquo;t talk to other people about me.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Oh,\nright. &nbsp;I mean, I didn&rsquo;t say your\nname. &nbsp;Purely from an academic\nstandpoint, it&rsquo;s an interesting case&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m\nnot a case study,&rdquo; you frowned, sitting up straight and putting your glass\ndown, suddenly needing your head to be clear. \n&ldquo;Or an experiment. &nbsp;My experience\nisn&rsquo;t something to be documented or analyzed like some lab rat.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;No,\nof course not,&rdquo; Seth backtracked, leaning closer on his knees. &nbsp;&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you think you should tell your\nstory? &nbsp;What if there are other people\nout there like you?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;There\naren&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;You\ndon&rsquo;t know that. &nbsp;Look, Tae&rsquo;s whole point\nin starting the shelter was to help people with soulmate oddities. &nbsp;The world doesn&rsquo;t accept them. &nbsp;I just want to help. &nbsp;I couldn&rsquo;t even believe I found this class to\nbegin with. &nbsp;Some university in Sweden\nhas been studying oddities&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;I\ndon&rsquo;t like that word.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Sorry. &nbsp;Unusual? \nNo, because there is no usual, not really. &nbsp;Well, there is what society expects, and then\nthere are people who don&rsquo;t meet those expectations. &nbsp;And that&rsquo;s not a bad thing,&rdquo; Seth\nemphasized. &nbsp;&ldquo;Society should change its\nexpectations, is my point. &nbsp;Society\nshouldn&rsquo;t look down on you or treat you differently or anything. &nbsp;But one way to help them stop doing that is\nto normalize the differences. &nbsp;Everyone\nthinks things are a certain way because they&rsquo;ve been told that, they&rsquo;ve read\nthat. &nbsp;If we tell them different stories,\nwrite down different stories, then maybe they&rsquo;ll stop being so, I don&rsquo;t know,\nignorant and awful.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;I\nagree,&rdquo; you said slowly, because of course you did. &nbsp;&ldquo;But, my story, if you will, isn&rsquo;t over yet,\nso I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s time to share it yet.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Fair\nenough,&rdquo; Seth said, finally leaning back and looking around the table for\nsomeone&rsquo;s drink to steal. &nbsp;&ldquo;But let me\nknow if you ever want to, yeah? &nbsp;I mean,\nscientifically or psychologically, or whatever, it&rsquo;s fascinating. &nbsp;But I also just care about you, you\nknow? &nbsp;So I just want to make sure you&rsquo;re\nhappy with him and not feeling coerced.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Coerced?&rdquo;\nyou said, frowning as Seth nodded.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Yeah,\nlied to. &nbsp;Manipulated. &nbsp;I mean, he could be lying to you.&rdquo; &nbsp;Despite your past thoughts and actions and\nwords, you felt yourself bristle.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;I\nthought about that. &nbsp;I thought that,\nhonestly, for a while, but I know now that he isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;How\ndo you know?&rdquo; Seth said, not trying to trick you or be mean, just genuine\ncuriosity and care in his tone. &nbsp;&ldquo;I mean,\nif no one else can smell you and you can&rsquo;t smell him. &nbsp;How do you know?&rdquo; &nbsp;Reaching for a glass of water, you thought\nfor a moment before answering, looking out at the crowd.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Have\nyou met your soulmate yet?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Do\nyou think you will one day?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;I\nhope so. &nbsp;I could live without her, or\nhim, but I know I would be glad to meet them.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Could\nyou see yourself dating or being with someone even if they weren&rsquo;t your soulmate?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Totally,\nI&rsquo;m not opposed to much,&rdquo; Seth shrugged, and you thoroughly believed him.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;At\nsome point, they might tell you they loved you, right?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;I\nhope so,&rdquo; Seth laughed softly, and you nodded, agreeing with his reaction.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;So\nhow would you know, if they weren&rsquo;t your soulmate, that they loved you?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Well,\nI would just trust them. &nbsp;Maybe know by\nhow they acted, too.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Well,\nthat&rsquo;s it then,&rdquo; you shrugged, smiling softly back at him. &nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how I know Yoongi is telling the\ntruth.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Fair\nenough,&rdquo; Seth smiled back, lifting his&mdash;or whoever&rsquo;s it was&mdash;glass as a form of\nsalute toward you. &nbsp;&ldquo;Then I am satisfied.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Glad\nI could help,&rdquo; you said, laughing as you finished your glass of water. &nbsp;The two of you sat in quiet for a bit before\nhe excused himself, saying something about wanting to check on Tae, and soon\nJun and Minghao slumped back into their seats, panting hard and fumbling to get\nwater into their glasses without making a mess. \nThe dance floor had become crowded as the music shied away from only\nslow-dancing, and the men were already sweaty, loosening their ties and leaving\ntheir blazers on the back of seats instead of clinging to their backs.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;You\nknow, for dancers, I would think you would have more stamina.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Oh,\nno,&rdquo; Jun panted, &ldquo;the opposite. &nbsp;We dance\nso much, even a little bit more is like running five extra miles.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Stop\nexaggerating,&rdquo; Minghao laughed, slapping his partner on the back as Jun gulped\ndown water. &nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re just exhausted from\nall of the training plus shows. &nbsp;No shame\nin being tired. &nbsp;We still look better\nthan most of those fools out there.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Ming!&rdquo;\nJun gasped, smacking him in return, but Minghao just laughed, pointing at Ten\nand Taemin currently trying to out body roll each other next to Kai and Kimie who\nboth looked unperturbed. &nbsp;Realizing he\nwas just talking about their ridiculous friends, Jun joined in in laughing at\nthem, especially when Tae and Hoseok joined in, entrapping unsuspecting and\ninnocent bystanders just trying to have a little harmless fun and exposing them\nto their shameless sensual twists and turns. \nHaving someone sitting with you at the table calmed your nerves a\nlittle, though part of you was still itching to move or leave or do\nsomething. &nbsp;When Jun got up, mumbling\nsomething about finding more water, you sat next to Minghao as he smiled and\nhummed while watching his friends.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Hey,\nMinghao, could I ask you a question?&rdquo; you finally said, eyeing the way Jimin\nand Jungkook were dancing slowly and closely, more rocking and whispering into\neach other&rsquo;s ears, despite the upbeat tempo and grinding of bodies all around\nthem.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Of\ncourse.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;You\nknow Yoongi? &nbsp;The guy DJing over there?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Yeah,\nof course I know Min Yoongi,&rdquo; he laughed, not even needing to look.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;I\nwas wondering&mdash;well, there&rsquo;s this girl at the shelter who can smell everyone&rsquo;s\nsoulmate scent.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Oh,\nwow,&rdquo; Minghao breathed, his smile fading. \n&ldquo;Wait, like me?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Not\nquite. &nbsp;Tae explained it like she smells\neveryone&rsquo;s, so she thinks everyone is her soulmate.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Oh,\nwow,&rdquo; Minghao said again, his eyes going impossibly wide. &nbsp;&ldquo;Shit. \nFuck. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s. &nbsp;Wow, that must be awful.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;I\ndon&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; you shrugged. &nbsp;&ldquo;I mean, I\nimagine so. &nbsp;Not exactly easy to deal\nwith. &nbsp;I just thought, maybe some day, if\nyou have time, after the show and everything, that you could talk to her? &nbsp;You&rsquo;re the only person I know who could probably\nrelate to her at all.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Oh,\nyeah, wow, I&rsquo;d love to,&rdquo; the man said, clapping his hands over his thighs, some\nbubble of excitement over the prospect growing within him. &nbsp;&ldquo;Wow, poor girl. &nbsp;Yes, please tell her I will.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;I\nwill,&rdquo; you smiled. &nbsp;&ldquo;But I was also\nwondering, well, she said Yoongi smelled like Christmas, and I&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;No,&rdquo;\nMinghao said, his smile fading and his face instantly serious.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;No,&rdquo;\nhe said again as you frowned.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;I\ndidn&rsquo;t even ask anything.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;I\nknow what you&rsquo;re going to ask. &nbsp;Everyone\nasks. &nbsp;But I&rsquo;m not going to tell you what\nhe smells like. &nbsp;The last time I did that&rdquo;&mdash;his\ngaze searched the room until it fell on Jungkook and Jimin&mdash;&ldquo;I almost ruined something\ngood for one of my dear friends, so no.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;But\nyou didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; you persisted. &nbsp;&ldquo;You helped. &nbsp;You helped make this day happen, in fact.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;The\nanswer is still no.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;\nyou said, sounding desperate.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t\nknowing he smells like Christmas enough?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;What? &nbsp;No,&rdquo; you huffed, crossing your arms over your\nchest. &nbsp;&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t that be a thousand different\nsmells?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Why\ndoes it matter to you, anyway? &nbsp;You can&rsquo;t\nsmell him,&rdquo; Minghao said. &nbsp;He shut his\nlips the second it was out of them, but it was already too late. &nbsp;They opened again immediately as he surged\nforward. &nbsp;&ldquo;Shit, I&rsquo;m sorry, I didn&rsquo;t mean&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;You\ndid. &nbsp;And you&rsquo;re right. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s okay. \nForget I asked, or, almost asked,&rdquo; you said, standing up.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Y/N,\nseriously, I shouldn&rsquo;t have said that, I&rsquo;m sorry, I just don&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;I\nget it,&rdquo; you sighed, even if you didn&rsquo;t really. &nbsp;If you couldn&rsquo;t smell him, why was it such a\nbig deal to just confirm or deny what someone else said he smelled like? &nbsp;But Minghao was right. &nbsp;It shouldn&rsquo;t matter to you what Yoongi\nsmelled like, since you couldn&rsquo;t smell him, anyway. &nbsp;But to be reminded so quickly and bluntly\nwhen you were already feeling a little untethered and insecure did nothing to\nhelp your insecurities. &nbsp;Standing up only\nmade it all worse, as the world seemed to spin a bit as you fought to steady\nyourself, reaching out for nothing until your own two feet started to move\ntoward something. &nbsp;You weren&rsquo;t sure, and\nyet you knew exactly where they were heading, and you all but tripped or fell,\nwishing you weren&rsquo;t so tipsy and clumsy, into Yoongi&rsquo;s arms not even halfway to\nwhere you had last seen him, hiding behind some computer screen and adjusting\nthe sound as everyone else danced the night away.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo;\nhe said into your hair, his arms already wrapping around you, steadying you and\nguiding you all at the same time. &nbsp;&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s\nget some air.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nYou\ndidn&rsquo;t really want or need any air unless it was what he was sharing with you,\nso you followed him, no, walked with him, outside.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;The\nmusic,&rdquo; you mumbled half-heartedly, but he only chuckled and pulled you closer,\namazing you at his ability to not trip or let you trip even though not one of\nyour four legs combined were walking in a straight line out the doors.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;I\nset up a list. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m not even needed.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;That&rsquo;s\nnot true,&rdquo; you sighed into his chest, feeling like he must surely be carrying\nyou or you were both floating because you were moving still despite how much\nyou were clinging to him. &nbsp;&ldquo;I need you.&rdquo; &nbsp;He merely hummed in reply, but it went\nstraight through your hair and into your scalp and sent goosebumps all over\nyour skin, though that may have simply been the winter air. &nbsp;&ldquo;Cold,&rdquo; you gasped as you suddenly realized\nyou didn&rsquo;t have a coat on.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Yeah,\nI didn&rsquo;t think this through,&rdquo; Yoongi laughed, hugging you tighter. &nbsp;The warmth radiating off of his chest did\nhelp, but your legs and arms were chilled exponentially. &nbsp;As he fumbled to open the door to get back\ninside, you couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh into his chest, the whole scene warming you\neven more, though not as much as when you finally did get back inside, both of\nyou breathing and shuddering in relief at how warm it was inside. &nbsp;Still, he didn&rsquo;t lead you back into the room\nwhere everyone was. &nbsp;You could hear the\nmusic, still, even if some words sounded slurred and the bass was louder than\nanything else. &nbsp;There was no need to hold\nonto Yoongi anymore, but you still did.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Are\nyou having a good time?&rdquo; he said softly, and if he meant at that moment, you\nknew the answer was a resounding yes, but you shifted a little to look up at\nhim.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Honestly?&rdquo;\nyou said, waiting for him to nod. &nbsp;&ldquo;Yes. &nbsp;Everything seemed to go smoothly, and Jimin\nand Jungkook look so happy, and everything is beautiful.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;But?&rdquo;\nYoongi said for you, hearing it already in your voice.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s\nselfish,&rdquo; you said, hiding your face back in his chest. &nbsp;He let you for a moment, perhaps thinking you\nwould tell him without any prompting, but you swayed back and forth enough\ntimes for him to finally nudge your shoulder. \n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s stupid. &nbsp;It doesn&rsquo;t matter\nnow,&rdquo; you muttered.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;I\nsee,&rdquo; he said, his tone clearly not convinced. \n&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m having a great time, too, if you want to know.&rdquo; &nbsp;Realizing how rude you were being, how truly\nselfish you were, you lifted your head up to apologize, but Yoongi was only\nsmiling. &nbsp;&ldquo;But I realize I would have\npreferred sitting with you.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Oh. &nbsp;Oh?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Oh\nis right,&rdquo; Yoongi chuckled, his thumbs barely moving up and down in tiny\nmotions on your back. &nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s never\nhappened before. &nbsp;And I&rsquo;m not\ncomplaining. &nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t think about it, when\nI told Jungkook I&rsquo;d help. &nbsp;I just\nthought, hey, music, I can do that. &nbsp;I\nwant to do that. &nbsp;I love doing that. &nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t think about how hard it would be to not\nbe able to be by you, to whisper about how good the place looked or about how\nhappy the boys seem. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t really care\nfor big social events, so I didn&rsquo;t think it would matter, not sitting by you at\ndinner and refilling your glass and making sure you had everything you needed. &nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t know a wedding would make me so\nsappy, but it&rsquo;s been really hard to concentrate all day, because I just want to\ntake care of you, and seeing you sitting alone was a sight I loathe, absolutely\nhate. &nbsp;You should never, ever be alone unless\nyou want to be, you know? &nbsp;Like, if you\nneed space or something. &nbsp;But otherwise,\nI should always be right beside you.&rdquo; \nYoongi slowed down as you looked up at him, your mouth slightly\nopened. &nbsp;You thought, for a moment, that\nhe must be suddenly reading your mind and revealing everything that you had\nbeen feeling for hours, which was, of course, absurd, but still. &nbsp;&ldquo;Is that pathetic?&rdquo; he said with a crooked\nsmile, causing you to shake your head adamantly.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;No! &nbsp;No.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Then\nyou&rsquo;re not, either,&rdquo; he said softly.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;How\ndid&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;I\ncould say something about being your soulmate and thus being able to read your\nmind or something,&rdquo; Yoongi almost chuckled, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t even know if it&rsquo;s as deep\nas that. &nbsp;You just&mdash;you&rsquo;ve gotten easy to\nread, is all, so I could tell. &nbsp;And,\nbesides, no one likes to be alone, much less on a wedding. &nbsp;Being single at a wedding is the absolute\nworse. &nbsp;Trust me, I know. &nbsp;I wanted to die at Namjoon and Jin&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Yoongi,\nyou shouldn&rsquo;t joke about that.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Right. &nbsp;No, I know, sorry. &nbsp;But, I mean, it makes you feel incredibly\nlonely and depressed. &nbsp;Or it makes me\nfeel that way. &nbsp;And I was standing over\nthere, pushing buttons on a computer thinking how it didn&rsquo;t have to be that\nway. &nbsp;You were literally right across the\nroom from me. &nbsp;Will you be mad if I was\nkind of waiting to see if you could come up to me first?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;You\nwere busy working!&rdquo; you scoffed, hitting his arm lightly. &nbsp;&ldquo;I was waiting for you to notice how unhappy\nI was and come make it all better. &nbsp;What\nare we, twelve? &nbsp;Isn&rsquo;t that sad?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;If\nit is, then we&rsquo;re just pathetic with each other,&rdquo; Yoongi laughed.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;For\neach other, yeah,&rdquo; you said teasingly, but Yoongi went a little stiff, and you\nlooked up again at him to see him staring at you seriously. &nbsp;&ldquo;What?&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Do\nyou mean that?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;What?&rdquo;\nyou repeated, looking around uneasily.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Do\nyou really mean you&rsquo;re pathetic for me?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Yoongi,&rdquo;\nyou whined, not liking how teasing his voice was becoming.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Do\nyou want to slow dance under the moonlight with me?&rdquo; &nbsp;His hands moved to your hips as he started to\nsway back and forth, bringing your body with him easily for a moment.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Yoongi,&rdquo;\nyou tried to complain, but instead you just put your arms over his shoulders,\nfeeling even more like a twelve-year-old at some middle school dance with no\nexperience and no idea of how to handle the flurry of bugs threatening to erupt\nout of you like some flesh-eating alien.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Do\nyou want to cuddle and watch stupid movies just as an excuse to be close to me?&rdquo;\nhe said, pulling you closer with a hand on your back so abruptly that you\nalmost squeaked in surprise when your hips collided. &nbsp;He simply looked down at you for a moment as\nhe continued to move his feet in tiny patterns as you followed him effortlessly\nand wordlessly. &nbsp;This wasn&rsquo;t dancing, it\nwas simply being, and even though you could still feel the cold from the door\nnearby, you felt yourself warming up as a comfortable heat crept up your neck.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Yoongi,&rdquo;\nyou said slowly, searching his face for something. &nbsp;He was doing the same to you, and you weren&rsquo;t\nsure what he was after or wanted, but you were absolutely positive you would\ngive it to him if he simply asked or even told you. &nbsp;When his head moved, yours did, too, tilting\nas you craned your neck to give him enough room. &nbsp;He fit against you so well, always a little\nbehind your ear and a little close to your collarbone, but mostly just flush\nagainst your cheek and neck, and your arms went a little limp when his fingers\nwrapped around the other side or your neck to help position you a bit better.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Do\nyou want to kiss me,&rdquo; he breathed, even as he did so, the mere side of his lips\ntouching your skin so faintly that you almost wanted to turn your head just to\nfeel the rest of them, &ldquo;until we&rsquo;re both breathless and desperate for more?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Y-Yoongi.&rdquo; &nbsp;You almost gasped, like the pathetic, totally-gone-for-Yoongi\nperson you were, your fingers slipping to his collar purely to have something\nto hold onto. &nbsp;Nothing he was doing was\nnew. &nbsp;You were used to him rubbing his\ncheek against yours. &nbsp;You were used to\nhim whispering things into your ear that may have embarrassed you at one point\nbut now only made you feel safe and wanted and longing for more. &nbsp;You were used to the kisses on your neck or\nbehind your ear or along your collarbone that always stayed in the same area\nbut sent a shock through your entire body. \nBut you were used to Yoongi always initiating and acting. &nbsp;You never reciprocated, and something twisted\nin your gut akin to regret and guilt, like you had messed up and had been\nhurting him by never giving back to him. \nYou weren&rsquo;t used to acting upon what you wanted or asking for what you\nwanted or simply taking what you wanted, either, so you were more surprised\nthan Yoongi was when you pushed back against his cheek and mumbled his name\nagain as you sank down onto his shoulder, rubbing your nose over the small\nspace of skin you could find above his collar. \nYour fingers dug into his shirt and tried to move the affronting\nmaterial out of the way because you suddenly felt desperate to find something,\nanything, even though you trembled all the while, knowing you weren&rsquo;t going to\nfind anything.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Do\nyou want to smell me?&rdquo; Yoongi whispered, his mouth so close to your ear that\nhis words made you gasp and then groan in frustration even as you nodded against\nhis neck, searching and searching hopelessly. \n</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Shit,\nYoongi,&rdquo; you choked on nothing, on nothing but air and the lack of it, the absence\nof anything but pure, clean, unscented air flowing through your airway that felt\ntoxic and unclean and wrong, wrong, wrong.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Y/N,&rdquo;\nhe said so slowly and calmly and yet so clearly on the edge of desperation&mdash;for what?\nfor you? &nbsp;or for you?&mdash;that you couldn&rsquo;t\nstop the desperate tears from pooling in your eyes that found themselves transferred\nto his skin as you tried again to find the rest of him. &nbsp;Christmas? \nWhat did Christmas smell like? \nWhat did he smell like? &nbsp;&ldquo;Fuck,\nhold on, babe, I&rsquo;m sorry, I have to take you home. &nbsp;Can we do that? &nbsp;Can we go home?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Yeah,\nyeah,&rdquo; you mumbled, not caring about anything but finding his scent. &nbsp;Perhaps it was buried underneath his shirt or\nunderneath his skin. &nbsp;Perhaps if you just\nsearched all over him, you would find it.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Y/N,\nhold on,&rdquo; he said gently as he took a giant breath, the air running over your neck\nas it rushed into his mouth. &nbsp;The kiss he\nplaced on your neck was probably meant to calm you down, to be some promise of\nmore to come, but it only made you cling to him tighter as he tried to pull\naway. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; he\nmumbled, running his fingers through your hair and placing his hands over yours. &nbsp;&ldquo;I-we-have to pack up my stuff, then we can\ngo. &nbsp;Okay?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Please?&rdquo;\nyou said to him, or to his scent, or to the universe, desperate for him to not\nlet go.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Okay,\nokay,&rdquo; he said, his hand on your back as his head moved back and forth as he\nthought. &nbsp;You hadn&rsquo;t let go of him, and\nyou really didn&rsquo;t plan to, even as he managed to pull out his phone and call\nsomeone, the low drone of someone on the other end unrecognizable to you and\nunappealing. &nbsp;You barely registered what\nYoongi was saying, though you did notice the way he stuttered and sucked in a\nbreath when you finally, finally started to mouth at his neck.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nHe\ndidn&rsquo;t taste like anything, not really, which you knew was a mistake, which you\nknew was wrong. &nbsp;Except it wasn&rsquo;t, really. &nbsp;You were the mistake. &nbsp;You were wrong. &nbsp;You knew he smelled like something&mdash;what does\nChristmas smell like?&mdash;and you knew he must therefore taste like something&mdash;Christmas?\nLike those candy canes? Fruit cake? What did people eat at Christmas?&mdash;but it was\nnothing, there was nothing, just smooth, warm skin that you were determined to\nfind something in.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Y/N,&rdquo;\nYoongi&rsquo;s voice brought you a back a little, though you still didn&rsquo;t leave his\nneck alone until he pulled on your ear lightly but enough for you to blink and\nlet go of him until his hands cupped your face and brought it front of his\nown. &nbsp;&ldquo;You with me?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;I\nwant to smell you,&rdquo; you said, barely aware of the tears covering your\nface. &nbsp;&ldquo;I-I want to do all that.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;I\nknow, babe, me too. &nbsp;Let&rsquo;s go home and we\ncan do whatever want, okay?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo;\nyou said shakily, because it wasn&rsquo;t quite okay. \nYou were sure you could do everything and anything you wanted with and\nto him, but you couldn&rsquo;t smell him, and you weren&rsquo;t sure if anything else was\ngoing to be enough. &nbsp;&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; you nodded\nagain, though, because you had to let go of him so you could walk, and you panicked\nfor a moment that he was going to take you back into the main room where\neveryone would see how much of a mess you had suddenly become, though in\nreality it had been building up for hours or days or years, but he dragged you\nright past the hall, the music temporarily becoming louder as you passed the\nopen doors.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Stay\nhere for just a second?&rdquo; he said gently, placing you against a wall and waiting\nfor you to nod before he let go. &nbsp;You did\nnot count the seconds he was gone, but he was back in a flash with nothing but\nyours and his coat. &nbsp;He helped you into\nyours before putting his own on before sticking his hand out to you that you\ntook gratefully. &nbsp;You end up clinging to\nhis entire arm, but he didn&rsquo;t seem to mind.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Your\nequipment?&rdquo; you said as he walked you outside, but he simply shrugged.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Called\nSeihoon, one of my sound techs. &nbsp;He&rsquo;ll\ncome pack it all up.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Are\nyou sure?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m\nthe boss. &nbsp;Of course I&rsquo;m sure. &nbsp;I ignored you for long enough.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;You\ndidn&rsquo;t. &nbsp;You weren&rsquo;t, really. &nbsp;I think, no, I know, if I really needed you,\nyou would have been by me in a heartbeat. \nYou were watching out for me. &nbsp;I\nwas just wallowing a bit. &nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t feel\nignored, just a little needy.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s\nokay to be needy. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll give you whatever\nyou need,&rdquo; Yoongi said assuredly, raising the hand he was holding to his mouth\nto kiss along your knuckles. &nbsp;You merely\nnodded, because you believed him. &nbsp;You\njust knew, based on what he was saying and based on his past actions, that he\nwas telling the truth. &nbsp;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nBut\nyou also knew that he could never give you what you felt like you really\nneeded. &nbsp;Still, you climbed in the car\nafter him and sat as close to him as possible, because if you couldn&rsquo;t smell\nhim, you would take whatever else you could get, and the quiet that fell as you\ndrove home, the urge and desperation fading into something more like\ncontentment and peace, was almost enough because you shared it with him.</p><p><br /></p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Seokjin knew he was difficult. &nbsp;Not necessarily difficult to please. &nbsp;Just. \nDifficult. &nbsp;He was a child in an\nadult&rsquo;s body, Yoongi once said, and he had meant it as an insult. &nbsp;Seokjin was easily upset and riled up. &nbsp;He was defiant sometimes to the point of\nbeing bratty. &nbsp;He was picky and liked\nthings to be done a certain way. &nbsp;He had\ngained a lot of real confidence, not just faking it when he felt insecure, over\nthe years and was willing to fight anyone who tried to argue with him.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But he was also extremely polite and\nrespectful. &nbsp;All of his staff had always\nsaid so. &nbsp;He had worked with countless of\nother actors and singers and models by this point in his career, and they always\nall agreed he had a humility like no other. \nHe was selfless and thought of others, always wanting to make sure they\nwere fed and taken care of. &nbsp;He listened\nto the concern of all his employees, even down to the janitors, so he knew he\nwasn&rsquo;t all bad.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So he was humble enough to know that\nY/N may have been right about needing to apologize to Yoongi, but stubborn enough\nto know that Yoongi wasn&rsquo;t completely innocent; it took two people to be in a\nrelationship, two people to create conflict, two people to not resolve things,\ntwo people to want to try again.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But it was bothering him. &nbsp;It bothered him, for some unknown reason he\ncouldn&rsquo;t wrap his head around, to see Yoongi so happy. &nbsp;He had no reason to be jealous; nothing about\nNamjoon ever left him unsatisfied. \nSeokjin may be hard to please, but Namjoon did nothing but please\nhim. &nbsp;He felt a little faulty, though,\nlike a soulmate gone wrong, when he felt a twinge of remorse. &nbsp;Some odd feeling of knowing he and Yoongi had\nbeen happy together for a while slipping away. \nHe wondered if they had ever been happy, or if it had merely been a\npre-courser, some fake form of happiness that wouldn&rsquo;t quite do in the long\nrun, that they both knew wouldn&rsquo;t last but was only getting them ready for the\nreal deal. &nbsp;And when Seokjin had found\nthe real deal in Namjoon, Yoongi had had to wait for years until Y/N came\nalong, and Seokjin had to watch him suffer and hurt and push people away for\nall that time. &nbsp;So he wasn&rsquo;t jealous, and\nhe knows he doesn&rsquo;t regret what happened, because it brought him to Namjoon,\nbut he was sad. &nbsp;Sad that it took so long\nfor Yoongi to finally be as happy as Seokjin has been for years now. &nbsp;He knows Yoongi&rsquo;s been happy, as his music\nmakes him extremely so like nothing else can, but it all seems pale in\ncomparison to how he looks now. &nbsp;He never\ngot to see Yoongi look like that, and he knows it&rsquo;s no fault of his own. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s not jealous. &nbsp;He wasn&rsquo;t. \nBut he felt unsettled, still, and not just because Namjoon was\nsnoring. &nbsp;He was used to that. &nbsp;It happened every night, after all, and\ncouldn&rsquo;t be helped by this point. \nSomeone else might find it annoying, but it was endearing to Seokjin. &nbsp;It was his white noise, a rhythm to rock him\nto sleep, his assurance that Namjoon was there and proof that he was sleeping\nsoundly beside him. &nbsp;He would have felt\nbad for waking him up as he rolled over, but he knew Namjoon wouldn&rsquo;t care. &nbsp;Knew he would wake up in a heartbeat if he\nfelt like Seokjin needed him.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Joon. &nbsp;Joon? \nJoonie!&rdquo; &nbsp;So maybe it took him a\nminute to wake up, and another minute to realize who was waking him up, but he\nstill did, and even though Namjoon couldn&rsquo;t hurt a crab, he looked ready to\nfight.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Wh-what? &nbsp;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Nothing, you big baby,&rdquo; Seokjin\nsaid, patting his chest so he would lie back down.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Why am I awake then?&rdquo; &nbsp;Seokjin waited until Namjoon fell back into\nhim, his freakishly long arms and legs flopping onto him dramatically. &nbsp;Seokjin let out a dramatic breath of air in return,\neven though he was the one who started it.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;m a dick?&rdquo; &nbsp;The rustling and rearranging stilled as\nNamjoon blinked, his lashes tickling Seokjin&rsquo;s skin.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Why are you asking that?&rdquo; Namjoon\nsaid, because of course he would. &nbsp;There\nwere no simply yes or no answers with Namjoon, and even though Seokjin sighed,\nhe appreciated it. &nbsp;Namjoon made him\nthink about everything that he did, and he wanted to explain himself to him. &nbsp;Hardly ever to anyone else, but Namjoon was\ndifferent. &nbsp;It wasn&rsquo;t even a soulmate\nthing; Namjoon just loved figuring people out.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Something Y/N said. &nbsp;About me hurting Yoongi.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s broad and vague all at the\nsame time. &nbsp;Is there something specific\nshe said you did?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;She said I told Yoongi that he was\nlucky to date me and that I told him when we broke up that no one would ever\nlove him.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Did you say all that?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I,&rdquo; Seokjin mumbled, buying some\ntime by running his hands up and down Namjoon&rsquo;s arm and back, whatever parts of\nhim he could reach. &nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t\nremember. &nbsp;Does it sound like something I\nwould say?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Honestly?&rdquo; Namjoon chuckled, the\npuffs of air tickling Seokjin. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure\nyou&rsquo;ve said worse to him. &nbsp;But most of\nthe time you&rsquo;re just messing with him. \nYour weird YoonJin language.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;YoonJin? &nbsp;I haven&rsquo;t heard that in a long time,&rdquo; Seokjin\nlaughed, as much as he could with Namjoon on his ribcage.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Your crazy fans and their crazy\nship names.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t remind me,&rdquo; Seokjin hummed.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s always been able to tell\nmore than you when someone&rsquo;s not teasing.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Hey, he said mean things, too.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah, but you always knew when he\nwas purposefully being mean. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s much\nmore blunt than you are, and you know it. \nYou&rsquo;re super passive aggressive when you want to be.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I&mdash;I am,&rdquo; Seokjin sighed. &nbsp;There was no use denying it. &nbsp;&ldquo;So,&rdquo; he said after a moment, twirling\nNamjoon&rsquo;s hair between his fingers. &nbsp;He\nshould dye his hair before they left. \n&ldquo;Was I a dick?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, Seokjin. &nbsp;A lot. \nYou two were terrible for and with and to each other. &nbsp;You know this. &nbsp;He knows this. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ve been over this. &nbsp;Why the renewed interest?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Just what Y/N said, about how I\nshould apologize to him.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Jin,&rdquo; Namjoon said seriously,\nrising up to stare down at Seokjin. &nbsp;Some\nof Namjoon&rsquo;s stares Seokjin loved. &nbsp;He\nloved when Namjoon would get all soft-eyed when he looked at him. &nbsp;He would stare like no one would notice. &nbsp;He blinked slowly as if he didn&rsquo;t want to\nmiss anything Seokjin did. &nbsp;He would get\nserious and stare when he wanted to pay attention and let Seokjin know he\nmattered. &nbsp;He would sometimes, though,\ngive Seokjin a look that Seokjin knew all too well. &nbsp;It was the\nyou-know-you&rsquo;re-wrong-but-I-think-you&rsquo;re-capable-of-admitting-it-yourself-before-I-tell-you\nlook. &nbsp;Seokjin wasn&rsquo;t a fan of this one. &nbsp;It made him squirm and groan and grow\nembarrassed and a little bit angry even if Namjoon was right.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You never apologized?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember saying any of\nthat! &nbsp;It was years ago!&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Jin. &nbsp;Jin,&rdquo; Namjoon said softer. &nbsp;Seokjin risked looking at him, and thankfully\nthe look was gone, replaced by something a little sadder. &nbsp;&ldquo;You know how Yoongi never forgets, like,\nanything.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Unfortunately, I do.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;So, if you remembered, would you\napologize? &nbsp;If you could, would you say\nit again?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Then apologize.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Even if&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Even if,&rdquo; Namjoon said, putting his\nhead back on his own pillow and pulling Seokjin into his chest. &nbsp;He let himself be moved until no one&rsquo;s arm\nwas being slept on and felt himself grow sleepy again as they both settled\ndown. &nbsp;Still, he waited until Namjoon&rsquo;s\nlittle snores rumbled through his chest again before he closed his own eyes,\nalready running the conversation with Yoongi over and over in his head. &nbsp;There was no way to come out on top of it,\nbut Seokjin never really cared about beating Yoongi or being better than\nhim. &nbsp;He already knew, in many ways, that\nhe was. &nbsp;In other ways, Yoongi would\nalways be superior. &nbsp;Seokjin could admit\nthat. &nbsp;He could admit that he was wrong,\ntoo. &nbsp;And if that helped Yoongi to be\nhappy, truly happy, happy like he never was with Seokjin, then Seokjin was more\nthan willing to help that happen.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hoseok sometimes felt bad for his\nneighbors. &nbsp;He wasn&rsquo;t exactly what one\nmight call a quiet person, but he figured that his positive energy and friendliness\nbalanced out. &nbsp;Everyone knew him even if\nhe couldn&rsquo;t remember their names, and on more than one occasion someone had\nknocked on his door asking for help to move something or find a cat or &ldquo;borrow&rdquo;\nsugar or something, and he was always more than happy to oblige. &nbsp;So he didn&rsquo;t feel an ounce of remorse as he\nand Tae tramped up the stairs as loud as a horde of elephants. &nbsp;He wasn&rsquo;t ashamed at how they were laughing\nas loud as hyenas, either, as they stumbled into the walls while he fumbled to\nopen his door as Tae leaned on him and tried to catch his breath.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To the untrained eye, the pair would\nsurely look drunk. &nbsp;And Hoseok felt a little\nlightheaded, but, not to be cheesy or anything, he was just high on\nhappiness. &nbsp;Not high. &nbsp;That word made him think of actually getting\nhigh, which he had only done once, or, tried to do, but had promptly fallen\nasleep after taking one hit. &nbsp;So, not high,\nas he didn&rsquo;t know what that felt like, but light, floaty, almost, like he could\njust fly away by how carefree he felt. \nWhich is saying something, because Hoseok is almost always\ncarefree. &nbsp;But tonight, tonight, he&rsquo;s\njust, he&rsquo;s just. &nbsp;He doesn&rsquo;t know. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s happy. \nThat&rsquo;s all.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Happy, to see his best friend so\nhappy, happy, to see how two lives can merge together, happy, to know everything\nwas only going to get better from here, happy, to have Tae coming home with\nhim.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was happy at how Tae had changed\nsince they actually started talking about their relationship more&mdash;I know, what\na concept, doi. &nbsp;He was happy by how much\ncloser they obviously were because of it&mdash;wow, who would have thought talking\ncould do that? &nbsp;He was happy with finding\nlittle bits of Tae all around his apartment, even if he usually liked keeping\nthings extremely clean. &nbsp;He was happy with\nthe way Tae was catching onto his mood and he was getting better at reading\nTae&rsquo;s. &nbsp;He was happy that they could\ntouch, and did touch, almost all the time wherever they went. &nbsp;He was happy to know Tae didn&rsquo;t shy away from\nsuch displays and actually wanted them himself. \nHe was happy, even if he would never by the man&rsquo;s soulmate, to be with\nhim.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And, if he was forced to admit it,\nhe was happy with the sex, okay? &nbsp;It was\nintense in all the right ways. &nbsp;Tae was\nintense. &nbsp;He sometimes got this look on\nhis face that almost scared Hoseok, and he had jumped and screamed a little in\nsurprise&mdash;he&rsquo;s man enough to admit&mdash;on more than one occasion when Tae randomly\nbit him or spanked him without any precursor. \nAnd he had gone still, too, which is pretty impressive considering how\nmuch he is always moving, more than once when Tae suddenly touched him like he\nwas made of glass or whispered so softly in his ear how much he loved him. &nbsp;He loved those moments, all of those moments,\nbecause, if nothing else, Tae kept Hoseok on his toes, and even if he thought\nhe had seen and heard everything from the man, he continued to be surprised and\nimpressed.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The first time Tae had said &ldquo;I love\nhim,&rdquo; though, Hoseok hadn&rsquo;t necessarily reacted as one might hope or\nexpect. &nbsp;He&rsquo;d, well, uh, accidentally\nflailed a bit and elbowed Tae so hard in the ribs he had a bruise the next day. &nbsp;There had been a lot of squawking, if Hoseok\nremembers correctly, and profuse apologizing even though Tae laughed it off\nlike he did most things. &nbsp;In hindsight,\nHoseok has been able to laugh about it, too, and is fine with Tae teasing him\nover and over again by warning him beforehand he&rsquo;s going to say it or covering\nhis chest awkwardly and obviously before he says it. &nbsp;It never seems to take anything away from the\nmoment, though. &nbsp;Love, in Hoseok&rsquo;s mind,\nis often too serious. &nbsp;Or people try to\nmake it so. &nbsp;The movies have an epic\nswell in the music when someone finally confesses. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s pouring down torrential rain as if it&rsquo;s\nsuddenly a life or death situation. &nbsp;The\nwords are said and suddenly everyone is crying and gnashing their teeth and\npulling out their hair because finally, finally someone loves meeeeee!</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Love should be carefree. &nbsp;Light. \nHappy. &nbsp;Hilarious. &nbsp;And full of awkward human moments. &nbsp;So Hoseok loved how much Tae and he laughed even\nwhen trying to lose themselves in the throes of passion. &nbsp;He loved how gross morning breath was when\nthey kissed. &nbsp;He loved how Tae would\nsputter when Hoseok introduced him as his boyfriend to random strangers who\ndefinitely did not ask. &nbsp;He loved how\nthey still fumbled to undress each other and laughed when one of them tried to\nbe &ldquo;too sexy&rdquo; and couldn&rsquo;t stay in character for whatever nonsense they had\nplanned. &nbsp;He loved that they were\nfiguring each other out, what they liked and disliked, what they needed and\nwanted, what they preferred and could endure. \nHe loved each opportunity to get to know Tae more and to grow closer to\nhim, and he knew Tae felt the same.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So, stumbling into his apartment and\nkicking off their shoes&mdash;that he would fix later into neat little rows when he\ngot up to pee or get a glass of water or something because he&rsquo;s not OCD but\nshit, there&rsquo;s no need to be so flippant when it comes to a little order in\none&rsquo;s house&mdash;really felt like coming home. \nPulling on each other&rsquo;s belt loops and smashing a little too hard into\nthe kitchen counter on the way to the bedroom so Tae could suck on Hoseok&rsquo;s\nneck&mdash;an action that sounds ridiculous and even humorous, as Hoseok first\nthought, too, as he laughed when he tilted his head back, but, as always, he\nstarted to get warm and wanted to pull Tae closer the second his lips were on\nhim&mdash;was commonplace, so much so that Hoseok never left anything glass on any\ncountertops or tables anymore for fear of breaking something in the middle of making\nout. &nbsp;Trying to race each other to the\nbedroom and see who could undress the other first&mdash;Hoseok always, always won,\nand he&rsquo;d like to think he&rsquo;s just that good with his hands, but Tae seemed to\nlet him win every time because Hoseok had figured out that secretly Tae like\nhaving someone else peel his shirt off and pull his pants down and leave him\nthere to shiver for a few seconds&mdash;seemed like second nature at this point.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And, on most nights, pulling each\nother into bed and roaming all over each other and never letting the other go\nwould be expected. &nbsp;It was hard to resist\neach other when they were in full display for the other, standing or sitting or\nlying there in waiting, inches and inches of tan skin waiting to be touched and\nkissed, to be worshiped and loved. &nbsp;It\nwas what Hoseok expected, even, because something about going to a wedding\nalways made him remember how much he loved love, and he loved Tae. &nbsp;He told him as often as he could. &nbsp;Loved how Tae seemed to have no trouble\nsaying it to him but still blushed a little when Hoseok reciprocated. &nbsp;So to take him to bed and, as someone more\ncrass might say, have his way with him, seemed like the most viable option,\nlike the right choice.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nBut\nhe slowed down once Tae was naked before him. \nThey were always too busy to be bothered with any lights, but even in\nthe darkness, Hoseok could see him. &nbsp;He\nknew how strong he was beneath his soft layer of skin. &nbsp;He knew how kind he was even when he had a\nmischievous glint in his eye. &nbsp;He knew\nhow hard he worked to help others and yet how much he loved, at the end of the\nday, when he was tired or overwhelmed, being taken care of.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And Hoseok didn&rsquo;t know, could never\nknow, what it must be like to see your soulmate get married to someone\nelse. &nbsp;If Tae and Jimin were anyone else,\nhe figured it would have broken Tae. &nbsp;So\neven though he knew the two soulmates loved each other, and he knew Tae supported\nJimin and always would, he imagined Tae might be a little hurt even with how\nmuch he smiled and danced and laughed at the wedding. &nbsp;He knew he might be feeling a little lost and\nleft out and inadequate and lonely and incomplete and hopeless and scared and\nworried about his own future. &nbsp;He might,\njust might, if Hoseok is feeling extra brave to consider, have been looking to\nHoseok so much the whole day for reassurance. \nHe might have been watching him to try to catch a glimpse of something,\nsome spark of hope that one day it might be them getting married. &nbsp;And Hoseok would be damned if he wasn&rsquo;t going\nto do everything he could to make sure Tae had nothing to worry about, to make\nsure he knew he was loved and valued and appreciated and enough, more than\nenough.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take care of you,&rdquo;\nHoseok said firmly even though it came out as a whisper. &nbsp;It must have surprised Tae, whether because\nhe always seemed a little surprised when Hoseok said such words or because the\nchange in speed and volume of everything gave him a little whiplash, because he\ngrew still and quiet, so Hoseok waited as he took his hand until Tae nodded\nbefore leading him to the bathroom. &nbsp;He\nsmiled at him as Tae stood with his hands in front of him, waiting while Hoseok\nfilled up the bathtub until he got cold or couldn&rsquo;t wait any longer and wrapped\nhimself around Hoseok, leaning against his back while the sound of water\nrushing calmed him down. &nbsp;He went\nwillingly once Hoseok helped him step in and watched with not an eager or\nexcited eye but a look of admiration and appreciation as Hoseok finished\nundressing to get in behind him. &nbsp;He\nmelted a little into Hoseok&rsquo;s chest and a little more as Hoseok ran his hands\nall over him, but Hoseok didn&rsquo;t feel any less light or carefree or, for lack of\na better word, high. &nbsp;If anything, he\nfelt more-so. &nbsp;The more Tae relaxed into\nhim, he more at ease he felt. &nbsp;They fit\ntogether perfectly even if they weren&rsquo;t &ldquo;destined&rdquo; to be. &nbsp;And since there was no hurry, because Hoseok\nwas going to be there when Tae woke up in the morning, he was going to be there\neven when Tae lost his cool a little and got impatient and snapped at him over something\nminor, he was going to be there even when Tae needed his soulmate more than he\nneeded a boyfriend, Hoseok took his time on Tae.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He washed him carefully, making sure\nto get off all of the smells that didn&rsquo;t belong to him. &nbsp;That weird Aunt Sally and friend-of-a-friend\nwho had danced a little too closely and someone&rsquo;s cigarette smell and something\nelse Hoseok couldn&rsquo;t pinpoint that definitely wasn&rsquo;t Tae or him&mdash;or Jimin or\nJungkook or Y/N or Yoongi, the only other smells he would allow. &nbsp;Tonight, he wanted Tae to smell like Tae, and\na little like him, because he&rsquo;s a human with a tiny trace of possessiveness in\nhim as we all have. &nbsp;Hoseok wants him to\nknow that he&rsquo;s his. &nbsp;So he washed him\ncarefully and completely, and he patted him dry and wrapped him up in his\nsoftest robe that Tae had once made fun of but now tried to steal every time he\nwas over. &nbsp;And he held him before they\ncould even brush their teeth, even before he could get either of them dressed\napart from the furry robe, and just let them breathe together, closing their\neyes before sleep came. &nbsp;Eventually, he\nhelped Tae get dressed in Hoseok&rsquo;s flannel pants and into bed where he slid in\nnext to him and pulled him close and just stared at him until Tae&rsquo;s eyelids\nstarted to flutter. &nbsp;He kissed him,\nthen. &nbsp;On his hair and forehead and cheek\nand chin and nose and eyelashes and temple and knuckles and neck and chest and\nribcage and stomach and collarbone and everywhere he could reach, saving his\nlips for last. &nbsp;He took his time. &nbsp;There was no hurry. &nbsp;No rush. \n</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He would kiss Tae until he fell\nasleep, and Hoseok would keep kissing him until he fell asleep himself.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ducking out of one&rsquo;s own wedding may\nbe a little frowned on, but Jimin had moved past what other people thought\nyears ago. &nbsp;Besides, they had only\ninvited people who wouldn&rsquo;t be so judgmental and petty, and everyone was still\nhaving plenty of fun when he pulled Jungkook away. &nbsp;It hadn&rsquo;t taken long to read Jungkook&rsquo;s\nuncomfortable cues, anyway, and he had learned early on that Jungkook was an\nintrovert unlike himself and Tae and Hoseok. \nHonestly, he was surprised the boy could keep up with the three of them\nso well, but he supposes it was just a testament to how much he liked them\nall. &nbsp;Still, Jimin could tell when his\nsmiles shifted from genuine happiness to politeness, and that was when he knew it\nwas time to go. &nbsp;He had kept the boy as\nclose as possible all night if only to give them some semblance of their own\npersonal bubble when really everyone wanted to be in their space. &nbsp;It was to expected; you invite people to a\nwedding to share the experience with them, but Jimin could tell Jungkook was\ngetting exhausted, and even though the boy protested, actually daring to\ncomplain about proper decorum or some ridiculous shit no eighteen-year-old would\nnormally say, Jimin dragged him out, anyway.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was flushed from dancing or from\nhappiness or from embarrassment, Jimin wasn&rsquo;t quite sure, but either way the\nboy looked good, and he was his now. &nbsp;The\nidea made him pause and consider the boy sitting so close to him in the car on\ntheir way home. &nbsp;Jungkook had the ability\nto be giggly and breathtaking one moment and teasing and sultry the next, and\nif Jimin wasn&rsquo;t so confidence in himself, it might confuse and intimidate him,\nbut it only made him feel more endeared to the boy. &nbsp;He hadn&rsquo;t ever felt like a very possessive\nperson; protective, yes, fiercely so, but having Tae as a soulmate had always\nmeant he shared everything he could with everyone he could. &nbsp;It was simply their nature, and Tae brought out\na side in him that made him want to simply give and give to others as much as\nhe could. &nbsp;So the idea of having someone\nto himself, even though he knew he didn&rsquo;t own Jungkook, it was nothing like that,\nwas new and, frankly, a little overwhelming. \nHe had fleeting thoughts of Tae throughout the ceremony and even now,\nthoughts he had to gently push aside. &nbsp;He\nwas doing nothing wrong, and while he and Tae could share Jungkook in other\nways, now wasn&rsquo;t the time for that. &nbsp;He\nwas to have Jungkook like Tae never could, like Hoseok never could, like no one\nelse ever had and no one else ever could.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Jungkook,&rdquo; he found himself saying,\nsuddenly overwhelmed with the thought. &nbsp;He\nknew the boy was nervous even if he wanted it. \nAnd for weeks Jimin hadn&rsquo;t been nervous but had wanted to wait. &nbsp;He couldn&rsquo;t let Jungkook know he was nervous\nnow for fear that the boy would misread his hesitation as repulsion or a lack\nof desire. &nbsp;If anything, he simply wasn&rsquo;t\nsure how to handle how much he wanted the boy. \nHe wanted him to laugh and smile and squirm and moan and sigh and\nbeg. &nbsp;He wanted all of him, whatever that\nlooked and felt and sounded and smelled like.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And the boy just looked at him,\nsweetly and expectantly with a touch of anxiety that Jimin wanted to kiss\naway. &nbsp;So he did.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And Jimin was used to being\ngraceful. &nbsp;Tae had always been a little\nclumsy, had fumbled and gotten overly excited and eager the few times they had\ndone anything that crossed the border of platonic friends, but Jimin had always\nbeen calm and collected, cool and in charge. \nIt was expected of him, as a dancer, in some way, to remember how to\nbreathe and know the placement of his hands, to remember the moves, of when to\npush and when to pull, of when to go fast and when to go slow, so while he stumbled\nup the stairs and stumbled into their apartment as Jungkook clung to him and\ntried to wrestle him out of his clothes, he regained his composure once they\nmade it to their room that was definitely theirs now, no longer just Jimin&rsquo;s. &nbsp;Jungkook seemed to be seeping into Jimin&rsquo;s\nspace and Jimin&rsquo;s being already, and if the desperate noises coming from\nJungkook&rsquo;s mouth were any indication of how effected he was, too, then Jimin\nknew the boy just wanted to be close to Jimin as much as possible. &nbsp;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Still, he found it in himself to\nslow down, to hold the boy, to touch him all over.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Jungkook, Jungkook,&rdquo; he said somewhere\nbetween their shirts on and their skin bare. \n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m yours.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m yours,&rdquo; Jungkook almost\nwhined back, capturing Jimin&rsquo;s lips to shut him up, but Jimin wasn&rsquo;t done, so\nhe let the boy kiss him for a moment before pulling him back.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Now and always,&rdquo; he said seriously,\nstaring into the boy&rsquo;s eyes. &nbsp;Jungkook&rsquo;s\neyes were wide but they softened a little as he stared back at Jimin, repeating\nthe words he might as well have tattooed on his brain by this point.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;No matter what the world says.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Until the world ends,&rdquo; Jimin\ncontinued.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Or my soul stops,&rdquo; Jungkook\nbreathed, taking a deep breath and resting his forehead against Jimin&rsquo;s.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You have me now and forever,&rdquo; Jimin\nsaid, trying to sooth him while touching him all over all at the same\ntime. &nbsp;&ldquo;So there&rsquo;s no hurry. &nbsp;You love me? &nbsp;You trust me?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; Jungkook almost\nsobbed. &nbsp;&ldquo;I trust you. &nbsp;Now touch me.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Calm down,&rdquo; Jimin almost laughed,\nbut he touched Jungkook, anyway. &nbsp;He was\ntouching him, and he would keep touching him. \nHe could touch him anywhere now, so he would. &nbsp;&ldquo;We have all night. &nbsp;We have all our lives.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s real nice,&rdquo; Jungkook sighed\nagain before grabbing Jimin again. &nbsp;&ldquo;But\nI want you right now.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Jimin laughed, pushing the\nboy back onto their bed and climbing over him even as he peeled off his pants\nand followed with his own. &nbsp;&ldquo;You have\nme. &nbsp;Now and always, okay?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Jungkook whispered, staring\nup at Jimin. &nbsp;He had a bit of nervousness\nleft in him, something easily read as a desire to please and do well. &nbsp;Jimin had no doubts he would. &nbsp;The kid was annoying good at everything he\nset his mind to, and while Jimin might have the upper hand tonight for the boy&rsquo;s\nfirst time, he had no doubt that Jungkook would be a fast learner and would be\ngiving Jimin a run for his money in no time. \nFor now, Jimin was going to savor how eager and willing he was. &nbsp;He was going to take his time, spend as much\ntime as Jungkook could stand, was going to test his patience and stamina. &nbsp;And it would take time, to learn what\nJungkook liked and didn&rsquo;t like, but Jimin could be patient, clearly more patient\nthan Jungkook could be. &nbsp;He would learn\nwhat made the boy preen and blush, and he would enjoy every second of it.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Jungkook,&rdquo; he said, trying to keep\nhis voice steady when he just wanted to laugh and blow raspberries all over his\nhardened stomach, &ldquo;husband.&rdquo; &nbsp;Jungkook&rsquo;s\nbreath hitched a little at that, which made Jimin smile wider. &nbsp;&ldquo;Mine,&rdquo; he whispered, watching Jungkook nod\nand reach for him. &nbsp;&ldquo;Love,&rdquo; he tried,\nsmiling even more when Jungkook closed his eyes for a second before opening\nthem, his pupils wide and glistening.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Soulmate,&rdquo; Jungkook said firmly and\ndecisively, pulling Jimin down until he was almost being squished. &nbsp;He mouthed at Jimin&rsquo;s earrings and the side\nof his neck, anything he could reach until Jimin pushed himself off and\nproperly kissed him. &nbsp;&ldquo;Please,&rdquo; the boy\nmanaged when Jimin left his lips again to make his way down his body. &nbsp;Jimin knew Jungkook could be a brat, so his\npoliteness was sure to fade if Jimin tested him much longer. &nbsp;He decided to go easy on him for now. &nbsp;He would probably go easy on him the rest of\ntheir lives, if he was honest. &nbsp;He&rsquo;d give\nand give and give anything and everything that Jungkook needed or wanted. &nbsp;For now, that was himself, as much and as quickly\nas possible. &nbsp;So, with one final kiss to\nJungkook&rsquo;s navel that made the boy twitch a little under him and made Jimin\nsmirk a little above him, he gave the boy what he wanted, but moreover, he gave\nhim what he needed.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Relationships, like life, have many\nstages. &nbsp;The infancy, with fleeting\nglances and blushing cheeks and stammered confessions and thumping hearts and\nsweaty palms. &nbsp;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nThe\nchildhood, of whispered secrets and loud laughter and shared interests. &nbsp;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nAdolescence,\nthe wild abandonment and wild dreams and stolen kisses and promises made. &nbsp;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nAdulthood,\nwhen things became serious and mature, the settling down, the label and symbols\nof love, the inability to keep your hands off of each other, the desire to show\nthem off and declare your love to everyone you met, the swelling of hearts like\nnothing else, the belief that nothing could go wrong, that everything was\nperfect. &nbsp;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nAnd\nmiddle age, when things either grew boring or you settled into a pleasant rhythm. &nbsp;When the mundane and monotony of living together\nand knowing what the other was thinking or doing without even needing to communicate\nbrought despair or contentment. &nbsp;When\nsimply being with the other was enough or wasn&rsquo;t. &nbsp;The time when a crisis happened or the last\npush toward peace and security for the rest of your life settled in. &nbsp;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nAnd,\nunfortunately for some, death, the end of everything you once held dear and\nthought would never end. &nbsp;The uncomfortable\nsilences and broken hearts and prolonged absences that turned bitter until they\nburnt. &nbsp;You had never experienced such a\nstage in any relationship and hoped you never would. &nbsp;You knew Yoongi had, though, and you wondered,\nthough the idea was quickly squashed, if he was thinking about if things would\never end that way for him again. &nbsp;They\nwouldn&rsquo;t, because you weren&rsquo;t Jin or anyone else. &nbsp;You weren&rsquo;t just somebody for him. &nbsp;You weren&rsquo;t sure what stage your relationship\nwas in with Yoongi, but whatever it was made you feel alive and terrified all\nat the same time. &nbsp;He seemed to continue\nto have that effect on you. &nbsp;You wanted\nmore and yet were afraid of taking too much, of taking something that wasn&rsquo;t\nyours. &nbsp;Even if you knew deep down that\nhe was yours, even if you had spoken those very words out loud before,\nsomething still held you back. &nbsp;You\nwondered, after listening to Jimin and Jungkook make promises to each other to\ncomplete each other and be there for each other, if you could fully give\nyourself to Yoongi while feeling like he would never fully be yours.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nPerhaps\nthere was no reason to ask that question, because you already knew the answer,\nbut you were determined to try. &nbsp;You were\ninsistent on trying to prove to him, to show him, to make him believe you and\ntrust you. &nbsp;Your actions and words hadn&rsquo;t\nbeen as clear as his had been, and you didn&rsquo;t want him to have any doubts that\nyou wanted to stick around, that you wanted to be with him and by him and as\nclose to him as possible.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nIf\nthat was pathetic, then Yoongi was right, and you were pathetic for him, but he\nmerely had to look at you for know that he was gone for you, too. &nbsp;So you tried to push aside all of your\ninsecurities and invasive thoughts that weren&rsquo;t of Yoongi and Yoongi only as\nyou got back home.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nIt\nwas home. &nbsp;Some part of you knew this and\nbelieved this. &nbsp;Felt it to be true as you\ntoed off your shoes to pick up and carry to the closet as Yoongi went to get a\ncouple of glasses of water. &nbsp;You knew his\nplace was home by the flowers that always seemed new in the vases spread around\nthe house. &nbsp;They were, if nothing else,\nthe answer for your earlier question. \nBecause flowers, like relationships, also go through the stages of\nlife. &nbsp;And the jasmine scattered throughout\nYoongi&rsquo;s house were always thriving. &nbsp;You\nnever saw one of them wilt or die. &nbsp;You\nknew they had to; there was nothing magical about them. &nbsp;But Yoongi never let them got to that point,\nor at least never let you see them. &nbsp;And\nit was almost silly, really, you, who worked in a flower shop and knew every\nname of every flower and every meaning behind them, to step into Yoongi&rsquo;s room\nthat was now also yours and to stop and simply stare at the flowers by his bed,\nfinally realizing where the two of you stood.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nIt\nshould have been easy, then, to turn around and just tell him or show him when\nhe came into the room and looked at you just standing there, but you felt like\nyou could barely breathe much less speak or make sense of whatever you were\nfeeling. &nbsp;Perhaps you were getting easy\nto read, or Yoongi was always that intuitive or aware of what you needed before\nyou had even acknowledged him, because he put the glasses down and reached\ntentatively for your hand, tugging you toward the bathroom with no sense of urgency.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Brush,\nwash,&rdquo; he said, handing you your toothbrush as he proceeded to do the same, his\neyes barely leaving you in the mirror as he did. &nbsp;You watched as he brushed his teeth, rinsed,\nand spit before you even moved to do the same, blinking away your stupor that\nhe might be registering as sleepiness. \nYou felt anything but sleepy, though. \nYou felt wired and jittery, twitchy, even, and your fingers were shaking\na bit as you tried to brush. &nbsp;By the time\nyou finally were done, you stood up to Yoongi holding a face wipe in front of\nyou, and you closed your eyes for him to step close and do it for you. &nbsp;You couldn&rsquo;t help grabbing onto his wrist,\nthe contact alone making you sigh and calm down a little as he pressed gently\nbut firmly around your eyes and cheeks to remove your makeup, more than you\nwere certainly used to wearing. &nbsp;When his\nhand left you, you opened your eyes to see his face much closer than it was\nbefore, and you scooted a little closer, wanting to simply melt into him, but\nhis hand came back to your cheek to steady you, and you kept your eyes open to\nlook up at him even though it was difficult. \nYour eyelashes kept flickering, and your eyes seemed to be blurry and\nunable to focus, but all you wanted to do was look at Yoongi looking at\nyou. &nbsp;You needed to watch him watching\nyou. &nbsp;You had to see the way he looked at\nyou, because no one else looked at you like that. &nbsp;No one else ever had, and no one else ever\nwould, surely.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Yoongi,&rdquo;\nyou managed to say as his thumb and fingers glided across your face and\nneck. &nbsp;He just continued, his eyes never\nleaving yours until you practically nuzzled his hand, breaking eye contact with\nhim only to kiss his palm once before looking back up at him. &nbsp;&ldquo;Please.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Can\nI?&rdquo; he said, even though he didn&rsquo;t need to. \nStill, the question made you move, pulling on his belt loops as you\nnodded. &nbsp;No one had ever asked before,\nand even though he could probably read your mind at this point and must surely know\nwhat you wanted and needed more than anyone else ever could or ever would, he\nhad still asked. &nbsp;You could laugh at him\nlater, because kissing for the first time in a bathroom didn&rsquo;t sound much\nbetter than kissing in an elevator, but Yoongi had been right. &nbsp;There was really nothing to compare. &nbsp;You weren&rsquo;t sure if you had expected to\nliterally melt or explode, so you were glad neither of those happened. &nbsp;You were glad you didn&rsquo;t start shaking more\nto the point of throwing up or itching to the point where you would bleed if\nyou scratched too hard. &nbsp;You were glad\nyou only melted a little as your lips merged together. &nbsp;You were glad you only shook a little when\nyou felt his fingers twitching against you before they pressed into your\nskin. &nbsp;You were glad, and glad couldn&rsquo;t\neven begin to describe it&mdash;relieved? Grateful? Satisfied?&mdash;when Yoongi finally\nkissed you.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nLike\neverything else he did, he moved slowly but surely. &nbsp;Once he knew he had permission, he didn&rsquo;t hesitate. &nbsp;He controlled your every movement without\nbeing forceful. &nbsp;And he left you wanting\nmore, so it felt extremely rude and unfair when he pulled away from you, laughing\nas you tried to chase him. &nbsp;He ducked\ndown to your neck, though, which didn&rsquo;t surprise you. &nbsp;He had staked his claim to that territory\nweeks ago, so it was naturally his favorite spot. &nbsp;Wanting to give to him as much as possible,\nthen, you let him until your fingers started to twitch again, itching for a\nchance to do the same to him. &nbsp;He seemed\nto notice your plight and chuckled again before taking both of your hands in\nhis and leading you back into the bedroom, flicking off the light as you went. </p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nThe\ndarkness that engulfed you was a little too much, and one of Yoongi&rsquo;s hand left\nyours to turn on the lamp that illuminated first and foremost the flowers\nunderneath them before even revealing his face.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Yoongi,&rdquo;\nyou said again, looking between the flowers and him. &nbsp;He hummed as he let go of your hands, and\nwithout even asking permission you finally started to unbutton his shirt. &nbsp;With something to do, your fingers seemed to\nhave stopped their fidgeting, and his plain but offensive shirt was soon\nundone, and he let you push it down his arms until it fluttered to the ground. &nbsp;His undershirt had to go, too, and he lifted\nhis arms easily as you tugged it up and over his head. &nbsp;You had only seen him shirtless a few times\naccidentally. &nbsp;He had always been\nextremely modest around the house, always making sure to at least have a shirt\nand shorts on around you, even though you had always figured he would prefer to\nbe wearing less clothes, especially to bed. \nYou had never really ogled at guys before. &nbsp;You hadn&rsquo;t had girl friends growing up to\ngossip about boys with or giggle and point out who you thought was hot. &nbsp;You knew Yoongi was fit and attractive, but\nhis looks had never been what made you desire him. &nbsp;It was how he acted and treated you, and,\nhonestly, how he sounded when talking to you, that made you attracted to\nhim. &nbsp;So his smooth, lean torso was\nmomentarily distracting, but it was the expanse of skin that mattered no matter\nwhat it looked like, and you splayed a hand over his chest almost\nexperimentally. &nbsp;Yoongi was not ticklish,\nyou had discovered a while ago, though he did have sharp reflexes and would\nretaliate if poked in his side surprisingly. \nSo when he barely even flinched when your fingers touched him, you weren&rsquo;t\nsurprised. &nbsp;Pleased, even, that he was\nletting you touch him. &nbsp;You figured he would\nlet you do anything to him, but still, you were used to having things done to\nyou, not the other way around. &nbsp;Exploring\nyour partner simply for the sake of exploring was a pretty foreign concept to you,\nand you could tell you were always losing your footing. &nbsp;So you did what you thought you were good at\nand went for his pants&rsquo; button and then zipper, and he let you, only stopping\nyou when you tried to pull them down his hips.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo;\nhe said softly, his voice making you stop and stand up completely. &nbsp;His pants fell on their own accord, and he stepped\nout of them before running his hand up and down your forearm. &nbsp;&ldquo;I told you I&rsquo;d be good to you, right?&rdquo; &nbsp;Nodding slowly, you felt yourself shiver,\nbecause you couldn&rsquo;t quite comprehend what he could mean. &nbsp;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n&ldquo;Let\nme just,&rdquo; he sighed, pulling you toward him and kissing you again. &nbsp;If that&rsquo;s what he meant by being good to you,\nthen he could keep doing that and you would be perfectly content and happy. &nbsp;His kisses seemed to be a distraction\ntechnique, though, and a clever one at that, because you barely noticed his\nhands unzipping your dress and pulling the material off of your shoulders and\ndown your arms until the cool air hit you, causing you to shiver again. &nbsp;You could tease him later about not even\ntaking advantage of the dress&rsquo; slip, but at the moment you had to hold onto his\nshoulders, his bare shoulders, which was a new sensation, as he moved toward\nyour neck again. &nbsp;The familiar movement\nof his nose over your delicate skin was soothing, though, and helped counter balance\nthe new sensation of his hands running all over your bare back. &nbsp;Yoongi&rsquo;s hands were soft, never calloused,\nbecause the man was the biggest softie you had ever met, and you knew Jimin and\nTae.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nIt\nfit his character, then, that he continued to move slowly and carefully all\nover you. &nbsp;That he placed himself on the\nbed first instead of pushing you down into it. \nThat he never let go of your hand and always made sure you were connected\nin some way. &nbsp;It made sense that every\nkiss he placed on every inch of skin he could reach lingered longer than the\nlast. &nbsp;That he took his time and checked\non you and listened to you and asked you constantly with his eyes or his words\nif you were okay or if you needed something. \nIt made sense that he insisted on always facing each other. &nbsp;To anyone else, he might have appeared vanilla\nor even lazy, but for you, and to you, there was nothing more intense about the\nway he looked at you, about the way he touched you, about the way he kissed\nyou. &nbsp;Good couldn&rsquo;t even begin to\ndescribe how he made you feel, and your panting breaths and curled toes and\nsweaty limbs had hardly anything to do with why, when you insisted that he had to\nstop before you cried from how overwhelmed you felt, you somehow felt even closer\nwhen he curled around you and simply held you as you fell asleep, discussing\nthe wedding and the night and what tomorrow would bring.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nIt\nwas this growing feeling inside you that even without vows, even without being\nable to smell him, Yoongi was never going to leave you or let you go, and even\nif people called you pathetic, you knew you were never going to let go of him,\neither. &nbsp;And even if you couldn&rsquo;t tell\nhim that, even if you didn&rsquo;t know how to say exactly what you were feeling,\nYoongi must have known, because he turned over and dragged you with him until\nyou were both facing his nightstand where the vase of jasmine still sat,\nglowing even in the otherwise dark room. \nIt was so much more than a mere flower, and it was so much more than a\nmere feeling that you had about Yoongi. \nStill, you knew it was only going to grow, and nothing could ever make\nit wither or fade or die.</p><hr /><p>A/N:</p><p>OKAY, FIRST!</p><p>Let me just say a few things.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t even know where to start.</p><p>Why does HOSEOK keep stealing the show?&nbsp; He is amazing.</p><p>Okay, here is <a href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3f/b5/33/3fb533fe272858de4e0204cdcfe90792.jpg\">Jimin&rsquo;s suit</a> and <a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CparoWRWAAEegX1.jpg\">Jungkook&rsquo;s</a>.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re welcome.</p><p>I decided that Jungkook&rsquo;s flower would be the peony BEFORE I even knew he was going to end up marrying Jimin.&nbsp; I swear.&nbsp; So I liked bringing it up for this chapter and explaining why the flower fit his character.&nbsp; AW.&nbsp; Boy giviing Jimin a flower?!&nbsp; UGh.&nbsp; And their vows? UGh.</p><p>Also, where my singles at?&nbsp; Is it just me, or do you also have mixed feelings about weddings?&nbsp; They can be so depressing or so exciting. I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; Lots of mixed feelings there.&nbsp; Y/N just wanted to be next to Yoongi.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What are we, 12?&rdquo;&nbsp; Seriously, these kids.</p><p>This part:&nbsp;&ldquo;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhe said so slowly and calmly and yet so clearly on the edge of\ndesperation&mdash;for what? for you? &nbsp;or for\nyou?&mdash;&rdquo; has two meanings&ndash;is he desperate for you (like he wants you) or for you (like he&rsquo;s feeling for you).&nbsp; Hopefully that makes sense.</p><p>I wanted to show our four relationships to represent the different stages of relationships, in a way.&nbsp; Seokjin and Namjoon are happily together, have been forever, are in that&nbsp;&ldquo;mundane&rdquo; part where things are purely comfortable being together.&nbsp; Hoseok and Tae are moving toward that&ndash;they&rsquo;re past the&nbsp;&ldquo;let&rsquo;s just have sex all the time&rdquo; stage and moving into real love.&nbsp; Jimin and Jungkook are literally newlyweds now, hitting their honey moon stage.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re gonna, YOU KNOW, a lot now.&nbsp; And Yoongi and Y/N are FINALLY getting their act together, admitting their feelings, talking things through, KISSING YES.&nbsp; So that&rsquo;s that.</p><p>Also, Y/N and Yoongi got so domestic, oof.&nbsp; But I think it fits their characters, like Y/N kind of explains.</p><p>I love comments etc. as always!&nbsp; Enjoy!</p></p>",

He got down on his hands and knees looking under the bed to find bottles and bottles of deodorant. He pulled them out and saw that some were empty and some had teeth marks. He grabbed one and went searching for you remembering that the game is still going on he walked to the bathroom and opened the door to see you hiding behind the shower eating the fucking Arm pit shit. He jumped into action and grabbed the bottle from your hand scolding you about how bad it is for you.</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"1\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>It was Yoongis first time being over at your house since you started dating. You guys were having a great time and it started to lead to somthing more. His hands started to roam your body and his kissing started to get heavier and deeper. When you suggested to take it to the bed. When you got there he sat up against the head board watching you climb on him straddling. As you were kissing down his neck he looked around the room creeped out with all the eyes staring at him. Hey babe he manged to say. You replied with a hmm. Can you uh hide your creepy dolls first I don&rsquo;t like them starring at my soul. You busted out laughing and got up to hide the dolls.</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"2\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>You and Hobi were at the store shopping for some stuff when you spotted chalk. You ran up and grabbed like three tubs full of chalk. Hobi just assumed that it was because you do art or something. Once you were done checking out and put the stuff in the car. You grabbed a box of chalk and started eating it. Hobi looked over and saw these and swerved off the road. Wided eye and in horror screaming. YOU DONT EAT CHALK WHAT THE FUCK. he stopped the car and yanked the chalk out of your hands and threw it 0ut the window and made a turn back to the store to return all the other chalk.</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"3\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>You forgot that you had invited your boyfriend over for dinner. So when he walked in he couldnt find you. Hes wondering around the house looking for you. When he came up on a door he&rsquo;s never been in. He knocked and said your name quietly and poked his head in to see you surrounded by stuffed animals asleep. He smiled and walked into the room and layed down next to you and wrapped you in his arms. You groggily said that he wasnt supposed to find out about this room and he just chuckled and kissed your head telling you it&rsquo;s cute and suits you. You layed your head back down and both fell asleep in a room full of stuffed animals.</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"4\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>You had knocked over a glass that shattered when Jimin jumped up and told you to step away so you dont get hurt.

Il tema dell\u2019album \u201cWings\u201d dei BTS \u00e8 stato ispirato da \u201cDemian\u201d di Hermann Hesse mentre alcune parti di \u201cLove Yourself: Tear\u201d si possono ricondurre al libro \u201cThe Magic Shop\u201d di James R. Doty. Il consenso generale \u00e8 che il titolo del prossimo album faccia riferimento a \u201cJung\u2019s Map Of The Soul\u201d di Murray Stein, libro che la Big Hit sta vendendo da parecchio tempo sul suo sito online.</p><p>Lo psicologo svizzero Carl Jung, fondatore della psicologia analitica, credeva che ci fossero quattro principali archetipi della mente umana che componessero la personalit\u00e0 di un individuo: la Persona, l\u2019Ombra, l\u2019Anima/Animus e il S\u00e9. </p><p>Jung descriveva la Persona come la nostra immagine pubblica o l\u2019immagine che presentiamo di noi stessi al mondo; la parola deriva da un termine latino che faceva riferimento alle maschere indossate dai mimi etruschi. I BTS hanno incluso le maschere in molti dei loro ultimi lavori, inclusi i video di \u201cFake Love\u201d e \u201cSingularity\u201d ma anche nel video di introduzione alla loro esibizione ai MAMA 2018. La band ha precedentemente discusso l\u2019importanza dell\u2019autenticit\u00e0 nel loro lavoro, includendo quanto vitale sia non fondere le loro identit\u00e0 di performer con le loro identit\u00e0 di essere umani. </p><p>Da qui, gli ARMY sembrano essere divisi sul numero di album che seguiranno in questa serie.</p><p>Alcuni credono che, come \u00e8 stato per la serie Love Yourself, Map of the Soul sar\u00e0 una trilogia composta da tre capitoli: Persona, S\u00e9 e Ombra (unito a Anima/Animus).</p><p>Ci sono poi coloro che credono che vi sia un qualche collegamento fra la serie \u201cLove Yourself\u201d, \u201cMap of the Soul\u201d, e pi\u00f9 nello specifico le teorie di Jung. \u201cLove Yourself: Her\u201d rappresenterebbe infatti l\u2019anima (intesa come la femminilit\u00e0 integrata negli uomini), dal momento che nei video rilasciati in concomitanza con suddetto album c\u2019erano diverse donne (a rappresentare forse gli alter-ego femminili dei membri). \u201cLove Yourself: Tear\u201d, poich\u00e9 affronta sentimenti oscuri e repressi, sarebbe invece il simbolo dell\u2019archetipo dell\u2019ombra, e in ultimo \u201cLove Yourself: Answer\u201d rappresenterebbe l\u2019io, per il suo descrivere un viaggio verso l\u2019accettazione e la consapevolezza di s\u00e9.</p><p>\u201cMap of the Soul: Persona\u201d dovrebbe, dunque, affrontare l\u2019archetipo successivo, ed essere costituito da sette album diversi, uno per ogni lettera che compone la parola [\u201cPersona\u201d].</p><p>Con questa premessa, poi, secondo le ipotesi di alcuni, ogni album potrebbe rappresentare uno dei membri del gruppo. </p><p>I fan stanno per\u00f2 creando teorie anche sulla possibile collocazione di \u201cMap of the Soul\u201d nel pi\u00f9 generale sistema della discografia dei BTS. In \u201c2 Cool 4 Skool\u201d, album di debutto del gruppo, vi \u00e8 una traccia nascosta, \u201cPath\u201d (<i>N/B: \u201cPercorso\u201d</i>), nella quale i membri parlano delle diverse vie che li hanno portati a diventare cantanti e delle paure generate dalla possibilit\u00e0 di aver scelto la carriera sbagliata. Poich\u00e9 le lettere iniziali dei titoli degli ultimi album dei BTS formano proprio la parola \u201cPath\u201d, questo potrebbe voler dire che i membri sono ormai definitivamente convinti che questa sia la strada giusta per loro. </p><p>Dal suo debutto nel 2013, il gruppo ha sempre creato musica inerente alle sfide e gioie del progressivo raggiungimento della maturit\u00e0, e l\u2019album che verr\u00e0 rilasciato ad aprile sembra adattarsi perfettamente, in quanto passo ulteriore verso la crescita, lo scendere a patti con la propria identit\u00e0 e l\u2019imparare ad amare s\u00e9 stessi, alla storyline che \u00e8 stata creata fin dall\u2019inizio\u201d. </p><p><b><i>Traduzione a cura di Bangtan Italian Channel Subs (\u00a9Cam, \u00a9CiHope, \u00a9lynch, \u00a9jimindipityR) | \u00a9Refinery29</i></b></p>",
