Did he run away after the war? Hell yes. He settled in the rowdiest and most ridiculous one-horse town he could find. Made himself right at home, he did. Nobody asked what he was doing there and he never answered when they tried. Timely had far too many strange characters of their own to bother with the washed up weaponsmith that no one had seen in three years. He would know. He\u2019s met some of them before.</p><p>Fuck you if you think he ever made anything close to another revolver. Fuck you, your family, and the horse you rode in on. Because he didn\u2019t. It took him a year in Timely before he could even think about the scene without throwing up wherever he was, and by then he\u2019d had everyone fooled well enough that they didn\u2019t question it. Who would? He was drunk.</p><p>God-Doom should chop you into tiny bits and feed you to his demon dogs if you thought Tony Stark didn\u2019t know how to use every single weapon in his arsenal, half of them hand-crafted by the man himself. There were three people who dared to go to his house when the chimney smoked for too long or the echoing gunshots woke some of the townsfolk. The deputy would always leave first, but his wife and Sheriff Rogers would stay well into the evening, and if Rogers stuck around longer than most, no one breathed a word of it.</p><p>You\u2019ve lost your wits if you believe anything Wilson Fisk and his cronies spout, but Steve\u2019s had enough. Enough of the corruption and lies, of trying to standup for what was right. There were one too many people dying of unnatural causes around here, and he\u2019d had enough of not having answers. Letting Red Wolf go was the last straw and, well, the powder keg went sky high.</p><p>People will spit on your grave if you ever say that Tony Stark didn\u2019t save Sheriff Rogers\u2019 life. Whatever strange cloth Rogers was wearing under his vest, it stopped bullets. Even if the sheriff flew backwards and jerked around. Was he bleeding? Yes. But his hand twitched as the pigs came to feast, and while Tony snarled and took on Fisk\u2019s men, the citizens of Timely quietly fished Rogers out of the trough. Dead or not, he deserved a proper send off.</p><p>You\u2019re blinder than the old Daredevil of Hell\u2019s Kitchen if you didn\u2019t see the look of pure agony on Stark\u2019s face. Bottle cast aside, he raised his hand and fired. Click-Boom. Click-Boom. Click-Boom. He wasn\u2019t the only one to shoot at Fisk\u2019s men, but he sure was the last thing they saw.</p><p>No one would blame you if you gaped openly at the sight of Natasha Barnes knocking heads around a few days later. She\u2019s a sight to behold, and some say her husband trained her in the dead of night, between the gunshots and the fall of Stark\u2019s hammer. Either way, she gets her job done.</p><p>You would be played for a fool if you ever asked Sheriff Rogers how he survived. Tony Stark would laugh and clap you on the back.

When you got the amnesia I was heartbroken that you didn\u2019t remeber me. It killed me, and I hated that that was what it took to get us together. I felt like you only loved my because I was there, and thatv when your memories would get back you would leave me. You proved me wrong. The day you said you had your memories back. You laughed your ass of that you\u2019ve been in love with me since we first met and I have to admit it was quite funny. And that waiting so long for us to finally know how much we loved each other was worth it. So Y/n Y/l/n will you marry me?\u201d<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Taglist: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWSnC5IDSBS-aq8xoC2AiBg\">@mega-trash-cringe</a></p><p><a href=\"https://marvelhoeingismyhobby.tumblr.com/post/181468541441/masterlist-avengers-one-shots-the-soulstone\">Masterlist</a></p><p>requests are open</p>",

When you got the amnesia I was heartbroken that you didn&rsquo;t remeber me. It killed me, and I hated that that was what it took to get us together. I felt like you only loved my because I was there, and thatv when your memories would get back you would leave me. You proved me wrong. The day you said you had your memories back. You laughed your ass of that you&rsquo;ve been in love with me since we first met and I have to admit it was quite funny. And that waiting so long for us to finally know how much we loved each other was worth it. So Y/n Y/l/n will you marry me?&rdquo;<br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Taglist: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWSnC5IDSBS-aq8xoC2AiBg\">@mega-trash-cringe</a></p><p><a href=\"https://marvelhoeingismyhobby.tumblr.com/post/181468541441/masterlist-avengers-one-shots-the-soulstone\">Masterlist</a></p><p>requests are open</p>",
