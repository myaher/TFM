        "answer": "<p>Nonny, how dare you physically force me to sit down and write this when I have so much else to do?? I mean, that was so rude of you&hellip;. ;)</p><p><br/></p><p>Peter\u2019s Academic Decathlon regionals are in Manhattan this\nyear. Tony schedules to have the day free of meetings and obligations a month\nbefore they even determine if Midtown is going, cause he\u2019s determined to be\nthere cheering Peter on. </p><p>The competing schools are already assembled when Tony gets\nthere at 1:30. He sees Midtown, swarming around in their gold jackets. He spots\nPeter instantly, like a magnetic pull. The kid has the camera Tony gave him\naround his neck, and he\u2019s smiling as he takes a picture of Ned and MJ messing\naround. </p><p>Tony watches him fondly for a second until people start\nnoticing him, which makes Peter notice him. Tony gives him a crooked smile and\na small wave and Peter carefully pulls away from his group of friends. </p><p>\u201cHey, Tony,\u201d he says as he walks up. \u201cThanks for coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t miss it, kiddo,\u201d Tony assures, following as Peter leads\nhim through the throng of students and parents. People stare as they pass, but\nTony ignores them, keeps a grounding hand on Peter\u2019s shoulder to remind him to\ndo the same. </p><p>Peter leads him to a seat towards the back of the\nauditorium, where Ned\u2019s and MJ\u2019s moms are. Tony smiles at them, remembering Ned\u2019s\nmom from May\u2019s funeral. </p><p>\u201cI saved a seat for you,\u201d Peter explains, gesturing to his\nragged backpack on one of the chairs.</p><p>\u201cThanks, bud,\u201d Tony says, just as a frazzled looking woman\nleans to speak into the microphone on the podium in the middle of the stage.</p><p>\u201cThe science portion of the quiz will begin in ten minutes.\nCompeting students should be backstage and checking in right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, crap,\u201d Peter exclaims, looking up and seeing MJ a few\nfeet away gesturing at him to come over. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo.\u201c Tony shoos him away. \u201cBreak a leg.\u201d</p><p>Peter shoots him another smile then hurries over to MJ, Ned\nlooking anxious over her shoulder.</p><p>MJ says something to him as Peter passes, pulling Ned along\nwith him by the arm. Then, Tony hears in a sudden lull in the noise level of\nthe auditorium, and Peter calls back, \u201cOh, hey, MJ, could you give my camera to\nmy dad?\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s mouth goes dry. He watches as Peter unslings the\nexpensive camera from around his neck and passes it to MJ before hurrying\nbackstage. Neither MJ nor Ned seemed surprised by Peter\u2019s word choice. </p><p>There are still nights when Tony replays Peter\u2019s voice in\nhis head, soft and muttered, as he said \u201cYou\u2019re a good dad.\u201d He holds onto it on\nbad days when he thinks he hurts more than he helps, when Peter trusts Maggie\nmore than him. But that hadn\u2019t been&hellip; possessive. Definitive. He hadn\u2019t been <i>Peter\u2019s </i>dad, just <i>a </i>dad. </p><p><i>My dad</i>.</p><p><i>Oh my gosh, I love\nyou,</i> Tony thinks, staring at the place where Peter had disappeared behind\nthe red velvet curtain. <i>I love you I love\nyou I love you</i>.</p><p><i>My dad. </i></p><p>A camera shutter clicking breaks him out of his thoughts.</p><p>Tony blinks, looking down and seeing MJ standing in front of\nhim, Peter\u2019s camera poised in front of her eye.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d she starts casually, seeming to adjust some\nsettings on the screen like she wasn\u2019t even paying attention to the conversation,\n\u201cI was worried, when you first adopted him. Tony Stark is known for nothing if\nnot publicity stunts.\u201d</p><p>Tony bristles. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a <i>publici\u2014\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d MJ interrupts. She snaps another picture and Tony scowls\nat her. \u201cYou did it cause you love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwitter tell you that, too?\u201d Tony asks coolly, ignoring the\nway his heart stutters at the nonchalant way she says it.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d MJ says, taking one more picture before lowering the\ncamera and looking directly at Tony for the first time. \u201cYou just did.\u201d </p><p>She tosses the camera at him and Tony catches it, his heart\nin his throat, afraid of damaging one of Peter\u2019s most prized possessions. </p><p>He wants to know what she means but doesn\u2019t want to ask. \u201cYou\u2019ve\ngot heart eyes for days, Stark,\u201d she says, shrugging in her bright gold jacket.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t know he calls you his dad?\u201d</p><p>He really hates how observant this girl is. He changes the\nsubject.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have a team to lead, Captain Jones?\u201d he asks with\na raised eyebrow. \u201cOr do you want to keep psychoanalyzing me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho says I can\u2019t do both?\u201d She offers him a crooked grin\nthat he has a feeling he\u2019s privileged to see. \u201c\u2019Captain Jones,\u2019\u201d she muses as she\nstarts walking backwards toward the stage. \u201cI like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget to take pictures,\u201d she calls over her\nshoulder. \u201cI want to see Flash\u2019s face when your son wins this for us.\u201d</p><p>Tony stares after her with he mouth open and his eyebrows\nfurrowed for a second, before shaking his head in exasperation.</p><p>He finally takes his seat on the end of the row. People seem\nto have finally lost interest in him, and Ned\u2019s mom is talking animatedly with\na man on the row in front of them, so Tony turns his attention to the camera.</p><p>The playback button is taunting him. </p><p>After a moment of hesitation, Tony turns the camera on and hits\nthe button, pulling up Peter\u2019s most recent pictures. The first one is, of\ncourse, one of the three that MJ had taken of him. </p><p>He\u2019s scowling down at her, the bad florescent lighting\nmaking the his face look paler and older than it should. He skips to the next\none, almost the same, but this time there\u2019s a fire in his eyes at the\ninsinuation that he adopted Peter for any other reason that it\u2019s <i>Peter </i>and Peter was <i>his kid</i> even before May died.</p><p>He takes a deep breath and moves on to the third. </p><p>He\u2019s staring away from the camera, his lips slightly parted\nin shock. There is adoration written into every line of his face, an open tenderness\nin his gaze that can only mean he\u2019s looking at Peter.</p><p>Tony swallows, looks subtly around him to make sure no one\u2019s\nwatching him. He looks back at the picture, his thumb hovering over the delete\nbutton. </p><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen, please welcome the Academic Decathlon\nregional finalists participating in the science quiz portion to the stage.\u201d</p><p>Tony jumps, looking up at the stage as kids start filing out\nand taking their seats. Peter\u2019s the seventh kid to walk out, his curls extra\nruffled like he\u2019s been running his hands through it in his nerves.</p><p>Tony hesitates for one more second before turning the camera\noff, the picture still sitting on the memory card. He claps for his kid,\ngrinning when Peter\u2019s eyes find him from the stage.</p><p><i>I love you</i>, he\nthinks again.

Tony schedules to have the day free of meetings and obligations a month\nbefore they even determine if Midtown is going, cause he\u2019s determined to be\nthere cheering Peter on. </p><p>The competing schools are already assembled when Tony gets\nthere at 1:30. He sees Midtown, swarming around in their gold jackets. He spots\nPeter instantly, like a magnetic pull. The kid has the camera Tony gave him\naround his neck, and he\u2019s smiling as he takes a picture of Ned and MJ messing\naround. </p><p>Tony watches him fondly for a second until people start\nnoticing him, which makes Peter notice him. Tony gives him a crooked smile and\na small wave and Peter carefully pulls away from his group of friends. </p><p>\u201cHey, Tony,\u201d he says as he walks up. \u201cThanks for coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t miss it, kiddo,\u201d Tony assures, following as Peter leads\nhim through the throng of students and parents.

He watches as Peter unslings the\nexpensive camera from around his neck and passes it to MJ before hurrying\nbackstage. Neither MJ nor Ned seemed surprised by Peter\u2019s word choice. </p><p>There are still nights when Tony replays Peter\u2019s voice in\nhis head, soft and muttered, as he said \u201cYou\u2019re a good dad.\u201d He holds onto it on\nbad days when he thinks he hurts more than he helps, when Peter trusts Maggie\nmore than him.

There is adoration written into every line of his face, an open tenderness\nin his gaze that can only mean he\u2019s looking at Peter.</p><p>Tony swallows, looks subtly around him to make sure no one\u2019s\nwatching him.

                "content": "<p>Nonny, how dare you physically force me to sit down and write this when I have so much else to do?? I mean, that was so rude of you&hellip;. ;)</p><p><br /></p><p>Peter&rsquo;s Academic Decathlon regionals are in Manhattan this\nyear. Tony schedules to have the day free of meetings and obligations a month\nbefore they even determine if Midtown is going, cause he&rsquo;s determined to be\nthere cheering Peter on. </p><p>The competing schools are already assembled when Tony gets\nthere at 1:30. He sees Midtown, swarming around in their gold jackets. He spots\nPeter instantly, like a magnetic pull. The kid has the camera Tony gave him\naround his neck, and he&rsquo;s smiling as he takes a picture of Ned and MJ messing\naround. </p><p>Tony watches him fondly for a second until people start\nnoticing him, which makes Peter notice him. Tony gives him a crooked smile and\na small wave and Peter carefully pulls away from his group of friends. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Tony,&rdquo; he says as he walks up. &ldquo;Thanks for coming.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t miss it, kiddo,&rdquo; Tony assures, following as Peter leads\nhim through the throng of students and parents. People stare as they pass, but\nTony ignores them, keeps a grounding hand on Peter&rsquo;s shoulder to remind him to\ndo the same. </p><p>Peter leads him to a seat towards the back of the\nauditorium, where Ned&rsquo;s and MJ&rsquo;s moms are. Tony smiles at them, remembering Ned&rsquo;s\nmom from May&rsquo;s funeral. </p><p>&ldquo;I saved a seat for you,&rdquo; Peter explains, gesturing to his\nragged backpack on one of the chairs.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, bud,&rdquo; Tony says, just as a frazzled looking woman\nleans to speak into the microphone on the podium in the middle of the stage.</p><p>&ldquo;The science portion of the quiz will begin in ten minutes.\nCompeting students should be backstage and checking in right now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, crap,&rdquo; Peter exclaims, looking up and seeing MJ a few\nfeet away gesturing at him to come over. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to go.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Go.&ldquo; Tony shoos him away. &ldquo;Break a leg.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter shoots him another smile then hurries over to MJ, Ned\nlooking anxious over her shoulder.</p><p>MJ says something to him as Peter passes, pulling Ned along\nwith him by the arm. Then, Tony hears in a sudden lull in the noise level of\nthe auditorium, and Peter calls back, &ldquo;Oh, hey, MJ, could you give my camera to\nmy dad?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s mouth goes dry. He watches as Peter unslings the\nexpensive camera from around his neck and passes it to MJ before hurrying\nbackstage. Neither MJ nor Ned seemed surprised by Peter&rsquo;s word choice. </p><p>There are still nights when Tony replays Peter&rsquo;s voice in\nhis head, soft and muttered, as he said &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good dad.&rdquo; He holds onto it on\nbad days when he thinks he hurts more than he helps, when Peter trusts Maggie\nmore than him. But that hadn&rsquo;t been&hellip; possessive. Definitive. He hadn&rsquo;t been <i>Peter&rsquo;s </i>dad, just <i>a </i>dad. </p><p><i>My dad</i>.</p><p><i>Oh my gosh, I love\nyou,</i> Tony thinks, staring at the place where Peter had disappeared behind\nthe red velvet curtain. <i>I love you I love\nyou I love you</i>.</p><p><i>My dad. </i></p><p>A camera shutter clicking breaks him out of his thoughts.</p><p>Tony blinks, looking down and seeing MJ standing in front of\nhim, Peter&rsquo;s camera poised in front of her eye.</p><p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; she starts casually, seeming to adjust some\nsettings on the screen like she wasn&rsquo;t even paying attention to the conversation,\n&ldquo;I was worried, when you first adopted him. Tony Stark is known for nothing if\nnot publicity stunts.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony bristles. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t a <i>publici&mdash;&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; MJ interrupts. She snaps another picture and Tony scowls\nat her. &ldquo;You did it cause you love him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Twitter tell you that, too?&rdquo; Tony asks coolly, ignoring the\nway his heart stutters at the nonchalant way she says it.</p><p>&ldquo;Nope,&rdquo; MJ says, taking one more picture before lowering the\ncamera and looking directly at Tony for the first time. &ldquo;You just did.&rdquo; </p><p>She tosses the camera at him and Tony catches it, his heart\nin his throat, afraid of damaging one of Peter&rsquo;s most prized possessions. </p><p>He wants to know what she means but doesn&rsquo;t want to ask. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve\ngot heart eyes for days, Stark,&rdquo; she says, shrugging in her bright gold jacket.\n&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t know he calls you his dad?&rdquo;</p><p>He really hates how observant this girl is. He changes the\nsubject.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you have a team to lead, Captain Jones?&rdquo; he asks with\na raised eyebrow. &ldquo;Or do you want to keep psychoanalyzing me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who says I can&rsquo;t do both?&rdquo; She offers him a crooked grin\nthat he has a feeling he&rsquo;s privileged to see. &ldquo;&rsquo;Captain Jones,&rsquo;&rdquo; she muses as she\nstarts walking backwards toward the stage. &ldquo;I like that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget to take pictures,&rdquo; she calls over her\nshoulder. &ldquo;I want to see Flash&rsquo;s face when your son wins this for us.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony stares after her with he mouth open and his eyebrows\nfurrowed for a second, before shaking his head in exasperation.</p><p>He finally takes his seat on the end of the row. People seem\nto have finally lost interest in him, and Ned&rsquo;s mom is talking animatedly with\na man on the row in front of them, so Tony turns his attention to the camera.</p><p>The playback button is taunting him. </p><p>After a moment of hesitation, Tony turns the camera on and hits\nthe button, pulling up Peter&rsquo;s most recent pictures. The first one is, of\ncourse, one of the three that MJ had taken of him. </p><p>He&rsquo;s scowling down at her, the bad florescent lighting\nmaking the his face look paler and older than it should. He skips to the next\none, almost the same, but this time there&rsquo;s a fire in his eyes at the\ninsinuation that he adopted Peter for any other reason that it&rsquo;s <i>Peter </i>and Peter was <i>his kid</i> even before May died.</p><p>He takes a deep breath and moves on to the third. </p><p>He&rsquo;s staring away from the camera, his lips slightly parted\nin shock. There is adoration written into every line of his face, an open tenderness\nin his gaze that can only mean he&rsquo;s looking at Peter.</p><p>Tony swallows, looks subtly around him to make sure no one&rsquo;s\nwatching him. He looks back at the picture, his thumb hovering over the delete\nbutton. </p><p>&ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the Academic Decathlon\nregional finalists participating in the science quiz portion to the stage.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony jumps, looking up at the stage as kids start filing out\nand taking their seats. Peter&rsquo;s the seventh kid to walk out, his curls extra\nruffled like he&rsquo;s been running his hands through it in his nerves.</p><p>Tony hesitates for one more second before turning the camera\noff, the picture still sitting on the memory card. He claps for his kid,\ngrinning when Peter&rsquo;s eyes find him from the stage.</p><p><i>I love you</i>, he\nthinks again. And then, <i>kick their butts,\nkiddo</i>. </p><p>Peter does indeed win it for them, and Tony gets a close up\nof Flash&rsquo;s face as he sits sulking at the end of the table, having answered\nzero questions.

It always ended up like this and it was a great way to de-stress while you damn near pulled your hair out while trying to remember the definitions of these terms.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh come on, sugar. You never actually want me to stop,\u201d he winks at you as he sat on your lap and laid across you, knocking you down backwards on the bed.<br/></p><p>\u201cFirst you don\u2019t want me to get smart by keeping me from studying now you\u2019re trying to kill me? I\u2019m calling campus police!!,\u201d you reached for your phone but he snatched it up before you and started to run around your dorm room. You chased after him as he ran on the other side of the table and you tried reaching over the table to grab it but he jumped back from your reach and laughed in your face.<br/></p><p>\u201cCome on, Stark! I\u2019m gonna call the RA!,\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cY/N.. we <i>ARE</i> the RA\u2019s!,\u201d<br/></p><p>He had a point there. He ran to your bed and started jumping up and down on it and you tried to knock his legs from under him but he just jumped over you, landing behind you and tackled you down on the bed.</p><p>\u201cGet off me you big oaf!,\u201d you groan as he squished you under the weight of his body.<br/></p><p>\u201cRecant! Recant!,\u201d he chants,\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s the only way I\u2019ll let go!,\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cUncle! Uncle!,\u201d you tap out on the books on your bed. He laughs and releases your phone and gets up from off of you smacking your ass, making you yelp out in surprise.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI was kind of liking that position,\u201d he sighs as if he was let down.<br/></p><!-- more --><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so disgusting,\u201d you sit back up on the bed and put the book in your lap trying to continue studying but he removed the book from your grasp and you fell back on your pillow groaning,\u00a0\u201cWhy don\u2019t you want me to succeed?!,\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cQuiet hours,\u201d he puts his finger up to his lips and you just roll your eyes at him,\u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s play your favorite studying game. You know that always helps you remember,\u201d he sets the book down and crawls over your body. Looking down into your dark brown eyes, he gives a wide grin.<br/></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Ant. I\u2019m really stressed out about this one, it\u2019s mainly all Latin terms,\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cGives us all the more reason to play,\u201d he begins to remove your pants and you give in, realizing he was right, this was the only way you would pass, which is quite sad but everyone has their studying methods, right?<br/></p><p>Whenever you had an exam, Tony would have his head between your legs, questioning you and as you continued to answer correcting, he\u2019d get closer to letting you cum, if you were wrong he\u2019d stop and go over it with you until you got it right before he got back down to business. This helped you during exams, it was so easy to remember because all you had to do was flashback to him between your legs and what tactics he did to help you remember that specific question.</p><p>He ran his hands up and down your bare thighs as you just wore is MIT shirt, staring at your clothed heat,\u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s <i>ad damnum</i>?,\u201d he looked at your book and quickly read the definition.</p><p>You closed your eyes and slowly inhaled,\u00a0\u201cAd damnum&hellip; refers to the parts or sections of a petition that speaks to the damages that were suffered and claimed by the plaintiff,\u201d you exhale as you feel Tony rub his thumb against your clit.</p><p>\u201cWhat about <i>ad litem</i>?,\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>You have to think about this one for a bit, there were so many A terms you had to remember it was easy to mix up.</p><p>\u201cUuuuuh,\u201d you hesitate,\u00a0\u201c<i>For the purpose of the lawsuit</i>,\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cMm, you sure about that one,\u201d he asks unsure. Now you question it.<br/></p><p>\u201cWait no!,\u201d you stop,\u00a0\u201cIt means.. to make void,\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cThat your final answer?,\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>You hum a yes and he removes his hands from you completely,\u00a0\u201cYou got it wrong,\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You sat up and gawked at him,\u00a0\u201cBecause you said I did!,\u201d</p><p>He takes your chin between his thumb and index finger, bringing it up to close your mouth,\u00a0\u201cI said no such thing,\u201d he shakes his head,\u00a0\u201cI just asked if you were sure, you second guessed yourself, we\u2019ve talked about this. You gotta stop doing that. If you\u2019re sure, go with that answer,\u201d he advises.</p><p>He was a good tutor outside of being your boyfriend and while he had good points, he played too many mind games.</p><p>\u201cNow, lay back down and we\u2019ll try again. Don\u2019t let me sway your answer if you\u2019re sure. You got this, sugar,\u201d he lightly pushes you back down to lie on your back and you stare at the ceiling.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDefine bifurcation and give an example,\u201d he says<br/></p><p>\u201cThe division of something into two branches or parts. For example, a trial. Like in civil cases, a liability phase and a damages phase,\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cGood girl,\u201d he removes your panties and rubs your clit with hard, slow circles.<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>Bona Vacantia</i>. Don\u2019t overthink it, sugar. You know this one,\u201d<br/></p><p>There\u2019s been plenty of times where you can\u2019t remember this one for the sake of everything. You always got it wrong for some reason. But Tony rubbing your clit had helped you focus because you wanted to cum.</p><p>\u201cProperty that&hellip;,\u201d you hesitate but he encourages you,\u00a0\u201cProperty that belongs to no person and may be claimed by a finder,\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my smart girl,\u201d you felt him thrust a finger in you and teased you and he continued looking through your book.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cTell me what <i>certiorari</i> means,\u201d he began kissing and biting the inside of your thighs.<br/></p><p>\u201cTo be in formed of,\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cLove it when you talk all legal to me,\u201d he wraps his lips around your clit and you feel yourself fully relax as that\u2019s what you\u2019ve been waiting for. He was so good with his mouth it was unreal.<br/></p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re low key a criminal,\u201d your tone was hushed but he still heard you and chuckled.<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>De facto</i>,\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact,\u201d you didn\u2019t miss a beat, that one was easy as fuck.\u00a0<br/></p><p>And that\u2019s how it went, he kept asking questions until he was deep inside you and had you writhing beneath him.</p><p>\u201cLast one baby. What\u2019s <i>Voir Dire</i> mean?,\u201d he groaned as he snapped his hips. You had your head buried in his neck, moaning as quietly as you could so you wouldn\u2019t wake your residents. You struggled to answer, not because you didn\u2019t know the answer but because it felt like he was in your guts and the feeling was overwhelming you,\u00a0\u201cCome on, sugar. I know you know it,\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cThe&hellip; the french phrase m-meaning..\u201d you gasped as he snapped his hips particularly hard and bit your collarbone\u00a0\u201cMeaning.. <i>to speak the truth</i>,\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>That\u2019s it</i>,\u201d he praises and goes harder, making you wrap your legs around him tightly.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll ace that exam tomorrow, baby,\u201d he kisses you and encourages you to cum as he feels himself about to let go as well,\u00a0\u201cCum for me, sugar,\u201d<br/></p><p>You bit his shoulder as you feel yourself cumming around him, trying hard not to moan out into the silent room.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d he whispers as he pulls out and cums on your stomach, using a small hand towel to clean you up. You see stars as you stare up at the ceiling.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll do great tomorrow. When has our method ever failed you?,\u201d<br/></p><p>&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>You were one of the few people in the class of a hundred something to absolutely and completely ace the exam, like Tony said. You rushed out of the building to find Tony waiting on the hood of his car for you. You ran to him with your scantron in your hand.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe did it! we did it!,\u201d you showed him your scantron and he picked you up, spinning you around and planting kisses on your cheeks.<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>You</i> did it!,\u201d he corrects as he puts you down. Everyone around stared at you two, they always do. It was because of Tony, everyone knew Tony, he was the boy genius. He first got here when he was 15 and was about to graduate while you were only a sophomore, despite being the same age.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cBut you helped!,\u201d you wave the paper,\u00a0\u201cWithout you, I would have bombed that exam,\u201d you tell him as he leads you to your side of his expensive ass car. This thing was worth your tuition times like&hellip; three if not more than that, who knows, you weren\u2019t a damn math major.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhere we headed?,\u201d you ask as he walks around to his side. The hood was down, the day was nice, he wanted to go for a drive.<br/></p><p>\u201cOur little spot by the creek. Want to treat this really smart girl who aced her extremely hard exam today,\u201d<br/></p><p>Your face gets hot as you look down at your scantron and smile at the big red numbers that read\u00a0\u201c100\u2033, that exam was damn near two hundred questions and you and Tony barely went through half of the material last night, but you went through the ones you needed and that was enough.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll appreciate it,\u201d you held his hand as the wind kissed your scalp and ran its fingers through your tight curls,\u00a0\u201cShe loves the support system she has,\u201d<br/></p><p>He kissed your hand and looked at you over his sunglasses to wink at you, you gave him one right back. He turned up the radio and you two sang along to your song that just so happened to be playing at the perfect time.</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>Your dress was hiked up as Tony stood between your legs and fucked you on the hood of his car. You held onto his jacket as he held your legs under your knees and fucked you into oblivion.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou feel so good, Ant!,\u201d you could finally be as loud as you wanted. Your spot at the creek was secluded and never got an visitors.<br/></p><p>You two always did this after either of you did well on an exam. It honestly made you feel more special than any grade ever could. Tony made you feel things that no amount of perfect scores ever could, it wasn\u2019t just the sex, it was so much more. It was your connection, your support and love for each other.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N, I\u2019m gonna cum,\u201d he let you know. He hissed as you tightened around him, rubbing your clit fast as you felt in throb within you,\u00a0\u201cYou feel so good, sugar,\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah?,\u201d you ask, lifting his chin so he would make eye contact with you.<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he nodded feverishly, nails digging into your thighs<br/></p><p>\u201cThen cum with me, baby,\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>You saw his eyes roll in his head as you pull him close for a kiss. He released your legs and planted his palms against the hood of the car, the bright white standing out against your pale pink dress and beautiful brown skin. He went harder and you sucked his lip into your mouth, biting and sucking, making him grunt before pulling out to jerk himself off and rub your clit, making you two cum together.\u00a0</p><p>All that could be heard was you two panting and the rustling of the leaves. His head rested on your breast as he calmed himself,\u00a0\u201cI love you so much,\u201d he mumbles.</p><p>\u201cAnd I love you, Ant,\u201d he sat up and smiled at you then looked at his wrist watch.<br/></p><p>\u201cWe better clean up and get going. We have an RA huddle at 3,\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>You groaned, you hated those things. They were every month and was basically just the reiteration of shit you already knew.\u00a0</p><p>Tony got up and grabbed a pack of wipes and a plastic bag from the glove box. You two took a wipe to clean yourselves up before putting it in the plastic bag to tie it up and throw it in the backseat.\u00a0</p><p>You two got in the car and he started it, slowly pulling away from creek but not before grabbing your hand to plant another kiss on it and speeding away.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>\u201cYou all know what to do with items like candles, hot plates, alcohol bottles and what not, correct?,\u201d your Residential Director asks the room full of RA\u2019s<br/></p><p>\u201cYes. We take a picture of the item, confiscate it then key into your office and leave it on your desk with a report that details what room we found it in, who lives in said room, what time it was and the name of the RA that confiscated the item and wait for you to give the report to the housing office. Once you receive the go ahead, you will notify us to add the resident to the billing list,\u201d you tell her the steps of the whole process and she nods before moving onto the next subject.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Tony had his head leaning against your shoulder as you listened to your RD, he was playing with his pencil, not paying a lick of attention.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnt, you gotta listen,\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cSugar, we know this shit already,\u201d he groaned quietly.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah, but you know how she is,\u201d<br/></p><p>He sighed in annoyance, knowing you were right. He set his pencil down and began paying attention but didn\u2019t lift his head from your shoulder.</p><p>\u201cPlease, please, <i>pleeaase</i>, for the love of Pete, keep up with your residents and HSI\u2019s. I\u2019m quite tired of verifying these long billing lists because your residents didn\u2019t pass their room inspections. I get it, it\u2019s not your fault because you can\u2019t make grown ass people clean up after themselves but their mommy isn\u2019t here to do it for them. They\u2019ll learn once those bills start racking up,\u201d She shrugs nonchalantly and Tony chuckles,\u00a0\u201cLet them know that you\u2019ll only be checking their living areas once a week on your designated inspection day, Monday- Thursday only because HSI billing lists are due every Friday at 11:59 p.m. Let them know they\u2019re in control of the cleanliness of their living areas because if they fail, we don\u2019t reinspect until that next week and failed HSI billings are $500,\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Your RD does not play when it comes to her residential hall, and sometimes you wonder how you and Tony even got jobs as RA\u2019s but you two bust your ass so you\u2019re glad you can still cal yourself once.<br/></p><p>Tony grabs your hand to run his thumb over the soft skin and you softly smile as you lean your head against his.</p><p>\u201cYou all have been doing well so far this semester. You all have another floor meeting coming soon. Let your residents know that midterms are coming up and they need to stay on top of everything because we don\u2019t do a second chance program here like other universities if they get below a certain level. Let them know your office hours so they can come to you all for help if they need, or direct them to the tutoring labs because they need a 3.0 to stay on campus. If they drop below that mark they <b><i>will</i></b> be kicked off campus. No if, ands, or buts about it,\u201d she turns off the powerpoint and stands before you in the main lounge of the resident hall and smiles at you all<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m proud of all your work. Your boards are due tomorrow at 11:59. Let\u2019s keep the good work up and make this spring semester a good one, yeah?,\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYes ma\u2019am,\u201d you all answer and she finally lets you guys go. You collect your belongings and Tony leads you out the room, swinging your arm back and forth as he held your hand.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou wanna help me with my bulletin board? My topic is\u00a0\u2018<i>the importance of being clean</i>\u2019 I have all the damn sports kids on this floor, they won\u2019t know what clean is even if it hit them in the face\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cAt least yours isn\u2019t the\u00a0\u2018<i>side effects of sitting at your computer for too long</i>\u2019,\u201d he rolls his eyes,\u00a0\u201cI got to put all these facts about eye strain and risks of carpal fucking tunnel and hemorrhoids and how you need to take a ten minute break for every hour you sit at the computer,\u201d you two reach your room and he plops down on your mini couch, watching you pull out a bunch of construction paper and letter stencils.<br/></p><p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d he you hand him letter stencils and a big board,\u00a0\u201cBe a helpful fellow RA. Just trace the letters, here\u2019s a lay out,\u201d you hand him another paper so he knows what letters to cut out and how many.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cFine.. but you get to cut and paste the facts about hemorrhoids when we do my board,\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so gross!,\u201d you scroll on your laptop as you sit at your desk and look for pictures to put up on your topic board in the hall.<br/></p><p>\u201cRemember, to take a break, sugar. We don\u2019t want any problems with that sweet ass,\u201d he chuckles to himself and you throw a pen at him which only causes him to laugh harder<br/></p><p>\u201cNot funny, Ant!,\u201d<br/></p><p>&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>\u201cI thought we said no expensive dates this semester?,\u201d you scolded him as he pulled up to the restaurant and just laughed at your reaction. He told you to get all dolled up because you two were taking a night out since neither of you were on duty.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cSugar, we say a lot of things like that but when do I ever listen to you?,\u201d he winked at you and got out the car to go to your side and open the door for you,\u00a0\u201cPlus, you said the other day you were sick of the cafeteria food and wanted a taste of real food,\u201d he shrugs.<br/></p><p>\u201cAnt!,\u201d you slap his shoulder,\u00a0\u201cI was just talking out into the air. I didn\u2019t even think you were listening because you were studying,\u201d you widen your eyes at him<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my little lady. Of course I\u2019m always listening to you. Now come on, I\u2019m starving,\u201d he takes your hand and leads you into the fancy restaurant and telling the host his last name. The host lead you to an area outside under a pavilion with fairy lights.<br/></p><p>\u201cAnthony, this is too much!,\u201d you hiss as he pulls out your chair for you.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so modest. It\u2019s okay to admit you like it,\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI absolutely love it! But you didn\u2019t have to go all out like this,\u201d you hold his hand from across the table.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cBabe, it\u2019s fine really. Now how about you pick up that menu and order something that will be nice to your stomach unlike the campus food,\u201d<br/></p><p>You laugh and shake your head at him, picking up the menu.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>You ordered something with lobster in it and whatever it was, it was heaven on a plate. Tony ordered something simple, something he could have gotten anywhere else, fucking spaghetti and meatballs. He claims no one else makes it like this place.</p><p>You drank your virgin mimosa as he drank his disgusting sparkling water.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see how you drink that stuff. It tastes like TV static,\u201d you frown over the rim of your cup.<br/></p><p>He gave you a confused smile and continued drinking,\u00a0\u201cAnd I don\u2019t see how you can drink that stuff. It tastes like influenza recovery, all that vitamin c is too much,\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh shut it,\u201d you wave your hand at him and he just stares at you adoringly which, with anyone else, would make them feel great but you felt small when he looked at you like that.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cStop staring,\u201d you whined,\u00a0\u201cYou know I get insecure when people stare,\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cBut why?,\u201d he asks surprised as if he hadn\u2019t heard it before. You two had been dating for two years of course he knew why, he just couldn\u2019t <i>understand</i> why. He leaned forward on the table and looked you dead in your eyes.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou are so beautiful, I can\u2019t believe I get to call you my girlfriend,\u201d he smiles but your frown just deepens.<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>You?</i>,\u201d you softly lay your hands on the table,\u00a0\u201cC\u2019mon man, you\u2019re<i> the</i> Tony Stark. I\u2019m the lucky one. The boy genius loves me. Like I get you\u2019re so much more than that but going to the same University as you was so intimidating, it still is a little bit,\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>He takes both of your hands and squeezes them,\u00a0\u201cYeah you see me as Tony Stark but I\u2019ve always been more than that to you,\u201d his thumbs run the backs of your hands and you get goosebumps,\u00a0\u201cYou see me as so much more than the 15 year old who got accepted into a prestigious university and could have finished at 17 but decided to stay full term. You look past the money, the cars, the big vacation houses, and the labels. You love me for a deeper reason than what everyone wants to be friends with me for,\u201d you see tears glisten in his arms and you awh at him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d you pout,\u00a0\u201cOr else I\u2019m gonna cry and it took a long time to make myself look this good,\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou could cry it all off and I\u2019d still find you gorgeous,\u201d<br/></p><p>Your cheeks hurt from smiling so hard and you try to hide your face.</p><p>\u201cAnd you?,\u201d he exasperates,\u00a0\u201cI never want to let you go. You\u2019re so fucking kind and open-minded. You\u2019re so intelligent and you never let anyone dumb you down. You\u2019re an inspiration and don\u2019t even know it,\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>You were about to scoff in his face until you see the look in his eyes. He was dead serious, there was no way he could lie about how he felt about you, it was raw and real and scared you almost because you never saw yourself as someone to be loved in such a way that Tony loves you but you embrace the feeling and it\u2019s warm.</p><p>\u201cDamn you, Stark,\u201d you remove a hand from his grasp and wipe or eyes to keep your liner from running.<br/></p><p>The waiter brings you the bill and you go to grab it only for Tony to grab it first and slid his card in it and writing the tip in, handing it back to the waiter whose eyes bulge at the tip before walking away.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you do that? We always split,\u201d you raise a brow at him<br/></p><p>\u201cStop questioning me and let me do me,\u201d he straightens his tie and you can\u2019t help but give a little laugh,\u00a0\u201cYou can pay me back by doing my HSI\u2019s,\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWow so that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing now? Blackmailing?,\u201d<br/></p><p>He smirked at you and shook is head-</p><p><i>\u201cNot at all, sugar,\u201d</i><br/></p><p>&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>\u201cI swear guys, it\u2019s really not that hard to keep your rooms clean,\u201d you sigh as you look across the room at your residents. It was your monthly floor meeting and Tony was there with you like always,\u00a0\u201cSome of you have already been fined more than three times already because you\u2019ve failed room inspections. Do you guys know how much the fine is?,\u201d you ask and it might as well be crickets in the room.<br/></p><p>\u201cI dunno like.. 50 bucks,\u201d one of your residents shrugs his shoulders, he was the typical dumb ass football player.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cAdd 450 bucks to that and that\u2019s your answer,\u201d Tony speaks up and stops spinning in his chair to look at the guy.<br/></p><p>\u201c500 fucking bucks just for failing room inspections?!,\u201d one of the softball players speaks up.<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s considered a safety hazard. Most of you live with a roommate and even if you live in a single, you still live in a suite with<i> other</i> people,\u201d you rub your temples,\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s really not that hard to clean up after yourselves. I mean seriously, we\u2019re all adults. There is also a bathroom cleaning schedule on the bathroom doors. Each room in the suite is assigned to a different section of the bathroom every week, whether it be floors, mirrors and sinks, stalls, showers whatever, if it has your room letter by that section for the week, it is your responsibility to clean it. If everyone else in the suite cleans up and you miss your section, they pass, you fail, which is another fine of $500. So if you fail your room inspection <i>and</i> bathroom inspection, that\u2019s already $1000 right there,\u201d<br/></p><p>This causes an uproar in the room and everyone is talking and you just roll your eyes,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll wait. I talk over no one,\u201d you pick up your phone and scroll through social media just waiting for them to finish. Tony just laughs and shakes his head at them</p><p>\u201cYou guys always complain you have shit to do but maybe if you shut your mouths and listen we can speed this process up,\u201d Tony calls out. Everyone finally shuts their mouths as they look to him. You lock your phone and place it down and lean forward on the table.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really not understanding the upset. It\u2019s simple. You clean up after yourselves, you don\u2019t get fined. We aren\u2019t your coaches, we aren\u2019t your parents, we are not here to coddle you. We are here to do our job, if you have such a problem with that then go to the housing office to back out of your contract and move off campus,\u201d you roll your eyes once again and Tony puts his arm around the back of your chair to scoot closer to you.<br/></p><p>\u201cDoes he always have to be in here?,\u201d one of the baseball players asks.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the SRA. I can be wherever I want, when I want and come and go as I please. Since it\u2019s my job to look after the regular RA\u2019s and all residents, I can oversee these meetings. Now how about you just shut that mouth and listen,\u201d<br/></p><p><i>\u201cYou clearly do more than look after her,\u201d</i><br/></p><p>\u201cMore than you can say about your girl, Tyler. Still with Izzy after she slept with your teammate or no?,\u201d Tony places the pencil behind his ear and props his feet on the table that you two are sitting at in the front of the lounge. He has a smug grin and you can see Tyler\u2019s face turn red under his caramel skin.<br/></p><p>\u201cAnthony,\u201d you slapped his arm and scolded him but he just laughed as you went back to talking about the topics from your list.<br/></p><p>\u201cThis is just a reiteration that items like candles, hot plates, blenders, boilers, those little George Foreman grills are prohibited and if they are found they will be confiscated and you will be fined,\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Another wave of complaining flooded the room and Tony slammed his hands on the table,\u00a0\u201cWhat is up with you all and always complaining? Shut the hell up,\u201d he groaned,\u00a0\u201cIf you have that much of a problem with the rules, do as Y/N said and move off campus. Get one of those campus apartments down the street. Oh wait,\u201d he taps his chin,\u00a0\u201cYou can\u2019t because you\u2019re just freshmen and sophomores,\u201d\u00a0</p><p>One of your residents is still complaining and you\u2019ve had just about enough,\u00a0\u201cSierra, please for the love of God be quiet. Your Bath and Body Works Japanese Cherry Blossom candle gives me a fucking headache and is played out anyway. Grow up,\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Her jaw drops and you take a deep breath to calm yourself a bit.</p><p>\u201cThese rules were in the handbook you received before you even came here. If you\u2019re returning sophomores I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re acting so surprised. You know all of this. I did not make the rules, I just implement them because it\u2019s my job to,\u201d<br/></p><p>You continue to talk about how midterms are coming up and how they need to stay on top of things to be able to be eligible to stay on campus. You talk about how if they miss a floor meeting, they will be fined, not as much but fined regardless. You answer a few questions and begin calling them up by suites to sign the floor meeting check in paper.</p><p>\u201cAnd finally, suite 301,\u201d you call out and the baseball suite comes up and Tyler is still scowling at Tony. They never liked each other anyway, Tony didn\u2019t have a problem with the poor sophomore until he found him trying to hit on you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou can frown like a three year old all you want. It won\u2019t change anything,\u201d Tony looked at him completely unamused and Tyler just signed his name practically throwing the pen at you in which Tony stood up and yanked him back by the collar of his baseball jersey.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow about we rewind and you hand her the pen before I throw <i>you</i>, yeah?,\u201d Tony dragged him back to the front of the table and handed Tyler the pen so he can\u00a0\u201ctry again\u201d</p><p>Tyler huffs and hands you the pen which you softly take from him,\u00a0\u201cRemember, room checks are every Tuesday 6pm-8pm. If it\u2019s not clean I won\u2019t feel bad for failing you,\u201d<br/></p><p>He just walks out of the floor lounge and you paper clip all your papers and turn to Tony.</p><p>\u201cWhy did I let you talk me into applying for this job, babe? They\u2019re absolutely insufferable,\u201d you whine and rest your head on his shoulder which he kisses.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cIt will get better as you move up. As they get older the easier it will get,\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky you have all the older techy- sciency people. I bet you never hear a peep out of them,\u201d you two walk back to your room and he climbs on your bed, kicking his shoes off, as you put the sign in sheet in a manila folder to place in your RD\u2019s office.<br/></p><p>\u201cOnly when they\u2019re not fighting on whether Akali\u2019s or Kai\u2019Sa\u2019s attacks are better,\u201d<br/></p><p>You turn around to frown at him and scrunch your face up in confusion,\u00a0\u201cWho?,\u201d</p><p>Tony just waves his hand at you,\u00a0\u201cGamer stuff,\u201d he takes his shirt off and waves you over to him,\u00a0\u201cBut like you said, they\u2019re tech and science nerds so their rooms are also trash bins. With all that mellow yellow, cheese puffs and tissues littered everywhere covered in only God knows what,\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You kick your shoes off as well and climb on your bed to straddle him,\u00a0\u201cAnd to think you want me to do your HSI\u2019s this week. You set me up,\u201d you slapped his chest, the spot turning red automatically.\u00a0</p><p>He hissed and turned you over, pinning you down under him,\u00a0\u201cSay sorry,\u201d his nose was touching yours as he clenched his teeth.</p><p>\u201cMake me,\u201d you leaned forward and your lips touched his as you spoke.<br/></p><p>\u201cOh we\u2019re gonna play this game now? That\u2019s cool,\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>He got off the bed to lock your door and jumped back on to remove your jeans. You didn\u2019t even protest, you knew he\u2019d win and you wanted him to win. You feel the material rub against your skin and the warm metal of the zipper tracks scratch your skin a bit.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSugar, say sorry,\u201d he didn\u2019t even bother removing your panties, he had a thing for fucking you with them on and you just let him have his fun. He laid flat on his stomach and moved your panties to the side to lick a small circle around your clit.<br/></p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d you were still keeping up with this game and Tony had no problem with it. He kissed and nipped at your thighs and you tried to jerk away but he shook his head at you, eyes telling you to keep still.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Once his entire mouth covered you, your hands tangled themselves in his hair as a default. His tongue was so warm and wet against you, your clit started throbbing for more and he knew that. It was almost like he could feel the little heart beat against the tip of his tongue. He takes his time, any other time it\u2019s rushed and intense. But he makes sure to give your pussy all types of kisses and love.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnt,\u201d you whined quietly, and looked down at him to find he was already staring back up at you. He wanted you to apologize, it was just a small slap but he wanted you to apologize just to tease you, knowing you would playfully be stubborn which would turn into this exact situation.<br/></p><p>\u201cLook at you,\u201d he pulled back, lips glistening and wet but eyes not moving from yours as his thumb swirled around your wet clit, he sucks his lip into his mouth and you just caress his cheek, adoring the view of him between your legs,\u00a0\u201cMaybe if you just say sorry I\u2019ll let you cum,\u201d<br/></p><p>He pushes two fingers in and starts going at a fast pace. He moves to lay beside you, placing your leg over one of his as he whispers in your ear and finger fucking you,\u00a0\u201cJust say sorry like a good girl and I\u2019ll let you cum, sugar,\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He curls his fingers and you feel the pleasure spread down to your toes and you find yourself wrapping your arms around the one he was using on you and hid in his chest, trying your best not to be loud.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnt, please,\u201d your voice was muffled and he just smiled at you, moving his fingers harder then slowed them down again, teasing you and you knew he was doing that just so he could win, though he always won, you liked putting up a fight. The obscene squelching of his fingers moving in and out of you filled the room and could most likely be heard from the other side of the door, it was that loud and you were <i>that</i> wet.<br/></p><p>\u201cGo ahead, sugar. Say sorry,\u201d<br/></p><p>You dug your fingernails into his flesh and planted your feet onto the bed to get a better angle to be able to buck your hips up. Tony stopped his motions to watch you fuck yourself on his fingers.</p><p>\u201cBaby, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d you called out louder than intended but he didn\u2019t protest.<br/></p><p>\u201cGo ahead and get yourself off on my fingers,\u201d his voice had dropped as he spoke directly into your ear,\u00a0\u201cThanks for apologizing,\u201d his tone was teasing and instigating. He won and that\u2019s all Tony ever wants when you play, he wanted to win.<br/></p><p>\u201cBabyyyy,\u201d your nails dug deeper and he shushed you.<br/></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so loud, don\u2019t wanna get interrupted before you even get a chance to cum, do you?,\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNoooo,\u201d you looked up from his chest to see him smiling down at you, fingers curling up, tapping your sweet spot, making your eyes roll back in your head. You heard a deep groan resonate within his chest and that\u2019s your undoing. You hold onto his forearm and rode yourself on his fingers, finally cumming. Your mouth fell open, ready to moan out into the quiet room, until Tony stuck his tongue in your mouth, kissing you deep with you following along.<br/></p><p>He feels his fingers become wetter from your cum and he kisses you harder. Fingers still moving within you to ride out your climax. You pull away from his lips with a gasp, his lips red and yours tingling, tongue savoring the taste of yourself as Tony stares down at you in adoration.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re staring again,\u201d you hide yourself in his chest again, while he\u2019s still in you.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not apologizing for staring at my girlfriend,\u201d he moves back to be able to look at you once again,\u00a0\u201cPlus, you\u2019re cute when you cum. I mean, you\u2019re always cute but when you cum it\u2019s a different kind of cute,\u201d He finally pulls his fingers out and sucks them, making sure you\u2019re looking him in his eyes as he does so.<br/></p><p>He was so dirty, and you loved it. A perfect, educated young man to everyone else but you knew the real him. You pulled his fingers out his lips to kiss him once again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky I like you enough to let you win,\u201d<br/></p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>\u201cWant anything from the vending machine?,\u201d Tony asks. It was a late night in the library and you two occupied a study room so you two could focus without being surrounded by the other loud students.<br/></p><p>\u201cJust a water and some Twizzlers if they have them. If not, cheez-its,\u201d you spare him a glance and a kiss before he leaves and turned back to your delinquency control and prevention textbook. You sat quietly as you highlighted the important theories that your professor said to focus on and stressed in class.<br/></p><p>He wasn\u2019t gone for long and he came back with his arms almost full, mostly being snacks for him. He hands you a water and a pack of Twizzlers along with cheez-it.</p><p>\u201cBabe, I said, either or,\u201d you took a sip of the water,<br/></p><p>\u201cAnd I decided on either <i>and</i> or,\u201d he sat back in his chair and opened a bag of chips, popping a few in his mouth and winking at you<br/></p><p>\u201cThank you either way, Ant,\u201d you kiss his cheek before sitting back and taking a break to munch on your snacks. You two were sitting in comfortable silence when he hands you your glasses case.</p><p>\u201cI have my contacts in,\u201d you point to your eyes. He sucks his teeth and rolls his eyes.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah and you\u2019re starting to blink a lot faster, meaning your eyes are getting dry. Meaning it\u2019s time to take them out which means&hellip; put your damn glasses on,\u201d he laughs at you while dusting off his hands and putting on hand sanitizer to take them out for you. You hated touching your own eyes and as backwards as it seems, you preferred Tony to do it. So every morning he would put them in for you and every night he would take them out.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI hate wearing them,\u201d you mumbled.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t you know you\u2019ll get a headache,\u201d He stands over you and holds your eyes open as he takes them out one by one and adding a drop of eye drops to lubricate your eyes and placing your glasses on your face. You pushed them up on the bridge of your nose and Tony almost audibly cooed at how fucking cute that was. He throws your contacts away and sits back down beside you, rubbing you back of your neck to help you release some of the tension you hold there as you study.<br/></p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s stay for another half hour and we turn in for the night, yeah?,\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>You wanted to protest, but you knew you two needed sleep. You had to wake up early as hell to do a lock out for a resident who locked his key in his room and Tony was woken up by a phone call to do a mediation for his residents who ended up fighting in the wee hours and woken up their suite-mates so you both had an early start to your day.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay sounds good,\u201d you nod, biting a Twizzler and turning back to your book. Tony just watched you. He watched the way you swung the Twizzler around as you were deep into the context of your textbook. The way you swung your foot back and forth and played with your curls as you didn\u2019t understand a theory and had to re read it a few times.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Soon it was time to go back to the dorms and Tony helped you back your stuff up and piggybacked you to the car as you were tired and sleep finally started to hit you. He placed both of your belongs in the front seat and laid you down in the back seat, using the middle seat belt to strap you in.\u00a0</p><p>He never drove so carefully, avoiding all the potholes so you he wouldn\u2019t wake you up, braking easily when he came up on a red light and left the radio off.</p><p>\u00a0When you were both back to the dorms he placed both of your bags on his shoulders and carried you bridal style. You easily curled up into him, knowing it was him. He swiped his ID to get into the building and no one asked questions as to why he was carrying you. You were his lady so it was to be expected, especially since you were asleep.</p><p>Even though you just lived on the third floor and usually take the stairs, he took the elevator for a smooth ride. He used his master key to get into your room, not wanting to wake you up to get your key out of your bag. He softly laid you on the bed and undressed you to get you dressed in your night clothes which was really just a pair of his gym shorts and band tee of his. He searched around in the dark for your bonnet, knowing if he turned on the light it would wake you up. He tiredly stumbled over your shoe and looked back to you in fear that the loud noise had woken you up, but when he found you still sleeping he continued his quest. He found it hanging in your top dresser drawer and kicked his shoes off to strip down to his briefs and crawl in bed with you. He had situated you by the wall, knowing you have a habit of falling off the bed and softly raised your head to place the bonnet completely on it and rested your head back on your pillow.\u00a0</p><p>He was glad you went with a bare face today or else it\u2019d be hell trying to get the make up off without trying to wake you up. He removed your glasses, placing them on your desk and kissed your forehead and and pulled you close to him. You nuzzled into his neck and hummed.\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cStrain theory is the theory that states that social structures within society may pressure citizens to commit crime,\u201d </i>you mumble in your sleep and he tries not to laugh at how cute it was<br/></p><p>\u201cI love you so much,\u201d he whispered as he leaned his cheek on yours, eyes finally fluttering closed as he embraced sleep.<br/></p><p><i>\u201cI love you more, Ant,\u201d</i><br/></p><p><i>&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</i></p><p><b>I LOVED THIS REQUEST SO MUCH OMFG!!

You know that always helps you remember,\u201d he sets the book down and crawls over your body. Looking down into your dark brown eyes, he gives a wide grin.<br></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Ant. I\u2019m really stressed out about this one, it\u2019s mainly all Latin terms,\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cGives us all the more reason to play,\u201d he begins to remove your pants and you give in, realizing he was right, this was the only way you would pass, which is quite sad but everyone has their studying methods, right?<br></p><p>Whenever you had an exam, Tony would have his head between your legs, questioning you and as you continued to answer correcting, he\u2019d get closer to letting you cum, if you were wrong he\u2019d stop and go over it with you until you got it right before he got back down to business. This helped you during exams, it was so easy to remember because all you had to do was flashback to him between your legs and what tactics he did to help you remember that specific question.</p><p>He ran his hands up and down your bare thighs as you just wore is MIT shirt, staring at your clothed heat,\u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s <i>ad damnum</i>?,\u201d he looked at your book and quickly read the definition.</p><p>You closed your eyes and slowly inhaled,\u00a0\u201cAd damnum\u2026 refers to the parts or sections of a petition that speaks to the damages that were suffered and claimed by the plaintiff,\u201d you exhale as you feel Tony rub his thumb against your clit.</p><p>\u201cWhat about <i>ad litem</i>?,\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>You have to think about this one for a bit, there were so many A terms you had to remember it was easy to mix up.</p><p>\u201cUuuuuh,\u201d you hesitate,\u00a0\u201c<i>For the purpose of the lawsuit</i>,\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cMm, you sure about that one,\u201d he asks unsure.

You gotta stop doing that. If you\u2019re sure, go with that answer,\u201d he advises.</p><p>He was a good tutor outside of being your boyfriend and while he had good points, he played too many mind games.</p><p>\u201cNow, lay back down and we\u2019ll try again. Don\u2019t let me sway your answer if you\u2019re sure. You got this, sugar,\u201d he lightly pushes you back down to lie on your back and you stare at the ceiling.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDefine bifurcation and give an example,\u201d he says<br></p><p>\u201cThe division of something into two branches or parts. For example, a trial. Like in civil cases, a liability phase and a damages phase,\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cGood girl,\u201d he removes your panties and rubs your clit with hard, slow circles.<br></p><p>\u201c<i>Bona Vacantia</i>. Don\u2019t overthink it, sugar. You know this one,\u201d<br></p><p>There\u2019s been plenty of times where you can\u2019t remember this one for the sake of everything. You always got it wrong for some reason. But Tony rubbing your clit had helped you focus because you wanted to cum.</p><p>\u201cProperty that\u2026,\u201d you hesitate but he encourages you,\u00a0\u201cProperty that belongs to no person and may be claimed by a finder,\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my smart girl,\u201d you felt him thrust a finger in you and teased you and he continued looking through your book.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cTell me what <i>certiorari</i> means,\u201d he began kissing and biting the inside of your thighs.<br></p><p>\u201cTo be in formed of,\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cLove it when you talk all legal to me,\u201d he wraps his lips around your clit and you feel yourself fully relax as that\u2019s what you\u2019ve been waiting for. He was so good with his mouth it was unreal.<br></p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re low key a criminal,\u201d your tone was hushed but he still heard you and chuckled.<br></p><p>\u201c<i>De facto</i>,\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact,\u201d you didn\u2019t miss a beat, that one was easy as fuck.\u00a0<br></p><p>And that\u2019s how it went, he kept asking questions until he was deep inside you and had you writhing beneath him.</p><p>\u201cLast one baby. What\u2019s <i>Voir Dire</i> mean?,\u201d he groaned as he snapped his hips. You had your head buried in his neck, moaning as quietly as you could so you wouldn\u2019t wake your residents. You struggled to answer, not because you didn\u2019t know the answer but because it felt like he was in your guts and the feeling was overwhelming you,\u00a0\u201cCome on, sugar. I know you know it,\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThe\u2026 the french phrase m-meaning..\u201d you gasped as he snapped his hips particularly hard and bit your collarbone\u00a0\u201cMeaning.. <i>to speak the truth</i>,\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201c<i>That\u2019s it</i>,\u201d he praises and goes harder, making you wrap your legs around him tightly.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll ace that exam tomorrow, baby,\u201d he kisses you and encourages you to cum as he feels himself about to let go as well,\u00a0\u201cCum for me, sugar,\u201d<br></p><p>You bit his shoulder as you feel yourself cumming around him, trying hard not to moan out into the silent room.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d he whispers as he pulls out and cums on your stomach, using a small hand towel to clean you up. You see stars as you stare up at the ceiling.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll do great tomorrow. When has our method ever failed you?,\u201d<br></p><p>\u2014\u2014-</p><p>You were one of the few people in the class of a hundred something to absolutely and completely ace the exam, like Tony said. You rushed out of the building to find Tony waiting on the hood of his car for you. You ran to him with your scantron in your hand.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe did it! we did it!,\u201d you showed him your scantron and he picked you up, spinning you around and planting kisses on your cheeks.<br></p><p>\u201c<i>You</i> did it!,\u201d he corrects as he puts you down. Everyone around stared at you two, they always do. It was because of Tony, everyone knew Tony, he was the boy genius. He first got here when he was 15 and was about to graduate while you were only a sophomore, despite being the same age.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cBut you helped!,\u201d you wave the paper,\u00a0\u201cWithout you, I would have bombed that exam,\u201d you tell him as he leads you to your side of his expensive ass car. This thing was worth your tuition times like\u2026 three if not more than that, who knows, you weren\u2019t a damn math major.<br></p><p>\u201cWhere we headed?,\u201d you ask as he walks around to his side. The hood was down, the day was nice, he wanted to go for a drive.<br></p><p>\u201cOur little spot by the creek. Want to treat this really smart girl who aced her extremely hard exam today,\u201d<br></p><p>Your face gets hot as you look down at your scantron and smile at the big red numbers that read\u00a0\u201c100\u2033, that exam was damn near two hundred questions and you and Tony barely went through half of the material last night, but you went through the ones you needed and that was enough.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll appreciate it,\u201d you held his hand as the wind kissed your scalp and ran its fingers through your tight curls,\u00a0\u201cShe loves the support system she has,\u201d<br></p><p>He kissed your hand and looked at you over his sunglasses to wink at you, you gave him one right back. He turned up the radio and you two sang along to your song that just so happened to be playing at the perfect time.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>Your dress was hiked up as Tony stood between your legs and fucked you on the hood of his car. You held onto his jacket as he held your legs under your knees and fucked you into oblivion.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou feel so good, Ant!,\u201d you could finally be as loud as you wanted. Your spot at the creek was secluded and never got an visitors.<br></p><p>You two always did this after either of you did well on an exam. It honestly made you feel more special than any grade ever could. Tony made you feel things that no amount of perfect scores ever could, it wasn\u2019t just the sex, it was so much more. It was your connection, your support and love for each other.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N, I\u2019m gonna cum,\u201d he let you know. He hissed as you tightened around him, rubbing your clit fast as you felt in throb within you,\u00a0\u201cYou feel so good, sugar,\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYeah?,\u201d you ask, lifting his chin so he would make eye contact with you.<br></p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he nodded feverishly, nails digging into your thighs<br></p><p>\u201cThen cum with me, baby,\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>You saw his eyes roll in his head as you pull him close for a kiss. He released your legs and planted his palms against the hood of the car, the bright white standing out against your pale pink dress and beautiful brown skin. He went harder and you sucked his lip into your mouth, biting and sucking, making him grunt before pulling out to jerk himself off and rub your clit, making you two cum together.\u00a0</p><p>All that could be heard was you two panting and the rustling of the leaves. His head rested on your breast as he calmed himself,\u00a0\u201cI love you so much,\u201d he mumbles.</p><p>\u201cAnd I love you, Ant,\u201d he sat up and smiled at you then looked at his wrist watch.<br></p><p>\u201cWe better clean up and get going. We have an RA huddle at 3,\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>You groaned, you hated those things. They were every month and was basically just the reiteration of shit you already knew.\u00a0</p><p>Tony got up and grabbed a pack of wipes and a plastic bag from the glove box. You two took a wipe to clean yourselves up before putting it in the plastic bag to tie it up and throw it in the backseat.\u00a0</p><p>You two got in the car and he started it, slowly pulling away from creek but not before grabbing your hand to plant another kiss on it and speeding away.</p><p>\u2014\u2014-</p><p>\u201cYou all know what to do with items like candles, hot plates, alcohol bottles and what not, correct?,\u201d your Residential Director asks the room full of RA\u2019s<br></p><p>\u201cYes. We take a picture of the item, confiscate it then key into your office and leave it on your desk with a report that details what room we found it in, who lives in said room, what time it was and the name of the RA that confiscated the item and wait for you to give the report to the housing office. Once you receive the go ahead, you will notify us to add the resident to the billing list,\u201d you tell her the steps of the whole process and she nods before moving onto the next subject.\u00a0<br></p><p>Tony had his head leaning against your shoulder as you listened to your RD, he was playing with his pencil, not paying a lick of attention.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnt, you gotta listen,\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSugar, we know this shit already,\u201d he groaned quietly.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, but you know how she is,\u201d<br></p><p>He sighed in annoyance, knowing you were right. He set his pencil down and began paying attention but didn\u2019t lift his head from your shoulder.</p><p>\u201cPlease, please, <i>pleeaase</i>, for the love of Pete, keep up with your residents and HSI\u2019s. I\u2019m quite tired of verifying these long billing lists because your residents didn\u2019t pass their room inspections. I get it, it\u2019s not your fault because you can\u2019t make grown ass people clean up after themselves but their mommy isn\u2019t here to do it for them. They\u2019ll learn once those bills start racking up,\u201d She shrugs nonchalantly and Tony chuckles,\u00a0\u201cLet them know that you\u2019ll only be checking their living areas once a week on your designated inspection day, Monday- Thursday only because HSI billing lists are due every Friday at 11:59 p.m. Let them know they\u2019re in control of the cleanliness of their living areas because if they fail, we don\u2019t reinspect until that next week and failed HSI billings are $500,\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Your RD does not play when it comes to her residential hall, and sometimes you wonder how you and Tony even got jobs as RA\u2019s but you two bust your ass so you\u2019re glad you can still cal yourself once.<br></p><p>Tony grabs your hand to run his thumb over the soft skin and you softly smile as you lean your head against his.</p><p>\u201cYou all have been doing well so far this semester. You all have another floor meeting coming soon. Let your residents know that midterms are coming up and they need to stay on top of everything because we don\u2019t do a second chance program here like other universities if they get below a certain level. Let them know your office hours so they can come to you all for help if they need, or direct them to the tutoring labs because they need a 3.0 to stay on campus. If they drop below that mark they <b><i>will</i></b> be kicked off campus. No if, ands, or buts about it,\u201d she turns off the powerpoint and stands before you in the main lounge of the resident hall and smiles at you all<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m proud of all your work. Your boards are due tomorrow at 11:59. Let\u2019s keep the good work up and make this spring semester a good one, yeah?,\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYes ma\u2019am,\u201d you all answer and she finally lets you guys go. You collect your belongings and Tony leads you out the room, swinging your arm back and forth as he held your hand.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou wanna help me with my bulletin board? My topic is\u00a0\u2018<i>the importance of being clean</i>\u2019 I have all the damn sports kids on this floor, they won\u2019t know what clean is even if it hit them in the face\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAt least yours isn\u2019t the\u00a0\u2018<i>side effects of sitting at your computer for too long</i>\u2019,\u201d he rolls his eyes,\u00a0\u201cI got to put all these facts about eye strain and risks of carpal fucking tunnel and hemorrhoids and how you need to take a ten minute break for every hour you sit at the computer,\u201d you two reach your room and he plops down on your mini couch, watching you pull out a bunch of construction paper and letter stencils.<br></p><p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d he you hand him letter stencils and a big board,\u00a0\u201cBe a helpful fellow RA. Just trace the letters, here\u2019s a lay out,\u201d you hand him another paper so he knows what letters to cut out and how many.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cFine.. but you get to cut and paste the facts about hemorrhoids when we do my board,\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so gross!,\u201d you scroll on your laptop as you sit at your desk and look for pictures to put up on your topic board in the hall.<br></p><p>\u201cRemember, to take a break, sugar. We don\u2019t want any problems with that sweet ass,\u201d he chuckles to himself and you throw a pen at him which only causes him to laugh harder<br></p><p>\u201cNot funny, Ant!,\u201d<br></p><p>\u2014\u2014-</p><p>\u201cI thought we said no expensive dates this semester?,\u201d you scolded him as he pulled up to the restaurant and just laughed at your reaction. He told you to get all dolled up because you two were taking a night out since neither of you were on duty.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cSugar, we say a lot of things like that but when do I ever listen to you?,\u201d he winked at you and got out the car to go to your side and open the door for you,\u00a0\u201cPlus, you said the other day you were sick of the cafeteria food and wanted a taste of real food,\u201d he shrugs.<br></p><p>\u201cAnt!,\u201d you slap his shoulder,\u00a0\u201cI was just talking out into the air. I didn\u2019t even think you were listening because you were studying,\u201d you widen your eyes at him<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my little lady. Of course I\u2019m always listening to you. Now come on, I\u2019m starving,\u201d he takes your hand and leads you into the fancy restaurant and telling the host his last name. The host lead you to an area outside under a pavilion with fairy lights.<br></p><p>\u201cAnthony, this is too much!,\u201d you hiss as he pulls out your chair for you.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so modest. It\u2019s okay to admit you like it,\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI absolutely love it! But you didn\u2019t have to go all out like this,\u201d you hold his hand from across the table.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cBabe, it\u2019s fine really. Now how about you pick up that menu and order something that will be nice to your stomach unlike the campus food,\u201d<br></p><p>You laugh and shake your head at him, picking up the menu.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>You ordered something with lobster in it and whatever it was, it was heaven on a plate. Tony ordered something simple, something he could have gotten anywhere else, fucking spaghetti and meatballs. He claims no one else makes it like this place.</p><p>You drank your virgin mimosa as he drank his disgusting sparkling water.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see how you drink that stuff. It tastes like TV static,\u201d you frown over the rim of your cup.<br></p><p>He gave you a confused smile and continued drinking,\u00a0\u201cAnd I don\u2019t see how you can drink that stuff. It tastes like influenza recovery, all that vitamin c is too much,\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh shut it,\u201d you wave your hand at him and he just stares at you adoringly which, with anyone else, would make them feel great but you felt small when he looked at you like that.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cStop staring,\u201d you whined,\u00a0\u201cYou know I get insecure when people stare,\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBut why?,\u201d he asks surprised as if he hadn\u2019t heard it before. You two had been dating for two years of course he knew why, he just couldn\u2019t <i>understand</i> why. He leaned forward on the table and looked you dead in your eyes.<br></p><p>\u201cYou are so beautiful, I can\u2019t believe I get to call you my girlfriend,\u201d he smiles but your frown just deepens.<br></p><p>\u201c<i>You?</i>,\u201d you softly lay your hands on the table,\u00a0\u201cC\u2019mon man, you\u2019re<i> the</i> Tony Stark. I\u2019m the lucky one. The boy genius loves me. Like I get you\u2019re so much more than that but going to the same University as you was so intimidating, it still is a little bit,\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>He takes both of your hands and squeezes them,\u00a0\u201cYeah you see me as Tony Stark but I\u2019ve always been more than that to you,\u201d his thumbs run the backs of your hands and you get goosebumps,\u00a0\u201cYou see me as so much more than the 15 year old who got accepted into a prestigious university and could have finished at 17 but decided to stay full term. You look past the money, the cars, the big vacation houses, and the labels. You love me for a deeper reason than what everyone wants to be friends with me for,\u201d you see tears glisten in his arms and you awh at him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d you pout,\u00a0\u201cOr else I\u2019m gonna cry and it took a long time to make myself look this good,\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou could cry it all off and I\u2019d still find you gorgeous,\u201d<br></p><p>Your cheeks hurt from smiling so hard and you try to hide your face.</p><p>\u201cAnd you?,\u201d he exasperates,\u00a0\u201cI never want to let you go. You\u2019re so fucking kind and open-minded. You\u2019re so intelligent and you never let anyone dumb you down. You\u2019re an inspiration and don\u2019t even know it,\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>You were about to scoff in his face until you see the look in his eyes. He was dead serious, there was no way he could lie about how he felt about you, it was raw and real and scared you almost because you never saw yourself as someone to be loved in such a way that Tony loves you but you embrace the feeling and it\u2019s warm.</p><p>\u201cDamn you, Stark,\u201d you remove a hand from his grasp and wipe or eyes to keep your liner from running.<br></p><p>The waiter brings you the bill and you go to grab it only for Tony to grab it first and slid his card in it and writing the tip in, handing it back to the waiter whose eyes bulge at the tip before walking away.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you do that? We always split,\u201d you raise a brow at him<br></p><p>\u201cStop questioning me and let me do me,\u201d he straightens his tie and you can\u2019t help but give a little laugh,\u00a0\u201cYou can pay me back by doing my HSI\u2019s,\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWow so that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing now? Blackmailing?,\u201d<br></p><p>He smirked at you and shook is head-</p><p><i>\u201cNot at all, sugar,\u201d</i><br></p><p>\u2014\u2014-</p><p>\u201cI swear guys, it\u2019s really not that hard to keep your rooms clean,\u201d you sigh as you look across the room at your residents. It was your monthly floor meeting and Tony was there with you like always,\u00a0\u201cSome of you have already been fined more than three times already because you\u2019ve failed room inspections. Do you guys know how much the fine is?,\u201d you ask and it might as well be crickets in the room.<br></p><p>\u201cI dunno like.. 50 bucks,\u201d one of your residents shrugs his shoulders, he was the typical dumb ass football player.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAdd 450 bucks to that and that\u2019s your answer,\u201d Tony speaks up and stops spinning in his chair to look at the guy.<br></p><p>\u201c500 fucking bucks just for failing room inspections?!,\u201d one of the softball players speaks up.<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s considered a safety hazard. Most of you live with a roommate and even if you live in a single, you still live in a suite with<i> other</i> people,\u201d you rub your temples,\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s really not that hard to clean up after yourselves. I mean seriously, we\u2019re all adults. There is also a bathroom cleaning schedule on the bathroom doors. Each room in the suite is assigned to a different section of the bathroom every week, whether it be floors, mirrors and sinks, stalls, showers whatever, if it has your room letter by that section for the week, it is your responsibility to clean it. If everyone else in the suite cleans up and you miss your section, they pass, you fail, which is another fine of $500. So if you fail your room inspection <i>and</i> bathroom inspection, that\u2019s already $1000 right there,\u201d<br></p><p>This causes an uproar in the room and everyone is talking and you just roll your eyes,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll wait. I talk over no one,\u201d you pick up your phone and scroll through social media just waiting for them to finish. Tony just laughs and shakes his head at them</p><p>\u201cYou guys always complain you have shit to do but maybe if you shut your mouths and listen we can speed this process up,\u201d Tony calls out. Everyone finally shuts their mouths as they look to him. You lock your phone and place it down and lean forward on the table.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really not understanding the upset. It\u2019s simple. You clean up after yourselves, you don\u2019t get fined. We aren\u2019t your coaches, we aren\u2019t your parents, we are not here to coddle you. We are here to do our job, if you have such a problem with that then go to the housing office to back out of your contract and move off campus,\u201d you roll your eyes once again and Tony puts his arm around the back of your chair to scoot closer to you.<br></p><p>\u201cDoes he always have to be in here?,\u201d one of the baseball players asks.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the SRA. I can be wherever I want, when I want and come and go as I please. Since it\u2019s my job to look after the regular RA\u2019s and all residents, I can oversee these meetings. Now how about you just shut that mouth and listen,\u201d<br></p><p><i>\u201cYou clearly do more than look after her,\u201d</i><br></p><p>\u201cMore than you can say about your girl, Tyler. Still with Izzy after she slept with your teammate or no?,\u201d Tony places the pencil behind his ear and props his feet on the table that you two are sitting at in the front of the lounge. He has a smug grin and you can see Tyler\u2019s face turn red under his caramel skin.<br></p><p>\u201cAnthony,\u201d you slapped his arm and scolded him but he just laughed as you went back to talking about the topics from your list.<br></p><p>\u201cThis is just a reiteration that items like candles, hot plates, blenders, boilers, those little George Foreman grills are prohibited and if they are found they will be confiscated and you will be fined,\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Another wave of complaining flooded the room and Tony slammed his hands on the table,\u00a0\u201cWhat is up with you all and always complaining? Shut the hell up,\u201d he groaned,\u00a0\u201cIf you have that much of a problem with the rules, do as Y/N said and move off campus. Get one of those campus apartments down the street. Oh wait,\u201d he taps his chin,\u00a0\u201cYou can\u2019t because you\u2019re just freshmen and sophomores,\u201d\u00a0</p><p>One of your residents is still complaining and you\u2019ve had just about enough,\u00a0\u201cSierra, please for the love of God be quiet. Your Bath and Body Works Japanese Cherry Blossom candle gives me a fucking headache and is played out anyway. Grow up,\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Her jaw drops and you take a deep breath to calm yourself a bit.</p><p>\u201cThese rules were in the handbook you received before you even came here. If you\u2019re returning sophomores I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re acting so surprised. You know all of this. I did not make the rules, I just implement them because it\u2019s my job to,\u201d<br></p><p>You continue to talk about how midterms are coming up and how they need to stay on top of things to be able to be eligible to stay on campus. You talk about how if they miss a floor meeting, they will be fined, not as much but fined regardless. You answer a few questions and begin calling them up by suites to sign the floor meeting check in paper.</p><p>\u201cAnd finally, suite 301,\u201d you call out and the baseball suite comes up and Tyler is still scowling at Tony. They never liked each other anyway, Tony didn\u2019t have a problem with the poor sophomore until he found him trying to hit on you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou can frown like a three year old all you want. It won\u2019t change anything,\u201d Tony looked at him completely unamused and Tyler just signed his name practically throwing the pen at you in which Tony stood up and yanked him back by the collar of his baseball jersey.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow about we rewind and you hand her the pen before I throw <i>you</i>, yeah?,\u201d Tony dragged him back to the front of the table and handed Tyler the pen so he can\u00a0\u201ctry again\u201d</p><p>Tyler huffs and hands you the pen which you softly take from him,\u00a0\u201cRemember, room checks are every Tuesday 6pm-8pm. If it\u2019s not clean I won\u2019t feel bad for failing you,\u201d<br></p><p>He just walks out of the floor lounge and you paper clip all your papers and turn to Tony.</p><p>\u201cWhy did I let you talk me into applying for this job, babe? They\u2019re absolutely insufferable,\u201d you whine and rest your head on his shoulder which he kisses.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIt will get better as you move up. As they get older the easier it will get,\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky you have all the older techy- sciency people. I bet you never hear a peep out of them,\u201d you two walk back to your room and he climbs on your bed, kicking his shoes off, as you put the sign in sheet in a manila folder to place in your RD\u2019s office.<br></p><p>\u201cOnly when they\u2019re not fighting on whether Akali\u2019s or Kai\u2019Sa\u2019s attacks are better,\u201d<br></p><p>You turn around to frown at him and scrunch your face up in confusion,\u00a0\u201cWho?,\u201d</p><p>Tony just waves his hand at you,\u00a0\u201cGamer stuff,\u201d he takes his shirt off and waves you over to him,\u00a0\u201cBut like you said, they\u2019re tech and science nerds so their rooms are also trash bins. With all that mellow yellow, cheese puffs and tissues littered everywhere covered in only God knows what,\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You kick your shoes off as well and climb on your bed to straddle him,\u00a0\u201cAnd to think you want me to do your HSI\u2019s this week. You set me up,\u201d you slapped his chest, the spot turning red automatically.\u00a0</p><p>He hissed and turned you over, pinning you down under him,\u00a0\u201cSay sorry,\u201d his nose was touching yours as he clenched his teeth.</p><p>\u201cMake me,\u201d you leaned forward and your lips touched his as you spoke.<br></p><p>\u201cOh we\u2019re gonna play this game now? That\u2019s cool,\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>He got off the bed to lock your door and jumped back on to remove your jeans. You didn\u2019t even protest, you knew he\u2019d win and you wanted him to win. You feel the material rub against your skin and the warm metal of the zipper tracks scratch your skin a bit.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSugar, say sorry,\u201d he didn\u2019t even bother removing your panties, he had a thing for fucking you with them on and you just let him have his fun. He laid flat on his stomach and moved your panties to the side to lick a small circle around your clit.<br></p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d you were still keeping up with this game and Tony had no problem with it. He kissed and nipped at your thighs and you tried to jerk away but he shook his head at you, eyes telling you to keep still.\u00a0<br></p><p>Once his entire mouth covered you, your hands tangled themselves in his hair as a default. His tongue was so warm and wet against you, your clit started throbbing for more and he knew that. It was almost like he could feel the little heart beat against the tip of his tongue. He takes his time, any other time it\u2019s rushed and intense. But he makes sure to give your pussy all types of kisses and love.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnt,\u201d you whined quietly, and looked down at him to find he was already staring back up at you. He wanted you to apologize, it was just a small slap but he wanted you to apologize just to tease you, knowing you would playfully be stubborn which would turn into this exact situation.<br></p><p>\u201cLook at you,\u201d he pulled back, lips glistening and wet but eyes not moving from yours as his thumb swirled around your wet clit, he sucks his lip into his mouth and you just caress his cheek, adoring the view of him between your legs,\u00a0\u201cMaybe if you just say sorry I\u2019ll let you cum,\u201d<br></p><p>He pushes two fingers in and starts going at a fast pace. He moves to lay beside you, placing your leg over one of his as he whispers in your ear and finger fucking you,\u00a0\u201cJust say sorry like a good girl and I\u2019ll let you cum, sugar,\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He curls his fingers and you feel the pleasure spread down to your toes and you find yourself wrapping your arms around the one he was using on you and hid in his chest, trying your best not to be loud.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnt, please,\u201d your voice was muffled and he just smiled at you, moving his fingers harder then slowed them down again, teasing you and you knew he was doing that just so he could win, though he always won, you liked putting up a fight. The obscene squelching of his fingers moving in and out of you filled the room and could most likely be heard from the other side of the door, it was that loud and you were <i>that</i> wet.<br></p><p>\u201cGo ahead, sugar. Say sorry,\u201d<br></p><p>You dug your fingernails into his flesh and planted your feet onto the bed to get a better angle to be able to buck your hips up. Tony stopped his motions to watch you fuck yourself on his fingers.</p><p>\u201cBaby, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d you called out louder than intended but he didn\u2019t protest.<br></p><p>\u201cGo ahead and get yourself off on my fingers,\u201d his voice had dropped as he spoke directly into your ear,\u00a0\u201cThanks for apologizing,\u201d his tone was teasing and instigating. He won and that\u2019s all Tony ever wants when you play, he wanted to win.<br></p><p>\u201cBabyyyy,\u201d your nails dug deeper and he shushed you.<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so loud, don\u2019t wanna get interrupted before you even get a chance to cum, do you?,\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNoooo,\u201d you looked up from his chest to see him smiling down at you, fingers curling up, tapping your sweet spot, making your eyes roll back in your head. You heard a deep groan resonate within his chest and that\u2019s your undoing. You hold onto his forearm and rode yourself on his fingers, finally cumming. Your mouth fell open, ready to moan out into the quiet room, until Tony stuck his tongue in your mouth, kissing you deep with you following along.<br></p><p>He feels his fingers become wetter from your cum and he kisses you harder. Fingers still moving within you to ride out your climax. You pull away from his lips with a gasp, his lips red and yours tingling, tongue savoring the taste of yourself as Tony stares down at you in adoration.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re staring again,\u201d you hide yourself in his chest again, while he\u2019s still in you.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not apologizing for staring at my girlfriend,\u201d he moves back to be able to look at you once again,\u00a0\u201cPlus, you\u2019re cute when you cum. I mean, you\u2019re always cute but when you cum it\u2019s a different kind of cute,\u201d He finally pulls his fingers out and sucks them, making sure you\u2019re looking him in his eyes as he does so.<br></p><p>He was so dirty, and you loved it. A perfect, educated young man to everyone else but you knew the real him. You pulled his fingers out his lips to kiss him once again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky I like you enough to let you win,\u201d<br></p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2013</p><p>\u201cWant anything from the vending machine?,\u201d Tony asks. It was a late night in the library and you two occupied a study room so you two could focus without being surrounded by the other loud students.<br></p><p>\u201cJust a water and some Twizzlers if they have them. If not, cheez-its,\u201d you spare him a glance and a kiss before he leaves and turned back to your delinquency control and prevention textbook. You sat quietly as you highlighted the important theories that your professor said to focus on and stressed in class.<br></p><p>He wasn\u2019t gone for long and he came back with his arms almost full, mostly being snacks for him. He hands you a water and a pack of Twizzlers along with cheez-it.</p><p>\u201cBabe, I said, either or,\u201d you took a sip of the water,<br></p><p>\u201cAnd I decided on either <i>and</i> or,\u201d he sat back in his chair and opened a bag of chips, popping a few in his mouth and winking at you<br></p><p>\u201cThank you either way, Ant,\u201d you kiss his cheek before sitting back and taking a break to munch on your snacks. You two were sitting in comfortable silence when he hands you your glasses case.</p><p>\u201cI have my contacts in,\u201d you point to your eyes. He sucks his teeth and rolls his eyes.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah and you\u2019re starting to blink a lot faster, meaning your eyes are getting dry. Meaning it\u2019s time to take them out which means\u2026 put your damn glasses on,\u201d he laughs at you while dusting off his hands and putting on hand sanitizer to take them out for you. You hated touching your own eyes and as backwards as it seems, you preferred Tony to do it. So every morning he would put them in for you and every night he would take them out.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI hate wearing them,\u201d you mumbled.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t you know you\u2019ll get a headache,\u201d He stands over you and holds your eyes open as he takes them out one by one and adding a drop of eye drops to lubricate your eyes and placing your glasses on your face. You pushed them up on the bridge of your nose and Tony almost audibly cooed at how fucking cute that was. He throws your contacts away and sits back down beside you, rubbing you back of your neck to help you release some of the tension you hold there as you study.<br></p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s stay for another half hour and we turn in for the night, yeah?,\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>You wanted to protest, but you knew you two needed sleep. You had to wake up early as hell to do a lock out for a resident who locked his key in his room and Tony was woken up by a phone call to do a mediation for his residents who ended up fighting in the wee hours and woken up their suite-mates so you both had an early start to your day.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay sounds good,\u201d you nod, biting a Twizzler and turning back to your book. Tony just watched you. He watched the way you swung the Twizzler around as you were deep into the context of your textbook. The way you swung your foot back and forth and played with your curls as you didn\u2019t understand a theory and had to re read it a few times.\u00a0<br></p><p>Soon it was time to go back to the dorms and Tony helped you back your stuff up and piggybacked you to the car as you were tired and sleep finally started to hit you. He placed both of your belongs in the front seat and laid you down in the back seat, using the middle seat belt to strap you in.\u00a0</p><p>He never drove so carefully, avoiding all the potholes so you he wouldn\u2019t wake you up, braking easily when he came up on a red light and left the radio off.</p><p>\u00a0When you were both back to the dorms he placed both of your bags on his shoulders and carried you bridal style. You easily curled up into him, knowing it was him. He swiped his ID to get into the building and no one asked questions as to why he was carrying you. You were his lady so it was to be expected, especially since you were asleep.</p><p>Even though you just lived on the third floor and usually take the stairs, he took the elevator for a smooth ride. He used his master key to get into your room, not wanting to wake you up to get your key out of your bag. He softly laid you on the bed and undressed you to get you dressed in your night clothes which was really just a pair of his gym shorts and band tee of his. He searched around in the dark for your bonnet, knowing if he turned on the light it would wake you up. He tiredly stumbled over your shoe and looked back to you in fear that the loud noise had woken you up, but when he found you still sleeping he continued his quest. He found it hanging in your top dresser drawer and kicked his shoes off to strip down to his briefs and crawl in bed with you. He had situated you by the wall, knowing you have a habit of falling off the bed and softly raised your head to place the bonnet completely on it and rested your head back on your pillow.\u00a0</p><p>He was glad you went with a bare face today or else it\u2019d be hell trying to get the make up off without trying to wake you up. He removed your glasses, placing them on your desk and kissed your forehead and and pulled you close to him. You nuzzled into his neck and hummed.\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cStrain theory is the theory that states that social structures within society may pressure citizens to commit crime,\u201d </i>you mumble in your sleep and he tries not to laugh at how cute it was<br></p><p>\u201cI love you so much,\u201d he whispered as he leaned his cheek on yours, eyes finally fluttering closed as he embraced sleep.<br></p><p><i>\u201cI love you more, Ant,\u201d</i><br></p><p><i>\u2014\u2014\u2013</i></p><p><b>I LOVED THIS REQUEST SO MUCH OMFG!!

I\u2019m calling campus police!!,\u201d you reached for your phone but he snatched it up before you and started to run around your dorm room.

This helped you during exams, it was so easy to remember because all you had to do was flashback to him between your legs and what tactics he did to help you remember that specific question.</p><p>He ran his hands up and down your bare thighs as you just wore is MIT shirt, staring at your clothed heat,\u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s <i>ad damnum</i>?,\u201d he looked at your book and quickly read the definition.</p><p>You closed your eyes and slowly inhaled,\u00a0\u201cAd damnum\u2026 refers to the parts or sections of a petition that speaks to the damages that were suffered and claimed by the plaintiff,\u201d you exhale as you feel Tony rub his thumb against your clit.</p><p>\u201cWhat about <i>ad litem</i>?,\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>You have to think about this one for a bit, there were so many A terms you had to remember it was easy to mix up.</p><p>\u201cUuuuuh,\u201d you hesitate,\u00a0\u201c<i>For the purpose of the lawsuit</i>,\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cMm, you sure about that one,\u201d he asks unsure.

What\u2019s <i>Voir Dire</i> mean?,\u201d he groaned as he snapped his hips. You had your head buried in his neck, moaning as quietly as you could so you wouldn\u2019t wake your residents. You struggled to answer, not because you didn\u2019t know the answer but because it felt like he was in your guts and the feeling was overwhelming you,\u00a0\u201cCome on, sugar. I know you know it,\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThe\u2026 the french phrase m-meaning..\u201d you gasped as he snapped his hips particularly hard and bit your collarbone\u00a0\u201cMeaning.. <i>to speak the truth</i>,\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201c<i>That\u2019s it</i>,\u201d he praises and goes harder, making you wrap your legs around him tightly.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll ace that exam tomorrow, baby,\u201d he kisses you and encourages you to cum as he feels himself about to let go as well,\u00a0\u201cCum for me, sugar,\u201d<br></p><p>You bit his shoulder as you feel yourself cumming around him, trying hard not to moan out into the silent room.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d he whispers as he pulls out and cums on your stomach, using a small hand towel to clean you up. You see stars as you stare up at the ceiling.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll do great tomorrow. When has our method ever failed you?,\u201d<br></p><p>\u2014\u2014-</p><p>You were one of the few people in the class of a hundred something to absolutely and completely ace the exam, like Tony said. You rushed out of the building to find Tony waiting on the hood of his car for you. You ran to him with your scantron in your hand.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe did it! we did it!,\u201d you showed him your scantron and he picked you up, spinning you around and planting kisses on your cheeks.<br></p><p>\u201c<i>You</i> did it!,\u201d he corrects as he puts you down. Everyone around stared at you two, they always do. It was because of Tony, everyone knew Tony, he was the boy genius. He first got here when he was 15 and was about to graduate while you were only a sophomore, despite being the same age.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cBut you helped!,\u201d you wave the paper,\u00a0\u201cWithout you, I would have bombed that exam,\u201d you tell him as he leads you to your side of his expensive ass car. This thing was worth your tuition times like\u2026 three if not more than that, who knows, you weren\u2019t a damn math major.<br></p><p>\u201cWhere we headed?,\u201d you ask as he walks around to his side. The hood was down, the day was nice, he wanted to go for a drive.<br></p><p>\u201cOur little spot by the creek. Want to treat this really smart girl who aced her extremely hard exam today,\u201d<br></p><p>Your face gets hot as you look down at your scantron and smile at the big red numbers that read\u00a0\u201c100\u2033, that exam was damn near two hundred questions and you and Tony barely went through half of the material last night, but you went through the ones you needed and that was enough.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll appreciate it,\u201d you held his hand as the wind kissed your scalp and ran its fingers through your tight curls,\u00a0\u201cShe loves the support system she has,\u201d<br></p><p>He kissed your hand and looked at you over his sunglasses to wink at you, you gave him one right back. He turned up the radio and you two sang along to your song that just so happened to be playing at the perfect time.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>Your dress was hiked up as Tony stood between your legs and fucked you on the hood of his car. You held onto his jacket as he held your legs under your knees and fucked you into oblivion.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou feel so good, Ant!,\u201d you could finally be as loud as you wanted. Your spot at the creek was secluded and never got an visitors.<br></p><p>You two always did this after either of you did well on an exam. It honestly made you feel more special than any grade ever could. Tony made you feel things that no amount of perfect scores ever could, it wasn\u2019t just the sex, it was so much more. It was your connection, your support and love for each other.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N, I\u2019m gonna cum,\u201d he let you know. He hissed as you tightened around him, rubbing your clit fast as you felt in throb within you,\u00a0\u201cYou feel so good, sugar,\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYeah?,\u201d you ask, lifting his chin so he would make eye contact with you.<br></p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he nodded feverishly, nails digging into your thighs<br></p><p>\u201cThen cum with me, baby,\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>You saw his eyes roll in his head as you pull him close for a kiss. He released your legs and planted his palms against the hood of the car, the bright white standing out against your pale pink dress and beautiful brown skin. He went harder and you sucked his lip into your mouth, biting and sucking, making him grunt before pulling out to jerk himself off and rub your clit, making you two cum together.\u00a0</p><p>All that could be heard was you two panting and the rustling of the leaves. His head rested on your breast as he calmed himself,\u00a0\u201cI love you so much,\u201d he mumbles.</p><p>\u201cAnd I love you, Ant,\u201d he sat up and smiled at you then looked at his wrist watch.<br></p><p>\u201cWe better clean up and get going. We have an RA huddle at 3,\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>You groaned, you hated those things. They were every month and was basically just the reiteration of shit you already knew.\u00a0</p><p>Tony got up and grabbed a pack of wipes and a plastic bag from the glove box. You two took a wipe to clean yourselves up before putting it in the plastic bag to tie it up and throw it in the backseat.\u00a0</p><p>You two got in the car and he started it, slowly pulling away from creek but not before grabbing your hand to plant another kiss on it and speeding away.</p><p>\u2014\u2014-</p><p>\u201cYou all know what to do with items like candles, hot plates, alcohol bottles and what not, correct?,\u201d your Residential Director asks the room full of RA\u2019s<br></p><p>\u201cYes. We take a picture of the item, confiscate it then key into your office and leave it on your desk with a report that details what room we found it in, who lives in said room, what time it was and the name of the RA that confiscated the item and wait for you to give the report to the housing office. Once you receive the go ahead, you will notify us to add the resident to the billing list,\u201d you tell her the steps of the whole process and she nods before moving onto the next subject.\u00a0<br></p><p>Tony had his head leaning against your shoulder as you listened to your RD, he was playing with his pencil, not paying a lick of attention.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnt, you gotta listen,\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSugar, we know this shit already,\u201d he groaned quietly.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, but you know how she is,\u201d<br></p><p>He sighed in annoyance, knowing you were right. He set his pencil down and began paying attention but didn\u2019t lift his head from your shoulder.</p><p>\u201cPlease, please, <i>pleeaase</i>, for the love of Pete, keep up with your residents and HSI\u2019s. I\u2019m quite tired of verifying these long billing lists because your residents didn\u2019t pass their room inspections. I get it, it\u2019s not your fault because you can\u2019t make grown ass people clean up after themselves but their mommy isn\u2019t here to do it for them. They\u2019ll learn once those bills start racking up,\u201d She shrugs nonchalantly and Tony chuckles,\u00a0\u201cLet them know that you\u2019ll only be checking their living areas once a week on your designated inspection day, Monday- Thursday only because HSI billing lists are due every Friday at 11:59 p.m. Let them know they\u2019re in control of the cleanliness of their living areas because if they fail, we don\u2019t reinspect until that next week and failed HSI billings are $500,\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Your RD does not play when it comes to her residential hall, and sometimes you wonder how you and Tony even got jobs as RA\u2019s but you two bust your ass so you\u2019re glad you can still cal yourself once.<br></p><p>Tony grabs your hand to run his thumb over the soft skin and you softly smile as you lean your head against his.</p><p>\u201cYou all have been doing well so far this semester. You all have another floor meeting coming soon. Let your residents know that midterms are coming up and they need to stay on top of everything because we don\u2019t do a second chance program here like other universities if they get below a certain level. Let them know your office hours so they can come to you all for help if they need, or direct them to the tutoring labs because they need a 3.0 to stay on campus. If they drop below that mark they <b><i>will</i></b> be kicked off campus. No if, ands, or buts about it,\u201d she turns off the powerpoint and stands before you in the main lounge of the resident hall and smiles at you all<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m proud of all your work. Your boards are due tomorrow at 11:59. Let\u2019s keep the good work up and make this spring semester a good one, yeah?,\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYes ma\u2019am,\u201d you all answer and she finally lets you guys go. You collect your belongings and Tony leads you out the room, swinging your arm back and forth as he held your hand.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou wanna help me with my bulletin board? My topic is\u00a0\u2018<i>the importance of being clean</i>\u2019 I have all the damn sports kids on this floor, they won\u2019t know what clean is even if it hit them in the face\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAt least yours isn\u2019t the\u00a0\u2018<i>side effects of sitting at your computer for too long</i>\u2019,\u201d he rolls his eyes,\u00a0\u201cI got to put all these facts about eye strain and risks of carpal fucking tunnel and hemorrhoids and how you need to take a ten minute break for every hour you sit at the computer,\u201d you two reach your room and he plops down on your mini couch, watching you pull out a bunch of construction paper and letter stencils.<br></p><p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d he you hand him letter stencils and a big board,\u00a0\u201cBe a helpful fellow RA. Just trace the letters, here\u2019s a lay out,\u201d you hand him another paper so he knows what letters to cut out and how many.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cFine.. but you get to cut and paste the facts about hemorrhoids when we do my board,\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so gross!,\u201d you scroll on your laptop as you sit at your desk and look for pictures to put up on your topic board in the hall.<br></p><p>\u201cRemember, to take a break, sugar. We don\u2019t want any problems with that sweet ass,\u201d he chuckles to himself and you throw a pen at him which only causes him to laugh harder<br></p><p>\u201cNot funny, Ant!,\u201d<br></p><p>\u2014\u2014-</p><p>\u201cI thought we said no expensive dates this semester?,\u201d you scolded him as he pulled up to the restaurant and just laughed at your reaction. He told you to get all dolled up because you two were taking a night out since neither of you were on duty.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cSugar, we say a lot of things like that but when do I ever listen to you?,\u201d he winked at you and got out the car to go to your side and open the door for you,\u00a0\u201cPlus, you said the other day you were sick of the cafeteria food and wanted a taste of real food,\u201d he shrugs.<br></p><p>\u201cAnt!,\u201d you slap his shoulder,\u00a0\u201cI was just talking out into the air. I didn\u2019t even think you were listening because you were studying,\u201d you widen your eyes at him<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my little lady. Of course I\u2019m always listening to you. Now come on, I\u2019m starving,\u201d he takes your hand and leads you into the fancy restaurant and telling the host his last name. The host lead you to an area outside under a pavilion with fairy lights.<br></p><p>\u201cAnthony, this is too much!,\u201d you hiss as he pulls out your chair for you.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so modest. It\u2019s okay to admit you like it,\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI absolutely love it! But you didn\u2019t have to go all out like this,\u201d you hold his hand from across the table.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cBabe, it\u2019s fine really. Now how about you pick up that menu and order something that will be nice to your stomach unlike the campus food,\u201d<br></p><p>You laugh and shake your head at him, picking up the menu.</p><p>\u2013</p><p>You ordered something with lobster in it and whatever it was, it was heaven on a plate. Tony ordered something simple, something he could have gotten anywhere else, fucking spaghetti and meatballs. He claims no one else makes it like this place.</p><p>You drank your virgin mimosa as he drank his disgusting sparkling water.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see how you drink that stuff. It tastes like TV static,\u201d you frown over the rim of your cup.<br></p><p>He gave you a confused smile and continued drinking,\u00a0\u201cAnd I don\u2019t see how you can drink that stuff. It tastes like influenza recovery, all that vitamin c is too much,\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh shut it,\u201d you wave your hand at him and he just stares at you adoringly which, with anyone else, would make them feel great but you felt small when he looked at you like that.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cStop staring,\u201d you whined,\u00a0\u201cYou know I get insecure when people stare,\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBut why?,\u201d he asks surprised as if he hadn\u2019t heard it before. You two had been dating for two years of course he knew why, he just couldn\u2019t <i>understand</i> why. He leaned forward on the table and looked you dead in your eyes.<br></p><p>\u201cYou are so beautiful, I can\u2019t believe I get to call you my girlfriend,\u201d he smiles but your frown just deepens.<br></p><p>\u201c<i>You?</i>,\u201d you softly lay your hands on the table,\u00a0\u201cC\u2019mon man, you\u2019re<i> the</i> Tony Stark. I\u2019m the lucky one. The boy genius loves me. Like I get you\u2019re so much more than that but going to the same University as you was so intimidating, it still is a little bit,\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>He takes both of your hands and squeezes them,\u00a0\u201cYeah you see me as Tony Stark but I\u2019ve always been more than that to you,\u201d his thumbs run the backs of your hands and you get goosebumps,\u00a0\u201cYou see me as so much more than the 15 year old who got accepted into a prestigious university and could have finished at 17 but decided to stay full term. You look past the money, the cars, the big vacation houses, and the labels. You love me for a deeper reason than what everyone wants to be friends with me for,\u201d you see tears glisten in his arms and you awh at him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d you pout,\u00a0\u201cOr else I\u2019m gonna cry and it took a long time to make myself look this good,\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou could cry it all off and I\u2019d still find you gorgeous,\u201d<br></p><p>Your cheeks hurt from smiling so hard and you try to hide your face.</p><p>\u201cAnd you?,\u201d he exasperates,\u00a0\u201cI never want to let you go. You\u2019re so fucking kind and open-minded. You\u2019re so intelligent and you never let anyone dumb you down. You\u2019re an inspiration and don\u2019t even know it,\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>You were about to scoff in his face until you see the look in his eyes. He was dead serious, there was no way he could lie about how he felt about you, it was raw and real and scared you almost because you never saw yourself as someone to be loved in such a way that Tony loves you but you embrace the feeling and it\u2019s warm.</p><p>\u201cDamn you, Stark,\u201d you remove a hand from his grasp and wipe or eyes to keep your liner from running.<br></p><p>The waiter brings you the bill and you go to grab it only for Tony to grab it first and slid his card in it and writing the tip in, handing it back to the waiter whose eyes bulge at the tip before walking away.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you do that? We always split,\u201d you raise a brow at him<br></p><p>\u201cStop questioning me and let me do me,\u201d he straightens his tie and you can\u2019t help but give a little laugh,\u00a0\u201cYou can pay me back by doing my HSI\u2019s,\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWow so that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing now? Blackmailing?,\u201d<br></p><p>He smirked at you and shook is head-</p><p><i>\u201cNot at all, sugar,\u201d</i><br></p><p>\u2014\u2014-</p><p>\u201cI swear guys, it\u2019s really not that hard to keep your rooms clean,\u201d you sigh as you look across the room at your residents. It was your monthly floor meeting and Tony was there with you like always,\u00a0\u201cSome of you have already been fined more than three times already because you\u2019ve failed room inspections. Do you guys know how much the fine is?,\u201d you ask and it might as well be crickets in the room.<br></p><p>\u201cI dunno like.. 50 bucks,\u201d one of your residents shrugs his shoulders, he was the typical dumb ass football player.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAdd 450 bucks to that and that\u2019s your answer,\u201d Tony speaks up and stops spinning in his chair to look at the guy.<br></p><p>\u201c500 fucking bucks just for failing room inspections?!,\u201d one of the softball players speaks up.<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s considered a safety hazard. Most of you live with a roommate and even if you live in a single, you still live in a suite with<i> other</i> people,\u201d you rub your temples,\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s really not that hard to clean up after yourselves. I mean seriously, we\u2019re all adults. There is also a bathroom cleaning schedule on the bathroom doors. Each room in the suite is assigned to a different section of the bathroom every week, whether it be floors, mirrors and sinks, stalls, showers whatever, if it has your room letter by that section for the week, it is your responsibility to clean it. If everyone else in the suite cleans up and you miss your section, they pass, you fail, which is another fine of $500. So if you fail your room inspection <i>and</i> bathroom inspection, that\u2019s already $1000 right there,\u201d<br></p><p>This causes an uproar in the room and everyone is talking and you just roll your eyes,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll wait. I talk over no one,\u201d you pick up your phone and scroll through social media just waiting for them to finish. Tony just laughs and shakes his head at them</p><p>\u201cYou guys always complain you have shit to do but maybe if you shut your mouths and listen we can speed this process up,\u201d Tony calls out. Everyone finally shuts their mouths as they look to him. You lock your phone and place it down and lean forward on the table.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really not understanding the upset. It\u2019s simple. You clean up after yourselves, you don\u2019t get fined. We aren\u2019t your coaches, we aren\u2019t your parents, we are not here to coddle you. We are here to do our job, if you have such a problem with that then go to the housing office to back out of your contract and move off campus,\u201d you roll your eyes once again and Tony puts his arm around the back of your chair to scoot closer to you.<br></p><p>\u201cDoes he always have to be in here?,\u201d one of the baseball players asks.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the SRA. I can be wherever I want, when I want and come and go as I please. Since it\u2019s my job to look after the regular RA\u2019s and all residents, I can oversee these meetings. Now how about you just shut that mouth and listen,\u201d<br></p><p><i>\u201cYou clearly do more than look after her,\u201d</i><br></p><p>\u201cMore than you can say about your girl, Tyler. Still with Izzy after she slept with your teammate or no?,\u201d Tony places the pencil behind his ear and props his feet on the table that you two are sitting at in the front of the lounge. He has a smug grin and you can see Tyler\u2019s face turn red under his caramel skin.<br></p><p>\u201cAnthony,\u201d you slapped his arm and scolded him but he just laughed as you went back to talking about the topics from your list.<br></p><p>\u201cThis is just a reiteration that items like candles, hot plates, blenders, boilers, those little George Foreman grills are prohibited and if they are found they will be confiscated and you will be fined,\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Another wave of complaining flooded the room and Tony slammed his hands on the table,\u00a0\u201cWhat is up with you all and always complaining? Shut the hell up,\u201d he groaned,\u00a0\u201cIf you have that much of a problem with the rules, do as Y/N said and move off campus. Get one of those campus apartments down the street. Oh wait,\u201d he taps his chin,\u00a0\u201cYou can\u2019t because you\u2019re just freshmen and sophomores,\u201d\u00a0</p><p>One of your residents is still complaining and you\u2019ve had just about enough,\u00a0\u201cSierra, please for the love of God be quiet. Your Bath and Body Works Japanese Cherry Blossom candle gives me a fucking headache and is played out anyway. Grow up,\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Her jaw drops and you take a deep breath to calm yourself a bit.</p><p>\u201cThese rules were in the handbook you received before you even came here. If you\u2019re returning sophomores I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re acting so surprised. You know all of this. I did not make the rules, I just implement them because it\u2019s my job to,\u201d<br></p><p>You continue to talk about how midterms are coming up and how they need to stay on top of things to be able to be eligible to stay on campus. You talk about how if they miss a floor meeting, they will be fined, not as much but fined regardless. You answer a few questions and begin calling them up by suites to sign the floor meeting check in paper.</p><p>\u201cAnd finally, suite 301,\u201d you call out and the baseball suite comes up and Tyler is still scowling at Tony. They never liked each other anyway, Tony didn\u2019t have a problem with the poor sophomore until he found him trying to hit on you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou can frown like a three year old all you want. It won\u2019t change anything,\u201d Tony looked at him completely unamused and Tyler just signed his name practically throwing the pen at you in which Tony stood up and yanked him back by the collar of his baseball jersey.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow about we rewind and you hand her the pen before I throw <i>you</i>, yeah?,\u201d Tony dragged him back to the front of the table and handed Tyler the pen so he can\u00a0\u201ctry again\u201d</p><p>Tyler huffs and hands you the pen which you softly take from him,\u00a0\u201cRemember, room checks are every Tuesday 6pm-8pm. If it\u2019s not clean I won\u2019t feel bad for failing you,\u201d<br></p><p>He just walks out of the floor lounge and you paper clip all your papers and turn to Tony.</p><p>\u201cWhy did I let you talk me into applying for this job, babe? They\u2019re absolutely insufferable,\u201d you whine and rest your head on his shoulder which he kisses.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIt will get better as you move up. As they get older the easier it will get,\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky you have all the older techy- sciency people. I bet you never hear a peep out of them,\u201d you two walk back to your room and he climbs on your bed, kicking his shoes off, as you put the sign in sheet in a manila folder to place in your RD\u2019s office.<br></p><p>\u201cOnly when they\u2019re not fighting on whether Akali\u2019s or Kai\u2019Sa\u2019s attacks are better,\u201d<br></p><p>You turn around to frown at him and scrunch your face up in confusion,\u00a0\u201cWho?,\u201d</p><p>Tony just waves his hand at you,\u00a0\u201cGamer stuff,\u201d he takes his shirt off and waves you over to him,\u00a0\u201cBut like you said, they\u2019re tech and science nerds so their rooms are also trash bins. With all that mellow yellow, cheese puffs and tissues littered everywhere covered in only God knows what,\u201d\u00a0</p><p>You kick your shoes off as well and climb on your bed to straddle him,\u00a0\u201cAnd to think you want me to do your HSI\u2019s this week. You set me up,\u201d you slapped his chest, the spot turning red automatically.\u00a0</p><p>He hissed and turned you over, pinning you down under him,\u00a0\u201cSay sorry,\u201d his nose was touching yours as he clenched his teeth.</p><p>\u201cMake me,\u201d you leaned forward and your lips touched his as you spoke.<br></p><p>\u201cOh we\u2019re gonna play this game now? That\u2019s cool,\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>He got off the bed to lock your door and jumped back on to remove your jeans. You didn\u2019t even protest, you knew he\u2019d win and you wanted him to win. You feel the material rub against your skin and the warm metal of the zipper tracks scratch your skin a bit.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSugar, say sorry,\u201d he didn\u2019t even bother removing your panties, he had a thing for fucking you with them on and you just let him have his fun. He laid flat on his stomach and moved your panties to the side to lick a small circle around your clit.<br></p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d you were still keeping up with this game and Tony had no problem with it. He kissed and nipped at your thighs and you tried to jerk away but he shook his head at you, eyes telling you to keep still.\u00a0<br></p><p>Once his entire mouth covered you, your hands tangled themselves in his hair as a default. His tongue was so warm and wet against you, your clit started throbbing for more and he knew that. It was almost like he could feel the little heart beat against the tip of his tongue. He takes his time, any other time it\u2019s rushed and intense. But he makes sure to give your pussy all types of kisses and love.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnt,\u201d you whined quietly, and looked down at him to find he was already staring back up at you. He wanted you to apologize, it was just a small slap but he wanted you to apologize just to tease you, knowing you would playfully be stubborn which would turn into this exact situation.<br></p><p>\u201cLook at you,\u201d he pulled back, lips glistening and wet but eyes not moving from yours as his thumb swirled around your wet clit, he sucks his lip into his mouth and you just caress his cheek, adoring the view of him between your legs,\u00a0\u201cMaybe if you just say sorry I\u2019ll let you cum,\u201d<br></p><p>He pushes two fingers in and starts going at a fast pace. He moves to lay beside you, placing your leg over one of his as he whispers in your ear and finger fucking you,\u00a0\u201cJust say sorry like a good girl and I\u2019ll let you cum, sugar,\u201d\u00a0</p><p>He curls his fingers and you feel the pleasure spread down to your toes and you find yourself wrapping your arms around the one he was using on you and hid in his chest, trying your best not to be loud.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnt, please,\u201d your voice was muffled and he just smiled at you, moving his fingers harder then slowed them down again, teasing you and you knew he was doing that just so he could win, though he always won, you liked putting up a fight. The obscene squelching of his fingers moving in and out of you filled the room and could most likely be heard from the other side of the door, it was that loud and you were <i>that</i> wet.<br></p><p>\u201cGo ahead, sugar. Say sorry,\u201d<br></p><p>You dug your fingernails into his flesh and planted your feet onto the bed to get a better angle to be able to buck your hips up. Tony stopped his motions to watch you fuck yourself on his fingers.</p><p>\u201cBaby, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d you called out louder than intended but he didn\u2019t protest.<br></p><p>\u201cGo ahead and get yourself off on my fingers,\u201d his voice had dropped as he spoke directly into your ear,\u00a0\u201cThanks for apologizing,\u201d his tone was teasing and instigating. He won and that\u2019s all Tony ever wants when you play, he wanted to win.<br></p><p>\u201cBabyyyy,\u201d your nails dug deeper and he shushed you.<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so loud, don\u2019t wanna get interrupted before you even get a chance to cum, do you?,\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNoooo,\u201d you looked up from his chest to see him smiling down at you, fingers curling up, tapping your sweet spot, making your eyes roll back in your head. You heard a deep groan resonate within his chest and that\u2019s your undoing. You hold onto his forearm and rode yourself on his fingers, finally cumming. Your mouth fell open, ready to moan out into the quiet room, until Tony stuck his tongue in your mouth, kissing you deep with you following along.<br></p><p>He feels his fingers become wetter from your cum and he kisses you harder. Fingers still moving within you to ride out your climax. You pull away from his lips with a gasp, his lips red and yours tingling, tongue savoring the taste of yourself as Tony stares down at you in adoration.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re staring again,\u201d you hide yourself in his chest again, while he\u2019s still in you.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not apologizing for staring at my girlfriend,\u201d he moves back to be able to look at you once again,\u00a0\u201cPlus, you\u2019re cute when you cum. I mean, you\u2019re always cute but when you cum it\u2019s a different kind of cute,\u201d He finally pulls his fingers out and sucks them, making sure you\u2019re looking him in his eyes as he does so.<br></p><p>He was so dirty, and you loved it. A perfect, educated young man to everyone else but you knew the real him. You pulled his fingers out his lips to kiss him once again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky I like you enough to let you win,\u201d<br></p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2013</p><p>\u201cWant anything from the vending machine?,\u201d Tony asks. It was a late night in the library and you two occupied a study room so you two could focus without being surrounded by the other loud students.<br></p><p>\u201cJust a water and some Twizzlers if they have them. If not, cheez-its,\u201d you spare him a glance and a kiss before he leaves and turned back to your delinquency control and prevention textbook. You sat quietly as you highlighted the important theories that your professor said to focus on and stressed in class.<br></p><p>He wasn\u2019t gone for long and he came back with his arms almost full, mostly being snacks for him. He hands you a water and a pack of Twizzlers along with cheez-it.</p><p>\u201cBabe, I said, either or,\u201d you took a sip of the water,<br></p><p>\u201cAnd I decided on either <i>and</i> or,\u201d he sat back in his chair and opened a bag of chips, popping a few in his mouth and winking at you<br></p><p>\u201cThank you either way, Ant,\u201d you kiss his cheek before sitting back and taking a break to munch on your snacks. You two were sitting in comfortable silence when he hands you your glasses case.</p><p>\u201cI have my contacts in,\u201d you point to your eyes. He sucks his teeth and rolls his eyes.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYeah and you\u2019re starting to blink a lot faster, meaning your eyes are getting dry. Meaning it\u2019s time to take them out which means\u2026 put your damn glasses on,\u201d he laughs at you while dusting off his hands and putting on hand sanitizer to take them out for you. You hated touching your own eyes and as backwards as it seems, you preferred Tony to do it. So every morning he would put them in for you and every night he would take them out.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI hate wearing them,\u201d you mumbled.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t you know you\u2019ll get a headache,\u201d He stands over you and holds your eyes open as he takes them out one by one and adding a drop of eye drops to lubricate your eyes and placing your glasses on your face. You pushed them up on the bridge of your nose and Tony almost audibly cooed at how fucking cute that was. He throws your contacts away and sits back down beside you, rubbing you back of your neck to help you release some of the tension you hold there as you study.<br></p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s stay for another half hour and we turn in for the night, yeah?,\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>You wanted to protest, but you knew you two needed sleep. You had to wake up early as hell to do a lock out for a resident who locked his key in his room and Tony was woken up by a phone call to do a mediation for his residents who ended up fighting in the wee hours and woken up their suite-mates so you both had an early start to your day.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay sounds good,\u201d you nod, biting a Twizzler and turning back to your book. Tony just watched you. He watched the way you swung the Twizzler around as you were deep into the context of your textbook. The way you swung your foot back and forth and played with your curls as you didn\u2019t understand a theory and had to re read it a few times.\u00a0<br></p><p>Soon it was time to go back to the dorms and Tony helped you back your stuff up and piggybacked you to the car as you were tired and sleep finally started to hit you. He placed both of your belongs in the front seat and laid you down in the back seat, using the middle seat belt to strap you in.\u00a0</p><p>He never drove so carefully, avoiding all the potholes so you he wouldn\u2019t wake you up, braking easily when he came up on a red light and left the radio off.</p><p>\u00a0When you were both back to the dorms he placed both of your bags on his shoulders and carried you bridal style. You easily curled up into him, knowing it was him. He swiped his ID to get into the building and no one asked questions as to why he was carrying you. You were his lady so it was to be expected, especially since you were asleep.</p><p>Even though you just lived on the third floor and usually take the stairs, he took the elevator for a smooth ride. He used his master key to get into your room, not wanting to wake you up to get your key out of your bag. He softly laid you on the bed and undressed you to get you dressed in your night clothes which was really just a pair of his gym shorts and band tee of his. He searched around in the dark for your bonnet, knowing if he turned on the light it would wake you up. He tiredly stumbled over your shoe and looked back to you in fear that the loud noise had woken you up, but when he found you still sleeping he continued his quest. He found it hanging in your top dresser drawer and kicked his shoes off to strip down to his briefs and crawl in bed with you. He had situated you by the wall, knowing you have a habit of falling off the bed and softly raised your head to place the bonnet completely on it and rested your head back on your pillow.\u00a0</p><p>He was glad you went with a bare face today or else it\u2019d be hell trying to get the make up off without trying to wake you up. He removed your glasses, placing them on your desk and kissed your forehead and and pulled you close to him. You nuzzled into his neck and hummed.\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cStrain theory is the theory that states that social structures within society may pressure citizens to commit crime,\u201d </i>you mumble in your sleep and he tries not to laugh at how cute it was<br></p><p>\u201cI love you so much,\u201d he whispered as he leaned his cheek on yours, eyes finally fluttering closed as he embraced sleep.<br></p><p><i>\u201cI love you more, Ant,\u201d</i><br></p><p><i>\u2014\u2014\u2013</i></p><p><b>I LOVED THIS REQUEST SO MUCH OMFG!!

I also like the idea of calling him&nbsp;&ldquo;Ant&rdquo; (short for Anthony obviously) for some reason rather than Tony, so&hellip; that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m gonna do.

It always ended up like this and it was a great way to de-stress while you damn near pulled your hair out while trying to remember the definitions of these terms.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh come on, sugar. You never actually want me to stop,&rdquo; he winks at you as he sat on your lap and laid across you, knocking you down backwards on the bed.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;First you don&rsquo;t want me to get smart by keeping me from studying now you&rsquo;re trying to kill me? I&rsquo;m calling campus police!!,&rdquo; you reached for your phone but he snatched it up before you and started to run around your dorm room. You chased after him as he ran on the other side of the table and you tried reaching over the table to grab it but he jumped back from your reach and laughed in your face.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Come on, Stark! I&rsquo;m gonna call the RA!,&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Y/N.. we <i>ARE</i> the RA&rsquo;s!,&rdquo;<br /></p><p>He had a point there. He ran to your bed and started jumping up and down on it and you tried to knock his legs from under him but he just jumped over you, landing behind you and tackled you down on the bed.</p><p>&ldquo;Get off me you big oaf!,&rdquo; you groan as he squished you under the weight of his body.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Recant! Recant!,&rdquo; he chants,&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the only way I&rsquo;ll let go!,&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Uncle! Uncle!,&rdquo; you tap out on the books on your bed. He laughs and releases your phone and gets up from off of you smacking your ass, making you yelp out in surprise.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I was kind of liking that position,&rdquo; he sighs as if he was let down.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so disgusting,&rdquo; you sit back up on the bed and put the book in your lap trying to continue studying but he removed the book from your grasp and you fell back on your pillow groaning,&nbsp;&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you want me to succeed?!,&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Quiet hours,&rdquo; he puts his finger up to his lips and you just roll your eyes at him,&nbsp;&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s play your favorite studying game. You know that always helps you remember,&rdquo; he sets the book down and crawls over your body. Looking down into your dark brown eyes, he gives a wide grin.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Ant. I&rsquo;m really stressed out about this one, it&rsquo;s mainly all Latin terms,&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Gives us all the more reason to play,&rdquo; he begins to remove your pants and you give in, realizing he was right, this was the only way you would pass, which is quite sad but everyone has their studying methods, right?<br /></p><p>Whenever you had an exam, Tony would have his head between your legs, questioning you and as you continued to answer correcting, he&rsquo;d get closer to letting you cum, if you were wrong he&rsquo;d stop and go over it with you until you got it right before he got back down to business. This helped you during exams, it was so easy to remember because all you had to do was flashback to him between your legs and what tactics he did to help you remember that specific question.</p><p>He ran his hands up and down your bare thighs as you just wore is MIT shirt, staring at your clothed heat,&nbsp;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s <i>ad damnum</i>?,&rdquo; he looked at your book and quickly read the definition.</p><p>You closed your eyes and slowly inhaled,&nbsp;&ldquo;Ad damnum&hellip; refers to the parts or sections of a petition that speaks to the damages that were suffered and claimed by the plaintiff,&rdquo; you exhale as you feel Tony rub his thumb against your clit.</p><p>&ldquo;What about <i>ad litem</i>?,&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>You have to think about this one for a bit, there were so many A terms you had to remember it was easy to mix up.</p><p>&ldquo;Uuuuuh,&rdquo; you hesitate,&nbsp;&ldquo;<i>For the purpose of the lawsuit</i>,&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Mm, you sure about that one,&rdquo; he asks unsure. Now you question it.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Wait no!,&rdquo; you stop,&nbsp;&ldquo;It means.. to make void,&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;That your final answer?,&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>You hum a yes and he removes his hands from you completely,&nbsp;&ldquo;You got it wrong,&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>You sat up and gawked at him,&nbsp;&ldquo;Because you said I did!,&rdquo;</p><p>He takes your chin between his thumb and index finger, bringing it up to close your mouth,&nbsp;&ldquo;I said no such thing,&rdquo; he shakes his head,&nbsp;&ldquo;I just asked if you were sure, you second guessed yourself, we&rsquo;ve talked about this. You gotta stop doing that. If you&rsquo;re sure, go with that answer,&rdquo; he advises.</p><p>He was a good tutor outside of being your boyfriend and while he had good points, he played too many mind games.</p><p>&ldquo;Now, lay back down and we&rsquo;ll try again. Don&rsquo;t let me sway your answer if you&rsquo;re sure. You got this, sugar,&rdquo; he lightly pushes you back down to lie on your back and you stare at the ceiling.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Define bifurcation and give an example,&rdquo; he says<br /></p><p>&ldquo;The division of something into two branches or parts. For example, a trial. Like in civil cases, a liability phase and a damages phase,&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Good girl,&rdquo; he removes your panties and rubs your clit with hard, slow circles.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>Bona Vacantia</i>. Don&rsquo;t overthink it, sugar. You know this one,&rdquo;<br /></p><p>There&rsquo;s been plenty of times where you can&rsquo;t remember this one for the sake of everything. You always got it wrong for some reason. But Tony rubbing your clit had helped you focus because you wanted to cum.</p><p>&ldquo;Property that&hellip;,&rdquo; you hesitate but he encourages you,&nbsp;&ldquo;Property that belongs to no person and may be claimed by a finder,&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my smart girl,&rdquo; you felt him thrust a finger in you and teased you and he continued looking through your book.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Tell me what <i>certiorari</i> means,&rdquo; he began kissing and biting the inside of your thighs.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;To be in formed of,&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Love it when you talk all legal to me,&rdquo; he wraps his lips around your clit and you feel yourself fully relax as that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ve been waiting for. He was so good with his mouth it was unreal.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re low key a criminal,&rdquo; your tone was hushed but he still heard you and chuckled.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>De facto</i>,&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;As a matter of fact,&rdquo; you didn&rsquo;t miss a beat, that one was easy as fuck.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>And that&rsquo;s how it went, he kept asking questions until he was deep inside you and had you writhing beneath him.</p><p>&ldquo;Last one baby. What&rsquo;s <i>Voir Dire</i> mean?,&rdquo; he groaned as he snapped his hips. You had your head buried in his neck, moaning as quietly as you could so you wouldn&rsquo;t wake your residents. You struggled to answer, not because you didn&rsquo;t know the answer but because it felt like he was in your guts and the feeling was overwhelming you,&nbsp;&ldquo;Come on, sugar. I know you know it,&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;The&hellip; the french phrase m-meaning..&rdquo; you gasped as he snapped his hips particularly hard and bit your collarbone&nbsp;&ldquo;Meaning.. <i>to speak the truth</i>,&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>That&rsquo;s it</i>,&rdquo; he praises and goes harder, making you wrap your legs around him tightly.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll ace that exam tomorrow, baby,&rdquo; he kisses you and encourages you to cum as he feels himself about to let go as well,&nbsp;&ldquo;Cum for me, sugar,&rdquo;<br /></p><p>You bit his shoulder as you feel yourself cumming around him, trying hard not to moan out into the silent room.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; he whispers as he pulls out and cums on your stomach, using a small hand towel to clean you up. You see stars as you stare up at the ceiling.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do great tomorrow. When has our method ever failed you?,&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>You were one of the few people in the class of a hundred something to absolutely and completely ace the exam, like Tony said. You rushed out of the building to find Tony waiting on the hood of his car for you. You ran to him with your scantron in your hand.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;We did it! we did it!,&rdquo; you showed him your scantron and he picked you up, spinning you around and planting kisses on your cheeks.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>You</i> did it!,&rdquo; he corrects as he puts you down. Everyone around stared at you two, they always do. It was because of Tony, everyone knew Tony, he was the boy genius. He first got here when he was 15 and was about to graduate while you were only a sophomore, despite being the same age.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;But you helped!,&rdquo; you wave the paper,&nbsp;&ldquo;Without you, I would have bombed that exam,&rdquo; you tell him as he leads you to your side of his expensive ass car. This thing was worth your tuition times like&hellip; three if not more than that, who knows, you weren&rsquo;t a damn math major.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Where we headed?,&rdquo; you ask as he walks around to his side. The hood was down, the day was nice, he wanted to go for a drive.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Our little spot by the creek. Want to treat this really smart girl who aced her extremely hard exam today,&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Your face gets hot as you look down at your scantron and smile at the big red numbers that read&nbsp;&ldquo;100&Prime;, that exam was damn near two hundred questions and you and Tony barely went through half of the material last night, but you went through the ones you needed and that was enough.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll appreciate it,&rdquo; you held his hand as the wind kissed your scalp and ran its fingers through your tight curls,&nbsp;&ldquo;She loves the support system she has,&rdquo;<br /></p><p>He kissed your hand and looked at you over his sunglasses to wink at you, you gave him one right back. He turned up the radio and you two sang along to your song that just so happened to be playing at the perfect time.</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>Your dress was hiked up as Tony stood between your legs and fucked you on the hood of his car. You held onto his jacket as he held your legs under your knees and fucked you into oblivion.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You feel so good, Ant!,&rdquo; you could finally be as loud as you wanted. Your spot at the creek was secluded and never got an visitors.<br /></p><p>You two always did this after either of you did well on an exam. It honestly made you feel more special than any grade ever could. Tony made you feel things that no amount of perfect scores ever could, it wasn&rsquo;t just the sex, it was so much more. It was your connection, your support and love for each other.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, I&rsquo;m gonna cum,&rdquo; he let you know. He hissed as you tightened around him, rubbing your clit fast as you felt in throb within you,&nbsp;&ldquo;You feel so good, sugar,&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?,&rdquo; you ask, lifting his chin so he would make eye contact with you.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he nodded feverishly, nails digging into your thighs<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Then cum with me, baby,&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>You saw his eyes roll in his head as you pull him close for a kiss. He released your legs and planted his palms against the hood of the car, the bright white standing out against your pale pink dress and beautiful brown skin. He went harder and you sucked his lip into your mouth, biting and sucking, making him grunt before pulling out to jerk himself off and rub your clit, making you two cum together.&nbsp;</p><p>All that could be heard was you two panting and the rustling of the leaves. His head rested on your breast as he calmed himself,&nbsp;&ldquo;I love you so much,&rdquo; he mumbles.</p><p>&ldquo;And I love you, Ant,&rdquo; he sat up and smiled at you then looked at his wrist watch.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;We better clean up and get going. We have an RA huddle at 3,&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>You groaned, you hated those things. They were every month and was basically just the reiteration of shit you already knew.&nbsp;</p><p>Tony got up and grabbed a pack of wipes and a plastic bag from the glove box. You two took a wipe to clean yourselves up before putting it in the plastic bag to tie it up and throw it in the backseat.&nbsp;</p><p>You two got in the car and he started it, slowly pulling away from creek but not before grabbing your hand to plant another kiss on it and speeding away.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>&ldquo;You all know what to do with items like candles, hot plates, alcohol bottles and what not, correct?,&rdquo; your Residential Director asks the room full of RA&rsquo;s<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yes. We take a picture of the item, confiscate it then key into your office and leave it on your desk with a report that details what room we found it in, who lives in said room, what time it was and the name of the RA that confiscated the item and wait for you to give the report to the housing office. Once you receive the go ahead, you will notify us to add the resident to the billing list,&rdquo; you tell her the steps of the whole process and she nods before moving onto the next subject.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Tony had his head leaning against your shoulder as you listened to your RD, he was playing with his pencil, not paying a lick of attention.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Ant, you gotta listen,&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Sugar, we know this shit already,&rdquo; he groaned quietly.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, but you know how she is,&rdquo;<br /></p><p>He sighed in annoyance, knowing you were right. He set his pencil down and began paying attention but didn&rsquo;t lift his head from your shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;Please, please, <i>pleeaase</i>, for the love of Pete, keep up with your residents and HSI&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;m quite tired of verifying these long billing lists because your residents didn&rsquo;t pass their room inspections. I get it, it&rsquo;s not your fault because you can&rsquo;t make grown ass people clean up after themselves but their mommy isn&rsquo;t here to do it for them. They&rsquo;ll learn once those bills start racking up,&rdquo; She shrugs nonchalantly and Tony chuckles,&nbsp;&ldquo;Let them know that you&rsquo;ll only be checking their living areas once a week on your designated inspection day, Monday- Thursday only because HSI billing lists are due every Friday at 11:59 p.m. Let them know they&rsquo;re in control of the cleanliness of their living areas because if they fail, we don&rsquo;t reinspect until that next week and failed HSI billings are $500,&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Your RD does not play when it comes to her residential hall, and sometimes you wonder how you and Tony even got jobs as RA&rsquo;s but you two bust your ass so you&rsquo;re glad you can still cal yourself once.<br /></p><p>Tony grabs your hand to run his thumb over the soft skin and you softly smile as you lean your head against his.</p><p>&ldquo;You all have been doing well so far this semester. You all have another floor meeting coming soon. Let your residents know that midterms are coming up and they need to stay on top of everything because we don&rsquo;t do a second chance program here like other universities if they get below a certain level. Let them know your office hours so they can come to you all for help if they need, or direct them to the tutoring labs because they need a 3.0 to stay on campus. If they drop below that mark they <b><i>will</i></b> be kicked off campus. No if, ands, or buts about it,&rdquo; she turns off the powerpoint and stands before you in the main lounge of the resident hall and smiles at you all<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud of all your work. Your boards are due tomorrow at 11:59. Let&rsquo;s keep the good work up and make this spring semester a good one, yeah?,&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yes ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; you all answer and she finally lets you guys go. You collect your belongings and Tony leads you out the room, swinging your arm back and forth as he held your hand.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You wanna help me with my bulletin board? My topic is&nbsp;&lsquo;<i>the importance of being clean</i>&rsquo; I have all the damn sports kids on this floor, they won&rsquo;t know what clean is even if it hit them in the face&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;At least yours isn&rsquo;t the&nbsp;&lsquo;<i>side effects of sitting at your computer for too long</i>&rsquo;,&rdquo; he rolls his eyes,&nbsp;&ldquo;I got to put all these facts about eye strain and risks of carpal fucking tunnel and hemorrhoids and how you need to take a ten minute break for every hour you sit at the computer,&rdquo; you two reach your room and he plops down on your mini couch, watching you pull out a bunch of construction paper and letter stencils.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Fair enough,&rdquo; he you hand him letter stencils and a big board,&nbsp;&ldquo;Be a helpful fellow RA. Just trace the letters, here&rsquo;s a lay out,&rdquo; you hand him another paper so he knows what letters to cut out and how many.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Fine.. but you get to cut and paste the facts about hemorrhoids when we do my board,&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so gross!,&rdquo; you scroll on your laptop as you sit at your desk and look for pictures to put up on your topic board in the hall.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Remember, to take a break, sugar. We don&rsquo;t want any problems with that sweet ass,&rdquo; he chuckles to himself and you throw a pen at him which only causes him to laugh harder<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Not funny, Ant!,&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>&ldquo;I thought we said no expensive dates this semester?,&rdquo; you scolded him as he pulled up to the restaurant and just laughed at your reaction. He told you to get all dolled up because you two were taking a night out since neither of you were on duty.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Sugar, we say a lot of things like that but when do I ever listen to you?,&rdquo; he winked at you and got out the car to go to your side and open the door for you,&nbsp;&ldquo;Plus, you said the other day you were sick of the cafeteria food and wanted a taste of real food,&rdquo; he shrugs.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Ant!,&rdquo; you slap his shoulder,&nbsp;&ldquo;I was just talking out into the air. I didn&rsquo;t even think you were listening because you were studying,&rdquo; you widen your eyes at him<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re my little lady. Of course I&rsquo;m always listening to you. Now come on, I&rsquo;m starving,&rdquo; he takes your hand and leads you into the fancy restaurant and telling the host his last name. The host lead you to an area outside under a pavilion with fairy lights.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Anthony, this is too much!,&rdquo; you hiss as he pulls out your chair for you.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so modest. It&rsquo;s okay to admit you like it,&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I absolutely love it! But you didn&rsquo;t have to go all out like this,&rdquo; you hold his hand from across the table.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Babe, it&rsquo;s fine really. Now how about you pick up that menu and order something that will be nice to your stomach unlike the campus food,&rdquo;<br /></p><p>You laugh and shake your head at him, picking up the menu.</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>You ordered something with lobster in it and whatever it was, it was heaven on a plate. Tony ordered something simple, something he could have gotten anywhere else, fucking spaghetti and meatballs. He claims no one else makes it like this place.</p><p>You drank your virgin mimosa as he drank his disgusting sparkling water.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how you drink that stuff. It tastes like TV static,&rdquo; you frown over the rim of your cup.<br /></p><p>He gave you a confused smile and continued drinking,&nbsp;&ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t see how you can drink that stuff. It tastes like influenza recovery, all that vitamin c is too much,&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh shut it,&rdquo; you wave your hand at him and he just stares at you adoringly which, with anyone else, would make them feel great but you felt small when he looked at you like that.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Stop staring,&rdquo; you whined,&nbsp;&ldquo;You know I get insecure when people stare,&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;But why?,&rdquo; he asks surprised as if he hadn&rsquo;t heard it before. You two had been dating for two years of course he knew why, he just couldn&rsquo;t <i>understand</i> why. He leaned forward on the table and looked you dead in your eyes.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You are so beautiful, I can&rsquo;t believe I get to call you my girlfriend,&rdquo; he smiles but your frown just deepens.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>You?</i>,&rdquo; you softly lay your hands on the table,&nbsp;&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon man, you&rsquo;re<i> the</i> Tony Stark. I&rsquo;m the lucky one. The boy genius loves me. Like I get you&rsquo;re so much more than that but going to the same University as you was so intimidating, it still is a little bit,&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>He takes both of your hands and squeezes them,&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah you see me as Tony Stark but I&rsquo;ve always been more than that to you,&rdquo; his thumbs run the backs of your hands and you get goosebumps,&nbsp;&ldquo;You see me as so much more than the 15 year old who got accepted into a prestigious university and could have finished at 17 but decided to stay full term. You look past the money, the cars, the big vacation houses, and the labels. You love me for a deeper reason than what everyone wants to be friends with me for,&rdquo; you see tears glisten in his arms and you awh at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; you pout,&nbsp;&ldquo;Or else I&rsquo;m gonna cry and it took a long time to make myself look this good,&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You could cry it all off and I&rsquo;d still find you gorgeous,&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Your cheeks hurt from smiling so hard and you try to hide your face.</p><p>&ldquo;And you?,&rdquo; he exasperates,&nbsp;&ldquo;I never want to let you go. You&rsquo;re so fucking kind and open-minded. You&rsquo;re so intelligent and you never let anyone dumb you down. You&rsquo;re an inspiration and don&rsquo;t even know it,&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>You were about to scoff in his face until you see the look in his eyes. He was dead serious, there was no way he could lie about how he felt about you, it was raw and real and scared you almost because you never saw yourself as someone to be loved in such a way that Tony loves you but you embrace the feeling and it&rsquo;s warm.</p><p>&ldquo;Damn you, Stark,&rdquo; you remove a hand from his grasp and wipe or eyes to keep your liner from running.<br /></p><p>The waiter brings you the bill and you go to grab it only for Tony to grab it first and slid his card in it and writing the tip in, handing it back to the waiter whose eyes bulge at the tip before walking away.</p><p>&ldquo;Why would you do that? We always split,&rdquo; you raise a brow at him<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Stop questioning me and let me do me,&rdquo; he straightens his tie and you can&rsquo;t help but give a little laugh,&nbsp;&ldquo;You can pay me back by doing my HSI&rsquo;s,&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Wow so that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re doing now? Blackmailing?,&rdquo;<br /></p><p>He smirked at you and shook is head-</p><p><i>&ldquo;Not at all, sugar,&rdquo;</i><br /></p><p>&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>&ldquo;I swear guys, it&rsquo;s really not that hard to keep your rooms clean,&rdquo; you sigh as you look across the room at your residents. It was your monthly floor meeting and Tony was there with you like always,&nbsp;&ldquo;Some of you have already been fined more than three times already because you&rsquo;ve failed room inspections. Do you guys know how much the fine is?,&rdquo; you ask and it might as well be crickets in the room.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I dunno like.. 50 bucks,&rdquo; one of your residents shrugs his shoulders, he was the typical dumb ass football player.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Add 450 bucks to that and that&rsquo;s your answer,&rdquo; Tony speaks up and stops spinning in his chair to look at the guy.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;500 fucking bucks just for failing room inspections?!,&rdquo; one of the softball players speaks up.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s considered a safety hazard. Most of you live with a roommate and even if you live in a single, you still live in a suite with<i> other</i> people,&rdquo; you rub your temples,&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really not that hard to clean up after yourselves. I mean seriously, we&rsquo;re all adults. There is also a bathroom cleaning schedule on the bathroom doors. Each room in the suite is assigned to a different section of the bathroom every week, whether it be floors, mirrors and sinks, stalls, showers whatever, if it has your room letter by that section for the week, it is your responsibility to clean it. If everyone else in the suite cleans up and you miss your section, they pass, you fail, which is another fine of $500. So if you fail your room inspection <i>and</i> bathroom inspection, that&rsquo;s already $1000 right there,&rdquo;<br /></p><p>This causes an uproar in the room and everyone is talking and you just roll your eyes,&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait. I talk over no one,&rdquo; you pick up your phone and scroll through social media just waiting for them to finish. Tony just laughs and shakes his head at them</p><p>&ldquo;You guys always complain you have shit to do but maybe if you shut your mouths and listen we can speed this process up,&rdquo; Tony calls out. Everyone finally shuts their mouths as they look to him. You lock your phone and place it down and lean forward on the table.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really not understanding the upset. It&rsquo;s simple. You clean up after yourselves, you don&rsquo;t get fined. We aren&rsquo;t your coaches, we aren&rsquo;t your parents, we are not here to coddle you. We are here to do our job, if you have such a problem with that then go to the housing office to back out of your contract and move off campus,&rdquo; you roll your eyes once again and Tony puts his arm around the back of your chair to scoot closer to you.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Does he always have to be in here?,&rdquo; one of the baseball players asks.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the SRA. I can be wherever I want, when I want and come and go as I please. Since it&rsquo;s my job to look after the regular RA&rsquo;s and all residents, I can oversee these meetings. Now how about you just shut that mouth and listen,&rdquo;<br /></p><p><i>&ldquo;You clearly do more than look after her,&rdquo;</i><br /></p><p>&ldquo;More than you can say about your girl, Tyler. Still with Izzy after she slept with your teammate or no?,&rdquo; Tony places the pencil behind his ear and props his feet on the table that you two are sitting at in the front of the lounge. He has a smug grin and you can see Tyler&rsquo;s face turn red under his caramel skin.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Anthony,&rdquo; you slapped his arm and scolded him but he just laughed as you went back to talking about the topics from your list.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;This is just a reiteration that items like candles, hot plates, blenders, boilers, those little George Foreman grills are prohibited and if they are found they will be confiscated and you will be fined,&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Another wave of complaining flooded the room and Tony slammed his hands on the table,&nbsp;&ldquo;What is up with you all and always complaining? Shut the hell up,&rdquo; he groaned,&nbsp;&ldquo;If you have that much of a problem with the rules, do as Y/N said and move off campus. Get one of those campus apartments down the street. Oh wait,&rdquo; he taps his chin,&nbsp;&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t because you&rsquo;re just freshmen and sophomores,&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>One of your residents is still complaining and you&rsquo;ve had just about enough,&nbsp;&ldquo;Sierra, please for the love of God be quiet. Your Bath and Body Works Japanese Cherry Blossom candle gives me a fucking headache and is played out anyway. Grow up,&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Her jaw drops and you take a deep breath to calm yourself a bit.</p><p>&ldquo;These rules were in the handbook you received before you even came here. If you&rsquo;re returning sophomores I&rsquo;m not sure why you&rsquo;re acting so surprised. You know all of this. I did not make the rules, I just implement them because it&rsquo;s my job to,&rdquo;<br /></p><p>You continue to talk about how midterms are coming up and how they need to stay on top of things to be able to be eligible to stay on campus. You talk about how if they miss a floor meeting, they will be fined, not as much but fined regardless. You answer a few questions and begin calling them up by suites to sign the floor meeting check in paper.</p><p>&ldquo;And finally, suite 301,&rdquo; you call out and the baseball suite comes up and Tyler is still scowling at Tony. They never liked each other anyway, Tony didn&rsquo;t have a problem with the poor sophomore until he found him trying to hit on you.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You can frown like a three year old all you want. It won&rsquo;t change anything,&rdquo; Tony looked at him completely unamused and Tyler just signed his name practically throwing the pen at you in which Tony stood up and yanked him back by the collar of his baseball jersey.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;How about we rewind and you hand her the pen before I throw <i>you</i>, yeah?,&rdquo; Tony dragged him back to the front of the table and handed Tyler the pen so he can&nbsp;&ldquo;try again&rdquo;</p><p>Tyler huffs and hands you the pen which you softly take from him,&nbsp;&ldquo;Remember, room checks are every Tuesday 6pm-8pm. If it&rsquo;s not clean I won&rsquo;t feel bad for failing you,&rdquo;<br /></p><p>He just walks out of the floor lounge and you paper clip all your papers and turn to Tony.</p><p>&ldquo;Why did I let you talk me into applying for this job, babe? They&rsquo;re absolutely insufferable,&rdquo; you whine and rest your head on his shoulder which he kisses.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It will get better as you move up. As they get older the easier it will get,&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re lucky you have all the older techy- sciency people. I bet you never hear a peep out of them,&rdquo; you two walk back to your room and he climbs on your bed, kicking his shoes off, as you put the sign in sheet in a manila folder to place in your RD&rsquo;s office.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Only when they&rsquo;re not fighting on whether Akali&rsquo;s or Kai&rsquo;Sa&rsquo;s attacks are better,&rdquo;<br /></p><p>You turn around to frown at him and scrunch your face up in confusion,&nbsp;&ldquo;Who?,&rdquo;</p><p>Tony just waves his hand at you,&nbsp;&ldquo;Gamer stuff,&rdquo; he takes his shirt off and waves you over to him,&nbsp;&ldquo;But like you said, they&rsquo;re tech and science nerds so their rooms are also trash bins. With all that mellow yellow, cheese puffs and tissues littered everywhere covered in only God knows what,&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>You kick your shoes off as well and climb on your bed to straddle him,&nbsp;&ldquo;And to think you want me to do your HSI&rsquo;s this week. You set me up,&rdquo; you slapped his chest, the spot turning red automatically.&nbsp;</p><p>He hissed and turned you over, pinning you down under him,&nbsp;&ldquo;Say sorry,&rdquo; his nose was touching yours as he clenched his teeth.</p><p>&ldquo;Make me,&rdquo; you leaned forward and your lips touched his as you spoke.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh we&rsquo;re gonna play this game now? That&rsquo;s cool,&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>He got off the bed to lock your door and jumped back on to remove your jeans. You didn&rsquo;t even protest, you knew he&rsquo;d win and you wanted him to win. You feel the material rub against your skin and the warm metal of the zipper tracks scratch your skin a bit.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Sugar, say sorry,&rdquo; he didn&rsquo;t even bother removing your panties, he had a thing for fucking you with them on and you just let him have his fun. He laid flat on his stomach and moved your panties to the side to lick a small circle around your clit.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; you were still keeping up with this game and Tony had no problem with it. He kissed and nipped at your thighs and you tried to jerk away but he shook his head at you, eyes telling you to keep still.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Once his entire mouth covered you, your hands tangled themselves in his hair as a default. His tongue was so warm and wet against you, your clit started throbbing for more and he knew that. It was almost like he could feel the little heart beat against the tip of his tongue. He takes his time, any other time it&rsquo;s rushed and intense. But he makes sure to give your pussy all types of kisses and love.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Ant,&rdquo; you whined quietly, and looked down at him to find he was already staring back up at you. He wanted you to apologize, it was just a small slap but he wanted you to apologize just to tease you, knowing you would playfully be stubborn which would turn into this exact situation.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Look at you,&rdquo; he pulled back, lips glistening and wet but eyes not moving from yours as his thumb swirled around your wet clit, he sucks his lip into his mouth and you just caress his cheek, adoring the view of him between your legs,&nbsp;&ldquo;Maybe if you just say sorry I&rsquo;ll let you cum,&rdquo;<br /></p><p>He pushes two fingers in and starts going at a fast pace. He moves to lay beside you, placing your leg over one of his as he whispers in your ear and finger fucking you,&nbsp;&ldquo;Just say sorry like a good girl and I&rsquo;ll let you cum, sugar,&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>He curls his fingers and you feel the pleasure spread down to your toes and you find yourself wrapping your arms around the one he was using on you and hid in his chest, trying your best not to be loud.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Ant, please,&rdquo; your voice was muffled and he just smiled at you, moving his fingers harder then slowed them down again, teasing you and you knew he was doing that just so he could win, though he always won, you liked putting up a fight. The obscene squelching of his fingers moving in and out of you filled the room and could most likely be heard from the other side of the door, it was that loud and you were <i>that</i> wet.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Go ahead, sugar. Say sorry,&rdquo;<br /></p><p>You dug your fingernails into his flesh and planted your feet onto the bed to get a better angle to be able to buck your hips up. Tony stopped his motions to watch you fuck yourself on his fingers.</p><p>&ldquo;Baby, I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; you called out louder than intended but he didn&rsquo;t protest.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Go ahead and get yourself off on my fingers,&rdquo; his voice had dropped as he spoke directly into your ear,&nbsp;&ldquo;Thanks for apologizing,&rdquo; his tone was teasing and instigating. He won and that&rsquo;s all Tony ever wants when you play, he wanted to win.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Babyyyy,&rdquo; your nails dug deeper and he shushed you.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so loud, don&rsquo;t wanna get interrupted before you even get a chance to cum, do you?,&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Noooo,&rdquo; you looked up from his chest to see him smiling down at you, fingers curling up, tapping your sweet spot, making your eyes roll back in your head. You heard a deep groan resonate within his chest and that&rsquo;s your undoing. You hold onto his forearm and rode yourself on his fingers, finally cumming. Your mouth fell open, ready to moan out into the quiet room, until Tony stuck his tongue in your mouth, kissing you deep with you following along.<br /></p><p>He feels his fingers become wetter from your cum and he kisses you harder. Fingers still moving within you to ride out your climax. You pull away from his lips with a gasp, his lips red and yours tingling, tongue savoring the taste of yourself as Tony stares down at you in adoration.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re staring again,&rdquo; you hide yourself in his chest again, while he&rsquo;s still in you.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not apologizing for staring at my girlfriend,&rdquo; he moves back to be able to look at you once again,&nbsp;&ldquo;Plus, you&rsquo;re cute when you cum. I mean, you&rsquo;re always cute but when you cum it&rsquo;s a different kind of cute,&rdquo; He finally pulls his fingers out and sucks them, making sure you&rsquo;re looking him in his eyes as he does so.<br /></p><p>He was so dirty, and you loved it. A perfect, educated young man to everyone else but you knew the real him. You pulled his fingers out his lips to kiss him once again.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re lucky I like you enough to let you win,&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>&ldquo;Want anything from the vending machine?,&rdquo; Tony asks. It was a late night in the library and you two occupied a study room so you two could focus without being surrounded by the other loud students.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Just a water and some Twizzlers if they have them. If not, cheez-its,&rdquo; you spare him a glance and a kiss before he leaves and turned back to your delinquency control and prevention textbook. You sat quietly as you highlighted the important theories that your professor said to focus on and stressed in class.<br /></p><p>He wasn&rsquo;t gone for long and he came back with his arms almost full, mostly being snacks for him. He hands you a water and a pack of Twizzlers along with cheez-it.</p><p>&ldquo;Babe, I said, either or,&rdquo; you took a sip of the water,<br /></p><p>&ldquo;And I decided on either <i>and</i> or,&rdquo; he sat back in his chair and opened a bag of chips, popping a few in his mouth and winking at you<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Thank you either way, Ant,&rdquo; you kiss his cheek before sitting back and taking a break to munch on your snacks. You two were sitting in comfortable silence when he hands you your glasses case.</p><p>&ldquo;I have my contacts in,&rdquo; you point to your eyes. He sucks his teeth and rolls his eyes.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah and you&rsquo;re starting to blink a lot faster, meaning your eyes are getting dry. Meaning it&rsquo;s time to take them out which means&hellip; put your damn glasses on,&rdquo; he laughs at you while dusting off his hands and putting on hand sanitizer to take them out for you. You hated touching your own eyes and as backwards as it seems, you preferred Tony to do it. So every morning he would put them in for you and every night he would take them out.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I hate wearing them,&rdquo; you mumbled.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t you know you&rsquo;ll get a headache,&rdquo; He stands over you and holds your eyes open as he takes them out one by one and adding a drop of eye drops to lubricate your eyes and placing your glasses on your face. You pushed them up on the bridge of your nose and Tony almost audibly cooed at how fucking cute that was. He throws your contacts away and sits back down beside you, rubbing you back of your neck to help you release some of the tension you hold there as you study.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s stay for another half hour and we turn in for the night, yeah?,&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>You wanted to protest, but you knew you two needed sleep. You had to wake up early as hell to do a lock out for a resident who locked his key in his room and Tony was woken up by a phone call to do a mediation for his residents who ended up fighting in the wee hours and woken up their suite-mates so you both had an early start to your day.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay sounds good,&rdquo; you nod, biting a Twizzler and turning back to your book. Tony just watched you. He watched the way you swung the Twizzler around as you were deep into the context of your textbook. The way you swung your foot back and forth and played with your curls as you didn&rsquo;t understand a theory and had to re read it a few times.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Soon it was time to go back to the dorms and Tony helped you back your stuff up and piggybacked you to the car as you were tired and sleep finally started to hit you. He placed both of your belongs in the front seat and laid you down in the back seat, using the middle seat belt to strap you in.&nbsp;</p><p>He never drove so carefully, avoiding all the potholes so you he wouldn&rsquo;t wake you up, braking easily when he came up on a red light and left the radio off.</p><p>&nbsp;When you were both back to the dorms he placed both of your bags on his shoulders and carried you bridal style. You easily curled up into him, knowing it was him. He swiped his ID to get into the building and no one asked questions as to why he was carrying you. You were his lady so it was to be expected, especially since you were asleep.</p><p>Even though you just lived on the third floor and usually take the stairs, he took the elevator for a smooth ride. He used his master key to get into your room, not wanting to wake you up to get your key out of your bag. He softly laid you on the bed and undressed you to get you dressed in your night clothes which was really just a pair of his gym shorts and band tee of his. He searched around in the dark for your bonnet, knowing if he turned on the light it would wake you up. He tiredly stumbled over your shoe and looked back to you in fear that the loud noise had woken you up, but when he found you still sleeping he continued his quest. He found it hanging in your top dresser drawer and kicked his shoes off to strip down to his briefs and crawl in bed with you. He had situated you by the wall, knowing you have a habit of falling off the bed and softly raised your head to place the bonnet completely on it and rested your head back on your pillow.&nbsp;</p><p>He was glad you went with a bare face today or else it&rsquo;d be hell trying to get the make up off without trying to wake you up. He removed your glasses, placing them on your desk and kissed your forehead and and pulled you close to him. You nuzzled into his neck and hummed.&nbsp;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Strain theory is the theory that states that social structures within society may pressure citizens to commit crime,&rdquo; </i>you mumble in your sleep and he tries not to laugh at how cute it was<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I love you so much,&rdquo; he whispered as he leaned his cheek on yours, eyes finally fluttering closed as he embraced sleep.<br /></p><p><i>&ldquo;I love you more, Ant,&rdquo;</i><br /></p><p><i>&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</i></p><p><b>I LOVED THIS REQUEST SO MUCH OMFG!!

ALSO! I know in the comics he was 15 when he went to MIT and graduated at 17, but my lovely doves, he&rsquo;s an adult here. I also like the idea of calling him&nbsp;&ldquo;Ant&rdquo; (short for Anthony obviously) for some reason rather than Tony, so&hellip; that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m gonna do. And sorry for the weird format on mobile, I type on a desktop and for some reason it makes the spaces weird.</b></p>\n<figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p><i>HSI&rsquo;s- Health Safety Inspections</i></p>\n<p><i>SRA- Senior Residential Assistant</i></p>\n<p>&mdash;&ndash;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Ant, stop iiiiit!,&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p>\n<p>He kept trying to sit on your books as you studied. It always ended up like this and it was a great way to de-stress while you damn near pulled your hair out while trying to remember the definitions of these terms.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Oh come on, sugar. You never actually want me to stop,&rdquo; he winks at you as he sat on your lap and laid across you, knocking you down backwards on the bed.<br /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;First you don&rsquo;t want me to get smart by keeping me from studying now you&rsquo;re trying to kill me? I&rsquo;m calling campus police!!,&rdquo; you reached for your phone but he snatched it up before you and started to run around your dorm room. You chased after him as he ran on the other side of the table and you tried reaching over the table to grab it but he jumped back from your reach and laughed in your face.<br /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;Come on, Stark! I&rsquo;m gonna call the RA!,&rdquo;<br /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;Y/N.. we <i>ARE</i> the RA&rsquo;s!,&rdquo;<br /></p>\n<p>He had a point there. He ran to your bed and started jumping up and down on it and you tried to knock his legs from under him but he just jumped over you, landing behind you and tackled you down on the bed.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Get off me you big oaf!,&rdquo; you groan as he squished you under the weight of his body.<br /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;Recant! Recant!,&rdquo; he chants,&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the only way I&rsquo;ll let go!,&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;Uncle! Uncle!,&rdquo; you tap out on the books on your bed. He laughs and releases your phone and gets up from off of you smacking your ass, making you yelp out in surprise.&nbsp;<br /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;I was kind of liking that position,&rdquo; he sighs as if he was let down.<br /></p>\n</p>",
