Driving on the highway, the air felt electric. The pair of earbuds connecting you played music quietly as you both thought about the trip. Your dad in his white t shirt and jean shorts humming softly to the radio peeked into the mirror to see your head placed on Peters shoulder with your eyes shut. The soft smile on his face grew as his eyes returned to the road. </p><p>It was close to sunset when you arrived to the house you\u2019ve been going to since you were small. The excitement of sharing this with peter made you breathless. Giggling as you all piled out of the car and ran through the door, escaping the humidity and heat as the cool waves of the ac washed upon you. Memories flooded your senses as you ran up the stairs to see the interior of the house. Hands still entangled, peter squeezed your hand as he took in the house you always talked about. \u201cMake yourself at home, pete\u201d your dad chimed in as he started carrying bags and groceries in. You all helped put them away and decided to pick rooms. Pete and you had the back bedroom, right next to your sister\u2019s so she could keep an eye on you. </p><p>\u201cWanna go watch the sunset?\u201d The way your eyes sparkled as you asked, he knew he couldn\u2019t say no. \u201cAbsolutely !\u201d as everyone walked to the bay, you two decided to walk the other direction to the beach. The air turned cooler as you made your way across the busy intersection. The street lamps lessened as you made your way to the dunes. Reaching the top you sat down on the rickety bench stationed there. Shoes discarded, Peters arm came around your shoulder as his lips met your forehead. You stay like that for a while, thanking the stars for bringing you the boy of your dreams. The atmosphere was disturbed as he began tickling your sides. \u201cWhat\u2019re you thinking about?\u201d You laughed as you began to slide off the bench, laughing. \u201cYou, and how lucky i am to have you.\u201d You smiled as you met his eyes. His cheeks becoming pink as he took in your words. \u201cAs am i.\u201d</p><p>You made your way back to the house, laughing as Peter gave you a piggy back ride, almost dropping you once or twice, as you went up the stairs to the first floor, the smell of pizza overwhelmed your senses. \u201cCome grab a slice!\u201d Your dad said as he sat himself at the head of the table. Squeezing yourself onto the bench you sat opposite of Peter. Your eyes meeting from time to time as conversation flowed from person to person. He saw how truly happy you were to be here as you laughed at one of your sisters jokes. Your demeanor completely different from how it was from your everyday life. </p><p>The dim light was still on as his head was placed on your stomach. Showing each other different memes you find and basking in each other\u2019s company. \u201cGood night you two!\u201d Your sister chimes from the doorway, \u201cGood night!\u201d you both say back. You close the door and get ready to settle in for the night. The sheets feel cool against your legs as got under the blankets. Turning to face Peter, you smiled as he opened his arms to welcome you to his chest. </p><p>The sunlight shown through the lace curtains as you stirred. The unmistakable sound of the coffee maker running was heard from the kitchen. You lightly scooted up the bed and kissed peters cheek softly. Still sound asleep, you kissed his eyelids and then finally his lips. His eyes still closed, he began to move and stretch, entrapping you in his arms in a hug. You ran your fingertips over his face leaving tingling trails. He hummed as you giggled and he kissed the top of your nose. You escaped his grasp and got to the side of your bed. </p><p>Shuffling to the kitchen, bagels and coffee waiting for the taking, you sat at the island, stretching as you decided what kind you wanted. Peter came from down the hallway wiping the sleep out of his eyes and yawning, white t shirt and grey sweatpants hanging low on his hips.  \u201cGood morning\u201d he said as he saw your family going about their morning routines. Taking a seat next to you, he took his hand in yours and kissed your cheek as you both went on your phones to catch up on what you missed through the night. </p><p>The breeze once again made itself evident as you sat in the low beach chair. Adjusting your sunglasses you looked over the many chairs to the water, seeing Peter, your brother, and your dad all together jumping waves. \u201cHe\u2019s good for you.\u201d you looked over to your sister and smiled. \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s good for you, he gets you. Your mannerisms, your interests, he knows what makes you tick and seems to be all in. Are you?\u201d you closed your eyes as you felt the sun on your cheeks \u201cAll the way.\u201d</p><p>The neon lights enchanted you as you were on the tilt-a-whirl. Smushed against peter, you laughed and laughed until your stomach hurt. Getting off, still slightly dizzy, you walked into Peter who put his arms round you to help you keep steady. </p><p>\u201cTake a walk with me?\u201d \u201cOf course!\u201d Your dad nodded as you walked by and out of the park. He brought you to the bay line. The sounds of the arcade and the screams of the riders an after thought. \u201cI\u2019ve loves being here with you, I can really see how much your family means to you. How much this place means to you, and I wanted to thank you for taking me with you. I love you more than words can describe. Thank you for making me so happy, thank you for making every day an adventure.\u201d \u201cI love you too P. Thank you for coming and putting up with my family\u2019s shenanigans.\u201d Your laughter died down as Peter pulled something from his pocket \u201cI wanted to give you something.\u201d \u201cPete I-\u201c \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not an engagement ring, I know we\u2019re too young for that sort of commitment, but I want to be promised to you. so I got you a promise ring\u201d He chuckles nervously as his cheeks become pinker, and you know it\u2019s not just from his sunburn. He opens the box and it\u2019s a small silver band with a small heart pendant on it. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful thank you so much, Pete.\u201d He smiled as he slides it on your finger. You kiss as the sunsets and it\u2019s the perfect moment. You come down. from your love induced high and look into his chocolate colored eyes. cheeks still pink from being breathless, and his freckles darkened due to his sun exposure. As you look down at the ring you see the late nights spent in Peters car, singing along to the radio and drinking slurpees. The weekends and afternoons spent in a cafe trying to study. But you also see what your future with Peter holds. </p>",

Hands still entangled, peter squeezed your hand as he took in the house you always talked about. \u201cMake yourself at home, pete\u201d your dad chimed in as he started carrying bags and groceries in. You all helped put them away and decided to pick rooms. Pete and you had the back bedroom, right next to your sister\u2019s so she could keep an eye on you. </p><p>\u201cWanna go watch the sunset?\u201d The way your eyes sparkled as you asked, he knew he couldn\u2019t say no. \u201cAbsolutely !\u201d as everyone walked to the bay, you two decided to walk the other direction to the beach. The air turned cooler as you made your way across the busy intersection. The street lamps lessened as you made your way to the dunes. Reaching the top you sat down on the rickety bench stationed there. Shoes discarded, Peters arm came around your shoulder as his lips met your forehead. You stay like that for a while, thanking the stars for bringing you the boy of your dreams. The atmosphere was disturbed as he began tickling your sides. \u201cWhat\u2019re you thinking about?\u201d You laughed as you began to slide off the bench, laughing. \u201cYou, and how lucky i am to have you.\u201d You smiled as you met his eyes. His cheeks becoming pink as he took in your words. \u201cAs am i.\u201d</p><p>You made your way back to the house, laughing as Peter gave you a piggy back ride, almost dropping you once or twice, as you went up the stairs to the first floor, the smell of pizza overwhelmed your senses. \u201cCome grab a slice!\u201d Your dad said as he sat himself at the head of the table. Squeezing yourself onto the bench you sat opposite of Peter. Your eyes meeting from time to time as conversation flowed from person to person. He saw how truly happy you were to be here as you laughed at one of your sisters jokes. Your demeanor completely different from how it was from your everyday life. </p><p>The dim light was still on as his head was placed on your stomach. Showing each other different memes you find and basking in each other\u2019s company. \u201cGood night you two!\u201d Your sister chimes from the doorway, \u201cGood night!\u201d you both say back. You close the door and get ready to settle in for the night. The sheets feel cool against your legs as got under the blankets. Turning to face Peter, you smiled as he opened his arms to welcome you to his chest. </p><p>The sunlight shown through the lace curtains as you stirred. The unmistakable sound of the coffee maker running was heard from the kitchen. You lightly scooted up the bed and kissed peters cheek softly. Still sound asleep, you kissed his eyelids and then finally his lips. His eyes still closed, he began to move and stretch, entrapping you in his arms in a hug. You ran your fingertips over his face leaving tingling trails. He hummed as you giggled and he kissed the top of your nose. You escaped his grasp and got to the side of your bed. </p><p>Shuffling to the kitchen, bagels and coffee waiting for the taking, you sat at the island, stretching as you decided what kind you wanted. Peter came from down the hallway wiping the sleep out of his eyes and yawning, white t shirt and grey sweatpants hanging low on his hips.  \u201cGood morning\u201d he said as he saw your family going about their morning routines. Taking a seat next to you, he took his hand in yours and kissed your cheek as you both went on your phones to catch up on what you missed through the night. </p><p>The breeze once again made itself evident as you sat in the low beach chair. Adjusting your sunglasses you looked over the many chairs to the water, seeing Peter, your brother, and your dad all together jumping waves. \u201cHe\u2019s good for you.\u201d you looked over to your sister and smiled. \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s good for you, he gets you. Your mannerisms, your interests, he knows what makes you tick and seems to be all in. Are you?\u201d you closed your eyes as you felt the sun on your cheeks \u201cAll the way.\u201d</p><p>The neon lights enchanted you as you were on the tilt-a-whirl. Smushed against peter, you laughed and laughed until your stomach hurt. Getting off, still slightly dizzy, you walked into Peter who put his arms round you to help you keep steady. </p><p>\u201cTake a walk with me?\u201d \u201cOf course!\u201d Your dad nodded as you walked by and out of the park. He brought you to the bay line. The sounds of the arcade and the screams of the riders an after thought. \u201cI\u2019ve loves being here with you, I can really see how much your family means to you. How much this place means to you, and I wanted to thank you for taking me with you. I love you more than words can describe. Thank you for making me so happy, thank you for making every day an adventure.\u201d \u201cI love you too P. Thank you for coming and putting up with my family\u2019s shenanigans.\u201d Your laughter died down as Peter pulled something from his pocket \u201cI wanted to give you something.\u201d \u201cPete I-\u201c \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not an engagement ring, I know we\u2019re too young for that sort of commitment, but I want to be promised to you. so I got you a promise ring\u201d He chuckles nervously as his cheeks become pinker, and you know it\u2019s not just from his sunburn. He opens the box and it\u2019s a small silver band with a small heart pendant on it. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful thank you so much, Pete.\u201d He smiled as he slides it on your finger. You kiss as the sunsets and it\u2019s the perfect moment. You come down. from your love induced high and look into his chocolate colored eyes. cheeks still pink from being breathless, and his freckles darkened due to his sun exposure. As you look down at the ring you see the late nights spent in Peters car, singing along to the radio and drinking slurpees. The weekends and afternoons spent in a cafe trying to study. But you also see what your future with Peter holds. </p></p>",

He glanced backward, the building fading out of sight and no signs of pursuit so far.</p><p>&ldquo;I think you can drop the illusion now,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just a little while longer. If I drop it now they could come after us quickly. We need to be farther away,&rdquo; I explained.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re using up too much strength. We could run a lot faster if you&rsquo;d stop the illusion. You&rsquo;re going to hurt yourself from holding it up.&rdquo;</p><p>I considered his words. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to hurt myself.&rdquo;</p><p>I hope I&rsquo;m not going to hurt myself.

Or maybe it&rsquo;d be indirect; if I use up too much energy on this I could collapse later? I don&rsquo;t know and I don&rsquo;t want to find out.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re far enough away!&rdquo; Peter looks at me, silently pleading for me to listen to him.</p><p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; I grumbled, closing my eyes as we run.</p><p>I concentrated and dropped the illusion, shaking my head to clear the headache forming from holding the illusion too long.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay where to now? We have to get farther away but we also have to figure out where we are and send a message to your dad.&rdquo; He questioned, trying to figure out what we need to do next.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, we need to find out where we are. Let&rsquo;s try to find a map? We also need to find out how much time has passed. And try not to be the only ones out on the street because that would make it easier for them to find us.&rdquo; I slowed until I was just walking casually, Peter doing the same.</p><p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t we keep running?&rdquo; Peter asked hesitantly, confusion lacing his tone as he looked at me.</p><p>&ldquo;The first rule of going on the run is don&rsquo;t run, walk,&rdquo; I said, quoting something Natasha had taught me when SHIELD collapsed. God, I miss her and everyone else. Stupid accords.</p><p>Peter nodded and I looked around the street we were walking along. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a convenience store right there,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s gotta be&hellip; something we can use in there, even if its just a map of the town.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, let&rsquo;s check it out.&rdquo; He started walking in that direction; I quickly followed behind.</p><p>A bell rang as I pushed the door open, stepping inside with Peter. We looked around. The place wasn&rsquo;t overly crowded and didn&rsquo;t feel like it was a bad place to be. Aisles of products lined the store. There is a cashier&rsquo;s desk to our left; the lady sitting behind the register seems to be working on a crossword puzzle. A sign on the wall above her reads &ldquo;I HEART NEW YORK&rdquo; and a clock a few feet away tells us that it&rsquo;s 2:27 on Sunday. Sunday is two days after Friday. We&rsquo;ve been missing since Friday! Okay, that&rsquo;s not good, but we can&rsquo;t freak out now.</p><p>I nodded towards the sign. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t be too far if we&rsquo;re still in New York.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;New York is a big freaking place,&rdquo; Peter whispered, glancing at the sign.</p><p>I shrugged, then pointed at the clock. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Sunday.&rdquo;</p><p>His eyes widened. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s&hellip; not good.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nope,&rdquo; I replied, trying to sound nonchalant. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s keep looking through the store. Maybe we can find some way to contact my dad. If we split up we can search the store twice as fast,&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded, looking like he really hated the plan. I did, too, but that&rsquo;s not important. We have to find a way to get home, fast. Nightmare could be coming after us as we speak.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go left, you go right,&rdquo; Peter said, waiting for me to nod before walking away slowly. I turned and started towards the far right of the store.</p><p>I looked through every aisle carefully, trying to find a phone or something that I could use to get a message to my dad. Even though Peter and I have no money on us, if we can convince the cashier that I&rsquo;m Y/N Stark, then money shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem. I can come back and pay later, I just need to get a message to my dad first.</p><p>The bell chimed again as the door opened and a group of people walked in. I didn&rsquo;t think much of it. We&rsquo;re in a public place after all. It could be just another group of kids looking to buy some snacks for an afternoon of studying.</p><p>I continued searching, covering two more aisles before a rough hand grabbed my arm. I let out a yell and turned, trying to wrench my arm away so I could run. <br/></p><p>&ldquo;There you are!&rdquo; Nightmare came around the corner, looking angry yet keeping her voice light. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not even going to lie, you&rsquo;re way better at escaping than you&rsquo;re given credit for. I didn&rsquo;t expect you to be able to get out at all, but you two got out pretty quickly.&rdquo;</p><p>Oh no. Oh no, no, no, this is not good at all. She found us. Well, she found me. I <i>really </i>hope she didn&rsquo;t find Peter.</p><p>&ldquo;Let go of my arm.&rdquo; I narrowed my eyes at the guard holding me, ignoring Nightmare.</p><p>Unfortunately, that just made the guy tighten his grip. I rolled my eyes and focused on Nightmare, knowing that there was going to be a red mark on my arm from his tight grip.</p><p>&ldquo;So what happens now?&rdquo; I ask, feeling my heart pounding. I&rsquo;m scared. There are too many people here that could get hurt.</p><p>&ldquo;Now, we find Spidey and continue with our plan.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;What is your plan?&rdquo; </i> I ask, hardening my voice to hide the fear and tiredness that could probably be heard.</p><p>&ldquo;Like I&rsquo;d tell <i>you</i>,&rdquo; she sneered.</p><p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; I raised an eyebrow. I&rsquo;m stalling, but, hopefully, she doesn&rsquo;t know that. &ldquo;Are you scared I&rsquo;ll escape again and run off to tell Daddy? Ruin any chance you ever had or will have of using this plan?&rdquo;</p><p>Nightmare stepped closer. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t start insulting me, Y/N. I have your life in my hands, I could kill you or your friend in the blink of an eye without a second thought.&rdquo; I rolled my eyes. Of course, she&rsquo;s going to use verbal threat like that. &ldquo;Now, you&rsquo;re going to go with Roland here and you&rsquo;re not going to fight. Or&hellip; well we&rsquo;ve got a variety of weapons that we aren&rsquo;t afraid to use on you.&rdquo;</p><p>Great. She&rsquo;s got a variety of weapons to use and I&rsquo;ve got absolutely nothing except myself. Absolutely perfect.</p><p>I nodded stiffly and let the guy still gripping my arm entirely too tightly, Roland, lead me to wherever it is that we&rsquo;re going.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t have very long to wonder; we end up in a deserted alleyway behind the store. Roland drags me by the arm towards a van, not saying a word. Without warning, he slams me against the van. I cry out at the sudden pain when my head hits the van. Roland quickly grabs my hands and uses actual handcuffs to secure my arms behind me, locking them a little too tightly around my wrists.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, stop! Don&rsquo;t hurt her!&rdquo; Peter yells when he sees me, being dragged into the alley too.</p><p>No one responds to Peter. He&rsquo;s already in handcuffs, I realize. Not very reassuring. Nightmare comes around the corner, smirking.</p><p>She gives a curt nod and Roland picks me up and throws me into the back of the van.</p><p>I groan and try to sit up. I can hear Peter yelling, but I&rsquo;m not sure what he&rsquo;s saying. He&rsquo;s thrown into the van beside me and the doors are slammed shut. I can hear the lock click.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/n? Are you okay?&rdquo; \u00a0Peter sounds panicked, leaning against the back wall of the van and watching as I struggle to sit up.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m good. You?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine. Are you sure you&rsquo;re okay? Does your head hurt? It sounded really bad when it hit the van, Y/N.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pete, I&rsquo;m <i>fine</i>. Yeah, my head hurts. It doesn&rsquo;t feel like a concussion though, I&rsquo;m pretty sure it&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo;</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t speak for a few minutes after that, looking up at the ceiling of the van thoughtfully. &ldquo;It just scared me. I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your fault.&rdquo;</p><hr><p>Tags:\u00a0<b><br/></b><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZuDO8QlYWrGBhBSpm-tG0g\">@roonyxx</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mg6MMu22WYyrWXFREhoQA4g\">@adventurousbooknerd</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBBT_g1LbtS4-tdsDMezbIQ\">@smilexcaptainx</a></p>",

Okay, that\u2019s not good, but we can\u2019t freak out now.</p><p>I nodded towards the sign. \u201cWe can\u2019t be too far if we\u2019re still in New York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNew York is a big freaking place,\u201d Peter whispered, glancing at the sign.</p><p>I shrugged, then pointed at the clock. \u201cIt\u2019s Sunday.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 not good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d I replied, trying to sound nonchalant. \u201cLet\u2019s keep looking through the store. Maybe we can find some way to contact my dad. If we split up we can search the store twice as fast,\u201d</p><p>He nodded, looking like he really hated the plan. I did, too, but that\u2019s not important. We have to find a way to get home, fast. Nightmare could be coming after us as we speak.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go left, you go right,\u201d Peter said, waiting for me to nod before walking away slowly. I turned and started towards the far right of the store.</p><p>I looked through every aisle carefully, trying to find a phone or something that I could use to get a message to my dad. Even though Peter and I have no money on us, if we can convince the cashier that I\u2019m Y/N Stark, then money shouldn\u2019t be a problem. I can come back and pay later, I just need to get a message to my dad first.</p><p>The bell chimed again as the door opened and a group of people walked in. I didn\u2019t think much of it. We\u2019re in a public place after all. It could be just another group of kids looking to buy some snacks for an afternoon of studying.</p><p>I continued searching, covering two more aisles before a rough hand grabbed my arm. I let out a yell and turned, trying to wrench my arm away so I could run. <br></p><p>\u201cThere you are!\u201d Nightmare came around the corner, looking angry yet keeping her voice light. \u201cI\u2019m not even going to lie, you\u2019re way better at escaping than you\u2019re given credit for. I didn\u2019t expect you to be able to get out at all, but you two got out pretty quickly.\u201d</p><p>Oh no. Oh no, no, no, this is not good at all. She found us. Well, she found me. I <i>really </i>hope she didn\u2019t find Peter.</p><p>\u201cLet go of my arm.\u201d I narrowed my eyes at the guard holding me, ignoring Nightmare.</p><p>Unfortunately, that just made the guy tighten his grip. I rolled my eyes and focused on Nightmare, knowing that there was going to be a red mark on my arm from his tight grip.</p><p>\u201cSo what happens now?\u201d I ask, feeling my heart pounding. I\u2019m scared. There are too many people here that could get hurt.</p><p>\u201cNow, we find Spidey and continue with our plan.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cWhat is your plan?\u201d </i> I ask, hardening my voice to hide the fear and tiredness that could probably be heard.</p><p>\u201cLike I\u2019d tell <i>you</i>,\u201d she sneered.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d I raised an eyebrow. I\u2019m stalling, but, hopefully, she doesn\u2019t know that. \u201cAre you scared I\u2019ll escape again and run off to tell Daddy? Ruin any chance you ever had or will have of using this plan?\u201d</p><p>Nightmare stepped closer. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t start insulting me, Y/N. I have your life in my hands, I could kill you or your friend in the blink of an eye without a second thought.\u201d I rolled my eyes. Of course, she\u2019s going to use verbal threat like that. \u201cNow, you\u2019re going to go with Roland here and you\u2019re not going to fight. Or\u2026 well we\u2019ve got a variety of weapons that we aren\u2019t afraid to use on you.\u201d</p><p>Great. She\u2019s got a variety of weapons to use and I\u2019ve got absolutely nothing except myself. Absolutely perfect.</p><p>I nodded stiffly and let the guy still gripping my arm entirely too tightly, Roland, lead me to wherever it is that we\u2019re going.</p><p>I don\u2019t have very long to wonder; we end up in a deserted alleyway behind the store. Roland drags me by the arm towards a van, not saying a word. Without warning, he slams me against the van. I cry out at the sudden pain when my head hits the van. Roland quickly grabs my hands and uses actual handcuffs to secure my arms behind me, locking them a little too tightly around my wrists.</p><p>\u201cHey, stop! Don\u2019t hurt her!\u201d Peter yells when he sees me, being dragged into the alley too.</p><p>No one responds to Peter. He\u2019s already in handcuffs, I realize. Not very reassuring. Nightmare comes around the corner, smirking.</p><p>She gives a curt nod and Roland picks me up and throws me into the back of the van.</p><p>I groan and try to sit up. I can hear Peter yelling, but I\u2019m not sure what he\u2019s saying. He\u2019s thrown into the van beside me and the doors are slammed shut. I can hear the lock click.</p><p>\u201cY/n? Are you okay?\u201d \u00a0Peter sounds panicked, leaning against the back wall of the van and watching as I struggle to sit up.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m good. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Are you sure you\u2019re okay? Does your head hurt? It sounded really bad when it hit the van, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPete, I\u2019m <i>fine</i>. Yeah, my head hurts. It doesn\u2019t feel like a concussion though, I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t speak for a few minutes after that, looking up at the ceiling of the van thoughtfully. \u201cIt just scared me. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201d</p><hr><p>Tags:\u00a0<b><br></b><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZuDO8QlYWrGBhBSpm-tG0g\">@roonyxx</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mg6MMu22WYyrWXFREhoQA4g\">@adventurousbooknerd</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBBT_g1LbtS4-tdsDMezbIQ\">@smilexcaptainx</a></p>",
                "content": "<p>I tried. I really did. But I couldn&rsquo;t keep that large of an illusion up for long when I was right next to it, much less when I was too far away to see it and probably also being chased by something.</p><p>I could feel it, though, I could feel the illusion as I struggled to keep it up, my mind split between running as fast as possible and keeping it up.</p><p>Beads of sweat rolled down my face and heavy breaths barely escaped my lungs as we ran.</p><p>Peter ran alongside me, keeping pace despite the fact that he could probably be running at least slightly faster than me. He glanced backward, the building fading out of sight and no signs of pursuit so far.</p><p>&ldquo;I think you can drop the illusion now,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just a little while longer. If I drop it now they could come after us quickly. We need to be farther away,&rdquo; I explained.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re using up too much strength. We could run a lot faster if you&rsquo;d stop the illusion. You&rsquo;re going to hurt yourself from holding it up.&rdquo;</p><p>I considered his words. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to hurt myself.&rdquo;</p><p>I hope I&rsquo;m not going to hurt myself. I mean, it&rsquo;s magic, right? I won&rsquo;t hurt myself by projecting an image. Right? Maybe it&rsquo;d be like straining your muscles. Or maybe it&rsquo;d be indirect; if I use up too much energy on this I could collapse later? I don&rsquo;t know and I don&rsquo;t want to find out.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re far enough away!&rdquo; Peter looks at me, silently pleading for me to listen to him.</p><p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; I grumbled, closing my eyes as we run.</p><p>I concentrated and dropped the illusion, shaking my head to clear the headache forming from holding the illusion too long.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay where to now? We have to get farther away but we also have to figure out where we are and send a message to your dad.&rdquo; He questioned, trying to figure out what we need to do next.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, we need to find out where we are. Let&rsquo;s try to find a map? We also need to find out how much time has passed. And try not to be the only ones out on the street because that would make it easier for them to find us.&rdquo; I slowed until I was just walking casually, Peter doing the same.</p><p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t we keep running?&rdquo; Peter asked hesitantly, confusion lacing his tone as he looked at me.</p><p>&ldquo;The first rule of going on the run is don&rsquo;t run, walk,&rdquo; I said, quoting something Natasha had taught me when SHIELD collapsed. God, I miss her and everyone else. Stupid accords.</p><p>Peter nodded and I looked around the street we were walking along. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a convenience store right there,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s gotta be&hellip; something we can use in there, even if its just a map of the town.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, let&rsquo;s check it out.&rdquo; He started walking in that direction; I quickly followed behind.</p><p>A bell rang as I pushed the door open, stepping inside with Peter. We looked around. The place wasn&rsquo;t overly crowded and didn&rsquo;t feel like it was a bad place to be. Aisles of products lined the store. There is a cashier&rsquo;s desk to our left; the lady sitting behind the register seems to be working on a crossword puzzle. A sign on the wall above her reads &ldquo;I HEART NEW YORK&rdquo; and a clock a few feet away tells us that it&rsquo;s 2:27 on Sunday. Sunday is two days after Friday. We&rsquo;ve been missing since Friday!

                "content": "<p>Right when Bruce was able to synthesize am anesthetic&nbsp;that would work with Peters mutation, He begged to get top surgery. He knew that he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to be Spider-Man during the recovery period but with a practically spandex suit, not having tits would be pretty nice.&nbsp;</p><p>Sure, Mr. Stark had figured out a binder that was practically invisible and miraculously still let him breathe. He still had to take frequent breaks but he was responsible enough to take care of those kinds of things. He had so many baggy hoodies at this point that it was crazy. What? They were really convenient.&nbsp;</p><p>Thankfully, Mr. Stark agreed to let him have the surgery. They did have a trustworthy group of doctors that the remaining Avengers relied on. It would be hard to find a doctor that would use a special kind of anesthetic for this random kid.&nbsp;</p><p>Peter had always kind of been afraid of hospitals anyway and he had once seen a video that talked about the possibility of anesthesia awareness. Where the person was more paralyzed and felt every scalpel ripping into their body but Tony promised that they&rsquo;ll have brain monitors on him so that nothing scary would happen or if it did, they&rsquo;ll know and fix it immediately.&nbsp;</p><p>The day of the surgery, Peter was really nervous but he had May and Mr. Stark with him and the promise that Colonel Rhodes would be there when he awoke. Ned promised to come around after school which Peter was also thankful about.&nbsp;He was told that he would need at least a day with intensive recovery with how intense his healing factor was. They said that he wouldn&rsquo;t even have any scarring. So that was pretty rad.&nbsp;</p><p>Falling asleep was easy and he felt like he had just closed his eyes before he woke up again, tit-less. With May, Tony, and Rhodey in the infirmary&nbsp;room waiting for him to wake up.</p><p>The first thing he noticed was Rhodey&rsquo;s shirt. It was dark gray with white text that said,&nbsp;&lsquo;Protect Trans Kids.&rsquo; Peter immediately smiled. The woozy effect faded away pretty quickly with Peter&rsquo;s metabolism, thank god he didn&rsquo;t do anything too embarrassing. Just cry and try to hug everyone even though his chest was cut into a lot. He just got half hugs.&nbsp;</p><p>He recovered enough to move around after a day but still wasn&rsquo;t ready to go so far as to be Spider-Man but eventually, he was.&nbsp;</p><p>His first mission after surgery was with both Tony and Rhodey.

He notices because Pepper had shown him a video that she&rsquo;d been watching of Tony and Peter three months ago- of Peter smiling, laughing, and not flinching at every loud and sudden movement and noise.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a lab day the day Pepper showed Tony the video. Tony doesn&rsquo;t notice the change until an hour into their lab time, when he notices Peter hunched over whatever the kid&rsquo;s working on. Tony knows from experience that the position Peter&rsquo;s in will hurt his neck and back. &ldquo;Hey Pete?&rdquo; Tony calls out. </p><p>Peter doesn&rsquo;t answer. He just continues working on what Tony now realizes is his web-shooters. He&rsquo;s completely immersed in what he&rsquo;s doing- not paying attention to the world around him or what&rsquo;s happening. Tony gets it, and he knows that just calling out Peter&rsquo;s name over and over again isn&rsquo;t going to snap Peter out of his focused mind. So Tony strolls over to Peter, not thinking as he puts a hand on the kid&rsquo;s arm.</p><p>Apparently he should of thought about it more, because the way Peter reacts is the first red flag that Tony notices. The teen throws himself out of his chair, scrambling to the wall about six feet away with a hand raised to defend himself. His eyes are wide and staring straight at Tony&rsquo;s in a wide, deer-in-headlights look. Realization on what he&rsquo;s just done dawns on Peter&rsquo;s pale face. He opens his mouth like he wants to say something, but nothing comes out.</p><p>The next thing Tony notices is that Peter&rsquo;s jacket sleeve had rolled up during the sudden movement- revealing a hand shaped bruise around the teen&rsquo;s wrist. Peter follows Tony&rsquo;s line of sight, and quickly pulls his hand close to his chest. </p><p>Tony looks back into Peter&rsquo;s eyes&hellip; and that&rsquo;s where he notices the next thing. The mix of emotions that Tony knew because he had felt all of these when he was younger. On the bad nights where Howard had had a stressful day or night. The fear, and embarrassment, and the silent plea for help.</p><p>He notices it all in the span of ten seconds, and curses himself for not noticing sooner. </p><p>&ldquo;Peter?&rdquo; Tony asks softly, crouching a few feet away from the shaking teen, holding his hands up in the &lsquo;surrender&rsquo; motion. &ldquo;Peter, are you here? Are you in the lab?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter is breathing heavily, curled into himself and eyes locked onto Tony. He doesn&rsquo;t answer for a few moments, just opening and closing his mouth with nothing coming out. Finally, as if realizing that he just wasn&rsquo;t going to be talking, Peter nods his head once. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Tony attempts to smile reassuringly, &ldquo;Okay, can I come closer?&rdquo;</p><p>There&rsquo;s a pause before Peter answers, before he slowly nods again. </p><p>Tony slowly gets up before walking over and sitting down next to Peter. &ldquo;Can I touch you?&rdquo; He asks, because he doesn&rsquo;t want to scare the kid. He wants (needs) Peter to know that he isn&rsquo;t like whoever did <i>this</i> to him. </p><p>Peter doesn&rsquo;t nod or shake his head this time. He just leans buries his head into the crook of Tony&rsquo;s shoulder, and breathes in shakily. Tony carefully wraps his arms around the kid, creating an awkward kind of side hug, but he doesn&rsquo;t care. Peter needs the comfort more than Tony needs the feeling of non-awkwardness.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m s-so sorry,&rdquo; Peter finally says, his voice muffled by Tony&rsquo;s shirt. &ldquo;I- I don&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo; Peter fades off into sniffles as he cries.</p><p>Tony gently shushes him while combing his fingers through Peter&rsquo;s hair. &ldquo;<b>Who did this to you</b>, Peter?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter shakes his head weakly, &ldquo;No one. It was just something that happened on patrol.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; Tony says, voice hard. He immediately regrets it when Peter flinches away from him.</p><p>Peter sits up, looking at the ground instead of Tony&rsquo;s eyes, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing. Please, just drop it.&rdquo;</p><p>But the silent plea is still there, and it isn&rsquo;t for Tony to drop it. It&rsquo;s a plea for help, and Tony isn&rsquo;t going to let the kid down. &ldquo;<b>You can lie to yourself but don&rsquo;t lie to me</b>. This isn&rsquo;t nothing, Peter. Someone&rsquo;s hurting you.&rdquo; Someone&rsquo;s been hurting you is what Tony wants to say, because how had he not noticed the differences. How ad he not noticed Peter being abused. </p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark, no one&rsquo;s hurting me,&rdquo; Peter mumbles, but his voice is wrong. Mechanical as if this is something he&rsquo;s been told over and over again. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just to toughen me up.

        "question": "Peter figuring out his sexual/romantic orientation because identities are difficult (not just the one behind the mask)",
        "answer": "<p>Peter was fourteen when he realized that he might not be straight. This was also when he got bitten by a radioactive spider so he kind of postponed the whole thinking about who he liked because he was too busy sticking to things.\u00a0</p><p>Then his uncle died and he focused on that a lot with his wonderings about sexuality in the background of his mind. Then he met Tony Stark who was one of those famous people that everyone knows is not straight so he got kind of too excited. The guy wasn\u2019t just his superhero hero, but also his hero as a person. If that makes any sense.\u00a0</p><p>It was only after the whole mess with the Vulture and May finding out about Spider-Man, that Peter was able to actually think about who the fuck he liked. It was actually pretty confusing. He saw some guys that he thought were hot and he saw girls that he liked and sometimes he didn\u2019t feel like he liked anyone and it was just a mess while he tried to figure it out and put labels on what he felt.\u00a0</p><p>He joined LGBT groups as an ally at first because he didn\u2019t want to confess that he was questioning what he felt and he learned all the names for what people felt. He learned that there was a difference between romantic orientations and sexual orientations and that there were names for everything. It was pretty exciting and he only ended up talking to Ned about it.\u00a0</p><p>He was never sure how May would react, although he was sure that she would still love him, he just never heard her talk about anything to do with gay stuff. But it wouldn\u2019t matter anyway, Peter was horrible at keeping secrets and May knew her nephew inside and out. She knew when something was wrong and when he started\u00a0coming home happier and with a colorful pin on the inside of his jacket.\u00a0</p><p>After a few months, she confronted him about it. At first, she had wanted him to come to her about it when he was ready but she thought that pulling off the bandage would be easier and would save him the stress. Because of course, she would support him no matter what. It was a particularly good day when she decided to bring it up.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo Peter&hellip; do you remember when gay marriage\u00a0was legalized and then a few months later, Ultron decided to be a thing and everyone blamed this end of the world on being nice to the gays.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cUh, yeah. That was weird.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cDo you remember how happy I was when gay marriage was legalized.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t&hellip; I was not politically aware.\u201d Peter said nervously.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI was very happy. Do you want to know why?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201c&hellip;why&hellip;\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m Bisexual. I mean I was in a straight relationship with your uncle but I had a lot of lesbian friends, remember Audrey?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah, she\u2019s the blonde one right?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYup, She\u2019s a lesbian, and we even dated for a bit in high school.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cReally? So you wouldn\u2019t be mad if I said that I uh&hellip; wasn\u2019t straight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I be mad? You\u2019re literally a vigilante on your downtime, I would much rather have you be dating your friend than catch speeding cars for fun.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m&hellip; not dating Ned.\u201d Peter sputtered. May raised one of her eyebrows and Peter sighed.\u00a0\u201cOkay, that one time was be trying to change out of my Spider-Man suit it doesn\u2019t count.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cUh huh&hellip; Well, no wonder you idolize Mr. Stark so much. Not many proud queer people are also superheroes.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cDo you have some superhero gossip Spider-Man?\u201d May grinned.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t met that many superheroes but Tony likes to talk. So you know Black Widow?\u201d Peter grinned back. He didn\u2019t think that it would be&hellip; this easy to talk about this kind of stuff to someone who meant so much to him but it was definitely a surprise to find out that his aunt was in the community too. Later he learned that she didn\u2019t feel like she could talk about it because she married Ben and that was a pretty straight thing to do. She didn\u2019t feel part of the community even though she liked girls just as much as she liked guys.\u00a0<br/></p><p>But Peter promised her that she was still perfectly queer. They googled the dates for the next pride festival. And they started to plan for it even though Peter still wasn\u2019t sure what flags he would wear, he didn\u2019t even know what he identified as. May assured him that he\u2019ll figure it out eventually and for the first time in years, Peter was able to breathe again.\u00a0</p>",
