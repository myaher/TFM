He wasn\u2019t going to university, but he was\ngoing to be working at Andrea\u2019s store. When she\u2019d offered him the job he\u2019d\nhardly been able to believe his ears. Working at a bookstore had never been\nsomething he\u2019d considered to be an option, really, but the moment the\nopportunity presented itself he knew that he had to take it. It was where he\nbelonged, with the books and sturdy enduringness of stories. They had helped\nhim escape so many times and now he was getting the chance to help other people\nstep into new worlds. </p><p>It was two weeks since\nhe had been discharged from Hyacinth Psychiatric hospital and two months since\nhe had last hurt himself.
