The office chair she had been sitting upon for the past six hours reclining back ever so slightly, spinning momentarily before coming to a complete stop. She threw her whole body forward resting her head on her hands huffing out an overly dramatic breath. This paperwork was going to be the death of her, her boss was almost certain there was a mistake, a misprint, a typo, god knows what it was but the was one somewhere and she couldn&rsquo;t find it for the life of her. She took a breath closing her eyes and calming herself down, one more read through and she was going home. Sorting the papers in order once more, she stretched her neck getting back to her job. </p><p>Tae sat at the other end of the office typing out his reports that were due weeks ago, he checked his watch grimacing slightly at the late hour. He looked around at the empty office desks and sighed, getting up he decided it was best to abandon the report to \u2018stretch his legs\u2019. Walking over to the water cooler he spotted her sitting at the desk reading with a scowl on her brow, he smirked as she let out an exasperated sigh, throwing down the piece of paper and aggressively scratching her head. He looked over her shoulder reading the paper along with her. </p><!-- more --><p>\u2018That should be their not there.\u2019 He said pointing at the grammar mistake, her eyes widened circling it and sighing relieved. She looked up at him and smiled stiffly. </p><p>\u2018Great one down, possibly many more to go.\u2019 Sighing, she took the first page again reading more carefully, he pulled up a seat sitting beside her. </p><p>\u2018You know, I can help if you want, but you would have to do something for me in return.\u2019 She eyed him suspiciously, neglecting his suggestive tone. </p><p>\u2018I can\u2019t do your reports Tae, I have no idea what you put in those things.\u2019 She said facing him, their knees knocking together and slipping between each other. </p><p>\u2018No no, nothing like that, I was thinking something more to relieve both of our stress.\u2019 He spoke, voice a tad deeper than before. He caressed her cheek with one hand, sliding his other up her inner leg. A shiver shot up her spine, she had a crush on him, that was no secret, but this right now, had her head spinning more than the fucking reports. </p><p>\u2018Tae, I don\u2019t-\u2018 </p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not busy, those reports I\u2019m doing can wait, I don\u2019t care enough about them, let me do this for you.\u2019 Her eyes searched his face, she saw sincerity and want painted across his face. God he was attractive, his grey hair parting down the middle, his hair wasn\u2019t straight it sat in natural waves. The shirt he was wearing clung to his arms and torso tucking into some tight ass fitted trousers. </p><p>\u2018It\u2019s not really for me though is it?\u2019 He tilted his head in confusion, god how could he look so fucking cute, suggesting something so dirty. \u2018I just mean sure, you taking these reports off my hands helps, but the rest is for you is it not?\u2019 She spoke standing up walking over to the photocopier, she didn\u2019t need to make any copies, it was just a reason for him to follow her. She opened it up making sure no one had left anything sitting in it, she picked up the paper sitting inside rolling her eyes, of course it was destiny. Forgetful little so and so always leaves her things everywhere and anywhere, an angel with the worst memory. </p><p>\u2018How you going to photocopy anything if you didn\u2019t bring your papers with you? And I know this isn\u2019t only for me darling, I see the way you undress me with your eyes.\u2019 He was standing behind her, body pressed against hers, breath fanning the shell of her ear. She stiffened against him as he mentioned knowing. Knowing about her liking him, about her lusting over his ass in those fucking fitted trousers, knowing about the fact she could not and would not keep her eyes off him. \u2018Oh you thought I didn\u2019t know baby? I pay a lot more attention than you think.\u2019 He whispered planting kisses along her neck, she gripped onto the photocopier steadying herself, her knees could go from under her at any second. </p><p>\u2018Tae.\u2019 She moaned out, nothing more than a whisper. His hand trailed from her hip up to her stomach popping the button on her blazer open, she pouted in disappointment, that was her favourite one. He pulled her shirt out from inside her skirt, slowly working on the buttons as his other hand felt her up. </p><p>\u2018You sure this is still just for me babe?\u2019 He teased letting his finger graze across her panties, he could feel how wet she was already, fully enjoying the tension. \u2018You like being like this? Pushed up against a photocopier in public?\u2019 She let out a moan forgetting quickly that she wasn\u2019t at home, that she wasn\u2019t in the safety of her own bedroom, she was at work, in the copy room, about to be in a very unexplainable situation if they were found out. \u2018Darling, are you a closet exhibitionist?\u2019 She blushed letting out another moan as his finger tickled her inner thigh.  </p><p>\u2018Tae there\u2019s no cameras right?\u2019 She questioned suddenly nervous, he chuckled in her ear pulling her skirt up over her ass leaving it wrapped around her waist, he stepped back admiring the view of her bent over fully on show for him, he spanked her ass, it was too tempting not to.  </p><p>\u2018It doesn\u2019t matter, Jin works in the CCTV room, trust me.\u2019 She felt herself relax as she nodded knowing, even if someone saw, it would stay between the three of them. \u2018Let\u2019s give Jin a show then shall we? I bet he\u2019s desperate for something to happen.\u2019 She whimpered in agreement giving him the go ahead. Hooking his thumbs in her panties he pulled them down letting them sit around her ankles, she went to lift her leg to remove them when he stopped her.  </p><p>\u2018Leave them there for now baby, I like the image of you right now, skirt round your waist, panties around your heels, you look ready for me. Are you princess?\u2019 She nodded whimpering again, she was a mess, a horny and sexually frustrated mess.  </p><p>His finger trailed from her clit up to her entrance, he got down on his knees taking in the view. He placed a kiss just under her ass on her upper thigh, trailing them closer and closer to her entrance, she could feel herself literally dripping for him at this point.  </p><p>\u2018Please Tae, fuck please, do something.\u2019 She whined, he smirked licking a strip from her inner thigh up to her clit, skimming over it for half a second before pulling away again. She moaned trying to push her hips onto him, fuck if he would even just shove a finger in.  </p><p>\u2018Patience is a virtue, plus Jin likes that teasing shit.\u2019 She almost forgot someone was watching, that someone was seeing everything happening right now, her walls clenched around nothing getting wetter thinking about it. He slipped his finger inside making a moan rumble in her throat, loudly slipping through her lips, he bent his finger over and over curling it inside of her causing moans and whimpers to bounce around the room. As he put his mouth on her clit sucking gently, he unbuttoned his jeans releasing the tightness around his dick. His motions never stopped never letting up, she gripped on tightly to the copier as her orgasm built up inside of her. Her knees buckled under her frame as she came, shaking falling quickly onto his lap.  </p><p>\u2018That good huh?\u2019 He smirked, cockiness laced his voice, she rolled her eyes planting a kiss on his lips tasting herself on his mouth. He deepened the kiss quickly lifting her ass in the air so he could stand, he threw open the photocopier lid giving her a level surface to sit on, it flashed as he pulled it open and placed her ass down. The kissing never stopped as he pulled his jeans and boxers down, giving himself a few strokes, she made short work of his buttons popping open one after the other. Tae could feel buzzing around his feet, breaking the kiss he bent down picking out his phone seeing Jin\u2019s name flash across the screen. He smirked showing her the phone, a small coy smile flashed across her features as he answered putting it on speaker.  </p><p>\u2018Jin! How you doing buddy?\u2019 He spoke rubbing his fingers over her clit and other hand squeezing her breasts. They heard Jin\u2019s heavy breaths over the other end of the phone knowing exactly what he was doing, she made direct eye contact with the first camera she could see, Jin let out a moan in response, a cocky smirk fell across both their faces.  </p><p>\u2018What the hell are you doing man, do you realise the amount of footage I\u2019m going to have to fake!?\u2019 He questioned through breaths and subtle moans.  </p><p>\u2018Oh don\u2019t be such a spoil sport Jin, You can see all that\u2019s happening, do you want to hear her too?\u2019 Tae didn\u2019t give either of them a moment to reply, instead pulling her ass closer to him and pushing himself as far into her as he could, she screamed out grabbing onto his shirt for support, her back arching, clenching around the intrusion. Tae let out a moan in response, resting his head between her breasts, on the other end of the phone they heard a few string curse words before Jin spoke out.  </p><p>\u2018Keep going Tae, fuck her so good, maybe I\u2019ll get a taste next.\u2019 He spoke clenching his hand around his dick, the one screen that showed her sprawled out on the machine intentionally looking right into the camera, god she had the both of them wrapped around her little finger. Tae didn\u2019t need any more encouragement, pulling out slightly and pushing himself in balls deep.  </p><p>\u2018Ugh fuck, I\u2019ve been thinking about this for a while princess, ever since you bent over to help Destiny with her paperwork. Remember that day baby? You had a short skirt on, much like this, pink lace panties, fuck you know how hard that made me?\u2019 He moaned out, she rolled her eyes into the back of her head orgasm building, knowing two men were finding pleasure in her right now had her teetering on the edge of release.  </p><p>\u2018What I would have done to bend you over that desk there and then, fuck, are you close, I can feel you tightening around me.\u2019 His thumb found her clit rubbing circles quickly, her legs tightened around his waist one slipping off slamming into the buttons of the machine, she couldn\u2019t care less at this point if they broke it, the only thing she could focus on was her orgasm hitting her like a brick wall. She screamed out, back arching, he nuzzled his face into her neck kissing and moaning into it. Now she had stopped moaning she could hear both the boys moans, and god did they sound good.  </p><p>\u2018Cum for me, fuck I want it so bad.\u2019 She moaned looking straight into the camera, she heard Jin grunt before a string of curses and moans sounded out and some heavy breathing, Tae moments later hips stilling as his dick twitched a couple times inside of her. He pulled away breathless, helping her down like a gentleman, she pulled her panties back on and shuffled her skirt down.  </p><p>\u2018So just leave the papers on my desk I\u2019ll look at them before I leave.\u2019 She looked at him confused, both of them buttoning back up their shirts.  </p><p>\u2018Oh wait, you were serious about that?\u2019 She questioned startled, in all honesty she was game for it just being about sex.  </p><p>\u2018Yeah, and if I can be completely honest, I\u2019d like to take you out sometime too, or just home, I don\u2019t mind.\u2019 He smirked moving closer to her, wrapping his arm around her waist, she played with his top button pretending to think about it.  </p><p>\u2018Well I don\u2019t think I\u2019d mind-\u2018  </p><p>\u2018Guys sorry to kill the mood, but is there something in the copier?\u2019 She turned around thinking maybe it was just Destiny\u2019s paperwork, she picked it up looking through it all, she held back a laugh snorting instead.  </p><p>\u2018What? What is it?\u2019 He could hear Jin laughing through the phone, the camera was right behind her so he could see exactly what she was holding.  </p><p>\u2018Tae, that\u2019s your BALLSACK MAN!\u2019 Jin screamed through the phone, Tae\u2019s eyes widened as running to her side hanging up quickly on Jin. He picked the photos out of her hands flicking through them he smirked folding them up and placing them in his trouser pocket.  </p><p>\u2018Hey what you doing with them?!\u2019 She yelped out in horror. He held his hand out for her pulling her into his body, he trailed a finger over her cheek, looking into her eyes.  </p><p>\u2018Call it, physical wank bank, you see love its not just my balls, it\u2019s your ass too, and that shits hot.\u2019 She bit her lip leaning into his face trailing kisses along his jaw, down his neck and resting at his ear.  </p><p>\u2018Why would you need a wank bank when I\u2019m right here?\u2019</p>",

Walking over to the water cooler he spotted her sitting at the desk reading with a scowl on her brow, he smirked as she let out an exasperated sigh, throwing down the piece of paper and aggressively scratching her head. He looked over her shoulder reading the paper along with her. </p>[[MORE]]<p>\u2018That should be their not there.\u2019 He said pointing at the grammar mistake, her eyes widened circling it and sighing relieved. She looked up at him and smiled stiffly. </p><p>\u2018Great one down, possibly many more to go.\u2019 Sighing, she took the first page again reading more carefully, he pulled up a seat sitting beside her. </p><p>\u2018You know, I can help if you want, but you would have to do something for me in return.\u2019 She eyed him suspiciously, neglecting his suggestive tone. </p><p>\u2018I can\u2019t do your reports Tae, I have no idea what you put in those things.\u2019 She said facing him, their knees knocking together and slipping between each other. </p><p>\u2018No no, nothing like that, I was thinking something more to relieve both of our stress.\u2019 He spoke, voice a tad deeper than before. He caressed her cheek with one hand, sliding his other up her inner leg. A shiver shot up her spine, she had a crush on him, that was no secret, but this right now, had her head spinning more than the fucking reports. </p><p>\u2018Tae, I don\u2019t-\u2018 </p><p>\u2018I\u2019m not busy, those reports I\u2019m doing can wait, I don\u2019t care enough about them, let me do this for you.\u2019 Her eyes searched his face, she saw sincerity and want painted across his face. God he was attractive, his grey hair parting down the middle, his hair wasn\u2019t straight it sat in natural waves. The shirt he was wearing clung to his arms and torso tucking into some tight ass fitted trousers. </p><p>\u2018It\u2019s not really for me though is it?\u2019 He tilted his head in confusion, god how could he look so fucking cute, suggesting something so dirty. \u2018I just mean sure, you taking these reports off my hands helps, but the rest is for you is it not?\u2019 She spoke standing up walking over to the photocopier, she didn\u2019t need to make any copies, it was just a reason for him to follow her. She opened it up making sure no one had left anything sitting in it, she picked up the paper sitting inside rolling her eyes, of course it was destiny. Forgetful little so and so always leaves her things everywhere and anywhere, an angel with the worst memory. </p><p>\u2018How you going to photocopy anything if you didn\u2019t bring your papers with you? And I know this isn\u2019t only for me darling, I see the way you undress me with your eyes.\u2019 He was standing behind her, body pressed against hers, breath fanning the shell of her ear. She stiffened against him as he mentioned knowing. Knowing about her liking him, about her lusting over his ass in those fucking fitted trousers, knowing about the fact she could not and would not keep her eyes off him. \u2018Oh you thought I didn\u2019t know baby? I pay a lot more attention than you think.\u2019 He whispered planting kisses along her neck, she gripped onto the photocopier steadying herself, her knees could go from under her at any second. </p><p>\u2018Tae.\u2019 She moaned out, nothing more than a whisper. His hand trailed from her hip up to her stomach popping the button on her blazer open, she pouted in disappointment, that was her favourite one. He pulled her shirt out from inside her skirt, slowly working on the buttons as his other hand felt her up. </p><p>\u2018You sure this is still just for me babe?\u2019 He teased letting his finger graze across her panties, he could feel how wet she was already, fully enjoying the tension. \u2018You like being like this? Pushed up against a photocopier in public?\u2019 She let out a moan forgetting quickly that she wasn\u2019t at home, that she wasn\u2019t in the safety of her own bedroom, she was at work, in the copy room, about to be in a very unexplainable situation if they were found out. \u2018Darling, are you a closet exhibitionist?\u2019 She blushed letting out another moan as his finger tickled her inner thigh.  </p><p>\u2018Tae there\u2019s no cameras right?\u2019 She questioned suddenly nervous, he chuckled in her ear pulling her skirt up over her ass leaving it wrapped around her waist, he stepped back admiring the view of her bent over fully on show for him, he spanked her ass, it was too tempting not to.  </p><p>\u2018It doesn\u2019t matter, Jin works in the CCTV room, trust me.\u2019 She felt herself relax as she nodded knowing, even if someone saw, it would stay between the three of them. \u2018Let\u2019s give Jin a show then shall we? I bet he\u2019s desperate for something to happen.\u2019 She whimpered in agreement giving him the go ahead. Hooking his thumbs in her panties he pulled them down letting them sit around her ankles, she went to lift her leg to remove them when he stopped her.  </p><p>\u2018Leave them there for now baby, I like the image of you right now, skirt round your waist, panties around your heels, you look ready for me. Are you princess?\u2019 She nodded whimpering again, she was a mess, a horny and sexually frustrated mess.  </p><p>His finger trailed from her clit up to her entrance, he got down on his knees taking in the view. He placed a kiss just under her ass on her upper thigh, trailing them closer and closer to her entrance, she could feel herself literally dripping for him at this point.  </p><p>\u2018Please Tae, fuck please, do something.\u2019 She whined, he smirked licking a strip from her inner thigh up to her clit, skimming over it for half a second before pulling away again. She moaned trying to push her hips onto him, fuck if he would even just shove a finger in.  </p><p>\u2018Patience is a virtue, plus Jin likes that teasing shit.\u2019 She almost forgot someone was watching, that someone was seeing everything happening right now, her walls clenched around nothing getting wetter thinking about it. He slipped his finger inside making a moan rumble in her throat, loudly slipping through her lips, he bent his finger over and over curling it inside of her causing moans and whimpers to bounce around the room. As he put his mouth on her clit sucking gently, he unbuttoned his jeans releasing the tightness around his dick. His motions never stopped never letting up, she gripped on tightly to the copier as her orgasm built up inside of her. Her knees buckled under her frame as she came, shaking falling quickly onto his lap.  </p><p>\u2018That good huh?\u2019 He smirked, cockiness laced his voice, she rolled her eyes planting a kiss on his lips tasting herself on his mouth. He deepened the kiss quickly lifting her ass in the air so he could stand, he threw open the photocopier lid giving her a level surface to sit on, it flashed as he pulled it open and placed her ass down. The kissing never stopped as he pulled his jeans and boxers down, giving himself a few strokes, she made short work of his buttons popping open one after the other. Tae could feel buzzing around his feet, breaking the kiss he bent down picking out his phone seeing Jin\u2019s name flash across the screen. He smirked showing her the phone, a small coy smile flashed across her features as he answered putting it on speaker.  </p><p>\u2018Jin! How you doing buddy?\u2019 He spoke rubbing his fingers over her clit and other hand squeezing her breasts. They heard Jin\u2019s heavy breaths over the other end of the phone knowing exactly what he was doing, she made direct eye contact with the first camera she could see, Jin let out a moan in response, a cocky smirk fell across both their faces.  </p><p>\u2018What the hell are you doing man, do you realise the amount of footage I\u2019m going to have to fake!?\u2019 He questioned through breaths and subtle moans.  </p><p>\u2018Oh don\u2019t be such a spoil sport Jin, You can see all that\u2019s happening, do you want to hear her too?\u2019 Tae didn\u2019t give either of them a moment to reply, instead pulling her ass closer to him and pushing himself as far into her as he could, she screamed out grabbing onto his shirt for support, her back arching, clenching around the intrusion. Tae let out a moan in response, resting his head between her breasts, on the other end of the phone they heard a few string curse words before Jin spoke out.  </p><p>\u2018Keep going Tae, fuck her so good, maybe I\u2019ll get a taste next.\u2019 He spoke clenching his hand around his dick, the one screen that showed her sprawled out on the machine intentionally looking right into the camera, god she had the both of them wrapped around her little finger. Tae didn\u2019t need any more encouragement, pulling out slightly and pushing himself in balls deep.  </p><p>\u2018Ugh fuck, I\u2019ve been thinking about this for a while princess, ever since you bent over to help Destiny with her paperwork. Remember that day baby? You had a short skirt on, much like this, pink lace panties, fuck you know how hard that made me?\u2019 He moaned out, she rolled her eyes into the back of her head orgasm building, knowing two men were finding pleasure in her right now had her teetering on the edge of release.  </p><p>\u2018What I would have done to bend you over that desk there and then, fuck, are you close, I can feel you tightening around me.\u2019 His thumb found her clit rubbing circles quickly, her legs tightened around his waist one slipping off slamming into the buttons of the machine, she couldn\u2019t care less at this point if they broke it, the only thing she could focus on was her orgasm hitting her like a brick wall. She screamed out, back arching, he nuzzled his face into her neck kissing and moaning into it. Now she had stopped moaning she could hear both the boys moans, and god did they sound good.  </p><p>\u2018Cum for me, fuck I want it so bad.\u2019 She moaned looking straight into the camera, she heard Jin grunt before a string of curses and moans sounded out and some heavy breathing, Tae moments later hips stilling as his dick twitched a couple times inside of her. He pulled away breathless, helping her down like a gentleman, she pulled her panties back on and shuffled her skirt down.  </p><p>\u2018So just leave the papers on my desk I\u2019ll look at them before I leave.\u2019 She looked at him confused, both of them buttoning back up their shirts.  </p><p>\u2018Oh wait, you were serious about that?\u2019 She questioned startled, in all honesty she was game for it just being about sex.  </p><p>\u2018Yeah, and if I can be completely honest, I\u2019d like to take you out sometime too, or just home, I don\u2019t mind.\u2019 He smirked moving closer to her, wrapping his arm around her waist, she played with his top button pretending to think about it.  </p><p>\u2018Well I don\u2019t think I\u2019d mind-\u2018  </p><p>\u2018Guys sorry to kill the mood, but is there something in the copier?\u2019 She turned around thinking maybe it was just Destiny\u2019s paperwork, she picked it up looking through it all, she held back a laugh snorting instead.  </p><p>\u2018What?

Are you princess?\u2019 She nodded whimpering again, she was a mess, a horny and sexually frustrated mess.  </p><p>His finger trailed from her clit up to her entrance, he got down on his knees taking in the view. He placed a kiss just under her ass on her upper thigh, trailing them closer and closer to her entrance, she could feel herself literally dripping for him at this point.  </p><p>\u2018Please Tae, fuck please, do something.\u2019 She whined, he smirked licking a strip from her inner thigh up to her clit, skimming over it for half a second before pulling away again. She moaned trying to push her hips onto him, fuck if he would even just shove a finger in.  </p><p>\u2018Patience is a virtue, plus Jin likes that teasing shit.\u2019 She almost forgot someone was watching, that someone was seeing everything happening right now, her walls clenched around nothing getting wetter thinking about it. He slipped his finger inside making a moan rumble in her throat, loudly slipping through her lips, he bent his finger over and over curling it inside of her causing moans and whimpers to bounce around the room. As he put his mouth on her clit sucking gently, he unbuttoned his jeans releasing the tightness around his dick. His motions never stopped never letting up, she gripped on tightly to the copier as her orgasm built up inside of her. Her knees buckled under her frame as she came, shaking falling quickly onto his lap.  </p><p>\u2018That good huh?\u2019 He smirked, cockiness laced his voice, she rolled her eyes planting a kiss on his lips tasting herself on his mouth. He deepened the kiss quickly lifting her ass in the air so he could stand, he threw open the photocopier lid giving her a level surface to sit on, it flashed as he pulled it open and placed her ass down. The kissing never stopped as he pulled his jeans and boxers down, giving himself a few strokes, she made short work of his buttons popping open one after the other. Tae could feel buzzing around his feet, breaking the kiss he bent down picking out his phone seeing Jin\u2019s name flash across the screen. He smirked showing her the phone, a small coy smile flashed across her features as he answered putting it on speaker.  </p><p>\u2018Jin! How you doing buddy?\u2019 He spoke rubbing his fingers over her clit and other hand squeezing her breasts. They heard Jin\u2019s heavy breaths over the other end of the phone knowing exactly what he was doing, she made direct eye contact with the first camera she could see, Jin let out a moan in response, a cocky smirk fell across both their faces.  </p><p>\u2018What the hell are you doing man, do you realise the amount of footage I\u2019m going to have to fake!?\u2019 He questioned through breaths and subtle moans.  </p><p>\u2018Oh don\u2019t be such a spoil sport Jin, You can see all that\u2019s happening, do you want to hear her too?\u2019 Tae didn\u2019t give either of them a moment to reply, instead pulling her ass closer to him and pushing himself as far into her as he could, she screamed out grabbing onto his shirt for support, her back arching, clenching around the intrusion. Tae let out a moan in response, resting his head between her breasts, on the other end of the phone they heard a few string curse words before Jin spoke out.  </p><p>\u2018Keep going Tae, fuck her so good, maybe I\u2019ll get a taste next.\u2019 He spoke clenching his hand around his dick, the one screen that showed her sprawled out on the machine intentionally looking right into the camera, god she had the both of them wrapped around her little finger. Tae didn\u2019t need any more encouragement, pulling out slightly and pushing himself in balls deep.  </p><p>\u2018Ugh fuck, I\u2019ve been thinking about this for a while princess, ever since you bent over to help Destiny with her paperwork. Remember that day baby? You had a short skirt on, much like this, pink lace panties, fuck you know how hard that made me?\u2019 He moaned out, she rolled her eyes into the back of her head orgasm building, knowing two men were finding pleasure in her right now had her teetering on the edge of release.  </p><p>\u2018What I would have done to bend you over that desk there and then, fuck, are you close, I can feel you tightening around me.\u2019 His thumb found her clit rubbing circles quickly, her legs tightened around his waist one slipping off slamming into the buttons of the machine, she couldn\u2019t care less at this point if they broke it, the only thing she could focus on was her orgasm hitting her like a brick wall. She screamed out, back arching, he nuzzled his face into her neck kissing and moaning into it. Now she had stopped moaning she could hear both the boys moans, and god did they sound good.  </p><p>\u2018Cum for me, fuck I want it so bad.\u2019 She moaned looking straight into the camera, she heard Jin grunt before a string of curses and moans sounded out and some heavy breathing, Tae moments later hips stilling as his dick twitched a couple times inside of her. He pulled away breathless, helping her down like a gentleman, she pulled her panties back on and shuffled her skirt down.  </p><p>\u2018So just leave the papers on my desk I\u2019ll look at them before I leave.\u2019 She looked at him confused, both of them buttoning back up their shirts.  </p><p>\u2018Oh wait, you were serious about that?\u2019 She questioned startled, in all honesty she was game for it just being about sex.  </p><p>\u2018Yeah, and if I can be completely honest, I\u2019d like to take you out sometime too, or just home, I don\u2019t mind.\u2019 He smirked moving closer to her, wrapping his arm around her waist, she played with his top button pretending to think about it.  </p><p>\u2018Well I don\u2019t think I\u2019d mind-\u2018  </p><p>\u2018Guys sorry to kill the mood, but is there something in the copier?\u2019 She turned around thinking maybe it was just Destiny\u2019s paperwork, she picked it up looking through it all, she held back a laugh snorting instead.  </p><p>\u2018What? What is it?\u2019 He could hear Jin laughing through the phone, the camera was right behind her so he could see exactly what she was holding.  </p><p>\u2018Tae, that\u2019s your BALLSACK MAN!\u2019 Jin screamed through the phone, Tae\u2019s eyes widened as running to her side hanging up quickly on Jin. He picked the photos out of her hands flicking through them he smirked folding them up and placing them in his trouser pocket.  </p><p>\u2018Hey what you doing with them?!\u2019 She yelped out in horror. He held his hand out for her pulling her into his body, he trailed a finger over her cheek, looking into her eyes.  </p><p>\u2018Call it, physical wank bank, you see love its not just my balls, it\u2019s your ass too, and that shits hot.\u2019 She bit her lip leaning into his face trailing kisses along his jaw, down his neck and resting at his ear.  </p><p>\u2018Why would you need a wank bank when I\u2019m right here?\u2019</p></p>",
                "content": "<p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>She huffed out a sigh throwing her head back and placing her hands over her face. The office chair she had been sitting upon for the past six hours reclining back ever so slightly, spinning momentarily before coming to a complete stop. She threw her whole body forward resting her head on her hands huffing out an overly dramatic breath. This paperwork was going to be the death of her, her boss was almost certain there was a mistake, a misprint, a typo, god knows what it was but the was one somewhere and she couldn&rsquo;t find it for the life of her. She took a breath closing her eyes and calming herself down, one more read through and she was going home. Sorting the papers in order once more, she stretched her neck getting back to her job. </p><p>Tae sat at the other end of the office typing out his reports that were due weeks ago, he checked his watch grimacing slightly at the late hour. He looked around at the empty office desks and sighed, getting up he decided it was best to abandon the report to &lsquo;stretch his legs&rsquo;. Walking over to the water cooler he spotted her sitting at the desk reading with a scowl on her brow, he smirked as she let out an exasperated sigh, throwing down the piece of paper and aggressively scratching her head. He looked over her shoulder reading the paper along with her. </p><p>&lsquo;That should be their not there.&rsquo; He said pointing at the grammar mistake, her eyes widened circling it and sighing relieved. She looked up at him and smiled stiffly. </p><p>&lsquo;Great one down, possibly many more to go.&rsquo; Sighing, she took the first page again reading more carefully, he pulled up a seat sitting beside her. </p><p>&lsquo;You know, I can help if you want, but you would have to do something for me in return.&rsquo; She eyed him suspiciously, neglecting his suggestive tone. </p><p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t do your reports Tae, I have no idea what you put in those things.&rsquo; She said facing him, their knees knocking together and slipping between each other. </p><p>&lsquo;No no, nothing like that, I was thinking something more to relieve both of our stress.&rsquo; He spoke, voice a tad deeper than before. He caressed her cheek with one hand, sliding his other up her inner leg. A shiver shot up her spine, she had a crush on him, that was no secret, but this right now, had her head spinning more than the fucking reports. </p><p>&lsquo;Tae, I don&rsquo;t-&lsquo; </p><p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not busy, those reports I&rsquo;m doing can wait, I don&rsquo;t care enough about them, let me do this for you.&rsquo; Her eyes searched his face, she saw sincerity and want painted across his face. God he was attractive, his grey hair parting down the middle, his hair wasn&rsquo;t straight it sat in natural waves. The shirt he was wearing clung to his arms and torso tucking into some tight ass fitted trousers. </p><p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s not really for me though is it?&rsquo; He tilted his head in confusion, god how could he look so fucking cute, suggesting something so dirty. &lsquo;I just mean sure, you taking these reports off my hands helps, but the rest is for you is it not?&rsquo; She spoke standing up walking over to the photocopier, she didn&rsquo;t need to make any copies, it was just a reason for him to follow her. She opened it up making sure no one had left anything sitting in it, she picked up the paper sitting inside rolling her eyes, of course it was destiny. Forgetful little so and so always leaves her things everywhere and anywhere, an angel with the worst memory. </p><p>&lsquo;How you going to photocopy anything if you didn&rsquo;t bring your papers with you? And I know this isn&rsquo;t only for me darling, I see the way you undress me with your eyes.&rsquo; He was standing behind her, body pressed against hers, breath fanning the shell of her ear. She stiffened against him as he mentioned knowing. Knowing about her liking him, about her lusting over his ass in those fucking fitted trousers, knowing about the fact she could not and would not keep her eyes off him. &lsquo;Oh you thought I didn&rsquo;t know baby? I pay a lot more attention than you think.&rsquo; He whispered planting kisses along her neck, she gripped onto the photocopier steadying herself, her knees could go from under her at any second. </p><p>&lsquo;Tae.&rsquo; She moaned out, nothing more than a whisper. His hand trailed from her hip up to her stomach popping the button on her blazer open, she pouted in disappointment, that was her favourite one. He pulled her shirt out from inside her skirt, slowly working on the buttons as his other hand felt her up. </p><p>&lsquo;You sure this is still just for me babe?&rsquo; He teased letting his finger graze across her panties, he could feel how wet she was already, fully enjoying the tension. &lsquo;You like being like this? Pushed up against a photocopier in public?&rsquo; She let out a moan forgetting quickly that she wasn&rsquo;t at home, that she wasn&rsquo;t in the safety of her own bedroom, she was at work, in the copy room, about to be in a very unexplainable situation if they were found out. &lsquo;Darling, are you a closet exhibitionist?&rsquo; She blushed letting out another moan as his finger tickled her inner thigh.  </p><p>&lsquo;Tae there&rsquo;s no cameras right?&rsquo; She questioned suddenly nervous, he chuckled in her ear pulling her skirt up over her ass leaving it wrapped around her waist, he stepped back admiring the view of her bent over fully on show for him, he spanked her ass, it was too tempting not to.  </p><p>&lsquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter, Jin works in the CCTV room, trust me.&rsquo; She felt herself relax as she nodded knowing, even if someone saw, it would stay between the three of them. &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s give Jin a show then shall we? I bet he&rsquo;s desperate for something to happen.&rsquo; She whimpered in agreement giving him the go ahead. Hooking his thumbs in her panties he pulled them down letting them sit around her ankles, she went to lift her leg to remove them when he stopped her.  </p><p>&lsquo;Leave them there for now baby, I like the image of you right now, skirt round your waist, panties around your heels, you look ready for me.

He smirked showing her the phone, a small coy smile flashed across her features as he answered putting it on speaker.  </p><p>&lsquo;Jin! How you doing buddy?&rsquo; He spoke rubbing his fingers over her clit and other hand squeezing her breasts. They heard Jin&rsquo;s heavy breaths over the other end of the phone knowing exactly what he was doing, she made direct eye contact with the first camera she could see, Jin let out a moan in response, a cocky smirk fell across both their faces.  </p><p>&lsquo;What the hell are you doing man, do you realise the amount of footage I&rsquo;m going to have to fake!?&rsquo; He questioned through breaths and subtle moans.  </p><p>&lsquo;Oh don&rsquo;t be such a spoil sport Jin, You can see all that&rsquo;s happening, do you want to hear her too?&rsquo; Tae didn&rsquo;t give either of them a moment to reply, instead pulling her ass closer to him and pushing himself as far into her as he could, she screamed out grabbing onto his shirt for support, her back arching, clenching around the intrusion.
