            "description": "Hi there! My name is Ellie! Welcome to my tumblr! \u00a0Just thought I'd add a few things to know about me and my blog! If my url gives you any clues, at the heart of this tumblr, I'm a proud Harmony shipper through and through. And while I do still reblog HHR and Dan and Emma content (and I always will) you will find that the majority of my focus has shifted to Jonerys (Jon x Daenerys from Game of Thrones).\u00a0And while you might have to do a little deep blogging to find my reblogs on these, I also ship--both passionately and casually--Cesare x Lucrezia, Mulder x Scully, Lizzington for a while until tptb started to mess with it, Baker x Lawson (Bawson), all the Sense8 ships though Kalagang is my #1, Clint x Natasha (Clintasha), Jane x Thor (Fosterson), Darcy x Loki (Tasertricks), Darcy x Steve (Shieldshock), Kili x Tauriel (Kiliel), Superman x Wonder Woman (Superwonder), and more than I have space for or the memory to list. \nI do my best to tag every post so that if something is your notp, it's nsfw, or it's triggering, you can blacklist it. That said, if you follow me and there is something that you need tagged in order to make it a happy place for you to explore, come into my inbox and let me know :) You will also see a lot of politically charged reblogs in support of women, the queer/gender-queer and trans community, BLM, Muslims, POC, Jewish people, the mentally ill, and austistic people. I'm strongly pro choice, pro inter-sectional feminism, and refuse to call the angry cheeto currently living in the white house president. If anything like that offends you, this might not be the right blog for you.\nLast little few things to throw out there: I'm 35, I plan to adopt at least 4 cats (or more) at some point and be that cat lady everyone's always whispering about, and I tend to greet and converse with everyone I meet like an overeager puppy. \nWhew! Sorry for the long intro folks! Please enjoy your time here, and remember, you're always welcome to come in and say hi!",

The Starks rode south from Castle Black, with the Nights Watch and a Wildling Army, and eventually the Knights fo the Vale, and they liberated the North.\u00a0</p><p>The parallel of the liberation of the Slave Cities in Essos and the Liberation of the North from the Boltons are so clear.

They proclaimed Robb Stark, they followed Torren Stark many years before, they followed Ned as Warden of the North, and, when finally given the chance, they <i>chose</i>\u00a0to follow Jon and Sansa again, to follow House Stark again.\u00a0</p><p>When Daenerys showed up, and got Jon to bend the knee, it was, in her eyes, her taking her rightful place as queen of these lands. But to the eyes of the Northmen, she was simply once again taking away their choice to be led by the <i>King they chose. </i>The people of the North don\u2019t take kindly to her arrival because she comes North, with her massive and threatening army of incredibly skilled soldiers, and they have seen this story before. They have seen a King come North, and take their Warden South, never to return. They have seen men from other lands arrive, with armies, sent to protect them (don\u2019t forget Ramsey was sent by Lord Bolton at the request of Robb Stark to free Winterfell from the Iron Born and return it to House Stark), who then conquered them, leading to a period of fear. They have seen what happens when a King in the North bows to a Targaryen, whether there was a time of peace or not, the North became a part of the Seven Kingdoms, and because of that, they have been at war for a long time. When Daenerys comes North, with her armies and her dragons, and the Northmen are then told that she is now their queen, she expects them to love her, to welcome her, because she arrived with Jon, and because she is there to rescue them from the Dead. But that was never what was going to happen.\u00a0</p><p>Daenerys expected love, but she was met with at best indifference, and at worst anger. She was met with the Wildlings, who didn\u2019t give a damn about her, because they came for Jon, they fight for Jon, they are loyal to Jon. He is their King. She is met with Sansa, who fought for her home, who won it back from her captors, and who refuses to allow Northern Independence to be ripped away from her yet again. She is met with everything <i>but</i>\u00a0love. Daenerys expected to come to Westeros, and to find a people waiting for their rightful queen to free them from tyranny. But instead, she met Lords and Kings of great houses and independent lands who did not need her to free their people, because their people loved them.\u00a0</p><p>I think when the Bells rang in KL, Dany finally saw it all for what it was. Even as much as the people hated Cersei, they did not ring the bells because they were rejoicing at the great Breaker of Chains coming to liberate them from tyranny. They did not ring the bells in celebration of their freedom from Cersei Lannister. They did not ring the bells to signal the arrival of the one true Queen. They looked upon a great dragon, burning ships and city walls and armies to the ground, perched upon the edges of their city, with giant armies at their gates, and they rang the bells in surrender, because they <i>feared</i>\u00a0her. Daenerys listened to them, and heard the bells ringing, and realised that she was right. She had no love in Westeros, and, admittedly because of Cersei, she never would. The people of the North did not love her. The people of Kings Landing did not love her. I think the bells pushed Dany over the edge, not because of her grief, not because she was being framed as\u00a0\u2018irrational\u2019, but because she realised that fear was all she would ever have here. No matter how good of a Queen she became, to take the Throne, to some degree, she would have to do something that would make her image in this land be a mirror of her father. To take the Iron Throne, she would have to be a Targaryen. To be the Queen, it would have to be with Fire and Blood.\u00a0</p><p>So she decides that if it must be fear, let it be the greatest fear the people have ever known. Let them cower at the thought of their Queen. Because if she is going to lead with fear, she might as well lead with terror, because who would fight against such a thing.\u00a0</p><p>Dany has been heading towards being Dark!Dany for a long time, and I honestly think that (even though it was rushed), it was done well. I think loosing Missandei (though an infuriating fridging) was meant to symbolise Daenerys finally giving up the delusion that she could be loved in Westeros. Dark!Daenerys comes from a realisation she is a Dragon, and she will take what is hers with Fire and Blood, and if it cannot be love&hellip; let it be terror.\u00a0</p>",

They looked upon a great dragon, burning ships and city walls and armies to the ground, perched upon the edges of their city, with giant armies at their gates, and they rang the bells in surrender, because they <i>feared</i>&nbsp;her. Daenerys listened to them, and heard the bells ringing, and realised that she was right. She had no love in Westeros, and, admittedly because of Cersei, she never would. The people of the North did not love her. The people of Kings Landing did not love her. I think the bells pushed Dany over the edge, not because of her grief, not because she was being framed as&nbsp;&lsquo;irrational&rsquo;, but because she realised that fear was all she would ever have here. No matter how good of a Queen she became, to take the Throne, to some degree, she would have to do something that would make her image in this land be a mirror of her father. To take the Iron Throne, she would have to be a Targaryen. To be the Queen, it would have to be with Fire and Blood.&nbsp;</p><p>So she decides that if it must be fear, let it be the greatest fear the people have ever known. Let them cower at the thought of their Queen. Because if she is going to lead with fear, she might as well lead with terror, because who would fight against such a thing.&nbsp;</p><p>Dany has been heading towards being Dark!Dany for a long time, and I honestly think that (even though it was rushed), it was done well. I think loosing Missandei (though an infuriating fridging) was meant to symbolise Daenerys finally giving up the delusion that she could be loved in Westeros. Dark!Daenerys comes from a realisation she is a Dragon, and she will take what is hers with Fire and Blood, and if it cannot be love&hellip; let it be terror.&nbsp;</p>",
