The boy had broken into a relieved smile, hugging him\nback with one arm around his broad frame, the other hidden behind his back.\nTony didn&rsquo;t seem to notice, patting Peter on the back and then holding him at\narms length, getting a good look at him. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s school been, kid?

I wouldn&rsquo;t\nhave time to do my studies and to get a job. Like, a paid job. I don&rsquo;t want to\nlive with aunt May forever and keep draining her income to take care of me.

He took a deep breath\nbefore lifting his eyes off the ground and to the other man&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;I was\npracticing some cool new flips and swings and I accidentally undershot how far\naway a building was.

Bullied? Peter Parker? It didn&rsquo;t seem\npossible, but the boy in front of him refused to meet his eyes, and Tony knew\nhe wasn&rsquo;t lying this time. He gently set Peter&rsquo;s arm down by his side, then\ngrabbed his keys off his desk. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Come\non, kid, we&rsquo;re going to get this fixed, and don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m paying for\nit.&ldquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tony\nset a hand on Peter&rsquo;s shoulder, steering him carefully out of the room and\ntowards the garage.
