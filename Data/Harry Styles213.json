After being busy with studying hard and balancing your <g class=\"gr_ gr_221 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"221\" data-gr-id=\"221\">part time</g> job, your friend Georgia finally convinced you to come out to the club. It was fun getting dressed <g class=\"gr_ gr_294 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"294\" data-gr-id=\"294\">up,</g> and spending time with Georgia who you met through school.</p><p>Clubs weren\u2019t really your thing. <g class=\"gr_ gr_250 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"250\" data-gr-id=\"250\">Usually</g> you either end up getting really drunk and make bad decisions, or <g class=\"gr_ gr_251 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling multiReplace\" id=\"251\" data-gr-id=\"251\">your</g> to sober to put up with the constant attention from guys. They would try their hand at flirting, buy you drinks and some would even go as far to put their hands on your waist when you were dancing, which you immediately pushed away and told them to piss off.</p><p>At first, it was okay, it made you feel good that you were desired. It was nice to get some recognition for putting a lot of effort into your hair, makeup and outfit. Though you knew you looked good and didn&rsquo;t need a guy to tell you, reassurance is nice.\u00a0</p><p>It was sometimes amusing to watch guys try and impress you, or try to win you over with some cheesy pickup line, it just gave you and your friends something to laugh at. You applauded their bravery.\u00a0</p><p>It was a Saturday night, the club was busy and the place to be. Georgia managed to get into a high profile club, for the people with some kind of social status. Definitely somewhere you didn&rsquo;t belong. You thought the guys at this club would be more polite and but that was far from the truth. Since they had a little money or fame to their name, it suddenly allowed them to think they were doing you a favor by gracing you with their unwanted presence.</p><p>When your favorite song came on, you started dancing and having fun, maybe the night wasn&rsquo;t so bad after all? Getting lost in the beat, you are Georgia are screaming the lyrics to each other. She then tells you she\u2019s going to get another drink, so you just dance by yourself. Swaying your body to the music without a care in the world. Then you felt a hot breath against your neck, and hands reaching around you. A complete stranger held you tight in his grip, you tried to get out.\u00a0</p><p>He starts touching you, you try even harder to get away. But he is strong. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get out of here sexy&rdquo; he slurred into your ear, obviously drunk. The smell of tequila and cigarettes lingers on his breath. He starts dragging you away. No one around you seemed to notice, you struggle <g class=\"gr_ gr_293 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"293\" data-gr-id=\"293\">even</g> more, hitting him, yelling for help. A security guard notices you struggling. He pulls the guy away from you and drags him to the exit.\u00a0</p><p>Flustered and shaken up you just want to get out of here. You think to go outside, but realize the guy would be out there. You turn to find the bathroom. The line is long so you give up and go to the bar to try to find Georgia. She is nowhere to be seen. You grab out your phone to call her to find it\u2019s dead.</p><p>You sit down at one of the stools and start breathing deep, you were now realizing how much what just happened was affecting you. You can still feel his breath, his grip strong enough to leave bruises on your arms. If that security guard didn&rsquo;t see you, lord only knows what could have happened.</p><p>You felt tears starting to flood out of your eyes and you didn&rsquo;t know why. You had never experienced something so intense. Your breathing quickens and you start to feel very overwhelmed, tears are now streaming down your face, along with your eye makeup.</p><p>Your head falls into your hands, you shut your eyes tightly, trying to block out your surroundings. You sit for what seems like forever, trying to compose yourself, getting ready to go back onto the dance floor to find Georgia so you could leave. Then you felt a hand on your back, you immediately flinch and pull away from the sudden touch, you turn around to yell at them.</p><p>&ldquo;If one more guy lays a fucking hand on me, I swear to god! Get away from me!&rdquo; You don&rsquo;t even look at the guy who violated your personal space, you just return to putting your head in your hands.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry, I didn&rsquo;t mean to startle you,&rdquo; he says, sitting down on the stool next to you. &ldquo;I was just going to ask if you were okay&rdquo; You look up at him. He&rsquo;s very handsome, clean-cut hair, that still managed to look effortlessly messy, his eyes are staring concernedly into yours. He can see that you have been crying. &ldquo;You obviously aren&rsquo;t okay&rdquo;</p><p>He flags down the bartender and asks for a water. &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; he asks you with genuine concern.</p><p>&ldquo;Some guy was all up on me, he started touching me, then tried to drag me out, if it wasn&rsquo;t for the guard I don&rsquo;t know what would have happened.\u201d You&rsquo;re still crying, you wipe away your tears with the napkin that he passes you.</p><p>\u201cNow I can&rsquo;t find my friend, and my phone is dead. Then I yelled at you, and you were just trying to be nice to me&rdquo; you say, and tears are still falling out of your eyes, he passes you the water that was placed in front of him and you take a huge sip.</p><p>&ldquo;I have a phone charger in my car. It&rsquo;s just out the back\u201d he questions. You just nod, you can\u2019t face going back into the crowd to <g class=\"gr_ gr_247 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"247\" data-gr-id=\"247\">try</g> find Georgia.</p><p>He helps you off the stool and guides you out the back exit, he puts his arm around you in a protective manner, you still flinch a bit as he brushed the now formed bruises, but he was gentle. You were thankful he was protecting you, it felt comfortable and safe. When you get to the back door, the bouncer just nods at him and opens the door. As you walk into the parking lot he clicks his keys and a black range rover lights up in response.\u00a0</p><p>&quot;Nice <g class=\"gr_ gr_287 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"287\" data-gr-id=\"287\">car</g>&rdquo; you say with a bit more life in your voice. Your crying has stopped now. He opens the door and starts fishing around in the console for his charger. You stand behind him, as he pulls it out he turns to you and he notices you are shivering. As he passed you the charger, he opens the back door and grabs a sweater from the seat and hands it to you.</p><p>&ldquo;Here, it&rsquo;s freezing&rdquo; You take it and as you pull it over your head you catch a glimpse of the label, Gucci. Wow, this guys must be rich. But he&rsquo;s so kind, <g class=\"gr_ gr_268 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"268\" data-gr-id=\"268\">usually</g> rich guys at clubs think they are better than everyone else, and just want to get int your pants. He was definitely quite the opposite.</p><p>&ldquo;<g class=\"gr_ gr_275 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"275\" data-gr-id=\"275\">Thanks</g>&rdquo; you say rubbing at your arms to warm up. You can feel the bruised spots on your arms, <g class=\"gr_ gr_273 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"273\" data-gr-id=\"273\">hopefully</g> they won&rsquo;t be too noticeable. He puts his hands in the back pockets of his jeans and leans against the car. \u201cUm, I think you need to turn the car on in order for it to <g class=\"gr_ gr_276 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"276\" data-gr-id=\"276\">work</g>&ldquo; you say laughing slightly while shaking your phone in your hand.</p><p>&quot;Oh right, <g class=\"gr_ gr_296 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"296\" data-gr-id=\"296\">duh</g>&rdquo; he says patting down his pockets to find his keys. He seems flustered, definitely not what you expected from him. He finds the keys and shoves them in the ignition. When he turns it on, your phone lights up. &ldquo;Do you want to sit and wait in the car while it charges?&rdquo; You nod and walk around to the passenger&rsquo;s side and hop in. He gets in the driver&rsquo;s seat. His car smells really good. &ldquo;Do you need more water?&rdquo; he asks you turning in his seat.</p><p>\u201cNo that&rsquo;s <g class=\"gr_ gr_239 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation multiReplace\" id=\"239\" data-gr-id=\"239\">okay.</g>&ldquo; you say while placing your phone down in the drink holder. \u201cI&rsquo;m sorry for yelling at you before&rdquo; you pause to say his name, which you then <g class=\"gr_ gr_240 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling multiReplace\" id=\"240\" data-gr-id=\"240\">realise</g> you don&rsquo;t even know.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;<g class=\"gr_ gr_246 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"246\" data-gr-id=\"246\">Harry</g>&rdquo; he says as he can tell you were wondering what his name was. \u201cAnd that&rsquo;s fine, I probably would have yelled at me too, if I just had a guy try and touch me and drag me out of a club.&ldquo;, he pauses.</p><p>&quot;Y/N, it\u2019s Y/<g class=\"gr_ gr_243 gr-alert gr_tiny gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"243\" data-gr-id=\"243\">N</g>&rdquo; you say. He nods and says your name quietly back to himself.</p><p>&ldquo;Seriously thank you, Harry, I don&rsquo;t think a guy has ever been this nice to me&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well you obviously haven&rsquo;t been around many decent guys then,&rdquo; he says laughing. There\u2019s a momentary silence, where you can hear sirens from the busy London streets.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you hungry?&rdquo; he asks.

You wish he was staying though. You bring your hands up to your face to cover your giggling as he toots his horn obnoxiously, the oversized-ness of the jumper has the sleeves covering your hands, the soft material brushes against your face, you stop to inhale the fabric, it smells like his car, like him, warm and comforting. You were definitely going to call him.</p>",

After being busy with studying hard and balancing your <g class=\"gr_ gr_221 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"221\" data-gr-id=\"221\">part time</g> job, your friend Georgia finally convinced you to come out to the club. It was fun getting dressed <g class=\"gr_ gr_294 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"294\" data-gr-id=\"294\">up,</g> and spending time with Georgia who you met through school.</p><p>Clubs weren\u2019t really your thing. <g class=\"gr_ gr_250 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"250\" data-gr-id=\"250\">Usually</g> you either end up getting really drunk and make bad decisions, or <g class=\"gr_ gr_251 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling multiReplace\" id=\"251\" data-gr-id=\"251\">your</g> to sober to put up with the constant attention from guys. They would try their hand at flirting, buy you drinks and some would even go as far to put their hands on your waist when you were dancing, which you immediately pushed away and told them to piss off.</p><p>At first, it was okay, it made you feel good that you were desired. It was nice to get some recognition for putting a lot of effort into your hair, makeup and outfit. Though you knew you looked good and didn\u2019t need a guy to tell you, reassurance is nice.\u00a0</p><p>It was sometimes amusing to watch guys try and impress you, or try to win you over with some cheesy pickup line, it just gave you and your friends something to laugh at. You applauded their bravery.\u00a0</p><p>It was a Saturday night, the club was busy and the place to be. Georgia managed to get into a high profile club, for the people with some kind of social status. Definitely somewhere you didn\u2019t belong. You thought the guys at this club would be more polite and but that was far from the truth. Since they had a little money or fame to their name, it suddenly allowed them to think they were doing you a favor by gracing you with their unwanted presence.</p><p>When your favorite song came on, you started dancing and having fun, maybe the night wasn\u2019t so bad after all? Getting lost in the beat, you are Georgia are screaming the lyrics to each other. She then tells you she\u2019s going to get another drink, so you just dance by yourself. Swaying your body to the music without a care in the world. Then you felt a hot breath against your neck, and hands reaching around you. A complete stranger held you tight in his grip, you tried to get out.\u00a0</p><p>He starts touching you, you try even harder to get away. But he is strong. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here sexy\u201d he slurred into your ear, obviously drunk. The smell of tequila and cigarettes lingers on his breath. He starts dragging you away. No one around you seemed to notice, you struggle <g class=\"gr_ gr_293 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"293\" data-gr-id=\"293\">even</g> more, hitting him, yelling for help. A security guard notices you struggling. He pulls the guy away from you and drags him to the exit.\u00a0</p><p>Flustered and shaken up you just want to get out of here. You think to go outside, but realize the guy would be out there. You turn to find the bathroom. The line is long so you give up and go to the bar to try to find Georgia. She is nowhere to be seen. You grab out your phone to call her to find it\u2019s dead.</p><p>You sit down at one of the stools and start breathing deep, you were now realizing how much what just happened was affecting you. You can still feel his breath, his grip strong enough to leave bruises on your arms. If that security guard didn\u2019t see you, lord only knows what could have happened.</p><p>You felt tears starting to flood out of your eyes and you didn\u2019t know why. You had never experienced something so intense. Your breathing quickens and you start to feel very overwhelmed, tears are now streaming down your face, along with your eye makeup.</p><p>Your head falls into your hands, you shut your eyes tightly, trying to block out your surroundings. You sit for what seems like forever, trying to compose yourself, getting ready to go back onto the dance floor to find Georgia so you could leave. Then you felt a hand on your back, you immediately flinch and pull away from the sudden touch, you turn around to yell at them.</p><p>\u201cIf one more guy lays a fucking hand on me, I swear to god! Get away from me!\u201d You don\u2019t even look at the guy who violated your personal space, you just return to putting your head in your hands.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to startle you,\u201d he says, sitting down on the stool next to you. \u201cI was just going to ask if you were okay\u201d You look up at him. He\u2019s very handsome, clean-cut hair, that still managed to look effortlessly messy, his eyes are staring concernedly into yours. He can see that you have been crying. \u201cYou obviously aren\u2019t okay\u201d</p><p>He flags down the bartender and asks for a water. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asks you with genuine concern.</p><p>\u201cSome guy was all up on me, he started touching me, then tried to drag me out, if it wasn\u2019t for the guard I don\u2019t know what would have happened.\u201d You\u2019re still crying, you wipe away your tears with the napkin that he passes you.</p><p>\u201cNow I can\u2019t find my friend, and my phone is dead. Then I yelled at you, and you were just trying to be nice to me\u201d you say, and tears are still falling out of your eyes, he passes you the water that was placed in front of him and you take a huge sip.</p><p>\u201cI have a phone charger in my car. It\u2019s just out the back\u201d he questions. You just nod, you can\u2019t face going back into the crowd to <g class=\"gr_ gr_247 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"247\" data-gr-id=\"247\">try</g> find Georgia.</p><p>He helps you off the stool and guides you out the back exit, he puts his arm around you in a protective manner, you still flinch a bit as he brushed the now formed bruises, but he was gentle. You were thankful he was protecting you, it felt comfortable and safe. When you get to the back door, the bouncer just nods at him and opens the door. As you walk into the parking lot he clicks his keys and a black range rover lights up in response.\u00a0</p><p>\"Nice <g class=\"gr_ gr_287 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"287\" data-gr-id=\"287\">car</g>\u201d you say with a bit more life in your voice. Your crying has stopped now. He opens the door and starts fishing around in the console for his charger. You stand behind him, as he pulls it out he turns to you and he notices you are shivering. As he passed you the charger, he opens the back door and grabs a sweater from the seat and hands it to you.</p><p>\u201cHere, it\u2019s freezing\u201d You take it and as you pull it over your head you catch a glimpse of the label, Gucci. Wow, this guys must be rich. But he\u2019s so kind, <g class=\"gr_ gr_268 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"268\" data-gr-id=\"268\">usually</g> rich guys at clubs think they are better than everyone else, and just want to get int your pants. He was definitely quite the opposite.</p><p>\u201c<g class=\"gr_ gr_275 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"275\" data-gr-id=\"275\">Thanks</g>\u201d you say rubbing at your arms to warm up.

He puts his hands in the back pockets of his jeans and leans against the car. \u201cUm, I think you need to turn the car on in order for it to <g class=\"gr_ gr_276 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"276\" data-gr-id=\"276\">work</g>\u201c you say laughing slightly while shaking your phone in your hand.</p><p>\"Oh right, <g class=\"gr_ gr_296 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"296\" data-gr-id=\"296\">duh</g>\u201d he says patting down his pockets to find his keys. He seems flustered, definitely not what you expected from him. He finds the keys and shoves them in the ignition. When he turns it on, your phone lights up. \u201cDo you want to sit and wait in the car while it charges?\u201d You nod and walk around to the passenger\u2019s side and hop in. He gets in the driver\u2019s seat. His car smells really good. \u201cDo you need more water?\u201d he asks you turning in his seat.</p><p>\u201cNo that\u2019s <g class=\"gr_ gr_239 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation multiReplace\" id=\"239\" data-gr-id=\"239\">okay.</g>\u201c you say while placing your phone down in the drink holder. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for yelling at you before\u201d you pause to say his name, which you then <g class=\"gr_ gr_240 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling multiReplace\" id=\"240\" data-gr-id=\"240\">realise</g> you don\u2019t even know.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<g class=\"gr_ gr_246 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"246\" data-gr-id=\"246\">Harry</g>\u201d he says as he can tell you were wondering what his name was. \u201cAnd that\u2019s fine, I probably would have yelled at me too, if I just had a guy try and touch me and drag me out of a club.\u201c, he pauses.</p><p>\"Y/N, it\u2019s Y/<g class=\"gr_ gr_243 gr-alert gr_tiny gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"243\" data-gr-id=\"243\">N</g>\u201d you say.

There\u2019s a momentary silence, where you can hear sirens from the busy London streets.</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d he asks. Can this guy get any nicer?\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI am actually, I ate like 6 hours ago.\u201d He puts his belt on and starts the engine. You put your belt on too.

You were definitely going to call him.</p></p>",

After being busy with studying hard and balancing your <g class=\"gr_ gr_221 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"221\" data-gr-id=\"221\">part time</g> job, your friend Georgia finally convinced you to come out to the club. It was fun getting dressed <g class=\"gr_ gr_294 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"294\" data-gr-id=\"294\">up,</g> and spending time with Georgia who you met through school.</p><p>Clubs weren\u2019t really your thing. <g class=\"gr_ gr_250 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"250\" data-gr-id=\"250\">Usually</g> you either end up getting really drunk and make bad decisions, or <g class=\"gr_ gr_251 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling multiReplace\" id=\"251\" data-gr-id=\"251\">your</g> to sober to put up with the constant attention from guys. They would try their hand at flirting, buy you drinks and some would even go as far to put their hands on your waist when you were dancing, which you immediately pushed away and told them to piss off.</p><p>At first, it was okay, it made you feel good that you were desired. It was nice to get some recognition for putting a lot of effort into your hair, makeup and outfit. Though you knew you looked good and didn\u2019t need a guy to tell you, reassurance is nice.\u00a0</p><p>It was sometimes amusing to watch guys try and impress you, or try to win you over with some cheesy pickup line, it just gave you and your friends something to laugh at. You applauded their bravery.\u00a0</p><p>It was a Saturday night, the club was busy and the place to be. Georgia managed to get into a high profile club, for the people with some kind of social status. Definitely somewhere you didn\u2019t belong. You thought the guys at this club would be more polite and but that was far from the truth. Since they had a little money or fame to their name, it suddenly allowed them to think they were doing you a favor by gracing you with their unwanted presence.</p><p>When your favorite song came on, you started dancing and having fun, maybe the night wasn\u2019t so bad after all? Getting lost in the beat, you are Georgia are screaming the lyrics to each other. She then tells you she\u2019s going to get another drink, so you just dance by yourself. Swaying your body to the music without a care in the world. Then you felt a hot breath against your neck, and hands reaching around you. A complete stranger held you tight in his grip, you tried to get out.\u00a0</p><p>He starts touching you, you try even harder to get away. But he is strong. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here sexy\u201d he slurred into your ear, obviously drunk. The smell of tequila and cigarettes lingers on his breath. He starts dragging you away. No one around you seemed to notice, you struggle <g class=\"gr_ gr_293 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"293\" data-gr-id=\"293\">even</g> more, hitting him, yelling for help. A security guard notices you struggling. He pulls the guy away from you and drags him to the exit.\u00a0</p><p>Flustered and shaken up you just want to get out of here. You think to go outside, but realize the guy would be out there. You turn to find the bathroom. The line is long so you give up and go to the bar to try to find Georgia. She is nowhere to be seen. You grab out your phone to call her to find it\u2019s dead.</p><p>You sit down at one of the stools and start breathing deep, you were now realizing how much what just happened was affecting you. You can still feel his breath, his grip strong enough to leave bruises on your arms. If that security guard didn\u2019t see you, lord only knows what could have happened.</p><p>You felt tears starting to flood out of your eyes and you didn\u2019t know why. You had never experienced something so intense. Your breathing quickens and you start to feel very overwhelmed, tears are now streaming down your face, along with your eye makeup.</p><p>Your head falls into your hands, you shut your eyes tightly, trying to block out your surroundings. You sit for what seems like forever, trying to compose yourself, getting ready to go back onto the dance floor to find Georgia so you could leave. Then you felt a hand on your back, you immediately flinch and pull away from the sudden touch, you turn around to yell at them.</p><p>\u201cIf one more guy lays a fucking hand on me, I swear to god! Get away from me!\u201d You don\u2019t even look at the guy who violated your personal space, you just return to putting your head in your hands.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to startle you,\u201d he says, sitting down on the stool next to you. \u201cI was just going to ask if you were okay\u201d You look up at him. He\u2019s very handsome, clean-cut hair, that still managed to look effortlessly messy, his eyes are staring concernedly into yours. He can see that you have been crying. \u201cYou obviously aren\u2019t okay\u201d</p><p>He flags down the bartender and asks for a water. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asks you with genuine concern.</p><p>\u201cSome guy was all up on me, he started touching me, then tried to drag me out, if it wasn\u2019t for the guard I don\u2019t know what would have happened.\u201d You\u2019re still crying, you wipe away your tears with the napkin that he passes you.</p><p>\u201cNow I can\u2019t find my friend, and my phone is dead. Then I yelled at you, and you were just trying to be nice to me\u201d you say, and tears are still falling out of your eyes, he passes you the water that was placed in front of him and you take a huge sip.</p><p>\u201cI have a phone charger in my car. It\u2019s just out the back\u201d he questions. You just nod, you can\u2019t face going back into the crowd to <g class=\"gr_ gr_247 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"247\" data-gr-id=\"247\">try</g> find Georgia.</p><p>He helps you off the stool and guides you out the back exit, he puts his arm around you in a protective manner, you still flinch a bit as he brushed the now formed bruises, but he was gentle. You were thankful he was protecting you, it felt comfortable and safe. When you get to the back door, the bouncer just nods at him and opens the door. As you walk into the parking lot he clicks his keys and a black range rover lights up in response.\u00a0</p><p>\"Nice <g class=\"gr_ gr_287 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"287\" data-gr-id=\"287\">car</g>\u201d you say with a bit more life in your voice. Your crying has stopped now. He opens the door and starts fishing around in the console for his charger. You stand behind him, as he pulls it out he turns to you and he notices you are shivering. As he passed you the charger, he opens the back door and grabs a sweater from the seat and hands it to you.</p><p>\u201cHere, it\u2019s freezing\u201d You take it and as you pull it over your head you catch a glimpse of the label, Gucci. Wow, this guys must be rich. But he\u2019s so kind, <g class=\"gr_ gr_268 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"268\" data-gr-id=\"268\">usually</g> rich guys at clubs think they are better than everyone else, and just want to get int your pants. He was definitely quite the opposite.</p><p>\u201c<g class=\"gr_ gr_275 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"275\" data-gr-id=\"275\">Thanks</g>\u201d you say rubbing at your arms to warm up. You can feel the bruised spots on your arms, <g class=\"gr_ gr_273 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"273\" data-gr-id=\"273\">hopefully</g> they won\u2019t be too noticeable. He puts his hands in the back pockets of his jeans and leans against the car. \u201cUm, I think you need to turn the car on in order for it to <g class=\"gr_ gr_276 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"276\" data-gr-id=\"276\">work</g>\u201c you say laughing slightly while shaking your phone in your hand.</p><p>\"Oh right, <g class=\"gr_ gr_296 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"296\" data-gr-id=\"296\">duh</g>\u201d he says patting down his pockets to find his keys. He seems flustered, definitely not what you expected from him. He finds the keys and shoves them in the ignition. When he turns it on, your phone lights up. \u201cDo you want to sit and wait in the car while it charges?\u201d You nod and walk around to the passenger\u2019s side and hop in. He gets in the driver\u2019s seat. His car smells really good. \u201cDo you need more water?\u201d he asks you turning in his seat.</p><p>\u201cNo that\u2019s <g class=\"gr_ gr_239 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation multiReplace\" id=\"239\" data-gr-id=\"239\">okay.</g>\u201c you say while placing your phone down in the drink holder. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for yelling at you before\u201d you pause to say his name, which you then <g class=\"gr_ gr_240 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling multiReplace\" id=\"240\" data-gr-id=\"240\">realise</g> you don\u2019t even know.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<g class=\"gr_ gr_246 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"246\" data-gr-id=\"246\">Harry</g>\u201d he says as he can tell you were wondering what his name was. \u201cAnd that\u2019s fine, I probably would have yelled at me too, if I just had a guy try and touch me and drag me out of a club.\u201c, he pauses.</p><p>\"Y/N, it\u2019s Y/<g class=\"gr_ gr_243 gr-alert gr_tiny gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"243\" data-gr-id=\"243\">N</g>\u201d you say. He nods and says your name quietly back to himself.</p><p>\u201cSeriously thank you, Harry, I don\u2019t think a guy has ever been this nice to me\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell you obviously haven\u2019t been around many decent guys then,\u201d he says laughing. There\u2019s a momentary silence, where you can hear sirens from the busy London streets.</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d he asks. Can this guy get any nicer?\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI am actually, I ate like 6 hours ago.\u201d He puts his belt on and starts the engine. You put your belt on too. After a short <g class=\"gr_ gr_265 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"265\" data-gr-id=\"265\">ride</g> he pulls up at an Mc Donalds drive-through, \"You read my mind\u201d you say to him.</p><p>He winds down his window \u201cCould I have a chicken wrap and a water, and\u2026\u201d he says turning to you</p><p>\u201cUh, nuggets and a shake <g class=\"gr_ gr_235 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"235\" data-gr-id=\"235\">please</g>\u201d you say loud enough for the worker to hear.</p><p>\u201cDid you get that?\u201c he says to the machine.</p><p>\"Drive to the next window please\u201d as he drives up to the next window, you pull out your wallet from your bag, he looks over and sees \u201cOh Y/N, its fine\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo you have done enough already, let me <g class=\"gr_ gr_225 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"225\" data-gr-id=\"225\">pay</g>\u201d you say insistently.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I got <g class=\"gr_ gr_238 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"238\" data-gr-id=\"238\">it</g>\u201d he says handing his card to the worker. When the worker looks at him she stops and puts her hands up to her mouth in shock.</p><p>\u201cOh my god, you\u2019re Harry Styles, I\u2019m a massive <g class=\"gr_ gr_257 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"257\" data-gr-id=\"257\">fan</g>\u201d shes says freaking out. \u201cNice to meet <g class=\"gr_ gr_258 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"258\" data-gr-id=\"258\">you</g>\u201d he says laughing a bit. She hands him his receipt and waves.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d you say confusedly. \u201cDid she just say she is a \u2018massive fan\u2019? Are you famous or something?\u201d you say half-jokingly but why else would she say that.</p><p>\u201cSomething like <g class=\"gr_ gr_233 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"233\" data-gr-id=\"233\">that</g>\u201d he says awkwardly. He grabs the bag of food from the next window and pulls into a parking spot.</p><p>\u201cNo like really, she was freaking <g class=\"gr_ gr_230 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"230\" data-gr-id=\"230\">out</g>\u201d you say again.

You change the subject</p><p>\u201cWant a nugget?\u201d you say shoving the box in his face, he picks one up laughing a bit.</p><p>\u201c<g class=\"gr_ gr_256 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"256\" data-gr-id=\"256\">Thanks</g>\u201d he says, for the nugget and for changing the subject. You sip on your shake and eat your food while having a great conversation with Harry. He is really genuine and different from any guy you have met before.</p><p>As he shoves his rubbish into the bag, he starts the car \u201cWant me to take you home?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cThat would be perfect\u201d You get your now fully charged phone and text Georgia that you\u2019re going home. She almost replies immediately, you laugh out loud. \u201cSome <g class=\"gr_ gr_249 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"249\" data-gr-id=\"249\">friend</g>\u201c you say.</p><p>\"Everything alright?\u201d he questions.</p><p>\u201cI just texted my friend to tell her I was going home, and she said she left had already left with a <g class=\"gr_ gr_223 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation multiReplace\" id=\"223\" data-gr-id=\"223\">guy.</g>\u201d you say locking your phone.</p><p>\u201cYou need to get some better people in your <g class=\"gr_ gr_236 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"236\" data-gr-id=\"236\">life</g>\u201d he says jokingly, but you know he was serious.

After being busy with studying hard and balancing your part time job, your friend Georgia finally convinced you to come out to the club. It was fun getting dressed up, and spending time with Georgia who you met through school.</p><p>Clubs weren&rsquo;t really your thing. Usually you either end up getting really drunk and make bad decisions, or your to sober to put up with the constant attention from guys. They would try their hand at flirting, buy you drinks and some would even go as far to put their hands on your waist when you were dancing, which you immediately pushed away and told them to piss off.</p><p>At first, it was okay, it made you feel good that you were desired. It was nice to get some recognition for putting a lot of effort into your hair, makeup and outfit. Though you knew you looked good and didn&rsquo;t need a guy to tell you, reassurance is nice.&nbsp;</p><p>It was sometimes amusing to watch guys try and impress you, or try to win you over with some cheesy pickup line, it just gave you and your friends something to laugh at. You applauded their bravery.&nbsp;</p><p>It was a Saturday night, the club was busy and the place to be. Georgia managed to get into a high profile club, for the people with some kind of social status. Definitely somewhere you didn&rsquo;t belong. You thought the guys at this club would be more polite and but that was far from the truth. Since they had a little money or fame to their name, it suddenly allowed them to think they were doing you a favor by gracing you with their unwanted presence.</p><p>When your favorite song came on, you started dancing and having fun, maybe the night wasn&rsquo;t so bad after all? Getting lost in the beat, you are Georgia are screaming the lyrics to each other. She then tells you she&rsquo;s going to get another drink, so you just dance by yourself. Swaying your body to the music without a care in the world. Then you felt a hot breath against your neck, and hands reaching around you. A complete stranger held you tight in his grip, you tried to get out.&nbsp;</p><p>He starts touching you, you try even harder to get away. But he is strong. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get out of here sexy&rdquo; he slurred into your ear, obviously drunk. The smell of tequila and cigarettes lingers on his breath. He starts dragging you away. No one around you seemed to notice, you struggle even more, hitting him, yelling for help. A security guard notices you struggling. He pulls the guy away from you and drags him to the exit.&nbsp;</p><p>Flustered and shaken up you just want to get out of here. You think to go outside, but realize the guy would be out there. You turn to find the bathroom. The line is long so you give up and go to the bar to try to find Georgia. She is nowhere to be seen. You grab out your phone to call her to find it&rsquo;s dead.</p><p>You sit down at one of the stools and start breathing deep, you were now realizing how much what just happened was affecting you. You can still feel his breath, his grip strong enough to leave bruises on your arms. If that security guard didn&rsquo;t see you, lord only knows what could have happened.</p><p>You felt tears starting to flood out of your eyes and you didn&rsquo;t know why. You had never experienced something so intense. Your breathing quickens and you start to feel very overwhelmed, tears are now streaming down your face, along with your eye makeup.</p><p>Your head falls into your hands, you shut your eyes tightly, trying to block out your surroundings. You sit for what seems like forever, trying to compose yourself, getting ready to go back onto the dance floor to find Georgia so you could leave. Then you felt a hand on your back, you immediately flinch and pull away from the sudden touch, you turn around to yell at them.</p><p>&ldquo;If one more guy lays a fucking hand on me, I swear to god! Get away from me!&rdquo; You don&rsquo;t even look at the guy who violated your personal space, you just return to putting your head in your hands.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry, I didn&rsquo;t mean to startle you,&rdquo; he says, sitting down on the stool next to you. &ldquo;I was just going to ask if you were okay&rdquo; You look up at him. He&rsquo;s very handsome, clean-cut hair, that still managed to look effortlessly messy, his eyes are staring concernedly into yours. He can see that you have been crying. &ldquo;You obviously aren&rsquo;t okay&rdquo;</p><p>He flags down the bartender and asks for a water. &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; he asks you with genuine concern.</p><p>&ldquo;Some guy was all up on me, he started touching me, then tried to drag me out, if it wasn&rsquo;t for the guard I don&rsquo;t know what would have happened.&rdquo; You&rsquo;re still crying, you wipe away your tears with the napkin that he passes you.</p><p>&ldquo;Now I can&rsquo;t find my friend, and my phone is dead. Then I yelled at you, and you were just trying to be nice to me&rdquo; you say, and tears are still falling out of your eyes, he passes you the water that was placed in front of him and you take a huge sip.</p><p>&ldquo;I have a phone charger in my car. It&rsquo;s just out the back&rdquo; he questions. You just nod, you can&rsquo;t face going back into the crowd to try find Georgia.</p><p>He helps you off the stool and guides you out the back exit, he puts his arm around you in a protective manner, you still flinch a bit as he brushed the now formed bruises, but he was gentle. You were thankful he was protecting you, it felt comfortable and safe. When you get to the back door, the bouncer just nods at him and opens the door. As you walk into the parking lot he clicks his keys and a black range rover lights up in response.&nbsp;</p><p>\"Nice car&rdquo; you say with a bit more life in your voice. Your crying has stopped now. He opens the door and starts fishing around in the console for his charger. You stand behind him, as he pulls it out he turns to you and he notices you are shivering. As he passed you the charger, he opens the back door and grabs a sweater from the seat and hands it to you.</p><p>&ldquo;Here, it&rsquo;s freezing&rdquo; You take it and as you pull it over your head you catch a glimpse of the label, Gucci. Wow, this guys must be rich. But he&rsquo;s so kind, usually rich guys at clubs think they are better than everyone else, and just want to get int your pants. He was definitely quite the opposite.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks&rdquo; you say rubbing at your arms to warm up. You can feel the bruised spots on your arms, hopefully they won&rsquo;t be too noticeable. He puts his hands in the back pockets of his jeans and leans against the car. &ldquo;Um, I think you need to turn the car on in order for it to work&ldquo; you say laughing slightly while shaking your phone in your hand.</p><p>\"Oh right, duh&rdquo; he says patting down his pockets to find his keys. He seems flustered, definitely not what you expected from him. He finds the keys and shoves them in the ignition. When he turns it on, your phone lights up. &ldquo;Do you want to sit and wait in the car while it charges?&rdquo; You nod and walk around to the passenger&rsquo;s side and hop in. He gets in the driver&rsquo;s seat. His car smells really good. &ldquo;Do you need more water?&rdquo; he asks you turning in his seat.</p><p>&ldquo;No that&rsquo;s okay.&ldquo; you say while placing your phone down in the drink holder. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for yelling at you before&rdquo; you pause to say his name, which you then realise you don&rsquo;t even know.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Harry&rdquo; he says as he can tell you were wondering what his name was. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s fine, I probably would have yelled at me too, if I just had a guy try and touch me and drag me out of a club.&ldquo;, he pauses.</p><p>\"Y/N, it&rsquo;s Y/N&rdquo; you say. He nods and says your name quietly back to himself.</p><p>&ldquo;Seriously thank you, Harry, I don&rsquo;t think a guy has ever been this nice to me&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well you obviously haven&rsquo;t been around many decent guys then,&rdquo; he says laughing. There&rsquo;s a momentary silence, where you can hear sirens from the busy London streets.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you hungry?&rdquo; he asks. Can this guy get any nicer?&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I am actually, I ate like 6 hours ago.&rdquo; He puts his belt on and starts the engine. You put your belt on too. After a short ride he pulls up at an Mc Donalds drive-through, \"You read my mind&rdquo; you say to him.</p><p>He winds down his window &ldquo;Could I have a chicken wrap and a water, and&hellip;&rdquo; he says turning to you</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, nuggets and a shake please&rdquo; you say loud enough for the worker to hear.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you get that?&ldquo; he says to the machine.</p><p>\"Drive to the next window please&rdquo; as he drives up to the next window, you pull out your wallet from your bag, he looks over and sees &ldquo;Oh Y/N, its fine&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No you have done enough already, let me pay&rdquo; you say insistently.</p><p>&ldquo;No, no, I got it&rdquo; he says handing his card to the worker. When the worker looks at him she stops and puts her hands up to her mouth in shock.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god, you&rsquo;re Harry Styles, I&rsquo;m a massive fan&rdquo; shes says freaking out. &ldquo;Nice to meet you&rdquo; he says laughing a bit. She hands him his receipt and waves.</p><p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; you say confusedly. &ldquo;Did she just say she is a &lsquo;massive fan&rsquo;? Are you famous or something?&rdquo; you say half-jokingly but why else would she say that.</p><p>&ldquo;Something like that&rdquo; he says awkwardly. He grabs the bag of food from the next window and pulls into a parking spot.</p><p>&ldquo;No like really, she was freaking out&rdquo; you say again. He didn&rsquo;t seem famous, sure he had a nice car, and Gucci, but he didn&rsquo;t seem famous.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah that happens sometimes,&rdquo; he says, you can tell he&rsquo;s feeling a bit shy. You change the subject</p><p>&ldquo;Want a nugget?&rdquo; you say shoving the box in his face, he picks one up laughing a bit.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks&rdquo; he says, for the nugget and for changing the subject. You sip on your shake and eat your food while having a great conversation with Harry. He is really genuine and different from any guy you have met before.</p><p>As he shoves his rubbish into the bag, he starts the car &ldquo;Want me to take you home?&rdquo; he asks.</p><p>&ldquo;That would be perfect&rdquo; You get your now fully charged phone and text Georgia that you&rsquo;re going home. She almost replies immediately, you laugh out loud. &ldquo;Some friend&ldquo; you say.</p><p>\"Everything alright?&rdquo; he questions.</p><p>&ldquo;I just texted my friend to tell her I was going home, and she said she left had already left with a guy.&rdquo; you say locking your phone.</p><p>&ldquo;You need to get some better people in your life&rdquo; he says jokingly, but you know he was serious. You tell him your address, and he turns the radio on to pass the time.</p><p>A slow song with a piano intro starts playing, you go to turn it up, you notice he is smirking a bit. When the song comes to a slow piano ending, you sit in awe of what you just heard. &ldquo;Wow, I loved that, that was a great song&rdquo;</p><p>The radio host then says &ldquo;That was 'Sign of the times&rsquo; by the one and only Harry Styles&rdquo; Your mouth drops open.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s your song?&ldquo; you exclaim.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, glad you like it&rdquo; he says shyly.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, wow, that was amazing, your amazing!&rdquo; you slump back down into your seat to process that this incredibly nice guy, is also insanely talented. &ldquo;You are just too good to be true&rdquo; you say in realization.</p><p>&ldquo;So are you,&ldquo; he says. You look at him confusedly. \"Usually people treat me differently because of who I am, but firstly you didn&rsquo;t even know who I am, and when that girl recognized me, you still treated me the same&rdquo; he pulls up at your apartment black and stops the car, he gets out and opens your door.</p><p>You hop out and give him a hug. &ldquo;Thank you Harry, I don&rsquo;t know where I would be if you didn&rsquo;t come over to me&rdquo; you say looking up at him. &ldquo;You saved my night&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I had fun, here take my number, I think you should have some more people in your life who actually care about you&rdquo; he grabs a pen and paper from his car and writes it down. &ldquo;Call me&rdquo; he says passing it to you. You hug him again and he then gets back in the car.</p><p>He winds down the window to say goodbye, and just as he begins to drive away, you realize you&rsquo;re still wearing his jumper, &ldquo;Your jumper!&rdquo; you yell.</p><p>&ldquo;Keep it, it looks better on you anyway&rdquo; You laugh and wave as he drives away.
