        "body": "<p>Jungkook rolled out of bed, running his hands over his face. He walked over to his dresser to grab clothes before practice. He pulled on a pair of grey sweats before going to grab a tee shirt. </p><p>He pulled on his shoes before grabbing something quick from the kitchen. He took a bite of his food as he pulled the door closed behind him. </p><p>Walking into the practice room he didn&rsquo;t take notice in any of his hyungs as he sat down his water and started to stretch.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t until they got a break that he walked over to Jimin and Tae. He leaned on Tae&rsquo;s shoulder, still panting from the rough practice. Once he caught his breath, he glanced at the two, doing a double take at his tiny hyung. </p><p>&ldquo;Jiminie?&rdquo; Jungkook asked, separating from Tae. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s shirt is that?&rdquo;</p><p>Jimin looked down at his shirt, a white one that was a couple sizes too big for his small frame. </p><p>&ldquo;Um.. I don&rsquo;t know. I just found it and threw it on before practice.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Really, hyung? That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re going with?&rdquo; Jungkook gave him a look, causing Jimin to take a step back, eyes looking everywhere except the boy in front of him. </p><p>Just before Jungkook could do anything else, Hobi called for the three so they could continue practice.</p><p>***</p><p>Once they all were back in the dorm, Jimin hurried to the safety of his bedroom. It wasn&rsquo;t two minutes later that he heard the door open, he looked up from his spot on his bed to see the younger closing the door and stalking closer like Jimin was his prey. </p><p>Jimin tried to move further back on his bed before Jungkook grabbed him. He pulled the smaller closer to him as he climbed onto the bed. He hovered over Jimin, meeting his eyes, &ldquo;What have I told you about stealing my clothes, hyung?&rdquo; </p><p>Jimin felt heat spreading through his cheeks, he tried to look away, but the younger grabbed the side of his face, forcing his to maintain eye contact.
