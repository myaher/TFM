A figure in a flowing green cloak and a bright red hat quickly ran by, dodging hands and tails trying to wrap around him. The figure let out a happy chuckle as he climbed up a tree, digging his sharp claws into the rough bark. The leaves ruffled as he made his way up, and he stole a glance behind him. </p><p>His ears perked at voices, and listened as they disappeared down the footpath. The man\u2019s eyes narrowed in focus as he watched their bodies be lost in the horizon. He slowly and carefully climbed his way out of the tree, and let his feet softly touch the grass on ground. His hand wiped the beads of sweat off oh his forehead, and he crept back down the dirt road where he originally came. </p><p><br/></p><p>He dug into his pocket, and pulled out a small silver chain with a emerald pendent on it. Admirably he held it in front of his eyes, and examined it. Those men who had been chasing him seemed to think it was important and worth value, so it was one of the first things he stole back from them. Getting it back to its owner was very important, and hopefully whatever importance it had could be kept away from the wrong hands. </p><p><br/></p><p>He shoved the necklace back into his pocket, and glanced at the path forward. The sky fell dark, and stars were starting to paint the sky. Shadows cloaked his body, with only the lanterns of a nearby town illuminating his path. He glanced down toward the houses in front of him, and listened to the hushed voices around him. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s him?\u201d A small boy asked. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the Joxter!\u201d Started a few Snorks. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cDid he chase them off?\u201d Said the girl at the shop. </p><p><br/></p><p>The Joxter huffed and rolled his eyes at the comments, and hurried his way toward a small oak door near the middle of the village. He ignored the panicked voices and knocked. In front of him, the door quickly swung open and revealed a small lady, whose golden hair was neatly tied up in a ponytail and had glasses more than likely too big for her face. Her eyes widened once she saw the Joxter\u2019s face, and she took his paws into her own. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cOh my goodness Joxter my dear friend! I heard the commotion, did you really chase of the Hattin\u2019s?\u201d The girl asked, causing Joxter\u2019s lips to press together. The Hattin\u2019s had apparently been causing chaos in this village for quite some time, and continued even more once Joxter had arrived. New visitors weren\u2019t very welcome to them, and they were really strict on rules. They told Joxter that he had a measly two hours to collect what he needed and leave. </p><p><br/></p><p>Naturally, Joxter wasn\u2019t too fond of the idea, and was quick to nod his head to not cause too much of a scene. Getting what he needed was the main importance at the moment, and he couldn\u2019t afford to gain more attention on himself than he already had. That was until he saw the supposed Hattin\u2019s robbing the residents of the village raw, stealing what they could and dismissing them. So Joxter did what any wise Joxter would do, he shoved what he assumed to be their leader and started a riot. </p><p><br/></p><p>So now he was here, standing in front of the village\u2019s \u2018mayor\u2019 who just so happened to be an old acquaintance, with a bunch of prying eyes on him. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Joxaren started. \u201cThey more so chased me out. But I\u2019m sure they won\u2019t come back after I was done with them.\u201d He let out a low chuckle and glanced downwards. The girl in front of him smiled and gave him a slight bow, which earned gasps from the lingering audience around them. She softly coughed and cleared her throat, then opened her mouth. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cEveryone! From now on, we shan\u2019t live in fear, whether it be of the Hattin\u2019s gang, or of the misconceptions of the Joxter. Today, he is a hero, and you shall treat him as such.\u201d She beamed up at the Joxter, and looked back to crowd. \u201cLet is not listen to rumors or stories told by those we don\u2019t trust or know, and rather be grateful that a so called villain has saved someone yet again. For that I\u2019m forever thankful.\u201d </p><p><br/></p><p>The crowed let out a few hips and horras, and cheered the Joxter on. Joxeran stood there bashfully, and nervously shuffled on both feet. Many mumbles and voices amongst the crowd were saying how \u201cJoxter\u2019s weren\u2019t that bad\u201d and \u201cwe were wrong\u201d. Which the man silently laughed at, and would have rather that been the original assumption. The villages mayor patted the man on the back and turned back into the house.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cOh umm, my friend. I retrieved most of the stuff they took. Would you like it back?\u201d Joxter asked, and he started to hold out some of his pockets contents. The girl\u2019s eyes shimmered once more with gratefulness and thanks, as she grabbed a small bucket to dump the stolen belongings in. Joxter\u2019s hand, however, paused once he got to the necklace, and he examined it once more. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cYou can keep that one, as an award. You seem very fond of it.\u201d Joxter looked at the girl in front of him and smiled. \u201cI\u2019m thinking someone in your life would love it as a gift.\u201d The man did nothing but give a slight nod, and pocketed it once more. After he was done returning the stolen items, he gave the mayor once last tip of his hat and went off his way. His hand hovered over the pocket with the necklace and his thoughts drifted elsewhere. </p><p><br/></p><p>Maybe it was time he gifted an old love with a visit. </p><p><br/></p><p><!-- more --></p><p>\u2014\u2014</p><p><br/></p><p>When he knocked on the door, he wasn\u2019t expecting such an angered look once Mymble saw who was at her door. Her children swarmed around her legs, prying their way through her legs and the door to catch a glance at the door and who was angering their mamma so. Joxter swallowed his growing fear and took off his hat, and nervously grasping it in his paws. </p><p><br/></p><p>The Mymble stressfully ran her paw through her ashy red hair, and let out a heavy breath through her nose. She ushered both her children and the Joxter into the house and shut the door, slamming it a little causing Joxter to jump a little. He let out a nervous chuckle and sat down in a nearby chaise, stealing glances at the women before him. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cMymble dear,\u201d she started as she looked at her eldest daughter. \u201cBe a dear and take you siblings to the other room. I\u2019ve got some catching up to do with my love.\u201d The Mymble\u2019s Daughter quickly ushered the little ones out of the room, mumbling a quick \u2018yes Mymblemamma\u2019 before hastily shutting the door. </p><p><br/></p><p>Mymble looked at Joxter and gave him a soft smile. Joxter returned it, and started to speak. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cMymble my dear-\u201c</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think you think you can speak right now Joxeran.\u201d The women cut the man off, causing him to shrink a little in his chair. \u201cYou\u2019ll do one thing and one thing only before we start this casual conversation. Where have you been all these years?\u201d Mymble spat out, narrowing her eyes at the man in front of her. </p><p><br/></p><p>Joxter\u2019s face fell and and he wrapped his tail protectively around him. Mymble was a fierce women, and he\u2019d always known that, yet he didn\u2019t think his parting would impact her this much. Her breaths were sharp and it looks could kill, Joxter would surely be nothing but a memory now. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cNow Mymble love, you know why I couldn\u2019t stay.\u201d He said to kill the silence, yet that comment only made the Mymble more furious. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cAnd why is that huh? Because of the ghosts from your past, the people that would hunt you for your rarity and specialness?\u201d The women towered above him, her fists clinched and face stoic. \u201cDid you ever once think about what you left behind.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cOf course my dear!\u201d Joxter said defensively. \u201cAnd not a day went by where I didn\u2019t think of you. But there were things that needed done, rules that needed changed. Of course I thought about how I left you behind but I just can\u2019t stay in one place neither can you!\u201d </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about me!\u201d Mymblemamma whispered under her breath, as she sat down. She put her hands to her face and let out a low chuckle. Joxter uncurled from himself and looked at her curiously. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWe have a son Joxter.\u201d The women stated plainly, glancing back at the man in front of her. Joxter froze, and he felt his heart clench. Thoughts ran through his head and his shoulders tensed up. He couldn\u2019t do anything but laugh at the Mymble\u2019s words. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cSurely you\u2019re joking.\u201d </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cAnd why was I not made aware of this!?\u201d Joxter yelled as he furiously stood up, causing the chair to scoot back and nearly fell over. The Joxter paced around the room with his tail fuzzing up and his ears pressed flat up against his head. Mymble sat there calmly, letting the man let his anger out. Once he seemed to cool down a little, and he stopped stomping about, Mumble got up and took his paws into her own. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cAre you done with you tantrum dear?\u201d The women asked. Joxter glared at her with beady eyes, but have no answer. The two stood in silence for a bit, enjoying at least being together. For not seeing each other for so long, their eyes still showed the twinkle of love that they had when they first met. Nothing would chance that, and Joxter was glad. He would have, however, rather their reunion be much more welcoming than surprising. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cIs, is he here? Our son?\u201d Joxter quickly mumbled out. Mymble chewed on her bottom lip, and tore her eyes away from his. \u201cMymble where-?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d Mymblemamma quickly said. \u201cHe ran away some years ago, he couldn\u2019t take the captivity he said.\u201d </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cSo our son, a Mumrik of all things, is running around where anyone can find him? Mymble what were you thinking! He could get hurt or killed!\u201d Joxter exclaimed. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cHe can take care of himself I\u2019m sure.\u201d Mymble stated. Joxter stood there in absolute shock, and stared at his lover. A son, he\u2019s had a son this whole time and he hadn\u2019t know. He took Mymble into his embrace and gave her a great long hug. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cMy love, you\u2019ve always been a blessing, but I need to find my son.\u201d Joxaren said. Mumble nodded with glassy eyes, and Joxter planted a kiss on her head. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cAsk my Mymble dear. She\u2019s been to many more places recently, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019s at least would have heard if he were anywhere nearby.\u201d Joxter nodded and opened the door, letting a dozen children back into the room. Mymblemamma let out a loud sigh, and Joxter gave her a sympathetic smile. </p><p><br/></p><p>Beside the door frame, the Mymble\u2019s Daughter was waiting, having listened into her mothers and the Joxter\u2019s conversation. Mymlan gave the older man a smile, and Joxter returned it with a tip of his hat. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cLittle My has been spending an awful lot of time in Moominvalley.\u201d The young women stated. \u201cShe\u2019s sent me plenty of letters, telling me of her adventures and what not. She also has mentioned a certain vagabond as well.\u201d Her lips formed up into a small smile, and she gave Joxter one of the letters. Joxter skimmed over it a few times, cursing My\u2019s slightly cursive writing, until he came across a certain word. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cMoomin? She\u2019s been staying with Moomin?\u201d Joxaren asked. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cMoomintroll is his son, but yes. She\u2019s been staying with both Moominpappa and Mamma, I recall you being good friends with them right?\u201d Joxter beamed and his grin reached his golden eyes. </p><p><br/></p><p>Not only would he be reunited with his old friend, but he\u2019d get to meet his son as well. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWhat a time to be alive.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p><br/></p><p>The Mother Mymble stood there letting her heart flutter in both love and excitement. Her love had come home for the first time in awhile, and left so suddenly. Her children were running around her feet, causing chaos and havoc wherever they were, yet she stood there in everlasting longing. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cOh Mymble my love!\u201d Joxter\u2019s voice sounded from a nearby window, the sudden change in sound giving her a start. She walked over and gazed out towards Joxaren, who was hastily making his way back toward their home. </p><p><br/></p><p>Once he arrived back, he stuffed his hand into his pocket and pulled out a gorgeous necklace, and practically shoved it into the woman\u2019s hands. A small blush formed upon his cheeks and his eyes twinkled with wonder. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI got this for you, please take it.\u201d His voice whispered, as he planted a kiss into her hair. The Mymble weighed it in her hands and smiled at the gift, staring at her reflection in the emerald. Below her some of her kids were tugging and pulling at her dress, wanting to see the special gift. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Joxter started, causing the woman and children to look up at him. \u201cI outta get going now. It\u2019s a few days journey to Moominvalley.\u201d He tipped his hat and started to walk back down the path. </p><p><br/></p><p>Mymble carefully eyed the necklace, weighing it between both of her hands. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWait Joxter my love.\u201d She said, causing the man to freeze in his steps. \u201cI\u2019m coming with you.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cAre you sure? It\u2019s quite a long journey and you seem to be quite busy with-\u201c</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask, I said I would.\u201d Mymblemamma snapped and started to pack a small bag with things she thought necessary, then fumbled to latch the chain of the necklace. Joxter waited as patiently as he could, his tail flicking and his head tilted slightly. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cMymble dear, please do watch the kids.\u201d The woman said to her eldest. \u201cAnd send a letter Little My\u2019s way, tell her we\u2019re coming.\u201d </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cOf course mother. Please do take care, and come back soon. Safe travels, please take care of my mother Joxter, and say hello to Snufkin for me!\u201d She yelled out the window, where the Mother Mymble and Joxter were already standing. </p><p><br/></p><p>The two gave their waves goodbye, which the children returned, and started walking. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWhy the sudden interest Mymble Dearest?\u201d Joxter asked as he wrapped his paw around her own. Mymble hummed and pondered her answer, whilst rubbing her thumb on the back of the Joxter\u2019s palm. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to apologize to him.\u201d She started and looked away. \u201cI hardly doubt he\u2019ll forgive me, but he\u2019s got to know I love him with all my heart.\u201d She said. </p><p><br/></p><p>Joxter smiled and looked at the forest ahead of them. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p><br/></p><p>When Snufkin woke up, there was undoubtedly an obvious weight lifted off upon his shoulders. Not only had he gotten his first full night\u2019s of sleep for the longest time, but he no longer had any reason to hide himself from his best friend. He lifted his arms above his head and stretched, his tail wrapped curled behind him freely. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cSnufkin!!\u201d A voice shouted and opened the flap of his tent. The mumrik jumped up on all fours and his fur stood up straight. Moomintroll stood there looking at Snufkin with an amused expression, his paws shooting up to cover his chuckles. Now that he\u2019d been told about his friends cat like instincts, it was easier to see the small things he did. </p><p><br/></p><p>Snufkin\u2019s slit eyes widened in excitement when he saw the troll standing in his tents doorway, yet he still instinctively wrapped his tail around his body. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cMy Moomintroll! What brings you here so early in the morning?\u201d The boy asked as he started to get ready. Moomin watched closely as he covered each part of his mumrik apparence. Like clockwork gloves were donned, scarf wrapped around his slightly furry neck, and hat and hair positioned to cover his pointed ears. </p><p><br/></p><p>Throughout all these years he knew his best friend held his secrets, and he respected his privacy. Even though he\u2019d pry every now and then, there was nothing more he\u2019d value than his friends feelings. And now that he\u2019d known possibly Snufkin\u2019s biggest secret, he felt incredibly closer to him and even more valued in their friendship. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cIs there something wrong?\u201d Snufkin\u2019s voice rang through his thoughts. Moomin perked up and fiercely shook his head. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cOf course not! Mamma was just wondering if you\u2019d like to join us for lunch? It\u2019s okay if not, but I thought I\u2019d put the offer in the air just in case.\u201d Moomin timidly asked, and glanced at his friend. </p><p><br/></p><p>Snufkin gave a soft smile and walked towards Moomin, grabbing his paw and leading him out of the tent. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to join!\u201d Snufkin exclaimed, taking the troll by surprise. Moomin smiled back and they walked toward the house together, casually taking about small things like the flowers currently blooming in the valley and the birds flying high above them. </p><p><br/></p><p>The whole time Moomin just took note on how much happier Snufkin seemed, and how he seemed so less stressed. The whole thing made him much happier, and he could only think about how much better things would\u2019ve been had he known about Snufkin\u2019s true self much earlier. </p><p><br/></p><p>Moomin didn\u2019t see the appeal and why Snufkin had kept it. He\u2019d never heard of someone having ill feelings towards him, and there were others around that also had Mumrik-like appearances. But it wasn\u2019t just the appearances that Snufkin was worried about it seemed, but his family tree. Snufkin didn\u2019t know what his father had done that entailed the Mumble to hide Snufkin entirely. </p><p><br/></p><p>The boy had run off and left behind that life that seemed so sheltered. He risked the constant fear of being chased or found just to be who he wanted to be and never looked behind. Moomin\u2019s heart soared when he realized that he and everyone in Moominvalley is what made him feel safe, and whenever he glanced at Snufkin it made him happier knowing he no longer had to be constantly scared of those around him. </p><p><br/></p><p>Finally the front door of Moominhouse stood and Mamma was waiting for them. He clasped her hands together and gave the two a bright smile. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cOh Snufkin dear! It\u2019s absolutely wonderful to see you sweetie.\u201d Moominmamma said as she ushered them both into the house. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cYou as well Mamma! Thank you for inviting me for lunch.\u201d Snufkin said with gratitude. </p><p><br/></p><p>In front of them Little My and Moominpappa were already sitting at the table, Pappa sipping his coffee and My blowing bubbles in her milk. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cGood morning everyone.\u201d Snufkin stated as him and Moomintroll took their seats. Little My looked at the two deviously and knowingly smirked. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cMoomin is keeping secrets from us Mamma.\u201d My said, innocently glancing towards the mother. Snufkin and Moomin both froze and let their bodies tense up. The mumrik glared at the small girl and mouthed the words \u2018don\u2019t you dare\u2019. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cAnd what is that Little My?\u201d Pappa asked as he set his coffee down. My didn\u2019t respond to him, but instead her eyes locked onto Snufkin\u2019s. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cMamma\u2019s coming to visit.\u201d The girl said, and looked up to Moominmamma. The woman \u2018hmmed\u2019 in response as she set the plates of food in front of everyone. \u201cShe sent a letter.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cIs she dear?\u201d The mother asked causally. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cShe wants to see Snufkin.\u201d </p><p><br/></p><p>Had it not been for Moomin, the mumrik would have surely jumped across the table and started a fight with his sister. He could however, feel his claws angrily poking through his gloves and piercing the table. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d Moominpappa asked, as he eyed the flustered looking Snufkin and the worried Moomintroll. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI swear Little My if you-\u201c </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWhat mother wouldn\u2019t want to see her favorite child?\u201d My said softly cutting Moomin off, as if it were the most natural words to come out of her mouth. The room went silent and all eyes locked onto the mumrik, who sat there dumbfounded. </p><p><br/></p><p>He could hardly believe that My would have the nerve to do such a thing, yet there she was sitting smugly in front of him. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cYou rotten sister!\u201d Snufkin hissed and nearly threw himself at the girl. Mamma luckily grabbed him by the shoulders and made him sit back down. Little My cackled and had a proud look on her face. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cRather them know your secrets now so they don\u2019t find out when they\u2019re both here don\u2019t you think?\u201d My stated plainly, slouching in her chair. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWait they? Who else is coming, all the children too?\u201d Snufkin asked, ignoring the confused looks of Mamma and Pappa. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not! I wouldn\u2019t still be here if she were. Gah, I left for a reason.\u201d Little My said.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cThen who else?\u201d Snufkin pondered. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cThe Joxter right?\u201d Moominpappa spoke. All the color drained from Snufkin\u2019s face and his mouth opened and closed with lack of works. Moomin lightly touched his shoulder causing him to flinch and pull away a little. \u201cHe\u2019s Snufkin\u2019s father correct?\u201d He spoke again, looking at Little My who nodded her head. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cPappa how did you know?\u201d Moomin questioned, not turning from his friend who looked second away from panicking. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always had my suspicions. You look an awful lot your father my boy. I didn\u2019t completely put it together until just now when Little My mentioned the Mymble.\u201d Pappa stated. \u201cYou\u2019re about the age of when they started to become latched at the hip those two.\u201d </p><p><br/></p><p>Snufkin sat in his chair tense as ever, hardly speaking a word. His gaze was downcast and his fists clenched the sides of the chair. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why should speak of him, he wasn\u2019t ever around.\u201d Snufkin mumbled a reply, causing Moominmamma to look at him sadly. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean he wasn\u2019t ever around?\u201d Mamma asked. At this point it seemed lunch was completely disregarded as Snufkin was pulled into another conversation he didn\u2019t want to partake in. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cHow do you know my father Pappa?\u201d Snufkin changed the subject, and glanced at the man. Moominpappa seemed to instantly perk up and moved his way into the other room, gabbing a stack of books off a nearby shelf. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWell my boy, your father and I go way back. Yes we sailed on the Oshun Oxtra together! We were good friends.\u201d Pappa stated. Snufkin gazed at him with longing eyes, any sight of anxiety forgotten. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWhat, What was he like?\u201d The mumrik asked quietly. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cTo be honest, quite lazy. However, you two are quite similar on the sense that you dislike authority and can\u2019t stay in one place for long.\u201d Moominpappa stated. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cInteresting.\u201d The boy said. \u201cMakes me wonder what he did that caused Mother to have to hide-\u201c Snufkin paused and looked at Moominpappa, who stared back with wide eyes. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cHide what Snufkin?\u201d The man pressed. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cMe I guess.\u201d </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201c\u2018Mumrik\u2019s must always hide their tails\u2019\u201d Little My mocked, and crossed her arms. \u201cMom always treated him like he was special, having him hide his tail and paws for whatever reason. Dumb in my opinion.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cOh my&hellip;You\u2019re a Mumrik?\u201d Moominpappa asks, almost not believing. Snufkin slowly nods his head, and unwinds his tail to show Moominmamma and Pappa. \u201cWow. Mumrik\u2019s are awfully rare, I guess that\u2019s why you\u2019ve been hiding your tail.\u201d Pappa trailed off. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cAnd his paws, and his feet, and his fangs and ears. Mother made sure of that.\u201d My said, sipping her milk. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWhy would Mymble have you hide your tail though? It\u2019s not that uncommon for the children of Mymble\u2019s to have similar features. Too-Ticky even has looks much like your own.\u201d Mamma ask. Snufkin shrugged and opened his mouth to reply, only to be cut off by Little My. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not because of that, it\u2019s because he looks so much like Joxter! Where we Mymble\u2019s are from, he\u2019s not looked fondly upon by the higher ups.\u201d She responded. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cMother would always say that the Joxter did things that some didn\u2019t like.\u201d Snufkin added on. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019m not surprised. Joxaren is pretty big on speaking his mind most of the time. My, how much longer until your mother and Joxter should be here?\u201d Moominpappa asked as he casually handed Snufkin some of his memoirs and drafts that spoke of Joxter. Snufkin took the books and eagerly flipped through them, Moomin reading over his shoulders. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d My started. \u201cMymble sent the letter about a week ago so I\u2019d assume any day now.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWhat!\u201d Snufkin slapped the boom shut, causing Moomintroll to jump. \u201cMymble sent a letter that long ago and I\u2019m just finding out about it?\u201d </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cYou seemed busy. It didn\u2019t seem important to me.\u201d Little My shrugged. The boy took in a deep inhale and released it through his nose, and put his head in his hands. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWhat am I going to do? What if he doesn\u2019t like me? And oh gosh I haven\u2019t seen Mother in years she\u2019s sure to yell at me. And what will the Joxter think once he finds out I\u2019ve been running from my problems rather than confronting them like a true Mumrik? Oh my gosh I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d Snufkin groaned and plopped back against a wall. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cSnufkin dear.\u201d Mamma\u2019s voice softly spoke. She pulled the boy into a large hug, which caused snicking to tense up. \u201cWhatever happens, we\u2019ll always be here for you.\u201d Snufkin stated still, trying to decide if he wanted to squirm his way out or just do nothing. Eventually, the boy melted into Moominmamma\u2019s touch and hugged her back. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cThank you Mamma.\u201d Snufkin whispered and purred slightly. Moominmamma nodded and released the boy, giving him a big grin. </p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be afraid here. Ever.\u201d</p>",

A figure in a flowing green cloak and a bright red hat quickly ran by, dodging hands and tails trying to wrap around him. The figure let out a happy chuckle as he climbed up a tree, digging his sharp claws into the rough bark. The leaves ruffled as he made his way up, and he stole a glance behind him. </p>\n<p>His ears perked at voices, and listened as they disappeared down the footpath. The man&rsquo;s eyes narrowed in focus as he watched their bodies be lost in the horizon. He slowly and carefully climbed his way out of the tree, and let his feet softly touch the grass on ground. His hand wiped the beads of sweat off oh his forehead, and he crept back down the dirt road where he originally came. </p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>He dug into his pocket, and pulled out a small silver chain with a emerald pendent on it. Admirably he held it in front of his eyes, and examined it. Those men who had been chasing him seemed to think it was important and worth value, so it was one of the first things he stole back from them. Getting it back to its owner was very important, and hopefully whatever importance it had could be kept away from the wrong hands. </p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>He shoved the necklace back into his pocket, and glanced at the path forward. The sky fell dark, and stars were starting to paint the sky. Shadows cloaked his body, with only the lanterns of a nearby town illuminating his path. He glanced down toward the houses in front of him, and listened to the hushed voices around him. </p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s him?&rdquo; A small boy asked. </p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Joxter!&rdquo; Started a few Snorks. </p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>&ldquo;Did he chase them off?&rdquo; Said the girl at the shop. </p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The Joxter huffed and rolled his eyes at the comments, and hurried his way toward a small oak door near the middle of the village. He ignored the panicked voices and knocked. In front of him, the door quickly swung open and revealed a small lady, whose golden hair was neatly tied up in a ponytail and had glasses more than likely too big for her face. Her eyes widened once she saw the Joxter&rsquo;s face, and she took his paws into her own. </p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>&ldquo;Oh my goodness Joxter my dear friend! I heard the commotion, did you really chase of the Hattin&rsquo;s?&rdquo; The girl asked, causing Joxter&rsquo;s lips to press together. The Hattin&rsquo;s had apparently been causing chaos in this village for quite some time, and continued even more once Joxter had arrived. New visitors weren&rsquo;t very welcome to them, and they were really strict on rules. They told Joxter that he had a measly two hours to collect what he needed and leave. </p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Naturally, Joxter wasn&rsquo;t too fond of the idea, and was quick to nod his head to not cause too much of a scene. Getting what he needed was the main importance at the moment, and he couldn&rsquo;t afford to gain more attention on himself than he already had. That was until he saw the supposed Hattin&rsquo;s robbing the residents of the village raw, stealing what they could and dismissing them. So Joxter did what any wise Joxter would do, he shoved what he assumed to be their leader and started a riot. </p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>So now he was here, standing in front of the village&rsquo;s &lsquo;mayor&rsquo; who just so happened to be an old acquaintance, with a bunch of prying eyes on him. </p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Joxaren started. &ldquo;They more so chased me out. But I&rsquo;m sure they won&rsquo;t come back after I was done with them.&rdquo; He let out a low chuckle and glanced downwards. The girl in front of him smiled and gave him a slight bow, which earned gasps from the lingering audience around them. She softly coughed and cleared her throat, then opened her mouth. </p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>&ldquo;Everyone! From now on, we shan&rsquo;t live in fear, whether it be of the Hattin&rsquo;s gang, or of the misconceptions of the Joxter. Today, he is a hero, and you shall treat him as such.&rdquo; She beamed up at the Joxter, and looked back to crowd. &ldquo;Let is not listen to rumors or stories told by those we don&rsquo;t trust or know, and rather be grateful that a so called villain has saved someone yet again. For that I&rsquo;m forever thankful.&rdquo; </p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The crowed let out a few hips and horras, and cheered the Joxter on. Joxeran stood there bashfully, and nervously shuffled on both feet. Many mumbles and voices amongst the crowd were saying how &ldquo;Joxter&rsquo;s weren&rsquo;t that bad&rdquo; and &ldquo;we were wrong&rdquo;. Which the man silently laughed at, and would have rather that been the original assumption. The villages mayor patted the man on the back and turned back into the house.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>&ldquo;Oh umm, my friend. I retrieved most of the stuff they took. Would you like it back?&rdquo; Joxter asked, and he started to hold out some of his pockets contents. The girl&rsquo;s eyes shimmered once more with gratefulness and thanks, as she grabbed a small bucket to dump the stolen belongings in. Joxter&rsquo;s hand, however, paused once he got to the necklace, and he examined it once more. </p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>&ldquo;You can keep that one, as an award. You seem very fond of it.&rdquo; Joxter looked at the girl in front of him and smiled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking someone in your life would love it as a gift.&rdquo; The man did nothing but give a slight nod, and pocketed it once more. After he was done returning the stolen items, he gave the mayor once last tip of his hat and went off his way. His hand hovered over the pocket with the necklace and his thoughts drifted elsewhere. </p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Maybe it was time he gifted an old love with a visit. </p>\n<p><br></p>\n",

Her children swarmed around her legs, prying their way through her legs and the door to catch a glance at the door and who was angering their mamma so. Joxter swallowed his growing fear and took off his hat, and nervously grasping it in his paws. </p><p><br></p><p>The Mymble stressfully ran her paw through her ashy red hair, and let out a heavy breath through her nose. She ushered both her children and the Joxter into the house and shut the door, slamming it a little causing Joxter to jump a little. He let out a nervous chuckle and sat down in a nearby chaise, stealing glances at the women before him. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cMymble dear,\u201d she started as she looked at her eldest daughter. \u201cBe a dear and take you siblings to the other room. I\u2019ve got some catching up to do with my love.\u201d The Mymble\u2019s Daughter quickly ushered the little ones out of the room, mumbling a quick \u2018yes Mymblemamma\u2019 before hastily shutting the door. </p><p><br></p><p>Mymble looked at Joxter and gave him a soft smile. Joxter returned it, and started to speak. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cMymble my dear-\u201c</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think you think you can speak right now Joxeran.\u201d The women cut the man off, causing him to shrink a little in his chair. \u201cYou\u2019ll do one thing and one thing only before we start this casual conversation. Where have you been all these years?\u201d Mymble spat out, narrowing her eyes at the man in front of her. </p><p><br></p><p>Joxter\u2019s face fell and and he wrapped his tail protectively around him. Mymble was a fierce women, and he\u2019d always known that, yet he didn\u2019t think his parting would impact her this much. Her breaths were sharp and it looks could kill, Joxter would surely be nothing but a memory now. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cNow Mymble love, you know why I couldn\u2019t stay.\u201d He said to kill the silence, yet that comment only made the Mymble more furious. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cAnd why is that huh? Because of the ghosts from your past, the people that would hunt you for your rarity and specialness?\u201d The women towered above him, her fists clinched and face stoic. \u201cDid you ever once think about what you left behind.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOf course my dear!\u201d Joxter said defensively. \u201cAnd not a day went by where I didn\u2019t think of you. But there were things that needed done, rules that needed changed. Of course I thought about how I left you behind but I just can\u2019t stay in one place neither can you!\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about me!\u201d Mymblemamma whispered under her breath, as she sat down. She put her hands to her face and let out a low chuckle. Joxter uncurled from himself and looked at her curiously. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWe have a son Joxter.\u201d The women stated plainly, glancing back at the man in front of her. Joxter froze, and he felt his heart clench. Thoughts ran through his head and his shoulders tensed up. He couldn\u2019t do anything but laugh at the Mymble\u2019s words. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cSurely you\u2019re joking.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cAnd why was I not made aware of this!?\u201d Joxter yelled as he furiously stood up, causing the chair to scoot back and nearly fell over. The Joxter paced around the room with his tail fuzzing up and his ears pressed flat up against his head. Mymble sat there calmly, letting the man let his anger out. Once he seemed to cool down a little, and he stopped stomping about, Mumble got up and took his paws into her own. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cAre you done with you tantrum dear?\u201d The women asked. Joxter glared at her with beady eyes, but have no answer. The two stood in silence for a bit, enjoying at least being together. For not seeing each other for so long, their eyes still showed the twinkle of love that they had when they first met. Nothing would chance that, and Joxter was glad. He would have, however, rather their reunion be much more welcoming than surprising. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cIs, is he here? Our son?\u201d Joxter quickly mumbled out. Mymble chewed on her bottom lip, and tore her eyes away from his. \u201cMymble where-?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d Mymblemamma quickly said. \u201cHe ran away some years ago, he couldn\u2019t take the captivity he said.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cSo our son, a Mumrik of all things, is running around where anyone can find him? Mymble what were you thinking! He could get hurt or killed!\u201d Joxter exclaimed. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHe can take care of himself I\u2019m sure.\u201d Mymble stated. Joxter stood there in absolute shock, and stared at his lover. A son, he\u2019s had a son this whole time and he hadn\u2019t know. He took Mymble into his embrace and gave her a great long hug. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cMy love, you\u2019ve always been a blessing, but I need to find my son.\u201d Joxaren said. Mumble nodded with glassy eyes, and Joxter planted a kiss on her head. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cAsk my Mymble dear. She\u2019s been to many more places recently, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019s at least would have heard if he were anywhere nearby.\u201d Joxter nodded and opened the door, letting a dozen children back into the room. Mymblemamma let out a loud sigh, and Joxter gave her a sympathetic smile. </p><p><br></p><p>Beside the door frame, the Mymble\u2019s Daughter was waiting, having listened into her mothers and the Joxter\u2019s conversation. Mymlan gave the older man a smile, and Joxter returned it with a tip of his hat. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cLittle My has been spending an awful lot of time in Moominvalley.\u201d The young women stated. \u201cShe\u2019s sent me plenty of letters, telling me of her adventures and what not. She also has mentioned a certain vagabond as well.\u201d Her lips formed up into a small smile, and she gave Joxter one of the letters. Joxter skimmed over it a few times, cursing My\u2019s slightly cursive writing, until he came across a certain word. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cMoomin? She\u2019s been staying with Moomin?\u201d Joxaren asked. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cMoomintroll is his son, but yes. She\u2019s been staying with both Moominpappa and Mamma, I recall you being good friends with them right?\u201d Joxter beamed and his grin reached his golden eyes. </p><p><br></p><p>Not only would he be reunited with his old friend, but he\u2019d get to meet his son as well. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhat a time to be alive.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p><br></p><p>The Mother Mymble stood there letting her heart flutter in both love and excitement. Her love had come home for the first time in awhile, and left so suddenly. Her children were running around her feet, causing chaos and havoc wherever they were, yet she stood there in everlasting longing. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOh Mymble my love!\u201d Joxter\u2019s voice sounded from a nearby window, the sudden change in sound giving her a start. She walked over and gazed out towards Joxaren, who was hastily making his way back toward their home. </p><p><br></p><p>Once he arrived back, he stuffed his hand into his pocket and pulled out a gorgeous necklace, and practically shoved it into the woman\u2019s hands. A small blush formed upon his cheeks and his eyes twinkled with wonder. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI got this for you, please take it.\u201d His voice whispered, as he planted a kiss into her hair. The Mymble weighed it in her hands and smiled at the gift, staring at her reflection in the emerald. Below her some of her kids were tugging and pulling at her dress, wanting to see the special gift. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Joxter started, causing the woman and children to look up at him. \u201cI outta get going now. It\u2019s a few days journey to Moominvalley.\u201d He tipped his hat and started to walk back down the path. </p><p><br></p><p>Mymble carefully eyed the necklace, weighing it between both of her hands. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWait Joxter my love.\u201d She said, causing the man to freeze in his steps. \u201cI\u2019m coming with you.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cAre you sure? It\u2019s quite a long journey and you seem to be quite busy with-\u201c</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask, I said I would.\u201d Mymblemamma snapped and started to pack a small bag with things she thought necessary, then fumbled to latch the chain of the necklace. Joxter waited as patiently as he could, his tail flicking and his head tilted slightly. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cMymble dear, please do watch the kids.\u201d The woman said to her eldest. \u201cAnd send a letter Little My\u2019s way, tell her we\u2019re coming.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOf course mother. Please do take care, and come back soon. Safe travels, please take care of my mother Joxter, and say hello to Snufkin for me!\u201d She yelled out the window, where the Mother Mymble and Joxter were already standing. </p><p><br></p><p>The two gave their waves goodbye, which the children returned, and started walking. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhy the sudden interest Mymble Dearest?\u201d Joxter asked as he wrapped his paw around her own. Mymble hummed and pondered her answer, whilst rubbing her thumb on the back of the Joxter\u2019s palm. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to apologize to him.\u201d She started and looked away. \u201cI hardly doubt he\u2019ll forgive me, but he\u2019s got to know I love him with all my heart.\u201d She said. </p><p><br></p><p>Joxter smiled and looked at the forest ahead of them. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p><br></p><p>When Snufkin woke up, there was undoubtedly an obvious weight lifted off upon his shoulders. Not only had he gotten his first full night\u2019s of sleep for the longest time, but he no longer had any reason to hide himself from his best friend. He lifted his arms above his head and stretched, his tail wrapped curled behind him freely. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cSnufkin!!\u201d A voice shouted and opened the flap of his tent. The mumrik jumped up on all fours and his fur stood up straight. Moomintroll stood there looking at Snufkin with an amused expression, his paws shooting up to cover his chuckles. Now that he\u2019d been told about his friends cat like instincts, it was easier to see the small things he did. </p><p><br></p><p>Snufkin\u2019s slit eyes widened in excitement when he saw the troll standing in his tents doorway, yet he still instinctively wrapped his tail around his body. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cMy Moomintroll! What brings you here so early in the morning?\u201d The boy asked as he started to get ready. Moomin watched closely as he covered each part of his mumrik apparence. Like clockwork gloves were donned, scarf wrapped around his slightly furry neck, and hat and hair positioned to cover his pointed ears. </p><p><br></p><p>Throughout all these years he knew his best friend held his secrets, and he respected his privacy. Even though he\u2019d pry every now and then, there was nothing more he\u2019d value than his friends feelings. And now that he\u2019d known possibly Snufkin\u2019s biggest secret, he felt incredibly closer to him and even more valued in their friendship. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cIs there something wrong?\u201d Snufkin\u2019s voice rang through his thoughts. Moomin perked up and fiercely shook his head. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOf course not! Mamma was just wondering if you\u2019d like to join us for lunch? It\u2019s okay if not, but I thought I\u2019d put the offer in the air just in case.\u201d Moomin timidly asked, and glanced at his friend. </p><p><br></p><p>Snufkin gave a soft smile and walked towards Moomin, grabbing his paw and leading him out of the tent. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to join!\u201d Snufkin exclaimed, taking the troll by surprise. Moomin smiled back and they walked toward the house together, casually taking about small things like the flowers currently blooming in the valley and the birds flying high above them. </p><p><br></p><p>The whole time Moomin just took note on how much happier Snufkin seemed, and how he seemed so less stressed. The whole thing made him much happier, and he could only think about how much better things would\u2019ve been had he known about Snufkin\u2019s true self much earlier. </p><p><br></p><p>Moomin didn\u2019t see the appeal and why Snufkin had kept it. He\u2019d never heard of someone having ill feelings towards him, and there were others around that also had Mumrik-like appearances. But it wasn\u2019t just the appearances that Snufkin was worried about it seemed, but his family tree. Snufkin didn\u2019t know what his father had done that entailed the Mumble to hide Snufkin entirely. </p><p><br></p><p>The boy had run off and left behind that life that seemed so sheltered. He risked the constant fear of being chased or found just to be who he wanted to be and never looked behind. Moomin\u2019s heart soared when he realized that he and everyone in Moominvalley is what made him feel safe, and whenever he glanced at Snufkin it made him happier knowing he no longer had to be constantly scared of those around him. </p><p><br></p><p>Finally the front door of Moominhouse stood and Mamma was waiting for them. He clasped her hands together and gave the two a bright smile. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOh Snufkin dear! It\u2019s absolutely wonderful to see you sweetie.\u201d Moominmamma said as she ushered them both into the house. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou as well Mamma! Thank you for inviting me for lunch.\u201d Snufkin said with gratitude. </p><p><br></p><p>In front of them Little My and Moominpappa were already sitting at the table, Pappa sipping his coffee and My blowing bubbles in her milk. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cGood morning everyone.\u201d Snufkin stated as him and Moomintroll took their seats. Little My looked at the two deviously and knowingly smirked. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cMoomin is keeping secrets from us Mamma.\u201d My said, innocently glancing towards the mother. Snufkin and Moomin both froze and let their bodies tense up. The mumrik glared at the small girl and mouthed the words \u2018don\u2019t you dare\u2019. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cAnd what is that Little My?\u201d Pappa asked as he set his coffee down. My didn\u2019t respond to him, but instead her eyes locked onto Snufkin\u2019s. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cMamma\u2019s coming to visit.\u201d The girl said, and looked up to Moominmamma. The woman \u2018hmmed\u2019 in response as she set the plates of food in front of everyone. \u201cShe sent a letter.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cIs she dear?\u201d The mother asked causally. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cShe wants to see Snufkin.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>Had it not been for Moomin, the mumrik would have surely jumped across the table and started a fight with his sister. He could however, feel his claws angrily poking through his gloves and piercing the table. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d Moominpappa asked, as he eyed the flustered looking Snufkin and the worried Moomintroll. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI swear Little My if you-\u201c </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhat mother wouldn\u2019t want to see her favorite child?\u201d My said softly cutting Moomin off, as if it were the most natural words to come out of her mouth. The room went silent and all eyes locked onto the mumrik, who sat there dumbfounded. </p><p><br></p><p>He could hardly believe that My would have the nerve to do such a thing, yet there she was sitting smugly in front of him. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou rotten sister!\u201d Snufkin hissed and nearly threw himself at the girl. Mamma luckily grabbed him by the shoulders and made him sit back down. Little My cackled and had a proud look on her face. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cRather them know your secrets now so they don\u2019t find out when they\u2019re both here don\u2019t you think?\u201d My stated plainly, slouching in her chair. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWait they? Who else is coming, all the children too?\u201d Snufkin asked, ignoring the confused looks of Mamma and Pappa. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not! I wouldn\u2019t still be here if she were. Gah, I left for a reason.\u201d Little My said.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThen who else?\u201d Snufkin pondered. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThe Joxter right?\u201d Moominpappa spoke. All the color drained from Snufkin\u2019s face and his mouth opened and closed with lack of works. Moomin lightly touched his shoulder causing him to flinch and pull away a little. \u201cHe\u2019s Snufkin\u2019s father correct?\u201d He spoke again, looking at Little My who nodded her head. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cPappa how did you know?\u201d Moomin questioned, not turning from his friend who looked second away from panicking. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always had my suspicions. You look an awful lot your father my boy. I didn\u2019t completely put it together until just now when Little My mentioned the Mymble.\u201d Pappa stated. \u201cYou\u2019re about the age of when they started to become latched at the hip those two.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>Snufkin sat in his chair tense as ever, hardly speaking a word. His gaze was downcast and his fists clenched the sides of the chair. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why should speak of him, he wasn\u2019t ever around.\u201d Snufkin mumbled a reply, causing Moominmamma to look at him sadly. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean he wasn\u2019t ever around?\u201d Mamma asked. At this point it seemed lunch was completely disregarded as Snufkin was pulled into another conversation he didn\u2019t want to partake in. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHow do you know my father Pappa?\u201d Snufkin changed the subject, and glanced at the man. Moominpappa seemed to instantly perk up and moved his way into the other room, gabbing a stack of books off a nearby shelf. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWell my boy, your father and I go way back. Yes we sailed on the Oshun Oxtra together! We were good friends.\u201d Pappa stated. Snufkin gazed at him with longing eyes, any sight of anxiety forgotten. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhat, What was he like?\u201d The mumrik asked quietly. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cTo be honest, quite lazy. However, you two are quite similar on the sense that you dislike authority and can\u2019t stay in one place for long.\u201d Moominpappa stated. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cInteresting.\u201d The boy said. \u201cMakes me wonder what he did that caused Mother to have to hide-\u201c Snufkin paused and looked at Moominpappa, who stared back with wide eyes. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHide what Snufkin?\u201d The man pressed. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cMe I guess.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>\u201c\u2018Mumrik\u2019s must always hide their tails\u2019\u201d Little My mocked, and crossed her arms. \u201cMom always treated him like he was special, having him hide his tail and paws for whatever reason. Dumb in my opinion.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOh my\u2026You\u2019re a Mumrik?\u201d Moominpappa asks, almost not believing. Snufkin slowly nods his head, and unwinds his tail to show Moominmamma and Pappa. \u201cWow. Mumrik\u2019s are awfully rare, I guess that\u2019s why you\u2019ve been hiding your tail.\u201d Pappa trailed off. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cAnd his paws, and his feet, and his fangs and ears. Mother made sure of that.\u201d My said, sipping her milk. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhy would Mymble have you hide your tail though? It\u2019s not that uncommon for the children of Mymble\u2019s to have similar features. Too-Ticky even has looks much like your own.\u201d Mamma ask. Snufkin shrugged and opened his mouth to reply, only to be cut off by Little My. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not because of that, it\u2019s because he looks so much like Joxter! Where we Mymble\u2019s are from, he\u2019s not looked fondly upon by the higher ups.\u201d She responded. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cMother would always say that the Joxter did things that some didn\u2019t like.\u201d Snufkin added on. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019m not surprised. Joxaren is pretty big on speaking his mind most of the time. My, how much longer until your mother and Joxter should be here?\u201d Moominpappa asked as he casually handed Snufkin some of his memoirs and drafts that spoke of Joxter. Snufkin took the books and eagerly flipped through them, Moomin reading over his shoulders. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d My started. \u201cMymble sent the letter about a week ago so I\u2019d assume any day now.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhat!\u201d Snufkin slapped the boom shut, causing Moomintroll to jump. \u201cMymble sent a letter that long ago and I\u2019m just finding out about it?\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou seemed busy. It didn\u2019t seem important to me.\u201d Little My shrugged. The boy took in a deep inhale and released it through his nose, and put his head in his hands. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhat am I going to do? What if he doesn\u2019t like me? And oh gosh I haven\u2019t seen Mother in years she\u2019s sure to yell at me. And what will the Joxter think once he finds out I\u2019ve been running from my problems rather than confronting them like a true Mumrik? Oh my gosh I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d Snufkin groaned and plopped back against a wall. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cSnufkin dear.\u201d Mamma\u2019s voice softly spoke. She pulled the boy into a large hug, which caused snicking to tense up. \u201cWhatever happens, we\u2019ll always be here for you.\u201d Snufkin stated still, trying to decide if he wanted to squirm his way out or just do nothing. Eventually, the boy melted into Moominmamma\u2019s touch and hugged her back. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThank you Mamma.\u201d Snufkin whispered and purred slightly. Moominmamma nodded and released the boy, giving him a big grin. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be afraid here. Ever.\u201d</p></p>",

A figure in a flowing green cloak and a bright red hat quickly ran by, dodging hands and tails trying to wrap around him. The figure let out a happy chuckle as he climbed up a tree, digging his sharp claws into the rough bark. The leaves ruffled as he made his way up, and he stole a glance behind him. </p><p>His ears perked at voices, and listened as they disappeared down the footpath. The man\u2019s eyes narrowed in focus as he watched their bodies be lost in the horizon. He slowly and carefully climbed his way out of the tree, and let his feet softly touch the grass on ground. His hand wiped the beads of sweat off oh his forehead, and he crept back down the dirt road where he originally came. </p><p><br></p><p>He dug into his pocket, and pulled out a small silver chain with a emerald pendent on it. Admirably he held it in front of his eyes, and examined it. Those men who had been chasing him seemed to think it was important and worth value, so it was one of the first things he stole back from them. Getting it back to its owner was very important, and hopefully whatever importance it had could be kept away from the wrong hands. </p><p><br></p><p>He shoved the necklace back into his pocket, and glanced at the path forward. The sky fell dark, and stars were starting to paint the sky. Shadows cloaked his body, with only the lanterns of a nearby town illuminating his path. He glanced down toward the houses in front of him, and listened to the hushed voices around him. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s him?\u201d A small boy asked. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the Joxter!\u201d Started a few Snorks. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cDid he chase them off?\u201d Said the girl at the shop. </p><p><br></p><p>The Joxter huffed and rolled his eyes at the comments, and hurried his way toward a small oak door near the middle of the village. He ignored the panicked voices and knocked. In front of him, the door quickly swung open and revealed a small lady, whose golden hair was neatly tied up in a ponytail and had glasses more than likely too big for her face. Her eyes widened once she saw the Joxter\u2019s face, and she took his paws into her own. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOh my goodness Joxter my dear friend! I heard the commotion, did you really chase of the Hattin\u2019s?\u201d The girl asked, causing Joxter\u2019s lips to press together. The Hattin\u2019s had apparently been causing chaos in this village for quite some time, and continued even more once Joxter had arrived. New visitors weren\u2019t very welcome to them, and they were really strict on rules. They told Joxter that he had a measly two hours to collect what he needed and leave. </p><p><br></p><p>Naturally, Joxter wasn\u2019t too fond of the idea, and was quick to nod his head to not cause too much of a scene. Getting what he needed was the main importance at the moment, and he couldn\u2019t afford to gain more attention on himself than he already had. That was until he saw the supposed Hattin\u2019s robbing the residents of the village raw, stealing what they could and dismissing them. So Joxter did what any wise Joxter would do, he shoved what he assumed to be their leader and started a riot. </p><p><br></p><p>So now he was here, standing in front of the village\u2019s \u2018mayor\u2019 who just so happened to be an old acquaintance, with a bunch of prying eyes on him. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Joxaren started. \u201cThey more so chased me out. But I\u2019m sure they won\u2019t come back after I was done with them.\u201d He let out a low chuckle and glanced downwards. The girl in front of him smiled and gave him a slight bow, which earned gasps from the lingering audience around them. She softly coughed and cleared her throat, then opened her mouth. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cEveryone! From now on, we shan\u2019t live in fear, whether it be of the Hattin\u2019s gang, or of the misconceptions of the Joxter. Today, he is a hero, and you shall treat him as such.\u201d She beamed up at the Joxter, and looked back to crowd. \u201cLet is not listen to rumors or stories told by those we don\u2019t trust or know, and rather be grateful that a so called villain has saved someone yet again. For that I\u2019m forever thankful.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>The crowed let out a few hips and horras, and cheered the Joxter on. Joxeran stood there bashfully, and nervously shuffled on both feet. Many mumbles and voices amongst the crowd were saying how \u201cJoxter\u2019s weren\u2019t that bad\u201d and \u201cwe were wrong\u201d. Which the man silently laughed at, and would have rather that been the original assumption. The villages mayor patted the man on the back and turned back into the house.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOh umm, my friend. I retrieved most of the stuff they took. Would you like it back?\u201d Joxter asked, and he started to hold out some of his pockets contents. The girl\u2019s eyes shimmered once more with gratefulness and thanks, as she grabbed a small bucket to dump the stolen belongings in. Joxter\u2019s hand, however, paused once he got to the necklace, and he examined it once more. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou can keep that one, as an award. You seem very fond of it.\u201d Joxter looked at the girl in front of him and smiled. \u201cI\u2019m thinking someone in your life would love it as a gift.\u201d The man did nothing but give a slight nod, and pocketed it once more. After he was done returning the stolen items, he gave the mayor once last tip of his hat and went off his way. His hand hovered over the pocket with the necklace and his thoughts drifted elsewhere. </p><p><br></p><p>Maybe it was time he gifted an old love with a visit. </p><p><br></p><p>[[MORE]]</p><p>\u2014\u2014</p><p><br></p><p>When he knocked on the door, he wasn\u2019t expecting such an angered look once Mymble saw who was at her door. Her children swarmed around her legs, prying their way through her legs and the door to catch a glance at the door and who was angering their mamma so. Joxter swallowed his growing fear and took off his hat, and nervously grasping it in his paws. </p><p><br></p><p>The Mymble stressfully ran her paw through her ashy red hair, and let out a heavy breath through her nose. She ushered both her children and the Joxter into the house and shut the door, slamming it a little causing Joxter to jump a little. He let out a nervous chuckle and sat down in a nearby chaise, stealing glances at the women before him. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cMymble dear,\u201d she started as she looked at her eldest daughter. \u201cBe a dear and take you siblings to the other room. I\u2019ve got some catching up to do with my love.\u201d The Mymble\u2019s Daughter quickly ushered the little ones out of the room, mumbling a quick \u2018yes Mymblemamma\u2019 before hastily shutting the door. </p><p><br></p><p>Mymble looked at Joxter and gave him a soft smile. Joxter returned it, and started to speak. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cMymble my dear-\u201c</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think you think you can speak right now Joxeran.\u201d The women cut the man off, causing him to shrink a little in his chair. \u201cYou\u2019ll do one thing and one thing only before we start this casual conversation. Where have you been all these years?\u201d Mymble spat out, narrowing her eyes at the man in front of her. </p><p><br></p><p>Joxter\u2019s face fell and and he wrapped his tail protectively around him. Mymble was a fierce women, and he\u2019d always known that, yet he didn\u2019t think his parting would impact her this much. Her breaths were sharp and it looks could kill, Joxter would surely be nothing but a memory now. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cNow Mymble love, you know why I couldn\u2019t stay.\u201d He said to kill the silence, yet that comment only made the Mymble more furious. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cAnd why is that huh? Because of the ghosts from your past, the people that would hunt you for your rarity and specialness?\u201d The women towered above him, her fists clinched and face stoic. \u201cDid you ever once think about what you left behind.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOf course my dear!\u201d Joxter said defensively. \u201cAnd not a day went by where I didn\u2019t think of you. But there were things that needed done, rules that needed changed. Of course I thought about how I left you behind but I just can\u2019t stay in one place neither can you!\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about me!\u201d Mymblemamma whispered under her breath, as she sat down. She put her hands to her face and let out a low chuckle. Joxter uncurled from himself and looked at her curiously. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWe have a son Joxter.\u201d The women stated plainly, glancing back at the man in front of her. Joxter froze, and he felt his heart clench. Thoughts ran through his head and his shoulders tensed up. He couldn\u2019t do anything but laugh at the Mymble\u2019s words. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cSurely you\u2019re joking.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cAnd why was I not made aware of this!?\u201d Joxter yelled as he furiously stood up, causing the chair to scoot back and nearly fell over. The Joxter paced around the room with his tail fuzzing up and his ears pressed flat up against his head. Mymble sat there calmly, letting the man let his anger out. Once he seemed to cool down a little, and he stopped stomping about, Mumble got up and took his paws into her own. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cAre you done with you tantrum dear?\u201d The women asked. Joxter glared at her with beady eyes, but have no answer. The two stood in silence for a bit, enjoying at least being together. For not seeing each other for so long, their eyes still showed the twinkle of love that they had when they first met. Nothing would chance that, and Joxter was glad. He would have, however, rather their reunion be much more welcoming than surprising. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cIs, is he here? Our son?\u201d Joxter quickly mumbled out. Mymble chewed on her bottom lip, and tore her eyes away from his. \u201cMymble where-?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d Mymblemamma quickly said. \u201cHe ran away some years ago, he couldn\u2019t take the captivity he said.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cSo our son, a Mumrik of all things, is running around where anyone can find him? Mymble what were you thinking! He could get hurt or killed!\u201d Joxter exclaimed. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHe can take care of himself I\u2019m sure.\u201d Mymble stated. Joxter stood there in absolute shock, and stared at his lover. A son, he\u2019s had a son this whole time and he hadn\u2019t know. He took Mymble into his embrace and gave her a great long hug. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cMy love, you\u2019ve always been a blessing, but I need to find my son.\u201d Joxaren said. Mumble nodded with glassy eyes, and Joxter planted a kiss on her head. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cAsk my Mymble dear. She\u2019s been to many more places recently, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019s at least would have heard if he were anywhere nearby.\u201d Joxter nodded and opened the door, letting a dozen children back into the room. Mymblemamma let out a loud sigh, and Joxter gave her a sympathetic smile. </p><p><br></p><p>Beside the door frame, the Mymble\u2019s Daughter was waiting, having listened into her mothers and the Joxter\u2019s conversation. Mymlan gave the older man a smile, and Joxter returned it with a tip of his hat. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cLittle My has been spending an awful lot of time in Moominvalley.\u201d The young women stated. \u201cShe\u2019s sent me plenty of letters, telling me of her adventures and what not. She also has mentioned a certain vagabond as well.\u201d Her lips formed up into a small smile, and she gave Joxter one of the letters. Joxter skimmed over it a few times, cursing My\u2019s slightly cursive writing, until he came across a certain word. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cMoomin? She\u2019s been staying with Moomin?\u201d Joxaren asked. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cMoomintroll is his son, but yes. She\u2019s been staying with both Moominpappa and Mamma, I recall you being good friends with them right?\u201d Joxter beamed and his grin reached his golden eyes. </p><p><br></p><p>Not only would he be reunited with his old friend, but he\u2019d get to meet his son as well. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhat a time to be alive.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><p><br></p><p>The Mother Mymble stood there letting her heart flutter in both love and excitement. Her love had come home for the first time in awhile, and left so suddenly. Her children were running around her feet, causing chaos and havoc wherever they were, yet she stood there in everlasting longing. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOh Mymble my love!\u201d Joxter\u2019s voice sounded from a nearby window, the sudden change in sound giving her a start. She walked over and gazed out towards Joxaren, who was hastily making his way back toward their home. </p><p><br></p><p>Once he arrived back, he stuffed his hand into his pocket and pulled out a gorgeous necklace, and practically shoved it into the woman\u2019s hands. A small blush formed upon his cheeks and his eyes twinkled with wonder. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI got this for you, please take it.\u201d His voice whispered, as he planted a kiss into her hair. The Mymble weighed it in her hands and smiled at the gift, staring at her reflection in the emerald. Below her some of her kids were tugging and pulling at her dress, wanting to see the special gift. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Joxter started, causing the woman and children to look up at him. \u201cI outta get going now. It\u2019s a few days journey to Moominvalley.\u201d He tipped his hat and started to walk back down the path. </p><p><br></p><p>Mymble carefully eyed the necklace, weighing it between both of her hands. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWait Joxter my love.\u201d She said, causing the man to freeze in his steps. \u201cI\u2019m coming with you.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cAre you sure? It\u2019s quite a long journey and you seem to be quite busy with-\u201c</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask, I said I would.\u201d Mymblemamma snapped and started to pack a small bag with things she thought necessary, then fumbled to latch the chain of the necklace. Joxter waited as patiently as he could, his tail flicking and his head tilted slightly. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cMymble dear, please do watch the kids.\u201d The woman said to her eldest. \u201cAnd send a letter Little My\u2019s way, tell her we\u2019re coming.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOf course mother. Please do take care, and come back soon. Safe travels, please take care of my mother Joxter, and say hello to Snufkin for me!\u201d She yelled out the window, where the Mother Mymble and Joxter were already standing. </p><p><br></p><p>The two gave their waves goodbye, which the children returned, and started walking. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhy the sudden interest Mymble Dearest?\u201d Joxter asked as he wrapped his paw around her own. Mymble hummed and pondered her answer, whilst rubbing her thumb on the back of the Joxter\u2019s palm. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to apologize to him.\u201d She started and looked away. \u201cI hardly doubt he\u2019ll forgive me, but he\u2019s got to know I love him with all my heart.\u201d She said. </p><p><br></p><p>Joxter smiled and looked at the forest ahead of them. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p><br></p><p>When Snufkin woke up, there was undoubtedly an obvious weight lifted off upon his shoulders. Not only had he gotten his first full night\u2019s of sleep for the longest time, but he no longer had any reason to hide himself from his best friend. He lifted his arms above his head and stretched, his tail wrapped curled behind him freely. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cSnufkin!!\u201d A voice shouted and opened the flap of his tent. The mumrik jumped up on all fours and his fur stood up straight. Moomintroll stood there looking at Snufkin with an amused expression, his paws shooting up to cover his chuckles. Now that he\u2019d been told about his friends cat like instincts, it was easier to see the small things he did. </p><p><br></p><p>Snufkin\u2019s slit eyes widened in excitement when he saw the troll standing in his tents doorway, yet he still instinctively wrapped his tail around his body. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cMy Moomintroll! What brings you here so early in the morning?\u201d The boy asked as he started to get ready. Moomin watched closely as he covered each part of his mumrik apparence. Like clockwork gloves were donned, scarf wrapped around his slightly furry neck, and hat and hair positioned to cover his pointed ears. </p><p><br></p><p>Throughout all these years he knew his best friend held his secrets, and he respected his privacy. Even though he\u2019d pry every now and then, there was nothing more he\u2019d value than his friends feelings. And now that he\u2019d known possibly Snufkin\u2019s biggest secret, he felt incredibly closer to him and even more valued in their friendship. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cIs there something wrong?\u201d Snufkin\u2019s voice rang through his thoughts. Moomin perked up and fiercely shook his head. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOf course not! Mamma was just wondering if you\u2019d like to join us for lunch? It\u2019s okay if not, but I thought I\u2019d put the offer in the air just in case.\u201d Moomin timidly asked, and glanced at his friend. </p><p><br></p><p>Snufkin gave a soft smile and walked towards Moomin, grabbing his paw and leading him out of the tent. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to join!\u201d Snufkin exclaimed, taking the troll by surprise. Moomin smiled back and they walked toward the house together, casually taking about small things like the flowers currently blooming in the valley and the birds flying high above them. </p><p><br></p><p>The whole time Moomin just took note on how much happier Snufkin seemed, and how he seemed so less stressed. The whole thing made him much happier, and he could only think about how much better things would\u2019ve been had he known about Snufkin\u2019s true self much earlier. </p><p><br></p><p>Moomin didn\u2019t see the appeal and why Snufkin had kept it. He\u2019d never heard of someone having ill feelings towards him, and there were others around that also had Mumrik-like appearances. But it wasn\u2019t just the appearances that Snufkin was worried about it seemed, but his family tree. Snufkin didn\u2019t know what his father had done that entailed the Mumble to hide Snufkin entirely. </p><p><br></p><p>The boy had run off and left behind that life that seemed so sheltered. He risked the constant fear of being chased or found just to be who he wanted to be and never looked behind. Moomin\u2019s heart soared when he realized that he and everyone in Moominvalley is what made him feel safe, and whenever he glanced at Snufkin it made him happier knowing he no longer had to be constantly scared of those around him. </p><p><br></p><p>Finally the front door of Moominhouse stood and Mamma was waiting for them. He clasped her hands together and gave the two a bright smile. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOh Snufkin dear! It\u2019s absolutely wonderful to see you sweetie.\u201d Moominmamma said as she ushered them both into the house. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou as well Mamma! Thank you for inviting me for lunch.\u201d Snufkin said with gratitude. </p><p><br></p><p>In front of them Little My and Moominpappa were already sitting at the table, Pappa sipping his coffee and My blowing bubbles in her milk. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cGood morning everyone.\u201d Snufkin stated as him and Moomintroll took their seats. Little My looked at the two deviously and knowingly smirked. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cMoomin is keeping secrets from us Mamma.\u201d My said, innocently glancing towards the mother. Snufkin and Moomin both froze and let their bodies tense up. The mumrik glared at the small girl and mouthed the words \u2018don\u2019t you dare\u2019. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cAnd what is that Little My?\u201d Pappa asked as he set his coffee down. My didn\u2019t respond to him, but instead her eyes locked onto Snufkin\u2019s. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cMamma\u2019s coming to visit.\u201d The girl said, and looked up to Moominmamma. The woman \u2018hmmed\u2019 in response as she set the plates of food in front of everyone. \u201cShe sent a letter.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cIs she dear?\u201d The mother asked causally. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cShe wants to see Snufkin.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>Had it not been for Moomin, the mumrik would have surely jumped across the table and started a fight with his sister. He could however, feel his claws angrily poking through his gloves and piercing the table. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d Moominpappa asked, as he eyed the flustered looking Snufkin and the worried Moomintroll. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI swear Little My if you-\u201c </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhat mother wouldn\u2019t want to see her favorite child?\u201d My said softly cutting Moomin off, as if it were the most natural words to come out of her mouth. The room went silent and all eyes locked onto the mumrik, who sat there dumbfounded. </p><p><br></p><p>He could hardly believe that My would have the nerve to do such a thing, yet there she was sitting smugly in front of him. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou rotten sister!\u201d Snufkin hissed and nearly threw himself at the girl. Mamma luckily grabbed him by the shoulders and made him sit back down. Little My cackled and had a proud look on her face. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cRather them know your secrets now so they don\u2019t find out when they\u2019re both here don\u2019t you think?\u201d My stated plainly, slouching in her chair. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWait they? Who else is coming, all the children too?\u201d Snufkin asked, ignoring the confused looks of Mamma and Pappa. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not! I wouldn\u2019t still be here if she were. Gah, I left for a reason.\u201d Little My said.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThen who else?\u201d Snufkin pondered. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThe Joxter right?\u201d Moominpappa spoke. All the color drained from Snufkin\u2019s face and his mouth opened and closed with lack of works. Moomin lightly touched his shoulder causing him to flinch and pull away a little. \u201cHe\u2019s Snufkin\u2019s father correct?\u201d He spoke again, looking at Little My who nodded her head. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cPappa how did you know?\u201d Moomin questioned, not turning from his friend who looked second away from panicking. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always had my suspicions. You look an awful lot your father my boy. I didn\u2019t completely put it together until just now when Little My mentioned the Mymble.\u201d Pappa stated. \u201cYou\u2019re about the age of when they started to become latched at the hip those two.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>Snufkin sat in his chair tense as ever, hardly speaking a word. His gaze was downcast and his fists clenched the sides of the chair. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why should speak of him, he wasn\u2019t ever around.\u201d Snufkin mumbled a reply, causing Moominmamma to look at him sadly. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean he wasn\u2019t ever around?\u201d Mamma asked. At this point it seemed lunch was completely disregarded as Snufkin was pulled into another conversation he didn\u2019t want to partake in. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHow do you know my father Pappa?\u201d Snufkin changed the subject, and glanced at the man. Moominpappa seemed to instantly perk up and moved his way into the other room, gabbing a stack of books off a nearby shelf. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWell my boy, your father and I go way back. Yes we sailed on the Oshun Oxtra together! We were good friends.\u201d Pappa stated. Snufkin gazed at him with longing eyes, any sight of anxiety forgotten. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhat, What was he like?\u201d The mumrik asked quietly. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cTo be honest, quite lazy. However, you two are quite similar on the sense that you dislike authority and can\u2019t stay in one place for long.\u201d Moominpappa stated. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cInteresting.\u201d The boy said. \u201cMakes me wonder what he did that caused Mother to have to hide-\u201c Snufkin paused and looked at Moominpappa, who stared back with wide eyes. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHide what Snufkin?\u201d The man pressed. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cMe I guess.\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>\u201c\u2018Mumrik\u2019s must always hide their tails\u2019\u201d Little My mocked, and crossed her arms. \u201cMom always treated him like he was special, having him hide his tail and paws for whatever reason. Dumb in my opinion.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOh my\u2026You\u2019re a Mumrik?\u201d Moominpappa asks, almost not believing. Snufkin slowly nods his head, and unwinds his tail to show Moominmamma and Pappa. \u201cWow. Mumrik\u2019s are awfully rare, I guess that\u2019s why you\u2019ve been hiding your tail.\u201d Pappa trailed off. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cAnd his paws, and his feet, and his fangs and ears. Mother made sure of that.\u201d My said, sipping her milk. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhy would Mymble have you hide your tail though? It\u2019s not that uncommon for the children of Mymble\u2019s to have similar features. Too-Ticky even has looks much like your own.\u201d Mamma ask. Snufkin shrugged and opened his mouth to reply, only to be cut off by Little My. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not because of that, it\u2019s because he looks so much like Joxter! Where we Mymble\u2019s are from, he\u2019s not looked fondly upon by the higher ups.\u201d She responded. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cMother would always say that the Joxter did things that some didn\u2019t like.\u201d Snufkin added on. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019m not surprised. Joxaren is pretty big on speaking his mind most of the time. My, how much longer until your mother and Joxter should be here?\u201d Moominpappa asked as he casually handed Snufkin some of his memoirs and drafts that spoke of Joxter. Snufkin took the books and eagerly flipped through them, Moomin reading over his shoulders. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d My started. \u201cMymble sent the letter about a week ago so I\u2019d assume any day now.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhat!\u201d Snufkin slapped the boom shut, causing Moomintroll to jump. \u201cMymble sent a letter that long ago and I\u2019m just finding out about it?\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou seemed busy. It didn\u2019t seem important to me.\u201d Little My shrugged. The boy took in a deep inhale and released it through his nose, and put his head in his hands. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhat am I going to do? What if he doesn\u2019t like me? And oh gosh I haven\u2019t seen Mother in years she\u2019s sure to yell at me. And what will the Joxter think once he finds out I\u2019ve been running from my problems rather than confronting them like a true Mumrik? Oh my gosh I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d Snufkin groaned and plopped back against a wall. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cSnufkin dear.\u201d Mamma\u2019s voice softly spoke. She pulled the boy into a large hug, which caused snicking to tense up. \u201cWhatever happens, we\u2019ll always be here for you.\u201d Snufkin stated still, trying to decide if he wanted to squirm his way out or just do nothing. Eventually, the boy melted into Moominmamma\u2019s touch and hugged her back. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThank you Mamma.\u201d Snufkin whispered and purred slightly. Moominmamma nodded and released the boy, giving him a big grin. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be afraid here. Ever.\u201d</p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h1>The Joxter&rsquo;s Son-4&amp;5</h1><p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">Here you go my bad sorry</p><p>&ldquo;Hey get back here!&rdquo; A large, booming voice yelled. A figure in a flowing green cloak and a bright red hat quickly ran by, dodging hands and tails trying to wrap around him. The figure let out a happy chuckle as he climbed up a tree, digging his sharp claws into the rough bark. The leaves ruffled as he made his way up, and he stole a glance behind him. </p><p>His ears perked at voices, and listened as they disappeared down the footpath. The man&rsquo;s eyes narrowed in focus as he watched their bodies be lost in the horizon. He slowly and carefully climbed his way out of the tree, and let his feet softly touch the grass on ground. His hand wiped the beads of sweat off oh his forehead, and he crept back down the dirt road where he originally came. </p><p><br /></p><p>He dug into his pocket, and pulled out a small silver chain with a emerald pendent on it. Admirably he held it in front of his eyes, and examined it. Those men who had been chasing him seemed to think it was important and worth value, so it was one of the first things he stole back from them. Getting it back to its owner was very important, and hopefully whatever importance it had could be kept away from the wrong hands. </p><p><br /></p><p>He shoved the necklace back into his pocket, and glanced at the path forward. The sky fell dark, and stars were starting to paint the sky. Shadows cloaked his body, with only the lanterns of a nearby town illuminating his path. He glanced down toward the houses in front of him, and listened to the hushed voices around him. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s him?&rdquo; A small boy asked. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Joxter!&rdquo; Started a few Snorks. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Did he chase them off?&rdquo; Said the girl at the shop. </p><p><br /></p><p>The Joxter huffed and rolled his eyes at the comments, and hurried his way toward a small oak door near the middle of the village. He ignored the panicked voices and knocked. In front of him, the door quickly swung open and revealed a small lady, whose golden hair was neatly tied up in a ponytail and had glasses more than likely too big for her face. Her eyes widened once she saw the Joxter&rsquo;s face, and she took his paws into her own. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh my goodness Joxter my dear friend! I heard the commotion, did you really chase of the Hattin&rsquo;s?&rdquo; The girl asked, causing Joxter&rsquo;s lips to press together. The Hattin&rsquo;s had apparently been causing chaos in this village for quite some time, and continued even more once Joxter had arrived. New visitors weren&rsquo;t very welcome to them, and they were really strict on rules. They told Joxter that he had a measly two hours to collect what he needed and leave. </p><p><br /></p><p>Naturally, Joxter wasn&rsquo;t too fond of the idea, and was quick to nod his head to not cause too much of a scene. Getting what he needed was the main importance at the moment, and he couldn&rsquo;t afford to gain more attention on himself than he already had. That was until he saw the supposed Hattin&rsquo;s robbing the residents of the village raw, stealing what they could and dismissing them. So Joxter did what any wise Joxter would do, he shoved what he assumed to be their leader and started a riot. </p><p><br /></p><p>So now he was here, standing in front of the village&rsquo;s &lsquo;mayor&rsquo; who just so happened to be an old acquaintance, with a bunch of prying eyes on him. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Joxaren started. &ldquo;They more so chased me out. But I&rsquo;m sure they won&rsquo;t come back after I was done with them.&rdquo; He let out a low chuckle and glanced downwards. The girl in front of him smiled and gave him a slight bow, which earned gasps from the lingering audience around them. She softly coughed and cleared her throat, then opened her mouth. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Everyone! From now on, we shan&rsquo;t live in fear, whether it be of the Hattin&rsquo;s gang, or of the misconceptions of the Joxter. Today, he is a hero, and you shall treat him as such.&rdquo; She beamed up at the Joxter, and looked back to crowd. &ldquo;Let is not listen to rumors or stories told by those we don&rsquo;t trust or know, and rather be grateful that a so called villain has saved someone yet again. For that I&rsquo;m forever thankful.&rdquo; </p><p><br /></p><p>The crowed let out a few hips and horras, and cheered the Joxter on. Joxeran stood there bashfully, and nervously shuffled on both feet. Many mumbles and voices amongst the crowd were saying how &ldquo;Joxter&rsquo;s weren&rsquo;t that bad&rdquo; and &ldquo;we were wrong&rdquo;. Which the man silently laughed at, and would have rather that been the original assumption. The villages mayor patted the man on the back and turned back into the house.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh umm, my friend. I retrieved most of the stuff they took. Would you like it back?&rdquo; Joxter asked, and he started to hold out some of his pockets contents. The girl&rsquo;s eyes shimmered once more with gratefulness and thanks, as she grabbed a small bucket to dump the stolen belongings in. Joxter&rsquo;s hand, however, paused once he got to the necklace, and he examined it once more. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;You can keep that one, as an award. You seem very fond of it.&rdquo; Joxter looked at the girl in front of him and smiled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking someone in your life would love it as a gift.&rdquo; The man did nothing but give a slight nod, and pocketed it once more. After he was done returning the stolen items, he gave the mayor once last tip of his hat and went off his way. His hand hovered over the pocket with the necklace and his thoughts drifted elsewhere. </p><p><br /></p><p>Maybe it was time he gifted an old love with a visit. </p><p><br /></p><p>&mdash;&mdash;</p><p><br /></p><p>When he knocked on the door, he wasn&rsquo;t expecting such an angered look once Mymble saw who was at her door. Her children swarmed around her legs, prying their way through her legs and the door to catch a glance at the door and who was angering their mamma so. Joxter swallowed his growing fear and took off his hat, and nervously grasping it in his paws. </p><p><br /></p><p>The Mymble stressfully ran her paw through her ashy red hair, and let out a heavy breath through her nose. She ushered both her children and the Joxter into the house and shut the door, slamming it a little causing Joxter to jump a little. He let out a nervous chuckle and sat down in a nearby chaise, stealing glances at the women before him. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Mymble dear,&rdquo; she started as she looked at her eldest daughter. &ldquo;Be a dear and take you siblings to the other room. I&rsquo;ve got some catching up to do with my love.&rdquo; The Mymble&rsquo;s Daughter quickly ushered the little ones out of the room, mumbling a quick &lsquo;yes Mymblemamma&rsquo; before hastily shutting the door. </p><p><br /></p><p>Mymble looked at Joxter and gave him a soft smile. Joxter returned it, and started to speak. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Mymble my dear-&ldquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you think you can speak right now Joxeran.&rdquo; The women cut the man off, causing him to shrink a little in his chair. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do one thing and one thing only before we start this casual conversation. Where have you been all these years?&rdquo; Mymble spat out, narrowing her eyes at the man in front of her. </p><p><br /></p><p>Joxter&rsquo;s face fell and and he wrapped his tail protectively around him. Mymble was a fierce women, and he&rsquo;d always known that, yet he didn&rsquo;t think his parting would impact her this much. Her breaths were sharp and it looks could kill, Joxter would surely be nothing but a memory now. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Now Mymble love, you know why I couldn&rsquo;t stay.&rdquo; He said to kill the silence, yet that comment only made the Mymble more furious. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;And why is that huh? Because of the ghosts from your past, the people that would hunt you for your rarity and specialness?&rdquo; The women towered above him, her fists clinched and face stoic. &ldquo;Did you ever once think about what you left behind.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Of course my dear!&rdquo; Joxter said defensively. &ldquo;And not a day went by where I didn&rsquo;t think of you. But there were things that needed done, rules that needed changed. Of course I thought about how I left you behind but I just can&rsquo;t stay in one place neither can you!&rdquo; </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not talking about me!&rdquo; Mymblemamma whispered under her breath, as she sat down. She put her hands to her face and let out a low chuckle. Joxter uncurled from himself and looked at her curiously. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;We have a son Joxter.&rdquo; The women stated plainly, glancing back at the man in front of her. Joxter froze, and he felt his heart clench. Thoughts ran through his head and his shoulders tensed up. He couldn&rsquo;t do anything but laugh at the Mymble&rsquo;s words. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Surely you&rsquo;re joking.&rdquo; </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo; </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;And why was I not made aware of this!?&rdquo; Joxter yelled as he furiously stood up, causing the chair to scoot back and nearly fell over. The Joxter paced around the room with his tail fuzzing up and his ears pressed flat up against his head. Mymble sat there calmly, letting the man let his anger out. Once he seemed to cool down a little, and he stopped stomping about, Mumble got up and took his paws into her own. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Are you done with you tantrum dear?&rdquo; The women asked. Joxter glared at her with beady eyes, but have no answer. The two stood in silence for a bit, enjoying at least being together. For not seeing each other for so long, their eyes still showed the twinkle of love that they had when they first met. Nothing would chance that, and Joxter was glad. He would have, however, rather their reunion be much more welcoming than surprising. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Is, is he here? Our son?&rdquo; Joxter quickly mumbled out. Mymble chewed on her bottom lip, and tore her eyes away from his. &ldquo;Mymble where-?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure.&rdquo; Mymblemamma quickly said. &ldquo;He ran away some years ago, he couldn&rsquo;t take the captivity he said.&rdquo; </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;So our son, a Mumrik of all things, is running around where anyone can find him? Mymble what were you thinking! He could get hurt or killed!&rdquo; Joxter exclaimed. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;He can take care of himself I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo; Mymble stated. Joxter stood there in absolute shock, and stared at his lover. A son, he&rsquo;s had a son this whole time and he hadn&rsquo;t know. He took Mymble into his embrace and gave her a great long hug. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;My love, you&rsquo;ve always been a blessing, but I need to find my son.&rdquo; Joxaren said. Mumble nodded with glassy eyes, and Joxter planted a kiss on her head. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Ask my Mymble dear. She&rsquo;s been to many more places recently, and I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;s at least would have heard if he were anywhere nearby.&rdquo; Joxter nodded and opened the door, letting a dozen children back into the room. Mymblemamma let out a loud sigh, and Joxter gave her a sympathetic smile. </p><p><br /></p><p>Beside the door frame, the Mymble&rsquo;s Daughter was waiting, having listened into her mothers and the Joxter&rsquo;s conversation. Mymlan gave the older man a smile, and Joxter returned it with a tip of his hat. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Little My has been spending an awful lot of time in Moominvalley.&rdquo; The young women stated. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s sent me plenty of letters, telling me of her adventures and what not. She also has mentioned a certain vagabond as well.&rdquo; Her lips formed up into a small smile, and she gave Joxter one of the letters. Joxter skimmed over it a few times, cursing My&rsquo;s slightly cursive writing, until he came across a certain word. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Moomin? She&rsquo;s been staying with Moomin?&rdquo; Joxaren asked. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Moomintroll is his son, but yes. She&rsquo;s been staying with both Moominpappa and Mamma, I recall you being good friends with them right?&rdquo; Joxter beamed and his grin reached his golden eyes. </p><p><br /></p><p>Not only would he be reunited with his old friend, but he&rsquo;d get to meet his son as well. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;What a time to be alive.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p><br /></p><p>The Mother Mymble stood there letting her heart flutter in both love and excitement. Her love had come home for the first time in awhile, and left so suddenly. Her children were running around her feet, causing chaos and havoc wherever they were, yet she stood there in everlasting longing. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh Mymble my love!&rdquo; Joxter&rsquo;s voice sounded from a nearby window, the sudden change in sound giving her a start. She walked over and gazed out towards Joxaren, who was hastily making his way back toward their home. </p><p><br /></p><p>Once he arrived back, he stuffed his hand into his pocket and pulled out a gorgeous necklace, and practically shoved it into the woman&rsquo;s hands. A small blush formed upon his cheeks and his eyes twinkled with wonder. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I got this for you, please take it.&rdquo; His voice whispered, as he planted a kiss into her hair. The Mymble weighed it in her hands and smiled at the gift, staring at her reflection in the emerald. Below her some of her kids were tugging and pulling at her dress, wanting to see the special gift. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Joxter started, causing the woman and children to look up at him. &ldquo;I outta get going now. It&rsquo;s a few days journey to Moominvalley.&rdquo; He tipped his hat and started to walk back down the path. </p><p><br /></p><p>Mymble carefully eyed the necklace, weighing it between both of her hands. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Wait Joxter my love.&rdquo; She said, causing the man to freeze in his steps. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming with you.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure? It&rsquo;s quite a long journey and you seem to be quite busy with-&ldquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t ask, I said I would.&rdquo; Mymblemamma snapped and started to pack a small bag with things she thought necessary, then fumbled to latch the chain of the necklace. Joxter waited as patiently as he could, his tail flicking and his head tilted slightly. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Mymble dear, please do watch the kids.&rdquo; The woman said to her eldest. &ldquo;And send a letter Little My&rsquo;s way, tell her we&rsquo;re coming.&rdquo; </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Of course mother. Please do take care, and come back soon. Safe travels, please take care of my mother Joxter, and say hello to Snufkin for me!&rdquo; She yelled out the window, where the Mother Mymble and Joxter were already standing. </p><p><br /></p><p>The two gave their waves goodbye, which the children returned, and started walking. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Why the sudden interest Mymble Dearest?&rdquo; Joxter asked as he wrapped his paw around her own. Mymble hummed and pondered her answer, whilst rubbing her thumb on the back of the Joxter&rsquo;s palm. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to apologize to him.&rdquo; She started and looked away. &ldquo;I hardly doubt he&rsquo;ll forgive me, but he&rsquo;s got to know I love him with all my heart.&rdquo; She said. </p><p><br /></p><p>Joxter smiled and looked at the forest ahead of them. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Me too.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p><br /></p><p>When Snufkin woke up, there was undoubtedly an obvious weight lifted off upon his shoulders. Not only had he gotten his first full night&rsquo;s of sleep for the longest time, but he no longer had any reason to hide himself from his best friend. He lifted his arms above his head and stretched, his tail wrapped curled behind him freely. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Snufkin!!&rdquo; A voice shouted and opened the flap of his tent. The mumrik jumped up on all fours and his fur stood up straight. Moomintroll stood there looking at Snufkin with an amused expression, his paws shooting up to cover his chuckles. Now that he&rsquo;d been told about his friends cat like instincts, it was easier to see the small things he did. </p><p><br /></p><p>Snufkin&rsquo;s slit eyes widened in excitement when he saw the troll standing in his tents doorway, yet he still instinctively wrapped his tail around his body. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;My Moomintroll! What brings you here so early in the morning?&rdquo; The boy asked as he started to get ready. Moomin watched closely as he covered each part of his mumrik apparence. Like clockwork gloves were donned, scarf wrapped around his slightly furry neck, and hat and hair positioned to cover his pointed ears. </p><p><br /></p><p>Throughout all these years he knew his best friend held his secrets, and he respected his privacy. Even though he&rsquo;d pry every now and then, there was nothing more he&rsquo;d value than his friends feelings. And now that he&rsquo;d known possibly Snufkin&rsquo;s biggest secret, he felt incredibly closer to him and even more valued in their friendship. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Is there something wrong?&rdquo; Snufkin&rsquo;s voice rang through his thoughts. Moomin perked up and fiercely shook his head. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Of course not! Mamma was just wondering if you&rsquo;d like to join us for lunch? It&rsquo;s okay if not, but I thought I&rsquo;d put the offer in the air just in case.&rdquo; Moomin timidly asked, and glanced at his friend. </p><p><br /></p><p>Snufkin gave a soft smile and walked towards Moomin, grabbing his paw and leading him out of the tent. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to join!&rdquo; Snufkin exclaimed, taking the troll by surprise. Moomin smiled back and they walked toward the house together, casually taking about small things like the flowers currently blooming in the valley and the birds flying high above them. </p><p><br /></p><p>The whole time Moomin just took note on how much happier Snufkin seemed, and how he seemed so less stressed. The whole thing made him much happier, and he could only think about how much better things would&rsquo;ve been had he known about Snufkin&rsquo;s true self much earlier. </p><p><br /></p><p>Moomin didn&rsquo;t see the appeal and why Snufkin had kept it. He&rsquo;d never heard of someone having ill feelings towards him, and there were others around that also had Mumrik-like appearances. But it wasn&rsquo;t just the appearances that Snufkin was worried about it seemed, but his family tree. Snufkin didn&rsquo;t know what his father had done that entailed the Mumble to hide Snufkin entirely. </p><p><br /></p><p>The boy had run off and left behind that life that seemed so sheltered. He risked the constant fear of being chased or found just to be who he wanted to be and never looked behind. Moomin&rsquo;s heart soared when he realized that he and everyone in Moominvalley is what made him feel safe, and whenever he glanced at Snufkin it made him happier knowing he no longer had to be constantly scared of those around him. </p><p><br /></p><p>Finally the front door of Moominhouse stood and Mamma was waiting for them. He clasped her hands together and gave the two a bright smile. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh Snufkin dear! It&rsquo;s absolutely wonderful to see you sweetie.&rdquo; Moominmamma said as she ushered them both into the house. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;You as well Mamma! Thank you for inviting me for lunch.&rdquo; Snufkin said with gratitude. </p><p><br /></p><p>In front of them Little My and Moominpappa were already sitting at the table, Pappa sipping his coffee and My blowing bubbles in her milk. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Good morning everyone.&rdquo; Snufkin stated as him and Moomintroll took their seats. Little My looked at the two deviously and knowingly smirked. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Moomin is keeping secrets from us Mamma.&rdquo; My said, innocently glancing towards the mother. Snufkin and Moomin both froze and let their bodies tense up. The mumrik glared at the small girl and mouthed the words &lsquo;don&rsquo;t you dare&rsquo;. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;And what is that Little My?&rdquo; Pappa asked as he set his coffee down. My didn&rsquo;t respond to him, but instead her eyes locked onto Snufkin&rsquo;s. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Mamma&rsquo;s coming to visit.&rdquo; The girl said, and looked up to Moominmamma. The woman &lsquo;hmmed&rsquo; in response as she set the plates of food in front of everyone. &ldquo;She sent a letter.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Is she dear?&rdquo; The mother asked causally. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;She wants to see Snufkin.&rdquo; </p><p><br /></p><p>Had it not been for Moomin, the mumrik would have surely jumped across the table and started a fight with his sister. He could however, feel his claws angrily poking through his gloves and piercing the table. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;And why is that?&rdquo; Moominpappa asked, as he eyed the flustered looking Snufkin and the worried Moomintroll. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I swear Little My if you-&ldquo; </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;What mother wouldn&rsquo;t want to see her favorite child?&rdquo; My said softly cutting Moomin off, as if it were the most natural words to come out of her mouth. The room went silent and all eyes locked onto the mumrik, who sat there dumbfounded. </p><p><br /></p><p>He could hardly believe that My would have the nerve to do such a thing, yet there she was sitting smugly in front of him. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;You rotten sister!&rdquo; Snufkin hissed and nearly threw himself at the girl. Mamma luckily grabbed him by the shoulders and made him sit back down. Little My cackled and had a proud look on her face. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Rather them know your secrets now so they don&rsquo;t find out when they&rsquo;re both here don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo; My stated plainly, slouching in her chair. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Wait they? Who else is coming, all the children too?&rdquo; Snufkin asked, ignoring the confused looks of Mamma and Pappa. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Absolutely not! I wouldn&rsquo;t still be here if she were. Gah, I left for a reason.&rdquo; Little My said.</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Then who else?&rdquo; Snufkin pondered. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;The Joxter right?&rdquo; Moominpappa spoke. All the color drained from Snufkin&rsquo;s face and his mouth opened and closed with lack of works. Moomin lightly touched his shoulder causing him to flinch and pull away a little. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s Snufkin&rsquo;s father correct?&rdquo; He spoke again, looking at Little My who nodded her head. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Pappa how did you know?&rdquo; Moomin questioned, not turning from his friend who looked second away from panicking. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always had my suspicions. You look an awful lot your father my boy. I didn&rsquo;t completely put it together until just now when Little My mentioned the Mymble.&rdquo; Pappa stated. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re about the age of when they started to become latched at the hip those two.&rdquo; </p><p><br /></p><p>Snufkin sat in his chair tense as ever, hardly speaking a word. His gaze was downcast and his fists clenched the sides of the chair. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why should speak of him, he wasn&rsquo;t ever around.&rdquo; Snufkin mumbled a reply, causing Moominmamma to look at him sadly. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean he wasn&rsquo;t ever around?&rdquo; Mamma asked. At this point it seemed lunch was completely disregarded as Snufkin was pulled into another conversation he didn&rsquo;t want to partake in. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;How do you know my father Pappa?&rdquo; Snufkin changed the subject, and glanced at the man. Moominpappa seemed to instantly perk up and moved his way into the other room, gabbing a stack of books off a nearby shelf. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well my boy, your father and I go way back. Yes we sailed on the Oshun Oxtra together! We were good friends.&rdquo; Pappa stated. Snufkin gazed at him with longing eyes, any sight of anxiety forgotten. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;What, What was he like?&rdquo; The mumrik asked quietly. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;To be honest, quite lazy. However, you two are quite similar on the sense that you dislike authority and can&rsquo;t stay in one place for long.&rdquo; Moominpappa stated. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Interesting.&rdquo; The boy said. &ldquo;Makes me wonder what he did that caused Mother to have to hide-&ldquo; Snufkin paused and looked at Moominpappa, who stared back with wide eyes. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hide what Snufkin?&rdquo; The man pressed. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Me I guess.&rdquo; </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mumrik&rsquo;s must always hide their tails&rsquo;&rdquo; Little My mocked, and crossed her arms. &ldquo;Mom always treated him like he was special, having him hide his tail and paws for whatever reason. Dumb in my opinion.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh my&hellip;You&rsquo;re a Mumrik?&rdquo; Moominpappa asks, almost not believing. Snufkin slowly nods his head, and unwinds his tail to show Moominmamma and Pappa. &ldquo;Wow. Mumrik&rsquo;s are awfully rare, I guess that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;ve been hiding your tail.&rdquo; Pappa trailed off. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;And his paws, and his feet, and his fangs and ears. Mother made sure of that.&rdquo; My said, sipping her milk. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Why would Mymble have you hide your tail though? It&rsquo;s not that uncommon for the children of Mymble&rsquo;s to have similar features. Too-Ticky even has looks much like your own.&rdquo; Mamma ask. Snufkin shrugged and opened his mouth to reply, only to be cut off by Little My. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not because of that, it&rsquo;s because he looks so much like Joxter! Where we Mymble&rsquo;s are from, he&rsquo;s not looked fondly upon by the higher ups.&rdquo; She responded. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Mother would always say that the Joxter did things that some didn&rsquo;t like.&rdquo; Snufkin added on. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well I&rsquo;m not surprised. Joxaren is pretty big on speaking his mind most of the time. My, how much longer until your mother and Joxter should be here?&rdquo; Moominpappa asked as he casually handed Snufkin some of his memoirs and drafts that spoke of Joxter. Snufkin took the books and eagerly flipped through them, Moomin reading over his shoulders. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; My started. &ldquo;Mymble sent the letter about a week ago so I&rsquo;d assume any day now.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; Snufkin slapped the boom shut, causing Moomintroll to jump. &ldquo;Mymble sent a letter that long ago and I&rsquo;m just finding out about it?&rdquo; </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;You seemed busy. It didn&rsquo;t seem important to me.&rdquo; Little My shrugged. The boy took in a deep inhale and released it through his nose, and put his head in his hands. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;What am I going to do? What if he doesn&rsquo;t like me? And oh gosh I haven&rsquo;t seen Mother in years she&rsquo;s sure to yell at me. And what will the Joxter think once he finds out I&rsquo;ve been running from my problems rather than confronting them like a true Mumrik? Oh my gosh I don&rsquo;t know what to do.&rdquo; Snufkin groaned and plopped back against a wall. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Snufkin dear.&rdquo; Mamma&rsquo;s voice softly spoke. She pulled the boy into a large hug, which caused snicking to tense up. &ldquo;Whatever happens, we&rsquo;ll always be here for you.&rdquo; Snufkin stated still, trying to decide if he wanted to squirm his way out or just do nothing. Eventually, the boy melted into Moominmamma&rsquo;s touch and hugged her back. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Thank you Mamma.&rdquo; Snufkin whispered and purred slightly. Moominmamma nodded and released the boy, giving him a big grin. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to be afraid here. Ever.&rdquo;</p></p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n\n<h1>The Joxter&rsquo;s Son-4&amp;5</h1>\n<p class=\"npf_chat\" data-npf=\"{&quot;subtype&quot;:&quot;chat&quot;}\">Here you go my bad sorry</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Hey get back here!&rdquo; A large, booming voice yelled. A figure in a flowing green cloak and a bright red hat quickly ran by, dodging hands and tails trying to wrap around him. The figure let out a happy chuckle as he climbed up a tree, digging his sharp claws into the rough bark. The leaves ruffled as he made his way up, and he stole a glance behind him. </p>\n<p>His ears perked at voices, and listened as they disappeared down the footpath. The man&rsquo;s eyes narrowed in focus as he watched their bodies be lost in the horizon. He slowly and carefully climbed his way out of the tree, and let his feet softly touch the grass on ground. His hand wiped the beads of sweat off oh his forehead, and he crept back down the dirt road where he originally came. </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>He dug into his pocket, and pulled out a small silver chain with a emerald pendent on it. Admirably he held it in front of his eyes, and examined it. Those men who had been chasing him seemed to think it was important and worth value, so it was one of the first things he stole back from them. Getting it back to its owner was very important, and hopefully whatever importance it had could be kept away from the wrong hands. </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>He shoved the necklace back into his pocket, and glanced at the path forward. The sky fell dark, and stars were starting to paint the sky. Shadows cloaked his body, with only the lanterns of a nearby town illuminating his path. He glanced down toward the houses in front of him, and listened to the hushed voices around him. </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s him?&rdquo; A small boy asked. </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Joxter!&rdquo; Started a few Snorks. </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;Did he chase them off?&rdquo; Said the girl at the shop. </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>The Joxter huffed and rolled his eyes at the comments, and hurried his way toward a small oak door near the middle of the village. He ignored the panicked voices and knocked. In front of him, the door quickly swung open and revealed a small lady, whose golden hair was neatly tied up in a ponytail and had glasses more than likely too big for her face. Her eyes widened once she saw the Joxter&rsquo;s face, and she took his paws into her own. </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;Oh my goodness Joxter my dear friend! I heard the commotion, did you really chase of the Hattin&rsquo;s?&rdquo; The girl asked, causing Joxter&rsquo;s lips to press together. The Hattin&rsquo;s had apparently been causing chaos in this village for quite some time, and continued even more once Joxter had arrived. New visitors weren&rsquo;t very welcome to them, and they were really strict on rules. They told Joxter that he had a measly two hours to collect what he needed and leave. </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Naturally, Joxter wasn&rsquo;t too fond of the idea, and was quick to nod his head to not cause too much of a scene. Getting what he needed was the main importance at the moment, and he couldn&rsquo;t afford to gain more attention on himself than he already had. That was until he saw the supposed Hattin&rsquo;s robbing the residents of the village raw, stealing what they could and dismissing them. So Joxter did what any wise Joxter would do, he shoved what he assumed to be their leader and started a riot. </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>So now he was here, standing in front of the village&rsquo;s &lsquo;mayor&rsquo; who just so happened to be an old acquaintance, with a bunch of prying eyes on him. </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Joxaren started. &ldquo;They more so chased me out. But I&rsquo;m sure they won&rsquo;t come back after I was done with them.&rdquo; He let out a low chuckle and glanced downwards. The girl in front of him smiled and gave him a slight bow, which earned gasps from the lingering audience around them. She softly coughed and cleared her throat, then opened her mouth. </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;Everyone! From now on, we shan&rsquo;t live in fear, whether it be of the Hattin&rsquo;s gang, or of the misconceptions of the Joxter. Today, he is a hero, and you shall treat him as such.&rdquo; She beamed up at the Joxter, and looked back to crowd. &ldquo;Let is not listen to rumors or stories told by those we don&rsquo;t trust or know, and rather be grateful that a so called villain has saved someone yet again. For that I&rsquo;m forever thankful.&rdquo; </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>The crowed let out a few hips and horras, and cheered the Joxter on. Joxeran stood there bashfully, and nervously shuffled on both feet. Many mumbles and voices amongst the crowd were saying how &ldquo;Joxter&rsquo;s weren&rsquo;t that bad&rdquo; and &ldquo;we were wrong&rdquo;. Which the man silently laughed at, and would have rather that been the original assumption. The villages mayor patted the man on the back and turned back into the house.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;Oh umm, my friend. I retrieved most of the stuff they took. Would you like it back?&rdquo; Joxter asked, and he started to hold out some of his pockets contents. The girl&rsquo;s eyes shimmered once more with gratefulness and thanks, as she grabbed a small bucket to dump the stolen belongings in. Joxter&rsquo;s hand, however, paused once he got to the necklace, and he examined it once more. </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;You can keep that one, as an award. You seem very fond of it.&rdquo; Joxter looked at the girl in front of him and smiled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking someone in your life would love it as a gift.&rdquo; The man did nothing but give a slight nod, and pocketed it once more. After he was done returning the stolen items, he gave the mayor once last tip of his hat and went off his way. His hand hovered over the pocket with the necklace and his thoughts drifted elsewhere. </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Maybe it was time he gifted an old love with a visit. </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n\n</p>",
