Tony can tell in the way his eyes are darting from right to left constantly, and the mile wide smile on his face hasn\u2019t left since they arrived at the hotel.</p><p>Bruce also keeps staring over to watch Tony, which would be uncomfortable if he wasn\u2019t used to it and it didn\u2019t make Tony want to kiss him a lot. </p><p>\u201cYou never been to one of these before?\u201d Tony asks, flopping down to lie on the bed that is kind of far too big.</p><p>Bruce shrugs. \u201cI\u2019ve been invited to them, but I\u2019ve never had the money for transport or hotels. So, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been invited? What for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Bruce asks, \u201cI am kind of a scientist, you know.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat sciencey things, then?\u201d Tony asks, reaching out a hand to pull at Bruce\u2019s shirt and tug him onto the bed too.</p><p>\u201cGamma research, I guess. I am a leading expert. And some of the stuff Betty and I did caught the attention of the big fish every now and then. Betty went to a few conventions. There\u2019s probably videos of her talks online, if you wanted to watch them,\u201d Bruce says, curling next to Tony on the bed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather watch yours,\u201d Tony says. \u201cSpeaking of, you nervous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Tony knows that\u2019s Bruce-speak for \u2018a lot, but I don\u2019t want to admit it in front of you\u2019.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll go fine,\u201d Tony tells him. \u201cAnd if you run off in tears, I\u2019ll go up for you and finish the talk.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cThanks for the vote of confidence, baby,\u201d Bruce mutters. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p><p>Tony chuckles, clicking his phone on. The light of his lockscreen (which is a photo of Peter and Bruce bent over a sparking experiment in his lab) bathes both of them in light. \u201cFive past midnight. You going to sleep now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmh,\u201d Bruce says. \u201cSet an alarm for half eight, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it,\u201d Tony says, flicking through his apps for a second, sending a text to Pepper (<i>We\u2019ve arrived in one piece. How\u2019s the company doing without me?</i>) and another to Peter (<i>Wish you were here! </i>with a photo of the building the convention is being held in) before setting an alarm up.</p><p>He reads Pepper\u2019s reply (<i>Don\u2019t text me yet. You haven\u2019t been gone long enough for me to miss you. Company is doing absolutely fine without you. Same as always. Xx.</i>), and grins before turning his phone off and cuddling up next to Bruce, who makes an affronted murmur before settling into Tony\u2019s arms.</p><p>-<br/>-<br/>-</p><p>Bruce wakes up five minutes before the alarm (like he always does) and turns it off before it wakes Tony up (like he always does) before waking Tony up himself with soft kiss on his forehead (like he always does).</p><p>At least Bruce\u2019s schedule doesn\u2019t change whenever they go overseas. Tony\u2019s does, because he wakes up, grunts, and slides out of bed till he\u2019s lying on the floor instead.</p><p>Bruce dumps a silvery grey button up shirt on his stomach and a pair of black jeans and then stops in the open kitchen to figure out the coffee machine. Which ends up making subpar coffee, so Tony gets dressed and calls room service instead.</p><p>Bruce rolls his eyes at him, before shoving Tony\u2019s toothbrush in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cIs that my toothbrush?\u201d Tony asks.</p><p>Bruce shrugs. \u201cProbably. You can use mine if you want to balance it out,\u201d he says around a mouthful of toothpaste. \u201cWe need to be in Hall E by nine thirty, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Tony confirms, leafing through the admission papers on the coffee table. \u201cYou\u2019ll be starting your talk about ten, it\u2019ll last an hour to two hours, and then we\u2019ll go look at the projects and throw money at people.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not throwing money at people,\u201d Bruce says, \u201cWe\u2019ll politely ask if they need any more funding for their project and then offer to pay for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame difference,\u201d Tony says, swallowing the dregs of the Good Coffee, and then grimacing and choking back the Not Good Coffee too. </p><p>\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t like the other coffee?\u201d Bruce asks.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Tony says, picking up Bruce\u2019s toothbrush.</p><p>Bruce just hums, picking up Tony\u2019s mugs and putting them in the sink. Then he starts packing up a backpack with his laptop, a notebook, a flashdrive, the admission papers, and both his and Tony\u2019s phones.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not talking till tomorrow, right?\u201d Bruce asks.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Tony agrees. \u201cHey, do you wanna go out tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we were going to anyway,\u201d Bruce says.</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to exploit my money?\u201d Tony demands, hand on hips.</p><p>Bruce laughs. \u201cNot at all. I just thought, since there\u2019s no food in here, and you hate cooking, we\u2019d be going to a restaurant anyway.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cToo smart for your own good,\u201d Tony declares.</p><p>Bruce smiles at him. \u201cPot, meet kettle.\u201d</p><p>Tony tries to side-eye him, but can\u2019t keep the grin off of his face for very long at all.</p><p>\u201cCome on, then. You ready?\u201d Bruce asks.</p><p>Tony nods. \u201cYeah. Are you?\u201d</p><p>Bruce opens his mouth to say something before stopping abruptly. \u201cI- think so.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s heart does a melty thing and he\u2019s across the room to hug Bruce before he can even register moving. \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine. You\u2019re smart and clever and hot as shit. You\u2019ll wow every single person in that room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just nervous,\u201d Bruce says. \u201cHow do you do these things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPractice,\u201d Tony admits. \u201cThey were force fed to me on a silver spoon.\u201d</p><p>Bruce huffs what sounds like a laugh. \u201cI\u2019ve never even seen a silver spoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can get you some, if you want. Solid silver spoons,\u201d Tony says.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need solid silver spoons,\u201d Bruce says, pushing up onto his tiptoes to bump his forehead on Tony\u2019s. \u201cLet\u2019s go. This talk isn\u2019t going to talk itself.\u201d</p><p>Tony grins. \u201cThat\u2019s the spirit.\u201d He plants a kiss on Bruce\u2019s lips before tugging away to race out of the door before him.</p><p>\u201cTony!\u201d Bruce yells after him, reaching over to snag the backpack and the keycard, before running after Tony.</p><p>They probably wake up everyone else on their floor, and the one under theirs too, and by the time they reach breakfast hall and Tony slips in to bag another cup of coffee, they\u2019re both out of breath and two minutes late. But it\u2019s okay.</p><p>-<br/>-<br/>-</p><p>Bruce turns up to the actual talk with slightly red cheeks and curlier hair than when he started. Thankfully, the moderators don\u2019t mention it. Tony isn\u2019t allowed backstage with him, so he says, \u201cYou\u2019ll do great,\u201d and, \u201cKiss for good luck?\u201d Before pulling Bruce into a kiss that is entirely too indecent for the backstage area at a science convention, surrounded by people in black shirts with yellow logos.</p><p>Tony grins, wiggles his fingers in a wave and disappears into the crowd. Bruce tries to keep his eye on him, but there\u2019s far too many people milling around. The thought that they\u2019re all for him makes his heart jump into his throat.</p><p>The announcer&rsquo;s voice makes him jump. \u201cDoctor Bruce Banner, expert in gamma radiation, nuclear physics, and biochemistry, here to discuss his experience with gamma particles.\u201d</p><p>-<br/>-<br/>-</p><p>Bruce\u2019s name has just been announced when the guy next to Tony scoffs under his breath. He tries to ignore it, because there\u2019s Bruce looking small and scared and overwhelmed all at once and then a lot more relaxed when Tony winks at him.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Bruce says, eyes darting around nervously. He opens his laptop up. \u201cI\u2019m, uh, Bruce Banner. Obviously. And I\u2019m here to talk about gamma radiation. As one of the world\u2019s leading experts. Which is a title I don\u2019t actually think I\u2019ve earned,\u201d Bruce shrugs, typing in his password. \u201cAfter all, all I did was mess around with gamma rays and had a less than pleasurable outcome.\u201d</p><p>That gets a few laughs, and Tony can see it relaxes Bruce a little. </p><p>\u201c\u201dSo, I guess before we start, I absolutely do not think you should try any gamma experimentation at home. Look how the turned out for me,\u201d Bruce says. He lets the Hulk bleed through enough to colour his fingertip green (Tony\u2019s heart swells when he remembers how much trouble Bruce had getting the Other Guy under control enough to do that).</p><p>Everyone in the hall gasps, though, including the two men sitting next to Tony. One of whom whispers to his friend, \u201cIrresponsible. What were they thinking, letting that guy up there? Should be Stark up there.\u201d</p><p>Tony breathes once, twice, curls his hand into a fist, and tries not to punch them. </p><p>Bruce doesn\u2019t notice, focused on setting up his slideshow. \u201c-I studied gamma a lot with my ex, Betty Ross.

Tony can tell in the way his eyes are darting from right to left constantly, and the mile wide smile on his face hasn\u2019t left since they arrived at the hotel.</p><p>Bruce also keeps staring over to watch Tony, which would be uncomfortable if he wasn\u2019t used to it and it didn\u2019t make Tony want to kiss him a lot. </p><p>\u201cYou never been to one of these before?\u201d Tony asks, flopping down to lie on the bed that is kind of far too big.</p><p>Bruce shrugs. \u201cI\u2019ve been invited to them, but I\u2019ve never had the money for transport or hotels. So, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been invited? What for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Bruce asks, \u201cI am kind of a scientist, you know.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhat sciencey things, then?\u201d Tony asks, reaching out a hand to pull at Bruce\u2019s shirt and tug him onto the bed too.</p><p>\u201cGamma research, I guess. I am a leading expert. And some of the stuff Betty and I did caught the attention of the big fish every now and then. Betty went to a few conventions. There\u2019s probably videos of her talks online, if you wanted to watch them,\u201d Bruce says, curling next to Tony on the bed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather watch yours,\u201d Tony says. \u201cSpeaking of, you nervous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Tony knows that\u2019s Bruce-speak for \u2018a lot, but I don\u2019t want to admit it in front of you\u2019.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll go fine,\u201d Tony tells him. \u201cAnd if you run off in tears, I\u2019ll go up for you and finish the talk.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThanks for the vote of confidence, baby,\u201d Bruce mutters. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p><p>Tony chuckles, clicking his phone on. The light of his lockscreen (which is a photo of Peter and Bruce bent over a sparking experiment in his lab) bathes both of them in light. \u201cFive past midnight. You going to sleep now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmh,\u201d Bruce says. \u201cSet an alarm for half eight, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it,\u201d Tony says, flicking through his apps for a second, sending a text to Pepper (<i>We\u2019ve arrived in one piece. How\u2019s the company doing without me?</i>) and another to Peter (<i>Wish you were here! </i>with a photo of the building the convention is being held in) before setting an alarm up.</p><p>He reads Pepper\u2019s reply (<i>Don\u2019t text me yet. You haven\u2019t been gone long enough for me to miss you. Company is doing absolutely fine without you. Same as always. Xx.</i>), and grins before turning his phone off and cuddling up next to Bruce, who makes an affronted murmur before settling into Tony\u2019s arms.</p><p>-<br>-<br>-</p><p>Bruce wakes up five minutes before the alarm (like he always does) and turns it off before it wakes Tony up (like he always does) before waking Tony up himself with soft kiss on his forehead (like he always does).</p><p>At least Bruce\u2019s schedule doesn\u2019t change whenever they go overseas. Tony\u2019s does, because he wakes up, grunts, and slides out of bed till he\u2019s lying on the floor instead.</p><p>Bruce dumps a silvery grey button up shirt on his stomach and a pair of black jeans and then stops in the open kitchen to figure out the coffee machine. Which ends up making subpar coffee, so Tony gets dressed and calls room service instead.</p><p>Bruce rolls his eyes at him, before shoving Tony\u2019s toothbrush in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cIs that my toothbrush?\u201d Tony asks.</p><p>Bruce shrugs. \u201cProbably. You can use mine if you want to balance it out,\u201d he says around a mouthful of toothpaste. \u201cWe need to be in Hall E by nine thirty, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Tony confirms, leafing through the admission papers on the coffee table. \u201cYou\u2019ll be starting your talk about ten, it\u2019ll last an hour to two hours, and then we\u2019ll go look at the projects and throw money at people.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not throwing money at people,\u201d Bruce says, \u201cWe\u2019ll politely ask if they need any more funding for their project and then offer to pay for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame difference,\u201d Tony says, swallowing the dregs of the Good Coffee, and then grimacing and choking back the Not Good Coffee too. </p><p>\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t like the other coffee?\u201d Bruce asks.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Tony says, picking up Bruce\u2019s toothbrush.</p><p>Bruce just hums, picking up Tony\u2019s mugs and putting them in the sink. Then he starts packing up a backpack with his laptop, a notebook, a flashdrive, the admission papers, and both his and Tony\u2019s phones.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not talking till tomorrow, right?\u201d Bruce asks.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Tony agrees. \u201cHey, do you wanna go out tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we were going to anyway,\u201d Bruce says.</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to exploit my money?\u201d Tony demands, hand on hips.</p><p>Bruce laughs. \u201cNot at all. I just thought, since there\u2019s no food in here, and you hate cooking, we\u2019d be going to a restaurant anyway.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cToo smart for your own good,\u201d Tony declares.</p><p>Bruce smiles at him. \u201cPot, meet kettle.\u201d</p><p>Tony tries to side-eye him, but can\u2019t keep the grin off of his face for very long at all.</p><p>\u201cCome on, then. You ready?\u201d Bruce asks.</p><p>Tony nods. \u201cYeah. Are you?\u201d</p><p>Bruce opens his mouth to say something before stopping abruptly. \u201cI- think so.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s heart does a melty thing and he\u2019s across the room to hug Bruce before he can even register moving. \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine. You\u2019re smart and clever and hot as shit. You\u2019ll wow every single person in that room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just nervous,\u201d Bruce says. \u201cHow do you do these things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPractice,\u201d Tony admits. \u201cThey were force fed to me on a silver spoon.\u201d</p><p>Bruce huffs what sounds like a laugh. \u201cI\u2019ve never even seen a silver spoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can get you some, if you want. Solid silver spoons,\u201d Tony says.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need solid silver spoons,\u201d Bruce says, pushing up onto his tiptoes to bump his forehead on Tony\u2019s. \u201cLet\u2019s go. This talk isn\u2019t going to talk itself.\u201d</p><p>Tony grins. \u201cThat\u2019s the spirit.\u201d He plants a kiss on Bruce\u2019s lips before tugging away to race out of the door before him.</p><p>\u201cTony!\u201d Bruce yells after him, reaching over to snag the backpack and the keycard, before running after Tony.</p><p>They probably wake up everyone else on their floor, and the one under theirs too, and by the time they reach breakfast hall and Tony slips in to bag another cup of coffee, they\u2019re both out of breath and two minutes late. But it\u2019s okay.</p><p>-<br>-<br>-</p><p>Bruce turns up to the actual talk with slightly red cheeks and curlier hair than when he started. Thankfully, the moderators don\u2019t mention it. Tony isn\u2019t allowed backstage with him, so he says, \u201cYou\u2019ll do great,\u201d and, \u201cKiss for good luck?\u201d Before pulling Bruce into a kiss that is entirely too indecent for the backstage area at a science convention, surrounded by people in black shirts with yellow logos.</p><p>Tony grins, wiggles his fingers in a wave and disappears into the crowd. Bruce tries to keep his eye on him, but there\u2019s far too many people milling around. The thought that they\u2019re all for him makes his heart jump into his throat.</p><p>The announcer\u2019s voice makes him jump. \u201cDoctor Bruce Banner, expert in gamma radiation, nuclear physics, and biochemistry, here to discuss his experience with gamma particles.\u201d</p><p>-<br>-<br>-</p><p>Bruce\u2019s name has just been announced when the guy next to Tony scoffs under his breath. He tries to ignore it, because there\u2019s Bruce looking small and scared and overwhelmed all at once and then a lot more relaxed when Tony winks at him.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Bruce says, eyes darting around nervously. He opens his laptop up. \u201cI\u2019m, uh, Bruce Banner. Obviously. And I\u2019m here to talk about gamma radiation. As one of the world\u2019s leading experts. Which is a title I don\u2019t actually think I\u2019ve earned,\u201d Bruce shrugs, typing in his password. \u201cAfter all, all I did was mess around with gamma rays and had a less than pleasurable outcome.\u201d</p><p>That gets a few laughs, and Tony can see it relaxes Bruce a little. </p><p>\u201c\u201dSo, I guess before we start, I absolutely do not think you should try any gamma experimentation at home. Look how the turned out for me,\u201d Bruce says. He lets the Hulk bleed through enough to colour his fingertip green (Tony\u2019s heart swells when he remembers how much trouble Bruce had getting the Other Guy under control enough to do that).</p><p>Everyone in the hall gasps, though, including the two men sitting next to Tony. One of whom whispers to his friend, \u201cIrresponsible. What were they thinking, letting that guy up there? Should be Stark up there.\u201d</p><p>Tony breathes once, twice, curls his hand into a fist, and tries not to punch them. </p><p>Bruce doesn\u2019t notice, focused on setting up his slideshow. \u201c-I studied gamma a lot with my ex, Betty Ross. Some of you more dedicated fans might even have seen some of her talks. She started coming to these a lot sooner than I did.\u201d</p><p>The guy next to Tony snorts again. \u201cDumped his ex, now he\u2019s a fag, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStupid one at that,\u201d the other dude mutters back, grinning.</p><p>Tony breathes five times this time, pulls out his phone, and texts Pepper.</p><blockquote><p><i>How bad would the backlash be if I knocked two guys out?

Tony can tell in the way his eyes are darting from right to left constantly, and the mile wide smile on his face hasn\u2019t left since they arrived at the hotel.</p><p>Bruce also keeps staring over to watch Tony, which would be uncomfortable if he wasn\u2019t used to it and it didn\u2019t make Tony want to kiss him a lot. </p><p>\u201cYou never been to one of these before?\u201d Tony asks, flopping down to lie on the bed that is kind of far too big.</p><p>Bruce shrugs. \u201cI\u2019ve been invited to them, but I\u2019ve never had the money for transport or hotels. So, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been invited? What for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Bruce asks, \u201cI am kind of a scientist, you know.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhat sciencey things, then?\u201d Tony asks, reaching out a hand to pull at Bruce\u2019s shirt and tug him onto the bed too.</p><p>\u201cGamma research, I guess. I am a leading expert. And some of the stuff Betty and I did caught the attention of the big fish every now and then. Betty went to a few conventions. There\u2019s probably videos of her talks online, if you wanted to watch them,\u201d Bruce says, curling next to Tony on the bed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather watch yours,\u201d Tony says. \u201cSpeaking of, you nervous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Tony knows that\u2019s Bruce-speak for \u2018a lot, but I don\u2019t want to admit it in front of you\u2019.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll go fine,\u201d Tony tells him. \u201cAnd if you run off in tears, I\u2019ll go up for you and finish the talk.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThanks for the vote of confidence, baby,\u201d Bruce mutters. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p><p>Tony chuckles, clicking his phone on. The light of his lockscreen (which is a photo of Peter and Bruce bent over a sparking experiment in his lab) bathes both of them in light. \u201cFive past midnight. You going to sleep now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmh,\u201d Bruce says. \u201cSet an alarm for half eight, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it,\u201d Tony says, flicking through his apps for a second, sending a text to Pepper (<i>We\u2019ve arrived in one piece. How\u2019s the company doing without me?</i>) and another to Peter (<i>Wish you were here! </i>with a photo of the building the convention is being held in) before setting an alarm up.</p><p>He reads Pepper\u2019s reply (<i>Don\u2019t text me yet. You haven\u2019t been gone long enough for me to miss you. Company is doing absolutely fine without you. Same as always. Xx.</i>), and grins before turning his phone off and cuddling up next to Bruce, who makes an affronted murmur before settling into Tony\u2019s arms.</p><p>-<br>-<br>-</p><p>Bruce wakes up five minutes before the alarm (like he always does) and turns it off before it wakes Tony up (like he always does) before waking Tony up himself with soft kiss on his forehead (like he always does).</p><p>At least Bruce\u2019s schedule doesn\u2019t change whenever they go overseas. Tony\u2019s does, because he wakes up, grunts, and slides out of bed till he\u2019s lying on the floor instead.</p><p>Bruce dumps a silvery grey button up shirt on his stomach and a pair of black jeans and then stops in the open kitchen to figure out the coffee machine. Which ends up making subpar coffee, so Tony gets dressed and calls room service instead.</p><p>Bruce rolls his eyes at him, before shoving Tony\u2019s toothbrush in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cIs that my toothbrush?\u201d Tony asks.</p><p>Bruce shrugs. \u201cProbably. You can use mine if you want to balance it out,\u201d he says around a mouthful of toothpaste. \u201cWe need to be in Hall E by nine thirty, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Tony confirms, leafing through the admission papers on the coffee table. \u201cYou\u2019ll be starting your talk about ten, it\u2019ll last an hour to two hours, and then we\u2019ll go look at the projects and throw money at people.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not throwing money at people,\u201d Bruce says, \u201cWe\u2019ll politely ask if they need any more funding for their project and then offer to pay for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame difference,\u201d Tony says, swallowing the dregs of the Good Coffee, and then grimacing and choking back the Not Good Coffee too. </p><p>\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t like the other coffee?\u201d Bruce asks.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Tony says, picking up Bruce\u2019s toothbrush.</p><p>Bruce just hums, picking up Tony\u2019s mugs and putting them in the sink. Then he starts packing up a backpack with his laptop, a notebook, a flashdrive, the admission papers, and both his and Tony\u2019s phones.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not talking till tomorrow, right?\u201d Bruce asks.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Tony agrees. \u201cHey, do you wanna go out tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we were going to anyway,\u201d Bruce says.</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to exploit my money?\u201d Tony demands, hand on hips.</p><p>Bruce laughs. \u201cNot at all. I just thought, since there\u2019s no food in here, and you hate cooking, we\u2019d be going to a restaurant anyway.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cToo smart for your own good,\u201d Tony declares.</p><p>Bruce smiles at him. \u201cPot, meet kettle.\u201d</p><p>Tony tries to side-eye him, but can\u2019t keep the grin off of his face for very long at all.</p><p>\u201cCome on, then. You ready?\u201d Bruce asks.</p><p>Tony nods. \u201cYeah. Are you?\u201d</p><p>Bruce opens his mouth to say something before stopping abruptly. \u201cI- think so.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s heart does a melty thing and he\u2019s across the room to hug Bruce before he can even register moving. \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine. You\u2019re smart and clever and hot as shit. You\u2019ll wow every single person in that room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just nervous,\u201d Bruce says. \u201cHow do you do these things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPractice,\u201d Tony admits. \u201cThey were force fed to me on a silver spoon.\u201d</p><p>Bruce huffs what sounds like a laugh. \u201cI\u2019ve never even seen a silver spoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can get you some, if you want. Solid silver spoons,\u201d Tony says.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need solid silver spoons,\u201d Bruce says, pushing up onto his tiptoes to bump his forehead on Tony\u2019s. \u201cLet\u2019s go. This talk isn\u2019t going to talk itself.\u201d</p><p>Tony grins. \u201cThat\u2019s the spirit.\u201d He plants a kiss on Bruce\u2019s lips before tugging away to race out of the door before him.</p><p>\u201cTony!\u201d Bruce yells after him, reaching over to snag the backpack and the keycard, before running after Tony.</p><p>They probably wake up everyone else on their floor, and the one under theirs too, and by the time they reach breakfast hall and Tony slips in to bag another cup of coffee, they\u2019re both out of breath and two minutes late. But it\u2019s okay.</p><p>-<br>-<br>-</p><p>Bruce turns up to the actual talk with slightly red cheeks and curlier hair than when he started. Thankfully, the moderators don\u2019t mention it. Tony isn\u2019t allowed backstage with him, so he says, \u201cYou\u2019ll do great,\u201d and, \u201cKiss for good luck?\u201d Before pulling Bruce into a kiss that is entirely too indecent for the backstage area at a science convention, surrounded by people in black shirts with yellow logos.</p><p>Tony grins, wiggles his fingers in a wave and disappears into the crowd. Bruce tries to keep his eye on him, but there\u2019s far too many people milling around. The thought that they\u2019re all for him makes his heart jump into his throat.</p><p>The announcer\u2019s voice makes him jump. \u201cDoctor Bruce Banner, expert in gamma radiation, nuclear physics, and biochemistry, here to discuss his experience with gamma particles.\u201d</p><p>-<br>-<br>-</p><p>Bruce\u2019s name has just been announced when the guy next to Tony scoffs under his breath. He tries to ignore it, because there\u2019s Bruce looking small and scared and overwhelmed all at once and then a lot more relaxed when Tony winks at him.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Bruce says, eyes darting around nervously. He opens his laptop up. \u201cI\u2019m, uh, Bruce Banner. Obviously. And I\u2019m here to talk about gamma radiation. As one of the world\u2019s leading experts. Which is a title I don\u2019t actually think I\u2019ve earned,\u201d Bruce shrugs, typing in his password. \u201cAfter all, all I did was mess around with gamma rays and had a less than pleasurable outcome.\u201d</p><p>That gets a few laughs, and Tony can see it relaxes Bruce a little. </p><p>\u201c\u201dSo, I guess before we start, I absolutely do not think you should try any gamma experimentation at home. Look how the turned out for me,\u201d Bruce says. He lets the Hulk bleed through enough to colour his fingertip green (Tony\u2019s heart swells when he remembers how much trouble Bruce had getting the Other Guy under control enough to do that).</p><p>Everyone in the hall gasps, though, including the two men sitting next to Tony. One of whom whispers to his friend, \u201cIrresponsible. What were they thinking, letting that guy up there? Should be Stark up there.\u201d</p><p>Tony breathes once, twice, curls his hand into a fist, and tries not to punch them. </p><p>Bruce doesn\u2019t notice, focused on setting up his slideshow. \u201c-I studied gamma a lot with my ex, Betty Ross. Some of you more dedicated fans might even have seen some of her talks. She started coming to these a lot sooner than I did.\u201d</p><p>The guy next to Tony snorts again. \u201cDumped his ex, now he\u2019s a fag, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStupid one at that,\u201d the other dude mutters back, grinning.</p><p>Tony breathes five times this time, pulls out his phone, and texts Pepper.</p><blockquote><p><i>How bad would the backlash be if I knocked two guys out? TS</i></p></blockquote><p><i>How knocked out are we talking? Xx</i></p><blockquote><p><i>Like, broken noses at least. TS</i></p></blockquote><p><i>I\u2019ll look into it. Why? Xx</i></p><blockquote><p><i>Sitting next to the most assholish people I\u2019ve ever met. Even worse than Hammer. TS</i></p></blockquote><p><i>Christ. What are they doing? Xx</i></p><blockquote><p><i>Insulting Bruce during his talk. TS</i></p></blockquote><p><i>Hm. Go crazy. I\u2019ll handle it. Xx</i></p><blockquote><p><i>Did I ever tell you how much I love you? TS</i></p></blockquote><p><i>You can tell me in the new Versace bag. Xx</i></p><blockquote><p><i>You got it. TS</i></p></blockquote><p>God, he loves her. Bruce has moved onto talking about the applications for gamma radiation in modern medicine, and looks thoroughly distracted by the rest of the audience and his laptop. So Tony pulls his Emergency Recognition Cap over his head and nudges the guy next to him gently.</p><p>Dipping into his more Californian accent, the one he picked up back when he lived in Malibu and then learnt how to do consistently, he says, \u201cGod, what a dumbass, right?\u201d</p><p>Thankfully, the guy doesn\u2019t turn to look at him, instead just saying. \u201cSo fucking stupid. Shame its not Stark up there.\u201d</p><p>Tony represses the thank you and instead chuckles. \u201cRight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf only I didn\u2019t only date smart chicks,\u201d the guys friend says, \u201cI bet he\u2019s a good bang.\u201d</p><p>Tony bites his tongue, hard. \u201cShame you\u2019ll never get there while I\u2019m here, then, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He says, pulling the cap off and glaring up. Both of them look surprised, and under different circumstances, Tony would find it kind of amusing. As it is, he grins and jabs a sharp uppercut into the first guys nose, and it breaks instantly. (Thank you, Mom, for enrolling him in karate classes after his first kidnapping.)</p><p>The guy screeches, which draws the attention of practically everyone in the room. Except the security guards. Count your blessings, Tony supposes, because he manages to knock the second guy out with one well aimed punch and then push the first one to the floor and trap him there.</p><p>He also manages to get the words, \u201cHe is smarter than you will ever be, then I will ever be, and he is not there for you to ridicule or joke about.\u201d</p><p>The guy makes a strangled choking noise and then security starts pulling Tony off of him. He manages to yell out, \u201cSay hello to my lawyers, asshole!\u201d Before the handcuffs snap on and he gets taken to the security booths.</p><p>-<br>-<br>-</p><p>\u201cWhat,\u201d Bruce says, an hour later, once he\u2019s managed to sneak in and pick the lock to Tony\u2019s impromptu cell (which is actually just an unused office with an outside lock), \u201cThe fuck was all that about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had permission from Pepper,\u201d Tony leads with. \u201cAny chance you could get me out of these?\u201d</p><p>Bruce sighs, glancing back at the door and then at Tony\u2019s handcuffed wrists. He pulls out the pin he must have used on the door and reaches over to fiddle with the cuffs. \u201cI cannot believe you did that. What came over you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore you get all mad,\u201d Tony says, \u201cWhich I realise is pretty justified given this whole situation. Just hear me out first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBenefit of the doubt,\u201d Bruce agrees, setting the cuffs on the floor and curling his fingers over Tony\u2019s wrist, rubbing the slightly raw marks.</p><p>\u201cOkay, well, the guys I was sitting next to were being really rude about you and us. And so I pretended to be, well, not me, asked Pepper first, and knocked them out,\u201d Tony says.</p><p>\u201cWhat were they saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, that you were stupid, and I would have been better, and also that you were a fag, and something that could probably count as sexual harassment, if I\u2019m honest,\u201d Tony shrugs. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to ruin your talk, and I\u2019m really sorry. But I couldn\u2019t just sit there and let them say that!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Bruce sighs. \u201cApology accepted. Can you get your jet flown here now, or will we have to wait till tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do yo- They\u2019re not kicking us out, are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony, you just knocked out two guests. They\u2019re kicking us out for a little bit, yes. We might be welcomed back next year.\u201d</p><p>Tony huffs. \u201cOkay. I\u2019m sorry, baby.\u201d</p><p>Bruce smiles with the corners of his mouth and holds a hand out for Tony to grab. \u201cI know. If we don\u2019t get accepted next year, we could throw our own science fair.\u201d</p><p>(Usually when Tony\u2019s eyes light up like that, it never means anything good).</p><p>\u201cLets focus on getting home first,\u201d Bruce adds hurriedly. \u201cDeal with the press storm I\u2019m sure this has whirled up. Buy Pepper a monster box of chocolates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be fine with it. She was in favour, actually,\u201d Tony says, \u201cCome on.

Tony can tell in the way his eyes are darting from right to left constantly, and the mile wide smile on his face hasn&rsquo;t left since they arrived at the hotel.</p><p>Bruce also keeps staring over to watch Tony, which would be uncomfortable if he wasn&rsquo;t used to it and it didn&rsquo;t make Tony want to kiss him a lot. </p><p>&ldquo;You never been to one of these before?&rdquo; Tony asks, flopping down to lie on the bed that is kind of far too big.</p><p>Bruce shrugs. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been invited to them, but I&rsquo;ve never had the money for transport or hotels. So, no.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been invited? What for?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo; Bruce asks, &ldquo;I am kind of a scientist, you know.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What sciencey things, then?&rdquo; Tony asks, reaching out a hand to pull at Bruce&rsquo;s shirt and tug him onto the bed too.</p><p>&ldquo;Gamma research, I guess. I am a leading expert. And some of the stuff Betty and I did caught the attention of the big fish every now and then. Betty went to a few conventions. There&rsquo;s probably videos of her talks online, if you wanted to watch them,&rdquo; Bruce says, curling next to Tony on the bed.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather watch yours,&rdquo; Tony says. &ldquo;Speaking of, you nervous?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A little, I guess.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony knows that&rsquo;s Bruce-speak for &lsquo;a lot, but I don&rsquo;t want to admit it in front of you&rsquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll go fine,&rdquo; Tony tells him. &ldquo;And if you run off in tears, I&rsquo;ll go up for you and finish the talk.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Thanks for the vote of confidence, baby,&rdquo; Bruce mutters. &ldquo;What time is it?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony chuckles, clicking his phone on. The light of his lockscreen (which is a photo of Peter and Bruce bent over a sparking experiment in his lab) bathes both of them in light. &ldquo;Five past midnight. You going to sleep now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mmh,&rdquo; Bruce says. &ldquo;Set an alarm for half eight, will you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You got it,&rdquo; Tony says, flicking through his apps for a second, sending a text to Pepper (<i>We&rsquo;ve arrived in one piece. How&rsquo;s the company doing without me?</i>) and another to Peter (<i>Wish you were here! </i>with a photo of the building the convention is being held in) before setting an alarm up.</p><p>He reads Pepper&rsquo;s reply (<i>Don&rsquo;t text me yet. You haven&rsquo;t been gone long enough for me to miss you. Company is doing absolutely fine without you. Same as always. Xx.</i>), and grins before turning his phone off and cuddling up next to Bruce, who makes an affronted murmur before settling into Tony&rsquo;s arms.</p><p>-<br />-<br />-</p><p>Bruce wakes up five minutes before the alarm (like he always does) and turns it off before it wakes Tony up (like he always does) before waking Tony up himself with soft kiss on his forehead (like he always does).</p><p>At least Bruce&rsquo;s schedule doesn&rsquo;t change whenever they go overseas. Tony&rsquo;s does, because he wakes up, grunts, and slides out of bed till he&rsquo;s lying on the floor instead.</p><p>Bruce dumps a silvery grey button up shirt on his stomach and a pair of black jeans and then stops in the open kitchen to figure out the coffee machine. Which ends up making subpar coffee, so Tony gets dressed and calls room service instead.</p><p>Bruce rolls his eyes at him, before shoving Tony&rsquo;s toothbrush in his mouth.</p><p>&ldquo;Is that my toothbrush?&rdquo; Tony asks.</p><p>Bruce shrugs. &ldquo;Probably. You can use mine if you want to balance it out,&rdquo; he says around a mouthful of toothpaste. &ldquo;We need to be in Hall E by nine thirty, right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Tony confirms, leafing through the admission papers on the coffee table. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be starting your talk about ten, it&rsquo;ll last an hour to two hours, and then we&rsquo;ll go look at the projects and throw money at people.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not throwing money at people,&rdquo; Bruce says, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll politely ask if they need any more funding for their project and then offer to pay for it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Same difference,&rdquo; Tony says, swallowing the dregs of the Good Coffee, and then grimacing and choking back the Not Good Coffee too. </p><p>&ldquo;I thought you didn&rsquo;t like the other coffee?&rdquo; Bruce asks.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Tony says, picking up Bruce&rsquo;s toothbrush.</p><p>Bruce just hums, picking up Tony&rsquo;s mugs and putting them in the sink. Then he starts packing up a backpack with his laptop, a notebook, a flashdrive, the admission papers, and both his and Tony&rsquo;s phones.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not talking till tomorrow, right?&rdquo; Bruce asks.</p><p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Tony agrees. &ldquo;Hey, do you wanna go out tonight?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I thought we were going to anyway,&rdquo; Bruce says.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you trying to exploit my money?&rdquo; Tony demands, hand on hips.</p><p>Bruce laughs. &ldquo;Not at all. I just thought, since there&rsquo;s no food in here, and you hate cooking, we&rsquo;d be going to a restaurant anyway.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Too smart for your own good,&rdquo; Tony declares.</p><p>Bruce smiles at him. &ldquo;Pot, meet kettle.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony tries to side-eye him, but can&rsquo;t keep the grin off of his face for very long at all.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, then. You ready?&rdquo; Bruce asks.</p><p>Tony nods. &ldquo;Yeah. Are you?&rdquo;</p><p>Bruce opens his mouth to say something before stopping abruptly. &ldquo;I- think so.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s heart does a melty thing and he&rsquo;s across the room to hug Bruce before he can even register moving. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be fine. You&rsquo;re smart and clever and hot as shit. You&rsquo;ll wow every single person in that room.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just nervous,&rdquo; Bruce says. &ldquo;How do you do these things?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Practice,&rdquo; Tony admits. &ldquo;They were force fed to me on a silver spoon.&rdquo;</p><p>Bruce huffs what sounds like a laugh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never even seen a silver spoon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can get you some, if you want. Solid silver spoons,&rdquo; Tony says.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need solid silver spoons,&rdquo; Bruce says, pushing up onto his tiptoes to bump his forehead on Tony&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go. This talk isn&rsquo;t going to talk itself.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony grins. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the spirit.&rdquo; He plants a kiss on Bruce&rsquo;s lips before tugging away to race out of the door before him.</p><p>&ldquo;Tony!&rdquo; Bruce yells after him, reaching over to snag the backpack and the keycard, before running after Tony.</p><p>They probably wake up everyone else on their floor, and the one under theirs too, and by the time they reach breakfast hall and Tony slips in to bag another cup of coffee, they&rsquo;re both out of breath and two minutes late. But it&rsquo;s okay.</p><p>-<br />-<br />-</p><p>Bruce turns up to the actual talk with slightly red cheeks and curlier hair than when he started. Thankfully, the moderators don&rsquo;t mention it. Tony isn&rsquo;t allowed backstage with him, so he says, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do great,&rdquo; and, &ldquo;Kiss for good luck?&rdquo; Before pulling Bruce into a kiss that is entirely too indecent for the backstage area at a science convention, surrounded by people in black shirts with yellow logos.</p><p>Tony grins, wiggles his fingers in a wave and disappears into the crowd. Bruce tries to keep his eye on him, but there&rsquo;s far too many people milling around. The thought that they&rsquo;re all for him makes his heart jump into his throat.</p><p>The announcer&rsquo;s voice makes him jump. &ldquo;Doctor Bruce Banner, expert in gamma radiation, nuclear physics, and biochemistry, here to discuss his experience with gamma particles.&rdquo;</p><p>-<br />-<br />-</p><p>Bruce&rsquo;s name has just been announced when the guy next to Tony scoffs under his breath. He tries to ignore it, because there&rsquo;s Bruce looking small and scared and overwhelmed all at once and then a lot more relaxed when Tony winks at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Bruce says, eyes darting around nervously. He opens his laptop up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m, uh, Bruce Banner. Obviously. And I&rsquo;m here to talk about gamma radiation. As one of the world&rsquo;s leading experts. Which is a title I don&rsquo;t actually think I&rsquo;ve earned,&rdquo; Bruce shrugs, typing in his password. &ldquo;After all, all I did was mess around with gamma rays and had a less than pleasurable outcome.&rdquo;</p><p>That gets a few laughs, and Tony can see it relaxes Bruce a little. </p><p>&ldquo;&rdquo;So, I guess before we start, I absolutely do not think you should try any gamma experimentation at home. Look how the turned out for me,&rdquo; Bruce says. He lets the Hulk bleed through enough to colour his fingertip green (Tony&rsquo;s heart swells when he remembers how much trouble Bruce had getting the Other Guy under control enough to do that).</p><p>Everyone in the hall gasps, though, including the two men sitting next to Tony. One of whom whispers to his friend, &ldquo;Irresponsible. What were they thinking, letting that guy up there? Should be Stark up there.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony breathes once, twice, curls his hand into a fist, and tries not to punch them. </p><p>Bruce doesn&rsquo;t notice, focused on setting up his slideshow. &ldquo;-I studied gamma a lot with my ex, Betty Ross. Some of you more dedicated fans might even have seen some of her talks. She started coming to these a lot sooner than I did.&rdquo;</p><p>The guy next to Tony snorts again. &ldquo;Dumped his ex, now he&rsquo;s a fag, you know?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Stupid one at that,&rdquo; the other dude mutters back, grinning.</p><p>Tony breathes five times this time, pulls out his phone, and texts Pepper.</p><blockquote><p><i>How bad would the backlash be if I knocked two guys out? TS</i></p></blockquote><p><i>How knocked out are we talking? Xx</i></p><blockquote><p><i>Like, broken noses at least. TS</i></p></blockquote><p><i>I&rsquo;ll look into it. Why? Xx</i></p><blockquote><p><i>Sitting next to the most assholish people I&rsquo;ve ever met. Even worse than Hammer. TS</i></p></blockquote><p><i>Christ. What are they doing? Xx</i></p><blockquote><p><i>Insulting Bruce during his talk. TS</i></p></blockquote><p><i>Hm. Go crazy. I&rsquo;ll handle it. Xx</i></p><blockquote><p><i>Did I ever tell you how much I love you? TS</i></p></blockquote><p><i>You can tell me in the new Versace bag. Xx</i></p><blockquote><p><i>You got it. TS</i></p></blockquote><p>God, he loves her. Bruce has moved onto talking about the applications for gamma radiation in modern medicine, and looks thoroughly distracted by the rest of the audience and his laptop. So Tony pulls his Emergency Recognition Cap over his head and nudges the guy next to him gently.</p><p>Dipping into his more Californian accent, the one he picked up back when he lived in Malibu and then learnt how to do consistently, he says, &ldquo;God, what a dumbass, right?&rdquo;</p><p>Thankfully, the guy doesn&rsquo;t turn to look at him, instead just saying. &ldquo;So fucking stupid. Shame its not Stark up there.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony represses the thank you and instead chuckles. &ldquo;Right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If only I didn&rsquo;t only date smart chicks,&rdquo; the guys friend says, &ldquo;I bet he&rsquo;s a good bang.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony bites his tongue, hard. &ldquo;Shame you&rsquo;ll never get there while I&rsquo;m here, then, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; He says, pulling the cap off and glaring up. Both of them look surprised, and under different circumstances, Tony would find it kind of amusing. As it is, he grins and jabs a sharp uppercut into the first guys nose, and it breaks instantly. (Thank you, Mom, for enrolling him in karate classes after his first kidnapping.)</p><p>The guy screeches, which draws the attention of practically everyone in the room. Except the security guards. Count your blessings, Tony supposes, because he manages to knock the second guy out with one well aimed punch and then push the first one to the floor and trap him there.</p><p>He also manages to get the words, &ldquo;He is smarter than you will ever be, then I will ever be, and he is not there for you to ridicule or joke about.&rdquo;</p><p>The guy makes a strangled choking noise and then security starts pulling Tony off of him. He manages to yell out, &ldquo;Say hello to my lawyers, asshole!&rdquo; Before the handcuffs snap on and he gets taken to the security booths.</p><p>-<br />-<br />-</p><p>&ldquo;What,&rdquo; Bruce says, an hour later, once he&rsquo;s managed to sneak in and pick the lock to Tony&rsquo;s impromptu cell (which is actually just an unused office with an outside lock), &ldquo;The fuck was all that about?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I had permission from Pepper,&rdquo; Tony leads with. &ldquo;Any chance you could get me out of these?&rdquo;</p><p>Bruce sighs, glancing back at the door and then at Tony&rsquo;s handcuffed wrists. He pulls out the pin he must have used on the door and reaches over to fiddle with the cuffs. &ldquo;I cannot believe you did that. What came over you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Before you get all mad,&rdquo; Tony says, &ldquo;Which I realise is pretty justified given this whole situation. Just hear me out first?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Benefit of the doubt,&rdquo; Bruce agrees, setting the cuffs on the floor and curling his fingers over Tony&rsquo;s wrist, rubbing the slightly raw marks.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, well, the guys I was sitting next to were being really rude about you and us. And so I pretended to be, well, not me, asked Pepper first, and knocked them out,&rdquo; Tony says.</p><p>&ldquo;What were they saying?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, that you were stupid, and I would have been better, and also that you were a fag, and something that could probably count as sexual harassment, if I&rsquo;m honest,&rdquo; Tony shrugs. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to ruin your talk, and I&rsquo;m really sorry. But I couldn&rsquo;t just sit there and let them say that!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Bruce sighs. &ldquo;Apology accepted. Can you get your jet flown here now, or will we have to wait till tomorrow?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do yo- They&rsquo;re not kicking us out, are they?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony, you just knocked out two guests. They&rsquo;re kicking us out for a little bit, yes. We might be welcomed back next year.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony huffs. &ldquo;Okay. I&rsquo;m sorry, baby.&rdquo;</p><p>Bruce smiles with the corners of his mouth and holds a hand out for Tony to grab. &ldquo;I know. If we don&rsquo;t get accepted next year, we could throw our own science fair.&rdquo;</p><p>(Usually when Tony&rsquo;s eyes light up like that, it never means anything good).</p><p>&ldquo;Lets focus on getting home first,&rdquo; Bruce adds hurriedly. &ldquo;Deal with the press storm I&rsquo;m sure this has whirled up. Buy Pepper a monster box of chocolates.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be fine with it. She was in favour, actually,&rdquo; Tony says, &ldquo;Come on. I can get the jet here in an hour.&rdquo;</p><p>Bruce grins, and lets Tony lead him in sneaking out of the makeshift cell.</p><p>-<br />-<br />-<br /><b>as always, if you want to be added/removed from the taglist, shoot me a message</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;tags: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOKpYBwgGIcqNQhGb0lZL4w\">@herminbean</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/moMW2IRs5D_i0qXkkbEyapg\">@starkstrangers</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkOxsedjmkeR8M1cMfsM5gw\">@sakiy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mj9CGbs4iFyqfpw0Rma7inA\">@mexicaan</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0nS3NwVOywSDakjTQSTnJQ\">@planettparker</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_KDmuct2lnGJ6vIbSePmUQ\">@yashaamor</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGrCKYs_lSsFQlBKOHlaagw\">@katanatherealityhopper</a> @helen-lady-of-thorns @teamleoforthewin <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3aTvAw6uwvqLJyuLhXdc4Q\">@siranthonystark</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mepzT1fxZxRg19pezPq84TQ\">@hdthdthdt</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXXYZgsT-wrZLUVZoNxrtDQ\">@puppy-barnes</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/meSpclXNLdIUxNJBUJfb_VA\">@theicingonacoke</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mX0ic8NCs5efeFb97UgAeBw\">@annikaislost</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMq-7AJeykTmqsmT2khOXQg\">@that-weird-nerd</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWW_fIWtdzN6vUbR50zkcaw\">@nb-mercy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/macHb6HdVRQyZ2ltuW3wpuQ\">@fetefox</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3JkLHKG7tbdJe-TweClZSg\">@sleepyoldchild</a>&nbsp;</b></p>",

                "content": "<p>A Tony Stark &amp; Peter Parker ficlet.&nbsp; </p><p>Summary: Tony&rsquo;s free evening is interrupted by Peter Parker, who managed to fall into a river. Tony takes care of him. Something Peter says makes him think about the their relationship and how it affects him. </p><p>Hope you enjoy :)</p><p>Tony is just about to enjoy a lonely late-night glass of wine and the last few pages of a moderately exciting thriller, when the door bell rings. </p><p>He groans annoyed, rolling his eyes. </p><p>Whoever this is, Tony hopes there&rsquo;s a good explanation for disturbing him on his free evening. &nbsp;</p><p>He stands up, sighing, throwing a last longing glance at the wine and the book.</p><p>He opens the door, a snappy remark already half on his lips. </p><p>But when he sees, who&rsquo;s out there in the dark, he freezes. &nbsp;</p><p>In front of him stands a trembling Peter Parker, his hair and clothes dripping wet. </p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark,&rdquo; he breathes barely audible. &ldquo;Help.&rdquo;</p><p>He sways slightly, pressing a hand against his head, groaning. </p><p>&ldquo;What the &hellip; Come in,&rdquo; Tony opens the door for Peter, watching as the boy staggers in, leaving wet footsteps on the floor. &nbsp;</p><p>Tony looks him over. Worry stirs in him at the miserable sight the kid makes. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay. We have to get you out of these clothes,&rdquo; he says. He shoves Peter in the direction of the bathroom. &ldquo;And I think a warm shower will help,&rdquo; he adds. &ldquo;Are you hurt?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Um, no, I don&rsquo;t think so &hellip; just hit my head somewhere &hellip;,&rdquo; Peter says, fumbling with the buttons of his jacket with trembling fingers. Tony helps him. When they finally have removed every wet piece of clothing, Tony advises him to shower. </p><p>Meanwhile, he fetches one of his pyjamas for Peter. He chooses the softest and cosiest he has.</p><p>When he comes back, Peter is drying his hair. He looks much better, already. At least he&rsquo;s not trembling anymore. </p><p>Tony hands him the pyjama. &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; He asks while Peter&rsquo;s putting it on gratefully. </p><p>The kid swallows. &ldquo;Fell in the river &hellip;,&rdquo; he mumbles. </p><p>&ldquo;You fell in the RIVER?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah &hellip; sorry,&rdquo; Peter ducks his head, as if he&rsquo;s expecting a rant. </p><p>Tony shakes his head in disbelief. </p><p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you to be more careful?&rdquo; He scolds but tries to stay as calm as he can. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t fall into rivers when you&rsquo;re helping people finding their pets or their stolen things or whatever. What did you do tonight?!&rdquo;</p><p>Peter hesitates, but when he speaks, he raises his chin almost defiantly. </p><p>&ldquo;There was a mugging going on, on a bridge. I had to do something &hellip; I just &hellip; I didn&rsquo;t see there was a &nbsp;second man and he shoved me. I was too surprised to react. But, you know, I couldn&rsquo;t just watch. I&rsquo;m Spiderman. I&rsquo;m helping people &hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And Spiderman fell into a river,&rdquo; Tony says drily. &ldquo;Had to save himself from drowning. Wow.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter stares at his bare feet, suddenly looking sad and disappointed. </p><p>&ldquo;I just wanted to help,&rdquo; he murmurs. </p><p>Tony sighs. He already feels sorry. He lays a hand on Peter&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he says quietly. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s not wrong that you want to help. But we really have to work on your equipment. We have to make you more, um, resistant against such ordinary threats like freezing water, right? But don&rsquo;t worry &hellip; I&rsquo;m already working on something &hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Peter smiles weakly, but then he coughs. It sounds wet. </p><p>Tony frowns. </p><p>&bdquo;This doesn&rsquo;t sound good, kid. I&rsquo;ll better call my doctor &hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. I don&rsquo;t want to be a bother, Mr. Stark. I&rsquo;ll be fine, I &hellip;&rdquo; Peter coughs again, violently this time, and grimaces in pain. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, calm down. I just want to be sure you&rsquo;re alright, okay?
