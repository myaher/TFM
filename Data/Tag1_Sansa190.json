Because they don&rsquo;t want people to like, you know, hate it but it&rsquo;s hard to make everybody happy in such a big cast. <b>And the one person who didn&rsquo;t deliberately read their scripts was Kit Harington, who went to the final season table read literally knowing nothing.</b> <b>And it was funny for the showrunners because they hadn&rsquo;t heard anything from him, so they were thinking, &lsquo;Oh, my god. Does Kit Harington completely hate what we did with his character in the final season?&rsquo;</b> So they walk into the final season table read and they say, 'Kit! So what did you think?&rsquo; And he&rsquo;s, like, 'Oh, yeah, I hadn&rsquo;t read it.&rsquo; And they were, like, 'Oh, so that explains why we haven&rsquo;t heard from one of our major actors.&rsquo;&rdquo;</i></h2><p>- <a href=\"https://www.podbean.com/media/share/dir-cizqq-543fd72\">Final season preview - EW\u2019s Game of Thrones Weekly</a> (podcast)</p><p>So.

I hope they\u2019ll put more effort for Sansa\u2019s coronation as QITN ;) question-does Sophie fit Sansa\u2019s description in the books? I never read the books but from the fan art it looks like Sansa is meant to be unimposing and soft, almost fragile looking. According to you which actress do you think fits Sansa book description best?",
        "answer": "<p>Dear nonny,</p><p>well, I\u2019ve seen better wigs, but I wouldn\u2019t say horrific. At least Sansa the hairline is not too far off and Sophie seems to have some sort of Lyanna hairdo, which is fine. As for her dresses, I really wish Clapton would snap out of her \u201cblack period.\u201d <br/></p><p>I mean, if you think back to season 1 and the colourful dresses, I really, really wish we would get some colour back. I mean, it\u2019s Winter now, and the situation is dire\u2026.. I get it\u2026. But I want some colour\u2026. I hope we\u2019ll get at least one really nice dress\u2026</p><p>Does Sophie fit Sansa\u2019s description in the books? That is a good question. I\u2019ve never thought she did not. I mean Sansa is redhaired, blue-eyed, tall, beautiful, that all fits very well. And unlike other actresses I never thought that Sophie would look to differently. To me it is a question of how well the actress is in the role. I mean Rose Leslie is far prettier than the description of Ygritte and yet to me she was Ygritte. Gemma Whelan looks absolutely different than bookAsha and when I first saw her cast I was hugely disappointed. But Gemma made me forget that I had issues about her being cast at first (actually Yara and Asha are kind of two different persons for me by now). <br/></p><p>So for me my imagination of BookSansa and Sophie are not too far apart, especially in the first season. We have come far beyond the books, and Sansa has matured into a young woman with self-confidence.</p><p>As for fanart, I do think that the fanart is often from the early books, so to say, and I would expect Sansa to look softer, more unimposing and maybe even more fragile. But I must admit that I never picturer her exactly as fragile. That girl survived quite a lot and that is maybe I have a problem with the fragile look as with the sly look. If Sansa looks like a cunning politician I\u2019m out.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>The thing with fanart is, that there are many, many talented artists. Sansan shippers have incredible beautiful pictures, but I must admit that I rarely think \u201cThis is how I picture her\u201d. But that doesn\u2019t mean that the art isn\u2019t wonderful. There are many pictures around and many are amazing. That no one has ever struck the \u201cOh, this is Sansa, as she is in my head\u201d-cord in me, is not the fault of the artist.</p><p>As for which actress I want to play Sansa, I am actually very satisfied with Sophie. I think as a teenager she came very close to how I pictured teenage Sansa, and although adult Sophie is not exactly the same as I picture adult Sansa, she is so close and plays Sansa so well, that I don\u2019t have any issues with the actress. <br/></p><p>I could picture other actresses, but the thing is that they probably would be too old. I mean Rose Leslie is a beautiful natural redhead, but she gives the vibes of a pragmatic, down-to-earth woman and not a lady. Emily Blunt is one of my favourites, but she wouldn\u2019t come close to how I picture Sansa.</p><p>You know, to me the acting skill is more important than the look. Jennifer Ehle was cast originally as Catelyn, and I know I would have loved her, but Michelle Fairley did so well, that I\u2019ve almost forgotten that she was not the original cast. <br/></p><p>Lena Headey also looks completely different than I pictured Cersei and yet to me she is Cersei now, even if I still have an image of BookCersei which looks completely different.</p><p>Sorry, if it seems like I just rambled, and if I did not explain well, but Sophie for me is a very good Sansa, and for me she is more Sansa than some of the fanart I see around - but that is a very subjective view! And I enjoy the fanart anyway, even if the Sansa is not \u201cmy\u201d Sansa.</p><p>Thanks for the ask!<br/></p>",
