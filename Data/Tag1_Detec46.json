This game was the first ever video game I played at 10 years old. I played pretend in the playground as a psyduck, I traded and collected the cards, and my ds was with me 24/7.

The cinematography was absolutely stunning and the Pokemon where realistic yet still cute. They where able to capture what being in the Pokemon world would be like. The subtle nods to other regions and even the top view of the new Galar region was so cool!! the way Pokemon and people worked together was completely perfect. And of course, my favorite Pokemon being a main side character didn&rsquo;t hurt ;P</p><p>That doesnt mean they didnt mess up on a few things. I was disappointed that death was a real fear in pokemon battles, but I guess that is understandable.

Especially since he survived a full car crash.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0Pokeballs also didn&rsquo;t expand, they just stayed the same size, which was really disappointing to me. I also wish there where more battle scenes, The Gengar and Blastoise battle made me cry (happy tears) and I just wish I could have seen more of that.

His pokedex entry really spoke to me, seeing as I suffered a deliberating illness that I also couldn&rsquo;t control. At that moment, when I healed them and saw the little duck waddle in the wrong direction, I knew this was my favorite Pokemon. And he has been, for over 10 years. Im so glad to see him finally getting the recognition he deserved. The merch, the art, the love that I knew he could get!!! Before this movie I would hunt throughout the internet for anything with my favorite duck on it, and I was lucky if I even found a deformed keychain. Now? I have two cups, a plush, and I plan on getting anything else with this cute yellow face.</p><p>They also did this duck amazing justice. He is adorable, goofy, and extremely powerful. I loved his dynamic with Pikachu and how his trainer knew exactly how to handle him. His little backpack sling is exactly how I would take my Psyduck places!! (heck I take my dog in a little bag). All in all, Psyduck was my favorite part of this movie, and I hope we see more of him in any new movie they decide to release</p><p>This was just a short review of the pokemon movie that Iv been wanting to post, im in no way a professional.

            "description": "Randomness Incarnate.\n---------------------------\nOr, well this is a blog that exists. I used to be a fandom blog but at this point I'm just random reblog soup. So what can you actually expect from me? Funny stuff, cute stuff- I try to keep this mostly positive and drama free. Recently, besides the general stuff that goes around I post about games and anime. Think like Xenoblade, Kingdom Hearts, Persona 5 ect. \nYou can find me on Fanfiction.net at Unformal Sorrelle and AO3 as Unformal_Sorrelle. I'm mostly a gen writer who goes all over fandomwise. I don't mind talking about my fics, and I'll sometimes post about them so there's that. Just a note, Fanfiction.net has basically everything while my AO3 is newer and only really has my more polished works.\nAnyways, sorry for all my cluttered blerg and hopefully I'll keep posting whatever you're interested in!",
