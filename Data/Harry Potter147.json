Groaning, you place your pillow to your face to avoid the blinding sunlight.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you think your doing L/n?&rdquo; You heard someone say and you gently open your eyes to see James staring at you with crossed arms. He&rsquo;s wearing his Quidditch uniform and it strikes to you that you have a Quidditch match today.</p><p>You jolt up your bed and look at the time, It&rsquo;s still early for the match and you let out a sigh, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t scare me like that Potter.&rdquo; You got up your bed and look for your uniform to change.</p><p>&ldquo;What? I didn&rsquo;t do anything, you know?&rdquo; He replied and sat down to your bed playing with his own broomstick.</p><p>You&rsquo;re both on the Gryffindor Team, him being the Seeker of the team and you a Chaser. It&rsquo;s not that easy to be in the team and there are a lot of students who wants to be a Quidditch player but for you two it&rsquo;s pretty basic because both of you are skilled in managing your brooms in the air, Even Professor McGonagall can see it in both of you.</p><p>Today, you&rsquo;ll be playing agains Slytherin, They&rsquo;re one of the most difficult house to compete because they do have a unique style of playing and great tactics. But you&rsquo;ve got the advantage now because your team beats the Hufflepuff with 70 points along with extra 150 for James catching the snitch. </p><p>He can see the worry in your face, &ldquo;Hey! Relax! we&rsquo;ve got this!&rdquo; He got up and put a hand on your shoulder. </p><p>&ldquo;Do we? what if, what if we didn&rsquo;t get the cup? what will the others say? what will Professor McGonagall feel?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be fine Y/n! We&rsquo;ve got the higher ground here! Don&rsquo;t worry! Now, get dressed. I&rsquo;ll see you at the Common Room, Sirius and Remus are waiting for us at the Great Hall.&rdquo; He finally said and went out of the dormitory. </p><p>After a few moments of contemplating and getting dressed, you went out of your dormitory at last with your broomstick at your hands. You and James climb to the portrait hole and walk down to the Great Hall. </p><p>When you enter you saw Sirius and Remus eating their breakfast. You approached the two and smiled at them, &ldquo;Hey Sirius!&rdquo; the boy smiled at you and you turn your gaze to Remus who&rsquo;s still focus on his meal, &ldquo;You okay Remus?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, Thanks.&rdquo; He said coldly and he didn&rsquo;t even bother to look at you. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s with him?&rsquo; you thought but you push it aside and start to eat your breakfast before the match start. </p><p>Afterwards, You got up to say goodbye to the two boys but that didn&rsquo;t end up well, &ldquo;Remus we will go now, are you sure you&rsquo;re okay?&rdquo; You placed your hands to his but he quickly pulled away. </p><p>&ldquo;I said I&rsquo;m okay! Why do you have to be so annoying?&rdquo; Out of nowhere, He shouted at you that made you startled and so was James and Sirius. </p><p>&ldquo;I\u2014I&hellip;Well, see you at the game, Come on James.&rdquo; You shortly said and grab your broom then walk out of the Great Hall with James. </p><p>Both of you went to the locker room where other players are getting ready, suddenly you team captain spoke, &ldquo;Okay listen up! We&rsquo;ve only got one shot on this! Once we lose against Slytherin then that&rsquo;s it! We won&rsquo;t have the Quidditch Cup. You know what to do, we&rsquo;ve been practicing for months! Now, why don&rsquo;t we go up there we get that damn Cup?&rdquo; Everyone in the locker room cheered and all of you went out of the field. </p><p>The field is surrounded by the students of four houses but Gryffindor and Slytherin&rsquo;s cheer are far louder than the rest. You felt goosebumps all over your body, You can&rsquo;t believe that they&rsquo;re cheering for all of you! The Gryffindor Team! </p><p>You mounted your broom and hovered at the center of the field where all of you is waiting for the referee. After a few minutes, The quaffle is released together with the bludgers and you&rsquo;ve easy got the quaffle and fly towards the goal post. </p><p>One of the Slytherin player bumped you and accidentally lose the hold of the ball and he caught it. You turned and chase the player then suddenly a bludger went pass the player and dropped the ball that you swiftly caught it and went straight to the goal post. </p><p>Cheers erupted when you throw the ball in one of the hoops meaning that Gryffindor got 10 points for it and the game goes on. </p><p>Gryffindor gets another 10 points, then Slytherin got hold of the ball. They avoided each of you and finally they shoot the ball and earned points. </p><p>The game goes on, no one is resting and all of you are now exhausted under the bright sky. Sweat running down your face, Gryffindor got 50 points while Slytherin got 40 and if the slytherin manage to shoot the quaffle then the scores are tie and the only chance you&rsquo;ve got is for James to catch the snitch. </p><p>On the other side of the field, James is now watching out for the snitch. He can see the exhaust in the faces of his team mates. He need to get the snitch immediately if he want to end this game. Then unexpectedly, the snitch fly in front of him then went down. James didn&rsquo;t hesitate and dive to catch the snitch, It&rsquo;s unbelievably fast but he manage to stretch his hands. A bludger is coming straight at him and he quickly duck and continue to chase after the snitch. After a few minutes, He stretched again his hands and grab the cold metal ball. </p><p>You&rsquo;re still hovering in the air when suddenly the whistle blows and you saw James raising his hands with the snitch in his fingers. The gryffindor students went wild, They won! They actually won! </p><p>You are in the middle of celebrating when you heard someone say, &ldquo;Watch out Y/n!&rdquo; but you&rsquo;re too slow to react and a bludger hit you in the face knocking you off your broom and your vision went black. </p><p>Remus is currently at the library reading a book and staying out of trouble. Full moon is near and that makes him really uncomfortable and having mood swings that is really not helpful at the moment. He even shouted at you for no reason at all, He&rsquo;s just got so angry all the time. </p><p>The library door burst open and he saw Sirius sweaty and catching his breath. He scanned the room and when he laid eyes on Remus he run towards him. </p><p>&ldquo;Moony, You&hellip; You&rsquo;ve got to come with me.&rdquo; Remus looks confused.</p><p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip; It&rsquo;s Y/n! She fell of her broom! It&rsquo;s ten\u2014&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t let Sirius finish what he&rsquo;s saying, He run out of the room and went straight to the hospital wing. </p><p>Madam Pomfrey just got out of the room when Remus get there, &ldquo;Madam Pomfrey! where&rsquo;s Y/n? is she alright?&rdquo; He quickly asked. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes Mr. Lupin she&rsquo;s fine now, but she&rsquo;s not yet awake. She fell 10 feet of the ground! Not to mention the bludger that hit her face and dislocating her nose. I&rsquo;m really thankful to Mr. Black that he uses slowing charm to Ms. L/n.&rdquo; </p><p>Remus feels like he&rsquo;s so useless, he should&rsquo;ve been there to save you! He should have been there to stop the bludger from hitting you and He shouldn&rsquo;t have shouted you before you left. </p><p>He entered the Hospital wing and he saw you lying at the bed, James beside you. </p><p>&ldquo;How is she?&rdquo; </p><p>***</p><p>You open your eyes and you saw Remus, Sirius and James beside you, &ldquo;What the hell happened?&rdquo; You asked trying to get up but all you felt is pain all over your body. </p><p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t move my love,&rdquo; Remus said. </p><p>You can see the bags under his eyes that makes you worried, &ldquo;Remus what happened to you? you look like you haven&rsquo;t slept for days!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh hell yeah he haven&rsquo;t! He&rsquo;s been watching you for three days!&rdquo; Sirius said munching what you thought is a Bertie Bott&rsquo;s Every Flavour Beans. </p><p>&ldquo;Wait, I&rsquo;ve been sleeping for three days?!&rdquo; they all nodded. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry my love, I should have been there, I should have saved you! And I&rsquo;m sorry for shouting at you! It&rsquo;s just\u2014\u2014The full moon is near and I can&rsquo;t handle my ang\u2014&rdquo; You cut Remus when you placed your finger to the center of his lips. </p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to say sorry Rem, It&rsquo;s not your fault. Okay?&rdquo; He nodded, &ldquo;Now, why don&rsquo;t you come closer so I can kiss you?

You and James climb to the portrait hole and walk down to the Great Hall. </p><p>When you enter you saw Sirius and Remus eating their breakfast. You approached the two and smiled at them, \u201cHey Sirius!\u201d the boy smiled at you and you turn your gaze to Remus who\u2019s still focus on his meal, \u201cYou okay Remus?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Thanks.\u201d He said coldly and he didn\u2019t even bother to look at you. \u2018What\u2019s with him?\u2019 you thought but you push it aside and start to eat your breakfast before the match start. </p><p>Afterwards, You got up to say goodbye to the two boys but that didn\u2019t end up well, \u201cRemus we will go now, are you sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d You placed your hands to his but he quickly pulled away. </p><p>\u201cI said I\u2019m okay!

We\u2019ve only got one shot on this! Once we lose against Slytherin then that\u2019s it! We won\u2019t have the Quidditch Cup. You know what to do, we\u2019ve been practicing for months! Now, why don\u2019t we go up there we get that damn Cup?\u201d Everyone in the locker room cheered and all of you went out of the field. </p><p>The field is surrounded by the students of four houses but Gryffindor and Slytherin\u2019s cheer are far louder than the rest. You felt goosebumps all over your body, You can\u2019t believe that they\u2019re cheering for all of you! The Gryffindor Team! </p><p>You mounted your broom and hovered at the center of the field where all of you is waiting for the referee. After a few minutes, The quaffle is released together with the bludgers and you\u2019ve easy got the quaffle and fly towards the goal post. </p><p>One of the Slytherin player bumped you and accidentally lose the hold of the ball and he caught it. You turned and chase the player then suddenly a bludger went pass the player and dropped the ball that you swiftly caught it and went straight to the goal post. </p><p>Cheers erupted when you throw the ball in one of the hoops meaning that Gryffindor got 10 points for it and the game goes on. </p><p>Gryffindor gets another 10 points, then Slytherin got hold of the ball. They avoided each of you and finally they shoot the ball and earned points. </p><p>The game goes on, no one is resting and all of you are now exhausted under the bright sky. Sweat running down your face, Gryffindor got 50 points while Slytherin got 40 and if the slytherin manage to shoot the quaffle then the scores are tie and the only chance you\u2019ve got is for James to catch the snitch. </p><p>On the other side of the field, James is now watching out for the snitch. He can see the exhaust in the faces of his team mates. He need to get the snitch immediately if he want to end this game. Then unexpectedly, the snitch fly in front of him then went down. James didn\u2019t hesitate and dive to catch the snitch, It\u2019s unbelievably fast but he manage to stretch his hands. A bludger is coming straight at him and he quickly duck and continue to chase after the snitch. After a few minutes, He stretched again his hands and grab the cold metal ball. </p><p>You\u2019re still hovering in the air when suddenly the whistle blows and you saw James raising his hands with the snitch in his fingers. The gryffindor students went wild, They won! They actually won! </p><p>You are in the middle of celebrating when you heard someone say, \u201cWatch out Y/n!\u201d but you\u2019re too slow to react and a bludger hit you in the face knocking you off your broom and your vision went black. </p><p>Remus is currently at the library reading a book and staying out of trouble. Full moon is near and that makes him really uncomfortable and having mood swings that is really not helpful at the moment. He even shouted at you for no reason at all, He\u2019s just got so angry all the time. </p><p>The library door burst open and he saw Sirius sweaty and catching his breath. He scanned the room and when he laid eyes on Remus he run towards him. </p><p>\u201cMoony, You\u2026 You\u2019ve got to come with me.\u201d Remus looks confused.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 It\u2019s Y/n! She fell of her broom! It\u2019s ten\u2014\u201d He didn\u2019t let Sirius finish what he\u2019s saying, He run out of the room and went straight to the hospital wing. </p><p>Madam Pomfrey just got out of the room when Remus get there, \u201cMadam Pomfrey! where\u2019s Y/n? is she alright?\u201d He quickly asked. </p><p>\u201cYes Mr. Lupin she\u2019s fine now, but she\u2019s not yet awake. She fell 10 feet of the ground! Not to mention the bludger that hit her face and dislocating her nose. I\u2019m really thankful to Mr. Black that he uses slowing charm to Ms. L/n.\u201d </p><p>Remus feels like he\u2019s so useless, he should\u2019ve been there to save you! He should have been there to stop the bludger from hitting you and He shouldn\u2019t have shouted you before you left. </p><p>He entered the Hospital wing and he saw you lying at the bed, James beside you. </p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d </p><p>***</p><p>You open your eyes and you saw Remus, Sirius and James beside you, \u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d You asked trying to get up but all you felt is pain all over your body. </p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t move my love,\u201d Remus said. </p><p>You can see the bags under his eyes that makes you worried, \u201cRemus what happened to you? you look like you haven\u2019t slept for days!\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh hell yeah he haven\u2019t!

It&rsquo;s not that easy to be in the team and there are a lot of students who wants to be a Quidditch player but for you two it&rsquo;s pretty basic because both of you are skilled in managing your brooms in the air, Even Professor McGonagall can see it in both of you.</p><p>Today, you&rsquo;ll be playing agains Slytherin, They&rsquo;re one of the most difficult house to compete because they do have a unique style of playing and great tactics. But you&rsquo;ve got the advantage now because your team beats the Hufflepuff with 70 points along with extra 150 for James catching the snitch. </p><p>He can see the worry in your face, &ldquo;Hey! Relax! we&rsquo;ve got this!&rdquo; He got up and put a hand on your shoulder. </p><p>&ldquo;Do we? what if, what if we didn&rsquo;t get the cup? what will the others say? what will Professor McGonagall feel?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be fine Y/n! We&rsquo;ve got the higher ground here! Don&rsquo;t worry! Now, get dressed. I&rsquo;ll see you at the Common Room, Sirius and Remus are waiting for us at the Great Hall.&rdquo; He finally said and went out of the dormitory. </p><p>After a few moments of contemplating and getting dressed, you went out of your dormitory at last with your broomstick at your hands. You and James climb to the portrait hole and walk down to the Great Hall. </p><p>When you enter you saw Sirius and Remus eating their breakfast. You approached the two and smiled at them, &ldquo;Hey Sirius!&rdquo; the boy smiled at you and you turn your gaze to Remus who&rsquo;s still focus on his meal, &ldquo;You okay Remus?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, Thanks.&rdquo; He said coldly and he didn&rsquo;t even bother to look at you. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s with him?&rsquo; you thought but you push it aside and start to eat your breakfast before the match start. </p><p>Afterwards, You got up to say goodbye to the two boys but that didn&rsquo;t end up well, &ldquo;Remus we will go now, are you sure you&rsquo;re okay?&rdquo; You placed your hands to his but he quickly pulled away. </p><p>&ldquo;I said I&rsquo;m okay! Why do you have to be so annoying?&rdquo; Out of nowhere, He shouted at you that made you startled and so was James and Sirius. </p><p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&hellip;Well, see you at the game, Come on James.&rdquo; You shortly said and grab your broom then walk out of the Great Hall with James. </p><p>Both of you went to the locker room where other players are getting ready, suddenly you team captain spoke, &ldquo;Okay listen up! We&rsquo;ve only got one shot on this! Once we lose against Slytherin then that&rsquo;s it! We won&rsquo;t have the Quidditch Cup. You know what to do, we&rsquo;ve been practicing for months! Now, why don&rsquo;t we go up there we get that damn Cup?&rdquo; Everyone in the locker room cheered and all of you went out of the field. </p><p>The field is surrounded by the students of four houses but Gryffindor and Slytherin&rsquo;s cheer are far louder than the rest. You felt goosebumps all over your body, You can&rsquo;t believe that they&rsquo;re cheering for all of you! The Gryffindor Team! </p><p>You mounted your broom and hovered at the center of the field where all of you is waiting for the referee. After a few minutes, The quaffle is released together with the bludgers and you&rsquo;ve easy got the quaffle and fly towards the goal post. </p><p>One of the Slytherin player bumped you and accidentally lose the hold of the ball and he caught it. You turned and chase the player then suddenly a bludger went pass the player and dropped the ball that you swiftly caught it and went straight to the goal post. </p><p>Cheers erupted when you throw the ball in one of the hoops meaning that Gryffindor got 10 points for it and the game goes on. </p><p>Gryffindor gets another 10 points, then Slytherin got hold of the ball. They avoided each of you and finally they shoot the ball and earned points. </p><p>The game goes on, no one is resting and all of you are now exhausted under the bright sky. Sweat running down your face, Gryffindor got 50 points while Slytherin got 40 and if the slytherin manage to shoot the quaffle then the scores are tie and the only chance you&rsquo;ve got is for James to catch the snitch. </p><p>On the other side of the field, James is now watching out for the snitch. He can see the exhaust in the faces of his team mates. He need to get the snitch immediately if he want to end this game. Then unexpectedly, the snitch fly in front of him then went down. James didn&rsquo;t hesitate and dive to catch the snitch, It&rsquo;s unbelievably fast but he manage to stretch his hands. A bludger is coming straight at him and he quickly duck and continue to chase after the snitch. After a few minutes, He stretched again his hands and grab the cold metal ball. </p><p>You&rsquo;re still hovering in the air when suddenly the whistle blows and you saw James raising his hands with the snitch in his fingers. The gryffindor students went wild, They won! They actually won! </p><p>You are in the middle of celebrating when you heard someone say, &ldquo;Watch out Y/n!&rdquo; but you&rsquo;re too slow to react and a bludger hit you in the face knocking you off your broom and your vision went black. </p><p>Remus is currently at the library reading a book and staying out of trouble. Full moon is near and that makes him really uncomfortable and having mood swings that is really not helpful at the moment. He even shouted at you for no reason at all, He&rsquo;s just got so angry all the time. </p><p>The library door burst open and he saw Sirius sweaty and catching his breath. He scanned the room and when he laid eyes on Remus he run towards him. </p><p>&ldquo;Moony, You&hellip; You&rsquo;ve got to come with me.&rdquo; Remus looks confused.</p><p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip; It&rsquo;s Y/n! She fell of her broom! It&rsquo;s ten&mdash;&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t let Sirius finish what he&rsquo;s saying, He run out of the room and went straight to the hospital wing. </p><p>Madam Pomfrey just got out of the room when Remus get there, &ldquo;Madam Pomfrey! where&rsquo;s Y/n? is she alright?&rdquo; He quickly asked. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes Mr. Lupin she&rsquo;s fine now, but she&rsquo;s not yet awake. She fell 10 feet of the ground! Not to mention the bludger that hit her face and dislocating her nose. I&rsquo;m really thankful to Mr. Black that he uses slowing charm to Ms. L/n.&rdquo; </p><p>Remus feels like he&rsquo;s so useless, he should&rsquo;ve been there to save you! He should have been there to stop the bludger from hitting you and He shouldn&rsquo;t have shouted you before you left. </p><p>He entered the Hospital wing and he saw you lying at the bed, James beside you. </p><p>&ldquo;How is she?&rdquo; </p><p>***</p><p>You open your eyes and you saw Remus, Sirius and James beside you, &ldquo;What the hell happened?&rdquo; You asked trying to get up but all you felt is pain all over your body. </p><p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t move my love,&rdquo; Remus said. </p><p>You can see the bags under his eyes that makes you worried, &ldquo;Remus what happened to you? you look like you haven&rsquo;t slept for days!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh hell yeah he haven&rsquo;t! He&rsquo;s been watching you for three days!&rdquo; Sirius said munching what you thought is a Bertie Bott&rsquo;s Every Flavour Beans. </p><p>&ldquo;Wait, I&rsquo;ve been sleeping for three days?!&rdquo; they all nodded. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry my love, I should have been there, I should have saved you! And I&rsquo;m sorry for shouting at you! It&rsquo;s just&mdash;&mdash;The full moon is near and I can&rsquo;t handle my ang&mdash;&rdquo; You cut Remus when you placed your finger to the center of his lips. </p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to say sorry Rem, It&rsquo;s not your fault. Okay?&rdquo; He nodded, &ldquo;Now, why don&rsquo;t you come closer so I can kiss you? I&rsquo;ve been asleep for three days.&rdquo; He smiled and went closer to you and placed a sweet kiss on your lips. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve missed that, I love you Moony the Moody&rdquo; Your eyebrows went up and down that makes him blushed so hard. </p><p>&ldquo;I love you too Y/n&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>yeah i know it sucks :( </p></p>",
