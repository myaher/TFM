I\u2019m adding to this growing list with the newly released info on Queen Alysanne.</p>\n\n<p>Arya says she want to build castles. Queen Alysanne did that too. She was also an unconventional Lady, broke the mold and was a free-spirit with a fondness for the North. </p>\n<p>\nThanks to G-Girl95 for pointing this out from George\u2019s new book Fire and Blood, we get this cute quote that mirrors Alysanne and Arya so sweetly:</p>\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n<blockquote>\nArya sipped at her tankard cautiously, between spoonfuls of pie still warm from the oven. Her father sometimes let them have a cup of beer, she remembered. Sansa used to make a face at the taste and say that wine was ever so much finer, but Arya had liked it well enough. It made her sad to think of Sansa and her father. (Arya II, ACoK)</blockquote><br/>\nAnd then about Alysanne:\n\n<blockquote>Lord Manderly entertained the queen lavishly. At the welcoming feast an entire aurochs was roasted, and his lordship\u2019s daughter Jessamyn acted as the queen\u2019s cupbearer, filling her tankard with a strong northern ale that Her Grace pronounced finer than any wine she had ever tasted.</blockquote>\n\n~*~\n\n<p>- Alysanne wasn\u2019t raised with the expectation that she would be Queen. She had an older sister already married off several times in violent and political marriages. </p><p>- Alysanne was the youngest living daughter of King Aenys I Targaryen.</p><p>- Alysanne was 12 years old when her brother became king.\u00a0Arya will turn 12 in Winds of Winter, when Jon becomes KiTN</p>\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s just so interesting looking back on what Arya told her Father about her future.</p><p><i>\u201cCan I be a King\u2019s Councillor and build castles and become the High Septon?\u201d</i></p><p>Ned tells her she will\u00a0marry a King\u00a0and rule his Castle, and will possibly have a child that may become the High Septon.</p><p><br/></p>\n<p>\nThe above Arya quote is key and strongly relates to Queen Alysanne. </p>\n\n<p>- Alysanne was a dragonrider who loved to fly. *Arya also expresses a desire to fly several times. She says she wants to turn into\u00a0a wolf with wings</p><p>- Alysanne is a keen archer and hunter. Very \u201ctomboy\u201d and unlady-like activities.\u00a0Arya has demonstrated all these traits. She has hunted and in the show is an expert archer.</p><p>- Queen Alysanne enjoyed physical activity (a quality that would have appealed to her brother Jaehaerys, who was reputed to be a fine dragonrider as well as a skilled archer and horseman). They spent many years growing up together before Jaehaerys became King. </p><p>- Alysanne married her brother Jaehaerys and became Queen. She was also the <i>\u00a0King\u2019s most trusted Counsellor. A role Arya says she wants in her future when Ned tells her she will marry a King.</i></p><p>- Alysanne was loved by the smallfolk. She lived amongst them even after becoming Queen. </p><br/><blockquote>\n\u201cSansa knew all about the sorts of people Arya liked to talk to: squires and grooms and serving girls, old men and naked children, rough-spoken freeriders of uncertain birth. Arya would make friends with anybody.\u201c\n</blockquote><p>And:</p><blockquote><p>Arya had loved nothing better than to sit at her farthers table and listen to them talk. She had loved listening to the men on the benches too; to freeriders tough as leather, courtly knights and bold young squires, and gizzeld old men at arms.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Arya, even while being brainwashed by the FM, she is still a social butterfly. Still making friends where ever she went. It\u2019s interesting she preferred\u00a0Cat of the Canals\u00a0of all of her disguises. Sidenote: In her backstory for Cat, Arya actually says that Cat arrived to Braavos on ship named Nymeria.</p><br/><blockquote><p>\u201cShe missed the friends she\u2019d had when she was Cat of the Canals; Old Brusco with his bad back, his daughters Talea and Brea, the mummers from the Ship, Merry and her whores at the Happy Port, all the other rogues and wharfside scum. She missed Cat herself the most of all, even more than she missed her eyes. She had liked being Cat, more than she had ever liked being Salty or Squab or Weasel or Arry.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Queen Alysanne planned and funded the building of a Castle called Deep Lake. She had Queensgate named in her honor.\u00a0Arya wants to build Castles</p><p>Alysanne was a fierce believer in woman\u2019s rights and actively changed societies standards. \u201cAlysanne saw no reason why a man should be favored over a woman\u201d. Which is something Arya strongly believes in and has even told Jon directly when Arya said a woman is equal to a man.</p>",

I saw someone on reddit speculate about it since Sansa is currently v much higher than her sister in role and title, and that would even the playing field. It could even work in book canon, with them playing the roles for either a young Rickon or Bran (although if it was  Bran, Sansa's role would obviously be more Lady Stark than Lord Stark -esque).",

First of all, they\u2019re all super close in age; there\u2019s no need for them to assume power when Bran is nearly as old, and has actual experienced people around him to help. Second, neither girl has the experience that Bran has to be able to take on those roles over him. Bran has actually dealt with the politics of Winterfell firsthand as acting lord. Nothing Sansa or Arya can do will trump that experience or knowledge. Third of all, Jon is (or will be, if we\u2019re talking the books) alive, and he has extensive experience in leadership and northern-based politics. Sticking Arya and Sansa in these roles (at least right now) makes zero sense when their  remaining brothers have a combined political career that has dealt with battle, food rations, delegation, execution, sacrifice, negotiations, etc. </p>",
