If someone had told her that she was to fall in love with The Winter Soldier three years ago, she would have reacted with a grimace and a snarky remark. The mere thought would have been revolting. Y/N\u2019s hatred for Bucky Barnes stemmed from her gut wrenching hatred for SHIELD. It all started with a simple rejection letter.</p><p>\u201c<i>-we regret to inform you that you\u2019re application has been denied for all intensive purposes that fall under SHIELD\u2019s disclosure-</i>\u201d Y/N guffawed, slamming the manila file on the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cAre you <i>kidding </i>me? I have met every single qualification. How could they reject my fucking application?\u201d She seethed, gripping her hair in frustration. Her roommate, Talia, remained quiet. She picked up the paper and flattened it out.<br/></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s odd,\u201d Talia squinted at the paper.<br/></p><p>\u201cThey never mentioned anything about \u2018SHIELD\u2019s disclosure\u2019 in my letter.\u201d She mumbled. Y/N huffed, crossing her arms in indignation.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you got an offer! You\u2019re an agent.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s because you\u2019re working for the CIA? SHIELD takes their loyalties very seriously.\u201d Talia stated, ignoring Y/N\u2019s remark.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got too much intel with the government. They can\u2019t risk recruiting someone with <i>that </i>much power.\u201d She added, nudging Y/N. Y/N smiled softly</p><p>\u201cAppealing to my ego doesn\u2019t make this any-\u201d Y/N stopped abruptly, an idea germinating in her mind.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve got an idea.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI doubt it\u2019s a good one.\u201d<br/></p><p>Y/N found herself facing the doors of the Avengers Tower twenty minutes later. <i>They can reject me all they want but I am not going to take no for an answer. </i>The front desk was surprisingly empty and she found herself waiting in the lobby for awhile. That was until a familiar super soldier made his way towards the elevator before peering at her. Y/N held her breath.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d<br/></p><p>Bucky stared at her, his gaze unwavering. He looked different than what she had seen on tv. His hair was a warmer shade of brown and bundled at the nape of his neck. His eyes were lighter, a piercing cerulean blue. Y/N thought that the news channels altered his appearance significantly, making him look like he was surrounded by a cloak of exhaustion. He truly looked like a Roman statue carved out of limestone. Bucky cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to talk to Maria Hill.\u201d Y/N sputtered, slowly getting up. His gaze seemed to melt into a glare and she began to think he disliked her.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s on her lunch break. She\u2019ll be back in twenty minutes.\u201d He replied curtly. Y/N nodded. Bucky didn\u2019t move and neither did she.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat are you here for?\u201d He asked after a moment. Y/N fumbled for the paper in her pocket, handing it to him.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to sort this out.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cSeems to me like you\u2019ve been rejected.\u201d He said monotonously, gazing at her again. His demeanor hadn\u2019t changed. Y/N swallowed.<br/></p><p>\u201cI plan to change that.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cGood luck. SHIELD rarely takes rookies. Doubt you have the chops to get in.\u201d<br/></p><p>And with that he had disappeared. Y/N had decided from that moment onward that she loathed Bucky Barnes. He may be an Avenger, a hero, an icon, but he was a jerk in her eyes. An extremely handsome jerk.</p><p>Y/N had met Bucky several times later that month. At the supermarket. At the ATM. At the boardwalk. And <i>every time</i> he had taken the opportunity to harass her about her rejection letter. It was rude. He was well aware of that. But he couldn\u2019t help himself. He was well aware she was a CIA agent. He was well aware that she had a high ranking. And he was well aware that SHIELD rejected her simply because of her allegiances. But he found it amusing that every time he brought it up, she would curl her lip in disgust and snap at him. <i>She was cute</i>. He\u2019d never her tell her that though.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c-he keeps finding me! I don\u2019t know how! I should file a restraining order against him.\u201d Y/N grumbled, smoothing the velvet dress down her hips. Talia simply laughed in response, gingerly applying red lipstick. The two of them had been cordially invited to a <i>Philanthropic Gala for all Agencies</i> tonight. Tony Stark had made a special request that the two attend.\u00a0 At first, Y/N accepted only to later realize that the place would be swarming with press, Avengers, and agents. More specifically SHIELD agents. It was a scene she definitely didn\u2019t belong to nor want to be apart of. But Talia convinced her otherwise and here she stood, clad in a beautiful myrtle green gown, minutes away from a social event that would be the death of her.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so dramatic. And who wouldn\u2019t want to be stalked by <i>the </i>Bucky Barnes. The man is basically a living breathing Greek God. Who knows, maybe tonight is your lucky night.\u201d Talia winked, bumping her hip. Y/N fake gagged, following her best friend outside. The last thing she had hoped to see tonight was <i>that </i>man. She decided she would enjoy herself. A couple of mint juleps and some flirtatious remarks should do the trick. She\u2019d ignore him. Hell, she wouldn\u2019t even see him. Y/N decided he wouldn\u2019t even make an appearance tonight.<br/></p><p>The moment she entered the mansion, she knew she was wrong. Very very wrong. Bucky stood in the center of the ballroom, wearing a black Armani suit. Y/N wished her eyes didn\u2019t linger as long as they did. Bucky noticed her presence a moment later, his blue eyes lazily trailed her body, almost as if he were drinking in her appearance. He raised his flute of champagne as a salute and smirked. Y/N pursed her lips and strode away.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI want to go home.\u201d She muttered once she had found Talia.</p><p>\u201cW-What? Y/N, we just got here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I know but he\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so childish, there\u2019s thousands of people here. I doubt he will have the chance to talk to you. Spend more time admiring the place than staring at him okay? It looks like Jay Gatsby threw this party. \u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Y/N looked at her friend incredulously, before watching her walk towards the buffet. She was right. Tony had definitely outdone himself. The rented mansion looked luxurious with the extravagant chandeliers and live symphonic music. It really did look like a Gatsby themed party. For the next hour, Y/N conversed with Talia\u2019s teammates, trying to ignore the burning feeling in the pit of her stomach every time they brought up SHIELD. It had been a month since Maria Hill told her she couldn\u2019t change Director Fury\u2019s decision. It\u2019s been a month and it still hurt.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou seem like a woman who\u2019s dying to get out of this place.\u201d<br/></p><p>Y/N turned around at the gravely voice. A tall lanky man stood before her, He offered a lopsided grin.</p><p>\u201cNolan Irvine. May I have this dance?\u201d<br/></p><p>Y/N smiled, taking his hand. Bucky watched from afar, feeling his stomach turn at the sight. An unexplained feeling of jealousy blossomed in his chest and he wished he could look away. Yet his eyes were glued to the couple. Nolan was strange, Y/N could tell right off the bat. He filled their conversation with corny jokes and gripped her waist a little too tight when she didn\u2019t give him the reaction he had wanted.</p><p>\u201cI think I need a drink. If you would excuse me-\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAwww no. My favorite song just came on. You owe me just one more dance.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Y/N glared at him, suddenly turning rigid in his grasp. His brown eyes peered at her menacingly, almost daring her to do something.</p><p>\u201cI do not owe you anything.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>She squeezed his shoulder harder than he had been squeezing her waist. Maybe slightly too hard. Nolan shrieked at the tight squeeze, shrugging away from her. Y/N simply twirled, grasping a flute from one of the waiters silver platters and disappearing into the sea of couples. She watched from the corner, eyeing Nolan from afar. He approached other women only to be rejected. She couldn\u2019t help but smirk.<br/></p><p>\u201cThat was quite a show.\u201d<br/></p><p>Bucky had found her. Y/N shut her eyes.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re referring to the asshole I danced with awhile ago, then I\u2019d tell you that was only a teaser of what would happen.\u201d<br/></p><p>Bucky quietly laughed and Y/N found herself smiling.</p><p>\u201cWell, how about I redeem your night by asking for a dance?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAnd how exactly will that redeem my night?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ll be dancing with me.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cHow cocky.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNot cocky, just honest.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAre you going to bring up my rejection letter?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cDepends.\u201d<br/></p><p>Y/N glared at him and he laughed, lifting his arms up.</p><p>\u201cOkay okay I won\u2019t. I promise.\u201d<br/></p><p>Y/N weighed her options. Talia had already found a date and it would be a good two hours until this party ended. If she stayed in her spot, it would be only a matter of time till Nolan or someone worse found her. <i>I could give him a piece of my mind</i>. She shook her head and studied Bucky. His hair was slicked back and his lips looked alarmingly pink tonight. Y/N found herself staring, wondering if they felt as soft as they looked. She blinked, It\u2019s the alcohol. Definitely the alcohol.</p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d<br/></p><p>Bucky was a surprisingly good dancer, much to Y/N\u2019s surprise. He expertly twirled her and moved with confidence to the beat of the music.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou can dance.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou sound shocked.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know jerks could dance.\u201d<br/></p><p>Bucky looked at her, slightly appalled.</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m a jerk?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been harassing me for the past month, Barnes.\u201d<br/></p><p>He frowned.</p><p>\u201cI saw it more as teasing. I apologize.\u201d<br/></p><p>And the rest of the conversation was a blur of flirtatious comments and amusing remarks. He held Y/N close. She was intoxicating in every way and the two of them found themselves not wanting the night to end. Talia had ended up leaving earlier with her date and informed Y/N with a text and a promise of breakfast on her the following morning. Bucky offered to walk her home.</p><p>\u201cI had fun tonight.\u201d He mumbled.<br/></p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say the same.\u201d She replied, leaning on the door frame. The two chuckled softly before falling in a comfortable silence. Y/N was buzzing, either from the alcohol or Bucky. She couldn\u2019t tell but she didn\u2019t want the feeling to go away.</p><p>\u201cWould it be weird to kiss you right now?\u201d He asked after a moment. Y/N froze, her voice betraying her. She shook her head and Bucky took the small gesture as a yes, bending his head and tentatively pressing his lips onto hers. His lips were warm and tasted sweet. Y/N hummed against him, almost sighing with relief. His hands cupped her jaw softly and Y/N tugged at the collar of his suit almost as if to brace herself. He broke away.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you later, yeah?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cLater\u201d turned into a date, and one date turned into many. Before they knew it, the two were engaged and later married.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI still can\u2019t believe you hated me.\u201d Bucky mumbled, filing through the mail.<br/></p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hate you, I hated the fact that you have history with SHIELD.\u201d Y/N responded, wrapping her arms around his waist. The two had spent the morning recounting their history as a means of passing time.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cRight, so pent up anger on an agency correlates with being angry at a random guy.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou brought up my rejection every time we met!\u201d She responded, pressing ghost kisses against his neck.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t get why you were so hooked on SHIELD. It was just a rejected letter.\u201d Bucky said, Y/N froze, removing her arms from his waist.<br/></p><p>\u201cBucky, joining SHIELD was my dream. I spent my college years prepping for that application. I trained myself just so I snag a chance at becoming an agent.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWell, that was a dream well wasted and dumb. You could be saving lives and instead you\u2019re doin paperwork\u201d<br/></p><p>Y/N froze, her heart dipping. Bucky\u2019s gaze remained on the mail.</p><p>\u201cW-What?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cDoll, your job is practically a water downed version of a SHIELD agent. Your better off working some other 9-5 job. Forget the dream, it was pretty dumb anyways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake that back.\u201d Y/N said slowly. She felt her throat constrict.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat? I\u2019m speaking the truth. Sometimes I feel kind of embarrassed telling the guys your a CIA agent. Everyone knows you just shag officials for intel and call it a case that\u2019s worth working on.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you think, why don\u2019t you just go find someone who\u2019s got a more worthy job.\u201d Y/N snapped. Bucky looked at her.<br/></p><p>\u201cOh come on, don\u2019t be like that. I was just talking to the guys earlier and that\u2019s the kind of shit-\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou called my dream a waste.\u201d Y/N said slowly, gazing at him. Tears began to well in her eyes.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m being honest, Y/N.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cThen leave.\u201d<br/></p><p>Bucky froze, irritation evident on his face.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you have to be so fucking difficult all the time? I feel like I\u2019m constantly walking on eggshells.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen fucking leave you douche bag, maybe it\u2019ll make you feel better!\u201d The tears were now pouring and Y/N hated herself for it.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cIf you just considered for a second what I said-\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou literally told me my dream is shit and I should move on. That I\u2019m <i>embarrassing </i>you? God, Bucky you\u2019re supposed to support my decisions! Not fucking drag them. Is that not what comes with loving your partner-\u201d<br/></p><p><i>\u201cThen maybe I don\u2019t fucking love you.\u201d</i><br/></p><p>He regretted it the moment the sentence left his lips. He watched Y/N\u2019s face fall. Her chin began to quiver. He wanted to punch himself over and over and over again.</p><p>\u00a0She staggered to their bedroom and locked the door. Bucky raced after her, banging on the door. He could hear her sobs and small hiccups. Each cry was like bullet to the heart and he desperately wanted to apologize. Y/N didn\u2019t budge for the next hour and Bucky\u2019s voice grew hoarse from calling out to her. He was irritated that morning. Sam was joking around, poking fun at the CIA. Eventually Y/N\u2019s name came up. Bucky knew it was a joke but he couldn\u2019t help but feel the sting when Sam poked fun at Y/N. He had called Sam out for it but it had clouded his mind for the rest of the morning. Now he let his mouth run and was paying the price.\u00a0</p><p>Bucky tried to pry the door open several hours later. Surprisingly, the door knob gave in. Y/N was in bed, the sheets covering her body. The moonlight cast a sad glow and he could see her tear stained cheeks from where he stood. Bucky was overcome with guilt and slowly approached the bed. He sat beside Y/N\u2019s sleeping figure and softly cradled her cheek. She shot up awake, breathing hard.</p><p>\u201cBuck-\u201d She whispered, clearly distraught. Bucky frowned. <i>She had a nightmare</i>.<br/></p><p>\u201cGod, Y/N. I am so sorry-\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t-\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust please let me explain myself.\u201d He whispered, his eyes pleading. Y/N looked away, shrugging from his grasp.<br/></p><p>\u201cSam was joking about the rivalry between the CIA and SHIELD this morning. I knew he was kidding around but he referred to your job and it just got to me. I am so fucking sorry, I am so incredibly wrong for saying those things. You\u2019re dream means everything to me. You mean everything to me. I am so sorry, I should not have blown up at you. It was wrong and I love you- God, I love you so much.\u201d Bucky bent his head.<br/></p><p>\u201cI am not asking for forgiveness but I just want you to know I am so incredibly sorry.\u201d He rasped. Y/N took a deep breath and grabbed his arm. Bucky looked at her and she could see the sorrow behind his glassy blue eyes. She leaned closer to him, brushing her fingers against his cheekbones.<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. You fucked up. But you apologized and that\u2019s important. Just don\u2019t be an asshole ever again?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou have my word.\u201d He mumbled. Y/N leaned into kiss him, grasping his metal arm for support. It started slow and Bucky could taste the salty tears on her lips. He broke away.<br/></p><p>\u201cI am so fucking sorry Y/N.\u201d<br/></p><p>She wound her hands in his hair and tugged him closer to her. He crawled on top of her, kissing her softly. Slowly the kisses turned more ragged and Y/N found herself rolling her hips against him. He removed his clothes wordlessly as did she, the two focused on feeling each other. Bucky kissed every inch of her body, following her movements to guide his mouth.</p><p>\u201cBuck-\u201d Y/N muttered, cradling his face. He took that as approval and slowly entered her, placing his forehead against hers. Y/N moaned at the feeling, adjusting to his size. Bucky muttered apologies and\u00a0\u2018i love you\u2019s\u2019 into each thrust and Y/N clutched onto his shoulders, feeling a euphoric wave spread across her body. Slowly, the two of them became more rigid before coming undone.</p><p>\u201cI love you, you know that right?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYes Buck. It\u2019s not like you told me a hundred times already.\u201d Y/N said softly, a glowing smile on her face. Bucky pressed his lips against hers.<br/></p><p>requested: @j<a href=\"https://jensenackles441.tumblr.com/\">ensenackles441</a></p><p><b>permanent taglist</b> (you can request to be added or taken off!): <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYnxNKioOY3cLPsoD91rItQ\">@dewy-biitch</a></p>",

Y/N smiled softly</p><p>\u201cAppealing to my ego doesn\u2019t make this any-\u201d Y/N stopped abruptly, an idea germinating in her mind.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve got an idea.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI doubt it\u2019s a good one.\u201d<br></p><p>Y/N found herself facing the doors of the Avengers Tower twenty minutes later. <i>They can reject me all they want but I am not going to take no for an answer. </i>The front desk was surprisingly empty and she found herself waiting in the lobby for awhile. That was until a familiar super soldier made his way towards the elevator before peering at her. Y/N held her breath.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d<br></p><p>Bucky stared at her, his gaze unwavering. He looked different than what she had seen on tv. His hair was a warmer shade of brown and bundled at the nape of his neck. His eyes were lighter, a piercing cerulean blue. Y/N thought that the news channels altered his appearance significantly, making him look like he was surrounded by a cloak of exhaustion. He truly looked like a Roman statue carved out of limestone. Bucky cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to talk to Maria Hill.\u201d Y/N sputtered, slowly getting up. His gaze seemed to melt into a glare and she began to think he disliked her.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s on her lunch break. She\u2019ll be back in twenty minutes.\u201d He replied curtly. Y/N nodded. Bucky didn\u2019t move and neither did she.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat are you here for?\u201d He asked after a moment. Y/N fumbled for the paper in her pocket, handing it to him.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to sort this out.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSeems to me like you\u2019ve been rejected.\u201d He said monotonously, gazing at her again. His demeanor hadn\u2019t changed. Y/N swallowed.<br></p><p>\u201cI plan to change that.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cGood luck. SHIELD rarely takes rookies. Doubt you have the chops to get in.\u201d<br></p><p>And with that he had disappeared. Y/N had decided from that moment onward that she loathed Bucky Barnes. He may be an Avenger, a hero, an icon, but he was a jerk in her eyes. An extremely handsome jerk.</p><p>Y/N had met Bucky several times later that month. At the supermarket. At the ATM. At the boardwalk. And <i>every time</i> he had taken the opportunity to harass her about her rejection letter. It was rude. He was well aware of that. But he couldn\u2019t help himself. He was well aware she was a CIA agent. He was well aware that she had a high ranking. And he was well aware that SHIELD rejected her simply because of her allegiances. But he found it amusing that every time he brought it up, she would curl her lip in disgust and snap at him. <i>She was cute</i>. He\u2019d never her tell her that though.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c-he keeps finding me! I don\u2019t know how! I should file a restraining order against him.\u201d Y/N grumbled, smoothing the velvet dress down her hips. Talia simply laughed in response, gingerly applying red lipstick. The two of them had been cordially invited to a <i>Philanthropic Gala for all Agencies</i> tonight. Tony Stark had made a special request that the two attend.\u00a0 At first, Y/N accepted only to later realize that the place would be swarming with press, Avengers, and agents. More specifically SHIELD agents. It was a scene she definitely didn\u2019t belong to nor want to be apart of. But Talia convinced her otherwise and here she stood, clad in a beautiful myrtle green gown, minutes away from a social event that would be the death of her.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so dramatic. And who wouldn\u2019t want to be stalked by <i>the </i>Bucky Barnes. The man is basically a living breathing Greek God. Who knows, maybe tonight is your lucky night.\u201d Talia winked, bumping her hip. Y/N fake gagged, following her best friend outside. The last thing she had hoped to see tonight was <i>that </i>man. She decided she would enjoy herself. A couple of mint juleps and some flirtatious remarks should do the trick. She\u2019d ignore him. Hell, she wouldn\u2019t even see him. Y/N decided he wouldn\u2019t even make an appearance tonight.<br></p><p>The moment she entered the mansion, she knew she was wrong. Very very wrong. Bucky stood in the center of the ballroom, wearing a black Armani suit. Y/N wished her eyes didn\u2019t linger as long as they did. Bucky noticed her presence a moment later, his blue eyes lazily trailed her body, almost as if he were drinking in her appearance. He raised his flute of champagne as a salute and smirked. Y/N pursed her lips and strode away.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI want to go home.\u201d She muttered once she had found Talia.</p><p>\u201cW-What? Y/N, we just got here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I know but he\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so childish, there\u2019s thousands of people here. I doubt he will have the chance to talk to you. Spend more time admiring the place than staring at him okay? It looks like Jay Gatsby threw this party. \u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Y/N looked at her friend incredulously, before watching her walk towards the buffet. She was right. Tony had definitely outdone himself. The rented mansion looked luxurious with the extravagant chandeliers and live symphonic music. It really did look like a Gatsby themed party. For the next hour, Y/N conversed with Talia\u2019s teammates, trying to ignore the burning feeling in the pit of her stomach every time they brought up SHIELD. It had been a month since Maria Hill told her she couldn\u2019t change Director Fury\u2019s decision. It\u2019s been a month and it still hurt.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou seem like a woman who\u2019s dying to get out of this place.\u201d<br></p><p>Y/N turned around at the gravely voice. A tall lanky man stood before her, He offered a lopsided grin.</p><p>\u201cNolan Irvine. May I have this dance?\u201d<br></p><p>Y/N smiled, taking his hand. Bucky watched from afar, feeling his stomach turn at the sight. An unexplained feeling of jealousy blossomed in his chest and he wished he could look away. Yet his eyes were glued to the couple. Nolan was strange, Y/N could tell right off the bat. He filled their conversation with corny jokes and gripped her waist a little too tight when she didn\u2019t give him the reaction he had wanted.</p><p>\u201cI think I need a drink. If you would excuse me-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAwww no. My favorite song just came on. You owe me just one more dance.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Y/N glared at him, suddenly turning rigid in his grasp. His brown eyes peered at her menacingly, almost daring her to do something.</p><p>\u201cI do not owe you anything.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>She squeezed his shoulder harder than he had been squeezing her waist. Maybe slightly too hard. Nolan shrieked at the tight squeeze, shrugging away from her. Y/N simply twirled, grasping a flute from one of the waiters silver platters and disappearing into the sea of couples. She watched from the corner, eyeing Nolan from afar. He approached other women only to be rejected. She couldn\u2019t help but smirk.<br></p><p>\u201cThat was quite a show.\u201d<br></p><p>Bucky had found her. Y/N shut her eyes.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re referring to the asshole I danced with awhile ago, then I\u2019d tell you that was only a teaser of what would happen.\u201d<br></p><p>Bucky quietly laughed and Y/N found herself smiling.</p><p>\u201cWell, how about I redeem your night by asking for a dance?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAnd how exactly will that redeem my night?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ll be dancing with me.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cHow cocky.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNot cocky, just honest.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAre you going to bring up my rejection letter?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDepends.\u201d<br></p><p>Y/N glared at him and he laughed, lifting his arms up.</p><p>\u201cOkay okay I won\u2019t. I promise.\u201d<br></p><p>Y/N weighed her options. Talia had already found a date and it would be a good two hours until this party ended. If she stayed in her spot, it would be only a matter of time till Nolan or someone worse found her. <i>I could give him a piece of my mind</i>. She shook her head and studied Bucky. His hair was slicked back and his lips looked alarmingly pink tonight. Y/N found herself staring, wondering if they felt as soft as they looked. She blinked, It\u2019s the alcohol. Definitely the alcohol.</p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d<br></p><p>Bucky was a surprisingly good dancer, much to Y/N\u2019s surprise. He expertly twirled her and moved with confidence to the beat of the music.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou can dance.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou sound shocked.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know jerks could dance.\u201d<br></p><p>Bucky looked at her, slightly appalled.</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m a jerk?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been harassing me for the past month, Barnes.\u201d<br></p><p>He frowned.</p><p>\u201cI saw it more as teasing. I apologize.\u201d<br></p><p>And the rest of the conversation was a blur of flirtatious comments and amusing remarks. He held Y/N close. She was intoxicating in every way and the two of them found themselves not wanting the night to end. Talia had ended up leaving earlier with her date and informed Y/N with a text and a promise of breakfast on her the following morning. Bucky offered to walk her home.</p><p>\u201cI had fun tonight.\u201d He mumbled.<br></p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say the same.\u201d She replied, leaning on the door frame. The two chuckled softly before falling in a comfortable silence. Y/N was buzzing, either from the alcohol or Bucky. She couldn\u2019t tell but she didn\u2019t want the feeling to go away.</p><p>\u201cWould it be weird to kiss you right now?\u201d He asked after a moment. Y/N froze, her voice betraying her. She shook her head and Bucky took the small gesture as a yes, bending his head and tentatively pressing his lips onto hers. His lips were warm and tasted sweet. Y/N hummed against him, almost sighing with relief. His hands cupped her jaw softly and Y/N tugged at the collar of his suit almost as if to brace herself. He broke away.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you later, yeah?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cLater\u201d turned into a date, and one date turned into many. Before they knew it, the two were engaged and later married.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI still can\u2019t believe you hated me.\u201d Bucky mumbled, filing through the mail.<br></p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hate you, I hated the fact that you have history with SHIELD.\u201d Y/N responded, wrapping her arms around his waist. The two had spent the morning recounting their history as a means of passing time.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cRight, so pent up anger on an agency correlates with being angry at a random guy.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou brought up my rejection every time we met!\u201d She responded, pressing ghost kisses against his neck.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t get why you were so hooked on SHIELD. It was just a rejected letter.\u201d Bucky said, Y/N froze, removing her arms from his waist.<br></p><p>\u201cBucky, joining SHIELD was my dream. I spent my college years prepping for that application. I trained myself just so I snag a chance at becoming an agent.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWell, that was a dream well wasted and dumb. You could be saving lives and instead you\u2019re doin paperwork\u201d<br></p><p>Y/N froze, her heart dipping. Bucky\u2019s gaze remained on the mail.</p><p>\u201cW-What?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDoll, your job is practically a water downed version of a SHIELD agent. Your better off working some other 9-5 job. Forget the dream, it was pretty dumb anyways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake that back.\u201d Y/N said slowly. She felt her throat constrict.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat? I\u2019m speaking the truth. Sometimes I feel kind of embarrassed telling the guys your a CIA agent. Everyone knows you just shag officials for intel and call it a case that\u2019s worth working on.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you think, why don\u2019t you just go find someone who\u2019s got a more worthy job.\u201d Y/N snapped. Bucky looked at her.<br></p><p>\u201cOh come on, don\u2019t be like that. I was just talking to the guys earlier and that\u2019s the kind of shit-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou called my dream a waste.\u201d Y/N said slowly, gazing at him. Tears began to well in her eyes.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m being honest, Y/N.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThen leave.\u201d<br></p><p>Bucky froze, irritation evident on his face.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you have to be so fucking difficult all the time? I feel like I\u2019m constantly walking on eggshells.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen fucking leave you douche bag, maybe it\u2019ll make you feel better!\u201d The tears were now pouring and Y/N hated herself for it.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIf you just considered for a second what I said-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou literally told me my dream is shit and I should move on. That I\u2019m <i>embarrassing </i>you? God, Bucky you\u2019re supposed to support my decisions! Not fucking drag them. Is that not what comes with loving your partner-\u201d<br></p><p><i>\u201cThen maybe I don\u2019t fucking love you.\u201d</i><br></p><p>He regretted it the moment the sentence left his lips. He watched Y/N\u2019s face fall. Her chin began to quiver. He wanted to punch himself over and over and over again.</p><p>\u00a0She staggered to their bedroom and locked the door. Bucky raced after her, banging on the door. He could hear her sobs and small hiccups. Each cry was like bullet to the heart and he desperately wanted to apologize. Y/N didn\u2019t budge for the next hour and Bucky\u2019s voice grew hoarse from calling out to her. He was irritated that morning. Sam was joking around, poking fun at the CIA. Eventually Y/N\u2019s name came up. Bucky knew it was a joke but he couldn\u2019t help but feel the sting when Sam poked fun at Y/N. He had called Sam out for it but it had clouded his mind for the rest of the morning. Now he let his mouth run and was paying the price.\u00a0</p><p>Bucky tried to pry the door open several hours later. Surprisingly, the door knob gave in. Y/N was in bed, the sheets covering her body. The moonlight cast a sad glow and he could see her tear stained cheeks from where he stood. Bucky was overcome with guilt and slowly approached the bed. He sat beside Y/N\u2019s sleeping figure and softly cradled her cheek. She shot up awake, breathing hard.</p><p>\u201cBuck-\u201d She whispered, clearly distraught. Bucky frowned. <i>She had a nightmare</i>.<br></p><p>\u201cGod, Y/N. I am so sorry-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t-\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust please let me explain myself.\u201d He whispered, his eyes pleading. Y/N looked away, shrugging from his grasp.<br></p><p>\u201cSam was joking about the rivalry between the CIA and SHIELD this morning. I knew he was kidding around but he referred to your job and it just got to me. I am so fucking sorry, I am so incredibly wrong for saying those things. You\u2019re dream means everything to me. You mean everything to me. I am so sorry, I should not have blown up at you. It was wrong and I love you- God, I love you so much.\u201d Bucky bent his head.<br></p><p>\u201cI am not asking for forgiveness but I just want you to know I am so incredibly sorry.\u201d He rasped. Y/N took a deep breath and grabbed his arm. Bucky looked at her and she could see the sorrow behind his glassy blue eyes. She leaned closer to him, brushing her fingers against his cheekbones.<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. You fucked up. But you apologized and that\u2019s important. Just don\u2019t be an asshole ever again?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou have my word.\u201d He mumbled. Y/N leaned into kiss him, grasping his metal arm for support. It started slow and Bucky could taste the salty tears on her lips. He broke away.<br></p><p>\u201cI am so fucking sorry Y/N.\u201d<br></p><p>She wound her hands in his hair and tugged him closer to her. He crawled on top of her, kissing her softly. Slowly the kisses turned more ragged and Y/N found herself rolling her hips against him. He removed his clothes wordlessly as did she, the two focused on feeling each other. Bucky kissed every inch of her body, following her movements to guide his mouth.</p><p>\u201cBuck-\u201d Y/N muttered, cradling his face. He took that as approval and slowly entered her, placing his forehead against hers. Y/N moaned at the feeling, adjusting to his size. Bucky muttered apologies and\u00a0\u2018i love you\u2019s\u2019 into each thrust and Y/N clutched onto his shoulders, feeling a euphoric wave spread across her body. Slowly, the two of them became more rigid before coming undone.</p><p>\u201cI love you, you know that right?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYes Buck. It\u2019s not like you told me a hundred times already.\u201d Y/N said softly, a glowing smile on her face. Bucky pressed his lips against hers.<br></p><p>requested: @j<a href=\"https://jensenackles441.tumblr.com/\">ensenackles441</a></p><p><b>permanent taglist</b> (you can request to be added or taken off!): <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYnxNKioOY3cLPsoD91rItQ\">@dewy-biitch</a></p>",

If someone had told her that she was to fall in love with The Winter Soldier three years ago, she would have reacted with a grimace and a snarky remark. The mere thought would have been revolting. Y/N\u2019s hatred for Bucky Barnes stemmed from her gut wrenching hatred for SHIELD. It all started with a simple rejection letter.</p><p>\u201c<i>-we regret to inform you that you\u2019re application has been denied for all intensive purposes that fall under SHIELD\u2019s disclosure-</i>\u201d Y/N guffawed, slamming the manila file on the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cAre you <i>kidding </i>me?

You\u2019re an agent.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s because you\u2019re working for the CIA?

Y/N fumbled for the paper in her pocket, handing it to him.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to sort this out.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSeems to me like you\u2019ve been rejected.\u201d He said monotonously, gazing at her again. His demeanor hadn\u2019t changed. Y/N swallowed.<br></p><p>\u201cI plan to change that.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cGood luck. SHIELD rarely takes rookies. Doubt you have the chops to get in.\u201d<br></p><p>And with that he had disappeared. Y/N had decided from that moment onward that she loathed Bucky Barnes. He may be an Avenger, a hero, an icon, but he was a jerk in her eyes. An extremely handsome jerk.</p><p>Y/N had met Bucky several times later that month. At the supermarket. At the ATM. At the boardwalk. And <i>every time</i> he had taken the opportunity to harass her about her rejection letter. It was rude. He was well aware of that. But he couldn\u2019t help himself. He was well aware she was a CIA agent. He was well aware that she had a high ranking. And he was well aware that SHIELD rejected her simply because of her allegiances. But he found it amusing that every time he brought it up, she would curl her lip in disgust and snap at him. <i>She was cute</i>. He\u2019d never her tell her that though.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c-he keeps finding me! I don\u2019t know how! I should file a restraining order against him.\u201d Y/N grumbled, smoothing the velvet dress down her hips. Talia simply laughed in response, gingerly applying red lipstick. The two of them had been cordially invited to a <i>Philanthropic Gala for all Agencies</i> tonight. Tony Stark had made a special request that the two attend.\u00a0 At first, Y/N accepted only to later realize that the place would be swarming with press, Avengers, and agents. More specifically SHIELD agents. It was a scene she definitely didn\u2019t belong to nor want to be apart of. But Talia convinced her otherwise and here she stood, clad in a beautiful myrtle green gown, minutes away from a social event that would be the death of her.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so dramatic. And who wouldn\u2019t want to be stalked by <i>the </i>Bucky Barnes. The man is basically a living breathing Greek God. Who knows, maybe tonight is your lucky night.\u201d Talia winked, bumping her hip. Y/N fake gagged, following her best friend outside. The last thing she had hoped to see tonight was <i>that </i>man. She decided she would enjoy herself. A couple of mint juleps and some flirtatious remarks should do the trick. She\u2019d ignore him. Hell, she wouldn\u2019t even see him. Y/N decided he wouldn\u2019t even make an appearance tonight.<br></p><p>The moment she entered the mansion, she knew she was wrong. Very very wrong. Bucky stood in the center of the ballroom, wearing a black Armani suit. Y/N wished her eyes didn\u2019t linger as long as they did. Bucky noticed her presence a moment later, his blue eyes lazily trailed her body, almost as if he were drinking in her appearance. He raised his flute of champagne as a salute and smirked. Y/N pursed her lips and strode away.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI want to go home.\u201d She muttered once she had found Talia.</p><p>\u201cW-What? Y/N, we just got here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I know but he\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so childish, there\u2019s thousands of people here. I doubt he will have the chance to talk to you. Spend more time admiring the place than staring at him okay? It looks like Jay Gatsby threw this party. \u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Y/N looked at her friend incredulously, before watching her walk towards the buffet. She was right. Tony had definitely outdone himself. The rented mansion looked luxurious with the extravagant chandeliers and live symphonic music. It really did look like a Gatsby themed party. For the next hour, Y/N conversed with Talia\u2019s teammates, trying to ignore the burning feeling in the pit of her stomach every time they brought up SHIELD. It had been a month since Maria Hill told her she couldn\u2019t change Director Fury\u2019s decision. It\u2019s been a month and it still hurt.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou seem like a woman who\u2019s dying to get out of this place.\u201d<br></p><p>Y/N turned around at the gravely voice. A tall lanky man stood before her, He offered a lopsided grin.</p><p>\u201cNolan Irvine. May I have this dance?\u201d<br></p><p>Y/N smiled, taking his hand. Bucky watched from afar, feeling his stomach turn at the sight. An unexplained feeling of jealousy blossomed in his chest and he wished he could look away. Yet his eyes were glued to the couple. Nolan was strange, Y/N could tell right off the bat. He filled their conversation with corny jokes and gripped her waist a little too tight when she didn\u2019t give him the reaction he had wanted.</p><p>\u201cI think I need a drink. If you would excuse me-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAwww no. My favorite song just came on. You owe me just one more dance.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Y/N glared at him, suddenly turning rigid in his grasp. His brown eyes peered at her menacingly, almost daring her to do something.</p><p>\u201cI do not owe you anything.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>She squeezed his shoulder harder than he had been squeezing her waist. Maybe slightly too hard. Nolan shrieked at the tight squeeze, shrugging away from her. Y/N simply twirled, grasping a flute from one of the waiters silver platters and disappearing into the sea of couples. She watched from the corner, eyeing Nolan from afar. He approached other women only to be rejected. She couldn\u2019t help but smirk.<br></p><p>\u201cThat was quite a show.\u201d<br></p><p>Bucky had found her. Y/N shut her eyes.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re referring to the asshole I danced with awhile ago, then I\u2019d tell you that was only a teaser of what would happen.\u201d<br></p><p>Bucky quietly laughed and Y/N found herself smiling.</p><p>\u201cWell, how about I redeem your night by asking for a dance?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAnd how exactly will that redeem my night?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ll be dancing with me.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cHow cocky.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNot cocky, just honest.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAre you going to bring up my rejection letter?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDepends.\u201d<br></p><p>Y/N glared at him and he laughed, lifting his arms up.</p><p>\u201cOkay okay I won\u2019t. I promise.\u201d<br></p><p>Y/N weighed her options. Talia had already found a date and it would be a good two hours until this party ended. If she stayed in her spot, it would be only a matter of time till Nolan or someone worse found her. <i>I could give him a piece of my mind</i>. She shook her head and studied Bucky. His hair was slicked back and his lips looked alarmingly pink tonight. Y/N found herself staring, wondering if they felt as soft as they looked. She blinked, It\u2019s the alcohol. Definitely the alcohol.</p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d<br></p><p>Bucky was a surprisingly good dancer, much to Y/N\u2019s surprise. He expertly twirled her and moved with confidence to the beat of the music.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou can dance.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou sound shocked.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know jerks could dance.\u201d<br></p><p>Bucky looked at her, slightly appalled.</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m a jerk?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been harassing me for the past month, Barnes.\u201d<br></p><p>He frowned.</p><p>\u201cI saw it more as teasing. I apologize.\u201d<br></p><p>And the rest of the conversation was a blur of flirtatious comments and amusing remarks. He held Y/N close. She was intoxicating in every way and the two of them found themselves not wanting the night to end. Talia had ended up leaving earlier with her date and informed Y/N with a text and a promise of breakfast on her the following morning. Bucky offered to walk her home.</p><p>\u201cI had fun tonight.\u201d He mumbled.<br></p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say the same.\u201d She replied, leaning on the door frame. The two chuckled softly before falling in a comfortable silence. Y/N was buzzing, either from the alcohol or Bucky. She couldn\u2019t tell but she didn\u2019t want the feeling to go away.</p><p>\u201cWould it be weird to kiss you right now?\u201d He asked after a moment. Y/N froze, her voice betraying her. She shook her head and Bucky took the small gesture as a yes, bending his head and tentatively pressing his lips onto hers. His lips were warm and tasted sweet. Y/N hummed against him, almost sighing with relief. His hands cupped her jaw softly and Y/N tugged at the collar of his suit almost as if to brace herself. He broke away.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you later, yeah?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cLater\u201d turned into a date, and one date turned into many. Before they knew it, the two were engaged and later married.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI still can\u2019t believe you hated me.\u201d Bucky mumbled, filing through the mail.<br></p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hate you, I hated the fact that you have history with SHIELD.\u201d Y/N responded, wrapping her arms around his waist. The two had spent the morning recounting their history as a means of passing time.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cRight, so pent up anger on an agency correlates with being angry at a random guy.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou brought up my rejection every time we met!\u201d She responded, pressing ghost kisses against his neck.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t get why you were so hooked on SHIELD. It was just a rejected letter.\u201d Bucky said, Y/N froze, removing her arms from his waist.<br></p><p>\u201cBucky, joining SHIELD was my dream. I spent my college years prepping for that application. I trained myself just so I snag a chance at becoming an agent.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWell, that was a dream well wasted and dumb. You could be saving lives and instead you\u2019re doin paperwork\u201d<br></p><p>Y/N froze, her heart dipping. Bucky\u2019s gaze remained on the mail.</p><p>\u201cW-What?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDoll, your job is practically a water downed version of a SHIELD agent. Your better off working some other 9-5 job. Forget the dream, it was pretty dumb anyways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake that back.\u201d Y/N said slowly. She felt her throat constrict.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat? I\u2019m speaking the truth. Sometimes I feel kind of embarrassed telling the guys your a CIA agent. Everyone knows you just shag officials for intel and call it a case that\u2019s worth working on.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you think, why don\u2019t you just go find someone who\u2019s got a more worthy job.\u201d Y/N snapped. Bucky looked at her.<br></p><p>\u201cOh come on, don\u2019t be like that. I was just talking to the guys earlier and that\u2019s the kind of shit-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou called my dream a waste.\u201d Y/N said slowly, gazing at him. Tears began to well in her eyes.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m being honest, Y/N.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThen leave.\u201d<br></p><p>Bucky froze, irritation evident on his face.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you have to be so fucking difficult all the time? I feel like I\u2019m constantly walking on eggshells.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen fucking leave you douche bag, maybe it\u2019ll make you feel better!\u201d The tears were now pouring and Y/N hated herself for it.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cIf you just considered for a second what I said-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou literally told me my dream is shit and I should move on. That I\u2019m <i>embarrassing </i>you? God, Bucky you\u2019re supposed to support my decisions! Not fucking drag them. Is that not what comes with loving your partner-\u201d<br></p><p><i>\u201cThen maybe I don\u2019t fucking love you.\u201d</i><br></p><p>He regretted it the moment the sentence left his lips. He watched Y/N\u2019s face fall. Her chin began to quiver. He wanted to punch himself over and over and over again.</p><p>\u00a0She staggered to their bedroom and locked the door. Bucky raced after her, banging on the door. He could hear her sobs and small hiccups. Each cry was like bullet to the heart and he desperately wanted to apologize. Y/N didn\u2019t budge for the next hour and Bucky\u2019s voice grew hoarse from calling out to her. He was irritated that morning. Sam was joking around, poking fun at the CIA. Eventually Y/N\u2019s name came up. Bucky knew it was a joke but he couldn\u2019t help but feel the sting when Sam poked fun at Y/N. He had called Sam out for it but it had clouded his mind for the rest of the morning. Now he let his mouth run and was paying the price.\u00a0</p><p>Bucky tried to pry the door open several hours later. Surprisingly, the door knob gave in. Y/N was in bed, the sheets covering her body. The moonlight cast a sad glow and he could see her tear stained cheeks from where he stood. Bucky was overcome with guilt and slowly approached the bed. He sat beside Y/N\u2019s sleeping figure and softly cradled her cheek. She shot up awake, breathing hard.</p><p>\u201cBuck-\u201d She whispered, clearly distraught. Bucky frowned. <i>She had a nightmare</i>.<br></p><p>\u201cGod, Y/N. I am so sorry-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t-\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust please let me explain myself.\u201d He whispered, his eyes pleading. Y/N looked away, shrugging from his grasp.<br></p><p>\u201cSam was joking about the rivalry between the CIA and SHIELD this morning. I knew he was kidding around but he referred to your job and it just got to me. I am so fucking sorry, I am so incredibly wrong for saying those things. You\u2019re dream means everything to me. You mean everything to me. I am so sorry, I should not have blown up at you. It was wrong and I love you- God, I love you so much.\u201d Bucky bent his head.<br></p><p>\u201cI am not asking for forgiveness but I just want you to know I am so incredibly sorry.\u201d He rasped. Y/N took a deep breath and grabbed his arm. Bucky looked at her and she could see the sorrow behind his glassy blue eyes. She leaned closer to him, brushing her fingers against his cheekbones.<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. You fucked up. But you apologized and that\u2019s important. Just don\u2019t be an asshole ever again?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou have my word.\u201d He mumbled. Y/N leaned into kiss him, grasping his metal arm for support. It started slow and Bucky could taste the salty tears on her lips. He broke away.<br></p><p>\u201cI am so fucking sorry Y/N.\u201d<br></p><p>She wound her hands in his hair and tugged him closer to her. He crawled on top of her, kissing her softly. Slowly the kisses turned more ragged and Y/N found herself rolling her hips against him. He removed his clothes wordlessly as did she, the two focused on feeling each other. Bucky kissed every inch of her body, following her movements to guide his mouth.</p><p>\u201cBuck-\u201d Y/N muttered, cradling his face. He took that as approval and slowly entered her, placing his forehead against hers. Y/N moaned at the feeling, adjusting to his size. Bucky muttered apologies and\u00a0\u2018i love you\u2019s\u2019 into each thrust and Y/N clutched onto his shoulders, feeling a euphoric wave spread across her body. Slowly, the two of them became more rigid before coming undone.</p><p>\u201cI love you, you know that right?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYes Buck. It\u2019s not like you told me a hundred times already.\u201d Y/N said softly, a glowing smile on her face. Bucky pressed his lips against hers.<br></p><p>requested: @j<a href=\"https://jensenackles441.tumblr.com/\">ensenackles441</a></p><p><b>permanent taglist</b> (you can request to be added or taken off!): <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYnxNKioOY3cLPsoD91rItQ\">@dewy-biitch</a></p>",

If someone had told her that she was to fall in love with The Winter Soldier three years ago, she would have reacted with a grimace and a snarky remark. The mere thought would have been revolting. Y/N&rsquo;s hatred for Bucky Barnes stemmed from her gut wrenching hatred for SHIELD. It all started with a simple rejection letter.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>-we regret to inform you that you&rsquo;re application has been denied for all intensive purposes that fall under SHIELD&rsquo;s disclosure-</i>&rdquo; Y/N guffawed, slamming the manila file on the coffee table.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you <i>kidding </i>me? I have met every single qualification. How could they reject my fucking application?&rdquo; She seethed, gripping her hair in frustration. Her roommate, Talia, remained quiet. She picked up the paper and flattened it out.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s odd,&rdquo; Talia squinted at the paper.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;They never mentioned anything about &lsquo;SHIELD&rsquo;s disclosure&rsquo; in my letter.&rdquo; She mumbled. Y/N huffed, crossing her arms in indignation.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because you got an offer! You&rsquo;re an agent.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re working for the CIA? SHIELD takes their loyalties very seriously.&rdquo; Talia stated, ignoring Y/N&rsquo;s remark.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got too much intel with the government. They can&rsquo;t risk recruiting someone with <i>that </i>much power.&rdquo; She added, nudging Y/N. Y/N smiled softly</p><p>&ldquo;Appealing to my ego doesn&rsquo;t make this any-&rdquo; Y/N stopped abruptly, an idea germinating in her mind.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve got an idea.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I doubt it&rsquo;s a good one.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Y/N found herself facing the doors of the Avengers Tower twenty minutes later. <i>They can reject me all they want but I am not going to take no for an answer. </i>The front desk was surprisingly empty and she found herself waiting in the lobby for awhile. That was until a familiar super soldier made his way towards the elevator before peering at her. Y/N held her breath.</p><p>&ldquo;Can I help you?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Bucky stared at her, his gaze unwavering. He looked different than what she had seen on tv. His hair was a warmer shade of brown and bundled at the nape of his neck. His eyes were lighter, a piercing cerulean blue. Y/N thought that the news channels altered his appearance significantly, making him look like he was surrounded by a cloak of exhaustion. He truly looked like a Roman statue carved out of limestone. Bucky cleared his throat.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here to talk to Maria Hill.&rdquo; Y/N sputtered, slowly getting up. His gaze seemed to melt into a glare and she began to think he disliked her.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s on her lunch break. She&rsquo;ll be back in twenty minutes.&rdquo; He replied curtly. Y/N nodded. Bucky didn&rsquo;t move and neither did she.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What are you here for?&rdquo; He asked after a moment. Y/N fumbled for the paper in her pocket, handing it to him.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here to sort this out.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Seems to me like you&rsquo;ve been rejected.&rdquo; He said monotonously, gazing at her again.

He expertly twirled her and moved with confidence to the beat of the music.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You can dance.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You sound shocked.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know jerks could dance.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Bucky looked at her, slightly appalled.</p><p>&ldquo;You think I&rsquo;m a jerk?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been harassing me for the past month, Barnes.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>He frowned.</p><p>&ldquo;I saw it more as teasing. I apologize.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>And the rest of the conversation was a blur of flirtatious comments and amusing remarks. He held Y/N close. She was intoxicating in every way and the two of them found themselves not wanting the night to end. Talia had ended up leaving earlier with her date and informed Y/N with a text and a promise of breakfast on her the following morning. Bucky offered to walk her home.</p><p>&ldquo;I had fun tonight.&rdquo; He mumbled.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say the same.&rdquo; She replied, leaning on the door frame. The two chuckled softly before falling in a comfortable silence. Y/N was buzzing, either from the alcohol or Bucky. She couldn&rsquo;t tell but she didn&rsquo;t want the feeling to go away.</p><p>&ldquo;Would it be weird to kiss you right now?&rdquo; He asked after a moment. Y/N froze, her voice betraying her. She shook her head and Bucky took the small gesture as a yes, bending his head and tentatively pressing his lips onto hers. His lips were warm and tasted sweet. Y/N hummed against him, almost sighing with relief. His hands cupped her jaw softly and Y/N tugged at the collar of his suit almost as if to brace herself. He broke away.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you later, yeah?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Later&rdquo; turned into a date, and one date turned into many. Before they knew it, the two were engaged and later married.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I still can&rsquo;t believe you hated me.&rdquo; Bucky mumbled, filing through the mail.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hate you, I hated the fact that you have history with SHIELD.&rdquo; Y/N responded, wrapping her arms around his waist. The two had spent the morning recounting their history as a means of passing time.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Right, so pent up anger on an agency correlates with being angry at a random guy.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You brought up my rejection every time we met!&rdquo; She responded, pressing ghost kisses against his neck.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I still don&rsquo;t get why you were so hooked on SHIELD. It was just a rejected letter.&rdquo; Bucky said, Y/N froze, removing her arms from his waist.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Bucky, joining SHIELD was my dream. I spent my college years prepping for that application. I trained myself just so I snag a chance at becoming an agent.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well, that was a dream well wasted and dumb. You could be saving lives and instead you&rsquo;re doin paperwork&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Y/N froze, her heart dipping. Bucky&rsquo;s gaze remained on the mail.</p><p>&ldquo;W-What?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Doll, your job is practically a water downed version of a SHIELD agent. Your better off working some other 9-5 job. Forget the dream, it was pretty dumb anyways.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Take that back.&rdquo; Y/N said slowly. She felt her throat constrict.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What? I&rsquo;m speaking the truth. Sometimes I feel kind of embarrassed telling the guys your a CIA agent. Everyone knows you just shag officials for intel and call it a case that&rsquo;s worth working on.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s what you think, why don&rsquo;t you just go find someone who&rsquo;s got a more worthy job.&rdquo; Y/N snapped. Bucky looked at her.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh come on, don&rsquo;t be like that. I was just talking to the guys earlier and that&rsquo;s the kind of shit-&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You called my dream a waste.&rdquo; Y/N said slowly, gazing at him. Tears began to well in her eyes.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m being honest, Y/N.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Then leave.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Bucky froze, irritation evident on his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Why do you have to be so fucking difficult all the time? I feel like I&rsquo;m constantly walking on eggshells.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then fucking leave you douche bag, maybe it&rsquo;ll make you feel better!&rdquo; The tears were now pouring and Y/N hated herself for it.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;If you just considered for a second what I said-&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You literally told me my dream is shit and I should move on. That I&rsquo;m <i>embarrassing </i>you? God, Bucky you&rsquo;re supposed to support my decisions! Not fucking drag them. Is that not what comes with loving your partner-&rdquo;<br /></p><p><i>&ldquo;Then maybe I don&rsquo;t fucking love you.&rdquo;</i><br /></p><p>He regretted it the moment the sentence left his lips. He watched Y/N&rsquo;s face fall. Her chin began to quiver. He wanted to punch himself over and over and over again.</p><p>&nbsp;She staggered to their bedroom and locked the door. Bucky raced after her, banging on the door. He could hear her sobs and small hiccups. Each cry was like bullet to the heart and he desperately wanted to apologize. Y/N didn&rsquo;t budge for the next hour and Bucky&rsquo;s voice grew hoarse from calling out to her. He was irritated that morning. Sam was joking around, poking fun at the CIA. Eventually Y/N&rsquo;s name came up. Bucky knew it was a joke but he couldn&rsquo;t help but feel the sting when Sam poked fun at Y/N. He had called Sam out for it but it had clouded his mind for the rest of the morning. Now he let his mouth run and was paying the price.&nbsp;</p><p>Bucky tried to pry the door open several hours later. Surprisingly, the door knob gave in. Y/N was in bed, the sheets covering her body. The moonlight cast a sad glow and he could see her tear stained cheeks from where he stood. Bucky was overcome with guilt and slowly approached the bed. He sat beside Y/N&rsquo;s sleeping figure and softly cradled her cheek. She shot up awake, breathing hard.</p><p>&ldquo;Buck-&rdquo; She whispered, clearly distraught. Bucky frowned. <i>She had a nightmare</i>.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;God, Y/N. I am so sorry-&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just please let me explain myself.&rdquo; He whispered, his eyes pleading. Y/N looked away, shrugging from his grasp.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Sam was joking about the rivalry between the CIA and SHIELD this morning. I knew he was kidding around but he referred to your job and it just got to me. I am so fucking sorry, I am so incredibly wrong for saying those things. You&rsquo;re dream means everything to me. You mean everything to me. I am so sorry, I should not have blown up at you. It was wrong and I love you- God, I love you so much.&rdquo; Bucky bent his head.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I am not asking for forgiveness but I just want you to know I am so incredibly sorry.&rdquo; He rasped. Y/N took a deep breath and grabbed his arm. Bucky looked at her and she could see the sorrow behind his glassy blue eyes. She leaned closer to him, brushing her fingers against his cheekbones.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. You fucked up. But you apologized and that&rsquo;s important. Just don&rsquo;t be an asshole ever again?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You have my word.&rdquo; He mumbled. Y/N leaned into kiss him, grasping his metal arm for support. It started slow and Bucky could taste the salty tears on her lips. He broke away.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I am so fucking sorry Y/N.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>She wound her hands in his hair and tugged him closer to her. He crawled on top of her, kissing her softly. Slowly the kisses turned more ragged and Y/N found herself rolling her hips against him. He removed his clothes wordlessly as did she, the two focused on feeling each other. Bucky kissed every inch of her body, following her movements to guide his mouth.</p><p>&ldquo;Buck-&rdquo; Y/N muttered, cradling his face. He took that as approval and slowly entered her, placing his forehead against hers. Y/N moaned at the feeling, adjusting to his size. Bucky muttered apologies and&nbsp;&lsquo;i love you&rsquo;s&rsquo; into each thrust and Y/N clutched onto his shoulders, feeling a euphoric wave spread across her body. Slowly, the two of them became more rigid before coming undone.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you, you know that right?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yes Buck. It&rsquo;s not like you told me a hundred times already.&rdquo; Y/N said softly, a glowing smile on her face. Bucky pressed his lips against hers.<br /></p><p>requested: @j<a href=\"https://jensenackles441.tumblr.com/\">ensenackles441</a></p><p><b>permanent taglist</b> (you can request to be added or taken off!): <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYnxNKioOY3cLPsoD91rItQ\">@dewy-biitch</a></p>",

Also a fan of other things like The Flash, The Walking Dead and many other stuff that I can't keep track of. Oh, and I'm a major WinterWitch and WinterWidow shipper as well. \nWhat, you didn't see that coming? Also a fair warning to everyone: This blog will contain occassional spoilers from movies/tv shows both Marvel and DC. And I'll be posting drabbles from time to time.
