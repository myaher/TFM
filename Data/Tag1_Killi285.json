There\u2019s an almost effortless confidence to the show, a certain skill and swagger not unlike that of Jodie Comer\u2019s assassin Villanelle; <em>Killing Eve</em> is a series that almost defies efforts to review it, because elaborating beyond \u201cjust watch it\u201d feels as though you\u2019re wasting time, time that could be better spent watching (and rewatching) <em>Killing Eve</em>. From its witty, charming script to the electric performances from its leads, <em>Killing Eve</em> is a programme where its quality leaps off the screen, the first thing you notice about the show \u2013 seemingly, there\u2019s a certain simplicity to it.</p> <p>But that seeming simplicity, that apparent effortlessness, obscures the clever tricks at the heart of <em>Killing Eve</em>. It <em>is</em> a very talented, very competent execution of all the tropes of a spy thriller, with globetrotting agents uncovering an international conspiracy, entirely recognisable in terms of the conventions of its genre \u2013 but there\u2019s an obvious self-awareness to <em>Killing Eve</em> too, and a clear drive on the part of showrunner Phoebe Waller-Bridge to tell a much more idiosyncratic, much more new and interesting story within the skeleton of the spy thriller.</p> <p>On one level, there\u2019s the fact that we\u2019re watching <em>Killing Eve</em> rather than <em>Killing Evan</em> \u2013 any other piece you might care to name as an example of the same genre would be a male-led story. That <em>Killing Eve</em> isn\u2019t, that it pivots instead around Sandra Oh\u2019s Eve and Jodie Comer\u2019s Villanelle, immediately marks the series out as something different. You wouldn\u2019t be able comb through the script and make a few quick changes to turn it into <em>Killing Evan</em>, though; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/sep/08/phoebe-waller-bridge-fleabag-killing-eve-transgressive-women\">Waller-Bridge\u2019s self-proclaimed interest in \u201ctransgressive women\u201d is evident throughout</a>, the whole series fascinated by its leads and their inner lives, both vast and intimate at once.</p> <figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1152\" data-orig-width=\"1920\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/908e1cc98052c5fd09e48ab5ca3675f9\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/68d4fb1df9de1b8e864c9210126011a0/tumblr_inline_pf5zh6jpVf1vn1rog_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1152\" data-orig-width=\"1920\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/908e1cc98052c5fd09e48ab5ca3675f9\"/></figure><figcaption>Jodie Comer as Villanelle with Sandra Oh as Eve (BBC One)</figcaption><p>That fascination, of course, explains another of the clever tricks at the heart of the show. For all that there\u2019s an obvious fluency in the conventions of a spy genre, there\u2019s a sense that isn\u2019t really a language <em>Killing Eve</em> is interested in speaking: where another show (probably <em>Killing Evan</em>, in fact) might have been more fixated on, for example, the shadowy organisation \u2018the Twelve\u2019, here it\u2019s largely an afterthought. No, instead <em>Killing Eve</em> is far more concerned the relationship between Eve and Villanelle \u2013 and it\u2019s this that makes the show feel so vital.</p> <p>As executive producer Sally Woodward-Gentle noted, <em>\u201c[Phoebe Waller-Bridge is] not that interested in genre; she\u2019s interested in relationships, and the complexity of relationships\u201d</em> \u2013 hence vaguely sketched clandestine groups take a backseat to Eve and Villanelle\u2019s building obsession with one another, a dynamic borne of the gap between who they are and who they want to be. It\u2019s unfamiliar and challenging and enthralling, for both the characters and the audience, and it\u2019s this that makes <em>Killing Eve</em> such an engaging, entertaining watch.</p> <p>Here, then, it\u2019s worth emphasising just how perfectly cast Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer are in their respective roles \u2013 after all, as well written as the material is, it\u2019s Oh and Comer who realise and elevate it with their performances. Where Oh centres the drama with her portrayal of an out of step everywoman, Comer in turn is impish and anarchic \u2013 both are compulsively watchable, each gradually unveiling new depths to their characters. Indeed, though Comer\u2019s portrayal of Villanelle offers more opportunities for her to impress, it\u2019s worth noting how subtle Oh\u2019s take on Eve is, and how many interesting decisions she makes across the course of a given scene. It\u2019s obvious why Oh was nominated for an Emmy, and it\u2019s a huge shame that Comer wasn\u2019t as well; in a way, it feels strange to nominate either without the other, so strong is their chemistry, so intertwined their best work on the programme. When the pair finally meet properly in the fourth episode, it\u2019s electric, the show grabbing onto the third rail and holding on \u2013 and the intensity only builds from there.</p> <p>Ultimately, then, it\u2019s not hard to see why <em>Killing Eve</em> was so successful in America, and why it\u2019s easy to assert with confidence that it\u2019ll be a hit here in the UK. From the stellar leads to the charming script, from its expertly balanced blend of levity and tragedy to the sheer vitality of it all, <em>Killing Eve</em> is a show that\u2019s very, very easy to become obsessed with.</p> <p><strong>Related:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://uk.movies.yahoo.com/handmaids-tale-season-2-go-far-212557885.html\"><em>Did\u00a0</em><em>The Handmaid\u2019s Tale season 2 go too far?</em></a></p> <p><em>Like this article?

It <em>is</em> a very talented, very competent execution of all the tropes of a spy thriller, with globetrotting agents uncovering an international conspiracy, entirely recognisable in terms of the conventions of its genre \u2013 but there\u2019s an obvious self-awareness to <em>Killing Eve</em> too, and a clear drive on the part of showrunner Phoebe Waller-Bridge to tell a much more idiosyncratic, much more new and interesting story within the skeleton of the spy thriller.</p> <p>On one level, there\u2019s the fact that we\u2019re watching <em>Killing Eve</em> rather than <em>Killing Evan</em> \u2013 any other piece you might care to name as an example of the same genre would be a male-led story. That <em>Killing Eve</em> isn\u2019t, that it pivots instead around Sandra Oh\u2019s Eve and Jodie Comer\u2019s Villanelle, immediately marks the series out as something different. You wouldn\u2019t be able comb through the script and make a few quick changes to turn it into <em>Killing Evan</em>, though; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/sep/08/phoebe-waller-bridge-fleabag-killing-eve-transgressive-women\">Waller-Bridge\u2019s self-proclaimed interest in \u201ctransgressive women\u201d is evident throughout</a>, the whole series fascinated by its leads and their inner lives, both vast and intimate at once.</p> <figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1152\" data-orig-width=\"1920\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/908e1cc98052c5fd09e48ab5ca3675f9\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/68d4fb1df9de1b8e864c9210126011a0/tumblr_inline_pf5zh6jpVf1vn1rog_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1152\" data-orig-width=\"1920\" data-orig-src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/os/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/908e1cc98052c5fd09e48ab5ca3675f9\"></figure><figcaption>Jodie Comer as Villanelle with Sandra Oh as Eve (BBC One)</figcaption><p>That fascination, of course, explains another of the clever tricks at the heart of the show. For all that there\u2019s an obvious fluency in the conventions of a spy genre, there\u2019s a sense that isn\u2019t really a language <em>Killing Eve</em> is interested in speaking: where another show (probably <em>Killing Evan</em>, in fact) might have been more fixated on, for example, the shadowy organisation \u2018the Twelve\u2019, here it\u2019s largely an afterthought. No, instead <em>Killing Eve</em> is far more concerned the relationship between Eve and Villanelle \u2013 and it\u2019s this that makes the show feel so vital.</p> <p>As executive producer Sally Woodward-Gentle noted, <em>\u201c[Phoebe Waller-Bridge is] not that interested in genre; she\u2019s interested in relationships, and the complexity of relationships\u201d</em> \u2013 hence vaguely sketched clandestine groups take a backseat to Eve and Villanelle\u2019s building obsession with one another, a dynamic borne of the gap between who they are and who they want to be. It\u2019s unfamiliar and challenging and enthralling, for both the characters and the audience, and it\u2019s this that makes <em>Killing Eve</em> such an engaging, entertaining watch.</p> <p>Here, then, it\u2019s worth emphasising just how perfectly cast Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer are in their respective roles \u2013 after all, as well written as the material is, it\u2019s Oh and Comer who realise and elevate it with their performances. Where Oh centres the drama with her portrayal of an out of step everywoman, Comer in turn is impish and anarchic \u2013 both are compulsively watchable, each gradually unveiling new depths to their characters. Indeed, though Comer\u2019s portrayal of Villanelle offers more opportunities for her to impress, it\u2019s worth noting how subtle Oh\u2019s take on Eve is, and how many interesting decisions she makes across the course of a given scene. It\u2019s obvious why Oh was nominated for an Emmy, and it\u2019s a huge shame that Comer wasn\u2019t as well; in a way, it feels strange to nominate either without the other, so strong is their chemistry, so intertwined their best work on the programme. When the pair finally meet properly in the fourth episode, it\u2019s electric, the show grabbing onto the third rail and holding on \u2013 and the intensity only builds from there.</p> <p>Ultimately, then, it\u2019s not hard to see why <em>Killing Eve</em> was so successful in America, and why it\u2019s easy to assert with confidence that it\u2019ll be a hit here in the UK. From the stellar leads to the charming script, from its expertly balanced blend of levity and tragedy to the sheer vitality of it all, <em>Killing Eve</em> is a show that\u2019s very, very easy to become obsessed with.</p> <p><strong>Related:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://uk.movies.yahoo.com/handmaids-tale-season-2-go-far-212557885.html\"><em>Did\u00a0</em><em>The Handmaid\u2019s Tale season 2 go too far?</em></a></p> <p><em>Like this article?

Its the soft method which means not as violent as the hard method, which involves guns or hanging. </p><p>Niko grew up on the wrong side of the tracks so he also has an aversion to violence which also explains why he doesnt understand or actually dislikes Eve&rsquo;s humor towards violence. &ldquo;He is a reliable old wall, standing solidly behind her. She doesn&rsquo;t even need to check behind her to know he is there&hellip; a habit she will regret&rdquo; THIS IS SO FUNNY. Eve&rsquo;s next job will be to learn how to play Hide and Seek.</p><p>Bill sees work as a haven from home but also wants to spend a lot of time with his daughter. He is a tired soul. I guess&hellip; Villanelle did him a favor then&hellip; jsjdkdbd.</p><p>Elena is just a year older than Villanelle, 27! She studied computer studies and is &ldquo;strategically climbing the ladder until she can move sideways and become a spook&rdquo;. So she really is the definition of &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;m working my way sideways instead of upwards&rdquo; to fully become the monster mastermind that she is. Next thing you know she will ask you if you want to hear a ghost story and you&rsquo;ll say &ldquo;no&rdquo; and she will go &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the spirit&rdquo; (where is that gifset I need it). </p><p>Kenny: &ldquo;Wants: Elena&rdquo; for someone who is actually terrified of the thought of dating real women he got great taste. He meets her and falls in love instantly. &ldquo;and completely freaks out&rdquo; YOU DON&rsquo;T SAY, he even forgets how to type &ldquo;professional&rdquo; smh. He is a gamer and is smelly so I guess that explains his line &ldquo;sorry about the smell&rdquo;. </p>",
