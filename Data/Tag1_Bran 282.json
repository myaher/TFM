He is only called &ldquo;<b>Brandon</b>&rdquo; by his mother when he has done something wrong. <b>Bran </b>dreams of being a knight of the Kingsguard, and his favorite hobby is climbing the walls of Winterfell, using its old rooftops and passageways to get around.\n\n<br/></p><p><b>Bran </b>is a warg and currently the new Three-Eyed Raven, using his supernatural gifts to assist his family in the war against the White Walkers.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1018\" data-orig-width=\"800\"><img data-orig-height=\"1018\" data-orig-width=\"800\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7490d98c88e07335d6ca0736c570c75e/tumblr_inline_pewgnyUnbu1qbv7u8_540.jpg\"/></figure><h2><b><i>Appearance and Personality</i></b></h2><p><b>Bran </b>has his mother&rsquo;s coloring, with the thick auburn hair and deep blue eyes associated with House Tully.</p><p><b>Bran </b>is a pleasant young boy, regarded fondly by the people of Winterfell.\u00a0Before the incident of his fall, <b>Bran </b>was an extremely curious and adventurous boy. He was noted by his mother, and by his brother Robb, to have done a great amount of climbing around the walls of Winterfell and having never fallen, showing a considerable amount of bravery on his part. His curiosity was in large part what led to his fall in the first place, since he was drawn into the encounter between Jaime and Cersei out of sheer curiosity as to what was happening.\u00a0After his fall, <b>Bran&rsquo;s </b>rapidly worsening situation forced him to become far more solemn and apprehensive than the cheerful child he had once been. After words <b>Bran </b>had it in him to be a good lord in his own right, as proven by his brief tenure as acting Lord of Winterfell when Robb left to fight Tywin Lannister.</p><p>Upon meeting Jojen Reed, <b>Bran </b>proved capable of accepting the powers that he possessed, showing an open mind on his part, even if such a thing set him apart from companions like Osha. He became almost unbreakably determined to meet the Three-Eyed Raven that kept coming to him in his dreams, even if it meant separating from his brother Rickon and, later on, from Jon Snow. When <b>Bran </b>finally reached the Three-Eyed Raven, one of the first things he pressed the Three-Eyed Raven about is whether or not <b>Bran </b>could walk again, and is briefly disappointed when told that he will never walk again.</p><p>After growing up under the tutelage of the Three-Eyed Raven, <b>Bran </b>maintains his curious nature, especially when he and the Raven visit Winterfell; his curiosity piques when he sees his long-dead aunt Lyanna. <b>Bran </b>is disappointed by the prospect of returning to the real world. Later on, <b>Bran </b>expresses confusion when witnessing the duel at the Tower of Joy, especially when his young father started losing the duel - this confusion turned to horror when he realized that Arthur Dayne lost only because Howland Reed blindsided him, having been told all his life that Ned ultimately killed the man in an honorable duel. This horror resurfaced when he realized that the Children of the Forest were responsible for the creation of the White Walkers, only to be silenced when <a title=\"Leaf\" href=\"http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Leaf\">Leaf</a> cited the havoc caused by men to be the main reason for this course of action. He also shows incredulity at what his own powers can accomplish, as shown when he realizes how he is responsible for breaking Hodor&rsquo;s mind in the first place.</p><p>Upon returning from Beyond the Wall, <b>Bran&rsquo;s </b>personality has changed significantly, as a result of the expansion his powers have taken since the battle at the Cave of the Three-Eyed Raven. He has become extremely calm to a fault, to the point of being almost detached from everyone else around him. Having become the new Three-Eyed Raven, <b>Bran </b>has been given access to many more events, which he explains several times, so much that <b>Bran </b>becomes aware of almost anything, for example the wedding between his sister Sansa and Ramsay Bolton, and even the conversation between Littlefinger and Varys. He also shows a rather dangerous and threatening side, as evidenced by his deadpan recital of Chaos is a ladder to Petyr Baelish, outright showing that he knows how treacherous Petyr is and what he has done against House Stark in the past, but also suggesting that Petyr is unable to manipulate him. Also, <b>Bran </b>shows himself to have become almost wiser than he was before, ultimately not accepting the Valyrian steel dagger that Littlefinger gives him, citing that it would be useless for a cripple, but at the same time obviously not trusting the gifts that the man gives him.

He was noted by his mother, and by his brother Robb, to have done a great amount of climbing around the walls of Winterfell and having never fallen, showing a considerable amount of bravery on his part. His curiosity was in large part what led to his fall in the first place, since he was drawn into the encounter between Jaime and Cersei out of sheer curiosity as to what was happening.\u00a0After his fall, <b>Bran\u2019s </b>rapidly worsening situation forced him to become far more solemn and apprehensive than the cheerful child he had once been. After words <b>Bran </b>had it in him to be a good lord in his own right, as proven by his brief tenure as acting Lord of Winterfell when Robb left to fight Tywin Lannister.</p><p>Upon meeting Jojen Reed, <b>Bran </b>proved capable of accepting the powers that he possessed, showing an open mind on his part, even if such a thing set him apart from companions like Osha.

Later on, <b>Bran </b>expresses confusion when witnessing the duel at the Tower of Joy, especially when his young father started losing the duel - this confusion turned to horror when he realized that Arthur Dayne lost only because Howland Reed blindsided him, having been told all his life that Ned ultimately killed the man in an honorable duel. This horror resurfaced when he realized that the Children of the Forest were responsible for the creation of the White Walkers, only to be silenced when <a title=\"Leaf\" href=\"http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Leaf\">Leaf</a> cited the havoc caused by men to be the main reason for this course of action.

Also, <b>Bran </b>shows himself to have become almost wiser than he was before, ultimately not accepting the Valyrian steel dagger that Littlefinger gives him, citing that it would be useless for a cripple, but at the same time obviously not trusting the gifts that the man gives him.

He saw the Wall shining like blue crystal, and his bastard brother Jon sleeping alone in a cold bed, his skin growing pale and hard as the memory of all warmth fled from him. And he looked past the Wall, past endless forests cloaked in snow, past the frozen shore and the great blue-white rivers of ice and the dead plains where nothing grew or lived. North and north and north he looked, to the curtain of light at the end of the world, and\n\n\n then beyond that curtain. He looked deep into the heart of winter, and then he cried out, afraid, and the heat of his tears burned on his cheeks.</i>\u201d\n\n\n<br/></p><p>Hum. A hard nut to crack.\u00a0</p><p>Might have something to do with ice magic. It reminds me of when Jon had woken up outside of Craster\u2019s keep, in ACOK, to find the surrounding forest sort of\u00a0\u201csuspended in time\u201d, covered in tiny shiny crystals and stuff, and marveling at how magical it looked. Back then, the magic faded once people around him started waking up, almost like human presences were, by themselves, enough to crush or dissipate the magic. That might explain why, in Bran\u2019s vision, the absence of living human being (or any living being) is so strongly insinuated:</p><p>\n\n<b><i>shining like blue crystal</i>\u00a0</b>(&hellip;)\u00a0\n\n<i><b>endless forests cloaked in snow</b>, past the frozen shore and the <b>great blue-white rivers of ice </b>and the <b>dead plains where nothing grew or lived</b>.</i>\n\n<br/></p><p>The\u00a0\u201cshining blue crystal\u201d on the Wall also reminds me of the blue flower in a chink of ice, and the forests\u00a0\u201ccloaked\u201d in snow might be a wink to a marriage of sorts (snow \u201ccloaking\u201d the bride).\u00a0</p><p>There might also be an ambiguity between looking/going\u00a0\u201cpast\u201d something (as in, beyond), and going in the past, or seeing/witnessing/recalling something that happened a long time ago:</p><p>\n\n<i><b>the memory</b> of all warmth <b>fled from him</b>.
